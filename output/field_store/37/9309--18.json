The general motive, then, of  painting during the High Renaissance, though apparently religious from  the subject, and in many cases still religious in feeling, was largely  to show the beauty of form or color, in which religion, the antique,  and the natural came in as modifying elements.    In technical methods, though extensive work was still done in fresco,  especially at Florence and Rome, yet the bulk of High-Renaissance  painting was in oils upon panel and canvas. At Venice even the  decorative wall paintings were upon canvas, afterward inserted in wall  or ceiling.    [Illustration: FIG. 39.--ANDREA DEL SARTO. MADONNA OF ST. FRANCIS.  UFFIZI.]    THE FLORENTINES AND ROMANS: There was a severity and austerity about  the Florentine art, even at its climax. It was never too sensuous and  luxurious, but rather exact and intellectual. The Florentines were  fond of lustreless fresco, architectural composition, towering or  sweeping lines, rather sharp color as compared with the Venetians, and  theological, classical, even literary and allegorical subjects.  Probably this was largely due to the classic bias of the painters and  the intellectual and social influences of Florence and Rome. Line and  composition were means of expressing abstract thought better than  color, though some of the Florentines employed both line and color  knowingly.    This was the case with Fra Bartolommeo (1475-1517), a monk of San  Marco, who was a transition painter from the fifteenth to the  sixteenth century. He was a religionist, a follower of Savonarola, and  a man of soul who thought to do work of a religious character and  feeling; but he was also a fine painter, excelling in composition,  drawing, drapery, color. The painter's element in his work, its  material and earthly beauty, rather detracted from its spiritual  significance. He opposed the sensuous and the nude, and yet about the  only nude he ever painted--a St. Sebastian for San Marco--had so much  of the earthly about it that people forgot the suffering saint in  admiring the fine body, and the picture had to be removed from the  convent. In such ways religion in art was gradually undermined, not  alone by naturalism and classicism but by art itself. Painting brought  into life by religion no sooner reached maturity than it led people  away from religion by pointing out sensuous beauties in the type  rather than religious beauties in the symbol.    Fra Bartolommeo was among the last of the pietists in art. He had no  great imagination, but some feeling and a fine color-sense for  Florence. Naturally he was influenced somewhat by the great ones about  him, learning perspective from Raphael, grandeur from Michael Angelo,  and contours from Leonardo da Vinci. He worked in collaboration with  Albertinelli (1474-1515), a skilled artist and a fellow-pupil with  Bartolommeo in the workshop of Cosimo Rosselli. Their work is so much  alike that it is often difficult to distinguish the painters apart.  Albertinelli was not so devout as his companion, but he painted the  religious subject with feeling, as his Visitation in the Uffizi  indicates. Among the followers of Bartolommeo and Albertinelli were  Fra Paolino (14901547), Bugiardini (1475-1554), Granacci (1477-1543),  who showed many influences, and Ridolfo Ghirlandajo (1483-1561).    [Illustration: FIG. 40.--MICHAEL ANGELO. ATHLETE. SISTINE, ROME.]    Andrea del Sarto (1486-1531) was a Florentine pure and simple--a  painter for the Church producing many madonnas and altar-pieces, and  yet possessed of little religious feeling or depth. He was a painter  more than a pietist, and was called by his townsmen \"the faultless  painter.\" So he was as regards the technical features of his art. He  was the best brushman and colorist of the Florentine school. Dealing  largely with the material side his craftsmanship was excellent and his  pictures exuberant with life and color, but his madonnas and saints  were decidedly of the earth--handsome Florentine models garbed as  sacred characters--well-drawn and easily painted, with little  devotional feeling about them. He was influenced by other painters to  some extent. Masaccio, Ghirlandajo, and Michael Angelo were his models  in drawing; Leonardo and Bartolommeo in contours; while in warmth of  color, brush-work, atmospheric and landscape effects he was quite by  himself. He had a large number of pupils and followers, but most of  them deserted him later on to follow Michael Angelo. Pontormo  (1493-1558) and Franciabigio (1482-1525) were among the best of them.    Michael Angelo (1474-1564) has been called the \"Prophet of the  Renaissance,\" and perhaps deserves the title, since he was more of the  Old Testament than the New--more of the austere and imperious than the  loving or the forgiving. There was no sentimental feature about his  art. His conception was intellectual, highly imaginative, mysterious,  at times disordered and turbulent in its strength. He came the nearest  to the sublime of any painter in history through the sole attribute of  power. He had no tenderness nor any winning charm. He did not win, but  rather commanded. Everything he saw or felt was studied for the  strength that was in it. Religion, Old-Testament history, the antique,  humanity, all turned in his hands into symbolic forms of power, put  forth apparently in the white heat of passion, and at times in  defiance of every rule and tradition of art. Personal feeling was very  apparent in his work, and in this he was as far removed as possible  from the Greeks, and nearer to what one would call to-day a  romanticist. There was little of the objective about him. He was not  an imitator of facts but a creator of forms and ideas. His art was a  reflection of himself--a self-sufficient man, positive, creative,  standing alone, a law unto himself.    Technically he was more of a sculptor than a painter. He said so  himself when Julius commanded him to paint the Sistine ceiling, and he  told the truth. He was a magnificent draughtsman, and drew magnificent  sculpturesque figures on the Sistine vault. That was about all his  achievement with the brush. In color, light, air, perspective--in all  those features peculiar to the painter--he was behind his  contemporaries. Composition he knew a great deal about, and in drawing  he had the most positive, far-reaching command of line of any painter  of any time. It was in drawing that he showed his power. Even this is  severe and harsh at times, and then again filled with a grace that is  majestic and in scope universal, as witness the Creation of Adam in  the Sistine.    [Illustration: FIG. 41.--RAPHAEL. LA BELLE JARDINIERE. LOUVRE.]    He came out of Florence, a pupil of Ghirlandajo, with a school feeling  for line, stimulated by the frescos of Masaccio and Signorelli. At an  early age he declared himself, and hewed a path of his own through  art, sweeping along with him many of the slighter painters of his age.  Long-lived he saw his contemporaries die about him and Humanism end in  bloodshed with the coming of the Jesuits; but alone, gloomy, resolute,  steadfast to his belief, he held his way, the last great  representative of Florentine art, the first great representative of  individualism in art. With him and after him came many followers who  strove to imitate his \"terrible style,\" but they did not succeed any  too well.    The most of these followers find classification under the Mannerists  of the Decadence. Of those who were immediate pupils of Michael  Angelo, or carried out his designs, Daniele da Volterra (1509-1566)  was one of the most satisfactory. His chief work, the Descent from the  Cross, was considered by Poussin as one of the three great pictures of  the world. It is sometimes said to have been designed by Michael  Angelo, but that is only a conjecture. It has much action and life in  it, but is somewhat affected in pose and gesture, and Volterra's work  generally was deficient in real energy of conception and execution.  Marcello Venusti (1515-1585?) painted directly from Michael Angelo's  designs in a delicate and precise way, probably imbibed from his  master, Perino del Vaga, and from association with Venetians like  Sebastiano del Piombo (1485-1547). This last-named painter was born in  Venice and trained under Bellini and Giorgione, inheriting the color  and light-and-shade qualities of the Venetians; but later on he went  to Rome and came under the influence of Michael Angelo and Raphael. He  tried, under Michael Angelo's inspiration it is said, to unite the  Florentine grandeur of line with the Venetian coloring, and thus outdo  Raphael. It was not wholly successful, though resulting in an  excellent quality of art. As a portrait-painter he was above reproach.  His early works were rather free in impasto, the late ones smooth and  shiny, in imitation of Raphael.    Raphael Sanzio (1483-1520) was more Greek in method than any of the  great Renaissance painters. In subject he was not more classic than  others of his time; he painted all subjects. In thought he was not  particularly classic; he was chiefly intellectual, with a leaning  toward the sensuous that was half-pagan. It was in method and  expression more than elsewhere that he showed the Greek spirit. He  aimed at the ideal and the universal, independent, so far as possible,  of the individual, and sought by a union of all elements to produce  perfect harmony. The Harmonist of the Renaissance is his title. And  this harmony extended to a blending of thought, form, and expression,  heightening or modifying every element until they ran together with  such rhythm that it could not be seen where one left off and another  began. He was the very opposite of Michael Angelo. The art of the  latter was an expression of individual power and was purely  subjective. Raphael's art was largely a unity of objective beauties,  with the personal element as much in abeyance as was possible for "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18908"],[0,"Christmas (#16)"],[1," season of Advent, until they break forth in  full jubilee on the morning that brought peace and good-will to men. I  do not know a grander effect of music on the moral feelings than to hear  the full choir and the pealing organ performing a Christmas anthem in a  cathedral, and filling every part of the vast pile with triumphant  harmony.    It is a beautiful arrangement, also, derived from the days of yore, that  this festival, which commemorates the announcement of the religion of  peace and love, has been made the season for gathering together of  family connections, and drawing closer again those bands of kindred  hearts, which the cares and pleasures and sorrows of the world are  continually operating to cast loose; of calling back the children of a  family, who have launched forth in life, and wandered widely asunder,  once more to assemble about the paternal hearth, that rallying-place of  the affections, there to grow young and loving again among the endearing  mementos of childhood.    There is something in the very season of the year, that gives a charm to  the festivity of Christmas. At other times, we derive a great portion of  our pleasures from the mere beauties of Nature. Our feelings sally forth  and dissipate themselves over the sunny landscape, and we \"live abroad  and everywhere.\" The song of the bird, the murmur of the stream, the  breathing fragrance of spring, the soft voluptuousness of summer, the  golden pomp of autumn; earth with its mantle of refreshing green, and  heaven with its deep, delicious blue and its cloudy magnificence,--all  fill us with mute but exquisite delight, and we revel in the luxury of  mere sensation. But in the depth of winter, when Nature lies despoiled  of every charm, and wrapped in her shroud of sheeted snow, we turn for  our gratifications to moral sources. The dreariness and desolation of  our landscape, the short gloomy days and darksome nights, while they  circumscribe our wanderings, shut in our feelings also from rambling  abroad, and make us more keenly disposed for the pleasures of the social  circle. Our thoughts are more concentrated; our friendly sympathies more  aroused. We feel more sensibly the charm of each other's society, and  are brought more closely together by dependence on each other for  enjoyment. Heart calleth unto heart, and we draw our pleasures from the  deep wells of living kindness which lie in the quiet recesses of our  bosoms; and which, when resorted to, furnish forth the pure element of  domestic felicity.    The pitchy gloom without makes the heart dilate on entering the room  filled with the glow and warmth of the evening fire. The ruddy blaze  diffuses an artificial summer and sunshine through the room, and lights  up each countenance with a kindlier welcome. Where does the honest face  of hospitality expand into a broader and more cordial smile--where is  the shy glance of love more sweetly eloquent--than by the winter  fireside? and as the hollow blast of wintry wind rushes through the  hall, claps the distant door, whistles about the casement, and rumbles  down the chimney, what can be more grateful than that feeling of sober  and sheltered security, with which we look around upon the comfortable  chamber, and the scene of domestic hilarity?    The English, from the great prevalence of rural habits throughout every  class of society, have always been fond of those festivals and holidays  which agreeably interrupt the stillness of country life; and they were  in former days particularly observant of the religious and social rights  of Christmas. It is inspiring to read even the dry details which some  antiquaries have given of the quaint humors, the burlesque pageants, the  complete abandonment to mirth and good fellowship, with which this  festival was celebrated. It seemed to throw open every door, unlock  every heart. It brought the peasant and the peer together, and blended  all ranks in one warm generous flow of joy and kindness. The old halls  of castles and manor-houses resounded with the harp and the Christmas  carol, and their ample boards groaned under the weight of hospitality.  Even the poorest cottage welcomed the festive season with green  decorations of bay and holly--the cheerful fire glanced its rays through  the lattice, inviting the passenger to raise the latch, and join the  gossip knot huddled round the hearth beguiling the long evening with  legendary jokes, and oft-told Christmas tales.    One of the least pleasing effects of modern refinement is the havoc it  has made among the hearty old holiday customs. It has completely taken  off the sharp touchings and spirited reliefs of these embellishments of  life, and has worn down society into a more smooth and polished, but  certainly a less characteristic surface. Many of the games and  ceremonials of Christmas have entirely disappeared, and, like the  sherris sack of old Falstaff, are become matters of speculation and  dispute among commentators. They flourished in times full of spirit and  lustihood, when men enjoyed life roughly, but heartily and vigorously:  times wild and picturesque, which have furnished poetry with its richest  materials, and the drama with its most attractive variety of characters  and manners. The world has become more worldly. There is more of  dissipation and less enjoyment. Pleasure has expanded into a broader,  but a shallower stream, and has forsaken many of those deep and quiet  channels, where it flowed sweetly through the calm bosom of domestic  life. Society has acquired a more enlightened and elegant tone; but it  has lost many of its strong local peculiarities, its homebred feelings,  its honest fireside delights. The traditionary customs of golden-hearted  antiquity, its feudal hospitalities, and lordly wassailings, have passed  away with the baronial castles and stately manor-houses in which they  were celebrated. They comported with the shadowy hall, the great oaken  gallery, and the tapestried parlor, but are unfitted for the light showy  saloons and gay drawing-rooms of the modern villa.    Shorn, however, as it is, of its ancient and festive honors, Christmas  is still a period of delightful excitement in England. It is gratifying  to see that home feeling completely aroused which holds so powerful a  place in every English bosom. The preparations making on every side for  the social board that is again to unite friends and kindred--the  presents of good cheer passing and repassing, those tokens of regard and  quickeners of kind feelings--the evergreens distributed about houses and  churches, emblems of peace and gladness--all these have the most  pleasing effect in producing fond associations, and kindling benevolent  sympathies. Even the sound of the waits, rude as may be their  minstrelsy, breaks upon the midwatches of a winter night with the effect  of perfect harmony. As I have been awakened by them in that still and  solemn hour \"when deep sleep falleth upon man,\" I have listened with a  hushed delight, and connecting them with the sacred and joyous occasion,  have almost fancied them into another celestial choir, announcing peace  and good-will to mankind. How delightfully the imagination, when wrought  upon by these moral influences, turns everything to melody and beauty!  The very crowing of the cock, heard sometimes in the profound repose of  the country, \"telling the night-watches to his feathery dames,\" was  thought by the common people to announce the approach of the sacred  festival:        \"Some say that ever 'gainst that season comes      Wherein our Saviour's birth was celebrated,      This bird of dawning singeth all night long:      And then, they say, no spirit dares stir abroad;      The nights are wholesome--then no planets strike,      No fairy takes, no witch hath power to charm,      So hallowed and so gracious is the time.\"    Amidst the general call to happiness, the bustle of the spirits, and  stir of the affections, which prevail at this period, what bosom can  remain insensible? It is, indeed, the season of regenerated feeling--the  season for kindling not merely the fire of hospitality in the hall, but  the genial flame of charity in the heart. The scene of early love again  rises green to memory beyond the sterile waste of years, and the idea of  home, fraught with the fragrance of home-dwelling joys, reanimates the  drooping spirit--as the Arabian breeze will sometimes waft the freshness  of the distant fields to the weary pilgrim of the desert.    Stranger and sojourner as I am in the land--though for me no social  hearth may blaze, no hospitable roof throw open its doors, nor the warm  grasp of friendship welcome me at the threshold--yet I feel the  influence of the season beaming into my soul from the happy looks of  those around me. Surely happiness is reflective, like the light of  heaven; and every countenance bright with smiles, and glowing with  innocent enjoyment, is a mirror transmitting to others the rays of a  supreme and ever-shining benevolence. He who can turn churlishly away  from contemplating the felicity of his fellow-beings, and can sit down  darkling and repining in his loneliness when all around is joyful, may  have his moments of strong excitement and selfish gratification, but he  wants the genial and social sympathies which constitute the charm of a  merry Christmas.           *       *       *       *       *        CHURCH DECKING AT CHRISTMAS        WILLIAM WORDSWORTH        Would that our scrupulous sires had dared to leave        Less scanty measure of those graceful rites        And usages, whose due return invites      A stir of mind too natural to deceive;      Giving the memory help when she could weave        A crown for Hope!--I dread the boasted lights        That all too often are but fiery blights,      Killing the bud o'er which in vain we grieve.
