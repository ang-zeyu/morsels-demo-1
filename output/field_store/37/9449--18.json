In another portion of the manuscript, we find a list of their  church books, written at the same time;[128] it affords a brilliant proof  of the plentitude of the gospels among them; for no less than twenty-five  copies are described. We may judge to what height the art of bookbinding  had arrived by the account here given of these precious volumes. Some  were in a splendid coopertoria of gold and silver, and others exquisitely  ornamented with figures of our Saviour and the four Evangelists.[129] But  this extravagant costliness rendered them attractive objects to pilfering  hands, and somewhat accounts for the lament of the industrious Somner,  who says that the library was \"shamefully robbed and spoiled of them  all.\"[130]    Our remarks on the monastic library at Canterbury are drawing to a close.  Henry Chiclely, archbishop in 1413, an excellent man, and a great  promoter of learning, rebuilt the library of the church, and furnished it  with many a choice tome.[131] His esteem for literature was so great,  that he built two colleges at Oxford.[132] William Sellinge, who was a  man of erudition, and deeply imbued with the book-loving mania, was  elected prior in 1472. He is said to have studied at Bonania, in Italy;  and, during his travels, he gathered together \"all the ancient authors,  both Greek and Latine, he could get,\" and returned laden with them to his  own country. Many of them were of great rarity, and it is said that a  Tully _de Republica_ was among them. Unfortunately, they were all burnt  by a fire in the monastery.[133]    I have said enough, I think, to show that books were eagerly sought  after, and deeply appreciated, in Canterbury cloisters during the middle  ages, and when the reader considers that these facts have been preserved  from sheer accident, and, therefore, only enable us to obtain a partial  glimpse of the actual state of their library, he will be ready to admit  that bibliomania existed then, and will feel thankful, too, that it did,  for to its influence, surely, we are indebted for the preservation of  much that is valuable and instructive in history and general  literature.[134]    We can scarcely leave Kent without a word or two respecting the church of  the Rochester monks. It was founded by King Ethelbert, who conferred upon  it the dignities of an episcopal see, in the year 600; and, dedicating it  to St. Andrew, completed the good work by many donations and emoluments.  The revenues of the see were always limited, and it is said that its  poverty caused it to be treated with kind forbearance by the  ecclesiastical commissioners at the period of the Reformation.    I have not been able to meet with any catalogue of its monastic library,  and the only hints I can obtain relative to their books are such as may  be gathered from the recorded donations of its learned prelates and  monks. In the year 1077, Gundulph, a Norman bishop, who is justly  celebrated for his architectural talents, rebuilt the cathedral, and  considerable remains of this structure are still to be seen in the nave  and west front, and display that profuse decoration united with ponderous  stability, for which the Norman buildings are so remarkable. This  munificent prelate also enriched the church with numerous and costly  ornaments; the encouragement he gave to learning calls for some notice  here. Trained in one of the most flourishing of the Norman schools, we  are not surprised that in his early youth he was so studious and  inquisitive after knowledge as to merit the especial commendation of his  biographer.[135] William of Malmsbury, too, highly extols him \"for his  abundant piety,\" and tells us that he was not inexperienced in literary  avocations; he was polished and courageous in the management of judicial  affairs, and a close, devoted student of the divine writings;[136] as a  scribe he was industrious and critical, and the great purpose to which he  applied his patience and erudition was a careful revisal of the Holy  Scriptures. He purged the sacred volume of the inadvertencies of the  scribes, and restored the purity of the text; for transcribing after  transcribing had caused some errors and diversity of readings to occur,  between the English and foreign codices, in spite of all the pious care  of the monastic copyists; this was perplexing, an uniformity was  essential and he undertook the task;[137] labors so valuable deserve the  highest praise, and we bestow it more liberally upon him for this good  work than we should have done had he been the compiler of crude homilies  or the marvellous legends of saints. The high veneration in which  Gundulph held the patristic writings induced him to bestow his attention  in a similar manner upon them, he compared copies, studied their various  readings and set to work to correct them. The books necessary for these  critical researches he obtained from the libraries of his former master,  Bishop Lanfranc, St. Anselm, his schoolfellow, and many others who were  studying at Bec, but besides this, he corrected many other authors, and  by comparing them with ancient manuscripts, restored them to their  primitive beauty. Fabricius[138] notices a fine volume, which bore ample  testimony to his critical erudition and dexterity as a scribe. It is  described as a large Bible on parchment, written in most beautiful  characters, it was proved to be his work by this inscription on its title  page, \"_Prima pars Bibliae per bona memoriae Gundulphum Rossensem  Episcopum_.\" This interesting manuscript, formerly in the library of the  monks of Rochester, was regarded as one of their most precious volumes.  An idea of the great value of a Bible in those times may be derived from  the curious fact that the bishop made a decree directing \"excommunication  to be pronounced against whosoever should take away or conceal this  volume, or who should even dare to conceal the inscription on the front,  which indicated the volume to be the property of the church of  Rochester.\" But we must bear in mind that this was no ordinary copy, it  was transcribed by Gundulph's own pen, and rendered pure in its text by  his critical labors. But the time came when anathemas availed nought, and  excommunication was divested of all terror. \"Henry the Eighth,\" the  \"Defender of the Faith,\" frowned destruction upon the monks, and in the  tumult that ensued, this treasure was carried away, anathema and all.  Somehow or other it got to Amsterdam, perhaps sent over in one of those  \"shippes full,\" to the bookbinders, and having passed through many hands,  at last found its way into the possession of Herman Van de Wal,  Burgomaster of Amsterdam; since then it was sold by public auction, but  has now I believe been lost sight of.[139] Among the numerous treasures  which Gundulph gave to his church, he included a copy of the Gospels, two  missals and a book of Epistles.[140] Similar books were given by  succeeding prelates; Radolphus, a Norman bishop in 1108, gave the monks  several copies of the gospels beautifully adorned.[141] Earnulphus, in  the year 1115, was likewise a benefactor in this way; he bestowed upon  them, besides many gold and silver utensils for the church, a copy of the  gospels, lessons for the principal days, a benedictional, or book of  blessings, a missal, handsomely bound, and a capitular.[142] Ascelin,  formerly prior of Dover, and made bishop of Rochester, in the year 1142,  gave them a Psalter and the Epistles of St. Paul, with a gloss.[143] He  was a learned man, and excessively fond of books; a passion which he had  acquired no doubt in his monastery of Dover which possessed a library of  no mean extent.[144] He wrote a commentary on Isaiah, and gave it to the  monastery; Walter, archdeacon of Canterbury, who succeeded Ascelin, gave  a copy of the gospels bound in gold, to the church;[145] and Waleran,  elected bishop in the year 1182, presented them with a glossed Psalter,  the Epistles of Paul, and the Sermons of Peter.[146]    Glanvill, bishop in the year 1184, endeavored to deprive the monks of the  land which Gundulph had bestowed upon them; this gave to rise to many  quarrels[147] which the monks never forgave; it is said that he died  without regret, and was buried without ceremony; yet the curious may  still inspect his tomb on the north side of the altar, with his effigies  and mitre lying at length upon it.[148] Glanvill probably repented of his  conduct, and he strove to banish all animosity by many donations; and  among other treasures, he gave the monks the five books of Moses and  other volumes.[149]    Osbern of Shepey, who was prior in the year 1189, was a great scribe and  wrote many volumes for the library; he finished the Commentary of  Ascelin, transcribed a history of Peter, a Breviary for the chapel, a  book called _De Claustra animae_, and wrote the great Psalter which is  chained to the choir and window of St. Peter's altar.[150] Ralph de Ross,  and Heymer de Tunebregge,[151] also bestowed gifts of a similar nature  upon the monks; but the book anecdotes connected with this monastic  fraternity are remarkably few, barren of interest, and present no very  exalted idea of their learning.[152]    FOOTNOTES:    [88] Bede, iv. cap. ii.

There's a woman       in the next cell, who was arrested for fighting. She is swearing       frightfully. It almost makes me sick to be in such a place. It's       pretty hard to have this happen to me just when I was getting along       so well. But I hope it'll all come out right. Your true friend,         \"DICK.         \"P.S.--I've given my watch and chain to the officer to keep for me.       Gold watches aint fashionable here, and I didn't want them to think       me putting on airs.         \"_Station-House, Franklin Street._\"    After Dick had written these letters he was left to himself. His  reflections, as may readily be supposed, were not the most pleasant.  What would they think at the boarding-house, if they should find what  kind of business it was that had detained him! Even if he was acquitted,  some might suppose that he was really guilty. But there was a worse  contingency. He might be unable to prove his innocence, and might be  found guilty. In that case he would be sent to the Island. Dick  shuddered at the thought. Just when he began to feel himself  respectable, it was certainly bad to meet with such hard luck. What,  too, would Mr. Greyson and Ida think? He had been so constant at the  Sunday school that his absence would be sure to be noticed, and he knew  that his former mode of life would make his guilt more readily believed  in the present instance.    \"If Ida should think me a pick-pocket!\" thought poor Dick, and the  thought made him miserable enough. The fact was, that Ida, by her  vivacity and lively manners, and her evident partiality for his society,  had quite won upon Dick, who considered her by all odds the nicest girl  he had ever seen. I don't mean to say that Dick was in love,--at least  not yet. Both he and Ida were too young for that; but he was certainly  quite an admirer of the young lady. Again, if he were convicted, he  would have to give up the party to which he had been invited, and he  could never hope to get another invitation.    All these reflections helped to increase Dick's unhappiness. I doubt if  he had ever felt so unhappy in all his life. But it never once occurred  to him that his arrest was brought about by the machinations of his  enemies. He hadn't chanced to see Micky Maguire, and had no suspicion  that it was he who dropped the wallet into his pocket. Still less did he  suspect that Gilbert's hostility had led him so far as to conspire with  such a boy as Micky against him. It was lucky that he did not know this,  or he would have felt still more unhappy.    But it is now time to turn to Micky Maguire and Mr. Gilbert, whose joint  scheme had met with so much success.          CHAPTER XIV.    MICKY MAGUIRE'S DISAPPOINTMENT.      Micky Maguire waited until Dick was actually on the way to the  station-house, and then started for Pearl Street to acquaint Gilbert  with the success of his machinations. His breast swelled with triumph at  the advantage he had gained over his enemy.    \"May be he'll keep his 'cheerin' reflections' to himself another time,\"  thought Micky. \"He won't have much to say about my going to the Island  when he's been there himself. They won't stand none of his airs there,  I'm thinkin'.\"    There was another pleasant aspect to the affair. Micky had not only  triumphed over his enemy, but he was going to be paid for it. This was  the stipulation between Gilbert and himself. The book-keeper had not  promised any definite sum, but Micky, in speculating upon the proper  compensation for his service, fixed upon five dollars as about what he  ought to receive. Like many others who count their chickens before they  are hatched, he had already begun to consider what he would buy with it  when he had got it.    Now, only the day previous, Micky had noticed hanging in a window in  Chatham Street, a silver watch, and chain attached, which was labelled  \"GENUINE SILVER, ONLY FIVE DOLLARS.\" Since Micky had been the  possessor of a blue coat with brass buttons, his thoughts had dwelt more  than ever before on his personal appearance, and the watch had struck his  fancy. He did not reflect much on the probable quality of a silver watch  which could be sold for five dollars, and a chain thrown into the  bargain. It was a watch, at any rate, and would make a show. Besides,  Dick wore a watch, and Micky felt that he did not wish to be outdone. As  soon as he received his reward he meant to go and buy it.    It was therefore in a very cheerful frame of mind that Micky walked up  in front of Rockwell & Cooper's store, and took his stand, occasionally  glancing at the window.    Ten minutes passed away, and still he remained unnoticed. He grew  impatient, and determined to enter, making his business an excuse.    Entering, he saw through the open door of the office, the book-keeper,  bending over the desk writing.    \"Shine yer boots?\" he asked.    Gilbert was about to answer angrily in the negative, when looking up he  recognized his young confederate. His manner changed, and he said, \"Yes,  I believe I'll have a shine; but you must be quick about it.\"    Micky swung his box from his shoulder, and, sinking upon his knees,  seized his brush, and went to work scientifically.    \"Any news?\" asked Gilbert, in a low voice.    \"Yes, mister, I've done it,\" said Micky.    \"Have you managed to trap him?\"    \"Yes, I left him on his way to the station-house.\"    \"How did you manage it?\"    \"I grabbed an old fellow's wallet, and dropped it into Dick's pocket. He  pulled it out, and while he was lookin' at it, up came the 'copp' and  nabbed him.\"    \"How about the man from whom the wallet was taken?\"    \"He came up puffin', and swore Dick was the chap that stole it.\"    \"So he was carried off to the station-house?\"    \"Yes; he's there safe enough.\"    \"Then we shall have to carry on business without him,\" said Gilbert,  coolly. \"I hope he will enjoy himself at his new quarters.\"    \"Maybe they'll send him to the Island,\" said Micky, beginning his  professional operations upon the second boot.    \"Very likely,\" said Gilbert. \"I suppose you've been there before this.\"    \"Wot if I have?\" said Micky, in rather a surly tone, for he did not  relish the allusion.    \"No offence,\" said Gilbert. \"I only meant that if you have ever been  there, you can judge whether your friend Dick will enjoy it.\"    \"Not a great deal,\" said Micky; \"but you needn't call him my friend. I  hate him.\"    \"Your enemy, then. But get through as soon as possible.\"    Micky struck his brush upon the floor to indicate that the job was  finished, and, rising, waited for his fee.    Gilbert took from his pocket ten cents and handed him.    \"That's for the shine,\" he said; \"and here's something for the other  matter.\"    So saying, he placed in the hand of the boot-black a bank-note.    Micky glanced at it, and his countenance changed ominously, when he  perceived the denomination. It was a one-dollar bill!    \"It's one dollar,\" he said.    \"Isn't that enough?\"    \"No, it isn't,\" he answered, sullenly. \"I might 'ave been nabbed myself.  I can't afford to work on no such terms.\"    Micky was right. It certainly was a very small sum to receive for taking  such a risk, apart from all moral considerations, and his  dissatisfaction can hardly be wondered at. But Gilbert was not of a  generous nature. In fact he was disposed to be mean, and in the present  instance he had even expected to get the credit of being generous. A  dollar, he thought, must seem an immense sum to a ragged boot-black. But  Micky thought differently, and Gilbert felt irritated at his  ingratitude.    \"It's all you'll get,\" said he, roughly.    \"Then you'd better get somebody else to do your dirty work next time,  mister,\" said Micky, angrily.    \"Clear out, you young blackguard!\" exclaimed Gilbert, his temper by this  time fully aroused. \"Clear out, if you don't want to be kicked out!\"    \"Maybe you'll wish you'd given me more,\" said Micky, sullenly picking up  his box, and leaving the office.    \"What's the matter?\" asked Mr. Murdock, who happened to come up just as  Micky went into the street, and heard the last words of the altercation.    \"Oh,\" said Gilbert, carelessly, \"he wasn't satisfied with his pay. I  gave him ten cents, but the young rascal wanted more.\"    As he said this, he turned back to his desk.    \"I wonder whether Gilbert's going anywhere,\" thought the head clerk. \"I  never knew him so extravagant before. He must be going out this  evening.\"    Just then it occurred to him that Dick had been absent longer than  usual, and, as he needed his services, he asked, \"Has Richard returned,  Mr. Gilbert?\"    \"I haven't seen him.\"    \"Did he go out at the usual time?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"What can have detained him?\" said Mr. Murdock, thoughtfully.    \"He's probably fallen in with some of his old friends, and forgotten all  about his duties.\"    \"That is not his way,\" said Mr. Murdock, quietly, as he walked away. He  understood very well Mr. Gilbert's hostility to Dick, and that the  latter was not likely to receive a very favorable judgment at his hands.    Five minutes later a boy entered the store, and, looking about him a  moment in uncertainty, said, \"I want to see Mr. Murdock.\"    \"I am Mr. Murdock,\" he answered.    \"Then this note is for you.\"    The clerk felt instinctively that the note was from Dick, and, not  wishing Gilbert to hear the conversation, motioned the boy to follow him  to the back part of the store.    Then he opened and read the note quickly.    \"Did Richard Hunter give this to you?\" he asked.    \"No,\" said Tim Ryan, for that was his name. \"It was the 'copp' that  arrested him.\"    \"I suppose a 'copp' is a policeman.\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"Were you present when he was arrested?\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"Do you know anything about it?\"    \"Yes, I seed it all.\"    \"You saw the wallet taken?\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"Did Richard take it?\"    \"You mean Dick?\" said Tim, interrogatively, for"]]]
