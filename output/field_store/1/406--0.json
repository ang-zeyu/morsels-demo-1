Copyright 1912  By Nephi Anderson.  All Rights Reserved.          PREFACE TO THE THIRD EDITION.      A religion, to be worth while, must give satisfactory answers to the  great questions of life: What am I? Whence came I? What is the object of  this life? and what is my destiny? True, we walk by faith, and not by  sight, but yet the eye of faith must have some light by which to see.  Added Upon is an effort to give in brief an outline of \"the scheme of  things,\" \"the ways of God to men\" as taught by the Gospel of Christ and  believed in by the Latter-day Saints; and to justify and praise these  ways, by a glance along the Great Plan, from a point in the distant past  to a point in the future--not so far away, it is to be hoped.    On subjects where little of a definite character is revealed, the story,  of necessity, could not go into great detail. It is suggestive only; but  it is hoped that the mind of the reader, illumined by the Spirit of the  Lord, will be able to fill in all the details that the heart may desire,  to wander at will in the garden of the Lord, and dwell in peace in the  mansions of the Father.    Many have told me that when they read Added Upon, it seemed to have been  written directly to them. My greatest reward is to know that the little  story has touched a sympathetic chord in the hearts of the Latter-day  Saints, and that it has brought to some aching hearts a little ray of  hope and consolation.    Nephi Anderson.    Liverpool, November 5, 1904.          PREFACE TO THE FIFTH AND ENLARGED EDITION.      This story of things past, things present, and things to come has been  before the Latter-day Saints for fourteen years. During this time, it  seems to have won for itself a place in their hearts and in their  literature. A reviewer of the book when it was first published said that  \"so great and grand a subject merits a more elaborate treatment.\" Many  since then have said the story should be \"added upon,\" and the present  enlarged edition is an attempt to meet in a small way these demands. The  truths restored to the earth through \"Mormonism\" are capable of  illimitable enlargement; and when we contemplate these glorious  teachings, we are led to exclaim with the poet:      \"Wide, and more wide, the kindling bosom swells,    As love inspires, and truth its wonders tells,    The soul enraptured tunes the sacred lyre,    And bids a worm of earth to heaven aspire,    'Mid solar systems numberless, to soar,    The death of love and science to explore.\"      N.A.      Salt Lake City, Utah,       May, 1912.          PART FIRST.        \"The Lord possessed me in the beginning of his way, before his works of    old.      \"I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning, or ever the earth    was.      \"When there were no depths, I was brought forth; when there were no    fountains abounding with water.      \"Before the mountains were settled, before the hills was I brought    forth:      \"While as yet he had not made the earth, nor the fields, nor the highest    part of the dust of the world.      \"When he prepared the heavens, I was there: when he set a compass upon    the face of the depth:      \"When he established the clouds above: when he strengthened the    fountains of the deep:      \"When he gave to the sea his decree, that the waters should not pass his    commandment: when he appointed the foundations of the earth:      \"Then I was by him, as one brought up with him: and I was daily his    delight, rejoicing always before him.\"--_Prov. 8:22-30._          ADDED UPON      \"Where was thou when I laid the foundations of the earth?...    When the morning stars sang together, and all the Sons    of God shouted for joy?\"--_Job 38:4,7._      The hosts of heaven--sons and daughters of God--were assembled. The many  voices mingling, rose and fell in one great murmur like the rising and  falling of waves about to sink to rest. Then all tumult ceased, and a  perfect silence reigned.    \"Listen,\" said one to another by his side, \"Father's will is heard.\"    A voice thrilled the multitude. It was clear as a crystal bell, and so  distinct that every ear heard, so sweet, and so full of music that every  heart within its range beat with delight.    \"And now, children of God,\" were the words, \"ye have arrived at a point  in this stage of your development where a change must needs take place.  Living, as ye have, all this time in the presence of God, and under the  control of the agencies which here exist, ye have grown from children in  knowledge to your present condition. God is pleased with you--the most  of you, and many of you have shown yourselves to be spirits of power,  whom He will make His future rulers. Ye have been taught many of the  laws of light and life, whereby the universe is created and controlled.  True, ye have not all advanced alike, or along the same lines. Some have  delighted more in the harmonies of music, while others have studied the  beauties of God's surrounding works. Each hath found pleasure and profit  in something; but there is one line of knowledge that is closed to you  all. In your present spiritual state, ye have not come in contact with  the grosser materials of existence. Your experiences have been wholly  within the compass of spiritual life, and there is a whole world of  matter, about which ye know nothing. All things have their opposites. Ye  have partly a conception of good and evil, but the many branches into  which these two principles sub-divide, cannot be understood by you.  Again, ye all have had the hope given you that at some time ye would  have the opportunity to become like unto your parents, even to attain to  a body of flesh and bones, a tabernacle with which ye may pass on to  perfection, and inherit that which God inherits. If, then, ye ever  become creators and rulers, ye must first become acquainted with the  existence of properties, laws, and organization of matter other than  that which surround you in this estate.    \"To be over all things, ye must have passed through all things, and have  had experience with them. It is now the Father's pleasure to grant you  this. Ye who continue steadfast, shall be added upon, and be permitted  to enter the second estate; and if ye abide in that, ye shall be further  increased and enlarged and be worthy of the third estate, where glory  shall be added upon your heads forever and ever.    \"Even now, out in space, rolls another world--with no definite form, and  void; but God's Spirit is there, moving upon it, and organizing the  elements. In time, it will be a fit abode for you.\"    The voice ceased. Majesty stood looking out upon the silent multitude.  Then glad hearts could contain no more, and the children of God gave a  great shout of joy. Songs of praise and gladness came from the mighty  throng, and its music echoed through the realms of heaven!    Then silence fell once more. The Voice was heard again:    \"Now, how, and upon what principles will your salvation, exaltation, and  eternal glory be brought about? It has been decided in the councils of  eternity, and I will tell you.    \"When the earth is prepared, two will be sent to begin the work of  begetting bodies for you. It needs be that a law be given these first  parents. This law will be broken, thus bringing sin into the new world.  Transgression is followed by punishment; and thus ye, when ye are born  into the world, will come in contact with misery, pain, suffering, and  death. Ye will have a field for the exercise of justice and mercy, love  and hatred. Ye will suffer, but your suffering will be the furnace  through which ye will be tested. Ye will die, and your bodies will  return to the earth again. Surrounded by earthly influences, ye will  sin. Then, how can ye return to the Father's presence, and regain your  tabernacles? Hear the plan:    \"One must be sent to the earth with power over death. He will be the  Son, the only begotten in the flesh. He must be sinless, yet bear the  sins of the world. Being slain, He will satisfy the eternal law of  justice. He will go before and bring to pass the resurrection from the  dead. He will give unto you another law, obeying which, will free you  from your personal sins, and set you again on the way of eternal life.  Thus will your agency still be yours, that ye may act in all things as  ye will.\"           *       *       *       *       *    A faint murmur ran through the assembly.    Then spoke the Father: \"Whom shall I send?\"    One arose, like unto the Father--a majestic form, meek, yet noble--the  Son; and thus he spoke:    \"Father, here am I, send me. Thy will be done, and the glory be thine  forever.\"    Then another arose. Erect and proud he stood. His eyes flashed, his lip  curled in scorn. Bold in his bearing, brilliant and influential,  Lucifer, the Son of the Morning, spoke:    \"Behold I, send me. I will be thy son, and I will redeem all mankind,  that not one soul shall be lost; and surely I will do it; wherefore,  give me thine honor.\"    Then spoke one as with authority:    \"Lucifer, thy plan would destroy the agency of man--his most priceless  gift. It would take away his means of eternal advancement. Your offer  cannot be accepted.\"    The Father looked out over the vast throng; then clearly the words rang  out:    \"I will send the first!\"    But the haughty spirit yielded not. His countenance became fiercer in  its anger, and as he strode from the assembly, many"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17253"],[0,"Dewey and Other Naval Commanders (#1)"],[1,"[Illustration: ADMIRAL GEORGE DEWEY, U.S.N.]      DEWEY    AND OTHER    NAVAL COMMANDERS.

I purpose telling you in the following pages about the exploits of the  gallant men who composed the American Navy, beginning with the  Revolution and ending with the story of their wonderful deeds in our  late war with Spain. You can never read a more interesting story, nor  one that will make you feel prouder of your birthright. While our  patriot armies have done nobly, it is none the less true that we never  could have become one of the greatest nations in the world without the  help of our heroic navy. Our warships penetrated into all waters of the  globe, and made people, whether barbarous or civilized, respect and fear  the Stars and Stripes.    This is due in a great measure to the bravery of our naval heroes, who  did not fear to meet Great Britain, the \"mistress of the seas,\" when her  navy outnumbered ours one hundred to one. England is now our best  friend, and no doubt will always remain so. Never again can there be war  between her and us, and it will not be strange that one of these days,  if either gets into trouble, the American and English soldiers will  \"drink from the same canteen,\" which is another way of saying they will  fight side by side, as they did a short time ago in Samoa. All the  same, our brethren across the ocean are very willing to own that we  fought them right well. Indeed, they think all the more of us for having  done so. You know that one brave man always likes another who is as  brave as himself, just as Northerners and Southerners love each other,  and are all united under one flag, which one side defended and the other  fought against, through long years, terrible years from 1861 to 1865.    The decks of no ships have ever been trodden by braver men than our  American sailors. There are no more heroic deeds in all history than  those of Paul Jones, Porter, Hull, Decatur, Perry, Cushing, Farragut,  Worden, Dewey, Schley, Evans, Philip, Hobson and scores of others, who  have braved what seemed certain death for the glory of our flag. Many  gave up their lives in its defence, and their names form one of the  proudest and most cherished heritages that can descend to a grateful  country.    So, I repeat, I am sure you will be interested and instructed in  learning the story of the heroes who have done so much for us; and their  example cannot fail to inspire you with loftier heroism, greater  devotion, and deeper resolve to do all you can for our favored land,  which is the fairest that ever sun shone upon.    E.S.E.          ADMIRAL GEORGE DEWEY.      CHAPTER I.    THE BIRTH AND BOYHOOD OF GEORGE DEWEY.      The name of Vermont recalls the gallant \"Green Mountain Boys,\" who  proved their sturdy patriotism not only in the Revolution, but before  those stormy days broke over the land. In the colonial times the section  was known as the \"New Hampshire Grants,\" and was claimed by both New  York and New Hampshire, but Vermont refused to acknowledge the authority  of either, even after New York, in 1764, secured a decision in her favor  from King George, and set vigorously to work to compel the settlers to  pay a second time for their lands. The doughty pioneers would have none  of it, and roughly handled the New York officers sent thither. In 1777  Vermont formally declared her independence and adopted a State  constitution. Then, since the Revolution was on, Ethan Allen and the  rest of the \"Green Mountain Boys\" turned in and helped whip the  redcoats. That being done, Vermont again asserted her independence,  compelled New York to recognize it in 1789, and she was admitted to the  Union in 1791.    It was away back in 1633 that the first Englishman bearing the name of  Dewey arrived in Massachusetts with a number of other emigrants. They  settled in Dorchester, and in 1636 Thomas Dewey, as he was named,  removed to Windsor, Connecticut, where he died in 1648, leaving a widow  and five children. Following down the family line, we come to the birth  of Julius Yemans Dewey, August 22, 1801, at Berlin, Vermont. He studied  medicine, practiced his profession at Montpelier, the capital, and  became one of the"]]]
