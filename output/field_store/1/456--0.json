AND RICHTER,  30, SOHO-SQUARE.    1825.    [Illustration: Portrait of Napoleon]          TO THE    VETERANS OF THE GRAND ARMY.      COMRADES,    I have undertaken the task of tracing the History of the Grand Army and  its Leader during the year 1812. I address it to such of you as the ices  of the North have disarmed, and who can no longer serve their country,  but by the recollections of their misfortunes and their glory. Stopped  short in your noble career, your existence is much more in the past than  in the present; but when the recollections are so great, it is allowable  to live solely on them. I am not afraid, therefore, of troubling that  repose which you have so dearly purchased, by placing before you the  most fatal of your deeds of arms. Who is there of us but knows, that  from the depth of his obscurity the looks of the fallen man are  involuntarily directed towards the splendor of his past existence--even  when its light illuminates the shoal on which the bark of his fortune  struck, and when it displays the fragments of the greatest of  shipwrecks?           *       *       *       *       *    For myself, I will own, that an irresistible feeling carries me back  incessantly to that disastrous epoch of our public and private  calamities. My memory feels a sort of melancholy pleasure in  contemplating and renewing the painful traces which so many horrors have  left in it. Is the soul, also, proud of her deep and numerous wounds?  Does she delight in displaying them? Are they a property of which she  has reason to be proud? Is it rather, that after the desire of knowing  them, her first wish is to impart her sensations? To feel, and to excite  feeling, are not these the most powerful springs of our soul?           *       *       *       *       *    But in short, whatever may be the cause of the sentiment which actuates  me, I have yielded to the desire of retracing the various sensations  which I experienced during that fatal war. I have employed my leisure  hours in separating, arranging, and combining with method my scattered  and confused recollections. Comrades! I also invoke yours! Suffer not  such great remembrances, which have been so dearly purchased, to be  lost; for us they are the only property which the past leaves to the  future. Single, against so many enemies, ye fell with greater glory than  they rose. Learn, then, that there was no shame in being vanquished!  Raise once more those noble fronts, which have been furrowed with all  the thunders of Europe! Cast not down those eyes, which have seen so  many subject capitals, so many vanquished kings! Fortune, doubtless,  owed you a more glorious repose; but, such as it is, it depends on  yourselves to make a noble use of it. Let history inscribe your  recollections. The solitude and silence of misfortune are propitious to  her labours; and let truth, which is always present in the long nights  of adversity, at last enlighten labours that may not prove unproductive.    As for me, I will avail myself of the privilege, sometimes painful,  sometimes glorious, of telling what I have seen, and of retracing,  perhaps with too scrupulous attention, its most minute details; feeling  that nothing was too minute in that prodigious Genius and those gigantic  feats, without which we should never have known the extent to which  human strength, glory, and misfortune, may be carried.

D.H.M.  TO  S.K.K.          PREFATORY NOTE.    This little book is intended by the writer as an introduction to his  larger work entitled _The Leading Facts of American History_.    It is in no sense an abridgment of the larger history, but is  practically an entirely new and distinct work.    Its object is to present clearly and accurately those facts and  principles in the lives of some of the chief founders and builders  of America which would be of interest and value to pupils beginning  the study of our history. Throughout the book great care has been  taken to relate only such incidents and anecdotes as are believed  to rest on unexceptionable authority.    The numerous illustrations in the text are, in nearly every case,  from drawings and designs made by Miss C. S. King of Boston.    In the preparation of this work for the press--as in that of the  entire _Leading Facts of History Series_--the author has been  especially indebted to the valuable assistance rendered in  proofreading by Mr. George W. Cushing of Boston.    DAVID H. MONTGOMERY,  CAMBRIDGE, MASS.          CONTENTS.                                             PARAGRAPH       I. COLUMBUS . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .   1      II.

Birth and boyhood of Columbus.--Christopher Columbus,[2] the  discoverer of America, was born at Genoa,[3] a seaport of Italy, more  than four hundred and fifty years ago. His father was a  wool-comber.[4] Christopher did not care to learn that trade, but  wanted to become a sailor. Seeing the boy's strong liking for the  sea, his father sent him to a school where he could learn geography,  map-drawing, and whatever else might help him to become some day  commander of a vessel.    [Illustration: COLUMBUS AS A BOY. (From the statue in the Museum of  Fine Arts, Boston.)]    [Footnote 1: These enclosed dates under a name show, except when  otherwise stated, the year of birth and death.]    [Footnote 2: Christopher Columbus (Kris'tof-er Ko-lum'bus).]    [Footnote 3: Genoa (Jen'o-ah); see map in paragraph 21.]    [Footnote 4: Wool-comber: before wool can be spun into thread and  woven into cloth the tangled locks must be combed out straight and  smooth; once this was all done by hand.]      2. Columbus becomes a sailor.--When he was fourteen Columbus went  to sea. In those days the Mediterranean[5] Sea swarmed with war-ships  and pirates. Every sailor, no matter if he was but a boy, had to stand  ready to fight his way from port to port.    In this exciting life, full of adventure and of danger, Columbus grew  to manhood. The rough experiences he then had did much toward making  him the brave, determined captain and explorer[6] that he afterwards  became.    [Footnote 5: Mediterranean (Med'i-ter-ra'ne-an).]    [Footnote 6: Explorer: one who explores or discovers new countries.]      3. Columbus has a sea-fight; he goes to Lisbon.--According to some  accounts, Columbus once had a desperate battle with a vessel off the  coast of Portugal. The fight lasted, it is said, all day. At length  both vessels were found to be on fire. Columbus jumped from his  blazing ship into the sea, and catching hold of a floating oar,  managed, with its help, to swim to the shore, about six miles away.    He then went to the port of Lisbon.[7] There he married the daughter  of a famous sea-captain. For a long time after his marriage Columbus  earned his living partly by drawing maps, which he sold to commanders  of vessels visiting Lisbon, and partly by making voyages to Africa,  Iceland, and other countries.    [Footnote 7: Lisbon: see map in paragraph 21.]      4. What men then knew about the world.--The maps which Columbus made  and sold were very different from those we now have. At that time  not half of the world had been discovered.[8] Europe, Asia, and a  small part of Africa were the chief countries known. The maps of  Columbus may have shown the earth shaped like a ball, but he supposed  it to be much smaller than it really is. No one then had sailed round  the globe. No one then knew what lands lay west of the broad Atlantic;  for this reason we should look in vain, on one of the maps drawn by  Columbus, for the great continents of North and South America or for  Australia or the Pacific Ocean.    [Illustration: The light parts of this map show how much of the world  was then well-known; the white crosses show those countries of  Eastern Asia of which something was known.]    [Footnote 8: See map in this paragraph.]      5. The plan of Columbus for reaching the Indies by sailing  west.--While living in Lisbon, Columbus made up his mind to try to  do what no other man, at that time, dared attempt,--that was to cross  the Atlantic Ocean. He thought that by doing so he could get directly  to Asia and the Indies, which, he believed, were opposite Portugal  and Spain. If successful, he could open up a very profitable trade  with the rich countries of the East, from which spices, drugs, and  silk were brought to Europe. The people of Europe could not reach  those countries directly by ships, because they had not then found  their way round the southern point of Africa.
