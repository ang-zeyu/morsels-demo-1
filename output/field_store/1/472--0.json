In the world of creatures, as in the  world of men, the story precedes and outlives history. There are many  instances of the fact that if an insect attract our attention for this  reason or that, it is given a place in those legends of the people whose  last care is truth.    For example, who is there that does not, at least by hearsay, know the  Cigale? Where in the entomological world shall we find a more famous  reputation? Her fame as an impassioned singer, careless of the future,  was the subject of our earliest lessons in repetition. In short, easily  remembered lines of verse, we learned how she was destitute when the  winter winds arrived, and how she went begging for food to the Ant, her  neighbour. A poor welcome she received, the would-be borrower!--a  welcome that has become proverbial, and her chief title to celebrity.  The petty malice of the two short lines--      Vous chantiez! j'en suis bien aise,    Eh bien, dansez maintenant!    has done more to immortalise the insect than her skill as a musician.  \"You sang! I am very glad to hear it! Now you can dance!\" The words  lodge in the childish memory, never to be forgotten. To most  Englishmen--to most Frenchmen even--the song of the Cigale is unknown,  for she dwells in the country of the olive-tree; but we all know of the  treatment she received at the hands of the Ant. On such trifles does  Fame depend! A legend of very dubious value, its moral as bad as its  natural history; a nurse's tale whose only merit is its brevity; such is  the basis of a reputation which will survive the wreck of centuries no  less surely than the tale of Puss-in-Boots and of Little Red  Riding-Hood.    The child is the best guardian of tradition, the great conservative.  Custom and tradition become indestructible when confided to the archives  of his memory. To the child we owe the celebrity of the Cigale, of whose  misfortunes he has babbled during his first lessons in recitation. It is  he who will preserve for future generations the absurd nonsense of which  the body of the fable is constructed; the Cigale will always be hungry  when the cold comes, although there were never Cigales in winter; she  will always beg alms in the shape of a few grains of wheat, a diet  absolutely incompatible with her delicate capillary \"tongue\"; and in  desperation she will hunt for flies and grubs, although she never eats.    Whom shall we hold responsible for these strange mistakes? La Fontaine,  who in most of his fables charms us with his exquisite fineness of  observation, has here been ill-inspired. His earlier subjects he knew  down to the ground: the Fox, the Wolf, the Cat, the Stag, the Crow, the  Rat, the Ferret, and so many others, whose actions and manners he  describes with a delightful precision of detail. These are inhabitants  of his own country; neighbours, fellow-parishioners. Their life, private  and public, is lived under his eyes; but the Cigale is a stranger to the  haunts of Jack Rabbit. La Fontaine had never seen nor heard her. For him  the celebrated songstress was certainly a grasshopper.    Grandville, whose pencil rivals the author's pen, has fallen into the  same error. In his illustration to the fable we see the Ant dressed like  a busy housewife. On her threshold, beside her full sacks of wheat, she  disdainfully turns her back upon the would-be borrower, who holds out  her claw--pardon, her hand. With a wide coachman's hat, a guitar under  her arm, and a skirt wrapped about her knees by the gale, there stands  the second personage of the fable, the perfect portrait of a  grasshopper. Grandville knew no more than La Fontaine of the true  Cigale; he has beautifully expressed the general confusion.    But La Fontaine, in this abbreviated history, is only the echo of  another fabulist. The legend of the Cigale and the cold welcome of the  Ant is as old as selfishness: as old as the world. The children of  Athens, going to school with their baskets of rush-work stuffed with  figs and olives, were already repeating the story under their breath, as  a lesson to be repeated to the teacher. \"In winter,\" they used to say,  \"the Ants were putting their damp food to dry in the sun. There came a  starving Cigale to beg from them. She begged for a few grains. The  greedy misers replied: 'You sang in the summer,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18362"],[0,"Fifteen Thousand Useful Phrases (#1)"],[1,"[Transcriber's Notes]  Original \"misspellings\" such as \"fulness\" are unchanged.

MISCELLANEOUS PHRASES        INTRODUCTION    The most powerful and the most perfect expression of thought and feeling  through the medium of oral language must be traced to the mastery of  words. Nothing is better suited to lead speakers and readers of English  into an easy control of this language than the command of the phrase that  perfectly expresses the thought. Every speaker's aim is to be heard and  understood. A clear, crisp articulation holds an audience as by the spell  of some irresistible power. The choice word, the correct phrase, are  instruments that may reach the heart, and awake the soul if they fall upon  the ear in melodious cadence; but if the utterance be harsh and discordant  they fail to interest, fall upon deaf ears, and are as barren as seed sown  on fallow ground. In language, nothing conduces so emphatically to the  harmony of sounds as perfect phrasing--that is, the emphasizing of the  relation of clause to clause, and of sentence to sentence by the  systematic grouping of words. The phrase consists usually of a few words  which denote a single idea that forms a separate part of a sentence. In  this respect it differs from the clause, which is a short sentence that  forms a distinct part of a composition, paragraph, or discourse. Correct  phrasing is regulated by rests, such rests as do not break the continuity  of a thought or the progress of the sense.    GRENVILLE KLEISER, who has devoted years of his diligent life to imparting  the art of correct expression in speech and writing, has provided many  aids for those who would know not merely what to say, but how to say it.  He has taught also what the great HOLMES taught, that language is a temple  in which the human soul is enshrined, and that it grows out of life--out  of its joys and its sorrows, its burdens and its necessities. To him, as  well as to the writer, the deep strong voice of man and the low sweet  voice of woman are never heard at finer advantage than in the earnest but  mellow tones of familiar speech. In the present volume Mr. Kleiser  furnishes an additional and an exceptional aid for those who would have a  mint of phrases at their command from which to draw when in need of the  golden mean for expressing thought. Few indeed are the books fitted to-day  for the purpose of imparting this knowledge, yet two centuries ago  phrase-books were esteemed as supplements to the dictionaries, and have  not by any manner of means lost their value. The guide to familiar  quotations, the index to similes, the grammars, the readers, the  machine-made letter-writer of mechanically perfect letters of  congratulation or condolence--none are sententious enough to supply the  need. By the compilation of this praxis, Mr. Kleiser has not only supplied  it, but has furnished a means for the increase of one's vocabulary by  practical methods. There are thousands of persons who may profit by the  systematic study of such a book as this if they will familiarize  themselves with the author's purpose by a careful reading of the  preliminary pages of his book. To speak in public pleasingly and readily  and to read well are accomplishments acquired only after many days, weeks  even, of practise.    Foreigners sometimes reproach us for the asperity and discordance of our  speech, and in general, this reproach is just, for there are many persons  who do scanty justice to the vowel-elements of our language. Although  these elements constitute its music they are continually mistreated. We  flirt with and pirouette around them constantly. If it were not so,  English would be found full of beauty and harmony of sound. Familiar with  the maxim, \"Take care of the vowels and the consonants will take care of  themselves,\"--a maxim that when put into practise has frequently led to  the breaking-down of vowel values--the writer feels that the common custom  of allowing \"the consonants to take care of themselves\" is pernicious. It  leads to suppression or to imperfect utterance, and thus produces  indistinct"]]]
