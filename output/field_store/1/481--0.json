MIGUEL SADERRA MASO, S. J.    ASSISTANT DIRECTOR OF THE WEATHER BUREAU    MANILA  BUREAU OF PRINTING  1910          CATALOGUE OF VIOLENT AND DESTRUCTIVE EARTHQUAKES IN THE PHILIPPINES  (1599-1909).      Introduction.--The occasion for publishing this catalogue of  Philippine earthquakes which were of violent and destructive character  has been furnished by a request from Prof. John Milne for a list of  such phenomena, to be included in the General Earthquake Catalogue  which this eminent seismologist is preparing under the auspices of the  British Association for the Advancement of Science. The said general  catalogue has been undertaken with a view toward reducing to  uniformity and completing those published years ago by Robert Mallet  (1859) and Perrey (1844-1871). The form adopted for Professor Milne's  new catalogue is very concise, comprising only the date, intensity,  and region together with principal localities affected. It will  contain only the earthquakes of intensities VII to X according to the  scale of De Rossi-Forel, and these will be divided into three classes:  Class I will be formed by the earthquakes of sufficient force to  produce cracks in buildings and to throw down chimneys; they  correspond to force VII of De Rossi-Forel. Class II consists of the  earthquakes which not only threw down chimneys but also walls and some  weak structures; force VIII of De Rossi-Forel. Class III comprises the  earthquakes which caused general destruction; force IX and X of De  Rossi-Forel. As this classification is as purely conventional as every  other and adopted only in the catalogue mentioned, we do not employ it  in the present catalogue of Philippine earthquakes, but retain the  almost universally adopted scale of De Rossi-Forel. We shall also  present more details as to the towns and buildings damaged, the number  of victims and other disastrous effects than enter into the catalogue  of Professor Milne.    Hence, the differences between the list prepared for Professor Milne  as well as the partial catalogue published in our Monthly Bulletin for  February of the present year consist in the following: (1) This  catalogue contains also several earthquakes whose intensities were  between VI and VII, while in the former only such figure as according  to their effects were decidedly of force VII. (2) The new catalogue is  more complete as to details concerning the towns, etc., which have  been destroyed.    It is to be regretted that we are unable to present here a complete  historical catalogue of all the destruction wrought in the Archipelago  by earthquakes since the time when Legaspi and Urdaneta first set foot  on these shores. But the old chroniclers, who dwell upon the political  happenings with an attention to detail which is occasionally overdone,  were invariably laconic when there was question of earthquakes and  similar natural phenomena; as a rule they were satisfied with  mentioning the occurrence in a general and therefore vague way,  without any attempt at precision as to dates and places. Still the  writers in the Philippines did nothing worse than imitate their  colleagues throughout the rest of the world. This fact is responsible  for the great contrast exhibited by our catalogue as regards the  number and details of earthquakes which occurred prior to 1800,  records of which have been preserved, and the same data for the period  from 1800 to the present time. This same difference is observable in  all catalogues of a similar nature, even in those which cover  phenomena which occurred in Europe. As to the Philippine writers, an  additional excuse is found in the peculiar conditions of life in these  Islands. As far as we know, only two earthquakes which took place  during the period which alone can come under consideration--that is,  since the discovery of the Archipelago--have claimed a considerable  number of victims, and these in the capital, because outside of  Manila--if we except two or three of the principal cities--the  buildings which could become dangerous during an earthquake have  always been few.    Moreover, in a country in which fires consume every year thousands of  dwellings and where the terrible typhoons frequently destroy whole  towns with heavy loss of lives, the damage done by earthquakes has  rarely been so great as to impress those occurrences indelibly upon  the memory. This is beyond doubt one of the reasons why prior to the  beginning of the nineteenth century hardly any data can be found  concerning the numerous earthquakes which during the preceding two  centuries must have occurred in the Visayas and above all on the large  Island of Mindanao.    The first earthquake of which the chronicles contain a mention is that  of 1599. There is no reasonable doubt that during the twenty-eight  years which had then elapsed since the founding of Manila by Legaspi,  several strong and possibly even destructive earthquakes occurred in  this part of Luzon Island, but, as the author of the \"Verdadera  relacion de la grande destruccion * * * del ano 1645\" tells us, \"when  first founded, Manila consisted of wooden houses roofed with a certain  kind of palm leaves, the same which the natives use in their  buildings.\" Hence the damage done by these earthquakes must have been  insignificant. Much more terrible were the losses caused by  conflagrations which within a few years twice wiped out the entire  city.    The first Bishop of Manila, Domingo de Salazar, seeing the city  exposed to such general destructions by fire like the one of February  14, 1583, gave the first impulse to the construction of stone  buildings and worked indefatigably in this direction. In person he  explored the surroundings of Manila in quest of stone quarries and by  the middle of the year 1591 he had nearly finished his palace and the  cathedral, when financial difficulties caused a temporary suspension  of the work. At the same time a great number of public and private  buildings were under construction. The enthusiasm for structures of  stone or brick with tile roofs did not diminish during the next fifty  years. The chroniclers tell us that \"the Spaniards began to build  their houses of stone and tiles without the so necessary precautions  against earthquakes. * * * Beautiful structures and dwelling houses  were reared, so high and spacious that they resembled palaces;  magnificent churches with lofty and graceful towers, within the walls  of Manila as well as outside of them: all of which made the city very  beautiful and gay and contributed equally to health and pleasure.\" The  disaster of 1645, commonly called the earthquake of St. Andrew, as it  occurred on the feast of this apostle, November 30, razed nearly every  one of these buildings to the ground, and since then the style and  appearance of buildings has changed greatly throughout the  Archipelago, with a correspondingly great saving of lives in the  subsequent earthquakes.    Masonry arches were henceforth banished from the churches; the heavy  walls of the latter were further strengthened by massive buttresses;  and the towers were given truly enormous substructures. But even with  these precautions there is at present hardly one out of the hundreds  of churches built during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries  which did not some time or other require important repairs of its  masonry work or even partial reconstruction owing to earthquake  damages. The only structure of this class which thus far has withstood  all convulsions, is the church of St. Agustin, Manila. Nevertheless,  as we have stated before, the chroniclers hardly mention all this  destruction, except in a very general and cursory manner. I do not  hesitate to say: they were accustomed to see similar havoc created  nearly every year in one part of the Archipelago or the other by some  severe typhoon, accompanied by far greater loss of lives and property,  and consequently much more felt by the people than the destruction of  a church, _convento_, municipal building (\"tribunal\"), one or two  bridges, or other masonry structure.    In the present catalogue our aim has been to present all that is known  of the various violent and destructive earthquakes on record. The  first column of each page contains the ordinal number of the  disturbance for purposes of reference. In the second, the date is  given as accurately as it could be ascertained, Roman numerals being  used to designate the months. Unfortunately, of some earthquakes only  the year is known; of others, the year and month. Of one (No. 32) the  approximate hour has been recorded, but not the day of the month;  while of another (No. 38) the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18560"],[0,"Chopin and Other Musical Essays (#1)"],[1,"*       *       *       *       *        +--------------------------------------------------------------+      | Transcriber's Note:                                          |      |                                                              |      | A number of obvious typographical errors have been corrected |      | in this text, while archaic spelling has been maintained.    |      | For a complete list, please see the bottom of this document. |      |                                                              |      +--------------------------------------------------------------+           *       *       *       *       *        CHOPIN    AND    OTHER MUSICAL ESSAYS            BY THE SAME AUTHOR.

I do  not know how much of this sum is to be placed to the account of  Chopin, but a leading music dealer in New York told me that he sold  three times as many of Chopin's compositions as of any other romantic  or classical composer. This seems to indicate that Chopin is popular.  Nevertheless, I believe that what Liszt wrote in 1850, a year after  the death of Chopin--that his fame was not yet as great as it would be  in the future--is as true to-day as it was forty years ago. Chopin's  reputation has been constantly growing, and yet many of his deepest  and most poetic compositions are almost unknown to amateurs, not to  speak of the public at large. A few of his least characteristic pieces  are heard in every parlor, generally in a wofully mutilated condition,  but some of his most inspired later works I have never heard played  either in private or in the concert hall, although I am sure that if  heard there they would be warmly applauded.    There is hardly a composer concerning whom so many erroneous notions  are current as concerning Chopin, and of all the histories of music I  have seen that of Langhans is the only one which devotes to Chopin an  amount of space approximately proportionate to his importance. One of  the most absurd of the misconceptions is that Chopin's genius was born  in full armor, and that it did not pass through several stages of  development, like that of other composers. Chopin did display  remarkable originality at the very beginning, but the apparent  maturity of his first published works is due to the fact that he  destroyed his earliest efforts and disowned those works which are  known as posthumous, and which may have created confusion in some  minds by having received a higher \"opus\" number than his last works.    Another misconception regarding Chopin is that his latest works are  morbid and unintelligible. The same charge was brought by philistines  against the best works of Beethoven, Schumann, and Wagner. The fact is  that these last works are of an almost matchless harmonic depth and  originality, as superior to his earlier works as Wagner's last music  dramas are to his first operas. I make this comparison with Wagner  advisedly because, although I have the most exalted notions of  Wagner's grandeur and importance, I do not for a moment hesitate to  say that in his own sphere Chopin is quite as original and has been  almost as revolutionary and epoch-making as Wagner. Schumann was the  first to recognize the revolutionary significance of Chopin's style.  \"Chopin's works,\" he says, \"are cannons buried in flowers;\" and in  another place he declares that he can see in \"Chopin's G minor  Nocturne a terrible declaration of war against a whole musical past.\"  Chopin, himself, modest as he was in his manners, wrote to his teacher  Elsner, in 1831, when he was twenty-two years of age: \"Kalkbrenner  will not be able to break my perhaps bold but noble determination to  create a new epoch in art.\"    Now, why has the world been so slow in recognizing that Chopin stands  in the very front rank of creative musicians? One reason doubtless is  that he was so quiet and retiring in his personal disposition. His  still, small voice was lost in the din of musical warfare. He warmly  defended the principles of the romantic school, if necessary, and had  decided opinions of other musicians, especially of the popular  pianists of his day who vitiated the public taste with their show  pieces; but he generally kept them to himself or confided them only to  his friends, whom he even occasionally implored to keep them secret.  Had he, like Richard Wagner, attacked everybody, right and left, who  stood in the way of the general recognition of his genius, his cause  would have doubtless assumed greater prominence in the eyes of the  public, even though the parlor piano does not afford so much  play-ground for warfare as the operatic stage.    The chief reason, however, why musical authorities have so long  hesitated to acknowledge that Chopin is one of the very greatest  explorers and pioneers in the domain of their art, is to be found in  what, for want of a better term, may be called aesthetic Jumboism. When  the late lamented Jumbo was in New York he attracted so much attention  that his colleagues, although but little inferior in size, had \"no  show\" whatever. Everybody crowded around Jumbo, stuffing him with  bushels of oranges and apples, while the other elephants were entirely  ignored. As elephants are intelligent animals, is it not probable that  Pilot, the next in size to Jumbo, went mad and had to be shot because  he was jealous of the exclusive attentions bestowed on his rival? In  aesthetics, this Jumboism, this exaggerated desire for mammoth  dimensions, seems to be a trait of the human mind which it is  difficult to eradicate. It is a suggestive fact that the morbid, sham  aestheticism which prevailed in England a few years ago, chose for its  symbol the uncouth sunflower. And many who know that a sunflower is  less beautiful and fragrant than a violet, will nevertheless, on  visiting a picture gallery, give most of their attention to the large  canvases, though the smaller ones may be infinitely more beautiful. It  cannot be said that the critics of art or literature follow the  popular disposition to measure genius with a yard-stick; but in music  there seems to be a general tendency to do this. Liszt remarks,  apropos, in his work on Chopin: \"The value of the sketches made by  Chopin's extremely delicate pencil has not yet been acknowledged and  emphasized sufficiently. It has become customary in our days to regard  as great composers only those who have written at least half a dozen  operas, as many oratorios, and several symphonies.\"    Even Schumann, and Elsner, Chopin's teacher, seem to have been  affected a little by this irrational way of looking at music.  Schumann, in a complimentary notice of Chopin's nocturnes, expresses  his regrets that the composer should confine himself so strictly to  the pianoforte, whereas he might have influenced the development of  music in all its branches. He adds, however, on second thought, that  \"to be a poet one need not have written ponderous volumes; one or two  poems suffice to make a reputation, and Chopin has written such.\"  Elsner who was unusually liberal in his views of art, and who  discovered and valued his pupil's originality long before Schumann  did, nevertheless bowed before the fetish of Jumboism in so far as to  write to Chopin in Paris that he was anxious, before he departed this  Vale of Tears, to hear an opera from his pen, both for his benefit,  and for the glory of his country. Chopin took this admonition to heart  sufficiently to ask a friend to prepare for him a libretto; but that  is as far as the project ever went. Chopin must have felt  instinctively that his individual style of miniature painting would be  as ineffective on the operatic stage, where bold, _al fresco_ painting  is required, as his soft and dreamy playing would have been had he  taken his piano from the parlor and placed it in a meadow.    Besides Chopin's abhorrence of musical warfare and his avoidance of  the larger and more imposing forms of the opera, symphony, and  oratorio, there were other causes which retarded the recognition of  his transcendent genius. The unprecedented originality of his style,  and the distinct national coloring of his compositions, did not meet  with a sympathetic appreciation in Germany and Vienna, when he first  went there to test his musical powers. Some of the papers indeed had a  good word for him, but, as in the case of Liszt and later of  Rubinstein, it was rather for the pianist than for the composer. On  his first visit to Vienna he was greatly petted, and he found it easy  to get influential friends who took care that his concerts should be  a success, because he played for their benefit, asking no pecuniary  recompense. But when, some years "]]]
