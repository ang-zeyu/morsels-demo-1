It seems to have been part of his kingcraft to give the  offices of greatest trust to men of low birth, who were at the same time  well aware that they owed their employments to their seeming want of  ambition. Thus the government of Egypt, the greatest and richest of the  provinces, was given to Cornelius Gallus.    Before the fall of the republic the senate had given the command of the  provinces to members of their own body only; and therefore Augustus, not  wishing to alter the law, obtained from the senate for himself all those  governments which he meant to give to men of lower rank. By this legal  fiction, these equestrian prefects were answerable for their conduct to  nobody but the emperor on a petition, and they could not be sued at law  before the senate for their misdeeds. But he made an exception in the  case of Egypt. While on the one hand in that province he gave to the  prefect's edicts the force of law, on the other he allowed him to be  cited before the senate, though appointed by himself. The power thus  given to the senate they never ventured to use, and the prefect of Egypt  was never punished or removed but by the emperor. Under the prefect was  the chief justice of the province, who heard himself, or by deputy, all  causes except those which were reserved for the decision of the emperor  in person. These last were decided by a second judge, or in modern  language a chancellor, as they were too numerous and too trifling to be  taken to Rome. Under these judges were numerous freedmen of the emperor,  and clerks entrusted with affairs of greater and less weight. Of the  native magistrates the chief were the keeper of the records, the police  judge, the prefect of the night, and the _Exegetes_, or interpreter of  the Egyptian law, who was allowed to wear a purple robe like a Roman  magistrate. But these Egyptian magistrates were never treated as  citizens; they were barbarians, little better than slaves, and only  raised to the rank of the emperor's freedmen.    Augustus showed not a little jealousy in the rest of the laws by which  his new province was to be governed. While other conquered cities  usually had a senate or municipal form of government granted to them,  no city in Egypt was allowed that privilege, which, by teaching the  citizens the art of governing themselves and the advantages of union,  might have made them less at the mercy of their masters. He not only  gave the command of the kingdom to a man below the rank of a senator,  but ordered that no senator should even be allowed to set foot in Egypt  without leave from himself; and centuries later, when the weakness of  the country had led the emperors to soften some of the other stern laws  of Augustus, this was still strictly enforced.    Among other changes then brought in by the Romans was the use of a fixed  year in all civil reckonings. The Egyptians, for all the common purposes  of life, called the day of the heliacal rising of the dogstar, about our  18th of July, their new year's day, and the husbandman marked it with  religious ceremonies as the time when the Nile began to overflow; while  for all civil purposes, and dates of kings' reigns, they used a year of  three hundred and sixty-five days, which, of course, had a movable  new year's day. But by the orders of Augustus all public deeds were  henceforth dated by the new year of three hundred and sixty-five days  and a quarter, which was named, after Julius Caesar, the Julian year. The  years from B.C. 24 were made to begin on the 29th of August, the day  on which the movable new year's day then happened to fall, and were  numbered from the year following the last of Cleopatra, as from the  first year of the reign of Augustus. But notwithstanding the many  advantages of the Julian year, which was used throughout Europe for  sixteen centuries, till its faultiness was pointed out by Pope Gregory  XIII., the Egyptian astronomers and mathematicians distrusted it from  the first, and chose to stick to their old year, in which there could  be no mistake about its length. Thus there were at the same time three  years and three new year's days in use in Egypt: one about the 18th  of July, used by the common people; one on the 29th of August, used by  order of the emperor; and one movable, used by the astronomers.    By the conquest of Egypt, Augustus was also able to extend another of  the plans of his late uncle. Julius Caesar, whose powerful mind found all  sciences within its grasp, had ordered a survey to be taken of the whole  of the Roman provinces, and the length of all the roads to be measured  for the use of the tax-gatherers and of the army; and Augustus was  now able to add Egypt to the survey. Polyclitus was employed on this  southern portion of the empire; and, after thirty-two years from its  beginning by Julius, the measurement of nearly the whole known world was  finished and reported to the senate.    At Alexandria Augustus was visited by Herod, who hastened to beg of  him those portions of his kingdom which Antony had given to Cleopatra.  Augustus received him as a friend; gave him back the territory which  Antony had taken from him, and added the province of Samaria and the  free cities on the coast. He also gave to him the body of four hundred  Gauls, who formed part of the Egyptian army and had been Cleopatra's  bodyguard. He thus removed from Alexandria the last remains of the  Gallic mercenaries, of whom the Ptolemies had usually had a troop in  their service.    [Illustration: 007.jpg PLAN OF ALEXANDRIA]    Augustus visited the royal burial-place to see the body of Alexander,  and devoutly added a golden crown and a garland of flowers to the other  ornaments on the sarcophagus of the Macedonian. But he would take no  pains to please either the Alexandrians or Egyptians; he despised them  both. When asked if he would not like to see the Alexandrian monarchs  lying in their mummy-cases in the same tomb, he answered: \"No, I came to  see the king, not dead men,\" His contempt for Cleopatra and her father  made him forget the great qualities of Ptolemy Soter. So when he was  at Memphis he refused to humour the national prejudice of two thousand  years' standing by visiting the bull Apis.

That such ideal reasons should be attributed to a war like  the Crusades, of a wide and far-reaching influence on the political and  intellectual development of mediaeval Europe, is not at all surprising.  In the history of humanity there have been few wars in which the  combatants on both sides were not convinced that they had drawn their  swords for some noble purpose, for the cause of right and justice. That  the motives prompting the vast display of arms witnessed during the  Crusades, that the wanderings of those crowds to the East during two  centuries, and the cruelties committed by the saintly warriors on their  way to the Holy Sepulchre, should be attributed exclusively to ideal  and religious sources is therefore quite natural. It is not to be  denied that there was a religious factor in the Crusades; but that the  religious motive was not the sole incentive has now been agreed upon  by impartial historians; and in so far as the motives animating the  Crusaders were religious motives, we are to look to powerful influences  which gradually made themselves felt from without the ecclesiastical  organisations. It was by no means a movement which the Church alone had  called into being. On the contrary, only when the movement had grown  ripe did Gregory VII. hasten to take steps to enable the Church to  control it. The idea of a Crusade for the glory of religion had not  sprung from the tenets of Christianity; it was given to mediaeval Europe  by the Muhammedans.    History can hardly boast of another example of so gigantic a conquest  during so short a period as that gained by the first adherents of Islam.  Like the fiery wind of the desert, they had broken from their retreats,  animated by the promises of the Prophet, and spread the new doctrine far  and wide. In 653 the scimitar of the Saracens enclosed an area as large  as the Roman Empire under the Caesars. Barely forty years elapsed after  the death of the Prophet when the armies of Islam reached the Atlantic.  Okba, the wild and gallant leader, rode into the sea on the western  shore of Africa, and, whilst the seething waves reached to the saddle  of his camel, he exclaimed: \"Allah, I call thee as witness that I should  have carried the knowledge of Thy name still farther, if these waves  threatening to swallow me would not have prevented me from doing so.\"  Not long after this, the flag of the crescent was waving from the  Pyrenees to the Chinese mountains. In 711 the Saracens under General  Tarik crossed the straits between the Mediterranean and the Atlantic,  and landed on the rock which has since been called after him, \"the hill  of Tarik,\" Jebel el-Tarik or Gibraltar. Spain was invaded and captured  by the Moslems. For awhile it seemed as if on the other side of the  Garonne the crescent would also supplant the cross, and only the victory  of Charles Martel in 732 put a stop to the wave of Muhammedan conquest.    Thus in a brief period Muhammedanism spread from the Nile Valley to the  Mediterranean. Muhammed's trenchant argument was the sword. He gave a  distinct command to his followers to convince the infidels of the  Power of truth on the battle-field. \"The sword is a surer argument than  books,\" he said. Accordingly the Koran ordered war against unbelievers:  \"The sword is the key to heaven and hell; a drop of blood shed in the  cause of Allah, a night spent in arms, is of more avail than two months  of fasting and prayer; whoever falls in battle, his sins are forgiven,  and at the day of judgment his limbs shall be supplied with the wings  of angels and cherubim.\" Before the battle commenced, the commanders  reminded the warriors of the beautiful celestial houris who awaited the  heroes slain in battle at the gates of Paradise.    The first efforts having been crowned with success, the Moslems soon  became convinced of the fulfilment of the prophecy that Allah had given  them the world and wished them to subdue all unbelievers. Under the  Caliph Omar, the Arabs had become a religious-political community of  warriors, whose mission it was to conquer and plunder all civilised and  cultured lands and to unfurl the banner of the crescent. They believed  that \"Paradise is under the shadow of the sword.\" In this belief the  followers of Muhammed engaged in battle without fear or anxiety, spurred  to great deeds, reckless in the face of danger, happy to die and pass  to the delights of Paradise. The \"holy war\" became an armed propaganda  pleasing to Allah. It was, however, a form of propaganda quite unknown  and amazing to Christendom. In the course of two centuries the crescent  had supplanted the cross. Of what avail was the peaceful missionary's  preaching if province after province and country after country were  taken possession of by the new religion that forced its way by means of  fire and sword?    Was it not natural that Christian Europe should conceive the idea  of doing for their religion what the Moslems did for Islam! and that,  following the example of Moslems in their \"holy war,\" Christians should  emulate them in the Crusades?    It must not be forgotten also that the Arabs, almost from the first  appearance of Muhammedanism, were under the refining and elevating  influences of art and science. While the rest of Europe was in the  midnight of the Dark Ages, the Moorish universities of Spain were the  beacon of the revival of learning. The Christian teacher was still  manipulating the bones of the saints when the Arab physician was  practising surgery. The monachal schools and monasteries in Italy,  France, and Germany were still grappling with poor scholastic knowledge  when Arab scholars were well advanced in the study of Aristotle and  Plato. Stimulated by their acquaintance with the works of Ptolemy and  Euclid, Galenus and Hippocrates, they extended their researches into the  dominions of astronomy, mathematics, and medicine.    [Illustration: 007.jpg ARABIC DECORATIVE PAINTING]    The religious orders of the knights, a product of the Crusades, found  their antitype in similar organisations of the Moslems, orders that had  exactly the same tendencies and regulations. Such an order established  for the spread of Islam and the protection of its followers was that of  the Raabites or boundary-guards in the Pyrenean peninsula. These knights  made a vow to carry, throughout their lives, arms in defence of the  faith; they led an austere existence, were not allowed to fly in battle,  but were compelled either to conquer or fall. Like the Templars or the  Hospital Knights their whole endeavour was to gain universal dominion  for their religion. The relation existing between the Moslems and  the Christians before the Crusades was much closer than is generally  imagined. Moslem soldiers often fought in the ranks of the Christian  armies; and it was by"]]]
