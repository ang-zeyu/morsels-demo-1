R. S., awoke with a start and discovered  himself to be bathed in cold perspiration. The moonlight shone in at  his window, but did not touch the bed, therefore his awakening could  not be due to this cause. He lay for some time listening for any  unfamiliar noise which might account for the sudden disturbance of  his usually sound slumbers. In the house below nothing stirred. His  windows were widely open and he could detect that vague drumming  which is characteristic of midnight London; sometimes, too, the  clashing of buffers upon some siding of the Brighton railway where  shunting was in progress and occasional siren notes from the Thames.  Otherwise--nothing.    He glanced at the luminous disk of his watch. The hour was half-past  two. Dawn was not far off. The night seemed to have become almost  intolerably hot, and to this heat Stuart felt disposed to ascribe  both his awakening and also a feeling of uncomfortable tension of  which he now became aware. He continued to listen, and, listening  and hearing nothing, recognized with anger that he was frightened.  A sense of some presence oppressed him. Someone or something evil  was near him--perhaps in the room, veiled by the shadows. This  uncanny sensation grew more and more marked.    Stuart sat up in bed, slowly and cautiously, looking all about him.  He remembered to have awakened once thus in India--and to have found  a great cobra coiled at his feet. His inspection revealed the  presence of nothing unfamiliar, and he stepped out on to the floor.    A faint clicking sound reached his ears. He stood quite still. The  clicking was repeated.    \"There is someone downstairs in my study!\" muttered Stuart.    He became aware that the fear which held him was such that unless he  acted and acted swiftly he should become incapable of action, but he  remembered that whereas the moonlight poured into the bedroom, the  staircase would be in complete darkness. He walked barefooted across  to the dressing-table and took up an electric torch which lay there.  He had not used it for some time, and he pressed the button to learn  if the torch was charged. A beam of white light shone out across the  room, and at the same instant came another sound.    If it came from below or above, from the adjoining room or from    Outside in the road, Stuart knew not. But following hard upon the  mysterious disturbance which had aroused him it seemed to pour ice  into his veins, it added the complementary touch to his panic. For  it was a kind of low wail--a ghostly minor wail in falling  cadences--unlike any sound he had heard. It was so excessively  horrible that it produced a curious effect.    Discovering from the dancing of the torch-ray that his hand was  trembling, Stuart concluded that he had awakened from a nightmare  and that this fiendish wailing was no more than an unusually delayed  aftermath of the imaginary horrors which had bathed him in cold  perspiration.    He walked resolutely to the door, threw it open and cast the beam of  light on to the staircase. Softly he began to descend. Before the  study door he paused. There was no sound. He threw open the door,  directing the torch-ray into the room.    Cutting a white lane through the blackness, it  shone fully upon his  writing-table, which was a rather fine Jacobean piece having a sort  of quaint bureau superstructure containing cabinets and drawers. He  could detect nothing unusual in the appearance of the littered table.  A tobacco jar stood there, a pipe resting in the lid. Papers and  books were scattered untidily as he had left them, surrounding a tray  full of pipe and cigarette ash. Then, suddenly, he saw something else.    One of the bureau drawers was half opened.    Stuart stood quite still, staring at the table. There was no sound in  the room. He crossed slowly, moving the light from right to left. His  papers had been overhauled methodically. The drawers had been  replaced, but he felt assured that all had been examined. The light  switch was immediately beside the outer door, and Stuart walked  over to it and switched on both lamps. Turning, he surveyed the  brilliantly illuminated room. Save for himself, it was empty. He  looked out into the hallway again. There was no one there. No sound  broke the stillness. But that consciousness of some near presence  asserted itself persistently and uncannily.    \"My nerves are out of order!\" he muttered. \"No one has touched my  papers. I must have left the drawer open myself.\"    He switched off the light and walked across to the door. He had  actually passed out intending to return to his room, when he became  aware of a slight draught. He stopped.    Someone or something, evil and watchful, seemed to be very near again.  Stuart turned and found himself gazing fearfully in the direction of  the open study door. He became persuaded anew that someone was hiding  there, and snatching up an ash stick which lay upon a chair in the  hall he returned to the door. One step into the room he took and  paused--palsied with a sudden fear which exceeded anything he had  known.    A white casement curtain was drawn across the French windows ... and  outlined upon this moon-bright screen he saw a tall figure. It was  that of a _cowled man_!    Such an apparition would have been sufficiently alarming had the cowl  been that of a monk, but the outline of this phantom being suggested  that of one of the Misericordia brethren or the costume worn of old  by the familiars of the Inquisition!    His heart leapt wildly, and seemed to grow still. He sought to cry out  in his terror, but only emitted a dry gasping sound.    The psychology of panic is obscure and has been but imperfectly  explored. The presence of the terrible cowled figure afforded a  confirmation of Stuart's theory that he was the victim of a species  of waking nightmare.    Even as he looked, the shadow of the cowled man moved--and was gone.    Stuart ran across the room, jerked open the curtains and stared out  across the moon-bathed lawn, its prospect terminated by high privet  hedges. One of the French windows was wide open. There was no one on  the lawn; there was no sound.    \"Mrs. M'Gregor swears that I always forget to shut these windows at  night!\" he muttered.    He closed and bolted the window, stood for a moment looking out across  the empty lawn, then turned and went out of the room.          CHAPTER II    THE PIBROCH OF THE M'GREGORS      Dr. Stuart awoke in the morning and tried to recall what had occurred  during the night. He consulted his watch and found the hour to be six  a. m.  No one was stirring in the house, and he rose and put on a  bath robe. He felt perfectly well and could detect no symptoms of  nervous disorder. Bright sunlight was streaming into the room, and  he went out on to the landing, fastening the cord of his gown as he  descended the stairs.    His study door was locked, with the key outside. He remembered having  locked it. Opening it, he entered and looked about him. He was  vaguely  disappointed. Save for the untidy litter of papers upon the  table, the study was as he had left it on retiring. If he could  believe the evidence of his senses, nothing had been disturbed.    Not content with a casual inspection, he particularly examined those  papers which, in his dream adventure, he had believed to have been  submitted to mysterious inspection. They showed no signs of having  been touched. The casement curtains were drawn across the recess  formed by the French windows, and sunlight streamed in where,  silhouetted against the pallid illumination of the moon, he had seen  the man in the cowl. Drawing back the curtains, he examined the window  fastenings. They were secure. If the window had really been open in  the night, he must have left it so himself.    \"Well,\" muttered Stuart--\"of all the amazing nightmares!\"    He determined, immediately he had bathed and completed his toilet, to  write an account of the dream for the Psychical Research Society, in  whose work he was interested. Half an hour later, as the movements of  an awakened household began to proclaim themselves, he sat down at  his writing-table and commenced to write.    Keppel Stuart was a dark, good-looking man of about thirty-two, an  easy-going bachelor who, whilst not over ambitious, was nevertheless  a brilliant physician. He had worked for the Liverpool School of  Tropical Medicine and had spent several years in India studying snake  poisons.

Whereas the Annotated Constitution of the United States of America  published in 1938 as Senate Document 232, Seventy-fourth Congress, has  served a very useful purpose by supplying essential information in one  volume and at a very reasonable price; and    Whereas Senate Document 232 is no longer available at the Government  Printing Office; and    Whereas the reprinting of this document without annotations for the last  ten years is now considered appropriate: Now, therefore, be it    _Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United  States of America in Congress assembled_, That the Librarian of Congress  is hereby authorized and directed to have the Annotated Constitution of  the United States of America, published in 1938, revised and extended to  include annotations of decisions of the Supreme Court prior to January  1, 1948, construing the several provisions of the Constitution  correlated under each separate provision, and to have the said revised  document printed at the Government Printing Office. Three thousand  copies shall be printed, of which two thousand two hundred copies shall  be for the use of the House of Representatives and eight hundred copies  for the use of the Senate.    Sec. 2. There is hereby authorized to be appropriated for  carrying out the provisions of this Act, with respect to the preparation  but not including printing, the sum of $35,000 to remain available until  expended.    Approved June 17, 1947.          PREFACE    By Honorable Alexander Wiley    _Chairman, Senate Foreign Relations Committee_      To the Members and Committees of the Congress, the Constitution is more  than a revered abstraction; it is an everyday companion and counsellor.  Into it, the Founding Fathers breathed the spirit of life; through every  subsequent generation, that spirit has remained vital.    In more than a century and a half of cataclysmic events, the  Constitution has successfully withstood test after test. No  crisis--foreign or domestic--has impaired its vitality. The system of  checks and balances which it sets up has enabled the growing nation to  adapt itself to every need and at the same time to checkrein every bid  for arbitrary power.    And meantime America itself has evolved dynamically and dramatically.  The humble 13 colonies, carved out of the wilderness in the 18th  Century, emerged in the 20th Century as leader of  earth--industrial--military--political--economic--psychological. Yet the  broad outline of the Supreme Law remains today fundamentally intact.    It is small wonder that W.E. Gladstone described the Constitution as  \"the most wonderful work ever struck off at a given time by the brain  and purpose of man.\" He knew, as should we, that the Constitution's  words, its phrases, clauses, sentences, paragraphs, and sections still  possess a miraculous quality--a mingled flexibility and strength which  permits its adaptation to the needs of the hour without sacrifice of its  essential character as the basic framework of freedom.    Congress has long recognized how necessary it is to have a handy working  guide to this superb charter. It has sought a map, so to speak, of the  great historical landmarks of Constitutional jurisprudence--landmarks  which mark the oft-times epic battles of clashing legal interpretations.  A first step was taken toward meeting this need by publication of Senate  Document 12, 63d Congress in 1913. Ten years later, in 1923 another  volume was issued, Senate Document 96, 67th Congress, and it was  followed in turn by Senate Document 154 of the 68th Congress.    In 1936, Congress authorized a further revision, this time by the  Legislative Reference Service. Mr. Wilfred C. Gilbert, now the Assistant  Director of the Service, was the editor of this volume which became  Senate Document 232, 74th Congress, and he has given counsel throughout  the development of the present edition of this volume.    After another decade of significant and far-reaching judicial  interpretation, the Senate Judiciary Committee reported out Senate Joint  Resolution 69 of the 80th Congress calling upon the Librarian of  Congress for the preparation of the new work. However, because of the  increase in responsibilities of the Legislative Reference Service, it  was no longer feasible for it to undertake this additional burden with  its regular staff. The Director of the Service, Dr. Ernest S. Griffith,  suggested therefore that Dr. Edward S. Corwin be engaged to head the  project with a collaborating staff to be furnished by the Legislative  Reference Service.    In my capacity at the time, as Chairman of the Senate Judiciary  Committee, I was delighted to give my approval to this arrangement, for  I recognized our particular good fortune in obtaining the services of an  acknowledged authority for this highly significant and delicate  enterprise.    I should like now to express our thanks and appreciation to Dr. Corwin  and to his collaborators from the Service, Dr. Norman J. Small,  Assistant Editor, Miss Mary Louise Ramsey, and Dr. Robert J. Harris, for  all their prodigious and skilled labors.    Moreover, for their considerable efforts in connection with the detailed  legislative and printing arrangements for the publication of this  volume, I should like to express appreciation to Mr. Darrell St. Claire,  Staff Member for the Senate Rules Committee, as well as Chief Clerk for  the Joint Committee on the Library of Congress; and Mr. Julius N. Cahn,  previously Executive Assistant to me when I was Chairman of the  Judiciary Committee and now Counsel to the Senate Foreign Relations  Committee.    Initiated in the Republican 80th Congress, the project was undertaken  With funds supplied by the succeeding Democratic 81st Congress, while  the Democratic 82d Congress extended its coverage to include Supreme  Court decisions through June 30, 1952. The document thus represents  Congressional nonpartisan activity at its best, as should ever be the  case in our fidelity to this great charter.    In the present volume, in addition to the annotations indicating the  current state of interpretation, Dr. Corwin has undertaken to supply an  historical background to the several lines of reasoning. It is our hope  and expectation that this introduction will prove of immense benefit to  users in understanding the trends of judicial constitutional  interpretation.    It is our further hope that this edition as a whole may serve a still  larger purpose--strengthening our understanding of and loyalty to the  principles of this republic.    In that way, the Constitution will remain the blueprint for freedom. It  will continue as an inspiration for us of this blessed land, and for men  and women everywhere; for they look to these shores as the lighthouse of  freedom, in a world where the darkness of despotism hangs so heavily.    _May 30, 1953._    [Illustration: Alexander Wiley signature]          PREFACE      For many years the Congress has felt the need for a handy, concise guide  to the interpretation of the Constitution. An edition of the  Constitution issued in 1913 as Senate Document 12, 63d Congress, took a  step in this direction by supplying under each clause, a citation of  Supreme Court decisions thereunder. This was obviously of limited  usefulness, leaving the reader, as it did, to an examination of cases  for any specific information. In 1921 the matter received further  consideration. Senate Resolution 151 authorized preparation of a volume  to contain the Constitution and its amendments, to January 1, 1923 \"with  citations to the cases of the Supreme Court of the United States  construing its several provisions.\" This was issued as Senate Document  96 of the 67th Congress, and was followed the next year by a similar  volume annotating the cases through the October 1923 Term of the Supreme  Court. (Senate Document 154, 68th Congress.) Both of these volumes went  somewhat beyond the mere enumeration of cases, carrying under the  particular provisions of the Constitution a brief statement of the point  involved in the principal cases cited.    Thirteen years of Constitutional developments led Congress in 1936 to  authorize a revision of the 1924 volume, and under authority of Senate  Concurrent Resolution 35 introduced by Senator Ashurst, Chairman of the  Judiciary Committee, such a revision was prepared in the Legislative  Reference Service and issued as Senate Document 232, 74th Congress.    This volume was, like its predecessors, dedicated to the need felt by  Members for a convenient ready-reference manual. However, so extensive  and important had been the judicial interpretation of the Constitution  in the"]]]
