McCANN COMPANY  1920          THE JAMES A. McCANN COMPANY    PRINTED IN THE U.S.A.          INTRODUCTION      The medical profession is justly conservative. Human life should not be  considered as the proper material for wild experiments.    Conservatism, however, is too often a welcome excuse for lazy minds,  loath to adapt themselves to fast changing conditions.    Remember the scornful reception which first was accorded to Freud's  discoveries in the domain of the unconscious.    When after years of patient observations, he finally decided to appear  before medical bodies to tell them modestly of some facts which always  recurred in his dream and his patients' dreams, he was first laughed at  and then avoided as a crank.    The words \"dream interpretation\" were and still are indeed fraught with  unpleasant, unscientific associations. They remind one of all sorts of  childish, superstitious notions, which make up the thread and woof of  dream books, read by none but the ignorant and the primitive.    The wealth of detail, the infinite care never to let anything pass  unexplained, with which he presented to the public the result of his  investigations, are impressing more and more serious-minded scientists,  but the examination of his evidential data demands arduous work and  presupposes an absolutely open mind.    This is why we still encounter men, totally unfamiliar with Freud's  writings, men who were not even interested enough in the subject to  attempt an interpretation of their dreams or their patients' dreams,  deriding Freud's theories and combatting them with the help of  statements which he never made.    Some of them, like Professor Boris Sidis, reach at times conclusions  which are strangely similar to Freud's, but in their ignorance of  psychoanalytic literature, they fail to credit Freud for observations  antedating theirs.    Besides those who sneer at dream study, because they have never looked  into the subject, there are those who do not dare to face the facts  revealed by dream study. Dreams tell us many an unpleasant biological  truth about ourselves and only very free minds can thrive on such a  diet. Self-deception is a plant which withers fast in the pellucid  atmosphere of dream investigation.    The weakling and the neurotic attached to his neurosis are not anxious  to turn such a powerful searchlight upon the dark corners of their  psychology.    Freud's theories are anything but theoretical.    He was moved by the fact that there always seemed to be a close  connection between his patients' dreams and their mental abnormalities,  to collect thousands of dreams and to compare them with the case  histories in his possession.    He did not start out with a preconceived bias, hoping to find evidence  which might support his views. He looked at facts a thousand times  \"until they began to tell him something.\"    His attitude toward dream study was, in other words, that of a  statistician who does not know, and has no means of foreseeing, what  conclusions will be forced on him by the information he is gathering,  but who is fully prepared to accept those unavoidable conclusions.    This was indeed a novel way in psychology. Psychologists had always been  wont to build, in what Bleuler calls \"autistic ways,\" that is through  methods in no wise supported by evidence, some attractive hypothesis,  which sprung from their brain, like Minerva from Jove's brain, fully  armed.    After which, they would stretch upon that unyielding frame the hide of a  reality which they had previously killed.    It is only to minds suffering from the same distortions, to minds also  autistically inclined, that those empty, artificial structures appear  acceptable molds for philosophic thinking.    The pragmatic view that \"truth is what works\" had not been as yet  expressed when Freud published his revolutionary views on the psychology  of dreams.    Five facts of first magnitude were made obvious to the world by his  interpretation of dreams.    First of all, Freud pointed out a constant connection between some part  of every dream and some detail of the dreamer's life during the previous  waking state. This positively establishes a relation between sleeping  states and waking states and disposes of the widely prevalent view that  dreams are purely nonsensical phenomena coming from nowhere and leading  nowhere.    Secondly, Freud, after studying the dreamer's life and modes of thought,  after noting down all his mannerisms and the apparently insignificant  details of his conduct which reveal his secret thoughts, came to the  conclusion that there was in every dream the attempted or successful  gratification of some wish, conscious or unconscious.    Thirdly, he proved that many of our dream visions are symbolical, which  causes us to consider them as absurd and unintelligible; the  universality of those symbols, however, makes them very transparent to  the trained observer.    Fourthly, Freud showed that sexual desires play an enormous part in our  unconscious, a part which puritanical hypocrisy has always tried to  minimize, if not to ignore entirely.    Finally, Freud established a direct connection between dreams and  insanity, between the symbolic visions of our sleep and the symbolic  actions of the mentally deranged.    There were, of course, many other observations which Freud made while  dissecting the dreams of his patients, but not all of them present as  much interest as the foregoing nor were they as revolutionary or likely  to wield as much influence on modern psychiatry.    Other explorers have struck the path blazed by Freud and leading into  man's unconscious. Jung of Zurich, Adler of Vienna and Kempf of  Washington, D.C., have made to the study of the unconscious,  contributions which have brought that study into fields which Freud  himself never dreamt of invading.    One fact which cannot be too emphatically stated, however, is that but  for Freud's wishfulfillment theory of dreams, neither Jung's \"energic  theory,\" nor Adler's theory of \"organ inferiority and compensation,\"  nor Kempf's \"dynamic mechanism\" might have been formulated.    Freud is the father of modern abnormal psychology and he established the  psychoanalytical point of view. No one who is not well grounded in  Freudian lore can hope to achieve any work of value in the field of  psychoanalysis.    On the other hand, let no one repeat the absurd assertion that Freudism  is a sort of religion bounded with dogmas and requiring an act of faith.  Freudism as such was merely a stage in the development of  psychoanalysis, a stage out of which all but a few bigoted camp  followers, totally lacking in originality, have evolved. Thousands of  stones have been added to the structure erected by the Viennese  physician and many more will be added in the course of time.    But the new additions to that structure would collapse like a house of  cards but for the original foundations which are as indestructible as  Harvey's statement as to the circulation of the blood.    Regardless of whatever additions or changes have been made to the  original structure, the analytic point of view remains unchanged.    That point of view is not only revolutionising all the methods of  diagnosis and treatment of mental derangements, but compelling the  intelligent, up-to-date physician to revise entirely his attitude to  almost every kind of disease.    The insane are no longer absurd and pitiable people, to be herded in  asylums till nature either cures them or relieves them, through death,  of their misery. The insane who have not been made so by actual injury  to their brain or nervous system, are the victims of unconscious forces  which cause them to do abnormally things which they might be helped to  do normally.    Insight into one's psychology is replacing victoriously sedatives and  rest cures.    Physicians dealing with \"purely\" physical cases have begun to take into  serious consideration the \"mental\" factors which have predisposed a  patient to certain ailments.    Freud's views have also made a revision of all ethical and social values  unavoidable and have thrown an unexpected flood of light upon literary  and artistic accomplishment.    But the Freudian point of view, or more broadly speaking, the  psychoanalytic point of view, shall ever remain a puzzle to those who,  from laziness or indifference, refuse to survey with the great Viennese  the field over which he carefully groped his way. We shall never be  convinced until we repeat under his guidance all his laboratory  experiments.    We must follow him through the thickets of the unconscious, through the  land which had never been charted because academic philosophers,  following the line of least effort, had decided _a priori_ that it could  not be charted.    Ancient geographers, when exhausting their store of information about  distant lands, yielded to an unscientific craving for romance and,  without any evidence to support their day dreams, filled the blank  spaces left on their maps by unexplored tracts with amusing inserts such  as \"Here there are lions.\"    Thanks to Freud's interpretation of dreams the \"royal road\" into the  unconscious is now open to all explorers. They shall not find lions,  they shall find man himself, and the record of all his life and of his  struggle with reality.    And it is only after seeing man as his unconscious, revealed by his  dreams, presents him to us that we shall understand him fully. For as  Freud said to Putnam: \"We are what we are because we have been what we  have been.\""]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1549"],[0,"Commentary on the Epistle to the Galatians (#1)"],[1,"ON THE EPISTLE TO THE GALATIANS    (1535)    By Martin Luther    Translated by Theodore Graebner          PREFACE    The preparation of this edition of Luther's Commentary on Galatians was  first suggested to me by Mr. P. J. Zondervan, of the firm of publishers,  in March, 1937. The consultation had the twofold merit of definiteness  and brevity.    \"Luther is still the greatest name in Protestantism. We want you to  help us publish some leading work of Luther's for the general American  market. Will you do it?\"    \"I will, on one condition.\"    \"And what is that?\"    \"The condition is that I will be permitted to make Luther talk American,  'streamline' him, so to speak--because you will never get people,  whether in or outside the Lutheran Church, actually to read Luther  unless we make him talk as he would talk today to Americans.\"    I illustrated the point by reading to Mr. Zondervan a few sentences from  an English translation lately reprinted by an American publisher, of one  of Luther's outstanding reformatory essays.    The demonstration seemed to prove convincing for it was agreed that one  may as well offer Luther in the original German or Latin as expect the  American church-member to read any translations that would adhere to  Luther's German or Latin constructions and employ the Mid-Victorian type  of English characteristic of the translations now on the market.    \"And what book would be your choice?\"    \"There is one book that Luther himself likes better than any other. Let  us begin with that: his Commentary on Galatians...\"    The undertaking, which seemed so attractive when viewed as a literary  task, proved a most difficult one, and at times became oppressive.  The Letter to the Galatians consists of six short chapters. Luther's  commentary fills seven hundred and thirty-three octavo pages in the  Weidman Edition of his works. It was written in Latin. We were resolved  not to present this entire mass of exegesis. It would have run to more  than fifteen hundred pages, ordinary octavo (like this), since it  is impossible to use the compressed structure of sentences which is  characteristic of Latin, and particularly of Luther's Latin. The work  had to be condensed. German and English translations are available,  but the most acceptable English version, besides laboring under the  handicaps of an archaic style, had to be condensed into half its volume  in order to accomplish the \"streamlining\" of the book. Whatever merit  the translation now presented to the reader may possess should be  written to the credit of Rev. Gerhardt Mahler of Geneva, N.Y., who came  to my assistance in a very busy season by making a rough draft of the  translation and later preparing a revision of it, which forms the basis  of the final draft submitted to the printer. A word should now be said  about the origin of Luther's Commentary on Galatians.    The Reformer had lectured on this Epistle of St. Paul's in 1519 and  again in 1523. It was his favorite among all the Biblical books. In his  table talks the saying is recorded: \"The Epistle to the Galatians is  my epistle. To it I am as it were in wedlock. It is my Katherine.\" Much  later when a friend of his was preparing an edition of all his Latin  works, he remarked to his home circle: \"If I had my way about it  they would republish only those of my books which have doctrine. My  Galatians, for instance.\" The lectures which are preserved in the works  herewith submitted to the American public were delivered in 1531. They  were taken down by George Roerer, who held something of a deanship  at Wittenberg University and who was one of Luther's aids in the  translation of the Bible. Roerer took down Luther's lectures and this  manuscript has been preserved to the present day, in a copy which  contains also additions by Veit Dietrich and by Cruciger, friends of  Roerer's, who with him attended Luther's lectures. In other words, these  three men took down the lectures which Luther addressed to his students  in the course of Galatians, and Roerer prepared the manuscript for  the printer. A German translation by Justus Menius appeared in the  Wittenberg Edition of Luther's writings, published in 1539.    The importance of this Commentary on Galatians for the history of  Protestantism is very great. It presents like no other of Luther's  writings the central thought of Christianity, the justification of the  sinner for the sake of Christ's merits alone. We have permitted in the  final revision of the manuscript many a passage to stand which seemed  weak and ineffectual when compared with the trumpet tones of the Latin  original. But the essence of Luther's lectures is there. May the reader  accept with indulgence where in this translation we have gone too far in  modernizing Luther's expression--making him \"talk American.\"    At the end of his lectures in 1531, Luther uttered a brief prayer and  then dictated two Scriptural texts, which we shall inscribe at the end  of these introductory remarks:    \"The Lord who has given us power to teach and to hear, let Him also give  us the power to serve and to do.\"                     LUKE 2              Glory to God in the highest,            And on earth peace,            Good will to men.                          ISAIAH 40             The Word of our God shall stand forever.      THEODORE GRAEBNER    St. Louis, Missouri          FROM LUTHER'S INTRODUCTION, 1538        In my heart reigns this one article, faith in my dear Lord Christ,    the beginning, middle and end of whatever spiritual and divine    thoughts I may have, whether by day or by night.          CHAPTER 1        VERSE 1. Paul, an apostle, (not of men, neither by man, but by Jesus    Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead).      St. Paul wrote this epistle because, after his departure from the  Galatian churches, Jewish-Christian fanatics moved in, who perverted  Paul's Gospel of man's free justification by faith in Christ Jesus.    The world bears the Gospel a grudge because the Gospel condemns the  religious wisdom of the world. Jealous for its own religious views, the  world in turn charges the Gospel with being a subversive and licentious  doctrine, offensive to God and man, a doctrine to be persecuted as the  worst plague on earth.    As a result we have this paradoxical situation: The Gospel supplies the  world with the salvation of Jesus Christ, peace of conscience, and every  blessing. Just for that the world abhors the Gospel.    These Jewish-Christian fanatics who pushed themselves into the Galatian  churches after Paul's departure, boasted that they were the descendants  of Abraham, true ministers of Christ, having been trained by the  apostles themselves, that they were able to perform miracles.    In every way they sought to undermine the authority of St. Paul. They  said to the Galatians: \"You have no right to think highly of Paul. He  was the last to turn to Christ. But we have seen Christ. We heard Him  preach. Paul came later and is beneath us. It is possible for us to be  in error--we who have received the Holy Ghost? Paul stands alone. He has  not seen Christ, nor has he had much contact with the other apostles.  Indeed, he persecuted the Church of Christ for a long time.\"    When men claiming such credentials come along, they deceive not only the  naive, but also those who seemingly are well-established in the faith.  This same argument is used by the papacy. \"Do you suppose that God for  the sake of a few Lutheran heretics would disown His entire Church? Or  do you suppose that God would have left His Church floundering in error  all these centuries?\" The Galatians were taken in by such arguments with  the result that Paul's authority and doctrine were drawn in question.    Against these boasting, false apostles, Paul boldly defends his  apostolic authority and ministry. Humble man that he was, he will not  now take a back seat. He reminds them of the time when he opposed Peter  to his face and reproved the chief of the apostles.    Paul devotes the first two chapters to a defense of his office and his  Gospel, affirming that he received it, not from men, but from the Lord  Jesus Christ by special revelation, and that if he or an angel from  heaven preach any other gospel than the one he had preached, he shall be  accursed.                            The Certainty of Our Calling    Every minister should make much of his calling and impress upon others  the fact that he has been delegated by God to preach the Gospel. As the  ambassador of a government is honored for his office and not for his  private person, so the minister of Christ should exalt his office in  order to gain authority among men. This is not vain glory, but needful  glorying.    Paul takes pride in his ministry, not to his own praise but to the  praise of God. Writing to the Romans, he declares, \"Inasmuch as I am  the apostle of the Gentiles, I magnify mine office,\" i.e., I want to be  received not as Paul of Tarsus, but as Paul the apostle and ambassador  of Jesus Christ, in order that people might be more eager to hear. Paul  exalts his ministry out of the desire to make known the name, the grace,  and the mercy of God.      VERSE 1. Paul, an apostle, (not of men, etc.)    Paul loses no time in defending himself against the charge that he had  thrust himself into the ministry. He says to the Galatians: \"My call may  seem inferior to you. But those who have come to you are either called  of men or by man. My call is the highest possible, for it is by Jesus  Christ, and God the Father.\"    When Paul speaks of those called \"by men,\" I take it he means those whom  neither God nor man sent, but who go wherever they like and speak for  themselves.    When Paul speaks of those called \"by man\" I take it he means those who  have a divine call extended to them through other persons. God calls  in two ways. Either He calls ministers through the agency of men, or  "]]]
