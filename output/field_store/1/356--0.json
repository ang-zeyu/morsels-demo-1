The one-act play in particular,  chiefly represented in this volume, appears to be taking the  place of that rather squeezed sponge, the short story, in the  favor of the reading public. Of course, this tendency has its  reaction in schoolrooms. One even hears of high-school classes  which attempt to keep up with the entire output of such dramas in  English readings. If this is not merely an apologue, it is  certainly a horrible example. The bulk of current drama, as of  published matter generally, is not worthy the time of the English  class. Only what is measurably of rank, in truth and fineness,  with the literature which has endured from past times can be  defended for use there. And we have too much that is both well  fitted to young people's keen interest and enjoyment, and  beautifully worthy as well, for time to be wasted upon the third-  and fourth-rate.    Obviously, much of the best in modern play-writing has not been  included in this volume. Because of copyright complications the  works of Mr. Masefield, Mr. Shaw, Mr. Drinkwater, and Sir James  Barrie are not here represented. The plays by these writers that  seem best fitted to use by teachers and pupils in high schools,  together with a large number of other dramas for this purpose,  are listed and annotated at the back of the book. Suggestions as  to desirable inclusions and omissions will be welcomed by the  editor and the publishers.    Following in their own way the lead of the Theatre Libre in Paris  and the Freie Buehne in Germany, and of the Independent and the  Repertory theatres in Great Britain, numerous \"little theatres\"  and drama associations in this country are giving impulsion and  direction to the movement for finer drama and more excellent  presentation. The Harvard dramatic societies, the Morningside  Players at Columbia, Mr. Alex Drummond's Community Theatre at the  State Fair in Ithaca, the Little Country Theatre at Fargo, South  Dakota, and similar groups at the University of California and  elsewhere, illustrate the leadership of the colleges. In many  high schools, as at South Bend, Indiana, more or less complete  Little Theatres are active. The Chicago Little Theatre, the  Wisconsin Dramatic Society, the Provincetown Players, the  Neighborhood Playhouse, in New York, and others of that ilk, are  well known and influential. They are extending the tradition of  the best European theatres in their attempts to cultivate  excellent and individual expression in drama. They realize that  plays must be tested by actual performance,--though not  necessarily by the unnatural demands of success in competition  with Broadway revues and farce-melodramas,--and thus developed  toward a genuine artistic embodiment of the vast and varied life,  the manifold and deep idealism of this country.          ACKNOWLEDGMENTS      For their courteous and generous cooperation the editor is  greatly indebted to the authors and publishers of all the plays  included. He is equally grateful to other dramatists who were  personally as cordial in intention but quite impotent to grant  copyright privileges. In addition, he has received most friendly  and cordial criticism from friends and friendly strangers to whom  he appealed--among others, from Mr. Harold Brighouse; Mr.  Theodore Hinckley, editor of \"Drama\"; Mr. Clarence Stratton, now  Director of English at Cleveland, and author of a forthcoming  book on the Little Theatre in this country; Mr. Allan Monkhouse,  author of \"Mary Broome\" and \"War Plays\"; Professor Allan Abbot,  of Teachers College, Columbia University; Mr. Frank G. Thompkins,  of Central High School, Detroit; Mrs. Mary Austin; Professor Earl  B. Pence, of De Pauw University; Professor Brander Matthews; and  Mrs. Alice Chapin. Indebtedness to many lists is obvious,  particularly to that of the Drama League and the National Council  of Teachers of English, and that of Professor Pence in the  \"Illinois Bulletin.\"    \"Ile\" is reprinted by special arrangement with the author and  with Boni and Liveright, publishers, New York. \"Ile\" is reprinted  from the volume \"The Moon of The Caribbees\" and six other plays  of the sea, which volume is one of the series of plays by Mr.  O'Neill, the series including \"Beyond the Horizon,\" a drama in  four acts, \"The Straw,\" a play in three acts and five scenes,  \"Gold,\" a play in four acts and \"Chris\" a play in four acts.          INTRODUCTION: ON THE READING OF PLAYS      The elder Dumas, who wrote many successful plays, as well as the  famous romances, said that all he needed for constructing a drama  was \"four boards, two actors, and a passion.\" What he meant by  passion has been defined by a later French writer, Ferdinand  Brunetiere, as a conflict of wills. The Philosopher of Butterbiggens,  whom you will meet early in this book, points out that \"what you  are all the time wanting\" is \"your own way.\" When two strong  desires conflict and we wonder which is coming out ahead, we say  that the situation is dramatic. This clash is clearly defined in  any effective play, from the crude melodrama in which the forces  are hero and villain with pistols, to such subtle conflicts,  based on a man's misunderstanding of even his own motives and  purposes, as in Mr. Middleton's \"Tides.\"    In comedy, and even in farce, struggle is clearly present. Here  our sympathy is with people who engage in a not impossible  combat--against rather obvious villains who can be unmasked, or  against such public opinion or popular conventions as can be  overset. The hold of an absurd bit of gossip upon stupid people  is firm enough in \"Spreading the News\"; but fortunately it must  yield to facts at last. The Queen and the Knave of Hearts are  sufficiently clever, with the aid of the superb cookery of the  Knave's wife, to do away with an ancient and solemnly reverenced  law of Pompdebile's court. So, too, the force of ancient loyalty  and enthusiasm almost works a miracle in the invalid veteran of  \"Gettysburg.\" And we feel sure that the uncanny powers of the  Beggar will be no less successful in overturning the power of the  King in Mr. Parkhurst's play.    Again, in comedies as in mathematics, the problem is often solved  by substitution. The soldier in Mr. Galsworthy's \"The Sun\" is  able to find a satisfactory and apparently happy ending without  achieving what he originally set out to gain. And the same is  true of Jock in Mr. Brighouse's \"Lonesome-Like.\" Or the play  which does not end as the chief character wishes may still prove  not too serious because, as in \"Fame and the Poet,\" the situation  is merely inconvenient and absurd rather than tragic. Now and  then it is next to impossible to tell whether the ending is  tragic or not; in the \"Land of Heart's Desire\" we must first  decide whether our sympathies are more with Shawn Bruin and with  Maire's love for him, or with her keen desire to go      To where the woods, the stars, and the white streams    Are holding a continual festival.    It is natural for us to desire a happy ending in stories, as we  desire satisfying solutions of the problems in our own lives. And  whenever the forces at work are such as make it true and possible,  naturally this is the best ending for a story or a play. But where  powerful and terrible influences have to be combated, only a poor  dramatist will make use of mere chance, or compel his characters  to do what such people really would not do, to bring about a  factitious \"happy ending.\" With the relentless, mighty arms of  England engaged in hunting the defeated Highlanders after the  Battle of Culloden, a play like \"Campbell of Kilmhor,\" in which we  sympathize with the ill-fated Stewarts, cannot end happily. If  they had yielded under pressure and betrayed their comrades, we  might have pitied them, but we could not admire their action, and  there would have been no strong conclusion. In \"Riders to the  Sea,\" where the characters are compelled by bitter poverty to face  the relentless forces of storm and sea, and in \"The Biding to  Lithend,\" we expect a tragic end almost from the first lines of  the play. We recognize this same dramatic tensity of hopeless  conflict in many"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16441"],[0,"The Closet of Sir Kenelm Digby Knight Opened (#1)"],[1,"note: Original spellings, including inconsistencies, left in  this e-text.

It stands, vaguely perhaps, but permanently, for  something versatile and brilliant and romantic. He remains a perpetual type  of the hero of romance, the double hero, in the field of action and the  realm of the spirit. Had he lived in an earlier age he would now be a  mythological personage; and even without the looming exaggeration and  glamour of myth he still imposes. The men of to-day seem all of little  stature, and less consequence, beside the gigantic creature who made his  way with equal address and audacity in courts and councils, laboratories  and ladies' bowers.    So when, in a seventeenth-century bookseller's advertisement, I lighted on  a reference to the curious compilation of receipts entitled _The Closet of  Sir Kenelm Digby Opened_, having the usual idea of him as a great  gentleman, romantic Royalist, and somewhat out-of-date philosopher, I was  enough astonished at seeing his name attached to what seemed to me, in my  ignorance, outside even his wide fields of interest, to hunt for the book  without delay, examine its contents, and inquire as to its authenticity. Of  course I found it was not unknown. Though the _Dictionary of National  Biography_ omits any reference to it, and its name does not occur in Mr.  Carew Hazlitt's _Old Cookery Books_, Dr. Murray quotes it in his great  Dictionary, and it is mentioned and discussed in _The Life of Digby by One  of his Descendants_. But Mr. Longueville treats it therein with too scant  deference. One of a large and interesting series of contemporary books of  the kind, its own individual interest is not small; and I commend it with  confidence to students of seventeenth-century domestic manners. To  apologise for it, to treat it as if it were some freak, some unowned sin of  Digby's, would be the greatest mistake. On the contrary, its connection  with his life and career is of the closest; and I make bold to assert that  of all his works, with the doubtful exception of his _Memoirs_, it is the  one best worth reprinting. It is in no spirit of irony that I say of him  who in his own day was looked on almost as Bacon's equal, who was the  friend of Bacon, Galileo, Descartes, Harvey, Ben Jonson, Cromwell, and all  the great spirits of his time, the intimate of kings, and the special  friend of queens, that his memory should be revived for his skill in making  drinks, and his interest in his own and other folks' kitchens. If to the  magnificent and protean Sir Kenelm must now be added still another side, if  he must appear not only as gorgeous Cavalier, inmate of courts,  controversialist, man of science, occultist, privateer, conspirator, lover  and wit, but as _bon viveur_ too, he is not the ordinary _bon viveur_, who  feasts at banquets prepared by far away and unconsidered menials. His  interest in cookery--say, rather, his passion for it--was in truth an  integral part of his philosophy, and quite as serious as his laboratory  practice at Gresham College and Paris. But to prove what may seem an  outrageous exaggeration, we must first run over the varied story of his  career; and then _The Closet Opened_ will be seen to fall into its due and  important place.    Kenelm Digby owed a good deal to circumstances, but he owed most of all to  his own rich nature. His family was ancient and honourable. Tiltons  originally, they took their later name in Henry III's time, on the  acquisition of some property in Lincolnshire, though in Warwickshire and  Rutland most of them were settled. Three Lancastrian Digby brothers fell at  Towton, seven on Bosworth Field. To his grandfather, Sir Everard the  philosopher, he was mentally very much akin, much more so than to his  father, another of the many Sir Everards, and the most notorious one. Save  for his handsome person and the memory of a fervent devotion to the  Catholic faith, which was to work strongly in him after he came to mature  years, he owed little or nothing to that most unhappy young man, surely the  foolishest youth who ever blundered out of the ways of private virtue into  conspiracy and crime. Kenelm, his elder son, born July 11, 1603, was barely  three years old when his father, the most guileless and the most obstinate  of the Gunpowder Plotters, died on the scaffold. The main part of the  family wealth, as the family mansion Gothurst--now Gayhurst--in  Buckinghamshire, came from Sir Everard's wife, Mary Mulsho; and probably  that is one reason why James I acceded to the doomed man's appeal that his  widow and children should not be reduced to beggary. Kenelm, in fact,  entered on his active career with an income of L3000 a year; but even its  value in those days did not furnish a youth of such varied ambitions and  such magnificent exterior over handsomely for his journey through the  world. His childhood was spent under a cloud. He was bred by a mother whose  life was broken and darkened, and whose faith, barely tolerated, would  naturally keep her apart from the more favoured persons of the kingdom.  Kenelm might have seemed destined to obscurity; but there was that about  the youth that roused interest; and even the timid King James was attracted  by him into a magnanimous forgetfulness of his father's offence.  Nevertheless, he could never have had the easy destiny of other young men  of his class, unless he had been content to be a simple country gentleman;  and from the first his circumstances and his restless mind dictated his  career, which had always something in it of the brilliant adventurer.    Another branch of the Digbies rose as the Buckinghamshire family fell. It  was a John Digby, afterwards Earl of Bristol, who carried the news of the  conspirators' design on the Princess Elizabeth. King James's gratitude was  a ladder of promotion, which would have been firmer had not this Protestant  Digby incurred the dislike of the royal favourite Buckingham. But in 1617  Sir John was English ambassador in Madrid; and it may have been to get the  boy away from the influence of his mother and her Catholic friends that  this kinsman, always well disposed towards him, and anxious for his  advancement, took him off to Spain when he was fourteen, and kept him there  for a year. Nor was his mother's influence unmeddled with otherwise. During  some of the years of his minority at least, Laud, then Dean of Gloucester,  was his tutor. Tossed to and fro between the rival faiths, he seems to have  regarded them both impartially, or indifferently, with an occasional  adherence to the one that for the moment had the better exponent.    His education was that of a dilettante. A year in Spain, in Court and  diplomatic circles, was followed by a year at Oxford, where Thomas Allen,  the mathematician and occultist, looked after his studies. Allen \"quickly  discerned the natural strength of his faculties, and that spirit of  penetration which is so seldom met with in persons of his age.\" He felt he  had under his care a young Pico di Mirandola. It may have been now he made  his boyish translation of the _Pastor Fido_, and his unpublished version of  Virgil's _Eclogues_. As to the latter, the quite unimportant fact that he  made one at all I offer to future compilers of Digby biographies. Allen  till his death remained his friend and admirer, and bequeathed to him his  valuable library. The MSS. part of it Digby presented to the Bodleian. A  portion of the rest he seems to have kept; and though it is said his  English library was burnt by the Parliamentarians, it seems not unlikely  that some of Allen's books were among his collection at Paris sold after  his death by the King of France.    But Kenelm was restlessly longing to taste life outside academic circles,  and already he was hotly in love with his old playmate, now grown into  great beauty, Venetia Anastasia Stanley, daughter of Edward Stanley of  Tonge, in Shropshire, and granddaughter of the Earl of Northumberland. If I  could connect the beautiful Venetia with this cookery book, I should  willingly linger over the tale of her striking and brief career. But though  the elder Lady Digby contributed something to _The Closet Opened_, there is  no suggestion that it owes a single receipt to the younger. Above Kenelm in  station as"]]]
