His ways are not  the ways of other people: he is suspicious, distant, and he does not  care to show his hand--unless, of course, there is some pecuniary  advantage to be gained. He is invariably on the alert for advantages  of that description.    His suspicious nature has probably been handed down to him from  preceding generations. When he first set foot in South Africa he was  naturally chary concerning the native population. He had to deal  firmly with Bushmen, and the latter certainly proved a source of  continual trouble. The Boer set himself a difficult task when he  undertook to instil fear, obedience, and submission into the hearts of  these barbarians--a task that could only be faced by men of firm  determination and unlimited self-confidence.    These characteristics have always inspired the Boer, and although he  may often have been the object of derision, it is to his credit that  the predominant qualities mentioned have enabled him to pull through  the miry clay. Without these qualities, it is patent that the little  band which landed at the Cape long years ago would have succumbed  before the conflicting forces which then existed. And as succeeding  years passed on, and the sun still shone upon the heads of the  pioneers, it is worthy to note that, despite the difficulties which  continually presented themselves, the little band multiplied,  prospered, and evolved an ensample not too mean to contemplate.    The Boer cannot be charged with any incapacity where the mere  treatment of natives is concerned; he can manage that business  perfectly. In the first place, he does not make the too common mistake  of allowing the black populace to insert the thin end of the wedge.  This is a mistake too often fraught with serious results, and the Boer  knows it. A native, no matter if he be Swazi, Zulu, Basuto, or any  other nationality, will always take advantage where such is offered,  and he will follow it up with enough persistence to warrant ultimate  success. In Natal, at the present time, this mistake is very apparent,  and, in consequence, one very seldom encounters a native who is  content to attire himself in any other manner than that adopted by his  master. He demands decent clothing, and, if possible, it must be new  and fashionable. I have known cases where a 'boy' has been presented  with a respectable suit of clothes a little too small for him, and it  is unnecessary to add that he disposed of that suit. People who have  hitherto allowed their children to put their pennies in the Sunday  School Mission box, will perhaps hesitate to continue supporting the  'poor, down-trodden native' when they learn that he is so fastidious,  and perhaps, after all, their spare coppers might be assigned to a  more deserving cause.    The Boer does not treat his black servants in any such fashion--he  knows better. He puts them on a sound footing to begin with, and he  leads them to understand that they must remain there.    This method of treatment where the natives are concerned has, to a  great extent, insured the progress of the Boer in South Africa. He has  laid down certain laws at the outset, and he has rigidly adhered to  those laws. He employs a different method of treatment from that which  is attributed to the Natal farmer and others who employ native  servants. He has never allowed his original attitude towards natives  to become compatible with the British idea; he prefers still to look  upon them as slaves, although he is perforce required to regard them  as servants. The difficulty in Natal with regard to the rapidly  increasing native populace, and how to deal effectually with the  question, might have arisen in the Orange Free State, for instance,  were it not for the fact that the native, in comparison with the white  population, is small. By a Law passed in the Volksraad some few years  ago, it became compulsory for farmers to allow only a limited number  of native families to remain on the farms. This created considerable  dissatisfaction among both farmers and natives, and the result was  that native labour approached the inadequate in a very short time.  Hundreds of native families left the State, and although the Law  ultimately admitted of a wider interpretation, the native populace has  not materially increased. The present attitude of natives in the towns  is not altogether satisfactory since the passing of this Law. Labour  being scarce, they are inclined to take up an independent attitude,  which, if fraught with little danger, is at least calculated to  produce a certain amount of friction between white and black. Added to  this, there is the fact that the education of natives, which is  becoming more general, undoubtedly assists the growth of this  independence. The Boer farmers in this connection adhere to their  pristine view of the matter, namely, that educating natives amounts to  casting pearls before swine; and although this does not tend to  encourage the work of the missionary, there may possibly be a certain  amount of truth in it.    Before the arrival of British subjects at the Cape, the Boer had it  all his own way. He looked upon himself as practically the ruler of  the country, and it was not natural that he should look with favour  upon the advent of a probable rival. He lived peacefully in a  way--that is, when he was not in open conflict with the natives. He  killed his game and cooked it and ate it heartily, and he enjoyed a  measure of happiness. He had found a home; the free-and-easy life  suited him; and if he was not possessed of riches (which would have  been of little value to him then), he had, at least, health and  strength and an abundance of daily food.    But one day the now accursed Englishman crossed his path, and that  made a considerable difference. He perhaps wondered why the English  came there at all, when he was just beginning to develop a great  country. But he did not, of course, know then what he knows now,  namely, that the English are insatiable land-grabbers! He looked upon  their advent more in the light of a huge slice of impertinence. He  knew also that it was dangerous to meddle or contend with them, so he  merely looked on with a suspicious eye. He watched their every  movement, and he also very probably looked for the day of their  departure. But they did not depart; they had come to stay.    The Boer did not like his English neighbours from the start; there was  far too much of the go-ahead persuasion about them. He wanted to jog  along quietly and cautiously, and he very naturally resented the  presence of people in whom the desire for progression was strong. So  long as the Boer was left to himself he was not aware of his own  tardiness. He was very much in the position of a cyclist on the track;  it needed a 'pacer' to show how slowly he was travelling. The 'pacer'  in this instance brought with him no commendation in the eyes of the  Boer; he merely created suspicion and ill-feeling, which ultimately  developed into rancour.    When suspicion lays hold of a man it invariably changes the whole of  that man's character. It did so in the case of the Boer. It debarred  any chance of reconciliation with the English for the future. The Boer  does not know the meaning of compromise, and if he did, it would go  against his grain to entertain it. His nature is stubborn; he cannot  bring himself to look at a question from any other view-point than his  own. He will argue a point for hours, and although he may be in the  wrong, it is a moral impossibility to convince him that he is not in  the right. His consummate ignorance may largely account for this; but  even semi-educated Boers are not much better in this respect.    The Boer makes an excellent pioneer, and when he found that the  English ideas were not compatible with his own, he decided to move  farther north. That is another of his characteristics--independence.  He is not only independent to a degree, he is sensitive; and when he  discovers by accident that he is a much-aggrieved party, his  indignation does not usually take a violent form--he simply clears  out. He may be somewhat different where the Transvaal is concerned--he  may be indignant, but he has no intention in this instance of adopting  the procedure of his forefathers. The latter had not yet dropped into  an inheritance glittering with gold; they were merely agriculturists,  and they desired pastures of their own. Some of them found desirable  pastures in the barren wastes of the Free State, and subsequently the  majority wended their way to the Transvaal.

Only  a few months before, Richard II--weak, wicked, and treacherous--had been  dethroned, and Henry IV declared King in his stead. But it was only a  seeming peacefulness, lasting but for a little while; for though King  Henry proved himself a just and a merciful man--as justice and mercy  went with the men of iron of those days--and though he did not care  to shed blood needlessly, there were many noble families who had been  benefited by King Richard during his reign, and who had lost somewhat of  their power and prestige from the coming in of the new King.    Among these were a number of great lords--the Dukes of Albemarle,  Surrey, and Exeter, the Marquis of Dorset, the Earl of Gloucester, and  others--who had been degraded to their former titles and estates, from  which King Richard had lifted them. These and others brewed a secret  plot to take King Henry's life, which plot might have succeeded had not  one of their own number betrayed them.    Their plan had been to fall upon the King and his adherents, and to  massacre them during a great tournament, to be held at Oxford. But Henry  did not appear at the lists; whereupon, knowing that he had been lodging  at Windsor with only a few attendants, the conspirators marched thither  against him. In the mean time the King had been warned of the plot,  so that, instead of finding him in the royal castle, they discovered  through their scouts that he had hurried to London, whence he was  even then marching against them at the head of a considerable army. So  nothing was left them but flight. Some betook themselves one way, some  another; some sought sanctuary here, some there; but one and another,  they were all of them caught and killed.    The Earl of Kent--one time Duke of Surrey--and the Earl of  Salisbury were beheaded in the market-place at Cirencester; Lord Le  Despencer--once the Earl of Gloucester--and Lord Lumley met the same  fate at Bristol; the Earl of Huntingdon was taken in the Essex fens,  carried to the castle of the Duke of Gloucester, whom he had betrayed  to his death in King Richard's time, and was there killed by the castle  people. Those few who found friends faithful and bold enough to afford  them shelter, dragged those friends down in their own ruin.    Just such a case was that of the father of the boy hero of this  story, the blind Lord Gilbert Reginald Falworth, Baron of Falworth and  Easterbridge, who, though having no part in the plot, suffered through  it ruin, utter and complete.    He had been a faithful counsellor and adviser to King Richard, and  perhaps it was this, as much and more than his roundabout connection  with the plot, that brought upon him the punishment he suffered.        CHAPTER 1    Myles Falworth was but eight years of age at that time, and it was only  afterwards, and when he grew old enough to know more of the ins and outs  of the matter, that he could remember by bits and pieces the things that  afterwards happened; how one evening a knight came clattering into the  court-yard upon a horse, red-nostrilled and smeared with the sweat and  foam of a desperate ride--Sir John Dale, a dear friend of the blind  Lord.    Even though so young, Myles knew that something very serious had  happened to make Sir John so pale and haggard, and he dimly remembered  leaning against the knight's iron-covered knees, looking up into his  gloomy face, and asking him if he was sick to look so strange. Thereupon  those who had been too troubled before to notice him, bethought  themselves of him, and sent him to bed, rebellious at having to go so  early.    He remembered how the next morning, looking out of a window high up  under the eaves, he saw a great troop of horsemen come riding into the  courtyard beneath, where a powdering of snow had whitened everything,  and of how the leader, a knight clad in black armor, dismounted and  entered the great hall door-way below, followed by several of the band.    He remembered how some of the castle women were standing in a frightened  group upon the landing of the stairs, talking together in low voices  about a matter he did not understand, excepting that the armed men who  had ridden into the courtyard had come for Sir John Dale. None of the  women paid any attention to him; so, shunning their notice, he ran off  down the winding stairs, expecting every moment to be called back again  by some one of them.    A crowd of castle people, all very serious and quiet, were gathered  in the hall, where a number of strange men-at-arms lounged upon the  benches, while two billmen in steel caps and leathern jacks stood  guarding the great door, the butts of their weapons resting upon the  ground, and the staves crossed, barring the door-way.    In the anteroom was the knight in black armor whom Myles had seen from  the window. He was sitting at the table, his great helmet lying upon  the bench beside him, and a quart beaker of spiced wine at his elbow. A  clerk sat at the other end of the same table, with inkhorn in one hand  and pen in the other, and a parchment spread in front of him.    Master Robert, the castle steward, stood before the knight, who every  now and then put to him a question, which the other would answer, and  the clerk write the answer down upon the parchment.    His father stood with his back to the fireplace, looking down upon the  floor with his blind eyes, his brows drawn moodily together, and the  scar of the great wound that he had received at the tournament at  York--the wound that had made him blind--showing red across his  forehead, as it always did when he was angered or troubled.    There was something about it all that frightened Myles, who crept to his  father's side, and slid his little hand into the palm that hung limp and  inert. In answer to the touch, his father grasped the hand tightly,  but did not seem otherwise to notice that he was there. Neither did  the black knight pay any attention to him, but continued putting his  questions to Master Robert.    Then, suddenly, there was a commotion in the hall without, loud voices,  and a hurrying here and there. The black knight half arose, grasping a  heavy iron mace that lay upon the bench beside him, and the next moment  Sir John Dale himself, as pale as death, walked into the antechamber. He  stopped in the very middle of the room. \"I yield me to my Lord's grace  and mercy,\" said he to the black knight, and they were the last words he  ever uttered in this world.    The black knight shouted out some words of command, and swinging up the  iron mace in his hand, strode forward clanking towards Sir John, who  raised his arm as though to shield himself from the blow. Two or three  of those who stood in the hall without came running into the room with  drawn swords and bills, and little Myles, crying out with terror, hid  his face in his father's long gown.    The next instant came the sound of a heavy blow and of a groan, then  another blow and the sound of one falling upon the ground. Then the  clashing of steel, and in the midst Lord Falworth crying, in a dreadful  voice, \"Thou traitor! thou coward! thou murderer!\"    Master Robert snatched Myles away from his father, and bore him out of  the room in spite of his screams and struggles, and he remembered just  one instant's sight of Sir John lying still and silent upon his face,  and of the black knight standing above him, with the terrible mace in  his hand stained a dreadful red.    It was the next day that Lord and Lady Falworth and little Myles,  together with three of the more faithful of their people, left the  castle.    His memory of past things held a picture for Myles of old Diccon Bowman  standing over him in the silence of midnight with a lighted lamp in his  hand, and with it a recollection of being bidden to hush when he would  have spoken, and of being dressed by Diccon and one of the women,  bewildered with sleep, shuddering and chattering with cold.    He remembered being wrapped in the sheepskin that lay at the foot of  his bed, and of being carried in Diccon Bowman's arms down the silent  darkness of the winding stair-way, with the great black giant shadows  swaying and flickering upon the stone wall as the dull flame of the lamp  swayed and flickered in the cold breathing of the night air.    Below were his father and mother and two or three others. A stranger  stood warming his hands at a newly-made fire, and little Myles, as he  peeped from out the warm sheepskin, saw that he was in riding-boots and  was covered with mud. He did not know till long years afterwards that  the stranger was a messenger sent by a friend at the King's court,  bidding his father fly for safety.    They who stood there by the red blaze of the fire were all very still,  talking in whispers and walking on tiptoes, and Myles's mother hugged  him in her arms, sheepskin and all, kissing him, with the tears  streaming down her cheeks, and whispering to him, as though he could  understand their trouble, that they were about to leave their home  forever.    Then Diccon Bowman carried him out into the strangeness of the winter  midnight.    Outside, beyond the frozen moat, where the osiers, stood stark and stiff  in their winter nakedness, was a group of dark figures waiting for them  with horses. In the pallid moonlight Myles recognized the well-known  face of Father Edward, the Prior of St. Mary's.    After that came a long ride through that silent night upon the  saddle-bow in front of Diccon Bowman; then a deep, heavy sleep, that  fell upon him in spite of the galloping of the horses.    When next he woke the sun was shining, and his home and his whole life  were changed.        CHAPTER 2    From the time the family escaped from Falworth Castle that midwinter  night to the time Myles was sixteen years old he knew nothing of the  great world beyond"]]]
