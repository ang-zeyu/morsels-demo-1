The idea of writing Mary Prince's history was first suggested by herself.  She wished it to be done, she said, that good people in England might hear  from a slave what a slave had felt and suffered; and a letter of her late  master's, which will be found in the Supplement, induced me to accede to  her wish without farther delay. The more immediate object of the  publication will afterwards appear.    The narrative was taken down from Mary's own lips by a lady who happened  to be at the time residing in my family as a visitor. It was written out  fully, with all the narrator's repetitions and prolixities, and afterwards  pruned into its present shape; retaining, as far as was practicable,  Mary's exact expressions and peculiar phraseology. No fact of importance  has been omitted, and not a single circumstance or sentiment has been  added. It is essentially her own, without any material alteration farther  than was requisite to exclude redundancies and gross grammatical errors,  so as to render it clearly intelligible.    After it had been thus written out, I went over the whole, carefully  examining her on every fact and circumstance detailed; and in all that  relates to her residence in Antigua I had the advantage of being assisted  in this scrutiny by Mr. Joseph Phillips, who was a resident in that colony  during the same period, and had known her there.    The names of all the persons mentioned by the narrator have been printed  in full, except those of Capt. I---- and his wife, and that of Mr. D----,  to whom conduct of peculiar atrocity is ascribed. These three individuals  are now gone to answer at a far more awful tribunal than that of public  opinion, for the deeds of which their former bondwoman accuses them; and  to hold them up more openly to human reprobation could no longer affect  themselves, while it might deeply lacerate the feelings of their surviving  and perhaps innocent relatives, without any commensurate public advantage.    Without detaining the reader with remarks on other points which will be  adverted to more conveniently in the Supplement, I shall here merely  notice farther, that the Anti-Slavery Society have no concern whatever  with this publication, nor are they in any degree responsible for the  statements it contains. I have published the tract, not as their  Secretary, but in my private capacity; and any profits that may arise from  the sale will be exclusively appropriated to the benefit of Mary Prince  herself.    THO. PRINGLE.    _7, Solly Terrace, Claremont Square_,    _January 25, 1831._      P. S. Since writing the above, I have been furnished by my friend Mr.  George Stephen, with the interesting narrative of Asa-Asa, a captured  African, now under his protection; and have printed it as a suitable  appendix to this little history.    T. P.          THE HISTORY OF MARY PRINCE, A WEST INDIAN SLAVE.    (Related by herself.)      I was born at Brackish-Pond, in Bermuda, on a farm belonging to Mr.  Charles Myners. My mother was a household slave; and my father, whose name  was Prince, was a sawyer belonging to Mr. Trimmingham, a ship-builder at  Crow-Lane. When I was an infant, old Mr. Myners died, and there was a  division of the slaves and other property among the family. I was bought  along with my mother by old Captain Darrel, and given to his grandchild,  little Miss Betsey Williams. Captain Williams, Mr. Darrel's son-in-law,  was master of a vessel which traded to several places in America and the  West Indies, and he was seldom at home long together.    Mrs. Williams was a kind-hearted good woman, and she treated all her  slaves well. She had only one daughter, Miss Betsey, for whom I was  purchased, and who was about my own age. I was made quite a pet of by Miss  Betsey, and loved her very much. She used to lead me about by the hand,  and call me her little nigger. This was the happiest period of my life;  for I was too young to understand rightly my condition as a slave, and too  thoughtless and full of spirits to look forward to the days of toil and  sorrow.    My mother was a household slave in the same family. I was under her own  care, and my little brothers and sisters were my play-fellows and  companions. My mother had several fine children after she came to Mrs.  Williams,--three girls and two boys. The tasks given out to us children  were light, and we used to play together with Miss Betsey, with as much  freedom almost as if she had been our sister.    My master, however, was a very harsh, selfish man; and we always dreaded  his return from sea. His wife was herself much afraid of him; and, during  his stay at home, seldom dared to shew her usual kindness to the slaves.  He often left her, in the most distressed circumstances, to reside in  other female society, at some place in the West Indies of which I have  forgot the name. My poor mistress bore his ill-treatment with great  patience, and all her slaves loved and pitied her. I was truly attached to  her, and, next to my own mother, loved her better than any creature in the  world. My obedience to her commands was cheerfully given: it sprung  solely from the affection I felt for her, and not from fear of the power  which the white people's law had given her over me.    I had scarcely reached my twelfth year when my mistress became too poor to  keep so many of us at home; and she hired me out to Mrs. Pruden, a lady  who lived about five miles off, in the adjoining parish, in a large house  near the sea. I cried bitterly at parting with my dear mistress and Miss  Betsey, and when I kissed my mother and brothers and sisters, I thought my  young heart would break, it pained me so. But there was no help; I was  forced to go. Good Mrs. Williams comforted me by saying that I should  still be near the home I was about to quit, and might come over and see  her and my kindred whenever I could obtain leave of absence from Mrs.  Pruden. A few hours after this I was taken to a strange house, and found  myself among strange people. This separation seemed a sore trial to me  then; but oh! 'twas light, light to the trials I have since  endured!--'twas nothing--nothing to be mentioned with them; but I was a  child then, and it was according to my strength.    I knew that Mrs. Williams could no longer maintain me; that she was fain  to part with me for my food and clothing; and I tried to submit myself to  the change. My new mistress was a passionate woman; but yet she did not  treat me very unkindly. I do not remember her striking me but once, and  that was for going to see Mrs. Williams when I heard she was sick, and  staying longer than she had given me leave to do. All my employment at  this time was nursing a sweet baby, little Master Daniel; and I grew so  fond of my nursling that it was my greatest delight to walk out with him  by the sea-shore, accompanied by his brother and sister, Miss Fanny and  Master James.--Dear Miss Fanny! She was a sweet, kind young lady, and so  fond of me that she wished me to learn all that she knew herself; and her  method of teaching me was as follows:--Directly she had said her lessons  to her grandmamma, she used to come running to me, and make me repeat them  one by one after her; and in a few months I was able not only to say my  letters but to spell many small words. But this happy state was not to  last long. Those days were too pleasant to last. My heart always softens  when I think of them.    At this time Mrs. Williams died. I was told suddenly of her death, and my  grief was so great that, forgetting I had the baby in my arms, I ran away  directly to my poor mistress's house; but reached it only in time to see  the corpse carried out. Oh, that was a day of sorrow,--a heavy day! All  the slaves cried. My mother cried and lamented her sore; and I (foolish  creature!) vainly entreated them to bring my dear mistress back to life. I  knew nothing rightly about death then, and it seemed a hard thing to bear.  When I thought about my mistress I felt as if the world was all gone  wrong; and for many days and weeks I could think of nothing else. I  returned to Mrs. Pruden's; but my sorrow was too great to be comforted,  for my own dear mistress was always in my mind. Whether in the house or  abroad, my thoughts were always talking to me about her.    I staid at Mrs. Pruden's about three months after this; I was then sent  back to Mr. Williams to be sold. Oh, that was a sad sad time! I recollect  the day well. Mrs. Pruden came to me and said, \"Mary, you will have to go  home directly; your master is going to be married, and he means to sell  you and two of your sisters to raise money for the wedding.\" Hearing this  I burst out a crying,--though I was then far from being sensible of the  full weight of my misfortune, or of the misery that waited for me.  Besides, I did not like to leave Mrs. Pruden, and the dear baby, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17855"],[0,"Hemp Hurds as Paper-Making Material (#1)"],[1,"Team at http://www.pgdp.net                UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE    =BULLETIN No. 404=    Contribution from the Bureau of Plant Industry WM.

Such an article was  prepared, therefore, and the two reports are here presented together.    [NOTE.--This bulletin should be useful to all persons who are interested  in the economic phases of paper making, especially to print and book  paper manufacturers. It also should be of interest to scientific  investigators and chemists.]          =THE PRODUCTION AND HANDLING OF HEMP HURDS.=    By LYSTER H. DEWEY, _Botanist in Charge of Fiber-Plant Investigations_.      =WHAT HEMP HURDS ARE.=    The woody inner portion of the hemp stalk, broken into pieces and  separated from the fiber in the processes of breaking and scutching, is  called hemp hurds. These hurds correspond to shives in flax, but are  much coarser and are usually softer in texture.    The hemp stalk grown in a broadcast crop for fiber production is from  one-eighth to three-eighths of an inch in diameter and from 4 to 10 feet  tall. The stalk is hollow, with a cylindrical woody shell, thick near  the base, where the stalk is nearly solid, and thinner above, where the  hollow is relatively wider.    In the process of breaking, the woody cylinder inside of the  fiber-bearing bark is broken into pieces one-half of an inch to 3 inches  long and usually split into numerous segments. The thicker lower  sections are split less than the thin-shelled upper ones, and they are  often left quite solid.      =PITH, WOOD, AND FIBER.=    The inner surface of the hurds usually bears a layer of pith, consisting  of thin-walled cells nearly spherical or angular, but not elongated.  They are more or less crushed and torn. They are probably of little  value for paper, but they constitute less than 1 per cent of the weight  of the hurds. The principal weight and bulk consist of slender elongated  woody cells. The outer surface is covered with fine secondary fibers  composed of slender elongated cells, tougher than those of the wood but  finer and shorter than those of the hemp fiber of commerce. No method  has been devised thus far which completely separates from the hurds all  of the long fiber. From 5 to 15 per cent of the weight of the hurds  consists of hemp fiber, in strands from 3 inches to 8 feet in length.  Some fragments of the bark, made up of short cubical cells, usually dark  in color, cling to the strands of fiber.      =CHARACTER OF HURDS AFFECTED BY RETTING.=    Nearly all of the hemp in the United States is dew retted. The stalks  are spread on the ground in swaths as grain is laid by the cradle. The  action of the weather, dew, and rain, aided by bacteria, dissolves and  washes out the green coloring matter (chlorophyll) and most of the gums,  leaving only the fibrous bark and the wood. The plants in this process  lose about 60 per cent of their green weight, or about 40 per cent of  their air-dry weight.    The stalks are sometimes set up in shocks to cure before retting, and  after retting they are set up in shocks to dry. Each time the stalks are  handled they are chucked down on the ground to keep the butts even. In  these operations sand and clay are often driven up into the hollow at  the base of the stalks, and this dirt, which often clings tenaciously,  may constitute all objectionable feature in the use of hemp hurds for  paper stock.    In Italy and in most localities in Russia and Austria-Hungary where hemp  is extensively cultivated, it is retted in water, but water retting has  never been practiced in the United States except to a limited extent  before the middle of the last century. Hurds from water-retted hemp are  cleaner and softer than those from dew-retted hemp.    The fiber is sometimes broken from dry hemp stalks without retting. The  hurds thus produced contain a small percentage of soluble gums, chiefly  of the pectose series. Comparatively little hemp is prepared in this  manner in America.    Process retting by means of weak solutions of chemicals or oils in hot  water is practiced to a limited extent. The hurds from these processes  may contain traces of the chemicals or oils and also soluble gums in  greater degree than those of the dew-retted or water-retted hemp.      =PROPORTION OF HURDS TO FIBER AND YIELD PER ACRE.=    [Illustration: FIG. 1.--Hemp-breaking machine. The stalks are fed  sidewise in a continuous layer 2 to 3 inches thick, turning out about  4,000 pounds of clean fiber per day and five times as much hurds.]    The yield of hemp fiber varies from 400 to 2,500 pounds per acre,  averaging 1,000 pounds under favorable conditions. The weight of hurds  is about five times that of the fiber, or somewhat greater from hemp  grown on peaty soils. A yield of 2-1/2 tons of hurds per acre may be taken  as a fair average.      =HURDS AVAILABLE FROM MACHINE-BROKEN HEMP.=    Hemp hurds are available only from hemp which is broken by machines,  when the hurds may be collected in quantity in one place (figs. 1 and  2). Most of the hemp in Kentucky is still broken by hand brakes. These  small brakes are moved from shock to shock, so that the hurds are  scattered all over the field in small piles of less than 50 pounds each,  and it is the common practice to set fire to them as soon as the brake  is moved. It would be difficult to collect them at a cost which would  permit their use for paper stock.    Where machine brakes are used, the hemp stalks are brought to the  machine as grain is brought to a thrashing machine, and the hurds  accumulate in large piles, being blown from the machine by wind  stackers.    Machine brakes are used in Wisconsin, Indiana, Ohio, and California, but  to only a limited extent in Kentucky. Five different kinds of machine  brakes are now in actual use in this country, and still others are used  in Europe. All of the best hemp in Italy, commanding the highest market  price paid for any hemp, is broken by machines. The better machine  brakes now in use in this country prepare the fiber better and much more  rapidly than the hand brakes, and they will undoubtedly be used in all  localities where hemp raising is introduced as a new industry. They may  also be used in Kentucky when their cost is reduced to more reasonable  rates, so that they may compete with the hand brake. Hemp-breaking  machines are being improved and their use is increasing. The  hemp-growing industry can increase in this country only as machine  brakes are developed to prepare the fiber. A profitable use for the  hurds will add an incentive to the use of the machine brake.      [Illustration: FIG. 2.--Machine brake and hemp hurds. Hemp hurds from  machine brakes quickly accumulate in large piles.]      =PRESENT USES OF HEMP HURDS.=    Hemp hurds are used to a limited extent for barnyard litter and stable  bedding, as a substitute for sawdust in packing ice, and, in rare  instances, for fuel. They are not regarded as having a commercial value  for any of these uses, though they are doubtless worth at least $1 per  ton on the farm when used for stable bedding. They are a waste product,  without value for other purposes which might compete with their use for  paper stock.      =PRESENT SUPPLIES OF HURDS AVAILABLE.=    During the last season, 1915, about 1,500 acres of hemp have been  harvested outside of Kentucky and in regions where machine brakes are  used. Estimating the yield of hurds at 2-1/2 tons per acre, this should  give a total quantity of about 3,750 tons. Large quantities of hemp from  the crop of 1914, which are still unbroken in these areas, and large  piles of hurds undisturbed where the machines have been used during the  last two or three years, increase the total to more than 7,000 tons.  Hemp is now grown outside of Kentucky in the vicinity of McGuffey, east  of Lima, Ohio; around Nappanee, Elkhart County, and near Pierceton, in  Kosciusko County, Ind.; about Waupun and Brandon, Wis.; and at Rio Vista  and Stockton,"]]]
