JOSEPH NOAD,         _Surveyor-General._           ST. JOHN'S, NEWFOUNDLAND:         R.J. PARSONS, PRINTER.           1859.          Lecture    _DELIVERED BEFORE THE MECHANICS' INSTITUTE AT ST. JOHN'S,  NEWFOUNDLAND._    BY    THE HON. JOSEPH NOAD,    _Surveyor-General,_      Of the various theories advanced on the origin of the North American  Indians, none has been so entirely satisfactory as to command a  general assent; and on this point many and different opinions are yet  held. The late De Witt Clinton, Governor of the State of New York, a  man who had given no slight consideration to subjects of this nature,  maintained that they were of Tatar origin; others have thought them  the descendants of the Ten Tribes, or the offspring of the Canaanites  expelled by Joshua. The opinion, however, most commonly entertained  is, that the vast continent of North America was peopled from the  Northeast of Asia; in proof of which it is urged that every  peculiarity, whether in person or disposition, which characterises the  Americans, bears some resemblance to the rude tribes scattered over  the northeast of Asia, but almost none to the nations settled on the  northern extremity of Europe. Robertson, however, gives a new phase to  this question; from his authority we learn that, as early as the ninth  century, the Norwegians discovered Greenland and planted colonies  there. The communication with that country, after a long interruption,  was renewed in the last century, and through Moravian missionaries, it  is now ascertained that the Esquimaux speak the same language as the  Greenlanders, and that they are in every respect the same people. By  this decisive fact, not only is the consanguinity of the Greenlanders  with the Esquimaux established, but also the possibility of peopling  America from the north of Europe demonstrated, and if of America, then  of course of Newfoundland also, and thus it appears within the verge  of possibility, that the original inhabitants of this Island may be  descendants of Europeans, in fact merely a distinct tribe of the  Esquimaux. At a meeting of the Philosophical Society held in England  some few years ago, the subject of the Red Indians of Newfoundland was  brought under discussion by Mr. Jukes, the gentleman who conducted the  geological survey of this Island; and Dr. King, a name well-known  among scientific men, gave it as his opinion, founded on historical  evidence, going so far back as the period of Sebastian Cabot, that  they were really an Esquimaux tribe. Others are of opinion, founded on  some real or presumed affinity between the vocabulary of the one  people with that of the other, that the Indian tribes of North America  and the original inhabitants of Newfoundland, called by themselves  \"Boeothicks,\" and by Europeans \"Red Indians,\" are of the same  descent.    The enquiry, however, into the mere origin of a people is one more  curious in its nature than it is calculated to be useful, and failure  in attempting to discover it need excite but little regret; but it is  much to be lamented that the early history of the Boeothick is  shrouded in such obscurity, that any attempt to penetrate it must be  vain. All that we know of the tribe as it existed in past ages, is  derived from tradition handed down to us chiefly thro' the Micmacs;  and even from this source, doubtful and uncertain as such authority  confessedly is, the amount of information conveyed to us is both  scanty and imperfect. From such traditionary facts we gather, that the  Boeothicks were once a powerful and numerous tribe, like their  neighbouring tribe the Micmacs, and that for a long period these  tribes were on friendly terms and inhabited the western shores of  Newfoundland in common, together with other parts of the Island as  well as the Labrador, and this good understanding continued until some  time after the discovery of Newfoundland by Cabot; but it was at  length violently interrupted by the Micmacs, who, to ingratiate  themselves with the French, who at that time held the sway in these  parts, and who had taken offence at some proceedings of the  Boeothicks, slew two Red Indians with the intention of taking their  heads, which they had severed from the bodies, to the French. This  wanton and unprovoked outrage was discovered by the Boeothicks, who  gave no intimation of such discovery, but who, after consulting  together, determined on revenge. They invited the Micmacs to a feast,  and arranged their guests in such order that every Boeothick had a  Micmac by his side; at a preconcerted signal every Boeothick slew his  guest. War of course ensued. Firearms were but little known to the  Indians at that time, but they soon came into more general use among  such tribes as continued to hold intercourse with Europeans. This  circumstance gave the Micmacs an undisputed ascendancy over the  Boeothicks, who were forced to betake themselves to the recesses of  the interior and other parts of the Island, alarmed, as well they  might be, at every report of the firelock. What may be the present  feelings of the Red Indians, supposing any of the tribe to be yet  living, towards the Micmacs we know not; but we do know that the  latter cherish feelings of unmitigated hatred against the very name of  \"Red Indian.\"    When Cabot discovered Newfoundland in 1497 he saw Savages, whom he  describes as \"painted with red ochre, and covered with skins.\" Cartier  in 1534 saw the Red Indians, whom he describes \"as of good  stature,--wearing their hair in a bunch on the top of the head, and  adorned with feathers.\" In 1574 Frobisher having been driven by the  ice on the coast of Newfoundland, induced some of the natives to come  on board, and with one of them he sent five sailors on shore, whom he  never saw again; on this account he seized one of the Indians, who  died shortly after arriving in England.    As soon after the discovery of Newfoundland as its valuable fisheries  became known, vessels from various countries found their way hither,  for the purpose of catching whales, and of following other pursuits  connected with the fishery. Among those early visiters was a Captain  Richard Whitburne, who commanded a ship of 300 tons, belonging to \"one  Master Cotton of South-hampton\" and who fished at Trinity. This  Captain Whitburne, in a work published by him in 1622, describing the  coast, fishery, soil, and produce of Newfoundland, says, \"the natives  are ingenious and apt by discreet and moderate government, to be  brought to obedience. Many of them join the French and Biscayans on  the Northern coast, and work hard for them about fish, whales, and  other things; receiving for their labor some bread or trifling  trinkets.\" They believed, according to Whitburne, that they were  created from arrows stuck in the ground by the Good Spirit, and that  the dead went into a far country to make merry with their friends.  Other early voyagers also make favourable mention of the natives, but  notwithstanding this testimony, it is evident, even from information  given by their apologist Whitburne himself, that the Red Indians were  not exempt from those pilfering habits which, in many instances, have  marked the conduct of the inhabitants of newly discovered Islands on  their first meeting with Europeans. Whitburne, when expressing his  readiness to adopt measures for opening a trade with the Indians,  incidentally mentions an instance where their thievish propensities  were displayed.--He says, \"I am ready with my life and means whereby  to find out some new trade with the Indians of the country, for they  have great store of red ochre, which they use to colour their bodies,  bows, arrows, and canoes. The canoes are built in shape like wherries  on the river Thames, but that they are much longer, made with the  rinds of birch trees, which they sew very artificially and close  together, and overlay every seam with turpentine. In like manner they  sew the rinds of birch trees round and deep in proportion like a brass  kettle, to boil their meat in; which hath been proved to me by three  mariners of a ship riding at anchor by me--who being robbed in the  night by the savages of their apparel and provisions, did next day  seek after and came suddenly to where they had set up three tents and  were feasting; they had three pots made of the rinds of trees standing  each of them on stones, boiling with fowls in each; they had also many  such pots so sewed, and which were full of yolk of eggs that they had  boiled hard and so dried, and which the savages do use in their broth.  They had great store of skins of deer, beaver, bears, otter, seal, and  divers other fine skins, which were well dressed; they had also great  store of several sorts of fish dried. By shooting off a musquet  towards them, they all ran away without any apparel but only their  hats on, which were made of seal skins, in fashion like our hats,  sewed handsomely with narrow bands and set round with fine white  shels. All the canoes, flesh, skins, yolks of eggs, bows, arrows, and  much fine ochre and divers other things did the ship's company take  and share among them.\" And from Whitburne's time up to 1818 have  complaints been made of thefts committed by the Indians. To the  Northward the settlers, as they allege, had many effects stolen from  them--one individual alone made a deposition to the effect that he had  lost through the depredations of the Indians, property to the amount  of L200.    Now whether in such thefts (although they were only of a petty  character) we are to trace the origin of that murderous warfare so  relentlessly"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15127"],[0,"Pitman's Commercial Spanish Grammar (2nd ed.)

PITMAN'S confidence in  entrusting me with the compilation of a Spanish Grammar to form part of  the series of \"Commercial Grammars,\" I set to work to produce a book  which, while avoiding pedantry and the agglomeration of superfluous and  intricate rules which puzzle the student, should equally avoid falling  into the extreme of coarseness which debases the subject under study, or  the scrappiness resulting in gaps that perplex and discourage him. I  have tried to be brief and clear in the rules given.    The vocabulary has been chosen carefully, avoiding the artificiality of  too much commercial technology, but keeping constantly in view the  object of the Series, viz., to produce grammars specially suitable for  students preparing for a commercial career.    Whether I have succeeded in my efforts it is for the public to judge. I  can only say that, after more than twenty-five years' teaching of  Spanish in all its stages, privately, at the Manchester University and  in the large classes of our public Institutions, I have tried my best to  give the fruits of my experience to any interested young people who may  be eager to learn a language beautiful, noble, and most useful.    I do not claim to have reached perfection. I only trust the book, such  as it presents itself, will be of real help to the student.    C.A. TOLEDANO.

A (_a_)     G (_ge_)     M (_eme_)   Rr (_erre_)  B (_be_)    H (_hache_)  N (_ene_)   S (_ese_)  C (_ce_)    I (_i_)      N (_ene_)   T (_te_)  Ch (_che_)  J (_jota_)   O (_o_)     U (_u_)  D (_de_)    K (_ka_)     P (_pe_)    V (_ve_)  E (_e_)     L (_ele_)    Q (_cu_)    X (_equis_)  F (_efe_)   Ll (_elle_)  R (_ere_)   Y (_y griega_ or _ye_)  Z (_zeta_)    K (_ka_) and W (_doble ve_) are only found in foreign words  used in Spanish.                             PRONUNCIATION OF VOWELS.    _a_ as English a in f_a_ther  _e_[1]   \"     a \"  f_a_te[2]  _i_      \"     i \"  magaz_i_ne  _o_[1]   \"     o \"  n_o_te[2]  _u_      \"     u \"  r_u_le    These five sounds _never_ vary, except that they are a little longer  when they are stressed and shorter when they are not, as Yo amo (I  love),[3] Amigo (friend), El cielo (heaven), Celeste (heavenly), Un  recibo (a receipt), Interes (interest), Yo como (I eat), Contar (to  count), Un buque (a ship), Una butaca (an armchair).    _Y_ is considered a vowel in the conjunction _y_ (and), and at the end  of a word, as Rey (king), Hoy (to-day).    [Footnote 1: _E_ and _o_ are sounded a little more open when they form  a diphthong with _i_ and when they precede _r_ followed by a consonant  or _r_ or _l_ final, as Fernando (Ferdinand), Un tercio (a third), El  tercer ano (the third year), Porfiar (to insist), Amor (love), Espanol  (Spanish).]    [Footnote 2: The _a_ and _o_ of \"fate\" and \"note\" are not _pure vowel  sounds_. In English the a is distinctly pronounced a-ee and o is  pronounced o-oo.    In Spanish the first part _only_ of the two sounds is permissible.]    [Footnote 3: The examples given with their English equivalents should be  learnt.                          DIPHTHONGS AND TRIPHTHONGS.    There are no Diphthongs or Triphthongs in the English sense of two or  three vowels meeting in one syllable and blending into a different  sound, as \"pause,\" \"plough.\"    Every vowel is pronounced separately and each with its alphabetical  sound, only the two or three vowels occurring in one syllable are  pronounced rapidly, as Pausa (pause), Reino (kingdom), Cuenta (account),  Buey (ox).    _A, E_ and _O_ never form diphthongs together. They may form diphthongs  and triphthongs only in combination with _I_ and _U_.                                  CONSONANTS.    The Consonants are pronounced as in English with the following  exceptions:    B is pronounced much more lightly than in English, with no pressure of  the lips, as Libro (book), Brevedad (brevity).    C before _E_ and _I_--_th_ in \"theatre,\" as La Cena (the supper), La  Cerveza (the beer). Otherwise pronounced _K_ as in English, as Caja  (case, box), Color (colour), Cubico (cubic).    Ch _always_ as _ch_ in \"church\" (never hard as in \"monarch\"), as  Chocolate (chocolate), Charla (prattle).    D at the end of a word or after a vowel is pronounced very softly and  lightly, with a tinge of _th_ in \"they,\" as Madrid, Amado (loved),  Encarnado (red).    G before _E_ and _I_ is pronounced guttural, as El general (the  general), El giro (the draft, bill). This sound is equal to _ch_ in the  Scotch word \"loch.\" In all other cases G is pronounced hard, as in the  English word \"gay\"; as Gato (cat), Gobierno (government), Gusto  (pleasure, taste).    H is a mute letter. (Although in Andalusia it is aspirated in certain  words.)    J is always guttural, as Juan (John), Jornalero (day labourer), Junio  (June), Reloj (watch, clock).    Ll--_ly_, stronger than _li_ in \"pavilion,\" as Belleza (beauty), Folleto  (leaflet).    N--ny, stronger than _ni_ in \"pinion,\" as Nino (child), Cana (cane), El  otono (autumn).    Q is only used before _ue_ and _ui_ (and the _u_ is then _mute_), as  Querido (dear, beloved), Yo quiero (I want).    R as in English, but it is always rolled, as Caro (dear, expensive),  Perdida (loss). At the beginning of a word or when preceded by a  consonant it is rolled more strongly, as La rosa (the rose), Deshonra  (dishonour).    Rr always rolled strongly, as Carro (cart), El ferrocarril (the  railway).    S always pronounced as _s_ in \"soap,\" and never as in \"as\" or \"sure.\"    T as in \"tea,\" but never as _t_ in \"nation.\" It must be pronounced  softly, not explosive, as Fortuna (fortune), Cuatro (four).    V is pronounced much more lightly than in English, as Vino (wine), Vivir  (to live). By the common people _V_ is often confounded with _B_, but  educated Spaniards will always make the proper distinction.    Y--Spanish _I_.    Z--_th_ in \"theatre,\" as Zarazas (cotton prints), Zorra (fox).    NOTE.--In modern Spanish Z is not used before _E_ or _I_, its place  being supplied by _C_.                          RULES ON PRONUNCIATION.    RULE I.--Every letter is pronounced. There are no mute letters as _b_ in  \"lamb\" or _n_ in \"autumn.\"    EXCEPTIONS--_H_ is not sounded as already explained in the alphabet. _U_  is not sounded in the following syllables: _que, qui, gue_ and _gui_, as  Quedar (to remain), Quinta (villa), Guerra (war), Aguila (eagle), unless  the _u_ in _gue_ and _gui_ has the diaeresis, as Argueir (to argue),  Vergueenza (shame).    RULE II.--No consonant is doubled except C and N. _C_ is found doubled  in words like Acceder (to accede) when one _C_ is hard--_k_ and the  other soft--_th_.    _N_ is found doubled in words having the prefix _in_, as Innoble  (ignoble), Innavegable (unnavigable). Also in Perenne (perennial) and a  very few more words.    _Ll_ and _Rr_ are treated as single letters.    RULE III.--The _stress of the voice_ falls on the last syllable but one  in all words ending in a vowel or _S_ or _N_; otherwise it falls on the  last syllable, as Una factura (an invoice), Facturas (invoices), Hermano  (brother), Cartas (letters), Ellos tienen (they have), Azul (blue),  Abril (April), Labor (labour), Feliz (happy).    In diphthongs and triphthongs the stress is not on _i_ or _u_, but falls  on _a_, _e_ or _o_, as Reina (queen), Gracia (grace), Igual (equal),  Cielo (heaven).    When the diphthong is formed by _i_ and _u_ the last one bears the  stress, as Un viudo (a widower), La ciudad (the city), Luisa (Louise).    The numerous exceptions to the above rule are all marked by the written  accent ('), as Facturo (he invoiced), Escribira (he will write), Hablame  (speak to me), Ingles (English), Aleman (German), Util (useful), Jovenes  (young men).    The stress of the voice should fall _distinctly_ on the proper syllable  according to the above rule, and the attention of the student must be  earnestly called to this very important point.    A word in the plural maintains the stress on the same syllable as in its  singular, as El oceano (the ocean), Oceanos (oceans), Calculo  (calculation), Calculos (calculations), Ingles (Englishman), Ingleses  (Englishmen); except Caracter (character), Caracteres (characters),  Regimen (regime or rule), Regimenes (regimes or rules)--the latter  hardly ever used in the plural.                                       SIGNS.                              The Written Accent.    The only accent in Spanish is ('). It is used--    (1) To mark the exceptions to the _Rule of Stress_.    (2) To distinguish between two meanings of the same word, as El (the),  El (he); De (of), Que el de (that he may give); Se (3rd person reflexive  pronoun, \"himself,\" etc.), Yo se (I know); Mas (more), Mas (but).    (3) In the following words established by use, as \"o\" or \"u\" (or),  \"e\" (and), \"a\" (to).[4]    (4) In some words when used interrogatively, as Quien? (who?), Que?  (what?), Cual? (which?), Cuyo? (whose?), Donde? (where?).    (5) On _I_ and _U_ when they occur together with _A, E_ or _O_, the _I_  or _U_ not belonging to the same syllable, viz., not forming diphthong  with _A, E_ or _O_, as Filosofia (philosophy), El continua (he  continues).    (6) On _I_ following _U_ when the _I_ does not form a diphthong, but  stands"]]]
