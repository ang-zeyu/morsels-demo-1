The rugged grandeur of the mountain, the solemn influence of the  widespreading moor, the dark face of the deep mountain loch, the babbling  of the little stream, seem all to be reflected in the popular tales and  superstitions.  The acquaintance with nature in a severe, grand, and  somewhat terrible form must necessarily have its effect on the human  mind, and the Scotch mind and character bear the impress of their natural  surroundings.  The fairies, the brownies, the bogles of Scotland are the  same beings as those with whom the Irish have peopled the hills, the  nooks, and the streams of their land, yet how different, how  distinguished from their counterparts, how clothed, as it were, in the  national dress!          CANOBIE DICK AND THOMAS OF ERCILDOUN.      Now it chanced many years since that there lived on the Borders a jolly  rattling horse-cowper, who was remarkable for a reckless and fearless  temper, which made him much admired and a little dreaded amongst his  neighbours.  One moonlight night, as he rode over Bowden Moor, on the  west side of the Eildon Hills, the scene of Thomas the Rhymer's  prophecies, and often mentioned in his history, having a brace of horses  along with him, which he had not been able to dispose of, he met a man of  venerable appearance and singularly antique dress, who, to his great  surprise, asked the price of his horses, and began to chaffer with him on  the subject.  To Canobie Dick, for so shall we call our Border dealer, a  chap was a chap, and he would have sold a horse to the devil himself,  without minding his cloven hoof, and would have probably cheated Old Nick  into the bargain.  The stranger paid the price they agreed on, and all  that puzzled Dick in the transaction was, that the gold which he received  was in unicorns, bonnet-pieces, and other ancient coins, which would have  been invaluable to collectors, but were rather troublesome in modern  currency.  It was gold, however, and therefore Dick contrived to get  better value for the coin than he perhaps gave to his customer.  By the  command of so good a merchant, he brought horses to the same spot more  than once; the purchaser only stipulating that he should always come by  night and alone.  I do not know whether it was from mere curiosity, or  whether some hope of gain mixed with it, but after Dick had sold several  horses in this way, he began to complain that dry bargains were unlucky,  and to hint, that since his chap must live in the neighbourhood, he  ought, in the courtesy of dealing, to treat him to half a mutchkin.    \"You may see my dwelling if you will,\" said the stranger; \"but if you  lose courage at what you see there, you will rue it all your life.\"    Dickon, however, laughed the warning to scorn, and having alighted to  secure his horse, he followed the stranger up a narrow footpath, which  led them up the hills to the singular eminence stuck betwixt the most  southern and the centre peaks, and called, from its resemblance to such  an animal in its form, the Lucken Hare.  At the foot of this eminence,  which is almost as famous for witch-meetings as the neighbouring windmill  of Kippilaw, Dick was somewhat startled to observe that his conductor  entered the hillside by a passage or cavern, of which he himself, though  well acquainted with the spot, had never seen nor heard.    \"You may still return,\" said his guide, looking ominously back upon him;  but Dick scorned to show the white feather, and on they went.  They  entered a very long range of stables; in every stall stood a coal-black  horse; by every horse lay a knight in coal-black armour, with a drawn  sword in his hand; but all were as silent, hoof and limb, as if they had  been cut out of marble.  A great number of torches lent a gloomy lustre  to the hall, which, like those of the Caliph Vathek, was of large  dimensions.  At the upper end, however, they at length arrived, where a  sword and horn lay on an antique table.    \"He that shall sound that horn and draw that sword,\" said the stranger,  who now intimated that he was the famous Thomas of Ercildoun, \"shall, if  his heart fail him not, be king over all broad Britain.  So speaks the  tongue that cannot lie.  But all depends on courage, and much on your  taking the sword or horn first.\"    Dick was much disposed to take the sword, but his bold spirit was quailed  by the supernatural terrors of the hall, and he thought to unsheathe the  sword first might be construed into defiance, and give offence to the  powers of the mountain.  He took the bugle with a trembling hand, and  blew a feeble note, but loud enough to produce a terrible answer.  Thunder  rolled in stunning peals through the immense hall; horses and men started  to life; the steeds snorted, stamped, ground their bits, and tossed their  heads; the warriors sprang to their feet, clashed their armour, and  brandished their swords.  Dick's terror was extreme at seeing the whole  army, which had been so lately silent as the grave, in uproar, and about  to rush on him.  He dropped the horn, and made a feeble attempt to seize  the enchanted sword; but at the same moment a voice pronounced aloud the  mysterious words--       \"Woe to the coward, that ever he was born,     Who did not draw the sword before he blew the horn!\"    At the same time a whirlwind of irresistible fury howled through the long  hall, bore the unfortunate horse-jockey clear out of the mouth of the  cavern, and precipitated him over a steep bank of loose stones, where the  shepherds found him the next morning, with just breath sufficient to tell  his fearful tale, after concluding which he expired.          COINNACH OER.      Coinnach Oer, which means Dun Kenneth, was a celebrated man in his  generation.  He has been called the Isaiah of the North.  The prophecies  of this man are very frequently alluded to and quoted in various parts of  the Highlands; although little is known of the man himself, except in  Ross-shire.  He was a small farmer in Strathpeffer, near Dingwall, and  for many years of his life neither exhibited any talents, nor claimed any  intelligence above his fellows.  The manner in which he obtained the  prophetic gift was told by himself in the following manner:--    As he was one day at work in the hill casting (digging) peats, he heard a  voice which seemed to call to him out of the air.  It commanded him to  dig under a little green knoll which was near, and to gather up the small  white stones which he would discover beneath the turf.  The voice  informed him, at the same time, that while he kept these stones in his  possession, he should be endued with the power of supernatural  foreknowledge.    Kenneth, though greatly alarmed at this aerial conversation, followed the  directions of his invisible instructor, and turning up the turf on the  hillock, in a little time discovered the talismans.  From that day  forward, the mind of Kenneth was illuminated by gleams of unearthly  light; and he made many predictions, of which the credulity of the  people, and the coincidence of accident, often supplied confirmation; and  he certainly became the most notable of the Highland prophets.
