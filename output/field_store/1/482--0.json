RELIGION AND MORALITY--CONCLUSION                         103          THE RELIGION OF ANCIENT ROME      CHAPTER I    INTRODUCTION--SOURCES AND SCOPE      The conditions of our knowledge of the native religion of early Rome  may perhaps be best illustrated by a parallel from Roman archaeology.  The visitor to the Roman Forum at the present day, if he wishes to  reconstruct in imagination the Forum of the early Republic, must not  merely 'think away' many strata of later buildings, but, we are told,  must picture to himself a totally different orientation of the whole:  the upper layer of remains, which he sees before him, is for his  purpose in most cases not merely useless, but positively misleading.  In the same way, if we wish to form a picture of the genuine Roman  religion, we cannot find it immediately in classical literature; we  must banish from our minds all that is due to the contact with the  East and Egypt, and even with the other races of Italy, and we must  imagine, so to speak, a totally different mental orientation before  the great influx of Greek literature and Greek thought, which gave  an entirely new turn to Roman ideas in general, and in particular  revolutionised religion by the introduction of anthropomorphic notions  and sensuous representations. But in this difficult search we are not  left without indications to guide us. In the writings of the savants of  the late Republic and of the Empire, and in the Augustan poets, biassed  though they are in their interpretations by Greek tendencies, there is  embodied a great wealth of ancient custom and ritual, which becomes  significant when we have once got the clue to its meaning. More direct  evidence is afforded by a large body of inscriptions and monuments, and  above all by the surviving Calendars of the Roman festival year, which  give us the true outline of the ceremonial observances of the early  religion.    It is not within the scope of this sketch to enter, except by way of  occasional illustration, into the process of interpretation by which  the patient work of scholars has disentangled the form and spirit of  the native religion from the mass of foreign accretions. I intend  rather to assume the process, and deal, as far as it is possible in so  controversial a subject, with results upon which authorities are  generally agreed. Neither will any attempt be made to follow the  development which the early religion underwent in later periods, when  foreign elements were added and foreign ideas altered and remoulded the  old tradition. We must confine ourselves to a single epoch, in which  the native Roman spirit worked out unaided the ideas inherited from  half-civilised ancestors, and formed that body of belief and ritual,  which was always, at least officially, the kernel of Roman religion,  and constituted what the Romans themselves--staunch believers in their  own traditional history--loved to describe as the 'Religion of Numa.'  We must discover, as far as we can, how far its inherited notions ran  parallel with those of other primitive religions, but more especially  we must try to note what is characteristically Roman alike in custom  and ritual and in the motives and spirit which prompted them.          CHAPTER II    THE 'ANTECEDENTS' OF ROMAN RELIGION      In every early religion there will of course be found, apart from  external influence, traces of its own internal development, of stages  by which it must have advanced from a mass of vague and primitive  belief and custom to the organised worship of a civilised community.  The religion of Rome is no exception to this rule; we can detect in its  later practice evidences of primitive notions and habits which it had  in common with other semi-barbarous peoples, and we shall see that the  leading idea in its theology is but a characteristically Roman  development of a marked feature in most early religions.    =1. Magic.=--Anthropology has taught us that in many primitive  societies religion--a sense of man's dependence on a power higher than  himself--is preceded by a stage of magic--a belief in man's own power  to influence by occult means the action of the world around him. That  the ancestors of the Roman community passed through this stage seems  clear, and in surviving religious practice we may discover evidence of  such magic in various forms. There is, for instance, what anthropology  describes as 'sympathetic magic'--the attempt to influence the powers  of nature by an imitation of the process which it is desired that they  should perform. Of this we have a characteristic example in the  ceremony of the _aquaelicium_, designed to produce rain after a long  drought. In classical times the ceremony consisted in a procession  headed by the pontifices, which bore the sacred rain-stone from its  resting-place by the Porta Capena to the Capitol, where offerings were  made to the sky-deity, Iuppiter, but[1] from the analogy of other  primitive cults and the sacred title of the stone (_lapis manalis_), it  is practically certain that the original ritual was the purely  imitative process of pouring water over the stone. A similar rain-charm  may possibly be seen in the curious ritual of the _argeorum sacra_,  when puppets of straw were thrown into the Tiber--a symbolic wetting of  the crops to which many parallels may be found among other primitive  peoples. A sympathetic charm of a rather different character seems to  survive in the ceremony of the _augurium canarium_, at which a red dog  was sacrificed for the prosperity of the crop--a symbolic killing of  the red mildew (_robigo_); and again the slaughter of pregnant cows at  the _Fordicidia_ in the middle of April, before the sprouting of the  corn, has a clearly sympathetic connection with the fertility of the  earth. Another prominent survival--equally characteristic of primitive  peoples--is the sacredness which attaches to the person of the  priest-king, so that his every act or word may have a magic  significance or effect. This is reflected generally in the Roman  priesthood, but especially in the ceremonial surrounding the _flamen  Dialis_, the priest of Iuppiter. He must appear always in festival  garb, fire may never be taken from his hearth but for sacred purposes,  no other person may ever sleep in his bed, the cuttings of his hair and  nails must be preserved and buried beneath an _arbor felix_--no doubt a  magic charm for fertility--he must not eat or even mention a goat or a  bean, or other objects of an unlucky character.    =2. Worship of Natural Objects.=--A very common feature in the early  development of religious consciousness is the worship of natural  objects--in the first place of the objects themselves and no more, but  later of a spirit indwelling in them. The distinction is no doubt in  individual cases a difficult one to make, and we find that among the  Romans the earlier worship of the object tends to give way to the cult  of the inhabiting spirit, but examples may be found which seem to  belong to the earlier stage. We have, for instance, the sacred stone  (_silex_) which was preserved in the temple of Iuppiter on the Capitol,  and was brought out to play a prominent part in the ceremony of  treaty-making. The fetial, who on that occasion represented the Roman  people, at the solemn moment of the oath-taking, struck the sacrificial  pig with the _silex_, saying as he did so, 'Do thou, Diespiter, strike  the Roman people as I strike this pig here to-day, and strike them the  more, as thou art greater and stronger.' Here no doubt the underlying  notion is not merely symbolical, but in origin the stone is itself the  god, an idea which later religion expressed in the cult-title specially  used in this connection, _Iuppiter Lapis_. So again, in all  probability, the _termini_ or boundary-stones between properties are in  origin the objects--though later only the site--of a yearly ritual at  the festival of the Terminalia on February the 23rd, and they are, as  it were, summed up in 'the god Terminus,' the great sacred  boundary-stone, which had its own shrine within the Capitoline temple,  because, according to the legend, 'the god' refused to budge even to  make room for Iuppiter. The same notion is most likely at the root of  the two great domestic cults of Vesta, 'the hearth,' and Ianus, 'the  door,' though a more spiritual idea was soon associated with them; we  may"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18571"],[0,"The Northmen, Columbus and Cabot, 985-1503 (#1)"],[1,"Transcriber's Note: A number of typographical errors in the original  text have been maintained in the current version of this book.

No part of this book  may be reproduced in any form without  the permission of Charles Scribner's Sons_          GENERAL PREFACE TO THE ORIGINAL NARRATIVES OF EARLY AMERICAN HISTORY      At its annual meeting in December, 1902, the American Historical  Association approved and adopted the plan of the present series, and the  undersigned was chosen as its general editor. The purpose of the series  was to provide individual readers of history, and the libraries of  schools and colleges, with a comprehensive and well-rounded collection of  those classical narratives on which the early history of the United  States is founded, or of those narratives which, if not precisely  classical, hold the most important place as sources of American history  anterior to 1700. The reasons for undertaking such a project are for the  most part obvious. No modern history, however excellent, can give the  reader all that he can get from the _ipsissima verba_ of the first  narrators, Argonauts or eyewitnesses, vivacious explorers or captains  courageous. There are many cases in which secondary narrators have quite  hidden from view these first authorities, whom it is therefore a duty to  restore to their rightful position. In a still greater number of  instances, the primitive narrations have become so scarce and expensive  that no ordinary library can hope to possess anything like a complete set  of the classics of early American history.    The series is to consist of such volumes as will illustrate the early  history of all the chief parts of the country, with an additional volume  of general index. The plan contemplates, not a body of extracts, but in  general the publication or republication of whole works or distinct parts  of works. In the case of narratives originally issued in some other  language than English, the best available translations will be used, or  fresh versions made. In a few instances, important narratives hitherto  unprinted will be inserted. The English texts will be taken from the  earliest editions, or those having the highest historical value, and will  be reproduced with literal exactness. The maps will be such as will give  real help toward understanding the events narrated in the volume. The  special editors of the individual works will supply introductions,  setting forth briefly the author's career and opportunities, when known,  the status of the work in the literature of American history, and its  value as a source, and indicating previous editions; and they will  furnish such annotations, scholarly but simple, as will enable the  intelligent reader to understand and to estimate rightly the statements  of the text. The effort has been made to secure for each text the most  competent editor.    The results of all these endeavors will be laid before the public in the  confident hope that they will be widely useful in making more real and  more vivid the apprehension of early American history. The general editor  would not have undertaken the serious labors of preparation and  supervision if he had not felt sure that it was a genuine benefit to  American historical knowledge and American patriotism to make accessible,  in one collection, so large a body of pioneer narrative. No subsequent  sources can have quite the intellectual interest, none quite the  sentimental value, which attaches to these early narrations, springing  direct from the brains and hearts of the nation's founders.    _Sacra recognosces annalibus eruta priscis._    J.
