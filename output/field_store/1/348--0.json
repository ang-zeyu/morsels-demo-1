To the sacred literature of the Brahmans, in the strict sense of the  term, i.e. to the Veda, there belongs a certain number of complementary  works without whose assistance the student is, according to Hindu  notions, unable to do more than commit the sacred texts to memory. In  the first place all Vedic texts must, in order to be understood, be read  together with running commentaries such as Saya/n/a's commentaries on  the Sa/m/hitas and Brahma/n/as, and the Bhashyas ascribed to Sa@nkara on  the chief Upanishads. But these commentaries do not by themselves  conduce to a full comprehension of the contents of the sacred texts,  since they confine themselves to explaining the meaning of each detached  passage without investigating its relation to other passages, and the  whole of which they form part; considerations of the latter kind are at  any rate introduced occasionally only. The task of taking a  comprehensive view of the contents of the Vedic writings as a whole, of  systematising what they present in an unsystematical form, of showing  the mutual co-ordination or subordination of single passages and  sections, and of reconciling contradictions--which, according to the  view of the orthodox commentators, can be apparent only--is allotted to  a separate sastra or body of doctrine which is termed Mima/m/sa, i.e.  the investigation or enquiry [Greek: kat ezochaen], viz. the enquiry  into the connected meaning of the sacred texts.    Of this Mima/m/sa two branches have to be distinguished, the so-called  earlier (purva) Mima/m/sa, and the later (uttara) Mima/m/sa. The former  undertakes to systematise the karmaka/nd/a, i.e. that entire portion of  the Veda which is concerned with action, pre-eminently sacrificial  action, and which comprises the Sa/m/hitas and the Brahma/n/as exclusive  of the Ara/n/yaka portions; the latter performs the same service with  regard to the so-called j/n/anaka/nd/a, i.e. that part of the Vedic  writings which includes the Ara/n/yaka portions of the Brahma/n/as, and  a number of detached treatises called Upanishads. Its subject is not  action but knowledge, viz. the knowledge of Brahman.    At what period these two /s/astras first assumed a definite form, we are  unable to ascertain. Discussions of the nature of those which constitute  the subject-matter of the Purva Mima/m/sa must have arisen at a very  early period, and the word Mima/m/sa itself together with its  derivatives is already employed in the Brahma/n/as to denote the doubts  and discussions connected with certain contested points of ritual. The  want of a body of definite rules prescribing how to act, i.e. how to  perform the various sacrifices in full accordance with the teaching of  the Veda, was indeed an urgent one, because it was an altogether  practical want, continually pressing itself on the adhvaryus engaged in  ritualistic duties. And the task of establishing such rules was moreover  a comparatively limited and feasible one; for the members of a certain  Vedic sakha or school had to do no more than to digest thoroughly their  own brahma/n/a and sa/m/hita, without being under any obligation of  reconciling with the teaching of their own books the occasionally  conflicting rules implied in the texts of other sakhas. It was assumed  that action, as being something which depends on the will and choice of  man, admits of alternatives, so that a certain sacrifice may be  performed in different ways by members of different Vedic schools, or  even by the followers of one and the same sakha.    The Uttara Mima/m/sa-/s/astra may be supposed to have originated  considerably later than the Purva Mima/m/sa. In the first place, the  texts with which it is concerned doubtless constitute the latest branch  of Vedic literature. And in the second place, the subject-matter of  those texts did not call for a systematical treatment with equal  urgency, as it was in no way connected with practice; the mental  attitude of the authors of the Upanishads, who in their lucubrations on  Brahman and the soul aim at nothing less than at definiteness and  coherence, may have perpetuated itself through many generations without  any great inconvenience resulting therefrom.    But in the long run two causes must have acted with ever-increasing  force, to give an impulse to the systematic working up of the teaching  of the Upanishads also. The followers of the different Vedic sakhas no  doubt recognised already at an early period the truth that, while  conflicting statements regarding the details of a sacrifice can be got  over by the assumption of a vikalpa, i.e. an optional proceeding, it is  not so with regard to such topics as the nature of Brahman, the relation  to it of the human soul, the origin of the physical universe, and the  like. Concerning them, one opinion only can be the true one, and it  therefore becomes absolutely incumbent on those, who look on the whole  body of the Upanishads as revealed truth, to demonstrate that their  teaching forms a consistent whole free from all contradictions. In  addition there supervened the external motive that, while the  karmaka/nd/a of the Veda concerned only the higher castes of  brahmanically constituted society, on which it enjoins certain  sacrificial performances connected with certain rewards, the  j/n/anaka/nd/a, as propounding a certain theory of the world, towards  which any reflecting person inside or outside the pale of the orthodox  community could not but take up a definite position, must soon have  become the object of criticism on the part of those who held different  views on religious and philosophic things, and hence stood in need of  systematic defence.    At present there exists a vast literature connected with the two  branches of the Mima/m/sa. We have, on the one hand, all those works  which constitute the Purva Mima/m/sa-/s/astra--or as it is often,  shortly but not accurately, termed, the Mima/m/sa-/s/astra--and, on the  other hand, all those works which are commonly comprised under the name  Vedanta-/s/astra. At the head of this extensive literature there stand  two collections of Sutras (i.e. short aphorisms constituting in their  totality a complete body of doctrine upon some subject), whose reputed  authors are Jainini and Badaraya/n/a. There can, however, be no doubt  that the composition of those two collections of Sutras was preceded by  a long series of preparatory literary efforts of which they merely  represent the highly condensed outcome. This is rendered probable by the  analogy of other /s/astras, as well as by the exhaustive thoroughness  with which the Sutras perform their task of systematizing the teaching  of the Veda, and is further proved by the frequent references which the  Sutras make to the views of earlier teachers. If we consider merely the  preserved monuments of Indian literature, the Sutras (of the two  Mima/m/sas as well as of other /s/astras) mark the beginning; if we,  however, take into account what once existed, although it is at present  irretrievably lost, we observe that they occupy a strictly central  position, summarising, on the one hand, a series of early literary  essays extending over many generations, and forming, on the other hand,  the head spring of an ever broadening activity of commentators as well  as virtually independent writers, which reaches down to our days, and  may yet have some future before itself.    The general scope of the two Mima/m/sa-sutras and their relation to the  Veda have been indicated in what precedes. A difference of some  importance between the two has, however, to be noted in this connexion.  The systematisation of the karmaka/nd/a of the Veda led to the  elaboration of two classes of works, viz. the Kalpa-sutras on the one  hand, and the Purva Mima/m/sa-sutras on the other hand. The former give  nothing but a description as concise as possible of the sacrifices  enjoined in the Brahma/n/as; while the latter discuss and establish the  general principles which the author of a Kalpa-sutra has to follow, if  he wishes to render his rules strictly conformable to the teaching of  the Veda. The j/n/anaka/nd/a of the Veda, on the other hand, is  systematised in a single work, viz. the Uttara Mima/m/sa or  Vedanta-sutras, which combine the two tasks of concisely stating the  teaching of the Veda, and of argumentatively establishing the special  interpretation of the Veda adopted in the Sutras. This difference may be  accounted for by two reasons. In the first place, the contents of the  karmaka/nd/a, as being of an entirely practical nature, called for  summaries such as the Kalpa-sutras, from which all burdensome  discussions of method are excluded; while there was no similar reason  for the separation of the two topics in the case of the purely  theoretical science of Brahman. And, in the second place, the  Vedanta-sutras throughout presuppose the Purva Mima/m/sa-sutras, and may  therefore dispense with the discussion of general principles and methods  already established in the latter.    The time at which the two Mima/m/sa-sutras were composed we are at  present unable to fix with any certainty;"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16331"],[0,"New York Times Current History: The European War from the Beginning to March (#1)"],[1,"[Transcriber's Note:  Table of Contents and List of Illustrations  have been compiled by the transcriber.]      CURRENT HISTORY: THE EUROPEAN WAR      FROM THE BEGINNING TO MARCH 1915      \"WHO BEGAN THE WAR, AND WHY?\"                 *       *       *       *       *    Published by the _New York Times_           *       *       *       *       *          TABLE OF CONTENTS.             *       *       *       *       *    WHO BEGAN THE WAR, AND WHY?

A fateful hour has fallen for Germany.         Envious peoples everywhere are compelling us to our just defense.         The sword is being forced into our hand. I hope that if my efforts       at the last hour do not succeed in bringing our opponents to see       eye to eye with us and in maintaining peace we shall with God's       help so wield the sword that we shall restore it to its sheath       again with honor.         War would demand enormous sacrifices of blood and property from the       German people, but we should show our enemies what it means to       provoke Germany.         And now I commend you to God. Go to church. Kneel down before God       and pray for His help for our gallant Army.             *       *       *       *       *                 *       *       *       *       *          FORGIVES ENEMIES.

Honored Sirs: It is in an hour fraught with fate that I have       assembled about me all the representatives of the German people.       For almost half a century we have been able to keep to the path of       peace. The attempts to attribute a warlike temperament to Germany       and to circumscribe its position in the world have often put to       severe tests the patience of our people. With unswerving honesty,       my Government, even in provoking circumstances, has pursued as its       highest aim the development of all moral, spiritual, and economic       powers. The world has been witness how tirelessly we strove in the       first rank during the pressure and confusion of the last few years       to spare the nations of Europe a war between the great powers.         The very grave dangers which had arisen owing to the events in the       Balkans appeared to have been overcome, but then the murder of my       friend, the Archduke Francis Ferdinand, opened up a great abyss. My       high ally, the Emperor and King Francis Joseph, was compelled to       take up arms to defend the security of his empire against dangerous       intrigues from a neighboring State. In the pursuit of her proper       interests the Dual Monarchy has found her path obstructed by the       Russian Empire. Not only our duty as an ally calls us to the side       of Austria-Hungary, but on us falls also the mighty task of       defending the ancient community of culture of the two kingdoms and       our own position in the world against the attack of hostile powers.       With a heavy heart I have been compelled to mobilize my army       against a neighbor with whom it has fought side by side on so many       fields of battle. With sincere sorrow I saw a friendship broken of       which Germany had given faithful proofs. The Imperial Russian       Government, yielding to the pressure of an insatiable nationalism,       "]]]
