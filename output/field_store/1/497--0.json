By the fast Channel steamers, however, touching at  Cherbourg and Havre, one may make the trip in less time (rail journey  included). In going to Rome, four days could thus be saved; but the  expense will be greater--perhaps forty per cent.                   ... \"and now, fair Italy!    Thou art the garden of the world, the home    Of all Art yields, and Nature can decree;    Even in thy desert, what is like to thee?    Thy very weeds are beautiful, thy waste    More rich than other climes' fertility;    Thy wreck a glory, and thy ruin graced    With an immaculate charm which can not be defaced.\"    At least four civilizations, and probably five, have dominated Italy;  together they cover a period of more than 3,000 years--Pelasgian,  Etruscan, Greek, Roman, Italian. Of these the Pelasgian is, in the main,  legendary. Next came the Etruscan. How old that civilization is no man  knows, but its beginnings date from at least 1000 B.C.--that is, earlier  than Homer's writings, and earlier by nearly three centuries than the  wall built by Romulus around Rome. The Etruscan state was a federation  of twelve cities, embracing a large part of central and northern  Italy--from near Naples as far north perhaps as Milan and the great  Lombard plain. Etruscans thus dominated the largest, and certainly the  fairest, parts of Italy. Before Rome was founded, the Etruscan cities  were populous and opulent commonwealths. Together they formed one of the  great naval powers of the Mediterranean. Of their civilization, we have  abundant knowledge from architectural remains, and, from thousands of  inscriptions still extant. Cortona was one of their oldest towns. \"Ere  Troy itself arose, Cortona was.\"    After the Etruscans, came Greeks, who made flourishing settlements in  southern Italy, the chief of which was Paestum, founded not later than  600 B.C. Stupendous ruins survive at Paestum; few more interesting ones  have come down to us from the world of ancient Hellas. The oldest dates  from about 570 B.C. Here was once the most fertile and beautiful part  of Italy, celebrated for its flowers so that Virgil praised them. It is  now a lonely and forsaken land, forbidding and malarious. Once thickly  populated, it has become scarcely more than a haunt of buffalos and  peasants, who wander indifferent among these colossal remains of a  vanished race. These, however, are not the civilizations that do most  attract tourists to Italy, but the remains found there of ancient Rome.  Of that empire all modern men are heirs--heirs of her marvelous  political structure, of her social and industrial laws.    Last of these five civilizations is the Italian, the beginnings of which  date from Theodoric the Goth, who in the fifth century set up a kingdom  independent of Rome; but Gothic rule was of short life, and then came  the Lombards, who for two hundred years were dominant in northern and  central parts, or until Charlemagne grasped their tottering kingdom and  put on their famous Iron Crown. In the south Charlemagne's empire never  flourished. That part of Italy was for centuries the prey of Saracens,  Magyars and Scandinavians. From these events emerged modern Italy--the  rise of her vigorous republics, Pisa, Genoa, Florence, Venice; the  dawn, meridian splendor and decline of her great schools of sculpture,  painting and architecture, the power and beauty of which have held the  world in subjection; her literature, to which also the world has become  a willing captive; her splendid municipal spirit; a Church, whose  influence has circled the globe, and in which historians, in a spiritual  sense, have seen a survival of Imperial Rome. But here are tales that  every schoolboy hears.    Sicily is reached in a night by steamer from Naples to Palermo, or the  tourist may go by train from Naples to Reggio, and thence by ferry  across the strait to Messina. Its earliest people were contemporaries of  the Etruscans. Phoenicians also made settlements there, as they did in  many parts of the Mediterranean, but these were purely commercial  enterprises. Real civilization in Sicily dates from neither of those  races, but from Dorian and Ionic Greeks, who came perhaps as early as  the founding of Rome--that is, in the seventh or eighth century B.C. The  great cities of the Sicilian Greeks were Syracuse, Segesta and Girgenti,  where still survive colossal remains of their genius. In military and  political senses, the island for 3,000 years has been overrun,  plundered and torn asunder by every race known to Mediterranean waters.  Beside those already named, are Carthaginians under Hannibal, Vandals  under Genseric, Goths under Theodoric, Byzantines under Belisarius,  Saracens from Asia Minor, Normans under Robert Guiscard, German emperors  of the thirteenth century, French Angevine princes (in whose time came  the Sicilian Vespers), Spaniards of the house of Aragon, French under  Napoleon, Austrians of the nineteenth century, and then--that glorious  day when Garibaldi transferred it to the victorious Sardinian king.    The tourist who seeks Greece from northern Europe may go from Trieste by  steamer along the Dalmatian coast (in itself a trip of fine surprizes),  to Cattaro and Corfu, transferring to another steamer for the Piraeus,  the port of Athens; or from Italy by steamer direct from Brindisi, the  ancient Brundusium, whence sailed all Roman expeditions to the East, and  where in retirement once dwelt Cicero. No writer has known where to date  the beginnings of civilization in Greece, but with Mycenae, Tiryns, and  the Minoan palace of Crete laid bare, antiquarians have pointed the way  to dates far older than anything before recorded. The palace of Minos  is ancient enough to make the Homeric age seem modern. With the Dorian  invasion of Greece about 1000 B.C., begins that Greek civilization of  which we have so much authentic knowledge. Dorian influence was confined  largely to Sparta, but it spread to many Greek colonies in the central  Mediterranean and in the Levant. It became a powerful influence, alike  in art, in domestic life, and in political supremacy. One of its noblest  achievements was its help in keeping out the Persian, and another in  supplanting in the Mediterranean the commercial rule of Phoenicians.  Attica and Sparta became world-famous cities, with stupendous  achievements in every domain of human art and human efficiency. The  colossal debt all Europe and all America owe them, is known to everyone  who has ever been to school.                                                                  F. W. H.

This water-logged world combined  all the most unattractive features of a steam bath and one could only  dream of coolness, greenness--more land than a stingy string of islands.    The young man on the promontory above the crash of the waves wore the  winged cap of a spaceman with the insignia of a cargo-master and not  much else, save a pair of very short shorts. He wiped one hand absently  across his bare chest and brought it away damp as he studied, through  protective sun goggles, the treacherous promise of the bright sea. One  _could_ swim--if he wanted to lose most of his skin. There were minute  organisms in that liquid that smacked their lips--if they had  lips--every time they thought of a Terran.    Dane Thorson licked his own lips, tasting salt, and plodded back through  the sand of the spaceport to the berth of the _Solar Queen_. This had  been a long day, and one with more snarl-ups than he cared to count,  keeping him on a constant, dogged trot between the ship and the fitting  yard where riggers labored with the slowest motions possible to the  human body--or so it seemed to the exasperated acting-Cargo-Master of  the Free Trader. Captain Jellico had long ago taken refuge in his cabin  to preserve the remnants of his temper. Dane had been allowed no such  escape.    The _Queen_ had a schedule for refitting to serve as a mail ship, and  that time allowance did not allow for humidity playing the devil with  the innards of robot fitters. She _had_ to be ready to lift when the  Combine ship now plying that run set down and formally signed off in her  favor. Luckily, most of the work was done and Dane had given a last  searching inspection before signing the rigger's book and reporting to  his captain.    The air-conditioned interior of the _Queen_ comforted him as he climbed  to his quarters. Ship air was flat, chemically pure but unappetizing  stuff. Today it was a relief to breathe. Dane went on to the bather. At  least there was no lack of water--with the local skinners filtered out.  It was chill but relaxing on his gaunt young body.    He was sealing on his lightest tunic when the ramp buzzer sounded. A  visitor--oh, not the supervisor-rigger again! Dane went to answer with  dragging feet. For the crew of the _Queen_ at the moment numbered  exactly four, with himself for general errand boy. Captain Jellico was  in his quarters two levels above, Medic Tau was presumably overhauling  his supplies, and Sindbad, ship's cat, asleep in some empty cabin.    Dane jerked his tunic into place, very much on his guard as he came to  the head of the ramp. But it was not the supervisor-rigger. Dane,  thoroughly used to unusual-appearing strangers, both human and alien,  was impressed by this visitor.    He was tall, this quiet man, his great height accented by a fit  leanness, a narrowness of waist and hip, a length of leg and arm. His  main article of clothing was the universal shorts of the Xecho settler.  But, being fashioned of saffron yellow, they were the more brilliant  because of his darkness of skin. For he was not the warm brown of the  Terran Negroes Dane had served beside, though he shared their general  features. His flesh was really black, black with an almost bluish sheen.  Instead of shirt or tunic, his deep chest was crossed by two wide  straps, the big medallion marking their intersection giving forth  flashes of gem fire when he breathed. He wore at his belt not the  standard stun gun of a spaceman, but a weapon which resembled the more  deadly Patrol blaster, as well as a long knife housed in a jeweled and  fringed sheath. To the eye he was an example of barbaric force tamed  and trimmed to civilized efficiency.    He saluted, palm out, and spoke Galactic Basic with only a suggestion of  accent.    \"I am Kort Asaki. I believe Captain Jellico expects me.\"    \"Yes, sir!\" Dane snapped to attention. So this was the Chief Ranger from  fabulous Khatka, Xecho's sister planet.    The other ascended the cat ladder easily, missing no detail of the  ship's interior as he passed. His expression was still one of polite  interest as his guide rapped on the panel door of Jellico's cabin. And a  horrible screech from Queex, the captain's pet hoobat, drowned out any  immediate answer. Then followed that automatic thump on the floor of the  blue-feathered, crab-parrot-toad's cage, announcing that its master was  in residence.    Since the captain's cordial welcome extended only to his guest, Dane  regretfully descended to the mess cabin to make unskilled preparations  for supper--though there was not much you could do to foul up  concentrates in an automatic cooker.    \"Company?\" Tau sat beyond the cooking unit nursing a mug of Terran  coffee. \"And do you _have_ to serve music with the meals, especially  that particular selection?\"    Dane flushed, stopped whistling in mid-note. \"Terra Bound\" _was_ old  and pretty well worn out; he didn't know why he always unconsciously  sounded off with that.    \"A Chief Ranger from Khatka just came on board,\" he reported, carefully  offhand, as he busied himself reading labels. He knew better than to  serve fish or any of its derivatives in disguise again.    \"Khatka!\" Tau sat up straighter. \"Now there's a planet worth visiting.\"    \"Not on a Free Trader's pay,\" commented Dane.    \"You can always hope to make a big strike, boy. But what I wouldn't give  to lift ship for there!\"    \"Why? You're no hunter. How come you want to heat jets for that port?\"    \"Oh, I don't care about the game preserves, though they're worth seeing,  too. It's the people themselves--\"    \"But they're Terran settlers, or at least from Terran stock, aren't  they?\"    \"Sure,\" Tau sipped his coffee slowly. \"But there are settlers and  settlers, son. And a lot depends upon when they left Terra and why, and  who they were--also what happened to them after they landed out here.\"    \"And Khatkans are really special?\"    \"Well, they have an amazing history. The colony was founded by escaped  prisoners--and just one racial stock. They took off from Earth close to  the end of the Second Atomic War. That was a race war, remember? Which  made it doubly ugly.\" Tau's mouth twisted in disgust. \"As if the color  of a man's skin makes any difference in what lies under it! One side in  that line-up tried to take over Africa--herded most of the natives into  a giant concentration camp and practiced genocide on a grand scale. Then  they were cracked themselves, hard and heavy. During the confusion some  survivors in the camp staged a revolt, helped by the enemy. They  captured an experimental station hidden in the center of the camp and  made a break into space in two ships which had been built there. That  voyage must have been a nightmare, but they were desperate. Somehow they  made it out here to the rim and set down on Khatka without power enough  to take off again--and by then most of them were dead.    \"But we humans, no matter what our race, are a tough breed. The refugees  discovered that climatically their new world was not too different from  Africa, a lucky chance which might happen only once in a thousand times.  So they thrived, the handful who survived. But the white technicians  they had kidnaped to run the ships didn't. For they set up a color bar  in reverse. The lighter your skin, the lower you were in the social  scale. By that kind of selective breeding the present Khatkans are very  dark indeed.    \"They reverted to the primitive for survival. Then, about two hundred  years ago, long before the first Survey Scout discovered them, something  "]]]
