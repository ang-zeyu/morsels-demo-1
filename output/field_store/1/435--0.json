The fiery energy of his youthful career, and  the magnificent progress of his irresistible ambition, have invested his  character with the mysterious grandeur of some heavenly appearance; and  when all the lesser tumults and lesser men of our age shall have passed  away into the darkness of oblivion, history will still inscribe one  mighty era with the majestic name of Napoleon.\"    These enthusiastic words, too, are Lockhart's, though they are not from  this history, but from some \"Remarks on the Periodical Criticism of  England,\" which he published in _Blackwood's Magazine_. They serve, if  they are taken in conjunction with his book, to mark his position in the  long list of the historians, biographers and critics who have written in  English, and from an English or a British point of view, upon \"Napoleon  the Great.\" Lockhart, that is to say, was neither of the idolaters, like  Hazlitt, nor of the decriers and blasphemers.    One recalls at once what he said of \"the lofty impartiality\" with which  Sir Walter Scott had written of Napoleon before him, and with which he  appears to have faced his lesser task. As a biography, as a writing of  history, as an example of historic style, Lockhart's comparatively  modest essay must be called a better performance than Scott's. But \"the  real Napoleon\" has not yet been painted.    Lord Rosebery, in his book on _Napoleon: the Last Phase_, asks if there  will ever be an adequate portrait? The life is yet to be written that  shall profit by all the new material that has come to light since Scott  wrote his nine volumes in 1827, and Lockhart published his in 1829. But  Lockhart's book has still the value of one written by a genuine man of  letters, who was a born biographer, and one written while the  world-commotion of Napoleon was a matter of personal report. It is  tinged by some of the contemporary illusions, no doubt; but it is  clearer in its record than Scott's, and while it is less picturesque, it  is more direct.    His comparative brevity is a gain, since he has to tell how, in brief  space, \"the lean, hungry conqueror swells,\" as Lord Rosebery says, \"into  the sovereign, and then into the sovereign of sovereigns.\"    In view of the influence of the one book upon the other, and the one  writer upon the other, it is worth note that Lockhart had a fit of  enthusiasm over Scott's _Napoleon_ when it first appeared, or rather  when he first read the first six volumes of the work, before they were  \"out,\" in 1827. He thought Scott would make as great an effect by it as  by any two of his novels. This proved a mistaken forecast, but Scott was  paid an enormous price--some eighteen thousand pounds. When then John  Murray, who had already co-opted Lockhart as his _Quarterly_ editor,  thought of inaugurating a \"Family Library,\" and he proposed to his  editor this other Napoleon book, it must have seemed in many ways a very  attractive piece of work. But owing partly to Lockhart's relations with  Scott, and partly to the need of avoiding any literary comparisons,  these small, fat duodecimos appeared anonymously. That was, as it has  been already mentioned, in 1829, two years after Scott's book.    To-day, it makes a capital starting-point for the long Napoleon  adventure, whose end, so far as it is prolonged by fresh literary  divigations, seems to be as remote as ever.    It is from the French side that one might chiefly draw those vivid and  sometimes questionable glimpses at first-hand, that can best add to  Lockhart's presentment. One must compare his retreat from Russia with  Rapp's and other remembrancers' accounts, and be reminded by Rapp to go  on to Jomini's _Vie Militaire_, and even turn for a single personal  reminiscence to a flagrant hero-worshipper like Dumas, in his rapid and  military biography.    \"Only twice in his life,\" said Dumas, \"had he who writes these lines  seen Napoleon. The first time on the way to Ligny; the second, when he  returned from Waterloo. The first time in the light of a lamp; the first  time amid the acclamations of the multitude; the second, amid the  silence of a populace. Each time Napoleon was seated in the same  carriage, in the same seat, dressed in the same attire; each time, it  was the same look, lost and vague; each time, the same head, calm and  impassible, only his brow was a little more bent over his breast in  returning than in going. Was it from weariness that he could not sleep,  or from grief to have lost the world?\"    This is the French postscript to many English books about the victor and  loser of the world.           *       *       *       *       *    The following is a list of the works of John Gibson Lockhart  (1794-1854):--    Peter's Letters to his Kinsfolk, by Peter Morris the Odontist (pseud.)  1819; Valerius, a Roman Story, 1821; Some Passages in the Life of Mr.  Adam Blair, 1822; Reginald Dalton, a Story of English University Life,  1823; Ancient Spanish Ballads (trans.) 1823; Matthew Wald, a Novel,  1824; Life of Robert Burns, 1828; History of Napoleon Buonaparte, 1829;  History of the late War, with Sketches of Nelson, Wellington and  Napoleon, 1832; Memoirs of the Life of Sir Walter Scott, 7 vols. 1836-8;  Theodore Hook, a Sketch, 1852.    Lockhart was a Contributor to \"Blackwood,\" and Editor of the \"Quarterly  Review\" from 1825 to 1853.

Napoleon Buonaparte was born at Ajaccio on the 15th of August, 1769. The  family had been of some distinction, during the middle ages, in Italy;  whence his branch of it removed to Corsica, in the troubled times of the  Guelphs and Gibellines. They were always considered as belonging to the  gentry of the island. Charles, the father of Napoleon, an advocate of  considerable reputation, married his mother, Letitia Ramolini, a young  woman eminent for beauty and for strength of mind, during the civil  war--when the Corsicans, under Paoli, were struggling to avoid the  domination of the French. The advocate had espoused the popular side in  that contest, and his lovely and high-spirited wife used to attend him  through the toils and dangers of his mountain campaigns. Upon the  termination of the war, he would have exiled himself along with Paoli;  but his relations dissuaded him from this step, and he was afterwards  reconciled to the conquering party, and protected and patronised by the  French governor of Corsica, the Count de Marboeuff.    It is said that Letitia had attended mass on the morning of the 15th of  August; and, being seized suddenly on her return, gave birth to the  future hero of his age, on a temporary couch covered with tapestry,  representing the heroes of the Iliad. He was her second child. Joseph,  afterwards King of Spain, was older than he: he had three younger  brothers, Lucien, Louis, and Jerome; and three sisters, Eliza, Caroline,  and Pauline. These grew up. Five others must have died in infancy; for  we are told that Letitia had given birth to thirteen children, when at  the age of thirty she became a widow.    In after-days, when Napoleon had climbed to sovereign power, many  flatterers were willing to give him a lofty pedigree. To the Emperor of  Austria, who would fain have traced his unwelcome son-in-law to some  petty princes of Treviso, he replied, \"I am the Rodolph of my race,\"[1]  and silenced, on a similar occasion, a professional genealogist, with,  \"Friend, my patent dates from Monte Notte.\"[2]    Charles Buonaparte, by the French governor's kindness, received a legal  appointment in Corsica--that of _Procureur du Roi_ (answering nearly to  Attorney-General); and scandal has often said that Marboeuff was his  wife's lover. The story received no credence in Ajaccio.    Concerning the infancy of Napoleon we know nothing, except that he ever  acknowledged with the warmest gratitude the obligations laid on him, at  the threshold of life by the sagacity and wisdom of Letitia. He always  avowed his belief that he owed his subsequent elevation principally to  her early lessons; and indeed laid it down as a maxim that \"the future  good or bad conduct of a child depends entirely on the mother.\" Even of  his boyish days few anecdotes have been preserved in Corsica. His chosen  plaything, they say, was a small brass cannon; and, when at home in the  school-vacations, his favourite retreat was a solitary summer-house  among the rocks on the sea-shore, about a mile from Ajaccio, where his  mother's brother (afterwards Cardinal Fesch) had a villa. The place is  now in ruins, and overgrown with bushes, and the people call it  \"Napoleon's Grotto.\" He has himself said that he was remarkable only for  obstinacy and curiosity: others add, that he was high-spirited,  quarrelsome, imperious; fond of solitude; slovenly in his dress. Being  detected stealing figs in an orchard, the proprietor threatened to tell  his mother, and the boy pleaded for himself with so much eloquence, that  the man suffered"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17587"],[0,"Field Hospital and Flying Column (#1)"],[1,"made available by Internet Archive/Canadian Libraries  (http://www.archive.org/details/toronto)        Note: Project Gutenberg also has an HTML version of this        file which includes the original illustrations.

For me the beginning of the war was a torchlight tattoo  on Salisbury Plain. It was held on one of those breathless evenings in  July when the peace of Europe was trembling in the balance, and when  most of us had a heartache in case--_in case_ England, at this time of  internal crisis, did not rise to the supreme sacrifice.    It was just the night for a tattoo--dark and warm and still. Away across  the plain a sea of mist was rolling, cutting us off from the outside  world, and only a few pale stars lighted our stage from above.    The field was hung round with Chinese lanterns throwing weird lights and  shadows over the mysterious forms of men and beasts that moved therein.  It was fascinating to watch the stately entrance into the field,  Lancers, Irish Rifles, Welsh Fusiliers, Grenadiers and many another  gallant regiment, each marching into the field in turn to the swing of  their own particular regimental tune until they were all drawn up in  order.    There followed a very fine exhibition of riding and the usual torchlight  tricks, and then the supreme moment came. The massed bands had thundered  out the first verse of the Evening Hymn, the refrain was taken up by a  single silver trumpet far away--a sweet thin almost unearthly note more  to be felt than heard--and then the bands gathered up the whole melody  and everybody sang the last verse together.    The Last Post followed, and then I think somehow we all knew.           *       *       *       *       *    A week later I had a telegram from the Red Cross summoning me to London.    London was a hive of ceaseless activity. Territorials were returning  from their unfinished training, every South Coast train was crowded with  Naval Reserve men who had been called up, every one was buying kits,  getting medical comforts, and living at the Army and Navy Stores. Nurses  trained and untrained were besieging the War Office demanding to be  sent to the front, Voluntary Aid Detachment members were feverishly  practising their bandaging, working parties and ambulance classes were  being organized, crowds without beginning and without end were surging  up and down the pavements between Westminster and Charing Cross, wearing  little flags, buying every half-hour edition of the papers and watching  the stream of recruits at St. Martin's. All was excitement--no one knew  what was going to happen. Then the bad news began to come through from  Belgium, and every one steadied down and settled themselves to their  task of waiting or working, whichever it might happen to be.    I was helping at the Red Cross Centre in Vincent Square, and all day  long there came an endless procession of women wanting to help, some  trained nurses, many--far too many--half-trained women; and a great many  raw recruits, some anxious for adventure and clamouring \"to go to the  front at once,\" others willing and anxious to do the humblest service  that would be of use in this time of crisis.    Surely after this lesson the Bill for the State Registration of Trained  Nurses cannot be ignored or held up much longer. Even now in this  twentieth century, girls of twenty-one, nurses so-called with six  months' hospital training, somehow manage to get out to the front,  blithely undertaking to do work that taxes to its very utmost the skill,  endurance, and resource of the most highly trained women who have given  up the best years of their life to learning the principles that underlie  this most exacting of professions. For it is not only medical and  surgical nursing that is learnt in a hospital ward, it is discipline,  endurance, making the best of adverse circumstances, and above all the  knowledge of mankind. These are the qualities that are needed at the  front, and they cannot be imparted in a few bandaging classes or  instructions in First Aid.    This is not a diatribe against members of Voluntary Aid Detachments.  They do not, as a rule, pretend to be what they are not, and I have  found them splendid workers in their own department. They are not  half-trained nurses but fully trained ambulance workers, ready to do  probationer's work under the fully trained sisters, or if necessary to  be wardmaid, laundress, charwoman, or cook, as the case may be. The  difficulty does not lie with them, but with the women who have a few  weeks' or months' training, who blossom out into full uniform and call  themselves Sister Rose, or Sister Mabel, and are taken at their own  valuation by a large section of the public, and manage through influence  or bluff to get posts that should only be held by trained nurses, and  generally end by bringing shame and disrepute upon the profession.           *       *       *       *       *    The work in the office was diversified by a trip to Faversham with some  very keen and capable Voluntary Aid Detachment members, to help  improvise a temporary hospital for some Territorials who had gone sick.  And then my turn came for more active service. I was invited by the St.  John Ambulance to take out a party of nurses to Belgium for service  under the Belgian Red Cross Society.    Very little notice was possible, everything was arranged on Saturday  afternoon of all impossible afternoons to arrange anything in London,  and we were to start for Brussels at eight o'clock on Tuesday morning.    On Monday afternoon I was interviewing my nurses, saying good-bye  to friends--shopping in between--wildly trying to get everything  I wanted at the eleventh hour, when suddenly a message came  to say that the start would not be to-morrow after all. Great  excitement--telephones--wires--interviews. It seemed that there  was some hitch in the arrangements at Brussels, but at last it  was decided by the St. John's Committee that I should go over  alone the next day to see the Belgian Red Cross authorities before  the rest of the party were sent off. The nurses were to follow the  day after if it could be arranged, as having been all collected in  London, it was very inconvenient for them to be kept waiting long.    Early Tuesday morning saw me at Charing Cross Station. There were not  many people crossing--two well-known surgeons on their way to Belgium,  Major Richardson with his war-dogs, and a few others. A nurse going to  Antwerp, with myself, formed the only female contingent on board. It was  asserted that a submarine preceded us all the way to Ostend, but as I  never get further than my berth on these occasions, I cannot vouch for  the truth of this.    Ostend in the middle of August generally means a gay crowd of bathers,  Cook's tourists tripping to Switzerland and so on; but our little party  landed in silence, and anxious faces and ominous whispers met us on our  arrival on Belgian soil. It was even said that the Germans were marching  on Brussels, but this was contradicted afterwards as a sensational  canard. The Red Cross on my luggage got me through the _douane_  formalities without any trouble. I entered the almost empty train and we  went to Brussels without stopping.    At first sight Brussels seemed to be _en fete_, flags were waving from  every window, Boy Scouts were everywhere looking very important, and the  whole population seemed to be in the streets. Nearly every one wore  little coloured flags or ribbons--a favourite badge was the Belgian  colours with the English and French intertwined. It did not seem  possible that war could be so near, and yet if one looked closer one saw  that many of the flags giving such a gay appearance were Red Cross  flags denoting that there an ambulance had been prepared for the  wounded, and the Garde Civile in their picturesque uniform were  constantly breaking up the huge crowds into smaller groups to avoid a  demonstration.    The first thing to arrange was about the coming of my nurses, whether  they were really needed and if so where they were to go. I heard from  the authorities that it was highly probable that Brussels _would_ be"]]]
