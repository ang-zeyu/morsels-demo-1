HILLEGAS      AUTHOR OF \"OOM PAUL'S PEOPLE,\" AND CORRESPONDENT OF  \"THE NEW YORK WORLD\"      WITH TWENTY-THREE ILLUSTRATIONS AND A PLAN      METHUEN & CO.  36 ESSEX STREET W.C.  LONDON  1900      [Illustration: COMMANDANT-GENERAL LOUIS BOTHA]          PREFACE      In the following pages I have endeavoured to present an accurate picture  of the Boers in war-time. My duties as a newspaper correspondent carried  me to the Boer side, and herein I depict all that I saw. Some parts of my  narrative may not be pleasing to the British reader; others may offend the  sensibilities of the Boer sympathisers. I have written truthfully, but  with a kindly spirit and with the intention of presenting an unbiased  account of the struggle as it was unfolded to the view from the Boer side.  I shall be criticised, no doubt, for extolling certain virtues of the  Boers, but it must be noticed that their shortcomings are not neglected in  these lines.    In referring to Boer deeds of bravery I do not mean to insinuate that all  British soldiers were cowards any more than I mean to imply that all Boers  were brave, but any man who has been with armies will acknowledge that  bravery is not the exclusive property of the peoples of one nation. The  Boers themselves had thousands of examples of the bravery of their  opponents, and it was not an extraordinary matter to hear burghers express  their admiration of deeds of valour by the soldiers of the Queen. The  burghers, it may be added, were not bitter enemies of the British soldiers,  and upon hundreds of occasions they displayed the most friendly feeling  toward members of the Imperial forces. The Boer respected the British  soldier's ability, but the same respect was not vouchsafed to the British  officer, and it was not unreasonable that a burgher should form such an  opinion of the leaders of his enemy, for the mistakes of many of the  British officers were so frequent and costly that the most unmilitary man  could easily discern them. On that account the Boers' respect for the  British soldier was not without its mixture of pity.    There are those who will assert that there was no goodness in the Boers and  that they conducted the war unfairly, but I shall make no attempt to deny  any of the statements on those subjects. My sympathies were with the Boers,  but they were not so strong that I should tell untruths in order to whiten  the Boer character. There were thieves among them--I had a horse and a pair  of field-glasses stolen from me on my first journey to the front--but that  does not prove that all the Boers were wicked. I spent many weeks with  them, in their laagers, commandos, and homes, and I have none but the  happiest recollections of my sojourn in the Boer country. The generals and  burghers, from the late Commandant-General Joubert to the veriest Takhaar,  were extremely courteous and agreeable to me, and I have nothing but praise  for their actions. In all my experiences with them I never saw one maltreat  a prisoner or a wounded man, but, on the contrary, I observed many of their  acts of kindness and mercy to their opponents.    I have sought to eliminate everything which might have had a bearing on  the causes of the war, and in that I think I have succeeded. In my former  book, dealing with the Boers in peaceful times, I gave my impressions of  the political affairs of the country, and a closer study of the subject  has not caused me to alter my opinions. Three years before the war began,  I wrote what has been almost verified since--        \"The Boers will be able to resist and to prolong the campaign for      perhaps eight months or a year, but they will finally be obliterated      from among the nations of the earth. It will cost the British Empire      much treasure and many lives, but it will satisfy those who caused it,      the South African politicians and speculators.\"    The first part of the prediction has been realised, but at the present  time there is no indication that the Boer nation will be extinguished so  completely or so suddenly, unless the leaders of the burghers yield to  their enemy's forces before all their powers and means of resistance have  been exhausted. If they will continue to fight as men who struggle for the  continued existence of their country and government should fight, and as  they have declared they will go on with the war, then it will be three  times eight months or three times a year before peace comes to South  Africa. Presidents Kruger and Steyn have declared that they will continue  the struggle for three years, and longer if necessary. De Wet will never  yield as long as he has fifty burghers in his commando, and Botha will  fight until every British soldier has been driven from South African soil.  Hundreds of the burghers have made even firmer resolutions to continue the  war until their cause is crowned with victory. There may be some among  them who fought and are fighting because they despise Britons and British  rule, but the vast majority are on commando because they firmly believe  that Great Britain is attempting to take their country and their  government from them by the process of theft which we enlightened  Anglo-Saxons of America and England are wont to style \"benevolent  assimilation.\" They feel that they have the right to govern their country  in accordance with their own ideas of justice and equality, and,  naturally, they will continue to fight until they are victorious, or might  asserts itself over their conception of right. If they have the power to  make Great Britain feel that their cause is just, as our forefathers in  America did a hundred years ago, then the Boers have vindicated themselves  and their actions in their own eyes and in the eyes of the world. If they  lack in the patriotism which men who fight for the life of their country  usually possess, then the Boers of South Africa will be exterminated from  among the nations of the world and no one will offer any sympathy to them.    We Anglo-Saxons of America and Great Britain have a habit of calling our  enemies by names which would arouse the fighting blood of the most  peaceable individual, and when there is a Venezuelan question to be  discussed we do not hesitate to practice this custom, born of our  blood-alliance, by making each other the subjects of the vituperative  attacks. During the Spanish-American war we made most uncomplimentary  remarks concerning our short-lived enemy, and more recently we have been  emphasising the vices of our _proteges_, the Filipinos, with a scornful  disregard of their virtues. The Boers, however, have had a greater burden  to bear. They have had cast at them the shafts of British vituperation and  the lyddite of American venom. In a few instances the lyddite was far more  harrowing than the shafts, and in the vast majority of instances both were  born of ignorance. There are unclean, uncouth, and unregenerate Boers, and  I doubt whether any one will stultify himself by declaring that there are  none such of Britons and Americans. I have been among the Boers in times  of peace and in times of war, and I have always failed to see that they  were in any degree lower than the men of like rank or occupation in  America or England. The farmers in Rustenburg probably never saw a dress  suit or a _decollete_ gown, but there are innumerable regions in America  and Great Britain where similarly dense ignorance prevails. I have been in  scores of American and British homes which were not more spotlessly clean  than some of the houses on the veld in which it was my pleasure to find a  night's entertainment, and nowhere, except in my own home, have I ever  been treated with more courtesy than that which was extended to me, a  perfect stranger, in scores of daub and wattle cottages in the Free State  and the Transvaal. I will not declare that every Boer is a saint, or that  every one is a model of cleanliness or virtue, but I make bold to say that  the majority of the Boers are not a fraction less moral, cleanly, or  virtuous than the majority of Americans or Englishmen, albeit they may be  less progressive and less handsome in appearance than we imagine ourselves  to be.    As I have stated, the politics of the war has found no part in the  following pages, and an honest effort has been made to give an impartial  account of the proceedings as they unfolded themselves before the eyes of  an American. The struggle is one which was brought about by the  politicians, but it will probably be ended by the layman who wields a  sword, and who knows nothing of the intricacies of diplomacy. The Boers  desire to gain nothing but their countries' independence; the British have  naught to lose except thousands of valuable lives if they continue in  their determination to erase the two nations. Unless the Boers soon decide  to end the war voluntarily, the real struggle will only begin when the  Imperial forces enter the mountainous region in the north-eastern part of  the Transvaal, and then General Lucas Meyer's prophecy that the bones of  one hundred thousand British soldiers will lay bleaching on the South  African veld before the British are victorious may be more than realised.    One word more. The English public is generous, and will not forget that  the Boers are fighting in the noblest of all causes--the independence of  their country. If Englishmen will for a moment place themselves in the  position of the Boers, if they will imagine their own country overrun by  hordes of foreign soldiers, their own inferior forces gradually driven  back to the wilds of Wales and Scotland, they will be able to picture to  themselves the feelings of the men whom they are hunting to death. Would  Englishmen in these circumstances give up the struggle? They would not;  they would fight to the end.                                                        HOWARD C. HILLEGAS.

To the majority of English readers the name of that strange and  forceful personality, Romain Rolland, is known only through his  magnificent, intimate record of an artist's life and aspirations,  embracing ten volumes, _Jean-Christophe_. This is not the place in which  to discuss that masterpiece. A few biographical facts concerning the  author may not, however, be out of place here.    Romain Rolland is forty-eight years old. He was born on January 29,  1866, at Clamecy (Nievre), France. He came very early under the  influence of Tolstoy and Wagner and displayed a remarkable critical  faculty. In 1895 (at the age of twenty-nine) we find him awarded the  coveted Grand Prix of the Academie Francaise for his work _Histoire de  l'Opera en Europe avant Lulli et Scarlatti_, and in the same year he  sustained, before the faculty of the Sorbonne--where he now occupies the  chair of musical criticism--a remarkable dissertation on _The Origin  of_ _the Modern Lyrical Drama_--his thesis for the Doctorate. This, in  reality, is a vehement protest against the indifference for the Art of  Music which, up to that time, had always been displayed by the  University. In 1903 he published a remarkable _Life of Beethoven_,  followed by a _Life of Hugo Wolf_ in 1905. The present volume, together  with its companion, _Musiciens d'Autrefois_, appeared in 1908. Both  form remarkable essays and reveal a consummate and most intimate  knowledge of the life and works of our great contemporaries. A just  estimate of a composer's work is not to be arrived at without a study of  his works and of the conditions under which these were produced. To  take, for instance, the case of but one of the composers treated in this  volume, Hector Berlioz. No composer has been so misunderstood, so  vilified as he, simply because those who have written about him, either  wilfully or through ignorance, have grossly misrepresented him.    The essay on Berlioz, in the present volume, reveals a true insight into  the personality of this unfortunate and great artist, and removes any  false misconceptions which unsympathetic and superficial handling may  have engendered. Indeed, the same introspective faculty is displayed in  all the other essays which form this volume, which, it is believed, will  prove of the greatest value not only to the professional student, but  also to the _intelligent listener_, for whom the present series of  volumes has been primarily planned. We hear much, nowadays, of the value  of \"Musical Appreciation.\" It is high time that something was done to  educate our audiences and to dispel the hitherto prevalent fallacy that  Music need not be regarded seriously. We do not want more creative  artists, more executants; the world is full of them--good, bad and  indifferent--but we _do_ want more _intelligent listeners_.    I do not think it is an exaggeration to assert that the majority of  listeners at a high-class concert or recital are absolutely bored. How  can it be otherwise, when the composers represented are mere names to  them? Why should the general public appreciate a Bach fugue, an  intricate symphony or a piece of chamber-music? Do we professional  musicians appreciate the technique of a wonderful piece of sculpture, of  an equally wonderful feat of engineering or even of a miraculous  surgical operation? It may be argued that an analogy between sculpture,  engineering, surgery and music is absurd, because the three former do  not appeal to the masses in the same manner as music does. Precisely: it  is because of this universal appeal on the part of music that the public  should be educated to _listen_ to _good_ music; that they should be  given, in a general way, a chance to acquaint themselves with the laws  underlying the \"Beautiful in Music\" and should be shown the demands  which a right appreciation of the Art makes upon the Intellect and the  Emotions.    And, surely, such a \"desideratum\" may best be effected by a careful  perusal of the manuals to be included in the present series. It is  incontestable that the reader of the following pages--apart from a  knowledge of the various musical forms, of orchestration, etc.--all of  which will be duly treated in successive volumes--will be in a better  position to appreciate the works of the several composers to which he  may be privileged to listen. The last essay, especially, will be read  with interest to-day, when we may hope to look forward to a cessation of  race-hatred and distrust, and to what a writer in the _Musical Times_  (September, 1914) has called, \"a new sense of the emotional solidarity  of mankind. From that sense alone,\" he adds, \"can the real music of the  future be born.\"         CLAUDE LANDI.          MUSICIANS OF TO-DAY    BERLIOZ    I      It may seem a paradox to say that no musician is so little known as  Berlioz. The world thinks it knows him. A noisy fame surrounds his  person and his work. Musical Europe has celebrated his centenary.  Germany disputes with France the glory of having nurtured and shaped his  genius. Russia, whose triumphal reception consoled him for the  indifference and enmity of Paris,[1] has said, through the voice of  Balakirew, that he was \"the only musician France possessed.\" His chief  compositions are often played at concerts; and some of them have the  rare quality of appealing both to the cultured and the crowd; a few have  even reached great popularity. Works have been dedicated to him, and he  himself has been described and criticised by many writers. He is popular  even to his face; for his face, like his music, was so striking and  singular that it seemed to show you his character at a glance. No clouds  hide his mind and its creations, which, unlike Wagner's, need no  initiation to be understood; they seem to have no hidden meaning, no  subtle mystery; one is instantly their friend or their enemy, for the  first impression is a lasting one.    [Footnote 1: \"And you, Russia, who have saved me....\" (Berlioz,  _Memoires_, II, 353, Calmann-Levy's edition, 1897).]    That is the worst of it; people imagine that they understand Berlioz  with so very little trouble. Obscurity of meaning may harm an artist  less than a seeming transparency; to be shrouded in mist may mean  remaining long misunderstood, but those who wish to understand will at  least be thorough in their search for the truth. It is not always  realised how depth and complexity may exist in a work of clear design  and strong contrasts--in the obvious genius of some great Italian of the  Renaissance as much as in the troubled heart of a Rembrandt and the  twilight of the North.    That is the first pitfall; but there are many more that will beset us in  the attempt to understand Berlioz. To get at the man himself one must  break down a wall of prejudice and pedantry, of convention and  intellectual snobbery. In short, one must shake off nearly all current  ideas about his work if one wishes to extricate it from the dust that  has drifted about it for half a century.    Above all, one must not make the mistake of contrasting Berlioz with  Wagner, either by sacrificing Berlioz to that Germanic Odin, or by  forcibly trying to reconcile one to the other. For there are some who  condemn Berlioz in the name of Wagner's theories; and others who, not  liking the sacrifice, seek to make him a forerunner of Wagner, or kind  of elder brother, whose mission was to clear a way and prepare a road  for a genius greater than his own. Nothing is falser. To understand  Berlioz one must shake off the hypnotic influence of Bayreuth. Though  Wagner may have learnt something from Berlioz, the two composers have  nothing in common; their genius and their art are absolutely opposed;  each one has ploughed his furrow in a different field.    The Classical misunderstanding is quite as dangerous. By that I mean the  clinging to superstitions of the past, and the pedantic desire to  enclose art within narrow limits, which still flourish among critics.  Who has not met these censors of music? They will tell you with solid  complacence how far music may go, and where it must stop, and what it  may express and what it must not. They are not always musicians  themselves. But what of that? Do they not lean on the example of the  past? The past! a handful of works that they themselves hardly  understand. Meanwhile, music, by its unceasing growth, gives the lie to  their theories, and breaks down these weak barriers. But they do not see  it, do not wish to see it; since they cannot advance themselves, they  deny progress. Critics of this kind do not think favourably of Berlioz's  dramatic and descriptive symphonies. How should they appreciate the  boldest musical achievement of the nineteenth century? These dreadful  pedants and zealous defenders of an art that they only understand after  it has ceased to live are the worst enemies of unfettered genius, and  may do more harm than a whole army of ignorant people. For in a country  like ours, where musical education is poor, timidity is great in the  presence of a strong, but only half-understood, tradition;"]]]
