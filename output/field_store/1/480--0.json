Fire notice is posted on tree.]          PRESENTATION      The joyous, exhilarating call of the wilderness and the forest camp is  surely and steadily penetrating through the barriers of brick, stone,  and concrete; through the more or less artificial life of town and city;  and the American girl is listening eagerly. It is awakening in her  longings for free, wholesome, and adventurous outdoor life, for the  innocent delights of nature-loving Thoreau and bird-loving Burroughs.  Sturdy, independent, self-reliant, she is now demanding outdoor books  that are genuine and filled with practical information; books that tell  how to do worth-while things, that teach real woodcraft and are not  adapted to the girl supposed to be afraid of a caterpillar or to shudder  at sight of a harmless snake.    In answer to the demand, \"On the Trail\" has been written. The authors'  deep desire is to help girls respond to this new, insistent call by  pointing out to them the open trail. It is their hope and wish that  their girl readers may seek the charm of the wild and may find the same  happiness in the life of the open that the American boy has enjoyed  since the first settler built his little cabin on the shores of the New  World. To forward this object, the why and how, the where and when of  things of camp and trail have been embodied in this book.    Thanks are due to Edward Cave, president and editor of _Recreation_, for  kindly allowing the use of some of his wild-life photographs.
