DEDICATION.    TO THE    NOBLEMEN AND GENTLEMEN    OF THE    CALEDONIAN HUNT.          [On the title-page of the second or Edinburgh edition, were these  words: \"Poems, chiefly in the Scottish Dialect, by Robert Burns,  printed for the Author, and sold by William Creech, 1787.\" The motto  of the Kilmarnock edition was omitted; a very numerous list of  subscribers followed: the volume was printed by the celebrated  Smellie.]      MY LORDS AND GENTLEMEN:    A Scottish Bard, proud of the name, and whose highest ambition is to  sing in his country's service, where shall he so properly look for  patronage as to the illustrious names of his native land: those who  bear the honours and inherit the virtues of their ancestors? The  poetic genius of my country found me, as the prophetic bard Elijah did  Elisha--at the PLOUGH, and threw her inspiring mantle over  me. She bade me sing the loves, the joys, the rural scenes and rural  pleasures of my native soil, in my native tongue; I tuned my wild,  artless notes as she inspired. She whispered me to come to this  ancient metropolis of Caledonia, and lay my songs under your honoured  protection: I now obey her dictates.    Though much indebted to your goodness, I do not approach you, my Lords  and Gentlemen, in the usual style of dedication, to thank you for past  favours: that path is so hackneyed by prostituted learning that honest  rusticity is ashamed of it. Nor do I present this address with the  venal soul of a servile author, looking for a continuation of those  favours: I was bred to the plough, and am independent. I come to claim  the common Scottish name with you, my illustrious countrymen; and to  tell the world that I glory in the title. I come to congratulate my  country that the blood of her ancient heroes still runs  uncontaminated, and that from your courage, knowledge, and public  spirit, she may expect protection, wealth, and liberty. In the last  place, I come to proffer my warmest wishes to the great fountain of  honour, the Monarch of the universe, for your welfare and happiness.    When you go forth to waken the echoes, in the ancient and favourite  amusement of your forefathers, may Pleasure ever be of your party: and  may social joy await your return! When harassed in courts or camps  with the jostlings of bad men and bad measures, may the honest  consciousness of injured worth attend your return to your native  seats; and may domestic happiness, with a smiling welcome, meet you at  your gates! May corruption shrink at your kindling indignant glance;  and may tyranny in the ruler, and licentiousness in the people,  equally find you an inexorable foe!    I have the honour to be,    With the sincerest gratitude and highest respect,    My Lords and Gentlemen,    Your most devoted humble servant,    ROBERT BURNS.    EDINBURGH, _April 4, 1787._          PREFACE.      I cannot give to my country this edition of one of its favourite  poets, without stating that I have deliberately omitted several pieces  of verse ascribed to Burns by other editors, who too hastily, and I  think on insufficient testimony, admitted them among his works. If I  am unable to share in the hesitation expressed by one of them on the  authorship of the stanzas on \"Pastoral Poetry,\" I can as little share  in the feelings with which they have intruded into the charmed circle  of his poetry such compositions as \"Lines on the Ruins of Lincluden  College,\" \"Verses on the Destruction of the Woods of Drumlanrig,\"  \"Verses written on a Marble Slab in the Woods of Aberfeldy,\" and those  entitled \"The Tree of Liberty.\" These productions, with the exception  of the last, were never seen by any one even in the handwriting of  Burns, and are one and all wanting in that original vigour of language  and manliness of sentiment which distinguish his poetry. With respect  to \"The Tree of Liberty\" in particular, a subject dear to the heart of  the Bard, can any one conversant with his genius imagine that he  welcomed its growth or celebrated its fruit with such \"capon craws\" as  these?        \"Upo' this tree there grows sic fruit,         Its virtues a' can tell, man;       It raises man aboon the brute,         It mak's him ken himsel', man.       Gif ance the peasant taste a bit,         He's greater than a lord, man,       An' wi' a beggar shares a mite         O' a' he can afford, man.\"    There are eleven stanzas, of which the best, compared with the \"A  man's a man for a' that\" of Burns, sounds like a cracked pipkin  against the \"heroic clang\" of a Damascus blade. That it is extant in  the handwriting of the poet cannot be taken as a proof that it is his  own composition, against the internal testimony of utter want of all  the marks by which we know him--the Burns-stamp, so to speak, which is  visible on all that ever came from his pen. Misled by his handwriting,  I inserted in my former edition of his works an epitaph, beginning        \"Here lies a rose, a budding rose,\"    the composition of Shenstone, and which is to be found in the  church-yard of Hales-Owen: as it is not included in every edition of  that poet's acknowledged works, Burns, who was an admirer of his  genius, had, it seems, copied it with his own hand, and hence my  error. If I hesitated about the exclusion of \"The Tree of Liberty,\"  and its three false brethren, I could have no scruples regarding the  fine song of \"Evan Banks,\" claimed and justly for Miss Williams by Sir  Walter Scott, or the humorous song called \"Shelah O'Neal,\" composed by  the late Sir Alexander Boswell. When I have stated that I have  arranged the Poems, the Songs, and the Letters of Burns, as nearly as  possible in the order in which they were written; that I have omitted  no piece of either verse or prose which bore the impress of his hand,  nor included any by which his high reputation would likely be  impaired, I have said all that seems necessary to be said, save that  the following letter came too late for insertion in its proper place:  it is characteristic and worth a place anywhere.    ALLAN CUNNINGHAM.           *       *       *       *       *    TO DR. ARCHIBALD LAURIE.    _Mossgiel, 13th Nov. 1786._    DEAR SIR,    I have along with this sent the two volumes of Ossian, with the  remaining volume of the Songs. Ossian I am not in such a hurry about;  but I wish the Songs, with the volume of the Scotch Poets, returned as  soon as they can conveniently be dispatched. If they are left at Mr.  Wilson, the bookseller's shop, Kilmarnock, they will easily reach me.    My most respectful compliments to Mr. and Mrs. Laurie; and a Poet's  warmest wishes for their happiness to the young ladies; particularly  the fair musician, whom I think much better qualified than ever David  was, or could be, to charm an evil spirit out of a Saul.    Indeed, it needs not the Feelings of a poet to be interested in the  welfare of one of the sweetest scenes of domestic peace and kindred  love that ever I saw; as I think the peaceful unity of St. Margaret's  Hill can only be excelled by the harmonious concord of the Apocalyptic  Zion.    I am, dear Sir, yours sincerely,    ROBERT BURNS.          TABLE OF CONTENTS.

Ingred, old girl! I say, Ingred! Wherever have you taken  yourself off to?\" shouted a boyish voice, as its owner, jumping an  obstructing gooseberry bush, tore around the corner of the house from  the kitchen garden on to the strip of rough lawn that faced the windows.  \"Hullo! Cuckoo! Coo-ee! _In_-gred!\"    \"I'm here all the time, so you needn't bawl!\" came in resigned tones  from under the shade of a large fuchsia. \"You're enough to wake the  dead, Chumps! What is it you want now! It's too hot to go a walk till  after tea. I'm trying to get ten minutes peace and quiet!\"    Hereward, otherwise \"Chumps,\" put his feet together in the second  position, flung out his arms in what was intended to be a graceful  attitude, and made a mock bow worthy of the cinema stage.    \"Have them by all means, Madam!\" he replied in mincing accents. \"Your  humble servant has no wish to disturb your ladyship's elegant repose. He  offers a thousand apologies for his unceremonious entrance into your  august presence, and implores you to condescend----_Ow! Stop it, you  brute!_\"    Hereward's burst of eloquence was brought to an abrupt end by the  violent onslaught of a fox-terrier puppy which flung itself upon him and  began to worry his ankles with delighted yelps of appreciation.    \"Stop it! Keep off, I tell you! I _won't_ be chewed to ribbons!\" he  protested, dodging the attacks of the playful but all too sharp teeth,  and catching the little dog by the piece of tarred rope that formed its  collar. \"Here, you'll get throttled in a minute if you don't mend your  manners.\"    \"Give him to his auntie, bless his heart!\" laughed Ingred, extending  welcoming arms to the fat specimen of puppyhood, and rolling him about  on her knee. \"Oh, he _did_ make you dance! You looked so funny! There,  precious! Don't chump auntie's fingers. Go bye-byes now. Snuggle down on  auntie's dress, and----\"    \"If you've _quite_ finished talking idiotic nonsense to that little  beast,\" interrupted Hereward sarcastically, \"you'll perhaps kindly  oblige me by mentioning whether you're coming or not!\"    \"Not coming anywhere--too hot!\" grunted Ingred, resettling her cushion  under the fuchsia bush.    \"Right you are! Please yourself and you'll please me! Though I should  have thought the run to Chatcombe----\"    Ingred sprang to her feet, dropping the puppy unceremoniously.    \"You don't mean to say Egbert's finished mending the motor bike? You  abominable boy! Why couldn't you tell me so before?\"    \"You never gave me the chance--just said off-hand you wouldn't go  anywhere. Yes, the engine's running like a daisy, and the sidecar's on,  and Egbert's fussing to be off. If you really change your mind and want  to go----\"    But by this time Ingred was round the corner of the house; so, shaking a  philosophic head at the ways of girls in general, her brother gathered a  gooseberry or two en route, and followed her in the direction of the  stable-yard.    The Saxons were spending their summer holidays at a farm near the  seaside, and for the first time in four long years the whole family was  reunited. Mr. Saxon, Egbert, and Athelstane had only just been  demobilized, and had hardly yet settled down to civilian life. They had  joined the rest of the party at Lynstones before returning to their  native town of Grovebury. The six weeks by the sea seemed a kind of  oasis between the anxious period of the war that was past and gone, and  the new epoch that stretched ahead in the future. To Ingred they were  halcyon days. To have her father and brothers safely back, and for the  family to be together in the midst of such beautiful scenery, was  sufficient for utter enjoyment. She did not wish her mind to venture  outside the charmed circle of the holidays. Beyond, when she thought  about it all, lay a nebulous prospect, in the center of which school  loomed large.    On this particular hot August afternoon, Ingred welcomed an excursion in  the sidecar. She had not felt inclined to walk down the white path  under the blazing sun to the glaring beach, but it was another matter to  spin along the high road till, as the fairy tales put it, her hair  whistled in the wind. Egbert was anxious to set off, so Hereward took  his place on the luggage-carrier, and, after some back-firing, the three  started forth. It was a glorious run over moorland country, with  glimpses of the sea on the one hand, and craggy tors on the other, and  round them billowy masses of heather, broken here and there by runnels  of peat-stained water. If Egbert exceeded the speed-limit, he certainly  had the excuse of a clear road before him; there were no hedges to hide  advancing cars, neither was there any possibility of whisking round a  corner to find a hay-cart blocking the way. In the course of an hour  they had covered a considerable number of miles, and found themselves  whirling down the tremendous hill that led to the seaside town of  Chatcombe.    Arrived in the main street they left the motorcycle at a garage, and  strolled on to the promenade, joining the crowd of holiday-makers who  were sauntering along in the heat, or sitting on the benches watching  the children digging in the sand below. Much to Ingred's astonishment  she was suddenly hailed by her name, and, turning, found herself greeted  with enthusiasm by a schoolfellow.    \"Ingred! What a surprise!\"    \"Avis! Who'd have thought of seeing you?\"    \"Are you staying here?\"    \"No, only over for the afternoon.\"    \"We've rooms at Beach View over there. Come along and have some tea with  us, and your brothers too. Yes, indeed you must! Mother will be  delighted to see you all. I shan't let you say no!\"    Borne away by her hospitable friend, Ingred presently found herself  sitting on a seat in the front garden of a tall boarding-house facing  the sea, and while Egbert and Hereward discussed motor-cycling with  Avis's father, the two girls enjoyed a confidential chat together.    \"Only a few days now,\" sighed Avis, \"then we've got to leave all this  and go home. How long are you staying at Lynstones, Ingred?\"    \"A fortnight more, but don't talk of going home. I want the holidays to  last forever!\"    \"So do I, but they won't. School begins on the twenty-first of  September. It will be rather sport to go to the new buildings at last,  won't it? By the by, now the war's over, and we've all got our own  again, I suppose you're going back to Rotherwood, aren't you?\"    \"I suppose so, when it's ready.\"    \"But surely the Red Cross cleared out ages ago, and the whole place has  been done up? I saw the paperhangers there in June.\"    \"Oh, yes!\" Ingred's voice was a little strained.    \"You'll be so glad to be living there again,\" continued Avis. \"I always  envied you that lovely house. You must have hated lending it as a  hospital. I expect when you're back you'll be giving all sorts of  delightful parties, won't you? At least that's what the girls at school  were saying.\"    \"It's rather early to make plans,\" temporized Ingred.    \"Oh, of course! But Jess and Francie said you'd a gorgeous floor for  dancing. I do think a fancy-dress dance is about the best fun on earth.  The next time I get an invitation, I'm going as a Quaker maiden, in a  gray dress and the duckiest little white cap. Don't you think it would  suit me? With your dark hair you ought to be something Eastern. I can  just imagine you acting hostess in a shimmery sort of white-and-gold  costume. _Do_ promise to wear white-and-gold!\"    \"All right,\" laughed Ingred.    \"It's so delightful that the war's over, and we can begin to have  parties again, like we used to do. Beatrice Jackson told me she should  never forget that Carnival dance she went to at Rotherwood five years  ago, and all the lanterns and fairy lamps. Some of the other girls talk  about it yet. Hullo, that's the gong! Come indoors, and we'll have tea.\"    Ingred was very quiet as she went back in the sidecar that evening,  though Hereward, sitting on the luggage-carrier, was in high spirits,  and fired off jokes at her the whole time. The fact was she was thinking  deeply. Certain problems, which she had hitherto cast carelessly"]]]
