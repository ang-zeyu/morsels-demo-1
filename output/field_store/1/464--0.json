MARY HOWITT.      Take nine-and-twenty sunny, bracing English May days, steal from March  as many still, starry nights, to these add two rainy mornings and  evenings, and the product will resemble a typical Indian January. This  is the coolest month in the year, a month when the climate is  invigorating and the sunshine temperate. But even in January the sun's  rays have sufficient power to cause the thermometer to register 70  degrees in the shade at noon, save on an occasional cloudy day.    Sunset is marked by a sudden fall of temperature. The village smoke  then hangs a few feet above the earth like a blue-grey diaphanous  cloud.    The cold increases throughout the hours of darkness. In the Punjab  hoar-frosts form daily; and in the milder United Provinces the  temperature often falls sufficiently to allow of the formation of thin  sheets of ice. Towards dawn mists collect which are not dispersed  until the sun has shone upon them for several hours. The vultures  await the dissipation of these vapours before they ascend to the upper  air, there to soar on outstretched wings and scan the earth for food.    On New Year's Day the wheat, the barley, the gram, and the other  Spring crops are well above the ground, and, ere January has given  place to February, the emerald shoots of the corn attain a height of  fully sixteen inches. On these the geese levy toll.    Light showers usually fall in January. These are very welcome to the  agriculturalist because they impart vigour to the young crops. In the  seasons when the earth is not blessed with the refreshing winter rain  men and oxen are kept busy irrigating the fields. The cutting and the  pressing of the sugar-cane employ thousands of husbandmen and their  cattle. In almost every village little sugar-cane presses are being  worked by oxen from sunrise to sunset. At night-time the country-side  is illumined by the flames of the _megas_ burned by the rustic  sugar-boilers.    January is the month in which the avian population attains its  maximum. Geese, ducks, teal, pelicans, cormorants, snake-birds and  ospreys abound in the rivers and _jhils_; the marshes and swamps are  the resort of millions of snipe and other waders; the fields and  groves swarm with flycatchers, chats, starlings, warblers, finches,  birds of prey and the other migrants which in winter visit the plains  from the Himalayas and the country beyond.    The bracing climate of the Punjab attracts some cold-loving species  for which the milder United Provinces have no charms. Conspicuous  among these are rooks, ravens and jackdaws. On the other hand, frosts  drive away from the Land of the Five Rivers certain of the feathered  folk which do not leave the United Provinces or Bengal: to wit, the  purple sunbird, the bee-eater and, to a large extent, the king-crow.    The activity of the feathered folk is not at its height in January.  Birds are warm-blooded creatures and they love not the cold.  Comparatively few of them are in song, and still fewer nest, at this  season.    Song and sound are expressions of energy. Birds have more vitality,  more life in them than has any other class of organism. They are,  therefore, the most noisy of beings.    Many of the calls of birds are purposeful, being used to express  pleasure or anger, or to apprise members of a flock of one another's  presence. Others appear to serve no useful end. These are simply the  outpourings of superfluous energy, the expressions of the supreme  happiness that perfect health engenders. Since the vigour of birds is  greatest at the nesting season, it follows that that is the time when  they are most vociferous. Some birds sing only at the breeding season,  while others emit their cries at all times. Hence the avian choir in  India, as in all other countries, is composed of two sets of  vocalists--those who perform throughout the year, \"the musicians of  all times and places,\" and those who join the chorus only for a few  weeks or months. The calls of the former class go far to create for  India its characteristic atmosphere. To enumerate all such bird calls  would be wearisome. For the purposes of this calendar it is necessary  to describe only the common daily cries--the sounds that at all times  and all seasons form the basis of the avian chorus.    From early dawn till nightfall the welkin rings with the harsh caw of  the house-crow, the deeper note of the black crow or corby, the  tinkling music of the bulbuls, the cheery _keky_, _keky_, _kek_,  _kek_ ... _chur_, _chur_, _kok_, _kok_, _kok_ of the myna, the  monotonous _cuckoo-coo-coo_ of the spotted dove (_Turtur suratensis_),  the soft subdued _cuk-cuk-coo-coo-coo_ of the little brown dove (_T.  cambayensis_), the mechanical _ku-ku--ku_ of the ring-dove (_T.  risorius_), the loud penetrating shrieks of the green parrot, the  trumpet-like calls of the saras crane, the high-pitched _did-he-do-it_  of the red-wattled lapwing, the wailing trill _chee-hee-hee-hee_  _hee--hee_ of the kite, the hard grating notes and the metallic  _coch-lee_, _coch-lee_ of the tree-pie; the sharp _towee_, _towee_,  _towee_ of the tailor-bird, the soft melodious cheeping calls of the  flocks of little white-eyes, the _chit_, _chit_, _chitter_ of the  sparrow, the screaming cries of the golden-backed woodpecker, the  screams and the trills of the white-breasted kingfisher, the curious  harsh clamour of the cuckoo-shrike, and, last but by no means least,  the sweet and cheerful whistling refrain of the fan-tail flycatcher,  which at frequent intervals emanates from a tree in the garden or the  mango tope. Nor is the bird choir altogether hushed during the hours  of darkness. Throughout the year, more especially on moonlit nights,  the shrieking _kucha_, _kwachee_, _kwachee_, _kwachee_, _kwachee_ of  the little spotted owlet disturbs the silences of the moon. Few nights  pass on which the dusky horned owl fails to utter his grunting  hoot, or the jungle owlet to emit his curious but not unpleasant  _turtuck_, _turtuck_, _turtuck_, _turtuck_, _turtuck_, _tukatu_,  _chatuckatuckatuck_.    The above are the commonest of the bird calls heard throughout the  year. They form the basis of the avian melody in India. This melody is  reinforced from time to time by the songs of those birds that may be  termed the seasonal choristers. It is the presence or absence of the  voices of these latter which imparts distinctive features to the  minstrelsy of every month of the year.    In January the sprightly little metallic purple sunbird pours forth,  from almost every tree or bush, his powerful song, which, were it a  little less sharp, might easily be mistaken for that of a canary.    From every mango tope emanates a loud \"Think of me ... Never to be.\"  This is the call of the grey-headed flycatcher (_Culicicapa  ceylonensis_), a bird that visits the plains of northern India every  winter. In summer it retires to the Himalayas for nesting purposes.  Still more melodious is the call of the wood-shrike, which is  frequently heard at this season, and indeed during the greater part of  the year.    Every now and again the green barbet emits his curious chuckling  laugh, followed by a monotonous _kutur_, _kutur_, _kuturuk_. At rare  intervals his cousin, the coppersmith, utters a soft _wow_ and thereby  reminds us that he is in the land of the living. These two species,  more especially the latter, seem to dislike the cold weather. They  revel in the heat; it is when the thermometer stands at something over  100 degrees in the shade that they feel like giants refreshed, and  repeat their loud calls with wearying insistence throughout the hours  of daylight.    The nuthatches begin to tune up in January. They sing with more cheer  than harmony, their love-song being a sharp penetrating  _tee-tee-tee-tee-tee_.    The hoopoe reminds us of his presence by an occasional soft  _uk-uk-uk_. His breeding season, like that of the nuthatch, is about  to begin.    The magpie-robin or _dhayal_, who for months past has uttered no  sound, save a scolding note when occasion demanded, now begins to make  melody. His January song, however, is harsh and crude, and not such as  to lead one to expect the rich deep-toned music that will compel  admiration in April, May and June.    Towards the end of the month the fluty call of the koel, another  hot-weather chorister, may be heard in the eastern portions of  northern India.

Granny Fox Gives Reddy a Scare    Reddy Fox lived with Granny Fox. You see, Reddy was one of a large  family, so large that Mother Fox had hard work to feed so many hungry  little mouths and so she had let Reddy go to live with old Granny Fox.  Granny Fox was the wisest, slyest, smartest fox in all the country  round, and now that Reddy had grown so big, she thought it about time  that he began to learn the things that every fox should know. So every  day she took him hunting with her and taught him all the things that she  had learned about hunting: about how to steal Farmer Brown's chickens  without awakening Bowser the Hound, and all about the thousand and one  ways of fooling a dog which she had learned.    This morning Granny Fox had taken Reddy across the Green Meadows, up  through the Green Forest, and over to the railroad track. Reddy had  never been there before and he didn't know just what to make of it.  Granny trotted ahead until they came to a long bridge. Then she stopped.    \"Come here, Reddy, and look down,\" she commanded.    Reddy did as he was told, but a glance down made him giddy, so giddy  that he nearly fell. Granny Fox grinned.    \"Come across,\" said she, and ran lightly across to the other side.    But Reddy Fox was afraid. Yes, Sir, he was afraid to take one step on  the long bridge. He was afraid that he would fall through into the water  or onto the cruel rocks below. Granny Fox ran back to where Reddy sat.    \"For shame, Reddy Fox!\" said she. \"What are you afraid of? Just don't  look down and you will be safe enough. Now come along over with me.\"    But Reddy Fox hung back and begged to go home and whimpered. Suddenly  Granny Fox sprang to her feet, as if in great fright. \"Bowser the Hound!  Come, Reddy, come!\" she cried, and started across the bridge as fast as  she could go.    Reddy didn't stop to look or to think. His one idea was to get away from  Bowser the Hound. \"Wait, Granny! Wait!\" he cried, and started after her  as fast as he could run. He was in the middle of the bridge before he  remembered it at all. When he was at last safely across, it was to find  old Granny Fox sitting down laughing at him. Then for the first time  Reddy looked behind him to see where Bowser the Hound might be. He was  nowhere to be seen. Could he have fallen off the bridge?    \"Where is Bowser the Hound?\" cried Reddy.    \"Home in Farmer Brown's dooryard,\" replied Granny Fox dryly. Reddy  stared at her for a minute. Then he began to understand that Granny Fox  had simply scared him into running across the bridge. Reddy felt very  cheap, very cheap indeed. \"Now we'll run back again,\" said Granny Fox.  And this time Reddy did.          II. Granny Shows Reddy a Trick    Every day Granny Fox led Reddy Fox over to the long railroad bridge  and made him run back and forth across it until he had no fear of it  whatever. At first it had made him dizzy, but now he could run across  at the top of his speed and not mind it in the least. \"I don't see what  good it does to be able to run across a bridge; anyone can do that!\"  exclaimed Reddy one day.    Granny Fox smiled. \"Do you remember the first time you tried to do it?\"  she asked.    Reddy hung his head. Of course he remembered--remembered that Granny had  had to scare him into crossing that first time.    Suddenly Granny Fox lifted her head. \"Hark!\" she exclaimed.    Reddy pricked up his sharp, pointed ears. Way off back, in the direction  from which they had come, they heard the baying of a dog. It wasn't the  voice of Bowser the Hound but of a younger dog. Granny listened for a  few minutes. The voice of the dog grew louder as it drew nearer.    \"He certainly is following our track,\" said Granny Fox. \"Now, Reddy,  you run across the bridge and watch from the top of the little hill over  there. Perhaps I can show you a trick that will teach you why I have  made you learn to run across the bridge.\"    Reddy trotted across the long bridge and up to the top of the hill, as  Granny had told him to. Then he sat down to watch. Granny trotted out in  the middle of a field and sat down. Pretty soon a young hound broke out  of the bushes, his nose in Granny's track. Then he looked up and saw  her, and his voice grew still more savage and eager. Granny Fox started  to run as soon as she was sure that the hound had seen her, but she did  not run very fast. Reddy did not know what to make of it, for Granny  seemed simply to be playing with the hound and not really trying to get  away from him at all. Pretty soon Reddy heard another sound. It was a  long, low rumble. Then there was a distant whistle. It was a train.    Granny heard it, too. As she ran, she began to work back toward the long  bridge. The train was in sight now. Suddenly Granny Fox started across  the bridge so fast that she looked like a little red streak. The dog  was close at her heels when she started and he was so eager to catch her  that he didn't see either the bridge or the train. But he couldn't begin  to run as fast as Granny Fox. Oh, my, no! When she had reached the other  side, he wasn't halfway across, and right behind him, whistling for him  to get out of the way, was the train.    The hound gave one frightened yelp, and then he did the only thing he  could do; he leaped down, down into the swift water below, and the last  Reddy saw of him he was frantically trying to swim ashore.    \"Now you know why I wanted you to learn to cross a bridge; it's a very  nice way of getting rid of dogs,\" said Granny Fox, as she climbed up  beside Reddy.          III. Bowser the Hound Isn't Fooled    Reddy Fox had been taught so much by Granny Fox that he began to feel  very wise and very important. Reddy is naturally smart and he had been  very quick to learn the tricks that old Granny Fox had taught him.  But Reddy Fox is a boaster. Every day he swaggered about on the Green  Meadows and bragged how smart he was. Blacky the Crow grew tired of  Reddy's boasting.    \"If you're so smart, what is the reason you always keep out of sight of  Bowser the Hound?\" asked Blacky. \"For my part, I don't believe that you  are smart enough to fool him.\"    A lot of little meadow people heard Blacky say this, and Reddy knew it.  He also knew that if he didn't prove Blacky in the wrong he would be  laughed at forever after. Suddenly he remembered the trick that Granny  Fox had played on the young hound at the railroad bridge. Why not play  the same trick on Bowser and invite Blacky the Crow to see him do it? He  would.    \"If you will be over at the railroad bridge when the train comes this  afternoon, I'll show you how easy it is to fool Bowser the Hound,\" said  Reddy.    Blacky agreed to be there, and Reddy started off to find out where  Bowser was. Blacky told everyone he met how Reddy Fox had promised to  fool Bowser the Hound, and every time he told it he chuckled as if he  thought it the best joke ever.    Blacky the Crow was on hand promptly that afternoon and with him came  his cousin, Sammy Jay. Presently they saw Reddy Fox hurrying across the  fields, and behind him in full cry came Bowser the Hound. Just as old  Granny Fox had done with the young hound, Reddy allowed Bowser to get  very near him and then, as the train came roaring along, he raced across  the long bridge just ahead of it. He had thought that Bowser would be so  intent on catching him that he would not notice the train until he was  on the bridge and it was too late, as had been the case with the young  hound. Then Bowser would have to jump down into the swift river or be  run over. As soon as Reddy was across the bridge, he jumped off the  track and turned to see what would happen to Bowser the Hound. The train  was halfway across the bridge, but Bowser was nowhere to be seen.  He must have jumped already. Reddy sat down and grinned in the most  self-satisfied way.    The long train roared past, and Reddy closed his eyes to shut out the  dust and smoke. When he opened them again, he looked right into the  wide-open mouth of Bowser the Hound, who was not ten feet away.    \"Did you think you could fool me with that old trick?\" roared Bowser.    Reddy didn't stop to make reply; he just started off at the top of his  speed, a badly frightened little fox.    You see, Bowser the Hound knew all about that trick and he had just  waited until the train had passed and then had run across the bridge  right behind it.    And as Reddy Fox, out of breath and tired, ran to seek the aid of Granny  Fox in getting rid of Bowser the Hound, he heard a sound that made him  grind his teeth.    \"Haw, haw, haw! How smart we are!\"    It was Blacky the Crow.          IV. Reddy Fox Grows Bold    Reddy Fox was growing bold. Everybody said so, and what everybody says  must be so. Reddy Fox had always been very sly and not bold at all. The  truth is Reddy Fox had so many times fooled Bowser the Hound and Farmer  Brown's boy that he had begun to think himself very smart indeed. He  had really fooled himself. Yes, Sir, Reddy Fox had fooled himself. He  thought himself so smart that nobody could fool him.    Now it is one of the worst habits in the world to think too much  of one's self. And Reddy Fox had the habit. Oh, my, yes! Reddy Fox  certainly did have the habit! When anyone mentioned Bowser the Hound,  Reddy would turn up his nose and say: \"Pooh! It's the easiest thing in  the world to fool him.\"    You see, he had forgotten all about the time Bowser had fooled him at  the railroad bridge.    Whenever Reddy saw Farmer Brown's boy he would say with the greatest  scorn: \"Who's afraid of him? Not I!\"    So as Reddy Fox thought more and more of his own smartness, he grew  bolder and bolder. Almost every night he visited Farmer Brown's henyard.  Farmer Brown set traps all around the yard, but Reddy always found them  and kept out of them. It got so that Unc' Billy Possum and Jimmy Skunk  didn't dare go to the "]]]
