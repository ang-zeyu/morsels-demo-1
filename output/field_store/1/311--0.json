Only limitation of space has prevented the inclusion  of numerous other deserving artists and teachers, yet practically all of  the greatest masters of the violin now in this country are represented.  That the lessons of their artistry and experience will be of direct  benefit and value to every violin student and every lover of violin  music may be accepted as a foregone conclusion.

For Ysaye is the greatest exponent of  that wonderful Belgian school of violin playing which is rooted in his  teachers Vieuxtemps and Wieniawski, and which as Ysaye himself says,  \"during a period covering seventy years reigned supreme at the  _Conservatoire_ in Paris in the persons of Massart, Remi, Marsick, and  others of its great interpreters.\"    What most impresses one who meets Ysaye and talks with him for the  first time is the mental breadth and vision of the man; his kindness and  amiability; his utter lack of small vanity. When the writer first called  on him in New York with a note of introductio from his friend and  admirer Adolfo Betti, and later at Scarsdale where, in company with his  friend Thibaud, he was dividing his time between music and tennis, Ysaye  made him entirely at home, and willingly talked of his art and its  ideals. In reply to some questions anent his own study years, he said:    \"Strange to say, my father was my very first teacher--it is not often  the case. I studied with him until I went to the Liege Conservatory in  1867, where I won a second prize, sharing it with Ovide Musin, for  playing Viotti's 22d Concerto. Then I had lessons from Wieniawski in  Brussels and studied two years with Vieuxtemps in Paris. Vieuxtemps was  a paralytic when I came to him; yet a wonderful teacher, though he could  no longer play. And I was already a concertizing artist when I met him.  He was a very great man, the grandeur of whose tradition lives in the  whole 'romantic school' of violin playing. Look at his seven  concertos--of course they are written with an eye to effect, from the  virtuoso's standpoint, yet how firmly and solidly they are built up!  How interesting is their working-out: and the orchestral score is far  more than a mere accompaniment. As regards virtuose effect only  Paganini's music compares with his, and Paganini, of course, did not  play it as it is now played. In wealth of technical development, in true  musical expressiveness Vieuxtemps is a master. A proof is the fact that  his works have endured forty to fifty years, a long life for  compositions.    \"Joachim, Leonard, Sivori, Wieniawski--all admired Vieuxtemps. In  Paganini's and Locatelli's works the effect, comparatively speaking,  lies in the mechanics; but Vieuxtemps is the great artist who made the  instrument take the road of romanticism which Hugo, Balzac and Gauthier  trod in literature. And before all the violin was made to charm, to  move, and Vieuxtemps knew it. Like Rubinstein, he held that the artist  must first of all have ideas, emotional power--his technic must be so  perfected that he does not have to think of it! Incidentally, speaking  of schools of violin playing, I find that there is a great tendency to  confuse the Belgian and French. This should not be. They are distinct,  though the latter has undoubtedly been formed and influenced by the  former. Many of the great violin names, in fact,--Vieuxtemps, Leonard*,  Marsick, Remi, Parent, de Broux, Musin, Thomson,--are all Belgian.\"        *Transcriber's note: Original text read \"Leonard\".                                 YSAYE'S REPERTORY    Ysaye spoke of Vieuxtemps's repertory--only he did not call it that: he  spoke of the Vieuxtemps compositions and of Vieuxtemps himself.  \"Vieuxtemps wrote in the grand style; his music is always rich and  sonorous. If his violin is really to sound, the violinist must play  Vieuxtemps, just as the 'cellist plays Servais. You know, in the  Catholic Church, at Vespers, whenever God's name is spoken, we bow the  head. And Wieniawski would always bow his head when he said: 'Vieuxtemps  is the master of us all!'    \"I have often played his _Fifth Concerto_, so warm, brilliant and  replete with temperament, always full-sounding, rich in an almost  unbounded strength. Of course, since Vieuxtemps wrote his"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15536"],[0,"The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction.

This Engraving may prove a welcome pictorial accompaniment to a score  of plans of \"the seat of war,\" in illustration of the leading topic of  the day. The view may be relied on for accuracy; it being a transfer of  the engraving in \"Select Views of the Principal Cities of Europe, from  Original Paintings, by Lieutenant Colonel Batty, F.R.S.[1]\" We have so  recently described the city, that our present notice must be confined  to a brief outline.    Antwerp, one of the chief cities of the Netherlands, is situated on the  river Scheldt, 22 miles north of Brussels, and 65 south of Amsterdam:  longitude 4 deg. 23' East; latitude 51 deg. 13' North. It is called by Latin  writers, _Antverpia_, or _Andoverpum_; by the Germans, _Antorf_; by  the Spanish, _Anveres_; and by the French, _Anvers_.[2] The city is of  great antiquity, and is supposed by some to have existed before the time  of Caesar. It was much enlarged by John, the first Duke of Brabant, in  1201; by John, the third, in 1314; and by the Emperor Charles V. in  1543: it has always been a place of commercial importance, and about  twenty years after the last mentioned date, the trade is concluded to  have been at its greatest height; the number of inhabitants was then  computed at 200,000. A few years subsequently, Antwerp suffered much in  the infamous war against religious freedom, projected by the detestable  Philip II. (son of Charles V.) and executed by the sanguinary Duke  of Alva, whose cruelty has scarcely a parallel in history. In this  merciless crusade, Alva boasted that he had consigned 18,000 persons  to the executioner; and with vanity as disgusting as his cruelty, he  placed a statue of himself in Antwerp, in which he was figured trampling  on the necks of two statues, representing the two estates of the Low  Countries. Before the termination of the war, not less than 600 houses  in the city were burnt, and 6 or 7,000 of the inhabitants killed or  drowned. Antwerp was retaken and repaired by the Prince of Parma, in  1585. It has since that time been captured and re-captured so frequently  as to render its decreasing prosperity a sad lesson, if such proof were  wanting, of the baleful scourge of war. The reader need scarcely be  reminded that the last and severest blow to the prosperity of Antwerp  was occasioned by the overthrow of Buonaparte, when, by the treaty of  peace signed in 1814, her naval establishment was utterly destroyed.[3]  The population has dwindled to little more than one-fourth of the  original number, its present number scarcely exceeding 60,000.    The annexed view is taken from the _Tete de Flandre_, a fortified  port on the left bank of the river Scheldt, immediately opposite to the  city, and now in the possession of the Dutch. The river here is a broad  and noble stream, and at high water navigable for vessels of large  tonnage. A short distance below the town the banks are elevated, like  part of Millbank, near Vauxhall Bridge; and the situation has much the  same character. The river is here about twice the width of the Thames  at London Bridge, and it flows with great rapidity.    Lieut.-Colonel Batty observes, \"there is perhaps no city in the north of  Europe which, on inspection, awakens greater interest\" than Antwerp. It  abounds in fine old buildings, which bear testimony to its former wealth  and importance. The three most aspiring points in the View are--1. the  Church of St. Paul, richly dight with pictures by Teniers, De Crayer,  Quellyn, De Vos, Jordaens, &c.; 2. the tower of the Hotel de Ville, the  whole facade of which is little short of 300 feet, a part of the front  being cased with variegated marble, and ornamented with statues; 3. the  lofty and richly-embellished Tower of the Cathedral of Notre Dame,  forming the most striking object from whichever side we view the city.  The interior is enriched with valuable paintings by Flemish masters; the  height of the spire is stated at 460 feet.[4]    The distance from the mouth of the Scheldt to Antwerp is usually  reckoned to be sixty-two miles, allowing for the bending of the river.  At Lillo, an important fortress, the appearance of the city of Antwerp  becomes an interesting object, and the more imposing the nearer the  traveller approaches along the last reach of the Scheldt.    Antwerp has been the birthplace of many learned men--as, Ortelius, an  eminent mathematician and antiquary of the sixteenth century, and the  friend of our Camden; Gorleus, a celebrated medallist, of the same  period; Andrew Schott, a learned Jesuit, and the friend of Scaliger;  Lewis Nonnius, a distinguished physician and erudite scholar, born early  in the seventeenth century. Few places have produced so many painters of  merit, as will be seen at page 380, by a well-timed communication from  our early correspondent P.T.W.        [1] Copied by permission of the proprietors and publishers, Messrs.          Moon, Boys, and Graves.        [2] The name of Antwerp, says an ingenious correspondent, at p. 287,          vol. xiv. of _The Mirror_, is derived from _Hand-werpen_, or          _Hand-thrown_: so called from a legend, which informs us that on          the site of the present city once stood the castle of a giant,          who was accustomed to amuse himself by cutting off and casting          into the river the right hands of the unfortunate wights that          fell into his power; but that being at last conquered himself,          his own immense hand was disposed off, with poetical justice, in          the same way. We quote this passage in a note, as it is only          worthy of place _beneath_ facts of sober history.        [3] See Antwerp described from a _Tour in South Holland_ in the          _Family Library_, at p. 109. vol. xviii of _The Mirror_.

Hark, in the bower of yonder tower,      What maiden so sweetly sings,    As the eagle flies through the sunny skies      He stayeth his golden wings;    And swiftly descends, and his proud neck bends,      And his eyes they stream with glare,    And gaze with delight, on her looks so bright,      As he motionless treads the air.    But his powerful wings, as she sweetly sings,      They droop to the briny wave,    And slowly he falls near the castle walls,      And sinks to his ocean grave.    Was it arrow unseen with glancing sheen,      The twang of the string unheard,    Sped from hunter's bow, that has laid him low,      And has pierced that kingly bird?    That has brought his flight, from the realms of light,      Where his hues in ether glow,    To float for awhile in the sun's last smile,      Then dim to the depths below?    No! the pow'rful spell, that had wrought too well,      Was sung by a maiden true,    And it breath'd and flow'd, to her love who row'd,      His path through the seas of blue.    As she saw his sail, by the gentle gale,      Slow borne to her lofty bower,    Her heart it beat, in her high retreat,      She sang by a spell-bound power:          \"Zephyr winds, with gentlest motion        Urge his bark the blue waves o'er;        Cease your wild and deep commotion        Waft him safely to the shore.          \"Lovely art thou crested billow,        On thy whiteness rests his eye,        Thou art to his bark a pillow,        Thou dost hear his ev'ry sigh.          \"Would I were yon dolphin dancing        Round his fragile vessel's stern;        Ev'ry gaze my soul entrancing,        I would woo him though he spurn.\"      Here she rais'd her eyes, to the once bright skies,      For she heard the deep sea groan,    And her song it stopp'd, and her hands they drop'd,      Her face grew white as the foam;    For the lovely blue, was hid from her view,      By a black and mighty cloud!    She saw in each wave, a watery grave,      And again she sang aloud:          \"But the clouds are rolling heavy,        Fitful gusts distend his sail;        See the whirlpool's foaming eddy,        Hear the seagull's mournful wail.          \"Now his vessel greets the thunder,        Now she rests on ocean's bed,        Where in shrines of pearl and amber,        Youthful lovers, love, though dead.          \"Gracious Heaven! in mercy spare him,        Shield him with thine arm of pow'r;        On thy wings, oh! Father, bear him        Through this dark and troubled hour.          \"In yon convent then to-morrow        Will I give to thee my days;        Flee this world of grief and sorrow,        Endless sing thee hymns of praise.          \"But if thou hast bid us sever,        Till we reach the heavenly shore,        I will steer my bark, where never,        Waves nor death shall part us more.          \"We will roam the plains of ocean,        Tread the sands where rubies shine,        Drink from starry founts the potion        Mortals taste, and grow divine.          \"But his vessel's sinking slowly,        And mine hour of death is near;        Yet I shrink not,--sweet and holy        Is the end that knows no fear.\"      Scarce the words had died, and the crimson tide,      Flow'd calm in her heaving breast,    When she flew to the wave, to share his grave,      And taste of his final rest.    And the fishermen boast, who dwell on that coast,      That after the ev'ning bell    Has toll'd the hour, in sleet and in shower,      They float on a golden shell.    And all night they roam, where the breakers foam,      When the moonbeams streak the waves,    But when morn awakes and the twilight breaks,      They glide to their coral caves.      _Leeds._    T.W.H.           *       *       *       *       *          Manners and Customs.
