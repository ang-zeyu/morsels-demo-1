CONTENTS      Baha'i Terms of Use  PART ONE  PART TWO              PART ONE      IN THE NAME OF OUR LORD, THE EXALTED, THE MOST HIGH.          _No man shall attain the shores of the ocean of true understanding      except he be detached from all that is in heaven and on earth.      Sanctify your souls, O ye peoples of the world, that haply ye may      attain that station which God hath destined for you and enter thus      the tabernacle which, according to the dispensations of      Providence, hath been raised in the firmament of the Bayan._      The essence of these words is this: they that tread the path of faith,  they that thirst for the wine of certitude, must cleanse themselves of all  that is earthly--their ears from idle talk, their minds from vain  imaginings, their hearts from worldly affections, their eyes from that  which perisheth. They should put their trust in God, and, holding fast  unto Him, follow in His way. Then will they be made worthy of the  effulgent glories of the sun of divine knowledge and understanding, and  become the recipients of a grace that is infinite and unseen, inasmuch as  man can never hope to attain unto the knowledge of the All-Glorious, can  never quaff from the stream of divine knowledge and wisdom, can never  enter the abode of immortality, nor partake of the cup of divine nearness  and favour, unless and until he ceases to regard the words and deeds of  mortal men as a standard for the true understanding and recognition of God  and His Prophets.    Consider the past. How many, both high and low, have, at all times,  yearningly awaited the advent of the Manifestations of God in the  sanctified persons of His chosen Ones. How often have they expected His  coming, how frequently have they prayed that the breeze of divine mercy  might blow, and the promised Beauty step forth from behind the veil of  concealment, and be made manifest to all the world. And whensoever the  portals of grace did open, and the clouds of divine bounty did rain upon  mankind, and the light of the Unseen did shine above the horizon of  celestial might, they all denied Him, and turned away from His face--the  face of God Himself. Refer ye, to verify this truth, to that which hath  been recorded in every sacred Book.    Ponder for a moment, and reflect upon that which hath been the cause of  such denial on the part of those who have searched with such earnestness  and longing. Their attack hath been more fierce than tongue or pen can  describe. Not one single Manifestation of Holiness hath appeared but He  was afflicted by the denials, the repudiation, and the vehement opposition  of the people around Him. Thus it hath been revealed: \"O the misery of  men! No Messenger cometh unto them but they laugh Him to scorn.\"(1) Again  He saith: \"Each nation hath plotted darkly against their Messenger to lay  violent hold on Him, and disputed with vain words to invalidate the  truth.\"(2)    In like manner, those words that have streamed forth from the source of  power and descended from the heaven of glory are innumerable and beyond  the ordinary comprehension of man. To them that are possessed of true  understanding and insight the Surah of Hud surely sufficeth. Ponder a  while those holy words in your heart, and, with utter detachment, strive  to grasp their meaning. Examine the wondrous behaviour of the Prophets,  and recall the defamations and denials uttered by the children of negation  and falsehood, perchance you may cause the bird of the human heart to wing  its flight away from the abodes of heedlessness and doubt unto the nest of  faith and certainty, and drink deep from the pure waters of ancient  wisdom, and partake of the fruit of the tree of divine knowledge. Such is  the share of the pure in heart of the bread that hath descended from the  realms of eternity and holiness.    Should you acquaint yourself with the indignities heaped upon the Prophets  of God, and apprehend the true causes of the objections voiced by their  oppressors, you will surely appreciate the significance of their position.  Moreover, the more closely you observe the denials of those who have  opposed the Manifestations of the divine attributes, the firmer will be  your faith in the Cause of God. Accordingly, a brief mention will be made  in this Tablet of divers accounts relative to the Prophets of God, that  they may demonstrate the truth that throughout all ages and centuries the  Manifestations of power and glory have been subjected to such heinous  cruelties that no pen dare describe them. Perchance this may enable a few  to cease to be perturbed by the clamour and protestations of the divines  and the foolish of this age, and cause them to strengthen their confidence  and certainty.    Among the Prophets was Noah. For nine hundred and fifty years He  prayerfully exhorted His people and summoned them to the haven of security  and peace. None, however, heeded His call. Each day they inflicted on His  blessed person such pain and suffering that no one believed He could  survive. How frequently they denied Him, how malevolently they hinted  their suspicion against Him! Thus it hath been revealed: \"And as often as  a company of His people passed by Him, they derided Him. To them He said:  'Though ye scoff at us now, we will scoff at you hereafter even as ye  scoff at us. In the end ye shall know.'\"(3) Long afterward, He several  times promised victory to His companions and fixed the hour thereof. But  when the hour struck, the divine promise was not fulfilled. This caused a  few among the small number of His followers to turn away from Him, and to  this testify the records of the best-known books. These you must certainly  have perused; if not, undoubtedly you will. Finally, as stated in books  and traditions, there remained with Him only forty or seventy-two of His  followers. At last from the depth of His being He cried aloud: \"Lord!  Leave not upon the land a single dweller from among the unbelievers.\"(4)    And now, consider and reflect a moment upon the waywardness of this  people. What could have been the reason for such denial and avoidance on  their part? What could have induced them to refuse to put off the garment  of denial, and to adorn themselves with the robe of acceptance? Moreover,  what could have caused the nonfulfilment of the divine promise which led  the seekers to reject that which they had accepted? Meditate profoundly,  that the secret of things unseen may be revealed unto you, that you may  inhale the sweetness of a spiritual and imperishable fragrance, and that  you may acknowledge the truth that from time immemorial even unto eternity  the Almighty hath tried, and will continue to try, His servants, so that  light may be distinguished from darkness, truth from falsehood, right from  wrong, guidance from error, happiness from misery, and roses from thorns.  Even as He hath revealed: \"Do men think when they say 'We believe' they  shall be let alone and not be put to proof?\"(5)    And after Noah the light of the countenance of Hud shone forth above the  horizon of creation. For well-nigh seven hundred years, according to the  sayings of men, He exhorted the people to turn their faces and draw nearer  unto the Ridvan of the divine presence. What showers of afflictions rained  upon Him, until at last His adjurations bore the fruit of increased  rebelliousness, and His assiduous endeavours resulted in the wilful  blindness of His people. \"And their unbelief shall only increase for the  unbelievers their own perdition.\"(6)    And after Him there appeared from the Ridvan of the Eternal, the  Invisible, the holy person of Salih, Who again summoned the people to the  river of everlasting life. For over a hundred years He admonished them to  hold fast unto the commandments of God and eschew that which is forbidden.  His admonitions, however, yielded no fruit, and His pleading proved of no  avail. Several times He retired and lived in seclusion. All this, although  that eternal Beauty was summoning the people to no other than the city of  God. Even as it is revealed: \"And unto the tribe of Thamud We sent their  brother Salih. 'O my people,' said He, 'Worship God, ye have none other  God beside Him....' They made reply: 'O Salih, our hopes were fixed on  thee until now; forbiddest thou us to worship that which our fathers  worshipped? Truly we misdoubt that whereunto thou callest us as  suspicious.'\"(7) All this proved fruitless, until at last there went up a  great cry, and all fell into utter perdition.    Later, the beauty of the countenance of the Friend of God(8) appeared from  behind the veil, and another standard of divine guidance was hoisted. He  invited the people of the earth to the light of righteousness.
