VOL. I. JULY, 1895. No. 7.                ITALIAN WROUGHT IRON.    The wrought iron of the middle ages, and of the time of the Renaissance,  and even down to the last century, in Italy, France, and Germany showed,  in the crudest examples, the principal virtues of all true decorative  art. The reason is not far to seek. The difficulties in the way of  working the material with ease imposed certain limitations in design and  execution which could not well be disregarded. The lack of machinery  (which is responsible for much of the uninteresting character of our  modern work) necessarily compelled the use of comparatively simple and  straightforward methods. It was difficult to avoid the tell-tale marks  of the smith's work, and there were limits beyond which his skill could  not carry it. Furthermore the designer, taking these limitations into  account, learned to make the most of his possibilities, and to adapt his  design to the material--to design in the material. How different from  the methods generally in use now! Designs made to imitate something done  in another material, turned out by the hundred from a machine which  leaves no indication of its work, with all interest of craftsmanship  lacking, except in places where it may be vulgarly thrown in your face  to make it look as if it had been \"hand-made.\"    Clever imitations of old work are produced, and indeed some of the  examples shown in our plates are reproductions and not originals; and if  we cannot have new designs of equal excellence this is the next most  desirable thing. And so far as the illustrations are concerned the  difference between the original and the reproduction could never be  distinguished.    The subjects chosen for the illustrations of this number are lanterns  and torch-bearers. The lanterns were in reality torch-bearers, as they  were made for holding masses of combustible material which were held in  place by the central spike.    The curious lanterns that decorate the Strozzi Palace at Florence, and  of which similar specimens are still attached to the angles of the  Riccardi Palace, once the famous residence of the Medici, in the same  city, are among, the best examples of their kind still remaining. We are  informed by Vasari that these \"_lumiere miravigliosi_\" were the work of  one Nicolo Grosso Caparra, a celebrated artificer of the time, by whom  it is not unlikely that many of the beautiful rings and cressets which  still decorate the old palaces of Siena may have been executed. On the  centre spike was fixed a little iron barrel, containing tow and pitch,  while on each of the other spikes a torch was fastened. In some of the  old engravings of the festivities given at night by the Grand Dukes of  Tuscany, the representations of the effect of this mode of illumination  may be seen. It is said that the privilege of affixing such cressets to  a residence was one conferred by the State only on the most  distinguished citizens, as a peculiar honor, in acknowledgment of  services performed.

This is one of the finest examples of Italian wrought iron work still  existing, and has frequently served as a model for lanterns in recent  times.    [Illustration: L.

This together with the preceding example are reproductions of old work.      Reproduction of Architects' Drawings.    The development of photographic processes for the reproduction of  drawings which has taken place within the past few years has led to a  remarkable increase in the publication of architects' designs, both in  the technical journals and in the popular magazines and daily press.  Undoubtedly the recent progress of architectural design in America is  largely due to the opportunity for comparison thus placed within the  reach of architects and draughtsmen who could not otherwise place their  productions beside those of their fellows. So important has this become  that an architectural paper is now usually judged almost entirely upon  the quality of its illustrations, the text matter being not only  secondary, but in some cases serving only as a vehicle for the plates.  In fact, some of the most valuable and most highly esteemed  architectural publications are entirely devoid of text.    It naturally happens that many of the drawings made in the ordinary  course of an architect's work sooner or later fall into the hands of the  publishers of some of the architectural papers or are required for  publication in other directions. When such drawings have been made  without a proper knowledge of the requirements of the reproductive  processes the result is frequently very unsatisfactory, and in many  cases gives an entirely unfair impression of the design, while this  difficulty might have been easily avoided by a little forethought, and  without any additional labor.    A few fundamental points which can always be kept in mind will enable  draughtsmen to make sure that their work will reproduce well, that is to  say, will give a fairly truthful reproduction of the original drawing.    There are at present in use a large number of printing processes  depending upon photography as a basis, by which drawings may be  duplicated, but they can be roughly divided into two main classes  according to the character of the original drawings. In general, line  drawings may be treated by one process, while those in which there is a  gradation of tones or tints, no matter in what way produced (except by  distinct lines), require another and entirely different process. Line  reproductions may be made in several different ways, but the  requirements in the original drawing are the same in each. The first  requisite is that a drawing shall be made in absolutely black ink on  white paper, and with clear, firm lines. With a little care it is just  as easy to make a drawing in this way as any other, and a satisfactory  reproduction can be assured when it is kept in mind that nothing but  black will give the best results. In the early days of process work it  was customary to use India ink ground by the draughtsman, but excellent  liquid inks, such, for instance, as that made by Charles M. Higgins &  Co., have taken the place of this, at a great saving of labor and  trouble. It is only necessary to take care that the ink is new and not  too watery, and that a sufficient amount is carried in the pen to insure  a black line. Gray lines, although full and continuous, are very apt to  be ragged and broken in the reproduction. Aside from this first  condition there are few others which are really mandatory. A drawing  made with vigorous, well-defined lines and rather open in treatment  will, as a rule, make the most satisfactory reproduction.    There is never difficulty in getting a good reproduction from such work  as that by which Mr. H.P. Kirby or Mr. D.A. Gregg is known. For this  purpose their style could hardly be improved upon. A drawing can be made  with fine and delicate lines and still reproduce well if there is not  too much difference in size between the original and the reproduction  required. In general, the best results can be obtained by making the  plate about two thirds the size of the original.    Drawings in colored inks on tinted paper are difficult to reproduce  satisfactorily, and of all combinations a bluish ink upon a yellowish  paper is to be avoided.    In general, it can be said that everything, even including line drawings  in pen and ink, _can_ be reproduced by the half-tone processes, the  quality of the plate depending upon the character of the original.  Water-colors, monochrome drawings in wash, pencil drawings and any  combinations of these, are reproducible, but with varying success. The  same conditions which apply to line work also hold good to a  considerable extent in the present case. A combination of vigorous black  ink lines and lighter more delicate work put in with thinned or gray ink  will in all probability be very unsatisfactory, as the chances of  holding the relation between the two, or in fact of preserving the  lighter lines at all, without over-emphasizing the darker portions, will  not be very great. Delicate drawings can seldom be reproduced without  giving a background tint all over, and this usually destroys the life  and snap of the original. This is especially true of drawings upon  reddish or yellowish paper, which on this account should be avoided if  possible. It should be borne in mind that"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15281"],[0,"Uncle Wiggily's Adventures (#1)"],[1,"WIGGILY'S  ADVENTURES    By  HOWARD R.

FENNO & COMPANY  _Uncle Wiggily's Adventures_          =UNCLE WIGGILY'S ADVENTURES=          STORY I    UNCLE WIGGILY STARTS OFF      Uncle Wiggily Longears, the nice old gentleman rabbit, hopped out of bed  one morning and started to go to the window, to see if the sun was  shining. But, no sooner had he stepped on the floor, than he cried out:    \"Oh! Ouch! Oh, dear me and a potato pancake! Oh, I believe I stepped on a  tack! Sammie Littletail must have left it there! How careless of him!\"    You see this was the same Uncle Wiggily, of whom I have told you in the  Bedtime Books--the very same Uncle Wiggily. He was an Uncle to Sammie and  Susie Littletail, the rabbit children, and also to Billie and Johnnie  Bushytail, the squirrel boys, and to Alice and Lulu and Jimmie  Wibblewobble, the duck children, and I have written for you, books about  all those characters. Now I thought I would write something just about  Uncle Wiggily himself, though of course I'll tell you what all his nephews  and nieces did, too.    Well, when Uncle Wiggily felt that sharp pain, he stood still for a  moment, and wondered what could have happened.    \"Yes, I'm almost sure it was a tack,\" he said. \"I must pick it up so no  one else will step on it.\"    So Uncle Wiggily looked on the floor, but there was no tack there, only  some crumbs from a sugar cookie that Susie Littletail had been eating the  night before, when her uncle had told her a go-to-sleep story.    \"Oh, I know what it was; it must have been my rheumatism that gave me the  pain!\" said the old gentleman rabbit as he looked for his red, white and  blue crutch, striped like a barber pole. He found it under the bed, and  then he managed to limp to the window. Surely enough, the sun was shining.    \"I'll certainly have to do something about this rheumatism,\" said Uncle  Wiggily as he carefully shaved himself by looking in the glass. \"I guess  I'll see Dr. Possum.\"    So after breakfast, when Sammie and Susie had gone to school, Dr. Possum  was telephoned for, and he called to see Uncle Wiggily.    \"Ha! Hum!\" exclaimed the doctor, looking very wise. \"You have the  rheumatism very bad, Mr. Longears.\"    \"Why, I knew that before you came,\" said the old gentleman rabbit,  blinking his eyes. \"What I want is something to cure it.\"    \"Ha! Hum!\" said Dr. Possum, again looking very wise. \"I think you need a  change of air. You must travel about. Go on a journey, get out and see  strange birds, and pick the pretty flowers. You don't get exercise  enough.\"    \"Exercise enough!\" cried Uncle Wiggily. \"Why, my goodness me sakes alive  and a bunch of lilacs! Don't I play checkers almost every night with  Grandfather Goosey Gander?\"    \"That is not enough,\" said the doctor, \"you must travel here and there,  and see things.\"    \"Very well,\" said Uncle Wiggily, \"then I will travel. I'll pack my valise  at once, and I'll go off and seek my fortune, and maybe, on the way, I can  lose this rheumatism.\"    So the next day Uncle Wiggily started out with his crutch, and his valise  packed full of clean clothes, and something in it to eat.    \"Oh, we are very sorry to have you go, dear uncle,\" said Susie Littletail,  \"but we hope you'll come back good and strong.\"    \"Thank you,\" said Uncle Wiggily, as he kissed the two rabbit children and  their mamma, and shook hands with Papa Littletail. Then off the old  gentleman bunny hopped with his crutch.    Well, he went along for quite a distance, over the hills, and down the  road, and through the woods, and, as the sun got higher and warmer, his  rheumatism felt better.    \"I do believe Dr. Possum was right!\" said Uncle Wiggily. \"Traveling is  just the thing for me,\" and he felt so very jolly that he whistled a  little tune about a peanut wagon, which roasted lemonade, and boiled and  frizzled Easter eggs that Mrs. Cluk-Cluk laid.    \"Ha! Where are you going?\" suddenly asked a voice, as Uncle Wiggily  finished the tune.    \"I'm going to seek my fortune,\" replied Uncle Wiggily. \"Who are you,  pray?\"    \"Oh, I'm a friend of yours,\" said the voice, and Uncle Wiggily looked all  around, but he couldn't discover any one.    \"But where are you?\" the puzzled old gentleman rabbit wanted to know. \"I  can't see you.\"    \"No, and for a very good reason,\" answered the voice. \"You see I have very  weak eyes, and if I came out in the sun, without my smoked glasses on, I  might get blind. So I have to hide down in this hollow stump.\"    \"Then put on your glasses and come out where I can see you,\" invited the  old gentleman rabbit, and all the while he was trying to remember where he  had heard that voice before. At first he thought it might be Grandfather  Goosey Gander, or Uncle Butter, the goat, yet it didn't sound like either  of them.    \"I have sent my glasses to the store to be fixed, so I can't wear them and  come out,\" went on the voice. \"But if you are seeking your fortune I know  the very place where you can find it.\"    \"Where?\" asked Uncle Wiggily, eagerly.    \"Right down in this hollow stump,\" was the reply. \"There are all kinds of  fortunes here, and you may take any kind you like Mr. Longears.\"    \"Ha! That is very nice,\" thought the rabbit. \"I have not had to travel far  before finding my fortune. I wonder if there is a cure for rheumatism in  that stump, too?\" So he asked about it.    \"Of course, your rheumatism can be cured in here,\" came the quick answer.  \"In fact, I guarantee to cure any disease--measles, chicken-pox, mumps and  even toothache. So if you have any friends you want cured send them to  me.\"    \"I wish I could find out who you were,\" spoke the rabbit. \"I seem to know  your voice, but I can't think of your name.\"    \"Oh, you'll know me as soon as you see me,\" said the voice. \"Just hop  down inside this hollow stump, and your fortune is as good as made, and  your rheumatism will soon be gone. Hop right down.\"    Well, Uncle Wiggily didn't like the looks of the black hole down inside  the stump, and he peered into it to see what he could see, but it was so  black that all he could make out was something like a lump of coal.    \"Well, Dr. Possum said I needed to have a change of scene, and some  adventures,\" said the rabbit, \"so I guess I'll chance it. I'll go down,  and perhaps I may find my fortune.\"    Then, carefully holding his crutch and his satchel, Uncle Wiggily hopped  down inside the stump. He felt something soft, and furry, and fuzzy,  pressing close to him, and at first he thought he had bumped into Dottie  or Willie Lambkin.    But then, all of a sudden, a harsh voice cried out:    \"Ha! Now I have you! I was just wishing some one would come along with my  dinner, and you did! Get in there, and see if you can find your fortune,  Uncle Wiggily!\" And with that what should happen but that big, black bear,  who had been hiding in the stump, pushed Uncle Wiggily into a dark closet,  and locked the door! And there the poor rabbit was, and the bear was  getting ready to eat him up.    But don't worry, I'll find a way to get him out, and in case we have ice  cream pancakes for supper I'll tell you, in the next story, how Uncle  Wiggily got out of the bear's den, and how he went fishing--I mean Uncle  Wiggily went fishing, not the bear.          STORY II    UNCLE WIGGILY GOES FISHING      At first, after he found himself shut up in the bear's dark closet, where  we left him in the story before this, poor Uncle Wiggily didn't know what  to think. He just sat there, on the edge of a chair, and he tried to look  around, and see something, but it was too black, so he couldn't.    \"Perhaps this is only a joke,\" thought the old gentleman rabbit, \"though I  never knew a black bear to joke before. But perhaps it is. I'll ask him.\"    So Uncle Wiggily called out:    \"Is this a joke, Mr. Bear?\"    \"Not a bit of it!\" was the growling answer. \"You'll soon see what's going  to happen to you! I'm getting the fire ready now.\"    \"Getting the fire ready for what; the adventure, or for my fortune?\" asked  the rabbit, for he still hoped the bear was only joking with him.    \"Ready to cook you!\" was the reply. \"That's what the fire is for!\" and  the bear gnashed his teeth together something terrible, and, with his  sharp claws, he clawed big splinters off the stump, and with them he  started the fire in the stove, with the splinters, I mean, not his claws.    The blazing fire made it a little"]]]
