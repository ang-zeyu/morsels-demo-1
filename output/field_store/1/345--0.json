NEW YORK    LYON & HEALY  CHICAGO          THE STORY OF  \"TRISTAN AND ISOLDA\"    ACT I    Tristan, a valiant Cornish knight, is bringing Isolda, princess of  Ireland, over as a bride for his uncle, King Mark. He is himself in  love with her, but owing to a blood feud between them, forces himself  to conceal his passion. Isolda, in anger at his seeming unkindness,  attempts to poison herself and him, but her attendant, Brangaena,  changes the draft for a love potion, which enflames their passion  beyond power of restraint.      ACT II    Isolda has been wedded to King Mark, but holds stolen interviews with  Tristan, during one of which they are surprised, for Tristan has been  betrayed by a jealous friend, Melot. Touched by King Mark's bitter  reproaches, Tristan provokes Melot to fight and suffers himself to be  mortally wounded.      ACT III    Tristan's faithful servant, Kurvenal, has carried his wounded master  to his native home in Brittany, where he is carefully tended. Isolda  has also been sent for, as being skilled above all others in the  healing art. The excitement of her approach only hastens Tristan's  death, and he breathes his last sigh in her arms. Mark has followed  Isolda; he has had matters explained, and is prepared to reunite the  lovers, but it is too late. Isolda utters her lament over the body of  her lover, and her heart breaks: in death alone are they united.           *       *       *       *       *    DRAMATIS PERSONAE    TRISTAN  KING MARK  ISOLDA  KURVENAL  MELOT  BRANGAENA  A SHEPHERD  A STEERSMAN  SAILORS, KNIGHTS, AND ESQUIRES          TRISTAN AND ISOLDA.          ACT I.    [_A pavilion erected on the deck of a ship, richly hung with  tapestry, quite closed in at back at first. A narrow hatchway at one  side leads below into the cabin_.]      SCENE I.    ISOLDA _on a couch, her face buried in the cushions.  --_BRANGAENA_ holding open a curtain, looks over the side of the  vessel_.    THE VOICE OF A YOUNG SAILOR (_from above as if at the  mast-head_).    ISOLDA (_starting up suddenly_).  What wight dares insult me?    (_She looks round in agitation_.)    Brangaena, ho!  Say, where sail we?    BRANGAENA (_at the opening_).  Bluish stripes  are stretching along the west:  swiftly sails  the ship to shore;  if restful the sea by eve  we shall readily set foot on land.    ISOLDA. What land?    BRANGAENA. Cornwall's verdant strand.    ISOLDA. Never more!  To-day nor to-morrow!    BRANGAENA. What mean you, mistress? say!    (_She lets the curtain fall and hastens to_ ISOLDA.)    ISOLDA (_with wild gaze_).  O fainthearted child,  false to thy fathers!  Ah, where, mother,  hast given thy might  that commands the wave and the tempest?  O subtle art  of sorcery,  for mere leech-craft followed too long!  Awake in me once more,  power of will!  Arise from thy hiding  within my breast!  Hark to my bidding,  fluttering breezes!  Arise and storm  in boisterous strife!  With furious rage  and hurricane's hurdle  waken the sea  from slumbering calm;  rouse up the deep  to its devilish deeds!  Shew it the prey  which gladly I proffer!  Let it shatter this too daring ship  and enshrine in ocean each shred!  And woe to the lives!  Their wavering death-sighs  I leave to ye, winds, as your lot.    BRANGAENA (_in extreme alarm and concern for_ ISOLDA).  Out, alas!  Ah, woe!  I've ever dreaded some ill!--  Isolda! mistress!  Heart of mine!  What secret dost thou hide?  Without a tear  thou'st quitted thy father and mother,  and scarce a word  of farewell to friends thou gavest;  leaving home thou stood'st,  how cold and still!  pale and speechless  on the way,  food rejecting,  reft of sleep,  stern and wretched,  wild, disturbed;  how it pains me  so to see thee!  Friends no more we seem,  being thus estranged.  Make me partner  in thy pain!  Tell me freely  all thy fears!  Lady, thou hearest,  sweetest and dearest;  if for true friend you take me,  your confidant O make me!    ISOLDA. Air! air!  or my heart will choke!  Open! open there wide!    (BRANGAENA _hastily draws the centre curtains apart_.)      SCENE II.    [_The whole length of the ship is now seen, down to the stern, with  the sea and horizon beyond. Round the mainmast sailors are ensconced,  busied with ropes; beyond them in the stern are groups of knights and  attendants, also seated; a little apart stands_ TRISTAN_ folding  his arms and thoughtfully gazing out to sea; at his feet_ KURVENAL  _reclines carelessly. From the mast-head above is once more heard  the voice of the young sailor_.]    THE YOUNG SAILOR (_at the mast-head invisible_).  The wind so wild  blows homewards now;  my Irish child,  where waitest thou?  Say, must our sails be weighted,  filled by thy sighs unbated?  Waft us, wind strong and wild!  Woe, ah woe for my child!    ISOLDA (_whose eyes have at once sought_ TRISTAN _and fixed  stonily on him--gloomily_). Once beloved--  now removed--  brave and bright,  coward knight!--  Death-devoted head!  Death-devoted heart!--    (_laughing unnaturally_).    Think'st highly of yon minion?    BRANGAENA (_following her glance_).  Whom mean'st thou?    ISOLDA. There, that hero  who from mine eyes  averts his own:  in shrinking shame  my gaze he shuns--  Say, how hold you him?    BRANGAENA. Mean you Sir Tristan,  lady mine?  Extolled by ev'ry nation,  his happy country's pride,  The hero of creation,--  whose fame so high and wide?    ISOLDA (_jeeringly_).  In shrinking trepidation  his shame he seeks to hide,  While to the king, his relation,  he brings the corpse-like bride!--  Seems it so senseless  What I say?  Go ask himself,  our gracious host,  dare he approach my side?  No courteous heed  or loyal care  this hero t'wards  his lady turns;  but to meet her his heart is daunted,  this knight so highly vaunted!  Oh! he wots  well the cause!  To the traitor go,  bearing his lady's will!  As my servant bound,  straightway should he approach.    BRANGAENA. Shall I beseech him  to attend thee?    ISOLDA. Nay, order him:  pray, understand it:--  I, Isolda  do command it!    [_At an imperious sign from ISOLDA BRANGAENA withdraws and timidly  walks along the deck towards the stern, past the working sailors.  ISOLDA, following her with fixed gaze, sinks back on the couch,  where she remains seated during the following, her eyes still turned  sternward_.]    KURVENAL (_observing Brangaena's approach, plucks Tristan by the robe  without rising_.) Beware, Tristan!  Message from Isolda!    TRISTAN (_starting_). What is't?--Isolda?--    (_He quickly regains his composure as BRANGAENA approaches and  curtsies to him_.)    What would my lady?  I her liegeman,  fain will listen  while her loyal  woman tells her will.    BRANGAENA. My lord, Sir Tristan,  Dame Isolda  would have speech  with you at once.    TRISTAN. Is she with travel worn?  The end is near:  nay, ere the set of sun  sight we the land.  All that your mistress commands me,  trust me, I shall mind.    BRANGAENA. That you, Sir Tristan,  go to her,--  this is my lady's wish.    TRISTAN. Where yonder verdant meadows  in distance dim are mounting,  waits my sov'reign  for his mate:  to lead her to his presence  I'll wait upon the princess:  'tis an honor  all my own.    BRANGAENA. My lord, Sir Tristan,  list to me:  this one thing  my lady wills,  that thou at once attend her,  there where she waits for thee.    TRISTAN. In any station  where I stand  I truly serve but her,  the pearl of womanhood.  If I unheeding  left the helm,  how might I pilot her ship  in surety to King Mark?    BRANGAENA. Tristan, my master,  why mock me thus?  Seemeth my saying  obscure to you?  list to my lady's words:  thus, look you, she hath spoken:  \"Go order him,  and understand it,  I--Isolda--  do command it.\"    KURVENAL (_springing up_). May I an answer make her?    TRISTAN. What wouldst thou wish to reply?    KURVENAL. This should she say  to Dame Isold':  \"Though Cornwall's crown  and England's isle  for Ireland's child he chose,  his own by choice  she may not be;  he brings the king his bride.  A hero-knight  Tristan is hight!  I've said, nor care to measure  your lady's high displeasure.\"    [_While_ TRISTAN _seeks to stop him, and the offended_  BRANGAENA _turns to depart_, KURVENAL _sings after her at the  top of his voice, as she lingeringly withdraws_.]    \"Sir Morold toiled  o'er mighty wave  the Cornish tax to levy;  In desert isle  was dug his grave,  he died of wounds so heavy.  His head now hangs  in Irish lands,  Sole were-gild won  at English hands.  Bravo, our brave Tristan!  Let his tax take who can!\"    [KURVENAL, _driven away by_ TRISTAN'S _chidings, descends into  the cabin_. BRANGAENA _returns in discomposure to_ ISOLDA,  _closing the curtains behind her, while all the men take up the  chorus and are heard without_.]    KNIGHTS AND ATTENDANTS.  \"His head now hangs  in Irish lands,  sole were-gild won  at English hands.  Bravo, our brave Tristan!  Let his tax take who can!\"      SCENE III.    [ISOLDA _and_ BRANGAENA _alone, the curtain being again  completely closed_. ISOLDA _rises with a gesture of despair and  wrath_. BRANGAENA _falls at her feet_.]    BRANGAENA. Ah! an answer  so insulting!    ISOLDA (_checking herself on the brink of a fearful outburst_).  How now? of Tristan?  I'd know if he denies me.    BRANGAENA. Ah! question not!    ISOLDA. Quick, say without fear!    BRANGAENA. With courteous phrase  he foiled my will.    ISOLDA. But when you bade him hither?    BRANGAENA.

And he said, \"Mark--ME--boy! Be careful of your book.\"    A very charming gentleman, indeed, he seemed to be.  He heaved a sigh and wiped his eye, and then he said to me:  \"Take your books and make your books companions--never toys;  For they who so forsake their books grow into gawky boys.\"  I don't know who he was. Do you? he snuffled at the end;  And he said, \"Mark--ME--boy!

Mayhap you'll find within this book     Some touch of Youth's rare clowning,  If you will condescend to look     And not descend to frowning.    The mind of one small boy may hold     Odd fancies and inviting,  To guide a hand unsure and old     That moves, these days, to writing.  For hair once bright, in days of yore,     Grows grey (or somewhat slaty),  And now, alas, he's over four,     Though under four-and-eighty.

I couldn't eat the cakes.           Would you?        THE DAWN DANCE    What do you think I saw to-day when I arose at dawn?  Blue Wrens and Yellow-tails dancing on the lawn!  Bobbing here, and bowing there, gossiping away,  And how I wished that you were there to see the merry play!    But you were snug abed, my boy, blankets to your chin,  Nor dreamed of dancing birds without or sunbeams dancing in.  Grey Thrush, he piped the tune for them. I peeped out through the glass  Between the window curtains, and I saw them on the grass--    Merry little fairy folk, dancing up and down,  Blue bonnet, yellow skirt, cloaks of grey and brown,  Underneath the wattle-tree, silver in the dawn,  Blue Wrens and Yellow-tails dancing on the lawn.        CUPPACUMALONGA    'Rover, rover, cattle-drover, where go you to-day?'  I go to Cuppacumalonga, fifty miles away;     Over plains where Summer rains have sung a song of glee,     Over hills where laughing rills go seeking for the sea,  I go to Cuppacumalonga, to my brother Bill.        Then come along, ah, come along!           Ah, come to Cuppacumalonga!              Come to Cuppacumalonga Hill!    'Rover, rover, cattle-drover, how do you get there?'  For twenty miles I amble on upon my pony mare,     The walk awhile and talk awhile to country men I know,     Then up to ride a mile beside a team that travels slow,  And last to Cuppacumalonga, riding with a will.        Then come along, ah, come along!           Ah, come to Cuppacumalonga!              Come to Cuppacumalonga Hill!    'Rover, rover, cattle-drover, what do you do then?'  I camp beneath a kurrajong with three good cattle-men;     Then off away at break of day, with strong hands on the reins,     To laugh and sing while mustering the cattle on the plains--  For up to Cuppacumalonga life is jolly still.        Then come along, ah, come along!           Ah, come to Cuppacumalonga!              Come to Cuppacumalonga Hill!    'Rover, rover, cattle-drover, how may I go too?'  I'll saddle up my creamy colt and he shall carry you--     My creamy colt who will not bolt, who does not shy nor kick--     We'll pack the load and take the road and travel very quick.  And if the day brings work or play we'll meet it with a will.        So Hi for Cuppacumalonga!           Come Along, ah, come along!              Ah, come to Cuppacumalonga Hill!        THE SWAGMAN    Oh, he was old and he was spare;  His bushy whiskers and his hair  Were all fussed up and very grey  He said he'd come a long, long way  And had a long, long way to go.  Each boot was broken at the toe,  And he'd a swag upon his back.  His billy-can, as black as black,  Was just the thing for making tea  At picnics, so it seemed to me.    'Twas hard to earn a bite of bread,  He told me.  Then he shook his head,  And all the little corks that hung  Around his hat-brim danced and swung  And bobbed about his face; and when  I laughed he made them dance again.  He said they were for keeping flies--  \"The pesky varmints\"--from his eyes.  He called me \"Codger\". . . \"Now you see  The best days of your life,\" said he.  \"But days will come to bend your back,  And, when they come, keep off the track.  Keep off, young codger, if you can.\"  He seemed a funny sort of man.    He told me that he wanted work,  But jobs were scarce this side of Bourke,  And he supposed he'd have to go  Another fifty mile or so.  \"Nigh all my life the track I've walked,\"  He said.  I liked the way he talked.  And oh, the places he had seen!  I don't know where he had not been--  On every road, in every town,  All through the country, up and down.  \"Young codger, shun the track,\" he said.  And put his hand upon my head.  I noticed, then, that his old eyes  Were very blue and very wise.  \"Ay, once I was a little lad,\"  He said, and seemed to grow quite sad.    I sometimes think: When I'm a man,  I'll get a good black billy-can  And hang some corks around my hat,  And lead a jolly life like that.        THE ANT EXPLORER    Once a little sugar ant made up his mind to roam--  To fare away far away, far away from home.  He had eaten all his breakfast, and he had his ma's consent  To see what he should chance to see and here's the way he went--  Up and down a fern frond, round and round a stone,  Down a gloomy gully where he loathed to be alone,  Up a mighty mountain range, seven inches high,  Through the fearful forest grass that nearly hid the sky,  Out along a bracken bridge, bending in the moss,  Till he reached a dreadful desert that was feet and feet across.  'Twas a dry, deserted desert, and a trackless land to tread,  He wished that he was home again and tucked-up tight in bed.  His little legs were wobbly, his strength was nearly spent,  And so he turned around again and here's the way he went--  Back away from desert lands feet and feet across,  Back along the bracken bridge bending in the moss,  Through the fearful forest grass shutting out the sky,  Up a mighty mountain range seven inches high,  Down a gloomy gully, where he loathed to be alone,  Up and down a fern frond and round and round a stone.  A dreary ant, a weary ant, resolved no more to roam,  He staggered up the garden path and popped back home.        RIDING SONG    Flippity-flop!  Flippity-flop!  Here comes the butcher to bring us a chop     Cantering, cantering down the wide street     On his little bay mare with the funny white feet;  Cantering, cantering out to the farm,  Stripes on his apron and basket on arm.     Run to the window and tell him to stop--     Flippity-flop!  Flippity-flop!        THE FUNNY HATTER    Harry was a funny man, Harry was a hatter;  He ate his lunch at breakfast time and said it didn't matter.  He made a pot of melon jam and put it on a shelf,  For he was fond of sugar things and living by himself.  He built a fire of bracken and a blue-gum log,  And he sat all night beside it with his big--black--dog.        THE POSTMAN    I'd like to be a postman, and walk along the street,  Calling out, \"Good Morning, Sir,\" to gentlemen I meet,  Ringing every door-bell all along my beat,  In my cap and uniform so very nice and neat.  Perhaps I'd have a parasol in case of rain or heat;     But I wouldn't be a postman if . . .         The walking hurt my feet.           Would you?        THE TRAVELLER    As I rode in to Burrumbeet,  I met a man with funny feet;  And, when I paused to ask him why  His feet were strange, he rolled his eye  And said the rain would spoil the wheat;  So I rode on to Burrumbeet.    As I rode in to Beetaloo,  I met a man whose nose was blue;  And when I asked him how he got  A nose like that, he answered, \"What  Do bullocks mean when they say 'Moo'?\"  So I rode on to Beetaloo.    As I rode in to Ballarat,  I met a man who wore no hat;  And, when I said he might take cold,  He cried, \"The hills are quite as old  As yonder plains, but not so flat.\"  So I rode on to Ballarat.    As I rode in to Gundagai,  I met a man and passed him by  Without a nod, without a word.  He turned, and said he'd never heard  Or seen a man so wise as I.  But I rode on to Gundagai.    As I rode homeward, full of doubt,  I met a stranger riding out:  A foolish man he seemed to me;  But, \"Nay, I am yourself,\" said he,  \"Just as you were when you rode out.\"  So I rode homeward, free of doubt.        OUR STREET    In our street, the main street     Running thro' the town,  You see a lot of busy folk     Going up and down:"]]]
