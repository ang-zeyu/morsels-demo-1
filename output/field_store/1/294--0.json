Like other strangely formed quadrupeds, the jerboas are counted among  the curiosities of the animal kingdom, and as such are described in  natural history; but, nevertheless, there has never been a good  exhibition of them, for the simple reason that live jerboas are seldom  seen in Europe, as they usually die during the journey hither or soon  after their arrival. After some hesitation I decided to purchase a  pair that I happened to find mentioned in the price list of Mr. C.  Reiche, of Alfeld, as one of the most interesting specimens obtained  during his expedition to South Africa the year before; but I, also,  found the sensitiveness and delicacy of the jerboa very trying, for  the short journey from Alfeld to this city caused the death of the  female and reduced her mate to such a condition that when it arrived  there seemed little hope that it could ever be utilized for scientific  research or artistic life studies.    [Illustration: JERBOA IN THE ZOOLOGICAL GARDEN OF BERLIN.--DRAWN FROM  LIFE BY G. MUTZEL.]    My anticipation and pleasure were changed to vexation and grief. The  most careful nursing--the stiff, weak little legs were dipped into and  rubbed with French brandy--and a warm pen with a dry sanded floor  directly over a heater, did their work. As the new-comer got on his  feet again my hope gained new life, and now our jerboa is my delight.  It is, indeed, a curious animal. One who saw it only in the day time  asleep would scarcely know what he had before him, for he would see  little more than a mass of soft, bright sandy hair. The coming of the  keeper with the dish of food and the unfastening of the door of the  cage bring life to the ball of hair in the corner; a part of it is  unrolled and the long, black-tipped tail with two lines of hair is  laid out on the ground, and then on each side of it a leg is run out  which is nearly as long as the tail and is provided with blunt,  smooth, hoof-life nails; and, finally, the head and body are  distinguishable and the animal stretches out comfortably on its back  in the sand. The fine-skinned, hairless ears still hang limp, the eyes  are half closed and the short fore legs are crossed under the chin.    But now the animal gets on its legs by an elastic swing, and its ears  are raised and its eyes wide open, so that we can see that the latter  are large and dark, with long eyelashes. Then the jerboa raises  himself to his full height and playfully measures his cage by one  bound from corner to corner. Soon after, the fresh food receives due  attention, the animal either jumping toward it in rabbit fashion or  crawling slowly on all fours. When it has reached its goal it again  assumes the upright position, in which it is evidently most  comfortable, and begins to eat it in his own peculiar way; that is,  sitting on his hind legs he quickly seizes a piece of bread, turnip or  other food in his fore paws and conveys it to his mouth, apparently  indifferent to the nature of the food before him. He never takes  anything directly in his mouth; even the grass on a piece of turf that  I had given to him as an experiment was not eaten as it would have  been eaten by other animals, but was first plucked with the fore paws.  If we notice the position of the mouth, far back on the under side of  the head, we will understand that the jerboa could not take his food  in any other way. Besides this, nothing of special interest has been  observed in this nocturnal creature, but he, of course, lives more  regularly and quietly than if his mate had lived.    One who knows anything about the structure of animals' bodies need not  be told that the jerboa is a rodent. One glance at the peculiar shape  of his head would assure him of that. The form of the rest of its  body, especially its long hind and short fore legs, give unmistakable  proof that it is related to the jumping rodents; it belongs, in a wide  sense, to the family of the jumping mouse, the scientific name  (Dipodidea, two-footed) of which is very significant, as the very  short fore legs are usually carried close under the chin and are  scarcely noticeable when the animal is in its normal position, and are  of little use when it moves about. The hind legs are very strong, and  when going at full speed the jerboa takes jumps that measure from  eight to ten yards, according to the unanimous testimony of various  witnesses.    The jumping mouse of North America, which is somewhat larger than an  ordinary mouse, is, according to Brehm, also as swift as an arrow or a  low-flying bird. This exceptional velocity is not all that reminds us  of a bird, for there is also a strong resemblance in the formation of  certain parts of the bodies of the two creatures; but, after  consideration, this should not seem strange, because in animal  organisms similar means are employed to accomplish similar ends. It is  only natural that there should "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15199"],[0,"The Reformed Librarie-Keeper (1650) (#1)"],[1,"AUGUSTAN REPRINT SOCIETY      THE REFORMED LIBRARIE-KEEPER    (1650)      JOHN DURY      _Introduction by_    RICHARD H.

John Dury was a very important figure in the Puritan  Revolution, offering proposal after proposal to prepare England for its  role in the millennium. _The Reformed Librarie-Keeper_ is an integral  part of that preparation. To appreciate it one must look at it in terms  of the plans of Dury and his associates, Samuel Hartlib and Johann Amos  Comenius, to reform the intellectual institutions of England so that the  prophecies in the books of Daniel and Revelation could be fulfilled  there.    John Dury (1596-1680), the son of a Scottish Puritan, was raised in  Holland.[1] He studied at the University of Leiden, then at the French  Reformed seminaries at Sedan and Leiden, and later at Oxford. He was  ordained a Protestant minister and served first at Cologne and then at  the English church in the West Prussian city of Elbing. There he came in  contact with Samuel Hartlib (?-1662), a merchant, who was to devote  himself to many religious and scientific projects in England, and with  Johann Amos Comenius (1592-1670), the leader of the Moravian Brethren,  as well as with other great educational reformers of the Continent. The  three of them shared a common vision--that the advancement of knowledge,  the purification of the Christian churches, and the impending conversion  of the Jews were all antecedent steps to the commencement in the  foreseeable future of the millennium, the thousand-year reign of Christ  on earth. They saw the struggles of the Thirty Years' War and the  religious conflict in England as part of their development of  providential history.    In terms of their common vision, each of them strove during the decade  1630-40 to help the world prepare for the great events to come. Comenius  started redoing the educational system through his textbooks and set  forth plans for attaining universal knowledge. Hartlib moved from  Germany to England, where he became a central organizing figure in both  the nascent scientific world and the theological world. He was in  contact with a wide variety of intellectuals and brought their ideas  together. (For instance, he apprised Dury of the millenarian theory of  Joseph Mede, which was to be so influential in the Puritan Revolution,  and he spread Comenius's ideas in England.) Dury devoted himself  principally to trying to unite all of the Protestant churches in Europe  and to this end began his peregrinations from Sweden and Germany to  Holland, Switzerland, France, and England. These travels were to  continue throughout the rest of his life, as he tried to negotiate an  agreement on the essentials of Christianity in preparation for Jesus'  return.    In 1640, as the Puritan Revolution began, Hartlib, Comenius, and Dury  saw the developments in England as the opportunity to put their  scientific-religious plans into effect. They joined together in London  in 1641 and, with strong support, offered proposals to prepare England  for the millennium. They proposed setting up a new university in London  for developing universal knowledge. In spite of the strong backing they  had from leaders of the State and Church, Parliament was unable to fund  the project because of the turmoil of the time. Comenius left for the  Continent, while Hartlib and Dury advanced other projects and involved  themselves in the Westminster conference to reform the Church.[2]    Hugh Trevor-Roper has called Hartlib, Dury, and Comenius \"the real  philosophers, the only philosophers, of the English Revolution.\"[3] They  combined a long list of practical plans with an overall vision of how  these fitted into the needed antecedent events to the millennium. They  made proposals for improving and reforming many aspects of human  activities and human institutions. The advancement of knowledge, the  improvement of human life, and the purification of religion, which  included bringing the Jews and Christians together, would prepare  England for its role when God chose to transform human history. In a  long series of pamphlets and tracts, Hartlib and Dury turned Comenius's  theory into practical applications to the situation then prevailing in  England.[4]    Dury outlined this program in a sermon he gave before Parliament on 26  November 1645 entitled _Israels Call to March Out of Babylon unto  Jerusalem_. He pointed out that England, the new Israel, had a special  role in history, \"for the Nations of great _Britain_ have made a new  thing in the world; a thing which hath not been done by any Nation in  the world, since the preaching of the Gospel in it, a thing which since  the Jewish Nation, in the daies of _Nehemiah_, was never heard of in any  Nation, that not only the Rulers, but the whole multitude of the people  should enter into a Covenant with their God, ... to walk in the waies  of his Word, to maintain the Cause of Religion, and to reform themselves  according to his will\" (pp. 23-24).    Since England was to be God's agent in history, Dury proclaimed at the  end of his sermon that \"The Schooles of the Prophets, the  Universities[,] must be setled, purged and reformed with wholsom  constitutions, for the education of the sonnes of the Prophets, and the  government of their lives and with the soundnes and purity of spirituall  learning, that they may speak the true language of _Canaan_, and that  the gibberidge of Scholastical Divinity may be banished out of their  society\" (p. 48).    In the same year that he delivered this sermon, Dury married an aunt of  Lady Catherine Ranelagh and was brought in closer contact with Lady  Catherine's brother, Robert Boyle, and the young scientists of the  so-called Invisible College. Dury and Hartlib pressed for reforms that  would promote a better, more useful education from the lowest grades  upward. Convinced by the passage in Daniel 12:4 that knowledge shall  increase before the end of history, Dury and Hartlib sought various  opportunities to bring about this increase in knowledge through better  schools, better religious training, and better organization of  knowledge. Such organization would necessarily affect libraries since  they were an all-important component of the premillennial preparation.    Between 1645 and 1650, Dury wrote a great many tracts on improving the  Church and society. These include an as yet unpublished one, dated 16  August 1646, giving his views on the post of library keeper at Oxford.  The poor state of Oxford's library led Dury to observe that the  librarian is to be \"a factor and trader for helpes to learning, a  treasurer to keep them and a dispenser to apply them to use, or to see  them well used, or at least not abused.\"[5] During his travels on the  Continent, Dury had visited Duke Augustus of Brunswick and was obviously  very impressed by the great library the Duke was assembling at  Wolfenbuttel. In his important _Seasonable Discourse_ of 1649 on  reforming religion and learning, Dury had proposed establishing in  London the first college for Jewish studies in the modern world. In this  proposal, he saw as a basic need the procurement of a collection of  Oriental books. Such a library was not just to store materials, but to  make them available and thereby increase knowledge. Hartlib, in a  pamphlet entitled _Considerations tending to the Happy Accomplishment of  England's Reformation in Church and State_, written in 1647 and  published in 1649, had proposed a central \"Office of Addresse,\" an  information service dispensing spiritual and \"bodily\" information to all  who wished it. The holder of this office should, he said, correspond  with \"Chiefe Library-Keepers of all places, whose proper employments  should bee to trade for the Advantages of Learning and Learned Men in  Books and MS[S] to whom he may apply himselfe to become beneficiall,  that such as Mind The End of their employment may reciprocate with him  in the way of Communication\" (p. 49).    Events surrounding the overthrow and execution of Charles I led Dury to  become more personally involved in library matters. After the king fled  from London, the royal goods were subject to various proposals,  including selling or burning. These schemes of disposal extended to his  books and manuscripts, which were stored in St. James's Palace. John  Selden is credited with preventing the sale of the royal library.
