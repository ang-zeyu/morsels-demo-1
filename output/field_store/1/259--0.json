NEW YORK: CHARLES SCRIBNER'S SONS.    TO    ANDREW LANG          PREFACE      The scientific study of ancient Celtic religion is a thing of recent  growth. As a result of the paucity of materials for such a study,  earlier writers indulged in the wildest speculative flights and  connected the religion with the distant East, or saw in it the remains  of a monotheistic faith or a series of esoteric doctrines veiled under  polytheistic cults. With the works of MM. Gaidoz, Bertrand, and D'Arbois  de Jubainville in France, as well as by the publication of Irish texts  by such scholars as Drs. Windisch and Stokes, a new era may be said to  have dawned, and a flood of light was poured upon the scanty remains of  Celtic religion. In this country the place of honour among students of  that religion belongs to Sir John Rh[^y]s, whose Hibbert Lectures _On  the Origin and Growth of Religion as illustrated by Celtic Heathendom_  (1886) was an epoch-making work. Every student of the subject since that  time feels the immense debt which he owes to the indefatigable  researches and the brilliant suggestions of Sir John Rh[^y]s, and I  would be ungrateful if I did not record my indebtedness to him. In his  Hibbert Lectures, and in his later masterly work on _The Arthurian  Legend_, however, he took the standpoint of the \"mythological\" school,  and tended to see in the old stories myths of the sun and dawn and the  darkness, and in the divinities sun-gods and dawn-goddesses and a host  of dark personages of supernatural character. The present writer,  studying the subject rather from an anthropological point of view and in  the light of modern folk survivals, has found himself in disagreement  with Sir John Rh[^y]s on more than one occasion. But he is convinced  that Sir John would be the last person to resent this, and that, in  spite of his mythological interpretations, his Hibbert Lectures must  remain as a source of inspiration to all Celtic students. More recently  the studies of M. Salomon Reinach and of M. Dottin, and the valuable  little book on _Celtic Religion_, by Professor Anwyl, have broken fresh  ground.[1]    In this book I have made use of all the available sources, and have  endeavoured to study the subject from the comparative point of view and  in the light of the anthropological method. I have also interpreted the  earlier cults by means of recent folk-survivals over the Celtic area  wherever it has seemed legitimate to do so. The results are summarised  in the introductory chapter of the work, and students of religion, and  especially of Celtic religion, must judge how far they form a true  interpretation of the earlier faith of our Celtic forefathers, much of  which resembles primitive religion and folk-belief everywhere.    Unfortunately no Celt left an account of his own religion, and we are  left to our own interpretations, more or less valid, of the existing  materials, and to the light shed on them by the comparative study of  religions. As this book was written during a long residence in the Isle  of Skye, where the old language of the people still survives, and where  the _genius loci_ speaks everywhere of things remote and strange, it may  have been easier to attempt to realise the ancient religion there than  in a busier or more prosaic place. Yet at every point I have felt how  much would have been gained could an old Celt or Druid have revisited  his former haunts, and permitted me to question him on a hundred matters  which must remain obscure. But this, alas, might not be!    I have to thank Miss Turner and Miss Annie Gilchrist for valuable help  rendered in the work of research, and the London Library for obtaining  for me several works not already in its possession. Its stores are an  invaluable aid to all students working at a distance from libraries.    J.A. MACCULLOCH.    THE RECTORY,  BRIDGE OF ALLAN,  _October_ 1911.

To  William Heney Channing,  My Friend and Fellow-Student  During Many Years,  This Work  Is Affectionately Inscribed.          Preface.        The first six chapters of the present volume are composed from six  articles prepared for the Atlantic Monthly, and published in that magazine  in 1868. They attracted quite as much attention as the writer anticipated,  and this has induced him to enlarge them, and add other chapters. His aim  is to enable the reader to become acquainted with the doctrines and  customs of the principal religions of the world, without having to consult  numerous volumes. He has not come to the task without some preparation,  for it is more than twenty-five years since he first made of this study a  speciality. In this volume it is attempted to give the latest results of  modern investigations, so far as any definite and trustworthy facts have  been attained. But the writer is well aware of the difficulty of being  always accurate in a task which involves such interminable study and such  an amount of details. He can only say, in the words of a Hebrew writer:  \"If I have done well, and as is fitting the story, it is that which I  desired; but if slenderly and meanly, it is that which I could attain  unto.\"          Contents.

When completed, this comparison ought to show what  each is, what it contains, wherein it resembles the others, wherein it  differs from the others; its origin and development, its place in  universal history; its positive and negative qualities, its truths and  errors, and its influence, past, present, or future, on the welfare of"]]]
