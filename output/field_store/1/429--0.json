We think the twins are  going to have measles; it's the only thing they haven't had, and  Letty's spirits are not up to concert pitch. You look like a blessed  old prophet to-night, my dear! What's the text?\"    The minister pushed back his spectacles and ruffled his gray hair.    \"Isaiah VI, 8: '_And I heard the voice of the Lord, saying  whom shall I send?... Then said I, Here am I, send me!_'\"    \"It doesn't sound a bit like Christmas, somehow.\"    \"It has the spirit, if it hasn't the sound,\" said the minister. \"There  is always so little spare money in the village that we get less and  less accustomed to sharing what we have with others. I want to remind  the people that there are different ways of giving, and that the  bestowing of one's self in service and good deeds can be the best of  all gifts. Letty Boynton won't need the sermon!--Don't be late, Reba.\"    \"Of course not. When was I ever late? It has just struck seven and  I'll be back by eight to choose the hymns. And oh! Luther, I have some  fresh ideas for Christmas cards and I am going to try my luck with  them in the marts of trade. There are hundreds of thousands of such  things sold nowadays; and if the 'Boston Banner' likes my verses well  enough to send me the paper regularly, why shouldn't the people who  make cards like them too, especially when I can draw and paint my own  pictures?\"    \"I've no doubt they'll like them; who wouldn't? If the parish knew  what a ready pen you have, they'd suspect that you help me in my  sermons! The question is, will the publishers send you a check, or  only a copy of your card?\"    \"I should relish a check, I confess; but oh! I should like almost as  well a beautifully colored card, Luther, with a picture of my own  inventing on it, my own verse, and R. L. in tiny letters somewhere in  the corner! It would make such a lovely Christmas present! And I  should be so proud; inside of course, not outside! I would cover my  halo with my hat so that nobody in the congregation would ever notice  it!\"    The minister laughed.    \"Consult Letty, my dear. David used to be in some sort of picture  business in Boston. She will know, perhaps, where to offer your  card!\"    At the introduction of a new theme into the conversation Mrs. Larrabee  slipped into a chair by the door, her lantern swinging in her hand.    \"David can't be as near as Boston or we should hear of him sometimes.  A pretty sort of brother to be meandering foot-loose over the earth,  and Letty working her fingers to the bone to support his  children--twins at that! It was just like David Gilman to have twins!  Doesn't it seem incredible that he can let Christmas go by without a  message? I dare say he doesn't even remember that his babies were born  on Christmas eve. To be sure he is only Letty's half-brother, but  after all they grew up together and are nearly the same age.\"    \"You always judged David a little severely, Reba. Don't despair of  reforming any man till you see the grass growing over his bare bones.  I always have a soft spot in my heart for him when I remember his  friendship for my Dick; but that was before your time.--Oh! these  boys, these boys!\" The minister's voice quavered. \"We give them our  very life-blood. We love them, cherish them, pray over them, do our  best to guide them, yet they take the path that leads from home. In  some way, God knows how, we fail to call out the return love, or even  the filial duty and respect!--Well, we won't talk about it, Reba; my  business is to breathe the breath of life into my text: 'Here am I,  Lord, send me!' Letty certainly continues to say it heroically,  whatever her troubles.\"    \"Yes, Letty is so ready for service that she will always be sent, till  the end of time; but if David ever has an interview with his Creator  I can hear him say: 'Here am I, Lord; send Letty!'\"    The minister laughed again. He laughed freely and easily nowadays. His  first wife had been a sort of understudy for a saint, and after a  brief but depressing connubial experience she had died, leaving him  with a boy of six; a boy who already, at that tender age, seemed to  cherish a passionate aversion to virtue in any form--the result,  perhaps, of daily doses of the catechism administered by an abnormally  pious mother.    The minister had struggled valiantly with his paternal and parochial  cares for twelve lonely years when he met, wooed, and won (very much  to his astonishment and exaltation) Reba Crosby. There never was a  better bargain driven! She was forty-five by the family Bible but  twenty-five in face, heart, and mind, while he would have been printed  as sixty in \"Who's Who in New Hampshire\" although he was far older in  patience and experience and wisdom. The minister was spiritual, frail,  and a trifle prone to self-depreciation; the minister's new wife was  spirited, vigorous, courageous, and clever. She was also Western-born,  college-bred, good as gold, and invincibly, incurably gay. The  minister grew younger every year, for Reba doubled his joys and halved  his burdens, tossing them from one of her fine shoulders to the other  as if they were feathers. She swept into the quiet village life of  Beulah like a salt sea breeze. She infused a new spirit into the bleak  church \"sociables\" and made them positively agreeable functions. The  choir ceased from wrangling, the Sunday School plucked up courage and  flourished like a green bay tree. She managed the deacons, she braced  up the missionary societies, she captivated the parish, she cheered  the depressed and depressing old ladies and cracked jokes with the  invalids.    \"Ain't she a little mite too jolly for a minister's wife?\" questioned  Mrs. Ossian Popham, who was a professional pessimist.    \"If this world is a place of want, woe, wantonness, an' wickedness,  same as you claim, Maria, I don't see how a minister's wife _can_ be  too jolly!\" was her husband's cheerful reply. \"Look how she's melted  up the ice in both congregations, so't the other church is most  willin' we should prosper, so long as Mis' Larrabee stays here an' we  don't get too fur ahead of 'em in attendance. Me for the smiles,  Maria!\"    And Osh Popham was right; for Reba Larrabee convinced the members of  the rival church (the rivalry between the two being in rigidity of  creed, not in persistency in good works) that there was room in heaven  for at least two denominations; and said that if they couldn't unite  in this world, perhaps they'd get round to it in the next. Finally,  she saved Letitia Boynton's soul alive by giving her a warm,  understanding friendship, and she even contracted to win back the  minister's absent son some time or other, and convince him of the  error of his ways.    \"Let Dick alone a little longer, Luther,\" she would say; \"don't hurry  him, for he won't come home so long as he's a failure; it would please  the village too much, and Dick hates the village. He doesn't accept  our point of view, that we must love our enemies and bless them that  despitefully use us. The village did despitefully use Dick, and for  that matter, David Gilman too. They were criticized, gossiped about,  judged without mercy. Nobody believed in them, nobody ever praised  them;--and what is that about praise being the fructifying sun in  which our virtues ripen, or something like that? I'm not quoting it  right, but I wish I'd said it. They were called wild when most of  their wildness was exuberant vitality; their mistakes were magnified,  their mad pranks exaggerated. If I'd been married to you, my dear,  while Dick was growing up, I wouldn't have let you keep him here in  this little backwater of life; he needed more room, more movement.  They wouldn't have been so down on him in Racine, Wisconsin!\"    Mrs. Larrabee lighted her lantern, closed the door behind her, and  walked briskly down the lonely road that led from the parsonage at  Beulah Corner to Letitia Boynton's house. It was bright moonlight and  the ground was covered with light-fallen snow, but the lantern habit  was a fixed one among Beulah ladies, who, even when they were not  widows or spinsters, made their evening calls mostly without escort.  The light of a lantern not only enabled one to pick the better side of  a bad road, but would illuminate the face of any male stranger who  might be of a burglarious or murderous disposition. Reba Larrabee was  not a timid person; indeed, she was wont to say that men were so  scarce in Beulah that unless they were out-and-out ruffians it would  be an inspiration to meet a few, even if it were only to pass them in  the middle of the road.    There was a light in the meeting-house as she passed, and then there  was a long stretch of shining white silence unmarked by any human  habitation till she came to the tumble-dow"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17461"],[0,"The Great German Composers (#1)"],[1,"GREAT GERMAN COMPOSERS      By George T.

The special attention given to certain names  has been prompted as much by their association with great art-epochs as  by the consideration of their absolute rank as composers.    The introduction of Chopin, born a Pole, and for a large part of his  life a resident of France, among the German composers, may require  an explanatory word. Chopin's whole early training was in the German  school, and he may be looked on as one of the founders of the latest  school of pianoforte composition, whose highest development is in  contemporary Germany. He represents German music by his affinities  and his influences in art, and bears too close a relation to important  changes in musical form to be omitted from this series.    The authorities to which the author is most indebted for material are:  Schoelcher's \"Life of Handel;\" Liszt's \"Life of Chopin;\" Elise  Polko's \"Reminiscences;\" Lampadius's \"Life of Mendelssohn;\" Chorley's  \"Reminiscences;\" Urbino's \"Musical Composers;\" Franz Heuffner's \"Wagner  and the Music of the Future;\" Haweis's \"Music and Morals;\" and articles  in the leading Cyclopaedias.

I.    The growth and development of German music are eminently noteworthy  facts in the history of the fine arts. In little more than a century  and a half it reached its present high and brilliant place, its progress  being so consecutive and regular that the composers who illustrated  its well-defined epochs might fairly have linked hands in one connected  series.    To Johann Sebastian Bach must be accorded the title of \"father of modern  music.\" All succeeding composers have bowed with reverence before his  name, and acknowledged in him the creative mind which not only placed  music on a deep scientific basis, but perfected the form from Which  have been developed the wonderfully rich and varied phases of orchestral  composition.    Handel, who was his contemporary, having been born the same year, spoke  of him with sincere admiration, and called him the giant of music. Haydn  wrote: \"Whoever understands me knows that I owe much to Sebastian Bach,  that I have studied him thoroughly and well, and that I acknowledge him  only as my model.\" Mozart's unceasing research brought to light many of  his unpublished manuscripts, and helped Germany to a full appreciation  of this great master. In like manner have the other luminaries of music  placed on record their sense of obligation to one whose name is obscure  to the general public in comparison with many of his brother composers.    Sebastian Bach was born at Eisenach on the 21st of March, 1685, the son  of one of the court musicians. Left in the care of his elder brother,  who was an organist, his brilliant powers displayed themselves at an  early period. He was the descendant of a race of musicians, and even at  that date the wide-spread branches of the family held annual gatherings  of a musical character. Young Bach mastered for himself, without much  assistance, a thorough musical education at Luene-burg, where he studied  in the gymnasium and sang in the cathedral choir; and at the age of  eighteen we find him court musician at Weimar, where a few years later  he became organist and director of concerts. He had in the mean time  studied the organ at Luebeck under the celebrated Buxtehude, and made  himself thoroughly a master of the great Italian composers of sacred  music--Palestrina, Lotti, Vivaldi, and others.    At this period Germany was beginning to experience its musical  _renaissance_. The various German courts felt that throb of life and  enthusiasm which had distinguished the Italian principalities in the  preceding century in the direction of painting and sculpture. Every  little capital was a focus of artistic rays, and there was a general  spirit of rivalry among the princes, who aspired to cultivate the arts  of peace as well as those of war. Bach had become known as a gifted  musician, not only by his wonderful powers as an organist, but by two  of his earlier masterpieces--\"Gott ist mein Koenig\" and \"Ich hatte viel  Bektlmmerniss.\" Under the influence of an atmosphere so artistic, Bach's  ardor for study increased with his success, and his rapid advancement in  musical power met with warm appreciation.    While Bach held the position of director of the chapel of Prince Leopold  of Anhalt-Kothen, which he assumed about the year 1720, he went to  Hamburg on a pilgrimage to see old Reinke, then nearly a centenarian,  whose fame as an organist was national, and had long been the object  of Bach's enthusiasm. The aged man listened while his youthful rival  improvised on the old choral, \"Upon the Rivers of Babylon.\" He shed  tears of joy while he tenderly embraced Bach, and said: \"I did think  that this art would die with me; but I see that you will keep it alive.\"    Our musician rapidly became known far and wide throughout the musical  centres of Germany as a learned and recondite composer, as a brilliant  improviser, and as an organist beyond rivalry. Yet it was in these last  two capacities that his reputation among his contemporaries was the most  marked. It was left to a succeeding generation to fully enlighten the  world in regard to his creative powers as a musical thinker.      II.    Though Bach's life was mostly spent at Weimar and Leipsic, he was at  successive periods chapel-master and concert-director at several of the  German courts, which aspired to shape public taste in matters of musical  culture and enthusiasm. But he was by nature singularly retiring and  unobtrusive, and he recoiled from several brilliant offers which would  have brought him too much in contact with the gay world of fashion,  apparently dreading any diversion from a severe and exclusive art-life;  for within these limits all his hopes, energies, and wishes were  focalized. Yet he was not without that keen spirit of rivalry, that love  of combat, which seems to be native to spirits of the more robust and  energetic type.    In the days of the old Minnesingers, tournaments of music shared the  public taste with tournaments of arms. In Bach's time these public  competitions were still in vogue. One of these was held by Augustus  II., Elector of Saxony and King of Poland, one of the most munificent  art-patrons of Europe, but best known to fame from his intimate part in  the wars of Charles XII. of Sweden and Peter the Great of Russia. Here  Bach's principal rival was a French _virtuoso_, Marchand, who, an exile  from Paris, had delighted the king by the lightness and brilliancy of  his execution. They were both to improvise on the same theme. Marchand  heard Bach's performance, and signalized his own inferiority by  declining to play, and secretly leaving the city of Dresden. Augustus  sent Bach a hundred louis d'or, but this splendid _douceur_ never  reached him, as it was appropriated by one of the court officials.    In Bach's half-century of a studious musical life there is but little  of stirring incident to record. The significance of his career was  interior, not exterior. Twice married, and the father of twenty  children, his income was always small even for that age. Yet, by  frugality, the simple wants of himself and his family never overstepped  the limit of supply; for he seems to have been happily mated with wives  who sympathized with his exclusive devotion to art, and united with this  the virtues of old-fashioned German thrift.    Three years before his death, Bach, who had a son in the service of the  King of Prussia, yielded to the urgent invitation of that monarch to  go to Berlin. Frederick II., the conqueror of Rossbach, and one of the  greatest of modern soldiers, was a passionate lover of literature and  art, and it was his pride to collect at his court all the leading lights  of European culture. He was not only the patron of Voltaire, whose  connection with the Prussian monarch has furnished such rich material  to the anecdote-history of literature, but of all the distinguished  painters, poets, and musicians, whom he could persuade by his  munificent offers (but rarely fulfilled) to suffer the burden of his  eccentricities. Frederick was not content with playing the part of  patron, but must himself also be poet, philosopher, painter, and  composer.    On the night of Bach's arrival Frederick was taking part in a concert  at his palace, and, on hearing that the great musician whose name was  in the mouths of all Germany had come, immediately sent for him without  allowing him to don a court dress, interrupting his concert with the  enthusiastic announcement, \"Gentlemen, Bach is here.\" The cordial  hospitality and admiration of Frederick was gratefully acknowledged by  Bach, who dedicated to him a three-part fugue on a theme composed by the  king, known under the name of \"A Musical Offering.\" But he could not be  persuaded to remain long from his Leipsic home.    Shortly before Bach's death, he was seized with blindness, brought on by  incessant labor; and his end was supposed to have been hastened by the  severe inflammation consequent on two operations performed by an English  oculist. He departed this life July 30, 1750, and was buried in St.  John's churchyard, universally mourned by musical Germany, though his  real title to exceptional greatness was not to be read until the next  generation.      III.    Sebastian Bach was not only the descendant of a widely-known musical  family, but was himself the direct ancestor of about sixty of the  best-known organists and church composers of Germany.
