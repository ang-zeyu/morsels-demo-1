The daily  life of the common people--their joys and sorrows, their hopes,  achievements, and ideals--has been buried in oblivion. The historical  narratives of the Bible are, indeed, to a great extent an exception to  this rule. They tell us much about the everyday life of peasants and  slaves. The Bible's chief heroes were not kings nor nobles. Its  supreme Hero was a peasant workingman. But we have not always studied  the Bible from this point of view. In this course we shall try to  reconstruct for ourselves the story of the Hebrew people as an account  of Hebrew shepherds, farmers, and such like: what oppressions they  endured; how they were delivered; and above all what ideals of  righteousness and truth and mercy they cherished, and how they came to  think and feel about God. It makes little difference to us what  particular idler at any particular time sat in the palace at Jerusalem  sending forth tax-collectors to raise funds for his luxuries. It is of  very great interest and concern to us if there were daughters like  Ruth in the barley fields of Bethlehem, if shepherds tended their  flocks in that same country who were so fine in heart and simple in  faith that to them or their children visions of angels might appear  telling of a Saviour of the world. On such as these, in this study,  let us as far as possible fix our attention.          CHAPTER I    SHEPHERDS ON THE BORDER OF THE DESERT      Ancient Arabia is the home of that branch of the white race known as  the Semitic. Here on the fertile fringes of well-watered land  surrounding the great central desert lived the Phoenicians, the  Assyrians, the Babylonians, and the Canaanites who, before the  Hebrews, inhabited Palestine. So little intermixing of races has there  been that the Arabs of to-day, like those of the time of Abraham, are  Semites.    The Hebrew people are an offshoot of this same Semitic group. They  began their career as a tribe of shepherds on the border of the north  Arabian desert. The Arab shepherds of to-day, still living in tents  and wandering to and fro on the fringes of the settled territory of  Palestine, or to the south and west of Bagdad, represent almost  perfectly what the wandering Hebrew shepherds used to be.    The Arabs of to-day are armed with rifles, whereas Abraham's warriors  cut down their enemies with bronze swords. Otherwise, in customs,  superstitions, and even to some extent in language, the modern desert  Arabs may stand for the ancient Hebrews in their earliest period. They  were nomads with no settled homes. Every rainy season they led out  their flocks into the valleys where the fresh green of the new grass  was crowding back the desert brown. All through the spring and early  summer they went from spring to spring, and from pasture to pasture  seeking the greenest and tenderest grass. Then as the dry season came  on and the barren waste came creeping back they also worked their way  back toward the more settled farm lands, until autumn found them  selling their wool to the nearby farmers and townspeople in exchange  for wheat and barley and some of the other necessaries of life.      THE SHEPHERD'S DAILY LIFE    Sheep-raising might seem at times a peaceful and even a somewhat  monotonous business. The flocks found their own food, grazing in the  pastures. Morning and night they had to be watered, the water being  drawn from the well and poured into watering troughs. Once or twice a  day also the ewes and shegoats had to be milked. When these chores  were done it was only necessary to stand guard over the flock and  protect them from robbers or wild animals. This, however, had to be  done by night as well as by day. On these wide pastures there were no  sheepfolds into which the animals could be securely herded as on the  settled farms. They slept on the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18193"],[0,"Ways of Wood Folk (#1)"],[1,"http://www.pgdp.net            [Illustration]          WAYS OF WOOD FOLK    BY    WILLIAM J. LONG      _FIRST SERIES_    [Illustration]    BOSTON, U.S.A.  GINN & COMPANY, PUBLISHERS  The Athenaeum Press  1902          COPYRIGHT, 1899  BY WILLIAM J. LONG    ALL RIGHTS RESERVED          TO PLATO, the owl, who looks  over my shoulder as I write, and  who knows all about the woods.          PREFACE.    \"All crows are alike,\" said a wise man, speaking of politicians. That  is quite true--in the dark. By daylight, however, there is as much  difference, within and without, in the first two crows one meets as in  the first two men or women. I asked a little child once, who was  telling me all about her chicken, how she knew her chicken from twenty  others just like him in the flock. \"How do I know my chicken? I know  him by his little face,\" she said. And sure enough, the face, when you  looked at it closely, was different from all other faces.    This is undoubtedly true of all birds and all animals. They recognize  each other instantly amid multitudes of their kind; and one who  watches them patiently sees quite as many odd ways and individualities  among Wood Folk as among other people. No matter, therefore, how well  you know the habits of crows or the habits of caribou in general,  watch the first one that crosses your path as if he were an entire  stranger; open eyes to see and heart to interpret, and you will surely  find some new thing, some curious unrecorded way, to give delight to  your tramp and bring you home with a new interest.    This individuality of the wild creatures will account, perhaps, for  many of these Ways, which can seem no more curious or startling to the  reader than to the writer when he first discovered them. They are,  almost entirely, the records of personal observation in the woods and  fields. Occasionally, when I know my hunter or woodsman well, I have  taken his testimony, but never without weighing it carefully, and  proving it whenever possible by watching the animal in question for  days or weeks till I found for myself that it was all true.    The sketches are taken almost at random from old note-books and summer  journals. About them gather a host of associations, of  living-over-agains, that have made it a delight to write them;  associations of the winter woods, of apple blossoms and nest-building,  of New England uplands and wilderness rivers, of camps and canoes, of  snowshoes and trout rods, of sunrise on the hills, when one climbed  for the eagle's nest, and twilight on the yellow wind-swept beaches,  where the surf sobbed far away, and wings twanged like reeds in the  wind swooping down to decoys,--all thronging about one, eager to be  remembered if not recorded. Among them, most eager, most intense, most  frequent of all associations, there is a boy with nerves all a-tingle  at the vast sweet mystery that rustled in every wood, following the  call of the winds and the birds, or wandering alone where the spirit  moved him, who never studied nature consciously, but only loved it,  and who found out many of these Ways long ago, guided solely by a  boy's instinct.    If they speak to other boys, as to fellow explorers in the always new  world, if they bring back to older children happy memories of a golden  age when nature and man were not quite so far apart, then there will  be another pleasure in having written them.      My thanks are due, and are given heartily, to the editors of _The  Youth's Companion_ for permission to use several sketches that have  already appeared, and to Mr. Charles Copeland, the artist, for his  care and interest in preparing the illustrations.

[Illustration]    Did you ever meet a fox face to face, surprising him quite as much as  yourself? If so, you were deeply impressed, no doubt, by his perfect  dignity and self-possession. Here is how the meeting generally comes  about.    It is a late winter afternoon. You are swinging rapidly over the  upland pastures, or loitering along the winding old road through the  woods. The color deepens in the west; the pines grow black against it;  the rich brown of the oak leaves seems to glow everywhere in the last  soft light; and the mystery that never sleeps long in the woods begins  to rustle again in the thickets. You are busy with your own thoughts,  seeing nothing, till a flash of yellow passes before your eyes, and a  fox stands in the path before you, one foot uplifted, the fluffy brush  swept aside in graceful curve, the bright eyes looking straight into  yours--nay, looking through them to read the intent which gives the  eyes their expression. That is always the way with a fox; he seems to  be looking at your thoughts.    Surprise, eagerness, a lively curiosity are all in your face on the  instant; but the beautiful creature before you only draws himself  together with quiet self-possession. He lifts his head slightly; a  superior look creeps into his eyes; he seems to be speaking. Listen--    \"You are surprised?\"--this with an almost imperceptible lift of his  eyebrows, which reminds you somehow that it is really none of your  affair. \"O, I frequently use this road in attending to some matters  over in the West Parish. To be sure, we are socially incompatible; we  may even regard each other as enemies, unfortunately. I did take your  chickens last week; but yesterday your unmannerly dogs hunted me. At  least we may meet and pass as gentlemen. You are the older; allow me  to give you the path.\"    Dropping his head again, he turns to the left, English fashion, and  trots slowly past you. There is no hurry; not the shadow of suspicion  or uneasiness. His eyes are cast down; his brow wrinkled, as if in  deep thought; already he seems to have forgotten your existence. You  watch him curiously as he reenters the path behind you and disappears  over the hill. Somehow a queer feeling, half wonder, half rebuke,  steals over you, as if you had been outdone in courtesy, or had passed  a gentleman without sufficiently recognizing him.    Ah, but you didn't watch sharply enough! You didn't see, as he circled  past, that cunning side gleam of his yellow eyes, which understood  your attitude perfectly. Had you stirred, he would have vanished like  a flash. You didn't run to the top of the hill where he disappeared,  to see that burst of speed the instant he was out of your sight. You  didn't see the capers, the tail-chasing, the high jumps, the quick  turns and plays; and then the straight, nervous gallop, which told  more plainly than words his exultation that he had outwitted you and  shown his superiority.    Reynard, wherever you meet him, whether on the old road at twilight,  or on the runway before the hounds, impresses you as an animal of  dignity and calculation. He never seems surprised, much less  frightened; never loses his head; never does things hurriedly, or on  the spur of the moment, as a scatter-brained rabbit or meddling  squirrel might do. You meet him, perhaps as he leaves the warm rock on  the south slope of the old oak woods, where he has been curled up  asleep all the sunny afternoon. (It is easy to find him there in  winter.) Now he is off on his nightly hunt; he is trotting along,  head down, brows deep-wrinkled, planning it all out.    \"Let me see,\" he is thinking, \"last night I hunted the Draper woods.  To-night I'll cross the brook just this side the old bars, and take a  look into that pasture-corner among the junipers. There's a rabbit  which plays round there on moonlight nights; I'll have him presently.  Then I'll go down to the big South meadow after mice. I haven't been  there for a week; and last time I got six. If I don't find mice,  there's that chicken coop of old Jenkins. Only\"--He stops, with his  foot up, and listens a minute--\"only he locks the coop and leaves the  dog loose ever since I took the big rooster. Anyway I'll take a look  round there. Sometimes Deacon Jones's hens get to roosting in the next  orchard. If I can find them up an apple tree, I'll bring a couple down  with a good trick I know. On the way--Hi, there!\"    In the midst of his planning he gives a grasshopper-jump aside, and  brings down both paws hard on a bit of green moss that quivered as he  passed. He spreads his paws apart carefully; thrusts his nose down  between them; drags a young wood-mouse from under the moss; eats him;  licks his chops twice, and goes on planning as if nothing had  happened.    \"On the way back, I'll swing round by the Fales place, and take a  sniff under the wall by the old hickory, to see if those sleepy skunks  are still there for the winter. I'll have that whole family before  spring, if I'm hungry and can't find anything else. They come out on  sunny days; all you have to do is just hide behind the hickory and  watch.\"    So off he goes on his well-planned hunt; and if you follow his track  to-morrow in the snow, you will see how he has gone from one hunting  ground "]]]
