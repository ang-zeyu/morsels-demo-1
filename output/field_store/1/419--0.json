Or, like most  of us, do you sometimes find it difficult to stick to the job until it  is done? What is your usual experience in this respect?    Is it not this, that you work steadily along until of a sudden you  become conscious of a feeling of weariness, crying \"Enough!\" for the  time being, and that you then yield to the impulse to stop?    [Sidenote: _The Lagging Brain_]    Assuming that this is what generally happens, does this feeling of  fatigue, this impulse to rest, mean that your mental energy is  exhausted?    Suppose that by a determined effort of the will you force your lagging  brain to take up the thread of work. _There will invariably come a new  supply of energy, a \"second wind,\" enabling you to forge ahead with a  freshness and vigor that is surprising after the previous lassitude._    Nor is this all. The same process may be repeated a second time and a  third time, each new effort of the will being followed by a renewal of  energy.    [Sidenote: _Reserve Supplies of Power_]    Many a man will tell you that he does his best work in the wee watches  of the morning, after tedious hours of persevering but fruitless  effort. Instead of being exhausted by its long hours of persistent  endeavor, the mind seems now to rise to the acme of its power, to  achieve its supreme accomplishments. Difficulties melt into thin air,  profound problems find easy solution. Flights of genius manifest  themselves. Yet long before midnight such a one had perhaps felt  himself yield to fatigue and had tied a wet towel around his head or  had taken stimulants to keep himself awake.    The existence of this reserve supply of energy is manifested in  physical as well as mental effort.    Men who work with their heads and men who work with their hands,  scholars and Marathon runners, must alike testify to the existence of  _reserve supplies of power not ordinarily drawn upon_.    [Sidenote: _\"Blue\" Mondays_]    If we do not always or habitually utilize this reserve power, it is  simply because we have accustomed ourselves to yield at once to the  first strong feeling of fatigue.    Evidence of this same fact appears in our feelings on different days.  How often does a man get up from his breakfast-table after a long  night's rest, when he should be feeling fresh and invigorated, and say  to himself, \"I don't feel like working today.\" And it may take him  until afternoon to get into his workaday stride, if, indeed, he  reaches it at all.    [Sidenote: _How to Strike One's Stride_]    You cannot yourself be immune from the feeling on certain days that  you are not at your best. Somehow or other, your wits seem befogged.  You hesitate to undertake important interviews. Your interest lags.  And though crises arise in your business, you feel weighted down and  unable to meet them with that shrewd discernment and decisiveness of  action of which you know yourself capable.    But you realize, in your inmost self, that _if you continue to exert  the will and persistently hold yourself to the business in hand,  sooner or later you will warm to the work, enthusiasm will come, the  clouds will be dispelled, the husks will fly. Yet you have had no  rest; on the contrary, you have, by continued conscious effort,  consumed more and more of your vital energy_.    [Sidenote: _The Spur of Desire_]    Obviously it was not rest that you needed.    What you required was the impulse of some _strong desire_ that should  carry you over the threshold of that first inertia into the wide field  of reserve energy so rarely called upon and so rich in power.    Under the lashings of necessity, or the spur of love or ambition, men  accomplish feats of mental and physical endurance of which they would  have supposed themselves incapable. Here is what a certain lawyer says  of his early struggles:    [Sidenote: _How to Release Stored-Up Energies_]    \"When I was twenty-three years old, married, and with a family to  support, I entered the law course of a great university. Of the many  students in my class, seven, including me, were making a living while  studying law.    \"By special arrangement, I was relieved from attendance at lectures  and simply required to pass examinations on the various subjects, and  was thus enabled to retain my place as principal of a large public  school. During the third and last year of my law course, I was  principal of a public day school of two thousand children and an  alternate night school with an enrolment of seven hundred and fifty,  and I worked at the law three nights in the week and all day Sunday.    [Sidenote: _The Lawyer Who \"Overworks\"_]    \"After eight months of this, the final examinations came around. They  consumed a full week--from nine in the morning until five or six at  night. I had no opportunity for review, so I rented a room near the  law school to save the time going and coming and reviewed each night  the subjects of examination for the following day.    \"I did not sleep more than two hours any night in that week. On  Thursday, while bolting a bit of luncheon, a fishbone stuck in my  throat. Fearful of losing the result of my year's effort, I returned  to my work, suffering much pain, and kept at it until Saturday night,  when the examinations were concluded. The next day the surgeon who  removed the fishbone said there was no reason why I should not have  had 'a bad case of gangrene.'    \"When I look back on that year's work I don't see how I stood it. I  don't see how I kept myself at it, day in, day out, month after month  without rest, recreation or relief. I am sure I could never go through  it again, even if I had the courage to undertake it.    \"I ranked second in a class of one hundred and eighty in my law  examinations, won the second prize for the best graduating thesis,  received a complimentary vote for class oratorship, and much to my  surprise was soon after offered an assistant superintendency of the  public schools by the school board, who knew nothing of my studies and  thought my work as a teacher worthy of promotion.    \"It was not only the hardest year's work but the best year's work I  ever did. _It exemplifies my invariable experience that the more we  want to do the more we can do and the better we can do it._\"    [Sidenote: _Excitement and the Hero_]    The following is an extract from a letter quoted by Professor James as  written by Colonel Baird-Smith after the siege of Delhi in 1857, to "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17354"],[0,"Cave Regions of the Ozarks and Black Hills (#1)"],[1,"Note: Project Gutenberg also has an HTML version of this        file which includes the original illustrations.

CHAPTER I.    A GENERAL VIEW.        \"O'er mountains bright with snow and light,      We crystal hunters speed along,      While grots, and caves, and icy waves,      Each instant echo to our song;      And when we meet with stores of gems      We grudge not kings their diadems.\"                          --_Thomas Moore._      The southern half of the State of Missouri, and the Black Hills of South  Dakota, offer exceptionally delightful regions for the study of caves,  or Speleology as it has been named, and the sister sciences of geology  and geography at the same time. In fact it is impossible to study either  without giving attention to the other two, and therefore, instead of  being separate sciences, they are the three branches of a great  scientific trinity.    The regions here referred to enjoy the advantage, and at the same time  suffer the disadvantage, of being comparatively little known to the ever  restless tide of tourists who naturally hail with pleasure the  announcement that some easily accessible, and thoroughly charming spot,  has escaped their attention altogether, with a marvelous store of  attractions which are both extremely old and wholly new.    Each of these regions has a peculiar geological history not repeated in  any other portions of the earth's surface: each is blessed with its own  peculiar style of beautiful scenery: and each vies with the other and  all the world besides for the supremacy of its truly wonderful caves.  Yet it should be well understood that the claims are not based on an  unworthy spirit of rivalry, nor any desire to deny the greatness and  beauty of already famous members of the Cave family. It is simply an  announcement that the family is much larger than has been generally  supposed, and the more recently presented members worthy of the full  measure of distinguished honors.    The geological authorities of both states have for many years mentioned  the beauty and importance of these regions, and urged their claims to  public attention, but have been prevented, by the pressure of other  duties, from giving to the caves such careful study and full reports as  they deserve, as it would have been a pleasure to give, and as has been  possible in states of less extent where the general work of the  department is more advanced, and the volume of tourist travel created an  early demand for scientific explanation.    Without any great difficulty we can understand the process of cave  excavation by the action of percolating acidulated water on the  limestone, and its subsequent removal as the volume of surface drainage  diverted to the new channel gradually increased. But it is not so easy  to offer a reason for the varied forms with which the caves are  afterwards decorated. Why is it the charmed waters do not leave the  evidence of their slow passage only in plain surfaces of varying widths,  and the stalactites and stalagmites whose formation we can readily  account for? And why do not the deposits take the same forms in all  caves with only such variations as would naturally result from  differences in topography? The law is written, but in unfamiliar  characters that render our reading slow and uncertain. Yet it is  conspicuously noticeable that those caves showing the most delicately  fragile and wonderfully varied forms of decoration are those traversed  by the most sweeping and changeable, or even reversible, currents of  air; which might lead to the conclusion that the moisture is sprayed or  converted into a light, misty vapor, and then deposited in exactly the  same manner as the beautiful frost-work at Niagara: the direction and  force of the current determining the location of the frail deposits.    Since the largest and most important caves occur in limestone, a little  special attention to the cause of their occurrence there may serve to  show that although speleology has only recently received its name and  been elevated to the rank of a separate and independent science, it is  one of the earth's ancient institutions.    Our geologists, who have unearthed many secrets not dreamed of even in  Humboldt's \"good phylosopy,\" have settled the question of how the  different kinds of caves were formed, according to the character of  rocks they are in, or their location and depth, and the natural agencies  to whose action they show signs of having been subjected.    Dr. H.C. Hovey, in his \"Celebrated American Caverns,\" says: \"In visiting  caves of large extent, one is at first inclined to regard the long  halls, huge rifts, deep pits and lofty domes, as evidences of great  convulsions of nature, whereby the earth has been violently rent  asunder. But, while mechanical forces have had their share in the work,  as has been shown, the main agent in every case has been the  comparatively gentle, invisible gas known as carbonic acid. This is  generated by the decay of animal and vegetable substances, and is to a  considerable degree soluble in water. Under ordinary circumstances one  measure of water will absorb one measure of carbonic acid; and the eye  will detect no difference in its appearance. Under pressure the power of  absorption is rapidly increased, until the water thus surcharged has an  acid taste, and effervesces on flowing from the earth, as in Saratoga  water.    \"Rain-water, falling amid leaves and grass, and sinking into the soil,  absorbs large quantities of carbonic acid. On reaching the underlying  limestone, the latter is instantly attacked by the acidulated water in  which it is dissolved and carried away.    \"It is agreed among geologists, amazing as the statement may seem, that  the immense caverns of Virginia, Kentucky and Indiana, including Mammoth  Cave itself (the largest of all), were eaten out of the solid mass of  limestone by the slow, patient, but irresistible action of acidulated  water.\"    Professor N.S. Shaler says: \"The existence of deep caverns is a sign  that the region has long been above the sea.\"    Through the kindness of Professor C.J. Norwood, Chief Inspector and  Curator of the Geological Department of Kentucky, it is possible to  quote the first official report made on the caves of that state and  published in 1856, in Volume I., Kentucky Geological Survey Reports.  Dr. Norwood says: \"Referring to the 'Subcarboniferous Limestone' (now  known as the St. Louis group of the Mississippian series), Dr. Owen  says: 'The southern belt of this formation is wonderfully cavernous,  especially in its upper beds, which being more argillaceous, and  impregnated with earths and alkalies, are disposed to produce salts,  which oozing through the pores of the stone effloresce on its surface,  and thus tend to disintegrate and scale off, independent of the solvent  effects of the carbonated water. Beneath overhanging ledges of  limestone, quantities of fine earthy rubbish can be seen, weathered off  from such causes. In these I have detected sulphate of lime, sulphate of  magnesia, nitrate of lime, and occasionally sulphate of soda. The  tendency which some calcareous rocks have to produce nitrate of lime is,  probably, one of the greatest causes of disintegration.'\"    \"Most extensive subterranean areas thus have been excavated or  undermined in Edmonson, Hart, Grayson, Butler, Logan, Todd, Christian  and Trig. In the vicinity of Green River, in the first of these  counties, the known avenues of the Mammoth Cave amount to two hundred  and twenty-three, the united length of the whole being estimated, by  those best acquainted with the Cave, at one hundred and fifty miles; say  that the average width and height of these passages amount to seven  yards each way, which is perhaps near the truth; this would give upwards  of twelve million cubic yards of cavernous space which has been  excavated through the agency of calcareous waters and atmospheric  vicissitudes."]]]
