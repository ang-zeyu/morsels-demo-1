For only to the few whose inner senses have been quickened, perchance  by some strange suffering in the depths, or by a natural temperament  bequeathed from a remote past, comes the knowledge, not too welcome,  that this greater world lies ever at their elbow, and that any moment a  chance combination of moods and forces may invite them to cross the  shifting frontier.    Some, however, are born with this awful certainty in their hearts, and  are called to no apprenticeship, and to this select company Jones  undoubtedly belonged.    All his life he had realised that his senses brought to him merely a  more or less interesting set of sham appearances; that space, as men  measure it, was utterly misleading; that time, as the clock ticked it  in a succession of minutes, was arbitrary nonsense; and, in fact, that  all his sensory perceptions were but a clumsy representation of _real_  things behind the curtain--things he was for ever trying to get at, and  that sometimes he actually did get at.    He had always been tremblingly aware that he stood on the borderland  of another region, a region where time and space were merely forms of  thought, where ancient memories lay open to the sight, and where the  forces behind each human life stood plainly revealed and he could see  the hidden springs at the very heart of the world. Moreover, the fact  that he was a clerk in a fire insurance office, and did his work with  strict attention, never allowed him to forget for one moment that, just  beyond the dingy brick walls where the hundred men scribbled with  pointed pens beneath the electric lamps, there existed this glorious  region where the important part of himself dwelt and moved and had its  being. For in this region he pictured himself playing the part of a  spectator to his ordinary workaday life, watching, like a king, the  stream of events, but untouched in his own soul by the dirt, the noise,  and the vulgar commotion of the outer world.    And this was no poetic dream merely. Jones was not playing prettily with  idealism to amuse himself. It was a living, working belief. So convinced  was he that the external world was the result of a vast deception  practised upon him by the gross senses, that when he stared at a great  building like St. Paul's he felt it would not very much surprise him to  see it suddenly quiver like a shape of jelly and then melt utterly away,  while in its place stood all at once revealed the mass of colour, or the  great intricate vibrations, or the splendid sound--the spiritual  idea--which it represented in stone.    For something in this way it was that his mind worked.    Yet, to all appearances, and in the satisfaction of all business claims,  Jones was normal and unenterprising. He felt nothing but contempt for  the wave of modern psychism. He hardly knew the meaning of such words as  \"clairvoyance\" and \"clairaudience.\" He had never felt the least desire  to join the Theosophical Society and to speculate in theories of  astral-plane life, or elementals. He attended no meetings of the  Psychical Research Society, and knew no anxiety as to whether his \"aura\"  was black or blue; nor was he conscious of the slightest wish to mix in  with the revival of cheap occultism which proves so attractive to weak  minds of mystical tendencies and unleashed imaginations.    There were certain things he _knew_, but none he cared to argue about;  and he shrank instinctively from attempting to put names to the contents  of this other region, knowing well that such names could only limit and  define things that, according to any standards in use in the ordinary  world, were simply undefinable and illusive.    So that, although this was the way his mind worked, there was clearly a  very strong leaven of common sense in Jones. In a word, the man the  world and the office knew as Jones _was_ Jones. The name summed him up  and labelled him correctly--John Enderby Jones.    Among the things that he _knew_, and therefore never cared to speak or  speculate about, one was that he plainly saw himself as the inheritor  of a long series of past lives, the net result of painful evolution,  always as himself, of course, but in numerous different bodies each  determined by the behaviour of the preceding one. The present John Jones  was the last result to date of all the previous thinking, feeling,  and doing of John Jones in earlier bodies and in other centuries. He  pretended to no details, nor claimed distinguished ancestry, for he  realised his past must have been utterly commonplace and insignificant  to have produced his present; but he was just as sure he had been at  this weary game for ages as that he breathed, and it never occurred to  him to argue, to doubt, or to ask questions. And one result of this  belief was that his thoughts dwelt upon the past rather than upon the  future; that he read much history, and felt specially drawn to certain  periods whose spirit he understood instinctively as though he had lived  in them; and that he found all religions uninteresting because, almost  without exception, they start from the present and speculate ahead as to  what men shall become, instead of looking back and speculating why men  have got here as they are.    In the insurance office he did his work exceedingly well, but without  much personal ambition. Men and women he regarded as the impersonal  instruments for inflicting upon him the pain or pleasure he had earned  by his past workings, for chance had no place in his scheme of things at  all; and while he recognised that the practical world could not get  along unless every man did his work thoroughly and conscientiously, he  took no interest in the accumulation of fame or money for himself, and  simply, therefore, did his plain duty, with indifference as to results.    In common with others who lead a strictly impersonal life, he possessed  the quality of utter bravery, and was always ready to face any  combination of circumstances, no matter how terrible, because he saw in  them the just working-out of past causes he had himself set in motion  which could not be dodged or modified. And whereas the majority of  people had little meaning for him, either by way of attraction or  repulsion, the moment he met some one with whom he felt his past had  been _vitally_ interwoven his whole inner being leapt up instantly and  shouted the fact in his face, and he regulated his life with the utmost  skill and caution, like a sentry on watch for an enemy whose feet could  already be heard approaching.    Thus, while the great majority of men and women left him  uninfluenced--since he regarded them as so many souls merely passing  with him along the great stream of evolution--there were, here and  there, individuals with whom he recognised that his smallest intercourse  was of the gravest importance. These were persons with whom he knew  in every fibre of his being he had accounts to settle, pleasant or  otherwise, arising out of dealings in past lives; and into his relations  with these few, therefore, he concentrated as it were the efforts that  most people spread over their intercourse with a far greater number. By  what means he picked out these few individuals only those conversant  with the startling processes of the subconscious memory may say, but the  point was that Jones believed the main purpose, if not quite the entire  purpose, of his present incarnation lay in his faithful and thorough  settling of these accounts, and that if he sought to evade the least  detail of such settling, no matter how unpleasant, he would have lived  in vain, and would return to his next incarnation with this added duty  to perform. For according to his beliefs there was no Chance, and could  be no ultimate shirking, and to avoid a problem was merely to waste time  and lose opportunities for development.    And there was one individual with whom Jones had long understood clearly  he had a very large account to settle, and towards the accomplishment  of which all the main currents of his being seemed to bear him with  unswerving purpose. For, when he first entered the insurance office as a  junior clerk ten years before, and through a glass door had caught sight  of this man seated in an inner room, one of his sudden overwhelming  flashes of intuitive memory had burst up into him from the depths, and  he had seen, as in a flame of blinding light, a symbolical picture of  the future rising out of a dreadful past, and he had, without any act of  definite volition, marked down this man for a real account to be  settled.    \"With _that_ man I shall have much to do,\" he said to himself, as he  noted the big face look up and meet his eye through the glass. \"There is  something I cannot shirk--a vital relation out of the past of both of  us.\"    And he went to his desk trembling a little, and with shaking knees, as  though the memory of some terrible pain had suddenly laid its icy hand  upon his heart and touched the scar of a great horror."]]]
