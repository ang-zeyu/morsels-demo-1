Carley  Burch laid the letter in her lap and gazed dreamily through the window.    It was a day typical of early April in New York, rather cold and gray,  with steely sunlight. Spring breathed in the air, but the women passing  along Fifty-seventh Street wore furs and wraps. She heard the distant  clatter of an L train and then the hum of a motor car. A hurdy-gurdy  jarred into the interval of quiet.    \"Glenn has been gone over a year,\" she mused, \"three months over a  year--and of all his strange letters this seems the strangest yet.\"    She lived again, for the thousandth time, the last moments she had spent  with him. It had been on New-Year's Eve, 1918. They had called upon  friends who were staying at the McAlpin, in a suite on the twenty-first  floor overlooking Broadway. And when the last quarter hour of that  eventful and tragic year began slowly to pass with the low swell of  whistles and bells, Carley's friends had discreetly left her alone with  her lover, at the open window, to watch and hear the old year out, the  new year in. Glenn Kilbourne had returned from France early that fall,  shell-shocked and gassed, and otherwise incapacitated for service in the  army--a wreck of his former sterling self and in many unaccountable ways  a stranger to her. Cold, silent, haunted by something, he had made her  miserable with his aloofness. But as the bells began to ring out  the year that had been his ruin Glenn had drawn her close, tenderly,  passionately, and yet strangely, too.    \"Carley, look and listen!\" he had whispered.    Under them stretched the great long white flare of Broadway, with its  snow-covered length glittering under a myriad of electric lights. Sixth  Avenue swerved away to the right, a less brilliant lane of blanched  snow. The L trains crept along like huge fire-eyed serpents. The hum of  the ceaseless moving line of motor cars drifted upward faintly,  almost drowned in the rising clamor of the street. Broadway's gay and  thoughtless crowds surged to and fro, from that height merely a thick  stream of black figures, like contending columns of ants on the march.  And everywhere the monstrous electric signs flared up vivid in white and  red and green; and dimmed and paled, only to flash up again.    Ring out the Old! Ring in the New! Carley had poignantly felt the  sadness of the one, the promise of the other. As one by one the siren  factory whistles opened up with deep, hoarse bellow, the clamor of the  street and the ringing of the bells were lost in a volume of continuous  sound that swelled on high into a magnificent roar. It was the voice of  a city--of a nation. It was the voice of a people crying out the strife  and the agony of the year--pealing forth a prayer for the future.    Glenn had put his lips to her ear: \"It's like the voice in my soul!\"  Never would she forget the shock of that. And how she had stood  spellbound, enveloped in the mighty volume of sound no longer  discordant, but full of great, pregnant melody, until the white ball  burst upon the tower of the Times Building, showing the bright figures  1919.    The new year had not been many minutes old when Glenn Kilbourne had told  her he was going West to try to recover his health.    Carley roused out of her memories to take up the letter that had so  perplexed her. It bore the postmark, Flagstaff, Arizona. She reread it  with slow pondering thoughtfulness.      WEST FORK,    March 25.    DEAR CARLEY:    It does seem my neglect in writing you is unpardonable. I used to be  a pretty fair correspondent, but in that as in other things I have  changed.    One reason I have not answered sooner is because your letter was so  sweet and loving that it made me feel an ungrateful and unappreciative  wretch. Another is that this life I now lead does not induce writing. I  am outdoors all day, and when I get back to this cabin at night I am too  tired for anything but bed.    Your imperious questions I must answer--and that must, of course, is  a third reason why I have delayed my reply. First, you ask, \"Don't you  love me any more as you used to?\"... Frankly, I do not. I am sure my  old love for you, before I went to France, was selfish, thoughtless,  sentimental, and boyish. I am a man now. And my love for you is  different. Let me assure you that it has been about all left to me of  what is noble and beautiful. Whatever the changes in me for the worse,  my love for you, at least, has grown better, finer, purer.    And now for your second question, \"Are you coming home as soon as you  are well again?\"... Carley, I am well. I have delayed telling you this  because I knew you would expect me to rush back East with the telling.  But--the fact is, Carley, I am not coming--just yet. I wish it were  possible for me to make you understand. For a long time I seem to have  been frozen within. You know when I came back from France I couldn't  talk. It's almost as bad as that now. Yet all that I was then seems to  have changed again. It is only fair to you to tell you that, as I  feel now, I hate the city, I hate people, and particularly I hate that  dancing, drinking, lounging set you chase with. I don't want to come  East until I am over that, you know... Suppose I never get over it?  Well, Carley, you can free yourself from me by one word that I could  never utter. I could never break our engagement. During the hell I went  through in the war my attachment to you saved me from moral ruin, if it  did not from perfect honor and fidelity. This is another thing I despair  of making you understand. And in the chaos I've wandered through since  the war my love for you was my only anchor. You never guessed, did you,  that I lived on your letters until I got well. And now the fact that I  might get along without them is no discredit to their charm or to you.    It is all so hard to put in words, Carley. To lie down with death and  get up with death was nothing. To face one's degradation was nothing.  But to come home an incomprehensibly changed man--and to see my old life  as strange as if it were the new life of another planet--to try to slip  into the old groove--well, no words of mine can tell you how utterly  impossible it was.    My old job was not open to me, even if I had been able to work. The  government that I fought for left me to starve, or to die of my maladies  like a dog, for all it cared.    I could not live on your money, Carley. My people are poor, as you know.  So there was nothing for me to do but to borrow a little money from my  friends and to come West. I'm glad I had the courage to come. What  this West is I'll never try to tell you, because, loving the luxury and  excitement and glitter of the city as you do, you'd think I was crazy.    Getting on here, in my condition, was as hard as trench life. But now,  Carley--something has come to me out of the West. That, too, I am unable  to put into words. Maybe I can give you an inkling of it. I'm strong  enough to chop wood all day. No man or woman passes my cabin in a month.  But I am never lonely. I love these vast red canyon walls towering above  me. And the silence is so sweet. Think of the hellish din that filled my  ears. Even now--sometimes, the brook here changes its babbling murmur  to the roar of war. I never understood anything of the meaning of nature  until I lived under these looming stone walls and whispering pines.    So, Carley, try to understand me, or at least be kind. You know they  came very near writing, \"Gone west!\" after my name, and considering  that, this \"Out West\" signifies for me a very fortunate difference. A  tremendous difference! For the present I'll let well enough alone.    Adios. Write soon. Love from    GLEN      Carley's second reaction to the letter was a sudden upflashing desire  to see her lover--to go out West and find him. Impulses with her were  rather rare and inhibited, but this one made her tremble. If Glenn was  well again he must have vastly changed from the moody, stone-faced,  and haunted-eyed man who had so worried and distressed her. He had  embarrassed her, too, for sometimes, in her home, meeting young men  there who had not gone into the service, he had seemed to retreat into  himself, singularly aloof, as if his world was not theirs.    Again, with eager eyes and quivering lips, she read the letter. It  contained words that lifted her heart. Her starved love greedily  absorbed them. In them she had excuse for any resolve that might bring  Glenn closer to her. And she pondered over this longing to go to him.    Carley had the means to come and go and live as she liked. She did not  remember her father, who had died when she was a child. Her mother had  left her in the care of a sister, and before the war they had divided  their time between New York and Europe, the Adirondacks and Florida,  Carley had gone in for Red Cross and relief work with more of sincerity  than most of her set. But she was really not used to making any decision  as definite and important as that of going out West alone. She had never  been farther west than Jersey City; and her conception of the West was  a hazy one of vast plains and rough mountains, squalid towns, cattle  herds, and uncouth ill-clad men.    So she carried the letter to her aunt, a rather slight woman with  a kindly face and shrewd eyes, and who appeared somewhat given to  old-fashioned garments.    \"Aunt Mary, here's a letter from Glenn,\" said Carley. \"It's more of a  stumper than usual. Please read it.\"    \"Dear me! You look upset,\" replied the aunt, mildly, and, adjusting her  spectacles, she took the letter.    Carley waited impatiently for the perusal, conscious of inward forces  coming more and more to the aid of her impulse to go West. Her aunt  paused once to murmur how glad she was that Glenn had gotten well. Then  she read on to the close.    \""]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18818"],[0,"On the Evolution of Language (#1)"],[1,"was produced from images generously made available  by the Bibliotheque nationale de France (BnF/Gallica) at  http://gallica.bnf.fr)            [Transcriber's Note:    The paragraph beginning \"In _Ute_ the name for bear is _he seizes_\"  will only display correctly in Latin-1 file encoding.

By                     J. W. POWELL.             *       *       *       *       *                ON THE EVOLUTION OF LANGUAGE             *       *       *       *       *      Possible ideas and thoughts are vast in number. A distinct word for  every distinct idea and thought would require a vast vocabulary.  The problem in language is to express many ideas and thoughts with  comparatively few words.    Again, in the evolution of any language, progress is from a condition  where few ideas are expressed by a few words to a higher, where many  ideas are expressed by the use of many words; but the number of all  possible ideas or thoughts expressed is increased greatly out of  proportion with the increase of the number of words.    And still again, in all of those languages which have been most  thoroughly studied, and by inference in all languages, it appears  that the few original words used in any language remain as the elements  for the greater number finally used. In the evolution of a language  the introduction of absolutely new material is a comparatively rare  phenomenon. The old material is combined and modified in many ways to  form the new.    How has the small stock of words found as the basis of a language been  thus combined and modified?    The way in which the old materials have been used gives rise to what  will here be denominated THE GRAMMATIC PROCESSES.      I.--THE PROCESS BY COMBINATION.    Two or more words may be united to form a new one, or to perform the  office of a new one, and four methods or stages of combination may be  noted.    _a._ By _juxtaposition_, where the two words are placed together and yet  remain as distinct words. This method is illustrated in Chinese, where  the words in the combination when taken alone seldom give a clew to  their meaning when placed together.    _b._ By _compounding_, where two words are made into one, in which case  the original elements of the new word remain in an unmodified condition,  as in _house-top_, _rain-bow_, _tell-tale_.    _c._ By _agglutination_, in which case one or more of the elements  entering into combination to form the new word is somewhat changed--the  elements are fused together. Yet this modification is not so great as  to essentially obscure the primitive words, as in _truthful_, where we  easily recognize the original words _truth_ and _full_; and _holiday_,  in which _holy_ and _day_ are recognized.    _d._ By _inflection_. Here one or more of the elements entering into the  compound has been so changed that it can scarcely be recognized. There  is a constant tendency to economy in speech by which words are gradually  shortened as they are spoken by generation after generation. In those  words which are combinations of others there are certain elements that  wear out more rapidly than others. Where some particular word is  combined with many other different words the tendency to modify by wear  this oft-used element is great. This is more especially the case where  the combined word is used in certain categories of combinations, as  where particular words are used to denote tense in the verb; thus, _did_  may be used in combination with a verb to denote past time until it is  worn down to the sound of _d_. The same wear occurs where particular  words are used to form cases in nouns, and a variety of illustrations  might be given. These categories constitute conjugations and  declensions, and for convenience such combinations may be called  paradigmatic. Then the oft-repeated elements of paradigmatic  combinations are apt to become excessively worn and modified, so that  the primitive words or themes to which they are attached seem to be but  slightly changed by the addition. Under these circumstances combination  is called inflection.    As a morphologic process, no well-defined plane of demarkation between  these four methods of combination can be drawn, as one runs into  another; but, in general, words may be said to be juxtaposed when two  words being placed together the combination performs the function of a  new word, while in form the two words remain separate.    Words may be said to be compound when two or more words are combined  to form one, no change being made in either. Words maybe said to be  agglutinated when the elementary words are changed but slightly, _i.e._,  only to the extent that their original forms are not greatly obscured;  and words may be said to be inflected when in the combination the  oft-repeated element or formative part has been so changed that  its origin is obscured. These inflections are used chiefly in the  paradigmatic combinations.    In the preceding statement it has been assumed that there can be  recognized, in these combinations of inflection, a theme or root, as it  is sometimes called, and a formative element. The formative element is  used with a great many different words to define or qualify them; that  is, to indicate mode, tense, number, person, gender, etc., of verbs,  nouns, and other parts of speech.    When in a language juxtaposition is the chief method of combination,  there may also be distinguished two kinds of elements, in some sense  corresponding to themes and formative parts. The theme is a word the  meaning of which is determined by the formative word placed by it; that  is, the theme is a word having many radically different meanings; with  which meaning it is to be understood is determined only by the formative  word, which thus serves as its label. The ways in which the theme words  are thus labeled by the formative word are very curious, but the subject  cannot be entered into here.    When words are combined by compounding, the formative elements cannot  so readily be distinguished from the theme; nor for the purposes under  immediate consideration can compounding be well separated from  agglutination.    When words are combined by agglutination, theme and formative part  usually appear. The formative parts are affixes; and affixes may be  divided into three classes, prefixes, suffixes, and infixes. These  affixes are often called incorporated particles.    In those Indian languages where combination is chiefly by agglutination,  that is, by the use of affixes, _i.e._, incorporated particles, certain  parts of the conjugation of the verb, especially those which denote  gender, number, and person, are effected by the use of article pronouns;  but in those languages where article pronouns are not found the verbs  are inflected to accomplish the same part of their conjugation. Perhaps,  when we come more fully to study the formative elements in these more  highly inflected languages, we may discover in such elements greatly  modified, _i.e._, worn out, incorporated pronouns.      II.--THE PROCESS BY VOCALIC MUTATION.    Here, in order to form a new word, one or more of the vowels of the old  word are changed, as in _man--men_, where an _e_ is substituted for _a_;  _ran--run_, where _u_ is substituted for _a_; _lead--led_, where _e_,  with its proper sound, is substituted for _ea_ with its proper sound.  This method is used to a very limited extent in English. When the  history of the words in which it occurs is studied it is discovered  to be but an instance of the wearing out of the different elements of  combined words; but in the Hebrew this method prevails to a very large  extent, and scholars have not yet been able to discover its origin in  combination as they have in English. It may or may not have been an  original grammatic process, but because of its importance in certain  languages it has been found necessary to deal with it as a distinct and  original process.      III.--THE PROCESS BY INTONATION.    In English, new words are not formed by this method, yet words are  intoned for certain purposes, chiefly rhetorical. We use the rising  intonation (or inflection, as it is usually called) to indicate that  a question is asked, and various effects are given to speech by the  various intonations of rhetoric. But this process is used in other  languages to form new words with which to express new ideas. In Chinese  eight distinct intonations are found, by the use of which one word may  be made to express eight different ideas, or perhaps it is better to say  that eight words may be made of one.      IV.--THE PROCESS BY PLACEMENT.    The place or position of a word may affect its significant use. Thus in  English we say _John struck James_. By the position of those words to  each other we know that John is the actor, and that James receives the  action.    By the grammatic processes language is organized. Organization  postulates the differentiation of organs and their combination into  integers. The integers of language are sentences, and their organs are  the parts of speech. Linguistic organization, then, consists in the  differentiation of the parts of speech and the integration of the  sentence. For example, let us take the words _John_, _father_, and  _love_. _John_ is the name of an individual; _love_ is the name of a  mental action, and _father_ the name of a person. We put them together,  John loves father, and they express a thought;"]]]
