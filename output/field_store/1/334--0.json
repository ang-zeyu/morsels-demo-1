Seldom has a people made such  rapid strides forward as the Russian Jews. From the melancholy  regularity that marked their existence a little more than two  generations ago, from the darkness of the Middle Ages in which they were  steeped until the time of Alexander II, they emerged suddenly into the  life and light of the West, and some of the most intrepid devotees of  latter-day culture, both in Europe and in America, have come from among  them. Destitute of everything that makes for enlightenment, and under  the dominion of a Government which sought to extinguish the few  rushlights that scattered the shadows around them, they nevertheless  snatched victory from defeat, sloughed off medieval superstition, and,  disregarding the Dejanira shirt of modern disabilities, compelled their  countrymen to admit more than once that      Tho' I've belted you and flayed you,    By the livin' Gawd that made you,    You're a better man than I am!    Similar movements were started in Germany during the latter part of the  eighteenth century, and in Austria, notably Galicia, at the beginning of  the nineteenth, but none stirred the mind of the Jews to the same degree  as the Haskalah movement in Russia during the last fifty years. In the  former, the removal of restrictions soon rendered attempts toward  self-emancipation unnecessary on the part of Jews, and the few Maskilim  among them, satisfied with the present, devoted themselves to  investigating and elucidating the past of their people's history. In  Russia the past was all but forgotten on account of the immediate duties  of the present. The energy and acquisitiveness that made the Jews of  happier and more prosperous lands prominent in every sphere of practical  life, were directed toward the realm of thought, and the merciless  severity with which the Government excluded them from the enjoyment of  things material only increased their ardor for things spiritual and  intellectual.    In its wide sense Haskalah denotes enlightenment. Those who strove to  enlighten their benighted coreligionists or disseminate European culture  among them, were called Maskilim. A careful perusal of this work will  reveal the exact ideals these terms embody. For Haskalah was not only  progressive, it was also aggressive, militant, sometimes destructive.  From the days of Mordecai Guenzburg to the time of Asher Ginzberg (Ahad  Ha-'Am), it changed its tendencies and motives more than once.  Levinsohn, \"the father of the Maskilim,\" was satisfied with removing the  ban from secular learning; Gordon wished to see his brethren \"Jews at  home and men abroad\"; Smolenskin dreamed of the rehabilitation of Jews  in Palestine; and Ahad Ha-'Am hopes for the spiritual regeneration of  his beloved people. Others advocated the levelling of all distinctions  between Jews and Gentiles, or the upliftment of mankind in general and  Russia in particular. To each of them Haskalah implied different ideals,  and through each it promulgated diverse doctrines. To trace these  varying phases from an indistinct glimmering in the eighteenth century  to the glorious effulgence of the beginning of the twentieth, is the  main object of this book.    In pursuance of my end, I have paid particular attention to the causes  that retarded or accelerated Russo-Jewish cultural advance. As these  causes originate in the social, economic, and political status of the  Russian Jew, I frequently portray political events as well as the state  of knowledge, belief, art, and morals of the periods under  consideration. For this reason also I have marked the boundaries of the  Haskalah epochs in correspondence to the dates of the reigns of the  several czars, though the correspondence is not always exact.    Essays have been published, on some of the topics treated in these  pages, by writers in different languages: in Russian, by Bramson,  Klausner, and Morgulis; in Hebrew, by Izgur, Katz, and Klausner; in  German, by Maimon, Lilienthal, Wengeroff, and Weissberg; in English, by  Lilienthal and Wiener; and in French, by Slouschz. The subject as a  whole, however, has not been treated. Should this work stimulate further  research, I shall feel amply rewarded. Without prejudice and without  partiality, by an honest presentation of facts drawn from what I regard  as reliable sources, I have tried to unfold the story of the struggle of  five millions of human beings for right living and rational thinking, in  the hope of throwing light on the ideals and aspirations and the real  character of the largely prejudged and misunderstood Russian Jew.    In conclusion, I wish to express my gratitude and indebtedness to those  who encouraged me to proceed with my work after some specimens of it had  been published in several Jewish periodicals, especially to Doctor  Solomon Schechter, Rabbi Max Heller, and Mr. A.S. Freidus, for their  courtesy and assistance while the work was being written.    JACOB S. RAISIN.    E. Las Vegas, N. Mex.,    Thanksgiving Day, 1909.          CHAPTER I    THE PRE-HASKALAH PERIOD    ?-1648      \"There is but one key to the present,\" says Max Mueller, \"and that is the  past.\" To understand fully the growth and historical development of a  people's mind, one must be familiar with the conditions that have shaped  its present form. It would seem necessary, therefore, to introduce a  description of the Haskalah movement with a rapid survey of the history  of the Russo-Polish Jews from the time of their emergence from obscurity  up to the middle of the seventeenth century.    Among those who laid the foundations for the study of this almost  unexplored department of Jewish history, the settlement of Jews in  Russia and their vicissitudes during the dark ages, the most prominent  are perhaps Isaac Baer Levinsohn, Abraham Harkavy, and Simon Dubnow.  There is much to be said of each of these as writers, scholars, and men.  Here they concern us as Russo-Jewish historians. What Linnaeus, Agassiz,  and Cuvier did in the field of natural philosophy, they accomplished in  their chosen province of Jewish history.[1] Levinsohn was the first to  express the opinion that the Russian Jews hailed, not from Germany, as  is commonly supposed, but from the banks of the Volga. This hypothesis,  corroborated by tradition, Harkavy established as a fact. Originally the  vernacular of the Jews of Volhynia, Podolia, and Kiev was Russian and  Polish, or, rather, the two being closely allied, Palaeo-Slavonic. The  havoc wrought by the Crusades in the Jewish communities of Western  Europe caused a constant stream of German-Jewish immigrants to pour,  since 1090, into the comparatively free countries of the Slavonians.  Russo-Poland became the America of the Old World. The Jewish settlers  from abroad soon outnumbered the native Jews, and they spread a new  language and new customs wherever they established themselves.[2]    Whether the Jews of Russia were originally pagans from the shores of the  Black and Caspian Seas, converted to Judaism under the Khazars during  the eighth century, or Palestinian exiles subjugated by their Slavonian  conquerors and assimilated with them, it is indisputable that they  inhabited what we know to-day as Russia long before the Varangian prince  Rurik came, at the invitation of Scythian and Sarmatian savages, to lay  the foundation of the Muscovite empire.

Its object is to present a short  series of specimens of Egyptian compositions, which represent all the  great periods of literary activity in Egypt under the Pharaohs, to all  who are interested in the study of the mental development of ancient  nations. It is not addressed to the Egyptological specialist, to whom,  as a matter of course, its contents are well known, and therefore its  pages are not loaded with elaborate notes and copious references. It  represents, I believe, the first attempt made to place before the public  a summary of the principal contents of Egyptian Literature in a handy  and popular form.    The specimens of native Egyptian Literature printed herein are taken  from tombs, papyri, stelae, and other monuments, and, with few  exceptions, each specimen is complete in itself. Translations of most of  the texts have appeared in learned works written by Egyptologists in  English, French, German, and Italian, but some appear in English for the  first time. In every case I have collated my own translations with the  texts, and, thanks to the accurate editions of texts which have appeared  in recent years, it has been found possible to make many hitherto  difficult passages clear. The translations are as literal as the  difference between the Egyptian and English idioms will permit, but it  has been necessary to insert particles and often to invert the order of  the words in the original works in order to produce a connected meaning  in English. The result of this has been in many cases to break up the  short abrupt sentences in which the Egyptian author delighted, and  which he used frequently with dramatic effect. Extraordinarily concise  phrases have been paraphrased, but the meanings given to several unknown  words often represent guess-work.    In selecting the texts for translation in this book an attempt has been  made to include compositions that are not only the best of their kind,  but that also illustrate the most important branches of Egyptian  Literature. Among these religious, mythological, and moral works bulk  largely, and in many respects these represent the peculiar bias of the  mind of the ancient Egyptian better than compositions of a purely  historical character. No man was more alive to his own material  interests, but no man has ever valued the things of this world less in  comparison with the salvation of his soul and the preservation of his  physical body. The immediate result of this was a perpetual demand on  his part for information concerning the Other World, and for guidance  during his life in this world. The priests attempted to satisfy his  craving for information by composing the Books of the Dead and the other  funerary works with which we are acquainted, and the popularity of these  works seems to show that they succeeded. From the earliest times the  Egyptians regarded a life of moral excellence upon earth as a necessary  introduction to the life which he hoped to live with the blessed in  heaven. And even in pyramid times he conceived the idea of the existence  of a God Who judged rightly, and Who set \"right in the place of wrong.\"  This fact accounts for the reverence in which he held the Precepts of  Ptah-hetep, Kaqemna, Herutataf, Amenemhat I, Ani, Tuauf, Amen-hetep, and  other sages. To him, as to all Africans, the Other World was a very real  thing, and death and the Last Judgment were common subjects of his daily  thoughts. The great antiquity of this characteristic of the Egyptian is  proved by a passage in a Book of Precepts, which was written by a king  of the ninth or tenth dynasty for his son, who reigned under the name of  Merikara. The royal writer in it reminds his son that the Chiefs [of  Osiris] who judge sinners perform their duty with merciless justice on  the Day of Judgment. It is useless to assume that length of years will  be accepted by them as a plea of justification. With them the lifetime  of a man is only regarded as a moment. After death these Chiefs must be  faced, and the only things that they will consider will be his works.  Life in the Other World is for ever, and only the reckless fool forgets  this fact. The man who has led a life free from lies and deceit shall  live after death like a god.    The reader who wishes to continue his studies of Egyptian Literature  will find abundant material in the list of works given on pp. 256-8.                                                    E.A.
