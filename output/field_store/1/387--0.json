That all nations should become one in faith and all men as  brothers; that the bonds of affection and unity between the sons of men  should be strengthened; that diversity of religion should cease, and  differences of race be annulled--what harm is there in this?... Yet so it  shall be; these fruitless strifes, these ruinous wars shall pass away, and  the 'Most Great Peace' shall come.... Yet do We see your kings and rulers  lavishing their treasures more freely on means for the destruction of the  human race than on that which would conduce to the happiness of  mankind.... These strifes and this bloodshed and discord must cease, and  all men be as one kindred and one family.... Let not a man glory in this,  that he loves his country; let him rather glory in this, that he loves his  kind...._    One hundred years ago, Baha'u'llah, Founder of the Baha'i Faith,  proclaimed in clear and unmistakable language, to the kings and rulers of  the world, to its religious leaders, and to mankind in general that the  long-promised age of world peace and brotherhood had at last dawned and  that He Himself was the Bearer of the new message and power from God which  would transform the prevailing system of antagonism and enmity between men  and create the spirit and form of the destined world order.    At that time the splendour and panoply of the monarchs reflected the vast  power which they exercised, autocratically for the most part, over the  greater portion of the earth. Baha'u'llah, an exile from His native Persia  for His religious teaching, was the prisoner of the tyrannical,  all-powerful Sultan of the Ottoman Empire. In such circumstances He  addressed the rulers of the world. His Tablets to particular kings and to  the Pope, although delivered, were either ignored or rejected, their wise  counsels and dire warnings went unheeded, and in one instance the bearer  was cruelly tortured and killed.    Baha'u'llah, viewing that old world and seeing it 'at the mercy of rulers  so drunk with pride that they cannot discern clearly their own best  advantage' declared that '...the strife that divides and afflicts the  human race is daily increasing. The signs of impending convulsions and  chaos can now be discerned, inasmuch as the prevailing order appears to be  lamentably defective.' Although painting in sombre tones the 'divine  chastisement' which would assail most of those rulers and engulf in ruin  the peoples of the world, He nevertheless left no doubt about the outcome.  'Soon', He declared, 'will the present day order be rolled up and a new  one spread out in its stead.' Since the ascension of Baha'u'llah in 1892,  in the Holy Land, the rolling up of the old order has become the daily  experience of mankind and no abatement of this process is discernible. The  essence of Baha'u'llah's World Order is the unity of the human race. 'O ye  children of men', He writes, 'the fundamental purpose animating the Faith  of God and His Religion is to safeguard the interests and promote the  unity of the human race...' And He warns, 'The well-being of mankind, its  peace and security, are unattainable unless and until its unity is firmly  established.' The achievement of this unity is Baha'u'llah's declared  mission and the aim of all Baha'i activity. Its outline and structure are  indicated in the following passage from the writings of Shoghi Effendi,  great-grandson of Baha'u'llah and Guardian of the Baha'i Faith:          The unity of the human race, as envisaged by Baha'u'llah, implies      the establishment of a world commonwealth in which all nations,      races, creeds and classes are closely and permanently united, and      in which the autonomy of its state members and personal freedom      and initiative of the individuals that compose them are definitely      and completely safeguarded. This commonwealth must, as far as we      can visualize it, consist of a world legislature, whose members      will, as the trustees of the whole of mankind, ultimately control      the entire resources of all the component nations, and will enact      such laws as shall be required to regulate the life, satisfy the      needs and adjust the relationships of all races and peoples. A      world executive, backed by an international Force, will carry out      the decisions arrived at, and apply the laws enacted by, this      world legislature, and will safeguard the organic unity of the      whole commonwealth. A world tribunal will adjudicate and deliver      its compulsory and final verdict in all and any disputes that may      arise between the various elements constituting this universal      system. A mechanism of world inter-communication will be devised,      embracing the whole planet, freed from national hinderances and      restrictions, and functioning with marvellous swiftness and      perfect regularity.

CONTENTS      Baha'i Terms of Use  The Seven Valleys of Baha'u'llah     The Valley of Search     The Valley of Love     The Valley of Knowledge     The Valley of Unity     The Valley of Contentment     The Valley of Wonderment     The Valley of True Poverty and Absolute Nothingness  The Four Valleys     The Four Valleys     The First Valley     The Second Valley     The Third Valley     The Fourth Valley              THE SEVEN VALLEYS OF BAHA'U'LLAH      _In the Name of God, the Clement, the Merciful._    Praise be to God Who hath made being to come forth from nothingness;  graven upon the tablet of man the secrets of preexistence; taught him from  the mysteries of divine utterance that which he knew not; made him a  Luminous Book unto those who believed and surrendered themselves; caused  him to witness the creation of all things (Kullu Shay') in this black and  ruinous age, and to speak forth from the apex of eternity with a wondrous  voice in the Excellent Temple(1): to the end that every man may testify,  in himself, by himself, in the station of the Manifestation of his Lord,  that verily there is no God save Him, and that every man may thereby win  his way to the summit of realities, until none shall contemplate anything  whatsoever but that he shall see God therein.    And I praise and glorify the first sea which hath branched from the ocean  of the Divine Essence, and the first morn which hath glowed from the  Horizon of Oneness, and the first sun which hath risen in the Heaven of  Eternity, and the first fire which was lit from the Lamp of Preexistence  in the lantern of singleness: He who was Ahmad in the kingdom of the  exalted ones, and Muhammad amongst the concourse of the near ones, and  Mahmud(2) in the realm of the sincere ones. \"...by whichsoever (name) ye  will, invoke Him: He hath most excellent names\"(3) in the hearts of those  who know. And upon His household and companions be abundant and abiding  and eternal peace!    Further, we have harkened to what the nightingale of knowledge sang on the  boughs of the tree of thy being, and learned what the dove of certitude  cried on the branches of the bower of thy heart. Methinks I verily inhaled  the pure fragrances of the garment of thy love, and attained thy very  meeting from perusing thy letter. And since I noted thy mention of thy  death in God, and thy life through Him, and thy love for the beloved of  God and the Manifestations of His Names and the Dawning-Points of His  Attributes--I therefore reveal unto thee sacred and resplendent tokens from  the planes of glory, to attract thee into the court of holiness and  nearness and beauty, and draw thee to a station wherein thou shalt see  nothing in creation save the Face of thy Beloved One, the Honored, and  behold all created things only as in the day wherein none hath a mention.    Of this hath the nightingale of oneness sung in the garden of  Ghawthiyyih.(4) He saith: \"And there shall appear upon the tablet of thine  heart a writing of the subtle mysteries of 'Fear God and God will give you  knowledge';(5) and the bird of thy soul shall recall the holy sanctuaries  of preexistence and soar on the wings of longing in the heaven of 'walk  the beaten paths of thy Lord',(6) and gather the fruits of communion in  the gardens of 'Then feed on every kind of fruit.'\"(7)    By My life, O friend, wert thou to taste of these fruits, from the green  garden of these blossoms which grow in the lands of knowledge, beside the  orient lights of the Essence in the mirrors of names and  attributes--yearning would seize the reins of patience and reserve from out  thy hand, and make thy soul to shake with the flashing light, and draw  thee from the earthly homeland to the first, heavenly abode in the Center  of Realities, and lift thee to a plane wherein thou wouldst soar in the  air even as thou walkest upon the earth, and move over the water as thou  runnest on the land. Wherefore, may it rejoice Me, and thee, and whosoever  mounteth into the heaven of knowledge, and whose heart is refreshed by  this, that the wind of certitude hath blown over the garden of his being,  from the Sheba of the All-Merciful.    Peace be upon him who followeth the Right Path!    And further: The stages that mark the wayfarer's journey from the abode of  dust to the heavenly homeland are said to be seven. Some have called these  Seven Valleys, and others, Seven Cities. And they say that until the  wayfarer taketh leave of self, and traverseth these stages, he shall never  reach to the ocean of nearness and union, nor drink of the peerless wine.  The first is          The Valley of Search      The steed of this Valley is patience; without patience the wayfarer on  this journey will reach nowhere and attain no goal. Nor should he ever be  downhearted; if he strive for a hundred thousand years and yet fail to  behold the beauty of the Friend, he should not falter. For those who seek  the Ka'bih(8) of \"for Us\" rejoice in the tidings: \"In Our ways will We  guide them.\"(9) In their search, they have stoutly girded up the loins of  service, and seek at every moment to journey from the plane of  heedlessness into the realm of being. No bond shall hold them back, and no  counsel shall deter them.    It is incumbent on these servants that they cleanse the heart--which is the  wellspring of divine treasures--from every marking, and that they turn away  from imitation, which is following the traces of their forefathers and  sires, and shut the door of friendliness and enmity upon all the people of  the earth.    In this journey the seeker reacheth a stage wherein he seeth all created  things wandering distracted in search of the Friend. How many a Jacob will  he see, hunting after his Joseph; he will behold many a lover, hasting to  seek the Beloved, he will witness a world of desiring ones searching after  the One Desired. At every moment he findeth a weighty matter, in every  hour he becometh aware of a mystery; for he hath taken his heart away from  both worlds, and set out for the Ka'bih(10) of the Beloved. At every step,  aid from the Invisible Realm will attend him and the heat of his search  will grow.    One must judge of search by the standard of the Majnun of Love.(11) It is  related that one day they came upon Majnun sifting the dust, and his tears  flowing down. They said, \"What doest thou?\" He said, \"I seek for Layli.\"  They cried, \"Alas for thee! Layli is of pure spirit, and thou seekest her  in the dust!\" He said, \"I seek her everywhere; haply somewhere I shall  find her.\"    Yea, although to the wise it be shameful to seek the Lord of Lords in the  dust, yet this betokeneth intense ardor in searching. \"Whoso seeketh out a  thing with zeal shall find it.\"(12)    The true seeker hunteth naught but the object of his quest, and the lover  hath no desire save union with his beloved. Nor shall the seeker reach his  goal unless he sacrifice all things. That is, whatever he hath seen, and  heard, and understood, all must he set at naught, that he may enter the  realm of the spirit, which is the City of God. Labor is needed, if we are  to seek Him; ardor is needed, if we are to drink of the honey of reunion  with Him; and if we taste of this cup, we shall cast away the world.    On this journey the traveler abideth in every land and dwelleth in every  region. In every face, he seeketh the beauty of the Friend; in every  country he looketh for the Beloved. He joineth every company, and seeketh  fellowship with every soul, that haply in some mind he may uncover the  secret of the Friend, or in some face he may behold the beauty of the  Loved One.    And if, by the help of God, he findeth on this journey a trace of the  traceless Friend, and inhaleth the fragrance of the long-lost Joseph from  the heavenly messenger,(13) he shall straightway step into          The Valley of Love      and be dissolved in the fire of love. In this city the heaven of ecstasy  is upraised and the world-illuming sun of yearning shineth, and the fire  of love is ablaze; and when the fire of love is ablaze, it burneth to  ashes the harvest of reason.    Now is the traveler unaware of himself, and of aught besides himself. He  seeth neither ignorance nor knowledge, neither doubt nor certitude; he  knoweth not the morn of guidance from the night of error. He fleeth both  from unbelief and faith, and deadly poison is a balm to him. Wherefore  Attar(14) saith:      For the infidel, error--for the faithful, faith;    For Attar's heart, an atom of Thy pain.    The steed of this Valley is pain; and if there be no pain this journey  will never end. In this station the lover hath no thought save the  Beloved, and seeketh no refuge save the Friend. At every moment he  offereth a "]]]
