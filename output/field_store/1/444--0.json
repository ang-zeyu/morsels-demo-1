Let no one out! An accident has occurred, and nobody's  to leave the building.\"    There was but one person near either of the doors, and as he chanced to  be a man closely connected with the museum,--being, in fact, one of its  most active directors,--he immediately turned about and in obedience to a  gesture made by the attendant, ran up the marble steps, followed by some  dozen others.    At the top they all turned, as by common consent, toward the left-hand  gallery, where in the section marked II, a tableau greeted them which few  of them will ever forget.    I say \"tableau\" because the few persons concerned in it stood as in a  picture, absolutely motionless and silent as the dead. Sense, if not  feeling, was benumbed in them all, as in another moment it was benumbed  in the breasts of these new arrivals. Tragedy was there in its most  terrible, its most pathetic, aspect. The pathos was given by the  victim,--a young and pretty girl lying face upward on the tessellated  floor with an arrow in her breast and death stamped unmistakably on every  feature,--the terror by the look and attitude of the woman they saw  kneeling over her--a remarkable woman, no longer young, but of a presence  to hold the attention, even if the circumstances had been of a far less  tragic nature. Her hand was on the arrow but she had made no movement to  withdraw it, and her eyes, fixed upon space, showed depths of horror  hardly to be explained even by the suddenness and startling character  of the untoward fatality of which she had just been made the unhappy  witness.    The director, whose name was Roberts, thought as he paused on the edge of  the crowd that he had never seen a countenance upon which woe had stamped  so deep a mark; and greatly moved by it, he was about to seek some  explanation of a scene to which appearances gave so little clue, when the  tall but stooping figure of the Curator entered, and he found himself  relieved from a task whose seriousness he had no difficulty in measuring.    To those who knew William Jewett well, it was evident that he had been  called from some task which still occupied his thoughts and for the  moment somewhat bewildered his understanding. But as he was a  conscientious man and quite capable of taking the lead when once roused  to the exigencies of an occasion, Mr. Roberts felt a certain interest in  watching the slow awakening of this self-absorbed man to the awful  circumstances which in one instant had clouded the museum in an  atmosphere of mysterious horror.    When the full realization came,--which was not till a way had been made  for him to the side of the stricken woman crouching over the dead  child,--the energy which transformed his countenance and gave character  to his usually bent and inconspicuous figure was all if not more than the  anxious director expected.    Finding that his attempts to meet the older woman's eye only prolonged  the suspense, the Curator addressed her quietly, and in sympathetic tones  inquired whose child this was and how so dreadful a thing had happened.    She did not answer. She did not even look his way. With a rapid glance  into the faces about him, ending in one of deep compassion directed  toward herself, he repeated his question.    Still no response--still that heavy silence, that absolute immobility of  face and limb. If her faculty of hearing was dulled, possibly she would  yield to that of touch. Stooping, he laid his hand on her arm.    This roused her. Slowly her eyes lost their fixed stare and took on a  more human light. A shudder shook her frame, and gazing down into the  countenance of the young girl lying at her feet, she broke into moans of  such fathomless despair as wrung the hearts of all about her.    It was a scene to test the nerve of any man. To one of the Curator's  sympathetic temperament it was well-nigh unendurable. Turning to those  nearest, he begged for an explanation of what they saw before them:    \"Some one here must be able to tell me. Let that some one speak.\"    At this the quietest and least conspicuous person present, a young man  heavily spectacled and of student-like appearance, advanced a step and  said:    \"I was the first person to come in here after this poor young lady fell.  I was looking at coins just beyond the partition there, when I heard a  gasping cry. I had not heard her fall--I fear I was very much preoccupied  in my search for an especial coin I had been told I should find here--but  I did hear the cry she gave, and startled by the sound, left the section  where I was and entered this one, only to see just what you are seeing  now.\"    The Curator pointed at the two women.    \"This? The one woman kneeling over the other with her hand on the arrow?\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    A change took place in the Curator's expression. Involuntarily his eyes  rose to the walls hung closely with Indian relics, among which was a  quiver in which all could see arrows similar to the one now in the breast  of the young girl lying dead before them.    \"This woman must be made to speak,\" he said in answer to the low murmur  which followed this discovery. \"If there is a doctor present----\"    Waiting, but receiving no response, he withdrew his hand from the woman's  arm and laid it on the arrow.    This roused her completely. Loosing her own grasp upon the shaft, she  cried, with sudden realization of the people pressing about her:    \"I could not draw it. That causes death, they say. Wait! she may still be  alive. She may have a word to speak.\"    She was bending to listen. It was hardly a favorable moment for further  questioning, but the Curator in his anxiety could not refrain from  saying:    \"Who is she? What is her name and what is yours?\"    \"Her name?\" repeated the woman, rising to face him again. \"How should I  know? I was passing through this gallery and had just stopped to take a  look into the court when this young girl bounded by me from behind and  flinging up her arms, fell with a deep sigh to the floor. I saw an arrow  in her breast, and----\"    Emotion choked her, and when some one asked if the girl was a stranger to  her, she simply bowed her head; then, letting her gaze pass from face to  face till it had completed the circle of those about her, she said in her  former mechanical way:    \"My name is Ermentrude Taylor. I came to look at the bronzes. I should  like to go now.\"    But the crowd which had formed about her was too compact to allow her to  pass. Besides, the director, Mr. Roberts, had something to say first.  Working his way forward, he waited till he had attracted her attention  and then remarked in his most considerate manner:    \"You will pardon these importunities, Mrs. Taylor. I am a director of  this museum, and if Mr. Jewett will excuse me,\"--here he bowed to the  Curator,--\"I should like to inquire from what direction the arrow came  which ended this young girl's life?\"    For a moment she stood aghast, fixing him with her eye as though to ask  whither this inquiry tended. Then with an air of intention which was not  without some strange element of fear, she allowed her glance to travel  across the court till it rested upon the row of connected arches facing  them from the opposite gallery.    \"Ah,\" said he, putting her look into words, \"you think the arrow came  from the other side of the building. Did you see anyone over there,--in  the gallery, I mean,--at or before the instant of this young girl's  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17766"],[0,"With Wolfe in Canada: The Winning of a Continent (#1)"],[1,"WOLFE IN CANADA    Or The Winning of a Continent    by    G.

My Dear Lads,    In the present volume I have endeavoured to give the details of the  principal events in a struggle whose importance can hardly be  overrated. At its commencement the English occupied a mere patch of  land on the eastern seaboard of America, hemmed in on all sides by the  French, who occupied not only Canada in the north and Louisiana in the  south, but possessed a chain of posts connecting them, so cutting off  the English from all access to the vast countries of the west.    On the issues of that struggle depended not only the destiny of Canada,  but of the whole of North America and, to a large extent, that of the  two mother countries. When the contest began, the chances of France  becoming the great colonizing empire of the world were as good as those  of England. Not only did she hold far larger territories in America  than did England, but she had rich colonies in the West Indies, where  the flag of England was at that time hardly represented, and her  prospects in India were better than our own. At that time, too, she  disputed with us on equal terms the empire of the sea.    The loss of her North American provinces turned the scale. With the  monopoly of such a market, the commerce of England increased  enormously, and with her commerce her wealth and power of extension,  while the power of France was proportionately crippled. It is true  that, in time, the North American colonies, with the exception of  Canada, broke away from their connection with the old country; but they  still remained English, still continued to be the best market for our  goods and manufactures.    Never was the short-sightedness of human beings shown more distinctly,  than when France wasted her strength and treasure in a sterile contest  on the continent of Europe, and permitted, with scarce an effort, her  North American colonies to be torn from her.    All the historical details of the war have been drawn from the  excellent work entitled Montcalm and Wolfe, by Mr. Francis Parkman, and  from the detailed history of the Louisbourg and Quebec expeditions, by  Major Knox, who served under Generals Amherst and Wolfe.    Yours very sincerely,    G. A. Henty.        Chapter 1: A Rescue.      Most of the towns standing on our seacoast have suffered a radical  change in the course of the last century. Railways, and the fashion of  summer holiday making, have transformed them altogether, and great  towns have sprung up where fishing villages once stood. There are a few  places, however, which seem to have been passed by, by the crowd. The  number yearly becomes smaller, as the iron roads throw out fresh  branches. With the advent of these comes the speculative builder. Rows  of terraces and shops are run up, promenades are made, bathing machines  and brass bands become familiar objects, and in a few years the  original character of the place altogether disappears.    Sidmouth, for a long time, was passed by, by the world of holiday  makers. East and west of her, great changes took place, and many far  smaller villages became fashionable seaside watering places. The  railway, which passed by some twelve miles away, carried its tens of  thousands westward, but left few of them for Sidmouth, and anyone who  visited the pretty little place, fifteen years back, would have seen it  almost as it stood when our story opens a century ago.    There are few places in England with a fairer site. It lies embosomed  in the hills, which rise sharply on either side of it, while behind  stretches a rich, undulating country, thickly dotted with orchards and  snug homesteads, with lanes bright with wildflowers and ferns, with  high hedges and trees meeting overhead. The cold breezes, which render  so bare of interest the walks round the great majority of our seaside  towns, pass harmlessly over the valley of the Sid, where the vegetation  is as bright and luxuriant as if the ocean lay leagues away, instead of  breaking on the shore within a few feet of the front line of houses.    The cliffs which, on either side, rise from the water's edge, are  neither white like those to the east, nor grey as are the rugged  bulwarks to the west. They are of a deep red, warm and pleasant to the  eye, with clumps of green showing brightly up against them on every  little ledge where vegetation can get a footing; while the beach is  neither pebble, nor rock, nor sand, but a smooth, level surface sloping  evenly down; hard and pleasant to walk on when the sea has gone down,  and the sun has dried and baked it for an hour or two; but slippery and  treacherous when freshly wetted, for the red cliffs are of clay. Those  who sail past in a boat would hardly believe that this is so, for the  sun has baked its face, and the wind dried it, till it is cracked and  seamed, and makes a brave imitation of red granite; but the clammy  ooze, when the sea goes down, tells its nature only too plainly, and  Sidmouth will never be a popular watering place for children, for there  is no digging sand castles here, and a fall will stain light dresses  and pinafores a ruddy hue, and the young labourers will look as if they  had been at work in a brick field.    But a century since, the march of improvement had nowhere begun; and  there were few larger, and no prettier, seaside villages on the coast  than Sidmouth.    It was an afternoon in August. The sun was blazing down hotly, scarce a  breath of wind was stirring, and the tiny waves broke along the shore  with a low rustle like that of falling leaves. Some fishermen were at  work, recaulking a boat hauled up on the shore. Others were laying out  some nets to dry in the sun. Some fisher boys were lying asleep, like  dogs basking in the heat; and a knot of lads, sitting under the shade  of a boat, were discussing with some warmth the question of smuggling.    \"What do you say to it, Jim Walsham?\" one of the party said, looking up  at a boy some twelve years old, who was leaning against a boat, but who  had hitherto taken no part in the discussion.    \"There is no doubt that it's wrong,\" the boy said. \"Not wrong like  stealing, and lying, and that sort of thing; still it's wrong, because  it's against the law; and the revenue men, if they come upon a gang  landing the tubs, fight with them, and if any are killed they are not  blamed for it, so there is no doubt about its being wrong. Then, on the  other hand, no one thinks any the worse of the men that do it, and  there is scarce a one, gentle or simple, as won't buy some of the stuff  if he gets a chance, so it can't be so very wrong. It must be great fun  to be a smuggler, to be always dodging the king's cutters, and running  cargoes under the nose of the officers ashore. There is some excitement  in a life like that.\"    \"There is plenty of excitement in fishing,\" one of the boys said  sturdily. \"If you had been out in that storm last March, you would have  had as much excitement as you liked. For twelve hours we expected to go  down every minute, and we were half our time bailing for our lives.\"    An approving murmur broke from the others, who were all, with the  exception of the one addressed as Jim Walsham, of the fisher class. His  clothing differed but little from that of the rest. His dark blue pilot  trousers were old and sea stained, his hands and face were dyed brown  with exposure to the sun and the salt water; but there was something,  in his manner and tone of voice, which showed that a distinction  existed.    James Walsham was, indeed, the son of the late doctor of the village,  who had died two years previously. Dr. Walsham had been clever in his  profession, but circumstances were against him. Sidmouth and its  neighbourhood were so healthy, that his patients were few and far  between; and when he died, of injuries received from being thrown over  his horse's head, when the animal one night trod on a stone coming down  the hill into Sidmouth, his widow and son were left almost penniless.    Mrs. Walsham was, fortunately, an energetic woman, and a fortnight  after her husband's death, she went round among the tradesmen of the  place and the farmers of the neighbourhood, and announced her intention  of opening a school for girls. She had received a good education, being  the daughter of a clergyman, and she soon obtained enough pupils to  enable her to pay her way, and to keep up the pretty home in which her  husband lived in the outskirts of Sidmouth.    If she would have taken boarders, she could have obtained far higher  terms, for good schools were scarce; but this she would not do, and her  pupils all lived within distances where they could walk backwards and  forwards to their homes. Her evenings she devoted to her son, and,  though the education which she was enabled to give him would be  considered meagre, indeed, in these days of universal cramming, he  learned as much as the average boy of the period.    He would have learned more had he followed her desires, and devoted the  time when she was engaged in teaching to his books; but this he did not  do. For a few"]]]
