Fort Wayne, Indiana: Project Wittenberg, 2004    I. The Ten Commandments  The Simple Way a Father Should Present Them to His Household    The First Commandment    You must not have other gods. (Exodus 20:3)    What does this mean?    We must fear, love, and trust God more than anything else.    The Second Commandment    You must not misuse your God's name. (Exodus 20:7)    What does this mean?    We must fear and love God, so that we will not use His name to curse,  swear, cast a spell, lie or deceive, but will use it to call upon Him,  pray to Him, praise Him and thank Him in all times of trouble.    The Third Commandment    You must keep the Sabbath holy. (Exodus 20:8)    What does this mean?    We must fear and love God, so that we will not look down on preaching  or God's Word, but consider it holy, listen to it willingly, and learn  it.    The Fourth Commandment    You must honor your father and mother. [So that things will go well for  you and you will live long on earth]. (Exodus 20:12)    What does this mean?    We must fear and love God, so that we will neither look down on our  parents or superiors nor irritate them, but will honor them, serve  them, obey them, love them and value them.    The Fifth Commandment    You must not kill. (Exodus 20:13)    What does this mean?    We must fear and love God, so that we will neither harm nor hurt our  neighbor's body, but help him and care for him when he is ill.    The Sixth Commandment    You must not commit adultery. (Exodus 20:14)    What does this mean?    We must fear and love God, so that our words and actions will be clean  and decent and so that everyone will love and honor their spouses.    The Seventh Commandment    You must not steal. (Exodus 20:15)    What does this mean?    We must fear and love God, so that we will neither take our neighbor's  money or property, nor acquire it by fraud or by selling him poorly  made products, but will help him improve and protect his property and  career.    The Eighth Commandment    You must not tell lies about your neighbor. (Exodus 20:16 )    What does this mean?    We must fear and love God, so that we will not deceive by lying,  betraying, slandering or ruining our neighbor's reputation, but will  defend him, say good things about him, and see the best side of  everything he does.    The Ninth Commandment    You must not desire your neighbor's house. (Exodus 20:17)    What does this mean?    We must fear and love God, so that we will not attempt to trick our  neighbor out of his inheritance or house, take it by pretending to have  a right to it, etc. but help him to keep & improve it.    The Tenth Commandment    You must not desire your neighbor's wife, servant, maid, animals or  anything that belongs to him. (Exodus 20:17)    What does this mean?    We must fear and love God, so that we will not release our neighbor's  cattle, take his employees from him or seduce his wife, but urge them  to stay and do what they ought to do.    The Conclusion to the Commandments    What does God say to us about all these commandments?    This is what He says:  \"I am the Lord Your God. I am a jealous God. I plague the grandchildren  and great-grandchildren of those who hate me with their ancestor's sin.  But I make whole those who love me for a thousand generations.\" (Exodus  20:5)    What does it mean?    God threatens to punish everyone who breaks these commandments. We  should be afraid of His anger because of this and not violate such  commandments. But He promises grace and all good things to those who  keep such commandments. Because of this, we, too, should love Him,  trust Him, and willingly do what His commandments require.    II. The Creed  The Simple Way a Father Should Present it to His Household    The First Article  On Creation    I believe in God the Almighty Father, Creator of Heaven and Earth.    What does this mean?    I believe that God created me, along with all creatures. He gave to me:  my body and soul, my eyes, ears and all the other parts of my body, my  mind and all my senses. He preserves them as well. He gives me clothing  and shoes, food and drink, house and land, wife and children, fields,  animals and all I own. Every day He abundantly provides everything I  need to nourish this body and life. He protects me against all danger.  he shields and defends me from all evil. He does all this because of  His pure, fatherly and divine goodness and His mercy, not because I've  earned it or deserved it. For all of this, I must thank Him, praise  Him, serve Him and obey Him. Yes, this is true!    The Second Article  On Redemption    And in Jesus Christ, His only Son, our Lord, Who was conceived by the  Holy Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate,  was crucified, died and was buried, descended to Hell, on the third day  rose again from the dead, ascended to Heaven and sat down at the right  hand of God the Almighty Father. From there He will come to judge the  living and the dead.    What does this mean?    I believe that Jesus Christ is truly God, born of the Father in  eternity and also truly man, born of the Virgin Mary. He is my Lord! He  redeemed me, a lost and condemned person, bought and won me from all  sins, death and the authority of the Devil. It did not cost Him gold or  silver, but His holy, precious blood, His innocent body--His death!  Because of this, I am His very own, will live under Him in His kingdom  and serve Him righteously, innocently and blessedly forever, just as He  is risen from death, lives and reigns forever. Yes, this is true.    The Third Article  On Becoming Holy    I believe in the Holy Spirit, the holy Christian Church, the community  of the saints, the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body,  and an everlasting life. Amen.    What does this mean?    I believe that I cannot come to my Lord Jesus Christ by my own  intelligence or power. But the Holy Spirit called me by the Gospel,  enlightened me with His gifts, made me holy and kept me in the true  faith, just as He calls, gathers together, enlightens and makes holy  the whole Church on earth and keeps it with Jesus in the one, true  faith. In this Church, He generously forgives each day every sin  committed by me and by every believer. On the last day, He will raise  me and all the dead from the grave. He will give eternal life to me and  to all who believe in Christ. Yes, this is true!    III. The Our Father  The Simple Way a Father Should Present it to His Household    Introduction    Our Father, Who is in Heaven. (Matthew 6:9)    What does this mean?    In this introduction, God invites us to believe that He is our real  Father and we are His real children, so that we will pray with trust  and complete confidence, in the same way beloved children approach  their beloved Father with their requests.    The First Request    May Your name be holy. (Matthew 6:9)    What does this mean?    Of course, God's name is holy in and of itself, but by this request, we  pray that He will make it holy among us, too.    How does this take place?    It happens when God's Word is taught clearly and purely, and when we  live holy lives as God's children based upon it. Help us, Heavenly  Father, to do this! But anyone who teaches and lives by something other  than God's Word defiles God's name among us. Protect us from this,  Heavenly Father!    The Second Request    Your Kingdom come. (Matthew 6:10)    What does this mean?    Truly God's Kingdom comes by itself, without our prayer. But we pray in  this request that it come to us as well.    How does this happen?    It happens when the Heavenly Father gives us His Holy Spirit, so that  we believe His holy Word by His grace and live godly lives here in this  age and there in eternal life.    The Third Request    May Your will be accomplished. As it is Heaven, so may it be on Earth.  (Matthew 6:10)    What does this mean?    Truly, God's good and gracious will is accomplished without our prayer.  But we pray in this request that is accomplished among us as well.    How does this happen?    It happens when God destroys and interferes with every evil will and  all evil advice, which will not allow God's Kingdom to come, such as  the Devil's will, the world's will and will of our bodily desires. It  also happens when God strengthens us by faith and by His Word and keeps  us living by them faithfully until the end of our lives. This is His  will, good and full of grace.    The Fourth Request    Give us today our daily bread. (Matthew 6:11)    What does this mean?    Truly, God gives daily bread to evil people, even without our prayer.  But we pray in this request that He will help us realize this and  receive our daily bread with thanksgiving.    What does \"Daily bread\" mean?    Everything that nourishes our body and meets its needs, such as: Food,  drink, clothing, shoes, house, yard, fields, cattle, money,  possessions, a devout spouse, devout children, devout employees, devout  and faithful rulers, good government, good weather, peace, health,  discipline, honor, good friends, faithful neighbors and other things  like these.    The Fifth Request    And forgive our guilt, as we forgive those guilty of sinning against  us. (Matthew 6:12)    What does this mean?    We pray in this request that our Heavenly Father will neither pay  attention to our sins nor refuse requests such as these because of our  sins and because we are neither worthy nor deserve the things for which  we pray. Yet He wants to give them all to us"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16702"],[0,"The New York Times Current History of the European War, Vol. 1, January 9, 1915 (#1)"],[1,"Note: Project Gutenberg also has an HTML version of this        file which includes the original illustrations.

What Americans Say to Europe                [Illustration: CHARLES W. ELIOT    _(Photo (c) by Paul Thompson.)_    _See Page 473_]    [Illustration: JAMES M. BECK    _See Page 413_]          In the Supreme Court of Civilization    Argued by James M. Beck.      THE NEW YORK TIMES _submitted the evidence contained in the official  \"White Paper\" of Great Britain, the \"Orange Paper\" of Russia, and the  \"Gray Paper\" of Belgium to James M. Beck, late Assistant Attorney  General of the United States and a leader of the New York bar, who has  argued many of the most important cases before the Supreme Court. On  this evidence Mr. Beck has argued in the following article the case of  Dual Alliance vs. Triple Entente. It has been widely circulated in  France and Great Britain._    Let us suppose that in this year of dis-Grace, Nineteen Hundred and  Fourteen, there had existed, as let us pray will one day exist, a  Supreme Court of Civilization, before which the sovereign nations could  litigate their differences without resort to the iniquitous and less  effective appeal to the arbitrament of arms.    Let us further suppose that each of the contending nations had a  sufficient leaven of Christianity to have its grievances adjudged not by  the ethics of the cannon or the rifle, but by the eternal criterion of  justice.    What would be the judgment of that august tribunal?    Any discussion of the ethical merits of this great controversy must  start with the assumption that there is an international morality.    This fundamental axiom, upon which the entire basis of civilization  necessarily rests, is challenged by a small class of intellectual  perverts.    Some hold that moral considerations must be subordinated either to  military necessity or so-called manifest destiny. This is the Bernhardi  doctrine.    Others teach that war is a beneficent fatality and that all nations  engaged in it are therefore equally justified. On this theory all of the  now contending nations are but victims of an irresistible current of  events, and the highest duty of the State is to prepare itself for the  systematic extermination, when necessary or expedient, of its neighbors.    Notwithstanding the clever platitudes under which both these doctrines  are veiled, all morally sane minds are agreed that this war is a great  crime against civilization, and the only open question is, which of the  two contending groups of powers is morally responsible for that crime?    Was Austria justified in declaring war against Servia?    Was Germany justified in declaring war against Russia and France?    Was England justified in declaring war against Germany?    As the last of these questions is the most easily disposed of, it may be  considered first.      England's Justification.    England's justification rests upon the solemn Treaty of 1839, whereby  Prussia, France, England, Austria, and Russia \"became the guarantors\" of  the \"perpetual neutrality\" of Belgium, as reaffirmed by Count Bismarck,  then Chancellor of the North German Confederation, on July 22, 1870, and  as even more recently reaffirmed in the striking fact disclosed in the  Belgian \"Gray Book.\"    In the Spring of 1913 a debate was in progress in the Budget Committee  of the Reichstag with reference to the Military Budget. In the course of  the debate the German Secretary of State said:         \"The neutrality of Belgium is determined by international       conventions, _and Germany is resolved to respect these       conventions_.\"    To confirm this solemn assurance, the Minister of War added in the same  debate:         \"Belgium does not play any part in the justification of the       German scheme of military reorganization. The scheme is       justified by the position of matters in the East. _Germany       will not lose sight of the fact that Belgian neutrality is       guaranteed by international treaties._\"    A year later, on July 31, 1914, Herr von Below, the German Minister at  Brussels, assured the Belgian Department of State that he knew of a  declaration which the German Chancellor had made in 1911, to the effect  \"that Germany had no intention of violating our neutrality,\" and \"that  he was certain that the sentiments to which expression was given at that  time _had not changed_.\" (See Belgian \"Gray Book,\" Nos. 11 and 12.)    Apart from these treaty stipulations, which are only declaration of  Belgium's rights as sovereign nations, The Hague Conference, in which  forty-four nations (including Germany) participated, reaffirmed as an  axiom of international law the inherent right of a nation to the  sanctity of its territory.    It seems unnecessary to discuss the wanton disregard of these solemn  obligations and protestations, when the present Chancellor of the German  Empire, in his speech to the Reichstag and to the world on Aug. 4, 1914,  frankly admitted that the action of the German military machine in  invading Belgium was a wrong. He said:         \"We are now in a state of necessity, and necessity knows no       law. Our troops have occupied Luxemburg and perhaps are       already on Belgian soil. _Gentlemen, that is contrary to the       dictates of international law._ It is true that the French       Government has declared at Brussels that France is willing to       respect the neutrality of Belgium, so long as her opponent       respects it. We knew, however, that France stood ready for       invasion. France could wait, but we could not wait. A French       movement upon our flank upon the lower Rhine might have been       disastrous. So we were compelled to override the just protest       of the Luxemburg and Belgian Governments. _The wrong--I speak       openly--that we are committing_ we will endeavor to make good       as soon as our military goal has been reached. Anybody who is       threatened as we are threatened, and is fighting for his       highest possessions, can only have one thought--how he is to       hack his way through.\"    This defense is not even a plea of confession and avoidance. It is a  plea of \"Guilty\" at the bar of the world. It has one merit, that it  does not add to the crime the aggravation of hypocrisy. It virtually  rests the case of Germany upon the gospel of Treitschke and Bernhardi,  that each nation is justified in exerting its physical power to the  utmost in defense of its selfish interests and without any regard to  considerations of conventional morality. Might as between nations is the  sole criterion of right. There is no novelty in this gospel. Its only  surprising feature is its revival in the twentieth century. It was  taught far more effectively by Machiavelli in his treatise, \"The  Prince,\" wherein he glorified the policy of Cesare Borgia in trampling  the weaker States of Italy under foot by ruthless terrorism, unbridled  ferocity, and the basest deception. Indeed, the wanton destruction of  Belgium is simply Borgiaism amplified ten-thousandfold by the mechanical  resources of modern war.      This Answer Cannot Satisfy.    Unless our boasted civilization is the thinnest veneering of barbarism;  unless the law of the world is in fact only the ethics of the rifle and  the conscience of the cannon; unless mankind after uncounted centuries  has made no real advance in political morality beyond that of the cave  dweller, then this answer of Germany cannot satisfy the \"decent respect  to the opinions of mankind.\" Germany's contention that a treaty of peace  is \"a scrap of paper,\" to be disregarded at will when required by the  selfish interests of one contracting party, is the negation of all that  civilization stands for.    Belgium has been crucified in the face of the world. Its innocence of  any offense, until it was attacked, is too clear for argument. Its  voluntary immolation to preserve its solemn guarantee of neutrality will  \"plead like angels, trumpet-tongued, against the deep damnation of its  taking off.\" On that issue the Supreme Court could have no ground for  doubt or hesitation. Its judgment would be speedy and inexorable.    The remaining two issues, above referred to, are not so simple.  Primarily and perhaps exclusively, the ethical question turns upon the  issues raised by the communications which passed between the various  Chancelleries of Europe in the last week of July, for it is the amazing  feature of this greatest of all wars that it was precipitated by  diplomats and rulers, and, assuming that all these statesmen sincerely  desired a peaceful solution of the questions raised by the Austrian  ultimatum, (which is by no means clear,) it was the result of  ineffective diplomacy and clumsy diplomacy at that.    I quite appreciate the distinction between the immediate causes of a war  and the anterior and more fundamental causes; nevertheless, with the  world in a state of Summer peace on July 23, 1914, an issue, gravely  affecting the integrity of nations and the balance of power in Europe,  is suddenly precipitated by the Austrian ultimatum, and thereafter and  for the space of about a week a series of diplomatic communications  passed between the Chancelleries of Europe, designed on their face to  prevent a war and yet so ineffective that the war is precipitated and  the fearful Rubicon crossed before the world knew, except imperfectly,  the nature of the differences between the Governments involved. The  ethical aspects of this great conflict must largely depend upon the  record that has been made up by the official communications which can,  therefore, be treated as documentary evidence in a litigated"]]]
