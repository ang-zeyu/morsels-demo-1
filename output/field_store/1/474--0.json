LOGIC    DEDUCTIVE AND INDUCTIVE      BY    CARVETH READ, M.A.      AUTHOR OF    \"THE METAPHYSICS OF NATURE\"    \"NATURAL AND SOCIAL MORALS\"    ETC.      FOURTH EDITION    ENLARGED, AND PARTLY REWRITTEN      SIMPKIN, MARSHALL, HAMILTON, KENT & CO. LTD.,  4 STATIONERS' HALL COURT.  LONDON, E.C.4        [Transcriber's Note: The mathematical operator \"therefore\" is  represented below by .'.]    PREFACE      In this edition of my _Logic_, the text has been revised throughout,  several passages have been rewritten, and some sections added. The chief  alterations and additions occur in cc. i., v., ix., xiii., xvi., xvii.,  xx.    The work may be considered, on the whole, as attached to the school of  Mill; to whose _System of Logic_, and to Bain's _Logic_, it is deeply  indebted. Amongst the works of living writers, the _Empirical Logic_ of  Dr. Venn and the _Formal Logic_ of Dr. Keynes have given me most  assistance. To some others acknowledgments have been made as occasion  arose.    For the further study of contemporary opinion, accessible in English,  one may turn to such works as Mr. Bradley's _Principles of Logic_, Dr.  Bosanquet's _Logic; or the Morphology of Knowledge_, Prof. Hobhouse's  _Theory of Knowledge_, Jevon's _Principles of Science_, and Sigwart's  _Logic_. Ueberweg's _Logic, and History of Logical Doctrine_ is  invaluable for the history of our subject. The attitude toward Logic of  the Pragmatists or Humanists may best be studied in Dr. Schiller's  _Formal Logic_, and in Mr. Alfred Sidgwick's _Process of Argument_ and  recent _Elementary Logic_. The second part of this last work, on the  \"Risks of Reasoning,\" gives an admirably succinct account of their  position. I agree with the Humanists that, in all argument, the  important thing to attend to is the meaning, and that the most serious  difficulties of reasoning occur in dealing with the matter reasoned  about; but I find that a pure science of relation has a necessary place  in the system of knowledge, and that the formulae known as laws of  contradiction, syllogism and causation are useful guides in the framing  and testing of arguments and experiments concerning matters of fact.  Incisive criticism of traditionary doctrines, with some remarkable  reconstructions, may be read in Dr. Mercier's _New Logic_.    In preparing successive editions of this book, I have profited by the  comments of my friends: Mr. Thomas Whittaker, Prof. Claude Thompson, Dr.  Armitage Smith, Mr. Alfred Sidgwick, Dr. Schiller, Prof. Spearman, and  Prof. Sully, have made important suggestions; and I might have profited  more by them, if the frame of my book, or my principles, had been more  elastic.    As to the present edition, useful criticisms have been received from Mr.  S.C. Dutt, of Cotton College, Assam, and from Prof. M.A. Roy, of  Midnapore; and, especially, I must heartily thank my colleague, Dr.  Wolf, for communications that have left their impress upon nearly every  chapter.

When the lapse of time and accumulation of fresh material suggested the  need of a new and revised edition of Mr. Hezekiah Butterworth's _Story  of the Hymns_, which had been a popular text book on that subject for  nearly a generation, the publishers requested him to prepare such a  work, reviewing the whole field of hymnology and its literature down to  date. He undertook the task, but left it unfinished at his lamented  death, committing the manuscript to me in his last hours to arrange and  complete.    To do this proved a labor of considerable magnitude, since what had been  done showed evidence of the late author's failing strength, and when, in  a conference with the publishers, it was proposed to combine the two  books of Mr. Butterworth, the _Story of the Hymns_ and the _Story of the  Tunes_, in one volume, the task was doubled.    The charming popular style and story-telling gift of the well-known  compiler of these books had kept them in demand, the one for thirty and  the other for fifteen years, but later information had discounted some  of their historic and biographical matter, and, while many of the  monographs were too meagre, others were unduly long. Besides, the _Story  of the Tunes_, so far from being the counterpart of the _Story of the  Hymns_, bore no special relationship to it, only a small portion of its  selections answering to any in the hymn-list of the latter book. For a  personal friend and practically unknown writer, to follow Mr.  Butterworth, and \"improve\" his earlier work to the more modern  conditions, was a venture of no little difficulty and delicacy. The  result is submitted as simply a conscientious effort to give the best of  the old with the new.    So far as was possible, matter from the two previous books, and from the  crude manuscript, has been used, and passages here and there  transcribed, but so much of independent plan and original research has  been necessary in arranging and verifying the substance of the chapters  that the _Story of the Hymns and Tunes_ is in fact a new volume rather  than a continuation. The chapter containing the account of the _Gospel  Hymns_ is recent work with scarcely an exception, and the one on the  _Hymns of Wales_ is entirely new.    Without increasing the size of this volume beyond easy purchase and  convenient use, it was impossible to discuss the great oratorios and  dramatic set-pieces, festival and occasional, and only passing  references are made to them or their authors.

THERON BROWN.    Boston, May 15th, 1906.          INTRODUCTION.      Augustine defines a hymn as \"praise to God with song,\" and another  writer calls hymn-singing \"a devotional approach to God in our  emotions,\"--which of course applies to both the words and the music.  This religious emotion, reverently acknowledging the Divine Being in  song, is a constant element, and wherever felt it makes the song a  worship, irrespective of sect or creed. An eminent Episcopal divine,  (says the _Christian Register_,) one Trinity Sunday, at the close of his  sermon, read three hymns by Unitarian authors: one to God the Father, by  Samuel Longfellow, one to Jesus, by Theodore Parker, and one to the Holy  Spirit, by N.L. Frothingham. \"There,\" he said, \"you have the  Trinity--Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.\"    It is natural to speak of hymns as \"poems,\" indiscriminately, for they  have the same structure. But a hymn is not necessarily a poem, while a  poem that can be sung as a hymn is something more than a poem.  Imagination makes poems; devotion makes hymns. There can be poetry  without emotion, but a hymn never. A poem may argue; a hymn must not.  In short to be a hymn, what is written must express spiritual feelings  and desires. The music of faith, hope and charity will be somewhere in  its strain.    Philosophy composes poems, but not hymns. \"It is no love-symphony we  hear when the lion thinkers roar,\" some blunt writer has said. \"The  moles of Science have never found the heavenly dove's nest, and the Sea  of Reason touches no shore where balm for sorrow grows.\"    On the contrary there are thousands of true hymns that have no standing  at the court of the muses. Even Cowper's Olney hymns, as Goldwin Smith  has said, \"have not any serious value as poetry. Hymns rarely have,\" he  continues. \"There is nothing in them on which the creative imagination  can be exercised. Hymns can be little more than the incense of a  worshipping soul.\"    A fellow-student of Phillips Brooks tells us that \"most of his verse he  wrote rapidly without revising, not putting much thought into it but  using it as the vehicle and outlet of his feelings. It was the sign of  responding love or gratitude and joy.\"    To produce a hymn one needs something more exalting than poetic fancy;  an influence       \"--subtler than the sun-light in the leaf-bud      That thrills thro' all the forest, making May.\"    It is the Divine Spirit wakening the human heart to lyric language.    Religion sings; that is true, though all \"religions\" do not sing. There  is no voice of sacred song in Islamism. The muezzin call from the  minarets is not music. One listens in vain for melody among the  worshippers of the \"Light of Asia.\" The hum of pagoda litanies, and the  shouts and gongs of idol processions are not psalms. But many historic  faiths have lost their melody, and we must go far back in the annals of  ethnic life to find the songs they sung.    Worship appears to have been a primitive human instinct; and even when  many gods took the place of One in the blinder faith of men it was  nature worship making deities of the elements and addressing them with  supplication and praise. Ancient hymns have been found on the monumental  tablets of the cities of Nimrod; fragments of the Orphic and Homeric  hymns are preserved in Greek anthology; many of the Vedic hymns are  extant in India; and the exhumed stones of Egypt have revealed segments  of psalm-prayers and liturgies that antedate history. Dr. Wallis Budge,  the English Orientalist, notes the discovery of a priestly hymn two  thousand years older than the time of Moses, "]]]
