It  witnessed, however, the gradual crystallization of those potent spiritual  forces which were to culminate in the declaration of His world-embracing  mission in 1863. In the course of these years, and from the city of  Ba_gh_dad, there radiated, Shoghi Effendi writes, \"wave after wave, a  power, a radiance and a glory which insensibly reanimated a languishing  Faith, sorely-stricken, sinking into obscurity, threatened with oblivion.  From it were diffused, day and night, and with ever-increasing energy, the  first emanations of a Revelation which, in its scope, its copiousness, its  driving force and the volume and variety of its literature, was destined  to excel that of the Bab Himself.\"(1)    Among these early effusions of the Pen of Glory is a lengthy Arabic  epistle known as the Javahiru'l-Asrar, meaning literally the \"gems\" or  \"essences\" of mysteries. A number of themes it enunciates are also  elaborated in Persian--through different revelatory modes--in the Seven  Valleys and the Book of Certitude, those two immortal volumes which Shoghi  Effendi has characterized, respectively, as Baha'u'llah's greatest  mystical composition and His pre-eminent doctrinal work. Undoubtedly the  Gems of Divine Mysteries figures among those \"Tablets revealed in the  Arabic tongue\" which were referred to in the latter volume.(2)    One of the central themes of the book, Baha'u'llah indicates, is that of  \"transformation\", meaning here the return of the Promised One in a  different human guise. Indeed, in a prefatory note written above the  opening lines of the original manuscript, Baha'u'llah states:    This treatise was written in reply to a seeker who had asked how the  promised Mihdi could have become transformed into 'Ali-Muhammad (the Bab).  The opportunity provided by this question was seized to elaborate on a  number of subjects, all of which are of use and benefit both to them that  seek and to those who have attained, could ye perceive with the eye of  divine virtue.    The seeker alluded to in the above passage was Siyyid Yusuf-i-Sihdihi  Isfahani, who at the time was residing in Karbila. His questions were  presented to Baha'u'llah through an intermediary, and this Tablet was  revealed in response on the same day.    A number of other important themes are addressed in this work as well: the  cause of the rejection of the Prophets of the past; the danger of a  literal reading of scripture; the meaning of the signs and portents of the  Bible concerning the advent of the new Manifestation; the continuity of  divine revelation; intimations of Baha'u'llah's own approaching  declaration; the significance of such symbolic terms as \"the Day of  Judgement\", \"the Resurrection\", \"attainment to the Divine Presence\", and  \"life and death\"; and the stages of the spiritual quest through \"the  Garden of Search\", \"the City of Love and Rapture\", \"the City of Divine  Unity\", \"the Garden of Wonderment\", \"the City of Absolute Nothingness\",  \"the City of Immortality\", and \"the City that hath no name or  description\".    The publication of Gems of Divine Mysteries is one of the projects  undertaken in fulfilment of the Five Year Plan goal, announced in April  2001, of \"enriching the translations into English from the Holy Texts\".  The volume will further deepen the Western reader's appreciation of a  period infused with potentiality and described by Shoghi Effendi as \"the  vernal years of Baha'u'llah's ministry\", and assist the students of His  Revelation in gaining a more profound insight into its gradual unfoldment.              GEMS OF DIVINE MYSTERY          The essence of the divine mysteries in the journeys of ascent set      forth for those who long to draw nigh unto God, the Almighty, the      Ever-Forgiving--blessed be the righteous that quaff from these      crystal streams!                          HE IS THE EXALTED, THE MOST HIGH!    1 O thou who treadest the path of justice and beholdest the countenance of  mercy! Thine epistle was received, thy question was noted, and the sweet  accents of thy soul were heard from the inmost chambers of thy heart.  Whereupon the clouds of the Divine Will were raised to rain upon thee the  outpourings of heavenly wisdom, to divest thee of all that thou hadst  acquired aforetime, to draw thee from the realms of contradiction unto the  retreats of oneness, and to lead thee to the sacred streams of His Law.  Perchance thou mayest quaff therefrom, repose therein, quench thy thirst,  refresh thy soul, and be numbered with those whom the light of God hath  guided aright in this day.    2 Encompassed as I am at this time by the dogs of the earth and the beasts  of every land, concealed as I remain in the hidden habitation of Mine  inner Being, forbidden as I may be from divulging that which God hath  bestowed upon Me of the wonders of His knowledge, the gems of His wisdom,  and the tokens of His power, yet am I loath to frustrate the hopes of one  who hath approached the sanctuary of grandeur, sought to enter within the  precincts of eternity, and aspired to soar in the immensity of this  creation at the dawning of the divine decree. I shall therefore relate  unto thee certain truths from among those which God hath vouchsafed unto  Me, this only to the extent that souls can bear and minds endure, lest the  malicious raise a clamour or the dissemblers hoist their banners. I  implore God to graciously aid Me in this, for unto such as beseech Him, He  is the All-Bounteous, and of those who show mercy, He is the Most  Merciful.    3 Know then that it behoveth thine eminence to ponder from the outset  these questions in thy heart: What hath prompted the divers peoples and  kindreds of the earth to reject the Apostles whom God hath sent unto them  in His might and power, whom He hath raised up to exalt His Cause and  ordained to be the Lamps of eternity within the Niche of His oneness? For  what reason have the people turned aside from them, disputed about them,  risen against and contended with them? On what grounds have they refused  to acknowledge their apostleship and authority, nay, denied their truth  and reviled their persons, even slaying or banishing them?    4 O thou who hast set foot in the wilderness of knowledge and taken abode  within the ark of wisdom! Not until thou hast grasped the mysteries  concealed in that which We shall relate unto thee canst thou hope to  attain to the stations of faith and certitude in the Cause of God and in  those who are the Manifestations of His Cause, the Daysprings of His  Command, the Treasuries of His revelation, and the Repositories of His  knowledge. Shouldst thou fail in this, thou wouldst be numbered with them  that have not striven for the Cause of God, nor inhaled the fragrance of  faith from the raiment of certitude, nor scaled the heights of the divine  unity, nor yet recognized the stations of divine singleness within the  Embodiments of praise and the Essences of sanctity.    5 Strive then, O My brother, to apprehend this matter, that the veils may  be lifted from the face of thy heart and that thou mayest be reckoned  among them whom God hath graced with such penetrating vision as to behold  the most subtle realities of His dominion, to fathom the mysteries of His  kingdom, to perceive the signs of His transcendent Essence in this mortal  world, and to attain a station wherein one seeth no distinction amongst  His creatures and findeth no flaw in the creation of the heavens and the  earth.(3)    6 Now that the discourse hath reached this exalted and intractable theme  and touched upon this sublime and impenetrable mystery, know that the  Christian and Jewish peoples have not grasped the intent of the words of  God and the promises He hath made to them in His Book, and have therefore  denied His Cause, turned aside from His Prophets, and rejected His proofs.  Had they but fixed their gaze upon the testimony of God itself, had they  refused to follow in the footsteps of the abject and foolish among their  leaders and divines, they would doubtless have attained to the repository  of guidance and the treasury of virtue, and quaffed from the crystal  waters of life eternal in the city of the All-Merciful, in the garden of  the All-Glorious,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1694"],[0,"Our Legal Heritage: The First Thousand Years: 600 - 1600 (#1)"],[1,"LEGAL HERITAGE  The first thousand years: 600 - 1600  King AEthelbert - Queen Elizabeth      2nd Edition            By      S. A. Reilly, Attorney  175 E. Delaware Place  Chicago, Illinois 60611-1724            1999        Preface    This was written to see what laws have been in existence for a  long time and therefore have proven their success in maintaining  a stable society. It's purpose is also to see the historical  context in which our legal doctrines were derived. It looks at  the inception of the common law system, the origin of the jury  system, the meaning in context of the Magna Carta provisions, the  emergence of attorneys, and the formation of probate law from  church origins.    This book is a primer. One may read it without prior knowledge in  history or law, although it will be more meaningful to lawyers  than to non-lawyers. Since it defines terms unique to English  legal history, it may serve as a good introduction on which to  base further reading in English legal history. The meaning of  some terms in King Aethelbert's code in Chapter 1 are unknown or  inexact.    The chapters are sequential. The title of each chapter in the  Table of Contents includes the time period covered. The title of  each chapter denotes an important legal development of that time  period.    Each chapter is divided into three sections: The Times, The Law,  and Judicial Procedure. The law section is the central section.  It describes the law governing the behavior and conduct of the  populace. It includes law of that time by which people lived  which is the same, similar, or a building block to the law of  today. In earlier times this is both statutory law and the common  law of the court. The Magna Carta, which is quoted in Chapter 7,  is the first statute of the Statutes at Large. The law sections  of Chapter 7 - 13 mainly quote or paraphrase most of these  statutes or the Statutes of the Realm. Excluded are statutes  which do not help us understand the development of our law, such  as statutes governing Wales after its conquest and statutes on  succession rights to the throne.    The first section of each chapter: The Times, sets a background  and context in which to better understand the laws. The usual  subject matter of history such as battles, famines, periods of  corruption, and international relations are omitted as not  helping to understand the process of civilization and development  of the law in the nation of England.    The last section of each chapter: Judicial Procedure, describes  the process of applying the law and trying cases for the  relevant time period. It also contains some examples of cases.    For clarity and easy comparison, amounts of money expressed in  pounds or marks have been converted to the smaller denominations  of shillings and pence. There are twenty shillings in a pound. A  mark in silver is two thirds of a pound.    The sources and reference books from which information was  obtained are listed in the bibliography instead of being  contained in tedious footnotes.

Epilogue: from 1604    Appendix: Sovereigns of England    Bibliography            Chapter 1    The Times: before 600    Clans, headed by Kings, lived in huts on top of hills or other  high places and fortified by circular or rectangular earth  ditches and banks behind which they could gather with their  herds for protection. At the entrances were several openings  only one of which really allowed entry. The others went between  banks into dead ends and served as traps in which to kill the  enemy from above. Concentric circles of ditches around these  fortified camps could reach to 14 acres. The people lived in  circular huts with wood posts in a circle supporting a roof. The  walls were made of saplings, and a mixture of mud and straw.  Sometimes there were stalls for cattle. Cooking was in a clay  oven inside or over an open fire on the outside. Forests  abounded with wolves, bears, wild boars, and wild cattle.    People wore animal skins over their bodies for warmth and around  their feet for protection when walking. They carried small items  by hooking them onto their belts.    Pathways extended through this camp of huts and for many miles  beyond. They were used for trade and transport with pack horses.      Men bought or captured women for wives and carried them over the  thresholds of their huts. The first month of marriage was called  the honeymoon because the couple was given mead, a drink with  fermented honey and herbs, for the first month of their  marriage. A wife wore a gold wedding band on the ring finger of  her left hand to show that she was married. Women wore other  jewelry too, which indicated their social rank.    Women usually stayed at home caring for children, preparing  meals, and making baskets. They also made wool felt and spun and  wove wool into cloth. Flax was grown and woven into linen cloth.  The weaving was done on an upright or warp- weighted loom. People  draped the cloth around their bodies and fastened it with a  metal brooch inlayed with gold, gems, glass, and shell, which  were glued on with glue that was obtained from melting animal  hooves. They also had amber beads and pendants. They could tie  things with rawhide strips or rope braids they made. They cut  things with flint dug up from pits. On the coast, they made bone  harpoons for deep sea fish.    The King, who was tall and strong, led his men in hunting groups  to kill deer and other wild animals in the forests and to fish  in the streams. Some men brought their hunting dogs on leashes  to follow scent trails to the animal. The men attacked the  animals with spears and threw stones. They used shields to  protect their bodies. They watched the phases of the moon and  learned to predict when it would be full and give the most light  for night hunting. This began the concept of a month.    If hunting groups from two clans tried to follow the same deer,  there might be a fight between the clans or a blood feud. After  the battle, the clan would bring back its dead and wounded. A  priest officiated over a funeral for a dead man. His wife would  often also go on the funeral pyre with him. Memorial burial  mounds would be erected over the corpses or cremated ashes of  their great men. Later, these ashes were first placed in urns  before burial in a mound of earth or the corpses were buried  with a few personal items.    The priest also officiated over sacrifices of humans, who were  usually offenders found guilty of transgressions. Sacrifices  were usually made in time of war or pestilence, and usually  before the winter made food scarce, at Halloween time. Humans  were sometimes eaten.    The clan ate deer that had been cooked on a spit over a fire, and  fruits and vegetables which had been gathered by the women. They  drank water from springs. In the spring, food was plentiful.  There were eggs of different colors in nests and many rabbits to  eat. The goddess Easter was celebrated at this time.    After this hunting and gathering era, there was farming and  domestication of animals such as horses, pigs, sheep, goats,  chicken, and cattle. Of these, the pig was the most important  meat supply, being killed and salted for winter use. Next in  importance were the cattle. Sheep were kept primarily for their  wool. Flocks and herds were taken to pastures. The male cattle,  with wood yokes, pulled ploughs in the fields of barley and  wheat. The female goat and cow provided milk, butter, and  cheese. The chickens provided eggs. The hoe, spade, and grinding  stone were used. Cloth was woven for clothes. Pottery was made  from clay and used for food preparation and consumption. During  the period of \"lent\" [from the word \"lencten\", which means  spring], it was forbidden to eat any meat or fish. This was the  season in which many animals were born and grew a lot. The  people also made boats.    Circles of big stones like Stonehenge were built so that the  sun's position with respect to the stones would indicate the day  of longest sunlight and the day of shortest sunlight. Between  these days there was an optimum time to harvest the crops before  fall, when plants dried up and leaves fell from the trees. The  winter solstice, when the days began to get longer was cause for  celebration. In the next season, there was an optimum time to  plant seeds so they could spring up from the ground as new  growth. So farming gave rise to the concept of a year. Certain  changes of the year were celebrated, such as Easter; the twelve  days of Yuletide when candles were lit and houses decorated with  evergreen; Plough Monday for resumption of work after Yuletide;  May Day when greenery was gathered from the woods and people  danced around a May pole; Whitsun when Morris dancers leapt  through their villages with bells, hobby-horses, and waving  scarves; Lammas when the first bread was celebrated; and Harvest  Home when the effigy of a goddess was carried with reapers  singing and piping behind.    There were settlements on high ground and near rivers. Each  settlement had a meadow, for the mowing of"]]]
