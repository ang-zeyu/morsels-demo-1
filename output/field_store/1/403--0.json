PREFACE      In making a collection of prints from the works of Michelangelo, it is  impossible to secure any wide variety, either in subject or method of  treatment. We are dealing here with a master whose import is always  serious, and whose artistic individuality is strongly impressed on all  his works, either in sculpture or painting. Our selections represent  his best work in both arts. These are arranged, not in chronological  order, but in a way which will lead the student from the subjects most  familiar and easily understood to those which are more abstract and  difficult.

Michelangelo's place in the world of art is altogether unique. His  supremacy is acknowledged by all, but is understood by a few only. In  the presence of his works none can stand unimpressed, yet few dare to  claim any intimate knowledge of his art. The quality so vividly  described in the Italian word _terribilita_ is his predominant trait.  He is one to awe rather than to attract, to overwhelm rather than to  delight. The spectator must needs exclaim with humility, \"Such  knowledge is too wonderful for me; it is high, I cannot attain unto  it.\" Yet while Michelangelo can never be a popular artist in the  ordinary sense of the word, the powerful influence which he exercises  seems constantly increasing. Year by year there are more who, drawn by  the strange fascination of his genius, seek to read the meaning of his  art.    His subjects are all profoundly serious in intention. Life was no  holiday to this strenuous spirit; it was a stern conflict with the  powers of darkness in which such heroes as David and Moses were  needed. Like the old Hebrew prophets, the artist poured out his soul  in a vehement protest against evil, and a stirring call to  righteousness.    Considered both as a sculptor and a painter, Michelangelo's one  vehicle of expression was the human body. His works are \"form-poems,\"  through which he uttered his message to mankind. As he writes in one  of his own sonnets,        \"Nor hath God deigned to show himself elsewhere      More clearly than in human forms sublime.\"    In his art, says the critic Symonds, \"a well-shaped hand, or throat,  or head, a neck superbly poised on an athletic chest, the sway of the  trunk above the hips, the starting of the muscles on the flank, the  tendons of the ankle, the outline of the shoulder when the arm is  raised, the backward bending of the loins, the curves of a woman's  breast, the contours of a body careless in repose or strained for  action, were all words pregnant with profoundest meaning, whereby fit  utterance might be given to thoughts that raise man near to God.\"    Learning his first lessons in art of the Greeks, he soon possessed  himself of the great principles of classic sculpture. Then he boldly  struck out his own path; his was a spirit to lead, not to follow. With  the subtle Greek sense of line and form, he united an entirely new  motif. In contrast to the ideal of repose which was the leading canon  of the Greeks, his chosen ideal was one of action. Moreover, he  invariably fixed upon some decisive moment in the action he had to  represent, a moment which suggests both the one preceding and the one  following, and which gives us the whole story in epitome. Thus in the  David we see preparation, aim, and action. It was a far cry from the  elegant calm of the Greek god to the restless energy of this rugged  youth.    Even with seated figures he followed the same principle. Moses and the  Duke Giuliano are ready to rise to their feet if need be. In his  frescoes we again find the same motif,--Adam rising to his feet in  obedience to the Creator's summons, and Christ the Judge sweeping  asunder the multitudes.    In his love of action and his passion for the human form lay the  elements of his art most easily lending themselves to exaggeration.  That the master did indeed permit himself to be carried beyond due  limits in these matters is seen by comparing the grandeur of the  Sistine ceiling with the mannerisms of the Last Judgment. The interval  between was \"the time of his best technical and spiritual  creativeness,\" when he produced the statues of the Sacristy of S.  Lorenzo.    It was characteristic of Michelangelo's impetuous nature to spend his  enthusiasm upon the early stages of his work, and leave it unfinished.  This unfinished effect of many of his marbles seems to bring us in  closer touch with his methods as a sculptor. Nor is a rough surface  here and there inharmonious with the rugged character of his  conceptions. Moreover, as a critic[1] has pointed out, the polished  and rough portions enhance each other, giving a variety in the light  and shadow which is pictorial in effect.    [Footnote 1: See notes on the Life of Michelangelo Buonarotti in the  Blashfield-Hopkins edition of Vasari.]    To a man of Michelangelo's austere temperament, intensely masculine in  his predilections, the beauty of womanhood was not fully revealed. His  sibyls can scarcely be counted as women; they belong to a world of  their own, neither human nor divine. It was only in his few Madonnas  that we can trace his feminine ideal, an ideal noble and dignified,  rather than beautiful. The Madonna of the bas-relief is proud rather  than tender, the Virgin of the Pieta is grand rather than lovely.  These were works of his youth. Later in life, when he had known the  blessing of a good woman's friendship, he developed a new ideal in the  gentle and delicate womanhood of the Virgin of the Last Judgment.    Michelangelo has been compared to two great masters of dissimilar  arts, Milton and Beethoven. There are striking points of similarity  in the men themselves, in stern uprightness of character, in scorn of  the low and trivial, in lofty idealism. The art of all three is too  far above the common level to be popular; it requires too much  thinking to attract the superficial. In poetry, in music, and in  sculpture, all three utter the profoundest truths of human experience,  expressed in grand and solemn harmonies.          II. ON BOOKS OF REFERENCE.      The original materials for the study of Michelangelo's life and work  are the two biographies by his contemporaries, Vasari and Condivi.  Vasari's was the first of these (1550), and like the other portions of  his \"Lives of the Painters\" contained many inaccuracies. It was to  correct these that Condivi published his little book a few years  later. This rival effort aroused Vasari's wrath, and after  Michelangelo's death he issued an enlarged edition of his own book,  unscrupulously incorporating all that was valuable in Condivi's work,  and adding thereto many reminiscences of the master's life. The fame  of Vasari's monumental work caused Condivi's little book to be  entirely forgotten for long years, and it has been one of the tasks of  modern scholarship to restore it to its true place. Even now, however,  there is no available form of Condivi's biography for American  readers, though Vasari's \"Lives\" in Mrs. Foster's translation is found  in most libraries. The latest edition of Vasari, published in 1897,  contains annotations by Mr. and Mrs. E.H. Blashfield, and A.A.  Hopkins, which correct all the statements in the light of recent  authorities.    Far more valuable even than the early biographies is the mass of  existing documents of the Buonarotti family, including contracts,  letters, poems, and memoranda, and containing data for a full and  exact biography of the master. Unfortunately, however, this great  storehouse of material has been for all these centuries a sealed  treasure, given up only little by little, to successive generations of  scholars. When Hermann Grimm wrote his celebrated \"Life of Michael  Angelo\" (in 1860), the only original material accessible to him was  the collection of letters in the British Museum.

THE FUTURE OF ISLAM    BY    WILFRID SCAWEN BLUNT           \"La taknatu addurru yontharu akduhu       Liauda ahsana fin nithami wa ajmala.\"         \"Fear not. Often pearls are unstrung       To be put in better order.\"      _Published by permission of the Proprietors of the \"Fortnightly Review\"_    LONDON  KEGAN PAUL, TRENCH & CO., 1, PATERNOSTER SQUARE  1882          PREFACE.      These essays, written for the _Fortnightly Review_ in the summer and  autumn of 1881, were intended as first sketches only of a maturer work  which the author hoped, before giving finally to the public, to complete  at leisure, and develop in a form worthy of critical acceptance, and of  the great subject he had chosen. Events, however, have marched faster  than he at all anticipated, and it has become a matter of importance  with him that the idea they were designed to illustrate should be given  immediate and full publicity. The French, by their invasion of Tunis,  have precipitated the Mohammedan movement in North Africa; Egypt has  roused herself for a great effort of national and religious reform; and  on all sides Islam is seen to be convulsed by political portents of  ever-growing intensity. He believes that his countrymen will in a very  few months have to make their final choice in India, whether they will  lead or be led by the wave of religious energy which is sweeping  eastwards, and he conceives it of consequence that at least they should  know the main issues of the problem before them. To shut their eyes to  the great facts of contemporary history, because that history has no  immediate connection with their daily life, is a course unworthy of a  great nation; and in England, where the opinion of the people guides the  conduct of affairs, can hardly fail to bring disaster. It should be  remembered that the modern British Empire, an agglomeration of races  ruled by public opinion in a remote island, is an experiment new in the  history of the world, and needs justification in exceptional  enlightenment; and it must be remembered, too, that no empire ever yet  was governed without a living policy. The author, therefore, has  resolved to publish his work, crude as it is, without more delay, in the  hope that it may be instrumental in guiding the national choice. He is,  nevertheless, fully aware of its defects both in accuracy and  completeness, and he can only hope that they may be pardoned him in view  of the general truth of the picture he has drawn.    Since the last of these essays was written, their author has returned to  Egypt, and has there had the satisfaction of finding the ideas, vaguely  foreshadowed by him as the dream of some few liberal Ulema of the Azhar,  already a practical reality. Cairo has now declared itself as the home  of progressive thought in Islam, and its university as the once more  independent seat of Arabian theology. Secured from Turkish interference  by the national movement of the Arabs, the Ulema of the Azhar have  joined heart and soul with the party of reform. The importance of this  event can hardly be overrated; and if, as now seems probable, a liberal  Mohammedan Government by a free Mohammedan people should establish  itself firmly on the Nile, it is beyond question that the basis of a  social and political Reformation for all Islam has been laid. It is more  than all a hopeful sign that extreme moderation with regard to the  Caliphate is observed by the Egyptian leaders. Independence, not  opposition, is the motto of the party; and no rent has been made or is  contemplated by them in the orthodox coat of Islam. Abd el Hamid Khan is  still recognized as the actual Emir el Mumenin, and the restoration of a  more legitimate Caliphate is deferred for the day when its fate shall  have overtaken the Ottoman Empire. This is as it should be. Schism would  only weaken the cause of religion, already threatened by a thousand  enemies; and the premature appearance of an Anti-Caliph in Egypt or  Arabia, however legitimate a candidate he might be by birth for the  office, would divide the Mohammedan world into two hostile camps, and so  bring scandal and injury on the general cause. In the meantime, however,  liberal thought will have a fair field for its development, and can  hardly fail to extend its influence wherever the Arabic language is  spoken, and among all those races which look on the Azhar as the centre  of their intellectual life. This is a notable achievement, and one which  patience may turn, perhaps in a very few years, to a more general  triumph. There can be little doubt now that the death of Abd el Hamid,  or his fall from Empire, will be the signal for the return of the  Caliphate to Cairo, and a formal renewal there by the Arabian mind of  its lost religious leadership.    To Mohammedans the author owes more than a word of apology. A stranger  and a sojourner among them, he has ventured on an exposition of their  domestic griefs, and has occasionally touched the ark of their religion  with what will seem to them a profane hand; but his motive has been  throughout a pure one, and he trusts that they will pardon him in virtue  of the sympathy with them which must be apparent in every line that he  has written. He has predicted for them great political misfortunes in  the immediate future, because he believes that these are a necessary  step in the process of their spiritual development; but he has a supreme  confidence in Islam, not only as a spiritual, but as a temporal system  the heritage and gift of the Arabian race, and capable of satisfying  their most civilized wants; and he believes in the hour of their  political resurgence. In the meantime he is convinced that he serves  their interests best by speaking what he holds to be the truth regarding  their situation. Their day of empire has all but passed away, but there  remains to them a day of social independence better than empire.  Enlightened, reformed and united in sympathy, Mussulmans need not fear  political destruction in their original homes, Arabia, Egypt, and North  Africa; and these must suffice them as a Dar el Islam till better days  shall come. If the author can do anything to help them to preserve that  independence they may count upon him freely within the limits of his  strength, and he trusts to prove to them yet his sincerity in some  worthier way than by the publication of these first essays.

In the lull, which we hope is soon to break the storm of party strife in  England, it may not perhaps be impossible to direct public attention to  the rapid growth of questions which for the last few years have been  agitating the religious mind of Asia, and which are certain before long  to present themselves as a very serious perplexity to British statesmen;  questions, moreover, which if not dealt with by them betimes, it will  later be found out of their power to deal with at all, though a vigorous  policy at the present moment might yet solve them to this country's very  great advantage.    The revival which is taking place in the Mohammedan world is indeed  worthy of every Englishman's attention, and it is difficult to believe  that it has not received anxious consideration at the hands of those  whose official responsibility lies chiefly in the direction of Asia; but  I am not aware that it has hitherto been placed in its true light before  the English public, or that a quite definite policy regarding it may be  counted on as existing in the counsels of the present Cabinet. Indeed,  as regards the Cabinet, the reverse may very well be the case. We know  how suspicious English politicians are of policies which may be  denounced by their enemies as speculative; and it is quite possible that  the very magnitude of the problem to be solved in considering the future  of Islam may have caused it to be put aside there as one \"outside the  sphere of practical politics.\" The phrase is a convenient one, and is  much used by those in power amongst us who would evade the labour or the  responsibility of great decisions. Yet that such a problem exists in a  new and very serious form I do not hesitate to affirm, nor will my  proposition, as I think, be doubted by any who have mingled much in the  last few years with the Mussulman populations of Western Asia. There it  is easily discernible that great changes are impending, changes perhaps  analogous to those which Christendom underwent four hundred years ago,  and that a new departure is urgently demanded of England if she would  maintain even for a few years her position as the guide and arbiter of  Asiatic progress.    It was not altogether without the design of gaining more accurate  knowledge than I could find elsewhere on the subject of this Mohammedan  revival that I visited Jeddah in the early part of the past winter, and  that I subsequently spent some months in Egypt and Syria in the almost  exclusive society of Mussulmans. Jeddah, I argued, the seaport of Mecca  and only forty miles distant from that famous centre of the Moslem  universe, would be the most convenient spot from which I could obtain  such a bird's-eye view of Islam as I was in search of; and I imagined  rightly that I should there find myself in an atmosphere less provincial  than that of Cairo,"]]]
