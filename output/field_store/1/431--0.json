LOCATION AND CHARACTER.    The Casa Grande ruin, situated near Gila river, in southern Arizona, is  perhaps the best known specimen of aboriginal architecture in the United  States, and no treatise on American antiquities is complete without a  more or less extended description of it. Its literature, which extends  over two centuries, is voluminous, but of little value to the practical  scientific worker, since hardly two descriptions can be found which  agree. The variations in size of the ruin given by various authors is  astonishing, ranging from 1,500 square feet to nearly 5 acres or about  200,000 square feet in area. These extreme variations are doubtless due  to difference of judgment as to what portion of the area covered by  remains of walls should be assigned to the Casa Grande proper, for this  structure is but a portion of a large group of ruins.    So far as known to the writer no accurate plan of the Casa Grande ruin  proper has hitherto been made, although plans have been published; and  very few data concerning the group of which it forms a part are  available. It would seem, therefore, that a brief report presenting  accurate plans and careful descriptions may be of value, even though  no pretention to exhaustive treatment is made.      HISTORY AND LITERATURE.    The earlier writers on the Casa Grande generally state that it was in  ruins at the time of the first Spanish invasion of the country, in 1540,  and quote in support of this assertion Castaneda's description of a ruin  encountered on the march.[1] Castaneda remarks that, \"The structure  was in ruins and without a roof.\" Elsewhere he says that the name  \"Chichilticale\" was given to the place where they stopped because the  monks found in the vicinity a house which had been inhabited by a people  who came from Cibola. He surmises that the ruin was formerly a fortress,  destroyed long before by the barbarous tribes which they found in the  country. His description of these tribes seems to apply to the Apache.        [Footnote 1: Castaneda in Ternaux-Compans. Voyage de Cibola. French      text, p. 1, pp. 41, 161-162. (The original text--Spanish--is in the      Lenox Library; no English translation has yet been published.)]    The geographic data furnished by Castaneda and the other chroniclers of  Coronado's expedition is very scanty, and the exact route followed has  not yet been determined and probably never will be. So far as these data  go, however, they are against the assumption that the Chichilticale of  Castaneda is the Casa Grande of today. Mr. A. F. Bandelier, whose  studies of the documentary history of the southwest are well known,  inclines to the opinion that the vicinity of Old Camp Grant, on the Rio  San Pedro, Arizona, more nearly fill the descriptions. Be this as it  may, however, the work of Castaneda was lost to sight, and it is not  until more than a century later that the authentic history of the ruin  commences.    In 1694 the Jesuit Father Kino heard of the ruin, and later in the same  year visited it and said mass within its walls. His secretary and usual  companion on his missionary journeys, Mange by name, was not with him on  this occasion, but in 1697 another visit was paid to the ruin and the  description recorded by Mange[1] in his diary heads the long list of  accounts extending down to the present time.[2] Mange describes the ruin  as consisting of--      A large edifice, the principal room in the center being four stories    high, and those adjoining it on its four sides three stories, with    walls 2 varas thick, of strong argamaso y baro (adobe) so smooth on    the inside that they resemble planed boards, and so polished that    they shine like Puebla pottery.        [Footnote 1: An English translation is given by H. H. Bancroft,      Works, iv, p. 622, note. Also by Bartlett, Personal Narrative, 1854,      vol. ii, pp. 281-282; another was published by Schoolcraft, Hist.      Cond. and Pros. of Am. Ind., vol. iii, 1853, p. 301.]        [Footnote 2: Quite an extensive list is given by Bancroft      (op. cit., pp. 622-625, notes), and by Bandelier in Papers Arch.      Inst. of Amer., American series, i, p. 11, note.]    Mange also gives some details of construction, and states that in the  immediate vicinity there were remains of twelve other buildings, the  walls half fallen and the roofs burned out.    Following Mange's account there were a number of descriptions of no  special value, and a more useful one written by Padre Font, who in 1775  and 1776 made a journey to Gila and Colorado rivers and beyond. This  description[1] is quite circumstantial and is of especial interest  because it formed the basis of nearly all the accounts written up to the  time when that country came into our possession. According to this  authority--      The house forms an oblong square, facing exactly the four cardinal    points, and round about it there are ruins indicating a fence or    wall which surrounded the house and other buildings. The exterior or    plaza extends north and south 420 feet and east and west 260 feet.        [Footnote 1: A number of copies of Font's Journal are known.      Bancroft gives a partial translation in op. cit., p. 623, note, as      does also Bartlett (op. cit., pp. 278-280); and a French translation      is given by Ternaux Compans, ix, Voyages de Cibola, appendix.]    Font measured the five rooms of the main building, and recorded many  interesting details. It will be noticed that he described a surrounding  wall inclosing a comparatively large area; and nearly all the writers  who published accounts prior to our conquest of the country in 1846  based their descriptions on Font's journal and erroneously applied his  measurement of the supposed circumscribing wall to the Casa Grande  proper.    The conquest of the country by the \"Army of the West\" attracted  attention anew to the ruin, through the descriptions of Colonel Emory  and Captain Johnston. The expedition passed up the Gila valley, and  Colonel Emory, in his journal, gives a fanciful illustration and a  slight description. The journal of Captain Johnston contained a somewhat  better description and a rough but fairly good sketch. The best  description of that period, however, was that given by John Russell  Bartlett, in his \"Personal Narrative,\" published in 1854.    Bartlett observed that the ruin consists of three buildings, \"all  included within an area of 150 yards.\" He described these buildings and  gave ground plans of two of them and elevations of the principal  structure. He also gave a translation of a portion of Font's journal, as  well as the previous description of Mange. He surmised that the central  room of the main building, and perhaps the whole structure, was used for  the storage of corn.    Bartlett's account held place for nearly thirty years as the main  reliance of compilers, and it forms today one of the most circumstantial  and comprehensive descriptions extant. Other descriptions appeared at  intervals of a few years, some compiled from Bartlett and Font, others  based on personal observation, but none of them containing anything new,  until the account of Mr. A. F. Bandelier, published some ten years  ago,[1] is reached.        [Footnote 1: Archaeological Inst. of Amer., 5th Ann. Rep., 1884.]    Mr. Bandelier described the large group, of which the Casa Grande forms  a part, and gave its dimensions as 400 meters (1,300 feet) north and  south by 200 meters (650 feet) east and west. He also described and gave  measurements of the Casa Grande proper and discusses its place in the  field of aboriginal architecture. In a later publication[1] he discussed  the ruin at somewhat greater length, and presented also a rough sketch  plan of the group and ground plans of the Casa Grande and of the mound  north of it. He gave a short history of the ruin and quite an extended  account of the Pima traditions concerning it. He considered the Casa  Grande a stronghold or fortress, a place of last resort, the  counterpart, functionally, of the blockhouse of the early settlers of  eastern United States.

This amount was  insufficient for complete restoration, but under the authority of the  act of Congress making the appropriation some work was done. Partly as  an aid to further possible work, and partly that there may be an  available record of what has been done for the benefit of future  students of American archeology, this report is presented.    A full description of Casa Grande has been given by the writer in a  published memoir[1] on that ruin, hence only a brief account will now be  necessary to aid in making the present report intelligible. Following  this description is a statement of the condition of the ruin in 1891 and  of the plans formed for its repair, the latter being necessarily  controlled by the amount appropriated. After this there is an account of  the work done, from the passage of the bill until the delivery of the  work to the agent of the United States who received it, and of the  reservation, of an area of land about the ruin by order of the  President. This is followed by a catalogue of the articles found during  the excavations in and about the ruin, which were subsequently deposited  in the National Museum; a transcript of the contract under which the  work was done, including specifications, plans, and sections, and the  report of Mr H. C. Rizer, who inspected and received the work. Finally,  there are appended the correspondence and report relating to the  condition of Casa Grande in 1895, with recommendations concerning its  further protection.        [Footnote 1: Thirteenth Annual Report of the Bureau of Ethnology,      p. 289 et seq.]    Casa Grande has occupied a very important place in the literature of  American archeology, a place which it doubtless will continue to occupy;  and as dates are frequently of importance an effort has been made to  make the present report as full as possible in that respect.      DESCRIPTION OF THE RUINS    Casa Grande appears to be the sole surviving remnant of an extensive and  important class of remains in the southwest. These remains occur usually  in large groups or clusters, and Casa Grande is no exception. The name  has been ordinarily applied to a single house structure standing near  the southwestern corner of a large area covered by mounds and other  debris; but some writers have applied the term to the southwestern  portion of the area, others to the whole area.    Probably no two investigators would assign exactly the same limits to  this area, as its margins merge imperceptibly into the surrounding  country. The accompanying map (plate CXII) shows the limits of the ruins  as interpreted by the writer. The surface covered by well-defined  remains, as there shown, extends about 1,800 feet north and south and  1,500 feet east and west, or a total area of about 65 acres.    Casa Grande ruin occupies a position near the southwestern corner of the  group, and its size is insignificant as compared with the entire cluster  of ruins, or even with the remains of the large structure which occupied  the north-central part of the area. The contour interval on the map is 1  foot, sufficiently small to show much surface detail. The depressions  are indicated by dotted contours.    Within the area shown on the map there are a large number of mounds,  more or less leveled by long-continued exposure to the elements. Some  appear to be quite old, others represent buildings which were standing  within the historic period, and many interesting features are presented  which can not even be alluded to here.    Casa Grande proper was one of the smallest of the house clusters, but it  is unique in that the walls are still standing to a height of more than  25 feet. While fragments of standing wall are not uncommon, either in  the area mentioned or in the valleys of Gala and Salt rivers generally,  no other example exists, so far as known, so well preserved as the one  under consideration.    For miles around Casa Grande the ground surface is so flat that from the  summit of the walls an immense stretch of country is brought under view  in every direction.
