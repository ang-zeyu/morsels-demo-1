TO    THE RIGHT HONOURABLE LORD ELCHO,    IN GRATITUDE    FOR MANY SEASONS OF EXCELLENT SPORT WITH HIS HOUNDS,    ON THE BORDER.    THIS VOLUME IS INSCRIBED,    BY HIS    OBLIGED AND FAITHFUL SERVANT,    THE AUTHOR.          PREFACE      The author gladly avails himself of the convenience of a Preface for  stating, that it will be seen at the close of the work why he makes such a  characterless character as Mr. Sponge the hero of his tale.    He will be glad if it serves to put the rising generation on their guard  against specious, promiscuous acquaintance, and trains them on to the noble  sport of hunting, to the exclusion of its mercenary, illegitimate  off-shoots.    _November 1852_          CHAPTER I    OUR HERO      [Illustration]    It was a murky October day that the hero of our tale, Mr. Sponge, or Soapey  Sponge, as his good-natured friends call him, was seen mizzling along  Oxford Street, wending his way to the West. Not that there was anything  unusual in Sponge being seen in Oxford Street, for when in town his daily  perambulations consist of a circuit, commencing from the Bantam Hotel in  Bond Street into Piccadilly, through Leicester Square, and so on to  Aldridge's, in St. Martin's Lane, thence by Moore's sporting-print shop,  and on through some of those ambiguous and tortuous streets that, appearing  to lead all ways at once and none in particular, land the explorer, sooner  or later, on the south side of Oxford Street.    Oxford Street acts to the north part of London what the Strand does to the  south: it is sure to bring one up, sooner or later. A man can hardly get  over either of them without knowing it. Well, Soapey having got into Oxford  Street, would make his way at a squarey, in-kneed, duck-toed, sort of pace,  regulated by the bonnets, the vehicles, and the equestrians he met to  criticize; for of women, vehicles, and horses, he had voted himself a  consummate judge. Indeed, he had fully established in his own mind that  Kiddey Downey and he were the only men in London who _really_ knew anything  about, horses, and fully impressed with that conviction, he would halt, and  stand, and stare, in a way that with any other man would have been  considered impertinent. Perhaps it was impertinent in Soapey--we don't mean  to say it wasn't--but he had done it so long, and was of so sporting a gait  and cut, that he felt himself somewhat privileged. Moreover, the majority  of horsemen are so satisfied with the animals they bestride, that they cock  up their jibs and ride along with a 'find any fault with either me or my  horse, if you can' sort of air.    Thus Mr. Sponge proceeded leisurely along, now nodding to this man, now  jerking his elbow to that, now smiling on a phaeton, now sneering at a  'bus. If he did not look in at Shackell's or Bartley's, or any of the  dealers on the line, he was always to be found about half-past five at  Cumberland Gate, from whence he would strike leisurely down the Park, and  after coming to a long check at Rotten Row rails, from whence he would pass  all the cavalry in the Park in review, he would wend his way back to the  Bantam, much in the style he had come. This was his summer proceeding.    Mr. Sponge had pursued this enterprising life for some 'seasons'--ten at  least--and supposing him to have begun at twenty or one-and-twenty, he  would be about thirty at the time we have the pleasure of introducing him  to our readers--a period of life at which men begin to suspect they were  not quite so wise at twenty as they thought. Not that Mr. Sponge had any  particular indiscretions to reflect upon, for he was tolerably sharp, but  he felt that he might have made better use of his time, which may be  shortly described as having been spent in hunting all the winter, and in  talking about it all the summer. With this popular sport he combined the  diversion of fortune-hunting, though we are concerned to say that his  success, up to the period of our introduction, had not been commensurate  with his deserts. Let us, however, hope that brighter days are about to  dawn upon him.    Having now introduced our hero to our male and female friends, under his  interesting pursuits of fox and fortune-hunter, it becomes us to say a few  words as to his qualifications for carrying them on.    Mr. Sponge was a good-looking, rather vulgar-looking man. At a  distance--say ten yards--his height, figure, and carriage gave him somewhat  of a commanding appearance, but this was rather marred by a jerky, twitchy,  uneasy sort of air, that too plainly showed he was not the natural, or what  the lower orders call the _real_ gentleman. Not that Sponge was shy. Far  from it. He never hesitated about offering to a lady after a three days'  acquaintance, or in asking a gentleman to take him a horse in over-night,  with whom he might chance to come in contact in the hunting-field. And he  did it all in such a cool, off-hand, matter-of-course sort of way, that  people who would have stared with astonishment if anybody else had hinted  at such a proposal, really seemed to come into the humour and spirit of the  thing, and to look upon it rather as a matter of course than otherwise.  Then his dexterity in getting into people's houses was only equalled by the  difficulty of getting him out again, but this we must waive for the present  in favour of his portraiture.    In height, Mr. Sponge was above the middle size--five feet eleven or  so--with a well borne up, not badly shaped, closely cropped oval head, a  tolerably good, but somewhat receding forehead, bright hazel eyes, Roman  nose, with carefully tended whiskers, reaching the corners of a well-formed  mouth, and thence descending in semicircles into a vast expanse of hair  beneath the chin.    Having mentioned Mr. Sponge's groomy gait and horsey propensities, it were  almost needless to say that his dress was in the sporting style--you saw  what he was by his clothes. Every article seemed to be made to defy the  utmost rigour of the elements. His hat (Lincoln and Bennett) was hard and  heavy. It sounded upon an entrance-hall table like a drum. A little magical  loop in the lining explained the cause of its weight. Somehow, his hats  were never either old or new--not that he bought them second-hand, but  when he got a new one he took its 'long-coat' off, as he called it, with a  singeing lamp, and made it look as if it had undergone a few probationary  showers.    When a good London hat recedes to a certain point, it gets no worse; it is  not like a country-made thing that keeps going and going until it declines  into a thing with no sort of resemblance to its original self. Barring its  weight and hardness, the Sponge hat had no particular character apart from  the Sponge head. It was not one of those punty ovals or Cheshire-cheese  flats, or curly-sided things that enables one to say who is in a house and  who is not, by a glance at the hats in the entrance, but it was just a  quiet, round hat, without anything remarkable, either in the binding, the  lining, or the band, but still it was a very becoming hat when Sponge had  it on. There is a great deal of character in hats. We have seen hats that  bring the owners to the recollection far more forcibly than the generality  of portraits. But to our hero.    That there may be a dandified simplicity in dress, is exemplified every day  by our friends the Quakers, who adorn their beautiful brown Saxony coats  with little inside velvet collars and fancy silk buttons, and even the  severe order of sporting costume adopted by our friend Mr. Sponge is not  devoid of capability in the way of tasteful adaptation. This Mr. Sponge  chiefly showed in promoting a resemblance between his neck-cloths and  waistcoats. Thus, if he wore a cream-coloured cravat, he would have a  buff-coloured waistcoat, if a striped waistcoat, then the starcher would be  imbued with somewhat of the same colour and pattern. The ties of these  varied with their texture. The silk ones terminated in a sort of coaching  fold, and were secured by a golden fox-head pin, while the striped  starchers, with the aid of a pin on each side, just made a neat,  unpretending tie in the middle, a sort of miniature of the flagrant,  flyaway, Mile-End ones of aspiring youth of the present day. His coats were  of the single-breasted cut-away order, with pockets outside, and generally  either Oxford mixture or some dark colour, that required you to place him  in a favourable light to say what it was.    His waistcoats, of course, were of the most correct form and material,  generally either pale buff, or buff with a narrow stripe, similar to the  undress vests of the servants of the Royal Family, only with the pattern  run across instead of lengthways, as those worthies mostly have theirs, and  made with good honest step collars, instead of the make-believe roll  collars they sometimes convert their upright ones into. When in deep  thought, calculating, perhaps, the value of a passing horse, or considering  whether he should have beefsteaks or lamb chops for dinner, Sponge's thumbs  would rest in the arm-holes of his waistcoat; in which easy, but not very  elegant, attitude he would sometimes stand until all trace of the idea that  elevated them had passed away from his mind.    In the trouser line he adhered to the close-fitting costume of former days;  and many were the trials, the easings, and the alterings, ere he got a pair  exactly to his mind. Many were the customers who turned away on seeing his  manly figure filling the swing mirror in 'Snip and Sneiders',' a monopoly  that some tradesmen might object to, only Mr. Sponge's trousers being  admitted to be"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16960"],[0,"History of the United States (#1)"],[1,"Team at https://www.pgdp.net                HISTORY    OF THE    UNITED STATES      BY      CHARLES A.

PREFACE      As things now stand, the course of instruction in American history in  our public schools embraces three distinct treatments of the subject.  Three separate books are used. First, there is the primary book, which  is usually a very condensed narrative with emphasis on biographies and  anecdotes. Second, there is the advanced text for the seventh or eighth  grade, generally speaking, an expansion of the elementary book by the  addition of forty or fifty thousand words. Finally, there is the high  school manual. This, too, ordinarily follows the beaten path, giving  fuller accounts of the same events and characters. To put it bluntly, we  do not assume that our children obtain permanent possessions from their  study of history in the lower grades. If mathematicians followed the  same method, high school texts on algebra and geometry would include the  multiplication table and fractions.    There is, of course, a ready answer to the criticism advanced above. It  is that teachers have learned from bitter experience how little history  their pupils retain as they pass along the regular route. No teacher of  history will deny this. Still it is a standing challenge to existing  methods of historical instruction. If the study of history cannot be  made truly progressive like the study of mathematics, science, and  languages, then the historians assume a grave responsibility in adding  their subject to the already overloaded curriculum. If the successive  historical texts are only enlarged editions of the first text--more  facts, more dates, more words--then history deserves most of the sharp  criticism which it is receiving from teachers of science, civics, and  economics.    In this condition of affairs we find our justification for offering a  new high school text in American history. Our first contribution is one  of omission. The time-honored stories of exploration and the  biographies of heroes are left out. We frankly hold that, if pupils know  little or nothing about Columbus, Cortes, Magellan, or Captain John  Smith by the time they reach the high school, it is useless to tell the  same stories for perhaps the fourth time. It is worse than useless. It  is an offense against the teachers of those subjects that are  demonstrated to be progressive in character.    In the next place we have omitted all descriptions of battles. Our  reasons for this are simple. The strategy of a campaign or of a single  battle is a highly technical, and usually a highly controversial, matter  about which experts differ widely. In the field of military and naval  operations most writers and teachers of history are mere novices. To  dispose of Gettysburg or the Wilderness in ten lines or ten pages is  equally absurd to the serious student of military affairs. Any one who  compares the ordinary textbook account of a single Civil War campaign  with the account given by Ropes, for instance, will ask for no further  comment. No youth called upon to serve our country in arms would think  of turning to a high school manual for information about the art of  warfare. The dramatic scene or episode, so useful in arousing the  interest of the immature pupil, seems out of place in a book that  deliberately appeals to boys and girls on the very threshold of life's  serious responsibilities.    It is not upon negative features, however, that we rest our case. It is  rather upon constructive features.    _First._ We have written a topical, not a narrative, history. We have  tried to set forth the important aspects, problems, and movements of  each period, bringing in the narrative rather by way of illustration.    _Second._ We have emphasized those historical topics which help to  explain how our nation has come to be what it is to-day.    _Third._ We have dwelt fully upon the social and economic aspects of our  history, especially in relation to the politics of each period.    _Fourth._ We have treated the causes and results of wars, the problems  of financing and sustaining armed forces, rather than military strategy.  These are the subjects which belong to a history for civilians. These  are matters which civilians can understand--matters which they must  understand, if they are to play well their part in war and peace.    _Fifth._ By omitting the period of exploration, we have been able to  enlarge the treatment of our own time. We have given special attention  to the history of those current questions which must form the subject  matter of sound instruction in citizenship.    _Sixth._ We have borne in mind that America, with all her unique  characteristics, is a part of a general civilization. Accordingly we  have given diplomacy, foreign affairs, world relations, and the  reciprocal influences of nations their appropriate place.    _Seventh._ We have deliberately aimed at standards of maturity. The  study of a mere narrative calls mainly for the use of the memory. We  have aimed to stimulate habits of analysis, comparison, association,  reflection, and generalization--habits calculated to enlarge as well as  inform the mind. We have been at great pains to make our text clear,  simple, and direct; but we have earnestly sought to stretch the  intellects of our readers--to put them upon their mettle. Most of them  will receive the last of their formal instruction in the high school.  The world will soon expect maturity from them. Their achievements will  depend upon the possession of other powers than memory alone. The  effectiveness of their citizenship in our republic will be measured by  the excellence of their judgment as well as the fullness of their  information.         C.A.B.       M.R.B.
