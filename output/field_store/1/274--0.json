Publishers of \"The Parents' Magazine\"    1905                [Illustration: \"A thousand fantasies begin to throng\"]          INTRODUCTION TO    \"FAIRIES EVERY CHILD SHOULD KNOW\"      The fairy tale is a poetic recording of the facts of life, an  interpretation by the imagination of its hard conditions, an effort to  reconcile the spirit which loves freedom and goodness and beauty with  its harsh, bare and disappointing conditions. It is, in its earliest  form, a spontaneous and instinctive endeavor to shape the facts of the  world to meet the needs of the imagination, the cravings of the heart.  It involves a free, poetic dealing with realities in accordance with the  law of mental growth; it is the naive activity of the young imagination  of the race, untrammelled by the necessity of rigid adherence to the  fact.    The myths record the earliest attempt at an explanation of the world and  its life; the fairy tale records the free and joyful play of the  imagination, opening doors through hard conditions to the spirit, which  craves power, freedom, happiness; righting wrongs and redressing  injuries; defeating base designs; rewarding patience and virtue;  crowning true love with happiness; placing the powers of darkness under  control of man and making their ministers his servants. In the fairy  story, men are not set entirely free from their limitations, but, by the  aid of fairies, genii, giants and demons, they are put in command of  unusual powers and make themselves masters of the forces of nature.    The oldest fairy stories constitute a fascinating introduction to the  book of modern science, curiously predicting its discoveries, its  uncovering of the resources of the earth and air, its growing control of  the tremendous forces which work in earth and air. And it is significant  that the recent progress of science is steadily toward what our  ancestors would have considered fairy land; for in all the imaginings of  the childhood of the race there was nothing more marvellous or more  audaciously improbable than the transmission of the accents and  modulations of familiar voices through long distances, and the power of  communication across leagues of sea without mechanical connections of  any kind.    The faculty which created the fairy tale is the same faculty which,  supplemented by a broader observation and based on more accurate  knowledge, has broadened the range and activities of modern man, made  the world accessible to him, enabled him to live in one place but to  speak and act in places thousands of miles distant, given him command of  colossal forces, and is fast making him rich on a scale which would have  seemed incredible to men of a half-century ago. There is nothing in any  fairy tale more marvellous and inherently improbable than many of the  achievements of scientific observation and invention, and we are only at  the beginning of the wonders that lie within the reach of the human  spirit!    No one can understand the modern world without the aid of the  imagination, and as the frontiers of knowledge are pushed still further  away from the obvious and familiar, there will be an increasing tax on  the imagination. The world of dead matter which our fathers thought they  understood has become a world of subtle forces moving with inconceivable  velocity; nothing is inert, all things are transformed into other and  more elusive shapes precisely as the makers of the fairy tales foresaw  and predicted; the world lives in every atom just as their world lived;  forces lie just outside the range of physical sight, but entirely within  the range of spiritual vision, precisely as the tellers of these old  stories divined; mystery and wonder enfold all things, and not only  evoke the full play of the mind, but flood it with intimations and  suggestions of the presence of more elusive and subtle forces, of finer  and more obedient powers, as the world of fairies, magi and demons  enfolded the ancient earth of daily toil and danger.    In a word, the fairy stories have come true; they are historical in the  sense that they faithfully report a stage of spiritual growth and  predict a higher order of realities through a deeper knowledge of  actualities. They were poetic renderings of facts which science is fast  verifying, chiefly by the use of the same faculty which enriched early  literature with the myth and the fairy tale. The scientist has turned  poet in these later days, and the imagination which once expressed  itself in a free handling of facts so as to make them answer the needs  and demands of the human spirit, now expresses itself in that breadth of  vision which reconstructs an extinct animal from a bone and analyzes the  light of a sun flaming on the outermost boundaries of space.    This collection of tales, gathered from the rich literature of the  childhood of the world, or from the books of the few modern men who have  found the key of that wonderful world, is put forth not only without  apology, but with the hope that it may widen the demand for these  charming reports of a world in which the truths of our working world are  loyally upheld, while its hard facts are quietly but authoritatively  dismissed from attention. The widest interpretation has been given to  the fairy tale, so as to include many of those classic romances of  childhood in which no fairy appears, but which are invested with the air  and are permeated with the glorious freedom of fairy land.    No sane man or woman undervalues the immense gains of the modern world  in the knowledge of facts and the application of ideas to things in  order to secure comfort, health, access to the treasure in the earth and  on its surface, the means of education and greater freedom from the  tyranny of toil by the accumulation of the fruits of toil; but no sane  man or woman believes that a mechanical age is other than a transitional  age, that the possession of things is the final achievement of society,  and that in multiplication of conveniences civilization will reach its  point of culmination.    We are so engrossed in getting rich that we forget that by and by, when  we have become rich, we shall have to learn how to live; for work can  never be an end in itself; it is a \"means of grace\" when it is not  drudgery; and it must, in the long run, be a preparation for play. For  play is not organized idleness, frivolity set in a fanciful order; it is  the normal, spontaneous exercise of physical activity, the wholesome  gayety of the mind, the natural expression of the spirit, without  self-consciousness, constraint, or the tyranny of hours and tasks. It is  the highest form of energy, because it is free and creative; a joy in  itself, and therefore a joy in the world. This is the explanation of the  sense of freedom and elation which come from a great work of art; it is  the instinctive perception of the fact that while immense toil lies  behind the artist's skill, the soul of the creation came from beyond the  world of work and the making of it was a bit of play. The man of  creative spirit is often a tireless worker, but in his happiest hours he  is at play; for all work, when it rises into freedom and power, is play.  \"We work,\" wrote a Greek thinker of the most creative people who have  yet appeared, \"in order that we may have leisure.\" The note of that life  was freedom; its activity was not \"evoked by external needs, but was  free, spontaneous and delightful; an ordered energy which stimulates all  the vital and mental powers.\"    Robert Louis Stevenson, who knew well how to touch work with the spirit  and charm of play, reports of certain evenings spent at a clubhouse near  Brussels, that the men who gathered there \"were employed over the  frivolous mercantile concerns of Belgium during the day; but in the  evening they found some hours for the serious concerns of life.\" They  gave their days to commerce, but their evenings were devoted to more  important interests!    These words are written for those older people who have made the mistake  of straying away from childhood; children do not read introductions,  because they know that the valuable part of the book is to be found in  the later pages. They read the stories; their elders read the  introduction as well. They both need the stuff of imagination, of which  myths, legends, and fairy tales are made. So much may be said of these  old stories that it is a serious question where to begin, and a still  more difficult question where to end. For these tales are the first  outpourings of that spring of imagination whence flow the most  illuminating, inspiring, refreshing and captivating thoughts and ideas  about life. No philosophy is deeper than that which underlies these  stories; no psychology is more important than that which finds its  choicest illustration in them; no chapter in the history of thought is  more suggestive and engrossing than that which records their growth and  divines their meaning. Fairy tales and myths are so much akin that they  are easily transformed and exchange costumes without changing character;  while the legend, which belongs to a later period, often reflects the  large meaning of the myth and the free fancy of the fairy tale.    As a class, children not only possess the faculty of imagination, but  are very largely occupied with it during the most sensitive and  formative years, and those who lack it are brought under its spell by  their fellows. They do not accurately distinguish between the actual and  the imaginary, and they live at ease in a world out of which paths run  in every direction into wonderland. They begin their education when they  begin to play; for play not only affords an outlet for their energy, and  so supplies one great means of growth"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1493"],[0,"The Legends of the Jews — Volume 1 (#1)"],[1,"by Charles Keller with OmniPage Professional OCR software            The Legends of the Jews Volume 1, by Louis Ginzberg            Footnote numbers have been indicated but footnotes are not  included in this etext.

THE LEGENDS OF THE JEWS    BY LOUIS GINZBERG      TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN MANUSCRIPT BY    HENRIETTA SZOLD      VOLUME I      BIBLE TIMES AND CHARACTERS    FROM THE CREATION TO JACOB          TO MY BROTHER ASHER      PREFACE         Was sich nie und nirgends hat        begeben, das allein veraltet nie.      The term Rabbinic was applied to the Jewish Literature of  post-Biblical times by those who conceived the Judaism of the  later epoch to be something different from the Judaism of the  Bible, something actually opposed to it. Such observers held that  the Jewish nation ceased to exist with the moment when its  political independence was destroyed. For them the Judaism of the  later epoch has been a Judaism of the Synagogue, the spokesmen of  which have been the scholars, the Rabbis. And what this phase of  Judaism brought forth has been considered by them to be the  product of the schools rather than the product of practical,  pulsating life. Poetic phantasmagoria, frequently the vaporings  of morbid visionaries, is the material out of which these  scholars construct the theologic system of the Rabbis, and fairy  tales, the spontaneous creations of the people, which take the  form of sacred legend in Jewish literature, are denominated the  Scriptural exegesis of the Rabbis, and condemned incontinently as  nugae rabbinorum.    As the name of a man clings to him, so men cling to names. For  the primitive savage the name is part of the essence of a person  or thing, and even in the more advanced stages of culture,  judgments are not always formed in agreement with facts as they  are, but rather according to the names by which they are called.  The current estimate of Rabbinic Literature is a case in point.  With the label Rabbinic later ages inherited from former ages a  certain distorted view of the literature so designated. To this  day, and even among scholars that approach its investigation with  unprejudiced minds, the opinion prevails that it is purely a  learned product. And yet the truth is that the most prominent  feature of Rabbinic Literature is its popular character.    The school and the home are not mutually opposed to each other in  the conception of the Jews. They study in their homes, and they  live in their schools. Likewise there is no distinct class of  scholars among them, a class that withdraws itself from  participation in the affairs of practical life. Even in the  domain of the Halakah, the Rabbis were not so much occupied with  theoretic principles of law as with the concrete phenomena of  daily existence. These they sought to grasp and shape. And what  is true of the Halakah is true with greater emphasis of the  Haggadah, which is popular in the double sense of appealing to  the people and being produced in the main by the people. To speak  of the Haggadah of the Tannaim and Amoraim is as far from fact as  to speak of the legends of Shakespeare and Scott. The ancient  authors and their modern brethren of the guild alike elaborate  legendary material which they found at hand.    It has been held by some that the Haggadah contains no popular  legends, that it is wholly a factitious, academic product. A  cursory glance at the pseudepigraphic literature of the Jews,  which is older than the Haggadah literature by several centuries,  shows how untenable this view is. That the one literature should  have drawn from the other is precluded by historical facts. At a  very early time the Synagogue disavowed the pseudepigraphic  literature, which was the favorite reading matter of the  sectaries and the Christians. Nevertheless the inner relation  between them is of the closest kind. The only essential  difference is that the Midrashic form prevails in the Haggadah,  and the parenetic or apocalyptic form in the pseudepigrapha. The  common element must therefore depart from the Midrash on the one  hand and from parenesis on the other.    Folklore, fairy tales, legends, and all forms of story telling  akin to these are comprehended, in the terminology of the  post-Biblical literature of the Jews, under the inclusive  description Haggadah, a name that can be explained by a  circumlocution, but cannot be translated. Whatever it is applied  to is thereby characterized first as being derived from the Holy  Scriptures, and then as being of the nature of a story. And, in  point of fact, this dualism sums up the distinguishing features  of Jewish Legend. More than eighteen centuries ago the Jewish  historian Josephus observed that \"though we be deprived of our  wealth, of our cities, or of the other advantages we have, our  law continues immortal.\" The word he meant to use was not law,  but Torah, only he could not find an equivalent for it in Greek.  A singer of the Synagogue a thousand years after Josephus, who  expressed his sentiments in Hebrew, uttered the same thought:  \"The Holy City and all her daughter cities are violated, they lie  in ruins, despoiled of their ornaments, their splendor darkened  from sight. Naught is left to us save one eternal treasure  alone--the Holy Torah.\" The sadder the life of the Jewish people,  the more it felt the need of taking refuge in its past. The  Scripture, or, to use the Jewish term, the Torah, was the only  remnant of its former national independence, and the Torah was  the magic means of making a sordid actuality recede before a  glorious memory. To the Scripture was assigned the task of  supplying nourishment to the mind as well as the soul, to the  intellect as well as the imagination, and the result is the  Halakah and the Haggadah.    The fancy of the people did not die out in the post-Biblical  time, but the bent of its activity was determined by the past.    Men craved entertainment in later times as well as in the  earlier, only instead of resorting for its subject-matter to what  happened under their eyes, they drew from the fountain-head of  the past. The events in the ancient history of Israel, which was  not only studied, but lived over again daily, stimulated the  desire to criticize it. The religious reflections upon nature  laid down in the myths of the people, the fairy tales, which have  the sole object of pleasing, and the legends, which are the  people's verdict upon history--all these were welded into one  product. The fancy of the Jewish people was engaged by the past  reflected in the Bible, and all its creations wear a Biblical hue  for this reason. This explains the peculiar form of the Haggadah.    But what is spontaneously brought forth by the people is often  preserved only in the form impressed upon it by the feeling and  the thought of the poet, or by the speculations of the learned.  Also Jewish legends have rarely been transmitted in their  original shape. They have been perpetuated in the form of  Midrash, that is, Scriptural exegesis. The teachers of the  Haggadah, called Rabbanan d'Aggadta in the Talmud, were no  folklorists, from whom a faithful reproduction of legendary  material may be expected. Primarily they were homilists, who used  legends for didactic purposes, and their main object was to  establish a close connection between the Scripture and the  creations of the popular fancy, to give the latter a firm basis  and secure a long term of life for them.    One of the most important tasks of the modern investigation of  the Haggadah is to make a clean separation between the original  elements and the later learned additions. Hardly a beginning has  been made in this direction. But as long as the task of  distinguishing them has not been accomplished, it is impossible  to write out the Biblical legends of the Jews without including  the supplemental work of scholars in the products of the popular  fancy.    In the present work, \"The Legends of the Jews,\" I have made the  first attempt to gather from the original sources all Jewish  legends, in so far as they refer to Biblical personages and  events, and reproduce them with the greatest attainable  completeness and accuracy. I use the expression Jewish, rather  than Rabbinic, because the sources from which I have levied  contributions are not limited to the Rabbinic literature. As I  expect to take occasion elsewhere to enter into a description of  the sources in detail, the following data must suffice for the  present.    The works of the Talmudic Midrashic literature are of the first  importance. Covering the period from the second to the fourteenth  century, they contain the major part of the Jewish legendary  material. Akin to this in content if not always in form is that  derived from the Targumim, of which the oldest versions were  produced not earlier than the fourth century, and the most recent  not later than the tenth. The Midrashic literature has been  preserved only in fragmentary form. Many Haggadot not found in  our existing collections are quoted by the authors of the Middle  Ages. Accordingly, a not inconsiderable number of the legends  here printed are taken from medieval Bible commentators and  homilists. I was fortunate in being able to avail myself also of  fragments of Midrashim of which only manuscript copies are  extant.    The works of the older Kabbalah are likewise treasuries of  quotations from lost Midrashim, and it was among the Kabbalists,  and later among the Hasidim, that new legends arose. The  literatures produced in these two circles are therefore of great  importance for the present purpose.    Furthermore, Jewish legends can be culled not from the writings  of the Synagogue alone; they appear also in those of the Church.  Certain Jewish works repudiated by the Synagogue were accepted  and mothered by the "]]]
