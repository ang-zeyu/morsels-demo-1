CHARLES THE FIRST.      Of his romantic excursion into Spain for the Infanta, many curious  particulars are scattered amongst foreign writers, which display the  superstitious prejudices which prevailed on this occasion, and, perhaps,  develope the mysterious politics of the courts of Spain and Rome.    Cardinal Gaetano, who had long been nuncio in Spain, observes, that the  people, accustomed to revere the Inquisition as the oracle of divinity,  abhorred the proposal of the marriage of the Infanta with an heretical  prince; but that the king's council, and all wise politicians, were  desirous of its accomplishment. Gregory XV. held a consultation of  cardinals, where it was agreed that the just apprehension which the  English catholics entertained of being more cruelly persecuted, if this  marriage failed, was a sufficient reason to justify the pope. The  dispensation was therefore immediately granted, and sent to the nuncio  of Spain, with orders to inform the Prince of Wales, in case of rupture,  that no impediment of the marriage proceeded from the court of Rome,  who, on the contrary, had expedited the dispensation.    The prince's excursion to Madrid was, however, universally blamed, as  being inimical to state interests. Nani, author of a history of Venice,  which, according to his digressive manner, is the universal history of  his times, has noticed this affair. \"The people talked, and the English  murmured more than any other nation, to see the only son of the king and  heir of his realms venture on so long a voyage, and present himself  rather as a hostage, than a husband to a foreign court, which so widely  differed in government and religion, to obtain by force of prayer and  supplications a woman whom Philip and his ministers made a point of  honour and conscience to refuse.\"[1]    Houssaie observes, \"The English council were against it, but king James  obstinately resolved on it; being over-persuaded by Gondomar, the  Spanish ambassador, whose facetious humour and lively repartees greatly  delighted him. Gondomar persuaded him that the presence of the prince  would not fail of accomplishing this union, and also the restitution of  the electorate to his son-in-law the palatine. Add to this, the Earl of  Bristol, the English ambassador-extraordinary at the court of Madrid,  finding it his interest, wrote repeatedly to his majesty that the  success was certain if the prince came there, for that the Infanta would  be charmed with his personal appearance and polished manners. It was  thus that James, seduced by these two ambassadors, and by his parental  affection for both his children, permitted the Prince of Wales to travel  into Spain.\" This account differs from Clarendon.    Wicquefort says, \"that James in all this was the dupe of Gondomar, who  well knew the impossibility of this marriage, which was alike inimical  to the interests of politics and the Inquisition. For a long time he  amused his majesty with hopes, and even got money for the household  expenses of the future queen. He acted his part so well, that the King  of Spain recompensed the knave, on his return, with a seat in the  council of state.\" There is preserved in the British Museum a  considerable series of letters which passed between James I. and the  Duke of Buckingham and Charles, during their residence in Spain.    I shall glean some further particulars concerning this mysterious affair  from two English contemporaries, Howel and Wilson, who wrote from their  own observations. Howel had been employed in this projected match, and  resided during its negotiation at Madrid.    Howel describes the first interview of Prince Charles and the Infanta.  \"The Infanta wore a blue riband about her arm, that the prince might  distinguish her, and as soon as she saw the prince her colour rose very  high.\"--Wilson informs us that \"two days after this interview the prince  was invited to run at the ring, where his fair mistress was a spectator,  and to the glory of his fortune, and the great contentment both of  himself and the lookers-on, he took the ring the very first course.\"  Howel, writing from Madrid, says, \"The people here do mightily magnify  the gallantry of the journey, and cry out that he deserved to have the  Infanta thrown into his arms the first night he came.\" The people  appear, however, some time after, to doubt if the English had any  religion at all. Again, \"I have seen the prince have his eyes immovably  fixed upon the Infanta half an hour together in a thoughtful speculative  posture.\" Olivares, who was no friend to this match, coarsely observed  that the prince watched her as a cat does a mouse. Charles indeed acted  everything that a lover in one of the old romances could have done.[2]  He once leapt over the walls of her garden, and only retired by the  entreaties of the old marquis who then guarded her, and who, falling on  his knees, solemnly protested that if the prince spoke to her his head  would answer for it. He watched hours in the street to meet with her;  and Wilson says he gave such liberal presents to the court, as well as  Buckingham to the Spanish beauties, that the Lord Treasurer Middlesex  complained repeatedly of their wasteful prodigality.[3]    Let us now observe by what mode this match was consented to by the  courts of Spain and Rome. Wilson informs us that Charles agreed \"That  any one should freely propose to _him_ the arguments in favour of the  catholic religion, without giving any impediment; but that he would  never, directly or indirectly, permit any one to speak to the _Infanta_  against the same.\" They probably had tampered with Charles concerning  his religion.

SCHMIDT    COPYRIGHT, 1912, BY ARTHUR P. SCHMIDT    A.P.S. 9384    Stanhope Press    F.H. GILSON COMPANY  BOSTON, U.S.A.          PREFACE      The present work places before the public a phase of the  professional activity of Edward MacDowell quite different from  that through which his name became a household word in musical  circles, that is, his work as a composer. In the chapters  that follow we become acquainted with him in the capacity of  a writer on phases of the history and aesthetics of music.    It was in 1896 that the authorities of Columbia University  offered to him the newly created Chair of Music, for which he  had been strongly recommended as one of the leading composers  of America. After much thought he accepted the position, and  entered upon his duties with the hope of accomplishing much for  his art in the favorable environment which he fully expected  to find. The aim of the instruction, as he planned it, was:  \"First, to teach music scientifically and technically, with a  view to training musicians who shall be competent to teach and  compose. Second, to treat music historically and aesthetically  as an element of liberal culture.\" In carrying out his plans he  conducted a course, which, while \"outlining the purely technical  side of music,\" was intended to give a \"general idea of music  from its historical and aesthetic side.\" Supplementing this,  as an advanced course, he also gave one which took up the  development of musical forms, piano music, modern orchestration  and symphonic forms, impressionism, the relationship of music  to the other arts, with much other material necessary to form  an adequate basis for music criticism.    It is a matter for sincere regret that Mr. MacDowell put in  permanent form only a portion of the lectures prepared for  the two courses just mentioned. While some were read from  manuscript, others were given from notes and illustrated with  musical quotations. This was the case, very largely, with  the lectures prepared for the advanced course, which included  extremely valuable and individual treatment of the subject of  the piano, its literature and composers, modern music, etc.    A point of view which the lecturer brought to bear upon his  subject was that of a composer to whom there were no secrets  as to the processes by which music is made. It was possible  for him to enter into the spirit in which the composers both  of the earlier and later periods conceived their works, and  to value the completed compositions according to the way in  which he found that they had followed the canons of the best  and purest art. It is this unique attitude which makes the  lectures so valuable to the musician as well as to the student.    The Editor would also call attention to the intellectual  qualities of Mr. MacDowell, which determined his attitude  toward any subject. He was a poet who chose to express himself  through the medium of music rather than in some other way. For  example, he had great natural facility in the use of the  pencil and the brush, and was strongly advised to take up  painting as a career. The volume of his poetical writings,  issued several years ago, is proof of his power of expression  in verse and lyric forms. Above these and animating them  were what Mr. Lawrence Gilman terms \"his uncommon faculties  of vision and imagination.\" What he thought, what he said,  what he wrote, was determined by the poet's point of view,  and this is evident on nearly every page of these lectures.    He was a wide reader, one who, from natural bent, dipped into  the curious and out-of-the-way corners of literature, as will  be noticed in his references to other works in the course  of the lectures, particularly to Rowbotham's picturesque and  fascinating story of the formative period of music. Withal he  was always in touch with contemporary affairs. With the true  outlook of the poet he was fearless, individual, and even  radical in his views. This spirit, as indicated before, he  carried into his lectures, for he demanded of his pupils that  above all they should be prepared to do their own thinking and  reach their own conclusions. He was accustomed to say that we  need in the United States, a public that shall be independent  in its judgment on art and art products, that shall not be tied  down to verdicts based on tradition and convention, but shall be  prepared to reach conclusions through knowledge and sincerity.    That these lectures may aid in this splendid educational  purpose is the wish of those who are responsible for placing  them before the public.

A much more plausible explanation, it seems to me, is  to be found in the theory of Theophrastus, in which the origin  of music is attributed to the whole range of human emotion."]]]
