Indianapolis, Indiana          FOREWORD      No greater teaching force has ever been discovered than the story and  no one has ever lived who used that force so skillfully as did our  Great Teacher.    It is not strange, then, that among all the stories that have ever  been written or told none are so dear to us as the stories and legends  which center in His birth.    Young and old alike delight in them and never tire of hearing them.    Unusual care has been taken in compiling this little volume and each  story has its own sweet lesson. Each one is from the pen of one who  has imbibed the real spirit of Christmas. They were chosen as being  particularly well adapted to use in connection with the Christmas  Service \"White Gifts for the King,\" but they will prove attractive and  helpful at any time during the year.    It is our earnest wish that this little book may find its way into  many homes and schools and Sunday Schools and that its contents may  help to give a deeper appreciation of the true Christmas spirit.

Curtiss      A great many years ago in a land far away from us there was a certain  king who was dearly beloved by all of his people. Men admired him  because he was strong and just. In all of his dealings they knew they  could depend upon him. Every matter that came to his consideration was  carefully weighed in his mind and his decisions were always wise.  Women trusted him because he was pure and true, with lofty thoughts  and high ambitions, and the children loved him because of his  gentleness and tenderness toward them. He was never so burdened with  affairs of state that he could not stop to speak a pleasant word of  greeting to the tiniest child, and the very poorest of his subjects  knew they could count upon his interest in them.    This deep-seated love and reverence for their king made the people of  this country wish very much for a way in which to give expression to  it so that he would understand it. Many consultations were held and  one after another the plans suggested were rejected, but at last a  most happy solution was found. It was rapidly circulated here and  there and it met with the most hearty approval everywhere.    It was a plan for celebrating the King's birthday.    Of course, that had been done in many lands before, but there were  certain features about this celebration which differed materially from  anything that had ever been tried. They decided that on the King's  birthday the people should all bring him gifts, but they wanted in  some way to let him know that these gifts were the expression of a  love on the part of the giver which was pure and true and unselfish,  and in order to show that, it was decided that each gift should be a  \"White Gift.\"    The King heard about this beautiful plan, and it touched his heart in  a wonderful way. He decided that he would do his part to carry out the  idea and let his loving subjects know how much he appreciated their  thoughtfulness.    You can just imagine the excitement there was all over the land as the  King's birthday drew near. All sorts of loving sacrifices had been  made and everyone was anxious to make his gift the very best he had to  offer. At last the day dawned, and eagerly the people came dressed in  white and carrying their white gifts. To their surprise they were  ushered into a great, big room--the largest one in the palace. They  stood in silence when they first entered it, for it was beautiful  beyond all expression. It was a _white_ room;--the floor was white  marble; the ceiling looked like a mass of soft, white fluffy clouds;  the walls were hung with beautiful white silken draperies, and all the  furnishings were white. In one end of the room stood a stately white  throne, and seated upon it was their beloved ruler and he was clad in  shining white robes, and his attendants--all dressed in white--were  grouped around him.    Then came the presentation of the gifts. What a wealth of them there  was--and how different they were in value. In those days it was just  as it is now--there were many people who had great wealth, and they  brought gifts which were generous in proportion to their wealth.    One brought a handful of pearls, another a number of carved ivories.  There were beautiful laces and silks and embroideries, all in pure  white, and even splendid white chargers were brought to his majesty.    But many of the people were poor--some of them very poor--and their  gifts were quite different from those I have been telling about. Some  of the women brought handfuls of white rice, some of the boys brought  their favorite white pigeons, and one dear little girl smilingly gave  him a pure white rose.    It was wonderful to watch the King as each one came and kneeled before  him as he presented his gift. He never seemed to notice whether the  gift was great or small; he regarded not one gift above another so  long as all were white. Never had the King been so happy as he was  that day and never had such real joy filled the hearts of the people.  They decided to use the same plan every year, and so it came to pass  that year after year on the King's birthday the people came from here  and there and everywhere and brought their white gifts--the gifts  which showed that their love was pure, strong, true and without stain,  and year after year the King sat in his white robes on the white  throne in the great white room and it was always the same--he regarded  not one gift above another so long as all were _white_.          HER BIRTHDAY DREAM[*]    By Nellie C. King      Marcia Brownlow came out of the church, and walked rapidly down the  street. She seemed perturbed; her gray eyes flashed, and on her cheeks  glowed two red spots. She was glad she was not going home, so she  wouldn't have to take a car, but could walk the short distance to Aunt  Sophy's, where she had been invited to dine and visit with her special  chum, Cousin Jack--who was home from college for the short  Thanksgiving vacation. She slowed up as she reached her destination,  and waited a little before going in--she wanted to get calmed down a  bit, for she didn't want her friend to see her when she felt so \"riled  up.\" Back of it was a secret reluctance to meet Jack--he was so  different since the Gipsy Smith revival; of course, he was perfectly  lovely, and unchanged toward her, but--somehow, she felt uncomfortable  in his presence--and she didn't enjoy having her self-satisfaction  disturbed.    As she entered the dining-room, she was greeted with exclamations of  surprise and pleasure.    \"Why, Marcia!\" said Aunt Sophia; \"we had given you up! I almost never  knew of your being late in keeping an appointment.\"    \"You must excuse me, Auntie; and lay this offense to the charge of our  Sunday school superintendent,\" answered Marcia.    \"I suppose Mr. Robinson is laying his plans for Christmas,\" remarked  Uncle John. \"He believes in taking time by the forelock--and a very  commendable habit it is, too.\"    \"Yes,\" answered Marcia laconically.    Jack glanced at her keenly. \"Is there anything new in the Christmas  line?\" he asked.    The gray eyes grew black, and the red spots burned again, as Marcia  replied: \"Well, I should think so--he proposes to turn things  topsy-turvy!\"    \"My! What does he want to do?\" inquired Cousin Augusta.    \"Oh, he calls it the 'White Gift Christmas'; but the long and short of  the matter is, that he proposes to 'turn down' Santa Claus, and all  the old time-honored customs connected with Christmas that are so dear  to the hearts of the children, and have the school do the giving. He  has a big banner hung up in the Sunday school room bearing the words,  'Gifts for the Christ-Child'.\"    \"An excellent idea,\" exclaimed Uncle John, \"but I don't see much of an  innovation about that; you have always made the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17774"],[0,"The Poetry of Architecture (#1)"],[1,"Distributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net                      THE COMPLETE WORKS OF JOHN RUSKIN    VOLUME I      POETRY OF ARCHITECTURE    SEVEN LAMPS OF ARCHITECTURE        [Illustration: J.

Of this work Mr. RUSKIN says in his Autobiography:--\"The idea had come  into my head in the summer of '37, and, I imagine, rose immediately out  of my sense of the contrast between the cottages of Westmoreland and  those of Italy. Anyhow, the November number of Loudon's _Architectural  Magazine_ for 1837 opens with 'Introduction to the Poetry of  Architecture; or the Architecture of the Nations of Europe considered in  its Association with Natural Scenery and National Character,' by Kata  Phusin. I could not have put in fewer, or more inclusive words, the  definition of what half my future life was to be spent in discoursing  of; while the _nom-de-plume_ I chose, 'ACCORDING TO NATURE,' was equally  expressive of the temper in which I was to discourse alike on that, and  every other subject. The adoption of a _nom-de-plume_ at all implied (as  also the concealment of name on the first publication of 'Modern  Painters') a sense of a power of judgment in myself, which it would not  have been becoming in a youth of eighteen to claim....\"    \"As it is, these youthful essays, though deformed by assumption, and  shallow in contents, are curiously right up to the points they reach;  and already distinguished above most of the literature of the time, for  the skill of language, which the public at once felt for a pleasant gift  in me.\" (_Praeterita_, vol. I. chap. 12.)    In a paper on \"My First Editor,\" written in 1878, Mr. Ruskin says of  these essays that they \"contain sentences nearly as well put together as  any I have done since.\"    The Conductor of the _Architectural Magazine_ in reviewing the year's  work said (December, 1838):--\"One series of papers, commenced in the  last volume and concluded in the present one, we consider to be of  particular value to the young architect. We allude to the 'Essays on the  Poetry of Architecture,' by Kata Phusin. These essays will afford little  pleasure to the mere builder, or to the architect who has no principle  of guidance but precedent; but for such readers they were never  intended. They are addressed to the young and unprejudiced artist; and  their great object is to induce him to think and to exercise his  reason.... There are some, we trust, of the rising generation, who are  able to free themselves from the trammels and architectural bigotry of  Vitruvius and his followers; and it is to such alone that we look  forward for any real improvement in architecture as an art of design and  taste.\"    The essays are in two parts: the first describing the cottages of  England, France, Switzerland, and Italy, and giving hints and directions  for picturesque cottage-building. The second part treats of the villas  of Italy and England--with special reference to Como and Windermere; and  concludes with a discussion of the laws of artistic composition, and  practical suggestions of interest to the builders of country-houses.    It was the Author's original intention to have proceeded from the  cottage and the villa to the higher forms of Architecture; but the  Magazine to which he contributed was brought to a close shortly after  the completion of his chapters on the villa, and his promise of farther  studies was not redeemed until ten years later, by the publication of  _The Seven Lamps of Architecture_, and still more completely in _The  Stones of Venice_.    Other papers contributed by Mr. Ruskin to the same Magazine, on  Perspective, and on the proposed monument to Sir Walter Scott at  Edinburgh, are not included in this volume, as they do not form any part  of the series on the Poetry of Architecture.    The text is carefully reprinted from the _Architectural Magazine_. A few  additional notes are distinguished by square brackets.    A few of the old cuts, necessary to the text, are reproduced, and some  are replaced by engravings from sketches by the Author. Possessors of  the _Architectural Magazine_, vol. V., will be interested in comparing  the wood-cut of the cottage in Val d'Aosta (p. 104 of that volume) with  the photogravure from the original pencil drawing, which faces p. 21 of  this work. It is much to be regretted that the original of the Coniston  Hall (fig. 8; p. 50 of this work) has disappeared, and that the Author's  youthful record of a scene so familiar to him in later years should be  represented only by the harsh lines of Mr. Loudon's engraver.    THE EDITOR.          INTRODUCTION.      1. The Science of Architecture, followed out to its full extent, is one  of the noblest of those which have reference only to the creations of  human minds. It is not merely a science of the rule and compass, it does  not consist only in the observation of just rule, or of fair proportion:  it is, or ought to be, a science of feeling more than of rule, a  ministry to the mind, more than to the eye. If we consider how much less  the beauty and majesty of a building depend upon its pleasing certain  prejudices of the eye, than upon its rousing certain trains of  meditation in the mind, it will show in a moment how many intricate  questions of feeling are involved in the raising of an edifice; it will  convince us of the truth of a proposition, which might at first have  appeared startling, that no man can be an architect, who is not a  metaphysician.    2. To the illustration of the department of this noble science which may  be designated the Poetry of Architecture, this and some future articles  will be dedicated. It is this peculiarity of the art which constitutes  its nationality; and it will be found as interesting as it is useful, to  trace in the distinctive characters of the architecture of nations, not  only its adaptation to the situation and climate in which it has arisen,  but its strong similarity to, and connection with, the prevailing turn  of mind by which the nation who first employed it is distinguished.    3. I consider the task I have imposed upon myself the more necessary,  because this department of the science, perhaps regarded by some who  have no ideas beyond stone and mortar as chimerical, and by others who  think nothing necessary but truth and proportion as useless, is at a  miserably low ebb in England. And what is the consequence? We have  Corinthian columns placed beside pilasters of no order at all,  surmounted by monstrosified pepper-boxes, Gothic in form and Grecian in  detail, in a building nominally and peculiarly \"National\"; we have Swiss  cottages, falsely and calumniously so entitled, dropped in the  brick-fields round the metropolis; and we have staring square-windowed,  flat-roofed"]]]
