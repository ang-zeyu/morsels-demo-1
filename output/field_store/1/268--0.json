He  was tall enough to be conspicuous and well bred enough to be indifferent  to the fact, good looking, in a bronzed, blond clean-shaven way, and  branded in the popular imagination as a young and active millionaire.    At a neighbouring table a man lent forward and whispered to the other  men and women with him:    \"Do you know who that is?--that is young Holland.\"    \"What, that boy! He doesn't look as if he were out of school.\"    \"No,\" said one of the women, elaborating the comment, \"he does not look  old enough to order a dinner, let alone managing mines.\"    \"Oh, I guess he can order a dinner all right,\" said the first man. \"He  is older than he looks. He must be twenty-six.\"    \"What do you suppose he does with all that money?\"    The first thing he did with it, at the moment, was to purchase an  evening paper, for just then he snapped his fingers at a boy, who  promptly ran to get him one.    \"Well, one thing he does,\" answered the man who had first given  information, \"he has an apartment in this building, up stairs, and I bet  that costs him a pretty penny.\"    In the meantime Holland had opened his paper, scanned the head lines,  and was about to turn to the stock quotations when a paragraph of  interest caught his eye. So marked was the gesture with which he raised  it to his eyes that his admirers at the next table noticed it, and  speculated on the subject of the paragraph.    It was headed: \"Millionaires' Summer Homes Looted,\" and said further:    \"Hillsborough, December 21st. The fourth in a series of daring robberies  which have been taking place in this neighbourhood during the past month  occurred last night when the residence of C.B. Vaughan of New York was  entered and valuable wines and bric-a-brac removed. The robbery was not  discovered until this morning when a shutter was observed unfastened on  the second story. On entering the watchman found the house had been  carefully gone over, and although only a few objects seem to be missing,  these are of the greatest value. The thief apparently had plenty of  time, and probably occupied the whole night in his search. This is the  more remarkable because the watchman asserts that he spent at least an  hour on the piazza during the night. How the thief effected an entrance  by the second story is not clear. During the past five weeks the houses  of L.G. Innes, T. Wilson and Abraham Marheim have been entered in a  manner almost precisely similar. There was a report yesterday that some  of the Marheim silver had been discovered with a dealer in Boston, but  that he could not identify the person from whom he bought them further  than that she was a young lady to whom they might very well have  belonged. The fact that it was a young lady who disposed of them to him  suggests that the goods must have changed hands several times. The  Marheim family is abroad, and the servants....\"    Here a waiter touched his elbow.    \"Mr. and Mrs. Vaughan have come, sir,\" he said.    \"Send up to my apartment and tell Mrs. May we are sitting down to  dinner,\" returned Holland promptly, and advanced to meet the prosperous  looking couple approaching.    \"I'm afraid we are late,\" said the lady, \"but can you blame us? Have you  heard? We have been telegraphing to Hillsborough all the afternoon to  find out what has gone.\"    \"You are not late. My sister has not come down yet. I was just reading  about your robbery. Have you lost anything of value?\"    \"Oh, I suppose so,\" said Mrs. Vaughan cheerfully, sitting down and  beginning to draw off her gloves. \"We had a Van Dyke etching, and some  enamels that have gone certainly, and Charlie feels awfully about his  wine.\"    \"Yes,\" said Mr. Vaughan gloomily. \"I tell you he is going to have a  happy time with that champagne. It is the best I ever tasted.\"    \"Upon my word,\" said Geoffrey, \"they are a nice lot of countrymen up  there. Four robberies and not so much as a clue.\"    \"_You_ need not be afraid,\" said Mrs. Vaughan rather spitefully. \"In  spite of all your treasures, I don't believe any thief would take the  trouble to climb to the top of your mountain.\"    Holland's selection of a distant hilltop for his large place pleased no  true Hillsboroughite. As an eligible bachelor he was inaccessible, and  as a property-holder he was too far away to increase the value of  Hillsborough real-estate by his wonderful lawns and gardens.    Mrs. Vaughan's irritation did not appear to disturb Geoffrey, for he  laughed very amiably, and replied that he could only hope that the thief  was as poor a pedestrian as she seemed to imagine as he should not like  to lose any of his things; and he added that in his opinion Vaughan  ought to be starting for Hillsborough at once.    \"Pooh,\" said that gentleman, \"I can't go with the market in this  condition,--would lose more than the whole house is worth.\"    \"You would go duck-shooting in a minute,\" said Holland, \"and this would  be a good deal better sport.\"    Mr. Vaughan ignored this remark. \"The thing to do,\" he said, \"is to  offer a reward, a big enough reward to attract some first-class  detective.\"    \"All right,\" said Geoffrey readily, \"I'll join you. Those other fellows  ought to be willing to put up a thousand apiece,--that will be five  thousand. Is that enough? We can have it in the papers to-morrow. What  shall I say? Five thousand dollars reward will be paid for information  leading to the conviction--and so on. I'll go and telephone now,\" and  with a promptness which surprised Mr. Vaughan, he was gone.    When he came back his sister was in her place and they were all  discussing the burglary with interest. Mrs. May, who was somewhat older  than her brother, had some of the more agreeable qualities of a gossip,  that is to say she had imagination and a good memory for detail.    \"For my part,\" she was saying, \"I have the greatest respect and  admiration for him. Do you know he could not find anything worth taking  at the Wilsons',--after all his trouble. I have often sat in that  drawing-room myself, and wondered if they should offer me anything in it  as a present, whether I could find something that would not actually  disgrace me. I never could. He evidently felt the same way. The Wilsons  make a great to-do about the house having been entered, and tell you how  he must have been frightened away,--frightened away by the hideousness  of their things! Those woolly paintings on wood, and the black satin  parasol that turns out to be an umbrella stand.\"    \"My dear Florence,\" said her brother mildly, \"how can a black satin  parasol be an umbrella-stand?\"    \"Exactly, Geof, how can it? That is what you say all through the  Wilsons' house. How can it be! However it is not really black satin,  only painted to resemble it. The waste paper baskets look like trunks of  trees, and the match boxes like old shoes. Nothing in the house is  really what it looks like, except the beds; they look uncomfortable, and  some one who had stayed there told me that they were.\"    \"Dear Florence,\" said Mrs. Vaughan, \"is it not like her kindness of  heart--it runs in the family--to try and make my burglary into a  compliment, but really though it is flattering to be robbed by a  connoisseur I could forego the honour. You see you have taken away my  last hope that my very best escaped his attention.\"    \"No, indeed, the best is all he cared for. Honestly, Jane, haven't you  an admiration for a man of so much taste and ability? Just think, he has  entered four houses and there is not the slightest trace of him.\"    \"There must be _traces_ of him,\" said Geoffrey. \"The Inness house was  entered after that snow storm in the early part of the month. There must  have been footprints.\"    \"Of course,\" said Mr. Vaughan, \"that is what makes me think that the  watchmen are in it. It's probably a combination of two or three of  them.\"    \"Well, that lets Geoffrey out,\" said the irrepressible Florence. \"No one  would take his watchman into any combination,--he is a thousand and two  and feeble for his age. However, there is no use in discussing the  possibility, for it is not a combination of watchmen, begging your  pardon, Mr. Vaughan. It is lonely genius, a slim, dark figure in a  slouch hat. That is the way I imagine him. Do you really suppose that a  watchman would take six pair of Mrs. Inness' best linen sheets,  embroidered in her initials, the monogram so thick that it scratches  your nose; and a beautiful light blue silk coverlet,--all just out from  Paris. I saw them when she first had them.\"    \"What,\" said Geoffrey, addressing the other male intellect present, \"do  you make of the young woman who disposed of some of the Marheim silver  in Boston?\"    [Illustration: \"IT "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1484"],[0,"The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse (#1)"],[1,"FOUR HORSEMEN OF THE APOCALYPSE    (Los Cuatro Jinettes del Apocalipsis)    by Vicente Blasco Ibanez      Translated by Charlotte Brewster Jordan        CONTENTS    PART I    I.

The change of  the seasons was at this time greatly confused in his mind, and evidently  demanded some readjustment.    Five months had passed since their last interview in this square had  afforded the wandering lovers the refuge of a damp, depressing calmness  near a boulevard of continual movement close to a great railroad  station. The hour of the appointment was always five and Julio was  accustomed to see his beloved approaching by the reflection of the  recently lit street lamps, her figure enveloped in furs, and holding  her muff before her face as if it were a half-mask. Her sweet voice,  greeting him, had breathed forth a cloud of vapor, white and tenuous,  congealed by the cold. After various hesitating interviews, they had  abandoned the garden. Their love had acquired the majestic importance of  acknowledged fact, and from five to seven had taken refuge in the fifth  floor of the rue de la Pompe where Julio had an artist's studio. The  curtains well drawn over the double glass windows, the cosy hearth-fire  sending forth its ruddy flame as the only light of the room, the  monotonous song of the samovar bubbling near the cups of tea--all  the seclusion of life isolated by an idolizing love--had dulled their  perceptions to the fact that the afternoons were growing longer, that  outside the sun was shining later and later into the pearl-covered  depths of the clouds, and that a timid and pallid Spring was beginning  to show its green finger tips in the buds of the branches suffering the  last nips of Winter--that wild, black boar who so often turned on his  tracks.    Then Julio had made his trip to Buenos Aires, encountering in the other  hemisphere the last smile of Autumn and the first icy winds from the  pampas. And just as his mind was becoming reconciled to the fact that  for him Winter was an eternal season--since it always came to meet  him in his change of domicile from one extreme of the planet to the  other--lo, Summer was unexpectedly confronting him in this dreary  garden!    A swarm of children was racing and screaming through the short avenues  around the monument. On entering the place, the first thing that Julio  encountered was a hoop which came rolling toward his legs, trundled by  a childish hand. Then he stumbled over a ball. Around the chestnut  trees was gathering the usual warm-weather crowd, seeking the blue shade  perforated with points of light. Many nurse-maids from the neighboring  houses were working and chattering here, following with indifferent  glances the rough games of the children confided to their care. Near  them were the men who had brought their papers down into the garden  under the impression that they could read them in the midst of peaceful  groves. All of the benches were full. A few women were occupying camp  stools with that feeling of superiority which ownership always confers.  The iron chairs, \"pay-seats,\" were serving as resting places for  various suburban dames, loaded down with packages, who were waiting for  straggling members of their families in order to take the train in the  Gare Saint Lazare. . . .    And Julio, in his special delivery letter, had proposed meeting in this  place, supposing that it would be as little frequented as in former  times. She, too, with the same thoughtlessness, had in her reply, set  the usual hour of five o'clock, believing that after passing a few  minutes in the Printemps or the Galeries on the pretext of shopping, she  would be able to slip over to the unfrequented garden without risk of  being seen by any of her numerous acquaintances.    Desnoyers was enjoying an almost forgotten sensation, that of strolling  through vast spaces, crushing as he walked the grains of sand under  his feet. For the past twenty days his rovings had been upon planks,  following with the automatic precision of a riding school the oval  promenade on the deck of a ship. His feet accustomed to insecure  ground, still were keeping on terra firma a certain sensation of elastic  unsteadiness. His goings and comings were not awakening the curiosity of  the people seated in the open, for a common preoccupation seemed to  be monopolizing all the men and women. The groups were exchanging  impressions. Those who happened to have a paper in their hands, saw  their neighbors approaching them with a smile of interrogation. There  had suddenly disappeared that distrust and suspicion which impels the  inhabitants of large cities mutually to ignore one another, taking each  other's measure at a glance as though they were enemies.    \"They are talking about the war,\" said Desnoyers to himself. \"At this  time, all Paris speaks of nothing but the possibility of war.\"    Outside of the garden he could see also the same anxiety which was  making those around him so fraternal and sociable. The venders of  newspapers were passing through the boulevard crying the evening  editions, their furious speed repeatedly slackened by the eager hands  of the passers-by contending for the papers. Every reader was instantly  surrounded by a group begging for news or trying to decipher over his  shoulder the great headlines at the top of the sheet. In the rue des  Mathurins, on the other side of the square, a circle of workmen under  the awning of a tavern were listening to the comments of a friend who  accompanied his words with oratorical gestures and wavings of the paper.  The traffic in the streets, the general bustle of the city was the same  as in other days, but it seemed to Julio that the vehicles were whirling  past more rapidly, that there was a feverish agitation in the air and  that people were speaking and smiling in a different way. The women of  the garden were looking even at him as if they had seen him in former  days. He was able to approach them and begin a conversation without  experiencing the slightest strangeness.    \"They are talking of the war,\" he said again but with the commiseration  of a superior intelligence which foresees the future and feels above the  impressions of the vulgar crowd.    He knew exactly what course he was going to follow. He had disembarked  at ten o'clock the night before, and as it was not yet twenty-four hours  since he had touched land, his mentality was still that of a man who  comes from afar, across oceanic immensities, from boundless horizons,  and is surprised at finding himself in touch with the preoccupations  which govern human communities. After disembarking he had spent two  hours in a cafe in Boulogne, listlessly watching the middle-class  families who passed their time in the monotonous placidity of a life  without dangers. Then the special train for the passengers from South  America had brought him to Paris, leaving him at four in the morning  on a platform of the Gare du Nord in the embrace of Pepe Argensola, the  young Spaniard whom he sometimes called \"my secretary\" or \"my valet\"  because it was difficult to define exactly the relationship between  them. In reality, he was a mixture of friend and parasite, the poor  comrade, complacent and capable in his companionship with a rich youth  on bad terms with his family, sharing with him the ups and downs  of fortune, picking up the crumbs of prosperous days, or inventing  expedients to keep up appearances in the hours of poverty.    \"What about the war?\" Argensola had asked him before inquiring about the  result of his trip. \"You have come a long ways and should know much.\"    Soon he was sound asleep in his dear old bed while his \"secretary\" was  pacing up and down the studio talking of Servia, Russia and the Kaiser.  This youth, too, skeptical as he generally was about everything not  connected with his own interests, appeared infected by the general  excitement.    When Desnoyers awoke he found her note awaiting him, setting their  meeting at five that afternoon and also containing a few words about the  threatened danger which was claiming the attention of all Paris. Upon  going out in search of lunch the concierge, on the pretext of welcoming  him back, had asked him the war news. And in the restaurant, the cafe  and the street, always war . . . the possibility of war with  Germany. . . .    Julio was an optimist. What did all this restlessness signify to a man  who had just been living more than twenty days among Germans, crossing  the Atlantic under the flag of the Empire?    He had sailed from Buenos Aires in a steamer of the Hamburg line, the  Koenig Frederic August. The world was in blessed tranquillity when  the boat left port. Only the whites and half-breeds of Mexico were  exterminating each other in conflicts in order that nobody might believe  that man is an animal degenerated by peace. On the rest of the  planet, the people were displaying unusual prudence. Even aboard the  transatlantic liner, the little world of passengers of most diverse  nationalities appeared a fragment of future society implanted by way of  experiment in modern times--a sketch of"]]]
