It  was true, too. She had a little thin face and a little thin body, thin  light hair and a sour expression. Her hair was yellow, and her face was  yellow because she had been born in India and had always been ill in one  way or another. Her father had held a position under the English  Government and had always been busy and ill himself, and her mother had  been a great beauty who cared only to go to parties and amuse herself  with gay people. She had not wanted a little girl at all, and when Mary  was born she handed her over to the care of an Ayah, who was made to  understand that if she wished to please the Mem Sahib she must keep the  child out of sight as much as possible. So when she was a sickly,  fretful, ugly little baby she was kept out of the way, and when she  became a sickly, fretful, toddling thing she was kept out of the way  also. She never remembered seeing familiarly anything but the dark faces  of her Ayah and the other native servants, and as they always obeyed her  and gave her her own way in everything, because the Mem Sahib would be  angry if she was disturbed by her crying, by the time she was six years  old she was as tyrannical and selfish a little pig as ever lived. The  young English governess who came to teach her to read and write disliked  her so much that she gave up her place in three months, and when other  governesses came to try to fill it they always went away in a shorter  time than the first one. So if Mary had not chosen to really want to  know how to read books she would never have learned her letters at all.    One frightfully hot morning, when she was about nine years old, she  awakened feeling very cross, and she became crosser still when she saw  that the servant who stood by her bedside was not her Ayah.    \"Why did you come?\" she said to the strange woman. \"I will not let you  stay. Send my Ayah to me.\"    The woman looked frightened, but she only stammered that the Ayah could  not come and when Mary threw herself into a passion and beat and kicked  her, she looked only more frightened and repeated that it was not  possible for the Ayah to come to Missie Sahib.    There was something mysterious in the air that morning. Nothing was done  in its regular order and several of the native servants seemed missing,  while those whom Mary saw slunk or hurried about with ashy and scared  faces. But no one would tell her anything and her Ayah did not come. She  was actually left alone as the morning went on, and at last she wandered  out into the garden and began to play by herself under a tree near the  veranda. She pretended that she was making a flower-bed, and she stuck  big scarlet hibiscus blossoms into little heaps of earth, all the time  growing more and more angry and muttering to herself the things she  would say and the names she would call Saidie when she returned.    \"Pig! Pig! Daughter of Pigs!\" she said, because to call a native a pig  is the worst insult of all.    She was grinding her teeth and saying this over and over again when she  heard her mother come out on the veranda with some one. She was with a  fair young man and they stood talking together in low strange voices.  Mary knew the fair young man who looked like a boy. She had heard that  he was a very young officer who had just come from England. The child  stared at him, but she stared most at her mother. She always did this  when she had a chance to see her, because the Mem Sahib--Mary used to  call her that oftener than anything else--was such a tall, slim, pretty  person and wore such lovely clothes. Her hair was like curly silk and  she had a delicate little nose which seemed to be disdaining things, and  she had large laughing eyes. All her clothes were thin and floating, and  Mary said they were \"full of lace.\" They looked fuller of lace than ever  this morning, but her eyes were not laughing at all. They were large and  scared and lifted imploringly to the fair boy officer's face.    \"Is it so very bad? Oh, is it?\" Mary heard her say.    \"Awfully,\" the young man answered in a trembling voice. \"Awfully, Mrs.  Lennox. You ought to have gone to the hills two weeks ago.\"    The Mem Sahib wrung her hands.    \"Oh, I know I ought!\" she cried. \"I only stayed to go to that silly  dinner party. What a fool I was!\"    At that very moment such a loud sound of wailing broke out from the  servants' quarters that she clutched the young man's arm, and Mary stood  shivering from head to foot. The wailing grew wilder and wilder.    \"What is it? What is it?\" Mrs. Lennox gasped.    \"Some one has died,\" answered the boy officer. \"You did not say it had  broken out among your servants.\"    \"I did not know!\" the Mem Sahib cried. \"Come with me! Come with me!\" and  she turned and ran into the house.    After that appalling things happened, and the mysteriousness of the  morning was explained to Mary. The cholera had broken out in its most  fatal form and people were dying like flies. The Ayah had been taken ill  in the night, and it was because she had just died that the servants had  wailed in the huts. Before the next day three other servants were dead  and others had run away in terror. There was panic on every side, and  dying people in all the bungalows.    During the confusion and bewilderment of the second day Mary hid herself  in the nursery and was forgotten by every one. Nobody thought of her,  nobody wanted her, and strange things happened of which she knew  nothing. Mary alternately cried and slept through the hours. She only  knew that people were ill and that she heard mysterious and frightening  sounds. Once she crept into the dining-room and found it empty, though a  partly finished meal was on the table and chairs and plates looked as  if they had been hastily pushed back when the diners rose suddenly for  some reason. The child ate some fruit and biscuits, and being thirsty  she drank a glass of wine which stood nearly filled. It was sweet, and  she did not know how strong it was. Very soon it made her intensely  drowsy, and she went back to her nursery and shut herself in again,  frightened by cries she heard in the huts and by the hurrying sound of  feet. The wine made her so sleepy that she could scarcely keep her eyes  open and she lay down on her bed and knew nothing more for a long time.    Many things happened during the hours in which she slept so heavily, but  she was not disturbed by the wails and the sound of things being carried  in and out of the bungalow.    When she awakened she lay and stared at the wall. The house was  perfectly still. She had never known it to be so silent before. She  heard neither voices nor footsteps, and wondered if everybody had got  well of the cholera and all the trouble was over. She wondered also who  would take care of her now her Ayah was dead. There would be a new Ayah,  and perhaps she would know some new stories. Mary had been rather tired  of the old ones. She did not cry because her nurse had died. She was not  an affectionate child and had never cared much for any one. The noise  and hurrying about and wailing over the cholera had frightened her, and  she had been angry because no one seemed to remember that she was alive.  Every one was too panic-stricken to think of a little girl no one was  fond of. When people had the cholera it seemed that they"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1740"],[0,"The Flying U's Last Stand (#1)"],[1,"FLYING-U'S LAST STAND    By B. M.

OLD WAYS AND NEW    Progress is like the insidious change from youth to old age, except that  progress does not mean decay. The change that is almost imperceptible  and yet inexorable is much the same, however. You will see a community  apparently changeless as the years pass by; and yet, when the years have  gone and you look back, there has been a change. It is not the same.  It never will be the same. It can pass through further change, but it  cannot go back. Men look back sick sometimes with longing for the things  that were and that can be no more; they live the old days in memory--but  try as they will they may not go back. With intelligent, persistent  effort they may retard further change considerably, but that is the most  that they can hope to do. Civilization and Time will continue the march  in spite of all that man may do.    That is the way it was with the Flying U. Old J. G. Whitmore fought  doggedly against the changing conditions--and he fought intelligently  and well. When he saw the range dwindling and the way to the watering  places barred against his cattle with long stretches of barbed wire, he  sent his herds deeper into the Badlands to seek what grazing was in the  hidden, little valleys and the deep, sequestered canyons. He cut more  hay for winter feeding, and he sowed his meadows to alfalfa that he  might increase the crops. He shipped old cows and dry cows with his fat  steers in the fall, and he bettered the blood of his herds and raised  bigger cattle. Therefore, if his cattle grew fewer in number, they  improved in quality and prices went higher, so that the result was much  the same.    It began to look, then, as though J. G. Whitmore was cunningly besting  the situation, and was going to hold out indefinitely against the  encroachments of civilization upon the old order of things on the range.  And it had begun to look as though he was going to best Time at his own  game, and refuse also to grow old; as though he would go on being the  same pudgy, grizzled, humorously querulous Old Man beloved of his men,  the Happy Family of the Flying U.    Sometimes, however, Time will fill a four-flush with the joker, and then  laugh while he rakes in the chips. J. G. Whitmore had been going his way  and refusing to grow old for a long time--and then an accident, which  is Time's joker, turned the game against him. He stood for just a second  too long on a crowded crossing in Chicago, hesitating between going  forward or back. And that second gave Time a chance to play an accident.  A big seven-passenger touring car mowed him down and left him in a heap  for the ambulance from the nearest hospital to gather on its stretcher.    The Old Man did not die; he had lived long on the open range and he was  pretty tough and hard to kill. He went back to his beloved Flying U,  with a crutch to help him shuffle from bed to easy chair and back again.    The Little Doctor, who was his youngest sister, nursed him tirelessly;  but it was long before there came a day when the Old Man gave his crutch  to the Kid to use for a stick-horse, and walked through the living room  and out upon the porch with the help of a cane and the solicitous arm  of the Little Doctor, and with the Kid galloping gleefully before him on  the crutch.    Later he discarded the help of somebody's arm, and hobbled down to the  corral with the cane, and with the Kid still galloping before him on  \"Uncle Gee Gee's\" crutch. He stood for some time leaning against the  corral watching some of the boys halter-breaking a horse that was later  to be sold--when he was \"broke gentle\"--and then he hobbled back again,  thankful for the soft comfort of his big chair.    That was well enough, as far as it went. The Flying U took it for  granted that the Old Man was slowly returning to the old order of life,  when rheumatism was his only foe and he could run things with his old  energy and easy good management. But there never came a day when the Old  Man gave his cane to the kid to play with. There never came a day when  he was not thankful for the soft comfort of his chair. There never came  a day when he was the same Old Man who joshed the boys and scolded them  and threatened them. The day was always coming--of course!--when his  back would quit aching if he walked to the stable and back without a  long rest between, but it never actually arrived.    So, imperceptibly but surely, the Old Man began to grow old. The thin  spot on top of his head grew shiny, so that the Kid noticed it and made  blunt comments upon the subject. His rheumatism was not his worst foe,  now. He had to pet his digestive apparatus and cut out strong coffee  with three heaping teaspoons of sugar in each cup, because the Little  Doctor told him his liver was torpid. He had to stop giving the Kid  jolty rides on his knees,--but that was because the Kid was getting too  big for baby play, the Old Man declared. The Kid was big enough to ride  real horses, now, and he ought to be ashamed to ride knee-horses any  more.    To two things the Old Man clung almost fiercely; the old regime of  ranging his cattle at large and starting out the wagons in the spring  just the same as if twenty-five men instead of twelve went with them;  and the retention of the Happy Family on his payroll, just as if they  were actually needed. If one of the boys left to try other things and  other fields, the Old Man considered him gone on a vacation and expected  him back when spring roundup approached.    True, he was seldom disappointed in that. For the Happy Family looked  upon the Flying U as home, and six months was about the limit for  straying afar. Cowpunchers to the bone though they were, they bent backs  over irrigating ditches and sweated in the hay fields just for the  sake of staying together on the ranch. I cannot say that they did it  uncomplainingly--for the bunk-house was saturated to the ridge-pole with  their maledictions while they compared blistered hands and pitchfork  callouses, and mourned the days that were gone; the days when they  rode far and free and scorned any work that could not be done from the  saddle. But they stayed, and they did the ranch work as well as the  range work, which is the main point.    They became engaged to certain girls who filled their dreams and  all their waking thoughts--but they never quite came to the point of  marrying and going their way. Except Pink, who did marry impulsively and  unwisely, and who suffered himself to be bullied and called Percy for  seven months or so, and who balked at leaving the Flying U for the city  and a vicarious existence in theaterdom, and so found himself free quite  as suddenly as he had been tied.    They intended to marry and settle down--sometime. But there was always  something in the way of carrying those intentions to fulfillment, so  that eventually the majority of the Happy Family found themselves not  even engaged, but drifting along toward permanent bachelorhood. Being of  the optimistic type, however, they did not worry; Pink having set before  them a fine example of the failure of marriage and having returned with  manifest relief to the freedom of the bunk-house.        CHAPTER 2. ANDY GREEN'S NEW ACQUAINTANCE    Andy Green, chief prevaricator of the Happy Family of the Flying U--and  not ashamed of either title or connection--pushed his new Stetson back  off his untanned forehead, attempted to negotiate the narrow passage  into a Pullman sleeper with his suitcase swinging from his right hand,  and butted into a woman who was just emerging from the dressing-room. He  butted into her so emphatically that he was compelled to swing his left  arm out very quickly, or see her go headlong into the window opposite;  for a fullsized suitcase propelled forward by a muscular young man may  prove a very efficient instrument of disaster, especially if it catches  one just in the hollow back of the knee. The woman tottered and grasped  Andy convulsively to save herself a fall, and so they stood blocking the  passage until the porter arrived and took the suitcase from Andy with a  tip-inviting deference.    Andy apologized profusely, with a quaint, cowpunchery phrasing that  caused the woman to take a second look at him. And, since Andy Green  would look good to any woman capable of recognizing--and appreciating--a  real man when she saw him, she smiled and said it didn't matter in the  least.    That was the beginning of the acquaintance. Andy took her by her plump,  chiffon-veiled arm and piloted her to her seat, and he afterward tipped  the porter generously and had his own belongings deposited in the  section across the aisle. Then, with the"]]]
