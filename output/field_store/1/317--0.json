INTRODUCTION.      Japanning, as it is generally understood in Great Britain, is the art  of covering paper, wood, or metal with a more or less thick coating of  brilliant varnish, and hardening the same by baking it in an oven at a  suitable heat. It originated in Japan--hence its name--where the  natives use a natural varnish or lacquer which flows from a certain  kind of tree, and which on its issuing from the plant is of a creamy  tint, but becomes black on exposure to the air. It is mainly with the  application of \"japan\" to metallic surfaces that we are concerned in  these pages. Japanning may be said to occupy a position midway between  painting and porcelain enamelling, and a japanned surface differs from  an ordinary painted surface in being far more brilliant, smoother,  harder, and more durable, and also in retaining its gloss permanently,  in not being easily injured by hot water or by being placed near a  fire; while real good japanning is characterised by great lustre and  adhesiveness to the metal to which it has been applied, and its  non-liability to chipping--a fault which, as a rule, stamps the common  article.    If the English process of japanning be more simple and produces a  less durable, a less costly coating than the Japanese method, yet its  practice is not so injurious to the health. Indeed, it is a moot point  in how far the Japanese themselves now utilize their classical  process, as the coat of natural japan on all the articles exhibited at  the recent Vienna exhibition as being coated with the natural lacquer,  when recovered after six months' immersion in sea water through the  sinking of the ship, was destroyed, although it stood perfectly well  on the articles of some age. In the English method, where necessary, a  priming or undercoat is employed. It is customary to fill up any  uneven surface, any minute holes or pores, and to render the surface  to be japanned uniformly smooth. But such an undercoat or priming is  not always applied, the coloured varnish or a proper japan ground  being applied directly on the surface to be japanned. Formerly this  surface usually, if not always, received a priming coat, and it does  so still where the surface is coarse, uneven, rough, and porous. But  where the surface is impervious and smooth, as in the case of metallic  surfaces, a priming coat is not applied. It is also unnecessary to  apply such a coat in the case of smooth, compact, grained wood. The  reason for using this coating is that it effects a considerable saving  in the quantity of varnish used, and because the matter of which the  priming is composed renders the surface of the body to be varnished  uniform, and fills up all pores, cracks, and other inequalities, and  by its use it is easy after rubbing and water polishing to produce an  even surface on which to apply the varnish. The previous application  of this undercoat was thus an advantage in the case of coarse, uneven  surfaces that it formed a first and sort of obligatory initial stage  in the process of japanning. This initial coating is still applied in  many instances. But it has its drawbacks, and these drawbacks are  incidental to the nature of the priming coat which consists of size  and whiting. The coats or layers of japan proper, that is of varnish  and pigment applied over such a priming coat, will be continually  liable to crack or peel off with any violent shock, and will not last  nearly so long as articles japanned with the same materials and  altogether in the same way but without the undercoat. This defect may  be readily perceived by comparing goods that have been in use for some  time in the japanning of which an undercoat has been applied with  similar goods in which no such previous coat has been given. Provided  a good japan varnish and appropriate pigments have been used and the  japanning well executed, the coats of japan applied without a priming  never peel or crack or are in any way damaged except by violence or  shock, or that caused by continual ordinary wear and tear caused by  such constant rubbing as will wear away the surface of the japan. But  japan coats applied with a priming coat crack and fly off in flakes at  the slightest concussion, at any knock or fall, more especially at the  edges. Those Birmingham manufacturers who were the first to practise  japanning only on metals on which there was no need for a priming coat  did not of course adopt such a practice. Moreover, they found it  equally unnecessary in the case of papier-mache and some other goods.  Hence Birmingham japanned goods wear better than those goods which  receive a priming previous to japanning.      PRIMING or PREPARING THE SURFACE TO BE JAPANNED.    The usual priming, where one is applied, consists of Paris white  (levigated whiting) made into a thin paste with size. The size should  be of a consistency between the common double size and glue, and mixed  with as much Paris white as will give it a good body so that it will  hide the surface"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15625"],[0,"The Lookout Man (#1)"],[1,"the Online Distributed Proofreading Team at https://www.pgdp.net.              ~By B.

From the obscurity of vast, unquiet distance the surf came booming in  with the heavy impetus of high tide, flinging long streamers of kelp  and bits of driftwood over the narrowing stretch of sand where  garishly costumed bathers had lately shrieked hilariously at their  gambols. Before the chill wind that had risen with the turn of the  tide the bathers retreated in dripping, shivering groups, to appear  later in fluffs and furs and woollen sweaters; still inclined to  hilarity, still undeniably both to leave off their pleasuring at  Venice, dedicated to cheap pleasures.    But when the wind blew stronger and the surf boomed louder and nearer,  and the faint moon-path stretched farther and farther toward the  smudgy sky-line, city-going street-cars began to fill with sunburned  passengers, and motors began to purr out of the narrow side streets  lined with shoddy buildings which housed the summer sojourners. One  more Sunday night's revelry was tapering off into shouted farewells,  clanging gongs, honking horns and the shuffling of tired feet hurrying  homeward.    In cafes and grills and private dining rooms groups of revelers, whose  pleasures were not halted by the nickel alarm-clocks ticking  inexorably all over the city and its suburbs, still lingered long  after the masses had gone home yawning and counting the fullness of  past joys by the present extent of smarting sunblisters.    Automobiles loaded with singing passengers scurried after their own  beams of silver light down the boulevards. At first a continuous line  of speeding cars; then thinning with long gaps between; then longer  gaps with only an occasional car; then the quiet, lasting for minutes  unbroken, so that the wind could be heard in the eucalyptus trees that  here and there lined the boulevard.    After the last street-car had clanged away from the deserted  bunting-draped joy zone that now was stark and joyless, a belated  seven-passenger car, painted a rich plum color and splendid in  upholstering and silver trim, swept a long row of darkened windows  with a brush of light as it swung out from a narrow alley and went  purring down to where the asphalt shone black in the night.    Full throated laughter and a medley of shouted jibes and  current witticisms went with it. The tonneau squirmed with uproarious  youth. The revolving extra seats swung erratically, propelled by  energetic hands, while some one barked the stereotyped invitation to  the deserted scenic swing, and some one else shouted to the revolving  occupants to keep their heads level, and all the others laughed  foolishly.    The revolving ones rebelled, and in the scuffle some one lurched  forward against the driver at a critical turn in the road, throwing  him against the wheel. The big car swerved almost into the ditch, was  brought back just in the nick of time and sped on, while Death, who  had looked into that tonneau, turned away with a shrug.    The driver, bareheaded and with the wind blowing his thick mop of wavy  hair straight back from his forehead, glanced back with swift disfavor  at the scuffling bunch.    \"Hey--you want to go in the ditch?\" he expostulated, chewing  vigorously upon gum that still tasted sweet and full-flavored. \"You  wanta cut out that rough stuff over this way!\"    \"_All_ right, Jackie, old boy, anything to please!\" chanted the  offender, cuffing the cap off the fellow next him. \"Some time,\" he  added with vague relish. \"S-o-m-e time! What?\"    \"Some time is right!\" came the exuberant chorus. \"Hey, Jack! _u_ had  some time, all right--you and that brown-eyed queen that danced like  Mrs. Castle. Um-um! Floatin' round with your arms full of  sunshine--oh, you thought you was puttin' something over on the rest  of us--what?\"    \"Cut it out!\" Jack retorted, flinging the words over his shoulder.  \"Don't talk to me. Road's flopping around like a snake with its head  cut off--\" He laughed apologetically, his eyes staring straight ahead  over the lowered windshield.    \"Aw, step on her, Jack! Show some class, boy--show some class! Good  old boat! If you're too stewed to drive 'er, _e_ knows the way home.  Say, Jackie, if this old car could talk, wouldn't momma get an  ear-full on Monday, hey? What if she--\"    \"Cut it _out_--or I'll throw you out!\" came back over Jack's  shirt-clad shoulder. He at least had the wit to use what little sense  he had in driving the car, and he had plenty of reason to believe that  he could carry out his threat, even if the boulevard did heave itself  up at him like the writhings of a great snake. If his head was not fit  for the job, his trained muscles would still drive with automatic  precision. Only his vision was clouded; not the mechanical skill  necessary to pilot his mother's big car safely into the garage.    Whim held the five in the rear seats absorbed in their own maudlin  comicalities. The fellow beside Jack did not seem to take any interest  in his surroundings, and the five gave the front seat no further  attention. Jack drove circumspectly, leaning a little forward, his  bare arms laid up across the wheel and grasping the top of it. Brown  as bronze, those arms, as were his face and neck and chest down to  where the open V of his sport shirt was held closed with the loose  knot of a crimson tie that whipped his shoulder as he drove. A fine  looking fellow he was, sitting there like the incarnation of strength  and youth and fullblooded optimism. It was a pity that he was  drunk--he would have been a perfect specimen of young manhood, else.    The young man on the front seat beside him turned suddenly on those  behind. The lower half of his face was covered with a black muffler.  He had a gun, and he \"cut down\" on the group with disconcerting  realism.    \"Hands up!\" he intoned fearsomely. \"I am the mysterious lone bandit of  the boulevards. Your jewels are the price of your lives!\" The  six-shooter wavered, looking bleakly at one and then another.    After the first stunned interval, a shout of laughter went up from  those behind. \"Good! Good idea!\" one approved. And another, having some  familiarity with the mechanics of screen melodrama, shouted, \"Camera!\"    \"Lone bandit nothing! We're _all_ mysterious auto bandits out seeking  whom we may devour!\" cried a young man with a naturally attractive  face and beautiful teeth, hastily folding his handkerchief cornerwise  for a mask, and tying it behind his head--to the great discomfort of  his neighbors, who complained bitterly at having their eyes jabbed out  with his elbows.    The bandit play caught the crowd. For a few tumultuous minutes elbows  were up, mufflers and handkerchiefs flapping. There emerged from the  confusion six masked bandits, and three of them flourished  six-shooters with a recklessness that would have given a Texas man  cold chills down his spine. Jack, not daring to take his eyes off the  heaving asphalt, or his hands off the wheel, retained his natural  appearance until some generous soul behind him proceeded, in spite of  his impatient \"Cut it out, fellows!\" to confiscate his flapping, red  tie and bind it across his nose; which transformed Jack Corey into a  speeding fiend, if looks meant anything. Thereafter they threw  themselves back upon the suffering upholstery and commented gleefully  upon their banditish qualifications.    That grew tame, of course. They thirsted for mock horrors,  and two glaring moons rising swiftly over a hill gave the  psychological fillip to their imaginations.    \"Come on-let's hold 'em up!\" cried the young man on the front seat.  \"Naw-I'll tell you! Slow down, Jack, and everybody keep your faces  shut. When we're just past I'll shoot down at the ground by a hind  wheel. Make 'em think they've got a blowout--get the idea?\"    \"Some idea!\" promptly came approval, and the six subsided immediately.    The coming car neared swiftly, the driver shaving as close to the  speed limit as he dared. Unsuspectingly he swerved to give plenty of  space in passing, and as he did so a loud bang startled him. The brake  squealed as he made an emergency stop. \"Blowout, by thunder!\" they  heard him call to his companions, as he piled out and ran"]]]
