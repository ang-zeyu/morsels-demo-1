Were not every chapter of the history of the human mind too precious  an inheritance to be willingly relinquished,--for appalling as its  contents may be, the value of the materials it may furnish may be  inestimable,--we might otherwise be tempted to wish that the miserable  record in which the excesses occasioned by the witch mania are  narrated, could be struck out of its pages, and for ever cancelled.  Most assuredly, he, who is content to take the fine exaggeration of  the author of _Hydriotaphia_ as a serious and literal truth, and who  believes with him that \"man is a glorious animal,\" must not go to the  chapter which contains that record for his evidences and proofs. If he  should be in search of materials for humiliation and abasement, he  will find in the history of witchcraft in this country, from the  beginning to the end of the seventeenth century, large and abundant  materials, whether it affects the species or the individual. In truth,  human nature is never seen in worse colours than in that dark and  dismal review. Childhood, without any of its engaging properties,  appears prematurely artful, wicked and cruel[1]; woman, the victim of  a wretched and debasing bigotry, has yet so little of the feminine  adjuncts, that the fountains of our sympathies are almost closed; and  man, tyrannizing over the sex he was bound to protect, in its helpless  destitution and enfeebled decline, seems lost in prejudice and  superstition and only strong in oppression. If we turn from the common  herd to the luminaries of the age, to those whose works are the  landmarks of literature and science, the reference is equally  disappointing;--        \"The sun itself is dark      And silent as the moon      Hid in her vacant interlunar cave.\"    [Footnote 1: Take, as an instance, the children of Mr. Throgmorton, of  Warbois, for bewitching whom, Mother Samuels, her husband, and  daughter, suffered in 1593. No veteran professors \"in the art of  ingeniously tormenting\" could have administered the question with more  consummate skill than these little incarnate fiends, till the poor old  woman was actually induced, from their confident asseverations and  plausible counterfeiting, to believe at last that she had been a witch  all her life without knowing it. She made a confession, following the  story which they had prompted, on their assurances that it was the  only means to restore them, and then was hanged upon that confession,  to which she adhered on the scaffold. Few tracts present a more vivid  picture of manners than that in which the account of this case of  witchcraft is contained. It is perhaps the rarest of the English  tracts relating to witchcraft, and is entitled \"The most strange and  admirable Discoverie of the three Witches of Warboys, arraigned,  convicted, and executed at the last Assizes at Huntingdon, for the  bewitching of the five daughters of Robert Throckmorton, Esquire, and  divers other persons with sundrie Devilish and grievous torments.

If on the Continent there were, in  the sixteenth century, two men from whom an exposure of the  absurdities of the system of witchcraft might have been naturally and  rationally expected, and who seem to stand out prominently from the  crowd as predestined to that honourable and salutary office, those two  men were John Bodin[11] and Thomas Erastus.[12] The former a  lawyer--much exercised in the affairs of men--whose learning was not  merely umbratic--whose knowledge of history was most philosophic and  exact--of piercing penetration and sagacity--tolerant--liberal  minded--disposed to take no proposition upon trust, but to canvass and  examine every thing for himself, and who had large views of human  nature and society--in fact, the Montesquieu of the seventeenth  century. The other, a physician and professor, sage, judicious,  incredulous,         \"The scourge of impostors, the terror of quacks,\"    who had routed irrecoverably empiricism in almost every  shape--Paracelsians--Astrologers--Alchemists--Rosicrucians--and who  weighed and scrutinized and analyzed every conclusion, from  excommunication and the power of the keys to the revolutions of comets  and their supposed effects on empires, and all with perfect  fearlessness and intuitive insight into the weak points of an  argument. Yet, alas! for human infirmity. Bodin threw all the weight  of his reasoning and learning and vivacity into the scale of the witch  supporters, and made the \"hell-broth boil and bubble\" anew, and  increased the witch _furor_ to downright fanaticism, by the  publication of his _Demo-manie_,[13] a work in which        \"Learning, blinded first and then beguiled,      Looks dark as ignorance, as frenzy wild;\"    but which it is impossible to read without being carried along by the  force of mind and power of combination which the author manifests, and  without feeling how much ingenious sophistry can perform to mitigate  and soften the most startling absurdity. His contemporary, Erastus,  after all his victories on the field of imposition, was foiled by the  subject of witchcraft at last.

The  details of his life are as fully known as we can expect to know them;  his mathematical and physical discoveries have been treated many times;  his religious sentiment and his theological views have been discussed  again and again; and his prose style has been analysed by French critics  down to the finest particular. But Pascal is one of those writers who  will be and who must be studied afresh by men in every generation. It is  not he who changes, but we who change. It is not our knowledge of him  that increases, but our world that alters and our attitudes towards it.  The history of human opinions of Pascal and of men of his stature is a  part of the history of humanity. That indicates his permanent  importance.    The facts of Pascal's life, so far as they are necessary for this brief  introduction to the _Pensees_, are as follows. He was born at Clermont,  in Auvergne, in 1623. His family were people of substance of the upper  middle class. His father was a government official, who was able to  leave, when he died, a sufficient patrimony to his one son and his two  daughters. In 1631 the father moved to Paris, and a few years later took  up another government post at Rouen. Wherever he lived, the elder Pascal  seems to have mingled with some of the best society, and with men of  eminence in science and the arts. Blaise was educated entirely by his  father at home. He was exceedingly precocious, indeed excessively  precocious, for his application to studies in childhood and adolescence  impaired his health, and is held responsible for his death at  thirty-nine. Prodigious, though not incredible stories are preserved,  especially of his precocity in mathematics. His mind was active rather  than accumulative; he showed from his earliest years that disposition to  find things out for himself, which has characterised the infancy of  Clerk-Maxwell and other scientists. Of his later discoveries in physics  there is no need for mention here; it must only be remembered that he  counts as one of the greatest physicists and mathematicians of all time;  and that his discoveries were made during the years when most scientists  are still apprentices.    The elder Pascal, Etienne, was a sincere Christian. About 1646 he fell  in with some representatives of the religious revival within the Church  which has become known as Jansenism--after Jansenius, Bishop of Ypres,  whose theological work is taken as the origin of the movement. This  period is usually spoken of as the moment of Pascal's \"first  conversion.\" The word \"conversion,\" however, is too forcible to be  applied at this point to Blaise Pascal himself. The family had always  been devout, and the younger Pascal, though absorbed in his scientific  work, never seems to have been afflicted with infidelity. His attention  was then directed, certainly, to religious and theological matters; but  the term \"conversion\" can only be applied to his sisters--the elder,  already Madame Perier, and particularly the younger, Jacqueline, who at  that time conceived a vocation for the religious life. Pascal himself  was by no means disposed to renounce the world. After the death of the  father in 1650 Jacqueline, a young woman of remarkable strength and  beauty of character, wished to take her vows as a sister of Port-Royal,  and for some time her wish remained unfulfilled owing to the opposition  of her brother. His objection was on the purely worldly ground that she  wished to make over her patrimony to the Order; whereas while she lived  with him, their combined resources made it possible for him to live more  nearly on a scale of expense congenial to his tastes. He liked, in fact,  not only to mix with the best society, but to keep a coach and  horses--six horses is the number at one time attributed to his carriage.  Though he had no legal power to prevent his sister from disposing of her  property as she elected, the amiable Jacqueline shrank from doing so  without her brother's willing approval. The Mother Superior, Mere  Angelique--herself an eminent personage in the history of this religious  movement--finally persuaded the young novice to enter the order without  the satisfaction of bringing her patrimony with her; but Jacqueline  remained so distressed by this situation that her brother finally  relented.    So far as is known, the worldly life enjoyed by Pascal during this  period can hardly be qualified as \"dissipation,\" and certainly not as  \"debauchery.\" Even gambling may have appealed to him chiefly as  affording a study of mathematical probabilities. He appears to have led  such a life as any cultivated intellectual man of good position and  independent means might lead and consider himself a model of probity and  virtue. Not even a love-affair is laid at his door, though he is said to  have contemplated marriage. But Jansenism, as represented by the  religious society of Port-Royal, was morally a Puritan movement within  the Church, and its standards of conduct were at least as severe as  those of any Puritanism in England or America. The period of fashionable  society, in Pascal's life, is however, of great importance in his  development. It enlarged his knowledge of men and refined his tastes; he  became a man of the world and never lost what he had learnt; and when he  turned his thoughts wholly towards religion, his worldly knowledge was a  part of his composition which is essential to the value of his work.    Pascal's interest in society did not distract him from scientific  research; nor did this period occupy much space in what is a very short  and crowded life. Partly his natural dissatisfaction with such a life,  once he had learned all it had to teach him, partly the influence of his  saintly sister Jacqueline, partly increasing suffering as his health  declined, directed him more and more out of the world and to thoughts of  eternity. And in 1654 occurs what is called his \"second conversion,\" but  which might be called his conversion simply.    He made a note of his mystical experience, which he kept always about  him, and which was found, after his death, sewn into the coat which he  was wearing. The experience occurred on 23 November, 1654, and there is  no reason to doubt its genuineness unless we choose to deny all mystical  experience. Now, Pascal was not a mystic, and his works are not to be  classified amongst mystical writings; but what can only be called  mystical experience happens to many men who do not become mystics. The  work which he undertook soon after, the _Lettres ecrites a un  provincial_, is a masterpiece of religious controversy at the opposite  pole from mysticism. We know quite well that he was at the time when he  received his illumination from God in extremely poor health; but it is a  commonplace that some forms of illness are extremely favourable, not  only to religious illumination, but to artistic and literary  composition. A piece of writing meditated, apparently without progress,  for months or years, may suddenly take shape and word; and in this state  long passages may be produced which require little or no retouch. I have  no good word to say for the cultivation of automatic writing as the  model of literary composition; I doubt whether these moments _can_ be  cultivated by the writer; but he to whom this happens assuredly has the  sensation of being a vehicle rather than a maker. No masterpiece can be  produced whole by such means; but neither does even the higher form of  religious inspiration suffice for the religious life; even the most  exalted mystic must return to the world, and use his reason to employ  the results of his experience in daily life. You may call it communion  with the Divine, or you may call it a temporary crystallisation of the  mind. Until science can teach us to reproduce such phenomena at will,  science cannot claim to have explained them; and they can be judged only  by their fruits.    From that time until his death, Pascal was closely associated with the  society of Port-Royal which his sister Jacqueline, who predeceased him,  had joined as a _religieuse_; the society was then fighting for its life  against the Jesuits. Five propositions, judged by a committee of  cardinals and theologians at Rome to be heretical, were found to be put  forward in the work of Jansenius; and the society of Port-Royal, the  representative of Jansenism among devotional communities, suffered a  blow from which it never revived. It is not the place here to review the  bitter controversy and conflict; the best account, from the point of  view of a critic of genius who took no side, who was neither Jansenist  nor Jesuit, Christian nor infidel, is that in the great book of  Sainte-Beuve, _Port-Royal_. And in this book the parts devoted to Pascal  himself are among the most brilliant pages of criticism that  Sainte-Beuve ever wrote. It is sufficient to notice that the next  occupation of Pascal, after his conversion, was to write these eighteen  \"Letters,\" which as prose are of capital importance in the foundation of  French classical style, and which as polemic are surpassed by none, not  by Demosthenes, or Cicero, or Swift. They have the limitation of all  polemic and forensic: they persuade, they seduce, they are unfair. But  it is also unfair to assert that, in these _Letters to a Provincial_,  Pascal was attacking the Society of Jesus in itself. He was attacking  rather a"]]]
