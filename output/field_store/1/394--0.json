The maps of the Classical Atlas have been scanned at a sufficient  resolution to enable easy reading, but they may not display at an  appropriate scale, depending on screen size, resolution, and window  size; we recommend you use software that allows zooming to view them.    The numbers of the maps given in the Index pages are the same as those  in the list in the main body of the Atlas, allowing cross-reference.    Note that the Latitude and Longitude given in the Index pages are from  Greenwich, while the maps, as common with many of the times, have grids  with Longitudes given both from Greenwich and Ferro. If you use the  latter you won't find your target.          INTRODUCTION    The accompanying Atlas has been included in this series for the greater  convenience of the reader of \"Grote's Greece\" and other works that ask  a continual reference to maps of ancient and classical geography. The  disadvantage of having to turn perpetually from the text of a volume to  a map at its end, or a few pages away, is often enough to prevent the  effective use of the one in elucidating the other. Despite some slight  variations of spelling in the classical place-names used by different  authors, there need be no difficulty in adapting the same Atlas to  various works, whether they are English versions of historians like  Herodotus or Livy, or English histories of the ancient world, such as  Grote's and Gibbon's. Taking the case of Grote, he preferred, as we  know, the use of the \"K\" in Greek names to the usual equivalent \"C,\" and  he retained other special forms of certain words. A comparative list of  a few typical names which appear both in the index to his \"History of  Greece\" in this series, and in the index to the present Atlas, will show  that the variation between the two is regular and, fairly uniform and  easy to remember:      GROTE'S spelling  CLASSICAL ATLAS      GROTE'S SPELLING   CLASSICAL ATLAS    Adrumetum         Hadrumetum           Hydra              Hydrea  AEgean             AEgaean                Iasus              Iassus  Akanthus          Acanthus             Kabala             Cabalia  Akarnania         Acarnania            Nile               Nilus  Akesines          Acesines             Olympieion         Olympieum  Akte              Acte                 Oneium             OEneum  Chaeroneia         Chaeronea             Palike             Palica  Dekeleia          Decelea              Pattala            Patala  Dyrrachium        Dyrrhachium          Peiraeum            Piraeum  Eetioneia         Eetionea             Phyle              Phylae  Egypt             AEgyptus              Pisa               Pisae  Eresus            Eressus              Pylus              Pylos  Erytheia          Erythia              Thessaly           Thessalia  Helus             Helos                Thrace             Thracia      By comparing in the same way the place-names in Gibbon's and other  histories, the reader will need no glossarist in using the Atlas to  lighten their geographical allusions. It is not only when he comes to  actual wars, campaigns and sieges that he will find a working chart  of advantage. When he reads in Grote of the Ionic colonization of Asia  Minor, and wishes to relate the later view of its complex process to the  much simpler account given by Herodotus, he gains equally by having a  map of the region before him.    We realize how Grote himself worked over his topographical notes, eking  out his own observations with map, scale and compass, when we read  his preliminary survey of Greece, in the second volume of his history.  \"Greece proper lies between the 36th and 40th parallels of north  latitude and between the 21st and 26th degrees of east longitude. Its  greatest length, from Mount Olympus to Cape Taenarus, may be stated  at 250 English miles; its greatest breadth, from the western coast of  Akarnania to Marathon in Attica, at 180 miles; and the distance eastward  from Ambrakia across Pindus to the Magnesian mountain Homole and the  mouth of the Peneius is about 120 miles. Altogether its area is somewhat  less than that of Portugal.\" But as to the exact limits of Greece  proper, he points out that these limits seem not to have been very  precisely defined even among the Greeks themselves.    The chain called Olympus and the Cambunian mountains, ranging east and  west and commencing with the AEgean Sea or the Gulf of Therma near the  fortieth degree of north latitude, Grote continues, \"is prolonged  under the name of Mount Lingon until it touches the Adriatic at the  Akrokeraunian promontory. The country south of this chain comprehended  all that in ancient times was regarded as Greece or Hellas proper,  but it also comprehended something more. Hellas proper (or continuous  Hellas, to use the language of Skylax and Dikaearchus) was understood to  begin with the town and Gulf of Ambrakia : from thence northward to  the Akrokeraunian promontory lay the land called by the Greeks Epirus--  occupied by the Chaonians, Molossians, and Thesprotians, who were termed  Epirots and were not esteemed to belong to the Hellenic aggregate.\"    Beside this survey of Hellas proper or continuous Hellas, as Grote  presented it, he set the word-map of Italy that Gibbon draws--Italy  changing its face under the Roman civilization: \"Before the Roman  conquest, the country which is now called Lombardy was not considered  as a part of Italy. It had been occupied by a powerful colony of Gauls,  who, settling themselves along the banks of the Po, from Piedmont to  Romagna, carried their arms and diffused their name from the Alps to the  Apennine. The Ligurians dwelt on the rocky coast, which now forms the  republic of Genoa. Venice was yet unborn; but the territories of  that state, which lie to the east of the Adige, were habited by the  Venetians. The middle part of the peninsula, that now composes the duchy  of Tuscany and the ecclesiastical state, was the ancient seat of the  Etruscans and Umbrians; to the former of whom Italy was indebted for the  first rudiments of a civilized life. The Tiber rolled at the foot of the  seven hills of Rome, and the country of the Sabines, the Latins, and the  Volsci, from that river to the frontiers of Naples, was the theatre  of her infant victories. On that celebrated ground the first consuls  deserved triumphs, their successors adorned villas, and their posterity  have erected convents. Capua and Campania possessed the immediate  territory of Naples; the rest of the kingdom was inhabited by many  warlike nations, the Marsi, the Samnites, the Apulians, and the  Lucanians; and the sea-coasts had been covered by the flourishing  colonies of the Greeks. We may remark, that when Augustus divided Italy  into eleven regions, the little province of Istria was annexed to that  seat of Roman sovereignty.\"    As we see by this topical extract, Gibbon's practice in the use of Latin  place-names is very much freer than Grote's in the use of the Greek. A  few comparative instances from the Atlas will suffice:      Gibbon's spelling   Classical Atlas     Gibbon's spelling    Classical Atlas    Antioch             Antiochia           Naples               Neapolis prius  Apennines           Apenninus                                      Parthenope  Dardenellcs         Hellespontus        Osrhoene             Osroene  Ctesiphon           Ctesipon            Thrace               Thracia  Egypt               AEgyptus             Ostia                Ostia  Gau1                Gaula               Cordova              Corduba  Genoa               Genua      Among other works which the present Atlas will help to illustrate,  editions of Gibbon's \"Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire,\" and  of Merivale's Roman History which leads up to it, are already in  preparation; it is hoped to publish in the series also an edition of  Herodotus, the father of the recorders of history and geography, who  realized almost as well as did Freeman the application of the two  records, one to another. The good service of the Classical Atlas,  however is not defined by any possible extension of Everyman's Library.  The maps of Palestine in the time of our Lord and under the older Jewish  dispensation, of Africa and of Egypt, and that, now newly added, of the  Migrations of the Barbarians, and the full index, give it the value of  a gazetteer in brief of the ancient world, well adapted to come into the  general use of schools where an inexpensive work of the kind in compact  form has long been needed.    The present Atlas has the advantage of being the result of the  successive labour of many hands. Its original author was Dr. Samuel  Butler, sometime head-master of Shrewsbury school and afterwards Bishop  of Lichfield and Coventry. He edited Aeschylus, and was in his way a  famous geographer. The work was at a later date twice revised, and its  maps were re-drawn, under the editorship of his son. It has now been  again revised and enlarged to suit the special needs of this series.

Every one will admire Champlain's disinterested actions, his courage,  his loyalty, his charity, and all those noble and magnificent qualities  which are rarely found united in one individual in so prominent a  degree. We cannot overpraise that self-abnegation which enabled him to  bear without complaint the ingratitude of many of his interpreters, and  the servants of the merchants; nor can we overlook, either, the charity  which he exercised towards the aborigines and new settlers; the  protection which he afforded them under trying circumstances, or his  zeal in promoting the honour and glory of God, and his respect for the  Recollet and Jesuit fathers who honoured him with their cordial  friendship. His wisdom is evidenced in such a practical fact as his  choice of Quebec as the capital of New France, despite the rival claims  of Montreal and Three Rivers, and his numerous writings reveal him to us  as a keen and sagacious observer, a man of science and a skilful and  intrepid mariner. As a cosmographer, Champlain added yet another laurel  to his crown, for he excelled all his predecessors, both by the ample  volume of his descriptions and by the logical arrangement of the  geographical data which he supplied. The impetus which he gave to  cartographical science can scarcely be overestimated.    Naturalist, mariner, geographer, such was Samuel Champlain, and to a  degree remarkable for the age in which he lived. It is, perhaps,  unnecessary to dwell upon the morality of the virtuous founder. The  testimony of the Hurons, who, twenty years after his death, still  pointed to the life of Champlain as a model of all Christian virtues, is  sufficient, and it is certain that no governor under the old regime  presented a more brilliant example of faith, piety, uprightness, or  soundness of judgment. A brief outline of the character of Champlain has  been given in order that the plan of this biography may be better  understood. Let us now glance at his career more in detail.    Before becoming the founder of colonies, Champlain entered the French  army, where he devoted himself to the religion of his ancestors. This  was the first important step in his long and eventful career. A martial  life, however, does not appear to have held out the same inducements as  that of a mariner. An opportunity was presented which enabled him to  gratify his tastes, when the Spanish government sent out an armada to  encounter the English in the Gulf of Mexico. Champlain was given the  command of a ship in this expedition, but his experience during the war  served rather as an occasion to develop his genius as a mariner and  cosmographer, than to add to his renown as a warrior.    God, who in His providence disposes of the lives of men according to His  divine wisdom, directed the steps of Champlain towards the shores of the  future New France. If the mother country had not completely forgotten  this land of ours, discovered by one of her greatest captains, she had,  at least, neglected it. The honour of bringing the king's attention to  this vast country, which was French by the right of discovery, was  reserved for the modest son of Brouage.    While Pierre du Gua, Sieur de Monts, was wasting his years and expending  large sums of money in his fruitless efforts to colonize the island of  Ste. Croix and Port Royal, Champlain's voyage to Acadia and his  discovery of the New England coast were practically useful, and in  consequence Champlain endeavoured to assure de Monts that his own  efforts would be more advantageously directed to the shores of the St.  Lawrence, for here it was obvious that the development of the country  must commence.    Champlain's next step was to found Quebec. With this act began our  colonial history, the foundation of a Canadian people with its long line  of heroic characters distinguished by their simplicity and by their  adherence to the faith of their fathers. Quebec was founded, but nothing  more was accomplished at the moment owing to the lack of means. The  trials of Champlain now commenced. Day by day he had to contend against  his own countrymen. The attractions of fur trading were too great for  the merchants to induce them to settle down and develop the country  around them, and they were unwilling to fulfil their promises or to act  in accordance with the terms of their patents.    During the next twenty years Champlain crossed the ocean eighteen times.  Each voyage was made in the interest of the colony, and he sought by  every means in his power, by prayers and petitions, to obtain the  control of the commerce of the country so as to make it beneficial to  all. In spite of his extraordinary exertions and the force of his will,  he foresaw the fatal issue of his labours.    The settlers were few in number, bread and provisions were scarce, and  the condition of the infant colony was truly deplorable. At this  distressing period a British fleet arrived in the harbour of Quebec.  What was to be done? The rude fortress of St. Louis could not withstand  the assault of an armed fleet, even if it were well defended. But  Champlain had no ammunition, and he, therefore, adopted the only course  open to him of capitulating and handing over the keys of the fort to the  commander, Kirke. Champlain then left Quebec and returned to France.  Bitter was this journey to him, for it was like passing into exile to  see the familiar heights of Quebec fade into the distance, the city of  his foundation and the country of his adoption.    We have an idea of his sorrow during the three years that England  maintained supremacy in Canada, for he says that the days were as long  as months. During his enforced sojourn in France, Champlain exerted all  his energies to revive interest in the abandoned colony. His plan was to  recover the country by all means. Finally success crowned his efforts,  and the treaty of St. Germain-en-Laye gave back to France the young  settlement. Champlain recrossed the sea and planted the lily banner of  France upon the heights of Cape Diamond.    In the year 1635 Champlain was taken ill, and died on Christmas Day,  after having devoted forty years of his life to the promotion of the  religion and commercial interests of the land of his ancestors, but he  bequeathed to the Canadian people the priceless heritage of Quebec, and  the memory of a pure and honest heart.    Before Champlain's death, however, Quebec had commenced to develop. On  the Beauport coast might be seen the residences of many of the settlers  who arrived from the province of Perche in 1634. On the shores of the  river Lairet, the Jesuits had built a convent, where the young Indians  received instruction; and agriculture had received some attention.  Robert Giffard had established a colony at Beauport which formed the  nucleus of a population in this section of the country. Near Fort St.  Louis the steeple of Notre Dame de la Recouvrance gave witness that  Champlain had fulfilled his promise to build a church at Quebec if the  country was restored to her ancient masters.    The colony was now entering upon an era of prosperity, and that harmony  and happiness which Champlain had longed for in his life, and which  occupied his thoughts even in death, were destined to be realized.                                                      N.E.D.          CHAPTER I    CHAMPLAIN'S FIRST VOYAGE TO AMERICA      Samuel Champlain, the issue of the marriage of Antoine Champlain and  Marguerite Le Roy, was born at Brouage, now Hiers Brouage, a small  village in the province of Saintonge, France, in the year 1570, or  according to the _Biographie Saintongeoise_ in 1567. His parents  belonged to the Catholic religion, as their first names would seem to  indicate.    When quite young Samuel Champlain was entrusted to the care of the  parish priest, who imparted to him the elements of education and  instilled his mind with religious principles. His youth appears to have  glided quietly away, spent for the most part with "]]]
