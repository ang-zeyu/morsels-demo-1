The material presented in this paper was obtained, for the most part,  during a stay of seven months among the tribes of Davao District in  Southern Mindanao of the Philippine Islands. Previous to this I had  spent a like period studying the Bukidnon, of the North-Central part of  the Island, and while thus engaged, had penetrated to within about fifty  miles of the Gulf of Davao. In order to trace migrations, relationships,  and trade routes, it was determined to continue the work from the Gulf  coast toward the interior. In pursuance of this plan I went to Davao in  July, nineteen hundred and ten.    All information to be secured from publications, settlers, or natives  was to the effect that there were at least fourteen distinct tribes to  be met with in the Gulf region. The preliminary reconnaissance of the  field made it plain that the earlier classifications were greatly at  fault. Several divisions recognized as tribes were found to be only  dialect groups, while others differing in no essential respects from one  another secured names from the districts in which they resided. It was  also found that in recent years there had been a considerable movement  of the hill people toward the coast, and that in some places they had  penetrated and established themselves in the territory formerly held by  other tribes.    The capture of slaves, intermarriage, and trade between the groups have  been powerful influences in obliterating tribal lines, thus adding  further confusion to the classification of the people.    The field offered so much of interest that I determined to make detailed  studies of the various tribes encountered. The work progressed  satisfactorily for seven months, when a severe illness caused me to  leave the tropics for a time, at least. As a result the work with the  Gulf tribes is still far from complete. The tribes living on or near the  upper waters of the Agusan river and north of Compostela were not  visited, and, hence, will not be mentioned here, while certain other  divisions received only scant attention. No attempt is here made to  treat of the Christianized or Mohammedanized people, who inhabit a  considerable part of the coast and the Samal Islands, further than to  indicate their influence on the wild tribes. Both have settled in Davao  District in historic times, and have taken many native converts into  their villages. From these settlements new ideas, types of garments, and  industries have spread toward the interior, while the extensive slave  trade carried on by the Moro has had a marked effect on all the tribes  with whom they have come in contact.    In the preparation of this paper I have, so far as possible, drawn on  the knowledge of others to fill in the gaps in my own notes. In spite of  this the information on certain groups is still so scanty that this can  be, at best, only a sketch. It is offered at this time in the hope that  it may serve as a help to other anthropologists who may plan to visit  this most interesting field.    I wish here to extend my thanks to the various civil and military  authorities who gave me valuable assistance; also to Captain James  Burchfield, H. S. Wilson, James Irwin, Otto Hanson, William Gohn, Henry  Hubbell, and Juan de la Cruz, planters, whose wide knowledge of, and  acquaintance with the interior tribes made possible my work in many  localities.    It is a pleasure and a duty to acknowledge the assistance rendered by my  wife, who accompanied me throughout my Philippine work. Her presence  made it possible to secure the complete confidence of the hill people,  and thus to gain an insight into their home life which otherwise would  have been impossible. A large part of the material here presented,  particularly that relating to the women, was gathered by her and many of  the photographs are from her camera.    The dialects spoken by the tribes of central and southern Mindanao are  to be dealt with in a separate publication, so that at this time I shall  merely give a brief description of the characters appearing in the  native names used in this paper. The consonants are pronounced as in  English, except _r_ which is as in Spanish. _c_ is used as _ch_ in  _church_, _~n_, which occurs frequently, is a palatal nasal. There is no  clear articulation and the stop is not present, but the back of the  tongue is well up on the soft palate.    The vowels are used as follows:  _macron-a_ like _a_ in _father_  _macron-e_ like _a_ in _fate_  _macron-i_ like _i_ in _ravine_  _macron-o_ like _o_ in _note_  _macron-u_ like _u_ in _flute_  _a_, _e_, _i_, _o_, _u_, short of the above.    [Transcribers' note: The macron-over-vowel orthographic symbols have  regretfully been irreproducible in this document.]    _E_ is a sound between the obscure vowel _e_, as _e_ in _sun_, and the  _ur_ in _burrow_.    The dipthongs[sic] are _ai_ like _ai_ in _aisle_, _au_ like _ou_ in  _mouse_, or final Spanish _ao_ as in _carabao_, _ei_ like _ei_ in  _eight_, _oi_ as in _boy_, also _Eu_, _eu_, etc.    FAY-COOPER COLE,  Assistant Curator of Malayan Ethnology.

The west coast of Davao Gulf between Daliao and Digos is dotted with  small villages, the inhabitants of which are largely Bagobo who have  been converted to the Christian faith and have been induced to give up  their mountain homes and settle in towns. Back of this coast line rise  densely timbered mountain peaks, lateral spurs from which often  terminate in abrupt cliffs overlooking the sea. From other peaks  extensive grass covered plains slope gently down nearly to the water's  edge. Deep river canons cut between these mountains and across the  plains, giving"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18274"],[0,"A Book of Natural History (#1)"],[1,"the Online Distributed Proofreading Team at  http://www.pgdp.net                 +--------------------------------------------------------------+     |                         YOUNG FOLKS'                         |     |                                                              |     |                           LIBRARY                            |     |                                                              |     |                                                              |     |    SELECTIONS FROM THE CHOICEST LITERATURE OF ALL LANDS:     |     |       FOLK-LORE, FAIRY TALES, FABLES, LEGENDS, NATURAL       |     |           HISTORY, WONDERS OF EARTH, SEA AND SKY,            |     |           ANIMAL STORIES, SEA TALES, BRAVE DEEDS,            |     |             EXPLORATIONS, STORIES OF SCHOOL AND              |     |                   COLLEGE LIFE, BIOGRAPHY,                   |     |                      HISTORY, PATRIOTIC                      |     |                      ELOQUENCE, POETRY                       |     |                                                              |     |                                                              |     |                        THIRD EDITION                         |     |                                                              |     |                   REVISED IN CONFERENCE BY                   |     |                                                              |     |           THOMAS BAILEY ALDRICH, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF,            |     |               PRESIDENT WILLIAM JEWETT TUCKER,               |     |                 HAMILTON WRIGHT MABIE, HENRY                 |     |                VAN DYKE, NATHAN HASKELL DOLE                 |     |                                                              |     |                                                              |     |           _TWENTY VOLUMES_   _RICHLY ILLUSTRATED_            |     |                                                              |     |                            BOSTON                            |     |                    HALL AND LOCKE COMPANY                    |     |                          PUBLISHERS                          |     |                                                              |     +--------------------------------------------------------------+                                     COPYRIGHT, 1902,                         BY HALL & LOCKE COMPANY.
