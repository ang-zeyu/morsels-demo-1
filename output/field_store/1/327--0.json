THE CRY FOR VENGEANCE            CHAPTER I    IN THE STORM      The horseman rode slowly toward the west, stopping once or twice to  examine the wide circle of the horizon with eyes that were trained to  note every aspect of the wilderness. On his right the plains melted away  in gentle swell after swell, until they met the horizon. Their brown  surface was broken only by the spiked and thorny cactus and stray bits  of chaparral.    On his left was the wide bed of a river which flowed through the sand,  breaking here and there into several streams, and then reuniting, only  to scatter its volume a hundred yards further into three or four  channels. A bird of prey flew on strong wing over the water, dipped and  then rose again, but there was no other sign of life. Beyond, the  country southward rolled away, gray and bare, sterile and desolate.    The horseman looked most often into the south. His glances into the  north were few and brief, but his eyes dwelled long on the lonely land  that lay beyond the yellow current. His was an attractive face. He was  young, only a boy, but the brow was broad and high, and the eyes, grave  and steady, were those of one who thought much. He was clad completely  in buckskin, and his hat was wide of brim. A rifle held in one hand lay  across the pommel of his saddle and there were weapons in his belt. Two  light, but warm, blankets, folded closely, were tied behind him. The  tanned face and the lithe, strong figure showed a wonderful degree of  health and strength.    Several hours passed and the horseman rode on steadily though slowly.  His main direction was toward the west, and always he kept the river two  or three hundred yards on his left. He never failed to search the plains  on either side, but chiefly in the south, with the eager, intent gaze  that missed nothing. But the lonesome gray land, cut by the coiling  yellow river, still rolled before him, and its desolation and chill  struck to his heart. It was the depth of the Texan winter, and, at  times, icy gusts, born in far mountains, swept across the plains.    The rider presently turned his horse toward the river and stopped on a  low bluff overlooking it. His face showed a tinge of disappointment, as  if his eyes failed to find objects for which they sought. Again he gazed  long and patiently into the south, but without reward.    He resumed his ride parallel with the river, but soon stopped a second  time, and held up an open hand, like one who tests the wind. The air was  growing perceptibly colder. The strong gusts were now fusing into a  steady wind. The day, which had not been bright at any time, was turning  darker. The sun was gone and in the far north banks of mists and vapor  were gathering. A dreary moaning came over the plain.    Ned Fulton, tried and brave though he was, beheld the omens with alarm.  He knew what they portended, and in all that vast wilderness he was  alone. Not a human being to share the danger with him! Not a hand to  help!    He looked for chaparral, something that might serve as a sort of  shelter, but he had left the last clump of it behind, and now he turned  and rode directly north, hoping that he might find some deep depression  between the swells where he and his horse, in a fashion, could hide.    Meanwhile the Norther came down with astonishing speed. The temperature  fell like a plummet. The moan of the wind rose to a shriek, and cold  clouds of dust were swept against Ned and his horse. Then snow mingled  with the dust and both beat upon them. Ned felt his horse shivering  under him, and he shivered, too, despite his will. It had turned so dark  that he could no longer tell where he was going, and he used the wide  brim of his hat to protect himself from the sand.    Soon it was black as night, and the snow was driving in a hurricane. The  wind, unchecked by forest or hill, screamed with a sound almost human.  Ned dismounted and walked in the lee of his horse. The animal turned his  head and nuzzled his master, as if he could give him warmth.    Ned hoped that the storm would blow itself out in an hour or two, but  his hope was vain. The darkness did not abate. The wind rose instead of  falling, and the snow thickened. It lay on the plain several inches  deep, and the walking grew harder. At last the two, the boy and the  horse, stopped. Ned knew that they had come into some kind of a  depression, and the full force of the hurricane passed partly over their  heads.    It was yet very dark, and the driving snow scarcely permitted him to  open his eyes, but by feeling about a little he found that one side of  the dip was covered with a growth of dwarf bushes. He led the horse into  the lower edge of these, where some protection was secured, and,  crouching once more in the lee of the animal, he unfolded the two  blankets, which he wrapped closely about himself to the eyes.    Ned, for the first time since the Norther rushed down upon him, felt  secure. He would not freeze to death, he would escape the fate that  sometimes overtook lone hunters or travelers upon those vast plains.  Warmth from the blankets began gradually to replace the chill in his  bones, and the horse and the bushes together protected his face from the  driven snow which had been cutting like hail. He even had, in some  degree, the sense of comfort which one feels when safe inside four walls  with a storm raging past the windows. The horse whinnied once and rubbed  his nose against Ned's hand. He, too, had ceased to shiver.    All that afternoon the Norther blew with undiminished violence. After a  while the fall of snow thinned somewhat, but the wind did not decrease.  Ned was devoutly thankful for the dip and the bushes that grew within  it. Nor was he less thankful for the companionship of his horse. It was  a good horse, a brave horse, a great bay mustang, built powerfully and  with sinews and muscles of steel. He had secured him just after taking  part in the capture of San Antonio with his comrades, Obed White and the  Ring Tailed Panther, and already the tie between horse and rider had  become strong and enduring. Ned stroked him again, and the horse,  twisting his neck around, thrust his nose under his arm.    \"Good old boy! Good fellow!\" said Ned, pinching his ear. \"We were lucky,  you and I, to find this place.\"    The horse neighed ever so gently, and rubbed his nose up and down. After  a while the darkness began to increase. Ned knew that it was not a new  development of the storm, but the coming of night, and he grew anxious  again. He and his horse, however secure at the present moment, could not  stay always in that dip among the bushes. Yet he did not dare to leave  it. Above on the plain they would receive the full sweep of the wind,  which was still bitterly cold.    He was worn by the continued buffetings of blast and snow, but he did  not dare to lie down, even in the blankets, lest he never wake again,  and while he considered he saw darker shadows in the darkness above him.  He gazed, all attention, and counted ten shadows, following one another,  a dusky file. He knew by the set of their figures, short and stocky,  that they were Mexicans, and his heart beat heavily. These were the  first Mexicans that any one had seen on Texan soil since the departure  of Cos and his army on parole from captured San Antonio. So the Mexicans  had come back, and no doubt they would return in great force!    Ned crouched lower, and he was very glad that the nose of the horse was  still under his arm. He would not have a chance to whinny to his kind  that bore the Mexicans. But the horse made no attempt to move, and Ned  watched them pass on and out of sight. He had not heard the sound of  footsteps or voices above the wind, and after they were gone it seemed  to him that he had seen a line of phantoms.    But he was sure that his own mortal eyes had beheld that for which he  was looking. He and his comrades had been watching the Rio Grande to see  whether the Mexicans had crossed, and now he at least knew it.    He waited patiently three or four hours longer, until the wind died and  the fall of snow ceased, when he mounted his horse and rode out of the  dip. The wind suddenly sprang up again in about fifteen minutes, but  now it blew from the south and was warm. The darkness thinned away as  the moon and stars came out in a perfect sky of southern blue. The  temperature rose many degrees in an hour and Ned knew that the snow  would melt fast. All danger of freezing was past, but he was as hungry  as a bear and tired to death.    He unwrapped the blankets from his body, folded them again in a small  package which he made fast to his"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15770"],[0,"Germany, The Next Republic?

ACKERMAN    New York  George H. Doran Company    1917                The title \"GERMANY, THE NEXT REPUBLIC?\" is chosen because the author  believes this must be the goal, the battlecry, of the United States and  her Allies.  As long as the Kaiser, his generals and the present  leaders are in control of Germany's destinies the world will encounter  the same terrorism that it has had to bear during the war.  Permanent  peace will follow the establishment of a Republic.  But the German  people will not overthrow the present government until the leaders are  defeated and discredited.  Today the Reichstag Constitutional  committee, headed by Herr Scheidemann, is preparing reforms in the  organic law but so far all proposals are mere makeshifts.  The world  cannot afford to consider peace with Germany until the people rule.  The sooner the United States and her Allies tell this to the German  people officially the sooner we shall have peace.            [Frontispiece: A document circulated by \"The League of Truth\"]            PREFACE    I was at the White House on the 29th of June, 1914, when the newspapers  reported the assassination of the Archduke and Archduchess of Austria.  In August, when the first declarations of war were received, I was  assigned by the United Press Associations to \"cover\" the belligerent  embassies and I met daily the British, French, Belgian, Italian,  German, Austro-Hungarian, Turkish and Japanese diplomats.  When  President Wilson went to New York, to Rome, Georgia, to Philadephia and  other cities after the outbreak of the war, I accompanied him as one of  the Washington correspondents.  On these journeys and in Washington I  had an opportunity to observe the President, to study his methods and  ideas, and to hear the comment of the European ambassadors.    When the von Tirpitz blockade of England was announced in February,  1915, I was asked to go to London where I remained only one month.  From March, 1915, until the break in diplomatic relations I was the war  correspondent for the United Press within the Central Powers.  In  Berlin, Vienna and Budapest, I met the highest government officials,  leading business men and financiers.  I knew Secretaries of State Von  Jagow and Zimmermann; General von Kluck, who drove the German first  army against Paris in August, 1914; General von Falkenhayn, former  Chief of the General Staff; Philip Scheidemann, leader of the Reichstag  Socialists; Count Stefan Tisza, Minister President of Hungary and Count  Albert Apponyi.    While my headquarters were in Berlin, I made frequent journeys to the  front in Belgium, France, Poland, Russia and Roumania.  Ten times I was  on the battlefields during important military engagements.  Verdun, the  Somme battlefield, General Brusiloff's offensive against Austria and  the invasion of Roumania, I saw almost as well as a soldier.    After the sinking of the _Lusitania_ and the beginning of critical  relations with the United States I was in constant touch with James W.  Gerard, the American Ambassador, and the Foreign Office.  I followed  closely the effects of American political intervention until February  10th, 1917.  Frequent visits to Holland and Denmark gave me the  impressions of those countries regarding President Wilson and the  United States.  En route to Washington with Ambassador Gerard, I met in  Berne, Paris and Madrid, officials and people who interpreted the  affairs in these countries.    So, from the beginning of the war until today, I have been at the  strategic points as our relations with Germany developed and came to a  climax.  At the beginning of the war I was sympathetic with Germany,  but my sympathy changed to disgust as I watched developments in Berlin  change the German people from world citizens to narrow-minded,  deceitful tools of a ruthless government.  I saw Germany outlaw  herself.  I saw the effects of President Wilson's notes.  I saw the  anti-American propaganda begin.  I saw the Germany of 1915 disappear.  I saw the birth of lawless Germany.    In this book I shall try to take the reader from Washington to Berlin  and back again, to show the beginning and the end of our diplomatic  relations with the German government.  I believe that the United States  by two years of patience and note-writing, has done more to accomplish  the destruction of militarism and to encourage freedom of thought in  Germany than the Allies did during nearly three years of fighting.  The  United States helped the German people think for themselves, but being  children in international affairs, the people soon accepted the  inspired thinking of the government.  Instead of forcing their opinions  upon the rulers until results were evident, they chose to follow with  blind faith their military gods.    The United States is now at war with Germany because the Imperial  Government willed it.  The United States is at war to aid the movement  for democracy in Germany; to help the German people realize that they  must think for themselves.  The seeds of democratic thought which  Wilson's notes sowed in Germany are growing.  If the Imperial  Government had not frightened the people into a belief that too much  thinking would be dangerous for the Fatherland, the United States would  not today be at war with the Kaiser's government.  Only one thing now  will make the people realize that they must think for themselves if  they wish to exist as a nation and as a race.  That is a military  defeat, a defeat on the battlefields of the Kaiser, von Hindenburg and  the Rhine Valley ammunition interests.  Only a decisive defeat will  shake the public confidence in the nation's leaders.  Only a destroyed  German army leadership will make the people overthrow the group of men  who do Germany's political thinking to-day.                C. W. A.

CHAPTER I    MOBILIZATION OF PUBLIC OPINION    I    The Haupttelegraphenamt (the Chief Telegraph Office) in Berlin is the  centre of the entire telegraph system of Germany.  It is a large, brick  building in the Franzoesischestrasse guarded, day and night, by  soldiers.  The sidewalks outside the building are barricaded.  Without  a pass no one can enter.  Foreign correspondents in Berlin, when they  had telegrams to send to their newspapers, frequently took them from  the Foreign Office to the Chief Telegraph Office personally in order to  speed them on their way to the outside world.  The censored despatches  were sealed in a Foreign Office envelope.  With this credential  correspondents were permitted to enter the building and the room where  all telegrams are passed by the military authorities.    During my two years' stay in Berlin I went to the telegraph office  several times every week.  Often I had to wait while the military  censor read my despatches.  On a large bulletin board in this room, I  saw, and often read, documents posted for the information of the  telegraph officials.  During one of my first"]]]
