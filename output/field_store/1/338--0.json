It was the intention  of the editors to include no poem which did not possess  distinct literary value. On the other hand, some of the  most famous Spanish lyrics do not seem apt to awaken the  interest of the average student: it is for this reason  that scholars will miss the names of certain eminent poets  of the _siglo de oro_. The nineteenth century, hardly  inferior in merit and nearer to present-day readers in  thought and language, is much more fully represented.  No apology is needed for the inclusion of poems by  Spanish-American writers, for they will bear comparison  both in style and thought with the best work from the  mother Peninsula.    The Spanish poems are presented chronologically, according  to the dates of their authors. The Spanish-American poems  are arranged according to countries and chronologically  within those divisions. Omissions are indicated by rows of  dots and are due in all cases to the necessity of bringing  the material within the limits of a small volume. Three  poems (the _Fiesta de toros_ of Moratin, the _Castellano  leal_ of Rivas and the _Leyenda_ of Zorrilla) are more  narrative than lyric. The _romances_ selected are              Page iv  the most lyrical of their kind. A few songs have been  added to illustrate the relation of poetry to music.    The editors have been constantly in consultation in all  parts of the work, but the preparation of the _Prosody_,  the _Notes_ (including articles on Spanish-American  literature) and the part of the _Introduction_ dealing  with the nineteenth century, was undertaken by Mr. Hills,  while Mr. Morley had in charge the _Introduction_ prior  to 1800, and the _Vocabulary_.

Such is certainly the case in  Spain. Numerous popular epics of much merit existed there  in the Middle Ages.[1] Of a popular lyric there are few  traces in the same period; and the Castilian lyric as an  art-form reached its height in the sixteenth, and again in  the nineteenth, centuries. It is necessary always to bear  in mind the distinction between the mysterious product  called popular poetry, which is continually being created  but seldom finds its way into the annals of literature,  and artistic poetry. The chronicler of the Spanish lyric  is concerned with the latter almost exclusively, though he  will have occasion to mention the former not infrequently  as the basis of some of the best artificial creations.    [Footnote 1: The popular epics were written in assonating  lines of variable length. There were also numerous monkish  narrative poems _(mester de clerecia)_ in stanzas of four  Alexandrine lines each, all riming _(cuaderna via)_.]    If one were to enumerate _ab origine_ the lyric  productions of the Iberian Peninsula he might begin  with the vague references of Strabo to the songs of its  primitive inhabitants, and then pass on to Latin               page xii  poets of Spanish birth, such as Seneca, Lucan and Martial.  The later Spaniards who wrote Christian poetry in Latin,  as Juvencus and Prudentius, might then be considered. But  in order not to embrace many diverse subjects foreign  to the contents of this collection, we must confine our  inquiry to lyric production in the language of Castile,  which became the dominating tongue of the Kingdom of  Spain.    Such a restriction excludes, of course, the Arabic lyric,  a highly artificial poetry produced abundantly by the  Moors during their occupation of the south of Spain; it  excludes also the philosophical and religious poetry of  the Spanish Jews, by no means despicable in thought or  form.

INTRODUCTION    A certain degree of success, real or supposed, in the delineation of  Queen Mary, naturally induced the author to attempt something similar  respecting \"her sister and her foe,\" the celebrated Elizabeth. He  will not, however, pretend to have approached the task with the same  feelings; for the candid Robertson himself confesses having felt the  prejudices with which a Scottishman is tempted to regard the subject;  and what so liberal a historian avows, a poor romance-writer dares not  disown. But he hopes the influence of a prejudice, almost as natural to  him as his native air, will not be found to have greatly affected the  sketch he has attempted of England's Elizabeth. I have endeavoured  to describe her as at once a high-minded sovereign, and a female of  passionate feelings, hesitating betwixt the sense of her rank and  the duty she owed her subjects on the one hand, and on the other her  attachment to a nobleman, who, in external qualifications at least,  amply merited her favour. The interest of the story is thrown upon that  period when the sudden death of the first Countess of Leicester seemed  to open to the ambition of her husband the opportunity of sharing the  crown of his sovereign.    It is possible that slander, which very seldom favours the memories  of persons in exalted stations, may have blackened the character of  Leicester with darker shades than really belonged to it. But the almost  general voice of the times attached the most foul suspicions to the  death of the unfortunate Countess, more especially as it took place so  very opportunely for the indulgence of her lover's ambition. If we can  trust Ashmole's Antiquities of Berkshire, there was but too much ground  for the traditions which charge Leicester with the murder of his wife.  In the following extract of the passage, the reader will find the  authority I had for the story of the romance:--    \"At the west end of the church are the ruins of a manor, anciently  belonging (as a cell, or place of removal, as some report) to the  monks of Abington. At the Dissolution, the said manor, or lordship, was  conveyed to one--Owen (I believe), the possessor of Godstow then.    \"In the hall, over the chimney, I find Abington arms cut in  stone--namely, a patonee between four martletts; and also another  escutcheon--namely, a lion rampant, and several mitres cut in stone  about the house. There is also in the said house a chamber called  Dudley's chamber, where the Earl of Leicester's wife was murdered, of  which this is the story following:--    \"Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester, a very goodly personage, and  singularly well featured, being a great favourite to Queen Elizabeth,  it was thought, and commonly reported, that had he been a bachelor or  widower, the Queen would have made him her husband; to this end, to free  himself of all obstacles, he commands, or perhaps, with fair flattering  entreaties, desires his wife to repose herself here at his servant  Anthony Forster's house, who then lived in the aforesaid manor-house;  and also prescribes to Sir Richard Varney (a prompter to this design),  at his coming hither, that he should first attempt to poison her, and if  that did not take effect, then by any other way whatsoever to dispatch  her. This, it seems, was proved by the report of Dr. Walter Bayly,  sometime fellow of New College, then living in Oxford, and professor of  physic in that university; whom, because he would not consent to take  away her life by poison, the Earl endeavoured to displace him the court.  This man, it seems, reported for most certain that there was a practice  in Cumnor among the conspirators, to have poisoned this poor innocent  lady, a little before she was killed, which was attempted after this  manner:--They seeing the good lady sad and heavy (as one that well  knew, by her other handling, that her death was not far off), began to  persuade her that her present disease was abundance of melancholy and  other humours, etc., and therefore would needs counsel her to take some  potion, which she absolutely refusing to do, as still suspecting the  worst; whereupon they sent a messenger on a day (unawares to her) for  Dr. Bayly, and entreated him to persuade her to take some little potion  by his direction, and they would fetch the same at Oxford; meaning to  have added something of their own for her comfort, as the doctor  upon just cause and consideration did suspect, seeing their great  importunity, and the small need the lady had of physic, and therefore  he peremptorily denied their request; misdoubting (as he afterwards  reported) lest, if they had poisoned her under the name of his potion,  he might after have been hanged for a colour of their sin, and the  doctor remained still well assured that this way taking no effect, she  would not long escape their violence, which afterwards happened thus.  For Sir Richard Varney abovesaid (the chief projector in this design),  who, by the Earl's order, remained that day of her death alone with her,  with one man only and Forster, who had that day forcibly sent away all  her servants from her to Abington market, about three miles distant from  this place; they (I say, whether first stifling her, or else strangling  her) afterwards flung her down a pair of stairs and broke her neck,  using much violence upon her; but, however, though it was vulgarly  reported that she by chance fell downstairs (but still without hurting  her hood that was upon her head), yet the inhabitants will tell you  there that she was conveyed from her usual chamber where she lay, to  another where the bed's head of the chamber stood close to a privy  postern door, where they in the night came and stifled her in her bed,  bruised her head very much broke her neck, and at length flung her down  stairs, thereby believing the world would have thought it a mischance,  and so have blinded their villainy. But behold the mercy and justice  of God in revenging and discovering this lady's murder; for one of the  persons that was a coadjutor in this murder was afterwards taken for a  felony in the marches of Wales, and offering to publish the manner  of the aforesaid murder, was privately made away in the prison by the  Earl's appointment; and Sir Richard Varney the other, dying about the  same time in London, cried miserably, and blasphemed God, and said to  a person of note (who hath related the same to others since), not long  before his death, that all the devils in hell did tear him in pieces.  Forster, likewise, after this fact, being a man formerly addicted to  hospitality, company, mirth, and music, was afterwards observed to  forsake all this, and with much melancholy and pensiveness (some say  with madness) pined and drooped away. The wife also of Bald Butter,  kinsman to the Earl, gave out the whole fact a little before her death.  Neither are these following passages to be forgotten, that as soon as  ever she was murdered, they made great haste to bury her before the  coroner had given in his inquest (which the Earl himself condemned as  not done advisedly), which her father, or Sir John Robertsett (as I  suppose), hearing of, came with all speed hither, caused her corpse to  be taken up, the coroner to sit upon her, and further inquiry to be made  concerning this business to the full; but it was generally thought that  the Earl stopped his mouth, and made up the business betwixt them; and  the good Earl, to make plain to the world the great love he bare to her  while alive, and what a grief the loss of so virtuous a lady was to his  tender heart, caused (though the thing, by these and other means, was  beaten into the heads of the principal men of the University of Oxford)  her body to be reburied in St, Mary's Church in Oxford, with great  pomp and solemnity. It is remarkable, when Dr. Babington, the Earl's  chaplain, did preach the funeral sermon, he tript once or twice in  his speech, by recommending to their memories that virtuous lady so  pitifully murdered, instead of saying pitifully slain. This Earl, after  all his murders and poisonings, was himself poisoned by that which  was prepared for others (some say by his wife at Cornbury Lodge before  mentioned), though Baker in his Chronicle would have it at Killingworth;  anno 1588.\" [Ashmole's Antiquities of Berkshire, vol.i., p.149. The  tradition as to Leicester's death was thus communicated by Ben Jonson to  Drummond of Hawthornden:--\"The Earl of Leicester gave a bottle of liquor  to his Lady, which he willed her to use in any faintness, which she,  after his returne from court, not knowing it was poison, gave him, and  so he died.\"--BEN JONSON'S INFORMATION TO DRUMMOND OF HAWTHORNDEN, MS.,  SIR ROBERT SIBBALD'S COPY.]    The same accusation has been adopted and circulated by the author of  Leicester's Commonwealth, a satire written directly against the Earl of  Leicester, which loaded him with the most horrid crimes, and, among  the rest, with the murder of his first wife. It was alluded to in the  Yorkshire Tragedy, a play erroneously ascribed to Shakespeare, where  a baker, who determines to destroy all his family, throws his wife  downstairs, "]]]
