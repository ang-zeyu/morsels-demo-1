Translated from the French original by Miss Anna Knoop      1878          LIFE OF JEAN MESLIER BY VOLTAIRE.    Jean Meslier, born 1678, in the village of Mazerny, dependency of the  duchy of Rethel, was the son of a serge weaver; brought up in the  country, he nevertheless pursued his studies and succeeded to the  priesthood. At the seminary, where he lived with much regularity, he  devoted himself to the system of Descartes.    Becoming curate of Etrepigny in Champagne and vicar of a little annexed  parish named Bue, he was remarkable for the austerity of his habits.  Devoted in all his duties, every year he gave what remained of his salary  to the poor of his parishes; enthusiastic, and of rigid virtue, he was  very temperate, as much in regard to his appetite as in relation to  women.    MM. Voiri and Delavaux, the one curate of Varq, the other curate of  Boulzicourt, were his confessors, and the only ones with whom he  associated.    The curate Meslier was a rigid partisan of justice, and sometimes  carried his zeal a little too far. The lord of his village, M. de  Touilly, having ill-treated some peasants, he refused to pray for him in  his service. M. de Mailly, Archbishop of Rheims, before whom the case  was brought, condemned him. But the Sunday which followed this decision,  the abbot Meslier stood in his pulpit and complained of the sentence of  the cardinal. \"This is,\" said he, \"the general fate of the poor country  priest; the archbishops, who are great lords, scorn them and do not  listen to them. Therefore, let us pray for the lord of this place. We  will pray for Antoine de Touilly, that he may be converted and granted  the grace that he may not wrong the poor and despoil the orphans.\" His  lordship, who was present at this mortifying supplication, brought new  complaints before the same archbishop, who ordered the curate Meslier to  come to Donchery, where he ill-treated him with abusive language.    There have been scarcely any other events in his life, nor other  benefice, than that of Etrepigny. He died in the odor of sanctity in the  year 1733, fifty-five years old. It is believed that, disgusted with  life, he expressly refused necessary food, because during his sickness  he was not willing to take anything, not even a glass of wine.    At his death he gave all he possessed, which was inconsiderable, to his  parishioners, and desired to be buried in his garden.    They were greatly surprised to find in his house three manuscripts, each  containing three hundred and sixty-six pages, all written by his hand,  signed and entitled by him, \"My Testament.\" This work, which the author  addressed to his parishioners and to M. Leroux, advocate and procurator  for the parliament of Meziers, is a simple refutation of all the  religious dogmas, without excepting one. The grand vicar of Rheims  retained one of the three copies; another was sent to Monsieur  Chauvelin, guardian of the State's seal; the third remained at the  clerk's office of the justiciary of St. Minehould. The Count de Caylus  had one of those three copies in his possession for some time, and soon  afterward more than one hundred were at Paris, sold at ten Louis-d'or  apiece. A dying priest accusing himself of having professed and taught  the Christian religion, made a deeper impression upon the mind than the  \"Thoughts of Pascal.\"    The curate Meslier had written upon a gray paper which enveloped the  copy destined for his parishioners these remarkable words: \"I have seen  and recognized the errors, the abuses, the follies, and the wickedness  of men. I have hated and despised them. I did not dare say it during my  life, but I will say it at least in dying, and after my death; and it is  that it may be known, that I write this present memorial in order that  it may serve as a witness of truth to all those who may see and read it  if they choose.\"    At the beginning of this work is found this document (a kind of  honorable amend, which in his letter to the Count of d'Argental of May  31, 1762, Voltaire qualifies as a preface), addressed to his  parishioners.    \"You know,\" said he, \"my brethren, my disinterestedness; I do not  sacrifice my belief to any vile interest. If I embraced a profession so  directly opposed to my sentiments, it was not through cupidity. I obeyed  my parents. I would have preferred to enlighten you sooner if I could  have done it safely. You are witnesses to what I assert. I have not  disgraced my ministry by exacting the requitals, which are a part of it.    \"I call heaven to witness that I also thoroughly despised those who  laughed at the simplicity of the blind people, those who furnished  piously considerable sums of money to buy prayers. How horrible this  monopoly! I do not blame the disdain which those who grow rich by your  sweat and your pains, show for their mysteries and their superstitions;  but I detest their insatiable cupidity and the signal pleasure such  fellows take in railing at the ignorance of those whom they carefully  keep in this state of blindness. Let them content themselves with  laughing at their own ease, but at least let them not multiply their  errors by abusing the blind piety of those who, by their simplicity,  procured them such an easy life. You render unto me, my brethren, the  justice that is due me. The sympathy which I manifested for your  troubles saves me from the least suspicion. How often have I performed  gratuitously the functions of my ministry. How often also has my heart  been grieved at not being able to assist you as often and as abundantly  as I could have wished! Have I not always proved to you that I took more  pleasure in giving than in receiving? I carefully avoided exhorting you  to bigotry, and I spoke to you as rarely as possible of our unfortunate  dogmas. It was necessary that I should acquit myself as a priest of my  ministry, but how often have I not suffered within myself when I was  forced to preach to you those pious lies which I despised in my heart.  What a disdain I had for my ministry, and particularly for that  superstitious Mass, and those ridiculous administrations of sacraments,  especially if I was compelled to perform them with the solemnity which  awakened all your piety and all your good faith. What remorse I had for  exciting your credulity! A thousand times upon the point of bursting  forth publicly, I was going to open your eyes, but a fear superior to my  strength restrained me and forced me to silence until my death.\"    The abbot Meslier had written two letters to the curates of his  neighborhood to inform them of his Testament; he told them that he had  consigned to the chancery of St. Minnehould a copy of his manuscript in  366 leaves in octavo; but he feared it would be suppressed, according to  the bad custom established to prevent the poor from being instructed and  knowing the truth.    The curate Meslier, the most singular phenomenon ever seen among all the  meteors fatal to the Christian religion, worked his whole life secretly  in order to attack the opinions he believed false. To compose his  manuscript against God, against all religion, against the Bible and the  Church, he had no other assistance than the Bible itself, Moreri  Montaigne, and a few fathers.    While the abbot Meslier naively acknowledged that he did not wish to be  burned till after his death, Thomas Woolston, a doctor of Cambridge,  published and sold publicly at London, in his own house, sixty thousand  copies of his \"Discourses\" against the miracles of Jesus Christ.    It was a very astonishing thing that two priests should at the same time  write against the Christian religion. The curate Meslier has gone  further yet than Woolston; he dares to treat the transport of our  Saviour by the devil upon the mountain, the wedding of Cana, the bread  and the fishes, as absurd fables, injurious to divinity, which were  ignored during three hundred years by the whole Roman Empire, and  finally passed from the lower class to the palace of the emperors, when  policy obliged them to adopt the follies of the people in order the more  easily to subjugate them. The denunciations of the English priest do not  approach those of the Champagne priest. Woolston is sometimes indulgent,  Meslier never. He was a man profoundly embittered by the crimes he  witnessed, for which he holds the Christian religion responsible. There  is no miracle which to him is not an object of contempt and horror; no  prophecy that he does not compare to those of Nostredamus. He wrote thus  against Jesus Christ when in the arms of death, at a time when the most  dissimulating dare not lie, and when the most intrepid tremble. Struck  with the difficulties which he found in Scripture, he inveighed against  it more bitterly than the Acosta and all the Jews, more than the famous  Porphyre, Celse, Iamblique, Julian, Libanius, and all the partisans of  human reason.    There were found among the books of the curate Meslier a printed  manuscript of the Treatise of Fenelon, Archbishop of Cambray, upon the  existence of God and His attributes, and the reflections of the Jesuit  Tournemine upon Atheism, to which treatise he added marginal notes  signed by his hand.

'Why do I wish  to understand Arabic?' Why do you stand on one leg watching a  tadpole shed its tail.\"    \"Excuse me, I always sit down to watch a tadpole.\"    \"Yet I have seen you poised on one leg for an hour like a heron,  afraid to put down the other foot lest you should scare some  wretched pollywog. Why?\"    \"I do it for the love of the thing, Dick. What is a page of your  crooked signs compared with a single green pond and all that it  holds?\"    \"By Jove! Is that so--and would you find a volume in a caterpillar?\"    \"Why not? Listen to me, Dick.  Take the silver-spiked caterpillar,  with a skin of black satin and a length that runs to four inches. He  lives his life in the topmost boughs of an African palm--a feathered  dome amid the forest--and there beneath the blue sky he browses till  he descends into the warm earth to sleep in chrysalis form before he  emerges as a splendid moth, with glass windows in his wide wings to  sail with the fire-flies through the dark vaults of the silent  woods.\"    \"All that from a caterpillar?\"    \"That and much more, Dicky.\"    \"And where will this study of the caterpillar lead you, Godfrey? One  can't live on a caterpillar.\"    \"Yet there is one kind--fat and creamy--that makes good soup.\"    \"Ugh, you cormorant! But tell me seriously, what is the end of your  studies--where will they lead you?\"    \"To Central Africa.\"    \"Do you mean that, Venning?\"    \"I do, Dick. There is one spot on the map of Africa that is marked  black. That spot is covered over hundreds of square miles by the  unexplored forest. Think what that means to me!\"    \"Fever most likely--or three inches of spear-head.\"    \"A forest big enough to cover England! Just think of the new forms  of life--from a new ant to an elephant or hornless giraffe. The  okapi was discovered near that great hunting-ground--and, who is to  say there are not other animals as strange in its untrodden depths?\"    \"Is it a wild-fowl, the okapi?\"    \"A wild-fowl, you duffer!\" exclaimed Venning, indignantly. \"Haven't  you heard of the dwarfed giraffe, part zebra, discovered by Sir  Harry Johnston? It lost the long neck of the original species which  browses in the open veld by the necessity to adapt its habits to the  changed conditions of life within the forest.\"    \"Your neck is rather long, my boy, from much stretching to watch  things. Look out that you don't have it shortened. And so you intend  to visit Central Africa? That is very curious!\"    \"I don't see anything curious about it.\"    \"Nor do I, as to one thing.  If a fellow is crazy about butterflies,  he may as well roam in Africa as a lunatic with a net as anywhere  else; but the curious part of the matter is, that my study of Arabic  is intended to prepare me for a trip to the very same place.\"    \"Compton, you don't mean it,\" said the other, jumping from his seat.    \"I do, most decidedly.\"    \"But what has Arabic got to do with the Central African Forest?\"    \"Quite as much as your short-nosed elephant or long-tailed  hippopotamus. I also wish to discover  something that has been lost.  Don't open your mouth so wide.\"    \"Is it an animal, Dick?\"    \"Good gracious, no! I don't care twopence about an animal, except it  is for the pot, or unless it wants me for dinner. No; mine is  another search.  It is connected with my father.\"    \"Yes,\" said Venning, quietly; for his friend had suddenly grown  grave.    \"When I was a little chap, about seventeen years ago, my mother  received a letter dated from the 'great forest.'\"    \"It contained only these words, 'Good-bye.' With it there was a  letter in Arabic, written by my father's headman. That letter was  seven months on its travels, and since then no other word have I  heard.\"    Venning muttered something in sympathy.    \"My mother,\" continued the other, \"died five years ago, without  having learnt the meaning of the message in Arabic. She had a wish  that no one but I should read the letter, and often she told me that  if it contained any instructions or directions, I was to carry them  out. Well, I have interpreted the Arabic signs.\"    \"Yes, Dick; and----\"    \"And I can't quite make out the meaning. There is a reference to the  journal my father kept, with the  statement that it was safely  hidden; but then follows a reference to a Garden of Rest, to certain  people who  protected him, and to a slave-trader who did him an  injury. These references to me are a mystery; but what is clear is  his desire to have his journal recovered from the Arab slave-dealer,  described merely as 'The Wolf.'\"    \"And that is why you wish to go to Central Africa?\"    \"That is why, Venning. I must recover my father's journal if it  exists; I must, if it is not too late, find out how he died; I must  find out who are the wild people, and what is the Garden of Rest.\"    \"The Garden of Rest! That sounds peaceful, but it is very vague,  Dick, as a direction. A garden in a forest hundreds of miles in  length will take some finding.\"    \"I have a clue.\"    \"So.\"    \"There is mention of the 'gates' to the garden, whose summits 'are  in the clouds'--twin mountains, I take it.\"    \"Even so, Dick, I think I should have more chance of finding my new  animal than you would have of hitting off your garden.\"    \"Well, you know now why I have been studying Arabic. I have a little  money, and no ties.\"    \"Like me. By Jove! why shouldn't we go out together?\"    \"Because we have some sense, I suppose,\" said Compton, coolly. \"Have  you ever roughed it?\"    \"I have slept out in the New Forest--often.\"    \"Oh, that's picnicking, with the bark of the fox in place of the  lion's roar, and good food in place of 'hard tack,' and perhaps the  attentions of a suspicious keeper instead of a surprise attack by  wild men of the woods. An explorer needs experience.\"    \"Yes, and he must buy his own experience; but tell me how he can,  unless he makes a beginning.\"    \"Now we come to the point, Venning. He should begin with some one  who already has experience.\"    \"I see. And you will wait till some seasoned explorer kindly asks  you to join him? You'll have to wait a precious long time.\"    \"I'm not so sure,\" said Dick Compton, with a knowing smile.    \"Have you found your explorer, Dick?\" shouted Venning, eagerly.    Compton produced a leather purse and extracted a slip of paper cut  from an advertisement column, and passed it to his friend.    \"By Jove! eh, that's splendid!\" spluttered Venning, in his  excitement as he glanced at the paper.    \"Read it over.\"    Venning read the notice--    \"A GENTLEMAN, who is an experienced traveler, being about to enter  upon an expedition into Central Africa, would like to make  arrangements with two young men of education and of means to bear a  share of the expenses to accompany him.--Apply, for further  particulars, to D. H., No. 109  Box, Office of this paper.\"    \"Let us write at once to D. H.,\" he said eagerly.    \"I have seen him.\"    Venning took a deep breath and stared at his friend.    \"I saw him this very morning,\" said Compton, quietly.    \"And----------\"    \"He said you were too young! Eh? Go on--go on!\"    \"And I told him I thought I could find a friend who would join me.\"    \"You mean to say that he agreed to take you?\" cried Venning, jumping  up.    Compton nodded.    \"Oh, splendid! And you will take me to him? You're a brick. What is  he like, eh? Is he old or young, eh?\"    Compton kept cool outwardly, but he could not subdue the glitter of  his dark eyes, or keep the colour out of his cheeks.    \"He is about five feet four. I can look over his head.\"    \"Oh!\"    \"There are grey hairs in his beard.\"    \"Quite old; old and little! What bad luck! He will have to look up  to us.\"    \"Well, you know, he can't help being small, can he?\"    \"I suppose, like most little men, he is as vain as he can stick,  bumptious, and fidgety,\" said Venning, despondently.    \"He struck me as being very quiet. At any rate, you can judge for  yourself, as we are due to see him within half an hour. You must  tell him that you are a naturalist, as he intends writing a book, in  which a great deal of space will be given to animals. He said he  felt a 'bit shaky on his pins' when it came to scientific terms.\"    \"I should be glad to help him there,\" said Venning; \"but it is too  good. He would never take a youngster like me.\"    \"He said he would rather have a youngster who would carry out his  own views about treating a subject, than a man who would try to  teach him his business. Come along and see him for yourself.\"    \"Within half an hour"]]]
