Entered according to Act of Congress, in the year 1838,    BY B. CRANSTON & CO.    In the Clerk's Office of the District Court of Rhode-Island.                                                  PROVIDENCE, Feb. 24, 1838.    TO WM. S. BALCH,    SIR--The undersigned, in behalf of the Young People's Institute, hasten  to present to you the following _Resolutions_, together with their  personal thanks, for the Lectures you have delivered before them, on the  Philosophy of Language. The uncommon degree of interest, pleasure and  profit, with which you have been listened to, is conclusive evidence,  that whoever possesses taste and talents to comprehend and appreciate  the philosophy of language, which you have so successfully cultivated,  cannot fail to attain a powerful influence over the minds of his  audience. The Committee respectfully request you to favor them with a  copy of your Lectures for the Press.                        Very respectfully,                          Your most obedient servants,                                              C. T. JAMES,                                              E. F. MILLER,                                              H. L. WEBSTER.           *       *       *       *       *    _Resolved_, That we have been highly entertained and greatly instructed  by the Lectures of our President, on the subject of Language; that we  consider the principles he has advocated, immutably true, exceedingly  important, and capable of an easy adoption in the study of that  important branch of human knowledge.    _Resolved_, That we have long regretted the want of a system to explain  the grammar of our vernacular tongue, on plain, rational, and consistent  principles, in accordance with philosophy and truth, and in a way to be  understood and practised by children and adults.    _Resolved_, That in our opinion, the manifold attempts which have been  made, though doubtless undertaken with the purest intentions, to  simplify and make easy existing systems, have failed entirely of their  object, and tended only to perplex, rather than enlighten learners.    _Resolved_, That in our belief, the publication of these Lectures would  meet the wants of the community, and throw a flood of light upon this  hitherto dark, and intricate, and yet exceedingly interesting department  of a common education, and thus prove of immense service to the present  and future generations.    _Resolved_, That Messrs. Charles T. James, Edward F. Miller, and Henry  L. Webster, be a Committee to wait on Rev. William S. Balch, and request  the publication of his very interesting Course of Lectures before this  Institute.           *       *       *       *       *                                            PROVIDENCE, Feb. 25, 1838.    MESSRS. C. T. JAMES, E. F. MILLER, AND H. L. WEBSTER:    GENTLEMEN--Your letter, together with the Resolutions accompanying it,  was duly and gratefully received. It gives me no ordinary degree of  pleasure to know that so deep an interest has been, and still is, felt  by the members of our Institute, as well as the public generally, on  this important subject; for it is one which concerns the happiness and  welfare of our whole community; but especially the rising generation.    The only recommendation of these Lectures is the subject of which they  treat. They were written in the space of a few weeks, and in the midst  of an accumulation of engagements which almost forbade the attempt. But  presuming you will make all due allowances for whatever errors you may  discover in the style of composition, and regard the _matter_ more than  the _manner_, I consent to their publication, hoping they will be of  some service in the great cause of human improvement.                        I am, gentlemen,                          Very respectfully yours,                                              WM. S. BALCH.          PREFACE.      There is no subject so deeply interesting and important to rational  beings as the knowledge of language, or one which presents a more direct  and powerful claim upon all classes in the community; for there is no  other so closely interwoven with all the affairs of human life, social,  moral, political and religious. It forms a basis on which depends a vast  portion of the happiness of mankind, and deserves the first attention of  every philanthropist.    Great difficulty has been experienced in the common method of explaining  language, and grammar has long been considered a dry, uninteresting, and  tedious study, by nearly all the teachers and scholars in the land. But  it is to be presumed that the fault in this case, if there is any, is to  be sought for in the manner of teaching, rather than in the science  itself; for it would be unreasonable to suppose that a subject which  occupies the earliest attention of the parent, which is acquired at  great expense of money, time, and thought, and is employed from the  cradle to the grave, in all our waking hours, can possibly be dull or  unimportant, if rightly explained.    Children have been required to learn verbal forms and changes, to look  at the mere signs of ideas, instead of the things represented by them.  The consequence has been that the whole subject has become uninteresting  to all who do not possess a retentive verbal memory. The philosophy of  language, the sublime principles on which it depends for its existence  and use, have not been sufficiently regarded to render it delightful and  profitable.    The humble attempt here made is designed to open the way for an  exposition of language on truly philosophical principles, which, when  correctly explained, are abundantly simple and extensively useful. With  what success this point has been labored the reader will determine.    The author claims not the honor of entire originality. The principles  here advanced have been advocated, believed, and successfully practised.  William S. Cardell, Esq., a bright star in the firmament of American  literature, reduced these principles to a system, which was taught with  triumphant success by Daniel H. Barnes, formerly of the New-York High  School, one of the most distinguished teachers who ever officiated in  that high and responsible capacity in our country. Both of these  gentlemen, so eminently calculated to elevate the standard of education,  were summoned from the career of the most active usefulness, from the  scenes they had labored to brighten and beautify by the aid of their  transcendant intellects, to unseen realities in the world of spirits;  where mind communes with mind, and soul mingles with soul, disenthraled  from error, and embosomed in the light and love of the Great Parent  Intellect.    The author does not pretend to give a system of exposition in this work  suited to the capacities of small children. It is designed for advanced  scholars, and is introductory to a system of grammar which he has in  preparation, which it is humbly hoped will be of some service in  rendering easy and correct the study of our vernacular language. But  this book, it is thought, may be successfully employed in the  instruction of the higher classes in our schools, and will be found an  efficient aid to teachers in inculcating the sublime principles of which  it treats.    These Lectures, as now presented to the public, it is believed, will be  found to contain some important information by which all may profit. The  reader will bear in mind that they were written for, and delivered  before a popular audience, and published with very little time for  modification. This will be a sufficient apology for the mistakes which  may occur, and for whatever may have the appearance of severity, irony,  or pleasantry, in the composition.    On the subject of Contractions much more might be said. But verbal  criticisms are rather uninteresting to a common audience; and hence the  consideration of that matter was made more brief than was at first  intended. It will however be resumed and carried out at length in  another work. The hints given will enable the student to form a  tolerable correct opinion of the use of most of those words and phrases,  which have long been passed over with little knowledge of their meaning  or importance.    The author is aware that the principles he has advocated are new and  opposed to established systems and the common method of inculcation. But  the difficulties acknowledged on all hands to exist, is a sufficient  justification of this humble attempt. He will not be condemned for his  good intentions. All he asks is a patient and candid examination, a  frank and honest approval of what is true, and as honest a rejection of  what is false. But he hopes the reader will avoid a rash and precipitate  conclusion, either for or against, lest he is compelled to do as the  author himself once did, approve what he had previously condemned.    With these remarks he enters the arena, and bares himself to receive the  sentence of the public voice.

UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM.      THROWING-STICKS IN THE NATIONAL  MUSEUM.      OTIS T. MASON,  _Curator of the Department of Ethnology_      From the Report of the Smithsonian Institution, 1883-'84,  Part II, pages 279-289, and plates I-XVII    WASHINGTON:  GOVERNMENT PRINTING OFFICE.  1890.          I.--THROWING-STICKS IN THE NATIONAL MUSEUM.    By Otis T. Mason.      Col. Lane Fox tells us there are three areas of the throwing-stick:  Australia, where it is simply an elongated spindle with a hook at the  end; the country of the Conibos and the Purus, on the Upper Amazon,  where the implement resembles that of the Australians, and the  hyperborean regions of North America.    It is of this last group that we shall now speak, since the National  Museum possesses only two specimens from the first-named area and none  whatever from the second.    The researches and collections of Bessels, Turner, Boas, Hall, Mintzner,  Kennicott, Ray, Murdoch, Nelson, Herendeen, and Dall, to all of whom I  acknowledge my obligations, enable me to compare widely separated  regions of the hyperborean area, and to distinguish these regions by the  details in the structure of the throwing-stick.    The method of holding the throwing-stick is indicated in Fig. 1 by a  drawing of H.W. Elliott. The Eskimo is just in the act of launching the  light seal harpoon. The barbed point will fasten itself into the animal,  detach itself from the ivory foreshaft, and unwind the rawhide or sinew  line, which is securely tied to both ends of the light wooden shaft by a  martingale device. The heavy ivory foreshaft will cause the shaft to  assume an upright position in the water, and the whole will act as a  drag to impede the progress of the game. The same idea of impeding  progress and of retrieving is carried out by a multitude of devices not  necessary to mention here.    The Eskimo spend much time in their skin kyaks, from which it would be  difficult to launch an arrow from a bow, or a harpoon from the unsteady,  cold, and greasy hand. This device of the throwing-stick, therefore, is  the substitute for the bow or the sling, to be used in the kyak, by a  people who cannot procure the proper materials for a heavier  lance-shaft, or at least whose environment is prejudicial to the use of  such a weapon. Just as soon as we pass Mount St. Elias going southward,  the throwing-stick, plus the spear or dart of the Eskimo and the Aleut,  gives place to the harpoon with a long, heavy, cedar shaft, weighing 15  or 20 pounds, whose momentum from both hands of the Indian, without the  throw-stick, exceeds that of the Eskimo and Aleut darts and harpoons,  with the additional velocity imparted by the throwing-stick. It must not  be forgotten, also, that the kyak is a very frail, unsteady thing, and  therefore not much of the momentum of the body can be utilized, as it is  by the Northwest Indians in making a lunge with a heavy shaft. The  throwing-stick is also said by some arctic voyagers to be useful in  giving directness of aim. Perhaps no other savage device comes so near  in this respect to a gun barrel or the groove of a bow-gun. Its greatest  advantages, however, are the firm grip which it gives in handling a  harpoon or dart, and the longer time which it permits the hunter to  apply the force of his arm to the propulsion of his weapon. Having  practiced with a throwing-stick somewhat, I have imagined also that  there was a certain amount of leverage acquired by the particular method  of holding the stick and straightening the arm, as in a toggle joint.  That implement, which seems so simple, and which is usually mentioned  and dismissed in a word, possesses several marks or organs, which help  to distinguish the locality in which each form occurs, as well as to  define the associations of the implement as regards the weapon thrown  from it and the game pursued. These marks are:    1. Shape, or general outline in face and side view, and size.    2. Handle, the part grasped in the hand.    3. Thumb-groove or thumb-lock, provision for the firm and comfortable  insertion of the phalanx and ball of the thumb.    4. Finger-grooves, provision for each finger according to its use in the  manipulation of the implement.    5. Finger-pegs, little plugs of wood or ivory to give more certain grip  for the fingers and to prevent their slipping. The devices for the  fingers are the more necessary where the hands are cold and everything  is covered with grease.    6. Finger-tip cavities, excavations on the front face of the implement,  into which the tips of the three last fingers descend to assist in  grasping and to afford a rest on the back of these fingers for the  weapon shaft.    7. Index-finger cavity or hole, provision for the insertion of the index  finger, which plays a very important part in the use of the  throwing-stick.    8. Spear shaft groove, in which the shaft of the weapon lies, as an  arrow or bolt in the groove of a bow-gun.    9. Hook or spur, provision for seizing the butt end of the weapon while  it is being launched. These may be ridges left in the wood by  excavation, or pieces of wood, bone, ivory, &c., inserted. The size and  shape of this part, and the manner of insertion, are also worthy of  notice.    10. Edges: this feature is allied to the form and not to the function of  the implement.    11. Faces: upper, on which the weapon rests; lower, into which the index  finger is inserted.    The figures illustrating this article are drawn to a scale indicated by  inch marks in the margin, every dot on the line standing for an inch.    By the presence or absence, by the number or the shape of some of these  marks or structural characteristics, the type and locality can be easily  detected. The Eskimo have everywhere bows and arrows for land hunting,  the former made of several pieces of bone lashed together, or of a piece  of driftwood lashed and re-enforced with sinew. The arrows are of  endless variety.    It should also be noticed that the kind of game and the season of the  year, the shape and size of the spear accompanying the stick, and the  bare or gloved hand, are all indicated by language expressed in various  parts of this wonderful throwing-stick.      GREENLAND TYPE.    The Greenland throwing-stick is a long, flat trapezoid, slightly ridged  along the back (Fig. 2). It has no distinct handle at the wide end,  although it will be readily seen that the expanding of this part secures  a firm grip. A chamfered groove on one side for the thumb, and a smaller  groove on the other side for the index finger, insure the implement  against slipping from the hunter's grasp. Marks 5, 6, 7 of the series on  page 280 are wanting in the Greenland type. The shaft-groove, in which  lies the shaft of the great harpoon, is wide, deep, and rounded at the  bottom. There is no hook, as in all the other types, to fit the end of  the harpoon shaft, but in its stead are two holes, one in the front end  of the shaft-groove, between the thumb-groove and the finger-groove,  with an ivory eyelet or grommet for a lining, the other at the distal  end of the shaft-groove, in the ivory piece which is ingeniously  inserted there to form that extremity. This last-mentioned hole is not  cylindrical like the one in front, but is so constructed as to allow the  shaft-peg to slide off easily. These holes exactly fit two ivory pegs  projecting from the harpoon shaft. When the hunter has taken his  throwing-stick in his hand he lays his harpoon shaft upon it so that the  pegs will fall in the two little holes of the stick. By a sudden jerk of  his hand the harpoon is thrown forward and released, the pegs drawing  out of the holes in the stick. At the front end of the throwing-stick a  narrow piece of ivory is pegged to prevent splitting. As before  intimated, this type of throwing-stick is radically different from all  others in its adjustment to the pegs on the heavy harpoon. In all other  examples in the world the hook or spur is on the stick and not on the  weapon.      UNGAVA TYPE.    One specimen from Fort Chimo in this region, southeast of Hudson Bay,  kindly lent by Mr. Lucien Turner, is very interesting, having little  relation with that from Greenland (which is so near geographically), and  connecting itself with all the other types as far as Kadiak, in Alaska  (Fig. 3). The outline of the implement is quite elaborate and  symmetrical, resembling at the hook end a fiddle-head, and widening  continuously by lateral and facial curves to the front, where it is thin  and flat. A slight rounded notch for the thumb, and a longer chamfer for  three fingers, form the handle. Marks 5 and 6 are wanting. The cavity  for the index finger extends quite through the implement, as it does in  all cases where it is on the side of the harpoon-shaft groove, and not  directly under it. The shaft groove is shallow, and the hook at the  lower extremity is formed by a piece of ivory inserted in a parallel  groove in the fiddle-head and fastened with pegs. It is as though a  saw-cut one-eighth inch wide had been made longitudinally through the  fiddle-head and one-half inch beyond, and the space had been"]]]
