Lehmann    _Instructor of Theory in the Oberlin Conservatory of Music Author of  \"Lessons in Harmony\"_    G. SCHIRMER, INC.    NEW YORK          PREFACE      The purpose of this work is to supply the need in the Oberlin Conservatory  of Music of a text-book on Simple Counterpoint containing a definite  assignment of lessons, and affording more practice than usual in combining  species.    It is a treatise on strict counterpoint, but strict in a limited sense  only. In two-part counterpoint with other than the first species in both  parts, dissonances are permitted under certain conditions, and in three-  and four-part writing the unprepared seventh and ninth, and the six-four  chord, are allowed in certain ways.    While the illustrations have been written in close score, it is  nevertheless urged that all exercises be written out in open score, as the  movement of the different parts is thus more clearly seen.    The use of the C-clefs is left optional with the teacher.    A knowledge of harmony is presupposed, hence nothing is said pertaining to  it.    The author wishes to express his indebtedness to Professor A.E. Heacox for  his help and advice.                                                F.J. LEHMANN.

SIMPLE COUNTERPOINT    LESSON I      Counterpoint is the art of combining two or more melodies of equal melodic  individuality.    In simple counterpoint all parts must remain in the same relative position  to one another.    The Cantus Firmus is a given melodic phrase that is to receive contrapuntal  treatment, that is, one or more parts are to be added above or below it.    The Counterpoint is any part other than the Cantus Firmus.    Intervals are harmonic or melodic.    An Harmonic interval is the difference in pitch between two tones sounding  at the same time.    A Melodic interval is the difference in pitch between two tones sounded in  succession by the same voice. [Fig. 1.]    [Illustration: Fig. 1.]    Harmonic intervals are divided into Consonances and Dissonances.    Consonances are classed as perfect or imperfect.    The Perfect consonances are the Unison, Fifth, and Octave. [Fig. 2_a_.]    The Imperfect consonances are the Major and Minor Thirds and Sixths. [Fig.  2_b_.]    All other intervals are dissonances.    [Illustration: Fig. 2.]    A Diatonic progression is one in which both name and pitch are changed.  [Fig. 3_a_.]    A Chromatic progression is one in which the pitch is changed a semitone,  while the name remains the same. [Fig. 3_b_.]    [Illustration: Fig. 3.]    Progression from one chord to another is called Harmonic progression; from  one tone to another, Melodic progression.    In melodic progression all major, minor, perfect and diminished intervals  are allowed except the major and minor seventh. The minor seventh may,  however, be used when harmony does not change (_a_). [Fig. 4.]    [Illustration: Fig. 4.]    In counterpoint there are Five Species, or orders. When the counterpoint  has one note for each note of the cantus firmus, it is of the First Species  (_a_); if it has two notes for each note of the cantus firmus, it is the  Second Species (_b_); if four notes, the Third Species (_c_); if two notes  syncopated, the Fourth Species (_d_); and a mixture of these species is the  Fifth Species, or Florid Counterpoint (_e_). [Fig. 5.]    [Illustration: Fig. 5.]          SIMPLE COUNTERPOINT IN TWO PARTS    FIRST SPECIES      Two-part counterpoint comprises a cantus firmus and a counterpoint. [Fig.  6.]    [Illustration: Fig. 6.]    Although in two-part counterpoint we have to deal with intervals, rather  than harmonies, still the harmonic progressions represented by these  intervals should be regarded.    The exercises should begin and close with tonic harmony. At the beginning  the unison, fifth or octave, and at the close the unison or octave, are  permitted. [Fig. 7.]    [Illustration: Fig. 7.]    After the first measure it is better to use imperfect consonances only. The  perfect consonances, however, may be used sparingly when a more melodious  counterpoint is thereby obtained.    The unison may be used in the first and last measures only. [Fig. 7.]    All progressions must be diatonic, and parts should not cross.    The repetition of a note in a lower part should be avoided wherever  possible. In a higher part, repetition to the extent of three notes in  succession is allowed.    Do not use more than three thirds or sixths in succession. [Fig. 8.]    [Illustration: Fig. 8.]    Successive similar skips, except the minor third (_a_), in one direction,  are to be avoided. Successive skips of a fourth are good when the tones are  the fifths of the triads on I, IV and vii deg.. The last tone should return one  degree (_b_). [Fig. 9.]    Do not move more than an octave in one direction in two skips. [Fig. 9_c_.]    [Illustration: Fig. 9.]    Covered fifths and octaves, except from I to V, or V to I, are forbidden.

The Ion is the shortest, or nearly the shortest, of all the writings  which bear the name of Plato, and is not authenticated by any early  external testimony. The grace and beauty of this little work supply the  only, and perhaps a sufficient, proof of its genuineness. The plan is  simple; the dramatic interest consists entirely in the contrast  between the irony of Socrates and the transparent vanity and childlike  enthusiasm of the rhapsode Ion. The theme of the Dialogue may possibly  have been suggested by the passage of Xenophon's Memorabilia in which  the rhapsodists are described by Euthydemus as 'very precise about the  exact words of Homer, but very idiotic themselves.' (Compare Aristotle,  Met.)    Ion the rhapsode has just come to Athens; he has been exhibiting in  Epidaurus at the festival of Asclepius, and is intending to exhibit  at the festival of the Panathenaea. Socrates admires and envies the  rhapsode's art; for he is always well dressed and in good company--in  the company of good poets and of Homer, who is the prince of them. In  the course of conversation the admission is elicited from Ion that his  skill is restricted to Homer, and that he knows nothing of inferior  poets, such as Hesiod and Archilochus;--he brightens up and is wide  awake when Homer is being recited, but is apt to go to sleep at the  recitations of any other poet. 'And yet, surely, he who knows the  superior ought to know the inferior also;--he who can judge of the good  speaker is able to judge of the bad. And poetry is a whole; and he  who judges of poetry by rules of art ought to be able to judge of  all poetry.' This is confirmed by the analogy of sculpture, painting,  flute-playing, and the other arts. The argument is at last brought home  to the mind of Ion, who asks how this contradiction is to be solved. The  solution given by Socrates is as follows:--    The rhapsode is not guided by rules of art, but is an inspired person  who derives a mysterious power from the poet; and the poet, in like  manner, is inspired by the God. The poets and their interpreters may be  compared to a chain of magnetic rings suspended from one another, and  from a magnet. The magnet is the Muse, and the ring which immediately  follows is the poet himself; from him are suspended other poets; there  is also a chain of rhapsodes and actors, who also hang from the Muses,  but are let down at the side; and the last ring of all is the spectator.  The poet is the inspired interpreter of the God, and this is the reason  why some poets, like Homer, are restricted to a single theme, or,  like Tynnichus, are famous for a single poem; and the rhapsode is  the inspired interpreter of the poet, and for a similar reason some  rhapsodes, like Ion, are the interpreters of single poets.    Ion is delighted at the notion of being inspired, and acknowledges that  he is beside himself when he is performing;--his eyes rain tears and his  hair stands on end. Socrates is of opinion that a man must be mad who  behaves in this way at a festival when he is surrounded by his friends  and there is nothing to trouble him. Ion is confident that Socrates  would never think him mad if he could only hear his embellishments  of Homer. Socrates asks whether he can speak well about everything  in Homer. 'Yes, indeed he can.' 'What about things of which he has no  knowledge?' Ion answers that he can interpret anything in Homer. But,  rejoins Socrates, when Homer speaks of the arts, as for example, of  chariot-driving, or of medicine, or of prophecy, or of navigation--will  he, or will the charioteer or physician or prophet or pilot be the  better judge? Ion is compelled to admit that every man will judge of  his own particular art better than the rhapsode. He still maintains,  however, that he understands the art of the general as well as any one.  'Then why in this city of Athens, in which men of merit are always being  sought after, is he not at once appointed a general?' Ion replies that  he is a foreigner, and the Athenians and Spartans will not appoint a  foreigner to be their general. 'No, that is not the real reason; there  are many examples to the contrary. But Ion has long been playing tricks  with the argument; like Proteus, he transforms himself into a variety of  shapes, and is at last about to run away in the disguise of a general.  Would he rather be regarded as inspired or dishonest?' Ion, who has no  suspicion of the irony of Socrates, eagerly embraces the alternative of  inspiration.    The Ion, like the other earlier Platonic Dialogues, is a mixture of jest  and earnest, in which no definite result is obtained, but some Socratic  or Platonic truths are allowed dimly to appear.    The elements of a true theory of poetry are contained in the notion  that the poet is inspired. Genius is often said to be unconscious, or  spontaneous, or a gift of nature: that 'genius is akin to madness' is a  popular aphorism of modern times. The greatest strength is observed to  have an element of limitation. Sense or passion are too much for  the 'dry light' of intelligence which mingles with them and becomes  discoloured by them. Imagination is often at war with reason and fact.  The concentration of the mind on a single object, or on a single aspect  of human nature, overpowers the orderly perception of the whole. Yet the  feelings too bring truths home to the minds of many who in the way of  reason would be incapable of understanding them. Reflections of this  kind may have been passing before Plato's mind when he describes the  poet as inspired, or when, as in the Apology, he speaks of poets as the  worst critics of their own writings--anybody taken at random from the  crowd is a better interpreter of them than they are of themselves. They  are sacred persons, 'winged and holy things' who have a touch of madness  in their composition (Phaedr.), and should be treated with every sort  of respect (Republic), but not allowed to live in a well-ordered state.  Like the Statesmen in the Meno, they have a divine instinct, but they  are narrow and confused; they do not attain to the clearness of ideas,  or to the knowledge of poetry or of any other art as a whole.    In the Protagoras the ancient poets are recognized by Protagoras himself  as the original sophists; and this family resemblance may be traced in  the Ion. The rhapsode belongs to the realm of imitation and of opinion:  he professes to have all knowledge, which is derived by him from Homer,  just as the sophist professes to have all wisdom, which is contained  in his art of rhetoric. Even more than the sophist he is incapable of  appreciating the commonest logical distinctions; he cannot explain the  nature of his own art; his great memory contrasts with his inability  to follow the steps of the argument. And in his highest moments of  inspiration he has an eye to his own gains.    The old quarrel between philosophy and poetry, which in the Republic  leads to their final separation, is already working in the mind of  Plato, and is embodied by him in the contrast between Socrates and Ion.  Yet here, as in the Republic, Socrates shows a sympathy with the poetic  nature. Also, the manner in which Ion is affected by his own recitations  affords a lively illustration of the power which, in the Republic,  Socrates attributes to dramatic performances over the mind of the  performer. His allusion to his embellishments of Homer, in which  he declares himself to have surpassed Metrodorus of Lampsacus and  Stesimbrotus of Thasos, seems to show that, like them, he belonged to  the allegorical school of interpreters. The circumstance that nothing  more is known of him may be adduced in confirmation of the argument that  this truly Platonic little work is not a forgery of later times.          ION      PERSONS OF THE DIALOGUE: Socrates, Ion.      SOCRATES: Welcome, Ion. Are you from your native city of Ephesus?    ION: No, Socrates; but from Epidaurus, where I attended the festival of  Asclepius.    SOCRATES: And do the Epidaurians have contests of rhapsodes at the  festival?    ION: O yes; and of all sorts of musical performers.    SOCRATES: And were you one of the competitors--and did you succeed?    ION: I obtained the first prize of all, Socrates.    SOCRATES: Well done; and I hope that you will do the same for us at the  Panathenaea.    ION: And I will, please heaven.    SOCRATES: I often envy the profession of a rhapsode, Ion; for you have  always to wear fine clothes, and to look as beautiful as you can is a  part of your art. Then, again, you are obliged to be continually in the  company of many good poets; and especially of Homer, who is the best  and most divine of them; and to understand him, and not merely learn  his words by rote, is a thing greatly to be envied. And no man can be  a rhapsode who does not understand the meaning of the poet. For the  rhapsode ought to interpret the mind of the poet to his hearers, but  how can he interpret him well unless he knows what he means? All this is  greatly to be envied.    ION: Very true, Socrates; interpretation has certainly been the most  laborious part of my art; and I believe myself able to speak about  Homer better than any man; and that neither Metrodorus of Lampsacus, nor  Stesimbrotus of Thasos, nor Glaucon, nor any one else who ever was, had  as good ideas about Homer as I have, or as many.    SOCRATES: I am glad to hear you say so, Ion; I see that you will not  refuse to acquaint me with them.    ION: Certainly, Socrates; and you really ought to hear how exquisitely I  render Homer. I think that the Homeridae should give me a golden crown.    SOCRATES: I shall take an opportunity of hearing your embellishments  of him at some other time. But just now I should like to ask you a  question: Does your art extend to Hesiod and Archilochus, or to Homer  only?    ION: To Homer only; he is in"]]]
