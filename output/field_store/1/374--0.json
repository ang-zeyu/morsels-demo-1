THERESE OF LISIEUX    THE STORY OF A SOUL (L'HISTOIRE D'UNE AME): THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF  ST. THERESE OF LISIEUX    WITH ADDITIONAL WRITINGS AND SAYINGS OF ST. THERESE    ______________________________    NOTE TO THIS ELECTRONIC EDITION    This electronic edition of the autobiography of St. Therese of  Lisieux (_The Story of a Soul_) includes much, but not all, of the  content of _Soeur Therese of Lisieux_ (London: Burns, Oates &  Washbourne, 1912; 8th ed., 1922), edited by Rev. T.N. Taylor. All  the translated writings and sayings of St. Therese contained in  that book are in this electronic edition, including the  autobiography as well as \"Counsels and Reminiscences,\" letters,  and selected poems. Also included are the preface by Cardinal  Bourne, the prologue relating Therese's parentage and birth, and  the epilogue describing her final illness, her death, and related  events. Not included are the illustrations, the list of  illustrations, accounts of favors attributed to the intercession  of St. Therese, documents related to her beatification, and some  other material not written by her.    Footnotes have been re-numbered sequentially in each chapter. They  are presented at the end of each chapter, and some have been  slightly modified for ease of reference. A few footnotes,  referring to page numbers in the original, have been modified or  omitted. Citations to the Psalms, many of which were numbered  differently in Catholic Bibles of St. Therese's time than they  commonly are today, have the \"new\" number in brackets next to the  \"old\" number from the original--e.g., \"Psalm 22[23]:1-4.\" Footnote  numbers are shown in brackets, e.g., \"[1].\"    The original page headers, page numbering, disclaimer of any  intention to anticipate the judgment of the Church in calling St.  Therese a \"saint\" before her canonization, and other extraneous  matter, which were deemed suitable for a printed book in 1922 but  not for an e-book in 2005, are not here. The French \"oe\" ligature,  in words such as \"soeur,\" is not available in the standard  ISO-8859-1 character set, and obviously is represented here by the  two-letter combination \"oe.\" Italics are represented by  underscores at the beginning and end, _like this._ The first word  of each chapter is not set in all caps as it was in the printed  book. A few obvious typographical errors have been corrected, with  the changes in brackets, e.g., \"[s]he\" for \"the\" in Chapter IX.  All else, including capitalization, punctuation, grammar, and  British spelling, is intended to reflect the content of the eighth  edition of _Soeur Therese of Lisieux._ If it does not, the fault  is that of the transcriber (me, David McClamrock).    ______________________________    SOEUR THERESE OF LISIEUX, THE LITTLE FLOWER OF JESUS    A NEW AND COMPLETE TRANSLATION OF L'HISTOIRE D'UNE AME, WITH AN  ACCOUNT OF SOME FAVOURS ATTRIBUTED TO THE INTERCESSION OF SOEUR  THERESE    EDITED BY T.

But there is no limit to  the types of sanctity which the Creator is pleased to unfold  before His Creatures. To many, on reading for the first time the  story of Sister Teresa of the Child Jesus and of the Holy Face, it  came almost as a shock to find a very youthful member of an  austere Order, strictly retired from the world, engaged in hidden  prayer and mortification, appearing before us to reveal to the  whole world the wonders of the close intimacy of friendship to  which her Divine Spouse had been pleased to call her. Certainly  the way by which Soeur Therese was led is not the normal life of  Carmel, nor hers the manner whereby most Carmelites are called to  accomplish the wondrous apostolate of intercession to which their  lives are given. But no less certain is it that, in her particular  case, her work for God and her apostolate were not to be confined  between the walls of her religious home, or to be limited by her  few years on earth.    In the first place, we know that it was by obedience that the  record of God's dealings with her soul were set down in writing.  And again, the long tale of graces granted in such strange  profusion through her intercession is proof sufficient that it was  not without Divine permission and guidance that the history of her  special and peculiar vocation has become the property of all  Catholics in every land. It is for God to keep, and for Him to  make known the secrets of His Love for men. And in the case of  Soeur Therese it has been His Will to divulge His secrets in most  generous consideration for our needs.    What are the hidden treasures which Our Divine Master thus reveals  to us through His chosen little servant?    It is the old story of simplicity in God's service, of the perfect  accomplishment of small recurring duties, of trustful confidence  in Him who made and has redeemed and sanctified us. Humility,  self-effacement, obedience, hiddenness, unfaltering charity, with  all the self-control and constant effort that they imply, are  written on every page of the history of this little Saint. And, as  we turn its pages, the lesson is borne in upon our souls that  there is no surer nor safer way of pleasing Our Father Who is in  Heaven than by remaining ever as little children in His sight.  Doubtless for many of her clients whose hearts are kindled as they  read this book, Soeur Therese will obtain, as she has done so  often in the past, wonderful gifts for health of soul and body.  But may she win for all of us without exception a deep and  fruitful conviction of the unchanging truth, that unless we become  as little children in the doing of our Heavenly Father's Will, we  cannot enter into our Eternal Home.    FRANCIS CARDINAL BOURNE, Archbishop of Westminster.    Feast of the Presentation of Our Blessed Lady, 1912.    ______________________________    PROLOGUE: THE PARENTAGE & BIRTH OF MARIE FRANCOISE THERESE MARTIN    In the month of September, 1843, a young man of twenty climbed the  mountain of the Great St. Bernard. His eyes shone with a holy  enthusiasm as the splendour of the Alps stirred to the depths his  responsive nature. Presently, accustomed as they were to discern  God's beauty in the beauty of His handiwork, they glistened with  tears. He paused for a space, then, continuing his journey, soon  reached the celebrated monastery that like a beacon on those  heights darts afar its beams of faith and magnificent charity.    The Prior, struck by the frank and open countenance of his guest,  welcomed him with more than wonted hospitality. Louis Joseph  Stanislaus Martin was the pilgrim's name. He was born on August  22, 1823, at Bordeaux, while his father, a brave and devout  soldier, was captain in the garrison there. \"God has predestined  this little one for Himself,\" said the saintly Bishop of Bordeaux  on the occasion of his baptism, and events have proved the truth  of his words. From this town, by the banks of the Garonne, his  parents went to Alencon in lower Normandy, and there in their new  home, as in their old one, Louis was the cherished Benjamin.    It was not the loveliness of Swiss lakes and mountains and skies  that had drawn the traveller from distant Alencon. He came to the  monastery--and his journey was chiefly on foot--to consecrate his  days to God. On learning his purpose the Prior questioned him upon  his knowledge of Latin, only to discover that the young aspirant  had not completed his course of studies in that language. \"I am  indeed sorry, my child,\" said the venerable monk, \"sinc"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16780"],[0,"The Declaration of Independence of The United States of America (#1)"],[1,"Declaration of Independence of The United States of America      by Thomas Jefferson          Edition 1, (October 12, 2005)              THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA                              IN CONGRESS, July 4, 1776      The unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of America    When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to  dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and  to assume, among the Powers of the earth, the separate and equal station  to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent  respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the  causes which impel them to the separation.    We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal,  that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights,  that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness.--That to  secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their  just powers from the consent of the governed,--That whenever any Form of  Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the  People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying  its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form,  as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness.  Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should  not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all  experience hath shown, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while  evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to  which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and  usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to  reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty,  to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future  security.--Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such  is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems  of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a  history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object  the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this,  let Facts be submitted to a candid world.          He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary        for the public good.        He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and        pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his        Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly        neglected to attend to them.        He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large        districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right        of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them        and formidable to tyrants only.        He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual,        uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their Public        Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with        his measures.        He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with        manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.        He has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause        others to be elected; whereby the Legislative Powers, incapable of        Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for their        exercise; the State remaining in the mean time exposed to all the        dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.        He has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for        that purpose obstructing the Laws of Naturalization of Foreigners;        refusing to pass others to encourage their migration hither, and        raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.        He has obstructed the Administration of Justice, by refusing his        Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary Powers.        He has made judges dependent on his Will alone, for the tenure of        their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.        He has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of        Officers to harass our People, and eat out their substance.        He has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the        Consent of our legislatures.        He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior        to the Civil Power.        He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign        to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his        Assent to their Acts of pretended legislation:        For quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:        For protecting them, by a mock Trial, from Punishment for any        Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States:        For cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world:        For imposing taxes on us without our Consent:        For depriving us, in many cases, of the benefits of Trial by Jury:        For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences:        For abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring        Province, establishing therein an Arbitrary government, and        enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example and        fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these        Colonies:        For taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws, and        altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments:        For suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves        invested with Power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.        He has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of his        Protection and waging War against us.        He has plundered our seas, ravaged our Coasts, burnt our towns, and        destroyed the lives of our people.        He is at this time transporting large armies of foreign mercenaries        to compleat the works of death, desolation and tyranny, already        begun with circumstances of Cruelty & perfidy scarcely paralleled in        the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy of the Head of a        civilized nation.        He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high        Seas to bear Arms against their Country, to become the executioners        of their friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands.        He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has        endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the        merciless Indian Savages, whose known rule of warfare, is an        undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions.    In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the  most humble terms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by  repeated injury. A Prince, whose character is thus marked by every act  which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free People.    Nor have We been wanting in attention to our Brittish brethren. We have  warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend  an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the  circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to  their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the  ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations, which would  inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence. They too have  been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity. We must,  therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our Separation, and  hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace  Friends.    We, therefore, the Representatives of the United States of America, in  General Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world  for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by the Authority  of the good People of these Colonies, solemnly publish and declare, That  these United Colonies are, and of Right ought to be Free and Independent  States; that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown,  and that all political connection between them and the State of Great  Britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as Free and  Independent States, they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace,  contract Alliances, establish Commerce, and to do all other Acts and  Things which Independent States may of right do. And for the support of  this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the Protection of Divine  Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes and  our sacred Honor.
