THE PRESIDENT'S OPENING ADDRESS TO THE CHEMICAL SECTION.    _On the Antiquity of the Chemical Art._ By JAMES MACTEAR,    F.C.S., F.C.I., Member of the International Jury,    Paris, 1878, and Medalist of the Society of Arts.      [Read before the Section, December 8th, 1879.]      The study of the History of Chemistry as an art, or as a science, is one  which possesses peculiar fascination for its votaries. It has been the  subject of deep research and much discussion, much has been written upon  the subject, and many theories have been broached to account for its  origin. We have had laid before us by Professor Ferguson, in his papers  on this subject of Chemical History, very clearly and fully the  generally-accepted position as regards the origin of the science, and in  the last of these papers, entitled \"Eleven Centuries of Chemistry,\" he  deals with the subject in a most complete manner, tracing back through  its various mutations the development of the science to the time of  Geber, in or about the year A.D. 778.    Of Geber, as a chemist, Professor Ferguson writes, \"He was the  first--because, although he himself speaks of the ancients, meaning  thereby his forerunners, nothing is known of these older chemists.\"    Rodwell, in his \"Birth of Chemistry,\" after a careful examination of the  question, comes to the conclusion that, \"in spite of all that has been  written on the subject, there is no good evidence to prove that alchemy  and chemistry did not originate in Arabia not long prior to the eighth  century, A.D.,\" bringing us again to the times of Geber.    He is not alone in this opinion, and it seems to be generally accepted  that chemistry originated in the Arabian schools about this period.    In dealing with the question of the antiquity of chemical art, it has  been too much the habit to look at the question with a view of  discovering when and who it was that first brought forth, fully clothed  as a science, the art of chemistry.    Let us look at the definition of the science given by Boerhaeve, about  1732. He describes chemistry as \"an art which teaches the manner of  performing certain physical operations, whereby bodies cognizable to the  senses, or capable of being rendered cognizable, and of being contained  in vessels, are so changed by means of proper instruments as to produce  certain determinate effects, and at the same time discover the causes  thereof, for the service of the various arts.\"    Now, it is amply evident that, long before the various known facts could  be collected and welded into one compact whole as a science, there must  have existed great store of intellectual wealth, as well as mere  hereditary practical knowledge of the various chemical facts.    I do not think it will be disputed that, until comparatively recent  times, technical knowledge has constantly been in advance of theory, and  that it is not too much to conclude that, no matter where we first find  actual records of our science, its natal day must have long before  dawned. Even in our day, when theoretical science, as applied to  chemistry, has made such immense strides, how often do we find that it  is only now that theory comes in to explain facts, known as such long  previous, and those engaged in practical chemical work know how much  technical knowledge is still unwritten, and what may even be called  traditionary.    I purpose taking up the subject from this point of view, and attempting,  with what little ability I can, to follow back to a still more remote  period than that of Geber and the Arabian school of philosophers the  traces of what has often been called the divine art.    An aspect of the question that has often presented itself to me is this,  that the history of what we call our world extends over some 4000 years  before Christ and 1878 years since, so that, according to the usually  accepted idea, if chemistry originated in Arabia in the eighth century,  it was not known during say the first 5000 years of the world's history,  but has advanced to its present high position amongst the sciences in  the last 1000 years.    I hope to be able to show that, while the Arabian school of philosophy  get the credit of originating most of the sciences, that it is as  undeserved in the case of chemical science as in that of astronomy or  mathematics. At the same time let us not undervalue the services  rendered to science by this school: it is to them we owe the  distribution of the knowledge of most of our sciences, and the Arabic  literature of most of these was widely spread abroad over all the known  world of their time.    The central portion of Baghdad between the eastern and western portions  of the Old World, and the wise and enlightened policy of its rulers,  which welcomed to its schools, without reference to country or creed,  the wise and learned men of every nation, drew to it as to a centre the  accumulated wisdom and knowledge of both the rising and the setting sun.  Long ere this time, however, we find, as regards the Greeks, that they  constantly travelled eastward in search of learning, while we know that  the expedition of Alexander the Great, about B.C. 327, in which he  traversed a considerable portion of India, had already opened up the  store-houses of Indian lore to the minds of the West.    In connection with this, the following extract from an old book: called  _The Gunner_, dated 1664, is interesting:--    \"In the life of Apollonius Tyanaeus, written by Philostratus 1500 years  ago, we find, in reference to the Indians called Oxydra: These truly  wise men dwelled between the rivers Hyphasis and Ganges; their country  Alexander the Great never entered, being deterred, not by fear of the  inhabitants, but, as I suppose, by, religious considerations, for had he  passed the Hyphasis, he might doubtless have made himself master of the  country all round him; but their cities he could never have taken,  though he had led a thousand as brave as Achilles or ten thousand such  as Ajax to the assault. For they come not out into the field to fight  those who attack them; but these holy men, beloved of the gods,  overthrow their enemies with tempests and thunder-bolts shot from their  walls.    \"It is said that Egyptian Hercules and Bacchus (Dionysius), when they  overran India, invaded this people also, and having prepared warlike  engines, attempted to conquer them. They made no show of resistance, but  upon the enemy's near approach to their cities they were repulsed with  storms of lightning and thunder hurled upon them from above.\"    May we not here have the original of the Greek fire, that was in its day  so celebrated and so destructive?    Beginning then at the period of Geber, about 776 A.D., let us try to  work backwards and trace, if we can, the progress of chemical knowledge  down the stream of time.    While the Western Roman Empire had fallen, the Eastern still held its  sway as far as the rivers Tigris and Euphrates, and continued the  contest with the Persian power for the supremacy in Asia. At this time  the various creeds and beliefs of the Arabian tribes--which had been  much influenced by the settlement amongst them of Jews who had been  dispersed at the time of the destruction of Jerusalem, and many of the  sects of Christians who had been driven from the Roman empire by the  more orthodox--were deeply stirred by the new doctrine of Islam,  preached by Mahomet, A.D. 622, proclaiming the Koran as the rule of  life, and the destruction of the ancient Arabian worship of the stars  and sun and moon.    The religion of \"the one God and Mahomet his prophet\" took deep root,  and the injunction to pursue the unbelieving with fire and sword was  followed out with such unrelenting vigour that, within less than a  century from the death of Mahomet, the Arabian power had extended its  sway amongst nearly every tribe and nation that had owned the rule of  the Roman or Persian empires, and had reached from Spain to India, from  Samarcand to the Indian Ocean.    Egypt and Syria were conquered between A.D. 632-39, and Persia about  A.D. 632-51. Their attempts to take Constantinople by siege failed both  in A.D. 673 and 716. But they were more successful on the African shores  of the Mediterranean, which they swept along till they crossed the  Straits of Gibraltar and entered Spain in A.D. 709. Their further  progress--through France--was stayed by their defeat in a great battle  fought at Tour's, when the Gauls, under Charles Martel, forced them to  retire ultimately across the Pyrenees.    Internal dissension had, however, arisen amongst them, and the ruling  dynasty of the Ommiades was overthrown in A.D. 750 by the Abassides, who  established themselves at Damascus; and with them began that cultivation  of the arts and sciences which has thrown such lustre on the Arabian  school.    One of the princes of the Ommiades who had escaped made his way to Spain  and there re-established the power of his family, with Cordova as a  centre, about A.D. 755. Thus it was that the Saracenic power was divided  into an Eastern and a Western Caliphate.    It was under the prosperous rule of the Abassides that such an impulse  was given to learning of every kind, and that the Arabian school of  philosophy, which has left behind it such glorious records of its  greatness, was founded. The Caliph Al-Mansour was the first, so far as  we know, who earnestly encouraged the cultivation of learning; but it  was to Haroun Al-Raschid, A.D. 786-808 (?), that the Arabians owed the  establishment of a "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17760"],[0,"How to Enjoy Paris in 1842 (#1)"],[1,"Proofreaders Europe at http://dp.rastko.net            +--------------------------------------------------------------------------+   Transcriber's Note: There are inconsistencies in spelling and hyphenation   which have been left as they were originally printed.  +--------------------------------------------------------------------------+            HOW TO ENJOY PARIS IN 1842,        INTENDED TO SERVE AS A COMPANION AND MONITOR        Indicating all that is useful and interesting IN THE FRENCH METROPOLIS,      Containing HISTORICAL, POLITICAL, COMMERCIAL, ARTISTICAL, THEATRICAL AND    STATISTICAL INFORMATION.

BRIGGS, 421,    STRAND, LONDON, SUCCESSOR TO LEIGH & CO.    1842.          PREFACE.      In offering the following pages to the public, the author has been  principally influenced by a desire of uniting _useful_ information with  that which he hopes may prove amusing to the reader, endeavouring as  much as possible to keep in view the spirit of the title \"_How to enjoy  Paris;_\" and having been accustomed to hear such constant and bitter  murmurings from the English, in consequence of their having been so  frequently imposed upon by the Paris shopkeepers, considerable pains and  attention have been devoted to guard the reader against his being  subjected to a similar evil; much development has therefore been  afforded towards recommending those establishments where the author  feels confident that the stranger will meet with fair dealing and due  civility. It may, perhaps, be thought by many that he has been rather  too prolix on the subject, but in order to know \"_How to enjoy Paris_\"  to its full extent, the first object, is to be informed of the best  means of dispensing one's modicum of lucre to the greatest advantage,  which will enable the visitor to stay the longer and see the more, just  in proportion as he avoids useless expenditure in suffering himself to  be victimised by over charges.    As the present work includes the different subjects of History,  Antiquities, Politics, Manners, Customs, Army, Navy, Literature,  Painting, Music, Theatres, Performers, etc., etc., the author flatters  himself that readers of every taste will find a chapter which treats  upon some subject that may interest them, hoping that in the endeavour  to play the role of the Miller and his Ass, his efforts to please may be  more happy than those of that unfortunate individual.          CHAPTER I.         Hints to the English visiting Paris as to their demeanour towards       the Parisians, and advice as to the best mode of proceeding in       various transactions with them. An appeal to candour and justice       against national prejudice.      Happiness is the goal for which mankind is ever seeking, but of the many  roads which the imagination traces as the surest and nearest to that  _desideratum_, few, perhaps none, ever chance upon the right; too many  pursue a shadow instead of a substance, influenced by a phantom of their  own creation, engendered in most instances by pride, vanity, or  ambition. Although I do not presume to hope that I can pilot my readers  to the wished-for haven, yet I flatter myself I can afford them such  counsel as will greatly contribute towards their happiness during their  sojourn at Paris or in other parts of France.    Patriotism is certainly a most exalted virtue, but however praiseworthy  it may be in Englishmen to cherish within their own breasts the  recollection that their fleets and armies have ever prevailed, that  their wealth and commerce surpass those of every other nation, etc. etc.  it is not absolutely necessary that they should in their outward  demeanour towards foreigners, bear the semblance of constantly  arrogating to themselves a superiority, of which however conscious and  assured they may be, they never can teach others to feel, and least of  any a Frenchman, who possesses an equal degree of national predilection  as the Englishman, and the moment that sentiment is attacked, or that  our Gallic neighbours conceive that an attempt is made to insinuate that  they are regarded in the light of inferiority, as compared with any  other nation, hatred to the individual who seeks to humiliate them or  their country is instantly engendered, and in all their transactions and  communications with their _soi-disant_ superior, they will either take  some advantage, behave with sullenness, or avail themselves of some  opportunity of displaying the ascerbid feeling which has been created:  not that I would wish an Englishman to subdue that just and natural  pride which he must ever feel when he reflects on the pinnacle of  greatness which his country has attained, through the genius, industry,  and valour of her sons; yet it is a _suaviter in modo_ which I wish him  to preserve in his outward bearing towards the French, without ever  compromising the _fortiter in re_.    I shall now endeavour to illustrate the above theory by citing some  instances wherein its axioms were brought into practice under my own  observation, and which I trust will convince my readers that it is not  from visionary ideas I have formed my conclusions, and that the conduct  I recommend to the traveller in France must in a great degree tend to  the promotion of his happiness, whilst traversing or residing in foreign  climes; as although in other countries the same degree of sensitiveness  will not be found as that which exists amongst the French, a mild and  unassuming deportment is always appreciated on the Continent, where  tradespeople and even servants are not accustomed to be treated in that  haughty dictatorial manner, too often adopted by my countrymen towards  those to whom they are in the habit of giving their orders.    It is now about twelve years since, whilst I was staying at the Hotel de  Bourbon, at Calais, that I was much struck by the very opposite traits  of countenance and difference of demeanour of two gentlemen at the table  d'hote, who appeared nevertheless to be most intimate friends; it was  evident they were both English and proved to be brothers. Ever  accustomed to study the physiognomies of those around me, I contemplated  theirs with peculiar attention, having discovered by their conversation  that they were to be my companions on my journey to Paris; and it  required no great powers of penetration to perceive that the elder was  decided upon viewing all with a jaundiced eye, whilst the younger was  disposed to be pleased and in good humour, with all around him. The  conducteur announcing that the Diligence was ready and that we must  speedily take our seats, abruptly interrupted all my physiognomical  meditations, and we quickly repaired to the heavy lumbering vehicle in  which we were destined to be dragged to the gay metropolis. Our names  being called over in rotation, I found that the brothers had engaged  places in the coupe as well as myself, but having priority of claim, had  wisely chosen the two corners, the vacant seat in the middle falling to  my lot; and I believe, as it proved, it was not a bad arrangement, as I  acted as a sort of sand-bag between two jars, which prevented their  _jarring_; in fact I formed a sort of _juste milieu_ between two  extremes, and no sooner were we installed in our respective places, than  my mediating powers were called into operation, as the following  dialogue will exemplify.    \"They gave us a very nice dinner, sir,\" said the good humoured brother  who sat on my left.    I replied that I was very well satisfied with it.    \"But you don't know what their messes are made of. For my part I like to  know what, I eat,\" observed the discontented brother on my right, \"and  you don't mean surely, sir, to say that such as they gave us was  anything to compare to a good English dinner.\"    That, I remarked, was entirely an affair of taste; that I myself was  most partial to the simpler mode of living of the English, but not so  the high aristocracy of our country, with whom French cooks are in the  greatest estimation.    \"I was very much pleased with the _vin ordinaire_, as they call it, and  found it a pleasant light wine, particularly agreeable when one is  thirsty,\" said Good Humour.    \"_Light_ enough at any rate,\" returned Discontent, \"and well named _vin  ordinaire_, for ordinary it is in every sense of the word, pretty much  like themselves for that; but if you like to have any when we are in  England, I'll make you some; take a little port wine, put some vinegar  and a good deal of water with it and there you have it at once; is not  that your opinion, sir?\"    I replied, that I considered it a beverage well adapted for a sort of  draught wine, but that it certainly had not the body that foreign wines  have that we are in the habit of drinking in England.    Good Humour not appearing to relish his brother's receipt for making  _vin ordinaire_, changed the subject, by observing that a woman who was  standing at the door of an _auberge_ where we were stopping had a very  fine expression of countenance, although rather thin and pale, but that  there was a pensive cast which prevailed throughout her features and  rendered the _tout ensemble_ interesting.    \"Oh very _fine_, indeed,\" said Discontent, with a sarcastic smile, \"as  complete a picture of skin and grief as one could wish to see. Pray,  sir, is she one of your beauties?\"    I admitted that her appearance was rather pleasing, but that beauty was  out of the question, nor did I understand his brother to have made any  remark conveying the idea that she possessed"]]]
