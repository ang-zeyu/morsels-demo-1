Explanations given in the text are enough to get  started teaching a child to read and write. Counting in  Roman numerals is included as a bonus in the form of lesson  numbers.    There is no text version because much of the material uses  specialized characters that have no ASCI equivalent.  Wherever possible the \"ASCI\" text has been converted.    The \"non-ASCI\" text remains as images.  The \"non-ASCI\"  text is approximated in text boxes to right of the image, as  are script images.    The form of contractions includes a space.

NEW YORK--CHICHESTER--WEINHEIM--BRISBANE--SINGAPORE--TORONTO      The long continued popularity of MCGUFFEY'S  READERS is sufficient evidence of the positive merits of  the books. The aim of this revision has been to preserve  unimpaired the distinctive features of the series, and at the  same time to present the matter in a new dress, with new  type, new illustrations, and with a considerable amount of  new matter.  Spelling exercises are continued through the first half of  the THIRD READER. These exercises, with those furnished  in the two lower books, are exhaustive of the words  employed in the reading lessons. Words are not repeated in  the vocabularies.  In the latter half of the book, definitions are introduced. It  is hoped that the teacher will extend this defining exercise to  all the words of the lesson liable to be misunderstood. The  child should define the word in his own language sufficiently  to show that he has a mastery of the word in its use.  Drills in articulation and emphasis should be given with  every lesson. The essentials of good reading are not to be  taught by one or two lessons. Constant drill on good  exercises, with frequent exhibitions of the correct method  from the teacher, will be found more effectual than any form  prescribed in type.  If the pupils are not familiar with the diacritical marks,  they should be carefully taught; such instruction constitutes  an excellent drill on articulation, and enables the pupils to  use the dictionary with intelligence.

A distinct articulation can only be gained by constant and  careful practice of the elementary sounds.  Whenever a word is imperfectly enunciated, the teacher  should call attention to the sounds composing the spoken  word.  If the pupil fails to sound any element correctly, as in the  case of lisping, the fault can be overcome by calling  attention to the correct position of the organs of speech, and  insisting upon exact execution. Except in case of  malformation of these organs, every pupil should sound each  element correctly before such drill should cease.      TABLE OF VOCALS.

NOTE.--If the pupil has received proper oral instruction,  he has been taught to understand what he has read, and has  already acquired the habit of emphasizing words. He is now  prepared for a more formal introduction to the SUBJECT of  emphasis, and for more particular attention to its first  PRINCIPLES. This lesson, and the examples given, should  be repeatedly practiced.  In reading and in talking, we always speak some words  with more force than others. We do this, because the  meaning of what we say depends most upon these words.  If I wish to know whether it is George or his brother who  is sick, I speak the words George and brother with more  force than the other words. I say, Is it George or his brother  who is sick?  This greater force with which we speak the words is called  EMPHASIS.  The words upon which emphasis is put, are sometimes  printed in slanting letters, called Italics,* and sometimes in  CAPITALS.  The words printed in Italics in the following questions and  answers, should be read with more force than the other  words, that is, with emphasis.  Did you ride to town yesterday? No, my brother, did.  Did yon ride to town yesterday? No, I walked.    * Italics are also used for other purposes, though most  frequently for emphasis.       THIRD READER.  11    Did you ride to town yesterday? No, I went into the  country.  Did you ride to town yesterday? No, I went the day before.  Have you seen James or John lately? I have seen James,  but not John.  Did you say there were four eggs in the nest, or three?  There were only three eggs, not four.  Were the eggs white or blue? The eggs were white, not  blue.  Had the boy a hat on his head, or a cap? He had a cap on,  not a hat.    PUNCTUATION.    Punctuation should be thoroughly studied by the pupil, in  order that he may become perfectly familiar with the marks  and pauses found in the reading lessons of this volume.    MARKS AND PAUSES.    These marks are used to point off written or printed matter  into sentences and parts of sentences, and thus to assist the  reader in obtaining the meaning of the writer. They seldom  indicate the length of the pause to be made; this must be  determined by the sense.  A Hyphen (-) is used between syllables in a word divided at  the end of a line; as, \"be-cause,\" \"ques-tion,\" and between the  parts of a compound word; as,  Rocking-chair, good-by.     12 ECLECTIC SERIES.    The Comma (,), Semicolon (;), and Colon (:) mark  grammatical divisions in a sentence; as,  God is good; for he gives us all things.  Be wise to-day, my child: 't is madness to defer.    A Period (.) is placed at the end of a sentence; as,  God is love. Life is short.  Or is used after an abbreviation; as,  Dr. Murphy. Jan. 10, 1879.    An Interrogation Point (?) denotes a question; as,  Has he come? Who are you?    An Exclamation Point (!) denotes strong feeling; as,  O Absalom! my son! my son!    The Dash (--) is used where there is a sudden break or  pause in a sentence; as,  The truth has power--such is God's will--to make us better.    Quotation Marks (\" \") denote the words of another; as,  God said, \"Let there be light.\"    An Apostrophe (') denotes that a letter or letters are left  out; as,  O'er, for over; 't is, for it is.  And is also used to show ownership; as,  The man's hat. Helen's book.      MCGUFFEY'S    THIRD READER.    LESSON I.      THE SHEPHERD BOY.    1.

We have a particular code of football of our own, which  the school has played time out of mind; but, ten years ago, the  Association game was introduced, despite the murmuring of some of the  masters, many of the parents--all old Amorians--and of Moore, the Head,  who had yielded to varied pressures, but in his heart thought \"Socker\"  vastly inferior to the old game. Association had flourished exceedingly;  so much so that the Head made it a law that, on each Thursday in the  Michaelmas term, the old game, and nothing but the old game, should be  played, and woe betide any unauthorized \"cutters\" thereof. This was almost  the only rule that Corker never swerved a hair's breadth from, and bitter  were the regrets when Shannon had sent word to Bourne, our captain, that  he could bring down a really clinking team to put our eleven through their  paces, if the match were played on Thursday. Saturday, on account of big  club fixtures, was almost impossible. Corker consented to the eleven  playing the upstart code for this occasion only, but for the school  generally the old game was to be _de rigueur_.    So on this Thursday pretty well the whole school was out in the Acres,  where the old game was in full swing; and, though I fancy the players to a  man would have liked to have lined up on the touch-line in the next field  and given Shannon the \"whisper\" he deserves, O.G. claimed them that  afternoon for its own, and they were unwilling martyrs to old Corker's  cast-iron conservatism. Consequently, when Bourne spun the coin and  Shannon decided to play with the wind, there would not be more than  seventy or eighty on the touch-line. Shannon asked me to referee, so I  found a whistle, and the game started.    It was a game in which there seemed to be two or three players who served  as motive forces, and the rest were worked through. On one side Shannon at  back, Amber the International at half, and Aspinall, the International  left-winger, were head and shoulders above the others; on our side, Bourne  and Acton dwarfed the rest.    Bourne played back, and Acton was his partner. Bourne I knew well, since  he was in the Sixth, and I liked him immensely; but of Acton I knew only a  little by repute and nothing personally. He was in the Fifth, but, except  in the ordinary way of school life, he did not come much into the circle  wherein the Sixth moves. He was brilliantly clever, with that sort of  showy brilliance which some fellows possess: in the exams, he would walk  clean through a paper, or leave it untouched--no half measures. He was in  Biffen's house and quite the most important fellow in it, and no end  popular with his own crowd, for they looked to him to give their house a  leg up, both in the schools and in the fields, for Biffen's were the  slackest house in St. Amory's. He played football with a dash and vim good  to see, and I know a good few of the eleven envied him his long, lungeing  rush, which parted man and ball so cleanly, and his quick, sure kick that  dropped the ball unerringly to his forwards. He was not in the eleven; but  that he would be in before the term was over was a \"moral.\" He was  good-looking and rather tall, and had a certain foreign air, I thought;  his dark face seemed to be hard and proud, and I had heard that his temper  was fiery.    Bourne had chosen him to play against Shannon's team, and as Acton bottled  up the forwards on his wing Bourne felt that the school's future right  back would not be far to seek.    I soon saw that the school was not quite good enough for the others:  Shannon was almost impassable, and Amber, the half, generally waltzed  round our forwards, and when he secured he passed the ball on to Aspinall,  who doubled like a hare along the touch-line. The question then was \"Could  Acton stop the flying International, who spun along like Bassett  himself?\" And he did, generally; or, if he could not, he forced him to  part with the ball, and either Baines, our half, lying back, nipped in and  secured, or Bourne cleared in the nick of time. Nine times out of ten,  when Acton challenged Aspinall, the International would part with the ball  to his inside partner; but twice he feinted, and before either of the  school backs could recover, the ball was shot into the net with a high and  catapultic cross shot. Again and again the game resolved itself into a  duello between Acton and Aspinall, and Bourne, when he saw the dealings  with the International and his wiles, smiled easily. He saw the school was  stronger than he thought.    The interval came with the score standing at two against us. When I  started the game again I found that our fellows were pulling along much  better with the wind, and that some of Shannon's men were not quite so  dangerous as before, for condition told. We quickly had one through, and  when I found myself blowing the whistle for a second goal I began to think  that the school might pull through after all. Meanwhile Acton and Aspinall  were having their occasional tussles, though somewhat less often than  before, and three or four times the school back was overturned pretty  heartily in the encounters.    Though there was not a suspicion of unfairness or temper on Aspinall's  part, I fancied that Acton was getting rather nettled at his frequent  upsets. He was, I considered, heavier than Aspinall, and much taller, so I  was both rather waxy and astonished to find that he was infusing a little  too much vigour into his tackling, and, not to put too fine a point on it,  was playing a trifle roughly. Aspinall was bundled over the touch-line a  good half-dozen times, with no little animus behind the charge, and  ultimately Bourne noticed it. Now, Bourne loathed anything approaching bad  form, so he said sharply to Acton, though quietly, \"Play the game, sir!  Play the ball!\" Acton flushed angrily, and I did not like the savage way  he faced round to Bourne, who was particularly busy at that moment and did  not notice it. The game went on until within about five minutes from time.  Amber had been feeding Aspinall assiduously for the last ten minutes, and  Acton had, despite his cleverness, more than he could really hold in the  flying International. He stalled off the attack somehow, and Bourne always  covered his exertions, so that it seemed as if there would be a draw after  all. At last the ball was swung across, and Aspinall was off on a final  venture. Acton stuck to him like a leech, but the winger tipped the ball  to his partner, and as Acton moved to intercept the inside, the latter  quickly and wisely poked the ball back again to Aspinall. He was off again  in his own inimitable style, and I saw him smile as he re-started his run.  I rather"]]]
