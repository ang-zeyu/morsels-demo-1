By Andrew W. Young,    Author of \"Science of Government,\" \"First Lessons in Civil Government,\"  \"American Statesman,\" \"Citizen's Manual of Government and Law.\"      NEW-YORK:  J. C. DERBY & N. C. MILLER,  5 SPRUCE STREET, TRIBUNE BUILDINGS.  1865.          Entered, according to Act of Congress, in the year 1859, by Andrew W.  Young, in the Clerk's Office of the District Court of the United States  for the Northern District of New York.          Preface.        The utility of the diffusion of political knowledge among a people  exercising the right of self-government, is universally admitted. The  form of government established by the people of the United States,  though well adapted to promote the general welfare, is highly  complicated; and the knowledge requisite to administer it successfully  can not be acquired without much study. From the fact that a large  portion of the American people are greatly deficient in this knowledge,  we may justly conclude that it will never become general, until it shall  have been made an object of school instruction.    The administration of the government of this great and rapidly  increasing republic, will, in a few years, devolve upon those who are  now receiving instruction in the public schools. Yet thousands annually  complete their school education, who have never devoted any time to the  study of the principles of the government in which they are soon to take  a part--who become invested with political power without the preparation  necessary to exercise it with discretion. The schools are regarded as  the nurseries of our future statesmen. They share largely in the bounty  of the state; yet few of them render in return even the rudiments of  political science to those who are to become her legislators, and  governors, and judges. Not only in the common schools generally, but in  a large portion of the high schools and seminaries, this science is not  included in the course of instruction.    To many of the most enlightened friends of education and of our free  institutions, it has long been a matter of surprise as well as regret,  that those to whom the educational interests of the states are more  immediately intrusted, should so long have treated the study in question  as of minor importance, or have suffered it to be excluded by studies of  far less practical utility. The Regents of the University of the State  of New York have repeatedly noticed the neglect of this study in the  academies and seminaries subject to their visitation; and they mention  it as a remarkable fact, that in many of them preference is given to the  study of the Grecian and Roman antiquities. They say: \"The  constitutions, laws, manners, and customs of ancient Greece and Rome are  made subjects of regular study, quarter after quarter, while our own  constitutional jurisprudence, and the every day occurring principles of  our civil jurisprudence, are not admitted as a part of the academic  course!\"    To persons who are to engage in any of the industrial or professional  pursuits, a preparatory course of training or discipline is deemed  indispensable to success. Yet many assume the weighty responsibilities  of freemen, and allow their sons to do the same, with scarcely any  knowledge of a freeman's duties. On the intelligent exercise of  political power, the public prosperity and the security of our liberties  mainly depend. Every person, therefore, who is entitled to the rights of  a citizen, is justly held responsible for the proper performance of his  political duties. And any course of popular instruction which fails to  impart a knowledge of our system of government, must be materially  defective.    With a view to supply this deficiency, the author, many years since,  prepared his \"Introduction to the Science of Government.\" This work soon  attained considerable popularity, both as a class book in schools, and  as a book for private reading and reference for adults. Not being  deemed, however, sufficiently _elementary_ for the children and youth  in most of our common schools, another work, entitled, \"_First Lessons  in Civil Government_,\" was written to meet the capacities of younger or  less advanced scholars than those for whom the previous work was  designed.    The favorable reception of these works by the public, and the assurances  of their usefulness to thousands who have studied them, are to the  author a source of high gratification, and an ample reward for many  years of arduous labor. The value of these works has, however, been in a  measure impaired by changes in the government and laws since the time of  their first publication. The latter, especially, descending so minutely  into the details of the government of the state for which alone it is  intended, requires frequent revisions.    It has occurred to the author that a new work, more permanent in the  character of its matter, and adapted for use in all the states, is  demanded to supply the deficiency in the present course of education.  Stimulated by a desire to bear some part in laying a solid foundation  for our republican institutions, and encouraged by the success of his  former labors in this department of education, he has, after a  suspension of several years, resumed his efforts in this enterprise, in  the hope that, with the cooeperation of teachers, and those having  official supervision of the schools, it may be carried forward to an  early consummation; when the principles of government shall be made a  subject of regular study in the schools, and the elements of a sound  political education shall be accessible to the mass of American youth.  And he flatters himself, that the attention he has given to this subject  has enabled him to prepare a work adapted, in a good degree, to meet the  existing want of the schools.    Many words and phrases, as they occur in the course of the work, have  been defined; and an attempt has been made to explain the several  subjects in such a manner as to render them intelligible to youth.    The object which it is the purpose of this work to aid in effecting,  claims the earnest attention of parents. Every father, at least, is  bound to see that his sons have the means of acquiring a good political  education. He can not innocently suffer them to pass from under his  guardianship unprepared to discharge their political duties.    The study of this work should not be confined to male pupils. It has  long been considered a striking defect in our system of education, that  females are not more generally instructed in the principles of civil  government, and in matters of business. Although they take no active  part in public affairs, the knowledge here commended would enable them  to exert a far more powerful and salutary influence upon our national  character and destiny. As wives, mothers, teachers, and especially as  counselors of the other sex, they could apply this knowledge to valuable  purposes. And the question is submitted, whether it would not contribute  more to their usefulness than some of those accomplishments which form  so large a part of a modern female education, and which are usually lost  amidst the cares of married life.    To preserve and transmit the blessings of constitutional liberty, we  need a healthful patriotism. But a genuine love of country is hardly to  be expected where there is not a proper appreciation of our political  institutions, which give it its preeminence among nations. And how can  they be duly appreciated if they are not understood? It has been one of  the objects of the writer to bring to view the chief excellencies of our  system of government, and thus to lay, in the minds of youth, the basis  of an enlightened and conservative patriotism.    That this work, as an elementary treatise on civil government, is not  susceptible of improvement, is not pretended. Such as it is, it is  submitted to the judgment of a candid public. If it shall prove in any  considerable degree useful, the author's highest expectations will have  been realized.        To Teachers.      To the meritorious, though often undervalued labors of the instructors  of American youth, is our country greatly indebted for the successful  working of its system of free government; and upon the labors of their  successors rest, in an equal degree, all well-founded hopes of its  future political prosperity.    The general introduction and profitable study of this work, depend much  upon a hearty and active cooeperation of teachers in the enterprise which  it is intended to promote. From all who desire to make themselves in the  highest degree useful in their profession, such cooeperation is  confidently anticipated.    The advantage of instructing a class in civil government, is not  confined to the pupils. The teacher will find the exercise both  interesting and profitable to himself. Although pains have been taken to  adapt the work to the capacities of youth, the definition of many terms  and phrases, and the further explanation of many subjects, have  necessarily been left to be supplied by teachers. The study and  investigation which may in some cases be required to qualify them for  the task, will be amply rewarded by their own advancement in political  knowledge.    No intelligent teacher, it is presumed, will object to the introduction  of this study, on the ground that there is not sufficient time or room  for an additional exercise. Useful as all the branches now taught may be  justly deemed, all of them are not, as is a knowledge of government,  indispensable to the security of our liberties. The latter is of far  greater importance to an"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15323"],[0,"The Green Eyes of Bâst (#1)"],[1,"Distributed Proofreading Team                    THE GREEN EYES  OF BAST    BY SAX ROHMER    AUTHOR OF    \"_The Golden Scorpion_,\" \"_Dope_,\" \"_The Hand of Fu-Manchu_,\"  \"_The Insidious Dr. Fu-Manchu_,\" \"_The Return of Fu-Manchu_,\"  \"_Tales of Secret Egypt_,\" \"_The Yellow Claw_,\"  \"_The Quest of the Sacred Slipper_,\" _etc._      A.L.

A bit gusty?\"    \"Very much so, sergeant,\" I replied. \"I think I will step into your  hut for a moment and light my pipe if I may.\"    \"Certainly, sir. Matches are too scarce nowadays to take risks with  'em. But it looks as if the storm had blown over.\"    \"I'm not sorry,\" said I, entering the little hut like a sentry-box  which stands at the entrance to this old village high street for  accommodation of the officer on point duty at that spot. \"I have a  longish walk before me.\"    \"Yes. Your place is right off the beat, isn't it?\" mused my  acquaintance, as sheltered from the keen wind I began to load my  briar. \"Very inconvenient I've always thought it for a gentleman who  gets about as much as you do.\"    \"That's why I like it,\" I explained. \"If I lived anywhere accessible I  should never get a moment's peace, you see. At the same time I have to  be within an hour's journey of Fleet Street.\"    I often stopped for a chat at this point and I was acquainted with  most of the men of P. division on whom the duty devolved from time to  time. It was a lonely spot at night when the residents in the  neighborhood had retired, so that the darkened houses seemed to  withdraw yet farther into the gardens separating them from the  highroad. A relic of the days when trains and motor-buses were not,  dusk restored something of an old-world atmosphere to the village  street, disguising the red brick and stucco which in many cases had  displaced the half-timbered houses of the past. Yet it was possible in  still weather to hear the muted bombilation of the sleepless city and  when the wind was in the north to count the hammer-strokes of the  great bell of St. Paul's.    Standing in the shelter of the little hut, I listened to the rain  dripping from over-reaching branches and to the gurgling of a turgid  little stream which flowed along the gutter near my feet whilst now  and again swift gusts of the expiring tempest would set tossing the  branches of the trees which lined the way.    \"It's much cooler to-night,\" said the sergeant.    I nodded, being in the act of lighting my pipe. The storm had  interrupted a spell of that tropical weather which sometimes in July  and August brings the breath of Africa to London, and this coolness  resulting from the storm was very welcome. Then:    \"Well, good night,\" I said, and was about to pursue my way when the  telephone bell in the police-hut rang sharply.    \"Hullo,\" called the sergeant.    I paused, idly curious concerning the message, and:    \"The Red House,\" continued the sergeant, \"in College Road? Yes, I know  it. It's on Bolton's beat, and he is due here now. Very good; I'll  tell him.\"    He hung up the receiver and, turning to me, smiled and nodded his head  resignedly.    \"The police get some funny jobs, sir,\" he confided. \"Only last night a  gentleman rang up the station and asked them to tell me to stop a  short, stout lady with yellow hair and a big blue hat (that was the  only description) as she passed this point and to inform her that her  husband had had to go out but that he had left the door-key just  inside the dog-kennel!\"    He laughed good-humoredly.    \"Now to-night,\" he resumed, \"here's somebody just rung up to say that  he thinks, only _thinks_, mind you, that he has forgotten to lock his  garage and will the constable on that beat see if the keys have been  left behind. If so, will he lock the door from the inside, go out  through the back, lock that door and leave the keys at the station on  coming off duty!\"    \"Yes,\" I said. \"There are some absent-minded people in the world. But  do you mean the Red House in College Road?\"    \"That's it,\" replied the sergeant, stepping out of the hut and looking  intently to the left.    \"Ah, here comes Bolton.\"    He referred to a stolid, red-faced constable who at that moment came  plodding across the muddy road, and:    \"A job for you, Bolton,\" he cried. \"Listen. You know the Red House in  College Road?\"    Bolton removed his helmet and scratched his closely-cropped head.    \"Let me see,\" he mused; \"it's on the right--\"    \"No, no,\" I interrupted. \"It is a house about half-way down on the  left; very secluded, with a high brick wall in front.\"    \"Oh! You mean the _empty_ house?\" inquired the constable.    \"Just what I was about to remark, sergeant,\" said I, turning to my  acquaintance. \"To the best of my knowledge the Red House has been  vacant for twelve months or more.\"    \"Has it?\" exclaimed the sergeant. \"That's funny. Still, it's none of  my business; besides it may have been let within the last few days.  Anyway, listen, Bolton. You are to see if the garage is unlocked. If  it is and the keys are there, go in and lock the door behind you.  There's another door at the other end; go out and lock that too. Leave  the keys at the depot when you go off. Got that fixed?\"    \"Yes,\" replied Bolton, and he stood helmet in hand, half inaudibly  muttering the sergeant's instructions, evidently with the idea of  impressing them upon his memory.    \"I have to pass the Red House, constable,\" I interrupted, \"and as you  seem doubtful respecting its whereabouts, I will point the place out  to you.\"    \"Thank you, sir,\" said Bolton, replacing his helmet and ceasing to  mutter.    \"Once more--good night, sergeant,\" I cried, and met by a keen gust of  wind which came sweeping down the village street, showering cascades  of water from the leaves above, I set out in step with my stolid  companion.    It is supposed poetically that unusual events cast their shadows  before them, and I am prepared to maintain the correctness of such a  belief. But unless the silence of the constable who walked beside me  was due to the unseen presence of such a shadow, and not to a habitual  taciturnity, there was nothing in that march through the deserted  streets calculated to arouse me to the fact that I was entering upon  the first phase of an experience more strange and infinitely more  horrible than any of which I had ever known or even read.    The shadow had not yet reached me.    We talked little enough on the way, for the breeze when it came was  keen and troublesome, so that I was often engaged in clutching my hat.  Except for a dejected-looking object, obviously a member of the tramp  fraternity, who passed us near the gate of the old chapel, we met  never a soul from the time that we left the police-box until the  moment when the high brick wall guarding the Red House came into view  beyond a line of glistening wet hedgerow.    \"This is the house, constable,\" I said. \"The garage is beyond the main  entrance.\"    We proceeded as far as the closed gates, whereupon:    \"There you are, sir,\" said Bolton triumphantly. \"I told you it was  empty.\"    An estate agent's bill faced us, setting forth the desirable features  of the residence, the number of bedrooms and reception rooms, modern  conveniences, garage, etc., together with the extent of the garden,  lawn and orchard.    A faint creaking sound drew my glance upward, and stepping back a pace  I stared at a hatchet-board projecting above the wall which bore two  duplicates of the bill posted upon the gate.    \"That seems to confirm it,\" I declared, peering through the trees in  the direction of the house. \"The place has all the appearance of being  deserted.\"    \"There's some mistake,\" muttered Bolton.    \"Then the mistake is not ours,\" I replied. \"See, the bills are headed  'To be let or sold. The Red House, etc.'\"    \"H'm,\" growled Bolton. \"It's a funny go, this is. Suppose we have a  look"]]]
