PREFACE      In the \"Beacon Second Reader\" the author has chosen for his stories only  those of recognized literary merit; and while it has been necessary to  rearrange and sometimes rewrite them for the purpose of simplification,  yet he has endeavored to retain the spirit which has served to endear  these ancient tales to the children of all ages. The fairy story appeals  particularly to children who are in the second school year. It has been  proved by our ablest psychologists that at about this period of  development, children are especially susceptible to the stimulus of the  old folklore. They are in fact passing through the stage which  corresponds to the dawn of the human race, when demons, dragons,  fairies, and hobgoblins were as firmly believed in as rivers and  mountains.    As a test of this theory the author asked hundreds of second-grade and  third-grade school children to recall the stories which they had read  during the preceding year, and to express their preferences. The choice  of more than ninety per cent proved to be either folklore stories, pure  and simple, or such tales as contained the folklore element. To be sure,  children like other stories, but they respond at once with sparkling  eyes and animated voices when the fairy tale is suggested. How unwise,  therefore, it is to neglect this powerful stimulus which lies ready at  our hands! Even a pupil who is naturally slow will wade painfully and  laboriously through a fairy story, while he would throw down in disgust  an account of the sprouting of the bean or the mining of coal.    It can hardly be questioned, moreover, that the real culture which the  child derives from these literary classics is far greater than that  which he would gain from the \"information\" stories so common in the  average second and third readers.

They were very, very poor, and each day they grew poorer and poorer.    At last there was nothing left in the house but leather for one pair of  shoes.    \"I will cut out this last pair of shoes,\" the shoemaker said to his  wife.    \"To-morrow I will sew them and peg them.\"    So he cut out the leather and left it on his bench.    The next morning he went into his shop to make the shoes.    What did he see!    A pair of shoes, all nicely made and ready to be sold.    The stitches were so fine and the shoes so well made that they were  quickly sold.    With the money the poor shoemaker bought leather for two pairs of shoes.    Then he said to his wife, \"I will cut out the leather for two pairs of  shoes.    To-morrow I will sew them and peg them.\"    So he cut out the leather for the shoes and left it on his bench.    The next morning when he went into his shop to make the shoes, what did  he find!    [Illustration]    Yes, there were two pairs of shoes already made.    The work was so well done that those shoes were also sold very quickly.    With the money the poor shoemaker bought enough leather for four pairs  of shoes.    Those he also cut out and left upon his bench.    The next morning he found four pairs of beautiful shoes, all well made.    And so it went on and on. Instead of being a very poor shoemaker, he  became a very rich shoemaker.    His shoes were so well made that even the queen herself wore them.    [Illustration]      THE SHOEMAKER AND THE ELVES--II    At last the shoemaker said to his wife, \"We must find out who makes the  shoes.\"    So one bright moonlight night they hid behind a curtain, where they  could watch the bench and not be seen.    Just on the stroke of midnight, two little elves jumped through the  window.    They went skipping and dancing up to the bench.    Sitting cross-legged they took up the leather and began to work.    How their needles flew back and forth, back and forth!    How their little hammers beat rap-a-tap-tap, rap-a-tap-tap!    Almost before the shoemaker and his wife could think, the work was all  done.    The tiny elves ran about, skipping and dancing, skipping and dancing.    Then, whisk! quick as a wink, they were gone.    The next morning the good shoemaker said to his wife, \"What can we do  for those dear little elves?\"    \"I should like very much to make some clothes for them,\" said his wife.  \"They were almost naked.\"    \"If you will make their coats, I will make them some shoes,\" said the  shoemaker. \"Their little feet were bare.\"    When the clothes and shoes were ready, they were put upon the bench.    [Illustration]    The shoemaker and his wife again hid behind the curtain.    Just as before, when the clock struck twelve, in jumped the tiny elves.    They went skipping and dancing, skipping and dancing, to their work.    They saw the little coats, the tiny stockings, and the neat little  shoes.    They clapped their hands for joy.    Then, slipping on their clothes, they skipped, hand in hand, out of the  window.    The shoemaker and his wife never saw the little elves again, but after  that night, good luck seemed always to be with them.    _English Folk Tale_              THE SHIP        laden  move          I saw a ship a-sailing,        A-sailing on the sea;      And, oh, it was all laden        With pretty things for thee!        There were comfits in the cabin,        And apples in the hold;      The sails were made of silk,        And the masts were made of gold.        The four and twenty sailors        That stood between the decks      Were four and twenty white mice,        With chains about their necks.        The captain was a duck,        With a jacket on his back;      And when the ship began to move,        The captain said, \"Quack! quack!\"          _Old English Rhyme_          [Illustration]    THE WOLF AND THE SEVEN YOUNG KIDS--I    quietly  rough    piece  scissors  learned  thought  chalk  youngest      There was once an old goat who had seven little kids.    She loved them all as much as any mother ever loved her children.    One day the old goat wished to go into the woods to get food for her  kids.    Before she started she called them all to her and said:    \"Dear children, I am going into the woods.    Now do not open the door while I am away.    If the old wolf should get into our hut, he would eat you all up, and  not a hair would be left.    You can easily tell him by his rough voice and his black feet.\"    \"Dear mother,\" cried all the young kids, \"we will be very careful not to  let the old wolf in.    You need not think of us at all, for we shall be quite safe.\"    So the old goat went on her way into the dark woods.    She had not been gone long when there came a loud rap at the door, and a  voice cried:    \"Open the door, my dear children. I have something here for each of  you.\"    But the young kids knew by the rough voice that this was the old wolf.    So one of them said, \"We shall not open the door. Our mother's voice is  soft and gentle. Your voice is rough. You are a wolf.\"    The old wolf ran away to a shop, where he ate a piece of white chalk to  make his voice soft.    Then he went back to the goat's hut and rapped at the door.    He spoke in a soft voice and said, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15663"],[0,"Ancient Egypt (#1)"],[1,"Proofreaders Europe at http://dp.rastko.net.
