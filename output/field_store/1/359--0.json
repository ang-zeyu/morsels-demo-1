He was highly esteemed by some  wits in that reign, as appears from a Poem called Steps to Parnassus,  which pays him the following well turned compliment.      Let Brewer take his artful pen in hand,    Attending muses will obey command,    Invoke the aid of Shakespear's sleeping clay,    And strike from utter darkness new born day.    Mr. Winstanley, and after him Chetwood, has attributed a play to our  author called Lingua, or the Contention of the Tongue and the Five  Senses for Superiority, a Comedy, acted at Cambridge, 1606; but Mr.  Langbaine is of opinion, that neither that, Love's Loadstone,  Landagartha, or Love's Dominion, as Winstanley and Philips affirm, are  his; Landagartha being written by Henry Burnel, esquire, and Love's  Dominion by Flecknoe. In the Comedy called Lingua, there is a  circumstance which Chetwood mentions, too curious, to be omitted here.  When this play was acted at Cambridge, Oliver Cromwel performed the  part of Tactus, which he felt so warmly, that it first fired his  ambition, and, from the possession of an imaginary crown, he stretched  his views to a real one; to accomplish which, he was content to wade  through a sea of blood, and, as Mr. Gray beautifully expresses it,  shut the Gates of Mercy on Mankind; the speech with which he is said  to have been so affected, is the following,        Roses, and bays, pack hence: this crown and robe,    My brows, and body, circles and invests;    How gallantly it fits me! sure the slave    Measured my head, that wrought this coronet;    They lie that say, complexions cannot change!    My blood's enobled, and I am transform'd    Unto the sacred temper of a king;    Methinks I hear my noble Parasites    Stiling me Caesar, or great Alexander,    Licking my feet,--&c.    Mr. Langbaine ascribes to Brewer the two following plays,    Country Girl, a Comedy, often acted with applause, printed in 4to.  1647. This play has been revived since the Restoration, under the  title of Country Innocence, or the Chamber-maid turned Quaker.    Love-sick King, an English Tragical History, with the Life and Death  of Cartesmunda, the Fair Nun of Winchester; printed in 4to. London,  1655; this play was likewise revived 1680, and acted by the name of  the Perjured Nun. The historical part of the plot is founded upon the  Invasion of the Danes, in the reign of King Ethelred and Alfred.    This last play of Anthony Brewer's, is one of the best irregular  plays, next to those of Shakespear, which are in our language. The  story, which is extremely interesting, is conducted, not so much with  art, as spirit; the characters are animated, and the scene busy.  Canutus King of Denmark, after having gained the city of Winchester,  by the villainy of a native, orders all to be put to the sword, and at  last enters the Cloister, raging with the thirst of blood, and panting  for destruction; he meets Cartesmunda, whose beauty stops his ruffian  violence, and melts him, as it were, into a human creature. The  language of this play is as modern, and the verses as musical as those  of Rowe; fire and elevation run through it, and there are many strokes  of the most melting tenderness. Cartesmunda, the Fair Nun of  Winchester, inspires the King with a passion for her, and after a long  struggle between honour and love, she at last yields to the tyrant,  and for the sake of Canutus breaks her vestal vows. Upon hearing that  the enemy was about to enter the Cloister, Cartesmunda breaks out into  the following beautiful exclamation:      The raging foe pursues, defend us Heaven!    Take virgin tears, the balm of martyr'd saints    As tribute due, to thy tribunal throne;    With thy right hand keep us from rage and murder;    Let not our danger fright us, but our sins;    Misfortunes touch our bodies, not our souls.    When Canutus advances, and first sees Cartesmunda, his speech is  poetical, and conceived in the true spirit of Tragedy.      Ha! who holds my conquering hand? what power unknown,    By magic thus transforms me to a statue,    Senseless of all the faculties of life?    My blood runs back, I have no power to strike;    Call in our guards and bid 'em all give o'er.    Sheath up your swords with me, and cease to kill:    Her angel beauty cries, she must not die,    Nor live but mine: O I am strangely touch'd!    Methinks I lift my sword, against myself,    When I oppose her--all perfection!    O see! the pearled dew drops from her eyes;    Arise in peace, sweet soul.    In the same scene the following is extremely beautiful.        I'm struck with light'ning from the torrid zone;    Stand all between me, and that flaming sun!    Go Erkinwald, convey her to my tent.    Let her be guarded with more watchful eyes    Than heaven has stars:    If here she stay I shall consume to death,    'Tis time can give my passions remedy,    Art thou not gone! kill him that gazeth on her;    For all that see her sure must doat like me,    And treason for her, will be wrought"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16494"],[0,"The Transvaal from Within: A Private Record of Public Affairs (#1)"],[1,"TRANSVAAL FROM WITHIN    A Private Record of Public Affairs    BY  J.P. FITZPATRICK  AUTHOR OF 'THE OUTSPAN'      LONDON  WILLIAM HEINEMANN  1899      _Written August, 1896.  Privately circulated June, 1899.  Supplemented and published September 1899._        PREFACE      It was originally designed to compile a statement of the  occurrences of 1895-6 in the Transvaal and of the conditions  which led up to them, in the hope of removing the very grave  misunderstandings which existed. Everybody else had been heard and  judged, the Uitlander had only been judged. It therefore seemed  proper that somebody should attempt to present the case for the  Uitlander. The writer, as a South African by birth, as a resident  in the Transvaal since 1884, and lastly as Secretary of the Reform  Committee, felt impelled to do this, but suffered under the  disability of President Kruger's three years' ban; and although it  might possibly have been urged that a plain statement of facts and  explanations of past actions could not be fairly regarded as a  deliberate interference in politics, the facts themselves when set  out appeared to constitute an indictment so strong as to make it  worth while considering whether the Government of the Transvaal would  not regard it as sufficient excuse to put in force the sentence of  banishment. The postponement of publication which was then decided  upon for a period of three years appeared to be tantamount to the  abandonment of the original purpose, and the work was continued with  the intention of making it a private record to be printed at the  expiry of the term of silence, and to be privately circulated among  those who were personally concerned or interested; a record which  might perhaps be of service some day in filling in a page of South  African history.    The private circulation of that work during June of the present  year led to suggestions from many quarters that it should be  supplemented by a chapter or two dealing with later events and  published; and the present volume is the outcome of these  suggestions.    It is realized that much of what might properly appear in a private  record will be considered rather superfluous in a book designed for  wider circulation. For instance, a good deal of space is given to  details of the trial and the prison life of the Reformers, which are  of no interest whatever to the public, although they form a record  which the men themselves may like to preserve. These might have been  omitted but that the writer desired to make no alterations in the  original text except in the nature of literary revision.    The writer may be charged by the \"peace\" party with deliberately  selecting a critical and anxious time as opportune to contribute a  new factor to those already militating against a peaceful settlement.  Two replies could be made to this: one an excuse and one an answer.  It would be an excuse that the writer did not deliberately select  the time of publication, but that the Transvaal Government in its  wisdom chose to impose silence for three years, and that the project  with which their action had interfered was resumed at the earliest  possible moment. The coincidence of another crisis with the date of  emancipation may be an unlucky coincidence, or it may be a result.  But there is neither necessity nor intention to offer excuses. The  responsibility is accepted and the answer is that a case so sound  needs only to be understood, that a recital of the facts must help  to dispel the mists of race prejudice and misunderstanding which are  obscuring the judgment of many; and that a firm but strictly just  and dignified handling of the question by the Imperial Government  is the only possible way to avert a catastrophe in South Africa. It  is essential therefore that first of all the conditions as they are  should be understood; and this record is offered as a contribution  to that end. Let the measure of its truth be the measure of its  usefulness!    The reader is not invited to believe that the case is presented in  such form as it might have been presented by an impartial historian.  It is the Transvaal _from within_, by one who feels all the  injustice and indignity of the position. With the knowledge, however,  that a good case is spoiled by overstatement and with the desire to  avoid injustice to others an earnest attempt has been made to state  the facts fairly. In how far that attempt has been successful the  reader must decide for himself.    J.P.F.    _July, 1899._          NOTE      It has been impossible to avoid in this volume more or less pointed  reference to certain nationalities in certain connections; for  instance such expressions as \"the Boers,\" \"the Cape Dutch,\" \"the  Hollanders,\" \"the Germans,\" are used. The writer desires to say once  and for all that unless the contrary is obviously and deliberately  indicated, the distinctions between nationalities are intended in the  political sense only and not in the racial sense, and if by mischance  there should be found something in these pages which seems offensive,  he begs the more indulgent interpretation on the ground of a very  earnest desire to remove and not to accentuate race distinctions.    General references are also made to classes--\"the civil service,\"  \"the officials,\" &c. There are officials in the Transvaal service  who would earn the confidence and esteem of the public in any  administration in the world. It is hardly necessary to say that there  is no intention to disparage them.          CONTENTS    PART I.    CHAPTER I. EARLIER DAYS                                            1    CHAPTER II.

When, before resorting to extreme measures to obtain what the  Uitlanders deemed to be their bare rights, the final appeal or  declaration was made on Boxing Day, 1895, in the form of the  manifesto published by the Chairman of the National Union, President  Kruger, after an attentive consideration of the document as  translated to him, remarked grimly: 'Their rights. Yes, they'll get  them--over my dead body!' And volumes of explanation could not better  illustrate the Boer attitude and policy towards the English-speaking  immigrants.    'L'Etat c'est moi' is almost as true of the old Dopper President as  it was of its originator; for in matters of external policy and in  matters which concern the Boer as a party the President has his way  as surely and as completely as any anointed autocrat. To anyone who  has studied the Boers and their ways and policy--who has given more  than passing consideration to the incidents and negotiations of the  present year{01}--it must be clear that President Kruger does  something more than represent the opinion of the people and execute  their policy: he moulds them in the form he wills. By the force of  his own strong convictions and prejudices, and of his indomitable  will, he has made the Boers a people whom he regards as the germ of  the Africander nation; a people chastened, selected, welded, and  strong enough to attract and assimilate all their kindred in South  Africa, and then to realize the dream of a Dutch Republic from the  Zambesi to Capetown.    In the history of South Africa the figure of the grim old President  will loom large and striking--picturesque, as the figure of one who  by his character and will made and held his people; magnificent, as  one who in the face of the blackest fortune never wavered from his  aim or faltered in his effort; who, with a courage that seemed, and  still seems, fatuous, but which may well be called heroic, stood up  against the might of the greatest empire in the world. And, it may  be, pathetic, too, as one whose limitations were great, one whose  training and associations--whose very successes--had narrowed, and  embittered and hardened him; as one who, when the greatness of  success was his to take and to hold, turned his back on the supreme  opportunity, and used his strength and qualities to fight against the  spirit of progress, and all that the enlightenment of the age  pronounces to be fitting and necessary to good government and a  healthy State.    To an English nobleman, who, in the course of an interview, remarked,  'My father was a Minister of England, and twice Viceroy of Ireland,'  the old Dutchman answered, 'And my father was a"]]]
