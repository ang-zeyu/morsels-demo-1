CHAPTER I--ANCIENT CHALDAEA      The Creation, the Deluge, the history of the gods--The country, its  cities its inhabitants, its early dynasties.    [Illustration: 002a.jpg]    \"In the time when nothing which was called heaven existed above, and when  nothing below had as yet received the name of earth,* Apsu, the Ocean,  who first was their father, and Chaos-Tiamat, who gave birth to them  all, mingled their waters in one, reeds which were not united, rushes  which bore no fruit.\"** Life germinated slowly in this inert mass, in  which the elements of our world lay still in confusion: when at length  it did spring up, it was but feebly, and at rare intervals, through  the hatching of divine couples devoid of personality and almost without  form. \"In the time when the gods were not created, not one as yet, when  they had neither been called by their names, nor had their destinies  been assigned to them by fate, gods manifested themselves. Lakhmu and  Lakhamu were the first to appear, and waxed great for ages; then Anshar  and Kishar were produced after them. Days were added to days, and years  were heaped upon years: Anu, Inlil, and Ea were born in their turn, for  Anshar and Kishar had given them birth.\" As the generations emanated one  from the other, their vitality increased, and the personality of each  became more clearly defined; the last generation included none but  beings of an original character and clearly marked individuality. Anu,  the sunlit sky by day, the starlit firmament by night; Inlil-Bel,  the king of the earth; Ea, the sovereign of the waters and the  personification of wisdom.*** Each of them duplicated himself, Anu into  Anat, Bel into Belit, Ea into Damkina, and united himself to the spouse  whom he had deduced from himself. Other divinities sprang from these  fruitful pairs, and the impulse once given, the world was rapidly  peopled by their descendants. Sin, Shamash, and Kamman, who presided  respectively over the moon, the sun, and the air, were all three of  equal rank; next came the lords of the planets, Ninib, Merodach, Nergal,  the warrior-goddess Ishtar, and Nebo; then a whole army of lesser  deities, who ranged themselves around Anu as round a supreme master.  Tiamat, finding her domain becoming more and more restricted owing  to the activity of the others, desired to raise battalion against  battalion, and set herself to create unceasingly; but her offspring,  made in her own image, appeared like those incongruous phantoms which  men see in dreams, and which are made up of members borrowed from a  score of different animals. They appeared in the form of bulls with  human heads, of horses with the snouts of dogs, of dogs with quadruple  bodies springing from a single fish-like tail. Some of them had the beak  of an eagle or a hawk; others, four wings and two faces; others, the  legs and horns of a goat; others, again, the hind quarters of a horse  and the whole body of a man. Tiamat furnished them with terrible  weapons, placed them under the command of her husband Kingu, and set out  to war against the gods.         * In Chaldaea, as in Egypt, nothing was supposed to have a       real existence until it had received its name: the sentence       quoted in the text means practically, that at that time       there was neither heaven nor earth.         ** Apsu has been transliterated kiracruv [in Greek], by the       author an extract from whose works has been preserved by       Damascius. He gives a different version of the tradition,       according to which the amorphous goddess Mummu-Tiamat       consisted of two persons. The first, Tauthe, was the wife of       Apason; the second, Moymis, was the son of Apason and of       Tauthe. The last part of the sentence is very obscure in the       Assyrian text, and has been translated in a variety of       different ways. It seems to contain a comparison between       Apsu and Mummu-Tiamat on the one hand, and the reeds and       clumps of rushes so common in Chaldaea on the other; the two       divinities remain inert and unfruitful, like water-plants       which have not yet manifested their exuberant growth.         *** The first fragments of the Chaldaean account of the       Creation were discovered by G. Smith, who described them in       the _Daily Telegraph_ (of March 4, 1875), and published them       in the _Transactions of the Society of Biblical Archaeology_,       and translated in his Chaldaean account of Genesis all the       fragments with which he was acquainted; other fragments have       since been collected, but unfortunately not enough to enable       us to entirely reconstitute the legend. It covered at least       six tablets, possibly more. Portions of it have been       translated after Smith, by Talbot, by Oppert, by Lenormant,       by Schrader, by Sayce, by Jensen, by Winckler, by Zimmern,       and lastly by Delitzsch. Since G. Smith wrote _The Chaldaean       Account_, a fragment of a different version has been       considered to be a part of the dogma of the Creation, as it       was put forth at Kutha.    [Illustration: 006.jpg ONE OF THE EAGLE-HEADED GENII.]         Drawn by Faucher-Gudin from an Assyrian bas-relief from       Khorsabad    At first they knew not whom to send against her. Anshar despatched his  son Anu; but Anu was afraid, and made no attempt to oppose her. He sent  Ea; but Ea, like Anu, grew pale with fear, and did not venture to attack  her. Merodach, the son of Ea, was the only one who believed himself  strong enough to conquer her. The gods, summoned to a solemn banquet in  the palace of Anshar, unanimously chose him to be their champion, and  proclaimed him king. \"Thou, thou art glorious among the great gods, thy  will is second to none, thy bidding is Anu; Marduk (Merodach), thou art  glorious among the great gods, thy will is second to none,* thy bidding  is Anu.** From this day, that which thou orderest may not be changed,  the power to raise or to abase shall be in thy hand, the word of thy  mouth shall endure, and thy commandment shall not meet with opposition.  None of the gods shall transgress thy law; but wheresoever a sanctuary  of the gods is decorated, the place where they shall give their oracles  shall be thy place.*** Marduk, it is thou who art our avenger! We bestow  on thee the attributes of a king; the whole of all that exists, thou  hast it, and everywhere thy word shall be exalted. Thy weapons shall not  be turned aside, they shall strike thy enemy. O master, who trusts in  thee, spare thou, his life; but the god who hath done evil, put out  his life like water. They clad their champion in a garment, and thus  addressed him: 'Thy will, master, shall be that of the gods. Speak the  word, 'Let it be so,' it shall be so. Thus open thy mouth, this garment  shall disappear; say unto it, 'Return,' and the garment shall be there.\"  He spoke with his lips, the garment disappeared; he said unto it,  \"Return,\" and the garment was restored.         * The Assyrian runs, \"thy destiny is second to none.\" This       refers not to the _destiny_ of the god himself, but to the       fate which he allots to others. I have substituted, here and       elsewhere, for the word \"destiny,\" the special meaning of       which would not have been understood, the word \"will,\"       which, though it does not exactly reproduce the Assyrian       expression, avoids the necessity for paraphrases or formulas       calculated to puzzle the modern reader.         ** Or, to put it less concisely, \"When thou commandest, it       is Anu himself who commands,\" and the same blind obedience       must be paid to thee as to Anu.         *** The meaning is uncertain. The sentence seems to convey       that henceforth Merodach would be at home in all temples       that were constructed in honour of the other gods.    Merodach having been once convinced by this evidence that he had the  power of doing everything and of undoing everything at his pleasure, the  gods handed to him the sceptre, the throne, the crown, the insignia of  supreme rule, and greeted him with their acclamations: \"Be King!--Go!  Cut short the life of Tiamat, and let the wind carry her blood to the  hidden extremities of the universe.\"* He equipped himself carefully for  the struggle. \"He made a bow and placed his mark upon it;\"** he had a  spear brought to him and fitted a point to it; the god lifted the lance,  brandished it in his right hand, then hung the bow and quiver at  his side. He placed a thunderbolt before him, filled his body with a  devouring flame, then made a net in which to catch the anarchic Tiamat;  he placed the four winds in such a way that she could not escape, south  and north, east and west, and with his own hand he brought them the net,  the gift of his father Anu. \"He created the hurricane, the evil wind, the  storm, the tempest, the four winds, the seven winds, the waterspout, the  wind that is second to none; then he let loose the winds he had created,  all seven of them, in order to bewilder the anarchic Tiamat by charging  behind her. And the master of the waterspout raised his mighty weapon,  he mounted his chariot, a work without its"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17324"],[0,"History of Egypt, Chaldæa, Syria, Babylonia, and Assyria, Volume 4 (of 12) (#1)"],[1,"[Illustration: Spines]    [Illustration: Cover]    HISTORY OF EGYPT CHALDEA, SYRIA, BABYLONIA, AND ASSYRIA    By G.

Into such  regions, and to their cost, neighbouring peoples come from century to  century to settle their quarrels and bring to an issue the questions of  supremacy which disturb their little corner of the world. The nations  around are eager for the possession of a country thus situated; it  is seized upon bit by bit, and in the strife dismembered and trodden  underfoot: at best the only course open to its inhabitants is to join  forces with one of its invaders, and while helping the intruder to  overcome the rest, to secure for themselves a position of permanent  servitude. Should some unlooked-for chance relieve them from the  presence of their foreign lord, they will probably be quite incapable of  profiting by the respite which fortune puts in their way, or of making  any effectual attempt to organize themselves in view of future attacks.  They tend to become split up into numerous rival communities, of which  even the pettiest will aim at autonomy, keeping up a perpetual frontier  war for the sake of becoming possessed of or of retaining a glorious  sovereignty over a few acres of corn in the plains, or some wooded  ravines in the mountains. Year after year there will be scenes of bloody  conflict, in which petty armies will fight petty battles on behalf of  petty interests, but so fiercely, and with such furious animosity, that  the country will suffer from the strife as much as, or even more than,  from an invasion. There will be no truce to their struggles until they  all fall under the sway of a foreign master, and, except in the interval  between two conquests, they will have no national existence, their  history being almost entirely merged in that of other nations.    From remote antiquity Syria was in the condition just described,  and thus destined to become subject to foreign rule. Chaldaea, Egypt,  Assyria, and Persia presided in turn over its destinies, while Macedonia  and the empires of the West were only waiting their opportunity to lay  hold of it. By its position it formed a kind of meeting-place where most  of the military nations of the ancient world were bound sooner or later  to come violently into collision. Confined between the sea and the  desert, Syria offers the only route of easy access to an army marching  northwards from Africa into Asia, and all conquerors, whether attracted  to Mesopotamia or to Egypt by the accumulated riches on the banks of the  Euphrates or the Nile, were obliged to pass through it in order to reach  the object of their cupidity. It might, perhaps, have escaped this fatal  consequence of its position, had the formation of the country permitted  its tribes to mass themselves together, and oppose a compact body to  the invading hosts; but the range of mountains which forms its backbone  subdivides it into isolated districts, and by thus restricting each  tribe to a narrow existence maintained among them a mutual antagonism.  The twin chains, the Lebanon and the Anti-Lebanon, which divide the  country down the centre, are composed of the same kind of calcareous  rocks and sandstone, while the same sort of reddish clay has been  deposited on their slopes by the glaciers of the same geological  period.*         * Drake remarked in the Lebanon several varieties of       limestone, which have been carefully catalogued by Blanche       and Lartet. Above these strata, which belong to the Jurassic       formation, come reddish sandstone, then beds of very hard       yellowish limestone, and finally marl. The name Lebanon, in       Assyrian Libnana, would appear to signify \"the white       mountain;\" the Amorites called the Anti-Lebanon Saniru,       Shenir, according to the Assyrian texts and the Hebrew       books.    Arid and bare on the northern side, they sent out towards the south  featureless monotonous ridges, furrowed here and there by short narrow  valleys, hollowed out in places into basins or funnel-shaped ravines,  which are widened year by year by the down-rush of torrents. These  ridges, as they proceed southwards, become clothed with verdure and  offer a more varied outline, the ravines being more thickly wooded, and  the summits less uniform in contour and colouring. Lebanon becomes white  and ice-crowned in winter, but none of its peaks rises to the altitude  of perpetual snows: the highest of them, Mount Timarun, reaches 10,526  feet, while only three others exceed 9000.* Anti-Lebanon is, speaking  generally, 1000 or 1300 feet lower than its neighbour: it becomes  higher, however, towards the south, where the triple peak of Mount  Hermon rises to a height of 9184 feet. The Orontes and the Litany drain  the intermediate space. The Orontes rising on the west side of the  Anti-Lebanon, near the ruins of Baalbek, rushes northwards in such a  violent manner, that the dwellers on its banks call it the rebel--Nahr  el-Asi.** About a third of the way towards its mouth it enters a  depression, which ancient dykes help to transform into a lake; it flows  thence, almost parallel to the sea-coast, as far as the 36th degree of  latitude. There it meets the last spurs of the Amanos, but, failing to  cut its way through them, it turns abruptly to the west, and then to the  south, falling into the Mediterranean after having received an increase  to its volume from the waters of the Afrin.         * Bukton-Drake, Unexplored Syria, vol. i. p. 88, attributed       to it an altitude of 9175 English feet; others estimate it       at 10,539 feet. The mountains which exceed 3000 metres are       Dahr el-Kozib, 3046 metres; Jebel-Mislriyah, 3080 metres;       and Jebel-Makhmal or Makmal, 3040 metres. As a matter of       fact, these heights are not yet determined with the accuracy       desirable.         ** The Egyptians knew it in early times by the name of       Aunrati, or Araunti; it is mentioned in Assyrian       inscriptions under the name of Arantu. All are agreed in       acknowledging that this name is not Semitic, and an Aryan       origin is attributed to it, but without convincing proof;       according to Strabo (xvi. ii. Sec. 7, p. 750), it was       originally called Typhon, and was only styled Orontes after       a certain Orontes had built the first bridge across it. The       name of Axios which it sometimes bears appears to have been       given to it by Greek colonists, in memory of a river in       Macedonia. This is probably the origin of the modern name of       Asi, and the meaning, _rebellious river_, which Arab       tradition attaches to the latter term, probably comes from a       popular etymology which likened Axios to Asi, the       identification was all the easier since it justifies the       epithet by the violence of"]]]
