The textile art is one of the most ancient known, dating back to the  very inception of culture. In primitive times it occupied a wide  field, embracing the stems of numerous branches of industry now  expressed in other materials or relegated to distinct systems of  construction. Accompanying the gradual narrowing of its sphere there  was a steady development with the general increase of intelligence and  skill so that with the cultured nations of to-day it takes an  important, though unobtrusive, place in the hierarchy of the arts.    Woven fabrics include all those products of art in which the elements  or parts employed in construction are largely filamental and are  combined by methods conditioned chiefly by their flexibility. The  processes employed are known by such terms as interlacing, plaiting,  netting, weaving, sewing, and embroidering.    The materials used at first are chiefly filiform vegetal growths, such  as twigs, leaves, roots, and grasses, but later on filiform and then  fibrous elements from all the kingdoms of nature, as well as numerous  artificial preparations, are freely used. These are employed in the  single, doubled, doubled and twisted, and plaited conditions, and are  combined by the hands alone, by the hands assisted by simple devices,  by hand looms, and finally in civilization by machine looms.    The products are, first, individual structures or articles, such as  shelters, baskets, nets, and garments, or integral parts of these;  and, second, \"piece\" goods, such as are not adapted to use until they  are cut and fitted. In earlier stages of art we have to deal almost  exclusively with the former class, as the tailor and the house  furnisher are evolved with civilization.    In their bearing upon art these products are to be studied chiefly  with reference to three grand divisions of phenomena, the first of  which I shall denominate _constructive_, the second _functional_, and  the third _esthetic_. The last class, with which this paper has almost  exclusively to deal, is composed mainly of what may be called the  superconstructive and superfunctional features of the art and includes  three subdivisions of phenomena, connected respectively with ("]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17740"],[0,"The Chemistry of Hat Manufacturing (#1)"],[1,"CHEMISTRY    OF    HAT MANUFACTURING      LECTURES DELIVERED BEFORE THE HAT MANUFACTURERS' ASSOCIATION    BY    WATSON SMITH, F.C.S., F.I.C.

PREFACE      The subject-matter in this little book is the substance of a series of  Lectures delivered before the Hat Manufacturers' Association in the  years 1887 and 1888.    About this period, owing to the increasing difficulties of competition  with the products of the German Hat Manufacturers, a deputation of Hat  Manufacturers in and around Manchester consulted Sir Henry E. Roscoe,  F.R.S., then the Professor of Chemistry in the Owens College,  Manchester, and he advised the formation of an Association, and the  appointment of a Lecturer, who was to make a practical investigation of  the art of Hat Manufacturing, and then to deliver a series of lectures  on the applications of science to this industry. Sir Henry Roscoe  recommended the writer, then the Lecturer on Chemical Technology in the  Owens College, as lecturer, and he was accordingly appointed.    The lectures were delivered with copious experimental illustrations  through two sessions, and during the course a patent by one of the  younger members became due, which proved to contain the solution of the  chief difficulty of the British felt-hat manufacturer (see pages 66-68).  This remarkable coincidence served to give especial stress to the wisdom  of the counsel of Sir Henry Roscoe, whose response to the appeal of the  members of the deputation of 1887 was at once to point them to  scientific light and training as their only resource. In a letter  recently received from Sir Henry (1906), he writes: \"I agree with you  that this is a good instance of the _direct money value_ of scientific  training, and in these days of 'protection' and similar subterfuges, it  is not amiss to emphasise the fact.\"    It is thus gratifying to the writer to think that the lectures have had  some influence on the remarkable progress which the British Hat Industry  has made in the twenty years that have elapsed since their delivery.    These lectures were in part printed and published in the _Hatters'  Gazette_, and in part in newspapers of Manchester and Stockport, and  they have here been compiled and edited, and the necessary illustrations  added, etc., by Mr. Albert Shonk, to whom I would express my best  thanks.

It is absolutely necessary, in order to  obtain a useful knowledge of the peculiarities and properties of animal  fibres generally, or even specially, that we should be, at least to some  extent, familiar with those of the vegetable fibres. I shall therefore  have, in the first place, something to tell you of certain principal  vegetable fibres before we commence the more special study of the animal  fibres most interesting to you as hat manufacturers, namely, wool, fur,  and hair. What cotton is as a vegetable product I shall not in detail  describe, but I will refer you to the interesting and complete work of  Dr. Bowman, _On the Structure of the Cotton Fibre_. Suffice it to say  that in certain plants and trees the seeds or fruit are surrounded, in  the pods in which they develop, with a downy substance, and that the  cotton shrub belongs to this class of plants. A fibre picked out from  the mass of the downy substance referred to, and examined under the  microscope, is found to be a spirally twisted band; or better, an  irregular, more or less flattened and twisted tube (see Fig. 1). We know  it is a tube, because on taking a thin, narrow slice across a fibre and  examining the slice under the microscope, we can see the hole or  perforation up the centre, forming the axis of the tube (see Fig. 2).  Mr. H. de Mosenthal, in an extremely interesting and valuable paper (see  _J.S.C.I._,[1] 1904, vol. xxiii. p. 292), has recently shown that the  cuticle of the cotton fibre is extremely porous, having, in addition to  pores, what appear to be minute stomata, the latter being frequently  arranged in oblique rows, as if they led into oblique lateral channels.  A cotton fibre varies from 2.5 to 6 centimetres in length, and in  breadth from 0.017 to 0.05 millimetre. The characteristics mentioned  make it very easy to distinguish cotton from other vegetable or animal  fibres. For example, another vegetable fibre is flax, or linen, and this  has a very different appearance under the microscope (_see_ Fig. 3). It  has a bamboo-like, or jointed appearance; its tubes are not flattened,  nor are they twisted. Flax belongs to a class called the bast fibres, a  name given to certain fibres obtained from the inner bark of different  plants. Jute also is a bast fibre. The finer qualities of it look like  flax, but, as we shall see, it is not chemically identical with cotton,  as linen or flax is. Another vegetable fibre, termed \"cotton-silk,\" from  its beautiful, lustrous, silky appearance, has excited some attention,  because it grows freely in the German colony called the Camaroons, and  also on the Gold Coast. This fibre, under the microscope, differs  entirely in appearance from both cotton and flax fibres. Its fibres  resemble straight and thin, smooth, transparent, almost glassy tubes,  with large axial bores; in fact, if wetted in water you can see the  water and air bubbles in the tubes under the microscope. A more detailed  account of \"cotton-silk\" appears in a paper read by me before the  Society of Chemical Industry in 1886 (see _J.S.C.I._, 1886, vol. v. p.  642). Now the substance of the cotton, linen or flax, as well as that of  the cotton-silk fibres, is termed, chemically, cellulose. Raw cotton  consists of cellulose with about 5 per cent. of impurities. This  cellulose is a chemical compound of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, and,  according to the relative proportions of these constituents, it has had  the chemical formula C_{6}H_{10}O_{5} assigned to it. Each letter  stands for an atom of each constituent named, and the numerals tell us  the number of the constituent atoms in the whole compound atom of  cellulose. This cellulose is closely allied in composition to starch,  dextrin, and a form of sugar called glucose. It is possible to convert  cotton rags into this form of sugar--glucose--by treating first with  strong vitriol or sulphuric acid, and then boiling with dilute acid for  a long time. Before we leave these vegetable or cellulose fibres, I will  give you a means of testing them, so as to enable you to distinguish  them broadly from the animal fibres, amongst which are silk, wool, fur,  and hair. A good general test to distinguish a vegetable and an animal  fibre is the following, which is known as Molisch's test: To a very  small quantity, about 0.01 gram, of the well-washed cotton fibre, 1 c.c.  of water is added, then two to three drops of a 15 to 20 per cent.  solution of alpha-naphthol in alcohol, and finally an excess of  concentrated sulphuric acid; on agitating, a deep violet colour is  developed. By using thymol in place of the alpha-naphthol, a  red or scarlet colour is produced. If the fibre were one of an animal  nature, merely a yellow or greenish-yellow coloured solution would  result. I told you, however, that jute is not chemically identical with  cotton and linen. The substance of its fibre has been termed \"bastose\"  by Cross and Bevan, who have investigated it. It is not identical with  ordinary cellulose, for if we take a little of the jute, soak it in  dilute acid, then in chloride of lime or hypochlorite of soda, and  finally pass it through a bath of sulphite of soda, a beautiful crimson  colour develops upon it, not developed in the case of cellulose (cotton,  linen, etc.). It is certain that it is a kind of cellulose, but still  not identical with true cellulose. All animal fibres, when burnt, emit a  peculiar empyreumatic odour resembling that from burnt feathers, an  odour which no vegetable fibre under like circumstances emits. Hence a  good test is to burn a piece of the fibre in a lamp flame, and"]]]
