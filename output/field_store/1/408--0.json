Among the Navajo Indians there are many smiths, who sometimes forge iron  and brass, but who work chiefly in silver. When and how the art of  working metals was introduced among them I have not been able to  determine; but there are many reasons for supposing that they have long  possessed it; many believe that they are not indebted to the Europeans  for it. Doubtless the tools obtained from American and Mexican traders  have influenced their art. Old white residents of the Navajo country  tell me that the art has improved greatly within their recollection;  that the ornaments made fifteen years ago do not compare favorably with  those made at the present time; and they attribute this change largely  to the recent introduction of fine files and emery-paper. At the time of  the Conquest the so-called civilized tribes of Mexico had attained  considerable skill in the working of metal, and it has been inferred  that in the same period the sedentary tribes of New Mexico also wrought  at the forge. From either of these sources the first smiths among the  Navajos may have learned their trade; but those who have seen the  beautiful gold ornaments made by the rude Indians of British Columbia  and Alaska, many of whom are allied in language to the Navajos, may  doubt that the latter derived their art from a people higher in culture  than themselves.    The appliances and processes of the smith are much the same among the  Navajos as among the Pueblo Indians. But the Pueblo artisan, living in a  spacious house, builds a permanent forge on a frame at such a height  that he can work standing, while his less fortunate Navajo _confrere_,  dwelling in a low hut or shelter, which he may abandon any day,  constructs a temporary forge on the ground in the manner hereafter  described. Notwithstanding the greater disadvantages under which the  latter labors, the ornaments made by his hand are generally conceded to  be equal or even superior to those made by the Pueblo Indian.    A large majority of these savage smiths make only such simple articles  as buttons, rosettes, and bracelets; those who make the more elaborate  articles, such as powder-chargers, round beads (Pl. XVI), tobacco cases,  belts, and bridle ornaments are few. Tobacco cases, made in the shape of  an army canteen, such as that represented in Fig. 6, are made by only  three or four men in the tribe, and the design is of very recent origin.    Their tools and materials are few and simple; and rude as the results of  their labor may appear, it is surprising that they do so well with such  imperfect appliances, which usually consist of the following articles: A  forge, a bellows, an anvil, crucibles, molds, tongs, scissors, pliers,  files, awls, cold-chisels, matrix and die for molding buttons, wooden  implement used in grinding buttons, wooden stake, basin, charcoal, tools  and materials for soldering (blow-pipe, braid of cotton rags soaked in  grease, wire, and borax), materials for polishing (sand-paper,  emery-paper, powdered sandstone, sand, ashes, and solid stone), and  materials for whitening (a native mineral substance--almogen--salt and  water). Fig. 1, taken from a photograph, represents the complete shop of  a silversmith, which was set up temporarily in a summer lodge or  _hogan_, near Fort Wingate. Fragments of boards, picked up around the  fort, were used, in part, in the construction of the _hogan_, an old  raisin-box was made to serve as the curb or frame of the forge, and  these things detracted somewhat from the aboriginal aspect of the place.    A forge built in an outhouse on my own premises by an Indian  silversmith, whom I employed to work where I could constantly observe  him, was twenty-three inches long, sixteen inches broad, five inches in  height to the edge of the fire-place, and the latter, which was  bowl-shaped, was eight inches in diameter and three inches deep. No  other Navajo forge that I have seen differed materially in size or shape  from this. The Indian thus constructed it: In the first place, he  obtained a few straight sticks--four would have sufficed--and laid them  on the ground to form a frame or curb; then he prepared some mud, with  which he filled the frame, and which he piled up two inches above the  latter, leaving the depression for the fire-place. Before the structure  of mud was completed he laid in it the wooden nozzle of the bellows,  where it was to remain, with one end about six inches from the  fire-place, and the other end projecting about the same distance beyond  the frame; then he stuck into the nozzle a round piece of wood, which  reached from the nozzle to the fire-place, and when the mud work was  finished the stick was withdrawn, leaving an uninflammable tweer. When  the structure of mud was completed a flat rock about four inches thick  was laid on at the head of the forge--the end next to the bellows--to  form a back to the fire, and lastly the bellows was tied on to the  nozzle, which, as mentioned above, was built into the forge, with a  portion projecting to receive the bellows. The task of constructing this  forge did not occupy more than an hour.    [Illustration: PL. XVI. OBJECTS IN SILVER.]    A bellows, of the kind most commonly used, consists of a tube or bag of  goatskin, about twelve inches in length and about ten inches in  diameter, tied at one end to its nozzle and nailed at the other to a  circular disk of wood, in which is the valve. This disk has two arms:  one above for a handle and the other below for a support. Two or more  rings or hoops of wood are placed in the skin-tube to keep it distended,  while the tube is constricted between the hoops with buckskin thongs,  and thus divided into a number of compartments, as shown in Pl. XVII.  The nozzle is made of four pieces of wood tied together and rounded on  the outside so as to form a cylinder about ten inches long and three  inches in diameter, with a quadrangular hole in the center about one  inch square. The bellows is worked by horizontal movements of the arm. I  have seen among the Navajos one double-chambered bellows with a  sheet-iron tweer. This bellows was about the same size as the single  chambered one described above. It was also moved horizontally, and by  means of an iron rod passing from one end to the other and attached to  the disks, one chamber was opened at the same time that the other was  closed, and _vice versa_. This gave a more constant current of air than  the single-chambered implement, but not as steady a blast as the bellows  of our blacksmiths. Such a bellows, too, I have seen in the Pueblo of  Zuni.    For an anvil they usually use any suitable piece of iron they may happen  to pick up, as for instance an old wedge or a large bolt, such as the  king-bolt of a wagon. A wedge or other large fragment of iron may be  stuck in the ground to steady it. A bolt is maintained in position by  being driven into a log. Hard stones are still sometimes used for anvils  and perhaps they were, at one time, the only anvils they possessed.    Crucibles are made by the more careful smiths of clay, baked hard, and  they are nearly the same shape as those used by our metallurgists,  having three-cornered edges and rounded bottoms. They are usually about  two inches in every dimension.    Fig. 1, Pl. XVIII represents one of ordinary shape and size, which I  have in my collection. The Navajos are not good potters; their  earthenware being limited to these crucibles and a few unornamented  water-jars; and it is probably in consequence of their inexperience in  the ceramic art that their crucibles are not durable. After being put in  the fire two or three times they swell and become very porous, and when  used for a longer time they often crack and fall to pieces. Some smiths,  instead of making crucibles, melt their metal in suitable fragments of  Pueblo pottery, which may be picked up around ruins in many localities  throughout the Navajo country or purchased from the Pueblo Indians.    The moulds in which they cast their ingots, cut in soft sandstone with a  home-made chisel, are so easily formed that the smith leaves them behind  when he moves his residence. Each mould is cut approximately in the  shape of the article which is to be wrought out of the ingot cast in it,  and it is greased with suet before the metal is poured in. In Figs. 2  and 3, Pl. XVIII, are represented pieces of sand-stone, graven for  molds, now in my possession. The figures are one-third the dimensions of  the subjects. In the middle cavity or mould shown in Fig. 2, Pl. XVIII,  was cast the ingot from which was wrought the arrow-shaped handle of  the powder-charger shown in Pl. XIX; in the lower cavity depicted in the  same figure was moulded the piece from which the bowl of this charger  was formed. The circular depression, delineated in the lower right  corner of Fig. 3, Pl. XVIII, gave form to the ingot from which the sides  of the canteen-shaped tobacco-case (Fig. 6) was made.    Tongs are often made by the Navajo silversmiths. One of these which I  saw had a U-shaped spring joint, and the ends were bent at right angles  downwards, so as more effectually to grasp the flat-sided"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1728"],[0,"The Odyssey of Homer (#1)"],[1,"ODYSSEY OF HOMER    DONE INTO ENGLISH PROSE    by S. H. BUTCHER, M.A.    AND    A. LANG, M.A.          PREFACE.    There would have been less controversy about the proper  method of Homeric translation, if critics had recognised  that the question is a purely relative one, that of Homer  there can be no final translation. The taste and the  literary habits of each age demand different qualities in  poetry, and therefore a different sort of rendering of  Homer. To the men of the time of Elizabeth, Homer would  have appeared bald, it seems, and lacking in ingenuity, if  he had been presented in his antique simplicity. For the  Elizabethan age, Chapman supplied what was then necessary,  and the mannerisms that were then deemed of the essence of  poetry, namely, daring and luxurious conceits. Thus in  Chapman's verse Troy must 'shed her towers for tears of  overthrow,' and when the winds toss Odysseus about, their  sport must be called 'the horrid tennis.'    In the age of Anne, 'dignity' and 'correctness' had to be  given to Homer, and Pope gave them by aid of his dazzling  rhetoric, his antitheses, his _netteté_, his command of every  conventional and favourite artifice. Without Chapman's  conceits, Homer's poems would hardly have been what the  Elizabethans took for poetry; without Pope's smoothness,  and Pope's points, the Iliad and Odyssey would have seemed  rude, and harsh in the age of Anne. These great  translations must always live as English poems. As  transcripts of Homer they are like pictures drawn from a  lost point of view. Chaque siecle depuis le xvi a ue de ce  cote son belveder different. Again, when Europe woke to a  sense, an almost exaggerated and certainly uncritical  sense, of the value of her songs of the people, of all the  ballads that Herder, Scott, Lonnrot, and the rest  collected, it was commonly said that Homer was a  ballad-minstrel, that the translator must imitate the  simplicity, and even adopt the formulae of the ballad.  Hence came the renderings of Maginn, the experiments of Mr.  Gladstone, and others. There was some excuse for the error  of critics who asked for a Homer in ballad rhyme. The Epic  poet, the poet of gods and heroes, did indeed inherit some  of the formulae of the earlier Volks-lied. Homer, like the  author of The Song of Roland, like the singers of the  Kalevala, uses constantly recurring epithets, and repeats,  word for word, certain emphatic passages, messages, and so  on. That custom is essential in the ballad, it is an  accident not the essence of the epic. The epic is a poem of  complete and elaborate art, but it still bears some  birthmarks, some signs of the early popular chant, out of  which it sprung, as the garden-rose springs from the wild  stock, When this is recognised the demand for ballad-like  simplicity and 'ballad-slang' ceases to exist, and then all  Homeric translations in the ballad manner cease to  represent our conception of Homer. After the belief in the  ballad manner follows the recognition of the romantic vein  in Homer, and, as a result, came Mr. Worsley's admirable  Odyssey. This masterly translation does all that can be  done for the Odyssey in the romantic style. The smoothness  of the verse, the wonderful closeness to the original,  reproduce all of Homer, in music and in meaning, that can  be rendered in English verse. There still, however, seems  an aspect Homeric poems, and a demand in connection with  Homer to be recognised, and to be satisfied.    Sainte-Beuve says, with reference probably to M. Leconte de  Lisle's prose version of the epics, that some people treat  the epics too much as if the were sagas. Now the Homeric  epics are sagas, but then they are the sagas of the divine  heroic age of Greece, and thus are told with an art which  is not the art of the Northern poets. The epics are stories  about the adventures of men living in most respects like  the men of our own race who dwelt in Iceland, Norway,  Denmark, and Sweden. The epics are, in a way, and as far as  manners and institutions are concerned, historical  documents. Whoever regards them in this way, must wish to  read them exactly as they have reached us, without modern  ornament, with nothing added or omitted. He must recognise,  with Mr. Matthew Arnold, that what he now wants, namely,  the simple truth about the matter of the poem, can only be  given in prose, 'for in a verse translation no original  work is any longer recognisable.' It is for this reason  that we have attempted to tell once more, in simple prose,  the story of Odysseus. We have tried to transfer, not all  the truth about the poem, but the historical truth, into  English. In this process Homer must lose at least half his  charm, his bright and equable speed, the musical current of  that narrative, which, like the river of Egypt, flows from  an indiscoverable source, and mirrors the temples and the  palaces of unforgotten gods and kings. Without this music  of verse, only a half truth about Homer can be told, but  then it is that half of the truth which, at this moment, it  seems most necessary to tell. This is the half of the truth  that the translators who use verse cannot easily tell. They  MUST be adding to Homer, talking with Pope about 'tracing  the mazy lev'ret o'er the lawn,' or with Mr. Worsley about  the islands that are 'stars of the blue Aegaean,' or with  Dr. Hawtrey about 'the earth's soft arms,' when Homer says  nothing at all about the 'mazy lev'ret,' or the 'stars of  the blue Aegaean,' or the 'soft arms' of earth. It would be  impertinent indeed to blame any of these translations in  their place. They give that which the romantic reader of  poetry, or the student of the age of Anne, looks for in  verse; and without tags of this sort, a translation of  Homer in verse cannot well be made to hold together.    There can be then, it appears, no final English translation  of Homer. In each there must be, in addition to what is  Greek and eternal, the element of what is modern, personal,  and fleeting. Thus we trust that there may be room for 'the  pale and far-off shadow of a prose translation,' of which  the aim is limited and humble. A prose translation cannot  give the movement and the fire of a successful translation  in verse; it only gathers, as it were, the crumbs which  fall from the richer table, only tells the story, without  the song. Yet to a prose translation is permitted, perhaps,  that close adherence to the archaisms of the epic, which in  verse become mere oddities. The double epithets, the  recurring epithets of Homer, if rendered into verse, delay  and puzzle the reader, as the Greek does not delay or  puzzle him. In prose he may endure them, or even care to  study them as the survivals of a stage of taste, which is  to be found in its prime in the sagas. These double and  recurring epithets of Homer are a softer form of the quaint  Northern periphrases, which make the sea the 'swan's bath,'  gold, the 'dragon's hoard,' men, the 'ring-givers,' and so  on. We do not know whether it is necessary to defend our  choice of a somewhat antiquated prose. Homer has no ideas  which cannot be expressed in words that are 'old and  plain,' and to words that are old and plain, and, as a  rule, to such terms as, being used by the Translators of  the Bible, are still not unfamiliar, we have tried to  restrict ourselves. It may be objected, that the employment  of language which does not come spontaneously to the lips,  is an affectation out of place in a version of the Odyssey.  To this we may answer that the Greek Epic dialect, like the  English of our Bible, was a thing of slow growth and  composite nature, that it was never a spoken language, nor,  except for certain poetical purposes, a written language.  Thus the Biblical English seems as nearly analogous to the  Epic Greek, as anything that our tongue has to offer.    The few foot-notes in this book are chiefly intended to  make clear some passages where there is a choice of  reading. The notes at the end, which we would like to have  written in the form of essays, and in company with more  complete philological and archaeological studies, are  chiefly meant to elucidate the life of Homer's men. We have  received much help from many friends, and especially from  Mr. R. W. Raper, Fellow of Trinity College, Oxford and Mr.  Gerald Balfour, Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge, who  has aided us with many suggestions while the book was  passing through the press.    In the interpretation of B. i.411, ii.191, v.90, and 471,  we have departed from the received view, and followed Mr.  Raper, who, however, has not been able to read through the  proof-sheets further than Book xii.    We have adopted La Roche's text (Homeri Odyssea, J. La  Roche, Leipzig, 1867), except in a few cases where we  mention our reading in a foot-note.    The Arguments prefixed to the Books are taken, with very  slight alterations, from Hobbes' Translation of the  Odyssey.    It is hoped that the Introduction added to the second  edition may illustrate the growth of those national legends  on which Homer worked, and may elucidate the plot of the  Odyssey.        PREFACE TO THE THIRD EDITION.    Wet owe our thanks to the Rev. E. Warre, of Eton College,  for certain corrections on nautical points. In particular,  he has convinced us that the raft of Odysseus in B. v. is a  raft strictly so called, and that it is not, under the  poet's description, elaborated into a ship, as has been  commonly supposed. The translation of the passage (B.  v.246-261) is accordingly altered.        INTRODUCTION    COMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.    The Odyssey is generally supposed to be somewhat the later  in date of the two most ancient Greek poems which are  concerned with the events and consequences of the Trojan  war. As to the actual history of that war, it may be said  that nothing is known. We may conjecture that some contest  between peoples of more or less "]]]
