INTRODUCTORY    The subject of Religious Origins is a fascinating one, as the great  multitude of books upon it, published in late years, tends to show.  Indeed the great difficulty to-day in dealing with the subject, lies in  the very mass of the material to hand--and that not only on account of  the labor involved in sorting the material, but because the abundance  itself of facts opens up temptation to a student in this department of  Anthropology (as happens also in other branches of general Science) to  rush in too hastily with what seems a plausible theory. The more facts,  statistics, and so forth, there are available in any investigation, the  easier it is to pick out a considerable number which will fit a given  theory. The other facts being neglected or ignored, the views put  forward enjoy for a time a great vogue. Then inevitably, and at a later  time, new or neglected facts alter the outlook, and a new perspective is  established.    There is also in these matters of Science (though many scientific men  would doubtless deny this) a great deal of \"Fashion\". Such has been  notoriously the case in Political Economy, Medicine, Geology, and even  in such definite studies as Physics and Chemistry. In a comparatively  recent science, like that with which we are now concerned, one would  naturally expect variations. A hundred and fifty years ago, and since  the time of Rousseau, the \"Noble Savage\" was extremely popular; and he  lingers still in the story books of our children. Then the reaction from  this extreme view set in, and of late years it has been the popular cue  (largely, it must be said, among \"armchair\" travelers and explorers)  to represent the religious rites and customs of primitive folk as a  senseless mass of superstitions, and the early man as quite devoid of  decent feeling and intelligence. Again, when the study of religious  origins first began in modern times to be seriously taken up--say in the  earlier part of last century--there was a great boom in Sungods. Every  divinity in the Pantheon was an impersonation of the Sun--unless indeed  (if feminine) of the Moon. Apollo was a sungod, of course; Hercules was  a sungod; Samson was a sungod; Indra and Krishna, and even Christ, the  same. C. F. Dupuis in France (Origine de tous les Cultes, 1795), F. Nork  in Germany (Biblische Mythologie, 1842), Richard Taylor in England (The  Devil's Pulpit, (1) 1830), were among the first in modern times to put  forward this view. A little later the PHALLIC explanation of everything  came into fashion. The deities were all polite names for the organs and  powers of procreation. R. P. Knight (Ancient Art and Mythology,  1818) and Dr. Thomas Inman (Ancient Faiths and Ancient Names, 1868)  popularized this idea in England; so did Nork in Germany. Then again  there was a period of what is sometimes called Euhemerism--the theory  that the gods and goddesses had actually once been men and women,  historical characters round whom a halo of romance and remoteness  had gathered. Later still, a school has arisen which thinks little of  sungods, and pays more attention to Earth and Nature spirits, to gnomes  and demons and vegetation-sprites, and to the processes of Magic by  which these (so it was supposed) could be enlisted in man's service if  friendly, or exorcised if hostile.       (1) This extraordinary book, though carelessly composed and  containing many unproven statements, was on the whole on the right  lines. But it raised a storm of opposition--the more so because its  author was a clergyman! He was ejected from the ministry, of course, and  was sent to prison twice.      It is easy to see of course that there is some truth in ALL these  explanations; but naturally each school for the time being makes the  most of its own contention. Mr. J. M. Robertson (Pagan Christs and  Christianity and Mythology), who has done such fine work in this field,  (1) relies chiefly on the solar and astronomical origins, though he does  not altogether deny the others; Dr. Frazer, on the other hand--whose  great work, The Golden Bough, is a monumental collection of primitive  customs, and will be an inexhaustible quarry for all future students--is  apparently very little concerned with theories about the Sun and the  stars, but concentrates his attention on the collection of innumerable  details (2) of rites, chiefly magical, connected with food and  vegetation. Still later writers, like S. Reinach, Jane Harrison and  E. A. Crowley, being mainly occupied with customs of very primitive  peoples, like the Pelasgian Greeks or the Australian aborigines, have  confined themselves (necessarily) even more to Magic and Witchcraft.     (1) If only he did not waste so much time, and so needlessly, in  slaughtering opponents!     (2) To such a degree, indeed, that sometimes the connecting clue  of the argument seems to be lost.      Meanwhile the Christian Church from these speculations has kept itself  severely apart--as of course representing a unique and divine revelation  little concerned or interested in such heathenisms; and moreover (in  this country at any rate) has managed to persuade the general public  of its own divine uniqueness to such a degree that few people, even  nowadays, realize that it has sprung from just the same root as  Paganism, and that it shares by far the most part of its doctrines and  rites with the latter. Till quite lately it was thought (in Britain)  that only secularists and unfashionable people took any interest in  sungods; and while it was true that learned professors might point to a  belief in Magic as one of the first sources of Religion, it was easy in  reply to say that this obviously had nothing to do with Christianity!  The Secularists, too, rather spoilt their case by assuming, in their  wrath against the Church, that all priests since the beginning of  the world have been frauds and charlatans, and that all the rites of  religion were merely devil's devices invented by them for the purpose of  preying upon the superstitions of the ignorant, to their own enrichment.  They (the Secularists) overleaped themselves by grossly exaggerating a  thing that no doubt is partially true.    Thus the subject of religious origins is somewhat complex, and yields  many aspects for consideration. It is only, I think, by keeping a broad  course and admitting contributions to the truth from various sides, that  valuable results can be obtained. It is absurd to suppose that in this  or any other science neat systems can be found which will cover all the  facts. Nature and History do not deal in such things, or supply them for  a sop to Man's vanity.    It is clear that there have been three main lines, so far, along which  human speculation and study have run. One connecting religious rites and  observations with the movements of the Sun and the planets in the sky,  and leading to the invention of and belief in Olympian and remote gods  dwelling in heaven and ruling the Earth from a distance; the second  connecting religion with the changes of the season, on the Earth and  with such practical things as the growth of vegetation and food, and  leading to or mingled with a vague belief in earth-spirits and magical  methods of influencing such spirits; and the third connecting religion  with man's own body and the tremendous force of sex residing in  it--emblem of undying life and all fertility and power. It is clear  also--and all investigation confirms it--that the second-mentioned phase  of religion arose on the whole BEFORE the first-mentioned--that is, that  men naturally thought about the very practical questions of food and  vegetation, and the magical or other methods of encouraging the same,  before they worried themselves about the heavenly bodies and the laws of  THEIR movements, or about the sinister or favorable influences the stars  might exert. And again it is extremely probable that the third-mentioned  aspect--that which connected religion with the procreative desires and  phenomena of human physiology--really came FIRST. These desires and  physiological phenomena must have loomed large on the primitive mind  long before the changes of the seasons or of the sky had been at all  definitely observed or considered. Thus we find it probable that, in  order to understand the sequence of the actual and historical phases of  religious worship, we must approximately reverse the order above-given  in which they have been STUDIED, and conclude that in general the  Phallic cults came first, the cult of Magic "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15620"],[0,"Recreations in Astronomy (#1)"],[1,"[Page ii]  [Illustration: THE CONSTELLATIONS OF ORION AND TAURUS.

AUTHOR OF \"SIGHTS AND INSIGHTS; OR, KNOWLEDGE BY TRAVEL,\" ETC.      WITH EIGHTY-THREE ILLUSTRATIONS AND MAPS OF STARS        [Page v]  [Greek:    TAEI PSUCHAEI    TAEI AGAPAETAEI    ASTRAPOUSAEI    KAI    ISAGGEDOI]          [Page vii]  PREFACE.    All sciences are making an advance, but Astronomy is moving at the  double-quick. Since the principles of this science were settled  by Copernicus, four hundred years ago, it has never had to beat  a retreat. It is rewritten not to correct material errors, but  to incorporate new discoveries.    Once Astronomy treated mostly of tides, seasons, and telescopic  aspects of the planets; now these are only primary matters. Once  it considered stars as mere fixed points of light; now it studies  them as suns, determines their age, size, color, movements, chemical  constitution, and the revolution of their planets. Once it considered  space as empty; now it knows that every cubic inch of it quivers with  greater intensity of force than that which is visible in Niagara.  Every inch of surface that can be conceived of between suns is more  wave-tossed than the ocean in a storm.    The invention of the telescope constituted one era in Astronomy;  its perfection in our day, another; and the discoveries of the  spectroscope a third--no less important than either of the others.    While nearly all men are prevented from practical experimentation  in these high realms of knowledge, few [Page viii] have so little  leisure as to be debarred from intelligently enjoying the results  of the investigations of others.    This book has been written not only to reveal some of the highest  achievements of the human mind, but also to let the heavens declare  the glory of the Divine Mind. In the author's judgment, there is no  gulf that separates science and religion, nor any conflict where  they stand together. And it is fervently hoped that anyone who  comes to a better knowledge of God's works through reading this  book, may thereby come to a more intimate knowledge of the Worker.    I take great pleasure in acknowledging my indebtedness to J. M.  Van Vleck, LL.D., of the U.S. Nautical Almanac staff, and Professor  of Astronomy at the Wesleyan University, for inspecting some of the  more important chapters; to Dr. S. S. White, of Philadelphia, for  telescopic advantages; to Professor Henry Draper, for furnishing,  in advance of publication, a photograph of the sun's corona in 1878;  and to the excellent work on \"Popular Astronomy,\" by Professor  Simon Newcomb, LL.D., Professor U. S. Naval Observatory, for some  of the most recent information, and for the use of the unequalled  engravings of Jupiter, Saturn, and the great nebula of Orion.          [Page ix]  CONTENTS.
