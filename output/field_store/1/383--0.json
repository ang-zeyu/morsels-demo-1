OUSELEY.          FLOWERS FROM A PERSIAN GARDEN,    AND    OTHER PAPERS.      BY W. A. CLOUSTON,      AUTHOR OF 'POPULAR TALES AND FICTIONS' AND 'BOOK OF NOODLES'; EDITOR OF  'A GROUP OF EASTERN ROMANCES AND STORIES,' 'BOOK OF SINDIBAD,' 'BAKHTYAR  NAMA,' 'ARABIAN POETRY FOR ENGLISH READERS,' ETC.      LONDON:  DAVID NUTT, 270, 271, STRAND.  MDCCCXC.          TO E. SIDNEY HARTLAND, ESQ.,    FELLOW OF THE SOCIETY OF ANTIQUARIES; MEMBER OF THE COUNCIL OF THE  FOLK-LORE SOCIETY, ETC.      MY DEAR HARTLAND,    Though you are burdened with the duties of a profession far outside of  which lie those studies that have largely occupied my attention for many  years past, yet your own able contributions to the same, or cognate,  subjects of investigation evince the truth of the seemingly paradoxical  saying, that \"the busiest man finds the greatest amount of leisure.\" And  in dedicating this little book to you--would that it were more  worthy!--as a token of gratitude for the valuable help you have often  rendered me in the course of my studies, I am glad of the opportunity it  affords me for placing on record (so to say) the fact that I enjoy the  friendship of a man possessed of so many excellent qualities of heart as  well as of intellect.    The following collection of essays, or papers, is designed to suit the  tastes of a more numerous class of readers than were some of my former  books, which are not likely to be of special interest to many besides  students of comparative folk-lore--amongst whom your own degree is high.  The book, in fact, is intended mainly for those who are rather vaguely  termed \"general readers\"; albeit I venture to think that even the  folk-lore student may find in it somewhat to \"make a note of,\" as the  great Captain Cuttle was wont to say--in season and out of season.    Leaving the contents to speak for themselves, I shall only say farther  that my object has been to bring together, in a handy volume, a series  of essays which might prove acceptable to many readers, whether of grave  or lively temperament. What are called \"instructive\" books--meaning  thereby \"morally\" instructive--are generally as dull reading as is  proverbially a book containing nothing but jests--good, bad, and  indifferent. We can't (and we shouldn't) be always in the \"serious\"  mood, nor can we be for ever on the grin; and it seems to me that a  mental dietary, by turns, of what is wise and of what is witty should be  most wholesome. But, of the two, I confess I prefer to take the former,  even as one ought to take solid food, in great moderation; and, after  all, it is surely better to laugh than to mope or weep, in spite of what  has been said of \"the loud laugh that speaks the vacant mind.\" Most of  us, in this work-a-day world, find no small benefit from allowing our  minds to lie fallow at certain times, as farmers do with their fields.  In the following pages, however, I believe wisdom and wit, the didactic  and the diverting, will be found in tolerably fair proportions.    But I had forgot--I am not writing a Preface, and this is already too  long for a Dedication; so believe me, with all good wishes,    Yours ever faithfully,  W. A. CLOUSTON.

I    SKETCH OF THE LIFE OF THE PERSIAN POET SAADI--CHARACTER OF HIS  WRITINGS--THE \"GULISTAN\"--PREFACES TO BOOKS--PREFACE TO THE  \"GULISTAN\"--EASTERN POETS IN PRAISE OF SPRINGTIDE.      It is remarkable how very little the average general reader knows  regarding the great Persian poet Saadi and his writings. His name is  perhaps more or less familiar to casual readers from its being appended  to one or two of his aphorisms which are sometimes reproduced in odd  corners of popular periodicals; but who he was, when he lived, and what  he wrote, are questions which would probably puzzle not a few, even of  those who consider themselves as \"well read,\" to answer without first  recurring to some encyclopaedia. Yet Saadi was assuredly one of the most  gifted men of genius the world has ever known: a man of large and  comprehensive intellect; an original and profound thinker; an acute  observer of men and manners; and his works remain the imperishable  monument of his genius, learning, and industry.    Maslahu 'd-Din Shaykh Saadi was born, towards the close of the twelfth  century, at Shiraz, the famous capital of Fars, concerning which city  the Persians have the saying that \"if"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16955"],[0,"Three Translations of The Koran (Al-Qur'an) side (#1)"],[1,"text originates from a file whose origins we don't  know, found in many places on the Internet.

P: Master of the Day of Judgment,    S: Master of the Day of Judgment.    001.005  Y: Thee do we worship, and Thine aid we seek.    P: Thee (alone) we worship; Thee (alone) we ask for help.    S: Thee do we serve and Thee do we beseech for help.    001.006  Y: Show us the straight way,    P: Show us the straight path,    S: Keep us on the right path.    001.007  Y: The way of those on whom Thou hast bestowed Thy Grace, those whose  (portion) is not wrath, and who go not astray.    P: The path of those whom Thou hast favoured; Not the (path) of those  who earn Thine anger nor of those who go astray.    S: The path of those upon whom Thou hast bestowed favors. Not (the path)  of those upon whom Thy wrath is brought down, nor of those who go  astray.    ---------------------------------------------------------------------     Chapter 2:                                AL-BAQARA (THE COW)   Total Verses: 286 Revealed At: MADINA      ---------------------------------------------------------------------               In the name of Allah, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful.    002.001  Y: A.L.M.    P: Alif. Lam. Mim.    S: Alif Lam Mim.    002.002  Y: This is the Book; in it is guidance sure, without doubt, to those who  fear Allah;    P: This is the Scripture whereof there is no doubt, a guidance unto  those who ward off (evil).    S: This Book, there is no doubt in it, is a guide to those who guard  (against evil).    002.003  Y: Who believe in the Unseen, are steadfast in prayer, and spend out of  what We have provided for them;    P: Who believe in the Unseen, and establish worship, and spend of that  We have bestowed upon them;    S: Those who believe in the unseen and keep up prayer and spend out of  what We have given them.    002.004  Y: And who believe in the Revelation sent to thee, and sent before thy  time, and (in their hearts) have the assurance of the Hereafter.    P: And who believe in that which is revealed unto thee (Muhammad) and  that which was revealed before thee, and are certain of the Hereafter.    S: And who believe in that which has been revealed to you and that which  was revealed before you and they are sure of the hereafter.    002.005  Y: They are on (true) guidance, from their Lord, and it is these who  will prosper.    P: These depend on guidance from their Lord. These are the successful.    S: These are on a right course from their Lord and these it is that  shall be successful.    002.006  Y: As to those who reject Faith, it is the same to them whether thou  warn them or do not warn them; they will not believe.    P: As for the Disbelievers, Whether thou warn them or thou warn them not  it is all one for them; they believe not.    S: Surely those who disbelieve, it being alike to them whether you warn  them, or do not warn them, will not believe.    002.007  Y: Allah hath set a seal on their hearts and on their hearing, and on  their eyes is a veil; great is the penalty they (incur).    P: Allah hath sealed their hearing and their hearts, and on their eyes  there is a covering. Theirs will be an awful doom.    S: Allah has set a seal upon their hearts and upon their hearing and  there is a covering over their eyes, and there is a great punishment  for them.    002.008  Y: Of the people there are some who say: \"We believe in Allah and the  Last Day;\" but they do not (really) believe.    P: And of mankind are some who say: We believe in Allah and the Last  Day, when they believe not.    S: And there are some people who say: We believe in Allah and the last  day; and they are not at all believers.    002.009  Y: Fain would they deceive Allah and those who believe, but they only  deceive themselves, and realise (it) not!    P: They think to beguile Allah and those who believe, and they beguile  none save themselves; but they perceive not.    S: They desire to deceive Allah and those who believe, and they deceive  only themselves and they do not perceive.    002.010  Y: In their hearts is a disease; and Allah has increased their disease:  And grievous is the penalty they (incur), because they are false (to  themselves).    P: In their hearts is a disease, and Allah increaseth their disease. A  painful doom is theirs because they lie.    S: There is a disease in their hearts, so Allah added to their disease  and they shall have a painful chastisement because they lied.    002.011  Y: When it is said to them: \"Make not mischief on the earth,\" they say:  \"Why, we only Want to make peace!\"    P: And when it is said unto them: Make not mischief in the earth, they  say: We are peacemakers only.    S: And when it is said to them, Do not make mischief in the land, they  say: We are but peace-makers.    002.012  Y: Of a surety, they are the ones who make mischief, but they realise  (it) not.    P: Are not they indeed the mischief-makers? But they perceive not.    S: Now surely they themselves are the mischief makers, but they do not  perceive.    002.013  Y: When it is said to them: \"Believe as the others believe:\" They say:  \"Shall we believe as the fools believe?\" Nay, of a surety they are the  fools, but they do not know.    P: And when it is said unto them: believe as the people believe, they  say: shall we believe as the foolish believe? are not they indeed the  foolish? But they know not.    S: And when it is said to them: Believe as the people believe they say:  Shall we believe as the fools believe? Now surely they themselves are  the fools, but they do not know.    002.014  Y: When they meet those who believe, they say: \"We believe;\" but when  they are alone with their evil ones, they say: \"We are really with you:  We (were) only jesting.\"    P: And when they fall in with those who believe, they say: We believe;  but when they go apart to their devils they declare: Lo! we are with  you; verily we did but mock.    S: And when they meet those who believe, they say: We believe; and when  they are alone with their Shaitans, they say: Surely we are with you,  we were only mocking.    002.015  Y: Allah will throw back their mockery on them, and give them rope in  their trespasses; so they will wander like blind ones (To and fro).    P: Allah (Himself) doth mock them, leaving them to wander blindly on in  their contumacy.    S: Allah shall pay them back their mockery, and He leaves them alone in  their inordinacy, blindly wandering on.    002.016  Y: These are they who have bartered Guidance for error: But their  traffic is profitless, and they have lost true direction,    P: These are they who purchase error at the price of guidance, so their  commerce doth not prosper, neither are they guided.    S: These are they who buy error for the right direction, so their  bargain shall bring no gain, nor are they the followers of the right  direction.    002.017  Y: Their similitude is that of a man who kindled a fire; when it lighted  all around him, Allah took away their light and left them in utter  darkness. So they could not see.    P: Their likeness is as the likeness of one who kindleth fire, and when  it sheddeth its light around him Allah taketh away their light and  leaveth them in darkness, where they cannot see,    S: Their parable is like the parable of one who kindled a fire but when  it had illumined all around him, Allah took away their light, and left  them in utter darkness--they do not see.    002.018  Y: Deaf, dumb, and blind, they will not return (to the path).    P: Deaf, dumb and blind; and they return not.    S: Deaf, dumb (and) blind, so they will not turn back.    002.019  Y: Or (another similitude) is that of a rain-laden cloud from the sky:  In it are zones of darkness, and thunder and lightning: They press  their fingers in their ears to keep out the stunning thunder-clap, the  while they are in terror of death. But Allah is ever round the  rejecters of Faith!    P: Or like a rainstorm from the sky, wherein is darkness, thunder and  the flash of lightning. They thrust their fingers in their ears by  reason of the thunder-claps, for fear of death, Allah encompasseth the  disbelievers (in His guidance, His omniscience and His omnipotence).    S: Or like abundant rain from the cloud in which is utter darkness and  thunder and lightning; they put their fingers into their ears because  of the thunder peal, for fear of death, and Allah encompasses the  unbelievers.    002.020  Y: The lightning all but snatches away their sight; every time the light  (Helps) them, they walk therein, and when the darkness grows on them,  they stand still. And if Allah willed, He could take away their faculty  of hearing and seeing; for Allah hath power over all things.    P: The lightning almost snatcheth away their sight from them. As often  as it flasheth forth for them they walk therein, and when it darkeneth  against them they stand still. "]]]
