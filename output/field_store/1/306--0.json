STOKES COMPANY          FOREWORD      It has long been a cherished desire to prepare a series of Talks with  famous Singers, which should have an equal aim with Talks with Master  Pianists, namely, to obtain from the artists their personal ideas  concerning their art and its mastery, and, when possible, some inkling  as to the methods by which they themselves have arrived at the goal.    There have been unexpected and untold difficulties in the way of such an  undertaking. The greater the artist the more numerous the body-guard  which surrounds him--or her; the more stringent the watch over the  artist's time and movements. If one is able to penetrate this barrier  and is permitted to see the artist, one finds usually an affable  gentleman, a charming woman, with simple manners and kindly intentions.    However, when one is fortunate enough to come in touch with great  singers, one finds it difficult to draw from them a definite idea of the  process by which they have achieved victory. A pianist can describe his  manner of tone production, methods of touch, fingering, pedaling; the  violinist can discourse on the bow arm, use of left hand, on staccato  and pizzicati; but the singer is loath to describe his own instrument.  And even if singers could analyze, the description might not fit any  case but their own. For the art of singing is an individual art, the  perfecting an instrument hidden from sight. Each artist must achieve  mastery by overcoming difficulties which beset his own personal path.    Despite these obstacles, every effort has been put forth to induce  artists to speak from an educational standpoint. It is hoped the various  hints and precepts they have given, may prove of benefit to singers and  teachers. Limitations of space prevent the inclusion of many other  artists and teachers.

The very name itself calls up visions of the greatest  operatic tenor of the present generation, to those who have both heard  and seen him in some of his many roles. Or, to those who have only  listened to his records, again visions of the wonderful voice, with its  penetrating, vibrant, ringing quality, the impassioned delivery, which  stamps every note he sings with the hall mark of genius, the tremendous,  unforgettable climaxes. Not to have heard Caruso sing is to have missed  something out of life; not to have seen him act in some of his best  parts is to have missed the inspiration of great acting. As Mr. Huneker  once wrote: \"The artistic career of Caruso is as well known as that of  any great general or statesman; he is a national figure. He is a great  artist, and, what is rarer, a genuine man.\"    And how we have seen his art grow and ripen, since he first began to  sing for us. The date of his first appearance at the Metropolitan Opera  House, New York, was November 23rd, 1903. Then the voice was marvelous  in its freshness and beauty, but histrionic development lagged far  behind. The singer seemed unable to make us visualize the characters he  endeavored to portray. It was always Caruso who sang a certain part; we  could never forget that. But constant study and experience have  eliminated even this defect, so that to-day the singer and actor are  justly balanced; both are superlatively great. Can any one who hears and  sees Caruso in the role of Samson, listen unmoved to the throbbing wail  of that glorious voice and the unutterable woe of the blind man's  poignant impersonation?      IN EARLY DAYS    Enrico Caruso was born in Naples, the youngest of nineteen children. His  father was an engineer and the boy was taught the trade in his father's  shop, and was expected to follow in his father's footsteps. But destiny  decreed otherwise. As he himself said, to one listener:    \"I had always sung as far back as I can remember, for the pure love of  it. My voice was contralto, and I sang in a church in Naples from  fourteen till I was eighteen. Then I had to go into the army for awhile.  I had never learned how to sing, for I had never been taught. One day a  young officer of my company said to me: 'You will spoil your voice if  you keep on singing like that'--for I suppose I was fond of shouting in  those days. 'You should learn _how_ to sing,' he said to me; 'you must  study.' He introduced me to a young man who at once took an interest in  me and brought me to a singing master named Vergine. I sang for him, but  he was very discouraging. His verdict was it would be hopeless to try to  make a singer out of me. As it was, I might possibly earn a few lire a  night with my voice, but according to his idea I had far better stick to  my father's trade, in which I could at least earn forty cents a day.    \"But my young friend would not give up so easily. He begged Vergine to  hear me again. Things went a little better with me the second time and  Vergine consented to teach me.      RIGID DISCIPLINE    \"And now began a period of rigid discipline. In Vergine's idea I had  been singing too loud; I must reverse this and sing everything softly.  I felt as though in a strait-jacket; all my efforts at expression were  most carefully repressed; I was never allowed to let out my voice. At  last came a chance to try my wings in opera, at ten lire a night  ($2.00). In spite of the regime of repression to which I had been  subjected for the past three years, there were still a few traces of my  natural feeling left. The people were kind to me and I got a few  engagements. Vergine had so long trained me to sing softly, never  permitting me to sing out, that people began to call me the Broken  Tenor.      THE FIRST REAL CHANCE    \"A better chance came before long. In 1896 the Opera House in Salerno  decided to produce _I Puritani_. At the last moment the tenor they had  engaged to sing the leading role became ill, and there was no one to  sing the part. Lombardi, conductor of the orchestra, told the directors  there was a young singer in Naples, about eighteen miles away, who he  knew could help them out and sing the part. When they heard the name  Caruso, they laughed scornfully. 'What, the Broken Tenor?' they asked.  But Lombardi pressed my claim, assured them I could be engaged, and no  doubt would be glad to sing for nothing.    \"So I was sent for. Lombardi talked with me awhile first. He explained  by means of several illustrations, that I must not stand cold and stiff  in the middle of the stage, while I sang nice, sweet tones. No, I must  let out my voice, I must throw myself into the part, I must be alive to  it--must live it and in it. In short, I must act as well as sing.      A REVELATION    \"It was all like a revelation to me. I had never realized before how  absolutely necessary it was to act out the character I attempted. So I  sang _I Puritani_, with as much success as could have been expected of a  young singer with so little experience. Something awoke in me at that  moment. From that night I was never called a 'Broken Tenor' again. I  made a regular engagement at two thousand lire a month. Out of this I  paid regularly to Vergine the twenty-five per cent which he always  demanded. He was somewhat reconciled to me when he saw that I had a real  engagement and was making a substantial sum, though he still insisted  that I would lose my voice in a few years. But time passes and I am  still singing.

MILTON    OTTO K. WOHLERS    [Illustration: BRUCE MILWAUKEE (Publishers Stamp)]    THE BRUCE PUBLISHING COMPANY    MILWAUKEE, WISCONSIN    Copyright 1919    Archie S. Milton    Otto K. Wohlers          PREFACE      This book is the outgrowth of problems given to high school pupils by  the writers, and has been compiled in logical sequence. Stress is laid  upon the proper use of tools, and the problems are presented in such a  way that each exercise, or project, depends somewhat on the one  preceding. It is not the idea of the writers that all problems shown  should be made, but that the instructor select only such as will give  the pupils enough preliminary work in the use of the tools to prepare  them for other models following.    The related matter on the care of the lathe and tools, the grinding of  chisels, the polishing of projects, and the specific directions and  cautions for working out the various exercises and projects with the  drawings, make the book not only valuable for reference, but also as a  class text to be studied in connection with the making of projects. The  drawings show exact dimensions and are tabulated in the upper right-hand  corner in such a way that they may be used in a filing case if desired.  At least two designs are shown for each model, and these may be used as  suggestions from which students, with the aid of the instructor, may  work out their own designs.    The book has been divided into two parts: (A) Spindle Turning, and (B)  Face-Plate Turning. The same order is followed in each part; the related  information is supplied where required as the pupil progresses.    Part A takes up the following: (I) Exercises; (II) Models, involving the  same tool processes, only in a somewhat different degree; (III) Oval  Turning, explaining the use of two centers; (IV) Duplicate Turning,  where identical pieces are turned.    Part B is arranged as follows: (I) Exercises; (II) Models, which are an  application of cuts in exercises that involve only face-plate work;  (III) Models, which require chucking; (IV) Assembling Exercises,  involving spindle turning, face-plate work and chucking; (V) Spiral  Turning, showing the method of turning a spiral on the lathe.    The ultimate aim of this book is to give, through the exercises and  problems, a thorough understanding of the principles of wood turning by  gradually developing the confidence of the pupil in the complete control  of his tools, at the same time suggesting harmonious lines in design  which will lead to other ideas in designing problems.
