CHAPTER I.    _Passage from Ulietea to the Friendly Isles, with a Description of  several Islands that were discovered, and the Incidents which happened in  that Track._    1774 June    On the 6th, being the day after leaving Ulietea, at eleven o'clock a.m., we  saw land bearing N.W., which, upon a nearer approach, we found to be a low  reef island about four leagues in compass, and of a circular form. It is  composed of several small patches connected together by breakers, the  largest lying on the N.E. part. This is Howe Island, discovered by Captain  Wallis, who, I think, sent his boat to examine it; and, if I have not been  misinformed, found a channel through, within the reef, near the N.W. part.  The inhabitants of Ulietea speak of an uninhabited island about this  situation, called by them Mopeha, to which they go at certain seasons for  turtle. Perhaps, this may be the same; as we saw no signs of inhabitants  upon it. Its latitude is 16 deg. 46' S. longitude 154 deg. 8' W.    From this day to the 16th, we met nothing remarkable, and our course was  west southerly; the winds variable from north round by the east to S.W.,  attended with cloudy, rainy, unsettled weather, and a southerly swell. We  generally brought-to, or stood upon a wind during night; and in the day  made all the sail we could. About half an hour after sun-rise this morning,  land was seen from the top-mast head, bearing N.N.E. We immediately altered  the course, and steering for it, found it to be another reef island,  composed of five or six woody islets, connected together by sand-banks and  breakers inclosing a lake, into which we could see no entrance. We ranged  the west and N.W. coasts, from its southern to its northern-extremity,  which is about two leagues, and so near the shore, that at one time we  could see the rocks under us; yet we found no anchorage, nor saw we any  signs of inhabitants. There were plenty of various kinds of birds, and the  coast seemed to abound with fish. The situation of this isle is not very  distant from that assigned by Mr Dalrymple for La Sagitaria, discovered by  Quiros; but, by the description the discoverer has given of it, it cannot  be the same. For this reason, I looked upon it as a new discovery, and  named it Palmerston Island, in honour of Lord Palmerston, one of the lords  of the Admiralty. It is situated in latitude 18 deg. 4' S. longitude 163 deg. 10'  W.    At four o'clock in the afternoon, we left this isle, and resumed our course  to the W. by S. with a fine steady gale easterly, till noon on the 20th, at  which time, being in latitude 18 deg. 50', longitude 168 deg. 52, we thought we saw  land to S.S.W. and hauled up for it accordingly. But two hours after, we  discovered our mistake, and resumed our course W. by S. Soon after, we saw  land from the mast-head in the same direction; and, as we drew nearer,  found it to be an island, which, at five o'clock, bore west, distant five  leagues. Here we spent the night plying under the topsails; and at day-break  next morning, bore away, steering to the northern point, and ranging  the west coast at the distance of one mile, till near noon. Then perceiving  some people on the shore, and landing seeming to be easy, we brought-to,  and hoisted out two boats, with which I put off to the land, accompanied by  some of the officers and gentlemen. As we drew near the shore, some of the  inhabitants, who were on the rocks, retired to the woods, to meet us, as we  supposed; and we afterwards found our conjectures right. We landed with  ease in a small creek, and took post on a high rock to prevent a surprise.  Here we displayed our colours, and Mr Forster and his party began to  collect plants, etc. The coast was so over-run with woods, bushes, plants,  stones, etc. that we could not see forty yards round us. I took two men, and  with them entered a kind of chasm, which opened a way into the woods. We  had not gone far before we heard the natives approaching; upon which I  called to Mr Forster to retire to the party, as I did likewise. We had no  sooner joined than the islanders appeared at the entrance of a chasm not a  stone's throw from us. We began to speak, and make all the friendly signs  we could think of, to them, which they answered by menaces; and one of two  men, who were advanced before the rest, threw a stone, which struck Mr  Sparrman on the arm. Upon this two muskets were fired, without order, which  made them all retire under cover of the woods; and we saw them no more.

INTRODUCTION    SHOWING THAT THE PRESENT-DAY SOCIAL ORGANIZATION OF THE HOPI IS THE  OUTGROWTH OF THEIR UNWRITTEN LITERATURE           *       *       *       *       *    GENERAL STATEMENT    By a brief survey of present day Hopi culture and an examination into  the myths and traditions constituting the unwritten literature of this  people, this bulletin proposes to show that an intimate connection  exists between their ritual acts, their moral standards, their social  organization, even their practical activities of today, and their myths  and tales--the still unwritten legendary lore.    The myths and legends of primitive peoples have always interested the  painter, the poet, the thinker; and we are coming to realize more and  more that they constitute a treasure-trove for the archaeologist, and  especially the anthropologist, for these sources tell us of the  struggles, the triumphs, the wanderings of a people, of their  aspirations, their ideals and beliefs; in short, they give us a twilight  history of the race.    As the geologist traces in the rocks the clear record of the early  beginnings of life on our planet, those first steps that have led  through the succession of ever-developing forms of animal and plant life  at last culminating in man and the world as we now see them, so does the  anthropologist discover in the myths and legends of a people the dim  traces of their origin and development till these come out in the  stronger light of historical time. And it is at this point that the  ethnologist, trying to understand a race as he finds them today, must  look earnestly back into the \"realm of beginnings,\" through this window  of so-called legendary lore, in order to account for much that he finds  in the culture of the present day.      =The Challenge: Need of Research on Basic Beliefs Underlying Ceremonies=    Wissler says:[2] \"It is still an open question in primitive social  psychology whether we are justified in assuming that beliefs of a basic  character do motivate ceremonies. It seems to us that such must be the  case, because we recognize a close similarity in numerous practices and  because we are accustomed to believe in the unity of the world and life.  So it may still be our safest procedure to secure better records of  tribal traditional beliefs and to deal with objective procedures as far  as possible. No one has ventured to correlate specific beliefs and  ceremonial procedures, but it is through this approach that the  motivating power of beliefs will be revealed, if such potency exists.\"    [Footnote 2: Wissler, Clark, An Introduction to Social Anthropology:  Henry Holt & Co., New York, 1926, p. 266.]    Some work has been done along this line by Kroeber for the tribes of  California, Lowie for the Crow Indians, and Junod for the Ekoi of West  Africa; but it appears that the anthropological problem of basic beliefs  and philosophies is dependent upon specific tribal studies and that more  research is called for.      =The Myth, Its Meaning and Function in Primitive Life=    As a background for our discussion we shall need to consider first, the  nature and significance of mythology, since there is some, indeed much,  difference of opinion on the subject, and to arrive at some basis of  understanding as to its function.    The so-called school of Nature-Mythology, which flourishes mainly in  Germany, maintains that primitive man is highly interested in natural  phenomena, and that this interest is essentially of a theoretic,  contemplative and poetical character. To writers of this school every  myth has as its kernel or essence some natural phenomenon or other, even  though such idea is not apparent upon the surface of the story; a deeper  meaning, a symbolic reference, being insisted upon. Such famous scholars  as Ehrenreich, Siecke, Winckler, Max Muller, and Kuhn have long given us  this interpretation of myth.    In strong contrast to this theory which regards myth as naturalistic,  symbolic, and imaginary, we have the theory which holds a sacred tale as  a true historical record of the past. This idea is supported by the  so-called Historical school in Germany and America, and represented in  England by Dr. Rivers. We must admit that both history and natural  environment have left a profound imprint on all cultural achievement,  including mythology, but we are not justified in regarding all mythology  as historical chronicle, nor yet as the poetical musings of primitive  naturalists. The primitive does indeed put something of historical  record and something of his best interpretation of mysterious natural  phenomena into his legendary lore, but there is something else, we are  led to believe, that takes precedence over all other considerations in  the mind of the primitive (as well as in the minds of all of the rest of  us) and that is getting on in the world, a pragmatic outlook.    It is evident that the primitive relies upon his ancient lore to help  him out in his struggle with his environment, in his needs spiritual and  his needs physical, and this immense service comes through religious  ritual, moral incentive, and sociological pattern, as laid down in the  cherished magical and legendary lore of his tribe.    The close connection between religion and mythology, under-estimated by  many, has been fully appreciated by the great British anthropologist,  Sir James Frazer, and by classical scholars like Miss Jane Harrison.  The myth is the Bible of the primitive, and just as our Sacred Story  lives in our ritual and in our morality, as it governs our faith and  controls our conduct, even so does the savage live by his mythology.    The myth, as it actually exists in a primitive community, even today, is  not of the nature of fiction such as our novel, but is a living reality,  believed to have once happened in primeval times when the world was  young and continuing ever since to influence the world and human  destiny.    The mere fireside tale of the primitive may be a narrative, true or  imaginary, or a sort of fairy story, a fable or a parable, intended  mainly for the edification of the young and obviously pointing a moral  or emphasizing some useful truth or precept. And here we do recognize  symbolism, much in the nature of historical record. But the special  class of stories regarded by the primitive as sacred, his sacred myths,  are embodied in ritual, morals, and social organization, and form an  integral and active part of primitive culture. These relate back to best  known precedent, to primeval reality, by which pattern the affairs of  men have ever since been guided, and which constitute the only \"safe  path.\"    Malinowski[3] stoutly maintains that these stories concerning the  origins of rites and customs are not told in mere explanation of them;  in fact, he insists they are not intended as explanations at all, but  that the myth states a precedent which constitutes an _ideal_ and a  warrant for its continuance, and sometimes furnishes practical  directions for the procedure. He feels that those who consider the myths  of the savage as mere crude stories made up to explain natural  phenomena, or as historical records true or untrue, have made a mistake  in taking these myths out of their life-context and studying them from  what they look like on paper, and not from what they do in life.    [Footnote 3: Malinowski, B., Myth in Primitive Psychology: M.W. Norton &  Co., Inc., New York, 1926, p. 19.]    Since Malinowski's definition of myth differs radically from that of  many other writers on the subject, we would refer the reader to the  discussion of myth under the head of Social Anthropology in the  Encyclopedia Britannica, Fourteenth Edition, page 869.
