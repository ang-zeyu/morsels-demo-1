No science has ever equaled astronomy in its appeal to the       imagination, and recently popular interest in the wonders of the       starry heavens has been stimulated by surprising discoveries and       imaginary discoveries, as well as by a marked tendency of writers       of fiction to include other worlds and their possible inhabitants       within the field of romance.         Mr. Serviss's new book on \"Other Worlds, their Nature and       Possibilities in the Light of the Latest Discoveries,\" summarizes       what is known. With helpful illustrations, the most interesting       facts about the planets Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, etc., as well       as about the nearest of all other worlds, the moon, are presented       in a popular manner, and always from the point of view of human       interest--a point that is too seldom taken by writers on science.

THOMAS CHALMERS.          New York  D. Appleton and Company  1901  Copyright, 1901,  by D. Appleton and Company.          TO THE MEMORY OF WILLIAM JAY YOUMANS.          PREFACE      The point of view of this book is human interest in the other worlds  around us. It presents the latest discoveries among the planets of the  solar system, and shows their bearing upon the question of life in those  planets. It points out the resemblances and the differences between the  earth and the other worlds that share with it in the light of the sun.  It shows what we should see and experience if we could visit those  worlds.    While basing itself upon facts, it does not exclude the discussion of  interesting probabilities and theories that have commanded wide popular  attention. It points out, for instance, what is to be thought of the  idea of interplanetary communication. It indicates what must be the  outlook of the possible inhabitants of some of the other planets toward  the earth. As far as may be, it traces the origin and development of the  other worlds of our system, and presents a graphic picture of their  present condition as individuals, and of their wonderful contrasts as  members of a common family.    In short, the aim of the author has been to show how wide, and how rich,  is the field of interest opened to the human mind by man's discoveries  concerning worlds, which, though inaccessible to him in a physical  sense, offer intellectual conquests of the noblest description.    And, finally, in order to assist those who may wish to recognize for  themselves these other worlds in the sky, this book presents a special  series of charts to illustrate a method of finding the planets which  requires no observatory and no instruments, and only such knowledge of  the starry heavens as anybody can easily acquire.

Ill temper in a child is, alas! too often  mistaken for an indication of genius; and impudence is sometimes  regarded as a sign of precocity. The author, however, has honestly  striven to avoid this common prejudice. This book, the child of his  brain, and experience, extending over a long period of time and varying  environment, he frankly admits is not without its faults--is far from  perfect; but he is satisfied that, notwithstanding its apparent  shortcomings, it will serve in a humble way some useful purpose.    The recipes given in the following pages represent the labor of years.  Their worth has been demonstrated, not experimentally, but by actual  tests, day by day and month by month, under dissimilar, and, in many  instances, not too favorable conditions.    One of the pleasures in life to the normal man is good eating, and if it  be true that real happiness consists in making others happy, the author  can at least feel a sense of gratification in the thought that his  attempts to satisfy the cravings of the inner man have not been wholly  unappreciated by the many that he has had the pleasure of serving--some  of whom are now his stanchest friends. In fact, it was in response to  the insistence and encouragement of these friends that he embarked in  the rather hazardous undertaking of offering this collection to a  discriminating public.    To snatch from his daily toil a few moments, here and there, in order to  arrange with some degree of symmetry, not the delicacies that would  awaken the jaded appetite of the gourmet, but to prepare an ensemble  that might, with equal grace, adorn the home table or banquet board, has  proven a task of no mean proportions. Encouraged by his friends,  however, he persevered and this volume is the results of his effort.    If, when gathered around the festal board, in camp or by fireside, on  train or ship, \"trying out\" the recipes, his friends will pause,  retrospectively, and with kindly feelings think from whence some of the  good things emanated, the author will feel amply compensated for the  care, the thought, the labor he has expended in the preparation of the  book; and to those friends, individually and collectively, it is  therefore dedicated.          SKETCH OF MY LIFE      I was born in Murray County, Tennessee, in 1857, a slave. I was given  the name of my master, D. J. Estes, who owned my mother's family,  consisting of seven boys and two girls, I being the youngest of the  family.    After the war broke out all the male slaves in the neighborhood for  miles around ran off and joined the \"Yankees.\" This left us little folks  to bear the burdens. At the age of five I had to carry water from the  spring about a quarter of a mile from the house, drive the cows to and  from the pastures, mind the calves, gather chips, etc.    In 1867 my mother moved to Nashville, Tennessee, my grandmother's home,  where I attended one term of school. Two of my brothers were lost in the  war, a fact that wrecked my mother's health somewhat and I thought I  could be of better service to her and prolong her life by getting work.  When summer came I got work milking cows for some neighbors, for which I  got two dollars a month. I also carried hot dinners for the laborers in  the fields, for which each one paid me twenty-five cents per month. All  of this, of course, went to my mother. I worked at different places  until I was sixteen years old, but long before that time I was taking  care of my mother.    At the age of sixteen I was employed in Nashville by a restaurant-keeper  named Hemphill. I worked there until I was twenty-one years of age. In  1881 I came to Chicago and got a position at 77 Clark Street, where I  remained for two years at a salary of ten dollars a week.    In 1883 I entered the Pullman service, my first superintendent being J.  P. Mehen. I remained in their service until 1897. During the time I was  in their service some of the most prominent people in the world traveled  in the car assigned to me, as I was selected to handle all special  parties. Among the distinguished people who traveled in my care were  Stanley, the African explorer; President Cleveland; President Harrison;  Adelina Patti, the noted singer of the world at that time; Booth and  Barrett; Modjeski and Paderewski. I also had charge of the car for  Princess Eulalie of Spain, when she was the guest of Chicago during the  World's Fair.    In 1894 I set sail from Vancouver on the Empress of China with Mr. and  Mrs. Nathan A. Baldwin for Japan, visiting the Cherry Blossom Festival  at Tokio.    In 1897 Mr. Arthur Stillwell, at that time president of the Kansas City,  Pittsburg & Gould Railroad, gave me charge of his magnificent $20,000  private car. I remained with him seventeen months when the road went  into the hands of receivers, and the car was sold to John W. Gates  syndicate. However, I had charge of the car under the new management  until 1907, since which time I have been employed as chef of the  subsidiary companies of the United States Steel Corporation in Chicago.          HINTS TO KITCHEN MAIDS      It is always necessary to keep your kitchen in the best condition.    ~Breakfast~--If a percolator is used it should first be put into  operation. If the breakfast consists of grapefruit, cereals, etc., your  cereal should be the next article prepared. If there is no diningroom  maid, you can then put your diningroom in order. If hot bread is to be  served (including cakes) that is the next thing to be prepared. Your gas  range is of course lighted, and your oven heated. Perhaps you have for  breakfast poached eggs on toast, Deerfoot sausage or boiled ham. One of  the above, with your other dishes, is enough for a person employed  indoors.    When your breakfast gong is sounded put your biscuits, eggs, bread,  etc., in the oven so that they may be ready to serve when the family  have eaten their grapefruit and cereal.    ~Luncheon~--This is the easiest meal of the three to prepare.  Yesterday's dinner perhaps consisted of roast turkey, beef or lamb, and  there is some meat left over; then pick out one of my receipts calling  for minced or creamed meats; baked or stuffed potatoes are always nice,  or there may be cold potatoes left over that can be mashed, made into  cakes and fried.    ~Dinner~--For a roast beef dinner serve vegetable soup as the first  course, with a relish of vegetables in season and horseradish or  chow-chow pickle, unless you serve salad.    If quail or ducks are to be served for dinner, an old Indian dish, wild  rice, is very desirable. Prepare this rice as follows:    Place in a double boiler a cupful of milk or cream to each cupful of  rice and add salt and pepper to taste. It requires a little longer to  cook than the ordinary rice, but must not be stirred. If it becomes dry  add a little milk from time to time.    Do not serve dishes at the same meal that conflict. For instance, if you  have sliced tomatoes, do not serve tomato soup. If, however, you have  potato soup, it would not be out of place to serve potatoes with your  dinner.    Fish should never be served without a salad of some kind.    The above are merely suggestions that have been of material assistance  to me.            TABLE OF WEIGHTS AND MEASURES      Four teaspoonfuls of a liquid equal 1 tablespoonful.    Four tablespoonfuls of a liquid equal 1/2 gill or 1/4 cup.    One-half cup equals 1 gill.    Two gills equal 1 cup.    Two cups equal 1 pint.    Two pints (4 cups) equal 1 quart.    Four cups of flour equal 1 pound or 1 quart.    Two cups of butter, solid, equal 1 pound.    One half cup of butter, solid, equals 1/4 pound 4 ounces.    Two cups of granulated sugar equal 1 pound.    Two and one half cups of powdered sugar equal 1 pound.    One pint of milk or water equals 1 pound.    One pint of chopped meat equals 1 pound.    Ten eggs, shelled, equal 1 pound.    Eight eggs with shells equal 1 pound.    Two tablespoonfuls of butter equal 1 ounce.    Two tablespoonfuls of granulated sugar equal 1 ounce.    Four tablespoonfuls of flour equal 1 ounce.    Four tablespoonfuls of coffee equal 1 ounce.    One tablespoonful of liquid equals 1/2 ounce.    Four tablespoonfuls of butter equal 2 ounces or 1/4 cup.    All measurements are level unless otherwise stated in the recipe.          GOOD THINGS TO EAT    SOUPS      ~ASPARAGUS SOUP~--Take three pounds of knuckle of veal and put it to  boil in a gallon of water with a couple of bunches of asparagus, boil  for three hours, strain, and return the juice to the pot. Add another  bunch of asparagus, chopped fine, and boil for twenty minutes, mix a  tablespoonful of flour in a cup of milk and add to the soup. Season with  salt and pepper, let it come to a boil, and serve at once.      ~BEAN SOUP~--One-half pound or one cup is sufficient for one quart of  soup. Soups can be made which use milk or cream as basis. Any kind of  green vegetable can be used with them, as creamed celery or creamed  cauliflower. The vegetable is cooked and"]]]
