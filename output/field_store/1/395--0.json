Yet neither his apish demeanour nor the deafening noises that responded  to every movement of his agile body detracted attention from the figure  of Reginald Clarke and the young man at his side as they smilingly wound  their way to the exit.    The boy's expression was pleasant, with an inkling of wistfulness, while  the soft glimmer of his lucid eyes betrayed the poet and the dreamer.  The smile of Reginald Clarke was the smile of a conqueror. A suspicion  of silver in his crown of dark hair only added dignity to his bearing,  while the infinitely ramified lines above the heavy-set mouth spoke at  once of subtlety and of strength. Without stretch of the imagination one  might have likened him to a Roman cardinal of the days of the Borgias,  who had miraculously stepped forth from the time-stained canvas and  slipped into twentieth century evening-clothes.    With the affability of complete self-possession he nodded in response to  greetings from all sides, inclining his head with special politeness to  a young woman whose sea-blue eyes were riveted upon his features with a  look of mingled hate and admiration.    The woman, disregarding his silent salutation, continued to stare at him  wild-eyed, as a damned soul in purgatory might look at Satan passing in  regal splendour through the seventy times sevenfold circles of hell.    Reginald Clarke walked on unconcernedly through the rows of gay diners,  still smiling, affable, calm. But his companion bethought himself of  certain rumours he had heard concerning Ethel Brandenbourg's mad love  for the man from whose features she could not even now turn her eyes.  Evidently her passion was unreciprocated. It had not always been so.  There was a time in her career, some years ago in Paris, when it was  whispered that she had secretly married him and, not much later,  obtained a divorce. The matter was never cleared up, as both preserved  an uncompromising silence upon the subject of their matrimonial  experience. Certain it was that, for a space, the genius of Reginald  Clarke had completely dominated her brush, and that, ever since he had  thrown her aside, her pictures were but plagiarisms of her former  artistic self.    The cause of the rupture between them was a matter only of surmise; but  the effect it had on the woman testified clearly to the remarkable power  of Reginald Clarke. He had entered her life and, behold! the world was  transfixed on her canvases in myriad hues of transcending radiance; he  had passed from it, and with him vanished the brilliancy of her  colouring, as at sunset the borrowed amber and gold fade from the face  of the clouds.    The glamour of Clarke's name may have partly explained the secret of his  charm, but, even in circles where literary fame is no passport, he  could, if he chose, exercise an almost terrible fascination. Subtle and  profound, he had ransacked the coffers of mediaeval dialecticians and  plundered the arsenals of the Sophists. Many years later, when the  vultures of misfortune had swooped down upon him, and his name was no  longer mentioned without a sneer, he was still remembered in New York  drawing-rooms as the man who had brought to perfection the art of  talking. Even to dine with him was a liberal education.    Clarke's marvellous conversational power was equalled only by his  marvellous style. Ernest Fielding's heart leaped in him at the thought  that henceforth he would be privileged to live under one roof with the  only writer of his generation who could lend to the English language the  rich strength and rugged music of the Elizabethans.    Reginald Clarke was a master of many instruments. Milton's mighty organ  was no less obedient to his touch than the little lute of the  troubadour. He was never the same; that was his strength. Clarke's  style possessed at once the chiselled chasteness of a Greek marble  column and the elaborate deviltry of the late Renaissance. At times his  winged words seemed to flutter down the page frantically like Baroque  angels; at other times nothing could have more adequately described his  manner than the timeless calm of the gaunt pyramids.    The two men had reached the street. Reginald wrapped his long spring  coat round him.    \"I shall expect you to-morrow at four,\" he said.    The tone of his voice was deep and melodious, suggesting hidden depths  and cadences.    \"I shall be punctual.\"    The younger man's voice trembled as he spoke.    \"I look forward to your coming with much pleasure. I am interested in  you.\"    The glad blood mounted to Ernest's cheeks at praise from the austere  lips of this arbiter of literary elegance.    An almost imperceptible smile crept over the other man's features.    \"I am proud that my work interests you,\" was all the boy could say.    \"I think it is quite amazing, but at present,\" here Clarke drew out a  watch set with jewels, \"I am afraid I must bid you good-bye.\"    He held Ernest's hand for a moment in a firm genial grasp, then turned  away briskly, while the boy remained standing open-mouthed. The crowd  jostling against him carried him almost off his feet, but his eyes  followed far into the night the masterful figure of Reginald Clarke,  toward whom he felt himself drawn with every fiber of his body and the  warm enthusiasm of his generous youth.          II      With elastic step, inhaling the night-air with voluptuous delight,  Reginald Clarke made his way down Broadway, lying stretched out before  him, bathed in light and pulsating with life.    His world-embracing intellect was powerfully attracted by the Giant  City's motley activities. On the street, as in the salon, his magnetic  power compelled recognition, and he stepped through the midst of the  crowd as a Circassian blade cleaves water.    After walking a block or two, he suddenly halted before a jeweller's  shop. Arrayed in the window were priceless gems that shone in the glare  of electricity, like mystical serpent-eyes--green, pomegranate and  water-blue. And as he stood there the dazzling radiance before him was  transformed in the prism of his mind into something great and very  wonderful that might, some day, be a poem.    Then his attention was diverted by a small group of tiny girls dancing  on the sidewalk to the husky strains of an old hurdy-gurdy. He joined  the circle of amused spectators, to watch those pink-ribboned bits of  femininity swaying airily to and fro in unison with the tune. One  especially attracted his notice--a slim olive-coloured girl from a land  where it is always spring. Her whole being translated into music, with  hair dishevelled and feet hardly touching the ground, the girl suggested  an orange-leaf dancing on a sunbeam. The rasping street-organ,  perchance, brought to her melodious reminiscences of some flute-playing  Savoyard boy, brown-limbed and dark of hair.    For several minutes Reginald Clarke followed with keen delight each  delicate curve her graceful limbs described. Then--was it that she grew  tired, or that the stranger's persistent scrutiny embarrassed her?--the  music oozed out of her movements. They grew slower, angular, almost  clumsy. The look of interest in Clarke's eyes died, but his whole form  quivered, as if the rhythm of the music and the dance had mysteriously  entered into his blood.    He continued his stroll, seemingly without aim; in reality he followed,  with nervous intensity, the multiform undulations of the populace,  swarming through Broadway in either direction. Like the giant whose  strength was rekindled every time he touched his mother, the earth,  Reginald Clarke seemed to draw fresh vitality from every contact with  life.    He turned east along Fourteenth street, where cheap vaudevilles are  strung together as glass-pearls on the throat of a wanton. Gaudy  bill-boards, drenched in clamorous red, proclaimed the tawdry  attractions within. Much to the surprise of the doorkeeper at a  particularly evil-looking music hall, Reginald Clarke lingered in the  lobby, and finally even bought a ticket that entitled him to enter this  sordid wilderness of decollete art. Street-snipes, a few workingmen,  dilapidated sportsmen, and women whose ruined youth thick layers of  powder and paint, even in this artificial light, could not restore,  constituted the bulk of the audience. Reginald Clarke, apparently  unconscious of the curiosity, surprise and envy that his appearance  excited, seated himself at a table near the stage, ordering from the  solicitous waiter only a cocktail and a programme. The drink he left  untouched, while his eyes greedily ran down the lines of the  announcement. When he had found what he sought, he lit a cigar, paying  no attention to the boards, but studying the audience with cursory  interest until the appearance of Betsy, the Hyacinth Girl.    When she began to sing, his mind still wandered. The words of her song  were crude, but not without a certain lilt that delighted the uncultured  ear, while the girl's voice was thin to the point of being unpleasant.  When, however, she came to the burden of the song, Clarke's manner  changed suddenly. Laying down his cigar, he listened with rapt  attention, eagerly gazing at her. For, as she sang the last line and  tore the hyacinth-blossoms from her hair, there crept into her voice a  strangely poignant, pathetic little "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17149"],[0,"Creative Chemistry: Descriptive of Recent Achievements in the Chemical (#1)"],[1,"(https://www.pgdp.net/)        Note: Project Gutenberg also has an HTML version of this        file which includes the original illustrations.

Some of the most picturesque features of this awakening reached  the great public through the press. Thus, the adventurous trips of the  _Deutschland_ with its cargoes of concentrated aniline dyes, valued at  millions of dollars, emphasized as no other incident our former  dependence upon Germany for these products of her chemical industries.    The public read, too, that her chemists saved Germany from an early  disastrous defeat, both in the field of military operations and in the  matter of economic supplies: unquestionably, without the tremendous  expansion of her plants for the production of nitrates and ammonia from  the air by the processes of Haber, Ostwald and others of her great  chemists, the war would have ended in 1915, or early in 1916, from  exhaustion of Germany's supplies of nitrate explosives, if not indeed  from exhaustion of her food supplies as a consequence of the lack of  nitrate and ammonia fertilizer for her fields. Inventions of substitutes  for cotton, copper, rubber, wool and many other basic needs have been  reported.    These feats of chemistry, performed under the stress of dire necessity,  have, no doubt, excited the wonder and interest of our public. It is far  more important at this time, however, when both for war and for peace  needs, the resources of our country are strained to the utmost, that the  public should awaken to a clear realization of what this science of  chemistry really means for mankind, to the realization that its wizardry  permeates the whole life of the nation as a"]]]
