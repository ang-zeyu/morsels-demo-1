A TEXT-BOOK OF ASSAYING:  FOR THE USE OF THOSE CONNECTED WITH MINES.    by    C. AND J. J. BERINGER.    Revised by    J. J. BERINGER,    Assoc. of the Royal School of Mines; Fellow of the Chemical Society and  of the Inst. of Chemistry; Principal of the Camborne Mining School; and  Late Public Analyst for the County of Cornwall.    With numerous Diagrams and Tables.    Ninth Edition.                London:  Charles Griffin and Company, Limited,  Exeter Street, Strand.  1904.  [All rights reserved.]          PUBLISHER'S NOTE TO THE NINTH EDITION      The continued popularity of the present work, the last edition of which  was published only a little over a year ago, continues to be a source of  gratification to the publishers, who have much pleasure in issuing the  present edition.    _January 1904._      PREFACE TO THE SIXTH EDITION    The principal changes in this edition are additions to the articles on  Gold, Cyanides, and Nickel, and a much enlarged Index. The additional  matter covers more than forty pages.    J. J. BERINGER.    CAMBORNE,  _January 1900._          PREFACE.      The Text-book now offered to the public has been prepared to meet the  existing want of a practical \"handy book\" for the Assayer.    To mining men the word \"assaying\" conveys a sufficiently clear meaning,  but it is difficult to define. Some writers limit it to the  determination of silver and gold, and others imagine that it has only to  do with \"furnace-work.\" These limitations are not recognised in  practice. In fact, assaying is becoming wider in its scope, and the  distinction between \"assayers\" and \"analysts\" will in time be difficult  to detect. We have endeavoured rather to give what will be of use to the  assayer than to cover the ground within the limits of a faulty  definition.    At first our intention was to supply a description of those substances  only which have a commercial value, but on consideration we have added  short accounts of the rarer elements, since they are frequently met  with, and occasionally affect the accuracy of an assay.    Under the more important methods we have given the results of a series  of experiments showing the effect of varying conditions on the accuracy  of the process. Such experiments are often made by assayers, but seldom  recorded. Statements like those generally made--that \"this or that  substance interferes\"--are insufficient. It is necessary to know under  what conditions and to what extent.    Students learning any particular process cannot do better than repeat  such a series of experiments. By this means they will, at the same time,  acquire the skill necessary for performing an assay and a confidence in  their results based upon work under different conditions.    The electrolytic method of copper assaying given under _Copper_ is a  modification of Luckow's; it was introduced by us into the offices of  the Rio Tinto Copper Company, and has been in use for many years with  success. This modification is now employed in copper-works in Spain,  Germany, and England, and is used in place of the dry assay for the  commercial valuation of copper ores.    We have adhered to the gram and the \"c.c.\" as the units of weight and  volume. Those who prefer working with grains and grain-measures can use  the figures given, multiplied by ten. For example:--When 1 gram is  mentioned, 10 grains should be used, and 10 grain-measures take the  place of 1 \"c.c.\" It is not advisable to mix the two systems, as by  using gram weights and grain-measures.    We have intentionally to a large extent omitted to mention the names of  those who have originated or modified the various processes. The  practice of naming a process after its discoverer has developed of late  years, and is becoming objectionable. It is a graceful thing to name a  gas-burner after Bunsen, or a condenser after Liebig; but when the  practice has developed so far that one is directed to \"Finkenerise\" a  residue, or to use the \"Reichert-Meissl-Wollny\" process, it is time to  stop.    We are indebted to the standard works of Allen, Crookes, Fresenius,  Lunge, Michell, Percy, and Sutton, and wish to express our sense of  special indebtedness to Mr. Richard Smith, of the Royal School of Mines.  One or two of the illustrations are taken from Mr. Sexton's excellent  little book on _Qualitative Analysis_. Our obligation to some others is  mentioned in the text.    Finally, we have to thank for assistance in the experimental work  Messrs. Bailey, Beswick, Clarke, Grant, Higgins, and Smith.    THE AUTHORS.    CAMBORNE, _Nov. 1889_.          CONTENTS.

Perry, Perrysburg, Ohio, and made available through the Christian  Classics Ethereal Library <http://www.ccel.org>. I have eliminated  unnecessary formatting in the text, corrected some errors in  transcription, and added the dedication, tables of contents,  Prologue, and the numbers of the questions and articles, as they  appeared in the printed translation published by Benziger Brothers.  Each article is now designated by part, question number, and article  number in brackets, like this:    > SECOND ARTICLE [I, Q. 49, Art. 2]    > Whether the Supreme Good, God, Is the Cause of Evil?    In a few places, where obvious errors appeared in the Benziger  Brothers edition, I have corrected them by reference to a Latin text  of the _Summa._ These corrections are indicated by English text in  brackets. For example, in Part I, Question 45, Article 2, the first  sentence in the Benziger Brothers edition begins: \"Not only is it  impossible that anything should be created by God....\" By reference  to the Latin, \"non solum _non_ est impossibile a Deo aliquid creari\"  (emphasis added), this has been corrected to \"Not only is it [not]  impossible that anything should be created by God....\"    This electronic edition also differs from the Benziger Brothers  edition in the following details (as well as the obvious lack of the  original page numbers and headers):    * The repetitive expression \"We proceed thus to the [next] Article\"  does not appear directly below the title of each article.    * Italics are represented by underscores at the beginning and end,  _like this._ Quotations and other \"quotable\" matter, however, are  ordinarily set off by quotation marks with no underscores in this  edition, in accordance with common English usage, even where they  were set in italics with no quotation marks in the Benziger Brothers  edition. Titles of books are set off by underscores when they appear  in the text with no parentheses, but not when the books are cited in  parentheses.    * Bible chapters and verses are cited with arabic numerals separated  by colons, like this: \"Dan. 7:10\"--not like this: \"Dan. vii. 10.\"  Small roman numerals have been retained where they appear in  citations to books other than the Bible.    * Any matter that appeared in a footnote in the Benziger Brothers  edition is presented in brackets at the point in the text where the  footnote mark appeared.    * Greek words are presented in Roman transliteration.    * Paragraphs are not indented and are separated by blank lines.    * Numbered topics, set forth at the beginning of each question and  at certain other places, are ordinarily presented on a separate line  for each topic.    * Titles of questions are in all caps.    Anything else in this electronic edition that does not correspond to  the content of the Benziger Brothers edition may be regarded as a  defect in this edition and attributed to me (David McClamrock).    ________________________    CONTENTS    SECOND PART OF THE SECOND PART (QQ. 1-189)    Question    1.
