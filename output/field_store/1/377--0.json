With an APPENDIX,       In Which the Possibility of Man's attaining           the True Knowledg of GOD, and       Things necessary to Salvation, without         INSTRUCTION, is briefly consider'd.             *       *       *       *       *      To the Reverend    _Mr_. Edward Pococke,    Rector of    _MINAL_, in _Wiltshire_.      Reverend SIR,    Hai Ebn Yokdhan _returns to you again, in a Dress different from that  which you sent him out in. Wherever he comes, he acknowledges you for  his first and best Master; and confesses, that his being put in a  Capacity to travel thro'_ Europe, _is owing to your Hand. I could not in  Equity send him to any other Person, you being the sole Proprietor. And  as your Learning enables you to do him Justice, so your Candor will  incline you to pardon what is by me done amiss. Both which  Qualifications you enjoy, as a Paternal Inheritance, descending from the  Reverend and Learned _Dr. Pococke,_ the Glory and Ornament of our Age  and Nation. Whose Memory I much reverence, and how much I acknowledge my  self indebted to him for his Learned Works, I thought I could no way  express better, than by taking some Opportunity to pay my Respects to  you, Sir, the worthy Son of so great a Father. And no fitter Bearer  than_ Hai Ebn Yokdhan, _with whose Character and Language you are so  well acquainted, and to whom you have long ago shown so great a Respect,  that I have no reason to fear but he will be welcome_.                               _I am_,                                       _SIR,_                     _Your most humble Servant_,                                        Simon Ockley,             *       *       *       *       *      THE PREFACE.      When Mr. _Pococke_ first publish'd this _Arabick_ Author with his  accurate _Latin_ Version, _Anno_ 1671. Dr. _Pococke_ his Father, that  late eminent Professor of the Oriental Languages in the University of  _Oxford_, prefix'd a Preface to it; in which he tells us, that he has  good Reason to think, that this Author was contemporary with _Averroes_,  who died very ancient in the Year of the _Hegira_ 595, which is  co-incident with the 1198th Year of our Lord; according to which Account,  the Author liv'd something above five hundred Years ago.    He liv'd in _Spain_, as appears from one or two Passages in this Book.  He wrote some other Pieces, which are not come to our Hands. This has  been very well receiv'd in the East; one Argument of which is, that it  has been translated by _R. Moses_ _Narbonensis_ into _Hebrew_, and  illustrated with a large Commentary. The Design of the Author is to  shew, how Human Capacity, unassisted by any External Help, may, by due  Application, attain to the Knowledge of Natural Things, and so by  Degrees find out its Dependance upon a Superior Being, the Immortality  of the Soul, and all things necessary to Salvation.    How well he has succeeded in this Attempt, I leave to the Reader to  judge. 'Tis certain, that he was a Man of Parts and very good Learning,  considering the Age he liv'd in, and the way of studying in those Times.  There are a great many lively Stroaks in it; and I doubt not but a  judicious Reader will find his Account in the Perusal of it.    I was not willing ('though importun'd) to undertake the translating it  into _English_, because I was inform'd that it had been done twice  already; once by Dr. _Ashwell_, another time by the _Quakers_, who  imagin'd that there was something in, it that favoured their  Enthusiastick Notions. However, taking it for granted, that both these  Translations we're not made out of the Original _Arabick_, but out of  the _Latin_; I did not question but they had mistaken the Sense of the  Author in many places. Besides, observing that a great many of my  friends whom I had a desire to oblige, and other Persons whom I would  willingly incline to a more favourable Opinion of _Arabick_ Learning,  had not seen this Book; and withal, hoping that I might add something by  way of Annotation or _Appendix_, which would not be altogether useless;  I at last ventur'd to translate it a-new.    I have here and there added a Note, in which there is an account given  of some, great Man, some Custom of the Mahometans explain'd, or  something of that Nature, which I hope will not be unacceptable. And  lest any Person should, through mistake, make any ill use of it, I have  subjoin'd an _Appendix_, the Design of which the Reader may see in its  proper place.    SIMON OCKLEY.             *       *       *       *       *      THE BOOKSELLER TO THE READER.    _When I first undertook the Publication of this English Translation, I  thought it would not be amiss to present the World with a Specimen of it  first. But since the Introduction is such, that the Reader can no more  by it give a Guess at what is contain'd in the Book itself, than a Man  can judge of his Entertainment by seeing the Cloath laid; I have thought  it necessary to give him a Bill of Fare_.    _The Design of the Author (who was a Mahometan Philosopher) is to shew  how Humane Reason may, by Observation and Experience, arrive at the  Knowledge of Natural Things, and from thence to Supernatural;  particularly the Knowledge of God and a Future State. And in order to  this, he supposes a Person brought up by himself where he was  altogether destitute of any Instruction, but what he could get from his  own Observation_.    _He lays the Scene in some_ Fortunate _Island situate under the  Equinoctial; where he supposes this Philosopher, either to have been  bred (according to_ Avicen_'s Hypothesis, who conceiv'd a possibility of  a Man's being formed by the Influence of the Planets upon Matter rightly  disposed) without either Father or Mother; or self-expos'd in his  Infancy, and providentially suckled by a Roe. Not that our Author  believ'd any such matter, but only having design'd to contrive a  convenient place for his Philosopher, so as to leave him to Reason by  himself, and make his Observations without any Guide. In which Relation,  he proposes both these ways, without speaking one Word in favour of  either_.    _Then he shews by what Steps and Degrees he advanc'd in the Knowledge of  Natural Things, till at last he perceiv'd the Necessity of acknowledging  an Infinite, Eternal, Wise Creator, and also the Immateriality and  Immortality of his own Soul, and that its Happiness consisted only in a  continued Conjunction with this supream Being_.    _The Matter of this Book is curious, and full of useful Theorems; he  makes most use of the Peripatetick Philosophy, which he seems to have  well understood; it must be confess'd indeed, that when he comes to talk  of the Union with God, &c. (as in the Introduction) there are some  Enthusiastick Notions, which are particularly consider'd and refuted by  the Editor in his Appendix_.    _Whose Design in publishing this Translation, was to give those who are  as yet unacquainted with it, a Taste of the_ Acumen _and_ Genius _of  the_ Arabian _Philosophers, and to excite young Scholars to the reading  of those Authors, which, through a groundless Conceit of their  Impertinence and Ignorance, have been too long neglected_.    _And tho' we do not pretend to any Discoveries in this Book, especially  at this time of Day, when all parts of Learning are cultivated with so  much Exactness; yet we hope that it will not be altogether unacceptable  to the curious Reader to know what the state of Learning was among the_  Arabs, _five hundred Years since. And if what we shall here communicate,  shall seem little in respect of the Discoveries of this discerning Age;  yet we are confident, that any_ European, _who shall compare the  Learning in this Book, with what was publish'd by any of his own  Country-men at that time, will find himself obliged in Conscience to  give our Author fair Quarter_.             *       *       *       *       *      _Abu Jaaphar Ebn Tophail_'s    INTRODUCTION    To the LIFE of    _Hai Ebn Yokdhan_.    _In the Name of the most Merciful God_.[1]    Blessed be the Almighty and Eternal, the Infinitely Wise and Merciful  God, _who hath taught us the Use of the PEN_[2], who out of his great  Goodness to Mankind, _has made him understand Things which he did not  know_. I praise him for his excellent Gifts, and give him thanks for his  continued Benefits, and I testify that there is but One God, and that he  has no Partner[3]; and that _MAHOMET_ is his Servant and Apostle[4],  endu'd with an excellent Spirit, and Master of convincing Demonstration,  and a victorious Sword: the Blessing of God be upon him, and his  Companions, (Men of great Thoughts, and vast Understandings,) and upon  all his Followers, to the End of the World.    You ask'd me, Dear Friend, (God preserve you for ever, and make you  Partaker of everlasting Happiness) to communicate to you what I knew  concerning the Mysteries of the Eastern Philosophy, mention'd by the  Learned _Avicenna_[5]: Now you must understand, that whoever designs to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16847"],[0,"Hinduism and Buddhism, An Historical Sketch, Vol. 3 (#1)"],[1,"Distributed Proofreading Team at https://www.pgdp.net            Transcriber's Note:    Volume 1 may be found at https://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/5/2/5/15255/    Volume 2 may be found at https://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/6/5/4/16546/         Excerpts from the Preface to the book from Volume 1,       regarding the method of transcription used.         \"In the following pages I have occasion to transcribe words       belonging to many oriental languages in Latin characters.       Unfortunately a uniform system of transcription, applicable       to all tongues, seems not to be practical at present. It was       attempted in the Sacred Books of the East, but that system       has fallen into disuse and is liable to be misunderstood. It       therefore seems best to use for each language the method of       transcription adopted by standard works in English dealing       with each, for French and German transcriptions, whatever       their merits may be as representations of the original       sounds, are often misleading to English readers, especially       in Chinese. For Chinese I have adopted Wade's system as used       in Giles's Dictionary, for Tibetan the system of Sarat       Chandra Das, for Pali that of the Pali Text Society and for       Sanskrit that of Monier-Williams's Sanskrit Dictionary,       except that I write s instead of s. Indian languages however       offer many difficulties: it is often hard to decide whether       Sanskrit or vernacular forms are more suitable and in       dealing with Buddhist subjects whether Sanskrit or Pali       words should be used. I have found it convenient to vary the       form of proper names according as my remarks are based on       Sanskrit or on Pali literature, but this obliges me to write       the same word differently in different places, e.g.       sometimes Ajatasatru and sometimes Ajatasattu, just as in a       book dealing with Greek and Latin mythology one might employ       both Herakles and Hercules. Also many Indian names such as       Ramayana, Krishna, nirvana have become Europeanized or at       least are familiar to all Europeans interested in Indian       literature. It seems pedantic to write them with their full       and accurate complement of accents and dots and my general       practice is to give such words in their accurate spelling       (Ramayana, etc.) when they are first mentioned and also in       the notes but usually to print them in their simpler and       unaccented forms. I fear however that my practice in this       matter is not entirely consistent since different parts of       the book were written at different times.\"      LIST OF ABBREVIATIONS  [From Volume 1]    The following are the principal abbreviations used:    Ep.

That influence  is clear and wide-spread, nay almost universal, and it is with justice  that we speak of Further India and the Dutch call their colonies  Neerlands Indie. For some early chapters in the story of this  expansion the dates and details are meagre, but on the whole the  investigator's chief difficulty is to grasp and marshal the mass of  facts relating to the development of religion and civilization in this  great region.    The spread of Hindu thought was an intellectual conquest, not an  exchange of ideas. On the north-western frontier there was some  reciprocity, but otherwise the part played by India was consistently  active and not receptive. The Far East counted for nothing in her  internal history, doubtless because China was too distant and the  other countries had no special culture of their own. Still it is  remarkable that whereas many Hindu missionaries preached Buddhism in  China, the idea of making Confucianism known in India seems never to  have entered the head of any Chinese.    It is correct to say that the sphere of India's intellectual conquests  was the East and North, not the West, but still Buddhism spread  considerably to the west of its original home and entered Persia.  Stein discovered a Buddhist monastery in \"the terminal marshes of the  Helmund\" in Seistan[1] and Bamian is a good distance from our  frontier. But in Persia and its border lands there were powerful state  religions, first Zoroastrianism and then Islam, which disliked and  hindered the importation of foreign creeds and though we may see some  resemblance between Sufis and Vedantists, it does not appear that the  Moslim civilization of Iran owed much to Hinduism.    But in all Asia north and east of India, excluding most of Siberia but  including the Malay Archipelago, Indian influence is obvious. Though  primarily connected with religion it includes much more, such as  architecture, painting and other arts, an Indian alphabet, a  vocabulary of Indian words borrowed or translated, legends and  customs. The whole life of such diverse countries as Tibet, Burma, and  Java would have been different had they had no connection with India.    In these and many other regions the Hindus must have found a low state  of civilization, but in the Far East they encountered a culture  comparable with their own. There was no question of colonizing or  civilizing rude races. India and China met as equals, not hostile but  also not congenial, a priest and a statesman, and the statesman made  large concessions to the priest. Buddhism produced a great  fermentation and controversy in Chinese thought, but though its  fortunes varied it hardly ever became as in Burma and Ceylon the  national religion. It was, as a Chinese Emperor once said, one of the  two wings of a bird. The Chinese characters did not give way to an  Indian alphabet nor did the Confucian Classics fall into desuetude.  The subjects of Chinese and Japanese pictures may be Buddhist, the  plan and ornaments of their temples Indian, yet judged as works of art  the pictures and temples are indigenous. But for all that one has only  to compare the China of the Hans with the China of the T'angs to see  how great was the change wrought by India.    This outgrowing of Indian influence, so long continued and so wide in  extent, was naturally not the result of any one impulse. At no time  can we see in India any passion of discovery, any fever of conquest  such as possessed Europe when the New World and the route to the East  round the Cape were discovered. India's expansion was slow, generally  peaceful and attracted little attention at home. Partly it was due to  the natural permeation and infiltration of a superior culture beyond  its own borders, but it is equally natural that this gradual process  should have been sometimes accelerated by force of arms. The Hindus  produced no Tamerlanes or Babers, but a series of expeditions, spread  over long ages, but still not few in number, carried them to such  distant goals as Ceylon, Java and Camboja.    But the diffusion of Indian influence, especially in China, was also  due to another agency, namely religious propaganda and the deliberate  despatch of missions. These missions seem to have been exclusively  Buddhist for wherever we find records of Hinduism outside India, for  instance in Java and Camboja, the presence of Hindu conquerors or  colonists is also recorded.[2] Hinduism accompanied Hindus and  sometimes spread round their settlements, but it never attempted to  convert distant and alien lands. But the Buddhists had from the  beginning the true evangelistic temper: they preached to all the world  and in"]]]
