The war will  make a great difference to our income, and we can't--simply _can't_--go  on living in exactly the old way. The sooner we all realize it the  better. I wish I knew where to begin.\"    \"Might knock off going to church, and save the money we give in  collections!\" suggested Percy flippantly. \"It must tot up to quite a  decent sum in the course of a year, not to mention pew rent!\"    His mother cast a reproachful glance at him.    \"Now, Percy, _do_ be serious for once! You and Winona are quite old  enough to understand business matters. I must discuss them with  somebody. As I said before, we shall really have to economize somehow,  and the question is where to begin.\"    \"I saw some hints in a magazine the other day,\" volunteered Winona,  hunting among a pile of papers, and fishing up a copy of _The  Housewife's Journal_. \"Here you are! There's a whole article on War  Economies. It says you can halve your expenses if you only try. It gives  ten different recipes. Number One, Dispense with Servants. Oh, goody! I  don't know how the house would get along without Maggie and Mary! Isn't  that rather stiff?\"    \"It's impossible to be thought of for a moment! I should never dream of  dismissing maids who have lived with me for years. I've read that  article, and it may be practicable for other people, but certainly not  for us. Oh, dear! Some of my friends recommend me to remove to the town,  and others say 'Stay where you are, and keep poultry!'\"    \"We can't leave Highfield! We were all born here!\" objected Winona  decisively.    \"And we tried keeping hens some time ago,\" said Percy. \"They laid on an  average three-quarters of an egg a year each, as far as I remember.\"    \"I'm afraid we didn't know how to manage them,\" replied Mrs. Woodward  fretfully. \"Percy, leave those papers alone! I didn't tell you to turn  them over. You're mixing them all up, tiresome boy! Don't touch them  again! It's no use trying to discuss business with you children! I shall  write and consult Aunt Harriet. Go away, both of you, now! I want to  have a quiet half-hour.\"    Aunt Harriet stood to the Woodward family somewhat in the light of a  Delphic oracle. To apply to her was always the very last resource.  Matters must have reached a crisis, Winona thought, if they were  obliged to appeal to Aunt Harriet's judgment. She followed Percy into  the garden with a sober look on her face.    \"You don't think mother would really leave Highfield?\" she asked her  brother anxiously.    \"Bunkum!\" replied that light-hearted youth. \"We always have more or less  of a fuss when my school bills come in. It'll soon fizzle out again!  Don't you fret yourself. Things will jog on as they always have jogged  on. There'll be nothing done, you'll see. Come on and bowl for me,  that's a chubby one!\"    \"But this time mother really seemed to be in earnest,\" said Winona  meditatively, as she helped to put up the stumps.    Mrs. Woodward had been left a widow three years before this story opens.  She was a fair, fragile little woman, still pretty, and pathetically  helpless. She had been accustomed to lean upon her husband, and now, for  lack of firmer support, she leaned upon Winona. Winona was young to act  as prop, and though it flattered her sense of importance, it had put a  row of wrinkles on her girlish forehead. At fifteen she seemed much  older than Percy at sixteen. No one ever dreamt of taking Percy  seriously; he was one of those jolly, easy-going, happy-go-lucky,  unreliable people who saunter through life with no other aim than to  amuse themselves at all costs. To depend upon him was like trusting to a  boat without a bottom. Though nominally the eldest, he had little more  sense of responsibility than Ernie, the youngest. It was Winona who  shouldered the family burdens.    The Woodwards had always lived at Highfield, and in their opinion it was  the most desirable residence in the whole of Rytonshire. The house was  old enough to be picturesque, but modern enough for comfort. Its quaint  gables, mullioned windows and Cromwellian porch were the joy of  photographers, while the old-fashioned hall, when the big log fire was  lighted, would be hard to beat for coziness. The schoolroom, on the  ground floor, had a separate side entrance on to the lawn, leading  through a small ante-room where boots and coats and cricket bats and  tennis rackets could be kept; the drawing-room had a luxurious ingle  nook with cushioned seats, and all the bedrooms but two had a southern  aspect. As for the big rambling garden, it was full of delightful  old-world flowers that came up year after year: daffodils and violets  and snow-flakes, and clumps of pinks, and orange lilies and Canterbury  bells, and tall Michaelmas daisies, and ribbon grass and royal Osmunda  fern, the sort of flowers that people used to pick in days gone by, put  a paper frill round, and call a nosegay or a posy. There was a lawn for  tennis and cricket, a pond planted with irises and bulrushes, and a wild  corner where crocuses and coltsfoot and golden aconite came up as they  liked in the spring time.    Winona loved this garden with somewhat the same attachment that a French  peasant bears for the soil upon which he has been reared. She rejoiced  in every yard of it. To go away and resign it to others would be  tragedy unspeakable. The fear that Aunt Harriet might recommend the  family to leave Highfield was sufficient to darken her horizon  indefinitely. That her mother had written to consult the oracle she was  well aware, for she had been sent to post the letter. She had an  instinctive apprehension that the answer would prove a turning-point in  her career.    For a day or two everything went on as usual. Mrs. Woodward did not  again allude to her difficulties, Percy had conveniently forgotten them,  and the younger children were not aware of their existence. Winona lived  with a black spot dancing before her mental eyes. It was continually  rising up and blotting out the sunshine. On the fourth morning appeared  a letter addressed in an old-fashioned slanting handwriting, and bearing  the Seaton post mark. Mrs. Woodward read it in silence, and left her  toast unfinished. Aunt Harriet's communications generally upset her for  the day.    \"Come here, Winona,\" she said agitatedly, after breakfast. \"Oh, dear, I  wish I knew what to do! It's so very unexpected, but of course it would  be a splendid thing for you. If only I could consult somebody! I suppose  girls nowadays will have to learn to support themselves, and the war  will alter everything, but I'd always meant you to stop at home and look  after the little ones for me, and it's very--\"    \"What does Aunt Harriet say, mother?\" interrupted Winona, with a catch  in her throat.    \"She says a great deal, and I dare say she's right. Oh, this terrible  war! Things were so different when I was a girl! You might as well read  the letter for yourself, as it concerns you. I always think she's hard  on Percy, poor lad! I was afraid the children were too noisy the last  time she was here, but they wouldn't keep quiet. I'm sure I try to do my  best all round, and you know, Winona, how I said Aunt Harriet--\"    But Winona was already devouring the letter.                                              \"10 Abbey Close,                                                      \"Seaton,                                                        \"August 26th.            \"MY DEAR FLORITA,--You are quite right to consult me          in your difficulties, and are welcome to any advice which I am          able to offer you. I am sorry to hear of your financial          embarrassments, but I am not surprised. The present increase in          the cost of living, and extra taxation, will make retrenchments          necessary to everybody. In the circumstances I should not advise          you to leave Highfield. (\"Oh, thank goodness!\" ejaculated          Winona.) The expense of a removal would probably cancel what you          would otherwise save.

DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE    FARMERS' BULLETIN No. 1408    _The_ HOUSE FLY AND HOW TO SUPPRESS IT    [Illustration: fly]    [Illustration: USDA seal]          The presence of flies is an indication of uncleanliness, insanitary  conditions, and improper disposal of substances in which they breed.  They are not only annoying; they are actually dangerous to health,  because they may carry disease germs to exposed foods.    It is therefore important to know where and how they breed, and to apply  such knowledge in combating them. This bulletin gives information on  this subject. Besides giving directions for ridding the house of flies  by the use of screens, fly papers, poisons, and flytraps, it lays  especial emphasis on the explanation of methods of eliminating breeding  places and preventing the breeding of flies.

Several species of flies are found commonly in houses. Some of them so  closely resemble the true house fly that it requires very careful  observation to distinguish them from it.    One of these is the biting stable fly[2] (fig. 1). It occurs frequently  in houses and differs from the house fly in the important particular  that its mouth parts are formed for piercing the skin. This fly is so  often mistaken for the house fly that most people think that the house  fly can bite.    Another frequent visitant of houses, particularly in the spring and  fall, is the cluster fly.[3] It is somewhat larger than the house fly,  and is distinguished by its covering of fine yellowish hairs.  Occasionally this fly occurs in houses in such numbers as to cause great  annoyance. It gets its name of \"cluster fly\" from its habit of  collecting in compact groups or clusters in protected corners during  cold periods.    Several species of metallic greenish or bluish flies also are found  occasionally in houses. These include a blue-bottle fly,[4] the black  blowflies,[5] and the green-bottle (fig. 2) flies.[6] They breed in  decaying animal matter.    [Footnote 1: _Musca domestica_ L.]  [Footnote 2: _Stomoxys calcitrans_ L.]  [Footnote 3: _Pollenia rudis_ Fab.]  [Footnote 4: _Calliphora erythrocephala_ Meig.]  [Footnote 5: _Phormia regina_ Meig. and _P. terrae-novae_ Desv.]  [Footnote 6: _Lucilia caesar_ L., _L. sericata_ Meig., and other species  of the genus.]    There is still another species, smaller than any of those so far  mentioned, which is sometimes called the \"lesser house fly.\"[7] This  insect is distinguished from the ordinary house fly by its paler and  more pointed body. The male, which is commoner than the female, has  large pale patches at the base of the abdomen, which are translucent  when the fly is seen on the window pane. These little flies are not the  young of the larger flies. Flies do not grow after the wings have once  expanded and dried.    [Footnote 7: _Fannia canicularis_ L.]    [Illustration: FIG. 1.--The stable fly. Much enlarged.]    [Illustration: FIG. 2.--One of the green-bottle flies (_Lucilia  caesar_). Much enlarged.]    In late summer and autumn many specimens of a small fruit fly, known as  the \"vinegar fly,\"[8] make their appearance, attracted by the odor of  overripe fruit.    All of these species, however, are greatly dwarfed in numbers by the  common house fly. In 1900 the senior author made collections of the  flies in dining rooms in different parts of the country, and found that  the true house fly made up 98.8 per cent of the whole number captured.  The remainder comprised various species, including those mentioned  above.    [Footnote 8: _Drosophila ampelophila_ Loew.]    [Illustration: Fig. 3.--The true house fly. Enlarged.]          WHERE THE TRUE HOUSE FLY LAYS ITS EGGS.      The true house fly (fig. 3), which is found in nearly all parts of the  world, is a medium-sized fly with four black stripes on the back and a  sharp elbow in one of the veins of the wings. The house fly can not  bite, its mouth parts being spread out at the tip for sucking up liquid  substances.    The eggs (figs. 4, 5) are laid upon horse manure. This substance seems  to be its favorite larval food. It will breed also in human excrement,  and because of this habit it is very dangerous to the health of human  beings, carrying as it does the germs of intestinal diseases, such as  typhoid fever and cholera, from the excreta to food supplies. It has  also been found to breed freely in hog manure, in considerable numbers  in chicken dung, and to some extent in cow manure. Indeed, it will lay  its eggs on a great variety of decaying vegetable and animal materials,  but of the flies that infest dwelling houses, both in cities and on  farms, a vast proportion come from horse manure.    [Illustration: FIG. 4.--Eggs of the house fly. About natural size.  (Newstead.)]    It often happens, however, that this fly is very abundant in localities  where little or no horse manure is found, and in such cases it breeds in  other manure, such as chicken manure in backyard poultry lots, or in  slops or fermenting vegetable material, such as spent hops, moist bran,  ensilage, or rotting potatoes. Accumulations of organic material on the  dumping grounds of towns and cities often produce flies in great  numbers.    [Illustration: FIG. 5.--Eggs of the house fly. Highly magnified.  (Newstead.)]    The house fly begins laying eggs in from 2 1/2 to 20 days after  emerging, the time interval depending to a large extent upon  temperature, humidity, and character and abundance of food. The number  of eggs laid by an individual fly at one time ranges from 120 to 159 and  a single female will usually lay two and sometimes four such batches.  Dunn has recently reported that in Panama a fly may deposit as many as  2,367 eggs in 21 batches, and sometimes an interval of only 36 hours may  occur between the deposition of large batches of eggs. The enormous  numbers in which the insects occur are thus plainly accounted for,  especially when the abundance and universal occurrence of appropriate  larval food is considered. The eggs are deposited below the surface in  the cracks and interstices of the manure, several females usually  depositing in one spot, so that the eggs commonly are found in large  clusters (fig. 4) in selected places near the top of the pile, where a  high degree of heat is maintained by the fermentation below. The second  batch of eggs is laid from 8 to 10 days after the first. The eggs  usually hatch in less than 24 hours. Under the most favorable conditions  of temperature and moisture the egg state may last hardly more than 8  hours. The maggots which issue from the eggs are very small and  transparent. They grow rapidly, completing the growth of the larva stage  in three days under the most favorable conditions, although this stage  usually lasts from 4 to 7 days. The larval period may be prolonged  greatly by low temperature or by dryness or scarcity of the larval food.  As the larvae (fig. 6) attain full size they gradually assume a creamy  white color. A few hours before pupation they become very restless and  migrate from their feeding ground in search of a favorable place in  which to pass the pupa stage. They will often congregate at the edges of  manure piles near the ground or burrow into the soil beneath, or they  may crawl considerable distances away from the pile to pupate in the  ground or in loose material under the edges of stones, boards, etc.    [Illustration: FIG. 6.--Larvae, or maggots, of the house fly. About  natural size. (Newstead.)]    The pupae (fig 7), or \"sleepers,\" are more or less barrel shaped and dark  brown in color. In midsummer this stage usually lasts from 3 to 6 days.  The pupa stage is easily affected by temperature changes and may be  prolonged during hibernation for as long as 4 or 5 months. Numerous  rearing experiments in various"]]]
