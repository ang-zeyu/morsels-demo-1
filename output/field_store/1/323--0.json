For this purpose, while ostensibly relating the adventures of a  Chair, he has endeavored to keep a distinct and unbroken thread of  authentic history. The Chair is made to pass from one to another of those  personages, of whom he thought it most desirable for the young reader to  have vivid and familiar ideas, and whose lives and actions would best  enable him to give picturesque sketches of the times. On its sturdy oaken  legs, it trudges diligently from one scene to another, and seems always to  thrust itself in the way, with most benign complacency, whenever a  historical personage happens to be looking round for a seat.    There is certainly no method, by which the shadowy outlines of departed  men and women can he made to assume the hues of life more effectually,  than by connecting their images with the substantial and homely reality of  a fireside chair. It causes us to feel at once, that these characters of  history had a private and familiar existence, and were not wholly  contained within that cold array of outward action, which we are compelled  to receive as the adequate representation of their lives. If this  impression can be given, much is accomplished.    Setting aside Grandfather and his auditors, and excepting the adventures  of the Chair, which form the machinery of the work, nothing in the ensuing  pages can be termed fictitious. The author, it is true, has sometimes  assumed the license of filling up the outline of history with details, for  which he has none but imaginative authority, but which, he hopes, do not  violate nor give a false coloring to the truth. He believes that, in this  respect, his narrative will not be found to convey ideas and impressions,  of which the reader may hereafter find it necessary to purge his mind.    The author's great doubt is, whether he has succeeded in writing a book  which will be readable by the class for whom he intends it. To make a  lively and entertaining narrative for children, with such unmalleable  material as is presented by the sombre, stern, and rigid characteristics  of the Puritans and their descendants, is quite as difficult an attempt,  as to manufacture delicate playthings out of the granite rocks on which  New England is founded.                               THE WHOLE HISTORY OF GRANDFATHER'S CHAIR                               COMPLETE IN THREE PARTS.            PART I          Chapter I      Grandfather had been sitting in his old arm-chair, all that pleasant  afternoon, while the children were pursuing their various sports, far off  or near at hand. Sometimes you would have said, \"Grandfather is asleep;\"  but still, even when his eyes were closed, his thoughts were with the  young people, playing among the flowers and shrubbery of the garden.    He heard the voice of Laurence, who had taken possession of a heap of  decayed branches which the gardener had lopped from the fruit trees, and  was building a little hut for his cousin Clara and himself. He heard  Clara's gladsome voice, too, as she weeded and watered the flower-bed  which had been given her for her own. He could have counted every footstep  that Charley took, as he trundled his wheelbarrow along the gravel walk.  And though Grandfather was old and gray-haired, yet his heart leaped with  joy whenever little Alice came fluttering, like a butterfly, into the  room. She had made each of the children her playmate in turn, and now made  Grandfather her playmate too, and thought him the merriest of them all.    At last the children grew weary of their sports; because a summer  afternoon is like a long lifetime to the young. So they came into the room  together, and clustered round Grandfather's great chair. Little Alice, who  was hardly five years old, took the privilege of the youngest, and climbed  his knee. It was a pleasant thing to behold that fair and golden-haired  child in the lap of the old man, and to think that, different as they  were, the hearts of both could be gladdened with the same joys.    \"Grandfather,\" said little Alice, laying her head back upon his arm, \"I am  very tired now. You must tell me a story to make me go to sleep.\"    \"That is not what story-tellers like,\" answered Grandfather, smiling.  \"They are better satisfied when they can keep their auditors awake.\"    \"But here are Laurence, and Charley, and I,\" cried cousin Clara, who was  twice as old as little Alice. \"We will all three keep wide awake. And  pray, Grandfather, tell us a story about this strange-looking old chair.\"    Now, the chair in which Grandfather sat was made of oak, which had grown  dark with age, but had been rubbed and polished till it shone as bright as  mahogany. It was very large and heavy, and had a back that rose high above  Grandfather's white head. This back was curiously carved in open work, so  as to represent flowers and foliage and other devices; which the children  had often gazed at, but could never understand what they meant. On the  very tiptop of the chair, over the head of Grandfather himself, was a  likeness of a lion's head, which had such a savage grin that you would  almost expect to hear it growl and snarl.    The children had seen Grandfather sitting in this chair ever since they  could remember any thing. Perhaps the younger of them supposed that he and  the chair had come into the world together, and that both had always been  as old as they were now. At this time, however, it happened to be the  fashion for ladies to adorn their drawing-rooms with the oldest and oddest  chairs that could be found. It seemed to cousin Clara that if these ladies  could have seen Grandfather's old chair, they would have thought it worth  all the rest together. She wondered if it were not even older than  Grandfather himself, and longed to know all about its history.    \"Do, Grandfather, talk to us about this chair,\" she repeated.    \"Well, child,\" said Grandfather, patting Clara's cheek, \"I can tell you a  great many stories of my chair. Perhaps your cousin Laurence would like to  hear them too. They would teach him something about the history and  distinguished people of his country, which he has never read in any of his  school-books.\"    Cousin Laurence was a boy of twelve, a bright scholar, in whom an early  thoughtfulness and sensibility began to show themselves. His young fancy  kindled at the idea of knowing all the adventures of this venerable chair.  He looked eagerly in Grandfather's face; and even Charley, a bold, brisk,  restless little fellow of nine, sat himself down on the carpet, and  resolved to be quiet for at least ten minutes, should the story last so  long.    Meantime, little Alice was already asleep; so Grandfather, being much  pleased with such an attentive audience, began to talk about matters that  had happened long ago.          Chapter II      But, before relating the adventures of the chair, Grandfather found it  necessary to speak of the circumstances that caused the first settlement  of New England. For it will soon be perceived that the story of this  remarkable chair cannot be told without telling a great deal of the  history of the country.    So, Grandfather talked about the Puritans, as those persons were called  who thought it sinful to practise the religious forms and ceremonies which  the Church of England had borrowed from the Roman Catholics. These  Puritans suffered so much persecution in England that, in 1607, many of  them went over to Holland, and lived ten or twelve years at Amsterdam and  Leyden. But they feared that, if they continued there much longer, they  should cease to be English, and should adopt all the manners and ideas and  feelings of the Dutch. For this and other reasons, in the year 1620, they  embarked on board of the ship Mayflower, and crossed the ocean to the  shores of Cape Cod. There they made a settlement, and called it Plymouth;  which, though now a part of Massachusetts, was for a long time a colony by  itself. And thus was formed the earliest settlement of the Puritans in  America.    Meantime, those of the Puritans who remained in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15699"],[0,"A Handbook of the Boer War (#1)"],[1,"HANDBOOK OF THE BOER WAR    With General Map of South Africa  and 18 Sketch Maps  and Plans      GALE AND POLDEN LIMITED    LONDON AND ALDERSHOT    1910    BUTLER & TANNER    THE SELWOOD PRINTING WORKS    FROME AND LONDON          CONTENTS      CHAPTER                                    PAGE    I  PROLEGOMENA                               1      I  The Roundheads of South Africa          1      II  Patriotism, Duty and Discipline       19      III  War considered as a Branch of Sport  26    II  THE NATAL WEDGE                         36    III  DEUS EX MACHINA NO.

Amery, Esq., for permission to copy the plans in the  fifth volume of the _Times_ History of the War.]          PREFATORY NOTE      The author has endeavoured in this Handbook to compile, for the use of  students and others, a general account of the various phases of the Boer  War of 1899-1902, in which he served for twenty-six months.    With some exceptions, every statement of fact relating to the military  operations may be verified in one or more of the following  publications--        The \"Times\" History of the War;        The War Office Official History of the War;        The Minutes of Evidence taken before the Royal Commission of      Inquiry into the War.    To the two Histories, which have been but recently completed, the Author  is much indebted. Other authorities have, however, been consulted.    The Sketch Maps and Plans of certain areas and battlefields are only  intended to give, by means of a few hachures, contours, and form-lines,  a general impression of topographical features.    The Author has from time to time in the course of the narrative  indicated what he believes to have been the chief causes of the  prolongation of the War:--        The inefficacy of modern Tactics as a means of dealing with      partisan warfare;        The moral reinforcement derived from a confident belief in the      justice of a cause, by which the enemy was continually      encouraged to persevere;        The reluctance of the British leaders to fight costly battles;        The constitutional inability of the British Officer to take War      seriously;        The waste of British horses due to inexpert Horsemastership.    May, 1910.          CHAPTER I    Prolegomena    I. THE ROUNDHEADS OF SOUTH AFRICA      History often reproduces without reference to nationality some  particular human type or class which becomes active and predominant for  a time, and fades away when its task is finished. It is, however, not  utterly lost, for the germ of it lies dormant yet ready to re-appear  when the exigencies of the moment recall it. The reserve forces of human  nature are inexhaustible and inextinguishable.    It is probable that few of the Boers had ever heard of Oliver Cromwell,  or that his life and times had ever been studied in the South African  Republics, and had influenced the Boer action; yet the affinity of the  South African burghers of the XIXth century with the Puritans and the  Roundheads of the XVIIth is striking. It was not so much a parallelism  of aims and hopes, for the struggle in England was political and not  national as in South Africa, as of temperament, character, and method.  There was hardly an individuity in the Boers of the War which might not  have been found in the followers of Cromwell. Like these they were  fanatically but sincerely religious, and their unabashed and fearless  adherence to their beliefs and their open observance of the outward  forms of religion exposed them to the same cruel and baseless charge of  hypocrisy. Just as the aristocratic followers of Charles I had jeered at  the Roundheads, so did every thoughtless officer and newspaper  correspondent jeer at the psalm-singing and the prayer meetings in the  laagers. The Boers had the courage of their religious opinions, and were  not ashamed to proclaim them in the face of man. The Bible was the only  book they knew, and they guided themselves according to their lights by  its precepts. In opposing the English they believed that they were  resisting the enemies of the Almighty. Like the Puritans they honestly  thought that certain passages in the Holy Scriptures applied to them as  the Chosen People, and that they were assured of Divine Protection; and  if they erred in their exegesis their delusion at least deserves  respect. Yet all the while the Old Testament was the volume they chiefly  studied, and if they quoted the New Testament they sometimes modified  the context to their own advantage.    Each Puritan movement has derived its strength not so much from its  abstract merit as from the intense personal conviction felt by each unit  engaged in it, that the righteousness of the cause was unassailable. The  Puritan never wavered in philosophic doubt. No misgivings disturbed his  soul, and he pursued his object with all the strength of his body.    The Puritan stir in the reign of Charles I was a revival, almost a  continuation, of the half political, half religious activity which in  the previous century had effected the Reformation. The Boer movement in  South Africa, which sprang up after a germination lasting three  generations, was brought about by a recrudescence of the spirit which  made the Boers of the Netherlands rise against Alva and the Spanish  domination in the XVIth century.    In the XVIIth century the Boers of the Netherlands, made a voluntary  settlement in South Africa, and there under the Southern Cross they were  joined by French Puritans, who had fought under Condé and who left their  country after the revocation of the Edict of Nantes, and also by some  persecuted sectaries from Piedmont. The two stocks, although one was of  Teutonic and the other of Celtic origin, easily came together, and under  the pressure of common interests and common dangers were consolidated  and vulcanized: and if in the previous generation the English Pilgrim  Fathers of the _Mayflower_ had directed their course to the south  instead of to the west, and had cast anchor off the shore of that  distant region of Good Hope, it is probable that a mighty nation would  have been founded in South Africa.    Cromwell as the military leader of the Commonwealth Boers is, at least  in England where the military art has not been scientifically studied,  one of the suppressed characters of history. His political achievements,  as is perhaps natural in a community which courts the voter and despises  the soldier, have put out of sight the means by which he mainly won  them; namely his genius as a cavalry and partisan commander. An  ungainly, narrow-minded, bigoted, bucolic squireen of Huntingdon,  lacking in every quality which we are accustomed to associate with a  cavalry officer, inaugurated an era in the history of Mounted Troops.  His methods are studied on the Continent, and the German Staff has  recently discovered that he was the first leader to use cavalry as a  screen to hide the movements of the main body. Yet there is no evidence  that he ever studied the military art, and he did not become a soldier  until he had reached his fourth decade. In the Royalist Army opposed to  him were soldiers by profession and experience; officers and men who had  been under Gustavus Adolphus in the Thirty Years' War; for in the XVIIth  century the services of aliens were in request on the Continent, and at  one time no less than eighty-seven senior officers of British  nationality were serving in the Swedish Army, then the most renowned in  Europe. Yet Cromwell with his \"Eastern Association,\" his Ironsides, his  yeomen and raw levies, beat the Royalist Army, officered from the same  class which is still believed to possess the monopoly of the aptitude  for "]]]
