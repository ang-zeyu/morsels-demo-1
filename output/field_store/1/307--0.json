What are you giving so that others may live?    _Eat less_    WHEAT    MEAT    FATS    SUGAR    Send more to Europe or they will Starve]          FOREWORD      Food will win the war, and the nation whose food resources are best  conserved will be the victor. This is the truth that our government  is trying to drive home to every man, woman and child in America. We  have always been happy in the fact that ours was the richest nation  in the world, possessing unlimited supplies of food, fuel, energy  and ability; but rich as these resources are they will not meet  the present food shortage unless every family and every individual  enthusiastically co-operates in the national saving campaign as  outlined by the United States Food Administration.    The regulations prescribed for this saving campaign are simple and  easy of application. Our government does not ask us to give up three  square meals a day--nor even one. All it asks is that we substitute as  far as possible corn and other cereals for wheat, reduce a little our  meat consumption and save sugar and fats by careful utilization of  these products.    There are few housekeepers who are not eager to help in this saving  campaign, and there are few indeed who do not feel the need of  conserving family resources. But just how is sometimes a difficult  task.    This book is planned to solve the housekeeper's problem. It shows how  to substitute cereals and other grains for wheat, how to cut down  the meat bill by the use of meat extension and meat substitute dishes  which supply equivalent nutrition at much less cost; it shows the use  of syrup and other products that save sugar, and it explains how to  utilize all kinds of fats. It contains 47 recipes for the making of  war breads; 64 recipes on low-cost meat dishes and meat substitutes;  54 recipes for sugarless desserts; menus for meatless and wheatless  days, methods of purchasing--in all some two hundred ways of meeting  present food conditions at minimum cost and without the sacrifice of  nutrition.    Not only have its authors planned to help the woman in the home,  conserve the family income, but to encourage those saving habits which  must be acquired by this nation if we are to secure a permanent peace  that will insure the world against another onslaught by the Prussian  military powers.    A little bit of saving in food means a tremendous aggregate total,  when 100,000,000 people are doing the saving. One wheatless meal a  day would not mean hardship; there are always corn and other products  to be used. Yet one wheatless meal a day in every family would mean a  saving of 90,000,000 bushels of wheat, which totals 5,400,000,000 lbs.  Two meatless days a week would mean a saving of 2,200,000 lbs. of meat  per annum. One teaspoonful of sugar per person saved each day would  insure a supply ample to take care of our soldiers and our Allies.  These quantities mean but a small individual sacrifice, but when  multiplied by our vast population they will immeasurably aid and  encourage the men who are giving their lives to the noble cause of  humanity on which our nation has embarked.    _The Authors._          CONTENTS                                          PAGE    FOREWORD       4      SAVE WHEAT: Reasons Why Our Government Asks Us to Save Wheat, with            Practical Recipes for the Use of Other Grains       11      A General rule for proportions in bread-making       15      Use of Corn       18      Use of Oats       20      Use of Rye       22      Use of Barley       23      Use of Potatoes       24      Use of Mixed Grains       25      Pancakes and Waffles       27      SAVE MEAT: Reasons Why Our Government Has Asked Us to Save Meat,            with Practical Recipes for Meat Conservation       29      Selection of Meat       33, 36, 37, 38      Methods of Cooking       34, 35      Charts       36, 37      Comparative Composition of Meat and Meat Substitutes       38      Economy of Meat and Meat Substitutes       39      Meat Economy Dishes       41      Fish as a Meat Substitute       44      Fish Recipes       46      Cheese as a Meat Substitute       49      Meat Substitute Dishes       53      SAVE SUGAR: Reasons Why Our Government Asks Us to Save Sugar, with            Practical Recipes for Sugarless Desserts, Cakes, Candies            and Preserves      57      Sugarless Desserts      61      Sugarless Preserves      71      SAVE FAT: Reasons Why Our Government Asks Us to Save Fat, with            Practical Recipes for Fat Conservation      73      To Render Fats      78      Various Uses for Leftover Fats      82      SAVE FOOD: Reasons Why Our Government Asks Us Not to Waste Food,            with Practical Recipes for the Use of Leftovers      83      A Simple Way to Plan a Balanced Ration      84      Table Showing Number of Calories per Day Required by Various            Classes      91      Sauces Make Leftovers Attractive       93      Use of Gelatine in Combining Leftovers      97      Salads Provide an Easy Method of Using Leftovers      99      Use of Stale Bread, Cake and Leftover Cereals      102      Soups Utilize Leftovers      106      All-in-one-dish Meals--Needing only fruit or simple dessert,            bread and butter to complete a well-balanced menu      109      Wheatless Day Menus      113      Meatless Day Menus      115      Meat Substitute Dinners      116      Vegetable Dinners      118      Save and Serve--Bread; Meat; Sugar; Fat; Milk; Vegetables            120, 121      Blank Pages for Recording Favorite Family Recipes      122          _The Recipes in this book have been examined and approved by the  United States Food Administration_      _Illustrations furnished by courtesy of the United States Food  Administration_          [Illustration]    All the recipes in this book have been prepared and used in The School  of Modern Cookery conducted by _The Forecast Magazine_ and have been  endorsed by the U.S. Food Administration. They have been worked  out under the direction of Grace E. Frysinger, graduate in Domestic  Science of Drexel Institute, of Philadelphia, and the University  of Chicago. Miss Frysinger, who has had nine years' experience as  a teacher of Domestic Science, has earnestly used her skill to make  these recipes practical for home use, and at the same time accurate  and scientific.    The above illustration shows a class at the School of Modern Cookery.  These classes are entirely free, the instruction being given in  the interest of household economics. The foods cooked during the  demonstration are sampled by the students and in this way it is  possible to get in close touch with the needs of the homemakers and  the tastes of the average family.          FOODS THAT WILL WIN THE WAR          [Illustration]          SAVE WHEAT    _REASONS WHY OUR GOVERNMENT ASKS US TO SAVE WHEAT, WITH PRACTICAL  RECIPES FOR THE USE OF OTHER GRAINS_      A slice of bread seems an unimportant thing. Yet one good-sized slice  of bread weighs an ounce. It contains almost three-fourths of an ounce  of flour.    If every one of the country's 20,000,000 homes wastes on the average  only one such slice of bread a day, the country is throwing away  daily over 14,000,000 ounces of flour--over 875,000 pounds, or enough  flour for over a million one-pound loaves a day. For a full year  at this rate there would be a waste of over 319,000,000 pounds of  flour--1,500,000 barrels--enough flour to make 365,000,000 loaves.    As it takes four and one-half bushels of wheat to make a barrel  of ordinary flour, this waste would represent the flour from over  7,000,000 bushels of wheat. Fourteen and nine-tenths bushels of wheat  on the average are raised per acre. It would take the product of some  470,000 acres just to provide a single slice of bread to be wasted  daily in every home.    But some one says, \"a full slice of bread is not wasted in every  home.\" Very well, make it a daily slice for every four or every ten  or every thirty homes--make it a weekly or monthly slice in every  home--or make the wasted slice thinner. The waste of flour involved  is still appalling. These are figures compiled by government experts,  and they should give pause to every housekeeper who permits a slice of  bread to be wasted in her home.    Another source of waste of which few of us take account is home-made  bread. Sixty per cent. of the bread used in America is made in the  home. When one stops to consider how much home-made bread is poorly  made, and represents a large waste of flour, yeast and fuel, this  housewifely energy is not so commendable. The bread flour used in the  home is also in the main wheat flour, and all waste of wheat at the  present time increases the shortage of this most necessary food.    Fuel, too, is a serious national problem, and all coal used in either"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15478"],[0,"New York Times Current History: The European War, Vol 2, No. 1, April, 1915 (#1)"],[1,"the Project Gutenberg Online Distributed Proofreading Team        Note: Project Gutenberg also has an HTML version of this        file which includes the original illustrations.

Every enemy merchant ship found in this war zone will be destroyed, even  if it is impossible to avert dangers which threaten the crew and  passengers.    Also neutral ships in the war zone are in danger, as in consequence of  the misuse of neutral flags ordered by the British Government on Jan.  31, and in view of the hazards of naval warfare, it cannot always be  avoided that attacks meant for enemy ships endanger neutral ships.    Shipping northward, around the Shetland Islands, in the eastern basin of  the North Sea, and a strip of at least thirty nautical miles in breadth  along the Dutch coast, is endangered in the same way.      AMERICAN NOTE TO GERMANY.    Feb. 10, 1915.    _The Secretary of State has instructed Ambassador Gerard at Berlin to  present to the German Government a note to the following effect:_    The Government of the United States, having had its attention directed  to the proclamation of the German Admiralty, issued on the 4th of  February, that the waters surrounding Great Britain and Ireland,  including the whole of the English Channel, are to be considered as  comprised within the seat of war; that all enemy merchant vessels found  in those waters after the 18th inst. will be destroyed, although it may  not always be possible to save crews and passengers; and that neutral  vessels expose themselves to danger within this zone of war because, in  view of the misuse of neutral flags said to have been ordered by the  British Government on the 31st of January and of the contingencies of  maritime warfare, it may not be possible always to exempt neutral  vessels from attacks intended to strike enemy ships, feels it to be its  duty to call the attention of the Imperial German Government, with  sincere respect and the most friendly sentiments, but very candidly and  earnestly, to the very serious possibilities of the course of action  apparently contemplated under that proclamation.    The Government of the United States views those possibilities with such  grave concern that it feels it to be its privilege, and, indeed, its  duty, in the circumstances to request the Imperial German Government to  consider before action is taken the critical situation in respect of the  relation between this country and Germany which might arise were the  German naval forces, in carrying out the policy foreshadowed in the  Admiralty's proclamation, to destroy any merchant vessel of the United  States or cause the death of American citizens.    It is, of course, not necessary to remind the German Government that the  sole right of a belligerent in dealing with neutral vessels on the high  seas is limited to visit and search, unless a blockade is proclaimed and  effectively maintained, which this Government does not understand to be  proposed in this case. To declare or exercise a right to attack and  destroy any vessel entering a prescribed area of the high seas without  first certainly determining its belligerent nationality and the  contraband character of its cargo would be an act so unprecedented in  naval warfare that this Government is reluctant to believe that the  Imperial Government of Germany in this case contemplates it as possible.    The suspicion that enemy ships are using neutral flags improperly can  create no just presumption that all ships"]]]
