Acknowledgment.      To have prepared this book within the time allotted to it, without the  assistance of Candidates ALCOTT FARRAR ELWELL and LYLE MILTON PROUSE  would have been impossible, and grateful recognition is made of their  services. Not only much of the manual labor, but the preparation of  entire chapters, has been in their hands.    Candidates CHARLES HUNTINGTON JACOBS and MICHAEL FRANCIS MCALEER have  rendered very valuable assistance and we wish to thank the following  candidates for the loan of materials used elsewhere, for typewriting  and other work:              GLENN MACK AINSWORTH.

The officer of to-day has big problems to face at short notice. His  training has necessarily been so intensive that he cannot absorb a  large amount of it. He has little time to make out schedules or even  to look over the hasty notes he may have made during his training  period, yet he finds himself facing problems which force him to  immediate action.    This book so condenses and systematizes general military instruction  and the work done at Plattsburg so that it may be easily utilized in  training other troops. No broad claim for originality is made except  in the arrangement of all available material; the bibliography makes  acknowledgment to all texts so utilized. Besides bringing helpful  reminders to new officers regarding the elements of modern warfare,  much of the material will be found of radical importance, as it is  practically new and never before condensed. Since under the new army  organization the platoon leader virtually has assumed the roll of a  captain of a company, it is not enough for him to know simply his own  part; he must be ready with all the information that his  non-commissioned officers and men should know, and more important  still, he must know how to teach them. Having little or no time to  work over and digest for himself this mass of new material pouring in  upon him, the officer may find in this book, material condensed and  already arranged.    It is hoped that this work will serve to recall to many officers,  valuable points of military training which would otherwise be lost,  to them in the mass of notes never looked at since the day they were  made. More than this, every reader will find help in planning his  work, saving thereby precious hours already too full of necessary  duties, and will find fresh material for progress in the game of war.    It is the purpose of this book to help men who are in the service of  the United States, and through them to share in bringing victory.

The moral tone is plain. \"She is kind  to the old blind man.\"    The exercises are still suitable, and perhaps more helpful than some  contemporary alternatives. Much is left to the teacher. Explanations given  in the text are enough to get started teaching a child to read and write.  Counting in Roman numerals is included as a bonus in the form of lesson  numbers.    Each lesson begins with vocabulary words, followed by the description of a  picture (if any) related to the lesson's reading exercise. The lesson then  consists of printed text for reading and sometimes script (handwriting)  for reading or copying.    Don Kostuch  ]        ECLECTIC EDUCATIONAL SERIES.

NEW YORK - CHICHESTER - WEINHEIM - BRISBANE - SINGAPORE - TORONTO    SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS.    This First Reader may be used in teaching reading by any of the methods in  common use; but it is especially adapted to the Phonic Method, the Word  Method, or a combination of the two.    I. Phonic Method.--First teach the elementary sounds and their  representative, the letters marked with diacriticals, as they occur in the  lessons; then, the formation of words by the combination of these sounds.  For instance, teach the pupil to identify the characters a, o, n, d, g, r,  and th, in Lesson I, as the representatives of certain elementary sounds;  then teach him to form the words at the head of the lesson, then other  words, as nag, on, and, etc. Pursue a similar course in teaching the  succeeding lessons. Having read a few lessons in this manner, begin to  teach the names of the letters and the spelling of words, and require the  groups, \"a man,\" \"the man,\" \"a pen,\" to be read as a good reader would  pronounce single words.    II.  When one of the letters in the combinations ou or ow, is marked in  the words at the head of the reading exercises, the other is silent. If  neither is marked, the two letters represent a diphthong. All other  unmarked vowels in the vocabularies, when in combination, are silent  letters. In slate or blackboard work, the silent letters may be canceled.    III. Word Method.--Teach the pupil to identify at sight the words placed  at the head of the reading exercises, and to read these exercises without  hesitation. Having read a few lessons, begin to teach the names of the  letters and the spelling of words.    IV. Word Method and Phonic Method Combined.--Teach the pupil to identify  words and read sentences, as above. Having read a few lessons in this  manner, begin to use the Phonic Method, combining it with the Word Method,  by first teaching the words in each lesson as words; then the elementary  sounds, the names of the letters, and spelling.    V. Teach the pupil to use script letters in writing, when teaching the  names of the letters and the spelling of words.      Copyright, 1879, by Van Antwerp, Bragg & Co.

EP486        Preface    In presenting McGuffey's Revised First Reader to the public, attention is  invited to the following features:    1. Words of only two or three letters are used in the first lessons.  Longer and more difficult ones are gradually introduced as the pupil gains  aptness in the mastery of words.    2. A proper gradation has been carefully preserved. All new words are  placed at the head of each lesson, to be learned before the lesson is  read. Their number in the early lessons is very small, thus making the  first steps easy. All words in these vocabularies are used in the text  immediately following.    3. Carefully engraved script exercises are introduced for a double  purpose. These should be used to teach the reading of script; and may also  serve as copies in slate work.    4. The illustrations have been designed and engraved specially for the  lessons in which they occur. Many of the engravings will serve admirably  as the basis for oral lessons in language.    5. The type is large, strong, and distinct.    The credit for this revision is almost wholly due to the  friends of  McGuffey's Readers,--eminent teachers and scholars, who have contributed  suggestions and criticisms gained from their daily work in the schoolroom.
