Heraldry is the science which teaches how to blazon or describe in  proper terms armorial bearings and their accessories.    Many volumes have been written on the origin of Heraldry and even on  the antiquity of separate charges contained in an escutcheon: it would  be filling the pages of an elementary work on Heraldry to little  purpose to enter upon an inquiry as to the exact period of the  introduction of an art that has existed in some degree in all  countries whose inhabitants have emerged from barbarism to  civilization. In all ages men have made use of figures of living  creatures, trees, flowers, and inanimate objects, as symbolical signs  to distinguish themselves in war, or denote the bravery and courage of  their chief or nation.    The allegorical designs emblazoned on the standards, shields, and  armour of the Greeks and Romans--the White Horse of the Saxons, the  Raven of the Danes, and the Lion of the Normans, may all be termed  heraldic devices; but according to the opinions of Camden, Spelman,  and other high authorities, hereditary arms of families were first  introduced at the commencement of the twelfth century. When numerous  armies engaged in the expeditions to the Holy Land, consisting of the  troops of twenty different nations, they were obliged to adopt some  ensign or mark in order to marshal the vassals under the banners  of the various leaders. The regulation of the symbols whereby the  Sovereigns and Lords of Europe should be distinguished, all of whom  were ardent in maintaining the honour of the several nations to which  they belonged, was a matter of great nicety, and it was properly  entrusted to the Heralds who invented signs of honour which could not  be construed into offence, and made general regulations for their  display on the banners and shields of the chiefs of the different  nations. The ornaments and regulations were sanctioned by the  sovereigns engaged in the Crusade, and hence the origin of the present  system of Heraldry, which prevails with trifling variations in every  kingdom of Europe.    The passion for military fame which prevailed at this period led to  the introduction of mock battles, called Tournaments. Here the Knights  appeared with the Heraldic honours conferred upon them for deeds of  prowess in actual battle. All were emulous of such distinctions. The  subordinate followers appeared with the distinctive arms of their  Lord, with the addition of some mark denoting inferiority. These marks  of honour at first were merely pieces of stuff of various colours cut  into strips and sewn on the surcoat or garment worn over armour, to  protect it from the effect of exposure to the atmosphere. These strips  were disposed in various ways, and gave the idea of the chief, bend,  chevron, &c. Figures of animals and other objects were gradually  introduced; and as none could legally claim or use those honourable  distinctions unless they were granted by the Kings of Arms, those  Heraldic sovereigns formed a code of laws for the regulation of titles  and insignia of honour, which the Sovereigns and Knights of Europe  have bound themselves to protect; and those rules constitute the  science of Heraldry which forms the subject of the following pages.          CHAP. II.    VARIOUS SORTS OF ARMS.      Arms are not only granted to individuals and families, but also to  cities, corporate bodies, and learned societies. They may therefore be  classed as follows:--    Arms of DOMINION, PRETENSION, CONCESSION. COMMUNITY, PATRONAGE,  FAMILY. ALLIANCE, AND SUCCESSION.    _Arms of Dominion or Sovereignty_ are properly the arms of the kings  or sovereigns of the territories they govern, which are also regarded  as the arms of the State. Thus the Lions of England and the Russian  Eagle are the arms of the Kings of England and the Emperors of Russia,  and cannot properly be altered by a change of dynasty.    _Arms of Pretension_ are those of kingdoms, provinces, or territories  to which a prince or lord has some claim, and which he adds to his  own, though the kingdoms or territories are governed by a foreign king  or lord: thus the Kings of England for many ages quartered the arms  of France in their escutcheon as the descendants of Edward III., who  claimed that kingdom, in right of his mother, a French princess.    _Arms of Concession_ are arms granted by sovereigns as the reward of  virtue, valour, or extraordinary service. All arms granted to subjects  were originally conceded by the Sovereign.    _Arms of Community_ are those of bishoprics, cities, universities,  academies, societies, and corporate bodies.    _Arms of Patronage_ are such as governors of provinces, lords of  manors, &c., add to their family arms as a token of their superiority,  right, and jurisdiction.    _Arms of Family_, or paternal arms, are such as are hereditary and  belong to one particular family, which none others have a right to  assume, nor can they do so without rendering themselves guilty of a  breach of the laws of honour punishable by the Earl Marshal and the  Kings at Arms. The assumption of arms has however become so common  that little notice is taken of it at the present time.    _Arms of Alliance_ are those gained by marriage.    _Arms of Succession_ are such as are taken up by those who inherit  certain estates by bequest, entail, or donation.      SHIELDS, TINCTURES, FURS, &c.    The _Shield_ contains the field or ground whereon are represented the  charges or figures that form a coat of arms. These were painted on the  shield before they were placed on banners, standards, and coat armour;  and wherever they appear at the present time they are painted on a  plane or superficies resembling a shield.    [Illustration: Escutcheon]    [Illustration: Lozenge]    Shields in Heraldic language are called Escutcheons or Scutcheons,  from the Latin word _scutum_. The forms of the shield or field upon  which arms are emblazoned are varied according to the taste of the  painter. The Norman pointed shield is generally used in Heraldic  paintings in ecclesiastical buildings: the escutcheons of maiden  ladies and widows are painted on a lozenge-shaped shield. Armorists  distinguish several points in the escutcheon in order to determine  exactly the position of the bearings or charges. They are denoted in  the annexed diagram, by the first nine letters of the alphabet ranged  in the following manner:    [Illustration]      |-----------------|  |  A     B     C  |          A, the dexter chief.  |                 |          B, the precise middle chief.  |        D        |          C, the sinister chief.  |                 |          D, the honour point.  |        E        |          E, the fess point.  |                 |          F, the nombril point.  |        F        |          G, the dexter base.  |                 |          H, the precise middle base.  |  G     H     I  |          I, the sinister base.   \\               /     \\ --------- /        The dexter side of the escutcheon answers to the left hand, and the  sinister side to the right hand of the person that looks at it.      TINCTURES.    By the term _Tincture_ is meant that variable hue which is given to  shields and their bearings; they are divided into colours and furs.    The colours or metals used in emblazoning arms are--      yellow,    white,    red,    blue,    black,    green,    purple,    orange,    murrey.      These colours are denoted in engravings by various lines or dots, as  follows:    [Illustration: OR]    OR, which signifies _gold_, and in colour yellow, is expressed by  dots.    [Illustration: ARGENT]    ARGENT signifies _silver_ or _white_: it is left quite plain.    [Illustration: GULES]    GULES signifies _red_: it is expressed by lines drawn from the chief  to the base of the shield.    [Illustration: AZURE]    AZURE signifies _blue_: it is represented by lines drawn from the  dexter to the sinister side of the shield, parallel to the chief.    [Illustration: VERT]    VERT signifies _green_: it is represented by slanting lines, drawn  from the dexter to the sinister side of the shield.    [Illustration: PURPURE]    PURPURE, or _purple_, is expressed by diagonal lines, drawn from the  sinister to the dexter side of the shield.    [Illustration: SABLE]    SABLE, or _black_, is expressed by horizontal and perpendicular  lines crossing each other.    [Illustration: TENNE]    TENNE, which is _tawny_, or _orange_ colour, is marked by diagonal  lines drawn from the sinister to the dexter side of the shield,  traversed by perpendicular lines from the chief.    [Illustration: SANGUINE]    SANGUINE is _dark red_, or _murrey_ colour; it is represented by  diagonal lines crossing each other.    In addition to the foregoing tinctures, there are nine roundlets or  balls used in Armory, the names of which are sufficient to denote  their colour without expressing the same.

H. ELLIS CO. (INC.) BOSTON#      PREFACE.    In 1892 I was asked by the Harvard Corporation to give a few public  lectures on psychology to the Cambridge teachers. The talks now printed  form the substance of that course, which has since then been delivered  at various places to various teacher-audiences. I have found by  experience that what my hearers seem least to relish is analytical  technicality, and what they most care for is concrete practical  application. So I have gradually weeded out the former, and left the  latter unreduced; and now, that I have at last written out the lectures,  they contain a minimum of what is deemed 'scientific' in psychology, and  are practical and popular in the extreme.    Some of my colleagues may possibly shake their heads at this; but in  taking my cue from what has seemed to me to be the feeling of the  audiences I believe that I am shaping my book so as to satisfy the more  genuine public need.    Teachers, of course, will miss the minute divisions, subdivisions, and  definitions, the lettered and numbered headings, the variations of type,  and all the other mechanical artifices on which they are accustomed to  prop their minds. But my main desire has been to make them conceive,  and, if possible, reproduce sympathetically in their imagination, the  mental life of their pupil as the sort of active unity which he himself  feels it to be. _He_ doesn't chop himself into distinct processes and  compartments; and it would have frustrated this deeper purpose of my  book to make it look, when printed, like a Baedeker's handbook of travel  or a text-book of arithmetic. So far as books printed like this book  force the fluidity of the facts upon the young teacher's attention, so  far I am sure they tend to do his intellect a service, even though they  may leave unsatisfied a craving (not altogether without its legitimate  grounds) for more nomenclature, head-lines, and subdivisions.    Readers acquainted with my larger books on Psychology will meet much  familiar phraseology. In the chapters on habit and memory I have even  copied several pages verbatim, but I do not know that apology is needed  for such plagiarism as this.    The talks to students, which conclude the volume, were written in  response to invitations to deliver 'addresses' to students at women's  colleges. The first one was to the graduating class of the Boston Normal  School of Gymnastics. Properly, it continues the series of talks to  teachers. The second and the third address belong together, and continue  another line of thought.    I wish I were able to make the second, 'On a Certain Blindness in Human  Beings,' more impressive. It is more than the mere piece of  sentimentalism which it may seem to some readers. It connects itself  with a definite view of the world and of our moral relations to the  same. Those who have done me the honor of reading my volume of  philosophic essays will recognize that I mean the pluralistic or  individualistic philosophy. According to that philosophy, the truth is  too great for any one actual mind, even though that mind be dubbed 'the  Absolute,' to know the whole of it. The facts and worths of life need  many cognizers to take them in. There is no point of view absolutely  public and universal. Private and uncommunicable perceptions always  remain over, and the worst of it is that those who look for them from  the outside never know _where_.    The practical consequence of such a philosophy is the well-known  democratic respect for the sacredness of individuality,--is, at any  rate, the outward tolerance of whatever is not itself intolerant. These  phrases are so familiar that they sound now rather dead in our ears.  Once they had a passionate inner meaning. Such a passionate inner  meaning they may easily acquire again if the pretension of our nation  to inflict its own inner ideals and institutions _vi et armis_ upon  Orientals should meet with a resistance as obdurate as so far it has  been gallant and spirited. Religiously and philosophically, our ancient  national doctrine of live and let live may prove to have a far deeper  meaning than our people now seem to imagine it to possess.
