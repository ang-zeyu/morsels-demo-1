BY SIR ALFRED C. LYALL.      The volume into which Mr. Valentine Chirol has collected and republished  his valuable series of articles in _The Times_ upon Indian unrest is an  important and very instructive contribution to the study of what is  probably the most arduous problem in the politics of our far-reaching  Empire. His comprehensive survey of the whole situation, the arrangement  of evidence and array of facts, are not unlike what might have been  found in the Report of a Commission appointed to investigate the causes  and the state of affairs to which the troubles that have arisen in India  may be ascribed.    At different times in the world's history the nations foremost in  civilization have undertaken the enterprise of founding a great European  dominion in Asia, and have accomplished it with signal success. The  Macedonian Greeks led the way; they were followed by the Romans; and in  both instances their military superiority and organizing genius enabled  them to subdue and govern for centuries vast populations in Western  Asia. European science and literature flourished in the great cities of  the East, where the educated classes willingly accepted and supported  foreign rulership as their barrier against a relapse into barbarism; nor  have we reason for believing that it excited unusual discontent or  disaffection among the Asiatic peoples. But the Greek and Roman Empires  in Asia have disappeared long ago, leaving very little beyond scattered  ruins; and in modern times it is the British dominion in India that has  revived and is pursuing the enterprise of ruling and civilizing a great  Asiatic population, of developing the political intelligence and  transforming the ideas of an antique and, in some respects, a primitive  society.    That the task must be one of prodigious difficulty, not always free from  danger, has been long known to those who watched the experiment with  some accurate foresight of the conditions attending it. Yet the recent  symptoms of virulent disease in some parts of the body politic, though  confined to certain provinces of India, have taken the British nation by  surprise. Mr. Chirol's book has now exhibited the present state and  prospect of the adventure; he has examined the causes and the  consequences of the prevailing unrest; he has collected ample evidence,  and he has consulted all the best authorities, Indian and European, on  the subject. His masterly analysis of all this material shows wide  acquaintance with the facts, and rare insight into the character and  motives, the aims and methods, of those who are engaged in stirring up  the spirit of revolt against the British Government. He has pointed to  instances where the best intentions of the administrators have led them  wrong; his whole narrative illustrates the perils that beset a  Government necessarily pledged to moral and material reform, which finds  its own principles perverted against its efforts, and its foremost  opponents among the class that has been the first to profit by the  benefits which that Government has conferred upon them.    The nineteenth century had been pre-eminently an era of the development  of rapid and easy communication between distant parts of the world,  particularly between Europe and Asia. So long as these two continents  remained far apart the condition of Asia was unchanged and stationary;  if there was any change it had been latterly retrogressive, for in  India at any rate the eighteenth century was a period of abnormal and  extensive political confusion. In Europe, on the other hand, national  wealth, scientific discoveries, the arts of war and peace, had made  extraordinary progress. Population had increased and multiplied; and  partly by territorial conquests, partly by pacific penetration, the  Western nations overflowed politically into Asia during the nineteenth  century. They brought with them larger knowledge, novel ideas and  manners, which have opened the Asiatic mind to new influences and  aspirations, to the sense of needs and grievances not previously felt or  even imagined. The effect, as can now be clearly perceived, has been to  produce an abrupt transition from old to new ways, from the antique  order of society towards fresh models; and to this may be ascribed the  general unsettlement, the uneasy stir, that pervade Asia at the present  moment. Its equilibrium has been disturbed by the high speed at which  Europe has been pushing eastward; and the principal points of contact  and penetration are in India.    Moreover, towards the latter end of the nineteenth century and in the  first years of the present century came events which materially altered  the attitude of Asiatic nations towards European predominance. The  defeat of the Italians by the Abyssinians in 1896 may indeed be noted as  the first decisive victory gained by troops that may be reckoned  Oriental over a European army in the open field, for at least three  centuries. The Japanese war, in which Russia lost battles not only by  land, but also at sea, was even a more significant and striking warning  that the era of facile victories in Asia had ended; since never before  in all history had an Asiatic navy won a great sea-fight against  European fleets. That the unquiet spirit, which from these general  causes has been spreading over the Eastern Continent, should be  particularly manifest in countries under European Governments is not  unnatural; it inevitably roused the latent dislike of foreign rule,  with which a whole people is never entirely content. Precisely similar  symptoms are to be observed in the Asiatic possessions of France, and in  Egypt; nor is Algeria yet altogether reconciled to the _regime_ of its  conquerors.    That in India the British Government has found the centres of active  disaffection located in the Maratha country and in Lower Bengal, is a  phenomenon which can be to a large extent accounted for by reference to  Anglo-Indian history. The fact that Poona is one focus of sedition has  been attributed in this volume to the survival among the Maratha  Brahmins of the recollection that \"far into the eighteenth century Poona  was the capital of a theocratic State in which behind the Throne of the  Peshwas both spiritual and secular authority were concentrated in the  hands of the Brahmins.\" The Peshwas, as their title implies, had been  hereditary Ministers who governed in the name of the reigning dynasty  founded by the famous Maratha leader Sivajee, whose successors they set  aside. But before the end of the eighteenth century the secular  authority of the Peshwas had become almost nominal, and the real power  in the State had passed into the grasp of a confederation of chiefs of  predatory armies, whose violence drove the last Peshwa, more than a  century ago, to seek refuge in a British camp. The political sovereignty  of the Brahmins had disappeared from the time when he placed himself  under British protection; and the Maratha chiefs (who were not Brahmins)  only acknowledged our supremacy after some fiercely contested battles;  with the result that they were confined to and confirmed in the  possession of the territories now governed by their descendants. But it  is quite true that to the memory of a time when for once, and once only,  in Indian history, their caste established a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16459"],[0,"Musical Memories (#1)"],[1,"Team at https://www.pgdp.net            [Illustration: The Master, Camille Saint-Saens]          MUSICAL MEMORIES    BY  CAMILLE SAINT-SAENS    TRANSLATED BY  EDWIN GILE RICH  Translator of Lafond's \"_Ma Mitrailleuse_,\" etc.    [Illustration: (A publisher's seal, inscribed \"SCIRE QVOD SCIENDVM\".)]    BOSTON  SMALL, MAYNARD & COMPANY    PUBLISHERS          1919,  BY SMALL, MAYNARD & COMPANY  (INCORPORATED)          CONTENTS    CHAPTER      I  MEMORIES OF MY CHILDHOOD       II  THE OLD CONSERVATOIRE      III  VICTOR HUGO       IV  THE HISTORY OF AN OPERA-COMIQUE        V  LOUIS GALLET       VI  HISTORY AND MYTHOLOGY IN OPERA      VII  ART FOR ART'S SAKE     VIII  POPULAR SCIENCE AND ART       IX  ANARCHY IN MUSIC        X  THE ORGAN       XI  JOSEPH HAYDN AND THE \"SEVEN WORDS\"      XII  THE LISZT CENTENARY AT HEIDELBERG (1912)     XIII  BERLIOZ'S REQUIEM      XIV  PAULINE VIARDOT       XV  ORPHEE      XVI  DELSARTE     XVII  SEGHERS    XVIII  ROSSINI      XIX  JULES MASSENET       XX  MEYERBEER      XXI  JACQUES OFFENBACH     XXII  THEIR MAJESTIES    XXIII  MUSICAL PAINTERS          ILLUSTRATIONS    The Master, Camille Saint-Saens    The Paris Opera    The First Performance of _Dejanire_    M.

The latter came from an old family of  lawyers named Gayard and this relationship makes me a descendant of  General Delcambre, one of the heroes of the retreat from Russia. His  granddaughter married Count Durrieu of the _Academie des Inscriptions et  Belles-Lettres_. My great-aunt was born in the provinces in 1781, but  she was adopted by a childless aunt and uncle who made their home in  Paris. He was a wealthy lawyer and they lived magnificently.    My great-aunt was a precocious child--she walked at nine months--and  she became a woman of keen intellect and brilliant attainments. She  remembered perfectly the customs of the _Ancien Regime_, and she enjoyed  telling about them, as well as about the Revolution, the Reign of  Terror, and the times that followed. Her family was ruined by the  Revolution and the slight, frail, young girl undertook to earn her  living by giving lessons in French, on the pianoforte--the instrument  was a novelty then--in singing, painting, embroidery, in fact in  everything she knew and in much that she did not. If she did not know,  she learned then and there so that she could teach. Afterwards, she  married one of her cousins. As she had no children of her own, she  brought one of her nieces from Champagne and adopted her. This niece was  my mother, Clemence Collin. The Massons were about to retire from  business with a comfortable fortune, when they lost practically  everything within two weeks, in a panic, saving just enough to live  decently. Shortly after this my mother married my father, a minor  official in the Department of the Interior. My great-uncle died of a  broken heart some months before my birth on October 9, 1835. My father  died of consumption on the thirty-first of the following December, just  a year to a day after his marriage.    Thus the two women were both left widows, poorly provided for, weighed  down by sad memories, and with the care of a delicate child. In fact I  was so delicate that the doctors held out little hope of my living, and  on their advice I was left in the country with my nurse until I was two  years old.    While my aunt had had a remarkable education, my mother had not been so  widely taught. But she made up for any lack by the display of an  imagination and an eager power of assimilation which bordered on the  miraculous. She often told me about an uncle who was very fond of  her--he had been ruined in the cause of Philippe Egalite. This uncle was  an artist, but he was, nevertheless, passionately fond of music. He had  even built with his own hands a concert organ on which he used to play.  My mother used to sit between his knees and, while he amused himself by  running his fingers through her splendid black hair, he would talk to  her about art, music, painting--beauty in every form. So she got it into  her head that if she ever had sons of her own, the first should be a  musician, the second a painter, and the third a sculptor. As a result,  when I came home from the nurse, she was not greatly surprised that I  began to listen to every noise and to every sound; that I made the doors  creak, and would plant myself in front of the clocks to hear them  strike. My special delight was the music of the tea-kettle--a large one  which was hung before the fire in the drawing-room every morning. Seated  nearby on a small stool, I used to wait with a lively curiosity for the  first murmurs of its gentle and variegated _crescendo_, and the  appearance of a microscopic oboe which gradually increased its song  until it was silenced by the kettle boiling. Berlioz must have heard  that oboe as well as I, for I rediscovered it in the \"Ride to Hell\" in  his _La Damnation de Faust_.    At the same time I was learning to read. When I was two-years-and-a-half  old, they placed me in front of a small piano which had not been opened  for several years. Instead of drumming at random as most children of  that age would have done, I struck the notes one after another, going on  only when the sound of the previous note had died away. My great-aunt  taught me the names of the notes and got a tuner to put the piano in  order. While the tuning was going on, I was playing in the next room,  and they were utterly astonished when I named the notes as they were  sounded. I was not told all these details--I remember them perfectly.    I was taught by Le Carpentier's method and I finished it in a month.  They couldn't let a little monkey like that work away at the piano, and  I cried like a lost soul when they closed the instrument. Then they left  it open and put a small stool in front of it. From time to time I would  leave my playthings and climb up to drum out whatever came into my head.  Gradually, my great-aunt, who fortunately had an excellent foundation in  music, taught me how to hold my hands properly so that I did not acquire  the gross faults which are so difficult to correct later on. But they  did not know what sort of music to give me. That written especially for  children is, as a rule, entirely melody and the part for the left hand  is uninteresting. I refused to learn it. \"The bass doesn't sing,\" I  said, in disgust.    Then they searched the old masters, in Haydn and Mozart, for things  sufficiently easy for me to handle. At five I was playing small sonatas  correctly, with good interpretation and excellent precision. But I  consented to play them only before listeners capable of appreciating  them. I have read in a biographical sketch that I was threatened with  whippings to make me play. That is absolutely false; but it was  necessary to tell me that there was a lady in the audience who was an  excellent musician and had fastidious tastes. I would not play for those  who did not know.    As for the threat of whippings, that must be relegated to the realm of  legends with the one that Garcia punished his daughters to make them  learn to sing. Madame Viardot expressly told me that neither she nor her  sister was abused by their father and that they learned music without  realizing it, just as they learned to talk.    But in spite of my surprising progress my teacher did not foresee what  my future was to be. \"When he is fifteen,\" she said, \"if he can write a  dance, I shall be satisfied.\" It was just at this time, however, that I  began to write music. I wrote waltzes and galops--the galop was  fashionable at that period; it ran to rather ordinary musical motives  and mine were no exception to the rule. Liszt had to show by his _Galop  Chromatique_ the distinction that genius can give to the most  commonplace themes. My waltzes were better. As has always been the case  with me, I was already composing the music directly on paper without  working it out on the piano. The waltzes were too difficult for my  hands, so a friend of the family, a sister of the singer Geraldy, was  kind enough to play them for me.    I have looked over these little compositions lately. They are  insignificant, but it is impossible to find a technical error in them.  Such precision was remarkable for a child who had no idea of the science  of harmony. About that time some one had the notion that I should hear  an orchestra. So they took me to a symphony concert and my mother held  me in her arms near the door. Until then I had only heard single violins  and their tone had not pleased me. But the impression of the orchestra  was entirely different and I listened with delight to a passage played  by a quartet, when, suddenly, came a blast from the brass  instruments--the trumpets, trombones and cymbals. I broke into loud  cries, \"Make them stop. They prevent my hearing the music.\" They had to  take me out.    When I was seven, I passed out of my great-aunt's hands into Stamaty's.  He was surprised at the way my education in music had been directed and  he expressed this in a small work in which he discussed the necessity of  making a correct start. In my case, he said, there was nothing to do but  to perfect.    Stamaty was Kalkbrenner's best pupil and the propagator of the method he  had invented. This method was based on the _guide main_, so I was put to  work on it. The preface to Kalkbrenner's method, in which he"]]]
