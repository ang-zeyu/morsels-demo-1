Continued by a Narrative of His Last Moments and Sufferings,  Obtained from His Faithful Servants Chuma and Susi,    by    HORACE WALLER, F.R.G.S.,  Rector Of Twywell, Northampton.    IN TWO VOLUMES.--VOL. I.  [1866-1868]    With Portrait, Maps, and Illustrations.    London:  John Murray, Albemarle Street.    1874                INTRODUCTION.      In the midst of the universal sorrow caused by the intelligence that  Dr. Livingstone had lost his life at the furthest point to which he  had penetrated in his search for the true sources of the Nile, a faint  hope was indulged that some of his journals might survive the  disaster: this hope, I rejoice to say, has been realized beyond the  most sanguine expectations.    It is due, in the first place, to his native attendants, whose  faithfulness has placed his last writings at our disposal, and also to  the reader, before he launches forth upon a series of travels and  scientific geographical records of the most extraordinary character,  to say that in the following narrative of seven years' continuous work  and new discovery _no break whatever occurs_.    We have not to deplore the loss, by accident or carelessness, of a  single entry, from the time of Livingstone's departure from Zanzibar  in the beginning of 1866 to the day when his note-book dropped from  his hand in the village of Ilala at the end of April, 1873.    I trust it will not be uninteresting if I preface the history with a  few words on the nature of these journals and writings as they have  come to hand from Central Africa.    It will be remembered that when Mr. Stanley returned to England in  1872, Dr. Livingstone entrusted to his care a very large Letts' diary,  sealed up and consigned to the safe keeping of his daughter, Miss  Agnes Livingstone. Upon the confirmation of the worst news, this book  was examined and found to contain a considerable portion of the notes  which her father made during his travels previous to the time of Mr.  Stanley's meeting him.    The Doctor's custom was always to have metallic note-books in use, in  which the day's jottings were recorded. When time and opportunity  served, the larger volume was posted up with scrupulous care.    It seems, however, that in the last three or four years of his life  this excellent rule had to give way to the toils of travel and the  exhaustion of most distressing illnesses. Whilst in the Manyuema  country he ran out of note-books, ink, and pencils, and had to resort  to shifts which at first made it a very debateable point whether the  most diligent attempt at deciphering would suceeed after all. Such  pocket-books as remained at this period of his travels were utilized  to the last inch of paper. In some of them we find lunar observations,  the names of rivers, and the heights of hills advancing towards the  middle from one end, whilst from the other the itinerary grows day by  day, interspersed with map routes of the march, botanical notes, and  carefully made drawings. But in the mean time the middle portion of  the book was filling up with calculations, private memoranda, words  intended for vocabularies, and extracts from books, whilst here and  there the stain of a pressed flower causes indistinctness; yet the  thread of the narrative runs throughout. Noting but his invariable  habit of constantly repeating the month and year obviates hopeless  confusion. Nor is this all; for pocket-books gave out at last, and old  newspapers, yellow with African damp, were sewn together, and his  notes were written across the type with a substitute for ink made from  the juice of a tree. To Miss Livingstone and to the Rev. C.A. Alington  I am very much indebted for help in the laborious task of deciphering  this portion of the Doctor's journals. Their knowledge of his  handwriting, their perseverance, coupled with good eyes and a strong  magnifying-glass, at last made their task a complete success.    In comparing this great mass of material with the journal brought  home by Mr. Stanley, one finds that a great deal of most interesting  matter can be added. It would seem that in the hurry of writing and  copying despatches previous to his companion's departure, the Doctor  rapidly entered up as much from his note-books as time and space  permitted.    Most fortunately, he still carried the greater part of these original  notes till the time of his death, so that they were forthcoming when  his effects were subsequently saved.    This brings us to the second instalment of the journals, for we have  thus acknowledged the first to have reached us on Mr. Stanley's  return.    When the battered tin travelling-case, which was with Livingstone to  the last, was opened at the Foreign Office in the spring of this year,  not only were these valuable papers disclosed which I have mentioned,  but it was found also that Livingstone had kept a copious journal  during his stay at Unyanyembe in some copy-books, and that when his  stock of note-books was replenished a daily record of his subsequent  travels had been made.    It was with fear and trembling that one looked to see whether all had  been saved or only part, but with satisfaction and thankfulness I have  subsequently discovered that his men preserved every single line,  besides his maps, which now come to light for the first time.    Thus much on the material of the diaries: it remains to say a few  words on the Map which accompanies these journals. It has been  compiled from Dr. Livingstone's original drawings and note-books, with  the corrections and additions he made from time to time as the work of  exploration progressed, and the details of physical geography became  clearer to him. The compiler, Mr. John Bolton[1], implicitly  following the original outline of the drawing as far as possible, has  honestly endeavoured to give such a rendering of the entire work, as  the Doctor would have done had he lived to return home, and  superintend the construction; and I take this opportunity of  expressing my sincere gratification that Mr. Bolton's rare technical  skill, scientific knowledge, and unwearying labour have been available  for the purpose.    Amongst almost the last words that Livingstone wrote, I find an  unfinished letter to myself, in which he gives me very clear and  explicit directions concerning the geographical notes he had  previously sent home, and I am but carrying out the sacred duty which  is attached to a last wish when I call attention to the fact, that he  particularly desired in this letter that _no positions gathered from  his observations for latitude and longitude, nor for the levels of the  Lakes, &c., should be considered correct till Sir Thomas Maclear had  examined them_. The position of Casembe's town, and of a point near  Pambette at the S.E., and of Lake Liemba (Tanganyika), have been  computed and corrected by Sir T. Maclear and Dr. Mann. The  observations for latitude were taken at short intervals, and where it  has been possible to test them they have been found very correct, but  I repeat that until the imprimatur of his old friend at the Cape of  Good Hope stands over the whole of Livingstone's work, the map must be  accepted as open to further corrections.    The journey from Kabwabwata to Mparru has been inserted _entirely_  from notes, as the traveller was too ill to mark the route: this is  the only instance in all his wanderings where he failed to give some  indication on his map of the nature of the ground over which he  passed. The journey front Mikindany Bay to Lake Nyassa has also been  laid down from his journal and latitudes in consequence of the section  of this part of his route (which he left at Ujiji) not having arrived  in England at this date.[2] It will be observed that the outline of  Lake Nyassa differs from that on any published map: it has been drawn  from the original exploratory survey of its southern shores made by  Dr. Livingstone in 1861-3. For some reason this original plan was not  adhered to by a former draughtsman, but the Lake has here been  restored to a more accurate bearing and position.    How often shall we see in the pages of this concluding chapter of his  life, that unwavering determination which was pre-eminently the great  characteristic of David Livingstone!    Naturally endowed with unusual endurance, able to concentrate  faculties of no ordinary kind upon whatever he took in hand, and with  a dread of exaggeration which at times almost militated against the  importance of some of his greatest discoveries, it may be doubted if  ever Geographer went forth strengthened with so much true power. Let  us add to these a sincere trust that slavery, the \"great open sore of  the world,\" as he called it, might under God's good guidance receive  healing at his hands; a fervent hope that others would follow him  after he had removed those difficulties which are comprised in a  profound ignorance of the physical features of a new country, and we  have the marching orders of him who left us in August 1865 never to  return alive.    Privileged to enjoy his near personal friendship for a considerable  period in Africa, and also at home, it has been easy to trace--more  especially from correspondence with him of late years--that  Livingstone wanted just some such gigantic problem as that which he  attacked at the last to measure his strength against: that he finally  overrated and overtaxed it I think all must admit.    He had not sufficiently allowed for an old wound which his  constitution received whilst battling with dysentery and fever, on "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16679"],[0,"The History of England (#1)"],[1,"Distributed Proofreading Team at https://www.pgdp.net              THE HISTORY OF ENGLAND    FROM THE ACCESSION OF HENRY III. TO THE DEATH OF EDWARD III.  (1216-1377)    BY  T.F. TOUT, M.A.  Professor of Mediaeval and Modern History  in the University of Manchester.          THE POLITICAL HISTORY OF ENGLAND IN TWELVE VOLUMES    Seventy-six years have passed since Lingard completed his HISTORY OF  ENGLAND, which ends with the Revolution of 1688. During that period  historical study has made a great advance. Year after year the mass of  materials for a new History of England has increased; new lights have  been thrown on events and characters, and old errors have been  corrected. Many notable works have been written on various periods of  our history; some of them at such length as to appeal almost  exclusively to professed historical students. It is believed that the  time has come when the advance which has been made in the knowledge of  English history as a whole should be laid before the public in a single  work of fairly adequate size. Such a book should be founded on  independent thought and research, but should at the same time be  written with a full knowledge of the works of the best modern  historians and with a desire to take advantage of their teaching  wherever it appears sound.    The vast number of authorities, printed and in manuscript, on which a  History of England should be based, if it is to represent the existing  state of knowledge, renders co-operation almost necessary and certainly  advisable. The History, of which this volume is an instalment, is an  attempt to set forth in a readable form the results at present attained  by research. It will consist of twelve volumes by twelve different  writers, each of them chosen as being specialty capable of dealing with  the period which he undertakes, and the editors, while leaving to each  author as free a hand as possible, hope to insure a general similarity  in method of treatment, so that the twelve volumes may in their  contents, as well as in their outward appearance, form one History.    As its title imports, this History will primarily deal with politics,  with the History of England and, after the date of the union with  Scotland, Great Britain, as a state or body politic; but as the life of  a nation is complex, and its condition at any given time cannot be  understood without taking into account the various forces acting upon  it, notices of religious matters and of intellectual, social, and  economic progress will also find place in these volumes. The footnotes  will, so far as is possible, be confined to references to authorities,  and references will not be appended to statements which appear to be  matters of common knowledge and do not call for support. Each volume  will have an Appendix giving some account of the chief authorities,  original and secondary, which the author has used. This account will be  compiled with a view of helping students rather than of making long  lists of books without any notes as to their contents or value. That  the History will have faults both of its own and such as will always in  some measure attend co-operative work, must be expected, but no pains  have been spared to make it, so far as may be, not wholly unworthy of  the greatness of its subject.    Each volume, while forming part of a complete History, will also in  itself be a separate and complete book, will be sold separately, and  will have its own index, and two or more maps.
