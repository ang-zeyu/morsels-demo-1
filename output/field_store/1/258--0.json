And the compositors of all our higher-toned newspapers keep  the foregoing sentence set up in type always, so constantly does it  come tripping off the pens of all higher-toned reviewers. Nor ever do  I read it without a fresh thrill of respect for the young Stevenson.  I, in my own very inferior boyhood, found it hard to revel in so much  as a single page of any writer earlier than Thackeray. This disability  I did not shake off, alas, after I left school. There seemed to be  so many live authors worth reading. I gave precedence to them, and,  not being much of a reader, never had time to grapple with the old  masters. Meanwhile, I was already writing a little on my own account.  I had had some sort of aptitude for Latin prose and Latin verse. I  wondered often whether those two things, essential though they were  (and are) to the making of a decent style in English prose, sufficed  for the making of a style more than decent. I felt that I must have  other models. And thus I acquired the habit of aping, now and again,  quite sedulously, this or that live writer--sometimes, it must be  admitted, in the hope of learning rather what to avoid. I acquired,  too, the habit of publishing these patient little efforts. Some of  them appeared in \"The Saturday Review\" many years ago; others appeared  there more recently. I have selected, by kind permission of the  Editor, one from the earlier lot, and seven from the later. The other  nine in this book are printed for the first time. The book itself may  be taken as a sign that I think my own style is, at length, more or  less formed._    _M.B._    _Rapallo_, 1912.

But just where the deuce _had_ he left it? The consciousness of  dubiety was, for our friend, not, this morning, quite yet clean-cut  enough to outline the figures on what she had called his \"horizon,\"  between which and himself the twilight was indeed of a quality  somewhat intimidating. He had run up, in the course of time, against  a good number of \"teasers;\" and the function of teasing them back--of,  as it were, giving them, every now and then, \"what for\"--was in him so  much a habit that he would have been at a loss had there been, on the  face of it, nothing to lose. Oh, he always had offered rewards, of  course--had ever so liberally pasted the windows of his soul with  staring appeals, minute descriptions, promises that knew no bounds.  But the actual recovery of the article--the business of drawing and  crossing the cheque, blotched though this were with tears of joy--had  blankly appeared to him rather in the light of a sacrilege, casting,  he sometimes felt, a palpable chill on the fervour of the next quest.  It was just this fervour that was threatened as, raising himself on  his elbow, he stared at the foot of his bed. That his eyes refused  to rest there for more than the fraction of an instant, may be  taken--_was_, even then, taken by Keith Tantalus--as a hint of his  recollection that after all the phenomenon wasn't to be singular. Thus  the exact repetition, at the foot of Eva's bed, of the shape pendulous  at the foot of _his_ was hardly enough to account for the fixity with  which he envisaged it, and for which he was to find, some years later,  a motive in the (as it turned out) hardly generous fear that Eva had  already made the great investigation \"on her own.\" Her very regular  breathing presently reassured him that, if she _had_ peeped into \"her\"  stocking, she must have done so in sleep. Whether he should wake her  now, or wait for their nurse to wake them both in due course, was  a problem presently solved by a new development. It was plain that  his sister was now watching him between her eyelashes. He had half  expected that. She really was--he had often told her that she really  was--magnificent; and her magnificence was never more obvious than in  the pause that elapsed before she all of a sudden remarked \"They so  very indubitably _are_, you know!\"    It occurred to him as befitting Eva's remoteness, which was a part  of Eva's magnificence, that her voice emerged somewhat muffled by the  bedclothes. She was ever, indeed, the most telephonic of her sex. In  talking to Eva you always had, as it were, your lips to the receiver.  If you didn't try to meet her fine eyes, it was that you simply  couldn't hope to: there were too many dark, too many buzzing and  bewildering and all frankly not negotiable leagues in between.  Snatches of other voices seemed often to intertrude themselves in the  parley; and your loyal effort not to overhear these was complicated by  your fear of missing what Eva might be twittering. \"Oh, you certainly  haven't, my dear, the trick of propinquity!\" was a thrust she had  once parried by saying that, in that case, _he_ hadn't--to which his  unspoken rejoinder that she had caught her tone from the peevish  young women at the Central seemed to him (if not perhaps in the last,  certainly in the last but one, analysis) to lack finality. With  Eva, he had found, it was always safest to \"ring off.\" It was with a  certain sense of his rashness in the matter, therefore, that he now,  with an air of feverishly \"holding the line,\" said \"Oh, as to that!\"    Had _she_, he presently asked himself, \"rung off\"? It was  characteristic of our friend--was indeed \"him all over\"--that his fear  of what she was going to say was as nothing to his fear of what she  might be going to leave unsaid. He had, in his converse with her, been  never so conscious as now of the intervening leagues; they had never  so insistently beaten the drum of his ear; and he caught himself in  the act of awfully computing, with a certain statistical passion, the  distance between Rome and Boston. He has never been able to decide  which of these points he was psychically the nearer to at the moment  when Eva, replying \"Well, one does, anyhow, leave a margin for the  pretext, you know!\" made him, for the first time in his life, wonder  whether she were not more magnificent than even he had ever given  her credit for being. Perhaps it was to test this theory, or perhaps  merely to gain time, that he now raised himself to his knees, and,  leaning with outstretched arm towards the foot of his bed, made as  though to touch the stocking which Santa Claus had, overnight, left  dangling there. His posture, as he stared obliquely at Eva, with  a sort of beaming defiance, recalled to him something seen in an  \"illustration.\" This reminiscence, however--if such it was, save in  the scarred, the poor dear old woebegone and so very beguilingly _not_  refractive mirror of the moment--took a peculiar twist from Eva's  behaviour. She had, with startling suddenness, sat bolt upright, and  looked to him as if she were overhearing some tragedy at the other end  of the wire, where, in the nature of things, she was unable to arrest  it. The gaze she fixed on her extravagant kinsman was of a kind to  make him wonder how he contrived to remain, as he beautifully did,  rigid. His prop was possibly the reflection that flashed on him that,  if _she_ abounded in attenuations, well, hang it all, so did _he_! It  was simply a difference of plane. Readjust the \"values,\" as painters  say, and there you were! He was to feel that he was only too crudely  \"there\" when, leaning further forward, he laid a chubby forefinger on  the stocking, causing that receptacle to rock ponderously to and fro.  This effect was more expected than the tears which started to Eva's  eyes, and the intensity with which \"Don't you,\" she exclaimed, \"see?\"    \"The mote in the middle distance?\" he asked. \"Did you ever, my dear,  know me to see anything else? I tell you it blocks out everything.  It's a cathedral, it's a herd of elephants, it's the whole habitable  globe. Oh, it's, believe me, of an obsessiveness!\" But his sense of  the one thing it _didn't_ block out from his purview enabled him  to launch at Eva a speculation as to just how far Santa Claus had,  for the particular occasion, gone. The gauge, for both of them,  of this seasonable distance seemed almost blatantly suspended in  the silhouettes of the two stockings. Over and above the basis of  (presumably) sweetmeats in the toes and heels, certain extrusions  stood for a very plenary fulfilment of desire. And, since Eva had set  her heart on a doll "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14668"],[0,"McGuffey's Second Eclectic Reader (#1)"],[1,"[Transcriber's Notes:    Welcome to the schoolroom of 1900. The moral tone is plain. \"She is kind  to the old blind man.\"    The exercises are still suitable, and perhaps more helpful than some  contemporary alternatives. Much is left to the teacher.

EP316        Preface    In this book, as well as in the others of the Revised Series, most of the  favorite drill selections, which constituted one of the leading  excellences of MCGUFFEY'S READERS, have been retained. New selections have  been inserted only when they seemed manifest improvements on those  formerly used.    The plan of this Reader is a continuation and extension of that pursued in  the First Reader.    If the pupil is not familiar with the diacritical marks, he should be  carefully drilled, as suggested on page 7, until the marked letter  instantly suggests the correct sound. He is then prepared to study his  reading lessons without any assistance from the teacher.    All new words are given at the head of each lesson. When these are  mastered, the main difficulties left for the pupil are those of  expression. In the latter portion of the book the simpler  derivatives,--such as are formed by adding one or two  letters,--possessives, plurals, verbal forms, etc.,--are omitted if the  primitive word has been given. In this way the pupil is gradually led to  the mastery of words as ordinarily printed.    A few of the most usual abbreviations have been introduced,--such as Mr.,  Mrs., etc. These should be carefully explained, not only as to their  meaning and use, but as to the reason for their use.    Great care has been taken to have the illustrations worthy of the  reputation MCGUFFEY'S READERS have attained, and some of the foremost  designers of this country have contributed to the embellishment of the  book.    Many of these pictures will serve admirably for lessons in language, in  extension and explanation of the text. The imagination of the artist has,  in some cases, filled in details not found in the text.    The thanks of the publishers are due to very many experienced teachers,  who have contributed their valuable suggestions.    June, 1879.          INTRODUCTORY MATTER.

SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS.-Thorough and frequent drills on the elementary  sounds are useful in correcting vicious habits of pronunciation and in  strengthening the vocal organs.    As a rule, only one or two sounds should be employed at one lesson. Care  should be taken that the pupils observe and practice these sounds  correctly in their reading.        TABLE OF VOCALS.

Punctuation Marks are used to make the sense more clear.    A Period (.) is used at the end of a sentence, and after an  abbreviation; as,       James was quite sick. Dr. Jones was called to see him.    An Interrogation Mark (?) is used at the end of a question; as,       Where is John going?    An Exclamation Mark (!) is used after words or sentences expressing some  strong feeling; as,       Alas, my noble boy! that thou shouldst die!    The Comma (,), Semicolon (;), and Colon (:) are used to separate the parts  of a sentence.    The Hyphen (-) is used to join the parts of a compound word; as,  text-book: it is also used at the end of a line in print or script, when a  word is divided; as in the word \"sentence,\" near the bottom of page 9.
