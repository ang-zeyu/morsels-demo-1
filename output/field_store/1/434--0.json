For some years past a lack of competent men in the profession of Piano  Tuning has been generally acknowledged. This may be accounted for as  follows: The immense popularity of the piano and the assiduous efforts  of factories and salesmen have led to the result that nearly every  well-to-do household is furnished with an instrument. To supply this  demand the annual production and sale for the year 1906 is estimated  at three hundred thousand pianos in the United States. These pianos  must be tuned many times in the factory before they are shipped to the  salesroom; there they must be kept in tune until sold. When, finally,  they take up their permanent abode in the homes of the purchasers,  they should be given the attention of the tuner at least twice a year.  This means work for the tuner. But this is not all. Presuming that the  average life of the piano is about fifty years, it is evident that  there exists in this country an accumulation of instruments variously  estimated at from four to five millions. This means _more work for  tuners_.    While production and accumulation have been increasing, there has been  little, if any, effort made to provide tuners to look after the needs  of this ever-increasing number of instruments, no provision for the  thorough instruction of the learner of Piano Tuning, outside the walls  of the factories, and of the few musical colleges where the art is  taught. Doubtless there are many persons who are by nature well  adapted to this agreeable and profitable occupation--persons who would  make earnest effort to acquire the necessary skill and its honest  application if they had a favorable opportunity. Musical colleges in  which tuning is taught are few and far between; piano factories are  built for the purpose of producing pianos and not tuners, for  mechanics and laborers and not for teachers and pupils; furthermore,  very little fine tuning is done in the factory; rough tuning is the  bulk of the work there, and a long apprenticeship in the factory, with  its meager advantages, is rarely sufficient to meet the demands of the  would-be-thorough tuner. This may account, in part, for the fact that  many who are incompetent are following this profession, and that  there is an increasing demand for tuners of skill.    In view of these facts the author came to the opinion that if a course  of instruction were prepared which would demonstrate clearly the many  abstruse details of the art in an interesting and comprehensible way,  it would be appreciated by those who are desirous to learn. Acting  upon this impulse, he began the preparation of such a course.    The present book is the outgrowth of a course of instruction, used  successfully with pupils from various parts of the United States and  Canada, conducted partly by correspondence; partly at the school  directed by the author. Although it has been necessary to revise the  course somewhat for publication in the present form, no essential  matter has been omitted and much has been added.    In preparing this course of study the utmost effort has been made to  present the various topics in the clearest, most comprehensive manner,  literary excellence being a secondary consideration.    While the book is designed for self-instruction, the systematic  arrangement of the text, and the review questions with each lesson,  suggest its use as a text-book for schools and colleges which give  personal training in the care of the piano.    To the talented individual of either sex who is ambitious to acquire a  dignified and profitable profession, to the scientifically-inclined  musician who is eager to learn the fundamental principles underlying  all musical harmony, and finally to the non-professional who loves to  read because of a fondness for science, the book is submitted; if it  should prove a boon to the former, a benefit to the second, or a  pleasure to the latter, I shall feel rewarded for the work of its  preparation.

Just what we are fitted for must, almost  invariably, be decided by ourselves; and the sooner the better, else  we may plod among the thousands whose lives are miserable failures for  the reason that \"they have missed their calling.\"    In the consideration of Piano Tuning as a profession, one should first  determine if he possesses the necessary qualifications, the most  important of which are a musical ear and some degree of mechanical  ability. Having these, all else may be acquired by study. It is not  necessary to possess a musical education or to be a musician; although  a knowledge of music will be found a great aid. Still, an elementary  knowledge of the principles of music is a necessity to the student of  this course, as it has been found impossible to avoid the use of a few  technical terms. In most cases, however, they are set forth in such a  way that they will be readily apprehended by anyone who has even a  slight knowledge of the fundamental principles of music.

ELLIOTT COUES, U.S.A.           117          PREFACE.      In these few pages I have tried to prepare something about camping and  walking, such as I should have enjoyed reading when I was a boy; and,  with this thought in my mind, I some years ago began to collect the  subject-matter for a book of this kind, by jotting down all questions  about camping, &c., that my young friends asked me. I have also taken  pains, when I have been off on a walk, or have been camping, to notice  the parties of campers and trampers that I have chanced to meet, and  have made a note of their failures or success. The experiences of the  pleasant days when, in my teens, I climbed the mountains of Oxford  County, or sailed through Casco Bay, have added largely to the stock of  notes; and finally the diaries of \"the war,\" and the recollections of  \"the field,\" have contributed generously; so that, with quotations, and  some help from other sources, a sizable volume is ready.    Although it is prepared for young men,--for students more especially,--it  contains much, I trust, that will prove valuable to campers-out in general.    I am under obligations to Dr. Elliott Coues, of the United States Army,  for the valuable advice contained in Chapter XIII.; and I esteem it a  piece of good fortune that his excellent work (\"Field Ornithology\")  should have been published before this effort of mine, for I hardly know  where else I could have found the information with authority so  unquestionable.    Prof. Edward S. Morse has increased the debt of gratitude I already owe  him, by taking his precious time to draw my illustrations, and prepare  them for the engraver.    Mr. J. Edward Fickett of Portland, a sailmaker, and formerly of the  navy, has assisted in the chapter upon tents; and there are numbers of  my young friends who will recognize the results of their experience, as  they read these pages, and will please to receive my thanks for making  them known to me.    PORTLAND, ME., January, 1877.          HOW TO CAMP OUT.          CHAPTER I.    GETTING READY.      The hope of camping out that comes over one in early spring, the laying  of plans and arranging of details, is, I sometimes think, even more  enjoyable than reality itself. As there is pleasure in this, let me  advise you to give a practical turn to your anticipations.    Think over and decide whether you will walk, go horseback, sail, camp  out in one place, or what you will do; then learn what you can of the  route you propose to go over, or the ground where you intend to camp for  the season. If you think of moving through or camping in places unknown  to you, it is important to learn whether you can buy provisions and get  lodgings along your route. See some one, if you can, who has been where  you think of going, and put down in a note-book all he tells you that  is important.    Have your clothes made or mended as soon as you decide what you will  need: the earlier you begin, the less you will be hurried at the last.    You will find it is a good plan, as fast as you think of a thing that  you want to take, to note it on your memorandum; and, in order to avoid  delay or haste, to cast your eyes over the list occasionally to see that  the work of preparation is going on properly. It is a good plan to  collect all of your baggage into one place as fast as it is ready; for  if it is scattered you are apt to lose sight of some of it, and start  without it.    As fast as you get your things ready, mark your name on them: mark every  thing. You can easily cut a stencil-plate out of an old postal card, and  mark with a common shoe-blacking brush such articles as tents, poles,  boxes, firkins, barrels, coverings, and bags.    Some railroads will not check barrels, bags, or bundles, nor take them  on passenger trains. Inquire beforehand, and send your baggage ahead if  the road will not take it on your train.    Estimate the expenses of your trip, and take more money than your  estimate. Carry also an abundance of small change.    Do not be in a hurry to spend money on new inventions. Every year  there is put upon the market some patent knapsack, folding stove,  cooking-utensil, or camp trunk and cot combined; and there are always  for sale patent knives, forks, and spoons all in one, drinking-cups,  folding portfolios, and marvels of tools. Let them all alone: carry your  pocket-knife, and if you can take more let it be a sheath or butcher  knife and a common case-knife.    Take iron or cheap metal spoons.    Do not attempt to carry crockery or glassware upon a march.    A common tin cup is as good as any thing you can take to drink from; and  you will find it best to carry it so that it can be used easily.[1]    Take nothing nice into camp, expecting to keep it so: it is almost  impossible to keep things out of the dirt, dew, rain, dust, or sweat,  and from being broken or bruised.    Many young men, before starting on their summer vacation, think that the  barber must give their hair a \"fighting-cut;\" but it is not best to  shave the head so closely, as it is then too much exposed to the sun,  flies, and mosquitoes. A moderately short cut to the hair, however, is  advisable for comfort and cleanliness.    If you are going to travel where you have never been before, begin early  to study your map. It is of great importance, you will find, to learn  all you can of the neighborhood where you are going, and to fix it in  your mind.    So many things must be done at the last moment, that it is best to do  what you can beforehand; but try to do nothing that may have to be  undone.    Wear what you please if it be comfortable and durable: do not mind what  people say. When you are camping you have a right to be independent.    If you are going on a walking-party, one of the best things you can do  is to \"train\" a week or more before starting, by taking long walks in  the open air.    Finally, leave your business in such shape that it will not call you  back; and do not carry off keys, &c., which others must have; nor  neglect to see the dentist about the tooth that usually aches when you  most want it to keep quiet.    For convenience the following list is inserted here. It is condensed  from a number of notes made for trips of all sorts, except boating and  horseback-riding. It is by no means exhaustive, yet there are very many  more things named than you can possibly use to advantage upon any one  tour. Be careful not to be led astray by it into overloading yourself,  or filling your camp with useless luggage. Be sure to remember this.              Ammon'd opodeldoc.
