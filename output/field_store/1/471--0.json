In reviewing the events of the last week throughout the world-wide area of  war, let  us begin with the  Dark Continent, where everything  went in our  favour--very brilliantly  so. First of  all, then, we  may now be  said to  have  completed our  conquest of  the  German Cameroon  country by  taking  possession of the whole of the railway which runs northward from Bonabari,  and is now in  the hands of our troops. A similar fate  is reserved, at no  distant date, for German South  Africa, against which General Botha--a man  no less brave  and dashing as a soldier than  sagacious as a statesman--is  preparing to  lead a  conquering force. Having  stamped out  the rebellion  within the  Union itself--crushing it  literally like a beetle--he  is now  addressing himself to  the task--a harder one, perhaps,  but still certain  of achievement--of making  an end of the bad neighbourhood  of the Germans  in  the vast  region  forming the  Hinterland of  Luederitz  Bay, which  is  already in  our possession, and  rendering it  impossible for them  in the  future to  intrigue from that quarter  against the peace and  stability of  the  Union. The  court-martialling  and prompt  execution  at Pretoria  of  the  rebel leader,  Captain Fourie,  shows  what the  Union Government  is  minded  to do  _pour decourager  les autres_.  The rebellion  was promptly  and  energetically suppressed--though  not without  a Union  loss of  334,  including  more  than  100  deaths;  while in  German  South  Africa,  the  casualties had also risen to a total of some 370. The rebels had more than  170 killed,  over 300 wounded, and  5500 prisoners--which was thus  a very  creditable bit of  work, as brilliant as it was  brief, in the rounding-up  of rebels against the unity of the Empire.    [Illustration: SPOKESMAN OF FRENCH DETERMINATION: M. VIVIANI, PREMIER OF  FRANCE.    At the opening of the French Chamber on the 22nd, M.

He has  since  been on  the War  Staff at  the  Admiralty.--[_Photo. Heath._]]    Quite  of a  piece with  the doing  of this  job in  South Africa  was the  disposal  of  another overt  enemy  against  our  authority at  the  other  extremity of the Dark Continent--in the  person of the Khedive, Abbas II.,  who has  now been replaced  by Prince Hussein  Kamel Pasha as  the nominal  Sultan of Egypt--under our protection and power. No change of the kind was  ever  brought about  with so  much  statesmanlike wisdom  and such  little  friction,  or with  so much  hearty  approval from  all sides--except,  of  course, that of the Turks and their German backers, for whom the change of  regime,  effected as  it  was by  a  simple stroke  of  Sir Edward  Grey's  masterly pen,  was a most painful  slap. The exchange of  messages between  King  George  and Prince  Hussein--one  promising  unfailing support,  and  the  other unfailing  allegiance--completed  the transaction,  one of  the  greatest triumphs of British statesmanship, compared with which the recent  statecraft of the Germans is mere  amateur bungling. Marshal von der Goltz  Pasha, who has now exchanged his  Governorship of Belgium for the position  of chief  military counsellor on the  Bosphorus, will find it  harder than  ever--with  his rabble  army under  Djemal Pasha--to  \"liberate\" from  the  British yoke the people of Egypt, who have already shown that they no more  yearn for  such emancipation than  our loyal fellow-subjects in  India. At  Constantinople  it  was given  out  that  the  _Messudiyeh_, sunk  by  one    (_Continued overleaf._)    [Illustration: GERMAN PRAISE OF THE BRITISH SOLDIER: GENERAL VON  HEERINGEN.

That the Navy  did not allow Christmas festivities to  interfere with duty  is shown by  the brilliant air-raid on Cuxhaven on  Christmas morning. The  Grand  Fleet which  keeps  its silent  watch on  the  seas, under  Admiral  Jellicoe, did not, we may be sure,  relax any of its vigilance. One of the  Christmas customs  in the Navy  is to  decorate the mastheads  with holly,  mistletoe, or evergreens. The mess-room tables are also decorated, and the  officers walk in  procession through the messes, the  Captain sampling the  fare.--[_Photos. by Newspaper Illustrations and Alfieri._]          __________________________________________________________________________  4--THE ILLUSTRATED WAR NEWS, DEC. 30, 1914.--[Part 21]      of our  submarines in  the Dardanelles,  had simply been  the victim  of a  \"leak\"; but  so serious was  this little \"rift  within the lute\"  that its  author,  Lieut.-Commander  Holbrook, R.N.,  was  awarded  a V.C.  for  his  splendid deed  of daring--a  very different  kind of  act from  the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18343"],[0,"The Pied Piper of Hamelin (#1)"],[1,"PIED PIPER    OF    HAMELIN            THE PIED PIPER    OF    HAMELIN    BY    ROBERT BROWNING    ILLUSTRATED BY    KATE GREENAWAY        LONDON    FREDERICK WARNE AND CO., LTD.    AND NEW YORK        Printed in U.S.A.          THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN      I.          Hamelin Town's in Brunswick,      By famous Hanover city;        The river Weser, deep and wide,        Washes its wall on the southern side;        A pleasanter spot you never spied;      But, when begins my ditty,        Almost five hundred years ago,        To see the townsfolk suffer so          From vermin, was a pity.      II.          Rats!      They fought the dogs and killed the cats,        And bit the babies in the cradles,        And ate the cheeses out of the vats.        And licked the soup from the cook's own ladles,      Split open the kegs of salted sprats,      Made nests inside men's Sunday hats,      And even spoiled the women's chats,        By drowning their speaking        With shrieking and squeaking      In fifty different sharps and flats.      III.        At last the people in a body          To the Town Hall came flocking:      \"Tis clear,\" cried they, \"our Mayor's a noddy;          And as for our Corporation--shocking      To think we buy gowns lined with ermine      For dolts that can't or won't determine      What's best to rid us of our vermin!      You hope, because you're old and obese,      To find in the furry civic robe ease?      Rouse up, sirs! Give your brains a racking      To find the remedy we're lacking,      Or, sure as fate, we'll send you packing!\"      At this the Mayor and Corporation      Quaked with a mighty consternation.      IV.        An hour they sate in council,        At length the Mayor broke silence:      \"For a guilder I'd my ermine gown sell;        I wish I were a mile hence!      It's easy to bid one rack one's brain--      I'm sure my poor head aches again,      I've scratched it so, and all in vain      Oh for a trap, a trap, a trap!\"      Just as he said this, what should hap      At the chamber door but a gentle tap?      \"Bless us,\" cried the Mayor, \"what's that?\"      (With the Corporation as he sat,      Looking little though wondrous fat;      Nor brighter was his eye, nor moister      Than a too-long-opened oyster,      Save when at noon his paunch grew mutinous      For a plate of turtle green and glutinous)      \"Only a scraping of shoes on the mat?      Anything like the sound of a rat      Makes my heart go pit-a-pat!\"      V.        \"Come in!\"--the Mayor cried, looking bigger:      And in did come the strangest figure!      His queer long coat from heel to head      Was half of yellow and half of red,      And he himself was tall and thin,      With sharp blue eyes, each like a pin,      And light loose hair, yet swarthy skin      No tuft on cheek nor beard on chin,      But lips where smile went out and in;      There was no guessing his kith and kin:      And nobody could enough admire      The tall man and his quaint attire.      Quoth one: \"It's as my great-grandsire,      Starting up at the Trump of Doom's tone,      Had walked this way from his painted tombstone!\"      VI.        He advanced to the council-table:      And, \"Please your honours,\" said he, \"I'm able,      By means of a secret charm, to draw      All creatures living beneath the sun,      That creep or swim or fly or run,      After me so as you never saw!      And I chiefly use my charm      On creatures that do people harm,      The mole and toad and newt and viper;      And people call me the Pied Piper.\"      (And here they noticed round his neck      A scarf of red and yellow stripe,      To match with his coat of the self-same cheque;      And at the scarf's end hung a pipe;      And his fingers they noticed were ever straying      As if impatient to be playing      Upon his pipe, as low it dangled      Over his vesture so old-fangled.)      \"Yet,\" said he, \"poor Piper as I am,      In Tartary I freed the Cham,      Last June, from his huge swarms of gnats,      I eased in Asia the Nizam      Of a monstrous brood of vampyre-bats:      And as for what your brain bewilders,      If I can rid your town of rats      Will you give me a thousand guilders?\"      \"One? fifty thousand!\"--was the exclamation      Of the astonished Mayor and Corporation.      VII.        Into the street the Piper stept,        Smiling first a little smile,      As if he knew what magic slept        In his quiet pipe the while;      Then, like a musical adept,      To blow the pipe his lips he wrinkled,      And green and blue his sharp eyes twinkled,      Like a candle-flame where salt is sprinkled;      And ere three shrill notes the pipe uttered,      You heard as if an army muttered;      And the muttering grew to a grumbling;      And the grumbling grew to a mighty rumbling;      And out of the houses the rats came tumbling.      Great rats, small rats, lean rats, brawny rats,      Brown rats, black rats, grey rats, tawny rats,      Grave old plodders, gay young friskers,        Fathers, mothers, uncles, cousins,      Cocking tails and pricking whiskers,        Families by tens and dozens,      Brothers, sisters, husbands, wives--      Followed the Piper for their lives.      From street to street he piped advancing,      And step for step they followed dancing,      Until they came to the river Weser      Wherein all plunged and perished!      --Save one who, stout as Julius Caesar,      Swam across and lived to carry      (As he, the manuscript he cherished)      To Rat-land home his commentary:      Which was, \"At the first shrill notes of the pipe,      I heard a sound as of scraping tripe,      And putting apples, wondrous ripe,      Into a cider-press's gripe:      And a moving away of pickle-tub-boards,      And a leaving ajar of conserve-cupboards,      And a drawing the corks of train-oil-flasks,      And a breaking the hoops of butter-casks:      And it seemed as if a voice      (Sweeter far than by harp or by psaltery      Is breathed) called out, 'Oh rats, rejoice!      The world is grown to one vast drysaltery!      So munch on, crunch on, take your nuncheon,      Breakfast, supper, dinner, luncheon!'      And just as a bulky sugar-puncheon,      All ready staved, like a great sun shone      Glorious scarce an inch before me,      Just as methought it said, 'Come, bore me!'      --I found the Weser rolling o'er me.\"      VIII.        You should have heard the Hamelin people      Ringing the bells till they rocked the steeple      \"Go,\" cried the Mayor, \"and get long poles,      Poke out the nests and block up the holes!      Consult with carpenters and builders,      And leave in our town not even a trace      Of the rats!\"--when suddenly up the face      Of the Piper perked in the market-place,      With a, \"First, if you please, my thousand guilders!\"      IX.        A thousand guilders! The Mayor looked blue;      So did the Corporation too.      For council dinners made rare havoc      With Claret, Moselle, Vin-de-Grave, Hock;      And half the money would replenish      Their cellar's biggest butt with Rhenish.      To pay this sum to a wandering fellow      With a gipsy coat of red and yellow!      \"Beside,\" quoth the Mayor with a knowing wink,      \"Our business was done at the river's brink;      We saw with our eyes the vermin sink,      And what's dead can't come to life, I think.      So, friend, we're not the folks to shrink      From the duty of giving you something to drink,      And a matter of money to put in your poke;      But as for the guilders, what we spoke      Of them, as you very well know, was in joke.      Beside, our losses have made us thrifty.      A thousand guilders! Come, take fifty!\"      X.        The Piper's face fell, and he cried,      \"No trifling! I can't wait, beside!      I've promised to visit by dinner-time      Bagdad, and accept the prime      Of the Head-Cook's pottage, all he's rich in,      For having left, in the Caliph's kitchen,      Of a nest of scorpions no survivor:      With him I proved no bargain-driver,      With you, don't think I'll bate a stiver!      And folks who put me in a passion      May find me pipe after another fashion.\"      XI.        \"How?\" cried the Mayor, \"d' ye think I brook      Being worse treated than a Cook?      Insulted by a lazy ribald      With idle pipe and vesture piebald?      You threaten us, fellow? Do your worst,      Blow your pipe there till you burst!\"      XII.        Once more he stept into the street,        And to his lips again      Laid his long pipe of smooth straight cane;        And ere he blew three notes                                       (such sweet      Soft notes as yet musician's cunning        Never gave the enraptured air)      There was a rustling,      that seemed like a bustling      Of merry crowds justling at pitching and hustling,      Small feet were pattering, wooden shoes clattering,      Little hands clapping and little tongues chattering,      And, like fowls in a farm-yard when barley is scattering,      Out came the children running.      All the little boys and girls,      With rosy cheeks and flaxen curls,      And sparkling eyes and teeth like pearls.      Tripping      and skipping,      ran merrily after      The wonderful music with shouting and laughter.      XIII.        The Mayor was dumb, and the Council stood      As if they were changed into blocks of wood,      Unable to move a step, or cry      To the children merrily skipping by.      --Could only follow with the eye      That joyous crowd at the Piper's back.      But how the Mayor was on the rack,      And the wretched Council's bosoms beat,      As the Piper turned from the High Street      To where the Weser rolled its waters      Right in the way of their sons and daughters!      However he turned from South to West,      And to Koppelberg Hill his steps addressed,      And after him the children"]]]
