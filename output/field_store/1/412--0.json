LAWH-I-KARMIL (TABLET OF CARMEL)      ALL glory be to this Day, the Day in which the fragrances of mercy have  been wafted over all created things, a Day so blest that past ages and  centuries can never hope to rival it, a Day in which the countenance of  the Ancient of Days hath turned towards His holy seat. Thereupon the  voices of all created things, and beyond them those of the Concourse on  High, were heard calling aloud: 'Haste thee, O Carmel, for lo, the light  of the countenance of God, the Ruler of the Kingdom of Names and Fashioner  of the heavens, hath been lifted upon thee.'    Seized with transports of joy, and raising high her voice, she thus  exclaimed: 'May my life be a sacrifice to Thee, inasmuch as Thou hast  fixed Thy gaze upon me, hast bestowed upon me Thy bounty, and hast  directed towards me Thy steps. Separation from Thee, O Thou Source of  everlasting life, hath well nigh consumed me, and my remoteness from Thy  presence hath burned away my soul. All praise be to Thee for having  enabled me to hearken to Thy call, for having honoured me with Thy  footsteps, and for having quickened my soul through the vitalizing  fragrance of Thy Day and the shrilling voice of Thy Pen, a voice Thou  didst ordain as Thy trumpet-call amidst Thy people. And when the hour at  which Thy resistless Faith was to be made manifest did strike, Thou didst  breathe a breath of Thy spirit into Thy Pen, and lo, the entire creation  shook to its very foundations, unveiling to mankind such mysteries as lay  hidden within the treasuries of Him Who is the Possessor of all created  things.'    No sooner had her voice reached that most exalted Spot than We made reply:  'Render thanks unto thy Lord, O Carmel. The fire of thy separation from Me  was fast consuming thee, when the ocean of My presence surged before thy  face, cheering thine eyes and those of all creation, and filling with  delight all things visible and invisible. Rejoice, for God hath in this  Day established upon thee His throne, hath made thee the dawning-place of  His signs and the dayspring of the evidences of His Revelation. Well is it  with him that circleth around thee, that proclaimeth the revelation of thy  glory, and recounteth that which the bounty of the Lord thy God hath  showered upon thee. Seize thou the Chalice of Immortality in the name of  thy Lord, the All-Glorious, and give thanks unto Him, inasmuch as He, in  token of His mercy unto thee, hath turned thy sorrow into gladness, and  transmuted thy grief into blissful joy. He, verily, loveth the spot which  hath been made the seat of His throne, which His footsteps have trodden,  which hath been honoured by His presence, from which He raised His call,  and upon which He shed His tears.    'Call out to Zion, O Carmel, and announce the joyful tidings: He that was  hidden from mortal eyes is come! His all-conquering sovereignty is  manifest; His all-encompassing splendour is revealed. Beware lest thou  hesitate or halt. Hasten forth and circumambulate the City of God that  hath descended from heaven, the celestial Kaaba round which have circled  in adoration the favoured of God, the pure in heart, and the company of  the most exalted angels. Oh, how I long to announce unto every spot on the  surface of the earth, and to carry to each one of its cities, the  glad-tidings of this Revelation--a Revelation to which the heart of Sinai  hath been attracted, and in whose name the Burning Bush is calling: \"Unto  God, the Lord of Lords, belong the kingdoms of earth and heaven.\" Verily  this is the Day in which both land and sea rejoice at this announcement,  the Day for which have been laid up those things which God, through a  bounty beyond the ken of mortal mind or heart, hath destined for  revelation. Ere long will God sail His Ark upon thee, and will manifest  the people of Baha who have been mentioned in the Book of Names.'    Sanctified be the Lord of all mankind, at the mention of Whose name all  the atoms of the earth have been made to vibrate, and the Tongue of  Grandeur hath been moved to disclose that which had been wrapt in His  knowledge and lay concealed within the treasury of His might. He, verily,  through the potency of His name, the Mighty, the All-Powerful, the Most  High, is the ruler of all that is in the heavens and all that is on earth.                              LAWH-I-AQDAS (THE MOST HOLY TABLET)(1)      This is the Most Holy Tablet sent down from the holy kingdom unto the one  who hath set his face towards the Object of the adoration of the world, He  Who hath come from the heaven of eternity, invested with transcendent  glory    In the name of the Lord, the Lord of great glory.    THIS is an Epistle from Our presence unto him whom the veils of names have  failed to keep back from God, the Creator of earth and heaven, that his  eyes may be cheered in the days of his Lord, the Help in Peril, the  Self-Subsisting.    Say, O followers of the Son!(2) Have ye shut out yourselves from Me by  reason of My Name? Wherefore ponder ye not in your hearts? Day and night  ye have been calling upon your Lord, the Omnipotent, but when He came from  the heaven of eternity in His great glory, ye turned aside from Him and  remained sunk in heedlessness.    Consider those who rejected the Spirit(3) when He came unto them with  manifest dominion. How numerous the Pharisees who had secluded themselves  in synagogues in His name, lamenting over their separation from Him, and  yet when the portals of reunion were flung open and the divine Luminary  shone resplendent from the Dayspring of Beauty, they disbelieved in God,  the Exalted, the Mighty. They failed to attain His presence,  notwithstanding that His advent had been promised them in the Book of  Isaiah as well as in the Books of the Prophets and the Messengers. No one  from among them turned his face towards the Dayspring of divine bounty  except such as were destitute of any power amongst men. And yet, today,  every man endowed with power and invested with sovereignty prideth himself  on His Name. Moreover, call thou to mind the one who sentenced Jesus to  death. He was the most learned of his age in his own country, whilst he  who was only a fisherman believed in Him. Take good heed and be of them  that observe the warning.    Consider likewise, how numerous at this time are the monks who"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17314"],[0,"Five Children and It (#1)"],[1,"Team at https://www.pgdp.net (This file was  produced from images generously made available by the  Library of Congress)                  [Illustration: The Psammead]          FIVE CHILDREN     AND IT    BY  E.

And then there was a white house with a green garden and an  orchard beyond, and mother said, \"Here we are!\"    \"How white the house is,\" said Robert.    \"And look at the roses,\" said Anthea.    \"And the plums,\" said Jane.    \"It is rather decent,\" Cyril admitted.    The Baby said, \"Wanty go walky;\" and the hack stopped with a last rattle  and jolt.    Everyone got its legs kicked or its feet trodden on in the scramble to  get out of the carriage that very minute, but no one seemed to mind.  Mother, curiously enough, was in no hurry to get out; and even when she  had come down slowly and by the step, and with no jump at all, she  seemed to wish to see the boxes carried in, and even to pay the driver,  instead of joining in that first glorious rush round the garden and  orchard and the thorny, thistly, briery, brambly wilderness beyond the  broken gate and the dry fountain at the side of the house. But the  children were wiser, for once. It was not really a pretty house at all;  it was quite ordinary, and mother thought it was rather inconvenient,  and was quite annoyed at there being no shelves, to speak of, and hardly  a cupboard in the place. Father used to say that the iron-work on the  roof and coping was like an architect's nightmare. But the house was  deep in the country, with no other house in sight, and the children had  been in London for two years, without so much as once going to the  seaside even for a day by an excursion train, and so the White House  seemed to them a sort of Fairy Palace set down in an Earthly Paradise.  For London is like prison for children, especially if their relations  are not rich.    [Illustration: That first glorious rush round the garden]    Of course there are the shops and theatres, and entertainments and  things, but if your people are rather poor you don't get taken to the  theatres, and you can't buy things out of the shops; and London has none  of those nice things that children may play with without hurting the  things or themselves--such as trees and sand and woods and waters. And  nearly everything in London is the wrong sort of shape--all straight  lines and flat streets, instead of being all sorts of odd shapes, like  things are in the country. Trees are all different, as you know, and I  am sure some tiresome person must have told you that there are no two  blades of grass exactly alike. But in streets, where the blades of grass  don't grow, everything is like everything else. This is why many  children who live in the towns are so extremely naughty. They do not  know what is the matter with them, and no more do their fathers and  mothers, aunts, uncles, cousins, tutors, governesses, and nurses; but I  know. And so do you, now. Children in the country are naughty sometimes,  too, but that is for quite different reasons.    The children had explored the gardens and the outhouses thoroughly  before they were caught and cleaned for tea, and they saw quite well  that they were certain to be happy at the White House. They thought so  from the first moment, but when they found the back of the house covered  with jasmine, all in white flower, and smelling like a bottle of the  most expensive perfume that is ever given for a birthday present; and  when they had seen the lawn, all green and smooth, and quite different  from the brown grass in the gardens at Camden Town; and when they found  the stable with a loft over it and some old hay still left, they were  almost certain; and when Robert had found the broken swing and tumbled  out of it and got a bump on his head the size of an egg, and Cyril had  nipped his finger in the door of a hutch that seemed made to keep  rabbits in, if you ever had any, they had no longer any doubts  whatever.    [Illustration: Cyril had nipped his finger in the door of a hutch]    The best part of it all was that there were no rules about not going to  places and not doing things. In London almost everything is"]]]
