DUNGEON  [Illustration]          FAUST    [Illustration]    [Illustration: Preface]    It is twenty years since I first determined to attempt the translation  of _Faust_, in the original metres. At that time, although more than a  score of English translations of the First Part, and three or four of  the Second Part, were in existence, the experiment had not yet been  made. The prose version of Hayward seemed to have been accepted as the  standard, in default of anything more satisfactory: the English critics,  generally sustaining the translator in his views concerning the  secondary importance of form in Poetry, practically discouraged any  further attempt; and no one, familiar with rhythmical expression through  the needs of his own nature, had devoted the necessary love and patience  to an adequate reproduction of the great work of Goethe's life.    Mr. Brooks was the first to undertake the task, and the publication of  his translation of the First Part (in 1856) induced me, for a time, to  give up my own design. No previous English version exhibited such  abnegation of the translator's own tastes and habits of thought, such  reverent desire to present the original in its purest form. The care and  conscience with which the work had been performed were so apparent, that  I now state with reluctance what then seemed to me to be its only  deficiencies,--a lack of the lyrical fire and fluency of the original in  some passages, and an occasional lowering of the tone through the use of  words which are literal, but not equivalent. The plan of translation  adopted by Mr. Brooks was so entirely my own, that when further  residence in Germany and a more careful study of both parts of _Faust_  had satisfied me that the field was still open,--that the means  furnished by the poetical affinity of the two languages had not yet been  exhausted,--nothing remained for me but to follow him in all essential  particulars. His example confirmed me in the belief that there were few  difficulties in the way of a nearly literal yet thoroughly rhythmical  version of _Faust_, which might not be overcome by loving labor. A  comparison of seventeen English translations, in the arbitrary metres  adopted by the translators, sufficiently showed the danger of allowing  license in this respect: the white light of Goethe's thought was thereby  passed through the tinted glass of other minds, and assumed the coloring  of each. Moreover, the plea of selecting different metres in the hope of  producing a similar effect is unreasonable, where the identical metres  are possible.    The value of form, in a poetical work, is the first question to be  considered. No poet ever understood this question more thoroughly than  Goethe himself, or expressed a more positive opinion in regard to it.  The alternative modes of translation which he presents (reported by  Riemer, quoted by Mrs. Austin, in her \"Characteristics of Goethe,\" and  accepted by Mr. Hayward),[A] are quite independent of his views  concerning the value of form, which we find given elsewhere, in the  clearest and most emphatic manner.[B] Poetry is not simply a fashion of  expression: it is the form of expression absolutely required by a  certain class of ideas. Poetry, indeed, may be distinguished from Prose  by the single circumstance, that it is the utterance of whatever in man  cannot be perfectly uttered in any other than a rhythmical form: it is  useless to say that the naked meaning is independent of the form: on the  contrary, the form contributes essentially to the fullness of the  meaning. In Poetry which endures through its own inherent vitality,  there is no forced union of these two elements. They are as intimately  blended, and with the same mysterious beauty, as the sexes in the  ancient Hermaphroditus. To attempt to represent Poetry in Prose, is very  much like attempting to translate music into speech.[C]    [A] \"'There are two maxims of translation,' says he: 'the one requires  that the author, of a foreign nation, be brought to us in such a manner  that we may regard him as our own; the other, on the contrary, demands  of us that we transport ourselves over to him, and adopt his situation,  his mode of speaking, and his peculiarities. The advantages of both are  sufficiently known to all instructed persons, from masterly examples.'\"  Is it necessary, however, that there should always be this alternative?  Where the languages are kindred, and equally capable of all varieties of  metrical expression, may not both these \"maxims\" be observed in the same  translation? Goethe, it is true, was of the opinion that _Faust_ ought  to be given, in French, in the manner of Clement Marot; but this was  undoubtedly because he felt the inadequacy of modern French to express  the naive, simple realism of many passages. The same objection does not  apply to English. There are a few archaic expressions in _Faust_, but no  more than are still allowed--nay, frequently encouraged--in the English  of our day.    [B] \"You are right,\" said Goethe; \"there are great and mysterious  agencies included in the various forms of Poetry. If the substance of my  'Roman Elegies' were to be expressed in the tone and measure of Byron's  'Don Juan,' it would really have an atrocious effect.\"--_Eckermann_.    \"The rhythm,\" said Goethe, \"is an unconscious result of the poetic mood.  If one should stop to consider it mechanically, when about to write a  poem, one would become bewildered and accomplish nothing of real  poetical value.\"--_Ibid_.    \"_All that is poetic in character should be rythmically treated_! Such  is my conviction; and if even a sort of poetic prose should be gradually  introduced, it would only show that the distinction between prose and  poetry had been completely lost sight of.\"--_Goethe to Schiller_, 1797.    Tycho Mommsen, in his excellent essay, _Die Kunst des Deutschen  Uebersetzers aus neueren Sprachen_, goes so far as to say: \"The metrical  or rhymed modelling of a poetical work is so essentially the germ of its  being, that, rather than by giving it up, we might hope to construct a  similar work of art before the eyes of our countrymen, by giving up or  changing the substance. The immeasurable result which has followed works  wherein the form has been retained--such as the Homer of Voss, and the  Shakespeare of Tieck and Schlegel--is an incontrovertible evidence of  the vitality of the endeavor.\"    [C] \"Goethe's poems exercise a great sway over me, not only by their  meaning, but also by their rhythm. It is a language which stimulates me  to composition.\"--_Beethoven_.    The various theories of translation from the Greek and Latin poets have  been admirably stated by Dryden in his Preface to the \"Translations from  Ovid's Epistles,\" and I do not wish to continue the endless  discussion,--especially as our literature needs examples, not opinions.  A recent expression, however, carries with it so much authority, that I  feel bound to present some considerations which the accomplished scholar  seems to have overlooked. Mr. Lewes[D] justly says: \"The effect of  poetry is a compound of music and suggestion; this music and this  suggestion are intermingled in words, which to alter is to alter the  effect. For words in poetry are not, as in prose, simple representatives  of objects and ideas: they are parts of an organic whole,--they are  tones in the harmony.\" He thereupon illustrates the effect of  translation by changing certain well-known English stanzas into others,  equivalent in meaning, but lacking their felicity of words, their grace  and melody. I cannot accept this illustration as valid, because Mr.  Lewes purposely omits the very quality which an honest translator should  exhaust his skill in endeavoring to reproduce. He turns away from the  _one best_ word or phrase in the English lines he quotes, whereas the  translator seeks precisely that one best word or phrase (having _all_  the resources of his language at command), to represent what is said in  _another_ language. More than this, his task is not simply mechanical:  he must feel, and be guided by, a secondary inspiration. Surrendering  himself to the full possession of the spirit which shall speak through  him, he receives, also, a portion of the same creative power. Mr. Lewes  reaches this conclusion: \"If, therefore, we reflect what a poem _Faust_  is, and that it contains almost every variety of style and metre, it  will be tolerably evident that no one unacquainted with the original can  form an adequate idea of it from translation,\"[E] which is certainly  correct of any translation wherein something of the rhythmical variety  and beauty of the original is "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/146"],[0,"A Little Princess (#1)"],[1,"Little Princess      by    Frances Hodgson Burnett          A LITTLE PRINCESS      Summary: Sara Crewe, a pupil at Miss Minchin's London school, is left  in poverty when her father dies, but is later rescued by a mysterious  benefactor.

Anne          A Little Princess      1    Sara      Once on a dark winter's day, when the yellow fog hung so thick and  heavy in the streets of London that the lamps were lighted and the shop  windows blazed with gas as they do at night, an odd-looking little girl  sat in a cab with her father and was driven rather slowly through the  big thoroughfares.    She sat with her feet tucked under her, and leaned against her father,  who held her in his arm, as she stared out of the window at the passing  people with a queer old-fashioned thoughtfulness in her big eyes.    She was such a little girl that one did not expect to see such a look  on her small face.  It would have been an old look for a child of  twelve, and Sara Crewe was only seven.  The fact was, however, that she  was always dreaming and thinking odd things and could not herself  remember any time when she had not been thinking things about grown-up  people and the world they belonged to. She felt as if she had lived a  long, long time.    At this moment she was remembering the voyage she had just made from  Bombay with her father, Captain Crewe.  She was thinking of the big  ship, of the Lascars passing silently to and fro on it, of the children  playing about on the hot deck, and of some young officers' wives who  used to try to make her talk to them and laugh at the things she said.    Principally, she was thinking of what a queer thing it was that at one  time one was in India in the blazing sun, and then in the middle of the  ocean, and then driving in a strange vehicle through strange streets  where the day was as dark as the night.  She found this so puzzling  that she moved closer to her father.    \"Papa,\" she said in a low, mysterious little voice which was almost a  whisper, \"papa.\"    \"What is it, darling?\"  Captain Crewe answered, holding her closer and  looking down into her face.  \"What is Sara thinking of?\"    \"Is this the place?\"  Sara whispered, cuddling still closer to him. \"Is  it, papa?\"    \"Yes, little Sara, it is.  We have reached it at last.\"  And though she  was only seven years old, she knew that he felt sad when he said it.    It seemed to her many years since he had begun to prepare her mind for  \"the place,\" as she always called it.  Her mother had died when she was  born, so she had never known or missed her.  Her young, handsome, rich,  petting father seemed to be the only relation she had in the world.  They had always played together and been fond of each other.  She only  knew he was rich because she had heard people say so when they thought  she was not listening, and she had also heard them say that when she  grew up she would be rich, too.  She did not know all that being rich  meant.  She had always lived in a beautiful bungalow, and had been used  to seeing many servants who made salaams to her and called her \"Missee  Sahib,\" and gave her her own way in everything.  She had had toys and  pets and an ayah who worshipped her, and she had gradually learned that  people who were rich had these things.  That, however, was all she knew  about it.    During her short life only one thing had troubled her, and that thing  was \"the place\" she was to be taken to some day.  The climate of India  was very bad for children, and as soon as possible they were sent away  from it--generally to England and to school. She had seen other  children go away, and had heard their fathers and mothers talk about  the letters they received from them. She had known that she would be  obliged to go also, and though sometimes her father's stories of the  voyage and the new country had attracted her, she had been troubled by  the thought that he could not stay with her.    \"Couldn't you go to that place with me, papa?\" she had asked when she  was five years old.  \"Couldn't you go to school, too? I would help you  with your lessons.\"    \"But you will not have to stay for a very long time, little Sara,\" he  had always said.  \"You will go to a nice house where there will be a  lot of little girls, and you will play together, and I will send you  plenty of books, and you will grow so fast that it will seem scarcely a  year before you are big enough and clever enough to come back and take  care of papa.\"    She had liked to think of that.  To keep the house for her father; to  ride with him, and sit at the head of his table when he had dinner  parties; to talk to him and read his books--that would be what she  would like most in the world, and if one must go away to \"the place\" in  England to attain it, she must make up her mind to go. She did not care  very much for other little girls, but if she had plenty of books she  could console herself.  She liked books more than anything else, and  was, in fact, always inventing stories of beautiful things and telling  them to herself.  Sometimes she had told them to her father, and he had  liked them as much as she did.    \"Well, papa,\" she said softly, \"if we are here I suppose we must be  resigned.\"    He laughed at her old-fashioned speech and kissed her.  He was really  not at all resigned himself, though he knew he must keep that a secret.  His quaint little Sara had been a great companion to him, and he felt  he should be a lonely fellow when, on his return to India, he went into  his bungalow knowing he need not expect to see the small figure in its  white frock come forward to meet him.  So he held her very closely in  his arms as the cab rolled into the big, dull square in which stood the  house which was their destination.    It was a big, dull, brick house, exactly like all the others in its  row, but that on the front door there shone a brass plate on which was  engraved in black letters:    MISS MINCHIN,    Select Seminary for Young Ladies.      \"Here we are, Sara,\" said Captain Crewe, making his voice sound as  cheerful as possible.  Then he lifted her out of the cab and they  mounted the steps and rang the bell.  Sara often thought afterward that  the house was somehow exactly like Miss Minchin.  It was respectable  and well furnished, but everything in it was ugly; and the very  armchairs seemed to have hard bones in them.  In the hall everything  was hard and polished--even the red cheeks of the moon face on the tall  clock in the corner had a severe varnished look. The drawing room into  which they were ushered was covered by a carpet with a square pattern  upon it, the chairs were square, and a heavy marble timepiece stood  upon the heavy marble mantel.    As she sat down in one of the stiff mahogany chairs, Sara cast one of  her quick looks about her.    \"I don't like it, papa,\" she said.  \"But then I dare say soldiers--even  brave ones--don't really LIKE going into battle.\"    Captain Crewe laughed outright at this.  He was young and full of fun,  and he never tired of hearing Sara's queer speeches.    \"Oh, little Sara,\" he said.  \"What shall I do when I have no one to say  solemn things to me?  No one else is as solemn as you are.\"    \"But why do solemn things make you laugh so?\" inquired Sara.    \"Because you are such fun when you say them,\" he answered, laughing  still more.  And then suddenly he swept her into his arms and kissed  her very hard, stopping laughing all at once and looking almost as if  tears had come into his eyes.    It was just then that Miss Minchin entered the room.  She was very like  her house, Sara felt: tall and dull, and respectable and ugly. She had  large, cold, fishy eyes, and a large, cold, fishy smile. It spread  itself into a very large smile when she saw Sara and Captain Crewe.  She had heard a great many desirable things of the young soldier from  the lady who had recommended her school to him. Among other things, she  had heard that he was a rich father who was willing to spend a great  deal of money on his little daughter.    \"It will be a great privilege to have charge of such a beautiful and  promising child, Captain Crewe,\" she said, taking Sara's hand and  stroking it.  \"Lady Meredith has told me of her unusual cleverness. A  clever child is a great treasure in an establishment like mine.\"    Sara stood quietly, with her eyes fixed upon Miss Minchin's face. She  was thinking something odd, as usual.    \"Why does she say I am a beautiful child?\" she was thinking. \"I am not  beautiful at all.  Colonel Grange's little girl, Isobel, is beautiful.  She has dimples and rose-colored cheeks, and long hair the color of  gold.  I have short black hair and green eyes; besides which, I am a  thin child and not fair in the least.  I am one of the ugliest children  I ever saw.  She is beginning by telling a story.\"    She was mistaken, however, in thinking she was an ugly child.  She was  not in the least like Isobel Grange, who had been the beauty of the  regiment, but she had an odd charm of her own.  She was a slim, supple  creature, rather tall for her age, and had an intense, attractive  little face.  Her hair was heavy and quite black and only curled at the  tips; her eyes were greenish gray, it is true, but they were big,  wonderful eyes with long, black lashes, and though she herself did not  like the color of them, many other people did. Still she was very firm  in her belief that she was an ugly little girl, and she was not at all  elated by Miss Minchin's flattery.    \"I should be"]]]
