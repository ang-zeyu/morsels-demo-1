Here he meets the spectre  crew of Captain Hudson, and, after partaking of their hospitality,  falls into a deep sleep which lasts for twenty years. The latter part  of the story describes the changes which he finds on his return to  his native village: nearly all the old, familiar faces are gone;  manners, dress, and speech are all changed. He feels like a stranger  in a strange land.    Now, it is a good thing sometimes to take a look back, to try to count  over the changes for good or for evil which have taken place in this  country of ours; to try to understand clearly why the reign of a great  Queen should have left its mark upon our history in such a way that  men speak of the Victorian Age as one of the greatest ages that have  ever been.    If an Elizabethan had been asked whether he considered the Queen of  England a great woman or not, he would undoubtedly have answered  \"Yes,\" and given very good reasons for his answer. It was not for  nothing that the English almost worshipped their Queen in \"those  spacious times of great Elizabeth.\" Edmund Spenser, one of the  world's great poets, hymned her as \"fayre Elisa\" and \"the flowre of  Virgins\":              Helpe me to blaze            Her worthy praise;       Which, in her sexe doth all excell!    Throughout her long reign, courtiers, statesmen, soldiers, and  people all united in serving her gladly and to the best of their  powers.    Yet she could at times prove herself to be hard, cruel, and  vindictive; she was mean, even miserly, when money was wanted for  men or ships; she was excessively vain, loved dress and finery, and  was often proud almost beyond bearing.    Notwithstanding all her faults, she was the best beloved of all  English monarchs because of her never-failing courage and strength  of mind, and she made the Crown respected, feared, and loved as no  other ruler had done before her, and none other, save Queen Victoria,  has reigned as she did in her people's hearts.    She lived for her country, and her country's love and admiration were  her reward. During her reign the seas were swept clear of foreign  foes, and her country took its place in the front rank of Great Powers.  Hers was the Golden Age of Literature, of Adventure and Learning,  an age of great men and women, a New England.    If an Elizabethan Rip Van Winkle had fallen asleep and awakened again  at the opening of Victoria's reign, more than 200 years later, what  would he have found? England still a mighty Power, it is true,  scarcely yet recovered from the long war against Napoleon, with  Nelson and Wellington enthroned as the national heroes. But the times  were bad in many ways, for it was \"a time of ugliness: ugly religion,  ugly law, ugly relations between rich and poor, ugly clothes, ugly  furniture.\"    The England of that day, it must be remembered, was the England  described so faithfully in Charles Dickens' early works. It was far  from being the England we know now. In 1836 appeared the first number  of Mr Pickwick's travels. _The Pickwick Papers_ is not a great work  of humour merely, for in its pages we see England and the early  Victorians--a strange country to us--in which they lived.    It is an England of old inns and stagecoaches, where \"manners and  roads were very rough\"; where men were still cast into prison for  debt and lived and died there; where the execution of a criminal still  took place in public; where little children of tender years were  condemned to work in the depths of coal-pits, and amid the clang and  roar of machinery. It was a hard, cruel age. No longer did the people  look up to and reverence their monarch as their leader. England had  yet to pass through a long and bitter period of 'strife and stress,'  of war between rich and poor, of many and bewildering changes. The  introduction of coal, steam, and mechanism was rapidly changing the  character of the whole country. The revenue had grown from about  19,000,000 pounds in 1792 to 105,000,000 pounds in 1815, and there  seemed to be no limit to the national wealth and resources.    But these very changes which enriched some few were the cause of  misery and poverty to struggling thousands. Machinery had ruined the  spinning-wheel industry and reduced the price of cloth; the price  of corn had risen, and, after the close of the great war, other  nations were free once again to compete against our country in the  markets where we so long had possessed the monopoly of trade.    [Illustration: The Queen's first Council at Kensington Palace  Photo W.A. Mansell & Co.]    The period which followed the year 1815 was one of incessant struggle  for reform, and chiefly the reform of a Parliament which no  longer represented the people's wishes. Considerably more than half  the members were not elected at all, but were recommended by patrons.    The average price of a seat in Parliament was 5000 pounds for a  so-called 'rotten borough.' Scotland returned forty-five members  and Cornwall forty-four members to Parliament! The reformers also  demanded the abolition of the 'taxes on knowledge,' by which was  meant the stamp duty of fourpence on every copy of a newspaper, a  duty of threepence on every pound of paper, and a heavy tax upon  advertisements. The new Poor Laws aroused bitter discontent. Instead  of receiving payment of money for relief of poverty, as had formerly  been the case, the poor and needy were now sent to the 'Union'  workhouse.    A series of bad harvests was the cause of great migrations to the  factory towns, and the already large ranks of the unemployed grew  greater day by day. The poverty and wretchedness of the working class  is painted vividly for us by Carlyle when he speaks of \"half a million  handloom weavers, working 15 hours a day, in perpetual inability to  procure thereby enough of the coarsest food; Scotch farm-labourers,  who 'in districts the half of whose husbandry is that of cows, taste  no milk, can procure no milk' . . . the working-classes can no longer  go on without government, without being _actually_ guided and  governed.\"    Such was Victoria's England when she ascended the throne, a young  girl, nineteen years of age.          CHAPTER II: _Childhood Days      On the western side of Kensington Gardens stands the old Palace,  built originally in the solid Dutch style for King William and Mary.  The great architect, Sir Christopher Wren, made notable additions  to it, and it was still further extended in 1721 for George the First.    Within its walls passed away both William and his Queen, Queen Anne  and her husband, and George the Second. After this time it ceased  to be a royal residence.    The charm of Kensington Gardens, with its beautiful walks and  secluded sylvan nooks--the happy hunting-ground of London children  and the home of 'Peter Pan'--has inspired many writers to sing its  praises:        In this lone, open glade I lie,      Screen'd by deep boughs on either hand;      And at its end, to stay the eye,      Those black-crown'd, red-boled pine trees stand!        Birds here make song, each bird has his,      Across the girding city's hum.      How green under the boughs it is!      How thick the tremulous sheep cries come!        Here at my feet what wonders pass,      What endless, active life is here!      What blowing daisies, fragrant grass!      An air-stirred forest, fresh and clear.                                   MATTHEW ARNOLD    Beaconsfield spoke of its \"sublime sylvan solitude superior to the  cedars of Lebanon, and inferior only in extent to the chestnut  forests of Anatolia.\"    Kensington Palace was the birthplace of Queen Victoria, and in the  garden walks she used to play, little knowing that she would one day  be Queen of England. Her doll's house and toys are still preserved  in the rooms which she inhabited as a little girl.    [Illustration: KENSINGTON PALACE]    Four years had passed since the battle of Waterloo when the Princess  Victoria was born, and England was settling down to a time of peace  after long years of warfare.    In 1830 George the Fourth died, and was succeeded by his brother,  the Duke of Clarence, as William the Fourth, the 'sailor king.'  Though not in any respect a great monarch, he proved himself to be  a good king and one who was always wishful to do the best that lay  in his power for the country's good.    He was exceedingly hospitable, and gave dinners to thousands of his  friends and acquaintances during the year, particularly inviting all  his old messmates of the Navy. He had two daughters by his marriage,  and as these both died young it was"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16972"],[0,"Scientific American Supplement, No. 711, August 17, 1889 (#1)"],[1,"Team at www.pgdp.net            [Illustration]          SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN SUPPLEMENT NO. 711          NEW YORK, AUGUST 17, 1889    Scientific American Supplement.

[Illustration: THE DEFENSE OF GIBRALTAR--EXPERIMENTAL NAVAL AND  MILITARY OPERATIONS.]    A novel and interesting series of operations was carried out at  Gibraltar a few weeks ago, with a view to test the promptitude with  which the garrison of the famous Rock could turn out to resist a  sudden attack by a powerful iron-clad fleet. The supposed enemy was  represented by the Channel Squadron, under the command of Vice-Admiral  Baird, and consisting of H.M.S. Northumberland (flag ship), the  Agincourt, Monarch, Iron Duke, and Curlew. The \"general idea\" of the  operations was that a hostile fleet was known to be cruising in the  vicinity, and that an attack on the Rock might be made. The squadron  left Gibraltar and proceeded to the westward, returning to the  eastward through the Straits under cover of the night.    The Governor of Gibraltar, General the Hon. Sir Arthur Hardinge,  issued orders for the whole garrison to stand to their arms at dawn,  and subsequent days, until the attack should be made; but by his  express command no batteries were to be manned, or any troops moved  from their alarm posts, until the signal was given that an attack was  imminent. The alarm signal ordered was that of three guns fired in  rapid succession from the Upper Signal Station on the summit of the  Rock, to be followed, after a short pause, by two more shots. It was a  matter of complete uncertainty as to the direction from which the  attack would be made.    Every detail was carefully carried out, as if the impending attack was  a real affair. The telegraphic communication between the various parts  of the Rock was supplemented by signalers; arrangements were made for  the ready supply of reserve ammunition for all arms; and the medical  authorities established dressing stations, at numerous points of the  Rock, to render \"first aid\" to those who might chance to be numbered  among the \"wounded.\" Day broke with a \"Levanter,\" and the heavy clouds  hanging about rendered any distant view a matter of difficulty.  However, before it had become actually daylight the alarm guns gave  notice that the enemy had been sighted. The troops turned out with  great promptitude, being all at their assigned stations in less than a  quarter of an hour, and were shortly ordered to various points  commanding the east side of the Rock. As day broke, the hostile ships  were to be discerned steaming in single line ahead, from the northeast,  along the back of the Rock, and about 5,000 yards from it. The flag  ship, followed by the Monarch and the Agincourt, proceeded toward  Europa Point, while the Iron Duke and the Curlew stood close in to the  eastern beach, so as to engage the northern defenses of the fortress.  The first shot was fired by the flag ship, shortly before six o'clock  in the morning, at the southern defenses. It was replied to, in less  than three minutes, by the Europa batteries, and very shortly the  engagement became general. The plan of tactics employed by the  squadron was that of steaming rapidly up and down, and concentrating  their fire in turn on the various shore batteries. Later on, the whole  squadron assembled off Europa Point, and fired broadsides by  electricity as they steamed past at speed. The spectacle at this  moment was a very fine one, the roar of the heavy guns of the ships  being supplemented by the sharp, rapid report of the quick-firing  guns, which were supposed to be sending a storm of"]]]
