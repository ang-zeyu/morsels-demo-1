Aetas prima crepantibus    flevit sub ferulis: mox docuit toga    infectum vitiis falsa loqui, non sine crimine.      Tum lasciva protervitas,                                 10    et luxus petulans (heu pudet ac piget)    foedavit iuvenem nequitiae sordibus ac luto.      Exin iurgia turbidos    armarunt animos et male pertinax    vincendi studium subiacuit casibus asperis.                15      Bis legum moderamine    frenos nobilium reximus urbium,    ius civile bonis reddidimus, terruimus reos.      Tandem militiae gradu    evectum pietas principis extulit                           20    adsumptum propius stare iubens ordine proximo.      Haec dum vita volans agit,    inrepsit subito canities seni    oblitum veteris me Saliae consulis arguens:      ex quo prima dies mihi                                   25    quam multas hiemes volverit et rosas    pratis post glaciem reddiderit, nix capitis probat.

Yet now the end draws nigh, and by God's will    Old age's bound is reached: how have I spent    And with what fruit so wide a tract of days?    I wept in boyhood 'neath the sounding rod:    Youth's toga donned, the rhetorician's arts    I plied and with deceitful pleadings sinned:    Anon a wanton life and dalliance gross    (Alas! the recollection stings to shame!)    Fouled and polluted manhood's opening bloom:    And then the forum's strife my restless wits    Enthralled, and the keen lust of victory    Drove me to many a bitterness and fall.    Twice held I in fair cities of renown    The reins of office, and administered    To good men justice and to guilty doom.    At length the Emperor's will beneficent    Exalted me to military power    And to the rank that borders on the throne.    The years are speeding onward, and gray hairs    Of old have mantled o'er my brows    And Salia's consulship from memory dies.    What frost-bound winters since that natal year    Have fled, what vernal suns reclothed    The meads with roses,--this white crown declares.    Yet what avail the prizes or the blows    Of fortune, when the body's spark is quenched    And death annuls whatever state I held?    This sentence I must hear: \"Whate'er thou art,    Thy mind hath lost the world it loved: not God's    The things thou soughtest, Whose thou now shalt be.\"    Yet now, ere hence I pass, my sinning soul    Shall doff its folly and shall praise my Lord    If not by deeds, at least with humble lips.    Let each day link itself with grateful hymns    And every night re-echo songs of God:    Yea, be it mine to fight all heresies,    Unfold the meanings of the Catholic faith,    Trample on Gentile rites, thy gods, O Rome,    Dethrone, the Martyrs laud, th' Apostles sing.    O while such themes my pen and tongue employ,    May death strike off these fetters of the flesh    And bear me whither my last breath shall rise!                                 I. HYMNUS AD GALLI CANTUM          Ales diei nuntius    lucem propinquam praecinit;    nos excitator mentium    iam Christus ad vitam vocat.        Auferte, clamat, lectulos          5    aegros, soporos, desides:    castique recti ac sobrii    vigilate, iam sum proximus.        Post solis ortum fulgidi    serum est cubile spernere,          10    ni parte noctis addita    tempus labori adieceris.        Vox ista, qua strepunt aves    stantes sub ipso culmine    paulo ante quam lux emicet,         15    nostri figura est iudicis.        Tectos tenebris horridis    stratisque opertos segnibus    suadet quietem linquere    iam iamque venturo die.             20        Ut, cum coruscis flatibus    aurora caelum sparserit,    omnes labore exercitos    confirmet ad spem luminis.        Hic somnus ad tempus datus        25    est forma mortis perpetis,    peccata ceu nox horrida    cogunt iacere ac stertere.        Sed vox ab alto culmine    Christi docentis praemonet,         30    adesse iam lucem prope,    ne mens sopori serviat:        Ne somnus usque ad terminos    vitae socordis opprimat    pectus sepultum crimine             35    et lucis oblitum suae.        Ferunt vagantes daemonas    laetos tenebris noctium,    gallo canente exterritos    sparsim timere et cedere.           40        Invisa nam vicinitas    lucis, salutis, numinis    rupto tenebrarum situ    noctis fugat satellites.        Hoc esse signum praescii          45    norunt repromissae spei,    qua nos soporis liberi    speramus adventum Dei.        Quae vis sit huius alitis,    salvator ostendit Petro,            50    ter antequam gallus canat    sese negandum praedicans.        Fit namque peccatum prius,    quam praeco lucis proximae    inlustret humanum genus             55    finemque peccandi ferat.        Flevit negator denique    ex ore prolapsum nefas,    cum mens maneret innocens,    animusque servaret fidem.           60        Nec tale quidquam postea    linguae locutus lubrico est,    cantuque galli cognito    peccare iustus destitit.        Inde est quod omnes credimus,     65    illo quietis tempore    quo gallus exsultans canit    Christum redisse ex inferis.        Tunc mortis oppressus vigor,    tunc lex subacta est tartari,       70    tunc vis diei fortior    noctem coegit cedere.        Iam iam quiescant inproba,    iam culpa furva obdormiat,    iam noxa letalis suum               75    perpessa somnum marceat.        Vigil vicissim spiritus    quodcumque restat temporis,    dum meta noctis clauditur,    stans ac laborans excubet.          80        Iesum ciamus vocibus    flentes, precantes, sobrii:    intenta supplicatio    dormire cor mundum vetat.        Sat convolutis artubus            85    sensum profunda oblivio    pressit, gravavit, obruit    vanis vagantem somniis.        Sunt nempe falsa et frivola,    quae mundiali gloria                90    ceu dormientes egimus:    vigilemus, hic est veritas.        Aurum, voluptas, gaudium,    opes, honores, prospera,    quaecumque nos inflant mala,        95    fit mane, nil sunt omnia.        Tu, Christe, somnum dissice,    tu rumpe noctis vincula,    tu solve peccatum vetus    novumque lumen ingere.             100                                   I. HYMN AT COCK-CROW        Awake! the shining day is born!    The herald cock proclaims the morn:    And Christ, the soul's Awakener, cries,    Bidding us back to life arise.      Away the sluggard's bed! away    The slumber of the soul's decay!    Ye chaste and just and temperate,    Watch! I am standing at the gate.      After the sun hath risen red    'Tis late for men to scorn their bed,    Unless a portion of the night    They seize for labours of the light.      Mark ye, what time the dawn draws nigh,    How 'neath the eaves the swallows cry?    Know that by true similitude    Their notes our Judge's voice prelude.      When hid by shades of dark malign    On beds of softness we recline,    They call us forth with music clear    Warning us that the day is near.      When breezes bright of orient morn    With rosy hues the heavens adorn,    They cheer with hope of gladdening light    The hearts that spend in toil their might.      Though sleep be but a passing guest    'Tis type of death's perpetual rest:    Our sins are as a ghastly night,    And seal with slumbers deep our sight.      But from the wide roof of the sky    Christ's voice peals forth with urgent cry,    Calling our sleep-bound hearts to rise    And greet the dawn with wakeful eyes.      He bids us fear lest sensual ease    Unto life's end the spirit seize    And in the tomb of shame us bind,    Till we are to the true light blind.      'Tis said that baleful spirits roam    Abroad beneath the dark's vast dome;    But, when the cock crows, take their flight    Sudden dispersed in sore affright.      For the foul votaries of the night    Abhor the coming of the light,    And shamed before salvation's grace    The hosts of darkness hide their face.      They know the cock doth prophesy    Of Hope's long-promised morning sky,    When comes the Majesty Divine    Upon awakened worlds to shine.      The Lord to Peter once foretold    What meaning that shrill strain should hold,    How he before cock-cr"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14969"],[0,"Three Contributions to the Theory of Sex (#1)"],[1,"AND MENTAL DISEASE MONOGRAPH SERIES NO. 7    THREE CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE THEORY OF SEX    _SECOND EDITION_  _SECOND REPRINTING_    BY    PROF.

THE TRANSFORMATION OF PUBERTY                             68          INTRODUCTION TO TRANSLATION      The somewhat famous \"Three Essays,\" which Dr. Brill is here bringing to  the attention of an English-reading public, occupy--brief as they  are--an important position among the achievements of their author, a  great investigator and pioneer in an important line. It is not claimed  that the facts here gathered are altogether new. The subject of the  sexual instinct and its aberrations has long been before the scientific  world and the names of many effective toilers in this vast field are  known to every student. When one passes beyond the strict domains of  science and considers what is reported of the sexual life in folkways  and art-lore and the history of primitive culture and in romance, the  sources of information are immense. Freud has made considerable  additions to this stock of knowledge, but he has done also something of  far greater consequence than this. He has worked out, with incredible  penetration, the part which this instinct plays in every phase of human  life and in the development of human character, and has been able to  establish on a firm footing the remarkable thesis that psychoneurotic  illnesses never occur with a perfectly normal sexual life. Other sorts  of emotions contribute to the result, but some aberration of the sexual  life is always present, as the cause of especially insistent emotions  and repressions.    The instincts with which every child is born furnish desires or cravings  which must be dealt with in some fashion. They may be refined  (\"sublimated\"), so far as is necessary and desirable, into energies of  other sorts--as happens readily with the play-instinct--or they may  remain as the source of perversions and inversions, and of cravings of  new sorts substituted for those of the more primitive kinds under the  pressure of a conventional civilization. The symptoms of the functional  psychoneuroses represent, after a fashion, some of these distorted  attempts to find a substitute for the imperative cravings born of the  sexual instincts, and their form often depends, in part at least, on the  peculiarities of the sexual life in infancy and early childhood. It is  Freud's service to have investigated this inadequately chronicled period  of existence with extraordinary acumen. In so doing he made it plain  that the \"perversions\" and \"inversions,\" which reappear later under such  striking shapes, belong to the normal sexual life of the young child and  are seen, in veiled forms, in almost every case of nervous illness.    It cannot too often be repeated that these discoveries represent no  fanciful deductions, but are the outcome of rigidly careful observations  which any one who will sufficiently prepare himself can verify. Critics  fret over the amount of \"sexuality\" that Freud finds evidence of in the  histories of his patients, and assume that he puts it there. But such  criticisms are evidences of misunderstandings and proofs of ignorance.    Freud had learned that the amnesias of hypnosis and of hysteria were not  absolute but relative and that in covering the lost memories, much more,  of unexpected sort, was often found. Others, too, had gone as far as  this, and stopped. But this investigator determined that nothing but the  absolute impossibility of going further should make him cease from  urging his patients into an inexorable scrutiny of the unconscious  regions of their memories and thoughts, such as never had been made  before. Every species of forgetfulness, even the forgetfulness of  childhood's years, was made to yield its hidden stores of knowledge;  dreams, even though apparently absurd, were found to be interpreters of  a varied class of thoughts, active, although repressed as out of harmony  with the selected life of consciousness; layer after layer, new sets of  motives underlying motives were laid bare, and each patient's interest  was strongly enlisted in the task of learning to know himself in order  more truly and wisely to \"sublimate\" himself. Gradually other workers  joined patiently in this laborious undertaking, which now stands, for  those who have taken pains to comprehend it, as by far the most  important movement in psychopathology.    It must, however, be recognized that these essays, of which Dr. Brill  has given a translation that cannot but be timely, concern a subject  which is not only important but unpopular. Few physicians read the works  of v. Krafft-Ebing, Magnus Hirschfeld, Moll, and others of like sort.  The remarkable volumes of Havelock Ellis were refused publication in his  native England. The sentiments which inspired this hostile attitude  towards the study of the sexual life are still active, though growing  steadily less common. One may easily believe that if the facts which  Freud's truth-seeking researches forced him to recognize and to publish  had not been of an unpopular sort, his rich and abundant contributions  to observational psychology, to the significance of dreams, to the  etiology and therapeutics of the psychoneuroses, to the interpretation  of mythology, would have won for him, by universal acclaim, the same  recognition among all physicians that he has received from a rapidly  increasing band of followers and colleagues.    May Dr. Brill's translation help toward this end.    There are two further points on which some comments should be made. The  first is this, that those who conscientiously desire to learn all that  they can from Freud's remarkable contributions should not be content to  read any one of them alone. His various publications, such as \"The  Selected Papers on Hysteria and Other Psychoneuroses,\"[1] \"The  Interpretation of Dreams,\"[2] \"The Psychopathology of Everyday Life,\"[3]  \"Wit and its Relation to the Unconscious,\"[4] the analysis of the case  of the little boy called Hans, the study of Leonardo da Vinci,[4a] and  the various short essays in the four Sammlungen kleiner Schriften, not  only all hang together, but supplement each other to a remarkable  extent. Unless a course of study such as this is undertaken many critics  may think various statements and inferences in this volume to be far  fetched or find them too obscure for comprehension.    The other point is the following: One frequently hears the  psychoanalytic method referred to as if it was customary for those  practicing it to exploit the sexual experiences of"]]]
