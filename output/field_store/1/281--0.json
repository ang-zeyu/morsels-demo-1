PREFACE    Although eleven years have elapsed since Mr. Froude's death, no  biography of him has, so far as I know, appeared. This book is an  attempt to tell the public something about a man whose writings have  a permanent place in the literature of England.    It is a pleasure to acknowledge my obligation to Miss Margaret  Froude for having allowed me the use of such written material as  existed. A large number of Mr. Froude's letters were destroyed after  his death, and it was not intended by the family that any biography  of him should be written. Finding that I was engaged upon the task,  Miss Froude supplied those facts, dates, and papers which were  essential to the accuracy of the narrative. Mr. Froude's niece, Mrs.  St. Leger Harrison, known to the world as Lucas Malet, has allowed  me to use some of her uncle's letters to her mother.    Lady Margaret Cecil has, with great kindness, permitted me to make  copious extracts from Mr. Froude's letters to her mother, the late  Countess of Derby. I must also express my gratitude to Sir Thomas  Sanderson, Lord Derby's executor, to Cardinal Newman's literary  representative Mr. Edward Bellasis, and to Mr. Arthur Clough, son of  Froude's early friend the poet.    Mr. James Rye, of Balliol College, Oxford, placed at my disposal,  with singular generosity, the results of his careful examination  into the charges made against Mr. Froude by Mr. Freeman.    The Rector of Exeter was good enough to show me the entries in the  college books bearing upon Mr. Froude's resignation of his  Fellowship, and to tell me everything he knew on the subject.    My indebtedness to the late Sir John Skelton's delightful book,  The Table Talk of Shirley, will be obvious to my readers.    I have, in conclusion, to thank my old friend Mr. Birrell, for  lending me his very rare copy of the funeral sermon preached by  Mr. Froude at Torquay.    October 30, 1905.      CHAPTER I    CHILDHOOD    IN reading biographies I always skip the genealogical details. To  be born obscure and to die famous has been described as the acme of  human felicity. However that may be, whether fame has anything to do  with happiness or no, it is a man himself, and not his ancestors,  whose life deserves, if it does deserve, to be written. Such was  Froude's own opinion, and it is the opinion of most sensible people.  Few, indeed, are the families which contain more than one remarkable  figure, and this is the rock upon which the hereditary principle  always in practice breaks. For human lineage is not subject to the  scientific tests which alone could give it solid value as positive  or negative evidence. There is nothing to show from what source,  other than the ultimate source of every good and perfect gift,  Froude derived his brilliant and splendid powers. He was a gentleman,  and he did not care to find or make for himself a pedigree. He knew  that the Froudes had been settled in Devonshire time out of mind as  yeomen with small estates, and that one of them, to whom his own  father always referred with contempt, had bought from the Heralds'  College what Gibbon calls the most useless of all coats, a coat  of arms. Froude's grandfather did a more sensible thing by marrying  an heiress, a Devonshire heiress, Miss Hurrell, and thereby doubling  his possessions. Although he died before he was five-and-twenty, he  left four children behind him, and his only son was the  historian's father.    James Anthony Froude, known as Anthony to those who called him by  his Christian name, was born at Dartington, two miles from Totnes,  on St. George's Day, Shakespeare's birthday, the 23rd of April,  1818. His father, who had taken a pass degree at Oxford, and had  then taken orders, was by that time Rector of Dartington and  Archdeacon of Totnes. Archdeacon Froude belonged to a type of  clergyman now almost extinct in the Church of England, though with  strong idiosyncrasies of his own. Orthodox without being spiritual,  he was a landowner as well as a parson, a high and dry Churchman, an  active magistrate, a zealous Tory, with a solid and unclerical  income of two or three thousand a year. He was a personage in the  county, as well as a dignitary of the Church. Every one in Devonshire  knew the name of Froude, if only from \"Parson Froude,\" no  credit to his cloth, who appears as Parson Chowne in Blackmore's  once popular novel, The Maid of Sker. But the Archdeacon was a man  of blameless life, and not in the least like Parson Froude. A hard  rider and passionately fond of hunting, he was a good judge of a  horse and usually the best mounted man in the field. One of his  exploits as an undergraduate was to jump the turnpike gate on the  Abingdon road with pennies under his seat, between his knees and the  saddle, and between his feet and the stirrups, without dropping one.    Although he had been rather extravagant and something of a dandy, he  was able to say that he could account for every sixpence he spent  after the age of twenty-one. On leaving Oxford he settled down to  the life of a country parson with conscientious thoroughness, and  was reputed the best magistrate in the South Hams. Farming his own  glebe, as he did, with skill and knowledge, perpetually occupied, as  he was, with clerical or secular business, he found the Church of  England, not then disturbed by any wave of enthusiasm, at once  necessary and sufficient to his religious sense. His horror of  Nonconformists was such that he would not have a copy of The  Pilgrim's Progress in his house. He upheld the Bishop and all  established institutions, believing that the way to heaven was to  turn to the right and go straight on. There were many such  clergymen in his day.    In appearance he was a cold, hard, stern man, despising sentiment,  reticent and self-restrained. But beneath the surface there lay deep  emotions and an aesthetic sense, of which his drawings were the only  outward sign. To these sketches he himself attached no value. \"You  can buy better at the nearest shop for sixpence,\" he would say, if  he heard them praised. Yet good judges of art compared them with the  early sketches of Turner, and Ruskin afterwards gave them  enthusiastic praise. Mr. Froude had married, when quite a young man,  Margaret Spedding, the daughter of an old college friend, from  Armathwaite in Cumberland. Her nephew is known as the prince of  Baconian scholars and the J. S. of Tennyson's poem. She was a woman  of great beauty, deeply religious, belonging to a family more  strongly given to letters and to science than the Froudes, whose  tastes were rather for the active life of sport and adventure. One  can imagine the Froudes of the sixteenth century manning the ships  of Queen Bess and sailing with Frobisher or Drake. For many years  Mrs. Froude was the mistress of a happy home, the mother of many  handsome sons and fair daughters. The two eldest, Hurrell and  Robert, were especially striking, brilliant lads, popular at Eton,  their father's companions in the hunting-field or on the moors. But  in Dartington Rectory, with all its outward signs of prosperity and  welfare, there were the seeds of death. Before Anthony Froude, the  youngest of eight, was three years old, his mother died of a  decline, and within a few years the same illness proved fatal to  five of her children. The whole aspect of life at Dartington was  changed. The Archdeacon retired into himself and nursed his grief in  silence, melancholy, isolated, austere.    This irreparable calamity was made by circumstances doubly  calamitous. Though destined to survive all his brothers and sisters,  Anthony was a weak, sickly child, not considered never heard the  mention of his mother's name, or was the Archdeacon himself capable  of showing any tenderness whatever. In place of a mother the little  boy had an aunt, who applied to him principles of Spartan severity.  At the mature age of three he was ducked every morning at a trough,  to harden him, in the ice-cold water from a spring, and whenever he  was naughty he was whipped. It may have been from this unpleasant  discipline that he derived the contempt for self-indulgence, and the  indifference to pain, which distinguished him in after life. On the  other hand, he was allowed to read what he liked, and devoured  Grimm's Tales, The Seven Champions of Christendom, and The Arabian  Nights. He was an imaginative and reflective child, full of the  wonder in which philosophy begins.    The boy felt from the first the romantic beauty of his home.  Dartington Rectory, some two miles from Totnes, is surrounded by  woods which overhang precipitously the clear waters of the River  Dart. Dartington Hall, which stood near the rectory, is one of the  oldest houses in England, originally built before the Conquest, and  completed with great magnificence in the reign of Richard II. The  vast banqueting-room was, in the nineteenth century, a ruin, and  open to the sky. The remains of the old quadrangle were a treasure  to local antiquaries, and the whole place was full of charm for an  imaginative boy. Mr. Champernowne, the owner, was an intimate friend  of the Archdeacon, to whom he left the guardianship of his children,  so that the Froudes were as much at home in their squire's house as  in the parsonage itself. Although most of his brothers and sisters  were too old to be his companions, the group in which his first  years were passed was an unusually spirited and vivacious one.  Newman, who was one of Hurrell's visitors from Oxford, has described  the young girls \"blooming and in high spirits,\" full of gaiety and charm.*    --  * Newman's Letters and Correspondence, ii. 73.  --    The Froudes were a remarkable family. They had strong characters  and decided tastes, but they had not their father's conventionality  and preference for the high roads of life.

SACRED SONGS OF THE ANCIENT MEXICANS,  WITH A GLOSS IN NAHUATL.    EDITED, WITH A PARAPHRASE, NOTES AND  VOCABULARY,    BY  DANIEL G. BRINTON    1890          PREFACE.    In accordance with the general object of this series of volumes--which  is to furnish materials for study rather than to offer completed  studies--I have prepared for this number the text of the most ancient  authentic record of American religious lore. From its antiquity and  character, I have ventured to call this little collection the RIG VEDA  AMERICANUS, after the similar cyclus of sacred hymns, which are the most  venerable product of the Aryan mind.    As for my attempted translation of these mystic chants I offer it with  the utmost reserve. It would be the height of temerity in me to pretend  to have overcome difficulties which one so familiar with the ancient  Nahuatl as Father Sahagun intimated were beyond his powers. All that I  hope to have achieved is, by the aid of the Gloss--and not always in  conformity to its suggestions--to give a general idea of the sense and  purport of the originals.    The desirability of preserving and publishing these texts seems to me to  be manifest. They reveal to us the undoubtedly authentic spirit of the  ancient religion; they show us the language in its most archaic form;  they preserve references to various mythical cycli of importance to the  historian; and they illustrate the alterations in the spoken tongue  adopted in the esoteric dialect of the priesthood. Such considerations  will, I trust, attract the attention of scholars to these fragments of a  lost literature.    In the appended Vocabulary I have inserted only those words and  expressions for which I can suggest correct--or, at least,  probable--renderings. Others will have to be left to future  investigators.          CONTENTS.      Preface    Introduction        I. Hymn of Huitzilopochtli       II. War Song of the Huitznahuac      III.

As in a previous number of the Library of Aboriginal American Literature  I have discussed in detail the character of the ancient Mexican poetry,  I shall confine myself at present to the history of the present  collection. We owe its preservation to the untiring industry of Father  Bernardino de Sahagun, one of the earliest missionaries to Mexico, and  the author of by far the most important work on the religion, manners  and customs of the ancient Mexicans.    By long residence and close application Sahagun acquired a complete  mastery of the Nahuatl tongue. He composed his celebrated _Historia de  las Cosas de la Nueva Espana_ primarily in the native language, and from  this original wrote out a Spanish translation, in some parts  considerably abbreviated. This incomplete reproduction is that which was  published in Spanish by Lord Kingsborough and Bustamente, and in a  French rendering with useful notes by Dr. Jourdanet and M. Remi Simeon.    So far as I know, the only complete copy of the Nahuatl original now in  existence is that preserved in the Bibliotheca Laurentio-Mediceana in  Florence, where I examined it in April, 1889. It is a most elaborate and  beautiful MS., in three large volumes, containing thirteen hundred and  seventy-eight illustrations, carefully drawn by hand, mostly colored,  illustrative of the native mythology, history, arts and usages, besides  many elaborate head and tail pieces to the chapters.    There is another Nahuatl MS. of Sahagun's history in the private  library of the King of Spain at Madrid, which I examined in May, 1888,  and of which I published a collation in the _Memoires de la Societe  Internationale des Americanistes_, for that year. It is incomplete,  embracing only the first six books of the _Historia_, and should be  considered merely as a _borrador_ or preliminary sketch for the  Florentine copy. It contains, however, a certain amount of material not  included in the latter, and has been peculiarly useful to me in the  preparation of the present volume, as not only affording another reading  of the text, valuable for comparison, but as furnishing a gloss or  Nahuatl paraphrase of most of the hymns, which does not appear in the  Florentine MS. As evidently the older of the two, I have adopted the  readings of the Madrid MS. as my text, and given the variants of the  Florentine MS. at the end of each hymn.    Neither MS. attempts any translation of the hymns. That at Madrid has no  Spanish comment whatever, while that at Florence places opposite the  hymns the following remarks, which are also found in the printed copies,  near the close of the Appendix of the Second Book of the _Historia_:--    \"It is an old trick of our enemy the Devil to try to conceal himself in  order the better to compass his ends, in accordance with the words of  the Gospel, 'He whose deeds are evil, shuns the light.' Also on earth  this enemy of ours has provided himself with a dense wood and a ground,  rough and filled with abysses, there to prepare his wiles and to escape  pursuit, as do wild beasts and venomous serpents. This wood and these  abysses are the songs which he has inspired for his service to be sung  in his honor within the temples and outside of them; for they are so  artfully composed that they say what they will, but disclose only what  the Devil commands, not being rightly understood except by those to whom  they are addressed. It is, in fact, well recognized that the cave, wood  or abysses in which this cursed enemy hides himself, are these songs or  chants which he himself composed, and which are sung to him without  being understood except by those who are acquainted with this sort of  language. The consequence is that they sing what they please, war or  peace, praise to the Devil or contempt for Christ, and they cannot in  the least be understood by other men.\"    Lord Kingsborough says in a note in his voluminous work on the  _Antiquities of Mexico_ that this portion of Sahagun's text was  destroyed by order of the Inquisition, and that there was a memorandum  to that effect in the Spanish original in the noble writer's possession.  This could scarcely have referred to a translation of the hymns, for  none such exists in any MS. I have consulted, or heard of; and Sahagun  intimates in the passage quoted above that he had made none, on account  of the obscurity of the diction. Neither does any appear in the  Florentine MS., where the text of the hymns is given in full, although  the explanatory Gloss is omitted. This last-mentioned fact has prevented  me from correcting the text of the Gloss, which in some passages is  manifestly erroneous; but I have confined myself to reproducing it  strictly according to the original MS., leaving its correction to those  who will make use of it.    The Florentine MS. has five colored illustrations of the divinities, or  their symbols, which are spoken of in the chants. These are probably  copied from the native hieroglyphic books in which, as we learn from  Sahagun, such ancient songs were preserved and transmitted. These  illustrations I had copied with scrupulous fidelity and reproduced by  one of the photographic processes, for the present work.    Such is the history of this curious document, and with this brief  introduction I submit it to those who will have the patience and skill  to unravel its manifold difficulties.
