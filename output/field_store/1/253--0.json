Before her and behind her  stretched the plain, covered with red sand and thorny karoo bushes; and  here and there a milk-bush, looking like a bundle of pale green rods  tied together. Not a tree was to be seen anywhere, except on the banks  of the river, and that was far away, and the sun beat on her head. Round  her fed the Angora goats she was herding; pretty things, especially the  little ones, with white silky curls that touched the ground. But Jannita  sat crying. If an angel should gather up in his cup all the tears that  have been shed, I think the bitterest would be those of children.    By and by she was so tired, and the sun was so hot, she laid her head  against the milk-bush, and dropped asleep.    She dreamed a beautiful dream. She thought that when she went back to  the farmhouse in the evening, the walls were covered with vines and  roses, and the kraals were not made of red stone, but of lilac trees  full of blossom. And the fat old Boer smiled at her; and the stick he  held across the door, for the goats to jump over, was a lily rod with  seven blossoms at the end. When she went to the house her mistress gave  her a whole roaster-cake for her supper, and the mistress's daughter  had stuck a rose in the cake; and her mistress's son-in-law said, \"Thank  you!\" when she pulled off his boots, and did not kick her.    It was a beautiful dream.    While she lay thus dreaming, one of the little kids came and licked her  on her cheek, because of the salt from her dried-up tears. And in her  dream she was not a poor indentured child any more, living with Boers.  It was her father who kissed her. He said he had only been asleep--that  day when he lay down under the thorn-bush; he had not really died. He  felt her hair, and said it was grown long and silky, and he said they  would go back to Denmark now. He asked her why her feet were bare, and  what the marks on her back were. Then he put her head on his shoulder,  and picked her up, and carried her away, away! She laughed--she could  feel her face against his brown beard. His arms were so strong.    As she lay there dreaming, with the ants running over her naked feet,  and with her brown curls lying in the sand, a Hottentot came up to her.  He was dressed in ragged yellow trousers, and a dirty shirt, and torn  jacket. He had a red handkerchief round his head, and a felt hat above  that. His nose was flat, his eyes like slits, and the wool on his head  was gathered into little round balls. He came to the milk-bush, and  looked at the little girl lying in the hot sun. Then he walked off, and  caught one of the fattest little Angora goats, and held its mouth fast,  as he stuck it under his arm. He looked back to see that she was still  sleeping, and jumped down into one of the sluits. He walked down the bed  of the sluit a little way and came to an overhanging bank, under which,  sitting on the red sand, were two men. One was a tiny, ragged, old  bushman, four feet high; the other was an English navvy, in a dark  blue blouse. They cut the kid's throat with the navvy's long knife, and  covered up the blood with sand, and buried the entrails and skin. Then  they talked, and quarrelled a little; and then they talked quietly  again.    The Hottentot man put a leg of the kid under his coat and left the rest  of the meat for the two in the sluit, and walked away.    When little Jannita awoke it was almost sunset. She sat up very  frightened, but her goats were all about her. She began to drive them  home. \"I do not think there are any lost,\" she said.    Dirk, the Hottentot, had brought his flock home already, and stood at  the kraal door with his ragged yellow trousers. The fat old Boer put his  stick across the door, and let Jannita's goats jump over, one by one. He  counted them. When the last jumped over: \"Have you been to sleep today?\"  he said; \"there is one missing.\"    Then little Jannita knew what was coming, and she said, in a low voice,  \"No.\" And then she felt in her heart that deadly sickness that you feel  when you tell a lie; and again she said, \"Yes.\"    \"Do you think you will have any supper this evening?\" said the Boer.    \"No,\" said Jannita.    \"What do you think you will have?\"    \"I don't know,\" said Jannita.    \"Give me your whip,\" said the Boer to Dirk, the Hottentot.    *****    The moon was all but full that night. Oh, but its light was beautiful!    The little girl crept to the door of the outhouse where she slept, and  looked at it. When you are hungry, and very, very sore, you do not  cry. She leaned her chin on one hand, and looked, with her great dove's  eyes--the other hand was cut open, so she wrapped it in her pinafore.  She looked across the plain at the sand and the low karoo-bushes, with  the moonlight on them.    Presently, there came slowly, from far away, a wild springbuck. It  came close to the house, and stood looking at it in wonder, while  the moonlight glinted on its horns, and in its great eyes. It stood  wondering at the red brick walls, and the girl watched it. Then,  suddenly, as if it scorned it all, it curved its beautiful back and  turned; and away it fled over the bushes and sand, like a sheeny streak  of white lightning. She stood up to watch it. So free, so free! Away,  away! She watched, till she could see it no more on the wide plain.    Her heart swelled, larger, larger, larger: she uttered a low cry; and  without waiting, pausing, thinking, she followed on its track. Away,  away, away! \"I--I also!\" she said, \"I--I also!\"    When at last her legs began to tremble under her, and she stopped to  breathe, the house was a speck behind her. She dropped on the earth, and  held her panting sides.    She began to think now.    If she stayed on the plain they would trace her footsteps in the morning  and catch her; but if she waded in the water in the bed of the river  they would not be able to find her footmarks; and she would hide, there  where the rocks and the kopjes were.    So she stood up and walked towards the river. The water in the river  was low; just a line of silver in the broad bed of sand, here and there  broadening into a pool. She stepped into it, and bathed her feet in the  delicious cold water. Up and up the stream she walked, where it rattled  over the pebbles, and past where the farmhouse lay; and where the rocks  were large she leaped from one to the other. The night wind in her face  made her strong--she laughed. She had never felt such night wind before.  So the night smells to the wild bucks, because they are free! A free  thing feels as a chained thing never can.    At last she came to a place where the willows grew on each side of the  river, and trailed their long branches on the sandy bed. She could not  tell why, she could not tell the reason, but a feeling of fear came over  her.    On the left bank rose a chain of kopjes and a precipice of rocks.  Between the precipice and the river bank there was a narrow path covered  by the fragments of fallen rock. And upon the summit of the precipice a  kippersol tree grew, whose palm-like leaves were clearly cut out against  the night sky. The rocks cast a deep shadow, and the willow trees, on  either side of the river. She paused, looked up and about her, and then  ran on, fearful.    \"What was I afraid of? How foolish I have been!\" she said, when she came  to a place where the trees were not so close together. And she stood  still and looked back and shivered.    At last her steps grew wearier and wearier. She was very sleepy now, she  could scarcely lift her feet. She stepped out of the river-bed. She only  saw that the rocks about her were wild, as though many little kopjes had  been broken up and strewn upon the ground, lay down at the foot of an  aloe, and fell asleep.    *****    But, in the morning, she saw what a glorious place it was. The rocks  were piled on one another, and tossed this way and that. Prickly  pears grew among them, and there were no less than six kippersol trees  scattered here and there among the broken kopjes. In the rocks there  were hundreds of homes for the conies, and from the crevices wild  asparagus hung down. She ran to the river, bathed in the clear cold  water, and tossed it over her head. She sang aloud. All the songs she  knew were sad, so she could not sing them now, she was glad, she was so  free; but she sang the notes without the words, as the cock-o-veets do.  Singing and jumping all the way, she went back, and took a sharp stone,  and cut at the root of a kippersol, and got out a large piece, as long  as her arm, and sat to chew it. Two conies came out on the rock above  her head and peeped at her. She held them out a piece, but they did not  want it, and ran away.    It was very delicious to her. Kippersol is like raw quince, when it is  very green; but she liked it. When good food is thrown at you by  other people, strange to say, it is very bitter; but whatever you find"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14586"],[0,"The Brain, A Decoded Enigma (#1)"],[1,"(C) 2004 by Dorin T.

As any scientific theory, it is a symbolic model. Any symbolic model is  based on a limited number of basic terms and a limited number of basic  relations between the basic terms.    For the basic terms and only for them, there are accepted descriptive  definitions. All the others terms are generated by the model, together  with their normal definitions. These definitions are  generated by the  model by logical and mathematical procedures.    These are the basic characteristics of any scientific theory and so, I  follow the procedures described above, to make a theory on the basic  hardware functions of the brain.    This theory is in a total opposition with all the actual sciences  associated with the functions of the brain. The present sciences,  associated with the functions of the brain, are not based on a single  fundamental model. In this way, as my theory will be accepted, all what  it was already written in the actual sciences associated with the  functions of the brain, have to be re-written or forgotten.    This attempt of total revolution is necessary because the actual  sciences on the brain don't use normal definitions of the terms; there  are only descriptions associated with them. Because the definitions of  the terms are not generated by a single fundamental model, the logical  corelation between them is not possible. So, the actual sciences  associated with the brain cannot evolve to become positive science  anymore.    In psychology, for instance, about any scientist has his/her own list  of descriptive definition associated with the terms used by him/her. In  this way,  it is not possible to make a logical structure to integrate  all the terms used in that field. So, the psychology, for instance, is  not a positive science.    Another example:  Let's consider a classical positive science, as Newton's Mechanics is.  In this symbolic model, all terms have exactly the same definition for  all the scientists. These definition are not changed since 340 years  ago when they were generated by the symbolic model of Mechanics. For  instance, the term \"speed\" is defined as v=s/t. That is, \"speed\" means  that the \"space\" is divided by \"time\". This definition is a normal  definition generated by the symbolic model of Mechanics not a  descriptive definition.    Let's suppose now that a symbolic model associated with the basic  hardware function of the brain is already created or it will be  created. The first consequence is that all the terms used in  association with the functions of the brain will be generated by the  model by logical and mathematical procedures, together with their  normal definitions. There is no reason to suppose that any descriptive  definition which is already used in the present  sciences of the brain  will be compatible with the definitions generated by that symbolic  model.    So, all what is already created in the present sciences associated with  the brain has to be re-written or forgotten.    Regardless of the fact that MDT theory will be accepted or not, a  symbolic model which covers the basic hardware function of the brain  will produce this total revolution in all the sciences associated with  the brain, including psychology, psychiatry, gnoseology, epistemology,  many parts of social sciences and so on.    Let's consider that a symbolic model to cover the basic functions of  the brain is created and is already accepted. The persons who already  work in these fields have to re-start everything about from zero. Their  opposition  will be enormous and I have no illusion in this direction.    This theory was created about 10 years ago. Based on my personal  experience, the theory is easily understood by persons  with special  orientation on positive sciences, including children's over 12 years  old. Also, the persons who already work with symbolic models  (mathematicians, physicists, engineers and so on) have a high capacity  to understand it.    Let's see what MDT offers.    First of all, MDT treats the brain as a device which processes the  information. In this way, MDT has no direct connection with the  medicine.    MDT is concerning only with the basic functions associated with  information processing and it is not interested by problems as \"what  part of the brain is doing something\" or \"how a function is  implemented\". MDT is a theory associated with the processing of the  information and so it has no direct interference with the hardware  implementation of the physical brain.    As a symbolic model associated with the basic function of the brain,  it generates precise definition, based on logic, of all the terms used  in association with the basic hardware functions of the brain. In this  way, all the terms are logical correlated between them.    Examples: MDT generates normal definitions for: knowledge,  consciousness, to imagine, to think, intelligence, emotion, to be  irritate, love, happiness and many others. E.g. the \"consciousness\" is  the facility of a brain to make and operate a model which contains the  being itself as an element. MDT defines, than, 6 different types of  consciousness which are, of course, defined in the same precise way.  Even more, based on MDT, it is possible to design a logical structure  to implement the function called \"consciousness\".    MDT explains the basic functions of the brain up to the level to make a  logical design to synthesize all the brain's functions (human or  animal). Of course, a technological implementation of that functions is  not possible now because the computers, for example, have yet a very  low power to process  the information and this situation will last, I  think, at least in the next 25 years.    In fact, the brain is treated by MDT as a technological product. So,  there are defined the main design goals and also, the main deficiencies  (by design or given by technological implementation).    There is analyzed the problem if, by evolution, it is possible or not  to evolve from animal brain to human brain.    There are analyzed the design and technological problems, including the  functional illnesses of the brains.    The theory treats also the paranormal phenomenon and suggest some  methods to develop such activities.    The Application section (ETAs) contains also many items as a history of  the evolution of the brain, the evaluation of the problems of  psychological tests and performance tests for a brain, some problems  associated with the present and future levels of evolution of the  brain, some long range problems associated with the development of the  human society (including the terrorism) and many others.    The basic elements of MDT occurs in 1993 and the first written form (on  WEB) in 1997. In 2003 a printed edition of the theory was published (in  Romanian language) by the Romanian Publishing House \"Editura Albastra\"  and in 2004, in the frame of Gutenberg Project, a new edition also in  Romanian.
