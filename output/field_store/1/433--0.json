Preface.      Of all the chapters of history, there are few more interesting or  wonderful than that which tells the story of the rise and progress of  Venice. Built upon a few sandy islands in a shallow lagoon, and  originally founded by fugitives from the mainland, Venice became one of  the greatest and most respected powers of Europe. She was mistress of  the sea; conquered and ruled over a considerable territory bordering on  the Adriatic; checked the rising power of the Turks; conquered  Constantinople; successfully defied all the attacks of her jealous  rivals to shake her power; and carried on a trade relatively as great  as that of England in the present day. I have laid my story in the time  not of the triumphs of Venice, but of her hardest struggle for  existence--when she defended herself successfully against the coalition  of Hungary, Padua, and Genoa--for never at any time were the virtues of  Venice, her steadfastness, her patriotism, and her willingness to make  all sacrifice for her independence, more brilliantly shown. The  historical portion of the story is drawn from Hazlitt's History of the  Republic of Venice, and with it I have woven the adventures of an  English boy, endowed with a full share of that energy and pluck which,  more than any other qualities, have made the British empire the  greatest the world has ever seen.    G. A. Henty.        Chapter 1: Venice.      \"I suppose you never have such nights as these in that misty island of  yours, Francisco?\"    \"Yes, we have,\" the other said stoutly. \"I have seen just as bright  nights on the Thames. I have stood down by Paul's Stairs and watched  the reflection of the moon on the water, and the lights of the houses  on the bridge, and the passing boats, just as we are doing now.    \"But,\" he added honestly, \"I must confess that we do not have such  still, bright nights very often, while with you they are the rule,  though sometimes even here a mist rises up and dims the water, just as  it does with us.\"    \"But I have heard you say that the stars are not so bright as we have  them here.\"    \"No, I do not think they are, Matteo. I do not remember now, but I do  know, when I first came here, I was struck with the brightness of the  stars, so I suppose there must have been a difference.\"    \"But you like this better than England? You are glad that your father  came out here?\"    Francis Hammond did not answer at once.    \"I am glad he came out,\" he said after a pause, \"because I have seen  many things I should never have seen if I had stayed at home, and I  have learned to speak your tongue. But I do not know that I like it  better than home. Things are different, you see. There was more fun at  home. My father had two or three apprentices, whom I used to play with  when the shop was closed, and there were often what you would call  tumults, but which were not serious. Sometimes there would be a fight  between the apprentices of one ward and another. A shout would be  raised of 'Clubs!' and all the 'prentices would catch up their sticks  and pour out of the shops, and then there would be a fight till the  city guard turned out and separated them. Then there used to be the  shooting at the butts, and the shows, and the Mayday revels, and all  sorts of things. The people were more merry than you are here, and much  more free. You see, the barons, who are the same to us that your great  families are to you, had no influence in the city. You are a nation of  traders, and so are we; but in London the traders have the power, and  are absolute masters inside their own walls, caring nothing for the  barons, and not much for the king. If anyone did wrong he got an open  and fair trial. There was no fear of secret accusations. Everyone  thought and said as he pleased. There was no Lion's Mouth, and no  Council of Ten.\"    \"Hush! hush! Francisco,\" the other said, grasping his arm. \"Do not say  a word against the council. There is no saying who may be listening.\"    And he looked nervously round to see if anyone was within earshot.    \"There it is, you see,\" his companion said. \"So long as we have a safe  conscience, in London we are frightened at nothing, whereas here no one  can say with certainty that he may not, before tomorrow morning, be  lying in the dungeons of St. Mark, without the slightest idea in the  world as to what his crime has been.\"    \"There, there, Francisco,\" Matteo said uneasily. \"Do talk about other  things. Your notions may do very well in England, but are not safe to  discuss here. Of course there are plenty here who would gladly see a  change in some matters, but one cannot have everything; and, after all,  when one has so much to be proud of, one need not grumble because  everything is not just as one would like.\"    \"Yes, you have much to be proud of,\" Francis Hammond agreed. \"It is  marvellous that the people of these scattered islets should be masters  of the sea, that their alliance should be coveted by every power in  Europe, that they should be the greatest trading community in the  world. If I were not English I should like to be Venetian.\"    The speakers were standing at the edge of the water in front of the  Palace of St. Mark. In the piazza behind them a throng of people were  walking to and fro, gossiping over the latest news from Constantinople,  the last rumour as to the doings of the hated rival of Venice, Genoa,  or the purport of the letter which had, as everyone knew, been brought  by the Bishop of Treviso from the pope to the seignory.    The moon was shining brightly overhead, and glittering in the waters of  the lagoon, which were broken into innumerable little wavelets by the  continual crossing and recrossing of the gondolas dotting its surface.  There was a constant arrival and departure of boats from the steps,  fifty yards to the right of the spot where the speakers were standing;  but where they had stationed themselves, about halfway between the  landing steps and the canal running down by the side of the ducal  palace, there were but few people about.    Francis Hammond was a lad between fifteen and sixteen years old. His  father was a merchant of London. He was a man of great enterprise and  energy, and had four years before determined to leave his junior  partner in charge of the business in London, and to come out himself  for a time to Venice, so as to buy the Eastern stuffs in which he dealt  at the headquarters of the trade, instead of paying such prices as the  agents of the Venetian traders might demand in London.    He had succeeded beyond his expectations. In Venice there were  constantly bargains to be purchased from ships returning laden with the  spoils of some captured Genoese merchantman, or taken in the sack of  some Eastern seaport. The prices, too, asked by the traders with the  towns of Syria or the Black Sea, were but a fraction of those charged  when these goods arrived in London. It was true that occasionally some  of his cargoes were lost on the homeward voyage, captured either by the  Genoese or the Moorish pirates; but even allowing for this, the profits  of the trade were excellent.    The English merchant occupied a good position in Venice. The promptness  of his payments, and the integrity of his dealings, made him generally  respected; and the fact that he was engaged in trade was no drawback to  his social position, in a city in which, of all others, trade was  considered honourable, and where members of even the most aristocratic  families were, with scarcely an exception, engaged in commerce. There  were many foreign merchants settled in Venice, for from the first the  republic had encouraged strangers to take up their residence there, and  had granted them several privileges and advantages.    Between Venice and England there had always been good feeling. Although  jealous of foreigners, England had granted the Venetians liberty to  trade in London, Southampton, and some other towns as far back as the  year 1304; and their relations had always been cordial, as there were  no grounds for jealousy or rivalry between the two peoples; whereas the  interference of France, Germany, Austria, and Hungary in the affairs of  Italy, had frequently caused uneasiness to Venice, and had on several  occasions embroiled her with one or other of the three last named  powers. France had as yet taken a very minor part in the continual wars  which were waged between the rival cities of Italy, and during the  Crusades there had been a close alliance between her and Venice, the  troops of the two nations fighting together at the siege of  Constantinople, and causing the temporary overthrow of the Greek Empire  of the East.    The rise of Venice had been rapid, and she owed her advancement to a  combination of circumstances. In the first place, her insular position  rendered her almost impervious to attack, and she had therefore no  occasion to keep on foot any army, and was able to throw all her  strength on to the sea, where Genoa was her only formidable rival. In  the second place, her mercantile spirit, and her extensive trade with  the East, brought in a steady influx of wealth, and her gold enabled  her to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17567"],[0,"The Way of the Wild (#1)"],[1,"[Frontispiece: \"Jaws, monstrous and wet, grabbing at him in enraged  confusion\"]              THE WAY OF THE WILD      BY    F.

But not all the crossing in the world could have accounted for  his character; that came straight from the Devil, his master.  Gulo,  however, was not a cross.  He was himself, Gulo, the wolverine, _alias_  glutton, _alias_ carcajou, _alias_ quick-hatch, _alias_ fjeldfras in  the vernacular, or, officially, _Gulo luscus_.  But, by whatever name  you called him, he did not smell sweet; and his character, too, was of  a bad odor.  A great man once said that he was like a bear cub with a  superadded tail; but that great man cannot have seen his face.  If he  had, he would have looked for his double among the fiends on the top of  Notre Dame.  There was, in fact, nothing like him on this earth, only  in a very hot place not on the earth.    He was, in short, a beast with brains that only man, and no beast,  ought to be trusted with; and he had no soul.  God alone knows if love,  which softens most creatures, had ever come to Gulo; his behavior  seemed to show that it had not.  Perhaps love was afraid of him.  And,  upon my soul, I don't wonder.    It was not, however, a hot, but a very cold, place in the pine-forest  where Gulo stood, and the unpitying moon cast a dainty tracery through  the tasseled roof upon the new and glistening snow around him--the snow  that comes early to those parts--and the north-east wind cut like  several razors.  But Gulo did not seem to care.  Wrapped up in his  ragged, long, untidy, uncleanly-looking, brown-black cloak--just his  gray-sided, black fiend's face poking out--he seemed warm enough.  When  he lifted one paw to scratch, one saw that the murderous, scraping,  long claws of him were nearly white; and as he set his lips in a  devilish grin, his fangs glistened white in the moonlight, too.    Verily, this was no beast--he would have taped four feet and a quarter  from tip to tip, if you had worn chain-mail and dared to measure  him--no beast, I say, to handle with white-kid ball gloves.  Things  were possible from him, one felt, that were not possible of any other  living creature--awful things.    Suddenly he looked up.  The branches above him had stirred uneasily, as  if an army were asleep there.  And an army was--of wood-pigeons.  Thousands upon thousands of wood-pigeons were asleep above his head,  come from Heaven knows where, going to--who could tell in the end?    All at once one fell.  Without apparent reason or cause, it fell.  And  the wolverine, with his quick, intelligent eyes, watched it fall, from  branch to branch, turning over and over--oh! so softly--to the ground.  When he had poked his way to it--walking flat-footed, like a bear or a  railway porter--it was dead.  Slain in a breath!  Without a flutter,  killed!  By what?  By disease--diphtheria.  But not here would the  terrible drama be worked out.  This was but an isolated victim, first  of the thousands that would presently succumb to the fell disease far,  far over there, to the westward, hundreds of miles away, in England and  Wales, perhaps, whither they were probably bound.    But the poor starved corpse, choked to death in the end maybe, was of  no use to the wolverine.  As he sniffed it he found that out.  The  thing was wasted to the bones even.  And turning away from it--he  suddenly \"froze\" in his tracks where he stood.    One of those little wandering eddies which seem to meander about a  forest in an aimless sort of way, coming from and going now hither, as  if the breeze itself were lost among the still aisles, had touched his  wet muzzle; and its touch spelt--\"Man!\"    If it had been the taint of ten thousand deaths it could not have  affected him more.  He became a beast cast in old, old bronze, and as  hard as bronze; and when he moved, it was stiffly, and all bristly, and  on end.    Animals have no counting of time.  In the wild, things happen as  swiftly as a flash of light; or, perhaps, nothing happens at all for a  night, or a day, or half a week.  Therefore I do not know exactly how  long that wolverine was encircling that scent, and pinning it down to a  certain spot--himself unseen.  All animals, almost, can do that, but  none, not even the lynx or the wild cat, so well as the wolverine.  He  is the one mammal that, in the wild, is a name only--a name to conjure  with.    He found, in the end, that there was no man; but there _had_ been.  He  found--showing himself again now--that a man--a hunter, a trapper, one  after fur--had made himself here a _cache_, a store under the earth;  and--well, the wolverine's great, bear-like claws seemed made for  digging.    He dug--and, be sure, if there had been any danger there he would have  known it.  He dug like a North-Country miner, with swiftness and  precision, stopping every now and again to sit back on his haunches,  and, with humped shoulders, stare--scowl, I mean--round in his  lowering, low-browed fashion.    Once a bull-elk, nearly a six-footer, but he loomed large as an  elephant, came clacking past between the ranked tree-boles, stopping a  moment to straddle a sapling and browse; while the wolverine, sitting  motionless and wide-legged, watched him.  Once a lynx, with its  eternal, set grin, floated by, half-seen, half-guessed, as if a wisp of  wood mist had broken loose and was floating about.  Once a fox,  somewhere in the utter silence of the forest depths, barked a hoarse,  sharp, malicious sound; and once, hoarser still and very hollowly, a  great horned owl hooted with disconcerting suddenness.  (The scream of  a rabbit followed these two, but whether fox or owl had been in at that  killing the wolverine never knew.)  Twice a wood-hare turning now to  match the whiteness of its surroundings, finicked up one of the still,  silent forest lanes towards him, stopped, faced half-round, sat  \"frozen\" for a fraction, and vanished as if it were a puff of  wind-caught snow.  (And, really, one had no idea till now that the  always apparently lifeless forest could have been so full of life in  the dark hours.)    But all these things made no difference to the wolverine, to Gulo,  though he \"froze\" with habitual care to watch them--for your wild  creature rarely takes chances.  Details must never be overlooked in the  wild.  He dug on, and in digging came right to the _cache_, roofed and  anchored all down, safe beyond any invasion, with tree-trunks.  And--and, mark you, not being able to pull tree-trunks out of the  ground, and being too large to squeeze between them, he gnawed through  one!  Gnawed through it, he did, and came down to the bazaar below.    So far, he had been only beast.  Now we see why I said he had more  brains than were good for any animal except man.    He bit through the canvas, or whatever it was that protected the  _cached_ articles.  He got his head inside.  He felt about  purposefully, and backed out, dragging a trap with him.  With it he  removed into the inky shadows, and it was never found again.    He returned.  He thrust his head in a second time, got hold of  something, and backed out.  It was another trap, and with it he  vanished also; and it, too, was never found.  He returned, and went,  and a third trap went with him.    The fourth investigation revealed an ax.  It he partly buried.  The  fifth yielded a bag of flour, which he tore up and scattered all over  the place.  The sixth inroad produced a haunch of venison, off which he  dined.  The seventh showed another haunch, and this he buried somewhere  unseen in the shades.  The eighth overhaul gave up some rope, in which  he nearly got himself entangled, and which he finally carried away,  bitten and frayed past use.  The ninth search rewarded him with tea,  which he scattered, and bacon, which he buried.    What he could not drag out, he scattered.  What he failed to remove, he  defiled.  And, at last, when he had made of the place, not an orderly  _cache_, but a third-rate _debacle_, he sauntered, always slouching,  always grossly untidy, hump-backed, stooping, low-headed, and  droop-tailed, shabbily unrespectable, out into the night, and the  darkness of the "]]]
