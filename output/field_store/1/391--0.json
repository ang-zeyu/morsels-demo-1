LOVE ON THE OCEAN      Nothing is so easy as falling in love on a long sea voyage, except  falling out of love. Especially was this the case in the days when the  wooden clippers did finely to land you in Sydney or in Melbourne under  the four full months. We all saw far too much of each other, unless,  indeed, we were to see still more. Our superficial attractions mutually  exhausted, we lost heart and patience in the disappointing strata  which lie between the surface and the bed-rock of most natures. My own  experience was confined to the round voyage of the Lady Jermyn, in the  year 1853. It was no common experience, as was only too well known  at the time. And I may add that I for my part had not the faintest  intention of falling in love on board; nay, after all these years,  let me confess that I had good cause to hold myself proof against such  weakness. Yet we carried a young lady, coming home, who, God knows,  might have made short work of many a better man!    Eva Denison was her name, and she cannot have been more than nineteen  years of age. I remember her telling me that she had not yet come out,  the very first time I assisted her to promenade the poop. My own name  was still unknown to her, and yet I recollect being quite fascinated by  her frankness and self-possession. She was exquisitely young, and yet  ludicrously old for her years; had been admirably educated, chiefly  abroad, and, as we were soon to discover, possessed accomplishments  which would have made the plainest old maid a popular personage on board  ship. Miss Denison, however, was as beautiful as she was young, with the  bloom of ideal health upon her perfect skin. She had a wealth of lovely  hair, with strange elusive strands of gold among the brown, that drowned  her ears (I thought we were to have that mode again?) in sunny ripples;  and a soul greater than the mind, and a heart greater than either, lay  sleeping somewhere in the depths of her grave, gray eyes.    We were at sea together so many weeks. I cannot think what I was made of  then!    It was in the brave old days of Ballarat and Bendigo, when ship after  ship went out black with passengers and deep with stores, to bounce home  with a bale or two of wool, and hardly hands enough to reef topsails  in a gale. Nor was this the worst; for not the crew only, but, in many  cases, captain and officers as well, would join in the stampede to the  diggings; and we found Hobson's Bay the congested asylum of all manner  of masterless and deserted vessels. I have a lively recollection of our  skipper's indignation when the pilot informed him of this disgraceful  fact. Within a fortnight, however, I met the good man face to face upon  the diggings. It is but fair to add that the Lady Jermyn lost every  officer and man in the same way, and that the captain did obey tradition  to the extent of being the last to quit his ship. Nevertheless, of  all who sailed by her in January, I alone was ready to return at the  beginning of the following July.    I had been to Ballarat. I had given the thing a trial. For the most  odious weeks I had been a licensed digger on Black Hill Flats; and I had  actually failed to make running expenses. That, however, will surprise  you the less when I pause to declare that I have paid as much as four  shillings and sixpence for half a loaf of execrable bread; that my mate  and I, between us, seldom took more than a few pennyweights of gold-dust  in any one day; and never once struck pick into nugget, big or little,  though we had the mortification of inspecting the \"mammoth masses\" of  which we found the papers full on landing, and which had brought the  gold-fever to its height during our very voyage. With me, however, as  with many a young fellow who had turned his back on better things, the  malady was short-lived. We expected to make our fortunes out of hand,  and we had reckoned without the vermin and the villainy which rendered  us more than ever impatient of delay. In my fly-blown blankets I dreamt  of London until I hankered after my chambers and my club more than after  much fine gold. Never shall I forget my first hot bath on getting back  to Melbourne; it cost five shillings, but it was worth five pounds, and  is altogether my pleasantest reminiscence of Australia.    There was, however, one slice of luck in store for me. I found the dear  old Lady Jermyn on the very eve of sailing, with a new captain, a new  crew, a handful of passengers (chiefly steerage), and nominally no cargo  at all. I felt none the less at home when I stepped over her familiar  side.    In the cuddy we were only five, but a more uneven quintette I defy you  to convene. There was a young fellow named Ready, packed out for  his health, and hurrying home to die among friends. There was an  outrageously lucky digger, another invalid, for he would drink nothing  but champagne with every meal and at any minute of the day, and I have  seen him pitch raw gold at the sea-birds by the hour together. Miss  Denison was our only lady, and her step-father, with whom she was  travelling, was the one man of distinction on board. He was a Portuguese  of sixty or thereabouts, Senhor Joaquin Santos by name; at first it was  incredible to me that he had no title, so noble was his bearing; but  very soon I realized that he was one of those to whom adventitious  honors can add no lustre. He treated Miss Denison as no parent ever  treated a child, with a gallantry and a courtliness quite beautiful to  watch, and not a little touching in the light of the circumstances under  which they were travelling together. The girl had gone straight from  school to her step-father's estate on the Zambesi, where, a few months  later, her mother had died of the malaria. Unable to endure the place  after his wife's death, Senhor Santos had taken ship to Victoria, there  to seek fresh fortune with results as indifferent as my own. He was  now taking Miss Denison back to England, to make her home with other  relatives, before he himself returned to Africa (as he once told me) to  lay his bones beside those of his wife. I hardly know which of the pair  I see more plainly as I write--the young girl with her soft eyes and her  sunny hair, or the old gentleman with the erect though wasted figure,  the noble forehead, the steady eye, the parchment skin, the white  imperial, and the eternal cigarette between his shrivelled lips.    No need to say that I came more in contact with the young girl. She was  not less charming in my eyes because she provoked me greatly as I came  to know her intimately. She had many irritating faults. Like most young  persons of intellect and inexperience, she was hasty and intolerant in  nearly all her judgments, and rather given to being critical in a crude  way. She was very musical, playing the guitar and singing in a style  that made our shipboard concerts vastly superior to the average of their  order; but I have seen her shudder at the efforts of less gifted folks  who were also doing their best; and it was the same in other directions  where her superiority was less specific. The faults which are most  exasperating in another are, of course, one's own faults; and I confess  that I was very critical of Eva Denison's criticisms. Then she had  a little weakness for exaggeration, for unconscious egotism in  conversation, and I itched to tell her so. I felt so certain that the  girl had a fine character underneath, which would rise to noble heights  in stress or storm: all the more would I long now to take her in hand  and mould her in little things, and anon to take her in my arms just as  she was. The latter feeling was resolutely crushed. To be plain, I had  endured what is euphemistically called \"disappointment\" already; and,  not being a complete coxcomb, I had no intention of courting a second.    Yet, when I write of Eva Denison, I am like to let my pen outrun my  tale. I lay the pen down, and a hundred of her sayings ring in my  ears, with my own contradictious comments, that I was doomed so soon  to repent; a hundred visions of her start to my eyes; and there is the  trade-wind singing in the rigging, and loosening a tress of my darling's  hair, till it flies like a tiny golden streamer in the tropic sun.  There, it is out! I have called her what she was to be in my heart ever  after. Yet at the time I must argue with her--with her! When all my  courage should have gone to love-making, I was plucking it up to sail as  near as I might to plain remonstrance! I little dreamt how the ghost of  every petty word was presently to return and torture me.    So it is that I can see her and hear her now on a hundred separate  occasions beneath the awning beneath the stars on deck below at noon  or night but plainest of all in the evening of the day we signalled  the Island of Ascension, at the close of that last concert on the  quarter-deck. The watch are taking down the extra awning; they are  removing the bunting and the foot-lights. The lanterns are trailed  forward before they are put out; from"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17034"],[0,"English Fairy Tales (#1)"],[1,"Note: Project Gutenberg also has an HTML version of this        file which includes the original illustrations.

GEORGE OF MERRIE ENGLAND      In the darksome depths of a thick forest lived Kalyb the fell  enchantress. Terrible were her deeds, and few there were who had the  hardihood to sound the brazen trumpet which hung over the iron gate that  barred the way to the Abode of Witchcraft. Terrible were the deeds of  Kalyb; but above all things she delighted in carrying off innocent  new-born babes, and putting them to death.    And this, doubtless, she meant to be the fate of the infant son of the  Earl of Coventry, who long long years ago was Lord High Steward of  England. Certain it is that the babe's father being absent, and his  mother dying at his birth, the wicked Kalyb, with spells and charms,  managed to steal the child from his careless nurses.    But the babe was marked from the first for doughty deeds; for on his  breast was pictured the living image of a dragon, on his right hand was  a blood-red cross, and on his left leg showed the golden garter.    And these signs so affected Kalyb, the fell enchantress, that she stayed  her hand; and the child growing daily in beauty and stature, he became  to her as the apple of her eye. Now, when twice seven years had passed  the boy began to thirst for honourable adventures, though the wicked  enchantress wished to keep him as her own.    But he, seeking glory, utterly disdained so wicked a creature; thus she  sought to bribe him. And one day, taking him by the hand, she led him to  a brazen castle and showed him six brave knights, prisoners therein.  Then said she:    \"Lo! These be the six champions of Christendom. Thou shalt be the  seventh and thy name shall be St. George of Merrie England if thou wilt  stay with me.\"    But he would not.    Then she led him into a magnificent stable where stood seven of the most  beautiful steeds ever seen. \"Six of these,\" said she, \"belong to the six  Champions. The seventh and the best, the swiftest and the most powerful  in the world, whose name is Bayard, will I bestow on thee, if thou wilt  stay with me.\"    But he would not.    Then she took him to the armoury, and with her own hand buckled on a  corselet of purest steel, and laced on a helmet inlaid with gold. Then,  taking a mighty falchion, she gave it into his hand, and said: \"This  armour which none can pierce, this sword called Ascalon, which will hew  in sunder all it touches, are thine; surely now thou wilt stop with me?\"    But he would not.    Then she bribed him with her own magic wand, thus giving him power over  all things in that enchanted land, saying:    \"Surely now wilt thou remain here?\"    But he, taking the wand, struck with it a mighty rock that stood by; and  lo! it opened, and laid in view a wide cave garnished by the bodies of a  vast number of innocent new-born infants whom the wicked enchantress had  murdered.    Thus, using her power, he bade the sorceress lead the way into the place  of horror, and when she had entered, he raised the magic wand yet again,  and smote the rock; and lo! it closed for ever, and the sorceress was  left to bellow forth her lamentable complaints to senseless stones.    Thus was St. George freed from the enchanted land, and taking with him  the six other champions of Christendom on their steeds, he mounted  Bayard and rode to the city of Coventry.    Here for nine months they abode, exercising themselves in all feats of  arms. So when spring returned they set forth, as knights errant, to seek  for foreign adventure.    And for thirty days and thirty nights they rode on, until, at the  beginning of a new month, they came to a great wide plain. Now in the  centre of this plain, where seven several ways met, there stood a great  brazen pillar, and here, with high heart and courage, they bade each  other farewell, and each took a separate road.    Hence, St. George, on his charger Bayard, rode till he reached the  seashore where lay a good ship bound for the land of Egypt. Taking  passage in her, after long journeying he arrived in that land when the  silent wings of night were outspread, and darkness brooded on all  things. Here, coming to a poor hermitage, he begged a night's lodging,  on which the hermit replied:    \"Sir Knight of Merrie England--for I see her arms graven on thy  breastplate--thou hast come hither in an ill time, when those alive are  scarcely able to bury the dead by reason of the cruel destruction waged  by a terrible dragon, who ranges up and down the country by day and by  night. If he have not an innocent maiden to devour each day, he sends a  mortal plague amongst the people. And"]]]
