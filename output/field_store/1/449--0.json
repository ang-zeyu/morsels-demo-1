He was one of the worst kind; in fact he was a real demon.  One day he was in a high state of delight because he had invented a  mirror with this peculiarity, that every good and pretty thing reflected  in it shrank away to almost nothing. On the other hand, every bad and  good-for-nothing thing stood out and looked its worst. The most  beautiful landscapes reflected in it looked like boiled spinach, and the  best people became hideous, or else they were upside down and had no  bodies. Their faces were distorted beyond recognition, and if they had  even one freckle it appeared to spread all over the nose and mouth. The  demon thought this immensely amusing. If a good thought passed through  any one's mind, it turned to a grin in the mirror, and this caused real  delight to the demon. All the scholars in the demon's school, for he  kept a school, reported that a miracle had taken place: now for the  first time it had become possible to see what the world and mankind were  really like. They ran about all over with the mirror, till at last there  was not a country or a person which had not been seen in this distorting  mirror. They even wanted to fly up to heaven with it to mock the angels;  but the higher they flew, the more it grinned, so much so that they  could hardly hold it, and at last it slipped out of their hands and fell  to the earth, shivered into hundreds of millions and billions of bits.  Even then it did more harm than ever. Some of these bits were not as big  as a grain of sand, and these flew about all over the world, getting  into people's eyes, and, once in, they stuck there, and distorted  everything they looked at, or made them see everything that was amiss.  Each tiniest grain of glass kept the same power as that possessed by the  whole mirror. Some people even got a bit of the glass into their hearts,  and that was terrible, for the heart became like a lump of ice. Some of  the fragments were so big that they were used for window panes, but it  was not advisable to look at one's friends through these panes. Other  bits were made into spectacles, and it was a bad business when people  put on these spectacles meaning to be just. The bad demon laughed  till he split his sides; it tickled him to see the mischief he had done.  But some of these fragments were still left floating about the world,  and you shall hear what happened to them.      SECOND STORY    ABOUT A LITTLE BOY AND A LITTLE GIRL    [Illustration: _Many a winter's night she flies through the streets and  peeps in at the windows, and then the ice freezes on the panes into  wonderful patterns like flowers._]    In a big town crowded with houses and people, where there is no room for  gardens, people have to be content with flowers in pots instead. In one  of these towns lived two children who managed to have something bigger  than a flower pot for a garden. They were not brother and sister, but  they were just as fond of each other as if they had been. Their parents  lived opposite each other in two attic rooms. The roof of one house just  touched the roof of the next one, with only a rain-water gutter between  them. They each had a little dormer window, and one only had to step  over the gutter to get from one house to the other. Each of the parents  had a large window-box, in which they grew pot herbs and a little  rose-tree. There was one in each box, and they both grew splendidly.  Then it occurred to the parents to put the boxes across the gutter, from  house to house, and they looked just like two banks of flowers. The pea  vines hung down over the edges of the boxes, and the roses threw out  long creepers which twined round the windows. It was almost like a green  triumphal arch. The boxes were high, and the children knew they must not  climb up on to them, but they were often allowed to have their little  stools out under the rose-trees, and there they had delightful games. Of  course in the winter there was an end to these amusements. The windows  were often covered with hoar-frost; then they would warm coppers on the  stove and stick them on the frozen panes, where they made lovely  peep-holes, as round as possible. Then a bright eye would peep through  these holes, one from each window. The little boy's name was Kay, and  the little girl's Gerda.    In the summer they could reach each other with one bound, but in the  winter they had to go down all the stairs in one house and up all the  stairs in the other, and outside there were snowdrifts.    'Look! the white bees are swarming,' said the old grandmother.    'Have they a queen bee, too?' asked the little boy, for he knew that  there was a queen among the real bees.    'Yes, indeed they have,' said the grandmother. 'She flies where the  swarm is thickest. She is biggest of them all, and she never remains on  the ground. She always flies up again to the sky. Many a winter's night  she flies through the streets and peeps in at the windows, and then the  ice freezes on the panes into wonderful patterns like flowers.'    'Oh yes, we have seen that,' said both children, and then they knew  it was true.    'Can the Snow Queen come in here?' asked the little girl.    'Just let her come,' said the boy, 'and I will put her on the stove,  where she will melt.'    But the grandmother smoothed his hair and told him more stories.    In the evening when little Kay was at home and half undressed, he crept  up on to the chair by the window, and peeped out of the little hole. A  few snow-flakes were falling, and one of these, the biggest, remained on  the edge of the window-box. It grew bigger and bigger, till it became  the figure of a woman, dressed in the finest white gauze, which appeared  to be made of millions of starry flakes. She was delicately lovely, but  all ice, glittering, dazzling ice. Still she was alive, her eyes shone  like two bright stars, but there was no rest or peace in them. She  nodded to the window and waved her hand. The little boy was frightened  and jumped down off the chair, and then he fancied that "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17866"],[0,"Murder in the Gunroom (#1)"],[1,"IN THE GUNROOM                              By H. BEAM PIPER                                      NEW YORK                         _Alfred A. Knopf_ 1953                              FIRST EDITION          TO _Colonel Henry W. Shoemaker_ an old and valued friend, who was  promised this dedication, with an entirely different novel in mind,  twenty-two years ago.          PREFACE    _The Lane Fleming collection of early pistols and revolvers was one of  the best in the country. When Fleming was found dead on the floor of  his locked gunroom, a Confederate-made Colt-type percussion .36 revolver  in his hand, the coroner's verdict was \"death by accident.\" But Gladys  Fleming had her doubts. Enough at any rate to engage Colonel Jefferson  Davis Rand--better known just as Jeff--private detective and a  pistol-collector himself, to catalogue, appraise, and negotiate the  sale of her late husband's collection.    There were a number of people who had wanted the collection. The  question was: had anyone wanted it badly enough to kill Fleming? And if  so, how had he done it? Here is a mystery, told against the fascinating  background of old guns and gun-collecting, which is rapid-fire without  being hysterical, exciting without losing its contact with reason, and  which introduces a personable and intelligent new private detective. It  is a story that will keep your nerves on a hair trigger even if you don't  know the difference between a cased pair of Paterson .34's and a Texas  .40 with a ramming-lever._          CHAPTER 1      It was hard to judge Jeff Rand's age from his appearance; he was  certainly over thirty and considerably under fifty. He looked hard and  fit, like a man who could be a serviceable friend or a particularly  unpleasant enemy. Women instinctively suspected that he would make a  most satisfying lover. One might have taken him for a successful lawyer  (he had studied law, years ago), or a military officer in mufti (he still  had a Reserve colonelcy, and used the title occasionally, to impress  people who he thought needed impressing), or a prosperous businessman,  as he usually thought of himself. Most of all, he looked like King  Charles II of England anachronistically clad in a Brooks Brothers suit.    At the moment, he was looking rather like King Charles II being bothered  by one of his mistresses who wanted a peerage for her husband.    \"But, Mrs. Fleming,\" he was expostulating. \"There surely must be somebody  else.... After all, you'll have to admit that this isn't the sort of work  this agency handles.\"    The would-be client released a series of smoke-rings and watched them  float up toward the air-outlet at the office ceiling. It spoke well for  Rand's ability to subordinate esthetic to business considerations that he  was trying to give her a courteous and humane brush-off. She made even  the Petty and Varga girls seem credible. Her color-scheme was blue and  gold; blue eyes, and a blue tailored outfit that would have looked severe  on a less curvate figure, and a charmingly absurd little blue hat perched  on a mass of golden hair. If Rand had been Charles II, she could have  walked out of there with a duchess's coronet, and Nell Gwyn would have  been back selling oranges.    \"Why isn't it?\" she countered. \"Your door's marked _Tri-State Detective  Agency, Jefferson Davis Rand, Investigation and Protection_. Well, I want  to know how much the collection's worth, and who'll pay the closest to  it. That's investigation, isn't it? And I want protection from being  swindled. And don't tell me you can't do it. You're a pistol-collector,  yourself; you have one of the best small collections in the state. And  you're a recognized authority on early pistols; I've read some of your  articles in the _Rifleman_. If you can't handle this, I don't know who  can.\"    Rand's frown deepened. He wondered how much Gladys Fleming knew about the  principles of General Semantics. Even if she didn't know anything, she  was still edging him into an untenable position. He hastily shifted from  the attempt to identify his business with the label, \"private detective  agency.\"    \"Well, here, Mrs. Fleming,\" he explained. \"My business, including  armed-guard and protected-delivery service, and general investigation  and protection work, requires some personal supervision, but none of  it demands my exclusive attention. Now, if you wanted some routine  investigation made, I could turn it over to my staff, maybe put two or  three men to work on it. But there's nothing about this business of yours  that I could delegate to anybody; I'd have to do it all myself, at the  expense of neglecting the rest of my business. Now, I could do what you  want done, but it would cost you three or four times what you'd gain by  retaining me.\"    \"Well, let me decide that, Colonel,\" she replied. \"How much would you  have to have?\"    \"Well, this collection of your late husband's consists of some  twenty-five hundred pistols and revolvers, all types and periods,\" Rand  said. \"You want me to catalogue it, appraise each item, issue lists, and  negotiate with prospective buyers. The cataloguing and appraisal alone  would take from a week to ten days, and it would be a couple more weeks  until a satisfactory sale could be arranged. Why, say five thousand  dollars; a thousand as a retainer and the rest on completion.\"    That, he thought, would settle that. He was expecting an indignant  outcry, and hardened his heart, like Pharaoh. Instead, Gladys Fleming  nodded equably.    \"That seems reasonable enough, Colonel Rand, considering that you'd have  to be staying with us at Rosemont, away from your office,\" she agreed.  \"I'll give you a check for the thousand now, with a letter of  authorization.\"    Rand nodded in return. Being thoroughly conscious of the fact that  he could only know a thin film of the events on the surface of any  situation, he was not easily surprised.    \"Very well,\" he said. \"You've hired an arms-expert. I'll be in Rosemont  some time tomorrow afternoon. Now, who are these prospective purchasers  you mentioned, and just how prospective, in terms of United States  currency, are they?\"    \"Well, for one, there's Arnold Rivers; he's offering ten thousand for the  collection. I suppose you know of him; he has an antique-arms business at  Rosemont.\"    \"I've done some business with him,\" Rand admitted. \"Who else?\"    \"There's a commission-dealer named Carl Gwinnett, who wants to handle  the collection for us, for twenty per cent. I'm told that that isn't an  unusually exorbitant commission, but I'm not exactly crazy about the  idea.\"    \"You shouldn't be, if you want your money in a hurry,\" Rand told her.  \"He'd take at least five years to get everything sold. He wouldn't dump  the whole collection on the market at once, upset prices, and spoil his  future business. You know, two thousand five hundred pistols of the sort  Mr. Fleming had, coming on the market in a lot, could do just that. The  old-arms market isn't so large that it couldn't be easily saturated.\"    \"That's what I'd been thinking.... And then, there are some private  collectors, mostly friends of Lane's--Mr. Fleming's--who are talking  about forming a pool to buy the collection for distribution among  themselves,\" she continued.    \"That's more like it,\" Rand approved. \"If they can raise enough money  among them, that is. They won't want the stuff for resale, and they may  pay something resembling a decent price. Who are they?\"    \"Well, Stephen Gresham appears to be the leading spirit,\" she said. \"The  corporation lawyer, you know. Then, there is a Mr. Trehearne, and a Mr.  MacBride, and Philip Cabot, and one or two others.\"    \"I know Gresham and Cabot,\" Rand said. \"They're both friends of mine, and  I have an account with Cabot, Joyner & Teale, Cabot's brokerage firm.  I've corresponded with MacBride; he specializes in Colts.... You're the  sole owner, I take it?\"    \"Well, no.\" She paused, picking her words carefully. \"We may just run  into a little trouble, there. You see, the collection is part of the  residue of the estate, left equally to myself and my two stepdaughters,  Nelda Dunmore and Geraldine Varcek. You understand, Mr. Fleming and I  were married in 1941; his first wife died fifteen years before.\"    \"Well, your stepdaughters, now; would they also be my clients?\"    \"Good Lord, no!\" That amused her considerably more than it did Rand.  \"Of course,\" she continued, \"they're just as interested in selling the  collection for the best possible price, but beyond that, there may be a  slight divergence of opinion. For instance, Nelda's husband, Fred  Dunmore, has been insisting that we let him handle the sale of the  pistols, on the grounds that he is something he calls a businessman.  Nelda supports him in this. It was Fred who got this ten-thousand-dollar  offer from Rivers. Personally, I think Rivers is playing him for a  sucker. Outside his own line, Fred is an awful innocent, and I've never  trusted this man Rivers. Lane had some trouble with him, just before ...\"    \"Arnold Rivers,\" Rand said, when it was evident that she was not going  to continue, \"has the reputation, among collectors, of being the biggest  crook in the old-gun racket, a reputation he seems determined to live  up--or down--to. But here; if your stepdaughters are co-owners, what's  my status? What authority, if any, have I to do any negotiating?\"    Gladys Fleming laughed musically. \"That, my dear Colonel, is where you  earn your fee,\" she told him. \"Actually, it won't be as hard as it looks.  If Nelda gives you any argument, you can count on Geraldine to take your  side as a matter of principle; if Geraldine objects first, Nelda will  help you steam-roll her into line. Fred Dunmore is accustomed to dealing  with a lot of yes-men at the plant; you shouldn't have any trouble  shouting him down. Anton Varcek won't be interested, one way or another;  he has what amounts to "]]]
