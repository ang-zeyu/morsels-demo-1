Y. R.    To you we owe the suggestion of writing this book. Its purpose, as you  know better than any one else, is to tell in simple fashion the story of  some Americans who showed that they knew how to live and how to die; who  proved their truth by their endeavor; and who joined to the stern and  manly qualities which are essential to the well-being of a masterful  race the virtues of gentleness, of patriotism, and of lofty adherence to  an ideal.    It is a good thing for all Americans, and it is an especially good thing  for young Americans, to remember the men who have given their lives in  war and peace to the service of their fellow-countrymen, and to keep in  mind the feats of daring and personal prowess done in time past by  some of the many champions of the nation in the various crises of her  history. Thrift, industry, obedience to law, and intellectual cultivation  are essential qualities in the makeup of any successful people; but no  people can be really great unless they possess also the heroic virtues  which are as needful in time of peace as in time of war, and as  important in civil as in military life. As a civilized people we desire  peace, but the only peace worth having is obtained by instant readiness  to fight when wronged--not by unwillingness or inability to fight at  all. Intelligent foresight in preparation and known capacity to stand  well in battle are the surest safeguards against war. America will cease  to be a great nation whenever her young men cease to possess energy,  daring, and endurance, as well as the wish and the power to fight the  nation's foes. No citizen of a free state should wrong any man; but it  is not enough merely to refrain from infringing on the rights of others;  he must also be able and willing to stand up for his own rights and  those of his country against all comers, and he must be ready at any  time to do his full share in resisting either malice domestic or foreign  levy.

But to sketch the  life of Washington even in the barest outline is to write the history  of the events which made the United States independent and gave birth  to the American nation. Even to give alist of what he did, to name his  battles and recount his acts as president, would be beyond the limit and  the scope of this book. Yet it is always possible to recall the man and  to consider what he was and what he meant for us and for mankind He is  worthy the study and the remembrance of all men, and to Americans he is  at once a great glory of their past and an inspiration and an assurance  of their future.         * John Richard Green.      To understand Washington at all we must first strip off all the myths  which have gathered about him. We must cast aside into the dust-heaps  all the wretched inventions of the cherry-tree variety, which were  fastened upon him nearly seventy years after his birth. We must look at  him as he looked at life and the facts about him, without any illusion  or deception, and no man in history can better stand such a scrutiny.    Born of a distinguished family in the days when the American colonies  were still ruled by an aristocracy, Washington started with all that  good birth and tradition could give. Beyond this, however, he had  little. His family was poor, his mother was left early a widow, and he  was forced after a very limited education to go out into the world to  fight for himself He had strong within him the adventurous spirit of  his race. He became a surveyor, and in the pursuit of this profession  plunged into the wilderness, where he soon grew to be an expert hunter  and backwoodsman. Even as a boy the gravity of his character and  his mental and physical vigor commended him to those about him, and  responsibility and military command were put in his hands at an age when  most young men are just leaving college. As the times grew threatening  on the frontier, he was sent on a perilous mission to the Indians, in  which, after passing through many hardships and dangers, he achieved  success. When the troubles came with France it was by the soldiers under  his command that the first shots were fired in the war which was to  determine whether the North American continent should be French or  English. In his earliest expedition he was defeated by the enemy. Later  he was with Braddock, and it was he who tried, to rally the broken  English army on the stricken field near Fort Duquesne. On that day  of surprise and slaughter he displayed not only cool courage but the  reckless daring which was one of his chief characteristics. He so  exposed himself that bullets passed through his coat and hat, and the  Indians and the French who tried to bring him down thought he bore a  charmed life. He afterwards served with distinction all through the  French war, and when peace came he went back to the estate which he had  inherited from his brother, the most admired man in Virginia.    At that time he married, and during the ensuing years he lived the life  of a Virginia planter, successful in his private affairs and serving the  public effectively but quietly as a member of the House of Burgesses.  When the troubles with the mother country began to thicken he was slow  to take extreme ground, but he never wavered in his belief that all  attempts to oppress the colonies should be resisted, and when he once  took up his position there was no shadow of turning. He was one of  Virginia's delegates to the first Continental Congress, and, although  he said but little, he was regarded by all the representatives from  the other colonies as the strongest man among them. There was something  about him even then which commanded the respect and the confidence of  every one who came in contact with him.    It was from New England, far removed from his own State, that the demand  came for his appointment as commander-in-chief of the American army.  Silently he accepted the duty, and, leaving Philadelphia, took command  of the army at Cambridge. There is no need to trace him through the  events that followed. From the time when he drew his sword under the  famous elm tree, he was the embodiment of the American Revolution, and  without him that revolution would have failed almost at the start. How  he carried it to victory through defeat and trial and every possible  obstacle is known to all men.    When it was all over he found himself facing a new situation. He was the  idol of the country and of his soldiers. The army was unpaid, and the  veteran troops, with arms in their hands, were eager to have him take  control of the disordered country as Cromwell had done in England  a little more than a century before. With the army at his back, and  supported by the great forces which, in every community, desire order  before everything else, and are ready to assent to any arrangement which  will bring peace and quiet, nothing would have been easier than for  Washington to have made himself the ruler of the new nation. But that  was not his conception of duty, and he not only refused to have anything  to do with such a movement himself, but he repressed, by his dominant  personal influence, all such intentions on the part of the army. On  the 23d of December, 1783, he met the Congress at Annapolis, and there  resigned his commission. What he then said is one of the two most  memorable speeches ever made in the United States, and is also memorable  for its meaning and spirit among all speeches ever made by men. He spoke  as follows:    \"Mr. President:--The great events on"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18647"],[0,"Peeps at Many Lands: Egypt (#1)"],[1,"Distributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net                          [Illustration: BY STILL WATERS.]          [Illustration: SEBIL OF THE MOSQUE OF THE SULTAN KELAUN.]                               PEEPS AT MANY LANDS                                    EGYPT                                          BY                               R.

It must have been a startling experience for the little shepherd boy,  who, stolen from his home among the quiet hills of Canaan, so suddenly  found himself an inmate of a palace, and, in his small way, a  participator in the busy whirl of life of a royal city.    No contrast could possibly have been greater than between his simple  pastoral life spent in tending the flocks upon the hillsides and the  magnificence of the city of Pharaoh, and how strange a romance it is  to think of the little slave boy eventually becoming the virtual ruler  of the most wealthy and most highly cultured country in the world!    And then in course of time the very brothers who had so cruelly sold  him into bondage were forced by famine to come to Joseph as suppliants  for food, and, in their descendants, presently to become the meanest  slaves in the land, persecuted and oppressed until their final  deliverance by Moses.    How long ago it all seems when we read these old Bible stories! Yet,  when 4,000 years ago necessity compelled Abraham, with Sarah his wife,  to stay awhile in Egypt, they were lodged at Tanis, a royal city  founded by one of a succession of kings which for 3,000 years before  Abraham's day had governed the land, and modern discoveries have  proved that even before _that_ time there were other kings and an  earlier civilization.    How interesting it is to know that to-day we may still find records of  these early Bible times in the sculptured monuments which are  scattered all over the land, and to know that in the hieroglyphic  writings which adorn the walls of tombs or temples many of the events  we there read about are narrated.    Many of the temples were built by the labour of the oppressed  Israelites, others were standing long before Moses confounded their  priests or besought Pharaoh to liberate his people. We may ourselves  stand in courts where, perhaps, Joseph took part in some temple rite,  while the huge canal called the \"Bahr Yusef\" (or river of Joseph),  which he built 6,300 years ago, still supplies the province Fayoum  with water.    Ancient Tanis also, from whose tower Abraham saw \"wonders in the field  of Zoan,\" still exists in a heap of ruins, extensive enough to show  how great a city it had been, and from its mounds the writer has often  witnessed the strange mirage which excited the wonder of the  patriarch.    Everywhere throughout the land are traces of the children of Israel,  many of whose descendants still remain in the land of Goshen, and in  every instance where fresh discovery has thrown light upon the subject  the independent record of history found in hieroglyph or papyrus  confirms the Bible narrative, so that we may be quite sure when we  read these old stories that they are not merely legends, open to  doubt, but are the true histories of people who actually lived.    As you will see from what I have told you, Egypt is perhaps the oldest  country in the world--the oldest, that is, in civilization. No one  quite knows how old it is, and no record has been discovered to tell  us.    All through the many thousands of years of its history Egypt has had a  great influence upon other nations, and although the ancient Persians,  Greeks, and Romans successively dominated it, these conquering races  have each in turn disappeared, while Egypt goes on as ever, and its  people remain.    Egypt has been described as the centre of the world, and if we look at  the map we will see how true this is. Situated midway between Europe,  Africa, and Asia in the old days of land caravans, most of the trade  between these continents passed through her hands, while her ports on  the Mediterranean controlled the sea trade of the Levant.    All this helped to make Egypt wealthy, and gave it great political  importance, so that very early in the world's history it enjoyed a  greater prosperity and a higher civilization than any of its  neighbours. Learned men from all countries were drawn to it in search  of fresh knowledge, for nowhere else were there such seats of  learning as in the Nile cities, and it is acknowledged that the highly  trained priesthood of the Pharaohs practised arts and sciences of  which we in these days are ignorant, and have failed to discover.    In 30 B.C. the last of the Pharaohs disappeared, and for 400  years the Romans ruled in Egypt, many of their emperors restoring the  ancient temples as well as building new ones; but all the Roman  remains in Egypt are poor in comparison with the real Egyptian art,  and, excepting for a few small temples, little now remains of their  buildings but the heaps of rubbish which surround the magnificent  monuments of Egypt's great period.    During the Roman occupation Christianity became the recognized  religion of the country, and to-day the Copts (who are the real  descendants of the ancient Egyptians) still preserve the primitive  faith of those early times, and, with the Abyssinians, are perhaps the  oldest Christian church now existing.    The greatest change in the history of Egypt, however, and the one that  has left the most permanent effect upon it, was the Mohammedan  invasion in A.D. 640, and I must tell you something about  this, because to the great majority of people who visit Egypt the two  great points of interest are its historical remains and the beautiful  art of the Mohammedans. The times of the Pharaohs are in the past, and  have the added interest of association with the Bible; this period of  antiquity is a special study for the historian and the few who are  able to decipher hieroglyphic writing, but the Mohammedan era, though  commencing nearly 200 years before Egbert was crowned first King of  England, continues to the present day, and the beautiful mosques, as  their churches are called (many of which were built long before there  were any churches in our own country), are still used by the Moslems.    Nothing in history is so remarkable as the sudden rise to power of the  followers of Mohammed. An ill-taught, half-savage people, coming from  an unknown part of Arabia, in a very few years they had become masters  of Syria, Asia Minor, Persia, and Egypt, and presently extended their  religion all through North Africa, and even conquered the southern  half of Spain, and to-day the Faith of Islam, as their religion is  called, is the third largest in the world.    Equally surprising as their accession to power is the very beautiful  art they created, first in Egypt and then throughout Tunis, Algeria,  Morocco, and Spain. The Moslem churches in Cairo are extremely  beautiful, and of a style quite unlike anything that the world had  known before. Some of my readers, perhaps, may have seen pictures of  them and of the Alhambra in Spain, probably the most elegant and  ornate palace ever built.    No country in the world gives one so great a sense of age as Egypt,  and although it has many beauties, and the life of the people to-day is  most picturesque, as we will presently see, it is its extreme  antiquity which most excites the imagination, for, while the whole  Bible history from Abraham to the Apostles covers a period of only  2,000 years, the known history of Egypt commenced as far back as  6,000 years ago! From the sphinx at Ghizeh, which is so ancient that  no one knows its origin, to the great dam at Assuan, monument of its  present day, each period of its history has left _some_ record, some  tomb or temple, which we may study, and it is this more than anything  else which makes Egypt so attractive to thoughtful people.          CHAPTER II    THE LAND      It would naturally be supposed that a country which for so long a time  exercised such influence upon the world at large would be extensive  and densely populated.    Neither is the case, however, for though upon the map Egypt appears to  be a large country, the greater part consists of rock and burning  sand, and is practically uninhabited.    The _real_ land of Egypt is the narrow strip of alluvial soil which  forms the Nile banks, and the fertile delta which spreads fan-like  from Cairo to the"]]]
