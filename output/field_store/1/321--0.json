No radical  alterations have been introduced, although a number of minor changes will  be noted.

Wherever greater accuracy or precision of statement seemed  possible, I have endeavored to secure this. The rules for syllable division  have been changed and made to conform to the prevailing practice of the  Romans themselves. In the Perfect Subjunctive Active, the endings _-is_,  _-imus_, _-itis_ are now marked long. The theory of vowel length before the  suffixes -gnus, -gna, -gnum, and also before j, has been discarded. In the  Syntax I have recognized a special category of Ablative of Association, and  have abandoned the original doctrine as to the force of tenses in the  Prohibitive.    Apart from the foregoing, only minor and unessential modifications have  been introduced. In its main lines the work remains unchanged.

The object of this book is to present _the essential facts_ of Latin  grammar in a direct and simple manner, and within the smallest compass  consistent with scholarly standards. While intended primarily for the  secondary school, it has not neglected the needs of the college student,  and aims to furnish such grammatical information as is ordinarily required  in undergraduate courses.    The experience of foreign educators in recent years has tended to restrict  the size of school-grammars of Latin, and has demanded an incorporation of  the main principles of the language in compact manuals of 250 pages. Within  the past decade, several grammars of this scope have appeared abroad which  have amply met the most exacting demands.    The publication in this country of a grammar of similar plan and scope  seems fully justified at the present time, as all recent editions of  classic texts summarize in introductions the special idioms of grammar and  style peculiar to individual authors. This makes it feasible to dispense  with the enumeration of many _minutiae_ of usage which would otherwise  demand consideration in a student's grammar.    In the chapter on Prosody, I have designedly omitted all special treatment  of the lyric metres of Horace and Catullus, as well as of the measures of  the comic poets. Our standard editions of these authors all give such  thorough consideration to versification that repetition in a separate place  seems superfluous.    ITHACA, NEW YORK,  December 15, 1894.

Some years ago the Smithsonian Institution printed a small vocabulary of  the Chinook Jargon, furnished by Dr. B.R. Mitchell, of the U.S. Navy, and  prepared, as we afterwards learned, by Mr. Lionnet, a Catholic priest, for  his own use while studying the language at Chinook Point. It was submitted  by the Institution, for revision and preparation for the press, to the  late Professor W.W. Turner. Although it received the critical examination  of that distinguished philologist, and was of use in directing attention  to the language, it was deficient in the number of words in use, contained  many which did not properly belong to the Jargon, and did not give the  sources from which the words were derived.    Mr. Hale had previously given a vocabulary and account of this Jargon in  his \"Ethnography of the United States Exploring Expedition,\" which was  noticed by Mr. Gallatin in the Transactions of the American Ethnological  Society, vol. ii. He, however, fell into some errors in his derivation of  the words, chiefly from ignoring the Chihalis element of the Jargon, and  the number of words given by him amounted only to about two hundred and  fifty.    A copy of Mr. Lionnet's vocabulary having been sent to me, with a request  to make such corrections as it might require, I concluded not merely to  collate the words contained in this and other printed and manuscript  vocabularies, but to ascertain, so far as possible, the languages which  had contributed to it, with the original Indian words. This had become the  more important, as its extended use by different tribes had led to  ethnological errors in the classing together of essentially distinct  families. Dr. Scouler, whose vocabularies were among the earliest bases of  comparison of the languages of the northwest coast, assumed a number of  words, which he found indiscriminately employed by the Nootkans of  Vancouver Island, the Chinooks of the Columbia, and the intermediate  tribes, to belong alike to their several languages, and exhibit analogies  between them accordingly.[A] On this idea, among other points of fancied  resemblance, he founded his family of Nootka-Columbians,--one which has  been adopted by Drs. Pritchard and Latham, and has caused very great  misconception. Not only are those languages entirely distinct, but the  Nootkans differ greatly in physical and mental characteristics from the  latter. The analogies between the Chinook and the other native  contributors to the Jargon are given hereafter.    [Footnote A: Journal Royal Geographical Society of London, vol. xi.,  1841.]    The origin of this Jargon, a conventional language similar to the Lingua  Franca of the Mediterranean, the Negro-English-Dutch of Surinam, the  Pigeon English of China, and several other mixed tongues, dates back to  the fur droguers of the last century. Those mariners whose enterprise in  the fifteen years preceding 1800, explored the intricacies of the  northwest coast of America, picked up at their general rendezvous, Nootka  Sound, various native words useful in barter, and thence transplanted  them, with additions from the English, to the shores of Oregon. Even  before their day, the coasting trade and warlike expeditions of the  northern tribes, themselves a sea-faring race, had opened up a partial  understanding of each other's speech; for when, in 1792, Vancouver's  officers visited Gray's Harbor, they found that the natives, though  speaking a different language, understood many words of the Nootka.    On the arrival of Lewis and Clarke at the mouth of the Columbia, in 1806,  the new language, from the sentences given by them, had evidently attained  some form. It was with the arrival of Astor's party, however, that the  Jargon received its principal impulse. Many more words of English were  then brought in, and for the first time the French, or rather the Canadian  and Missouri patois of the French, was introduced. The principal seat of  the company being at Astoria, not only a large addition of Chinook words  was made, but a considerable number was taken from the Chihalis, who  immediately bordered that tribe on the north,--each owning a portion of  Shoalwater Bay. The words adopted from the several languages were,  naturally enough, those most easily uttered by all, except, of course,  that objects new to the natives found their names in French or English,  and such modifications were made in pronunciation as suited tongues  accustomed to different sounds. Thus the gutturals of the Indians were  softened or dropped; and the _f_ and _r_ of the English and French, to  them unpronounceable, were modified into _p_ and _l_. Grammatical forms  were reduced to their simplest expression, and variations in mood and  tense conveyed only by adverbs or by the context. The language continued  to receive additions, and assumed a more distinct and settled meaning,  under the Northwest and Hudson's Bay companies, who succeeded Astor's  party, as well as through the American settlers in Oregon. Its advantage  was soon perceived by the Indians, and the Jargon became to some extent a  means of communication between natives of different speech, as well as  between them and the whites. It was even used as such between Americans  and Canadians. It was at first most in vogue upon the lower Columbia and  the Willamette, whence it spread to Puget Sound, and with the extension of  trade, found its way far up the coast, as well as the Columbia and Fraser  rivers; and there are now few tribes between the 42d and 57th parallels of  latitude in which there are not to be found interpreters through its  medium. Its prevalence and easy acquisition, while of vast convenience to  traders and settlers, has tended greatly to hinder the acquirement of the  original Indian languages; so much so, that except by a few missionaries  and pioneers, hardly one of them is spoken or understood by white men in  all Oregon and Washington Territory. Notwithstanding its apparent poverty  in number of words, and the absence of grammatical forms, it possesses  much more flexibility and power of expression than might be imagined, and  really serves almost every purpose of ordinary intercourse.    The number of words constituting the Jargon proper has been variously  stated. Many formerly employed have become in great measure obsolete,  while others have been locally introduced. Thus, at the Dalles of the  Columbia, various terms are common which would not be intelligible at  Astoria or on Puget Sound. In making the following selection, I have  included all those which, on reference to a number of vocabularies, I have  found current at any of these places, rejecting, on the other hand, such  as individuals, partially acquainted with the native languages, have  employed for their own convenience. The total number falls a little short  of five hundred words.    An analysis of their derivations gives the following result:    Chinook, including Clatsop                       200  Chinook, having analogies with other languages    21  Interjections common to several                    8  Nootka, including dialects                        24  Chihalis, 32; Nisqually, 7                        39  Klikatat and Yakama                                2  Cree                                               2  Chippeway (Ojibwa)                                 1  Wasco (probably)                                   4  Kalapuya (probably)                                4  By direct onomatopoeia                             6  Derivation unknown, or undetermined               18  French, 90; Canadian, 4                           94  English                                           67    I had no opportunity of original investigation into the Nootka proper, but  from the few words in different published vocabularies, and from some  imperfect manuscript ones in my possession of the Tokwaht, Nittinat, and  Makah dialects, have ascertained the number above given. Some of the  unascertained words probably also belong to that language. Neither was I  able to collate the Wasco or Kalapuya, but have assigned them on the  opinion of others. The former, also called Cathlasco, the dialect of the  Dalles Indians, is a corrupted form of the Watlala or Upper Chinook. With  the Chihalis, Yakama, and Klikatat, and the Nisqually, I had abundant  means of comparison.    The introduction of the Cree and Chippeway words is of course due to the  Canadians. None have been derived from the Spanish, as their intercourse  with the Nootka and Makah Indians was too short to leave an impression.  Spanish words, especially those relating to horses or mules and their  equipments, have of late come into general use in Oregon, owing to  intercourse with California, but they form no part of the Jargon. It might  have been expected from the number of Sandwich Islanders introduced by the  Hudson's Bay company, and long resident in the country, that the Kanaka  element would have found its way into the language, but their utterance is  so foreign to the Indian ear, that not a word has been adopted.    In the nouns derived from the French, the definite article _le_, _la_, has  almost in every instance been incorporated into the word, and the same has  in one or two instances been prefixed to nouns not of French origin.
