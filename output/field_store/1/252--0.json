All the  silver bells that swing with the turning of the great ring of light  which lies around that land were softly chiming; and the sound of  their commotion went down like dew upon the golden ways of the city,  and the long alleys of blossoming trees, and the meadows of asphodel,  and the curving shores of the River of Life.    At the hearing of that chime, all the angels who had been working  turned to play, and all who had been playing gave themselves joyfully  to work. Those who had been singing, and making melody on different  instruments, fell silent and began to listen. Those who had been  walking alone in meditation met together in companies to talk. And  those who had been far away on errands to the Earth and other planets  came homeward like a flight of swallows to the high cliff when the day  is over.    It was not that they needed to be restored from weariness, for the  inhabitants of that country never say, \"I am tired.\" But there, as  here, the law of change is the secret of happiness, and the joy that  never ends is woven of mingled strands of labour and repose, society  and solitude, music and silence. Sleep comes to them not as it does to  us, with a darkening of the vision and a folding of the wings of the  spirit, but with an opening of the eyes to deeper and fuller light,  and with an effortless outgoing of the soul upon broader currents  of life, as the sun-loving bird poises and circles upward, without a  wing-beat, on the upholding air.    It was in one of the quiet corners of the green valley called  Peacefield, where the little brook of Brighthopes runs smoothly down  to join the River of Life, that I saw a company of angels, returned  from various labours on Earth, sitting in friendly converse on the  hill-side, where cyclamens and arbutus and violets and fringed orchids  and pale lady's-tresses, and all the sweet-smelling flowers which are  separated in the lower world by the seasons, were thrown together in  a harmony of fragrance. There were three of the company who seemed  to be leaders, distinguished not only by more radiant and powerful  looks, but by a tone of authority in their speech and by the willing  attention with which the others listened to them, as they talked  of their earthly tasks, of the tangles and troubles, the wars and  miseries that they had seen among men, and of the best way to get rid  of them and bring sorrow to an end.    \"The Earth is full of oppression and unrighteousness,\" said the  tallest and most powerful of the angels. His voice was deep and  strong, and by his shining armour and the long two-handed sword  hanging over his shoulder I knew that he was the archangel Michael,  the mightiest one among the warriors of the King, and the executor  of the divine judgments upon the unjust. \"The Earth is tormented with  injustice,\" he cried, \"and the great misery that I have seen among  men is that the evil hand is often stronger than the good hand and can  beat it down.    \"The arm of the cruel is heavier than the arm of the kind. The unjust  get the better of the just and tread on them. I have seen tyrant kings  crush their helpless folk. I have seen the fields of the innocent  trampled into bloody ruin by the feet of conquering armies. I have  seen the wicked nation overcome the peoples that loved liberty, and  take away their treasure by force of arms. I have seen poverty mocked  by arrogant wealth, and purity deflowered by brute violence, and  gentleness and fair-dealing bruised in the winepress of iniquity and  pride.    \"There is no cure for this evil, but by the giving of greater force to  the good hand. The righteous cause must be strengthened with might to  resist the wicked, to defend the helpless, to punish all cruelty and  unfairness, to uphold the right everywhere, and to enforce justice  with unconquerable arms. Oh, that the host of Heaven might be called,  arrayed, and sent to mingle in the wars of men, to make the good  victorious, to destroy all evil, and to make the will of the King  prevail!    \"We would shake down the thrones of tyrants, and loose the bands of  the oppressed. We would hold the cruel and violent with the bit of  fear, and drive the greedy and fierce-minded men with the whip of  terror. We would stand guard, with weapons drawn, about the innocent,  the gentle, the kind, and keep the peace of God with the sword of the  angels!\"    As he spoke, his hands were lifted to the hilt of his long blade, and  he raised it above him, straight and shining, throwing sparkles of  light around it, like the spray from the sharp prow of a moving ship.  Bright flames of heavenly ardour leaped in the eyes of the listening  angels; a martial air passed over their faces as if they longed for  the call to war.    But no silver trumpet blared from the battlements of the City of God;  no crimson flag was unfurled on those high, secret walls; no thrilling  drum-beat echoed over the smooth meadow. Only the sound of the brook  of Brighthopes was heard tinkling and murmuring among the roots of the  grasses and flowers; and far off a cadence of song drifted down from  the inner courts of the Palace of the King.    Then another angel began to speak, and made answer to Michael. He,  too, was tall and wore the look of power. But it was power of the  mind rather than of the hand. His face was clear and glistening, and  his eyes were lit with a steady flame which neither leaped nor fell.  Of flame also were his garments, which clung about him as the fire  enwraps a torch burning where there is no wind; and his great wings,  spiring to a point far above his head, were like a living lamp before  the altar of the Most High. By this sign I knew that it was the  archangel Uriel, the spirit of the Sun, clearest in vision, deepest  in wisdom of all the spirits that surround the throne.    \"I hold not the same thought,\" said he, \"as the great archangel  Michael; nor, though I desire the same end which he desires, would I  seek it by the same way. For I know how often power has been given to  the good, and how often it has been turned aside and used for evil.  I know that the host of Heaven, and the very stars in their courses,  have fought on the side of a favoured nation; yet pride has followed  triumph and oppression has been the first-born child of victory.  I know that the deliverers of the people have become tyrants over  those whom they have set free, and the fighters for liberty have been  changed into the soldiers of fortune. Power corrupts itself, and might  cannot save.    \"Does not the Prince Michael remember how the angel of the Lord led  the armies of Israel, and gave them the battle against every foe,  except the enemy within the camp? And how they robbed and crushed  the peoples against whom they had fought for freedom? And how the  wickedness of the tribes of Canaan survived their conquest and  overcame their conquerors, so that the children of Israel learned to  worship the idols of their enemies, Moloch, and Baal, and Ashtoreth?    \"Power corrupts itself, and might cannot save. Was not Persia the  destroyer of Babylon, and did not the tyranny of Persia cry aloud for  destruction? Did not Rome break the yoke of the East, and does not the  yoke of Rome lie heavy on the shoulders of the world? Listen!\"    There was silence for a moment on the slopes of Peacefield, and then  over the encircling hills a cool wind brought the sound of chains  clanking in prisons and galleys, the sighing of millions of slaves,  the weeping of wretched women and children, the blows of hammers  nailing men to their crosses. Then the sound passed by with the wind,  and Uriel spoke again:    \"Power corrupts itself, and might cannot save. The Earth is full of  ignorant strife, and for this evil there is no cure but by the giving  of greater knowledge. It is because men do not understand evil that  they yield themselves to its power. Wickedness is folly in action, and  injustice is the error of the blind. It is because men are ignorant  that they destroy one another, and at last themselves.    \"If there were more light in the world there would be no sorrow. If  the great King who knows all things would enlighten the world with  wisdom--wisdom to understand his law and his ways, to read the secrets  of the earth and the stars, to discern the workings of the heart of  man and the things that make for joy and peace--if he would but send  us, his messengers, as a flame of fire to shine upon those who sit in  darkness, how gladly would we go to bring in the new day!    \"We would speak the word of warning and counsel to the erring, and  tell knowledge to the perplexed. We would guide the ignorant in the  paths of prudence, and the young would sit at our feet and hear  us gladly in the school of life. Then folly would fade away as the  morning vapour, and the sun of wisdom would shine on all men, and the  peace of God would come with the counsel of the angels.\"    A murmur of pleasure followed the words of Uriel, and eager looks  flashed around the circle of the messengers of light as they heard the  praise of wisdom fitly spoken. But there was one among them on whose  face a shadow of doubt rested, and though he smiled, it "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14577"],[0,"The Teaching of History (#1)"],[1,"TEACHING OF HISTORY    by    ERNEST C.

EXAMINATIONS AS TESTS OF PROGRESS    OUTLINE          EDITOR'S INTRODUCTION      This volume is offered as a guide to history teachers of the high school  and the upper grammar grades. It is directly concerned with the teaching  methods to be employed in the history period. The author assumes the  limiting conditions that surround classroom instruction of the present  day; he also takes for granted the teacher's sympathy with modern aims  in history instruction. All discussions of purpose and content are  therefore subordinated to a clear presentation of the details of  effective teaching technique.    The reader into whose hands this volume falls will be deeply interested  in the ideals of teaching implied in the concrete suggestions given in  the following pages, for after all the value of any system of special  methods rests, not merely on its apparent and immediate psychological  effectiveness, but also on the social purposes which it is devised to  serve. It must be recognized at the outset that history has a social  purpose. However much university teaching may be interested in truth for  its own sake, an interest necessarily basic to the service of all other  ends, the teaching of the lower public schools must take into account  the relevancy of historical fact to current and future problems which  concern men and women engaged in the common social life. So the  elementary and secondary school teachers of the more progressive sort  recognize that the way in which historical truths are selected and  related to one another determines two things: (1) Whether our group  experiences as interpreted in history will have any intelligent effect  upon men's appreciations of current social difficulties, and (2) whether  history will make a more vital appeal to youth at school.    Certainly children, whose interests arise not alone from their innate  impulses, but also from the world in which they have lived from the  beginning, will be eager to know the past that is of dominant concern to  the present. It is clear gain in the psychology of instruction if  history is a socially live thing. The children will be more eager to  acquire knowledge; they will hold it longer, because it is significant;  and they will keep it fresh after school days are over because life will  recall and review pertinent knowledge again and again. There can be no  separation between the dominant social interests of community life and  effective pedagogical procedure; the former in large part determines the  latter.    Such educational reforms in history teaching as have already won  acceptance confirm the existence of this vital relation between current  social interests and the learning process. The barren learning of names  and dates has long since been supplanted by a study of sequences among  events. The technical details of wars and political administrations have  given way to a study of wide economic and social movements in which  battles and laws are merely overt results reinforcing the current of  change. History, once a self-inclosed school discipline, has undergone  an intellectual expansion which takes into account all the aspects of  life which influence it, making geographical, economic, and biographical  materials its aids. All these and many other minor changes attest the  fact that a vital mode of instruction always tends to accompany that  view of history which regards the study of the past as a revelation of  real social life.    The author's suggestions will, therefore, be of distinct value to at  least two groups of history teachers. Those who believe in the larger  uses of history teaching, so much argued of late, will find here the  procedures that will express the ideals and obtain the results they  seek. Those who are not yet ready to accept modern doctrine, but who  feel a keen discontent with the older procedure, will find in these  pages many suggestions that will appeal to them as worthy of  experimental use. It may be that the successful use of many methods here  suggested may be the easy way for them to come into an acceptance of the  larger principles of current educational reform.          THE TEACHING OF HISTORY    I    SOME PRELIMINARY CONSIDERATIONS      _Assumptions as to the teacher of history_    This monograph will make no attempt to analyze the personality of the  ideal teacher. It is assumed that the teacher of history has an adequate  preparation to teach his subject, that he is in good health, and that  his usefulness is unimpaired by discontent with his work or cynicism  about the world. It is presupposed that he understands the wisdom of  correlating in his instruction the geography, social progress, and  economic development of the people which his class are studying. He is  aware that the pupil should experience something more than a  kaleidoscopic view of isolated facts. He recognizes the folly of  requiring four years of high school English for the purpose of  cultivating clear, fluent, and accurate expression, only to relax the  effort when the student comes into the history class. He knows that the  precision, logic, and habit of definite thinking exacted by the pursuit  of the scientific subjects should not be laid aside when the student  attempts to trace the rise of nations. Let us go so far as to assume a  teacher who is both pedagogical and practical; scholarly without being  musty; imbued with a love for his subject and yet familiar with actual  human experience.      _Actual conditions confronted by the teacher_    There are from one hundred and eighty to two hundred recitation periods  of forty-five minutes each, minus the holidays, opening exercises,  athletic mass meetings, and other respites, in which to teach a thousand  years of ancient history, twenty centuries of English history, or the  story of our own people. The age of the student will be from thirteen to  eighteen. His judgment is immature; his knowledge of books, small; his  interest, far from zealous. He will have three other subjects to prepare  and his time is limited. Also, he is a citizen of the Republic and by  his vote will shortly influence, for good or ill, the destinies of the  nation.    The purpose of this monograph is to discuss the means by which the  teacher can engender in this student a genuine enthusiasm for the  subject, stimulate research and historical judgment, correlate history,  geography, literature, and the arts, cultivate proper ideals of  government, establish a habit of systematic note-taking, and possibly  prepare the student for college entrance examinations.          II    HOW TO BEGIN THE COURSE      Very obviously each moment of the child's time and preparation should be  wisely directed. Each recitation should perform its full measure of  usefulness, in testing, drilling, and teaching. There will be no time  for valueless note-taking, duplication of map-book work, ambiguous or  foolish questioning, aimless argument, or junketing excursions.      _What should be done on the day of enrollment_    The day that the child enrolls in class should begin his assigned work.  In the first ten minutes of the first meeting of the class, while the  teacher is collecting the enrollment cards, he should also gather some  data as to his students' previous work in history. This information will  be of considerable assistance to the teacher in letting him know what he  may reasonably expect of his new pupils. The class should not depart  without a definite assignment for the next day. Let the preparation for  the first recitation consist in answering such questions as:--         1. What is the name of the text you are to use? (Know its precise          title.)         2. What is the name, reputation, and position of the author?         3. Of what other books is he the author?         4. Read the preface of the book.         5. What do you think are the purposes of the subject you are about          to take up?         6. Give the titles and authors of other books on the same period of          history.         7. What has been your method of study in other courses of history?      _What should be done at the first meeting of the class_    On the second day when the class assembles, let as many of the students  as possible be sent to the board to answer questions on the day's  assignment. The pupil will immediately discover that the teacher  purposes to hold the class strictly responsible for the preparation of  assigned work. The teacher will face a class prepared to ask intelligent  questions about the course they are entering upon. The class will  discover that work is to begin at once. The inertia of the vacation will  be immediately overcome.      _Necessity for definite instruction in methods of preparing a lesson_    Having secured, by class discussion and the work at the board,  satisfactory answers to the first six questions, and having assigned the  lesson for the next day, the remainder of the hour and, if necessary,  the rest of the week should be spent in outlining for the student a  method of study. That very few students of high school age possess  habits of systematic study, needs no discussion. In spite of all that  their grade teachers may have done for them, their tendency is to pass  over unfamiliar words, allusions, and expressions, without troubling to  use a dictionary. The"]]]
