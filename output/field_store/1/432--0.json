He was not, as was long believed, a  creature of the imagination of the artists, the superstition of the  managers, or a product of the absurd and impressionable brains of the  young ladies of the ballet, their mothers, the box-keepers, the  cloak-room attendants or the concierge.  Yes, he existed in flesh and  blood, although he assumed the complete appearance of a real phantom;  that is to say, of a spectral shade.    When I began to ransack the archives of the National Academy of Music I  was at once struck by the surprising coincidences between the phenomena  ascribed to the \"ghost\" and the most extraordinary and fantastic  tragedy that ever excited the Paris upper classes; and I soon conceived  the idea that this tragedy might reasonably be explained by the  phenomena in question.  The events do not date more than thirty years  back; and it would not be difficult to find at the present day, in the  foyer of the ballet, old men of the highest respectability, men upon  whose word one could absolutely rely, who would remember as though they  happened yesterday the mysterious and dramatic conditions that attended  the kidnapping of Christine Daae, the disappearance of the Vicomte de  Chagny and the death of his elder brother, Count Philippe, whose body  was found on the bank of the lake that exists in the lower cellars of  the Opera on the Rue-Scribe side.  But none of those witnesses had  until that day thought that there was any reason for connecting the  more or less legendary figure of the Opera ghost with that terrible  story.    The truth was slow to enter my mind, puzzled by an inquiry that at  every moment was complicated by events which, at first sight, might be  looked upon as superhuman; and more than once I was within an ace of  abandoning a task in which I was exhausting myself in the hopeless  pursuit of a vain image.  At last, I received the proof that my  presentiments had not deceived me, and I was rewarded for all my  efforts on the day when I acquired the certainty that the Opera ghost  was more than a mere shade.    On that day, I had spent long hours over THE MEMOIRS OF A MANAGER, the  light and frivolous work of the too-skeptical Moncharmin, who, during  his term at the Opera, understood nothing of the mysterious behavior of  the ghost and who was making all the fun of it that he could at the  very moment when he became the first victim of the curious financial  operation that went on inside the \"magic envelope.\"    I had just left the library in despair, when I met the delightful  acting-manager of our National Academy, who stood chatting on a landing  with a lively and well-groomed little old man, to whom he introduced me  gaily.  The acting-manager knew all about my investigations and how  eagerly and unsuccessfully I had been trying to discover the  whereabouts of the examining magistrate in the famous Chagny case, M.  Faure.  Nobody knew what had become of him, alive or dead; and here he  was back from Canada, where he had spent fifteen years, and the first  thing he had done, on his return to Paris, was to come to the  secretarial offices at the Opera and ask for a free seat.  The little  old man was M. Faure himself.    We spent a good part of the evening together and he told me the whole  Chagny case as he had understood it at the time.  He was bound to  conclude in favor of the madness of the viscount and the accidental  death of the elder brother, for lack of evidence to the contrary; but  he was nevertheless persuaded that a terrible tragedy had taken place  between the two brothers in connection with Christine Daae.  He could  not tell me what became of Christine or the viscount.  When I mentioned  the ghost, he only laughed.  He, too, had been told of the curious  manifestations that seemed to point to the existence of an abnormal  being, residing in one of the most mysterious corners of the Opera, and  he knew the story of the envelope; but he had never seen anything in it  worthy of his attention as magistrate in charge of the Chagny case, and  it was as much as he had done to listen to the evidence of a witness  who appeared of his own accord and declared that he had often met the  ghost.  This witness was none other than the man whom all Paris called  the \"Persian\" and who was well-known to every subscriber to the Opera.  The magistrate took him for a visionary.    I was immensely interested by this story of the Persian.  I wanted, if  there were still time, to find this valuable and eccentric witness.  My  luck began to improve and I discovered him in his little flat in the  Rue de Rivoli, where he had lived ever since and where he died five  months after my visit.  I was at first inclined to be suspicious; but  when the Persian had told me, with child-like candor, all that he knew  about the ghost and had handed me the proofs of the ghost's  existence--including the strange correspondence of Christine Daae--to  do as I pleased with, I was no longer able to doubt.  No, the ghost was  not a myth!    I have, I know, been told that this correspondence may have been forged  from first to last by a man whose imagination had certainly been fed on  the most seductive tales; but fortunately I discovered some of  Christine's writing outside the famous bundle of letters and, on a  comparison between the two, all my doubts were removed.  I also went  into the past history of the Persian and found that he was an upright  man, incapable of inventing a story that might have defeated the ends  of justice.    This, moreover, was the opinion of the more serious people who, at one  time or other, were mixed up in the Chagny case, who were friends of  the Chagny family, to whom I showed all my documents and set forth all  my inferences.  In this connection, I should like to print a few lines  which I received from General D----:    SIR:    I can not urge you too strongly to publish the results of your inquiry.  I remember perfectly that, a few weeks before the disappearance of that  great singer, Christine Daae, and the tragedy which threw the whole of  the Faubourg Saint-Germain into mourning, there was a great deal of  talk, in the foyer of the ballet, on the subject of the \"ghost;\" and I  believe that it only ceased to be discussed in consequence of the later  affair that excited us all so greatly.  But, if it be possible--as,  after hearing you, I believe--to explain the tragedy through the ghost,  then I beg you sir, to talk to us about the ghost again.    Mysterious though the ghost may at first appear, he will always be more  easily explained than the dismal story in which malevolent people have  tried to picture two brothers killing each other who had worshiped each  other all their lives.    Believe me, etc.    Lastly, with my bundle of papers in hand, I once more went over the  ghost's vast domain, the huge building which he had made his kingdom.  All that my eyes saw, all that my mind perceived, corroborated the  Persian's documents precisely; and a wonderful discovery crowned my  labors in a very definite fashion.  It will be remembered that, later,  when digging in the substructure of the Opera, before burying the  phonographic records of the artist's voice, the workmen laid bare a  corpse.  Well, I was at once able to prove that this corpse was that of  the Opera ghost.  I made the acting-manager put this proof to the test  with his own hand; and it is now a matter of supreme indifference to me  if the papers pretend that the body was that of a victim of the Commune.    The wretches who were massacred, under the Commune, in the cellars of  the Opera, were not buried on this side; I will tell where their  skeletons can be found in a spot not very far from that immense crypt  which was stocked during the siege with all sorts of provisions.  I  came upon this track just when I was looking for the remains of the  Opera ghost, which I should never have discovered but for the  unheard-of chance described above.    But we will return to the corpse and what ought to be done with it.  For the present, I must conclude this very necessary introduction by  thanking M. Mifroid (who was the commissary of police called in for the  first investigations after the disappearance of Christine Daae), M.  Remy, the late secretary, M. Mercier, the late acting-manager, M.  Gabriel, the late chorus-master, and more particularly Mme. la Baronne  de Castelot-Barbezac, who was once the \"little Meg\" of the story (and  who is not "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17530"],[0,"Maida's Little Shop (#1)"],[1,"Team at http://www.pgdp.net              Maida's Little Shop  By  Inez Haynes Irwin    Author of  MAIDA'S LITTLE HOUSE,  MAIDA'S LITTLE SCHOOL, ETC.

Three of them were  men. The fourth was a little girl. The little girl's name was Maida  Westabrook. The three men were \"Buffalo\" Westabrook, her father, Dr.  Pierce, her physician, and Billy Potter, her friend. They were  coming from Marblehead to Boston.    Maida sat in one corner of the back seat gazing dreamily out at the  whirling country. She found it very beautiful and very curious. They  were going so fast that all the reds and greens and yellows of the  autumn trees melted into one variegated band. A moment later they  came out on the ocean. And now on the water side were two other  streaks of color, one a spongy blue that was sky, another a clear  shining blue that was sea. Maida half-shut her eyes and the whole  world seemed to flash by in ribbons.    \"May I get out for a moment, papa?\" she asked suddenly in a thin  little voice. \"I'd like to watch the waves.\"    \"All right,\" her father answered briskly. To the chauffeur he said,  \"Stop here, Henri.\" To Maida, \"Stay as long as you want, Posie.\"    \"Posie\" was Mr. Westabrook's pet-name for Maida.    Billy Potter jumped out and helped Maida to the ground. The three  men watched her limp to the sea-wall.    She was a child whom you would have noticed anywhere because of her  luminous, strangely-quiet, gray eyes and because of the ethereal  look given to her face by a floating mass of hair, pale-gold and  tendrilly. And yet I think you would have known that she was a sick  little girl at the first glance. When she moved, it was with a great  slowness as if everything tired her. She was so thin that her hands  were like claws and her cheeks scooped in instead of out. She was  pale, too, and somehow her eyes looked too big. Perhaps this was  because her little heart-shaped face seemed too small.    \"You've got to find something that will take up her mind, Jerome,\"  Dr. Pierce said, lowering his voice, \"and you've got to be quick  about it. Just what Greinschmidt feared has come--that languor--that  lack of interest in everything. You've got to find something for her  to _do_.\"    Dr. Pierce spoke seriously. He was a round, short man, just exactly  as long any one way as any other. He had springy gray curls all over  his head and a nose like a button. Maida thought that he looked like  a very old but a very jolly and lovable baby. When he laughed--and he  was always laughing with Maida--he shook all over like jelly that has  been turned out of a jar. His very curls bobbed. But it seemed to  Maida that no matter how hard he chuckled, his eyes were always  serious when they rested on her.    Maida was very fond of Dr. Pierce. She had known him all her life.  He had gone to college with her father. He had taken care of her  health ever since Dr. Greinschmidt left. Dr. Greinschmidt was the  great physician who had come all the way across the ocean from  Germany to make Maida well. Before the operation Maida could not  walk. Now she could walk easily. Ever since she could remember she  had always added to her prayers at night a special request that she  might some day be like other little girls. Now she was like other  little girls, except that she limped. And yet now that she could do  all the things that other little girls did, she no longer cared to  do them--not even hopping and skipping, which she had always expected  would be the greatest fun in the world. Maida herself thought this  very strange.    \"But what can I find for her to do?\" \"Buffalo\" Westabrook said.    You could tell from the way he asked this question that he was not  accustomed to take advice from other people. Indeed, he did not look  it. But he looked his name. You would know at once why the  cartoonists always represented him with the head of a buffalo; why,  gradually, people had forgotten that his first name was Jerome and  referred to him always as \"Buffalo\" Westabrook.    Like the buffalo, his head was big and powerful and emerged from the  midst of a shaggy mane. But it was the way in which it was set on  his tremendous shoulders that gave him his nickname. When he spoke  to you, he looked as if he were about to charge. And the glance of  his eyes, set far back of a huge nose, cut through you like a pair  of knives.    It surprised Maida very much when she found that people stood in awe  of her father. It had never occurred to her to be afraid of him.    \"I've racked my brains to entertain her,\" \"Buffalo\" Westabrook went  on. \"I've bought her every gimcrack that's made for children--her  nursery looks like a toy factory. I've bought her prize ponies,  prize dogs and prize cats--rabbits, guinea-pigs, dancing mice,  talking parrots, marmosets--there's a young menagerie at the place in  the Adirondacks. I've had a doll-house and a little theater built  for her at Pride's. She has her own carriage, her own automobile,  her own railroad car. She can have her own flying-machine if she  wants it. I've taken her off on trips. I've taken her to the theater  and the circus. I've had all kinds of nurses and governesses and  companions, but they've been mostly failures. Granny Flynn's the  best of the hired people, but of course Granny's old. I've had other  children come to stay with her. Selfish little brutes they all  turned out to be! They'd play with her toys and ignore her  completely. And this fall I brought her to Boston, hoping her  cousins would rouse her. But the Fairfaxes decided suddenly to go  abroad this winter. If she'd only express a desire for something,  I'd get it for her--if it were one of the moons of Jupiter.\"    \"It isn't anything you can _give_ her,\" Dr. Pierce said impatiently;  \"you must find something for her to _do_.\"    \"Say, Billy, you're an observant little duck. Can't you tell us  what's the matter?\" \"Buffalo\" Westabrook smiled down at the third  man of the party.    \"The trouble with the child,\" Billy Potter said promptly, \"is that  everything she's had has been 'prize.' Not that it's spoiled her at  all. Petronilla is as simple as a princess in a fairy-tale.\"    \"Petronilla\" was Billy Potter's pet-name for Maida.    \"Yes, she's wonderfully simple,\" Dr. Pierce agreed. \"Poor little  thing, she's lived in a world of bottles and splints and bandages.  She's never had a chance to realize either the value or the  worthlessness of things.\"    \"And then,\" Billy went on, \"nobody's ever used an ounce of  imagination in entertaining the poor child.\"    \"Imagination!\" \"Buffalo\" Westabrook growled. \"What has imagination  to do with it?\"    Billy grinned.    Next to her father and Granny Flynn, Maida loved Billy Potter better  than anybody in the world. He was so little that she could never  decide whether he was a boy or a man. His chubby, dimply face was  the pinkest she had ever seen. From it twinkled a pair of blue eyes  the merriest she had ever seen. And falling continually down into  his eyes was a great mass of flaxen hair, the most tousled she had  ever seen.    Billy Potter lived in New York. He earned his living by writing for  newspapers and magazines. Whenever there was a fuss in Wall  Street--and the papers always blamed \"Buffalo\" Westabrook if this  happened--Billy Potter would have a talk with Maida's father. Then he  wrote up what Mr. Westabrook said and it was printed somewhere. Men  who wrote for the newspapers were always trying to talk with Mr.  Westabrook. Few of them ever got the chance. But \"Buffalo\"  Westabrook never refused to talk with Billy Potter. Indeed, the two  men were great friends.    \"He's one of the few reporters who can turn out a good story and  tell it straight as I give it to him,\" Maida had once heard her  father say. Maida knew that Billy could turn out good stories--he had  turned out a great many for her.    \"What has imagination to do with it?\" Mr. Westabrook repeated.    \"It would have a great deal to do with it, I fancy,\" Billy Potter  answered, \"if somebody would only imagine the right thing.\"    \"Well, imagine it yourself,\" Mr. Westabrook snarled. \"Imagination  seems to be the chief stock-in-trade of you newspaper men.\"    Billy grinned. When Billy smiled, two things happened--one to you and  the other to him. Your spirits went up and his eyes seemed to  disappear. Maida said that Billy's eyes \"skrinkled up.\" The effect  was so comic that she always laughed--not with him but at him.    \"All right,\" Billy agreed pleasantly; \"I'll put the greatest  creative mind of the century to work on the job.\"    \"You put it to work at once, young man,\" Dr. Pierce said. \"The thing  I'm trying to impress on you both is that you can't wait too long.\"    \"Buffalo\" Westabrook stirred uneasily. His fierce, blue eyes  retreated behind the frown in his thick brows until all you could  see were two shining points. He watched Maida closely as she limped  back to the car. \"What are you thinking of, Posie?\" he asked.    \"Oh, nothing, father,\" Maida said, smiling faintly. This was the  answer she gave most often to her father's questions. \"Is there  anything you want, Posie?\" he was sure to ask every morning, or,  \"What would you like me to get you to-day, little daughter?\" The  answer was invariable, given always in the same soft, thin little  voice: \"Nothing, "]]]
