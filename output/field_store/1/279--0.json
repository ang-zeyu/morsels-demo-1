OUTWITTING OUR  NERVES    A PRIMER OF PSYCHOTHERAPY    BY    JOSEPHINE A. JACKSON, M.D.  HELEN M. SALISBURY    [Illustration]    NEW YORK  THE CENTURY CO.  1922    1921, by  THE CENTURY CO.    PRINTED IN U.S.A.          TO    MARY PATTERSON MANLY    A LOVER OF TRUTH          FOREWORD      \"Your trouble is nervous. There is nothing we can cut out and there is  nothing we can give medicine for.\" With these words a young college  student was dismissed from one of our great diagnostic clinics.    The physician was right. In a nervous disorder there is nothing to cut  out and there is nothing to give medicine for. Nevertheless there is  something to be done,--something which is as definite and scientific  as a prescription or a surgical operation.    Psychotherapy, which is treatment by the mental measures of  psycho-analysis and re-education, is an established procedure in the  scientific world to-day. Nervous disorders are now curable, as has  been proved by the clinical results in scores of cases from civil  life, under treatment by Freud, Janet, Prince, Sidis, DuBois, and  others; and in thousands of cases of war neuroses as reported by Smith  and Pear, Eder, MacCurdy, and other military observers. These army  experts have shown that shell-shock in war is the same as nervousness  in civil life and that both may be cured by psycho-analysis and  re-education.    For more than a decade, in handling nervous cases, I have made use of  the findings of recognized authorities on psychopathology. Truths have  been applied in a special way, with the features of re-education so  emphasized that my home has been called a psychological  boarding-school. As the alumni have gone back to the game of life  with no haunting memories of usual sanatorium methods, but with the  equipment of a fuller self-knowledge and sense of power, they have  sent back a call for some word that shall extend this helpful message  to a larger circle.    There has come, too, a demand for a book which shall give accurate and  up-to-date information to those physicians who are eager for light on  the subject of nervous disorders, and especially for knowledge of the  significant contributions of Sigmund Freud, but who are too busy to  devote time to highly technical volumes outside their own specialties.    This need for a simple, comprehensive presentation of the Freudian  principles I have attempted to meet in this primer of psychotherapy,  providing enough of biological and psychological background to make  them intelligible, and enough application and illustration to make  them useful to the general practitioner or the average layman.

The man who is nervous and knows that he is  nervous, realizes that he needs help, but the man who has as yet felt  no lack of stability in himself is quite likely to be impatient with  that whole class of people who are liable to nervous breakdown. It is  therefore well to remind ourselves at once that the line between the  so-called \"normal\" and the nervous is an exceedingly fine one.  \"Nervous invalids and well people are indistinguishable both in theory  and in practice,\"[1] and \"after all we are most of us more or less  neurasthenic.\"[2] The fact is that everybody is a possible neurotic.    [Footnote 1: Putnam: _Human Motives_, p. 117.]    [Footnote 2: DuBois: _Physic Treatment of Nervous Disorders_, p. 172.]    So, as we think about nervous folk and begin to recognize our friends  and relatives in this class, it may be that some of us will  unexpectedly find ourselves looking in the mirror. Some of our  lifelong habits may turn out to be nervous tricks. At any rate, it  behooves us to be careful about throwing stones, for most of us live  in houses that are at least part glass.      THE EARMARKS    =Am I \"Like Folks\"?= Before we begin to talk about the real sufferer  from \"nerves,\" the nervous invalid, let us look for some of the  earmarks that are often found on the supposedly well person. All of  these signs are deviations from the normal and are sure indications of  nervousness. The test question for each individual is this: \"Am I  'like folks'?\" To be normal and to be well is to be \"like folks.\" Can  the average man stand this or that? If he can, then you are not normal  if you cannot. Do the people around you eat the thing that upsets you?  If they do, ten chances to one your trouble is not a physical  idiosyncrasy, but a nervous habit. In bodily matters, at least, it is  a good thing to be one of the crowd.    Many people who would resent being called anything but normal--in  general--are not at all loth to be thought \"different,\" when it comes  to particulars. Are there not many of us who are at small pains to  hide the fact that we \"didn't sleep a wink last night,\" or that we  \"can't stand\" a ticking clock or a crowing rooster? We sometimes  consider it a mark of distinction to have a delicate appetite and to  have to choose our food with care. If we are frank with ourselves,  some of us will have to admit that our own ailments seem interesting,  while the other person's ills are \"merely nervous\" or imaginary or  abnormal. After all, a good many of us will have to plead guilty to  the charge of nervousness.    We have only to read the endless advertisements of cathartics and  \"internal baths,\" or to check up the quantity of laxatives sold at any  drug store, to realize the wide-spread bondage to that great bugaboo  constipation. He who is constipated can hardly prove an alibi to  \"nerves.\" Then there are the school-teachers and others who are worn  out at the end of each year's work, hardly able to hold on until  vacation; and the people who can't manage their tempers; and those who  are upset over trifles; and those who are dissatisfied with life. To a  certain degree, at least, all of these are nervous persons. The list  grows.    =Half-Power Engines.= These people are all supposed to be well. They  keep going--by fits and starts--and as they are used to running on  three cylinders, with frequent stops for repairs, they accept this  rate of living as a matter of course, never realizing that they might  be sixty horse-power engines, instead of their little thirty or forty.  For this large and neglected class of people psychotherapy has a  stimulating message, and for them many of the following pages have  been written.    =The Real Sufferers.= These so-called normal people are merely on the  fringe of nervousness, on the border line between normality and  disease. Beyond them there exists a great company of those whose lives  have been literally wrecked by \"nerves.\" Their work interrupted or  given up for good, their minds harassed by doubts and fears, their  bodies incapacitated, they crowd the sanatoria and the health resorts  in a vain search for health. From New England to Florida they seek,  and on to Colorado and California, and perhaps to Hawaii and the  Orient, thinking by rest and change to pull themselves together and  become whole again. There are thousands of these people--lawyers,  preachers, teachers, mothers, social workers, business and  professional folk of all sorts, the kind of persons the world needs  most--laid off for months or years of treatment, on account of some  kind of nervous disorder.    =Various Types of Nervousness.= The psychoneuroses are of many  forms.[3] To some people \"nerves\" means nervous prostration,  breakdown, fatigue, weakness, insomnia, the blues, upset stomach, or  unsteady heart,--all signs of so-called neurasthenia or  nerve-weakness. To others the word \"nerves\" calls up memories of  strange, emotional storms that seem to rise out of nowhere, to sweep  the sky clear of everything else, and to pass as they came, leaving  the victim and the family equally mystified as to their meaning.

Ferme de Turpe, Normandy.]          THE BROCHURE SERIES    OF ARCHITECTURAL ILLUSTRATION.    VOL. I.    OCTOBER, 1895.    No. 10          FRENCH FARMHOUSES.      As it is the purpose of THE BROCHURE SERIES to cover as wide a field  as possible in choice of subject matter for its illustrations, and at  the same time hold rigidly to the idea of furnishing only what will  be useful to its subscribers, it has seemed desirable to present  something a little nearer our everyday life than the Italian work  which has thus far formed the greater part of the plate matter.    The domestic architecture of France and England has naturally served  as a model for a great deal of our American work, and especially is  this noticeable during the present generation in the close relation  between the French chateaux and the more pretentious American  residences, as witness the recent productions of the late Mr. Hunt,  which have just been published since his death. We are, to be  sure, looking in all directions for suggestions, and it cannot help  appearing wonderful to a thoughtful observer how many and varied these  suggestions are.    Our wealthy citizens are building chateaux in the style of Francis  I or of somebody else, Venetian or Florentine palaces, Roman  villas, Flemish guild-halls, Elizabethan half-timber houses. All,  if tastefully and skilfully designed and placed, have their special  points of beauty and excellence, and all may in the hands of an  architect of ability be made to harmonize with our modern ways of  living and the surroundings in which they must take a part.    None of these models, however, are more adaptable to our ways than the  country houses of France. This, of course, should not be understood  as meaning that any of these buildings can be transplanted bodily to  American soil and still be satisfactory. Architectural borrowing of  this class is never satisfactory; but no architecture of which we have  any knowledge is independent of precedent, and it only behooves us to  adopt from the experience of others those features or ideas which are  most suited to our needs. The plans and the original uses of the rooms  of these French _manoirs_ may not prove directly adaptable to our  ways of living, but the general massing of the design and the rambling  arrangement of plan, as well as the picturesqueness of it all, are  characteristics which can well be embodied in our country houses. In  their way, no better models can be found than the two _manoirs_ from  Normandy which we illustrate in this number. They have both suffered  from the ravages of time and hard usage, and both are at present, and  for a long time have been, used as farmhouses. The Manoir d'Ango is  the finer and more important of the two, and is better preserved in  some of its more interesting features.    [Illustration: LXXIV. Ferme de Turpe, Normandy.]    It is one of the main beauties of the charming village of  Varengeville-sur-Mer, on the north coast of Normandy. It is now  converted into a farmhouse, but in it once a celebrated privateersman  of Dieppe received the ambassadors of the King of Portugual. There are  still many evidences of the former dignity and grandeur in its present  degradation.    Ango was strictly a _manoir_ in the French sense, that is, a residence  of the second class--not a chateau, such as Chambord or Blois.    The principal part of the building consists of but one story with  an open gallery beneath, supported by an arcade with columns bearing  finely carved caps ornamented with female heads, angels, etc.    In the interior as well as on the exterior may be seen fragments of  sculpture which show much refinement. In one of the rooms of the tower  a monumental mantel carved in stone bears in its centre the bust of an  old man having in his hand a globe surmounted by a cross, the imperial  emblem. This may be the portrait of one of the founders of the Ango  family.      LXXIII to LXXVI.    FERME DE TURPE, NORMANDY.      The Ferme de Turpe is situated near the town of Neuchatel-en-Bray,  famous for its cheese. It has fewer interesting details than the  Manoir d'Ango and is in even poorer repair, but in massing and general  picturesque effect it offers many suggestions which can be utilized to  advantage in our country houses.    Of these four views very little need be said. The charming  picturesqueness of the two general views is sufficient excuse  for presenting them, but they contain much more to the student of  architecture who cares to look for it. The two detailed views give an  excellent idea of the simple, straightforward methods of the builders.      LXXVII to LXXX.    MANOIR D'ANGO. NORMANDY.      This building was erected between the years 1530 and 1542. Its general  design and especially its detail are of the Francois I type, and very  beautifully executed, as will be seen from the larger scale details.  The materials as indicated are stone and brick.    In Benoist's La Normandie Illustrie a remarkably interesting circular  brick dove-cote is shown in the courtyard of this _manoir_, but it  does not appear in any of our views, and may have been demolished  since M. Benoist's sketches were made in 1852. Its walls were  decorated with colored brick, laid in bands and diaper patterns.          Club Notes.      The Baltimore Architectural Club commenced its active work for  the season on the first of October. It has its rooms in the Wilson  Building, Saratoga and Charles Streets, which are always open for the  use of its members, and there will be regular meetings every Thursday  evening during the winter and spring. At these meetings various  subjects of interest will occupy the attention of the members, both of  a practical and aesthetic character.    At one meeting of each month there will be an informal talk or  lecture on some of the mechanical, constructive or sanitary questions  connected with architecture.    On one evening there will be sketching from the cast, and on another  an impromptu sketch projet, to be completed in an hour. In addition  to these there will be competed for three of the larger and more  important regular projets, such as were made last season by the Club,  and for which two prizes are offered to those obtaining the first and  second place in point of general merit.    The present officers and Board of Control of the Baltimore  Architectural Club are J.B. Noel Wyatt, W. Emmart, Wm. G. Noelting,  Geo. Worthington, W.M. Ellicott, W.G. Keimig, and Charles Anderson.           *       *       *       *       *    The last meeting of the T Square Club of Philadelphia, was one of  unusual activity. The annual election of officers and the competition  of summer sketches as called for by the Club syllabus was found to be  too much for one evening, and consequently the judging of the sketches  was postponed a week.    The following officers were elected: President, Albert Kelsey;  Vice-President, Edgar V. Seeler; Secretary, A.B. Lacey; Treasurer,  David K. Boyd; Executive Committee, Walter Cope, Louis C. Hickman,  William L. Price.    The summer sketches, which were judged at one of the Club's Bohemian  Nights, were of unusual quality and quantity. Walter Cope, who won  first mention, had a large collection of pencil drawings representing  the fruits of his labor in Spain.    Walter Price (who won third place) and John Bissegger had one end of  the room covered with sketches in color and line made during a recent  trip through England, and Wilson Eyre, Jr., the winner of the second  mention, had a variety of subjects beautifully rendered on quaint  paper, and in his well-known and ever novel way.    [Illustration: LXXV. Ferme de Turpe, Normandy.]    Music and beer were plentiful, and had a cheering effect upon Titus,  Dull, Kelsey, and Klauder, whose summer work failed to score a  mention.    The syllabus of the Club's work for the coming year has just been  issued and contains some features of special interest. The problems in  design are chosen with much care and the programmes are more explicit  than is usual, and will doubtless contribute to the usefulness of the  work to be done.    The T Square Club appears to be more fortunate than some of the other  architectural clubs in having interested and succeeded in holding the  interest of a number of the stronger of the older men among the local  architects. It now numbers about one hundred and twenty members,  and its work is necessarily having considerable influence in outside  circles.    Its example is a good one to hold up before other and less influential  clubs.           *       *       *       *       *    Among the architectural clubs thus far noticed in this column no  account has been taken of the clubs connected with the architectural  schools. Of these there are at present several which are doing good  and effective work, but the only one of which we have data for a  description is that connected with Lehigh University. The school of  architecture, as it is called, is not a school of architecture at all,  but of engineering (which is a very different thing), but its work  is none the less dignified or important on this account, and the  opportunity open to the students' club is in consequence a wider and  more serious one than usual if they choose to concern themselves with  artistic considerations.    Two years ago the first class in architecture graduated from the  Lehigh University, and since that time the classes have continually  increased, until now the course is a distinct one in the curriculum  of studies of the University. The objects of the department are to  provide a thorough training in architectural engineering, with such  additional studies in history, design, and drawing as must necessarily  accompany all architectural problems.    The first year is of a preparatory nature in which no distinctively  architectural subject is taken up, and in the second year the subjects  are"]]]
