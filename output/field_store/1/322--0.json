ZANE GREY.            THE DAY OF THE BEAST          CHAPTER I    His native land! Home!      The ship glided slowly up the Narrows; and from its deck Daren Lane  saw the noble black outline of the Statue of Liberty limned against  the clear gold of sunset. A familiar old pang in his breast--longing  and homesickness and agony, together with the physical burn of gassed  lungs--seemed to swell into a profound overwhelming emotion.    \"My own--my native land!\" he whispered, striving to wipe the dimness  from his eyes. Was it only two years or twenty since he had left his  country to go to war? A sense of strangeness dawned upon him. His  home-coming, so ceaselessly dreamed of by night and longed for by day,  was not going to be what his hopes had created. But at that moment his  joy was too great to harbor strange misgivings. How impossible for any  one to understand his feelings then, except perhaps the comrades who  had survived the same ordeal!    The vessel glided on. A fresh cool spring breeze with a scent of land  fanned Lane's hot brow. It bore tidings from home. Almost he thought  he smelled the blossoms in the orchard, and the damp newly plowed  earth, and the smoke from the wood fire his mother used to bake over.  A hundred clamoring thoughts strove for dominance over his mind--to  enter and flash by and fade. His sight, however, except for the blur  that returned again and again, held fast to the entrancing and  thrilling scene--the broad glimmering sun-track of gold in the  rippling channel, leading his eye to the grand bulk of America's  symbol of freedom, and to the stately expanse of the Hudson River,  dotted by moving ferry-boats and tugs, and to the magnificent broken  sky-line of New York City, with its huge dark structures looming and  its thousands of windows reflecting the fire of the sun.    It was indeed a profound and stirring moment for Daren Lane, but not  quite full, not all-satisfying. The great city seemed to frown. The  low line of hills in the west shone dull gray and cold. Where were the  screaming siren whistles, the gay streaming flags, the boats crowded  with waving people, that should have welcomed disabled soldiers who  had fought for their country? Lane hoped he had long passed by  bitterness, but yet something rankled in the unhealed wound of his  heart.    Some one put a hand in close clasp upon his arm. Then Lane heard the  scrape of a crutch on the deck, and knew who stood beside him.    \"Well, Dare, old boy, does it look good to you?\" asked a husky voice.    \"Yes, Blair, but somehow not just what I expected,\" replied Lane,  turning to his comrade.    \"Uhuh, I get you.\"    Blair Maynard stood erect with the aid of a crutch. There was even a  hint of pride in the poise of his uncovered head. And for once Lane  saw the thin white face softening and glowing. Maynard's big brown  eyes were full of tears.    \"Guess I left my nerve as well as my leg over there,\" he said.    \"Blair, it's so good to get back that we're off color,\" returned Lane.  \"On the level, I could scream like a madman.\"    \"I'd like to weep,\" replied the other, with a half laugh.    \"Where's Red? He oughtn't miss this.\"    \"Poor devil! He sneaked off from me somewhere,\" rejoined Maynard.  \"Red's in pretty bad shape again. The voyage has been hard on him. I  hope he'll be well enough to get his discharge when we land. I'll take  him home to Middleville.\"    \"Middleville!\" echoed Lane, musingly. \"Home!... Blair, does it hit  you--kind of queer? Do you long, yet dread to get home?\"    Maynard had no reply for that query, but his look was expressive.    \"I've not heard from Helen for over a year,\" went on Lane, more as if  speaking to himself.    \"My God, Dare!\" exclaimed his companion, with sudden fire. \"Are you  still thinking of her?\"    \"We--we are engaged,\" returned Lane, slowly. \"At least we _were_. But  I've had no word that she----\"    \"Dare, your childlike faith is due for a jar,\" interrupted his  comrade, with bitter scorn. \"Come down to earth. You're a crippled  soldier--coming home--and damn lucky at that.\"    \"Blair, what do you know--that I do not know? For long I've suspected  you're wise to--to things at home. You know I haven't heard much in  all these long months. My mother wrote but seldom. Lorna, my kid  sister, forgot me, I guess.... Helen always was a poor correspondent.  Dal answered my letters, but she never _told_ me anything about home.  When we first got to France I heard often from Margie Henderson and  Mel Iden--crazy kind of letters--love-sick over soldiers.... But  nothing for a long time now.\"    \"At first they wrote! Ha! Ha!\" burst out Maynard. \"Sure, they wrote  love-sick letters. They sent socks and cigarettes and candy and books.  And they all wanted us to hurry back to marry them.... Then--when the  months had gone by and the novelty had worn off--when we went against  the hell of real war--sick or worn out, sleepless and miserable,  crippled or half demented with terror and dread and longing for  home--then, by God, they quit!\"    \"Oh, no, Blair--not all of them,\" remonstrated Lane, unsteadily.    \"Well, old man, I'm sore, and you're about the only guy I can let out  on,\" explained Maynard, heavily. \"One thing I'm glad of--we'll face it  together. Daren, we were kids together--do you remember?--playing on  the commons--straddling the old water-gates over the brooks--stealing  cider from the country presses--barefoot boys going to school  together. We played Post-Office with the girls and Indians with the  boys. We made puppy love to Dal and Mel and Helen and Margie--all of  them.... Then, somehow the happy thoughtless years of youth passed....  It seems strange and sudden now--but the war came. We enlisted. We  had the same ideal--you and I.--We went to France--and you know what  we did there together.... Now we're on this ship--getting into port of  the good old U.S.--good as bad as she is!--going home together. Thank  God for that. I want to be buried in Woodlawn.... Home! Home?... We  feel its meaning. But, Dare, we'll have no home--no place.... We are  old--we are through--we have served--we are done.... What we dreamed  of as glory will be cold ashes to our lips, bitter as gall.... You  always were a dreamer, an idealist, a believer in God, truth, hope and  womanhood. In spite of the war these somehow survive in you.... But  Dare, old friend, steel yourself now against disappointment and  disillusion.\"    Used as Lane was to his comrade's outbursts, this one struck  singularly home to Lane's heart and made him mute. The chill of his  earlier misgiving returned, augmented by a strange uneasiness, a  premonition of the unknown and dreadful future. But he threw it off.  Faith would not die in Lane. It could not die utterly because of what  he felt in himself. Yet--what was in store for him? Why was his hope  so unquenchable? There could be no _resurgam_ for Daren Lane.  Resignation should have brought him peace--peace--when every nerve in  his shell-shocked body racked him--when he could not subdue a mounting  hope that all would be well at home--when he quivered at thought of  mother, sister, sweetheart!    The ship glided on under the shadow of America's emblem--a bronze  woman of noble proportions, holding out a light to ships that came in  the night--a welcome to all the world. Daren Lane held to his maimed  comrade while they stood bare-headed and erect for that moment when  the ship passed the statue. Lane knew what Blair felt. But nothing of  what that feeling was could ever be spoken. The deck of the ship was  now crowded with passengers, yet they were seemingly dead to anything  more than a safe arrival at their destination. They were not crippled  American soldiers. Except these two there were none in service  uniforms. There across the windy space of water loomed the many-eyed  buildings, suggestive of the great city. A low roar of traffic came on  the breeze. Passengers and crew of the liner were glad to dock before  dark. They took no notice of the rigid, erect soldiers. Lane, arm in  arm with Blair, face to the front, stood absorbed in his sense of a  nameless sublimity for them while passing the Statue of Liberty. The  spirit of the first man who ever breathed of freedom for the human  race burned as a white flame in the heart of Lane and his comrade. But  it was not so much that spirit which held them erect, aloof, proud. It  was a supreme consciousness of immeasurable sacrifice for an ideal  that existed only in the breasts of men and women kindred to them--an  unutterable and never-to-be-spoken glory of the duty done for others,  but that they owed themselves. They had sustained immense loss of  health and happiness; the future seemed like the gray, cold, gloomy  expanse of the river; and there could never be any reward except this  white fire of their souls. Nameless! But it was the increasing purpose  that ran through the ages.    The ship docked at dark. Lane left Blair at the rail, gloomily"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15675"],[0,"A Voyage to New Holland, Etc. in the Year 1699 (#1)"],[1,"by canadiana.org (http://www.canadiana.org/ECO/mtq?doc=34674)                  A VOYAGE TO NEW HOLLAND ETC.

To the Right Honourable Thomas, Earl of Pembroke,    Lord President of Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council.    My Lord,    The honour I had of being employed in the service of his late Majesty of  illustrious memory, at the time when Your Lordship presided at the  Admiralty, gives me the boldness to ask your protection of the following  papers. They consist of some remarks made upon very distant climates,  which I should have the vanity to think altogether new, could I persuade  myself they had escaped Your Lordship's knowledge. However I have been so  cautious of publishing any thing in my whole book that is generally known  that I have denied myself the pleasure of paying the due honours to Your  Lordship's name in the Dedication. I am ashamed, My Lord, to offer you so  imperfect a present, having not time to set down all the memoirs of my  last voyage: but, as the particular service I have now undertaken hinders  me from finishing this volume, so I hope it will give me an opportunity  of paying my respects to Your Lordship in a new one.    The world is apt to judge of everything by the success; and whoever has  ill fortune will hardly be allowed a good name. This, My Lord, was my  unhappiness in my late expedition in the Roebuck, which foundered through  perfect age near the island of Ascension. I suffered extremely in my  reputation by that misfortune; though I comfort myself with the thoughts  that my enemies could not charge any neglect upon me. And since I have  the honour to be acquitted by Your Lordship's judgment I should be very  humble not to value myself upon so complete a vindication. This and a  world of other favours which I have been so happy as to receive from Your  Lordship's goodness, do engage me to be with an everlasting respect,    My Lord,    Your Lordship's most faithful and obedient servant,    WILL. DAMPIER.      THE PREFACE.    The favourable reception my two former volumes of voyages and  descriptions have already met with in the world gives me reason to hope  that, notwithstanding the objections which have been raised against me by  prejudiced persons, this third volume likewise may in some measure be  acceptable to candid and impartial readers who are curious to know the  nature of the inhabitants, animals, plants, soil, etc. in those distant  countries, which have either seldom or not at all been visited by any  Europeans.    It has almost always been the fate of those who have made new discoveries  to be disesteemed and slightly spoken of by such as either have had no  true relish and value for the things themselves that are discovered, or  have had some prejudice against the persons by whom the discoveries were  made. It would be vain therefore and unreasonable in me to expect to  escape the censure of all, or to hope for better treatment than far  worthier persons have met with before me. But this satisfaction I am sure  of having, that the things themselves in the discovery of which I have  been employed are most worthy of our diligentest search and inquiry;  being the various and wonderful works of God in different parts of the  world: and however unfit a person I may be in other respects to have  undertaken this task, yet at least I have given a faithful account, and  have found some things undiscovered by any before, and which may at least  be some assistance and direction to better qualified persons who"]]]
