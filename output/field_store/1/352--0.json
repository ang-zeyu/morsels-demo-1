SIR HORACE SMITH-DORRIEN  One of the British Corps Commanders  (_From Painting by John St Helier Lander._)]          THE NEW YORK TIMES    CURRENT HISTORY OF THE EUROPEAN WAR    JANUARY 23, 1915.          Sir John French's Own Story    The Famous Dispatches of the British Commander in Chief to Lord  Kitchener, Secretary of State for War.          I.    *First Report from the Front*      7th September, 1914.    My lord: I have the honor to report the proceedings of the field force  under my command up to the time of rendering this dispatch.    1. The transport of the troops from England both by sea and by rail was  effected in the best order and without a check. Each unit arrived at its  destination in this country well within the scheduled time.    The concentration was practically complete on the evening of Friday, the  21st ultimo, and I was able to make dispositions to move the force  during Saturday, the 22d, to positions I considered most favorable from  which to commence operations which the French Commander in Chief, Gen.  Joffre, requested me to undertake in pursuance of his plans in  prosecution of the campaign.    The line taken up extended along the line of the canal from Conde on the  west, through Mons and Binche on the east. This line was taken up as  follows:    From Conde to Mons inclusive was assigned to the Second Corps, and to  the right of the Second Corps from Mons the First Corps was posted. The  Fifth Cavalry Brigade was placed at Binche.    In the absence of my Third Army Corps I desired to keep the cavalry  division as much as possible as a reserve to act on my outer flank, or  move in support of any threatened part of the line. The forward  reconnoissance was intrusted to Brig. Gen. Sir Philip Chetwode with the  Fifth Cavalry Brigade, but I directed Gen. Allenby to send forward a few  squadrons to assist in this work.    During the 22d and 23d these advanced squadrons did some excellent work,  some of them penetrating as far as Soignies, and several encounters took  place in which our troops showed to great advantage.    2. At 6 A.M., on Aug. 23, I assembled the commanders of the First and  Second Corps and cavalry division at a point close to the position and  explained the general situation of the Allies, and what I understood to  be Gen. Joffre's plan. I discussed with them at some length the  immediate situation in front of us.    From information I received from French Headquarters I understood that  little more than one, or at most two, of the enemy's army corps, with  perhaps one cavalry division, were in front of my position; and I was  aware of no attempted outflanking movement by the enemy. I was confirmed  in this opinion by the fact that my patrols encountered no undue  opposition in their reconnoitring operations. The observations of my  aeroplanes seemed also to bear out this estimate.    About 3 P.M. on Sunday, the 23d, reports began coming in to the effect  that the enemy was commencing an attack on the Mons line, apparently in  some strength, but that the right of the position from Mons and Bray was  being particularly threatened.    The commander of the First Corps had pushed his flank back to some high  ground south of Bray, and the Fifth Cavalry Brigade evacuated Binche,  moving slightly south; the enemy thereupon occupied Binche.    The right of the Third Division, under Gen. Hamilton, was at Mons, which  formed a somewhat dangerous salient; and I directed the commander of the  Second Corps to be careful not to keep the troops on this salient too  long, but, if threatened seriously, to draw back the centre behind Mons.  This was done before dark. In the meantime, about 5 P.M., I received a  most unexpected message from Gen. Joffre by telegraph, telling me that  at least three German corps, viz., a reserve corps, the Fourth Corps and  the Ninth Corps, were moving on my position in front, and that the  Second Corps was engaged in a turning movement from the direction of  Tournay. He also informed me that the two reserve French divisions and  the Fifth French Army on my right were retiring, the Germans having on  the previous day gained possession of the passages of the Sambre  between Charleroi and Namur.    3. In view of the possibility of my being driven from the Mons position,  I had previously [Transcriber: original 'previouly'] ordered a position  in rear to be reconnoitred. This position rested on the fortress of  Maubeuge on the right and extended west to Jenlain, southeast of  Valenciennes, on the left. The position was reported difficult to hold,  because standing crops and buildings made the siting of trenches very  difficult and limited the field of fire in many important localities. It  nevertheless afforded a few good artillery positions.    When the news of the retirement of the French and the heavy German  threatening on my front reached me, I endeavored to confirm it by  aeroplane [Transcriber: original 'areoplane'] reconnoissance; and as a  result of this I determined to effect a retirement to the Maubeuge  position at daybreak on the 24th.    A certain amount of fighting continued along the whole line throughout  the night and at daybreak on the 24th the Second Division from the  neighborhood of Harmignies made a powerful demonstration as if to retake  Binche. This was supported by the artillery of both the First and Second  Divisions, while the First Division took up a supporting position in the  neighborhood of Peissant. Under cover of this demonstration the Second  Corps retired on the line Dour-Quarouble-Frameries. The Third Division  on the right of the corps suffered considerable loss in this operation  from the enemy, who had retaken Mons.    The Second Corps halted on this line, where they partially intrenched  themselves, enabling Sir Douglas Haig with the First Corps gradually to  withdraw to the new position; and he effected this without much further  loss, reaching the line Bavai-Maubeuge about 7 P.M. Toward midday the  enemy appeared to be directing his principal effort against our left.    I had previously ordered Gen. Allenby with the cavalry to act vigorously  in advance of my left front and endeavor to take the pressure off.    About 7:30 A.M. Gen. Allenby received a message from Sir Charles  Fergusson, commanding the Fifth Division, saying that he was very hard  pressed and in urgent need of support. On receipt of this message Gen.  Allenby drew in the cavalry and endeavored to bring direct support to  the Fifth Division.    During the course of this operation Gen. De Lisle, of the Second Cavalry  Brigade, thought he saw a good opportunity to paralyze the further  advance of the enemy's infantry by making a mounted attack on his flank.  He formed up and advanced for this purpose, but was held up by wire  about 500 yards from his objective, and the Ninth Lancers and the  Eighteenth Hussars suffered severely in the retirement of the brigade.    The Nineteenth Infantry Brigade, which had been guarding the line of  communications, was brought up by rail to Valenciennes on the 22d and  23d. On the morning of the 24th they were moved out to a position south  of Quarouble to support the left flank of the Second Corps.    With the assistance of the cavalry Sir Horace Smith-Dorrien was enabled  to effect his retreat to a new position; although, having two corps of  the enemy on his front and one threatening his flank, he suffered great  losses in doing so.    At nightfall the position was occupied by the Second Corps to the west  of Bavai, the First Corps to the right. The right was protected by the  fortress of Maubeuge, the left by the Nineteenth Brigade in position  between Jenlain and Bry, and the cavalry on the outer flank.    4. The French were still retiring, and I had no support except such as  was afforded by the Fortress of Maubeuge; and the determined attempts of  the enemy to get round my left flank assured me that it was his  intention to hem me against that place and surround me. I felt that not  a moment must be lost in retiring to another position.    I had every reason to believe that the enemy's forces were somewhat  exhausted and I knew that they had suffered heavy losses. I hoped,  therefore, that his pursuit would not be too vigorous to prevent me  effecting my object.    The operation, however, was full of danger and difficulty, not only  owing to the very superior force in my front, but also to the exhaustion  of the troops.    The retirement was recommenced in the early morning of the 25th to a  position in the neighborhood of Le Cateau, and rearguards were ordered  to be clear of the Maubeuge-Bavai-Eth Road by 5:30 A.M.    Two cavalry brigades, with the divisional cavalry of the Second Corps,  covered the movement of the Second Corps. The remainder of the cavalry  division, with the Nineteenth Brigade, the whole under the command of  Gen. Allenby, covered the west flank.    The Fourth Division commenced its detrainment at Le Cateau on Sunday,  the 23d, and by the morning of the 25th eleven battalions and a brigade  of artillery with divisional staff were available for service.    I ordered Gen. Snow to move out to take up a position with his right  south of Solesmes, his left resting on"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16370"],[0,"Lameness of the Horse (#1)"],[1,"Note: Project Gutenberg also has an HTML version of this        file which includes the original illustrations.

Veterinary Practitioners' Series    No. 1    LAMENESS OF THE HORSE    by    J. V. Lacroix, D.V.S.    Professor of Surgery, The Kansas City Veterinary College  Author of \"Animal Castration\"    Illustrated    Chicago  American Journal Of Veterinary Medicine    1916                PREFACE      All that can be known on the subject of lameness, is founded on a  knowledge of anatomy and of the physiology of locomotion. Without such  knowledge, no one can master the principles of the diagnosis of  lameness. However, it must be assumed that the readers are informed on  these subjects, as it is impossible to include this fundamental  instruction in a work so brief as this one.    The technic of certain operative or corrective procedures, has been  described at length only where such methods are not generally employed.  Where there is no departure from the usual methods, treatment that is  essentially within the domain of surgery or practice is not given in  specific detail.    Realizing the need for a treatise in the English language dealing with  diagnosis and treatment of lameness, the author undertook the  preparation of this manuscript. That the difficulties of depicting by  means of word-pictures, the symptoms evinced in baffling cases of  lameness, presented themselves in due course of writing, it is needless  to say.    It is hoped that this volume will serve its readers to the end that the  handling of cases of lameness will become a more satisfactory and  successful part of their work; that both the practitioner and his  clients may profit thereby; and last but by no means least, that the  horse, which has given such incalculable service to mankind and is  deserving of a more concrete reward, will be benefited by the  application of the principles herein outlined.    In addition to the consultation of standard works bearing on various  phases of the subject of lameness, the author wishes to thankfully  acknowledge helpful advice and assistance received from the publisher,  Dr. D.M. Campbell; to appreciatively credit Drs. L.A. Merillat, A.  Trickett and F.F. Brown for valuable suggestions given from time to  time. Particular acknowledgment is made to Dr. Septimus Sisson, author,  and W.B. Saunders & Co., publishers of The Anatomy of Domestic Animals,  for permission to use a number of illustrations from that work.
