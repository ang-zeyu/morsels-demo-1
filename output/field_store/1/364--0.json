Unfortunately a uniform system of transcription, applicable       to all tongues, seems not to be practical at present. It was       attempted in the Sacred Books of the East, but that system       has fallen into disuse and is liable to be misunderstood. It       therefore seems best to use for each language the method of       transcription adopted by standard works in English dealing       with each, for French and German transcriptions, whatever       their merits may be as representations of the original       sounds, are often misleading to English readers, especially       in Chinese. For Chinese I have adopted Wade's system as used       in Giles's Dictionary, for Tibetan the system of Sarat       Chandra Das, for Pali that of the Pali Text Society and for       Sanskrit that of Monier-Williams's Sanskrit Dictionary,       except that I write s instead of s. Indian languages however       offer many difficulties: it is often hard to decide whether       Sanskrit or vernacular forms are more suitable and in       dealing with Buddhist subjects whether Sanskrit or Pali       words should be used. I have found it convenient to vary the       form of proper names according as my remarks are based on       Sanskrit or on Pali literature, but this obliges me to write       the same word differently in different places, e.g.       sometimes Ajatasatru and sometimes Ajatasattu, just as in a       book dealing with Greek and Latin mythology one might employ       both Herakles and Hercules. Also many Indian names such as       Ramayana, Krishna, nirvana have become Europeanized or at       least are familiar to all Europeans interested in Indian       literature. It seems pedantic to write them with their full       and accurate complement of accents and dots and my general       practice is to give such words in their accurate spelling       (Ramayana, etc.) when they are first mentioned and also in       the notes but usually to print them in their simpler and       unaccented forms. I fear however that my practice in this       matter is not entirely consistent since different parts of       the book were written at different times.\"      LIST OF ABBREVIATIONS  [From Volume 1]    The following are the principal abbreviations used:    Ep.

HINDU PHILOSOPHY                  BOOK IV    THE MAHAYANA          CHAPTER XVI    MAIN FEATURES OF THE MAHAYANA      The obscurest period in the history of Buddhism is that which follows  the reign of Asoka, but the enquirer cannot grope for long in these  dark ages without stumbling upon the word Mahayana. This is the name  given to a movement which in its various phases may be regarded as a  philosophical school, a sect and a church, and though it is not always  easy to define its relationship to other schools and sects it  certainly became a prominent aspect of Buddhism in India about the  beginning of our era besides achieving enduring triumphs in the Far  East. The word[1] signifies Great Vehicle or Carriage, that is a means  of conveyance to salvation, and is contrasted with Hinayana, the  Little Vehicle, a name bestowed on the more conservative party though  not willingly accepted by them. The simplest description of the two  Vehicles is that given by the Chinese traveller I-Ching (635-713 A.D.)  who saw them both as living realities in India. He says[2] \"Those who  worship Bodhisattvas and read Mahayana Sutras are called Mahayanists,  while those who do not do this are called Hinayanists.\" In other  words, the Mahayanists have scriptures of their own, not included in  the Hinayanist Canon and adore superhuman beings in the stage of  existence immediately below Buddhahood and practically differing  little from Indian deities. Many characteristics could be added to  I-Ching's description but they might not prove universally true of the  Mahayana nor entirely absent from the Hinayana, for however divergent  the two Vehicles may have become when separated geographically, for  instance in Ceylon and Japan, it is clear that when they were in  contact, as in India and China, the distinction was not always sharp.  But in general the Mahayana was more popular, not in the sense of  being simpler, for parts of its teaching were exceedingly abstruse,  but in the sense of striving to invent or include doctrines agreeable  to the masses. It was less monastic than the older Buddhism, and more  emotional; warmer in charity, more personal in devotion, more ornate  in art, literature and ritual, more disposed to evolution and  development, whereas the Hinayana was conservative and rigid, secluded  in its cloisters and open to the plausible if unjust accusation of  selfishness. The two sections are sometimes described as northern and  southern Buddhism, but except as a rough description of their  distribution at the present day, this distinction is not accurate, for  the Mahayana penetrated to Java, while the Hinayana reached Central  Asia and China. But it is true that the development of the Mahayana  was due to influences prevalent in northern India and not equally  prevalent in the South. The terms Pali and Sanskrit Buddhism are  convenient and as accurate as can be expected of any nomenclature  covering so large a field.    Though European writers usually talk of _two_ Yanas or Vehicles--the  great and the little--and though this is clearly the important  distinction for historical purposes, yet Indian and Chinese Buddhists  frequently enumerate _three_. These are the _Sravakayana_, the  vehicle of the ordinary Bhikshu who hopes to become an Arhat, the  _Pratyekabuddhayana_ for the rare beings who are able to become  Buddhas but do not preach the law to others, and in contrast to both  of these the _Mahayana_ or vehicle of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas. As a  rule these three Vehicles are not regarded as hostile or even  incompatible. Thus the _Lotus sutra_,[3] maintains that there is  really but one vehicle though by a wise concession to human weakness  the Buddha lets it appear that there are three to suit divers tastes.  And the Mahayana is not a single vehicle but rather a train comprising  many carriages of different classes. It has an unfortunate but  distinct later phase known in Sanskrit as Mantrayana and Vajrayana but  generally described by Europeans as Tantrism. This phase took some of  the worst features in Hinduism, such as spells, charms, and the  worship of goddesses, and with misplaced ingenuity fitted them into  Buddhism. I shall treat of it in a subsequent chapter, for it is  chronologically late. The silence of Hsuean Chuang and I-Ching implies  that in the seventh century it was not a noticeable aspect of Indian  Buddhism.    Although the record of the Mahayana in literature and art is clear and  even brilliant, it is not easy either to trace its rise or connect its  development with other events in India. Its annals are an interminable  list of names and doctrines, but bring before us few living  personalities and hence are dull. They are like a record of the  Christian Church's fight against Arians, Monophysites and Nestorians  with all the great figures of Byzantine history omitted or called in  question. Hence I fear that my readers (if I have any) may find these  chapters repellent, a mist of hypotheses and a catalogue of ancient  paradoxes. I can only urge that if the history"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16572"],[0,"Indians of the Yosemite Valley and Vicinity (#1)"],[1,"[Illustration: _Photograph by Taber_.]    [Signature: Galen Clark]            INDIANS  OF  THE YOSEMITE VALLEY  AND VICINITY    Their History, Customs and Traditions    BY  GALEN CLARK      Author of \"Big Trees of California,\" Discoverer of the Mariposa  Grove of Big Trees, and for many years Guardian  of the Yosemite Valley.

The Indians of the Yosemite are fast passing away. Only a handful  now remain of the powerful tribes that once gathered in the  Valley and considered it an absolute stronghold against their  white enemies. Even in their diminished numbers and their  comparatively civilized condition, they are still a source of  great interest to all visitors, and it has been suggested many  times that their history, customs and legends should be put in  permanent and convenient form, before they are entirely lost.    Many tales and histories of the California Indians have been  written by soldiers and pioneers, but Mr. Clark has told the  story of these people from their own standpoint, and with a  sympathetic understanding of their character. This fresh point of  view gives double interest to his narrative.    Galen Clark comes of a notable family; his English ancestors came  to the State of Massachusetts in the seventeenth century, but he  is a native of the Town of Dublin, Cheshire County, New  Hampshire, born on the 28th day of March, 1814, and is  consequently nearly ninety years of age, but still alert and  active in mind and body.    He attended school in his early youth during the winter months,  and worked on a farm during the summer, leading nearly the same  life which was followed by so many others who afterwards became  famous in our country's history.    Later in life he learned chair-making and painting, an occupation  which he followed for some years, when he removed to Philadelphia  and subsequently to New York City.    Whilst residing in New York, in 1853, he resolved, after mature  reflection, to visit the new Eldorado. His attention was first  attracted to this State by visiting the celebrated Crystal  Palace in New York, where was then on exhibition quantities of  gold dust which had been sent or brought East by successful  miners.    Mr. Clark left New York for California in October, 1853, coming  via the Isthmus of Panama, and in due time reached his  destination. In 1854 he went to Mariposa County, attracted  thither by the wonderful accounts of the gold discoveries, and  the marvelous stories he had heard of the grandeur and beauty of  the Yosemite Valley and the surrounding mountains.    Upon his first arrival in Mariposa, he engaged in mining, and was  also employed to assist in surveying Government land on the west  side of the San Joaquin Valley, and canals for mining purposes,  some of which passed through the celebrated \"Mariposa Grant,\" the  subject of prolonged and bitter litigation, both in this country  and in Europe. He probably knows more about the actual facts  concerning the Mariposa Grant than any one now living, and it is  to be hoped that some day he may overcome his natural repugnance  to notoriety, and give to the public the benefit of his  knowledge.    In the year 1855 Mr. Clark made his first trip into the Yosemite  Valley with a party made up in Mariposa and Bear Valley.    Returning to Mariposa, he resumed his old occupation of surveying  and mining, and, whilst so engaged, by reason of exposure, had a  serious attack of lung trouble, resulting in severe hemorrhages  which threatened to end his life.    He then removed, in April, 1857, to the South Fork of the Merced  River, and built a log cabin in one of the most beautiful of our  mountain valleys, on the spot where Wawona now stands. He soon  recovered his health entirely, and, though constantly exposed to  the winter storms and snows, has never had a recurrence of his  malady.    Wawona is twenty-six miles from Yosemite, and at that time became  known as Clark's Station, being on the trail leading from  Mariposa to the Valley, and a noted stopping place for travelers.  This trail, as well as one from Coulterville, was completed to  the Valley in 1857, and the trip to Yosemite then involved a  stage ride of ninety-two miles, and a journey of sixty miles more  on horseback. In 1874 and 1875 the three present stage roads were  constructed through to the Valley.    All travelers by the Raymond route will remember Wawona and the  surroundings; the peaceful valley, the swift-flowing Merced, and  the surrounding peaks and mountains, almost equaling in grandeur  the famous Yosemite itself.    In the early days this locality was annually visited by several  bands of Indians from the Chowchilla and Fresno rivers. The  Indian name for the place was Pal-lah'-chun. Whilst residing  there Mr. Clark was in constant contact with these visiting  tribes; he obtained their confidence, and retains it to this day.    Whilst on a hunting trip, in the summer of 1857, Mr. Clark  discovered and made known to the public the famous Big Tree  Grove, now known all over the world as the \"Mariposa Grove of Big  Trees,\" belonging to the State of California. On this expedition  he did not follow the route now traveled, but came upon the grove  at the upper end, near the place where the road to Wawona Point  now branches off from the main drive. The spot where he caught  his first view of the Big Trees has been appropriately marked,  and can be seen from the stage road.    So impressed was Mr. Clark with the importance of his discovery,  that he opened up a good horse trail from Wawona to the Trees,  and shortly afterwards built a log cabin in the grove, for the  comfort and convenience of visitors in bad or stormy weather.  This cabin became known as \"Galen's Hospice.\"    In the year 1864 the Congress of the United States passed an Act,  which was approved in June of the same year, granting to the  State of California the \"Yosemite Valley\" and the \"Mariposa Grove  of Big Trees.\" This grant was made upon certain conditions, which  were complied with by the State, and a Commission was appointed  by Governor Low to manage and govern the Valley and the Big Tree  Grove. Galen Clark was, of course, selected as one of the  commissioners. He was subsequently appointed Guardian of the  Valley, and under his administration many needed improvements  were made and others suggested. Bridges were built, roads  constructed on the floor of the Valley, and trails laid out and  finished to various points of interest overlooking the Valley  itself. In a word, the Guardian did everything possible with the  limited means at his disposal.    After serving twenty-four years, Mr. Clark voluntarily retired  from the position of Guardian, carrying with him the respect and  admiration of every member of the Commission, of all the  residents of the Valley, and of every"]]]
