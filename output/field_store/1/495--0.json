In the following pages I have endeavoured to give a vivid picture of  the wonderful events of the ten years, which at their commencement saw  Madras in the hands of the French--Calcutta at the mercy of the Nabob  of Bengal--and English influence apparently at the point of extinction  in India--and which ended in the final triumph of the English, both in  Bengal and Madras. There were yet great battles to be fought, great  efforts to be made, before the vast Empire of India fell altogether  into British hands; but these were but the sequel of the events I have  described.    The historical details are, throughout the story, strictly accurate,  and for them I am indebted to the history of these events written by  Mr. Orme, who lived at that time, to the \"Life of Lord Clive,\"  recently published by Lieutenant Colonel Malleson, and to other  standard authorities. In this book I have devoted a somewhat smaller  space to the personal adventures of my hero than in my other  historical tales, but the events themselves were of such a thrilling  and exciting nature that no fiction could surpass them.    A word as to the orthography of the names and places. An entirely new  method of spelling Indian words has lately been invented by the Indian  authorities. This is no doubt more correct than the rough-and-ready  orthography of the early traders, and I have therefore adopted it for  all little-known places. But there are Indian names which have become  household words in England, and should never be changed; and as it  would be considered a gross piece of pedantry and affectation on the  part of a tourist on the Continent, who should, on his return, say he  had been to Genova, Firenze, and Wien, instead of Genoa, Florence, and  Vienna; it is, I consider, an even worse offence to transform Arcot,  Cawnpoor, and Lucknow, into Arkat, Kahnpur, and Laknao. I have tried,  therefore, so far as possible, to give the names of well-known  personages and places in the spelling familiar to Englishmen, while  the new orthography has been elsewhere adopted.    G. A. Henty.        Chapter 1: Leaving Home.      A lady in deep mourning was sitting, crying bitterly, by a fire in  small lodgings in the town of Yarmouth. Beside her stood a tall lad of  sixteen. He was slight in build, but his schoolfellows knew that  Charlie Marryat's muscles were as firm and hard as those of any boy in  the school. In all sports requiring activity and endurance, rather  than weight and strength, he was always conspicuous. Not one in the  school could compete with him in long-distance running, and when he  was one of the hares there was but little chance for the hounds. He  was a capital swimmer, and one of the best boxers in the school. He  had a reputation for being a leader in every mischievous prank; but he  was honorable and manly, would scorn to shelter himself under the  semblance of a lie, and was a prime favourite with his masters, as  well as his schoolfellows. His mother bewailed the frequency with  which he returned home with blackened eyes and bruised face; for  between Dr. Willet's school and the fisher lads of Yarmouth there was  a standing feud, whose origin dated so far back that none of those now  at school could trace it. Consequently, fierce fights often took place  in the narrow rows, and sometimes the fisher boys would be driven back  on to the broad quay shaded by trees, by the river, and there being  reinforced from the craft along the side, would reassume the offensive  and drive their opponents back into the main street.    It was but six months since Charlie had lost his father, who was the  officer in command at the coast guard station, and his scanty pension  was now all that remained for the support of his widow and children.  His mother had talked his future prospects over, many times, with  Charlie. The latter was willing to do anything, but could suggest  nothing. His father had but little naval interest, and had for years  been employed on coast guard service. Charlie agreed that, although he  should have liked of all things to go to sea, it was useless to think  of it now, for he was past the age at which he could have entered as a  midshipman.    The matter had been talked over four years before, with his father;  but the latter had pointed out that a life in the navy, without  interest, is in most cases a very hard one. If a chance of  distinguishing himself happened, promotion would follow; but if not,  he might be for years on shore, starving on half pay and waiting in  vain for an appointment, while officers with more luck and better  interest went over his head.    Other professions had been discussed, but nothing determined upon,  when Lieutenant Marryat suddenly died. Charlie, although an only son,  was not an only child, as he had two sisters both younger than  himself. After a few months of effort, Mrs. Marryat found that the  utmost she could hope to do, with her scanty income, was to maintain  herself and daughters, and to educate them until they should reach an  age when they could earn their own living as governesses; but that  Charlie's keep and education were beyond her resources. She had,  therefore, very reluctantly written to an uncle, whom she had not seen  for many years, her family having objected very strongly to her  marriage with a penniless lieutenant in the navy. She informed him of  the loss of her husband, and that, although her income was sufficient  to maintain herself and her daughters, she was most anxious to start  her son, who was now sixteen, in life; and therefore begged him to use  his influence to obtain for him a situation of some sort. The letter  which she now held in her hand was the answer to the appeal.    \"My dear Niece,\" it began, \"Since you, by your own foolish conduct and  opposition to all our wishes, separated yourself from your family, and  went your own way in life, I have heard little of you, as the death of  your parents so shortly afterwards deprived me of all sources of  information. I regret to hear of the loss which you have suffered. I  have already taken the necessary steps to carry out your wishes. I  yesterday dined with a friend, who is one of the directors of the  Honorable East India Company, and at my request he has kindly placed a  writership in the Company at your son's service. He will have to come  up to London to see the board, next week, and will probably have to  embark for India a fortnight later. I shall be glad if he will take up  his abode with me, during the intervening time. I shall be glad also  if you will favour me with a statement of your income and expenses,  with such details as you may think necessary. I inclose four  five-pound bank notes, in order that your son may obtain such garments  as may be immediately needful for his appearance before the board of  directors, and for his journey to London. I remain, my dear niece,  yours sincerely,    \"Joshua Tufton.\"    \"It is cruel,\" Mrs. Marryat sobbed, \"cruel to take you away from us,  and send you to India, where you will most likely die of fever, or be  killed by a tiger, or stabbed by one of those horrid natives, in a  fortnight.\"    \"Not so bad as that, Mother, I hope,\" Charlie said sympathizingly,  although he could not repress a smile; \"other people have managed to  live out there, and have come back safe.\"    \"Yes,\" Mrs. Marryat said, sobbing; \"I know how you will come back. A  little, yellow, shrivelled up old man with no liver, and a dreadful  temper, and a black servant. I know what it will be.\"    This time Charlie could not help laughing.    \"That's looking too far ahead altogether, Mother. You take the two  extremes. If I don't die in a fortnight, I am to live to be a  shrivelled old man. I'd rather take a happy medium, and look forward  to coming back before my liver is all gone, or my temper all  destroyed, with lots of money to make you and the girls comfortable.    \"There is only one thing. I wish it had been a cadetship, instead of a  writership.\"    \"That is my only comfort,\" Mrs. Marryat said. \"If it had been a  cadetship, I should have written to say that I would not let you go.  It is bad enough as it is; but if you had had to fight, I could not  have borne it.\"    Charlie did his best to console his mother, by telling her how  everyone who went to India made fortunes, and how he should be sure to  come back with plenty of money; and that, when the girls grew up, he  should be able to find rich husbands for them; and at last he  succeeded in getting her to look at matters in a less gloomy light.    \"And I'm sure, Mother,\" he said, \"Uncle means most kindly. He sends  twenty pounds, you see, and says that that is for immediate  necessities; so I have no doubt he means to help to get my outfit, or  at any rate to advance money, which I can repay him out of my salary.
