BURT COMPANY    _PUBLISHERS_    New York Chicago    1882,  BY  DODD, MEAD & COMPANY    1910,  BY  CHARLES B. FINLEY          GRANDMOTHER ELSIE          CHAPTER I.        \"Every state,       Allotted to the race of man below,       Is in proportion, doom'd to taste some sorrow.\"                                      --_Rowe_.      The Ion family were at home again after their summer on the New Jersey  coast.    It was a delightful morning early in October: the dew-drops on the still  green grass of the neatly kept lawn sparkled in the rays of the newly  risen sun; the bright waters of the lakelet also, as, ruffled by the  breeze, they broke gently about the prow of the pretty row-boat moored to  the little wharf; the gardens were gay with bright-hued flowers, the trees  gorgeous in their autumnal dress.    But though doors and windows were open, the gardener and his assistants at  work in the grounds, there seemed a strange quiet about the place: when  the men spoke to each other it was in subdued tones; there was no  sound--as in other days--of little feet running hither and thither, nor  of childish prattle or laughter.    Two horses stood ready saddled and bridled before the principal entrance  to the mansion, and Mr. Horace Dinsmore was pacing the veranda to and fro  with slow, meditative step, while Bruno, crouching beside the door,  followed his movements with wistful, questioning eyes, doubtless wondering  what had become of his accustomed merry, romping play-mates.    A light step came down the hall, and a lady in riding hat and habit  stepped from the open doorway, stooped for an instant to touch the dog's  head caressingly with a \"Poor Bruno! do you miss your playfellows?\" then  glided quickly toward Mr. Dinsmore, who received her with open arms and  tenderest caress.    Then holding her off and scrutinizing the sweet, fair face with keen,  searching eye, \"You are looking better and brighter than I dared to hope,  my darling,\" he said. \"Did you get some sleep?\"    \"Yes, papa, thank you, several hours. And you? did you rest well?\"    \"Yes, daughter. How are the children?\"    \"No worse, Arthur says; perhaps a trifle better. He, Elsie and Mammy are  with them now, and 'Mamma' can be spared for a short ride with her  father,\" she said, smiling lovingly into the eyes that were gazing with  the tenderest fatherly affection upon her.    \"That is right; you need the air and exercise sorely; a few more days of  such close confinement and assiduous nursing would, I very much fear, tell  seriously upon your health.\"    He led her to the side of her steed and assisted her into the saddle as he  spoke, then vaulted into his own with the agility of youth.    \"But where are Vi and her brothers?\" Elsie asked, sending an inquiring  glance from side to side.    \"I sent them on in advance. I wanted you quite to myself this once,\" he  answered, as they turned and rode at a brisk canter down the avenue.    \"And I shall enjoy having my dear father all to myself for once,\" she  rejoined, with a touch of old-time gayety in look and tone. \"Ah! papa,  never a day passes, I think I might almost say never an hour, in which I  do not thank God for sparing you to me; you who have loved and cherished  me so long and so tenderly.\"    \"My own dear child!\" he said in reply, \"you and your love are among the  greatest blessings of my life.\"    As they rode on side by side they talked of the youngest two of her  children--Rose and Walter--both quite ill with measles; of her sister's  family, where also there was sickness among the little ones, and whither  Mrs. Dinsmore had gone to assist in the nursing of her grandchildren; of  the recent death of Enna at Magnolia Hall, the home of her daughter Molly;  and of the anxiety of the younger Elsie because of a much longer silence  than usual on the part of her absent betrothed.    She greatly feared that some evil had befallen him, and had not been able  to hide her distress from these two--the mother and grandfather who loved  her so--though making most earnest, unselfish efforts to conceal it from  all, especially her mother, whose tender heart was ever ready to bleed for  another's woe, and who had already griefs and anxieties enough of her own.    They spoke of her with tenderest compassion, and affectionate pride in her  loveliness of person and character, and her brave endurance of her trial.    Enna's death could hardly be felt as a personal loss by either, but they  sympathized deeply in the grief of her old father, with whom her faults  seemed to be buried in her grave, while he cherished a lively remembrance  of all that had ever given him pleasure in her looks, words, or ways.    He was growing old and feeble, and felt this, the death of his youngest  child, a very heavy blow.    \"My poor old father! I fear we shall not have him with us much longer,\"  Mr. Dinsmore remarked with emotion.    Elsie's eyes glistened with unshed tears. \"Dear old grandpa!\" she  murmured. \"But, dear papa, be comforted! he may live for years yet, and  should it please God to take him, we know that our loss will be his  infinite gain.\"    \"Yes; would that we had the same assurance in regard to all his children  and grandchildren.\"    Silence fell between them for some minutes.    Elsie knew that her father, when making that last remark, was thinking  more particularly of his half sister, Mrs. Conly, and her daughter  Virginia.    The two had gone to a fashionable watering-place to spend the last  fortnight of their summer's sojourn at the North, and ere it expired  Virginia had contracted a hasty marriage with a man of reputed wealth,  whom she met there for the first time.    The match was made with the full consent and approval of her mother--who,  on rejoining the Dinsmores and Travillas, boasted much of \"Virginia's  brilliant position and prospects\"--but without the knowledge of any other  relative. No opportunity of making inquiries about the character or real  circumstances of the stranger to whom she committed the happiness of her  life, was afforded by Virginia to grandfather, uncle or brothers.    Of late Mrs. Conly had ceased to boast of the match--scarcely mentioned  Virginia's name; and Mr. Dinsmore had learned from Calhoun and Arthur that  Virginia's letters were no longer shown to any one, and seemed to irritate  and depress their mother so unmistakably that they feared more and more  there was something very much amiss with their sister; yet the mother  steadily evaded all inquiries on the subject.    Mr. Dinsmore presently told all this to his daughter, adding that he very  much feared Virginia had made an utter wreck of her earthly happiness.    \"Poor Virgie!\" sighed Elsie. \"Ah! if only she had been blest with such a  father as mine!\" turning upon him a look of grateful love.    \"Or such a mother as my granddaughters have,\" added Mr. Dinsmore, smiling  into the soft, sweet eyes.    \"What blessings my darlings are! how good and lovable in spite of my  failures in right training and example,\" she said in sincere humility.    \"Those failures and mistakes have been very few, I think,\" was his reply;  \"you have tried very earnestly and prayerfully to train them up in the way  they should go. And God is faithful to his promises--your children do not  depart from the right way; they do arise and call you blessed.\"    \"Papa,\" she said, in moved tones, after a moment's silence, \"we must not  forget how much is due to the training, the example, and the prayers of  their father.\"    \"No, daughter; and we can always plead in their behalf the precious  promises to the seed of the righteous. 'I will pour my Spirit upon thy  seed, and my blessing upon thine offspring.' 'A good man leaveth an  inheritance to his children's children.'\"    \"Yes, father, how often have those promises been my comfort and support as  the inheritance of both my children and myself; inherited by me from both  you and my sainted mother and her pious ancestors.\"    \"And from mine; for my mother was a devoted Christian and came of a long  line of God-fearing men and women. But I see nothing yet of Edward and his  party; they must have taken another road.\"    \"Yes, sir; and shall we not turn now? I ought not to be long away from my  poor sick darlings.\"    \"I think it would be well to return by the other road; we shall reach it  in a moment, and our ride will be lengthened by but a half mile or so.\"    She acquiesced in his decision, as was her custom.    On the homeward way, as they neared the cross-road leading to the city,  they saw a boy on horseback coming at a hard gallop down it in their  direction.    On catching sight of them he held aloft what looked like a letter, waving  it about his head in evident desire to attract their attention; then as he  reached their road he halted and waited for them to come up.    \"Mr. Dinsmore, from the Oaks or Ion, isn't it?\" he queried, lifting his  cap and bowing to the lady and her escort as they reined in their steeds  close at hand.    \"Yes.\"    \"A telegram for you, sir.\"    Mr. Dinsmore took the missive, tore it open and glanced at the contents,  then, handing it to Elsie, paid the boy and dismissed him.    \"Oh, my poor darling!\" she exclaimed, her tears dropping upon the paper.  \"Father, what shall we do? tell her at once? Perhaps that would be best.\"    \"Yes; I think it is her right. But of course it must be done as gently as  possible. Dear daughter, do not grieve too sorely for her; try to trust  her as well as yourself in your heavenly Father's hands.\"    \"I will, papa, I will! but oh my heart bleeds for her!\"    \"Will you break the news to her? or shall I?\"    \"My kindest of fathers! you would"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14893"],[0,"Prince Jan, St. Bernard (#1)"],[1,"JAN  ST.

His brown eyes looked with loving  good-will at everything and everybody.    Jan and his brother, Rollo, had great fun playing together, his long fur  making it easy for Rollo to haul him around, while Jan's teeth slipped  from his brother's short hair. Though they tumbled about and growled  fiercely at each other, their eyes were dancing with laughter.    When tired of playing, they would coax their mother to tell them stories  about the Hospice dogs. Then they would lie very quietly listening with  pricked-up ears and earnest eyes. Sometimes Bruno, the oldest dog in  the kennels, would join in the talk, and all the young dogs would gather  around to hear the history of their family. Prince Jan and Rollo,  cuddled beside their mother, would look at each other with pride,  remembering that they, too, were St. Bernards.    \"I have heard the monks tell visitors that our ancestors have lived in  the Hospice for a thousand years,\" said Bruno in one of his talks. \"When  you puppies are old enough, you will be trained for work. The duty of a  St. Bernard dog is to save lives and be worthy of his ancestors.\"    Jan and Rollo looked at him and thumped their tails to show that they  understood.    \"A good St. Bernard dog must have a sensitive nose, sturdy legs, and  keen brains,\" Bruno's voice was very sober. \"He knows what he must do  when he finds a human being lost in the storm or frozen in the snow.  Then he leads the way to the Hospice, or if the traveller does not  follow, the dog brings monks to aid the man. Should one of us ever fail  to do his best,\" he turned his big head slowly and his eyes were serious  as he looked at the puppies, \"it would mean disgrace for all the rest of  the St. Bernard dogs.\"    \"Tell us more stories, Bruno,\" the youngsters begged.    \"Not to-day,\" Bruno shook his wise head. \"Your ancestors have done great  things, and you have the right to be proud of them, but the only way to  prove yourselves worthy is for you to do your duty as well as they did  theirs. Unless you remember your lessons and follow them, you will not  be true St. Bernards, and your failures will be stains on the honor of  the name we bear. Never forget that as long as you live!\"    Bruno understood that the soft little whimpers were promises that each  puppy would do his best when the test came to him. Jan and Rollo watched  the old dog, limping from rheumatism in his shoulders, move slowly  across the enclosed yard that opened from the kennels. Bruno was no  longer able to go out on the trails, but spent his days teaching the  young dogs. Sometimes he would lie asleep, and when his paws jerked and  his tail moved, Jan's mother would say, \"Be quiet, children! Bruno is  dreaming he is out on the trail.\"    Then she would speak softly, \"When you are older you will be taught to  break trails through the snow and carry food and wine, fastened about  your necks. You may be tempted, when the wind howls and the snow blinds  you, to sneak back or hide in a sheltered place. You must not forget, as  long as you live, that there was never a traitor or coward in your  father's family or in mine. When you remember this, you will stagger on  or crawl, if you cannot stand, and keep your nose close to the ground,  sniffing and sniffing.\"    She turned her head toward the white peaks that loomed high above the  stone walls around the enclosure. \"Only a St. Bernard can tell whether  the snow which has drifted during the night is strong enough to bear the  weight of a man, or whether that man would sink beyond rescuing.\"    Jan and his brother waited respectfully when she stopped speaking and  stared at the mountain-tops, until she said, \"Sometimes, you will find  an ice-bridge. Then you must go very carefully. If it creaks beneath  your weight, never let any human being step on it, even if you must  fight him back. Your father, Rex, died when an ice-bridge broke through;  but he saved four men from death. Always remember one thing. To die  doing one's duty is the greatest honor that can come to a St. Bernard.\"    The two puppies whined softly and their mother knew that each of her  children was promising that he would do his best to be worthy of such a  father.    \"Ah,\" said Prince Jan to his brother, as their mother crossed the yard  toward the kennel, \"some day we, too, will go out and do our work. Won't  that be glorious, Rollo?\"    In their happiness they raced to their mother, who watched them with  loving, proud eyes. When they reached her side Jan measured himself to  see how much bigger he must grow, for though he was large for his age,  he was only six months old.    \"Oh, if I could only grow faster, mother!\" he cried.    \"Be patient, Jan,\" she answered, biting his ear gently. \"Your time is  coming soon!\"    \"My time is coming! My time is coming!\" Jan leaped and barked in glee.    \"Mine, too!\" called Rollo. \"We'll work together, Jan!\"    The big door leading from the enclosure where the dogs romped and played  swung open, and two men who came out, stood looking at the dogs. The  puppies watched eagerly, for these men had charge of the youngsters. All  the dogs knew them, and even if the men had been strangers the Hospice  dogs would have known they were monks who belonged to the Hospice, for  the clothes they wore were different from the clothes of other men who  came to the Hospice for a day or two.    A long, black, close-fitting coat reached almost to the feet of each  monk, a peaked hood hung between his shoulders and a little round,  black, skull-cap was on his head. All of the monks dressed the same way,  and when it was cold and they went out on the trail, they took off the  little cap and pulled the peaked hood over their heads and around their  ears.    The dogs hurried to the monks and one of the men leaned down and felt  Jan's legs and back. Prince Jan looked anxiously into the two kindly  faces. He had seen them do the same thing with other puppies, and  afterwards many of his playmates went away and never returned. At first  he and Rollo thought they had died on the trail, like their ancestors;  but Jan's mother shook her head sadly and said, \"They were not strong  enough to do the work.\"    Now he remembered this and wondered if he would be sent away. His little  legs and back stiffened so that the monks would see how strong he was.    \"I believe this will be one of the best dogs we have had since Barry's  time,\" said Brother Antoine, running his hand along Jan's back. \"He has  wonderful muscles and a very strong back. We will take him out and give  him a trial to-morrow.\"    Jan licked the hand that rested on his head, then he dashed to his  mother's side, yelping with excitement and panting out the good news.    She looked with pride into his happy eyes and said, \"You are going to be  just like your father! He was a descendant of Barry, the bravest dog of  us all. You will be a credit to your ancestors!\"    \"I will do the very best I can,\" promised little Prince Jan. Then he lay  down and wrinkled his soft forehead as he tried to remember everything  that Bruno and his mother had taught him, so that he would be ready for  his first lesson.    The next morning he was wide awake before any of the other dogs. They  all slept in a big basement under the Hospice building. Jan could see  the arched corridors that reached along the big room with its floor of  grey stone. The cows of the Hospice were kept in the basement, too, for  there was never any green grass outside for them to graze upon. Here and  there curled dogs that Prince Jan knew.
