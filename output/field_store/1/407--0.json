Some dialogues of Plato are of so various a character that their  relation to the other dialogues cannot be determined with any degree of  certainty. The Theaetetus, like the Parmenides, has points of similarity  both with his earlier and his later writings. The perfection of style,  the humour, the dramatic interest, the complexity of structure, the  fertility of illustration, the shifting of the points of view, are  characteristic of his best period of authorship. The vain search, the  negative conclusion, the figure of the midwives, the constant profession  of ignorance on the part of Socrates, also bear the stamp of the early  dialogues, in which the original Socrates is not yet Platonized. Had we  no other indications, we should be disposed to range the Theaetetus with  the Apology and the Phaedrus, and perhaps even with the Protagoras and  the Laches.    But when we pass from the style to an examination of the subject,  we trace a connection with the later rather than with the earlier  dialogues. In the first place there is the connexion, indicated by Plato  himself at the end of the dialogue, with the Sophist, to which in  many respects the Theaetetus is so little akin. (1) The same persons  reappear, including the younger Socrates, whose name is just mentioned  in the Theaetetus; (2) the theory of rest, which Socrates has declined  to consider, is resumed by the Eleatic Stranger; (3) there is a similar  allusion in both dialogues to the meeting of Parmenides and Socrates  (Theaet., Soph.); and (4) the inquiry into not-being in the Sophist  supplements the question of false opinion which is raised in the  Theaetetus. (Compare also Theaet. and Soph. for parallel turns of  thought.) Secondly, the later date of the dialogue is confirmed by the  absence of the doctrine of recollection and of any doctrine of ideas  except that which derives them from generalization and from reflection  of the mind upon itself. The general character of the Theaetetus is  dialectical, and there are traces of the same Megarian influences which  appear in the Parmenides, and which later writers, in their matter of  fact way, have explained by the residence of Plato at Megara. Socrates  disclaims the character of a professional eristic, and also, with a sort  of ironical admiration, expresses his inability to attain the Megarian  precision in the use of terms. Yet he too employs a similar sophistical  skill in overturning every conceivable theory of knowledge.    The direct indications of a date amount to no more than this: the  conversation is said to have taken place when Theaetetus was a youth,  and shortly before the death of Socrates. At the time of his own death  he is supposed to be a full-grown man. Allowing nine or ten years for  the interval between youth and manhood, the dialogue could not have been  written earlier than 390, when Plato was about thirty-nine years of age.  No more definite date is indicated by the engagement in which Theaetetus  is said to have fallen or to have been wounded, and which may have taken  place any time during the Corinthian war, between the years 390-387.  The later date which has been suggested, 369, when the Athenians and  Lacedaemonians disputed the Isthmus with Epaminondas, would make the  age of Theaetetus at his death forty-five or forty-six. This a little  impairs the beauty of Socrates' remark, that 'he would be a great man if  he lived.'    In this uncertainty about the place of the Theaetetus, it seemed better,  as in the case of the Republic, Timaeus, Critias, to retain the order in  which Plato himself has arranged this and the two companion dialogues.  We cannot exclude the possibility which has been already noticed in  reference to other works of Plato, that the Theaetetus may not have  been all written continuously; or the probability that the Sophist and  Politicus, which differ greatly in style, were only appended after a  long interval of time. The allusion to Parmenides compared with the  Sophist, would probably imply that the dialogue which is called by his  name was already in existence; unless, indeed, we suppose the passage in  which the allusion occurs to have been inserted afterwards. Again,  the Theaetetus may be connected with the Gorgias, either dialogue from  different points of view containing an analysis of the real and apparent  (Schleiermacher); and both may be brought into relation with the Apology  as illustrating the personal life of Socrates. The Philebus, too, may  with equal reason be placed either after or before what, in the language  of Thrasyllus, may be called the Second Platonic Trilogy. Both the  Parmenides and the Sophist, and still more the Theaetetus, have points  of affinity with the Cratylus, in which the principles of rest and  motion are again contrasted, and the Sophistical or Protagorean theory  of language is opposed to that which is attributed to the disciple  of Heracleitus, not to speak of lesser resemblances in thought and  language. The Parmenides, again, has been thought by some to hold an  intermediate position between the Theaetetus and the Sophist; upon this  view, the Sophist may be regarded as the answer to the problems about  One and Being which have been raised in the Parmenides. Any of these  arrangements may suggest new views to the student of Plato; none of them  can lay claim to an exclusive probability in its favour.    The Theaetetus is one of the narrated dialogues of Plato, and is  the only one which is supposed to have been written down. In a short  introductory scene, Euclides and Terpsion are described as meeting  before the door of Euclides' house in Megara. This may have been a  spot familiar to Plato (for Megara was within a walk of Athens), but no  importance can be attached to the accidental introduction of the founder  of the Megarian philosophy. The real intention of the preface is to  create an interest about the person of Theaetetus, who has just been  carried up from the army at Corinth in a dying state. The expectation  of his death recalls the promise of his youth, and especially the famous  conversation which Socrates had with him when he was quite young, a few  days before his own trial and death, as we are once more reminded at the  end of the dialogue. Yet we may observe that Plato has himself forgotten  this, when he represents Euclides as from time to time coming to Athens  and correcting the copy from Socrates' own mouth. The narrative, having  introduced Theaetetus, and having guaranteed the authenticity of the  dialogue (compare Symposium, Phaedo, Parmenides), is then dropped. No  further use is made of the device. As Plato himself remarks, who in this  as in some other minute points is imitated by Cicero (De Amicitia), the  interlocutory words are omitted.    Theaetetus, the hero of the battle of Corinth and of the dialogue, is  a disciple of Theodorus, the great geometrician, whose science is thus  indicated to be the propaedeutic to philosophy. An interest has been  already excited about him by his approaching death, and now he is  introduced to us anew by the praises of his master Theodorus. He is a  youthful Socrates, and exhibits the same contrast of the fair soul and  the ungainly face and frame, the Silenus mask and the god within, which  are described in the Symposium. The picture which Theodorus gives of  his courage and patience and intelligence and modesty is verified in  the course of the dialogue. His courage is shown by his behaviour in the  battle, and his other qualities shine forth as the argument proceeds.  Socrates takes an evident delight in 'the wise Theaetetus,' who has more  in him than 'many bearded men'; he is quite inspired by his answers. At  first the youth is lost in wonder, and is almost too modest to speak,  but, encouraged by Socrates, he rises to the occasion, and grows full of  interest and enthusiasm about the great question. Like a youth, he has  not finally made up his mind, and is very ready to follow the lead of  Socrates, and to enter into each successive phase of the discussion  which turns up. His great dialectical talent is shown in his power of  drawing distinctions, and of foreseeing the consequences of his own  answers. The enquiry about the nature of knowledge is not new to him;  long ago he has felt the 'pang of philosophy,' and has experienced the  youthful intoxication which is depicted in the Philebus. But he  has hitherto been unable to make the transition from mathematics to  metaphysics. He can form a general conception of square and oblong  numbers, but he is unable to attain a similar expression of knowledge  in the abstract. Yet at length he begins to recognize that there are  universal conceptions of being, likeness, sameness, number, which the  mind contemplates in herself, and with the help of Socrates is conducted  from a theory of sense to a theory of ideas.    There is no reason to doubt that Theaetetus was a real person, whose  name survived in the next generation. But neither can any importance be  attached to the notices of him in Suidas and Proclus, which are probably  based on the mention of him in Plato. According to a confused statement  in Suidas, who mentions him twice over, first, as a pupil of Socrates,  and then of Plato, he is said to have written the first work on the Five  Solids. But no early authority cites the work, the invention of which  may have been easily suggested by the division of roots, which Plato  attributes to him, and the allusion to the backward state of solid  geometry in the Republic. At any rate, there is no occasion to recall  him to life again after the battle of Corinth, in order that we may  allow time for the completion of such a work (Muller). We may also  remark that such a supposition entirely destroys the pathetic interest  of the introduction.

PILLING.      Mr. Henry R. Schoolcraft, while engaged in the preparation of his  work--\"Information respecting the History, Condition, and Prospects of  the Indian Tribes of the United States\"--sent to various persons  residing among the Indians a \"Comparative Vocabulary of the Languages of  the Indian Tribes of the United States,\" a quarto paper of 25 pages,  comprising 350 words, and the numerals one to one billion. The returns  from this were for the most part incorporated in his work; a few,  however, found their way into the collection of the Smithsonian  Institution.    In 1853-'54, Mr. George Gibbs, while engaged under Gov. Isaac I. Stevens  in \"Explorations for a route for the Pacific Railroad near the 47th and  49th parallels of north latitude,\" became interested in the study of the  languages of the Indians inhabiting the Northwest, and collected many  vocabularies. To further extend this work, he prepared and had printed a  folio paper of three leaves entitled \"A vocabulary of 180 words which it  is desired to collect in the different languages and dialects throughout  the Pacific Coast for publication by the Smithsonian Institute at  Washington.\"    These were sent to such persons as, in his judgment, were competent to  furnish the material desired, and many of them, filled or partly filled,  were returned to him. A second edition of this vocabulary, 6 ll., folio,  was issued.    In 1863 there was published by the Smithsonian Institution a pamphlet  with the following title:    Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collections. | --160-- | Instructions | for       research relative to the | Ethnology and Philology | of | America. |       Prepared for the Smithsonian Institution. | By | George Gibbs. |       Washington: | Smithsonian Institution: | March, 1863.    2 p. ll., pp. 1-51. 8^o.    In his introductory remarks, Professor Henry thus states the object of  the paper:    \"The Smithsonian Institution is desirous of extending and completing its  collections of facts and materials relative to the Ethnology,  Archaeology, and Philology of the races of mankind inhabiting, either now  or at any previous period, the continent of America, and earnestly  solicits the cooeperation in this object of all officers of the United  States Government, and travellers or residents who may have it in their  power to render any assistance.\"    Under the head of Philology, Mr. Gibbs gave a brief account of some of  the peculiarities of Indian languages, with general directions for the  best method of collecting certain words; a simple and practical  alphabet; and a vocabulary in English, Spanish, French, and Latin of 211  words. Speaking of the latter, he says:    \"In view of the importance of a uniform system in collecting words of  the various Indian languages of North America, adapted to the use of  officers of the government, travellers, and others, the following is  recommended as a STANDARD VOCABULARY. It is mainly the one prepared by  the late Hon. Albert Gallatin, with a few changes made by Mr. Hale, the  Ethnologist of the United States Exploring Expedition, and is adopted as  that upon which nearly all the collections hitherto made for the purpose  of comparison have been based. For the purpose of ascertaining the more  obvious relations between the various members of existing families this  number is deemed sufficient. The remote affinities must be sought in a  wider research, demanding a degree of acquaintance with their languages  beyond the reach of transient visitors.\"    The vocabulary given in this paper was separately printed on writing  paper, 10 ll., 4^o, and reprinted, 6 ll., folio, and was distributed  widely among the missionaries, Indian agents, travelers, and local  collectors in ethnology, and has served a valuable purpose, resulting in  the collection by the Smithsonian Institution of a large number of  vocabularies, comprising many of the languages and dialects of the  Indian tribes of the United States, British America, and Mexico.    This material, as it was received, was placed in the hands of Mr. Gibbs  for revision and classification--a work in which he was engaged at the  time of his death, which occurred before any of it was published.    In 1876, Professor Henry turned this material over to Maj. J.W. Powell,  then in charge of the United States Geographical and Geological Survey  of the Rocky Mountain Region, to be consolidated and published in  connection with like material collected by himself and his assistants  while among the Indians of the western portion of the United States. A  number were accordingly published in the \"Contributions to North  American Ethnology,\" Vols. I and III, a quarto series issued by the  Survey.    Wishing to extend the work already begun by the Smithsonian Institution,  Major Powell, in 1877, prepared the following paper:    Introduction | to the | Study of Indian Languages, | with words, phrases,       and sentences to be collected. | By J.W. Powell. | Washington: |       Government Printing Office. | 1877.    Pp. 1-104, 10 ruled ll., 4^o.    In his opening remarks, referring to the manuscripts derived from the  distribution of Mr. Gibbs' paper, the author says: \"It has, in fact,  greatly stimulated investigation, giving wiser direction to inquiry,  and the results have abundantly proved the value of the 'Instructions'  and the wisdom of its publication; and it serves to mark an epoch in the  history of ethnographic investigation in America. The material which has  thus been accumulated is of great amount, and its study has led to such  important conclusions that it is deemed wise to prepare a new system of  instruction, more comprehensive in plan and more elaborate in detail.  First, it is found necessary to enlarge the alphabet so as to include a  greater number of sounds, which have been discovered in the North  American languages, and to mark other letters with greater precision.  Second, it is necessary to enlarge the vocabulary so as to modify it  somewhat, as experience has dictated, so that new words may be  collected. Third, it is desirable that many simple phrases and sentences  should be given--so chosen as to bring out the more important  characteristics of grammatic structure.\"    In the preparation of this paper, the alphabet was considered to be of  prime importance. Concerning it, the author says: \"After devoting much  time to the consideration of the subject, and the examination of many  alphabets devised by scholars and linguists, none was found against  which there was not serious objections, and the author attempted to  devise an alphabet which would contain all the supposed requirements;  but there were many difficulties in the way, and many compromises to be  made in weighing the various considerations. At this stage of the work  he applied to the eminent philologist, Prof. W.D. Whitney, for  assistance. After much consultation and the weighing of the many  considerations arising from the large amount of manuscript material in  the author's hands, Professor Whitney kindly prepared the following  paper on the alphabet.\"    The words, phrases, and sentences to be collected are arranged in  schedules, each preceded by instructions, and followed by blanks for  additions, as follows:       I. Persons, 15 words.      II. Parts of the body, 103 words.     III. Relationships:        Relationships arising from the first and second generations,          58 words.        Relationships arising from the third generation, 224 words.        Relationships arising from the fourth generation, 24 words.        Names of children in order of birth, 26 words.      IV. Social organization.       V. Governmental organization, 22 words.      VI. Religion, 6 words.     VII. Disposal of the dead, 8 words.    VIII. Dress and ornaments, 39 words.      IX. Dwellings, 26 words.       X. Implements and utensils, 36 words.        Basket-ware, 15 words.        Woodenware, 7 words.        Utensils of shell, horn, bone, &c., 5 words.        Stone implements, 13 words.        Pottery, &c., 11 words.       XI. Food, 6 words.      XII. Games and sports, 5 words.     XIII. Animals:         Mammals, 91 words.           Parts of the"]]]
