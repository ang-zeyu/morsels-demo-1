It may be  taken as a summary of the history of posture; a complete dance cannot  be easily rendered in illustration.    The text is of the most elementary description; to go into the subject  thoroughly would involve years and volumes. The descriptions of the  various historic dances or music are enormous subjects; two authors  alone have given 800 dances in four volumes.[Footnote: Thompson's  complete collection of 200 country dances performed at Court, Bath,  Tunbridge, and all public assemblies, with proper figures and  directions to each set for the violin, German flute, and hautboy, 8s.  6d.

Four volumes,  each 200 dances. 1770-1773.]    It would have been interesting if some idea of the orchesography of  the Egyptians and Greeks could have been given; this art of describing  dances much in the manner that music is written is lost, and the  attempts to revive it have been ineffective. The increasing speed of  the action since the days of Lulli would now render it almost  impossible.    It is hoped that this work may be of some use as illustrating the  costume, position and accessories of the dance in various periods to  those producing entertainments.    To the reader desirous of thoroughly studying the subject a  bibliography is given at the end.          CONTENTS.      CHAPTER I    Egyptian, Assyrian, Hebrew, and Phoenician Dancing.

In this work it is not necessary to worry the reader with speculations  as to the origin of dancing. There are other authorities easily  accessible who have written upon this theme.    Dancing is probably one of the oldest arts. As soon as man was man he  without doubt began to gesticulate with face, body, and limbs. How  long it took to develop bodily gesticulation into an art no one can  guess--perhaps a millennium.    In writing of dancing, one will therefore include those gesticulations  or movements of the body suggesting an idea, whether it be the slow  movement of marching, or the rapid gallop, even some of the movements  that we commonly call acrobatic. It is not intended here to include  the more sensual movements of the East and the debased antique.    Generally the antique dances were connected with a religious ritual  conceived to be acceptable to the Gods. This connection between  dancing and religious rites was common up to the 16th century. It  still continues in some countries.    In some of the earliest designs which have come down to us the dancers  moved, as stars, hand in hand round an altar, or person, representing  the sun; either in a slow or stately method, or with rapid trained  gestures, according to the ritual performed.    Dancing, music and poetry were inseparable. Dancing is the poetry of  motion, and its connection with music, as the poetry of sound, occurs  at all times. In our own day musical themes are marked by forms  originally dance times, as waltz time, gavotte time, minuet time, etc.    [Illustration: Fig. 2.--Greek figures in a solemn dance. From a vase  at Berlin.]    Amongst the earliest representations that are comprehensible, we have  certain Egyptian paintings, and some of these exhibit postures that  evidently had even then a settled meaning, and were a phrase in the  sentences of the art. Not only were they settled at such an early  period (B.C. 3000, fig. 1) but they appear to have been accepted and  handed down to succeeding generations (fig. 2), and what is remarkable  in some countries, even to our own times. The accompanying  illustrations from Egypt and Greece exhibit what was evidently a  traditional attitude. The hand-in-hand dance is another of these.    The earliest accompaniments to dancing appear to have been the  clapping of hands, the pipes,[Footnote: Egyptian music appears to  have been of a complicated character and the double pipe or flutes  were probably reeded, as with our clarionet. The left pipe had few  stops and served as a sort of hautboy; the right had many stops and  was higher. The single pipe, (a) \"The recorder\" in the British Museum,  is a treble of 10-1/2 in. and is pentaphonic, like the Scotch scale;  the tenor (b) is 8-3/4 in. long and its present pitch--[Illustration:  a] [Illustration: b] the guitar, the tambourine, the castanets, the  cymbals, the tambour, and sometimes in the street, the drum.    The following account of Egyptian dancing is from Sir Gardiner  Wilkinson's \"Ancient Egypt\" [Footnote: Vol. i., p. 503-8.]:--    \"The dance consisted mostly of a succession of figures, in which the  performers endeavoured to exhibit a great variety of gesture. Men and  women danced at the same time, or in separate parties, but the latter  were generally preferred for their superior grace and elegance. Some  danced to slow airs, adapted to the style of their movement; the  attitudes they assumed frequently partook of a grace not unworthy of  the Greeks; and some credit is due to the skill of the artist who  represented the subject, which excites additional interest from its  being in one of the oldest tombs of Thebes (B.C. 1450, Amenophis II.).  Others preferred a lively step, regulated by an appropriate tune; and  men sometimes danced with great spirit, bounding from the ground,  more in the manner of Europeans than of Eastern people. On these  occasions the music was not always composed of many instruments, and  here we find only the cylindrical maces and a woman snapping her  fingers in the time, in lieu of cymbals or castanets.    \"Graceful attitudes and gesticulations were the general style of their  dance, but, as in all other countries, the taste of the performance  varied according to the rank of the person by whom they were employed,  or their own skill, and the dance at the house of a priest differed  from that among the uncouth peasantry, etc.    \"It was not customary for the upper orders of Egyptians to indulge in  this amusement, either in public or private assemblies, and none  appear to have practised it but the lower ranks of society, and those  who gained their livelihood by attending festive meetings.    \"Fearing lest it should corrupt the manners of a people naturally  lively and fond of gaiety, and deeming it neither a necessary part of  education nor becoming a person of sober habits, the Egyptians forbade  those of the higher classes to learn it as an amusement.    \"Many of these postures resembled those of the modern ballet, and the  pirouette delighted an Egyptian party 3,500 years ago.    \"The dresses of the females were light and of the finest texture, a  loose flowing robe reaching to the ankles, sometimes with a girdle.    \"In later times, it appears more transparent and folded in narrow  pleats.[F"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/173"],[0,"The Insidious Dr. Fu Manchu (#1)"],[1,"etext was updated by Stewart A. Levin of Englewood, CO.            The Insidious Dr. Fu-Manchu      by    Sax Rohmer            CHAPTER I      \"A GENTLEMAN to see you, Doctor.\"    From across the common a clock sounded the half-hour.    \"Ten-thirty!\" I said.  \"A late visitor.  Show him up, if you please.\"    I pushed my writing aside and tilted the lamp-shade, as footsteps  sounded on the landing.  The next moment I had jumped to my feet, for a  tall, lean man, with his square-cut, clean-shaven face sun-baked to the  hue of coffee, entered and extended both hands, with a cry:    \"Good old Petrie!  Didn't expect me, I'll swear!\"    It was Nayland Smith--whom I had thought to be in Burma!    \"Smith,\" I said, and gripped his hands hard, \"this is a delightful  surprise!  Whatever--however--\"    \"Excuse me, Petrie!\" he broke in.  \"Don't put it down to the sun!\" And  he put out the lamp, plunging the room into darkness.    I was too surprised to speak.    \"No doubt you will think me mad,\" he continued, and, dimly, I could see  him at the window, peering out into the road, \"but before you are many  hours older you will know that I have good reason to be cautious.  Ah,  nothing suspicious!  Perhaps I am first this time.\"  And, stepping back  to the writing-table he relighted the lamp.    \"Mysterious enough for you?\" he laughed, and glanced at my unfinished  MS.  \"A story, eh?  From which I gather that the district is beastly  healthy--what, Petrie?  Well, I can put some material in your way that,  if sheer uncanny mystery is a marketable commodity, ought to make you  independent of influenza and broken legs and shattered nerves and all  the rest.\"    I surveyed him doubtfully, but there was nothing in his appearance to  justify me in supposing him to suffer from delusions.  His eyes were  too bright, certainly, and a hardness now had crept over his face.  I  got out the whisky and siphon, saying:    \"You have taken your leave early?\"    \"I am not on leave,\" he replied, and slowly filled his pipe.  \"I am on  duty.\"    \"On duty!\" I exclaimed.  \"What, are you moved to London or something?\"    \"I have got a roving commission, Petrie, and it doesn't rest with me  where I am to-day nor where I shall be to-morrow.\"    There was something ominous in the words, and, putting down my glass,  its contents untasted, I faced round and looked him squarely in the  eyes.  \"Out with it!\" I said.  \"What is it all about?\"    Smith suddenly stood up and stripped off his coat.  Rolling back his  left shirt-sleeve he revealed a wicked-looking wound in the fleshy part  of the forearm.  It was quite healed, but curiously striated for an  inch or so around.    \"Ever seen one like it?\" he asked.    \"Not exactly,\" I confessed.  \"It appears to have been deeply  cauterized.\"    \"Right!  Very deeply!\" he rapped.  \"A barb steeped in the venom of a  hamadryad went in there!\"    A shudder I could not repress ran coldly through me at mention of that  most deadly of all the reptiles of the East.    \"There's only one treatment,\" he continued, rolling his sleeve down  again, \"and that's with a sharp knife, a match, and a broken cartridge.  I lay on my back, raving, for three days afterwards, in a forest that  stank with malaria, but I should have been lying there now if I had  hesitated.  Here's the point.  It was not an accident!\"    \"What do you mean?\"    \"I mean that it was a deliberate attempt on my life, and I am hard upon  the tracks of the man who extracted that venom--patiently, drop by  drop--from the poison-glands of the snake, who prepared that arrow, and  who caused it to be shot at me.\"    \"What fiend is this?\"    \"A fiend who, unless my calculations are at fault is now in London, and  who regularly wars with pleasant weapons of that kind.  Petrie, I have  traveled from Burma not in the interests of the British Government  merely, but in the interests of the entire white race, and I honestly  believe--though I pray I may be wrong--that its survival depends  largely upon the success of my mission.\"    To say that I was perplexed conveys no idea of the mental chaos created  by these extraordinary statements, for into my humdrum suburban life  Nayland Smith had brought fantasy of the wildest.  I did not know what  to think, what to believe.    \"I am wasting precious time!\" he rapped decisively, and, draining his  glass, he stood up.  \"I came straight to you, because you are the only  man I dare to trust.  Except the big chief at headquarters, you are the  only person in England, I hope, who knows that Nayland Smith has  quitted Burma.  I must have someone with me, Petrie, all the time--it's  imperative!  Can you put me up here, and spare a few days to the  strangest business, I promise you, that ever was recorded in fact or  fiction?\"    I agreed readily enough, for, unfortunately, my professional duties  were not onerous.    \"Good man!\" he cried, wringing my hand in his impetuous way.  \"We start  now.\"    \"What, to-night?\"    \"To-night!  I had thought of turning in, I must admit.  I have not  dared to sleep for forty-eight hours, except in fifteen-minute  stretches.  But there is one move that must be made to-night and  immediately.  I must warn Sir Crichton Davey.\"    \"Sir Crichton Davey--of the India--\"    \"Petrie, he is a doomed man!  Unless he follows my instructions without  question, without hesitation--before Heaven, nothing can save him!  I  do not know when the blow will fall, how it will fall, nor from whence,  but I know that my first duty is to warn him.  Let us walk down to the  corner of the common and get a taxi.\"    How strangely does the adventurous intrude upon the humdrum; for, when  it intrudes at all, more often than not its intrusion is sudden and  unlooked for.  To-day, we may seek for romance and fail to find it:  unsought, it lies in wait for us at most prosaic corners of life's  highway.    The drive that night, though it divided the drably commonplace from the  wildly bizarre--though it was the bridge between the ordinary and the  outre--has left no impression upon my mind.  Into the heart of a weird  mystery the cab bore me; and in reviewing my memories of those days I  wonder that the busy thoroughfares through which we passed did not  display before my eyes signs and portents--warnings.    It was not so.  I recall nothing of the route and little of import that  passed between us (we both were strangely silent, I think) until we  were come to our journey's end.  Then:    \"What's this?\" muttered my friend hoarsely.    Constables were moving on a little crowd of curious idlers who pressed  about the steps of Sir Crichton Davey's house and sought to peer in at  the open door.  Without waiting for the cab to draw up to the curb,  Nayland Smith recklessly leaped out and I followed close at his heels.    \"What has happened?\" he demanded breathlessly of a constable.    The latter glanced at him doubtfully, but something in his voice and  bearing commanded respect.    \"Sir Crichton Davey has been killed, sir.\"    Smith lurched back as though he had received a physical blow, and  clutched my shoulder convulsively.  Beneath the heavy tan his face had  blanched, and his eyes were set in a stare of horror.    \"My God!\" he whispered.  \"I am too late!\"    With clenched fists he turned and, pressing through the group of  loungers, bounded up the steps.  In the hall a man who unmistakably was  a Scotland Yard official stood talking to a footman.  Other members of  the household were moving about, more or less aimlessly, and the chilly  hand of King Fear had touched one and all, for, as they came and went,  they glanced ever over their shoulders, as if each shadow cloaked a  menace, and listened, as it seemed, for some sound which they dreaded  to hear.  Smith strode up to the detective and showed him a card, upon  glancing at which the Scotland Yard man said something in a low voice,  and, nodding, touched his hat to Smith in a respectful manner.    A few brief questions and answers, and, in gloomy silence, we followed  the detective up the heavily carpeted stair, along a corridor lined  with pictures and busts, and into a large library.  A group of people  were in this room, and one, in whom I recognized Chalmers Cleeve, of  Harley Street, was bending over a motionless form stretched upon a  couch.  Another door communicated with a small study, and through the  opening I could see a man on all fours examining the carpet.  The  uncomfortable sense of hush, the group about the physician, the bizarre  figure crawling, beetle-like, across the inner room, and the grim hub,  around which all this ominous activity turned, made up a scene that  etched itself indelibly on my mind.    As we entered Dr. Cleeve straightened himself, frowning thoughtfully.    \"Frankly, I do not care to venture any opinion at present regarding the  immediate cause of death,\" he said.  \"Sir Crichton was addicted to  cocaine, but there are indications which are not in accordance with  cocaine-poisoning. I fear that only a post-mortem can establish the  facts--if,\" he added, \"we ever arrive at them.  A most mysterious case!\"    Smith stepping forward and engaging the famous pathologist in  conversation, I seized the opportunity to examine Sir Crichton's body.    The dead man was in evening dress, but wore an old smoking-jacket. He  had been of spare but hardy build, with thin, aquiline features, which  now were oddly puffy, as were his clenched hands.  I pushed back his  sleeve, and saw the marks of the hypodermic syringe upon his left arm.  Quite mechanically I turned my attention to the right arm.  It was  unscarred, but on the back of the hand was a faint red mark, not unlike  the imprint of painted lips.  I examined it closely, and even tried to  rub it off, but it evidently was caused by some morbid process of local  inflammation, if it were not a birthmark.    Turning to a pale young man whom I had understood to be Sir Crichton's  private secretary, I "]]]
