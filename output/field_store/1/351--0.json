Leland      Author of \"Hans Breitmann's Ballads,\" \"The Music Lesson of Confucius,\"  Etc. Etc.    Second Edition    LONDON  TRUBNER & CO., 57 & 59 LUDGATE HILL  1874    [_All rights reserved_]          PREFACE.      As Author of this book, I beg leave to observe that all which is stated  in it relative to the customs or peculiarities of Gipsies _was gathered  directly from Gipsies themselves_; and that every word of their language  here given, whether in conversations, stories, or sayings, was taken from  Gipsy mouths.  While entertaining the highest respect for the labours of  Mr George Borrow in this field, I have carefully avoided repeating him in  the least detail; neither have I taken anything from Simson, Hoyland, or  any other writer on the Rommany race in England.  Whatever the demerits  of the work may be, it can at least claim to be an original collection of  material fresh from nature, and not a reproduction from books.  There  are, it is true, two German Gipsy letters from other works, but these may  be excused as illustrative of an English one.    I may here in all sincerity speak kindly and gratefully of every true  Gipsy I have ever met, and of the cheerfulness with which they have  invariably assisted me in my labour to the extent of their humble  abilities.  Other writers have had much to say of their incredible  distrust of _Gorgios_ and unwillingness to impart their language, but I  have always found them obliging and communicative.  I have never had  occasion to complain of rapacity or greediness among them; on the  contrary, I have often wondered to see how the great want of such very  poor people was generally kept in check by their natural politeness,  which always manifests itself when they are treated properly.  In fact,  the first effort which I ever made to acquire a knowledge of English  Rommany originated in a voluntary offer from an intelligent old dame to  teach me \"the old Egyptian language.\"  And as she also suggested that I  should set forth the knowledge which I might acquire from her and her  relatives in a book (referring to Mr Borrow's having done so), I may hold  myself fully acquitted from the charge of having acquired and published  anything which my Gipsy friends would not have had made known to the  public.    Mr Borrow has very well and truly said that it is not by passing a few  hours among Gipsies that one can acquire a knowledge of their  characteristics; and I think that this book presents abundant evidence  that its contents were not gathered by slight and superficial intercourse  with the Rommany.  It is only by entering gradually and sympathetically,  without any parade of patronage, into a familiar knowledge of the  circumstances of the common life of humble people, be they Gipsies,  Indians, or whites, that one can surprise unawares those little inner  traits which constitute the _characteristic_.  However this may be, the  reader will readily enough understand, on perusing these pages--possibly  much better than I do myself--how it was I was able to collect whatever  they contain that is new.    The book contains some remarks on that great curious centre and secret of  all the nomadic and vagabond life in England, THE ROMMANY, with comments  on the fact, that of the many novel or story-writers who have described  the \"Travellers\" of the Roads, very few have penetrated the real nature  of their life.  It gives several incidents illustrating the character of  the Gipsy, and some information of a very curious nature in reference to  the respect of the English Gipsies for their dead, and the strange manner  in which they testify it.  I believe that this will be found to be fully  and distinctly illustrated by anecdotes and a narrative in the original  Gipsy language, with a translation.  There is also a chapter containing  in Rommany and English a very characteristic letter from a full-blood  Gipsy to a relative, which was dictated to me, and which gives a sketch  of the leading incidents of Gipsy life--trading in horses,  fortune-telling, and cock-shying.  I have also given accounts of  conversations with Gipsies, introducing in their language and in English  their own remarks (noted down by me) on certain curious customs; among  others, on one which indicates that many of them profess among themselves  a certain regard for our Saviour, because His birth and life appear to  them to be like that of the Rommany.  There is a collection of a number  of words now current in vulgar English which were probably derived from  Gipsy, such as row, shindy, pal, trash, bosh, and niggling, and finally a  number of _Gudli_ or short stories.  These _Gudli_ have been regarded by  my literary friends as interesting and curious, since they are nearly all  specimens of a form of original narrative occupying a middle ground  between the anecdote and fable, and abounding in Gipsy traits.  Some of  them are given word for word as they are current among Gipsies, and  others owe their existence almost entirely either to the vivid  imagination and childlike fancies of an old Gipsy assistant, or were  developed from some hint or imperfect saying or story.  But all are  thoroughly and truly Rommany; for every one, after being brought into  shape, passed through a purely \"unsophisticated\" Gipsy mind, and was  finally declared to be _tacho_, or sound, by real Rommanis.  The truth  is, that it is a difficult matter to hear a story among English Gipsies  which is not mangled or marred in the telling; so that to print it,  restitution and invention become inevitable.  But with a man who lived in  a tent among the gorse and fern, and who intermitted his earnest  conversation with a little wooden bear to point out to me the gentleman  on horseback riding over the two beautiful little girls in the flowers on  the carpet, such fables as I have given sprang up of themselves, owing  nothing to books, though they often required the influence of a better  disciplined mind to guide them to a consistent termination.    The Rommany English Vocabulary which I propose shall follow this work is  many times over more extensive than any ever before published, and it  will also be found interesting to all philologists by its establishing  the very curious fact that this last wave of the primitive Aryan-Indian  ocean which spread over Europe, though it has lost the original form in  its subsidence and degradation, consists of the same substance--or, in  other words, that although the grammar has wellnigh disappeared, the  words are almost without exception the same as those used in India,  Germany, Hungary, or Turkey.  It is generally believed that English Gipsy  is a mere jargon of the cant and slang of all nations, that of England  predominating; but a very slight examination of the Vocabulary will show  that during more than three hundred years in England the Rommany have not  admitted a single English word to what they correctly call their  language.  I mean, of course, so far as my own knowledge of Rommany  extends.  To this at least I can testify, that the Gipsy to whom I was  principally indebted for words, though he often used \"slang,\" invariably  discriminated correctly between it and Rommany; and I have often admired  the extraordinary pride in their language which has induced the Gipsies  for so many generations to teach their children this difference. {0a}  Almost every word which my assistant declared to be Gipsy I have found  either in Hindustani or in the works of Pott, Liebich, or Paspati.  On  this subject I would remark by the way, that many words which appear to  have been taken by the Gipsies from modern languages are in reality  Indian.    And as I have honestly done what I could to give the English reader fresh  material on the Gipsies, and not a rewarming of that which was gathered  by others, I sincerely trust that I may not be held to sharp account (as  the authors of such books very often are) for not having given more or  done more or done it better than was really in my power.  Gipsies in  England are passing away as rapidly as Indians in North America.  They  keep among themselves the most singular fragments of their Oriental  origin; they abound in quaint characteristics, and yet almost nothing is  done to preserve what another generation will deeply regret the loss of.  There are complete dictionaries of the Dacotah and many other American  Indian languages, and every detail of the rude life of those savages has  been carefully recorded; while the autobiographic romances of Mr Borrow  and Mr Simson's History contain nearly all the information of any value  extant relative to the English Gipsies.  Yet of these two writers, Mr  Borrow is the only one who had, so to speak, an inside view of his  subject, or was a philologist.    In conclusion I would remark, that if I have not, like many writers on  the poor Gipsies, abused them for certain proverbial faults, it has been  because they never troubled me with anything very serious of the kind, or  brought it to my notice; and I certainly never took the pains to hunt it  up to the discredit of people who always behaved decently to me.  I have  found them more cheerful, polite, and grateful than the lower orders of  other races in Europe or America; and I believe that where their respect  and sympathy are secured, they are quite as upright.  Like all people who  are regarded as outcasts, they are very proud of being trusted, and under  this influence will commit the most daring acts of honesty.  And with  this I commend my book to the public.  Should it be favourably received,  I will add fresh reading to it; in any case I shall at least have the  satisfaction of knowing that I did my best to collect material  illustrating a very curious and greatly-neglect"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16360"],[0,"Scientific American Supplement, No. 561, October 2, 1886 (#1)"],[1,"and the Online Distributed Proofreading Team at  www.pgdp.net            [Illustration]          SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN SUPPLEMENT NO. 561          NEW YORK, OCTOBER 2, 1886    Scientific American Supplement.

In a hydraulic packing press, the work done by the ram during one  stroke may be roughly divided into two periods, in the first of which  the resistance, although gradually increasing, may be called light,  while in the second the resistance is heavy. The former of these two  periods embraces the greater part of the stroke, and it is only a  small proportion at the end which requires the exercise of the full  power of the press to bring the material to the determined degree of  consolidation. Consequently, if a hydraulic press is to be worked so  as to waste no time, it requires to be provided with means by which  its table may be made to rise rapidly during the portion of the stroke  when the resistance is small, and afterward more slowly when the  entire power of the pumps is being expended upon the final squeeze.  Many methods of obtaining this end have been devised, and are in  common use both here and abroad. It is, however, more particularly in  the packing of raw material that such appliances are useful, since the  goods pressed into bales in this country are not usually of a very  yielding nature, and consequently do not require a long stroke to  bring them to a high state of compression. In India and Egypt, from  whence cotton is sent in bales, presses must have a long stroke; and  unless they can be worked rapidly, a very considerable amount of plant  is required to get through a moderate quantity of work. To meet the  necessities of these countries, Mr. Watson has devised several forms  of press in which not only is the table made to rise rapidly through  the greater part of its stroke, but the rams are kept almost  constantly in motion, so that the time occupied in filling the box  with raw cotton and in placing the ties round the bales is not lost.    [Illustration: COMPOUND HYDRAULIC PRESS. FIGS. 1 and 2.]    We illustrate four forms of Mr. Watson's presses, Fig. 1 being an  earlier construction, which, although very rapid at the date at which  it was brought out, has been far surpassed in celerity by the  arrangements shown in Figs. 3 to 8. It was introduced in 1873, and  forty-three presses according to this design were sent to India by the  makers, Messrs. Fawcett, Preston & Co., of Phoenix Foundry,  Liverpool, between that year and 1880. Four presses of this kind are  worked by one engine, having a cylinder 20 in. by 3 ft. stroke, and  driving eighteen to twenty pumps of varying diameter and short stroke.  The press has two long-stroke rams, LL, of small diameter, to compress  the loose material, and two short-stroke rams, FF, of large diameter,  to give the final squeeze. These two pairs of rams act alternately,  the one pair being idle while the other is in operation. The lashing  of the bale takes place while the larger rams are in action, the bale  being supported on the grid, B, which is pushed under it through  grooves formed in the press-head, S (Fig. 1). When the grid is in  place the press-head can be lowered, and the box be filled, while the  bale is receiving its final squeeze from the inverted rams above.    In Figs. 1 and 2 the press is shown in the position it would occupy if  the bale, M, were just completed and ready to be pushed out, and the  box, N, were full of material. The filling doors, CC, are shown turned  back level with the floor, the main doors, AA, are open, as are also  the end doors, KK, to admit the men to fasten up the bale. If water be  admitted to the subsidiary cylinder, H, the head, G, and two rams, FF,  will be raised, and then the bale, M, can be thrown out finished. All  the doors are now closed and water admitted to the rams, LL. These  immediately rise, pushing the contents of the box, N, before them, and  compressing them until the table, S, reaches the level of the grid, B.  At this moment the tappet rod, D, shuts off the water, and withdraws  the bolt of the doors, AA, which fly open. The grid, B (Fig. 2), is  then run through the grooves in the press-head, S, and the rams, LL,  are allowed to descend ready for a baling cloth to be inserted through  the doors, EE, and for the box, N, to be refilled. At the same time  the head, G, comes down on to the bale and compresses it still  further, while the men are at work lashing it. When the material is in  hanks, like jute, the rams, LL, are lowered slowly, while a man  standing inside the box, at about the level of the floor, packs the  material neatly on the table.    These presses can be worked with great rapidity, the average output  during a day varying from 21 to 28 bales an hour. The consumption of  coal per bale is 9 lb. "]]]
