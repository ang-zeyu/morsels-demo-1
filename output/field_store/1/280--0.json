The greater portion of the Republic was previously translated by  Francis Barham, Esq., and published in 1841. Although ably performed,  it was not sufficiently close for the purpose of the \"CLASSICAL  LIBRARY,\" and was therefore placed in the hands of the present editor  for revision, as well as for collation with recent texts. This has  occasioned material alterations and additions.    The treatise \"On the Nature of the Gods\" is a revision of that usually  ascribed to the celebrated Benjamin Franklin.              CONTENTS.      _Tusculan Disputations_    _On the Nature of the Gods_    _On the Commonwealth_              THE TUSCULAN DISPUTATIONS.    INTRODUCTION.      In the year A.U.C. 708, and the sixty-second year of Cicero's age, his  daughter, Tullia, died in childbed; and her loss afflicted Cicero to  such a degree that he abandoned all public business, and, leaving the  city, retired to Asterra, which was a country house that he had near  Antium; where, after a while, he devoted himself to philosophical  studies, and, besides other works, he published his Treatise de  Finibus, and also this treatise called the Tusculan Disputations, of  which Middleton gives this concise description:    \"The first book teaches us how to contemn the terrors of death, and to  look upon it as a blessing rather than an evil;    \"The second, to support pain and affliction with a manly fortitude;    \"The third, to appease all our complaints and uneasinesses under the  accidents of life;    \"The fourth, to moderate all our other passions;    \"And the fifth explains the sufficiency of virtue to make men happy.\"    It was his custom in the opportunities of his leisure to take some  friends with him into the country, where, instead of amusing themselves  with idle sports or feasts, their diversions were wholly speculative,  tending to improve the mind and enlarge the understanding. In this  manner he now spent five days at his Tusculan villa in discussing with  his friends the several questions just mentioned. For, after employing  the mornings in declaiming and rhetorical exercises, they used to  retire in the afternoon into a gallery, called the Academy, which he  had built for the purpose of philosophical conferences, where, after  the manner of the Greeks, he held a school, as they called it, and  invited the company to call for any subject that they desired to hear  explained, which being proposed accordingly by some of the audience  became immediately the argument of that day's debate. These five  conferences, or dialogues, he collected afterward into writing in the  very words and manner in which they really passed; and published them  under the title of his Tusculan Disputations, from the name of the  villa in which they were held.           *       *       *       *       *          BOOK I.    ON THE CONTEMPT OF DEATH.      I. At a time when I had entirely, or to a great degree, released myself  from my labors as an advocate, and from my duties as a senator, I had  recourse again, Brutus, principally by your advice, to those studies  which never had been out of my mind, although neglected at times, and  which after a long interval I resumed; and now, since the principles  and rules of all arts which relate to living well depend on the study  of wisdom, which is called philosophy, I have thought it an employment  worthy of me to illustrate them in the Latin tongue, not because  philosophy could not be understood in the Greek language, or by the  teaching of Greek masters; but it has always been my opinion that our  countrymen have, in some instances, made wiser discoveries than the  Greeks, with reference to those subjects which they have considered  worthy of devoting their attention to, and in others have improved upon  their discoveries, so that in one way or other we surpass them on every  point; for, with regard to the manners and habits of private life, and  family and domestic affairs, we certainly manage them with more  elegance, and better than they did; and as to our republic, that our  ancestors have, beyond all dispute, formed on better customs and laws.  What shall I say of our military affairs; in which our ancestors have  been most eminent in valor, and still more so in discipline? As to  those things which are attained not by study, but nature, neither  Greece, nor any nation, is comparable to us; for what people has  displayed such gravity, such steadiness, such greatness of soul,  probity, faith--such distinguished virtue of every kind, as to be equal  to our ancestors. In learning, indeed, and all kinds of literature,  Greece did excel us, and it was easy to do so where there was no  competition; for while among the Greeks the poets were the most ancient  species of learned men--since Homer and Hesiod lived before the  foundation of Rome, and Archilochus[1] was a contemporary of  Romulus--we received poetry much later. For it was about five hundred  and ten years after the building of Rome before Livius[2] published a  play in the consulship of C. Claudius, the son of Caecus, and M.  Tuditanus, a year before the birth of Ennius, who was older than  Plautus and Naevius.    II. It was, therefore, late before poets were either known or received  among us; though we find in Cato de Originibus that the guests used, at  their entertainments, to sing the praises of famous men to the sound of  the flute; but a speech of Cato's shows this kind of poetry to have  been in no great esteem, as he censures Marcus Nobilior for carrying  poets with him into his province; for that consul, as we know, carried  Ennius with him into AEtolia. Therefore the less esteem poets were in,  the less were those studies pursued; though even then those who did  display the greatest abilities that way were not very inferior to the  Greeks. Do we imagine that if it had been considered commendable in  Fabius,[3] a man of the highest rank, to paint, we should not have had  many Polycleti and Parrhasii? Honor nourishes art, and glory is the  spur with all to studies; while those studies are always neglected in  every nation which are looked upon disparagingly. The Greeks held skill  in vocal and instrumental music as a very important accomplishment, and  therefore it is recorded of Epaminondas, who, in my opinion, was the  greatest man among the Greeks, that he played excellently on the flute;  and Themistocles, some years before, was deemed ignorant because at an  entertainment he declined the lyre when it was offered to him. For this  reason musicians flourished in Greece; music was a general study; and  whoever was unacquainted with it was not considered as fully instructed  in learning. Geometry was in high esteem with them, therefore none were  more honorable than mathematicians. But we have confined this art to  bare measuring and calculating.    III. But, on the contrary, we early entertained an esteem for the  orator; though he was not at first a man of learning, but only quick at  speaking: in subsequent times he became learned; for it is reported  that Galba, Africanus, and Laelius were men of learning; and that even  Cato, who preceded them in point of time, was a studious man: then  succeeded the Lepidi, Carbo, and Gracchi, and so many great orators  after them, down to our own times, that we were very little, if at all,  inferior to the Greeks. Philosophy has been at a low ebb even to this  present time, and has had no assistance from our own language, and so  now I have undertaken to raise and illustrate it, in order that, as I  have been of service to my countrymen, when employed on public affairs,  I may, if possible, be so likewise in my retirement; and in this I must  take the more pains, because there are already many books in the Latin  language which are said to be written inaccurately, having been  composed by excellent men, only not of sufficient learning; for,  indeed, it is possible that a man may think well, and yet not be able  to express his thoughts elegantly; but for any one to publish thoughts  which he can neither arrange skilfully nor illustrate so as to  entertain his reader, is an unpardonable abuse of letters and  retirement: they, therefore, read their books to one another, and no  one ever takes them up but those who wish to have the same license for  careless writing allowed to themselves. Wherefore, if oratory has  acquired any reputation from my industry, I shall take the more pains  to open the fountains of philosophy, from which all my eloquence has  taken its rise.    IV. But, as Aristotle,[4] a man of the greatest genius, and of the most  various knowledge, being excited by the glory of the rhetorician  Isocrates,[5] commenced teaching young men to speak, and joined  philosophy with eloquence: so it is my design not to lay aside my  former study of oratory, and yet to employ myself at the same time in  this greater and more fruitful art; for I have always thought that to  be able to speak copiously and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14990"],[0,"Scientific American Supplement No. 819, September 12, 1891 (#1)"],[1,"Team at www.pgdp.net            [Illustration]          SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN SUPPLEMENT NO. 819          NEW YORK, SEPTEMBER 12, 1891.

All attempts to prepare gaseous fluids industrially were premature as  long as there were no means of carrying them under a sufficiently  diminished volume. For a few years past, the trade has been delivering  steel cylinders that permit of storing, without the least danger, a  gas under a pressure of from 120 to 200 atmospheres. The problem of  delivery without pipe laying having been sufficiently solved, that of  the industrial production of gases could be confronted in its turn.  Liquefied sulphurous acid, chloride of methyl, and carbonic acid have  been successively delivered, to commerce. The carbonic acid is now  being used right along in laboratories for the production of an  intense coldness, through its expansion. Oxygen and nitrogen, prepared  by chemical processes, soon followed, and now the industrial  electrolysis of water is about to permit of the delivery, in the same  manner, of very pure oxygen and hydrogen at a price within one's  reach.    Before describing the processes employed in this preparation, we must  answer a question that many of our readers might be led to ask us, and  that is, what can these gases be used for? We shall try to explain. A  prime and important application of pure hydrogen is that of inflating  balloons. Illuminating gas, which is usually employed for want of  something better, is sensibly denser than hydrogen and possesses less  ascensional force, whence the necessity of lightening the balloon or  of increasing its volume. Such inconveniences become serious with  dirigible balloons, whose surface, on the contrary, it is necessary to  diminish as much as possible. When the increasing interest taken in  aerostation at Paris was observed, an assured annual output of some  hundreds of cubic meters of eras for the sole use of balloons was  foreseen, the adoption of pure hydrogen being only a question of the  net cost.    Pure or slightly carbureted hydrogen is capable of being substituted  to advantage for coal gas for heating or lighting. Such an application  is doubtless somewhat premature, but we shall see that it has already  got out of the domain of Utopia. Finally the oxyhydrogen blowpipe,  which is indispensable for the treatment of very refractory metals,  consumes large quantities of hydrogen and oxygen.    For a few years past, oxygen has been employed in therapeutics; it is  found in commerce either in a gaseous state or in solution in water  (in siphons); it notably relieves persons afflicted with asthma or  depression; and the use of it is recommended in the treatment of  albumenuria. Does it cure, or at least does it contribute to cure,  anaemia, that terrible affection of large cities, and the prime source  of so many other troubles? Here the opinions of physicians and  physiologists are divided, and we limit ourselves to a mention of the  question without discussing it.    Only fifteen years ago it would have been folly to desire to obtain  remunerative results through the electrolysis of water. Such research  was subordinated to the industrial production of electric energy.    We shall not endeavor to establish the priority of the experiments and  discoveries. The question was in the air, and was taken up almost  simultaneously by three able experimenters--a Russian physicist, Prof.  Latchinof, of St. Petersburg, Dr. D'Arsonval, the learned professor of  the College of France, and Commandant Renard, director of the military  establishment of aerostation at Chalais. Mr. D'Arsonval collected  oxygen for experiments in physiology, while Commandant Renard  naturally directed his attention to the production of pure hydrogen.  The solutions of the question are, in fact, alike in principle, and  yet they have been developed in a very different manner, and we  believe that Commandant Renard's process is the completest from an  industrial standpoint. We shall give an account of it from a  communication made by this eminent military engineer, some time ago,  to the French Society of Physics.    _Transformations of the Voltameter._--In a laboratory, it is of no  consequence whether a liter of hydrogen costs a centime or a franc. So  long as it is a question of a few liters, one may, at his ease, waste  his energy and employ costly substances.    The internal resistance of a voltameter and the cost of platinum  electrodes of a few grammes should not arrest the physicist in an  experiment; but, in a production on a large scale, it is necessary to  decrease the resistance of the liquid column to as great a degree as  possible--that is to say, to increase its section and diminish its  thickness. The first condition leads to a suppression of the platinum,  and the second necessitates the use of new principles in the  construction of the voltameter. A laboratory voltameter consists  either of a U-shaped tube or of a trough in which the electrodes are  covered by bell glasses (Fig. 1, A and B). In either case, the  electric current must follow a tortuous and narrow path, in order to  pass from one electrode to the other, while, if the electrodes be left  entirely free in the bath, the gases, rising in a spreading form, will  mix at a certain height. It is necessary to separate them by a  partition (Fig. 1, C). If this is isolating and impermeable, there  will be no interest in raising the electrodes sensibly above its lower  edge. Now, the nearer together the electrodes are, the more it is  necessary to lower the partition. The extension of the electrodes and  the bringing of them together is the knotty part of the question. This  will be shown by a very simple calculation.    [Illustration: FIG. 1.--A, B, COMMONEST FORMS OF LABORATORY  VOLTAMETERS. C, DIAGRAM SHOWING ASCENT OF BUBBLES IN A VOLTAMETER.]    The visible electrolysis of water begins at an E.M.F. of about 1.7 V.  Below this there is no disengagement of bubbles. If the E.M.F. be  increased at the terminals of the voltameter, the current (and  consequently the production of gas) will become proportional to the  excess of the value over 1.7 V; but, at the same time, the current  will heat the circuit--that is to say, will produce a superfluous  work, and there will be waste. At 1.7 V the rendering is at its  maximum, but the useful effect is _nil_. In order to make an  advantageous use of the instruments, it is necessary to admit a  certain loss of energy, so much the less, moreover, in proportion as  the voltameters cost less; and as the saving is to be effected in the  current, rather than in the apparatus, we may admit the use of three  volts as a good proportion--that is to say, a loss of about half the  disposable energy. Under such conditions, a voltameter having an  internal resistance of 1 ohm produces 0.65 liter of hydrogen per"]]]
