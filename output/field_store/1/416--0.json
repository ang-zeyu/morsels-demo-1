(860-825)--The kingdom  of Urartu and its conquering princes: Menuas and Argistis._      Assyria was the first to reappear on the scene of action. Less hampered  by an ancient past than Egypt and Chaldaea, she was the sooner able to  recover her strength after any disastrous crisis, and to assume again  the offensive along the whole of her frontier line.         Image Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a bas-relief at Koyunjik       of the time of Sennacherib. The initial cut, which is also       by Faucher-Gudin, represents the broken obelisk of Assur-       nazir-pal, the bas-reliefs of which are as yet unpublished.    During the years immediately following the ephemeral victories and  reverses of Assurirba, both the country and its rulers are plunged in  the obscurity of oblivion. Two figures at length, though at what date  is uncertain, emerge from the darkness--a certain Irbaramman and an  Assur-nadinakhe II., whom we find engaged in building palaces and making  a necropolis. They were followed towards 950 by a Tiglath-pileser II.,  of whom nothing is known but his name.* He in his turn was succeeded  about the year 935 by one Assurdan II., who appears to have concentrated  his energies upon public works, for we hear of him digging a canal to  supply his capital with water, restoring the temples and fortifying  towns. Kamman-nirari III., who followed him in 912, stands out more  distinctly from the mists which envelop the history of this period;  he repaired the gate of the Tigris and the adjoining wall at Assur, he  enlarged its principal sanctuary, reduced several rebellious provinces  to obedience, and waged a successful warfare against the neighbouring  inhabitants of Karduniash. Since the extinction of the race of  Nebuchadrezzar I., Babylon had been a prey to civil discord and foreign  invasion. The Aramaean tribes mingled with, or contiguous to the  remnants of the Cossoans bordering on the Persian gulf, constituted  possibly, even at this period, the powerful nation of the Kalda.**         * Our only knowledge of Tiglath-pileser II. is from a brick,       on which he is mentioned as being the grandfather of Ramman-       nirari II.         ** The names Chaldaea and Chaldaeans being ordinarily used to       designate the territory and people of Babylon, I shall       employ the term Kaldu or Kalda in treating of the Aramaean       tribes who constituted the actual Chaldaean nation.    It has been supposed, not without probability, that a certain  Simashshikhu, Prince of the Country of the Sea, who immediately followed  the last scion of the line of Pashe,* was one of their chiefs. He  endeavoured to establish order in the city, and rebuilt the temple of  the Sun destroyed by the nomads at Sippar, but at the end of eighteen  years he was assassinated. His son Eamukinshurnu remained at the head of  affairs some three to six months; Kashshu-nadinakhe ruled three or  six years, at the expiration of which a man of the house of Bazi,  Eulbar-shakinshumi by name, seized upon the crown.** His dynasty  consisted of three members, himself included, and it was overthrown  after a duration of twenty years by an Elamite, who held authority for  another seven.***         * The name of this prince has been read Simbarshiku by       Peiser, a reading adopted by Rost; Simbarshiku would have       been shortened into Sibir, and we should have to identify it       with that of the Sibir mentioned by Assur-nazir-pal in his       Annals, col. ii. 1. 84, as a king of Karduniash who lived       before his (Assur-nazir-pal's) time (see p. 38 of the       present volume).         ** The name of this king may be read Edubarshakin-shumi. The       house of Bazi takes its name from an ancestor who must have       founded it at some unknown date, but who never reigned in       Chaldaea. Winckler has with reason conjectured that the name       subsequently lost its meaning to the Babylonians, and that       they confused the Chaldaean house of Bazi with the Arab       country of Bazu: this may explain why in his dynasties       Berosos attributes an Arab origin to that one which       comprises the short-lived line of Bit-Bazi.         *** Our knowledge of these events is derived solely from the       texts of the Babylonian Canon published and translated by G.       Smith, by Pinches, and by Sayce. The inscription of       Nabubaliddin informs us that Kashu-nadinakhe and Eulbar-       shakinshumu continued the works begun by Simashshiku in the       temple of the Sun at Sippar.    It was a period of calamity and distress, during which the Arabs or the  Aramaeans ravaged the country, and pillaged without compunction not only  the property of the inhabitants, but also that of the gods. The  Elamite usurper having died about the year 1030, a Babylonian of noble  extraction expelled the intruders, and succeeded in bringing the larger  part of the kingdom under his rule.*      * The names of the first kings of this dynasty are destroyed in  the copies of the Royal Canon which have come down to us. The three  preceding dynasties are restored as follows:--    [Illustration: 006.jpg TABLE OF KINGS]    Five or six of his descendants had passed away, and a certain  Shamash-mudammiq was feebly holding the reins of government, when the  expeditions of Ramman-nirari III. provoked war afresh between Assyria  and Babylon. The two armies encountered each other once again on  their former battlefield between the Lower Zab and the Turnat.  Shamash-mudammiq, after being totally routed near the Yalman mountains,  did not long survive, and Naboshumishkun, who succeeded him, showed  neither more ability nor energy than his predecessor. The Assyrians  wrested from him the fortresses of Bambala and Bagdad, dislodged him  from the positions where he had entrenched himself, and at length took  him prisoner while in flight, and condemned him to perpetual captivity.*         * Shamash-mudammiq appears to have died about 900.       Naboshumishkun probably reigned only one or two years, from       900 to 899 or to 898. The name of his successor is destroyed       in the _Synchronous History_; it might be Nabubaliddin, who       seems to have had a long life, but it is wiser, until fresh       light is thrown on the subject, to admit that it is some       prince other than"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17328"],[0,"History of Egypt, Chaldæa, Syria, Babylonia, and Assyria, Volume 8 (of 12) (#1)"],[1,"[Illustration: Spines]    [Illustration: Cover]    HISTORY OF EGYPT CHALDEA, SYRIA, BABYLONIA, AND ASSYRIA    By G.

The Taylor       Cylinder, found at Kouyunjik or Usebi-Yunus, contains the       history or the first eight years of this reign; the Bellino       Cylinder treats of the two first years of the reign.    He lacked the wisdom to conciliate the vanquished, or opportunely to  check his own repressive measures; he destroyed towns, massacred entire  tribes, and laid whole tracts of country waste, and by failing to  repeople these with captive exiles from other nations, or to import  colonists in sufficient numbers, he found himself towards the end of  his reign ruling over a sparsely inhabited desert where his father had  bequeathed to him flourishing provinces and populous cities. His was  the system of the first Assyrian conquerors, Shalmaneser III. and  Assur-nazir-pal, substituted for that of Tiglath-pileser III. and  Sargon. The assimilation of the conquered peoples to their conquerors  was retarded, tribute was no longer paid regularly, and the loss of  revenue under this head was not compensated by the uncertain increase  in the spoils obtained by war; the recruiting of the army, rendered more  difficult by the depopulation of revolted districts, weighed heavier  still on those which remained faithful, and began, as in former times,  to exhaust the nation. The news of Sargon's murder, published throughout  the Eastern world, had rekindled hope in the countries recently  subjugated by Assyria, as well as in those hostile to her. Phoenicia,  Egypt, Media, and Elam roused themselves from their lethargy and  anxiously awaited the turn which events should take at Nineveh and  Babylon. Sennacherib did not consider it to his interest to assume the  crown of Chaldaea, and to treat on a footing of absolute equality a  country which had been subdued by force of arms: he relegated it to the  rank of a vassal state, and while reserving the suzerainty for himself,  sent thither one of his brothers to rule as king.*         * The events which took place at Babylon at the beginning of       Sennacherib's reign are known to us from the fragments of       Berosus, compared with the Canon of Ptolemy and Pinches'       Babylonian Canon. The first interregnum in the Canon of       Ptolemy (704-702 B.C.) is filled in Pinches' Canon by three       kings who are said to have reigned as follows: Sennacherib,       two years; Marduk-zakir-shumu, one month; Merodach-baladan,       nine months. Berosus substitutes for Sennacherib one of his       brothers, whose name apparently he did not know; and this is       the version I have adopted, in agreement with most modern       historians, as best tallying with the evident lack of       affection for Babylon displayed by Sennacherib throughout       his reign.    The Babylonians were indignant at this slight. Accustomed to see their  foreign ruler conform to their national customs, take the hands of Bel,  and assume or receive from them a new throne-name, they could not resign  themselves to descend to the level of mere tributaries: in less than  two years they rebelled, assassinated the king who had been imposed upon  them, and proclaimed in his stead Marduk-zakir-shumu,* who was merely  the son of a female slave (704 B.C.).         * The servile origin of this personage is indicated in       Pinches' Babylonian Canon; he might, however, be connected       through his father with a princely, or even a royal, family,       and thereby be in a position to win popular support. Among       modern Assyriologists, some suppose that the name Akises in       Berosus is a corruption of [Marduk-]zakir[shumu]; others       consider Akises-Akishu as being the personal name of the       king, and Marduk-zakir-shumu his throne-name.    This was the signal for a general insurrection in Chaldaea and the  eastern part of the empire. Merodach-baladan, who had remained in hiding  in the valleys on the Elamite frontier since his defeat in 709 B.C.,  suddenly issued forth with his adherents, and marched at once to  Babylon; the very news of his approach caused a sedition, in the midst  of which Marduk-zakir-shumu perished, after having reigned for only one  month. Merodach-baladan re-entered his former capital, and as soon as  he was once more seated on the throne, he endeavoured to form alliances  with all the princes, both small and great, who might create a diversion  in his favour. His envoys obtained promises of help from Elam; other  emissaries hastened to Syria to solicit the alliance of Hezekiah, and  might have even proceeded to Egypt if their sovereign's good fortune had  lasted long enough.* But Sennacherib did not waste his opportunities in  lengthy-preparations.         * 2 Kings xx. 12-19; Isa. xxxix. The embassy to Hezekiah has       been assigned to the first reign of Merodach-baladan, under       Sargon. In accordance with the information obtained from the       Assyrian monuments, it seems to me that it could only have       taken place during his second reign, in 703 B.C.    The magnificent army left by Sargon was at his disposal, and summoning  it at once into the field, he advanced on the town of Kish, where the  Kalda monarch was entrenched with his Aramaean forces and the Elamite  auxiliaries furnished by Shutruk-nakhunta. The battle issued in the  complete rout of the confederate forces. Merodach-baladan fled almost  unattended, first to Guzum-manu, and then to the marshes of the Tigris,  where he found a temporary refuge; the troops who were despatched in  pursuit followed him for five days, and then, having failed to secure  the fugitive, gave up the search.*         * The detail is furnished by the _Bellino Cylinder_. Berosus       affirmed that Merodach-baladan was put to death by Belibni.    His camp fell into the possession of the victor, with all its  contents--chariots, horses, mules, camels, and herds of cattle belonging  to the commissariat department of the army: Babylon threw open its gates  without resistance, hoping, no doubt, that Sennacherib would at length  resolve to imitate the precedent set by his father and retain the royal  dignity for himself. He did, indeed, consent to remit the punishment for  this first insurrection, and contented himself with pillaging the  royal treasury and palace, but he did not deign to assume the crown,  conferring it on Belibni, a Babylonian of noble birth, who had been  taken, when quite a child, to Nineveh and educated there under the eyes  of Sargon.*         * The name is transcribed Belibos in Greek, and it seems as       if the Assyrian variants justify the pronunciation Belibush.    While he was thus reorganising the government, his generals were  bringing the campaign to a close: they sacked, one after another,  eighty-nine strongholds and eight hundred and twenty villages of  the Kalda; they drove out the Arabian and Aramaean garrisons which  Merodach-baladan had placed in the cities of Karduniash, in Urak, Nipur,  Kuta, and Kharshag-kalamma, and they re-established Assyrian supremacy  over all the tribes on the east of the Tigris up to the frontiers of  Elam, the Tumuna, the Ubudu,"]]]
