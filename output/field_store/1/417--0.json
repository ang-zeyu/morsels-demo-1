The reason of this  is not to be ascribed to the shortness of its duration: the Chaldaean  empire of Nebuchadrezzar lasted for a period quite as brief, and yet the  main outlines of its history can be established with some certainty in  spite of large blanks and much obscurity. Whereas at Babylon, moreover,  original documents abound, enabling us to put together, feature by  feature, the picture of its ancient civilisation and of the chronology  of its kings, we possess no contemporary monuments of Ecbatana to  furnish direct information as to its history. To form any idea of  the Median kings or their people, we are reduced to haphazard notices  gleaned from the chroniclers of other lands, retailing a few isolated  facts, anecdotes, legends, and conjectures, and, as these materials  reach us through the medium of the Babylonians or the Greeks of the  fifth or sixth century B.C., the picture which we endeavour to compose  from them is always imperfect or out of perspective. We seemingly  catch glimpses of ostentatious luxury, of a political and military  organisation, and a method of government analogous to that which  prevailed at later periods among the Persians, but more imperfect,  ruder, and nearer to barbarism--a Persia, in fact, in the rudimentary  stage, with its ruling spirit and essential characteristics as yet  undeveloped. The machinery of state had doubtless been adopted almost  in its entirety from the political organisations which obtained in the  kingdoms of Assyria, Elam, and Chaldaea, with which sovereignties the  founders of the Median empire had held in turns relations as vassals,  enemies, and allies; but once we penetrate this veneer of Mesopotamian  civilisation and reach the inner life of the people, we find in the  religion they profess--mingled with some borrowed traits--a world of  unfamiliar myths and dogmas of native origin.    The main outlines of this religion were already fixed when the  Medes rose in rebellion against Assur-bani-pal; and the very name of  _Confessor_--Fravartish--applied to the chief of that day, proves that  it was the faith of the royal family. It was a religion common to all  the Iranians, the Persians as well as the Medes, and legend honoured as  its first lawgiver and expounder an ancient prophet named Zarathustra,  known to us as Zoroaster.* Most classical writers relegated Zoroaster  to some remote age of antiquity--thus he is variously said to have lived  six thousand years before the death of Plato,** five thousand before the  Trojan war,*** one thousand before Moses, and six hundred before Xerxes'  campaign against Athens; while some few only affirmed that he had lived  at a comparatively recent period, and made him out a disciple of the  philosopher Pythagoras, who flourished about the middle of the fifth  century B.C.         * The name Zarathustra has been interpreted in a score of       different ways. The Greeks sometimes attributed to it the       meaning \"worshipper of the stars,\" probably by reason of the       similarity in sound of the termination \"-astres\" of       Zoroaster with the word \"astron.\" Among modern writers, H.       Rawlinson derived it from the Assyrian Ziru-Ishtar, \"the       seed of Ishtar,\" but the etymology now most generally       accepted is that of Burnouf, according to which it would       signify \"the man with gold-coloured camels,\" the \"possessor       of tawny camels.\" The ordinary Greek form Zoroaster seems to       be derived from some name quite distinct from Zarathustra.         ** This was, as Pliny records, the opinion of Eudoxus; not       Eudoxus of Cnidus, pupil of Plato, as is usually stated, but       a more obscure personage, Eudoxus of Rhodes.         *** This was the statement of Hermodorus.    According to the most ancient national traditions, he was born in the  Aryanem-vaejo, or, in other words, in the region between the Araxes and  the Kur, to the west of the Caspian Sea. Later tradition asserted  that his conception was attended by supernatural circumstances, and  the miracles which accompanied his birth announced the advent of a saint  destined to regenerate the world by the revelation of the True Law. In  the belief of an Iranian, every man, every living creature now existing  or henceforth to exist, not excluding the gods themselves, possesses a  Frohar, or guardian spirit, who is assigned to him at his entrance into  the world, and who is thenceforth devoted entirely to watching over  his material and moral well-being,* About the time appointed for the  appearance of the prophet, his Frohar was, by divine grace, imprisoned  in the heart of a Haoma,** and was absorbed, along with the juice of  the plant, by the priest Purushaspa,*** during a sacrifice, a ray of  heavenly glory descending at the same time into the bosom of a maiden of  noble race, named Dughdova, whom Purushaspa shortly afterwards espoused.         * The Fravashi (for _fravarti_, from _fra-var_, \"to support,       nourish\"), or the _frohar (feruer)_, is, properly speaking,       the nurse, the genius who nurtures. Many of the practices       relating to the conception and cult of the Fravashis seem to       me to go back to the primitive period of the Iranian       religions.         ** The haoma is an _Asclepias Sarcostema Viminalis_.         *** The name signifies \"He who has many horses.\"    Zoroaster was engendered from the mingling of the Frohar with the  celestial ray.

[Illustration: Titlepage]            PREFACE    Professor Maspero closes his History of Egypt with the conquest of  Alexander the Great. There is a sense of dramatic fitness in this  selection, for, with the coming of the Macedonians, the sceptre of  authority passed for ever out of the hand of the Egyptian. For several  centuries the power of the race had been declining, and foreign nations  had contended for the vast treasure-house of Egypt. Alexander found the  Persians virtually rulers of the land. The ancient people whose fame  has come down to us through centuries untarnished had been forced to  bow beneath the yoke of foreign masters, and nations of alien blood were  henceforth to dominate its history.    The first Ptolemy founded a Macedonian or Greek dynasty that maintained  supremacy in Egypt until the year 30 B.C. His successors were his lineal  descendants, and to the very last they prided themselves on their  Greek origin; but the government which they established was essentially  Oriental in character. The names of Ptolemy and Cleopatra convey an  Egyptian rather than a Greek significance; and the later rulers of  the dynasty were true Egyptians, since their ancestors had lived in  Alexandria for three full centuries.    In the year 30 B.C. Augustus Caesar conquered the last of the Ptolemies,  the famous Cleopatra. Augustus made Egypt virtually his private  province, and drew from it resources that were among the chief elements  of his power. After Augustus, the Romans continued in control until  the coming of the Saracens under Amr, in the seventh century. Various  dynasties of Mohammedans, covering a period of several centuries,  maintained control until the Mamluks, in 1250, overthrew the legitimate  rulers, to be themselves overthrown three centuries later by the Turks  under Selim I. Turkish rule was maintained until near the close of the  eighteenth century, when the French, under Napoleon Bonaparte, invaded  Egypt. In 1806, after the expulsion of the French by the English, the  famous Mehemet Ali destroyed the last vestiges of Mamluk power, and set  up a quasi-independent sovereignty which was not disturbed until toward  the close of the nineteenth century. The events of the last twenty-five  years, comprising a short period of joint control of Egypt by the French  and English, followed by the British occupation, are fresh in the mind  of the reader.    What may be termed the modern history of Egypt covers a period of more  than twenty-two centuries. During this time the native Egyptian can  scarcely be said to have a national history, but the land of Egypt, and  the races who have become acclimated there, have passed through many  interesting phases. Professor Maspero completes the history of antiquity  in that dramatic scene in which the ancient Egyptian makes his last  futile struggle for independence. But the Nile Valley has remained the  scene of the most important events where the strongest nations of the  earth contended for supremacy. It is most interesting to note that  the invaders of Egypt, while impressing their military stamp upon the  natives, have been mastered in a very real sense by the spell of  Egypt's greatness; but the language, the key to ancient learning and  civilisation, still remained a well-guarded secret. Here and there one  of the Ptolemies or Greeks thought it worth his while to master the  hieroglyphic writing. Occasionally a Roman of the later period may have  done the same, but such an accomplishment was no doubt very unusual from  the first. The subordinated Egyptians therefore had no resource but to  learn the language of their conquerors, and presently it came to pass  that not even the native Egyptian remembered the elusive secrets of  his own written language. Egyptian, as a spoken tongue, remained, in  a modified form, as Koptic, but at about the beginning of our era the  classical Egyptian had become a dead language. No one any longer wrote  in the hieroglyphic, hieratic, or demotic scripts; in a word, the  hieroglyphic writing was forgotten. The reader of Professor Maspero's  pages has had opportunity to learn how this secret was discovered in the  nineteenth century. This information is further amplified in the present  volumes, and we see how in our own time the native Egyptian has regained  something of his former grandeur through the careful and scientific  study of monuments, inscriptions, and works of art. Thus it will appear  in the curious rounding out of the enigmatic story that the most ancient  history of civilisation becomes also the newest and most modern human  history.          PUBLISHER'S NOTE    It should be explained that Doctor Rappoport, in preparing these  volumes, has drawn very largely upon the authorities who have previously  laboured in the same field, and in particular upon the works of Creasy,  Duruy, Ebers, Lavisse, Marcel, Michaud, Neibuhr, Paton, Ram-baud, Sharp,  and Weil. The results of investigations by Professor W. M. Flinders  Petrie and other prominent Egyptologists have been fully set forth and  profusely illustrated.

When Alexander the Great bridged the gulf dividing Occident and Orient,  the Greeks had attained to a state of maturity in the development of  their national art and literature. Greek culture and civilisation,  passing beyond the boundaries of their national domain, crossed this  bridge and spread over the Asiatic world. To perpetuate his name, the  great Macedonian king founded a city, and selected for this purpose,  with extraordinary prescience, a spot on the banks of the Nile, which,  on account of its geographical position, was destined to become a  centre, not only of international commerce and an entrepot between Asia  and Europe, but also a centre of intellectual culture. The policy of  Alexander to remove the barriers between the Greeks and the Asiatics,  and to pave the way for the union of the races of his vast empire, was  continued by the Lagidae dynasty in Egypt. With her independence and  native dynasties, Egypt had also lost her political strength and unity;  she retained, however, her ancient institutions, her customs, and  religious system. The sway of Persian dominion had passed over her  without overthrowing this huge rock of sacerdotal power which, deeply  rooted with many ramifications, seemed to mock the wave of time."]]]
