GRAMMAR, which is the art of using words properly, comprises four parts:  Orthography, Etymology, Syntax, and Prosody.        In this division and order of the parts of grammar I follow the common      grammarians, without inquiring whether a fitter distribution might not      be found. Experience has long shown this method to be so distinct as to      obviate confusion, and so comprehensive as to prevent any inconvenient      omissions. I likewise use the terms already received, and already      understood, though perhaps others more proper might sometimes be      invented. Sylburgius, and other innovators, whose new terms have sunk      their learning into neglect, have left sufficient warning against the      trifling ambition of teaching arts in a new language.    ORTHOGRAPHY is the art of combining letters into syllables, and syllables  into words. It therefore teaches previously the form and sound of letters.    The letters of the English language are,    Roman.      Italick.    Name.

Our letters are commonly reckoned twenty-four, because anciently i and      j as well as u and v were expressed by the same character; but as those      letters, which had always different powers, have now different forms,      our alphabet may be properly said to consist of twenty-six letters    Vowels are five, a, e, i, o, u.    Such is the number generally received; but for i it is the practice to  write y in the end of words, as thy, holy; before i, as from die, dying;  from beautify, beautifying; in the words says, days, eyes; and in words  derived from the Greek, and written originally with [Greek: y], as  sympathy, [Greek: sympatheia], system, [Greek: systema].    For u we often write w after a vowel, to make a diphthong; as, raw, grew,  view, vow, flowing; lowness.    The sounds of all the letters are various.        In treating on the letters, I shall not, like some other grammarians,      inquire into the original of their form, as an antiquarian; nor into      their formation and prolation by the organs of speech, as a mechanick,      anatomist, or physiologist; nor into the properties and gradation of      sounds, or the elegance or harshness of particular combinations, as a      writer of universal and transcendental grammar. I consider the English      alphabet only as it is English; and even in this narrow disquisition I      follow the example of former grammarians, perhaps with more reverence      than judgment, because by writing in English I suppose my reader      already acquainted with the English language, and consequently able to      pronounce the letters of which I teach the pronunciation; and because      of sounds in general it may be observed, that words are unable to      describe them. An account, therefore, of the primitive and simple      letters, is useless, almost alike to those who know their sound, and      those who know it not.    OF VOWELS    A.    A has three sounds, the slender, open, and broad.    A slender is found in most words, as face, mane, and in words ending in  ation, as creation, salvation, generation.        The a slender is the proper English a, called very justly by Erpenius,      in his Arabick Grammar, a Anglicum cum e mistum, as having a middle      sound between the open a and the e. The French have a similar sound in      the word pais, and in their e masculine.    A open is the a of the Italian, or nearly resembles it; as father, rather,  congratulate, fancy, glass.    A broad resembles the a of the German; as all, wall, call.        Many words pronounced with a broad were anciently written with au; as      sault, mault; and we still say, fault, vault. This was probably the      Saxon sound, for it is yet retained in the northern dialects, and in      the rustick pronunciation; as maun for man, haund for hand.    The short a approaches to the a open, as grass.    The long a, if prolonged by e at the end of the word, is always slender, as  graze, fame.    A forms a diphthong only with i or y, and u or w. Ai or ay, as in plain,  wain, gay, clay, has only the sound of the long and slender a, and differs  not in the pronunciation from plane, wane.    Au or aw has the sound of the German a, as raw, naughty.        Ae is sometimes found in Latin words not completely naturalized or      assimilated, but is no English diphthong; and is more properly      expressed by single e, as Cesar, Eneas.    E.        E is the letter which occurs most frequently in the English language.    E is long, as in sc[=e]ne; or short, as in c[)e]llar, s[)e]parate,  c[)e]lebrate, m[)e]n, th[)e]n.    It is always short before a double consonant, or two consonants, as in  v[)e]x, p[)e]rplexity, rel[)e]nt, m[)e]dlar, r[)e]ptile, s[)e]rpent,  c[)e]llar, c[)e]ssation, bl[)e]ssing, f[)e]ll, f[)e]lling, d[)e]bt.    E is always mute at the end of a word, except in monosyllables that have no  other vowel, as the; or proper names, as Penelope, Phebe, Derbe; being used  to modify the foregoing consonants, as since, once, hedge, oblige; or to  lengthen the preceding vowel, as b[)a]n, b[=a]ne; c[)a]n, c[=a]ne; p[)i]n,  p[=i]ne; t[)u]n, t[=u]ne; r[)u]b, r[=u]be; p[)o]p, p[=o]pe; f[)i]r,  f[=i]re; c[)u]r, c[=u]re; t[)u]b, t[=u]be.        Almost all words which now terminate in consonants ended anciently in      e, as year, yeare; wildness, wildnesse; which e probably had the force      of the French e feminine, and constituted a syllable with its associate      consonant; for in old editions words are sometimes divided thus,      clea-re, fel-le, knowled-ge. This e was perhaps for a time vocal or      silent in poetry as convenience required; but it has been long wholly      mute. Camden in his Remains calls it the silent e.    It does not always lengthen the foregoing vowel, as gl[)o]ve, l[)i]ve,  g[)i]ve.    It has sometimes in the end of words a sound obscure, and scarcely  perceptible, as open, shapen, shotten, thistle, participle, metre, lucre.        This faintness of sound is found when e separates a mute from a liquid,      as in rotten, or follows a mute and liquid, as in cattle.    E forms a diphthong with a, as near; with i, as deign, receive; and with u  or w, as new, stew.    Ea sounds like e long, as mean; or like ee, as dear, clear, near.    Ei is sounded like e long, as seize, perceiving.    Eu sounds as u long and soft.    E, a, u, are combined in beauty and its derivatives, but have only the  sound of u.    E may be said to form a diphthong by reduplication, as agree, sleeping.        Eo is found in yeoman, where it is sounded as o short; and in people,      where it is pronounced like ee.    I.    I has a sound long, as f[=i]ne; and short as f[)i]n.        That is eminently observable in i, which may be likewise remarkable in      other letters, that the short sound is not the long sound contracted,      but a sound wholly different.    The long sound in monosyllables is always marked by the e final, as  th[)i]n, th[=i]ne.    I is often sounded before r, as a short u; as flirt, first, shirt.    It forms a diphthong only with e, as field, shield, which is sounded as the  double ee; except friend, which is sounded as fr[)e]nd.        I is joined with eu in lieu, and ew in view; which triphthongs are      sounded as the open u.    O.    O is long, as b[=o]ne, [=o]bedient, corr[=o]ding; or short, as bl[)o]ck,  kn[)o]ck, [)o]blique, l[)o]ll.    Women is pronounced wimen.        The short o has sometimes the sound of close u, as son, come.    O coalesces into a diphthong with a, as moan, groan, approach: oa has the  sound of o long.        O is united to e in some words derived from Greek, as oeconomy; but as      being not an English diphthong, they are better written as they are      sounded, with only e, economy.    With i, as oil, soil, moil, noisome.        This coalition of letters seems to unite the sounds of the two letters,      as far as two sounds can be united without being destroyed, and      therefore approaches more nearly than any combination in our tongue to      the notion of a diphthong.    With o, as boot, hoot, cooler; oo has the sound of the Italian u.    With u or w, as our, power, flower; but in some words has only the sound of  o long, as in soul, bowl, sow, grow. These different sounds are used to  distinguish different significations: as bow an instrument for shooting;  bow, a depression of the head; sow, the she of a boar; sow, to scatter  seed; bowl, an "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15100"],[0,"The Voyage of Governor Phillip to Botany Bay (#1)"],[1,"Voyage  of  Governor Phillip  to  Botany Bay  with an  Account of the Establishment of the Colonies of  Port Jackson and Norfolk Island;  compiled from Authentic Papers,  which have been obtained from the several Departments  to which are added  the Journals of Lieuts.

NOVEMBER 25, 1789.      ANECDOTES OF GOVERNOR PHILLIP.    Arthur Phillip is one of those officers, who, like Drake, Dampier, and  Cook, has raised himself by his merit and his services, to distinction  and command. His father was Jacob Phillip, a native of Frankfort, in  Germany, who having settled in England, maintained his family and educated  his son by teaching the languages. His mother was Elizabeth Breach, who  married for her first husband, Captain Herbert of the navy, a kinsman of  Lord Pembroke. Of her marriage with Jacob Phillip, was her son, Arthur,  born in the parish of Allhallows, Bread-street, within the city of London,  on the 11th of October, 1738.    Being designed for a seafaring life, he was very properly sent to the  school of Greenwich, where he received an education suitable to his early  propensities. At the age of sixteen, he began his maritime career, under  the deceased Captain Michael Everet of the navy, at the commencement of  hostilities, in 1755: and at the same time that he learned the rudiments  of his profession under that able officer, he partook with him in the early  misfortunes, and subsequent glories of the seven years war. Whatever  opulence Phillip acquired from the capture of the Havannah, certain it is,  that, at the age of twenty-three, he there was made a Lieutenant into the  Stirling-castle, on the 7th of June, 1761, by Sir George Pococke, an  excellent judge of naval accomplishments.    But of nautical exploits, however they may raise marine officers, there  must be an end. Peace, with its blessings, was restored in 1763. And Phillip  now found leisure to marry; and to settle at Lyndhurst, in the New Forest,  where he amused himself with farming, and like other country gentlemen,  discharged assiduously those provincial offices, which, however unimportant,  occupy respectably the owners of land, who, in this island, require no office  to make them important.    But sailors, like their own element, are seldom at rest. Those occupations,  which pleased Phillip while they were new, no longer pleased him when  they became familiar. And he hastened to offer his skill and his services to  Portugal when it engaged in warfare with Spain. His offer was readily  accepted, because such skill and services were necessary amidst an arduous  struggle with a too powerful opponent. And, such was his conduct and such  his success, that when the recent interference of France, in 1778, made  it his duty to fight for his king, and to defend his country, the Portugueze  court regretted his departure, but applauded his motive.    His return was doubtless approved by those who, knowing his value, could  advance his rank: For he was made master and commander into the Basilisk  fireship, on the 2d of September, 1779. But in her he had little opportunity  of displaying his zeal, or of adding to his fame. This step, however, led  him up to a higher situation; and he was made post-captain into the Ariadne  frigate, on the 13th of November, 1781, when he was upwards of three and  forty. This is the great epoch in the lives of our naval officers, because  it is from this that they date their rank. In the Ariadne, he had little  time for active adventures, or for gainful prizes, being appointed to the  Europe of sixty-four guns, on the 23d of December, 1781. During the memorable  year 1782, Phillip promoted its enterprises, and shared in its glories.  And in January, 1783, he sailed with a reinforcement to the East Indies,  where superior bravery contended against superior force, till the policy  of our negotiators put an end to unequal hostilities by a necessary peace.    The activity, or the zeal of Phillip, was now turned to more peaceful  objects. And when it was determined to form a settlement on that part of  New Holland, denominated New South Wales, he was thought of as a proper  officer to conduct an enterprize, which required professional knowledge,  and habitual prudence. His equipment, his voyage, and his settlement, in  the other hemisphere, will be found in the following volume. When the time  shall arrive that the European settlers on Sydney Cove demand their historian,  these authentic anecdotes of their pristine legislator will be sought for  as curious, and considered as important.      ERRATA (These have been corrected in this eBook)  Page, line  1, 15, for enterprizes, read enterprises.  13, penult. for only fifty, read an hundred.  Ibid. ult. for Penryn, read Penrhyn.  75, 7, for Surprize, read Surprise.  87, 14, after 17, dele th.  96, 13, for into, read in.  149, 10, for Kangooroo, read Kanguroo. The orthography of a word              derived only from oral sound is in some degree arbitrary; but              it ought to be consistant. The plates, by mistake, have Kangooroo.  185, 14, for it were were, read if it were.  203, 3, for Fobn, read Thomas.  213, 10, for four, read forty.  228, 23, bis, for Macauley, read Macaulay.  231, 15, for Patri, read Pabi.  252, Margin, for May, read June.  253, Ditto.  255, Margin, for July, read June.  256, Ditto.  232, 18, for Taha, read Toha.  242, 9, for who, read whom.  246, 25, for veer'd, read near'd.      N. B. Some of the early impressions of the plates have erroneously Wulpine  Oppossum for Vulpine Opossum. After a few were work'd off the fault was  perceived, and corrected.      ADVERTISEMENT.    The arrangement of materials in this volume being in some respects less  perfect than might be wished, it is necessary that something should be  said to obviate any imputation of negligence. The truth will be the best,  and, as it ought, the only apology. The official papers of Governor Phillip,  which were liberally communicated by Government, formed at first our principal  source of intelligence. These, from their nature, could contain but little  information on subjects of natural history, and many other points, concerning  which the curiosity of every reader would naturally be excited. The efforts  of the publisher to give satisfaction to the public in these respects produced  a gradual influx of materials; and the successive arrival of different vessels  from the Indian seas, occasioned additions to the work, which made it  necessary to engrave new plates. While, therefore, the completion  of the book was anxiously pressed by many who were eager to possess it,  that desirable point has constantly been deferred by the communications of  those who were studious to render it more valuable; and the word Finis, has  seemed to fly from us, like Italy before the wandering Trojans. From the  combination of these circumstances it has arisen, that every separate part  has been hurried on in the execution; and yet, in the finishing of the  whole, more time has elapsed, than would have been necessary to complete  a much more ample volume. The defects that proceed from these causes, it  is hoped, the reader will forgive, and accept with complacency a volume  in which, it is confidently hoped, nothing material has been omitted that  is connected with its principal object, the formation of a settlement  promising both glory and advantage to this country; in which several  important discoveries are announced; no small accession is made to the  stores of natural history; and interesting notices are communicated of  countries visited before, and persons in whose fate the public has long  felt an interest.    The publisher thinks it his duty, in this place, to return thanks to the  following noblemen and gentlemen, for their kind assistance and free  communications. The Marquis of Salisbury, Viscount Sydney, Lord Hood,  Sir Joseph Banks, Bart. Mr. Rose, Mr. Nepean, Mr. Stephens, Sir Charles  Middleton, Sir Andrew Snape Hammond, Mr. Dalrymple, and Mr. Chalmers: but,  to Mr. Latham particularly, the most grateful acknowledgements are due,  for having furnished many drawings and accurate descriptions, which stamp  a value on the natural history contained in this work, and must for ever  render it an object of attention to all lovers of that science: and to  Lieutenant Shortland, Lieutenant Watts, and Captain Marshall, of the  Scarborough transport, the public owe whatever important discoveries and  useful knowledge may be found in their journals, which they communicated  with a disinterestedness that the publisher will be always happy to  acknowledge.      ACCOUNT OF THE VIGNETTE.    The elegant vignette in the title-page, was engraved from a medallion which  the ingenious Mr. Wedge-wood caused to be modelled from a small piece of  clay brought from Sydney Cove. The clay proves to be of a fine texture,  and will be found very useful for the manufactory of earthern ware. The  design is allegorical; it represents Hope encouraging Art and Labour,  under the influence of Peace, to pursue the employments necessary to give  security and happiness to an infant settlement. The following verses upon  the same subject, and in allusion to the medallion, were written by the  author of The Botanic Garden, and will speak more powerfully"]]]
