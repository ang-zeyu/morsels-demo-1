The author, at that time, was young, twenty-  four years of age, and his production bears the stamp of his youth with  its good and its faulty features, of neither of which he feels ashamed.  It was translated into English, in 1885, by an American lady, Mrs. F.  Kelley Wischnewetzky, and published in the following year in New York.  The American edition being as good as exhausted, and having never been  extensively circulated on this side of the Atlantic, the present English  copyright edition is brought out with the full consent of all parties  interested.    For the American edition, a new Preface and an Appendix were written in  English by the author.  The first had little to do with the book itself;  it discussed the American Working-Class Movement of the day, and is,  therefore, here omitted as irrelevant, the second--the original  preface--is largely made use of in the present introductory remarks.    The state of things described in this book belongs to-day, in many  respects, to the past, as far as England is concerned.  Though not  expressly stated in our recognised treatises, it is still a law of modern  Political Economy that the larger the scale on which Capitalistic  Production is carried on, the less can it support the petty devices of  swindling and pilfering which characterise its early stages.  The  pettifogging business tricks of the Polish Jew, the representative in  Europe of commerce in its lowest stage, those tricks that serve him so  well in his own country, and are generally practised there, he finds to  be out of date and out of place when he comes to Hamburg or Berlin; and,  again, the commission agent, who hails from Berlin or Hamburg, Jew or  Christian, after frequenting the Manchester Exchange for a few months,  finds out that, in order to buy cotton yarn or cloth cheap, he, too, had  better drop those slightly more refined but still miserable wiles and  subterfuges which are considered the acme of cleverness in his native  country.  The fact is, those tricks do not pay any longer in a large  market, where time is money, and where a certain standard of commercial  morality is unavoidably developed, purely as a means of saving time and  trouble.  And it is the same with the relation between the manufacturer  and his \"hands.\"    The revival of trade, after the crisis of 1847, was the dawn of a new  industrial epoch.  The repeal of the Corn Laws and the financial reforms  subsequent thereon gave to English industry and commerce all the elbow-  room they had asked for.  The discovery of the Californian and Australian  gold-fields followed in rapid succession.  The Colonial markets developed  at an increasing rate their capacity for absorbing English manufactured  goods.  In India millions of hand-weavers were finally crushed out by the  Lancashire power-loom.  China was more and more being opened up.  Above  all, the United States--then, commercially speaking, a mere colonial  market, but by far the biggest of them all--underwent an economic  development astounding even for that rapidly progressive country.  And,  finally, the new means of communication introduced at the close of the  preceding period--railways and ocean steamers--were now worked out on an  international scale; they realised actually, what had hitherto existed  only potentially, a world-market.  This world-market, at first, was  composed of a number of chiefly or entirely agricultural countries  grouped around one manufacturing centre--England--which consumed the  greater part of their surplus raw produce, and supplied them in return  with the greater part of their requirements in manufactured articles.  No  wonder England's industrial progress was colossal and unparalleled, and  such that the status of 1844 now appears to us as comparatively primitive  and insignificant.  And in proportion as this increase took place, in the  same proportion did manufacturing industry become apparently moralised.  The competition of manufacturer against manufacturer by means of petty  thefts upon the workpeople did no longer pay.  Trade had outgrown such  low means of making money; they were not worth while practising for the  manufacturing millionaire, and served merely to keep alive the  competition of smaller traders, thankful to pick up a penny wherever they  could.  Thus the truck system was suppressed, the Ten Hours' Bill was  enacted, and a number of other secondary reforms introduced--much against  the spirit of Free Trade and unbridled competition, but quite as much in  favour of the giant-capitalist in his competition with his less favoured  brother.  Moreover, the larger the concern, and with it the number of  hands, the greater the loss and inconvenience caused by every conflict  between master and men; and thus a new spirit came over the masters,  especially the large ones, which taught them to avoid unnecessary  squabbles, to acquiesce in the existence and power of Trades' Unions, and  finally even to discover in strikes--at opportune times--a powerful means  to serve their own ends.  The largest manufacturers, formerly the leaders  of the war against the working-class, were now the foremost to preach  peace and harmony.  And for a very good reason.  The fact is, that all  these concessions to justice and philanthropy were nothing else but means  to accelerate the concentration of capital in the hands of the few, for  whom the niggardly extra extortions of former years had lost all  importance and had become actual nuisances; and to crush all the quicker  and all the safer their smaller competitors, who could not make both ends  meet without such perquisites.  Thus the development of production on the  basis of the capitalistic system has of itself sufficed--at least in the  leading industries, for in the more unimportant branches this is far from  being the case--to do away with all those minor grievances which  aggravated the workman's fate during its earlier stages.  And thus it  renders more and more evident the great central fact, that the cause of  the miserable condition of the working-class is to be sought, not in  these minor grievances, but _in the Capitalistic System itself_.  The  wage-worker sells to the capitalist his labour-force for a certain daily  sum.  After a few hours' work he has reproduced the value of that sum;  but the substance of his contract is, that he has to work another series  of hours to complete his working-day; and the value he produces during  these additional hours of surplus labour is surplus value, which cost the  capitalist nothing, but yet goes into his pocket.  That is the basis of  the system which tends more and more to split up civilised society into a  few Rothschilds and Vanderbilts, the owners of all the means of  production and subsistence, on the one hand, and an immense number of  wage-workers, the owners of nothing but their labour-force, on the other.  And that this result is caused, not by this or that secondary grievance,  but by the system itself--this fact has been brought out in bold relief  by the development of Capitalism in England since 1847.    Again, the repeated visitations of cholera, typhus, smallpox, and other  epidemics have shown the British bourgeois the urgent necessity of  sanitation in his towns and cities, if he wishes to save himself and  family from falling victims to such diseases.  Accordingly, the most  crying abuses described in this book have either disappeared or have been  made less conspicuous.  Drainage has been introduced or improved, wide  avenues have been opened out athwart many of the worst \"slums\" I had to  describe.  \"Little Ireland\" has disappeared, and the \"Seven Dials\" are  next on the list for sweeping away.  But what of that?  Whole districts  which in 1844 I could describe as almost idyllic, have now, with the  growth of the towns, fallen into the same state of dilapidation,  discomfort, and misery.  Only the pigs and the heaps of refuse are no  longer tolerated.  The bourgeoisie have made further progress in the art  of hiding the distress of the working-class.  But that, in regard to  their dwellings, no substantial improvement has taken place, is amply  proved by the Report of the Royal Commission \"on the Housing of the  Poor,\" 1885.  And this is the case, too, in other respects.  Police  regulations have been plentiful as blackberries; but they can only hedge  in the distress of the workers, they cannot remove it.    But while England has thus outgrown the juvenile state of capitalist  exploitation described by me, other countries have only just attained it.  France, Germany, and especially America, are the formidable competitors  who, at this moment--as foreseen by me in 1844--are more and more  breaking up England's industrial monopoly.  Their manufactures are young  as compared with those of England, but increasing at a far more rapid  rate than the latter; and, curious enough, they have at this moment  arrived at about the same phase of development as English manufacture in  1844.  With regard to America, the parallel is indeed most striking.  True, the external surroundings in which the working-class is placed in  America are very different, but the same economical laws are at work, and  the results, if not identical in every respect, must still be of the same  order.  Hence we find in America the same struggles for a shorter working-  day, for a legal limitation of the working-time, especially of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17309"],[0,"The Summons of the Lord of Hosts (#1)"],[1,"Summons of the Lord of Hosts      by Baha'u'llah          Edition 1, (October 28, 2005)            BAHA'I TERMS OF USE      You have permission to freely make and use copies of the text and any  other information (\"Content\") available on this Site including printing,  emailing, posting, distributing, copying, downloading, uploading,  transmitting, displaying the Content in whole or in part subject to the  following:    1.

CONTENTS      Baha'i Terms of Use  Introduction  Suriy-i-Haykal     Pope Pius IX     Napoleon III     Czar Alexander II     Queen Victoria     Nasiri'd-Din Shah  Suriy-i-Ra'is  Lawh-i-Ra'is  Lawh-i-Fu'ad  Suriy-i-Muluk  NOTE ON THE TRANSLATION  KEY TO PASSAGES TRANSLATED BY SHOGHI EFFENDI              INTRODUCTION      The years following Baha'u'llah's arrival in Adrianople witnessed His  Revelation's attainment, in the words of Shoghi Effendi, of \"its meridian  glory\" through the proclamation of its Founder's message to the kings and  rulers of the world. During this relatively brief but turbulent period of  the Faith's history, and in the early years of His subsequent exile in  1868 to the fortress town of 'Akka, He summoned the monarchs of East and  West collectively, and some among them individually, to recognize the Day  of God and to acknowledge the One promised in the scriptures of the  religions professed by the recipients of His summons. \"Never since the  beginning of the world\", Baha'u'llah declares, \"hath the Message been so  openly proclaimed.\"    The present volume brings together the first full, authorized English  translation of these major writings. Among them is the complete  Suriy-i-Haykal, the Surih of the Temple, one of Baha'u'llah's most  challenging works. It was originally revealed during His banishment to  Adrianople and later recast after His arrival in 'Akka. In this version He  incorporated His messages addressed to individual potentates--Pope Pius IX,  Napoleon III, Czar Alexander II, Queen Victoria, and Nasiri'd-Din Shah.    It was this composite work which, shortly after its completion,  Baha'u'llah instructed be written in the form of a pentacle, symbolizing  the human temple. To it He added, as a conclusion, what Shoghi Effendi has  described as \"words which reveal the importance He attached to those  Messages, and indicate their direct association with the prophecies of the  Old Testament\":          Thus have We built the Temple with the hands of power and might,      could ye but know it. This is the Temple promised unto you in the      Book. Draw ye nigh unto it. This is that which profiteth you,      could ye but comprehend it. Be fair, O peoples of the earth! Which      is preferable, this, or a temple which is built of clay? Set your      faces towards it. Thus have ye been commanded by God, the Help in      Peril, the Self-Subsisting.      During the last years of His ministry Baha'u'llah Himself arranged for the  publication for the first time of definitive versions of some of His  principal works, and the Suriy-i-Haykal was awarded a prominent position  among them.    Of the various writings that make up the Suriy-i-Haykal, one requires  particular mention. The Lawh-i-Sultan, the Tablet to Nasiri'd-Din Shah,  Baha'u'llah's lengthiest epistle to any single sovereign, was revealed in  the weeks immediately preceding His final banishment to 'Akka. It was  eventually delivered to the monarch by Badi', a youth of seventeen, who  had entreated Baha'u'llah for the honour of rendering some service. His  efforts won him the crown of martyrdom and immortalized his name. The  Tablet contains the celebrated passage describing the circumstances in  which the divine call was communicated to Baha'u'llah and the effect it  produced. Here, too, we find His unequivocal offer to meet with the Muslim  clergy, in the presence of the Shah, and to provide whatever proofs of the  new Revelation they might consider to be definitive, a test of spiritual  integrity significantly failed by those who claimed to be the  authoritative trustees of the message of the Qur'an.    Included in this collection, as well, is the first full translation of the  Suriy-i-Muluk or Surih of the Kings, which Shoghi Effendi described as  \"the most momentous Tablet revealed by Baha'u'llah in which He, for the  first time, directs His words collectively to the entire company of the  monarchs of East and West\". It sets forth both the character of His  mission and the standard of justice that must govern the exercise of their  rule in this Day of God:          Lay not aside the fear of God, O kings of the earth, and beware      that ye transgress not the bounds which the Almighty hath fixed.      Observe the injunctions laid upon you in His Book, and take good      heed not to overstep their limits. Be vigilant, that ye may not do      injustice to anyone, be it to the extent of a grain of mustard      seed. Tread ye the path of justice, for this, verily, is the      straight path.      The Tablet introduces some of the great themes that were to figure  prominently in the Writings of Baha'u'llah over the next two and a half  decades: the obligation of those into whose hands God has entrusted civil  authority to institute the reign of justice, the necessity for the  reduction of armaments and the resolution of conflicts among nations, and  an end to the excessive expenditures that were impoverishing these rulers'  subjects.    Surveying the principal contents of Baha'u'llah's majestic call to the  kings and rulers of the world, Shoghi Effendi has written:          The magnitude and diversity of the theme, the cogency of the      argument, the sublimity and audacity of the language, arrest our      attention and astound our minds. Emperors, kings and princes,      chancellors and ministers, the Pope himself, priests, monks and      philosophers, the exponents of learning, parliamentarians and      deputies, the rich ones of the earth, the followers of all      religions, and the people of Baha--all are brought within the      purview of the Author of these Messages, and receive, each      according to their merits, the counsels and admonitions they      deserve. No less amazing is the diversity of the subjects touched      upon in these Tablets. The transcendent majesty and unity of an      unknowable and unapproachable God is extolled, and the oneness of      His Messengers proclaimed and emphasized. The uniqueness, the      universality and potentialities of the Baha'i Faith are stressed,      and the purpose and character of the Babi Revelation unfolded.      The summary draws attention to Baha'u'llah's uncompromising indictment of  the conditions of human society for which its leadership is held primarily  responsible:          Episodes, at once moving and marvellous, at various stages of His      ministry, are recounted, and the transitoriness of worldly pomp,      fame, riches, and sovereignty, repeatedly and categorically      asserted. Appeals for the application of the highest principles in      human and international relations are forcibly and insistently      made, and the abandonment of discreditable practices and      conventions, detrimental to the happiness, the growth, the      prosperity and the unity of the human race, enjoined. Kings are      censured, ecclesiastical dignitaries arraigned, ministers and      plenipotentiaries condemned, and the identification of His advent      with the coming of the Father Himself unequivocally admitted and      repeatedly announced. The violent downfall of a few of these kings      and emperors is prophesied, two of them are definitely challenged,      most are warned, all are appealed to and exhorted.      In a Tablet, the original of which has been lost, Baha'u'llah had already  condemned, in the severest terms, the misrule of the Ottoman Sultan  'Abdu'l-'Aziz. The present volume includes, however, three other Tablets  which address two ministers of the Sultan, whose selfish and unprincipled  influence played an important role in Baha'u'llah's successive  banishments. The Suriy-i-Ra'is, which addresses 'Ali Pasha, the Ottoman  Prime Minister, was revealed in August 1868 as the exiles were being moved  from Adrianople to Gallipoli, and exposes unsparingly the abuse of civil  power the minister had perpetrated. The Lawh-i-Ra'is, which also contains  passages directed to 'Ali Pasha, was revealed shortly after Baha'u'llah's  incarceration in the citadel of 'Akka and includes a chilling denunciation  of the character of the Minister. The third Tablet, the Lawh-i-Fu'ad,  revealed in 1869 shortly after the death of Fu'ad Pasha, the Ottoman  Minister to whose machinations it refers, describes the spiritual  consequences of the abuse of power, and foretells the imminent downfall of  his colleague, 'Ali Pasha, and the overthrow of the Sultan  himself--prophecies that were widely circulated and whose dramatic  fulfilment added greatly to the prestige of their Author.    It seems especially appropriate, as Baha'u'llah's influence penetrates  ever more deeply the life of the larger society throughout the world, that  the full texts of these great Tablets should now be available for a broad  readership.
