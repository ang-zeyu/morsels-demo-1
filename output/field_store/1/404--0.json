The Hermitage, St. Petersburg.]          REMBRANDT    BY    MORTIMER MENPES      WITH AN ESSAY ON THE LIFE AND WORK  OF REMBRANDT    BY    C. LEWIS HIND          LONDON  ADAM AND CHARLES BLACK  1905          PREFACE      Although I am familiar with Rembrandt's work, through photographs and black  and white reproductions, I invariably experience a shock from the colour  standpoint whenever I come in touch with one of his pictures. I was  especially struck with that masterpiece of his at the Hermitage, called the  _Slav Prince_, which, by the way, I am convinced is a portrait of himself;  any one who has had the idea suggested cannot doubt it for a moment; it is  Rembrandt's own face without question. The reproductions I have seen of  this picture, and, in fact, of all Rembrandt's works, are so poor and so  unsatisfactory that I was determined, after my visit to St. Petersburg, to  devise a means by which facsimile reproductions in colour of Rembrandt's  pictures could be set before the public. The black and white reproductions  and the photographs I put on one side at once, because of the impossibility  of suggesting colour thereby.    Rembrandt has been reproduced in photograph and photogravure, and by every  mechanical process imaginable, but all such reproductions are not only  disappointing, but wrong. The light and shade have never been given their  true value, and as for colour, it has scarcely been attempted.    After many years of careful thought and consideration as to the best, or  the only possible, manner of giving to those who love the master a work  which should really be a genuine reproduction of his pictures, I have  adapted and developed the modern process of colour printing, so as to bring  it into sympathy with the subject. For the first time these masterpieces,  with all the rich, deep colouring, can be in the possession of every  one--in the possession of the connoisseur, who knows and loves the  originals but can scarcely ever see them, and in that of the novice, who  hardly knows the emotions familiar to those who have made a study of the  great masters, but is desirous of learning.    At the Hermitage in St. Petersburg I was specially privileged--I was  allowed to study these priceless works with the glass off and in moments of  bright sunlight--to see those sweeps of rich colour, so full, so clear, so  transparent, and broken in places, allowing the undertones to show through.    I myself have made copies of a hundred Rembrandts in order to understand  more completely his method of work. And in copying these pictures certain  qualities have been revealed to me which no one could possibly have learnt  except by this means. Rembrandt worked more or less in two stages: first,  by a carefully-painted monochrome, handled in such a way as to give texture  as well as drawing, and in which the masses of light and shade are defined  in a masterly manner; second, by putting on the rich, golden colour--mostly  in the form of glazes, but with a full brush. This method of handling  glazes over monochrome has given a gem-like quality to Rembrandt's work, so  much so that you might cut out any square inch from any portion of his  pictures and wear it as a jewel. And in all his paintings there is the same  decorative quality that I have before alluded to: any picture by Rembrandt  arrests you as a decorative patch--the grouping and design, and, above all,  the balance of light and shade, are perfect.

Suppose this citizen,  having one day a loose half-hour of time to fill in the neighbourhood of  South Kensington, remembers the articles he has skimmed in the papers about  the Constantine Ionides bequest: suppose he strolls into the Museum and  asks his way of a patient policeman to the Ionides collection. Suppose he  stands before the revolving frame of Rembrandt etchings, idly pushing from  right to left the varied creations of the master, would he be charmed?  would his imagination be stirred? Perhaps so: perhaps not. Perhaps, being a  man of importance in the city, knowing the markets, his eye-brows would  unconsciously elevate themselves, and his lips shape into the position that  produces the polite movement of astonishment, if some one whispered in his  ear--\"At the Holford sale the _Hundred Guilder Print_ fetched L1750, and  _Ephraim Bonus with the Black Ring_, L1950; and M. Edmund de Rothschild  paid L1160 for a first state of the _Dr. A. Tholinx_.\" Those figures might  stimulate his curiosity, but being, as I have said, a golfer, his interest  in Rembrandt would certainly receive a quick impulse when he observed in  the revolving frame the etching No. 683, 2-7/8 inches wide, 5-1/8 inches  high, called _The Sport of Kolef or Golf_.    [Illustration: PORTRAIT OF A WOMAN OF EIGHTY-THREE    1634. National Gallery, London.]    Is it fantastical to assume that his interest in Rembrandt dated from that  little golf etching? Great events ofttimes spring from small causes. We  will follow the Rembrandtish adventures of this citizen of London, and  golfer. Suppose that on his homeward way from the Museum he stopped at a  book shop and bought M. Auguste Breal's small, accomplished book on  Rembrandt. Having read it, and being a man of leisure, means, and grip, he  naturally invested one guinea in the monumental tome of M. Emile Michel,  Member of the Institute of France--that mine of learning about Rembrandt in  which all modern writers on the master delve. Astonishment would be his  companion while reading its packed pages, also while turning the leaves of  _L'Oeuvre de Rembrandt_, decrit et commente, par M. Charles Blanc, de  l'Academie Francaise. This sumptuous folio he picked up second hand and  conveyed home in a cab, because it was too heavy to carry. Now he is fairly  started on his journey through the Rembrandt country, and as he pursues his  way, what is the emotion that dominates him? Amazement, I think.    Let me illustrate the extent and character of his amazement by describing a  little incident that happened to him during a day's golfing at a seaside  course on the following Saturday.    The approach to the sixteenth green is undeniably sporting. Across the  course hangs the shoulder of a hill, and from the fastnesses of the hill a  brook gushes down to the sea through the boulders that bestrew its banks.  Obliged to wait until the preceding couple had holed out, our citizen and  golfer amused himself by upturning one of the great lichen-stained  boulders. He gazed into the dank pit thus disclosed to his eyes, and half  drew back dismayed at the extraordinary activity of insect life that was  revealed. It was so sudden, so unexpected. Beneath that grey and solemn  boulder that Time and man accepted as a freehold tenant of the world, that  our citizen had seen and passed a hundred times, a population of experts  were working, their deeds unseen by the wayfarer. Now what is the meaning  of this little story? How did the discovery of that horde of capable  experts strike the imagination of our golfer? The boulder was Rembrandt.  The busy insects were the learned and patient students working quietly on  his behalf--his discoverers and recoverers. He had passed that boulder a  hundred times, his eyes had rested cursorily upon it as often as the name  of Rembrandt in book or newspaper had met his indifferent gaze. Now he had  raised the boulder, as he had lifted the Rembrandt curtain, and lo! behind  the curtain, as beneath the boulder, he had discovered life miraculously  active.    Reverence for the students of art, for the specialists, for the scientific  historians, was born within him as he pursued his studies in Rembrandt  lore. Also he was conscious of sorrow, anger, and pride: sorrow for the  artist of genius who goes down to his grave neglected, unwept, unhonoured,  and unsung: anger at the stupidity and blindness of his contemporaries:  pride at the unselfish industry and ceaseless activity of the men who, born  years after, raise the master to his throne.    [Illustration: A RABBI SEATED, A STICK IN HIS HANDS AND A HIGH FEATHER IN  HIS CAP    1645. The Hermitage, St. Petersburg.]    In the year 1669 an old Dutchman called Rembrandt dies in obscurity in  Amsterdam. So unmemorable was the death deemed that no contemporary  document makes mention of it. The passing of Rembrandt was simply noted,  baldly and briefly, in the death-register of the Wester Kerk: \"Tuesday,  October 8, 1669; Rembrandt "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1722"],[0,"Martin Luther's Large Catechism, translated (#1)"],[1,"Etext prepared by Rev. Bob Smith <bob_smith@mail.ctsfw.edu>            The Large Catechism by Dr. Martin Luther    Translated by F. Bente and W. H. T. Dau          Published in:  Triglot Concordia: The Symbolical Books of the Ev. Lutheran Church.  St. Louis: Concordia Publishing House, 1921), pp. 565-773    Preface    A Christian, Profitable, and Necessary Preface and Faithful, Earnest  Exhortation of Dr. Martin Luther to All Christians, but Especially to  All Pastors and Preachers, that They Should Daily Exercise Themselves  in the Catechism, which is a Short Summary and Epitome of the Entire  Holy Scriptures, and that they May Always Teach the Same.    We have no slight reasons for treating the Catechism so constantly [in  Sermons] and for both desiring and beseeching others to teach it, since  we see to our sorrow that many pastors and preachers are very negligent  in this, and slight both their office and this teaching; some from  great and high art [giving their mind, as they imagine, to much higher  matters], but others from sheer laziness and care for their paunches,  assuming no other relation to this business than if they were pastors  and preachers for their bellies' sake, and had nothing to do but to  [spend and] consume their emoluments as long as they live, as they have  been accustomed to do under the Papacy.       And although they have now everything that they are to preach and  teach placed before them so abundantly, clearly, and easily, in so many  [excellent and] helpful books, and the true Sermones per se loquentes,  Dormi secure, Paratos et Thesauros, as they were called in former  times; yet they are not so godly and honest as to buy these books, or  even when they have them, to look at them or read them. Alas! they are  altogether shameful gluttons and servants of their own bellies who  ought to be more properly swineherds and dog-tenders than care-takers  of souls and pastors.    And now that they are delivered from the unprofitable and burdensome  babbling of the Seven Canonical Hours, oh, that, instead thereof, they  would only, morning, noon, and evening, read a page or two in the  Catechism, the Prayer-book, the New Testament, or elsewhere in the  Bible, and pray the Lord's Prayer for themselves and their  parishioners, so that they might render, in return, honor and thanks to  the Gospel, by which they have been delivered from burdens and troubles  so manifold, and might feel a little shame because like pigs and dogs  they retain no more of the Gospel than such a lazy, pernicious,  shameful, carnal liberty! For, alas! as it is, the common people regard  the Gospel altogether too lightly, and we accomplish nothing  extraordinary even though we use all diligence. What, then, will be  achieved if we shall be negligent and lazy as we were under the Papacy?      To this there is added the shameful vice and secret infection of  security and satiety, that is, that many regard the Catechism as a  poor, mean teaching, which they can read through at one time, and then  immediately know it, throw the book into a corner, and be ashamed, as  it were, to read in it again.    Yea, even among the nobility there may be found some louts and  scrimps, who declare that there is no longer any need either of  pastors or preachers; that we have everything in books, and every one  can easily learn it by himself; and so they are content to let the  parishes decay and become desolate, and pastors and preachers to suffer  distress and hunger a plenty, just as it becomes crazy Germans to do.  For we Germans have such disgraceful people, and must endure them.    But for myself I say this: I am also a doctor and preacher, yea, as  learned and experienced as all those may be who have such presumption  and security; yet I do as a child who is being taught the Catechism,  and every morning, and whenever I have time, I read and say, word for  word, the Ten Commandments, the Creed, the Lord's Prayer, the Psalms,  etc. And I must still read and study daily, and yet I cannot master it  as I wish, but must remain a child and pupil of the Catechism, and am  glad so to remain. And yet these delicate, fastidious fellows would  with one reading promptly be doctors above all doctors, know everything  and be in need of nothing. Well, this, too, is indeed a sure sign that  they despise both their office and the souls of the people, yea, even  God and His Word. They do not have to fall, they are already fallen all  too horribly, they would need to become children, and begin to learn  their alphabet, which they imagine that they have long since outgrown.    Therefore I beg such lazy paunches or presumptuous saints to be  persuaded and believe for God's sake that they are verily, verily! not  so learned or such great doctors as they imagine; and never to presume  that they have finished learning this [the parts of the Catechism], or  know it well enough in all points, even though they think that they  know it ever so well. For though they should know and understand it  perfectly (which, however, is impossible in this life), yet there are  manifold benefits and fruits still to be obtained, if it be daily read  and practiced in thought and speech; namely, that the Holy Ghost is  present in such reading and repetition and meditation, and bestows ever  new and more light and devoutness, so that it is daily relished and  appreciated better, as Christ promises, Matt. 18, 20: Where two or  three are gathered together in My name, there am I in the midst of  them.    Besides, it is an exceedingly effectual help against the devil, the  world, and the flesh and all evil thoughts to be occupied with the Word  of God, and to speak of it, and meditate upon it, so that the First  Psalm declares those blessed who meditate upon the law of God day and  night. Undoubtedly, you will not start a stronger incense or other  fumigation against the devil than by being engaged upon God's  commandments and words, and speaking, singing, or thinking of them. For  this is indeed the true holy water and holy sign from which he flees,  and by which he may be driven away.    Now, for this reason alone you ought gladly to read, speak, think and  treat of these things if you had no other profit and fruit from them  than that by doing so you can drive away the devil and evil thoughts.  For he cannot hear or endure God's Word; and God's Word is not like  some other silly prattle, as that about Dietrich of Berne, etc., but as  St. Paul says, Rom. 1, 16, the power of God. Yea, indeed, the power of  God which gives the devil burning pain, and strengthens, comforts, and  helps us beyond measure.    And what need is there of many words ? If I were to recount all the  profit and fruit which God's Word produces, whence would I get enough  paper and time? The devil is called the master of a thousand arts. But  what shall we call God's Word, which drives away and brings to naught  this master of a thousand arts with all his arts and power? It must  indeed be the master of more than a hundred thousand arts. And shall we  frivolously despise such power, profit, strength, and fruit -- we,  especially, who claim to be pastors and preachers? If so, we should not  only have nothing given us to eat, but be driven out, being baited with  dogs, and pelted with dung, because we not only need all this every day  as we need our daily bread but must also daily use it against the daily  and unabated attacks and lurking of the devil, the master of a thousand  arts.    And if this were not sufficient to admonish us to read the Catechism  daily, yet we should feel sufficiently constrained by the command of  God alone, who solemnly enjoins in Deut. 6, 6 ff. that we should always  meditate upon His precepts, sitting, walking, standing, Lying down, and  rising, and have them before our eyes and in our hands as a constant  mark and sign. Doubtless He did not so solemnly require and enjoin this  without a purpose; but because He knows our danger and need, as well as  the constant and furious assaults and temptations of devils, He wishes  to warn, equip, and preserve us against them, as with a good armor  against their fiery darts and with good medicine against their evil  infection and suggestion.    Oh, what mad, senseless fools are we that, while we must ever live and  dwell among such mighty enemies as the devils are, we nevertheless  despise our weapons and defense, and are too lazy to look at or think  of them! And what else are such supercilious, presumptuous saints, who  are unwilling to read and study the Catechism daily, doing than  esteeming themselves much more learned than God Himself with all His  saints, angels [patriarchs], prophets, apostles, and all Christians For  inasmuch as God Himself is not ashamed to teach these things daily, as  knowing nothing better to teach, and always keeps teaching the same  thing, and does not take up anything new or different, and all the  saints know nothing better or different to learn, and cannot finish  learning this, are we not the finest of all fellows to imagine, if we  have once read or heard it, that we know it all, and have no further  need to read and learn, but can finish learning in one hour what God  Himself cannot finish teaching, although He is engaged in teaching it  from the beginning to the end of the world, and all prophets, together  with all saints, have been occupied with learning it and have ever  remained pupils, and must continue to be such ?    For it needs must be that whoever knows the Ten Commandments perfectly  must know all the Scriptures, so that, in all affairs and cases, he can  advise, help, comfort, judge, and decide both spiritual and temporal  matters and is qualified to sit in judgment upon all doctrines,  estates, spirits, laws, and whatever else is in the world. And what,  indeed, is the entire Psalter but thoughts and exercises upon the First  Commandment? Now I know of a truth that such lazy"]]]
