It is also thought to be of interest to the  archeologist and ethnologist as well as to the general reader, for it  is well known that no one product of a people's art exhibits so clearly  their mental attitude and their industrial status as the houses which  they build.    Much of the material here presented was obtained some ten years ago,  when the recent changes which have taken place in Navaho life had  only just begun. Although the same processes are now employed in house  construction as formerly, and although the same ceremonies are observed,  they are not so universally nor so strictly adhered to as they were. The  present tendency is such that in a comparatively short time the rules  for the construction of a hogan which have been handed down through  many generations and closely followed, and the elaborate ceremonies of  dedication which formerly were deemed essential to the well-being of the  occupants, will be so far modified as to be no longer recognizable, if,  indeed, they are not altogether abandoned. Such being the case, even a  bare record of the conditions which have prevailed for at least two  centuries must be of value.    As the architecture of a primitive people is influenced largely by the  character of the country in which they live, a brief description of the  Navaho reservation is deemed necessary. Similarly, the habits of life of  the people, what a naturalist would term their life history, which in  combination with the physical environment practically dictates their  arts, is worthy of notice, for without some knowledge of the conditions  under which a people live it is difficult, if not impossible, to obtain  an adequate conception of their art products.    The winter hogans are the real homes of the people, but as the form  and construction of these are dictated by certain rules and a long line  of precedents, supported by a conservatism which is characteristic of  savage life, the summer shelters, which are largely exempt from such  rules, are of considerable interest. Moreover, the effects of modern  conditions and the breaking down of the old ideas should have some place  in a discussion of this kind, if only for the hint afforded as to the  future of the tribe.    The elaborate ceremonies of dedication which in the old days always  followed the construction of a house, and are still practiced, exhibit  almost a new phase of Indian culture. The essentially religious  character of the Indian mind, and his desire to secure for himself and  for his family those benefits which he believes will follow from the  establishment of a perfect understanding with his deities--in other  words, from the rendering of proper homage to benignant deities and the  propitiation of the maleficent ones--are exhibited in these ceremonies.  The sketch of them which is here given, the songs which form a part of  the ceremony, and the native explanations of some of the features will,  it is believed, assist to a better understanding of Indian character.    Finally, the rather full nomenclature of parts and elements of the house  which forms the last section of this memoir will probably be of service  to those who find in language hints and suggestions, or perhaps direct  evidence, of the various steps taken by a people in the course of their  development. As the writer is not competent to discuss the data from  that point of view, it is presented here in this form for the benefit of  those who are. Some suggestions of the derivation of various terms are  given, but only as suggestions.    Much of the material which is comprised in this report was collected by  the late A. M. Stephen, who lived for many years among the Navaho. His  high standing and universal popularity among these Indians gave him  opportunities for the collection of data of this kind which have seldom  been afforded to others. Some of the notes and sketches of Mr Victor  Mindeleff, whose studies of Pueblo architecture are well known, have  been utilized in this report. The author is indebted to Dr Washington  Matthews, the well-known authority on the Navaho Indians, for revising  the spelling of native terms occurring throughout the text.    In the present paper two spellings of the Navaho word for hut are used.  The proper form is _qo[.g]an_, but in and around the Navaho country it  has become an adopted English word under the corrupt form _hogan_. Thus  nearly all the whites in that region pronounce and spell it, and many  of the Indians, to be easily understood by whites, are pronouncing it  lately in the corrupted form. Therefore, wherever the term is employed  as an adopted English word, the form _hogan_ is given, but where it is  used as part of a Navaho phrase or compound word the strictly correct  form _qo[.g]an_ is preserved.    An inverted comma (') following a vowel shows that the vowel is  aspirated.    An inverted comma following _l_ shows that the _l'_ is aspirated in a  peculiar manner--more with the side than with the tip of the tongue.    [ng] represents the nasalized form of _n_.    [.g] represents the Arabic _ghain_.    In other respects the alphabet of the Bureau is followed.      DESCRIPTION OF THE COUNTRY    The Navaho reservation comprises an extensive area in the extreme  northeastern part of Arizona and the northwestern corner of New Mexico  (plate LXXXII). The total area is over 11,000 square miles, of which  about 650 square miles are in New Mexico; but it would be difficult to  find a region of equal size and with an equal population where so large  a proportion of the land is so nearly worthless. This condition has had  an important effect on the people and their arts, and especially on"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18214"],[0,"Our Friend the Dog (#1)"],[1,"Team at http://www.pgdp.net            [Illustration]    OUR FRIEND THE DOG    BY  MAURICE MAETERLINCK    AUTHOR OF \"THE LIFE OF THE BEE,\" ETC.    TRANSLATED BY  ALEXANDER TEIXEIRA DE MATTOS    ILLUSTRATED BY  CECIL ALDEN      NEW YORK  DODD, MEAD & COMPANY    1913    COPYRIGHT, 1903, BY THE CENTURY CO.  COPYRIGHT, 1904, BY DODD, MEAD & COMPANY    Published, October, 1913          OUR FRIEND THE DOG    I      I have lost, within these last few days, a little bull-dog. He had just  completed the sixth month of his brief existence. He had no history. His  intelligent eyes opened to look out upon the world, to love mankind,  then closed again on the cruel secrets of death.    The friend who presented me with him had given him, perhaps by  antiphrasis, the startling name of Pelleas. Why rechristen him? For how  can a poor dog, loving, devoted, faithful, disgrace the name of a man or  an imaginary hero?    Pelleas had a great bulging, powerful forehead, like that of Socrates or  Verlaine; and, under a little black nose, blunt as a churlish assent, a  pair of large hanging and symmetrical chops, which made his head a sort  of massive, obstinate, pensive and three-cornered menace. He was  beautiful after the manner of a beautiful, natural monster that has  complied strictly with the laws of its species. And what a smile of  attentive obligingness, of incorruptible innocence, of affectionate  submission, of boundless gratitude and total self-abandonment lit up, at  the least caress, that adorable mask of ugliness! Whence exactly did  that smile emanate? From the ingenuous and melting eyes? From the ears  pricked up to catch the words of man? From the forehead that unwrinkled  to appreciate and love, or from the stump of a tail that wriggled at the  other end to testify to the intimate and impassioned joy that filled his  small being, happy once more to encounter the hand or the glance of the  god to whom he surrendered himself?    [Illustration]    Pelleas was born in Paris, and I had taken him to the country. His bonny  fat paws, shapeless and not yet stiffened, carried slackly through the  unexplored pathways of his new existence his huge and serious head,  flat-nosed and, as it were, rendered heavy with thought.    For this thankless and rather sad head, like that of an overworked  child, was beginning the overwhelming work that oppresses every brain at  the start of life. He had, in less than five or six weeks, to get into  his mind, taking shape within it, an image and a satisfactory  conception of the universe. Man, aided by all the knowledge of his own  elders and his brothers, takes thirty or forty years to outline that  conception, but the humble dog has to unravel it for himself in a few  days: and yet, in the eyes of a god, who should know all things, would  it not have the same weight and the same value as our own?    It was a question, then, of studying the ground, which can be scratched  and dug up and which sometimes reveals surprising things; of casting at  the sky, which is uninteresting, for there is nothing there to eat, one  glance that does away with it for good and all; of discovering the  grass, the admirable and green grass, the springy and cool grass, a  field for races and sports, a friendly and boundless bed, in which lies  hidden the good and wholesome couch-grass. It was a question, also, of  taking promiscuously a thousand urgent and curious observations. It was  necessary, for instance, with no other guide than pain, to learn to  calculate the height of objects from the top of which you can jump into  space; to convince yourself that it is vain to pursue birds who fly away  and that you are unable to clamber up trees after the cats who defy you  there; to distinguish between the sunny spots where it is delicious to  sleep and the patches of shade in which you shiver; to remark with  stupefaction that the rain does not fall inside the houses, that water  is cold, uninhabitable and dangerous, while fire is beneficent at a  distance, but terrible when you come too near; to observe that the  meadows, the farm-yards and sometimes the roads are haunted by giant  creatures with threatening horns, creatures good-natured, perhaps, and,  at any rate, silent, creatures who allow you to sniff at them a little  curiously without taking offence, but who keep their real thoughts to  themselves. It was necessary to learn, as the result of painful and  humiliating experiment, that you are not at liberty to obey all nature's  laws without distinction in the dwelling of the gods; to recognize that  the kitchen is the privileged and most agreeable spot in that divine  dwelling, although you are hardly allowed to abide in it because of the  cook, who is a considerable, but jealous power; to learn that doors are  important and capricious volitions, which sometimes lead to felicity,  but which most often, hermetically closed, mute and stern, haughty and  heartless, remain deaf to all entreaties; to admit, once and for all,  that the essential good things of life, the indisputable blessings,  generally imprisoned in pots and stewpans, are almost always  inaccessible; to know how to look at them with laboriously-acquired  indifference and to practise to take no notice of them, saying to  yourself that here are objects which are probably sacred, since merely  to skim them with the tip of a respectful tongue is enough to let loose  the unanimous anger of all the gods of the house.    [Illustration]    And then, what is one to think of the table on which so many things  happen that cannot be guessed; of the derisive chairs on which one is  forbidden to sleep; of the plates and dishes that are empty by the  time that one can get at them; of the lamp that drives away the dark?...  How many orders, dangers, prohibitions, problems, enigmas has one not to  classify in one's overburdened memory!... And how to reconcile all this  with other laws, other enigmas, wider and more imperious, which one  bears within one's self, within one's instinct, which spring up and  develop from one hour to the other, which come from the depths of time  and the race, invade the blood, the muscles and the nerves and suddenly  assert themselves more irresistibly and more powerfully than pain, the  word of the master himself, or the fear of death?    Thus, for instance, to quote only one example, when the hour of sleep  has struck for men, you have retired to your hole, surrounded by the  darkness, the silence and the formidable solitude of the night. All is  sleep in the master's house. You feel yourself very small and weak in  the presence of the mystery. You know that the gloom is peopled with  foes who hover and lie in wait. You suspect the trees, the passing wind  and the moonbeams. You would like to hide, to suppress yourself by  holding your breath. But still the watch must be kept; you must, at the  least sound, issue from your retreat, face the invisible and bluntly  disturb the imposing silence of the earth, at the risk of bringing down  the whispering evil or crime upon yourself alone. Whoever the enemy be,  even if he be man, that is to say, the very brother of the god whom it  is your business to defend, you must attack him blindly, fly at his  throat, fasten your perhaps sacrilegious teeth into human flesh,  disregard the spell of a hand and voice similar to those of your master,  never be silent, never attempt to escape, never allow yourself to be  tempted or bribed and, lost in the night without help, prolong the  heroic alarm to your last breath.    There is the great ancestral duty, the essential duty, stronger than  death, which not even man's will and anger are able to check. All our  humble history, linked with that of the dog in our first struggles  against every breathing thing, tends to prevent his forgetting it. And  when, in our safer dwelling-places of to-day, we happen to punish him  for his untimely zeal, he throws us a glance of astonished reproach, as  though to point out to us that we are in the wrong and that, if we lose  sight of the main clause in the treaty of alliance which he made with us  at the time when we lived in caves, forests and fens, he continues  faithful to it in spite of us and remains nearer to the eternal truth of  life, which is full of snares and hostile forces.    But how much care and study are needed to succeed in fulfilling this  duty! And how complicated it has become since the days of the silent  caverns and the great deserted lakes! It was all so simple, then, so  easy and so clear. The lonely hollow opened upon the side of the hill,  and all that approached, all that moved on the horizon of the plains or  woods, was the unmistakable enemy.... But to-day you can no longer  tell.... You have to acquaint yourself with a civilization of which you  disapprove, to appear to understand a thousand incomprehensible  things.... Thus, it seems evident that henceforth the whole world no  longer belongs to the master, that his property conforms to  unintelligible limits.... It becomes necessary, therefore, first of all  to know exactly where the sacred domain begins and ends. Whom are you to  suffer, whom to stop?... There is the road by which every one, even the  poor, has the right to pass. Why? You do not know; it is a fact which  you deplore, but which you are bound to accept. Fortunately, on the  other hand, here is the fair path which none may tread. This path is  faithful to the sound traditions; it is not to be lost sight of; for by  it enter into your daily existence the difficult problems of life.    Would you have an example? You are sleeping peacefully in a ray of the  sun that covers the threshold of the kitchen with pearls. The  earthenware pots are amusing themselves by elbowing and nudging one  another on the edge of the shelves trimmed with paper lace-work. The  copper stewpans play at scattering spots of light over the smooth white  walls. The motherly stove"]]]
