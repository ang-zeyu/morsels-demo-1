ILIAD.]            INTRODUCTION      No man since Washington has become to Americans so familiar or so  beloved a figure as Abraham Lincoln. He is to them the representative  and typical American, the man who best embodies the political ideals of  the nation. He is typical in the fact that he sprang from the masses of  the people, that he remained through his whole career a man of the  people, that his chief desire was to be in accord with the beliefs and  wishes of the people, that he never failed to trust in the people and to  rely on their support. Every native American knows his life and his  speeches. His anecdotes and witticisms have passed into the thought and  the conversation of the whole nation as those of no other statesman have  done.    He belongs, however, not only to the United States, but to the whole of  civilized mankind. It is no exaggeration to say that he has, within the  last thirty years, grown to be a conspicuous figure in the history of  the modern world. Without him, the course of events not only in the  Western hemisphere but in Europe also would have been different, for he  was called to guide at the greatest crisis of its fate a State already  mighty, and now far more mighty than in his days, and the guidance he  gave has affected the march of events ever since. A life and a character  such as his ought to be known to and comprehended by Europeans as well  as by Americans. Among Europeans, it is especially Englishmen who ought  to appreciate him and understand the significance of his life, for he  came of an English stock, he spoke the English tongue, his action told  upon the progress of events and the shaping of opinion in all British  communities everywhere more than it has done upon any other nation  outside America itself.    This collection of Lincoln's speeches seeks to make him known by  his words as readers of history know him by his deeds. In  popularly-governed countries the great statesman is almost of necessity  an orator, though his eminence as a speaker may be no true measure  either of his momentary power or of his permanent fame, for wisdom,  courage and tact bear little direct relation to the gift for speech. But  whether that gift be present in greater or in lesser degree, the  character and ideas of a statesman are best studied through his own  words. This is particularly true of Lincoln, because he was not what may  be called a professional orator. There have been famous orators whose  speeches we may read for the beauty of their language or for the wealth  of ideas they contain, with comparatively little regard to the  circumstances of time and place that led to their being delivered.  Lincoln is not one of these. His speeches need to be studied in close  relation to the occasions which called them forth. They are not  philosophical lucubrations or brilliant displays of rhetoric. They are a  part of his life. They are the expression of his convictions, and derive  no small part of their weight and dignity from the fact that they deal  with grave and urgent questions, and express the spirit in which he  approached those questions. Few great characters stand out so clearly  revealed by their words, whether spoken or written, as he does.    Accordingly Lincoln's discourses are not like those of nearly all the  men whose eloquence has won them fame. When we think of such men as  Pericles, Demosthenes, AEschines, Cicero, Hortensius, Burke, Sheridan,  Erskine, Canning, Webster, Gladstone, Bright, Massillon, Vergniaud,  Castelar, we think of exuberance of ideas or of phrases, of a command of  appropriate similes or metaphors, of the gifts of invention and of  exposition, of imaginative flights, or outbursts of passion fit to stir  and rouse an audience to like passion. We think of the orator as gifted  with a powerful or finely-modulated voice, an imposing presence, a  graceful delivery. Or if--remembering that Lincoln was by profession a  lawyer and practised until he became President of the United States--we  think of the special gifts which mark the forensic orator, we should  expect to find a man full of ingenuity and subtlety, one dexterous in  handling his case in such wise as to please and capture the judge or the  jury whom he addresses, one skilled in those rhetorical devices and  strokes of art which can be used, when need be, to engage the listener's  feelings and distract his mind from the real merits of the issue.    Of all this kind of talent there was in Lincoln but little. He was not  an artful pleader; indeed, it was said of him that he could argue well  only those cases in the justice of which he personally believed, and was  unable to make the worse appear the better reason. For most of the  qualities which the world admires in Cicero or in Burke we should look  in vain in Lincoln's speeches. They are not fine pieces of exquisite  diction, fit to be declaimed as school exercises or set before students  as models of composition.    What, then, are their merits? and why do they deserve to be valued and  remembered? How comes it that a man of first-rate powers was deficient  in qualities appertaining to his own profession which men less  remarkable have possessed?    To answer this question, let us first ask what were the preparation and  training Abraham Lincoln had for oratory, whether political or forensic.    Born in rude and abject poverty, he had never any education, except what  he gave himself, till he was approaching manhood. Not even books  wherewith to inform and train his mind were within his reach. No school,  no university, no legal faculty had any part in training his powers.  When he became a lawyer and a politician, the years most favourable to  continuous study had already passed, and the opportunities he found for  reading were very scanty. He knew but few authors in general literature,  though he knew those few thoroughly. He taught himself a little  mathematics, but he could read no language save his own, and can have  had only the faintest acquaintance with European history or with any  branch of philosophy.    The want of regular education was not made up for by the persons among  whom his lot was cast. Till he was a grown man, he never moved in any  society from which he could learn those things with which the mind of an  orator or a statesman ought to be stored. Even after he had gained some  legal practice, there was for many years no one for him to mix with  except the petty practitioners of a petty town, men nearly all of whom  knew little more than he did himself.    Schools gave him nothing, and society gave him nothing. But he had a  powerful intellect and a resolute will. Isolation fostered not only  self-reliance but the habit of reflection, and, indeed, of prolonged and  intense reflection. He made all that he knew a part of himself. He  thought everything out for himself. His convictions were his own--clear  and coherent. He was not positive or opinionated, and he did not deny  that at certain moments he pondered and hesitated long before he decided  on his course. But though he could keep a policy in suspense, waiting  for events to guide him, he did not waver. He paused and reconsidered,  but it was never his way either to go back upon a decision once made, or  to waste time in vain regrets that all he expected had not been  attained. He took advice readily, and left many things to his ministers;  but he did not lean upon his advisers. Without vanity or ostentation, he  was always independent, self-contained, prepared to take full  responsibility for his acts.    That he was keenly observant of all that passed under his eyes, that his  mind played freely round everything it touched, we know from the  accounts of his talk, which first made him famous in the town and  neighbourhood where he lived. His humour, and his memory for anecdotes  which he could bring out to good purpose, at the right moment, are  qualities which Europe deems distinctively American, but no great man of  action in the nineteenth century, even in America, possessed them in the  same measure. Seldom has so acute a power of observation been found  united to so abundant a power of sympathy.    These remarks may seem to belong to a study of his character rather than  of his speeches, yet they are not irrelevant, because the interest of  his speeches lies in their revelation of his character. Let us, however,  return to the speeches and to the letters, some of which, given in this  volume, are scarcely less noteworthy than are the speeches.    What are the distinctive merits of these speeches and letters? There is  less humour in them than his reputation as a humorist would have led us  to expect. They are serious, grave, practical. We feel that the man does  not care to play over the surface of the subject, or to use it as a way  of displaying his cleverness. He is trying to get right down to the very  foundation of the matter and tell us what his real thoughts about it  are. In this respect he sometimes reminds us of Bismarck's speeches,  which, in their rude, broken, forth-darting way, always go straight to  their destined aim; always hit the nail on the head. So too, in their  effort to grapple with fundamental facts, Lincoln's bear a sort of  likeness to Cromwell's speeches, though Cromwell has far less power of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14742"],[0,"Vanishing England (#1)"],[1,"Note: Project Gutenberg also has an HTML version of this        file which includes the original illustrations.

We wish  to describe with pen and pencil those features of England which are  gradually disappearing, and to preserve the memory of them. It may be  said that we have begun our quest too late; that so much has already  vanished that it is hardly worth while to record what is left.  Although much has gone, there is still, however, much remaining that  is good, that reveals the artistic skill and taste of our forefathers,  and recalls the wonders of old-time. It will be our endeavour to tell  of the old country houses that Time has spared, the cottages that  grace the village green, the stern grey walls that still guard some  few of our towns, the old moot halls and public buildings. We shall  see the old-time farmers and rustics gathering together at fair and  market, their games and sports and merry-makings, and whatever relics  of old English life have been left for an artist and scribe of the  twentieth century to record.    Our age is an age of progress. _Altiora peto_ is its motto. The spirit  of progress is in the air, and lures its votaries on to higher  flights. Sometimes they discover that they have been following a mere  will-o'-the-wisp, that leads them into bog and quagmire whence no  escape is possible. The England of a century, or even of half a  century ago, has vanished, and we "]]]
