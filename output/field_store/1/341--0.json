This book, such as it is, is dedicated to the man whose kindliness of heart  and generous journalistic instincts lifted me from the unknown, and placed  me where I had a chance to battle with the best men in my profession. He  was the man who found Archibald Forbes, the most brilliant, accurate, and  entertaining of all war correspondents. What he did for that splendid  genius let Forbes' memoirs tell; what he did for me I will tell myself. He  gave me the chance I had looked for for twenty years, and the dearest name  in my memory to-day is the name of                        SIR JOHN ROBINSON,                Manager of the _Daily News_, London.

We grow weary waiting, England,              For the summons that never comes--            For the blast of the British bugles              And the throb of the British drums.            Our hearts grow sore and sullen              As year by year rolls by,            And your cold, contemptuous actions              Give your fervent words the lie.              Are we only an English market,              Held dear for the sake of trade?            Or are we a part of the Empire,              Close welded as hilt and blade?            If we are to cleave together              As mother and son through life,            Give us our share of the burden,              Let us stand with you in the strife.              If we are to share your glory,              Let the sons whom the South has bred            Lie side by side on your battlefields              With England's heroes dead.            A nation is never a nation              Worthy of pride or place            Till the mothers have sent their firstborn              To look death on the field in the face.

If so, let us share your dangers,              Let the glory we boast be real,            Let the boys of the South fight with you,              Let our children taste cold steel.              Do you think we are chicken-hearted?              Do you count us devoid of pride?            Just try us in deadly earnest,              And see how our boys can ride.            We are sick of your empty praises!              If the mother is proud of her son,            Let him do some deed on a hard-fought field,              Then boast what he has done.

Australia is calling to England,              Let England answer the call;            There are smiles for those who come back to us,              And tears for those who may fall.              Bridle to bridle our sons will ride              With the best that Britain has bred,            And all we ask is an open field              And a soldier's grave for our dead.        I have decided to enclose these verses in my book because some critics            have pronounced me anti-English in my sentiments. Heaven alone            knows why; yet the above poem was written and published by me in            Australia just before war was declared between England and the            Republics, at a time when all Australia considered it very            probable that we should have to fight one of the big European            Powers as well as the Boers.                                                                    A. G. HALES.                                      AUSTRALIA ON THE MARCH.                                                           BELMONT BATTLEFIELD.      At two o'clock on the morning of Wednesday, the 6th of the month, the  reveille sounded, and the Australians commenced their preparations for the  march to join Methuen's army. By 4 a.m. the mounted rifles led the way out  of camp, and the toilsome march over rough and rocky ground commenced. The  country was terribly rough as we drove the transports up and over the  Orange River, and rougher still in the low kopjes on the other side. The  heat was simply blistering, but the Australians did not seem to mind it to  any great extent; they were simply feverish to get on to the front, but  they had to hang back and guard the transports.    At last the hilly country faded behind us. We counted upon pushing on  rapidly, but the African mules were a sorry lot, and could make but little  headway in the sandy tracks. Still, there was no rest for the men, because  at intervals one of Remington's scouts would turn up at a flying gallop,  springing apparently from nowhere, out of the womb of the wilderness, to  inform us that flying squads of Boers were hanging round us. But so  carefully watchful were the Remingtons that the Boers had no chance of  surprising us. No sooner did the scouts inform us of their approach in any  direction than our rifles swung forward ready to give them a hearty  Australian reception. This made the march long and toilsome, though we  never had a chance to fire a shot. At 5.30 we marched with all our  transports into Witteput, the wretched little mules being the only  distressed portion of the contingent.    At Witteput the news reached us that a large party of the enemy had managed  to pass between General Methuen's men and ourselves, and had invested  Belmont, out of which place the British troops had driven them a few weeks  previously. We had no authentic news concerning this movement. Our  contingent spread out on the hot sand at Witteput, panting for a drop of  rain from the lowering clouds that hung heavily overhead. Yet hot, tired,  and thirsty as we were, we yet found time to look with wonder at the sky  above us. The men from the land of the Southern Cross are used to gorgeous  sunsets, but never had we looked upon anything like this. Great masses of  coal-black clouds frowned down upon us, flanked by fiery crimson cloud  banks, that looked as if they would rain blood, whilst the atmosphere was  dense enough to half-stifle one. Now and again the thunder rolled out  majestically, and the lightning flashed from the black clouds into the red,  like bayonets through smoke banks.    Yet we had not long to wait and watch, for within half an hour after our  arrival the Colonel galloped down into our midst just as the evening ration  was being given out. He held a telegram aloft, and the stillness that fell  over the camp was so deep that each man could hear his neighbour's heart  beat. Then the Colonel's voice cut the stillness like a bugle call. \"Men,  we are needed at Belmont; the Boers are there in force, and we have been  sent for to relieve the place. I'll want you in less than two hours.\" It  was then the men showed their mettle. Up to their feet they leapt like one  man, and they gave the Colonel a cheer that made the sullen, halting mules  kick in their harness. \"We are ready now, Colonel, we'll eat as we march,\"  and the \"old man\" smiled, and gave the order to fall in, and they fell in,  and as darkness closed upon the land they marched out of Witteput to the  music of the falling rain and the thunder of heaven's artillery.    All night long it was march, halt, and \"Bear a hand, men,\" for those thrice  accursed mules failed us at every pinch. In vain the niggers plied the  whips of green hide, vain their shouts of encouragement, or painfully  shrill anathemas; the mules had the whip hand of us, and they kept it. But,  in spite of it all, in the chilly dawn of the African morning, our fellows,  with their shoulders well back, and heads held high, marched into Belmont,  with every man"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16134"],[0,"The First Christmas Tree: A Story of the Forest (#1)"],[1,"Note: Project Gutenberg also has an HTML version of this        file which includes the original illustrations.

Then Winfried told the story of Bethlehem . . .        I  THE CALL OF THE WOODSMAN      I    The day before Christmas, in the year of our Lord 722.    Broad snow-meadows glistening white along the banks of the river  Moselle; pallid hill-sides blooming with mystic roses where the  glow of the setting sun still lingered upon them; an arch of  clearest, faintest azure bending overhead; in the center of the  aerial landscape of the massive walls of the cloister of Pfalzel,  gray to the east, purple to the west; silence over all,--a  gentle, eager, conscious stillness, diffused through the air like  perfume, as if earth and sky were hushing themselves to hear the  voice of the river faintly murmuring down the valley.    In the cloister, too, there was silence at the sunset hour. All  day long there had been a strange and joyful stir among the nuns.  A breeze of curiosity and excitement had swept along the  corridors and through every quiet cell.    The elder sisters,--the provost, the deaconess, the stewardess,  the portress with her huge bunch of keys jingling at her  girdle,--had been hurrying to and fro, busied with household  cares. In the huge kitchen there was a bustle of hospitable  preparation. The little bandy-legged dogs that kept the spits  turning before the fires had been trotting steadily for many an  hour, until their tongues hung out for want of breath. The big  black pots swinging from the cranes had bubbled and gurgled and  shaken and sent out puffs of appetizing steam.    St. Martha was in her element. It was a field-day for her  virtues.    The younger sisters, the pupils of the convent, had forsaken  their Latin books and their embroidery-frames, their manuscripts  and their miniatures, and fluttered through the halls in little  flocks like merry snow-birds, all in black and white, chattering  and whispering together. This was no day for tedious task-work,  no day for grammar or arithmetic, no day for picking out  illuminated letters in red and gold on stiff parchment, or  patiently chasing intricate patterns over thick cloth with the  slow needle. It was a holiday. A famous visitor had come to the  convent.    It was Winfried of England, whose name in the Roman tongue was  Boniface, and whom men called the Apostle of Germany. A great  preacher; a wonderful scholar; he had written a Latin grammar  himself,--think of it,--and he could hardly sleep without a book  under his pillow; but, more than all, a great and daring  traveller, a venturesome pilgrim, a high-priest of romance.    He had left his home and his fair estate in Wessex; he would not  stay in the rich monastery of Nutescelle, even though they had  chosen him as the abbot; he had refused a bishopric at the court  of King Karl. Nothing would content him but to go out into the  wild woods and preach to the heathen.    Up and down through the forests of Hesse and Thuringia, and along  the borders of Saxony, he had wandered for years, with a handful  of companions, sleeping under the trees, crossing mountains and  marshes, now here, now there, never satisfied with ease and  comfort, always in love with hardship and danger.    What a man he was! Fair and slight, but straight as a spear and  strong as an oaken staff. His face was still young; the smooth  skin was bronzed by wing and sun. His gray eyes, clear and kind,  flashed like fire when he spoke of his adventures, and of the evil  deeds of the false priests with whom he had contended.    What tales he had told that day! Not of miracles wrought by sacred  relics; nor of courts and councils and splendid cathedrals; though  he knew much of these things, and had been at Rome and received  the Pope's blessing. But to-day he had spoken of long journeyings  by sea and land; of perils by fire and flood; of wolves and bears  and fierce snowstorms and black nights in the lonely forest; of  dark altars of heaven gods, and weird, bloody sacrifices, and  narrow escapes from wandering savages.    The little novices had gathered around him, and their faces had  grown pale and their eyes bright as they listened with parted  lips, entranced in admiration, twining their arms about one  another's shoulders and holding closely together, half in fear,  half in delight. The older nuns had turned from their tasks and  paused, in passing by, to hear the pilgrim's story. Too well they  knew the truth of what he spoke. Many a one among them had seen  the smoke rising from the ruins of her father's roof. Many a one  had a brother far away in the wild country to whom her heart went  out night and day, wondering if he were still among the living.    But now the excitements of that wonderful day were over; the hours  of the evening meal had come; the inmates of the cloister were  assembled in the refectory.    On the dais sat the stately Abbess Addula, daughter of King  Dagobert, looking a princess indeed, in her violet tunic, with the  hood and cuffs of her long white robe trimmed with fur, and a  snowy veil resting like a crown on her snowy hair. At her right  hand was the honoured guest, and at her left hand her grandson,  the young Prince Gregor, a big, manly boy, just returned from  school.    The long, shadowy hall, with its dark-brown raters and beams; the  double rows of nuns, with their pure veils and fair faces; the  ruddy flow of the slanting sunbeams striking upwards through the  tops of the windows and painting a pink glow high up on the  walls,--it was all as beautiful as a picture, and as silent. For  this was the rule of the cloister, that at the table all should  sit in stillness for a little while, and then one should read  aloud, while the rest listened.    \"It is the turn of my grandson to read to-day,\" said the abbess to  Winfried; \"we shall see how much he has learned in the school.  Read, Gregor; the place in the book is marked.\"    The tall lad rose from his seat and turned the pages of the  manuscript. It was a copy of Jerome's version of the Scriptures in  Latin, and the marked place was in the letter of St. Paul to the  Ephesians,--the passage where he describes the preparation of the  Christian as the arming of a warrior for glorious battle. The  young voice rang out clearly, rolling the sonorous words, without  slip or stumbling, to the end of the chapter.    Winfried listened, smiling. \"My son,\" said he, as the reader  paused, \"that was bravely read. Understandest thou what thou  readest?\"    \"Surely, father,\" answered the boy; \"it was taught me by the  masters at Treves; and we have read this epistle clear through,  from beginning to end, so that I almost know it by heart.\"    Then he began again to repeat the passage, turning away from the  page as if to show his skill.    But Winfried stopped him with a friendly lifting of the hand.    \"No so, my son; that was not my meaning. When we pray, we speak to  God; when we read, it is God who speaks to us. I ask whether thou  hast heard what He has said to thee, in thine own words, in the  common speech. Come, give us again the message of the warrior and  his armour and his battle, in the mother-tongue, so that all can  understand it.\"    The boy hesitated, blushed, stammered; then he came around to  Winfried's seat, bringing the book. \"Take the book, my father,\" he  cried, \"and read it for me. I cannot see the meaning plain, though  I love the sound of the words. Religion I know, and the doctrines  of our faith, and the life of priests and nuns in the cloister,  for which my grandmother designs me, though it likes me little.  And fighting I know, and the life of warriors and heroes, for I  have read of it in Virgil and the ancients, and heard a bit from  the soldiers at Treves; and I would fain taste more of it, for it  likes me much. But how the two lives fit together, or what need  there is of armour for a clerk in holy orders, I can never see.  Tell me the meaning, for if there is a man in all the world that  knows it, I am sure it is none other than thou.\"    So Winfried took the book and closed it, clasping the boy's hand  with his own.    \"Let us first dismiss the others to their vespers,\" said he, \"lest  they should be weary.\"    A sign from the abbess; a chanted benediction; a murmuring of  sweet voices and a soft rustling of many feet over the rushes on  the floor; the gentle tide of noise flowed out through the doors  and ebbed away down the corridors; the three at the head of the  table were left alone in the darkening room.    Then Winfried began to translate the parable of the soldier into  the realities of life.    At every turn he knew how to flash a new light into the picture  out of his own experience. He spoke of the combat with self, and  of the wrestling with dark spirits in solitude. He spoke of the  demons that men had worshipped for centuries in the wilderness,  and whose malice they invoked against the stranger who ventured  into the gloomy forest. Gods, they called them, and told strange  tales of their dwelling"]]]
