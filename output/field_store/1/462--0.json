PREFACE      This little book tries to tell the story of the religious life of the  Romans from the time when their history begins for us until the close of  the reign of Augustus. Each of its five essays deals with a distinct  period and is in a sense complete in itself; but the dramatic  development inherent in the whole forbids their separation save as acts  or chapters. In spite of modern interest in the study of religion, Roman  religion has been in general relegated to specialists in ancient history  and classics. This is not surprising for Roman religion is not  prepossessing in appearance, but though it is at first sight  incomparably less attractive than Greek religion, it is, if properly  understood, fully as interesting, nay, even more so. In Mr. W. Warde  Fowler's _Roman Festivals_ however the subject was presented in all its  attractiveness, and if the present book shall serve as a simple  introduction to his larger work, its purpose will have been fulfilled.    No one can write of Roman religion without being almost inestimably  indebted to Georg Wissowa whose _Religion und Cultus der Roemer_ is the  best systematic presentation of the subject. It was the author's  privilege to be Wissowa's pupil, and much that is in this book is  directly owing to him, and even the ideas that are new, if there are any  good ones, are only the bread which he cast upon the waters returning to  him after many days.    The careful student of the history of the Romans cannot doubt the  psychological reality of their religion, no matter what his personal  metaphysics may be. It is the author's hope that these essays may have a  human interest because he has tried to emphasise this reality and to  present the Romans as men of like passions to ourselves, in spite of all  differences of time and race.    Hearty thanks are due to Mr. W. Warde Fowler and to Mr. Albert W. Van  Buren for their great kindness in reading the proofs; and the dedication  of the book is at best a poor return for the help which my wife has  given me.                               J.B.C.

In the middle of  the five centuries of her republic came the Punic wars and the intimate  association with Greece which made the last half of her history as a  republic so different from the first half; and in the kingdom, which  preceded the republic, there was a similar coming of foreign influence,  which made the later kingdom with its semi-historical names of the  Tarquins and Servius Tullius so different from the earlier kingdom with  its altogether legendary Romulus, Numa, Tullus Hostilius and Ancus  Martius. We have thus four distinct phases in the history of Roman  society, and a corresponding phase of religion in each period; and if we  add to this that new social structure which came into being by the  reforms of Augustus at the beginning of the empire, together with the  religious changes which accompanied it, we shall have the five periods  which these five essays try to describe: the period before the  Tarquins, that is the \"Religion of Numa\"; the later kingdom, that is the  \"Reorganisation of Servius\"; the first three centuries of the republic,  that is the \"Coming of the Sibyl\"; the closing centuries of the  republic, that is the \"Decline of Faith\"; and finally the early empire  and the \"Augustan Renaissance.\" Like all attempts to cut history into  sections these divisions are more or less arbitrary, but their  convenience sufficiently justifies their creation. They must be thought  of however not as representing independent blocks, arbitrarily arranged  in a certain consecutive order, not as five successive religious  consciousnesses, but merely as marking the entrance of certain new ideas  into the continuous religious consciousness of the Roman people. The  history of each of these periods is simply the record of the change  which new social conditions produced in that great barometer of society,  the religious consciousness of the community. It is in the period of the  old kingdom that our story begins.    At first sight it may seem a foolish thing to try to draw a picture of  the religious condition of a time about the political history of which  we know so little, and it is only right therefore that we should inquire  what sources of knowledge we possess.    There was a time, not so very long ago, when under the banner of the  new-born science of \"Comparative Philology\" there gathered together a  group of men who thought they held the key to prehistoric history, and  that words themselves would tell the story where ancient monuments and  literature were silent. It was a great and beautiful thought, and the  science which encouraged it has taken its place as a useful and  reputable member of the community of sciences, but its pretensions to  the throne of the revealer of mysteries have been withdrawn by those who  are its most ardent followers, and the \"Indo-Germanic religion\" which is  brought into being is a pleasant thought for an idle hour rather than a  foundation and starting-point for the study of ancient religion in  general. Altogether aside from the fact that although primitive religion  and nationality are in the main identical, language and nationality are  by no means so--we have the great practical difficulty in the case of  Greece and Rome that in the earliest period of which we have knowledge  these two religions bear so little resemblance that we must either  assert for the time of Indo-Germanic unity a religious development much  more primitive than that which comparative philology has sketched, or we  must suppose the presence of a strong decadent influence in Rome's case  after the separation, which is equally difficult. If we realise that in  a primitive religion the name of the god is usually the same as the name  of the thing which he represents, the existence of a Greek god and a  Roman god with names which correspond to the same Indo-Germanic word  proves linguistically that the _thing_ existed and had a name before the  separation, but not at all that the thing was deified or that the name  was the name of a god at that time. We must therefore be content to  begin our study of religion much more humbly and at a much later period.    In fact we cannot go back appreciably before the dawn of political  history, but there are certain considerations which enable us at least  to understand the phenomena of the dawn itself, those survivals in  culture which loom up in the twilight and the understanding of which  gives us a fair start in our historical development. For this knowledge  we are indebted to the so-called \"anthropological\" method, which is  based on the assumption that mankind is essentially uniform, and that  this essential uniformity justifies us in drawing inferences about very  ancient thought from the very primitive thought of the barbarous and  savage peoples of our own day. At first sight the weakness of this  contention is more apparent than its strength, and it is easy to show  that the prehistoric primitive culture of a people destined to  civilisation is one thing, and the retarded primitive culture of modern  tribes stunted in their growth is quite another thing, so that, as has  so often been said, the two bear a relation to each other not unlike  that of a healthy young child to a full-grown idiot. And yet there is a  decided resemblance between the child and the idiot, and whether  prehistoric or retarded, primitive culture shows everywhere strong  likeness, and the method is productive of good if we confine our  reasoning backwards to those things in savage life which the two kinds  of primitive culture, the prehistoric and the retarded, have in common.  To do this however we must have some knowledge of the prehistoric, and  our modern retarded savage must be used merely to illumine certain  things which we see only in half-light; he must never be employed as a  lay-figure in sketching in those features of prehistoric life of which  we are totally in ignorance. It is peculiarly useful to the student of  Roman religion because he stands on the borderland and looking backwards  sees just enough dark shapes looming up behind him to crave more light.  For in many phases of early Roman religion there are present  characteristics which go back to old manners of thought, and these  manners of thought are not peculiar to the Romans but are found in many  primitive peoples of our own day. The greatest contribution which  anthropology has made to the study of early Roman religion is \"animism.\"    Not much more than a quarter of a century ago the word \"animism\" began  to be used to describe that particular phase of the psychological  condition of primitive peoples by which they believe that a spirit  (_anima_) resides in everything, material and immaterial. This spirit is  generally closely associated with the thing itself, sometimes actually  identified with it. When it is thought of as distinct from the thing, it  is supposed to have the form of the thing, to be in a word its \"double.\"  These doubles exercise an influence, often for evil, over the thing, and  it is expedient and necessary therefore that they should be propitiated "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18223"],[0,"The Essence of Buddhism (#1)"],[1,"the Online Distributed Proofreading Team at  http://www.pgdp.net                                        TEN CENT POCKET SERIES NO. 325                         Edited by E.

Haldeman-Julius Company.          PREFACE.      I am glad to be permitted thus to say, in a few words of introduction  to this well-meditated little volume, how pleasant and how profitable  an idea it must be considered to have designed and compiled a Buddhist  anthology. Selecting his cut and uncut jewels from very various  Buddhistic sources, Mr. Bowden has here supplied those who buy and use  the book with rubies and sapphires and emeralds of wisdom, compassion,  and human brotherhood, any one of which, worn on the heart, would be  sufficient to make the wearer rich beyond estimation for a day. The  author disclaims any attempt to set forth a corpus of Buddhistic  morality and doctrine, nor, indeed, would anything of the kind be  possible within such narrow limits; but I rejoice to observe how well  and faithfully his manifold extracts from the Sacred Books of India  and the East exhibit that ever-pervading tenderness of the great  Asiatic Teacher, which extended itself to all alike that live. This  compassionateness of Gautama, if nothing else had been illustrated by  the collection, would render it precious to possess and fruitful to  employ; but many another lofty tenet of the \"Light\" of Asia finds  illumination in some brief verse or maxim as day after day glides by;  and he who should mark the passage of the months with these simple  pages must become, I think, a better man at the year's end than at  its beginning. I recommend this compilation without hesitation or  reserve.    EDWIN ARNOLD.          COMPILER'S PROEM.    E. M. BOWDEN.      In this compilation no attempt has been made to present a general view  of Buddhism as a religious or philosophical system. The aim has rather  been to turn Buddhism to account as a moral force by bringing together  a selection of its beautiful sentiments, and lofty maxims, and  particularly including some of those which inculcate mercy to the  lower animals.    On this point a far higher stand is taken by Buddhism than by  Christianity--or at any rate than by Christianity as understood and  interpreted by those who ought to know. Not only is the whole question  of our duties to the lower animals commonly ignored in Christian works  as, for instance, in the famous Imitation of Christ, and scores of  others; but, as if this were not enough, a reasoned attempt has  actually been made, on the strength of Christian teaching, to explode  the notion that animals have any right (e.g., in Moral Philosophy, by  Father Joseph Rickaby). Very different in this respect is the tone of  the average Buddhist treatise, with its earnest exhortations,  recurring as a matter of course, to show mercy on every living thing;  and this difference alone is an adequate reason for compiling a  Buddhist anthology.    In regard to the sources quoted from, considerable latitude seemed  allowable. They do not all, by any means, possess canonical authority.  But they are all distinctly Buddhist in character. The supposed dates  of the originals range from at least the third century B. C. to  medieval and later times.    Hence, it is clear that, should any one think to make use of  quotations from this work for controversial purposes, a certain degree  of caution will be necessary. The context of the passage, and the date  and the authorship of the original work, may all need to be taken into  account; while it must also be borne in mind that the religious terms,  such as \"heaven\" and \"sin,\" which have to be employed in English, do  not always correspond exactly to the Buddhist conception.    Of the numerous Buddhist works which have now been translated from  some eight or ten eastern languages, the greater number, when regarded  purely as literature, occupy a very low level. At times they are so  remarkably dull and silly that the reader is inclined to ask why they  were ever translated. But the one redeeming feature in the voluminous  compositions of Buddhist writers is the boundless compassion which  they consistently inculcate.    The insertion of a passage in these pages does not necessarily imply  that the compiler accepts in its entirety the teaching it conveys.  Concerning that oft-repeated injunction, not to kill any living  creature whatsoever, we can hardly doubt that there are many cases in  which to take life, provided it is taken painlessly, not only is not  on the whole an unkindness, but is an act of beneficence. If we  sometimes give to this injunction the sense of extending our sympathy  to the lowest sentient being, and not causing pain to living creatures  while they live, we shall perhaps not be doing violence to the spirit  of mercy by which it was prompted. There are many passages in Buddhist  works which advocate preference for the spirit over the letter, or the  exercise of judgment in accepting what we are taught.    A few passages, though not many, have been included more because they  are striking or poetical than for the sake of their moral teaching.    As the references given are mostly to the Oriental origins, it is only  fair to insert here a list of the English and French translations  which have been principally used in compiling this book. The following  works comprise most of those which have proved directly of service for  the purpose--\"Sacred Books of the East,\" namely:         Vol. 10. Dhammapada, by F.
