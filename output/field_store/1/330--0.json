THE CRIMINAL IN BODY AND MIND    VIII. THE PUNISHMENT OF CRIME          APPENDICES          PREFACE.    This volume, as its title indicates, is occupied with an examination  of some of the principal causes of crime, and is designed as an  introduction to the study of criminal questions in general. In spite  of all the attention these questions have hitherto received and are  now receiving, crime still remains one of the most perplexing and  obstinate of social problems. It is much more formidable than  pauperism, and almost as costly. A social system which has to try  hundreds of thousands of offenders annually before the criminal courts  is in a very imperfect condition; the causes which lead to this state  of things deserve careful consideration from all who take an interest  in social welfare.    In the following pages I have endeavoured to show that crime is a more  complicated phenomenon than is generally supposed. When society will  be able to stamp it out is a question it would be extremely hard to  answer. If it ever does so, it will not be the work of one generation  but of many, and it will not be effected by the application of any  single specific.    Punishment alone will never succeed in putting an end to crime.  Punishment will and does hold crime to a certain extent in check, but  it will never transform the delinquent population into honest  citizens, for the simple reason that it can only strike at the  full-fledged criminal and not at the causes which have made him so.  Economic prosperity, however widely diffused, will not extinguish  crime. Many people imagine that all the evils afflicting society  spring from want, but this is only partially true. A small number of  crimes are probably due to sheer lack of food, but it has to be borne  in mind that crime would still remain an evil of enormous magnitude  even if there were no such calamities as destitution and distress. As  a matter of fact easy circumstances have less influence on conduct  than is generally believed; prosperity generates criminal inclinations  as well as adversity, and on the whole the rich are just as much  addicted to crime as the poor. The progress of civilisation will not  destroy crime. Many savage tribes living under the most primitive  forms of social life present a far more edifying spectacle of respect  for person and property than the most cultivated classes in Europe and  America. All that civilisation has hitherto done is to change the form  in which crime is perpetrated; in substance it remains the same.  Primary Schools will not accomplish much in eliminating crime. The  merely intellectual training received in these institutions has little  salutary influence upon conduct. Nothing can be mope deplorable than  that sectarian bickerings, respecting infinitesimal points in the  sanctions of morality, should result in the children of England  receiving hardly any moral instruction whatever. Conduct, as the late  Mr. Matthew Arnold has so often told us, is three fourths of life.  What are we to think of an educational system which officially ignores  this; what have we to hope in the way of improvement from a people  which consents to its being ignored?    But even a course of systematic instruction in the principles of  conduct, no matter by what sanctions these principles are inculcated,  will not avail much unless they are to some extent practised in the  home. And this will never be the case so long as women are demoralised  by the hard conditions of industrial life, and unfitted for the duties  of motherhood before beginning to undertake them.    In addition to this, no State will ever get rid of the criminal  problem unless its population is composed of healthy and vigorous  citizens. Very often crime is but the offspring of degeneracy and  disease. A diseased and degenerate population, no matter how  favourably circumstanced in other respects, will always produce a  plentiful crop of criminals. Stunted and decrepit faculties, whether  physical or mental, either vitiate the character, or unfit the  combatant for the battle of life. In both cases the result is in  general the same, namely, a career of crime.    As to the best method of dealing with the actual criminal, the first  thing to be done is to know what sort of a person you are dealing  with. He must be carefully studied at first hand. At present too much  attention is bestowed on theoretical discussions respecting the  various kinds of crime and punishment, while hardly any account is  taken of the persons who commit the crime and require the punishment.  Yet this is the most important point of all; the other is trivial in  comparison with it. If crime is to be dealt with in a rational manner  and not on mere _a priori_ grounds, our minds must be enlightened on  such questions as the following: What is the Criminal? What are the  chief causes which have made him such? How are these causes to be got  rid of or neutralised? What is the effect of this or that kind of  punishment? These are the momentous problems; in comparison with  these, all fine-spun definitions respecting the difference between one  crime and another are mere dust in the balance. There can be little  doubt that a neglect of those considerations on the part of many  magistrates and judges, is at the root of the capricious sentences so  often passed upon criminals. The effects of this neglect result in the  passing of sentences of too great severity on first offenders and the  young; and of too much leniency on hardened and habitual criminals.  Leniency, says Grotius, should be exercised with discernment,  otherwise it is not a virtue, but a weakness and a scandal.    When imprisonment has to be resorted to, it must be made a genuine  punishment if it is to exercise any effect as a deterrent. The moment  a prison is made a comfortable place to live in, it becomes useless as  a safeguard against the criminal classes. This is a fundamental  principle. But punishment, although an essential part of imprisonment,  is not its only purpose. Imprisonment should also be a preparation for  liberty. If a convicted man is as unfit for social life at the  expiration of his sentence as he was at the commencement of it, the  prison has only accomplished half its work; it has satisfied the  feeling of public vengeance, but it has failed to transform the  offender into a useful citizen. How to prepare the offender for  liberty is, I admit, a task of supreme difficulty; in some oases,  probably, an impossible task. For work of this character what is  wanted above all is an enlightened staff. Mere machines are useless;  men unacquainted with civil life and its conditions are useless. It is  from civil life the prisoner is taken; it is to civil life he has to  return, and unless he is under the care of men who have an intimate  knowledge of civil life, he will not have the same prospect of being  fitted into it when he has once more to face the world.    In the preparation of this volume I have carefully examined the most  recent ideas of English and Continental writers (especially the  Italians) on the subject of crime. The opinions it contains are based  on an experience of fourteen years in Orders most of which have been  spent in prison work. In revising the proofs I have received valuable  assistance from Mr. J. Morrison.    W.D.M.          CRIME AND ITS CAUSES          CHAPTER I.    THE STATISTICS OF CRIME.      It is only within the present century, and in some countries it is  only within the present generation, that the possibility has arisen of  conducting the study of criminal problems on anything approaching an  exact and scientific basis. Before the introduction of a system of  criminal statistics--a step taken by most peoples within the memory of  men still living--it was impossible for civilised communities to  ascertain with absolute accuracy whether crime was increasing or  decreasing, or what transformation it was passing through in  consequence of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15831"],[0,"The Scientific American Boy; Or, The Camp at Willow Clump Island (#1)"],[1,"Sutherland, and the Project Gutenberg Online Distributed Proofreading Team  (http://www.pgdp.net)        Note: Project Gutenberg also has an HTML version of this file        which includes the more than 300 original illustrations.

Nothing appeals to them more than a summer  vacation in the woods where they can escape from the restraints of  civilization and live a life of freedom. Now, it may appear to be a  bit of presumption to attempt to advise the boy camper how to spend  his time. Surely the novelty of outdoor life, the fascinating charm of  his surroundings, will provide him plenty of entertainment.    But, after all, a camp generally affords but two major amusements,  hunting and fishing. These have been fully covered by a vast number of  books. However, there is another side of camp life, particularly in a  boys' camp, which has been very little dealt with, namely, the exercise  of one's ingenuity in creating out of the limited resources at hand such  devices and articles as will add to one's personal comfort and welfare.  It is, therefore, the aim of this book to suggest certain diversions of  this character for the boy camper which, aside from affording him plenty  of physical exercise, will also develop his mental faculties, and above  all stimulate that natural genius which is characteristic of every  typical American boy. To this end the story contains descriptions of a  large collection of articles which can be made by any boy of average  intelligence, not only in the camp but at home as well.    The use of a narrative to connect the various incidents marks a  departure in this class of book, and it is believed that the matter will  thus be made more realistic and interesting. In all cases full  directions are given for making the various articles. While it is not  presumed that the directions will be slavishly followed, for this would  defeat the general aim of the work, yet all the principal dimensions are  given so that they can be used, if desired.    I beg to acknowledge the courtesy of Mr. Daniel C. Beard and Mr. Henry  D. Cochrane in supplying a number of photographs. The directions for  making the lee boards (page 119) were obtained from data furnished by  the latter. Many of the details recorded in the chapter on Tramping  Outfits are to be accredited to Mr. Edward Thorpe. In the preparation of  this book I have received valuable assistance from my colleague, Mr. A.  A. Hopkins.    A. RUSSELL BOND.    New York, October, 1905.
