M. 2      [Illustration: PRINCIPAL WARDS AND PARISHES IN THE CITY OF LONDON,  1665.]    [Illustration: LONDON AND THE SUBURBS, SEVENTEENTH CENTURY.]          INTRODUCTION.      The father of Daniel Defoe was a butcher in the parish of St. Giles's,  Cripplegate, London. In this parish, probably, Daniel Defoe was born in  1661, the year after the restoration of Charles II. The boy's parents  wished him to become a dissenting minister, and so intrusted his  education to a Mr. Morton who kept an academy for the training of  nonconformist divines. How long Defoe staid at this school is not known.  He seems to think himself that he staid there long enough to become a  good scholar; for he declares that the pupils were \"made masters of the  English tongue, and more of them excelled in that particular than of any  school at that time.\" If this statement be true, we can only say that  the other schools must have been very bad indeed. Defoe never acquired a  really good style, and can in no true sense be called a \"master of the  English tongue.\"    Nature had gifted Defoe with untiring energy, a keen taste for public  affairs, and a special aptitude for chicanery and intrigue. These were  not qualities likely to advance him in the ministry, and he wisely  refused to adopt that profession. With a young man's love for adventure  and a dissenter's hatred for Roman Catholicism, he took part in the Duke  of Monmouth's rebellion (1685) against James II. More fortunate than  three of his fellow students, who were executed for their share in this  affair, Defoe escaped the hue and cry that followed the battle of  Sedgemoor, and after some months' concealment set up as a wholesale  merchant in Cornhill. When James II. was deposed in 1688, and the  Protestant William of Orange elected to the English throne, Defoe  hastened to give in his allegiance to the new dynasty. In 1691 he  published his first pamphlet, \"A New Discovery of an Old Intrigue, a  Satire leveled at Treachery and Ambition.\" This is written in miserable  doggerel verse. That Defoe should have mistaken it for poetry, and  should have prided himself upon it accordingly, is only a proof of how  incompetent an author is to pass judgment upon what is good and what is  bad in his own work.    In 1692 Defoe failed in business, probably from too much attention to  politics, which were now beginning to engross more and more of his time  and thoughts. His political attitude is clearly defined in the title of  his next pamphlet, \"The Englishman's Choice and True Interest: in the  Vigorous Prosecution of the War against France, and serving K. William  and Q. Mary, and acknowledging their Right.\" \"K. William\" was too astute  a manager to neglect a writer who showed the capacity to become a  dangerous opponent. Defoe was accordingly given the place of accountant  to the commissioners of the glass duty (1694). From this time until  William's death (1702), he had no more loyal and active servant than  Defoe. Innumerable pamphlets bear tribute to his devotion to the King  and his policy,--pamphlets written in an easy, swinging, good-natured  style, with little imagination and less passion; pamphlets whose  principal arguments are based upon a reasonable self-interest, and for  the comprehension of which no more intellectual power is called for than  Providence has doled out to the average citizen. Had Defoe lived in the  nineteenth century, instead of in the seventeenth, he would have  commanded a princely salary as writer for the Sunday newspaper, and as  composer of campaign documents and of speeches for members of the House  of Representatives.    In 1701 Defoe published his \"True-born Englishman,\" a satire upon the  English people for their stupid opposition to the continental policy of  the King. This is the only metrical composition of prolific Daniel that  has any pretensions to be called a poem. It contains some lines not  unworthy to rank with those of Dryden at his second-best. For instance,  the opening:--        \"Wherever God erects a house of prayer,      The Devil always builds a chapel there;      And 'twill be found upon examination      The latter has the largest congregation.\"    Or, again, this keen and spirited description of the origin of the  English race:--        \"These are the heroes that despise the Dutch,      And rail at newcome foreigners so much,      Forgetting that themselves are all derived      From the most scoundrel race that ever lived;      A horrid crowd of rambling thieves and drones,      Who ransacked kingdoms and dispeopled towns:      The Pict and painted Briton, treach'rous Scot      By hunger, theft, and rapine hither brought;      Norwegian pirates, buccaneering Danes,      Whose red-haired offspring everywhere remains:      Who, joined with Norman French, compound the breed      From whence your true-born Englishmen proceed.\"    Strange to say, the English people were so pleased with this humorous  sketch of themselves, that they bought eighty thousand copies of the  work. Not often is a truth teller so rewarded.    Not unnaturally elated by the success of this experiment, the next year  Defoe came out with his famous \"Shortest Way with the Dissenters,\" a  satire upon those furious High Churchmen and Tories, who would devour  the dissenters tooth and nail. Unfortunately, the author had  overestimated the capacity of the average Tory to see through a stone  wall. The irony was mistaken for sincerity, and quoted approvingly by  those whom it was intended to satirize. When the truth dawned through  the obscuration of the Tories' intellect, they were naturally enraged.  They had influence enough to have Defoe arrested, and confined in  Newgate for some eighteen months. He was also compelled to stand in the  pillory for three days; but it is not true that his ears were cropped,  as Pope intimates in his        \"Earless on high stood unabashed Defoe.\"    What are the exact terms Defoe made with the ministry, and on exactly  what conditions he was released from Newgate, have not been ascertained.  It is certain he never ceased to write, even while in prison, both  anonymously and under his own name. For some years, in addition to  pamphlet after pamphlet, he published a newspaper which he called the  \"Review,\"[1] in which he generally sided with the moderate Whigs,  advocated earnestly the union with Scotland, and gave the English people  a vast deal of good advice upon foreign policy and domestic trade. There  is no doubt that during this time he was in the secret service of the  government. When the Tories displaced the Whigs in 1710, he managed to  keep his post, and took his \"Review\" over to the support of the new  masters, justifying his turncoating by a disingenuous plea of preferring  country to party. His pamphleteering pen was now as active in the  service of the Tory prime minister Harley as it had been in that of the  Whig Godolphin. The party of the latter rightly regarded him as a  traitor to their cause, and secured an order from the Court of Queen's  Bench, directing the attorney-general to prosecute Defoe for certain  pamphlets, which they declared were directed against the Hanoverian  succession. Before the trial took place, Harley, at whose instigation  the pamphlets had been written, secured his henchman a royal pardon.    When the Tories fell from power at the death of Queen Anne (1714), and  the Whigs again obtained possession of the government, only one of two  courses was open to Defoe: he must either retire permanently from  politics, or again change sides. He unhesitatingly chose the latter. But  his political reputation had now sunk so low, that no party could afford  the disgrace of his open support. He was accordingly employed as a  literary and political spy, ostensibly opposing the government, worming  himself into the confidence of Tory editors and politicians, using his  influence as an editorial writer to suppress items obnoxious to the  government, and suggesting the timely prosecution of such critics as he  could not control. He was able to play this double part for eight years,  until his treachery was discovered by one Mist, whose \"Journal\" Defoe  had, in his own words, \"disabled and enervated, so as to do no mischief,  or give any offense to the government.\" Mist hastened to disclose  Defoe's real character to his fellow newspaper proprietors; and in 1726  we find the good Daniel sorrowfully complaining, \"I had not published my  project in this pamphlet, could I have got it inserted in any of the  journals without feeing the journalists or publishers.... I have not  only had the mortification to find what I sent rejected, but to lose my  originals, not having taken copies of what I wrote.\"[2] Heavy-footed  justice had at last overtaken the arch liar of his age.    Of the two hundred and fifty odd books and pamphlets written by Defoe,  it may fairly be said that only two--\"Robinson Crusoe\" and the \"History  of the Plague in London\"--are read by any but the special students of  eighteenth-century literature. The latter will be discussed in another  part of this Introduction. Of the former it may be asserted, that it  arose naturally out of the circumstances of Defoe's trade as a  journalist. So long as the papers would take his articles, nobody of  distinction could die without Defoe's rushing out with a biography of  him. In these biographies, when facts were scanty, Defoe supplied them  from his imagination, attributing to his hero such sentiments as he  thought the average Londoner could understand, and describing his  appearance with that minute fidelity of which only an eyewitness is  supposed to be capable. Long practice in this kind of composition made  Defoe an adept "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1723"],[0,"Cow-Country (#1)"],[1,"COW-COUNTRY    By B. M. Bower          CHAPTERS:         1.

TRAILS END          COW-COUNTRY        CHAPTER ONE: AN AMBITIOUS MAN-CHILD WAS BUDDY    In hot mid afternoon when the acrid, gray dust cloud kicked up by the  listless plodding of eight thousand cloven hoofs formed the only blot on  the hard blue above the Staked Plains, an ox stumbled and fell awkwardly  under his yoke, and refused to scramble up when his negro driver shouted  and prodded him with the end of a willow gad.    \"Call your master, Ezra,\" directed a quiet woman voice gone weary and  toneless with the heat and two restless children. \"Don't beat the poor  brute. He can't go any farther and carry the yoke, much less pull the  wagon.\"    Ezra dropped the gad and stepped upon the wagon tongue where he might  squint into the dust cloud and decide which gray, plodding horseman  alongside the herd was Robert Birnie. Far across the sluggish river of  grimy backs, a horse threw up its head with a peculiar sidelong motion,  and Ezra's eyes lightened with recognition. That was the colt, Rattler,  chafing against the slow pace he must keep. Hands cupped around big,  chocolate-colored lips and big, yellow-white teeth, Ezra whoo-ee-ed the  signal that called the nearest riders to the wagon that held the boss's  family.    Bob Birnie and another man turned and came trotting back, and at the  call a scrambling youngster peered over his mother's shoulder in the  forward opening of the prairie schooner.    \"O-oh, Dulcie! We gonna git a wile cow agin!\"    Dulcie was asleep and did not answer, and the woman in the slat  sun-bonnet pushed back with her elbow the eager, squirming body of her  eldest. \"Stay in the wagon, Buddy. Mustn't get down amongst the oxen.  One might kick you. Lie down and take a nap with sister. When you waken  it will be nice and cool again.\"    \"Not s'eepy!\" objected Buddy for the twentieth time in the past two  hours. But he crawled back, and his mother, relieved of his restless  presence, leaned forward to watch the approach of her husband and the  cowboy. This was the second time in the past two days that an ox had  fallen exhausted, and her eyes showed a trace of anxiety. With the feed  so poor and the water so scarce, it seemed as though the heavy wagon,  loaded with a few household idols too dear to leave behind, a camp  outfit and the necessary clothing and bedding for a woman and two  children, was going to be a real handicap on the drive.    \"Robert, if we had another wagon, I could drive it and make the load  less for these four oxen,\" she suggested when her husband came up. \"A  lighter wagon, perhaps with one team of strong horses, or even with a  yoke of oxen, I could drive well enough, and relieve these poor brutes.\"  She pushed back her sun-bonnet and with it a mass of red-brown hair that  curled damply on her forehead, and smiled disarmingly. \"Buddy would be  the happiest baby boy alive if I could let him drive now and then!\" she  added humorously.    \"Can't make a wagon and an extra yoke of oxen out of this cactus patch,\"  Bob Birnie grinned good humoredly. \"Not even to tickle Buddy. I'll see  what I can do when we reach Olathe. But you won't have to take a man's  place and drive, Lassie.\" He took the cup of water she drew from a keg  and proffered-water was precious on the Staked Plains, that season-and  his eyes dwelt on her fondly while he drank. Then, giving her hand a  squeeze when he returned the cup, he rode back to scan the herd for an  animal big enough and well-conditioned enough to supplant the worn-out  ox.    \"Aren't you thirsty, Frank Davis? I think a cup of water will do you  good,\" she called out to the cowboy, who had dismounted to tighten his  forward cinch in expectation of having to use his rope.    The cowboy dropped stirrup from saddle horn and came forward  stiff-leggedly, leading his horse. His sun-baked face, grimed with the  dust of the herd, was aglow with heat, and his eyes showed gratitude.  A cup of water from the hand of the boss's wife was worth a gallon from  the barrel slip-slopping along in the lurching chuck-wagon.    \"How's the kids makin' out, Mis' Birnie?\" Frank inquired politely when  he had swallowed the last drop and had wiped his mouth with the back of  his hand. \"It's right warm and dusty t'day.\"    \"They're asleep at last, thank goodness,\" she answered, glancing back  at a huddle of pink calico that showed just over the crest of a pile  of crumpled quilts. \"Buddy has a hard time of it. He's all man in his  disposition, and all baby in size. He's been teasing to walk with the  niggers and help drive the drag. Is my husband calling?\"    Her husband was, and Frank rode away at a leisurely trot. Haste had  little to do with trailing a herd, where eight miles was called a good  day's journey and six an average achievement. The fallen ox was unyoked  by the mellow-voiced but exasperated Ezra, and since he would not rise,  the three remaining oxen, urged by the gad and Ezra's upbraiding,  swung the wagon to one side and moved it a little farther after the  slow-moving herd, so that the exhausted animal could rest, and the  raw recruit be yoked in where he could do the least harm and would the  speediest learn a new lesson in discomfort. Mrs. Birnie glanced again  at the huddle of pink in the nest of quilts behind a beloved chest of  drawers in the wagon, and sighed with relief because Buddy slept.    An ambitious man-child already was Buddy, accustomed to certain phrases  that, since he could toddle, had formed inevitable accompaniment to his  investigative footsteps. \"L'k-out-dah!\" he had for a long time believed  to be his name among the black folk of his world. White folk had varied  it slightly. He knew that \"Run-to-mother-now\" meant that something he  would delight in but must not watch was going to take place. Spankings  more or less official and not often painful signified that big folks did  not understand him and his activities, or were cross about something.  Now, mother did not want him to watch the wild cow run and jump at the  end of a rope until finally forced to submit to the ox-yoke and help  pull the wagon. Buddy loved to watch them, but he understood that mother  was afraid the wild cow might step on him. Why she should want him to  sleep when he was not sleepy he had not yet discovered, and so disdained  to give it serious consideration.    \"Not s'eepy,\" Buddy stated again emphatically as a sort of mental  dismissal of the command, and crawled carefully past Sister and lifted a  flap of the canvas cover. A button--the last button--popped off his pink  apron and the sleeves rumpled down over his hands. It felt all loose and  useless, so Buddy stopped long enough to pull the apron off and throw  it beside Sister before he crawled under the canvas flap and walked down  the spokes of a rear wheel. He did not mean to get in the way of the  wild cow, but he did want action for his restless legs. He thought that  if he went away from the wagon and the herd and played while they were  catching the wild cow, it would be just the same as if he took a nap.  Mother hadn't thought of it, or she might have suggested it.    So Buddy went away from the wagon and down into a shallow dry wash where  the wild cow would not come, and played. The first thing he saw was  a scorpion-nasty old bug that will bite hard-and he threw rocks at it  until it scuttled under a ledge out of sight. The next thing he saw that  interested him at all was a horned toad; a hawn-toe, he called it, after  Ezra's manner of speaking. Ezra had caught a hawntoe for him a few days  ago, but it had mysteriously disappeared out of the wagon. Buddy did  not connect his mother's lack of enthusiasm with the disappearance. Her  sympathy with his loss had seemed to him real, and he wanted another,  fully believing that in this also mother would be pleased. So he took  after this particular HAWN-toe, that crawled into various hiding places  only to be spied and routed out with small rocks and a sharp stick.    The dry wash remained shallow, and after a while Buddy, still in hot  pursuit of the horned toad, emerged upon the level where the herd had  passed. The wagon was nowhere in sight, but this did not disturb Buddy.  He was not lost. He knew perfectly that the brown cloud on his narrowed  horizon was the dust over the herd, and that the wagon was just behind,  because the wind that day was blowing from the southwest, and also  because the oxen did not walk as fast as the herd. In the distance he  saw the \"Drag\" moving lazily along after the dust-cloud, with barefooted  niggers driving the laggard cattle and singing dolefully as they walked.  Emphatically Buddy was not lost.    He wanted that particular horned toad, however, and he kept after it  until he had it safe in his two hands.    It happened that when he pounced at last upon the toad he disturbed  with his presence a colony of red ants on moving day. The close ranks  of them, coming and going in a straight line, caught and held Buddy's  attention to the exclusion of everything else--save the horned toad  he had been at such pains to acquire. He tucked the toad inside his  underwaist and ignored its wriggling against his flesh while he squatted  in the hot sunshine and watched the ants, his mind one great question.  Where were they going, and "]]]
