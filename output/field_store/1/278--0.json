Since that time I have been engaged on a work not yet finished, which I  interrupt now to tell the story of the mob in New Orleans, which,  despising all law, roamed the streets day and night, searching for colored  men and women, whom they beat, shot and killed at will.    In the account of the New Orleans mob I have used freely the graphic  reports of the _New Orleans Times-Democrat_ and the _New Orleans  Picayune_. Both papers gave the most minute details of the week's  disorder. In their editorial comment they were at all times most urgent in  their defense of law and in the strongest terms they condemned the  infamous work of the mob.    It is no doubt owing to the determined stand for law and order taken by  these great dailies and the courageous action taken by the best citizens  of New Orleans, who rallied to the support of the civic authorities, that  prevented a massacre of colored people awful to contemplate.    For the accounts and illustrations taken from the above-named journals,  sincere thanks are hereby expressed.    [Illustration]    The publisher hereof does not attempt to moralize over the deplorable  condition of affairs shown in this publication, but simply presents the  facts in a plain, unvarnished, connected way, so that he who runs may  read. We do not believe that the American people who have encouraged such  scenes by their indifference will read unmoved these accounts of  brutality, injustice and oppression. We do not believe that the moral  conscience of the nation--that which is highest and best among us--will  always remain silent in face of such outrages, for God is not dead, and  His Spirit is not entirely driven from men's hearts.    When this conscience wakes and speaks out in thunder tones, as it must, it  will need facts to use as a weapon against injustice, barbarism and wrong.  It is for this reason that I carefully compile, print and send forth these  facts. If the reader can do no more, he can pass this pamphlet on to  another, or send to the bureau addresses of those to whom he can order  copies mailed.    Besides the New Orleans case, a history of burnings in this country is  given, together with a table of lynchings for the past eighteen years.  Those who would like to assist in the work of disseminating these facts,  can do so by ordering copies, which are furnished at greatly reduced  rates for gratuitous distribution. The bureau has no funds and is entirely  dependent upon contributions from friends and members in carrying on the  work.    Ida B. Wells-Barnett  Chicago, Sept. 1, 1900          MOB RULE IN NEW ORLEANS            +SHOT AN OFFICER+    The bloodiest week which New Orleans has known since the massacre of the  Italians in 1892 was ushered in Monday, July 24, by the inexcusable and  unprovoked assault upon two colored men by police officers of New Orleans.  Fortified by the assurance born of long experience in the New Orleans  service, three policemen, Sergeant Aucoin, Officer Mora and Officer  Cantrelle, observing two colored men sitting on doorsteps on Dryades  street, between Washington Avenue and 6th Streets, determined, without a  shadow of authority, to arrest them. One of the colored men was named  Robert Charles, the other was a lad of nineteen named Leonard Pierce. The  colored men had left their homes, a few blocks distant, about an hour  prior, and had been sitting upon the doorsteps for a short time talking  together. They had not broken the peace in any way whatever, no warrant  was in the policemen's hands justifying their arrest, and no crime had  been committed of which they were the suspects. The policemen, however,  secure in the firm belief that they could do anything to a Negro that they  wished, approached the two men, and in less than three minutes from the  time they accosted them attempted to put both colored men under arrest.  The younger of the two men, Pierce, submitted to arrest, for the officer,  Cantrelle, who accosted him, put his gun in the young man's face ready to  blow his brains out if he moved. The other colored man, Charles, was made  the victim of a savage attack by Officer Mora, who used a billet and then  drew a gun and tried to kill Charles. Charles drew his gun nearly as  quickly as the policeman, and began a duel in the street, in which both  participants were shot. The policeman got the worst of the duel, and fell  helpless to the sidewalk. Charles made his escape. Cantrelle took Pierce,  his captive, to the police station, to which place Mora, the wounded  officer, was also taken, and a man hunt at once instituted for Charles,  the wounded fugitive.    In any law-abiding community Charles would have been justified in  delivering himself up immediately to the properly constituted authorities  and asking a trial by a jury of his peers. He could have been certain that  in resisting an unwarranted arrest he had a right to defend his life, even  to the point of taking one in that defense, but Charles knew that his  arrest in New Orleans, even for defending his life, meant nothing short of  a long term in the penitentiary, and still more probable death by lynching  at the hands of a cowardly mob. He very bravely determined to protect his  life as long as he had breath in his body and strength to draw a hair  trigger on his would-be murderers. How well he was justified in that  belief is well shown by the newspaper accounts which were given of this  transaction. Without a single line of evidence to justify the assertion,  the New Orleans daily papers at once declared that both Pierce and Charles  were desperadoes, that they were contemplating a burglary and that they  began the assault upon the policemen. It is interesting to note how the  two leading papers of New Orleans, the _Picayune_ and the  _Times-Democrat_, exert themselves to justify the policemen in the  absolutely unprovoked attack upon the two colored men. As these two papers  did all in their power to give an excuse for the action of the policemen,  it is interesting to note their versions. The _Times-Democrat_ of Tuesday  morning, the twenty-fifth, says:      Two blacks, who are desperate men, and no doubt will be proven burglars,    made it interesting and dangerous for three bluecoats on Dryades street,    between Washington Avenue and Sixth Street, the Negroes using pistols    first and dropping Patrolman Mora. But the desperate darkies did not go    free, for the taller of the two, Robinson, is badly wounded and under    cover, while Leonard Pierce is in jail.      For a long time that particular neighborhood has been troubled with bad    Negroes, and the neighbors were complaining to the Sixth Precinct police    about them. But of late Pierce and Robinson had been camping on a door    step on the street, and the people regarded their actions as suspicious.    It got to such a point that some of the residents were afraid to go to    bed, and last night this was told Sergeant Aucoin, who was rounding up    his men. He had just picked up Officers Mora and Cantrell, on Washington    Avenue and Dryades Street, and catching a glimpse of the blacks on the    steps, he said he would go over and warn the men to get away from the    street. So the patrolmen followed, and Sergeant Aucoin asked the smaller    fellow, Pierce, if he lived there. The answer was short and impertinent,    the black saying he did not, and with that both Pierce and Robinson drew    up to their full height.      For the moment the sergeant did not think that the Negroes meant fight,    and he was on the point of ordering them away when Robinson slipped his    pistol from his pocket. Pierce had his revolver out, too, and he fired    twice, point blank at the sergeant, and just then Robinson began    shooting at the patrolmen. In a second or so the policemen and blacks    were fighting with their revolvers, the sergeant having a duel with    Pierce, while Cantrell and Mora drew their line of fire on Robinson, who    was working his revolver for all he was worth. One of his shots took    Mora in the right hip, another caught his index finger on the right    hand, and a third struck the small finger of the left hand. Poor Mora    was done for; he could not fight any more, but Cantrell kept up his    fire, being answered by the big black. Pierce's revolver broke down, the    cartridges snapping, and he threw up his hands, begging for quarter.      The sergeant lowered his pistol and some citizens ran over to where the    shooting was going on. One of the bullets that went at Robinson caught    him in the breast and he began running, turning out Sixth Street, with    Cantrell behind him, shooting every few steps. He was loading his    revolver again, but did not use it after the start he took, and in a    little while Officer Cantrell lost the man in the darkness.      Pierce was made a prisoner and hurried to the Sixth Precinct police    station, where he was charged with shooting and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14977"],[0,"The Red Record (#1)"],[1,"Red Record:  Tabulated Statistics and  Alleged Causes of Lynching  in the United States    By Ida B.

FREDERICK DOUGLASS'S LETTER    DEAR MISS WELLS:    Let me give you thanks for your faithful paper on the lynch abomination  now generally practiced against colored people in the South. There has  been no word equal to it in convincing power. I have spoken, but my word  is feeble in comparison. You give us what you know and testify from actual  knowledge. You have dealt with the facts with cool, painstaking fidelity,  and left those naked and uncontradicted facts to speak for themselves.    Brave woman! you have done your people and mine a service which can  neither be weighed nor measured. If the American conscience were only half  alive, if the American church and clergy were only half Christianized, if  American moral sensibility were not hardened by persistent infliction of  outrage and crime against colored people, a scream of horror, shame, and  indignation would rise to Heaven wherever your pamphlet shall be read.    But alas! even crime has power to reproduce itself and create conditions  favorable to its own existence. It sometimes seems we are deserted by  earth and Heaven--yet we must still think, speak and work, and trust in  the power of a merciful God for final deliverance.    Very truly and gratefully yours,  FREDERICK DOUGLASS  Cedar Hill, Anacostia, D.C.

Beginning with the emancipation of the Negro, the inevitable result of  unbribled power exercised for two and a half centuries, by the white man  over the Negro, began to show itself in acts of conscienceless outlawry.  During the slave regime, the Southern white man owned the Negro body and  soul. It was to his interest to dwarf the soul and preserve the body.  Vested with unlimited power over his slave, to subject him to any and all  kinds of physical punishment, the white man was still restrained from such  punishment as tended to injure the slave by abating his physical powers  and thereby reducing his financial worth. While slaves were scourged  mercilessly, and in countless cases inhumanly treated in other respects,  still the white owner rarely permitted his anger to go so far as to take a  life, which would entail upon him a loss of several hundred dollars. The  slave was rarely killed, he was too valuable; it was easier and quite as  effective, for discipline or revenge, to sell him \"Down South.\"    But Emancipation came and the vested interests of the white man in the  Negro's body were lost. The white man had no right to scourge the  emancipated Negro, still less has he a right to kill him. But the Southern  white people had been educated so long in that school of practice, in  which might makes right, that they disdained to draw strict lines of  action in dealing with the Negro. In slave times the Negro was kept  subservient and submissive by the frequency and severity of the scourging,  but, with freedom, a new system of intimidation came into vogue; the Negro  was not only whipped and scourged; he was killed.    Not all nor nearly all of the murders done by white men, during the past  thirty years in the South, have come to light, but the statistics as  gathered and preserved by white men, and which have not been questioned,  show that during these years more than ten thousand Negroes have been  killed in cold blood, without the formality of judicial trial and legal  execution. And yet, as evidence of the absolute impunity with which the  white man dares to kill a Negro, the same record shows that during all  these years, and for all these murders only three white men have been  tried, convicted, and executed. As no white man has been lynched for the  murder of colored people, these three executions are the only instances of  the death penalty being visited upon white men for murdering Negroes.    Naturally enough the commission of these crimes began to tell upon the  public conscience, and the Southern white man, as a tribute to the  nineteenth-century civilization, was in a manner compelled to give excuses  for his barbarism. His excuses have adapted themselves to the emergency,  and are aptly outlined by that greatest of all Negroes, Frederick  Douglass, in an article of recent date, in which he shows that there have  been three distinct eras of Southern barbarism, to account for which three  distinct excuses have been made.    The first excuse given to the civilized world for the murder of  unoffending Negroes was the necessity of the white man to repress and  stamp out alleged \"race riots.\" For years immediately succeeding the war  there was an appalling slaughter of colored people, and the wires usually  conveyed to northern people and the world the intelligence, first, that an  insurrection was being planned by Negroes, which, a few hours later, would  prove to have been vigorously resisted by white men, and controlled with a  resulting loss of several killed and wounded. It was always a remarkable  feature in these insurrections and riots that only Negroes were killed  during the rioting, and that all the white men escaped unharmed.    From 1865 to 1872, hundreds of colored men and women were mercilessly  murdered and the almost invariable reason assigned was that they met their  death by being alleged participants in an insurrection or riot. But this  story at last wore itself out. No insurrection ever materialized; no  Negro rioter was ever apprehended and proven guilty, and no dynamite ever  recorded the black man's protest against oppression and wrong. It was too  much to ask thoughtful people to believe this transparent story, and the  southern white people at last made up their minds that some other excuse  must be had.    Then came the second excuse, which had its birth during the turbulent  times of reconstruction. By an amendment to the Constitution the Negro was  given the right of franchise, and, theoretically at least, his ballot  became his invaluable emblem of citizenship. In a government \"of the  people, for the people, and by the people,\" the Negro's vote became an  important factor in all matters of state and national politics. But this  did not last long. The southern white man would not consider that the  Negro had any right which a white man was bound to respect, and the idea  of a republican form of government in the southern states grew into  general contempt. It was maintained that \"This is a white man's  government,\" and regardless of numbers the white man should rule. \"No  Negro domination\" became the new legend on the sanguinary banner of the  sunny South, and under it rode the Ku Klux Klan, the Regulators, and the  lawless mobs, which for any cause chose to murder one man or a dozen as  suited their purpose best. It was a long, gory campaign; the blood chills  and the heart almost loses faith in Christianity when one thinks of Yazoo,  Hamburg, Edgefield, Copiah, and the countless massacres of defenseless  Negroes, whose only crime was the attempt to exercise their right to vote.    But it was a bootless strife for colored people. The government which had  made the Negro a citizen found itself unable to protect him. It gave him  the right to vote, but denied him the protection which should have  maintained that right. Scourged from his home; hunted through the swamps;  hung by midnight raiders, and openly murdered in the light of day, the  Negro clung to his right of franchise with a heroism which would have  wrung admiration from the hearts of savages. He believed that in that  small white ballot there was a subtle something which stood for manhood as  well as citizenship, and thousands of brave black men went to their  graves, exemplifying the one by dying for the other.    The white man's victory soon became complete by fraud, violence,  intimidation and murder. The franchise vouchsafed to the Negro grew to be  a \"barren ideality,\" and regardless of numbers, the colored people found  themselves voiceless in the councils of those whose duty it was to rule.  With no longer the fear of \"Negro Domination\" before their eyes, the  white man's second excuse became valueless. With the Southern governments  all subverted and the Negro actually eliminated from all participation in  state and national elections, there could be no longer an excuse for  killing Negroes to prevent \"Negro Domination.\"    Brutality still continued; Negroes were whipped, scourged, exiled, shot  and hung whenever and wherever it pleased the white man so to treat them,  and as the civilized world with increasing persistency held the white  people of the South to account for its outlawry, the murderers invented  the third excuse--that Negroes had to be killed to avenge their assaults  upon women. There could be framed no"]]]
