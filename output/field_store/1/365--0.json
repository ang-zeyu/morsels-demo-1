[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1658"],[0,"Phaedo (#1)"],[1,"By Plato      Translated by Benjamin Jowett          INTRODUCTION.    After an interval of some months or years, and at Phlius, a town of  Peloponnesus, the tale of the last hours of Socrates is narrated to  Echecrates and other Phliasians by Phaedo the 'beloved disciple.' The  Dialogue necessarily takes the form of a narrative, because Socrates has  to be described acting as well as speaking. The minutest particulars of  the event are interesting to distant friends, and the narrator has an  equal interest in them.    During the voyage of the sacred ship to and from Delos, which has  occupied thirty days, the execution of Socrates has been deferred.  (Compare Xen. Mem.) The time has been passed by him in conversation with  a select company of disciples. But now the holy season is over, and the  disciples meet earlier than usual in order that they may converse with  Socrates for the last time. Those who were present, and those who might  have been expected to be present, are mentioned by name. There are  Simmias and Cebes (Crito), two disciples of Philolaus whom Socrates  'by his enchantments has attracted from Thebes' (Mem.), Crito the aged  friend, the attendant of the prison, who is as good as a friend--these  take part in the conversation. There are present also, Hermogenes,  from whom Xenophon derived his information about the trial of Socrates  (Mem.), the 'madman' Apollodorus (Symp.), Euclid and Terpsion from  Megara (compare Theaet.), Ctesippus, Antisthenes, Menexenus, and some  other less-known members of the Socratic circle, all of whom are silent  auditors. Aristippus, Cleombrotus, and Plato are noted as absent. Almost  as soon as the friends of Socrates enter the prison Xanthippe and her  children are sent home in the care of one of Crito's servants.  Socrates himself has just been released from chains, and is led by this  circumstance to make the natural remark that 'pleasure follows pain.'  (Observe that Plato is preparing the way for his doctrine of the  alternation of opposites.) 'Aesop would have represented them in a fable  as a two-headed creature of the gods.' The mention of Aesop reminds  Cebes of a question which had been asked by Evenus the poet (compare  Apol.): 'Why Socrates, who was not a poet, while in prison had been  putting Aesop into verse?'--'Because several times in his life he had  been warned in dreams that he should practise music; and as he was about  to die and was not certain of what was meant, he wished to fulfil the  admonition in the letter as well as in the spirit, by writing verses as  well as by cultivating philosophy. Tell this to Evenus; and say that I  would have him follow me in death.' 'He is not at all the sort of man  to comply with your request, Socrates.' 'Why, is he not a philosopher?'  'Yes.' 'Then he will be willing to die, although he will not take his  own life, for that is held to be unlawful.'    Cebes asks why suicide is thought not to be right, if death is to be  accounted a good? Well, (1) according to one explanation, because man is  a prisoner, who must not open the door of his prison and run away--this  is the truth in a 'mystery.' Or (2) rather, because he is not his own  property, but a possession of the gods, and has no right to make away  with that which does not belong to him. But why, asks Cebes, if he is a  possession of the gods, should he wish to die and leave them? For he is  under their protection; and surely he cannot take better care of himself  than they take of him. Simmias explains that Cebes is really referring  to Socrates, whom they think too unmoved at the prospect of leaving the  gods and his friends. Socrates answers that he is going to other gods  who are wise and good, and perhaps to better friends; and he professes  that he is ready to defend himself against the charge of Cebes.  The company shall be his judges, and he hopes that he will be more  successful in convincing them than he had been in convincing the court.    The philosopher desires death--which the wicked world will insinuate  that he also deserves: and perhaps he does, but not in any sense which  they are capable of understanding. Enough of them: the real question  is, What is the nature of that death which he desires? Death is  the separation of soul and body--and the philosopher desires such  a separation. He would like to be freed from the dominion of bodily  pleasures and of the senses, which are always perturbing his mental  vision. He wants to get rid of eyes and ears, and with the light of the  mind only to behold the light of truth. All the evils and impurities  and necessities of men come from the body. And death separates him from  these corruptions, which in life he cannot wholly lay aside. Why then  should he repine when the hour of separation arrives? Why, if he is dead  while he lives, should he fear that other death, through which alone he  can behold wisdom in her purity?    Besides, the philosopher has notions of good and evil unlike those of  other men. For they are courageous because they are afraid of greater  dangers, and temperate because they desire greater pleasures. But he  disdains this balancing of pleasures and pains, which is the exchange  of commerce and not of virtue. All the virtues, including wisdom, are  regarded by him only as purifications of the soul. And this was the  meaning of the founders of the mysteries when they said, 'Many are the  wand-bearers but few are the mystics.' (Compare Matt. xxii.: 'Many are  called but few are chosen.') And in the hope that he is one of these  mystics, Socrates is now departing. This is his answer to any one who  charges him with indifference at the prospect of leaving the gods and  his friends.    Still, a fear is expressed that the soul upon leaving the body may  vanish away like smoke or air. Socrates in answer appeals first of all  to the old Orphic tradition that the souls of the dead are in the world  below, and that the living come from them. This he attempts to found  on a philosophical assumption that all opposites--e.g. less, greater;  weaker, stronger; sleeping, waking; life, death--are generated out of  each other. Nor can the process of generation be only a passage from  living to dying, for then all would end in death. The perpetual sleeper  (Endymion) would be no longer distinguished from the rest of mankind.  The circle of nature is not complete unless the living come from the  dead as well as pass to them.    The Platonic doctrine of reminiscence is then adduced as a confirmation  of the pre-existence of the soul. Some proofs of this doctrine are  demanded. One proof given is the same as that of the Meno, and is  derived from the latent knowledge of mathematics, which may be elicited  from an unlearned person when a diagram is presented to him. Again,  there is a power of association, which from seeing Simmias may remember  Cebes, or from seeing a picture of Simmias may remember Simmias. The  lyre may recall the player of the lyre, and equal pieces of wood or  stone may be associated with the higher notion of absolute equality. But  here observe that material equalities fall short of the conception of  absolute equality with which they are compared, and which is the measure  of them. And the measure or standard must be prior to that which is  measured, the idea of equality prior to the visible equals. And if prior  to them, then prior also to the perceptions of the senses which recall  them, and therefore either given before birth or at birth. But all men  have not this knowledge, nor have any without a process of reminiscence;  which is a proof that it is not innate or given at birth, unless indeed  it was given and taken away at the same instant. But if not given to  men in birth, it must have been given before birth--this is the only  alternative which remains. And if we had ideas in a former state, then  our souls must have existed and must have had intelligence in a former  state. The pre-existence of the soul stands or falls with the doctrine  of ideas.    It is objected by Simmias and Cebes that these arguments only prove a  former and not a future existence. Socrates answers this objection by  recalling the previous argument, in which he had shown that the living  come from the dead. But the fear that the soul at departing may vanish  into air (especially if there is a wind blowing at the time) has not yet  been charmed away. He proceeds: When we fear that the soul will vanish  away, let us ask ourselves what is that which we suppose to be liable  to dissolution? Is it the simple or the compound, the unchanging or the  changing, the invisible idea or the visible object of sense? Clearly the  latter and not the former; and therefore not the soul, which in her own  pure thought is unchangeable, and only when using the senses descends  into the region of change. Again, the soul commands, the body serves:  in this respect too the soul is akin to the divine, and the body to the  mortal. And in every point of view the soul is the image of divinity and  immortality, and the body of the human and mortal. And whereas the  body is liable to speedy dissolution, the soul is almost if not quite  indissoluble. (Compare Tim.) Yet even the body may be preserved for ages  by the embalmer's art: how unlikely, then, that the soul will perish and  be dissipated into air while on her way to the good and wise God!  She has been gathered into herself, holding aloof from the body, and  practising death all her life long, and she is now finally released from  the errors and follies and passions of men, and for ever dwells in the  company of the gods.    But the soul which is polluted and engrossed by the corporeal, and has  no eye except that of the senses, and is weighed down by the bodily  appetites, cannot attain to this abstraction. In her fear of the world  below she lingers about the sepulchre, loath to leave the body which  she loved, a ghostly apparition, saturated"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16598"],[0,"History of the American Negro in the Great World War (#1)"],[1,"Team at https://www.pgdp.net              [Illustration: W.
