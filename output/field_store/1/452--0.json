IMPORTANCE OF RODENT GROUPS.      As the serious character of the depredations by harmful rodents is  recognized, State, Federal, and private expenditures for their control  increase year by year. These depredations include not only the attacks  by introduced rats and mice on food materials stored in granaries,  warehouses, commercial establishments, docks, and private houses, but  also, particularly in the Western States, the ravages of several groups  of native ground squirrels and other noxious rodents in grain and  certain other field crops. Nor is this all, for it has been found that  such rodents as prairie dogs, pocket gophers, marmots, ground squirrels,  and rabbits take appreciable and serious toll of the forage on the open  grazing range; in fact, that they reduce the carrying capacity of the  range to such an extent that expenditures for control measures are amply  justified. Current estimates place the loss of goods due to rats and  mice in warehouses and stores throughout the United States at no less  than $200,000,000 annually, and damage to the carrying capacity of the  open range and to cultivated crops generally by native rodents in the  Western States at $300,000,000 additional; added together, we have an  impressive total from depredations of rodents.    The distribution and life habits of rodents and the general  consideration of their relation to agriculture, forestry, and grazing,  with special reference to the carrying capacity of stock ranges, is a  subject that has received attention for many years from the Biological  Survey of the United States Department of Agriculture. As a result of  the investigations conducted much has been learned concerning the  economic status of most of the more important groups, and the knowledge  already gained forms the basis of the extensive rodent-control work  already in progress, and in which many States are cooperating with the  bureau. If the work is to be prosecuted intelligently and the fullest  measure of success achieved, it is essential that the consideration  largely of groups as a whole be supplemented by more exhaustive  treatment of the life histories of individual species and of their place  in the biological complex. The present report is based upon  investigations, chiefly in Arizona, of the life history, habits, and  economic status of the banner-tailed kangaroo rat, _Dipodomys  spectabilis spectabilis_ Merriam (Pl. I).      INVESTIGATIONAL METHODS.    Some 18 years ago (in 1903) a tract of land 49.2 square miles in area on  the Coronado National Forest near the Santa Rita Mountains, Pima County,  southern Arizona, was closed to grazing by arrangement between the  Forest Service and the Agricultural Experiment Station of the University  of Arizona. Since that time another small tract of nearly a section has  been inclosed (Griffiths, 1910, 7[1]). This total area of approximately  50 square miles is known as the United States Range Reserve, and is  being devoted to a study of grazing conditions in this section and to  working out the best methods of administering the range (Pl. II, Fig.  1).    For some years an intensive study of the forage and other vegetative  conditions of this area has been made, the permanent vegetation quadrat,  as proposed by Dr. F. E. Clements (1905, 161-175), being largely  utilized. During the autumn of 1917 representatives of the Carnegie  Institution and the Arizona Agricultural Experiment Station visited the  Reserve and were impressed with the evidence of rodent damage to the  grass cover. The most conspicuous appearance of damage was noted about  the habitations of the banner-tailed kangaroo rat (_Dipodomys  spectabilis spectabilis_ Merriam), although it was observed also that  jack rabbits of two species (_Lepus californicus eremicus_ Allen and _L.  alleni alleni_ Mearns), which were very abundant in some portions of the  reserve, were apparently affecting adversely the forage conditions in  particular localities. Accordingly, the Biological Survey, the  Agricultural Experiment Station of the University of Arizona, the  Carnegie Institution of Washington, and the U. S. Forest Service have  undertaken a study of the relation of the more important rodents to the  forage crop of the Range Reserve in Arizona.    The present paper is a first step in this larger investigation.[2] In  this work the authors have made no attempt to deal with the taxonomic  side of the kangaroo rat problem. It is not unlikely that intensive  studies will show that the form now known as _Dipodomys spectabilis  spectabilis_ is made up of a number of local variants, some of them  perhaps worthy of recognition as additional subspecies. But it is felt  that the conclusions here reached will be little, if at all, affected by  such developments.    Color descriptions are based on Ridgway's Color Standards and Color  Nomenclature published in 1912.

There are only three groups of mammals in the Southwest having external  cheek pouches. These are (_a_) the pocket gophers (Geomyidae), which have  strong fore feet, relatively weak hind feet, and short tail, as compared  with weak fore feet, relatively strong hind feet, and long tail in the  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17987"],[0,"The Mound Builders (#1)"],[1,"images generously made available by Early Canadiana Online  (http://www.canadiana.org/eco/index.html)        Note: Project Gutenberg also has an HTML version of this        file which includes the original illustrations.

A Lost Race Described by Dr. Bryce, President of the Historical  Society.    SEASON 1884-85      Ours are the only mounds making up a distinct mound-region on Canadian  soil. This comes to us as a part of the large inheritance which we who  have migrated to Manitoba receive. No longer cribbed, cabined, and  confined, we have in this our \"greater Canada\" a far wider range of  study than in the fringe along the Canadian lakes. Think of a thousand  miles of prairie! The enthusiastic Scotsman was wont to despise our  level Ontario, because it had no Grampians, but the mountains of  Scotland all piled together would reach but to the foot hills of our  Rockies. The Ontario geologist can only study the rocks in garden  plots, while the Nor'wester revels in the age of reptiles in his  hundreds of miles of Cretaceous rocks, with the largest coal and iron  area on the continent. As with our topography so with history. The  career of the Hudson's Bay Company, which is in fact the history of  Rupert's Land, began 120 years before the history of Ontario, and  there were forts of the two rival Fur Companies on the Saskatchewan  and throughout the country, before the first U. E. Loyalist felled a  forest tree in Upper Canada. We are especially fortunate in being the  possessors also of a field for archaeological study in the portion of  the area occupied by the mound builders--the lost race, whose fate has  a strange fascination for all who enquire into the condition of  Ancient America.    The Indian guide points out these mounds to the student of history  with a feeling of awe; he says he knows nothing of them; his fathers  have told him that the builders of the mounds were of a different race  from them--that the mounds are memorials of a vanished people--the  \"Ke-te-anish-i-na-be,\" or \"very ancient men.\" The oldest Hudson's Bay  officer, and the most intelligent of the native people, born in the  country, can only give some vague story of their connection with a  race who perished with small-pox, but who, or whence, or of what  degree of civilization they were, no clue is left.    It must be said moreover that a perusal of the works written about the  mounds, especially of the very large contributions to the subject  found in the Smithsonian Institution publications, leaves the mind of  the reader in a state of thorough confusion and uncertainty. Indeed,  the facts relating to the Mound Builders are as perplexing a problem  as the purpose of the Pyramids, or the story of King Arthur.    Is it any wonder that we hover about the dark mystery, and find in our  researches room for absorbing study, even though we cannot reach  absolute certainty? Could you have seen the excitement which prevailed  among the half-dozen settlers, I had employed in digging the mound on  Rainy River, in August last, when the perfect pottery cup figured  below was found, and the wild enthusiasm with which they prosecuted  their further work, you would have said it requires no previous  training, but simply a successful discovery or two to make any one a  zealous mound explorer.    A MOUND DESCRIBED.    A mound of the kind found in our region is a very much flattened cone,  or round-topped hillock of earth. It is built usually, if not  invariably where the soil is soft and easily dug, and it is generally  possible to trace in its neighborhood the depression whence the mound  material has been taken. The mounds are as a rule found in the midst  of a fertile section of country, and it is pretty certain from this  that the mound builders were agriculturists, and chose their dwelling  places with their occupation in view, where the mounds are found. The  mounds are found accordingly on the banks of the Rainy River and Red  River, and their affluents in the Northwest, in other words upon our  best land stretches, but not so far as observed around the Lake of the  Woods, or in barren regions. Near fishing grounds they greatly abound.  What seem to have been strategic points upon the river were selected  for their sites. The promontory giving a view and so commanding a  considerable stretch of river, the point at the junction of two  rivers, or the debouchure of a river into a lake or vice versa is a  favorite spot. At the Long Sault on Rainy River there are three or  four mounds grouped together along a ridge. Here some persons of  strong imagination profess to see remains of an ancient fortification,  but to my mind this is mere fancy. Mounds in our region vary from 6 to  50 feet in height, and from 60 to 130 feet in diameter. Some are  circular at the base, others are elliptical.    MOUND REGIONS.    The mounds have long been known as occurring in Central America, in  Mexico, and along the whole extent of the Mississippi valley from the  Gulf of Mexico to the great lakes. Our Northwest has, however, been  neglected in the accounts of the mound-bearing region. Along our Red  River I can count some six or eight mounds that have been noted in  late years, and from the banks having been peopled and cultivated I  have little doubt that others have been obliterated. One formerly  stood on the site of the new unfinished Canadian Pacific Hotel in this  city. The larger number of those known are in the neighborhood of the  rapids, 16 or 18 miles below Winnipeg where the fishing is good. In  1879 the Historical Society opened one of these, and obtained a  considerable quantity of remains. It is reported that there are mounds  also on Nettley Creek, a tributary of the lower Red River, also on  Lake Manitoba and some of its affluents. During the past summer it was  my good fortune to visit the Rainy River, which lies some half way of  the distance from Winnipeg to Lake Superior. In that delightful  stretch of country, extending for 90 miles along the river there are  no less than 21 mounds. These I identify with the mounds of Red River.  The communication between Red and Rainy River is effected by ascending  the Red Lake River, and coming by portage to a river running from the  south into Rainy River. Both Red and Rainy River easily connect with  the head waters of the Mississippi. Our region then may be regarded as  a self-contained district including the most northerly settlements of  the strange race who built the mounds. I shall try to connect them  with other branches of the same stock, lying further to the east and  south. For convenience I shall speak of the extinct people who  inhabited our special region as the _Takawgamis_, or farthest north  mound builders.    MOUND VARIETIES.    The thirty or forty mounds discovered up to this time in this region  of the Takawgamis have, so far as examined, a uniform structure. Where  stone could be obtained there is found below the surface of the ground  a triple layer of flat limestone blocks, placed in an imbricated  manner over the remains interred. In one mound, at the point where the  Rainy Lake enters the Rainy River, there is a mound situated on the  property of Mr. Pither, Indian agent, in which there was found on  excavation, a structure of logs some 10 feet square, and from six to  eight feet high. In all the others yet opened the structure has been  simply of earth of various kinds heaped together. It is possible that  the mound containing the log erection may have been for sacrifice, for  the logs are found to have been charred. One purpose of all the mounds  of the Takawgamis was evidently sepulture; and in them all, charcoal  lumps, calcined bones and other evidences of fire are found. It would  seem from their position that all the mounds of this region were for  the purpose of observation as well as sepulture. The two purposes in  no way antagonize. For the better understanding of the whole I have  selected the largest mound of the Takawgamis yet discovered, and will  describe it more minutely.    THE GRAND MOUND.    It is situated on the Rainy River, about 20 miles from the head of  Rainy River. It stands on a point of land where the Missachappa or  Bowstring River and the Rainy River join. There is a dense forest  covering the river bank where the mound is found. The owner of the  land has made a small clearing, which now shows the mound to some  extent to one standing on the deck of a steamer passing on the river.  The distance back from the water's edge is about 50 yards. The mound  strikes you with great surprise as your eye first catches it. Its  crest is covered with lofty trees, which overtop the surrounding  forest. These thriving trees, elm, soft maple, basswood and poplar, 60  or 70 feet high now thrust their root tendrils deep into the aforetime  softened mould. A foot or more of a mass of decayed leaves and other  vegetable matter encases the mound. The brushy surface of the mound  has been cleared by the owner, and the thicket formerly upon it  removed. The circumference of one fine poplar was found to be 4 feet  10 inches; of another tree, 5 feet 6 inches, but the largest had  lately fallen. Around the stump the last measured seven"]]]
