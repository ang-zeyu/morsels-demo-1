THE FUTURE DEVELOPMENT OF ECONOMIC PSYCHOLOGY      NOTES    INDEX          PSYCHOLOGY AND INDUSTRIAL EFFICIENCY          INTRODUCTION          I    APPLIED PSYCHOLOGY      Our aim is to sketch the outlines of a new science which is to  intermediate between the modern laboratory psychology and the problems  of economics: the psychological experiment is systematically to be  placed at the service of commerce and industry. So far we have only  scattered beginnings of the new doctrine, only tentative efforts and  disconnected attempts which have started, sometimes in economic, and  sometimes in psychological, quarters. The time when an exact  psychology of business life will be presented as a closed and  perfected system lies very far distant. But the earlier the attention  of wider circles is directed to its beginnings and to the importance  and bearings of its tasks, the quicker and the more sound will be the  development of this young science. What is most needed to-day at the  beginning of the new movement are clear, concrete illustrations which  demonstrate the possibilities of the new method. In the following  pages, accordingly, it will be my aim to analyze the results of  experiments which have actually been carried out, experiments  belonging to many different spheres of economic life. But these  detached experiments ought always at least to point to a connected  whole; the single experiments will, therefore, always need a general  discussion of the principles as a background. In the interest of such  a wider perspective we may at first enter into some preparatory  questions of theory. They may serve as an introduction which is to  lead us to the actual economic life and the present achievements of  experimental psychology.    It is well known that the modern psychologists only slowly and very  reluctantly approached the apparently natural task of rendering useful  service to practical life. As long as the study of the mind was  entirely dependent upon philosophical or theological speculation, no  help could be expected from such endeavors to assist in the daily  walks of life. But half a century has passed since the study of  consciousness was switched into the tracks of exact scientific  investigation. Five decades ago the psychologists began to devote  themselves to the most minute description of the mental experiences  and to explain the mental life in a way which was modeled after the  pattern of exact natural sciences. Their aim was no longer to  speculate about the soul, but to find the psychical elements and the  constant laws which control their connections. Psychology became  experimental and physiological. For more than thirty years the  psychologists have also had their workshops. Laboratories for  experimental psychology have grown up in all civilized countries, and  the new method has been applied to one group of mental traits after  another. And yet we stand before the surprising fact that all the  manifold results of the new science have remained book knowledge,  detached from any practical interests. Only in the last ten years do  we find systematic efforts to apply the experimental results of  psychology to the needs of society.    It is clear that the reason for this late beginning is not an  unwillingness of the last century to make theoretical knowledge  serviceable to the demands of life. Every one knows, on the contrary,  that the glorious advance of the natural sciences became at the same  time a triumphal march of technique. Whatever was brought to light in  the laboratories of the physicists and chemists, of the physiologists  and pathologists, was quickly transformed into achievements of  physical and chemical industry, of medicine and hygiene, of  agriculture and mining and transportation. No realm of the external  social life remained untouched. The scientists, on the other hand,  felt that the far-reaching practical effect which came from their  discoveries exerted a stimulating influence on the theoretical  researches themselves. The pure search for truth and knowledge was not  lowered when the electrical waves were harnessed for wireless  telegraphy, or the Roentgen rays were forced into the service of  surgery. The knowledge of nature and the mastery of nature have always  belonged together.    The persistent hesitation of the psychologists to make similar  practical use of their experimental results has therefore come from  different causes. The students of mental life evidently had the  feeling that quiet, undisturbed research was needed for the new  science of psychology in order that a certain maturity might be  reached before a contact with the turmoil of practical life would be  advisable. The sciences themselves cannot escape injury if their  results are forced into the rush of the day before the fundamental  ideas have been cleared up, the methods of investigation really tried,  and an ample supply of facts collected. But this very justified  reluctance becomes a real danger if it grows into an instinctive fear  of coming into contact at all with practical life. To be sure, in any  single case there may be a difference of opinion as to when the right  time has come and when the inner consolidation of a new science is  sufficiently advanced for the technical service, but it ought to be  clear that it is not wise to wait until the scientists have settled  all the theoretical problems involved. True progress in every  scientific field means that the problems become multiplied and that  ever new questions keep coming to the surface. If the psychologists  were to refrain from practical application until the theoretical  results of their laboratories need no supplement, the time for applied  psychology would never come. Whoever looks without prejudice on the  development of modern psychology ought to acknowledge that the  hesitancy which was justified in the beginning would to-day be  inexcusable lack of initiative. For the sciences of the mind too, the  time has come when theory and practice must support each other. An  exceedingly large mass of facts has been gathered, the methods have  become refined and differentiated, and however much may still be under  discussion, the ground common to all is ample enough to build upon.    Another important reason for the slowness of practical progress was  probably this. When the psychologists began to work with the new  experimental methods, their most immediate concern was to get rid of  mere speculation and to take hold of actual facts. Hence they regarded  the natural sciences as their model, and, together with the  experimental method which distinguishes scientific work, the  characteristic goal of the sciences was accepted too. This scientific  goal is always the attainment of general laws; and so it happened that  in the first decades after the foundation of psychological  laboratories the general laws of the mind absorbed the entire  attention and interest of the investigators. The result of such an  attitude was, that we learned to understand the working of the typical  mind, but that all the individual variations were almost neglected.  When the various individuals differed in their mental behavior, these  differences appeared almost as disturbances which the psychologists  had to eliminate in order to find the general laws which hold for  every mind. The studies were accordingly confined to the general  averages of mental experience, while the variations from such averages  were hardly included in the scientific account. In earlier centuries,  to be sure, the interest of the psychological observers had been given  almost entirely to the rich manifoldness of human characters and  intelligences and talents. In the new period of experimental work,  this interest was taken as an indication of the unscientific fancies  of the earlier age, in which the curious and the anecdotal attracted  the view. The new science which was to seek the laws was to overcome  such popular curiosity. In this sign experimental psychology has  conquered. The fundamental laws of the ideas and of the attention, of  the memory and of the will, of the feeling and of the emotions, have  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15164"],[0,"Folk Tales Every Child Should Know (#1)"],[1,"[Illustration: An Indian Brave]      FOLK TALES  Every Child Should Know    EDITED BY  Hamilton Wright Mabie    [Illustration]    THE WHAT-EVERY-CHILD-SHOULD-KNOW-LIBRARY    _Published by_    DOUBLEDAY, DORAN & CO., INC., _for_  THE PARENTS' INSTITUTE, INC.  _Publishers of \"The Parents' Magazine\"_  9 EAST 40th STREET, NEW YORK          ACKNOWLEDGMENTS      The editor and publishers wish to express their appreciation to the  following firms for permission to use the material indicated:    To Messrs.

INTRODUCTION      When the traveller looks at Rome for the first time he does not realize  that there have been several cities on the same piece of ground, and  that the churches and palaces and other great buildings he sees to-day  rest on an earlier and invisible city buried in dust beneath the  foundations of the Rome of the Twentieth Century. In like manner, and  because all visible things on the surface of the earth have grown out of  older things which have ceased to be, the world of habits, the ideas,  customs, fancies, and arts, in which we live is a survival of a younger  world which long ago disappeared. When we speak of Friday as an unlucky  day, or touch wood after saying that we have had good luck for a long  time, or take the trouble to look at the new moon over the right  shoulder, or avoid crossing the street while a funeral is passing, we  are recalling old superstitions or beliefs, a vanished world in which  our remote forefathers lived.    We do not realize how much of this vanished world still survives in our  language, our talk, our books, our sculpture and pictures. The plays of  Shakespeare are full of reference to the fancies and beliefs of the  English people in his time or in the times not long before him. If we  could understand all these references as we read, we should find  ourselves in a world as different from the England of to-day as England  is from Austria, and among a people whose ideas and language we should  find it hard to understand.    In those early days there were no magazines or newspapers, and for the  people as contrasted with the scholars there were no books. The most  learned men were ignorant of things which intelligent children know  to-day; only a very few men and women could read or write; and all kinds  of beliefs about animals, birds, witches, fairies, giants, and the  magical qualities of herbs and stones flourished like weeds in a  neglected garden. There came into existence an immense mass of  misinformation about all manner of things; some of it very stupid, much  of it very poetic and interesting. Below the region of exact knowledge  accessible to men of education, lay a region of popular fancies, ideas,  proverbs, and superstitions in which the great mass of men and women  lived, and which was a kind of invisible playground for children. Much  of the popular belief about animals and the world was touched with  imagination and was full of suggestions, illustrations, and pictorial  figures which the poets were quick to use. When the king says to Cranmer  in \"Henry VIII:\" \"Come, come, my lord, you'd spare your spoons,\" he was  thinking of the old custom of giving children at christenings silver or  gilt spoons with handles shaped to represent the figures of the  Apostles. Rich people gave twelve of the \"apostles' spoons;\" people of  more moderate means gave three or four, or only one with the figure of  the saint after whom the child was named. On Lord Mayor's Day in London,  which came in November and is still celebrated, though shorn of much of  its ancient splendour, the Lord Mayor's fool, as part of the  festivities, jumped into a great bowl of custard, and this is what Ben  Jonson had in mind when he wrote:        \"He may, perchance, in tail of a sheriff's dinner,       Skip with a rime o' the table, from near nothing,       And take his almain leap into a custard,       Shall make my lady Maydress and her sisters,       Laugh all their hoods over their shoulders.\"    It was once widely believed that a stone of magical, medicinal qualities  was set in the toad's head, and so Shakespeare wrote:        \"Sweet are the uses of adversity;       Which, like the toad, ugly and venomous,       Wears yet a precious jewel in its head.\"    \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\" is the most wonderful fairy story in the  world, but Shakespeare did not create it out of hand; he found the fairy  part of it in the traditions of the country people. One of his most  intelligent students says: \"He founded his elfin world on the prettiest  of the people's traditions, and has clothed it in the ever-living flower  of his own exuberant fancy.\"    This immense mass of belief, superstition, fancy, is called folk-lore  and is to be found in all parts of the world. These fancies or faiths or  superstitions were often distorted with stories, and side by side with  folk-lore grew up the folk-tales, of which there are so many that a man  might spend his whole life writing them down. They were not made as  modern stories are often made, by men who think out carefully what they  are to say, arrange the different parts so that they go together like  the parts of a house or of a machine, and write them with careful  selection of words so as to make the story vivid and interesting.    The folk-tales were not written out; many of them grew out of single  incidents or little inventions of fancy, and became longer and larger as  they passed from one story-teller to another and were retold generation  after generation.    Men love stories, and for very good reasons, as has been pointed out in  introductions to other volumes in this series; and the more quick and  original the imagination of a race, the more interesting and varied will  be its stories. From the earliest times, long before books were made,  the people of many countries were eagerly listening to the men and women  who could tell thrilling or humorous tales, as in these later days they  read the novels of the writers who know how to tell a story so as to  stir the imagination or hold the"]]]
