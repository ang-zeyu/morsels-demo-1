We're actually juniors. This locker-room is now our property, although  I don't like it as well as the one we had last year.\"    \"We'll get accustomed to it, and it will seem like home inside of two  weeks,\" said Anne Pierson philosophically. \"Everything is bound to  change in this world, you know. 'We must put ourselves in harmony with  the things among which our lot is cast.'\"    \"Well, Marcus Aurelius, we'll try to accept your teaching,\" laughed  Grace, who immediately recognized the quotation as coming from a tiny  \"Marcus Aurelius Year Book\" that Anne kept in her desk and frequently  perused.    \"I wonder what school will bring us this year?\" mused Nora O'Malley, as  she retied her bow for the fifth time before the mirror and critically  surveyed the final effect. \"We had a stormy enough time last year,  goodness knows. Really, girls, it is hard to believe that Miriam Nesbit  and Julia Crosby were at one time the banes of our existence. They come  next to you three girls with me, now.\"    \"I think that we all feel the same about them,\" replied Grace. \"Miriam  is a perfect dear now, and is just as enthusiastic over class matters as  we are.\"    \"It looks as though everything were going to be plain sailing this  year,\" said Jessica. \"There isn't a disturbing element in the class that  I know of. Still, one can never tell.\"    \"Oh, here come Eva Allen and Marian Barber,\" called Grace delightedly,  and rushed over to the newcomers with outstretched hands.    By this time girls began to arrive rapidly, and soon the locker-room  hummed with the sound of fresh, young voices. Coats of tan were compared  and newly acquired freckles deplored, as the girls stood about in  groups, talking of the delights of the summer vacation just ended.    To the readers of \"GRACE HARLOWE'S PLEBE YEAR AT HIGH SCHOOL,\" and  \"GRACE HARLOWE'S SOPHOMORE YEAR AT HIGH SCHOOL,\" the girl chums have  become familiar figures. It will be remembered how Grace Harlowe and her  friends, Nora O'Malley and Jessica Bright, during their freshman year,  became the firm friends of Anne Pierson, the brilliant young girl who won  the freshman prize offered each year to the freshmen by Mrs. Gray. The  reader will recall the repeated efforts of Miriam Nesbit, aided by Miss  Leece, the algebra teacher, to disgrace Anne in the eyes of the faculty,  and the way each attempt was frustrated by Grace Harlowe and her  friends. Mrs. Gray's house party, the winter picnic in Upton Wood, and  Anne Pierson's struggles to escape her unworthy father all contributed  toward making the story stand out in the reader's mind.    In \"GRACE HARLOWE'S SOPHOMORE YEAR,\" the girl chums were found leading  their class in athletics. Here, Miriam Nesbit, still unsubdued, endeavored  once more to humiliate Anne Pierson, and to oust Grace from her position  as captain of the basketball team, being aided in her plan by Julia  Crosby, captain of the junior team, against whom the sophomores had  engaged to play a series of three games. Grace's brave rescue of Julia  Crosby during a skating party and the latter's subsequent repentance  restored good feeling between the two classes, and the book ended with  the final conversion of Miriam after her long and stubbornly nursed  enmity.    David Nesbit's trial flight in his aeroplane, Grace's encounter with the  escaped lunatic, who imagined himself to be Napoleon Bonaparte, were  among the features which made the book absorbing from start to finish.    The clang of the first bell broke in upon the chattering groups, and  obedient to its summons, the girls moved slowly out of the locker-room  and down the corridor, talking in subdued tones as they strolled toward  the study hall.    Miss Thompson stood at her desk, serene and smiling, as the girls filed  in.    \"How well Miss Thompson looks,\" whispered Grace to Anne as they neared  their seats. \"Let's go up and see her when this session is over. It's  sure to be short this morning.\"    It was customary on the opening of school for the members of the various  classes to take their seats of the previous year. Then the sections were  rearranged, the seniors taking the seats left by the graduates, and the  other classes moving up accordingly. The first day of school amounted to  really nothing further than being assigned to one's seat and getting  used to the idea of school again. Miss Thompson usually addressed the  girls on the duty of High School students, and the girls went forth full  of new resolutions that last for at least a week.    Grace looked curiously about her. She wondered if there were to be many  new girls that year. The present freshmen, direct from the Grammar  Schools, sat on the front seats looking a trifle awed at the idea of  being academic pupils, and feeling very strange and uncomfortable under  the scrutiny of so many pairs of eyes.    Her glance wandered toward the new sophomore class, as though in search  of some one, her eyes brightening as she caught sight of the brown-eyed  girl who had won the freshman prize the previous June. The latter looked  as helpless and friendless as when Grace first saw her step up on the  platform to receive her money. \"I shall certainly find out more about  that child,\" she decided. \"What is her name? I heard it at commencement,  but I have forgotten it.\"    Taking a leaf from a little note-book that she always carried, Grace  wrote: \"Do you see the freshman-prize girl over among the sophomores?  What is her name? I can't remember.\" Then, folding the paper, she tossed  it to Anne, who nodded; then wrote, \"Mabel Allison,\" and handed it to  the girl sitting opposite her, who obligingly passed it over to Grace.    With a nod of thanks to Anne, Grace glanced at the paper and then at the  owner of the name, who sat with her hands meekly folded on her desk,  listening to Miss Thompson as though her life depended upon hearing  every word that the principal uttered.    \"I want all my girls to try particularly this year to reach a higher  standard than ever before,\" Miss Thompson concluded, \"not only in your  studies, but in your attitude toward one another. Be straightforward  and honorable in all your dealings, girls; so that when the day comes  for you to receive your diplomas and bid Oakdale High School farewell,  you can do so with the proud consciousness that you have been to your  schoolmates just what you would have wished them to be to you. I know of  no better preparation for a happy life than constant observation of the  golden rule.    \"And now I hope I shall have no occasion to deliver another lecture  during the school year,\" said the principal, smiling. \"There can be no  formation of classes to-day, as the bulletins of the various subjects  have just been posted, and will undoubtedly undergo some changes. It  would be advisable, however, to arrange as speedily as possible about  the subjects you intend to take, as we wish to begin recitations by  Friday at the latest, and I dare say the changes made in the schedule  will be slight.\"    Then the work of assigning each class to its particular section of the  study hall began. The seniors moved with evident pride into the places  reserved for the first class, while the freshmen looked visibly relieved  at having any place at all to call their own. Immediately after this the  classes were dismissed, and a general rush was made to the end of the  great room, where the bulletins were posted.    Grace, Nora, Anne and Jessica wished to recite in the same classes as"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17829"],[0,"The Trained Memory (#1)"],[1,"was produced from images generously made available  by The Internet Archive/Million Book Project)                APPLIED PSYCHOLOGY    THE TRAINED MEMORY    _Being the Fourth of a Series of Twelve Volumes on the Applications of  Psychology to the Problems of Personal and Business Efficiency_    BY    WARREN HILTON, A.B., L.L.B.

You come now to a  study of the phenomenon of memory, the instrument by which your mind  retains and makes use of its knowledge, the agency that has power to  resurrect the buried past or power to enfold us in a Paradise of dreams  more perfect than reality.      In the broadest sense, memory is the faculty of the mind by which we  (1) _retain_, (2) _recall_, (3) _picture to the mind's eye_, and (4)  _recognize_ past experiences.    Memory involves, therefore, four elements, _Retention_, _Recall_,  _Imagination_ and _Recognition_.          THE MENTAL TREASURE VAULT AND ITS LOST COMBINATION    [Illustration: Decorative Header]      CHAPTER II    THE MENTAL TREASURE VAULT AND ITS LOST COMBINATION      [Sidenote: _What Everyone Thinks_]    Almost everyone seems to think that we retain in the mind _only_ those  things that we can voluntarily recall; that memory, in other words, is  limited to the power of voluntary reproduction.    This is a profound error. It is an inexcusable error. The daily papers  are constantly reporting cases of the lapse and restoration of memory  that contain all the elements of underlying truth on this subject.    [Sidenote: _Causes of Forgetfulness_]    It is plain enough that the memory _seems_ decidedly limited in its  scope. This is because our power of voluntary recall is decidedly  limited.    But it does not follow simply because we are without the power to  deliberately recall certain experiences that all mental trace of those  experiences is lost to us.    _Those experiences that we are unable to recall are those that we  disregarded when they occurred because they possessed no special  interest for us. They are there, but no mental associations or  connections with power to awaken them have arisen in consciousness._    [Sidenote: _Seeing with \"Half an Eye\"_]    Things are continually happening all around us that we see with but  \"half an eye.\" They are in the \"fringe\" of consciousness, and we  deliberately ignore them. Many more things come to us in the form of  sense-impressions that clamorously assail our sense-organs, but no  effort of the will is needed to ignore them. We are absolutely  impervious to them and unconscious of them because by the selection of  our life interests we have closed the doors against them.    In either case, whether in the \"fringe\" of consciousness or entirely  outside of consciousness, these unperceived sensations will be found to  be sensory images that have no connection with the present subject of  thought. They therefore attract, and we spare them, no part of our  attention.    Just as each of our individual sense-organs selects from the multitude  of ether vibrations constantly beating upon the surface of the body only  those waves to the velocity of which it is attuned, so each one of us as  an integral personality selects from the stream of sensory experiences  only those particular objects of attention that are in some way related  to the present or habitual trend of thought.    [Sidenote: _The Man on Broadway_]    Just consider for a moment the countless number and variety of  impressions that assail the eye and ear of the New Yorker who walks down  Broadway in a busy hour of the day. Yet to how few of these does he pay  the slightest attention. He is in the midst of a cataclysm of sound  almost equal to the roar of Niagara and he does not know it.    Observe how many objects are right now in the corner of your mind's eye  as being within the scope of your vision while your entire attention is  apparently absorbed in these lines. You see these other things, and you  can look back and realize that you have seen them, but you were not  aware of them at the time.    Let two individuals of contrary tastes take a day's outing together.  Both may have during the day practically identical sensory images; but  each one will come back with an entirely different tale to tell of the  day's adventures.    [Sidenote: _Waxen Tablets_]    _All sensory impressions, somehow or other, leave their faint impress on  the waxen tablets of the mind. Few are or can be voluntarily recalled._    Just where and how memories are retained is a mystery. There are  theories that represent sensory experiences as actual physiological  \"impressions\" on the cells of the brain. They are, however, nothing but  theories, and the manner in which the brain, as the organ of the mind,  keeps its record of sensory experiences has never been discovered.  Microscopic anatomy has never reached the point where it could identify  a particular \"idea\" with any one \"cell\" or other part of the brain.    [Sidenote: _Not How, but How Much_]    For us, the important question is not _how_, but _how much_; _not the  manner in which, but the extent to which_, sensory impressions are  preserved. Now, all the evidences indicate that _absolutely every  impression received upon the sensorium is indelibly recorded in the  mind's substance_. A few instances will serve to illustrate the  remarkable power of retention of the human mind.    Sir William Hamilton quotes the following from Coleridge's \"Literaria  Biographia\": \"A young woman of four- or five-and-twenty, who could  neither read nor write, was seized with a nervous fever, during which,  according to the asseverations of all the priests and monks of the  neighborhood, she became 'possessed,' and, as it appeared, by a very  learned devil. She continued incessantly talking Latin, Greek and Hebrew  in very pompous tones, and with most distinct enunciation. Sheets full  of her ravings were taken down from her own mouth, and were found to  consist of sentences coherent and intelligible each for itself but with  little or no connection with each other. Of the Hebrew, a small portion  only could be traced to the Bible; the remainder seemed to be in the  Rabbinical dialect.\"    [Sidenote: _Remembering the Unperceived_]    The case was investigated by a physician, who learned that the girl had  been a waif and had been taken in charge by a Protestant clergyman when  she was nine years old and brought up as his servant. This clergyman had  for years been in the habit of walking up and down a passage of his  house into which the kitchen door opened and at the same time reading to  himself in a loud voice from his favorite book. A considerable number of  these books were still in the possession of his niece, who told the  physician that her uncle had been a very learned man and an accomplished  student of Hebrew. Among the books were found a collection of Rabbinical  writings, together with several of the Greek and Latin fathers; and the  physician succeeded in identifying so many passages in these books with  those taken down at the bed-side of the young woman that there could be  no doubt as to"]]]
