Copyright, 1896, by AMERICAN BOOK COMPANY.  Copyright, 1907 and 1920, by H. H. VAIL.  M'G. REV 5TH EC.  EP 310        PREFACE.    The plan of the revision of McGUFFEY'S FIFTH READER is the same as that  pursued in the other books of the REVISED SERIES. The book has been  considerably enlarged, but the new pieces have been added or substituted  only after the most careful consideration, and where the advantages to be  derived were assured.    It has been the object to obtain as wide a range of leading authors as  possible, to present the best specimens of style, to insure interest in  the subjects, to impart valuable information, and to exert a decided and  healthful moral influence. Thus the essential characteristics of  McGUFFEY'S READERS have been carefully kept intact.    The preliminary exercises have been retained, and are amply sufficient for  drill in articulation, inflection, etc. The additional exercises on these  subjects, formerly inserted between the lessons, have been omitted to make  room for other valuable features of the REVISED SERIES.    A full understanding of the text is necessary in order to read it  properly. As all the books of reference required for this purpose are not  within the reach of the majority of pupils, full explanatory notes have  been given, which, it is believed, will add greatly not only to the  interest of the reading lessons, but also to their usefulness from an  instructive point of view.    The definitions of the more difficult words have been given, as formerly;  and the pronunciation has been indicated by diacritical marks, in  conformity with the preceding books of the REVISED SERIES.    Particular attention is invited to the notices of authors. Comparatively  few pupils have the opportunity of making a separate study of English and  American literature, and the carefully prepared notices in the REVISED  SERIES are designed, therefore, to supply as much information in regard to  the leading authors as is possible in the necessarily limited space  assigned. The publishers have desired to illustrate McGUFFEY'S READERS in  a manner worthy of the text and of the high favor in which they are held  throughout the United States. The most celebrated designers and engravers  of the country have been employed for this purpose.    It has been the privilege of the publishers to submit the REVISIED SERIES  to numerous eminent educators in all parts of the country. To the careful  reviews and criticisms of these gentlemen is due, in a large measure, the  present form of McGUFFEY'S READERS. The value of these criticisms, coming  from practical sources of the highest authority, can not well be  overestimated, and the publishers take this occasion to express their  thanks and their indebtedness to all who have thus kindly assisted them in  this work.    Especial acknowledgment is due to Messrs. Houghton, Osgood  & Co. for their permission to make liberal selections from their  copyright editions of many of the foremost American authors  whose works they publish.        CONTENTS.

These Things will I do       unto them and not forsake them._ Isa. xlii. 16.      BATH:    Printed by W. GYE in Westgate-Street; and sold by T. MILLS,    Bookseller, in King's-Mead-Square.    Price Six-Pence.    1772      TO THE    RIGHT HONOURABLE    The _Countess_ of Huntingdon;    THIS    NARRATIVE    Of my _LIFE_,    And of God's wonderful Dealings with me, is,    (_Through Her LADYSHIP'S Permission_)    _Most Humbly Dedicated,    By her LADYSHIP'S    Most obliged    And obedient Servant,_    JAMES ALBERT.          THE PREFACE to the READER.      This Account of the Life and spiritual Experience of James Albert was  taken from his own Mouth and committed to Paper by the elegant Pen of a  young Lady of the Town of Leominster, for her own private Satisfaction,  and without any Intention at first that it should be made public. But  she has now been prevail'd on to commit it to the Press, both with a  view to serve Albert and his distressed Family, who have the sole  Profits arising from the Sale of it; and likewise as it is apprehended,  this little History contains Matter well worthy the Notice and Attention  of every Christian Reader.    Perhaps we have here in some Degree a Solution of that Question that has  perplex'd the Minds of so many serious Persons, viz. In what Manner will  God deal with those benighted Parts of the World where the Gospel of  Jesus Christ hath never reach'd? Now it appears from the Experience of  this remarkable Person, that God does not save without the Knowledge of  the Truth; but, with Respect to those whom he hath fore-known, though  born under every outward Disadvantage, and in Regions of the grossest  Darkness and Ignorance, he most amazingly acts upon and influences their  Minds, and in the Course of wisely and most wonderfully appointed  Providences, he brings them to the Means of spiritual Information,  gradually opens to their View the Light of his Truth, and gives them  full Possession and Enjoyment of the inestimable Blessings of his  Gospel. Who can doubt but that the Suggestion so forcibly press'd upon  the Mind of Albert (when a Boy) that there was a Being superior to the  Sun, Moon, and Stars (the Objects of African Idolatry) came from the  Father of Lights, and was, with Respect to him, the First-Fruit of the  Display of Gospel-Glory? His long and perilous Journey to the Coast of  Guinea, where he was sold for a Slave, and so brought into a Christian  Land; shall we consider this as the alone Effect of a curious and  inquisitive Disposition? Shall we in accounting for it refer to nothing  higher than mere Chance and accidental Circumstances? Whatever Infidels  and Deists may think; I trust the Christian Reader will easily discern  an All-wise and Omnipotent Appointment and Direction in these Movements.  He belong'd to the Redeemer of lost Sinners; he was the Purchase of his  Cross; and therefore the Lord undertook to bring him by a Way that he  knew not, out of Darkness into his marvellous Light, that he might lead  him to a saving Heart-Acquaintance and Union with the triune God in  Christ reconciling the World unto himself; and not imputing their  Trespasses. As his Call was very extraordinary, so there are certain  Particulars exceedingly remarkable in his Experience. God has put  singular Honour upon him in the Exercise of his Faith and Patience,  which in the most distressing and pitiable Trials and Calamities have  been found to the Praise and Glory of God. How deeply must it affect a  tender Heart, not only to be reduc'd to the last Extremity himself, but  to have his Wife and Children perishing for Want before his Eyes! Yet  his Faith did not fail him; he put his Trust in the Lord, and he was  delivered. And at this Instant, though born in an exalted Station of  Life, and now under the Pressure of various afflicting Providences, I am  persuaded (for I know the Man) he would rather embrace the Dung-hill,  having Christ in his Heart, than give up his spiritual Possessions and  Enjoyment, to fill the Throne of Princes. It perhaps may not be amiss to  observe that James Albert left his native Country, (as near as I can  guess from certain Circumstances) when he was about 15 Years old. He now  appears to be turn'd of Sixty; has a good natural Understanding; is well  acquainted with the Scriptures, and the Things of God, has an amiable  and tender Disposition, and his Character can be well attested not only  at Kidderminster, the Place of his Residence but likewise by many  creditable Persons in London and other Places. Reader, recommending this  Narrative to your perusal, and him who is the Subject of it to your  charitable Regard,    I am your faithful and obedient Servant,    For Christ's Sake,    W. Shirley.          AN    ACCOUNT    OF    JAMES ALBERT, &c.      I was born in the city Bournou; my mother was the eldest daughter of the  reigning King there, of which Bournou is the chief city. I was the  youngest of six children, and particularly loved by my mother, and my  grand-father almost doated on me.    I had, from my infancy, a curious turn of mind; was more grave and  reserved in my disposition than either of my brothers and sisters. I  often teazed them with questions they could not answer: for which reason  they disliked me, as they supposed that I was either foolish, or insane.  'Twas certain that I was, at times, very unhappy in myself: it being  strongly impressed on my mind that there was some Great Man of power  which resided above the sun, moon and stars, the objects of our worship.  My dear indulgent mother would bear more with me than any of my friends  beside.--I often raised my hand to heaven, and asked her who lived  there? was much dissatisfied when she told me the sun, moon and stars,  being persuaded, in my own mind, that there must be some Superior  Power.--I was frequently lost in wonder at the works of the Creation:  was afraid and uneasy and restless, but could not tell for what. I  wanted to be informed of things that no person could tell me; and was  always dissatisfied.--These wonderful impressions begun in my childhood,  and followed me continually 'till I left my parents, which affords me  matter of admiration and thankfulness.    To this moment I grew more and more uneasy every day, in so much that  one saturday, (which is the day on which we keep our sabbath) I laboured  under anxieties and fears that cannot be expressed; and, what is more  extraordinary, I could not give a reason for it.--I rose, as our custom  is, about three o'clock, (as we are oblig'd to be at our place of  worship an hour before the sun rise) we say nothing in our worship, but  continue on our knees with our hands held up, observing a strict silence  'till the sun is at a certain height, which I suppose to be about 10 or  11 o'clock in England: when, at a certain sign made by the priest, we  get up (our duty being over) and disperse to our different houses.--Our  place of meeting is under a large palm tree; we divide ourselves into  many congregations; as it is impossible for the same tree to cover the  inhabitants of the whole City, though they are extremely large, high and  majestic; the beauty and usefulness of them are not to be described;  they supply the inhabitants of the country with meat, drink and  clothes;[A] the body of the palm tree is very large; at a certain season  of the year they tap it, and bring vessels to receive the wine, of which  they draw great quantities, the quality of which is very delicious: the  leaves of this tree are of a silky nature; they are large and soft; when  they are dried and pulled to pieces it has much the same appearance as  the English flax, and the inhabitants of Bournou manufacture it for  cloathing &c. This tree likewise produces a plant or substance which has  the appearance of a cabbage, and very like it, in taste almost the same:  it grows between the branches. Also the palm tree produces a nut,  something like a cocoa, which contains a kernel, in which is a large  quantity of milk, very pleasant to the taste: the shell is of a hard  substance, and of a very beautiful appearance, and serves for basons,  bowls, &c.    [Footnote A: It is a generally received opinion, in _England_, that the  natives of _Africa_ go entirely unclothed; but this supposition is very  unjust: they have a kind of dress so as to appear decent, though it is  very slight and thin.]    I hope this digression will be forgiven.--I was going to observe that  after the duty of our Sabbath was over (on the day in which I was more  distressed and afflicted than ever) we were all on our way home as  usual, when a remarkable black cloud arose and covered the sun; then  followed very heavy rain and thunder more dreadful than ever I had  heard: the heav'ns roared, and the earth trembled at it: I was highly  affected and cast down; in so much that I wept sadly, and could not  follow my relations and friends home.--I was obliged to stop and felt  as if my legs were tied, they seemed to shake under me: so I stood  still, being in great fear of the Man of Power that I was persuaded in  myself, lived above. One of my young companions (who entertained a  particular friendship for me and I for him) came back to see for me: he  asked me why I stood still in such very hard rain? I only said to him  that my legs were weak, and I could not come faster: he was much  affected to see me cry, and took me by the hand, and said he would lead  me home, which he did. My mother was greatly alarmed at my tarrying out  in such terrible weather; she asked me many questions, such as what I  did so for, and if I was well?"]]]
