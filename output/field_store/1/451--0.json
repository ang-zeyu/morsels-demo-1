REMY, A.M., Ph.D.    SOMETIME FELLOW IN COMPARATIVE PHILOLOGY  COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY          Copyright 1901, Columbia University Press,  New York    Manufactured in the United States of America          TO  Prof. William H. Carpenter, Ph.D.  Prof. Calvin Thomas, A.M.  Prof. A.V. Williams Jackson, L.H.D., Ph.D.  OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY IN THE CITY OF NEW YORK  IN GRATITUDE          PREFACE.      The Oriental movement which manifested itself so strikingly in German  literature during the nineteenth century is familiar to every student of  that literature. Although the general nature of this movement is pretty  clearly understood, no systematic investigation of it, so far as I know,  has ever been undertaken. In the following pages an attempt is made to  trace the influence which the Indo-Iranian East--the Semitic part is not  considered--exerted on German poetry. The work does not claim to be  exhaustive in the sense that it gives a list of all the poets that ever  came under that influence. Nor does it pretend to be anything like a  complete catalogue of the sources whence the poets derived their  material. The performance of such a task would have required far more  time and space than were at my disposal. A selection was absolutely  necessary. It is hoped that the material presented in the case of each  poet is sufficient to give a clear idea of the extent to which he was  subject to Oriental influence, as well as of the part that he took in  the movement under discussion.    It is my pleasant duty to acknowledge the obligations under which I am  to various scholars. In the first place, my sincere thanks are due to  Professor Jackson, at whose suggestion this investigation was undertaken  and whose encouragement and advice have never been wanting. I am also  indebted for helpful suggestions to Professors Carpenter and Thomas of  the Germanic department, who kindly volunteered to read the  proof-sheets. Furthermore, I wish to thank Mr. Yohannan for assistance  rendered in connection with the transliteration of some of the  lithographic editions of Persian authors. And, finally, I am indebted to  the kindness of Dr. Gray for the use of several rare volumes which  otherwise would have been inaccessible to me.    Arthur F.J. Remy.

For the transcription of Sanskrit words the system of the _Zeitschrift  der Deutschen Morgenlaendischen Gesellschaft_ has been followed; for that  of Persian words the system of the Grundriss der iranischen Philologie  has been adopted, with some variations however, e.g. [Arabic] is indicated by  '. To be consistent, such familiar names as Hafiz and Nizami appear as  Hafid and Nidami; Omar Khayyam as 'Umar Xayyam; and the word ghazal,  the German _Ghasele_, is written _gazal_.

I turned and looked across the room. The window had been widely opened  when I entered, and a faint fog haze hung in the apartment, seeming to  veil the light of the shaded lamp. I watched the closed door intently,  expecting every moment to see the knob turn. But nothing happened.    \"Who's there?\" I cried again, and, crossing the room, I threw open the  door.    The long corridor without, lighted only by one inhospitable lamp at a  remote end, showed choked and yellowed with this same fog so  characteristic of London in November. But nothing moved to right nor  left of me. The New Louvre Hotel was in some respects yet incomplete,  and the long passage in which I stood, despite its marble facings, had  no air of comfort or good cheer; palatial it was, but inhospitable.    I returned to the room, reclosing the door behind me, then for some  five minutes or more I stood listening for a repetition of that  mysterious sound, as of something that both dragged and tapped, which  already had arrested my attention. My vigilance went unrewarded. I  had closed the window to exclude the yellow mist, but subconsciously I  was aware of its encircling presence, walling me in, and now I found  myself in such a silence as I had known in deserts but could scarce  have deemed possible in fog-bound London, in the heart of the world's  metropolis, with the traffic of the Strand below me upon one side and  the restless life of the river upon the other.    It was easy to conclude that I had been mistaken, that my nervous  system was somewhat overwrought as a result of my hurried return from  Cairo--from Cairo where I had left behind me many a fondly cherished  hope. I addressed myself again to the task of unpacking my  steamer-trunk and was so engaged when again a sound in the corridor  outside brought me upright with a jerk.    A quick footstep approached the door, and there came a muffled rapping  upon the panel.    This time I asked no question, but leapt across the room and threw the  door open. Nayland Smith stood before me, muffled up in a heavy  traveling coat, and with his hat pulled down over his brows.    \"At last!\" I cried, as my friend stepped in and quickly reclosed the  door.    Smith threw his hat upon the settee, stripped off the great-coat, and  pulling out his pipe began to load it in feverish haste.    \"Well,\" I said, standing amid the litter cast out from the trunk, and  watching him eagerly, \"what's afoot?\"    Nayland Smith lighted his pipe, carelessly dropping the match-end upon  the floor at his feet.    \"God knows what _is_ afoot this time, Petrie!\" he replied. \"You and I  have lived no commonplace lives; Dr. Fu-Manchu has seen to that; but  if I am to believe what the Chief has told me to-day, even stranger  things are ahead of us!\"    I stared at him wonder-stricken.    \"That is almost incredible,\" I said; \"terror can have no darker  meaning than that which Dr. Fu-Manchu gave to it. Fu-Manchu is dead,  so what have we to fear?\"    \"We have to fear,\" replied Smith, throwing himself into a corner of  the settee, \"the Si-Fan!\"    I continued to stare, uncomprehendingly.    \"The Si-Fan----\"    \"I always knew and you always knew,\" interrupted Smith in his short,  decisive manner, \"that Fu-Manchu, genius that he was, remained  nevertheless the servant of another or others. He was not the head of  that organization which dealt in wholesale murder, which aimed at  upsetting the balance of the world. I even knew the name of one, a  certain mandarin, and member of the Sublime Order of the White Peacock,  who was his immediate superior. I had never dared to guess at the  identity of what I may term the Head Center.\"    He ceased speaking, and sat gripping his pipe grimly between his teeth,  whilst I stood staring at him almost fatuously. Then--    \"Evidently you have much to tell me,\" I said, with forced calm.    I drew up a chair beside the settee and was about to sit down.    \"Suppose you bolt the door,\" jerked my friend.    I nodded, entirely comprehending, crossed the room and shot the little  nickel bolt into its socket.    \"Now,\" said Smith as I took my seat, \"the story is a fragmentary one  in which there are many gaps. Let us see what we know. It seems that  the despatch which led to my sudden recall (and incidentally yours)  from Egypt to London and which only reached me as I was on the point  of embarking at Suez for Rangoon, was prompted by the arrival here of  Sir Gregory Hale, whilom attache at the British Embassy, Peking. So  much, you will remember, was conveyed in my instructions.\"    \"Quite so.\"    \"Furthermore, I was instructed, you'll remember, to put up at the New  Louvre Hotel; therefore you came here and engaged this suite whilst I  reported to the chief. A stranger business is before us, Petrie, I  verily believe, than any we have known hitherto. In the first place,  Sir Gregory Hale is here----\"    \"Here?\"    \"In the New Louvre Hotel. I ascertained on the way up, but not by  direct inquiry, that he occupies a suite similar to this, and  incidentally on the same floor.\"    \"His report to the India Office, whatever its nature, must have been  a sensational one.\"    \"He has made no report to the India Office.\"    \"What! made no report?\"    \"He has not entered any office whatever, nor will he receive any  representative. He's been playing at Robinson Crusoe in a private  suite here for close upon a fortnight--_id est_ since the time of his  arrival in London!\"    I suppose my growing perplexity was plainly visible, for Smith  suddenly burst out with his short, boyish laugh.    \"Oh! I told you it was a strange business,\" he cried.    \"Is he mad?\"    Nayland Smith's gaiety left him; he became suddenly stern and grim.    \"Either mad, Petrie, stark raving mad, or the savior of the Indian  Empire--perhaps of all Western civilization. Listen. Sir Gregory Hale,  whom I know slightly and who honors me, apparently, with a belief that  I am the only man in Europe worthy of his confidence, resigned his  appointment at Peking some time ago, and set out upon a private  expedition to the Mongolian frontier with the avowed intention of  visiting some place in the Gobi Desert. From the time that he actually  crossed the frontier he disappeared for nearly six months, to reappear  again suddenly and dramatically in London. He buried himself in this  hotel, refusing all visitors and only advising the authorities of his  return by telephone. He demanded that _I_ should be sent to see him;  and--despite his eccentric methods--so great is the Chief's faith in  Sir Gregory's knowledge of matters Far Eastern, that behold, here I am.\"    He broke off abruptly and sat in an attitude of tense listening. Then--    \"Do you hear anything, Petrie?\" he rapped.    \"A sort of tapping?\" I inquired, listening intently myself the while.    Smith nodded his head rapidly.    We both listened for some time, Smith with his head bent slightly  forward and his pipe held in his hands; I with my gaze upon the bolted  door. A faint mist still hung in the room, and once I thought I  detected a slight sound from the bedroom beyond, which was in darkness.  Smith noted me turn my head, and for a moment the pair of us stared  into the gap of the doorway. But the silence was complete.    \"You have told me neither much nor little, Smith,\" I said, resuming  for some reason, in a hushed voice. \"Who or what is this Si-Fan at  whose existence you hint?\"    Nayland Smith smiled grimly.    \"Possibly the real and hitherto unsolved riddle of Tibet, Petrie,\" he  replied--\"a mystery concealed from the world behind the veil of  Lamaism.\" He stood up abruptly, glancing at a scrap of paper which he  took from his pocket--\"Suite Number 14a,\" he said. \"Come along! We have  not a moment to waste. Let us make our presence known to Sir Gregory--  the man who has dared to raise that veil.\"          CHAPTER II    THE MAN WITH THE LIMP      \"Lock the door!\" said Smith significantly, as we stepped into the  corridor.    I did so and had turned to join my friend when, to the accompaniment  of a sort of hysterical muttering, a door further along, and on the  opposite side of the corridor, was suddenly thrown open, and a man  whose face showed ghastly white in the light of the solitary lamp  beyond, literally hurled himself out. He perceived Smith and myself  immediately. Throwing one glance back over his shoulder he came  tottering forward to meet us.    \"My God! I can't stand it any longer!\" he babbled, and threw himself  upon Smith, who was foremost, clutching pitifully at him for support.  \"Come and see him, sir--for Heaven's sake come in! I think he's dying;  and he's going mad. I never disobeyed an order in my life before, but  I can't help myself--I can't help myself!\"    \"Brace up!\" I cried, seizing him by the shoulders as, still clutching  at Nayland Smith, he turned his ghastly face to me. \"Who are you, and  what's your trouble?\"    \"I'm Beeton, Sir Gregory Hale's man.\"    Smith started visibly, and his gaunt, tanned face seemed to me to have  grown perceptively paler.    \"Come on, Petrie!\" he snapped. \"There's some devilry here.\"    Thrusting Beeton aside he rushed in at the open door--upon which, as I  followed him, I had time to note the number, 14a. It communicated with  a suite of rooms almost identical with our own. The sitting-room was  empty and in the utmost disorder, but from the direction of the  principal bedroom came a most horrible mumbling and gurgling sound--a  sound utterly indescribable. For one instant we hesitated at the  threshold--hesitated to face the horror beyond; then almost side by  side we came into the bedroom....    Only one of the two lamps was alight--that above the bed; and on the  bed a man lay"]]]
