Boyd Smith_           BOSTON AND NEW YORK   HOUGHTON, MIFFLIN AND COMPANY  The Riverside Press, Cambridge               1903          _Published October, 1903._          _There are many books written nowadays which will tell you about birds  as folk of the twentieth century see them. They describe carefully the  singer's house, his habits, the number of his little wife's eggs, and  the color of every tiny feather on her pretty wings. But these books  tell you nothing at all about bird-history; about what birds have meant  to all the generations of men, women, and children since the world  began. You would think, to read the words of the bird-book men, that  they were the very first folk to see any bird, and that what they think  they have seen is the only matter worth the knowing._    _Now the interesting facts about birds we have always with us. We can  find them out for ourselves, which is a very pleasant thing to do, or we  can take the word of others, of which there is no lack. But it is the  quaint fancies about birds which are in danger of being lost. The  long-time fancies which the world's children in all lands have been  taught are quite as important as the every-day facts. They show what the  little feathered brothers have been to the children of men; how we have  come to like some and to dislike others as we do; why the poets have  called them by certain nicknames which we ought to know; and why a great  many strange things are so, in the minds of childlike people._    _Facts are not what one looks for in a Curious Book. Yet it may be that  some facts have crept in among the ancient fancies of this volume, just  as bookworms will crawl into the nicest books; but they do not belong  there, and it is for these that the Book apologizes to the children. It  has no apology to offer those grown folks who insist that facts, never  fancies, are what children need._          CONTENTS                                            PAGE    THE DISOBEDIENT WOODPECKER                 1  (_French_)    MOTHER MAGPIE'S KINDERGARTEN               6  (_Isle of Wight_)    THE GORGEOUS GOLDFINCH                    14  (_Roumanian_)    KING OF THE BIRDS                         18  (_Gascon_)    HALCYONE                                  27  (_Greek_)    THE FORGETFUL KINGFISHER                  33  (_German_)    THE WREN WHO BROUGHT FIRE                 39  (_French_)    HOW THE BLUEBIRD CROSSED                  45  (_Samoan_)    THE PEACOCK'S COUSIN                      49  (_Arabic, Malay_)    THE MASQUERADING CROW                     59  (_Russian_)    KING SOLOMON AND THE BIRDS                69  (_Arabic_)    THE PIOUS ROBIN                           81  (_Breton, Basque, Greek_)    THE ROBIN WHO WAS AN INDIAN               87  (_Ojibway_)    THE INQUISITIVE WOMAN                     94  (_Roumanian_)    WHY THE NIGHTINGALE WAKES                 98  (_French_)    MRS.

There were no hills nor  mountains: nor were there any hollows or valleys to hold the seas and  rivers, fountains and pools, which the world of men would need. It must,  indeed, have been a stupid and ugly earth in those days, with no chance  for swimming or sailing, rowing or fishing. But as yet there was no one  to think anything about it, no one who would long to swim, sail, row,  and fish. For this was long before men were created.    The Lord looked about Him at the flocks of newly made birds, who were  preening their wings and wondering at their own bright feathers, and  said to Himself,--    \"I will make these pretty creatures useful, from the very beginning, so  that in after time men shall love them dearly. Come, my birds,\" He  cried, \"come hither to me, and with the beaks which I have given you  hollow me out _here_, and _here_, and _here_, basins for the lakes and  pools which I intend to fill with water for men and for you, their  friends. Come, little brothers, busy yourselves as you would wish to be  happy hereafter.\"    Then there was a twittering and fluttering as the good birds set to work  with a will, singing happily over the work which their dear Lord had  given them to do. They pecked and they pecked with their sharp little  bills; they scratched and they scratched with their sharp little claws,  till in the proper places they had hollowed out great basins and valleys  and long river beds, and little holes in the ground.    Then the Lord sent great rains upon the earth until the hollows which  the birds had made were filled with water, and so became rivers and  lakes, little brooks and fountains, just as we see them to-day. Now it  was a beautiful, beautiful world, and the good birds sang happily and  rejoiced in the work which they had helped, and in the sparkling water  which was sweet to their taste.    All were happy except one. The Woodpecker had taken no part with the  other busy birds. She was a lazy, disobedient creature, and when she  heard the Lord's commands she had only said, \"Tut tut!\" and sat still on  the branch where she had perched, preening her pretty feathers and  admiring her silver stockings. \"You can toil if you want to,\" she said  to the other birds who wondered at her, \"but I shall do no such dirty  work. My clothes are too fine.\"    Now when the world was quite finished and the beautiful water sparkled  and glinted here and there, cool and refreshing, the Lord called the  birds to Him and thanked them for their help, praising them for their  industry and zeal. But to the Woodpecker He said,--    \"As for you, O Woodpecker, I observe that your feathers are unruffled by  work and that there is no spot of soil upon your beak and claws. How did  you manage to keep so neat?\"    The Woodpecker looked sulky and stood upon one leg.    \"It is a good thing to be neat,\" said the Lord, \"but not if it comes  from shirking a duty. It is good to be dainty, but not from laziness.  Have you not worked with your brothers as I commanded you?\"    \"It was such very dirty work,\" piped the Woodpecker crossly; \"I was  afraid of spoiling my pretty bright coat and my silver shining hose.\"    \"Oh, vain and lazy bird!\" said the Lord sadly. \"Have you nothing to do  but show off your fine clothes and give yourself airs? You are no more  beautiful than many of your brothers, yet they all obeyed me willingly.  Look at the snow-white Dove, and the gorgeous Bird of Paradise, and the  pretty Grosbeak. They have worked nobly, yet their plumage is not  injured. I fear that you must be punished for your disobedience, little  Woodpecker. Henceforth you shall wear stockings of sooty black instead  of the shining silver ones of which you are so proud. You who were too  fine to dig in the earth shall ever be pecking at dusty wood. And as you  declined to help in building the water-basins of the world, so you shall  never sip from them when you are thirsty. Never shall you thrust beak  into lake or river, little rippling brook or cool, sweet fountain.  Raindrops falling scantily from the leaves shall be your drink, and your  voice shall be heard only when other creatures are hiding themselves  from the approaching storm.\"    It was a sad punishment for the Woodpecker, but she certainly deserved  it. Ever since that time, whenever we hear a little tap-tapping in the  tree city, we know that it is the poor Woodpecker digging at the dusty  wood, as the Lord said she should do. And when we spy her, a dusty  little body with black stockings, clinging upright to the tree trunk, we  see that she is creeping, climbing, looking up eagerly toward the sky,  longing for the rain to fall into her thirsty beak. She is always hoping  for the storm to come, and plaintively pipes, \"_Plui-plui!_ Rain, O  Rain!\" until the drops begin to patter on the leaves."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16145"],[0,"Journals of Two Expeditions of Discovery in North-West and Western Australia, (#1)"],[1,"OF    TWO EXPEDITIONS OF DISCOVERY    IN    NORTH-WEST AND WESTERN    AUSTRALIA,    DURING THE YEARS 1837, 1838, AND 1839,    Under the Authority of Her Majesty's Government.
