He soon obtained profitable employment, producing engravings  both of figures and views in rapid succession, and about 1639 he was  appointed drawing-master to the Prince of Wales, afterwards Charles  II. On the outbreak of the Civil War he served as a soldier in the  Royalist ranks, and was taken prisoner at Basing House, but escaped to  Antwerp. Obtaining very poor employment there, he returned to England  in 1652, and was engaged upon the plates for Dugdale's _History of St.  Paul's_ and other works, for which, however, he is said by Vertue to  have received very small pay, about fourpence an hour, \"at his usual  method by the hour-glass.\"    Some years later the Plague and the Fire again threw him out of  employment, and he seems to have sunk deeper and deeper into poverty,  dying in 1677, with an execution in his house, \"of which he was  sensible enough to desire only to die in his bed, and not to be  removed till he was buried.\" He lies in the churchyard of St.  Margaret's, Westminster, but there is no stone to his memory.    In the course of his industrious life he is said to have produced more  than 2000 engravings and etchings. \"He worked,\" says Redgrave, \"with  extraordinary minuteness of finish, yet with an almost playful  freedom.\" His engravings of Old St. Paul's, though not entirely  accurate, undoubtedly give a true general view of the Cathedral as it  was in its last years, after the alterations and additions by Inigo  Jones, and nearly a century after the fall of the spire.

London was  probably a place of some importance in those days, though there is  no mention of it in Caesar's narrative, written some eighty years  previously. Dr. Guest brought forward reasons for supposing that at  the conquest the General Aulus Plautius chose London as a good spot  on which to fortify himself, and that thus a military station was  permanently founded on the site of the present cathedral, as being  the highest ground. If so, we may call that the beginning of historic  London, and the Romans, being still heathen, would, we may be sure,  have a temple dedicated to the gods close by. Old tradition has  it that the principal temple was dedicated to Diana, and it is no  improbable guess that this deity was popular with the incomers,  who found wide and well-stocked hunting grounds all round the  neighbourhood. Ages afterwards, in the days of Edward III., were  found, in the course of some exhumations, vast quantities of bones  of cattle and stags' horns, which were assumed to be the remains of  sacrifices to the goddess. So they may have been; we have no means of  knowing. An altar to Diana was found in 1830 in Foster Lane, close by,  which is now in the Guildhall Museum.    But not many years can have passed before Christianity had obtained  a footing among the Roman people; we know not how. To use Dr.  Martineau's expressive similitude, the Faith was blown over the world  silently like thistle-seed, and as silently here and there it fell and  took root. We know no more who were its first preachers in Rome than  we do who they were in Britain. It was in Rome before St. Paul arrived  in the city, for he had already written his Epistle to the Romans; but  evidently he made great impression on the Praetorian soldiers. And we  may be sure that there were many \"of this way\" in the camp in London  by the end of the first century. For the same reason we may take it  for granted that there must have been a place of worship, especially  as before the Romans left the country Christianity was established as  the religion of the Empire. Only two churches of the Roman period in  England can now be traced with certainty. Mr. St. John Hope and his  fellow-explorers a few years ago unearthed one at Silchester, and the  foundations of another may be seen in the churchyard of Lyminge in  Kent.    And this is really all we can say about the Church in London during  the Roman occupation. The story of King Lucius and that of the  church of St. Peter in Cornhill are pure myths, without any sort of  historical foundation, and so may be dismissed without more words.    The Romans went away in the beginning of the fifth century, and by the  end of the same century the English conquest had been almost entirely  accomplished. For awhile the new comers remained heathens; then came  Augustine and his brother monks, and began the conversion of the  English people to Christ. The king of Kent was baptized in 596, and  Canterbury became the mother church. Pope Gregory the Great sent  Augustine a reinforcement of monks in 601. Two of these, Laurentius  and Mellitus, were consecrated by Augustine as missionary bishops to  convert West Kent and the East Saxon Kingdom to the faith. The chief  town of the former district was Rochester, and of the latter London.  This city had much grown in importance, having established a busy  trade with the neighbouring states both by land and sea. The king of  the East Saxons was Sebert, nephew of Ethelbert of Kent, and subject  to him. He, therefore, received Mellitus with cordiality, and as soon  as he established his work in the city, King Ethelbert built him a  church wherein to hold his episcopal see, and, so it is said, endowed  it with the manor of Tillingham, which is still the property of the  Dean and Chapter of St. Paul's. There is no portion of that old church  remaining. It was in all probability built mostly of wood, and it  perished by fire, as so many Anglo-Saxon churches did, on July 7th,  1087. Some historical incidents connected with that early building  will be found on a subsequent page.    In the year before this calamity (April 5th, 1086), Maurice, chaplain  and chancellor to William the Conqueror, had been consecrated  Bishop of London by Lanfranc.

Smith,  For the Deseret Sunday School Union_.          To Parents and Teachers.      Studying the history of our country creates patriotism and engenders  loyalty. For the same reason, a study of the history of the Church of Jesus  Christ of Latter-day Saints will implant in our boys and girls a love for  its heroes, a loyalty to its principles, and an appreciation of its  achievements. By a knowledge of the history of the Church, our young people  will prize more highly that heritage given them of God and preserved for  them by the sweat and blood of their fathers.    The teacher using this little book will understand that it is not  exhaustive, but rather suggestive. The teacher should be in possession of  much more history than is given here. He should fill in much of the  undercurrent of heroism, faith, and devotion exhibited by the characters of  the history, very little of which can be given in the text. The importance  of this larger knowledge on the part of the teacher will be understood by  an examination of the review and questions at the end of each chapter. The  aim in these questions is not only to review the facts of the lesson, but  by suggestions and reference to bring out more fully deductions and  principles.    It is believed that by combining the topical and the question methods the  best results may be obtained. The topics are to be assigned certain pupils  for treatment. Questions should not be limited to those in the book. The  teacher should find many more to ask.    Special attention is called to the maps. Have pupils locate each important  place. Quite a number of dates are found in the text. It is not intended  that the pupils should memorize them all. Most of them should be used  merely in fixing the relative time between events. It is suggested that the  pupils be encouraged to refer to the Church works and other books mentioned  in the text.    For further preparation the teacher is referred to \"The History of the  Church,\" \"Cannon's Life of Joseph Smith,\" \"Whitney's History of Utah.\" The  \"Faith Promoting Series,\" Evan's \"Hundred Years of Mormonism,\" etc., will  give much interesting and valuable information.

CHAPTER I.    A PARABLE.      Once upon a time the owner of a very large garden planted therein a tree,  the fruit of which was very precious and of great value to all who ate of  it. For a time, the tree grew and bore much good fruit. But the owner of  the garden had an enemy who went about secretly sowing seeds of weeds and  all manner of briers and brush, that they might spread all over the garden  and kill out the good tree which the master had planted. The enemy also  persuaded many of the workmen in the garden to neglect the good tree, and  let the briers and weeds grow up around it and so prevent its growth. Thus  in time the once precious fruit of the good tree became wild and scrubby,  no better than the enemy's trees which grew around it.    Years passed, and the master, grieving that the precious fruit should have  become so worthless, determined to plant the good tree once more in the  garden. He did not try to clear away a spot for it amid the old, overgrown  parts of the land, but he called upon certain workers to go to a distant  part of the garden where nothing had been planted for a long time, and  there prepare the ground for the planting of the tree.    These workers were faithful to their master and did as they were told. Very  few of the enemy's noxious weeds were growing in the new soil, so it was  not such hard work to clear the ground and prepare a place for the master  to plant his tree.    To be better protected against the enemy, the master told his workmen to  build a high, strong wall about that part of the garden. This was all done;  and then one beautiful spring day the owner came with his servants. They  had with them the precious tree taken from some other garden where it had  grown without hindrance from weeds. The tree was planted and put in charge  of other servants to tend it. The warm sun shone on it, the rains came from  heaven to water it, and the tree took firm root and grew.    Now all the boys and girls who read this book will understand that the  little story I have just told is what is called a _Parable_, meant to make  plainer some facts and truths. I can not tell you all about that tree here,  how it grew and bore fruit, and how many people came and ate of its  delicious fruit, notwithstanding the enemy came again and tried to check  its growth. I say, I cannot tell it to you in the form of a parable, but  will tell it as it actually happened. You may, if you like, imagine in your  own minds the rest of the parable, but the real story you will find more  interesting than any made-up tale can be.    First, let me explain to you the meaning of the parable.    The garden means the earth, and the owner is the Lord, who came to the  earth about nineteen hundred years ago to die for the sins of the world. He  also planted the good tree, that is, He brought the gospel and taught it  to his followers. The enemy is the evil one, the devil, who stirred up men  to work against the gospel and to kill those who obeyed it. He also mixed  his lies with Christ's truths, until in time the pure gospel was not to be  found on the earth.    This was the condition of the world for hundreds of years. Then the Lord  wished to restore the true gospel and again establish his Church on the  earth. He therefore chose a place where all would have the right to believe  the truth and be protected in that liberty. The Lord, therefore, moved upon  Columbus to discover this land of America.    The servants spoken of, whom the Lord sent to prepare the land for the  planting, were all those great and good men whom you have read about in  your American history: Washington, Jefferson, Franklin, and many others.  You will remember how these men loved right and liberty, and how they  worked so hard for it; and in reading the history of these men we can  plainly see that the Lord was with them and helped them. These men built  the high wall, which means that they made just laws that would protect the  people and let them worship God in any way they thought right.    Thus was the way prepared for the gospel to be restored again to the earth;  and the Lord himself came from heaven, also his servants Moroni, Peter,  James, and John to bring the glad tidings to all who live on the earth.    Then the Lord called some more servants to preach the gospel to the world  and build up his Church. The first and greatest of these servants is known  by the name of Joseph Smith, the Prophet. How the Lord called him to this  great work and delivered to him the gospel will be told you in the next  chapter.    Topics.--1. The Parable. 2. Explanation.    Questions and Review.--1. Name some of Christ's first disciples. 2: Tell  how some of them were killed. 3. How long was the world without the gospel?  "]]]
