It was thought that I might thus  contribute towards a more intimate knowledge of the glorious heritage  our forefathers have bequeathed to us, than the greater number of them  possess, and towards helping them to understand the characteristics  and requirements of the numerous and widely different races by whom  India is inhabited.    It is difficult for people who know nothing of Natives to understand  and appreciate the value they set on cherished customs, peculiar  idiosyncrasies, and fixed prejudices, all of which must be carefully  studied by those who are placed in the position of their Rulers, if  the suzerain Power is to keep their respect and gain their gratitude  and affection.    The Natives of India are particularly observant of character, and  intelligent in gauging the capabilities of those who govern them; and  it is because the English Government is trusted that a mere handful  of Englishmen are able to direct the administration of a country with  nearly three hundred millions of inhabitants, differing in race,  religion, and manners of life. Throughout all the changes which India  has undergone, political and social, during the present century, this  feeling has been maintained, and it will last so long as the services  are filled by honourable men who sympathize with the Natives, respect  their prejudices, and do not interfere unnecessarily with their habits  and customs.    My father and I spent between us nearly ninety years in India. The  most wonderful of the many changes that took place during that time  may be said to date from the Mutiny. I have endeavoured in the  following pages to explain the causes which, I believe, brought  about that terrible event--an event which for a while produced a  much-to-be-regretted feeling of racial antagonism. Happily, this  feeling did not last long; even when things looked blackest for us, it  was softened by acts of kindness shown to Europeans in distress, and  by the knowledge that, but for the assistance afforded by the Natives  themselves, the restoration of order, and the suppression of a fierce  military insurrection, would have been a far more arduous task. Delhi  could not have been taken without Sikhs and Gurkhas; Lucknow could  not have been defended without the Hindustani soldiers who so nobly  responded to Sir Henry Lawrence's call; and nothing that Sir John  Lawrence might have done could have prevented our losing, for a time,  the whole of the country north of Calcutta, had not the men of the  Punjab and the Derajat[*] remained true to our cause.    [Note *: Tracts beyond the Indus.]    It has been suggested that all outward signs of the Mutiny should  be obliterated, that the monument on the Ridge at Delhi should be  levelled, and the picturesque Residency at Lucknow allowed to fall  into decay. This view does not commend itself to me. These relics of  that tremendous struggle are memorials of heroic services performed  by Her Majesty's soldiers, Native as well as British; and by the  civilians who shared the duties and dangers of the army. They are  valuable as reminders that we must never again allow ourselves to be  lulled into fancied security; and above all, they stand as warnings  that we should never do anything that can possibly be interpreted by  the Natives into disregard for their various forms of religion.    The Mutiny was not an unmitigated evil, for to it we owe the  consolidation of our power in India, as it hastened on the  construction of the roads, railways, and telegraphs, so wisely and  thoughtfully planned by the Marquis of Dalhousie, and which have  done more than anything to increase the prosperity of the people and  preserve order throughout the country. It was the Mutiny which brought  Lord Canning into closer communication with the Princes of India, and  paved the way for Lord Lytton's brilliant conception of the Imperial  Assemblage--a great political success which laid the foundation of  that feeling of confidence which now, happily, exists between the  Ruling Chiefs and the Queen-Empress. And it was the Mutiny which  compelled us to reorganize our Indian Army and make it the admirable  fighting machine it now is.    In the account I have given of our relations with Afghanistan and  the border tribes, I have endeavoured to bring before my readers  the change of our position in India that has been the inevitable  consequence of the propinquity upon our North-West Frontier of a  first-class European Power. The change has come about so gradually,  and has been so repeatedly pronounced to be chimerical by authorities  in whom the people of Great Britain had every reason to feel  confidence, that until recently it had attracted little public  attention, and even now a great majority of my countrymen may scarcely  have realized the probability of England and Russia ever being near  enough to each other in Asia to come into actual conflict. I impute no  blame to the Russians for their advance towards India. The force of  circumstances--the inevitable result of the contact of civilization  with barbarism--impelled them to cross the Jaxartes and extend their  territories to the Khanates of Turkestan and the banks of the Oxus,  just as the same uncontrollable force carried us across the Sutlej and  extended our territories to the valley of the Indus. The object I have  at heart is to make my fellow-subjects recognize that, under these  altered conditions, Great Britain now occupies in Asia the position of  a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1653"],[0,"The Imitation of Christ (#1)"],[1,"IMITATION OF CHRIST    by Thomas a Kempis          Translated by Rev. William Benham          INTRODUCTORY NOTE    The treatise \"Of the Imitation of Christ\" appears to have been  originally written in Latin early in the fifteenth century.  Its  exact date and its authorship are still a matter of debate.  Manuscripts of the Latin version survive in considerable numbers  all over Western Europe, and they, with the vast list of  translations and of printed editions, testify to its almost  unparalleled popularity.  One scribe attributes it to St. Bernard  of Clairvaux; but the fact that it contains a quotation from St.  Francis of Assisi, who was born thirty years after the death of  St. Bernard, disposes of this theory.  In England there exist  many manuscripts of the first three books, called \"Musica  Ecclesiastica,\" frequently ascribed to the English mystic Walter  Hilton.  But Hilton seems to have died in 1395, and there is no  evidence of the existence of the work before 1400.  Many  manuscripts scattered throughout Europe ascribe the book to Jean  le Charlier de Gerson, the great Chancellor of the University of  Paris, who was a leading figure in the Church in the earlier  part of the fifteenth century.  The most probable author,  however, especially when the internal evidence is considered, is  Thomas Haemmerlein, known also as Thomas a Kempis, from his  native town of Kempen, near the Rhine, about forty miles north of  Cologne.  Haemmerlein, who was born in 1379 or 1380, was a member  of the order of the Brothers of Common Life, and spent the last  seventy years of his life at Mount St. Agnes, a monastery of  Augustinian canons in the diocese of Utrecht.  Here he died on  July 26, 1471, after an uneventful life spent in copying  manuscripts, reading, and composing, and in the peaceful routine  of monastic piety.    With the exception of the Bible, no Christian writing has had  so wide a vogue or so sustained a popularity as this.  And yet,  in one sense, it is hardly an original work at all.  Its  structure it owes largely to the writings of the medieval  mystics, and its ideas and phrases are a mosaic from the Bible  and the Fathers of the early Church.  But these elements are  interwoven with such delicate skill and a religious feeling at  once so ardent and so sound, that it promises to remain, what it  has been for five hundred years, the supreme call and guide to  spiritual aspiration.          THE IMITATION OF CHRIST          THE FIRST BOOK        ADMONITIONS PROFITABLE FOR THE SPIRITUAL LIFE    CHAPTER I    Of the imitation of Christ, and of contempt of the world and all  its vanities    He that followeth me shall not walk in darkness,(1) saith the  Lord.  These are the words of Christ; and they teach us how far  we must imitate His life and character, if we seek true  illumination, and deliverance from all blindness of heart.  Let  it be our most earnest study, therefore, to dwell upon the life  of Jesus Christ.    2. His teaching surpasseth all teaching of holy men, and such as  have His Spirit find therein the hidden manna.(2)  But there are  many who, though they frequently hear the Gospel, yet feel but  little longing after it, because they have not the mind of  Christ.  He, therefore, that will fully and with true wisdom  understand the words of Christ, let him strive to conform his  whole life to that mind of Christ.    3. What doth it profit thee to enter into deep discussion  concerning the Holy Trinity, if thou lack humility, and be thus  displeasing to the Trinity?  For verily it is not deep words that  make a man holy and upright; it is a good life which maketh a man  dear to God.  I had rather feel contrition than be skilful in the  definition thereof.  If thou knewest the whole Bible, and the  sayings of all the philosophers, what should all this profit thee  without the love and grace of God?  Vanity of vanities, all is  vanity, save to love God, and Him only to serve.  That is the  highest wisdom, to cast the world behind us, and to reach forward  to the heavenly kingdom.    4. It is vanity then to seek after, and to trust in, the riches  that shall perish.  It is vanity, too, to covet honours, and to  lift up ourselves on high.  It is vanity to follow the desires of  the flesh and be led by them, for this shall bring misery at the  last.  It is vanity to desire a long life, and to have little  care for a good life.  It is vanity to take thought only for the  life which now is, and not to look forward to the things which  shall be hereafter.  It is vanity to love that which quickly  passeth away, and not to hasten where eternal joy abideth.    5. Be ofttimes mindful of the saying,(3) The eye is not satisfied  with seeing, nor the ear with hearing.  Strive, therefore, to  turn away thy heart from the love of the things that are seen,  and to set it upon the things that are not seen.  For they who  follow after their own fleshly lusts, defile the conscience, and  destroy the grace of God.    (1) John viii. 12.   (2) Revelations ii. 17.  (3) Ecclesiastes i. 8.      CHAPTER II    Of thinking humbly of oneself    There is naturally in every man a desire to know, but what  profiteth knowledge without the fear of God?  Better of a surety  is a lowly peasant who serveth God, than a proud philosopher who  watcheth the stars and neglecteth the knowledge of himself.  He  who knoweth himself well is vile in his own sight; neither  regardeth he the praises of men.  If I knew all the things that  are in the world, and were not in charity, what should it help me  before God, who is to judge me according to my deeds?    2. Rest from inordinate desire of knowledge, for therein is found  much distraction and deceit.  Those who have knowledge desire to  appear learned, and to be called wise.  Many things there are to  know which profiteth little or nothing to the soul.  And foolish  out of measure is he who attendeth upon other things rather than  those which serve to his soul's health.  Many words satisfy not  the soul, but a good life refresheth the mind, and a pure  conscience giveth great confidence towards God.    3. The greater and more complete thy knowledge, the more severely  shalt thou be judged, unless thou hast lived holily.  Therefore  be not lifted up by any skill or knowledge that thou hast; but  rather fear concerning the knowledge which is given to thee.  If  it seemeth to thee that thou knowest many things, and  understandest them well, know also that there are many more  things which thou knowest not.  Be not high-minded, but rather  confess thine ignorance.  Why desirest thou to lift thyself above  another, when there are found many more learned and more skilled  in the Scripture than thou?  If thou wilt know and learn anything  with profit, love to be thyself unknown and to be counted for  nothing.    4. That is the highest and most profitable lesson, when a man  truly knoweth and judgeth lowly of himself.  To account nothing  of one's self, and to think always kindly and highly of others,  this is great and perfect wisdom.  Even shouldest thou see thy  neighbor sin openly or grievously, yet thou oughtest not to  reckon thyself better than he, for thou knowest not how long  thou shalt keep thine integrity.  All of us are weak and frail;  hold thou no man more frail than thyself.      CHAPTER III    Of the knowledge of truth    Happy is the man whom Truth by itself doth teach, not by figures  and transient words, but as it is in itself.(1)  Our own  judgment and feelings often deceive us, and we discern but  little of the truth.  What doth it profit to argue about hidden  and dark things, concerning which we shall not be even reproved  in the judgment, because we knew them not?  Oh, grievous folly,  to neglect the things which are profitable and necessary, and to  give our minds to things which are curious and hurtful!  Having  eyes, we see not.    2. And what have we to do with talk about genus and species!  He to whom the Eternal Word speaketh is free from multiplied  questionings.  From this One Word are all things, and all things  speak of Him; and this is the Beginning which also speaketh unto  us.(2)  No man without Him understandeth or rightly judgeth.  The  man to whom all things are one, who bringeth all things to one,  who seeth all things in one, he is able to remain steadfast of  spirit, and at rest in God.  O God, who art the Truth, make me  one with Thee in everlasting love.  It wearieth me oftentimes to  read and listen to many things; in Thee is all that I wish for  and desire.  Let all the doctors hold their peace; let all  creation keep silence before Thee: speak Thou alone to me.    3. The more a man hath unity and simplicity in himself, the more  things and the deeper things he understandeth; and that without  labour, because he receiveth the light of understanding from  above.  The spirit which is pure, sincere, and steadfast, is not  distracted though it hath many works to do, because it doth all  things to the honour of God, and striveth to be free from all  thoughts of self-seeking.  Who is so full of hindrance and  annoyance to thee as thine own undisciplined heart?  A man who is  good and devout arrangeth beforehand within his own heart the  works which he hath to do abroad; and so is not drawn away by the  desires of his evil will, but subjecteth everything to the  judgment of right reason.  Who hath a harder battle to fight  than he who striveth for self-mastery?  And this should be our  endeavour, even to master self, and thus daily to grow stronger  than self, and go on unto perfection.    4. All perfection hath some imperfection joined to it in this  life, and all our power of sight is not without some darkness.  A  lowly knowledge of thyself is a surer way to God than the deep  searching of man's learning.  Not that learning is to be blamed,  nor the taking account of anything that is good; but a good  conscience and a holy life is better than"]]]
