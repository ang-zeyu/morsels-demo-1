THE HAUNTED BOOKSHOP      BY    CHRISTOPHER MORLEY          TO THE BOOKSELLERS    Be pleased to know, most worthy, that this little book is dedicated to  you in affection and respect.    The faults of the composition are plain to you all.  I begin merely in  the hope of saying something further of the adventures of ROGER  MIFFLIN, whose exploits in \"Parnassus on Wheels\" some of you have been  kind enough to applaud.  But then came Miss Titania Chapman, and my  young advertising man fell in love with her, and the two of them rather  ran away with the tale.    I think I should explain that the passage in Chapter VIII, dealing with  the delightful talent of Mr. Sidney Drew, was written before the  lamented death of that charming artist.  But as it was a sincere  tribute, sincerely meant, I have seen no reason for removing it.    Chapters I, II, III, and VI appeared originally in The Bookman, and to  the editor of that admirable magazine I owe thanks for his permission  to reprint.    Now that Roger is to have ten Parnassuses on the road, I am emboldened  to think that some of you may encounter them on their travels.  And if  you do, I hope you will find that these new errants of the Parnassus on  Wheels Corporation are living up to the ancient and honourable  traditions of our noble profession.    CHRISTOPHER MORLEY.    Philadelphia,    April 28, 1919          The Haunted Bookshop        Chapter I    The Haunted Bookshop      If you are ever in Brooklyn, that borough of superb sunsets and  magnificent vistas of husband-propelled baby-carriages, it is to be  hoped you may chance upon a quiet by-street where there is a very  remarkable bookshop.    This bookshop, which does business under the unusual name \"Parnassus at  Home,\" is housed in one of the comfortable old brown-stone dwellings  which have been the joy of several generations of plumbers and  cockroaches.  The owner of the business has been at pains to remodel  the house to make it a more suitable shrine for his trade, which deals  entirely in second-hand volumes.  There is no second-hand bookshop in  the world more worthy of respect.    It was about six o'clock of a cold November evening, with gusts of rain  splattering upon the pavement, when a young man proceeded uncertainly  along Gissing Street, stopping now and then to look at shop windows as  though doubtful of his way.  At the warm and shining face of a French  rotisserie he halted to compare the number enamelled on the transom  with a memorandum in his hand.  Then he pushed on for a few minutes, at  last reaching the address he sought.  Over the entrance his eye was  caught by the sign:                             PARNASSUS AT HOME                         R. AND H. MIFFLIN                        BOOKLOVERS WELCOME!                       THIS SHOP IS HAUNTED      He stumbled down the three steps that led into the dwelling of the  muses, lowered his overcoat collar, and looked about.    It was very different from such bookstores as he had been accustomed to  patronize.  Two stories of the old house had been thrown into one: the  lower space was divided into little alcoves; above, a gallery ran round  the wall, which carried books to the ceiling.  The air was heavy with  the delightful fragrance of mellowed paper and leather surcharged with  a strong bouquet of tobacco.  In front of him he found a large placard  in a frame:           THIS SHOP IS HAUNTED by the ghosts       Of all great literature, in hosts;         We sell no fakes or trashes.       Lovers of books are welcome here,       No clerks will babble in your ear,         Please smoke--but don't drop ashes!                               ----       Browse as long as you like.       Prices of all books plainly marked.       If you want to ask questions, you'll find the proprietor             where the tobacco smoke is thickest.       We pay cash for books.       We have what you want, though you may not know you want it.              Malnutrition of the reading faculty is a serious thing.         Let us prescribe for you.         By R. & H. MIFFLIN,                                       Proprs.      The shop had a warm and comfortable obscurity, a kind of drowsy dusk,  stabbed here and there by bright cones of yellow light from  green-shaded electrics.  There was an all-pervasive drift of tobacco  smoke, which eddied and fumed under the glass lamp shades.  Passing  down a narrow aisle between the alcoves the visitor noticed that some  of the compartments were wholly in darkness; in others where lamps were  glowing he could see a table and chairs.  In one corner, under a sign  lettered ESSAYS, an elderly gentleman was reading, with a face of  fanatical ecstasy illumined by the sharp glare of electricity; but  there was no wreath of smoke about him so the newcomer concluded he was  not the proprietor.    As the young man approached the back of the shop the general effect  became more and more fantastic.  On some skylight far overhead he could  hear the rain drumming; but otherwise the place was completely silent,  peopled only (so it seemed) by the gurgitating whorls of smoke and the  bright profile of the essay reader.  It seemed like a secret fane, some  shrine of curious rites, and the young man's throat was tightened by a  stricture which was half agitation and half tobacco.  Towering above  him into the gloom were shelves and shelves of books, darkling toward  the roof.  He saw a table with a cylinder of brown paper and twine,  evidently where purchases might be wrapped; but there was no sign of an  attendant.    \"This place may indeed be haunted,\" he thought, \"perhaps by the  delighted soul of Sir Walter Raleigh, patron of the weed, but seemingly  not by the proprietors.\"    His eyes, searching the blue and vaporous vistas of the shop, were  caught by a circle of brightness that shone with a curious egg-like  lustre.  It was round and white, gleaming in the sheen of a hanging  light, a bright island in a surf of tobacco smoke.  He came more close,  and found it was a bald head.    This head (he then saw) surmounted a small, sharp-eyed man who sat  tilted back in a swivel chair, in a corner which seemed the nerve  centre of the establishment.  The large pigeon-holed desk in front of  him was piled high with volumes of all sorts, with tins of tobacco and  newspaper clippings and letters.  An antiquated typewriter, looking  something like a harpsichord, was half-buried in sheets of manuscript.  The little bald-headed man was smoking a corn-cob pipe and reading a  cook-book.    \"I beg your pardon,\" said the caller, pleasantly; \"is this the  proprietor?\"    Mr. Roger Mifflin, the proprietor of \"Parnassus at Home,\" looked up,  and the visitor saw that he had keen blue eyes, a short red beard, and  a convincing air of competent originality.    \"It is,\" said Mr. Mifflin.  \"Anything I can do for you?\"    \"My name is Aubrey Gilbert,\" said the young man.  \"I am representing  the Grey-Matter Advertising Agency.  I want to discuss with you the  advisability of your letting us handle your advertising account,  prepare snappy copy for you, and place it in large circulation mediums.  Now the war's over, you ought to prepare some constructive campaign for  bigger business.\"    The bookseller's face beamed.  He put down his cook-book, blew an  expanding gust of smoke, and looked up brightly.    \"My dear chap,\" he said, \"I don't do any advertising.\"    \"Impossible!\" cried the other, aghast as at some gratuitous indecency.    \"Not in the sense you mean.  Such advertising as benefits me most is  done for me by the snappiest copywriters in the business.\"    \"I suppose you refer to Whitewash and Gilt?\" said Mr. Gilbert wistfully.    \"Not at all.  The people who are doing my advertising are Stevenson,  Browning, Conrad and Company.\"    \"Dear me,\" said the Grey-Matter solicitor.  \"I don't know that agency  at all.  Still, I doubt if their copy has more pep than ours.\"    \"I don't think you get me.  I mean that my advertising is done by the  books I sell.  If I sell a man a book by Stevenson or Conrad, a book  that delights or terrifies him, that man and that book become my living  advertisements.\"    \"But that word-of-mouth advertising is exploded,\" said Gilbert.  \"You  can't get Distribution that way.  You've got to keep your trademark  before the public.\"    \"By the bones of Tauchnitz!\" cried Mifflin.  \"Look here, you wouldn't  go to a doctor, a medical specialist, and tell him he ought to  advertise in papers and magazines?  A doctor is advertised by the  bodies he cures.  My business is advertised by the minds I stimulate.  And let me tell you that the book business is different from other  trades.  People don't know they want books.  I can see just by looking  at you that your mind is ill for lack of books but you are blissfully  unaware of it!  People don't go to a bookseller until some serious  mental accident or disease makes them aware of their danger.  Then they  come here.  For me to advertise would be about as useful as telling  people who feel perfectly well that they ought to go to the doctor.  Do  you know why people are reading more books now than ever before?  Because the terrific catastrophe of the war has made them realize that  their minds are ill.  The world was suffering from all sorts of mental  fevers and aches and disorders, and never knew it.  Now our mental  pangs are only too manifest.  We are all reading, hungrily, hastily,  trying to find out--after the trouble is over--what was the matter with  our minds.\"    The little bookseller was standing up now, and his visitor watched him  with mingled amusement and alarm.    \"You know,\" said Mifflin, \"I am interested that you should have thought  it worth while to come in here.  It reinforces my conviction of the  amazing future ahead of the book business.  But I tell you that future  lies not merely in systematizing it as a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17203"],[0,"Witchcraft and Devil Lore in the Channel Islands (#1)"],[1,"AND    DEVIL LORE    IN THE    CHANNEL ISLANDS      TRANSCRIPTS FROM THE OFFICIAL RECORDS OF THE GUERNSEY ROYAL COURT,  WITH AN ENGLISH TRANSLATION AND HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION.

The Witchcraft superstitions of the Channel Islands, sad as they were  in their characteristics and results--as is abundantly evidenced by  our judicial records--were but a part and parcel of that vast wave of  unreasoning credulity which swept across the civilised world during  the Middle Ages, and more or less affected every class of society, and  all sorts and conditions of men. From the lists given in the following  pages (pp. 28-32), it will be seen that in about seventy-one years,  during the reigns of Elizabeth, James I. and Charles I., no fewer than  seventy-eight persons--fifty-eight of them being women, and twenty of  them men--were brought to trial for Sorcery in Guernsey alone. Out of  these unfortunate victims, three women and one man appear to have been  burnt alive; twenty-four women and four men were hanged first and  burnt afterwards; one woman was hanged for returning to the island  after being banished; three women and one man were whipped and had  each an ear cut off; twenty-two women and five men were banished from  the island; while five women and three men had the good fortune to be  acquitted. Most of these accused persons were natives of Guernsey, but  mention is made of one woman from Jersey, of three men and a woman  from Sark, and of a man from Alderney.    With regard to the gatherings at the so-called Witches' Sabbaths,  there can be no doubt that--quite apart from the question of any  diabolic presence at such meetings--very questionable assemblies of  people did take place at intervals among the inhabitants of many  countries. Probably these gatherings first had their rise in the old  pagan times, and were subsequently continued from force of habit, long  after their real origin and significance had been forgotten. Now, it  would be very easy for these orgies to become associated--particularly  in the then superstitious condition of the popular mind--with the  actual bodily presence of the Devil as one of the participants; while  it is also not improbable that, in some cases at least, heartless and  evil-minded persons worked upon the prevailing credulity to further  their own nefarious purposes. Our esteemed Bailiff has offered a  suggestion or two of considerable value on this point with regard to  certain Guernsey phases of the superstition. He thinks it highly  probable that some of these deluded women were actually the dupes of  unprincipled and designing men, who arrayed themselves in various  disguises and then met their unfortunate victims by appointment. This  idea is, indeed, borne out to a great extent by some of the  particulars stated in the following confessions. For instance, some of  the women assert that when they met the Devil he was in the form of a  dog, _but rather larger_; he always stood upon his hind legs--probably  the man's feet; and, when he shook hands with them, his paw _felt like  a hand_--doubtless it _was_ a hand. Another suggestion of the  Bailiff's is also worth notice. It is that the black ointment so often  mentioned as being rubbed on the bodies of the so-called witches, had  a real existence, and may have been so compounded as to act as a  narcotic or intoxicant, and produce a kind of extatic condition, just  as the injection of certain drugs beneath the skin is known to do now.  These suggestions are certainly worth consideration as offering  reasonable solutions of at least two difficulties connected with those  strange and lamentable superstitions. In one way or other there must  have been some physical basis for beliefs so widely extended and so  terribly real. Imagination, of course, possesses a marvellous power of  modification and exaggeration, but still it requires some germs of  fact around which to crystallise. And it is to the discovery of the  nature of such germs that a careful and conscientious observer will  naturally turn his attention.           *       *       *       *       *    While speaking of the burning of Witches in Guernsey, I may also  refer for a moment to the three women who, in Queen Mary's reign  suffered death by fire, for heresy, because the reason of their  condemnation and punishment has caused some controversy, and is often  associated in the popular mind with a charge of sorcery. Dr. Heylin in  his _Survey_ (page 323), says:--         Katherine Gowches, a poor woman of St. Peter-Port, in       Guernsey, was noted to be much absent from church, and her       two daughters guilty of the same neglect. Upon this they       were presented before James Amy, then dean of the island,       who, finding in them that they held opinions contrary to       those then allowed about the sacrament of the altar,       pronounced them heretics, and condemned them to the fire.       The poor women, on the other side, pleaded for themselves,       that that doctrine had been taught them in the time of King       Edward; but if the queen was otherwise disposed, they were       content to be of her religion. This was fair but it would       not serve; for by the dean they were delivered unto Helier       Gosselin, then bailiff, and by him unto the fire, July 18,       1556. One of these daughters, Perotine Massey, she was       called, was at that time great with child; her husband,"]]]
