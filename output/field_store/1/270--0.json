That  explanation is correct as far as it goes; but, put as I put it, it now  seems to me to suggest that the operatic character of Night Falls On  The Gods was the result of indifference or forgetfulness produced by the  lapse of twenty-five years between the first projection of the work and  its completion. Now it is clear that in whatever other ways Wagner may  have changed, he never became careless and he never became indifferent.  I have therefore inserted a new section in which I show how the  revolutionary history of Western Europe from the Liberal explosion of  1848 to the confused attempt at a socialist, military, and municipal  administration in Paris in 1871 (that is to say, from the beginning of  The Niblung's Ring by Wagner to the long-delayed completion of Night  Falls On The Gods), demonstrated practically that the passing away of  the present order was going to be a much more complicated business than  it appears in Wagner's Siegfried. I have therefore interpolated a new  chapter which will perhaps induce some readers of the original English  text to read the book again in German.    For some time to come, indeed, I shall have to refer English readers to  this German edition as the most complete in existence.    My obligation to Herr Trebitsch for making me a living German author  instead of merely a translated English one is so great that I am bound  to point out that he is not responsible for my views or Wagner's, and  that it is as an artist and a man of letters, and not as a propagandist,  that he is conveying to the German speaking peoples political criticisms  which occasionally reflect on contemporary authorities with a European  reputation for sensitiveness. And as the very sympathy which makes his  translations so excellent may be regarded with suspicion, let me hasten  to declare I am bound to Germany by the ties that hold my nature most  strongly. Not that I like the average German: nobody does, even in his  own country. But then the average man is not popular anywhere; and as  no German considers himself an average one, each reader will, as an  exceptional man, sympathize with my dislike of the common herd. And if  I cannot love the typical modern German, I can at least pity and  understand him. His worst fault is that he cannot see that it is  possible to have too much of a good thing. Being convinced that duty,  industry, education, loyalty, patriotism and respectability are  good things (and I am magnanimous enough to admit that they are not  altogether bad things when taken in strict moderation at the right  time and in the right place), he indulges in them on all occasions  shamelessly and excessively. He commits hideous crimes when crime is  presented to him as part of his duty; his craze for work is more ruinous  than the craze for drink; when he can afford secondary education for his  sons you find three out of every five of them with their minds lamed  for life by examinations which only a thoroughly wooden head could go  through with impunity; and if a king is patriotic and respectable (few  kings are) he puts up statues to him and exalts him above Charlemagne  and Henry the Fowler. And when he meets a man of genius, he  instinctively insults him, starves him, and, if possible, imprisons and  kills him.    Now I do not pretend to be perfect myself. Heaven knows I have to  struggle hard enough every day with what the Germans call my  higher impulses. I know too well the temptation to be moral, to be  self-sacrificing, to be loyal and patriotic, to be respectable and  well-spoken of. But I wrestle with it and--as far as human fraility will  allow--conquer it, whereas the German abandons himself to it without  scruple or reflection, and is actually proud of his pious intemperance  and self-indulgence. Nothing will cure him of this mania. It may end  in starvation, crushing taxation, suppression of all freedom to try  new social experiments and reform obsolete institutions, in snobbery,  jobbery, idolatry, and an omnipresent tyranny in which his doctor and  his schoolmaster, his lawyer and his priest, coerce him worse than  any official or drill sergeant: no matter: it is respectable, says the  German, therefore it must be good, and cannot be carried too far;  and everybody who rebels against it must be a rascal. Even the  Social-Democrats in Germany differ from the rest only in carrying  academic orthodoxy beyond human endurance--beyond even German endurance.  I am a Socialist and a Democrat myself, the hero of a hundred platforms,  one of the leaders of the most notable Socialist organizations in  England. I am as conspicuous in English Socialism as Bebel is in German  Socialism; but do you suppose that the German Social-Democrats tolerate  me? Not a bit of it. I have begged again and again to be taken to the  bosom of my German comrades. I have pleaded that the Super-Proletarians  of all lands should unite. I have pointed out that the German  Social-Democratic party has done nothing at its Congresses for the last  ten years except the things I told them to do ten years before, and that  its path is white with the bones of the Socialist superstitions I and my  fellow Fabians have slain. Useless. They do not care a rap whether I  am a Socialist or not. All they want to know is; Am I orthodox? Am I  correct in my revolutionary views? Am I reverent to the revolutionary  authorities? Because I am a genuine free-thinker they look at me as a  policeman looks at a midnight prowler or as a Berlin bourgeois looks  at a suspicious foreigner. They ask \"Do you believe that Marx was  omniscient and infallible; that Engels was his prophet; that Bebel and  Singer are his inspired apostles; and that Das Kapital is the Bible?\"  Hastening in my innocence to clear myself of what I regard as an  accusation of credulity and ignorance, I assure them earnestly that  I know ten times as much of economics and a hundred times as much of  practical administration as Marx did; that I knew Engels personally and  rather liked him as a witty and amiable old 1848 veteran who despised  modern Socialism; that I regard Bebel and Singer as men of like passions  with myself, but considerably less advanced; and that I read Das Kapital  in the year 1882 or thereabouts, and still consider it one of the  most important books of the nineteenth century because of its power  of changing the minds of those who read it, in spite of its unsound  capitalist economics, its parade of quotations from books which the  author had either not read or not understood, its affectation of  algebraic formulas, and its general attempt to disguise a masterpiece  of propagandist journalism and prophetic invective as a drily scientific  treatise of the sort that used to impose on people in 1860, when any  book that pretended to be scientific was accepted as a Bible. In those  days Darwin and Helmholtz were the real fathers of the Church; and  nobody would listen to religion, poetry or rhetoric; so that even  Socialism had to call itself \"scientific,\" and predict the date of the  revolution, as if it were a comet, by calculations founded on \"historic  laws.\"    To my amazement these reasonable remarks were received as hideous  blasphemies; none of the party papers were allowed to print any word  of mine; the very Revisionists themselves found that the scandal of my  heresy damaged them more than my support aided them; and I found myself  an outcast from German Social-Democracy at the moment when, thanks to  Trebitsch, the German bourgeoisie and nobility began to smile on me,  seduced by the pleasure of playing with fire, and perhaps by Agnes  Sorma's acting as Candida.    Thus you may see that when a German, by becoming a Social-Democrat,  throws off all the bonds of convention, and stands free from all  allegiance to established religion, law, order, patriotism, and  learning, he promptly uses his freedom to put on a headier set of  chains; expels anti-militarists with the blood-thirstiest martial  anti-foreign ardor; and gives the Kaiser reason to thank heaven that he  was born in the comparative freedom and Laodicean tolerance of Kingship,  and not in the Calvinistic bigotry and pedantry of Marxism.    Why, then, you may ask, do I say that I am bound to Germany by the ties  that hold my nature most strongly? Very simply because I should have  perished of despair in my youth but for the world created for me by that  great German dynasty which began with Bach and will perhaps not end with  Richard Strauss. Do not suppose for a moment that I learnt my art from  English men of letters. True, they showed me how to handle English  words; but if I had known no more than that, my works would never  have crossed the Channel. My masters were the masters of a universal  language: they were, to go from summit to summit, Bach, Handel, Haydn,  Mozart, Beethoven and Wagner. Had the Germans understood any of these  men, they would have hanged them. Fortunately they did not understand  them, and therefore only neglected them until they were dead, after  which they learnt to dance to their tunes with an easy conscience.  For their sakes Germany stands consecrated as the Holy Land of the  capitalist age, just as Italy, for its painters' sakes, is the Holy Land  of the early unvulgarized Renascence; France, for its builders'  sakes, of the age of Christian chivalry and faith; and Greece, for its  sculptors' sakes, of the Periclean age.    These Holy Lands are my fatherlands: in them alone am I truly at home:  all my work is but to bring the whole world under"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14874"],[0,"Elsie's Womanhood (#1)"],[1,"Team.              ELSIE'S  WOMANHOOD    A sequel to  \"ELSIE'S GIRLHOOD\"    By  MARTHA FINLEY    Complete Authorized Edition    Published by arrangement with  Dodd, Mead and Company    _A Burt Book_  BLUE RIBBON BOOKS, Inc.    _New York_          Entered, according to Act of Congress, in the year 1875, by    DODD & MEAD    In the Office of the Librarian of Congress, at Washington.    1903,    BY MARTHA FINLEY    1917,    BY CHARLES B. FINLEY          Preface.      The call for a sequel to \"Elsie's Girlhood\" having become too loud and  importunate to be resisted, the pleasant task of writing it was  undertaken.    Dates compelled the bringing in of the late war: and it has been the  earnest desire and effort of the author to so treat the subject as to  wound the feelings of none; to be as impartial as if writing history; and,  by drawing a true, though alas, but faint picture, of the great losses and  sufferings on both sides, to make the very thought of a renewal of the  awful strife _utterly abhorrent_ to every lover of humanity, and  especially of this, our own dear native land.    Are we not one people: speaking the same language; worshipping the one  true and living God; having a common history, a common ancestry; and  united by the tenderest ties of blood? And is not this great grand,  glorious old Union--known and respected all over the world--our common  country, our joy and pride? O! let us forget all bitterness, and live  henceforth in love, harmony, and mutual helpfulness.    For all I know of the Teche country I am indebted to Mr. Edward King's  \"Old and New Louisiana\"; for facts and dates in regard to the war, and in  large measure for Mr. Dinsmore's views as to its causes, etc.,  principally to Headley's \"History of the Great Rebellion.\"    The description of Andersonville, and the life led by the prisoners there,  was supplied by one who shared it for six months. An effort was made to  obtain a sketch of a Northern prison also, but without success.    Yet what need to balance accounts in respect to these matters? The  unnatural strife is over, and we are again one united people.    M.F.          CHAPTER FIRST.        \"Oh! there is one affection which no stain         Of earth can ever darken;--when two find,       The softer and the manlier, that a chain         Of kindred taste has fastened mind to mind.\"                                   --PERCIVAL'S POEMS.      In one of the cool green alleys at the Oaks, Rose and Adelaide Dinsmore  were pacing slowly to and fro, each with an arm about the other's waist,  in girlish fashion, while they conversed together in low, confidential  tones.    At a little distance to one side, the young son and heir had thrown  himself prone upon the grass in the shade of a magnificent oak, story-book  in hand. Much interested he seemed in his book, yet occasionally his eye  would wander from its fascinating pages to watch, with pride and delight,  the tiny Rosebud steady herself against a tree, then run with eager,  tottering steps and a crow of delight into her nurse's outstretched arms,  to be hugged, kissed, praised, and coaxed to try it over again.    As Rose and Adelaide turned at one end of the alley, Mr. Horace Dinsmore  entered it at the other. Hurriedly approaching the little toddler, he  stooped and held out his hands, saying, in tender, half-tremulous tones,  \"Come, darling, come to papa.\"    She ran into his arms, crying, \"Papa,\" in her sweet baby voice, and  catching her up, he covered her face with kisses; then, holding her  clasped fondly to his breast, walked on towards his wife and sister.    \"What is it, Horace?\" asked Rose anxiously, as they neared each other; for  she saw that his face was pale and troubled.    \"I bring you strange tidings, my Rose,\" he answered low and sadly, as she  laid her hand upon his arm with an affectionate look up into his face.    Hers grew pale. \"Bad news from home?\" she almost gasped.    \"No, no; I've had no word from our absent relatives or friends, and I'm  not sure I ought to call it bad news either; though I cannot yet think of  it with equanimity, it has come upon me so suddenly.\"    \"What?\" asked both ladies in a breath; \"don't keep us in suspense.\"    \"It has been going on for years--on his part--I can see it now--but, blind  fool that I was, I never suspected it till to-day, when it came upon me  like a thunderbolt.\"    \"What? who?\"    \"Travilla; after years of patient waiting he has won her at last--our  darling--and--and I've given her to him.\"    Both ladies stood dumb with astonishment, while young Horace, who had come  running up in time to catch the last words, cried out with vehemence,  \"Papa! what! give our Elsie away? how could you? how can we ever do  without her? But she shan't go, for she belongs to me too, and I'll  _never_ give consent!\"    Mr. Dinsmore and the ladies smiled faintly.    \"They seemed to think mine quite sufficient, Horace,\" replied his father,  \"and I'm afraid will hardly consider it necessary to ask yours.\"    \"But, papa, we can't spare her--you know we can't--and why should you go  and give her away to Mr. Travilla or anybody?\"    \"My son, had I refused, it would have caused her great unhappiness.\"    \"Then she ought to be ashamed to go and love Mr. Travilla better than you  and all of us.\"    \"I was never more astonished in my life!\" cried Adelaide.    \"Nor I,\" said Rose. \"And he's a great deal too old for her.\"    \"That is an objection,\" replied her husband, \"but if not insuperable to  her, need not be to us.\"    \"Think of your intimate friend addressing you as father!\" laughed  Adelaide; \"it's really too ridiculous.\"    \"That need not be--is not an inevitable consequence of the match,\" smiled  Mr. Dinsmore, softly caressing the little one clinging about his neck.    Still conversing on the same subject, the minds of all being full of it to  the exclusion of every other, they moved on as if by common consent  towards the house.    \"Do you think it can be possible that she is really and truly in love with  him?\" queried Rose; \"a man so much older than herself, and so intimate in  the family since her early childhood.\"    \"Judge for yourself, my dear,\" said Mr. Dinsmore, as a turn in the path  brought them within a few yards of the lovers, who were moving slowly in  their direction so that the two parties must meet in another moment.    One glance at the beaming faces, the rich color coming and going in  Elsie's cheek, the soft, glad light in her sweet brown eyes, was a  sufficient reply to Rose's question. She looked at her husband with a  satisfied smile, which he returned.    But little Horace, leaving his father's side, rushed up to Elsie, and  catching her hand in his, cried, \"I'll never give my consent! and you  belong to me. Mr. Travilla, you can't have her.\"    To the child's surprise Elsie only blushed and smiled, while Mr. Travilla,  without the slightest appearance of alarm or vexation, said, \"Ah, my dear  boy, you may just as well; for she is willing to be mine and your papa has  given her to me.\"    But the others had come up, and inquiring looks, smiles and kindly  greetings were exchanged.    \"Mr. Travilla,\" said Rose, half playfully but with a tear trembling in her  eye, \"you have stolen a march upon us, and I can hardly forgive you just  yet.\"    \"I regret that exceedingly, my dear madam,\" he answered, with a smile that  belied his words. \"But Miss Adelaide, you will still stand my friend?\"    \"I don't know,\" she answered demurely; \"there's only one serious objection  in my mind (if Elsie is satisfied); that I don't quite fancy having a  nephew some years older than myself.\"    \"Ah! well, I shall be quite willing to be considered a brother-in-law.\"    \"Company to dinner!\" shouted Horace. \"I see a carriage; don't you, papa?\"    \"It is your Uncle Edward's,\" said Mr. Travilla.    \"Yes,\" said Adelaide, \"Lora and her tribe are in it, no doubt; and  probably Mrs. Bowles too (Carrie Howard you know, Elsie). They have been  late in calling.\"    \"Some good reason for it, and they are none the less welcome,\" remarked  Rose, quickening her pace.    The one party reached the house just as the other two had fairly alighted,  and a scene of joyous greeting ensued.    \"You dear child! how good of you to come back to us again, and single  too,\" exclaimed Mrs. Bowles, clasping Elsie in a warm embrace; \"I'd almost  given it up, and expected by every mail to hear you had become Lady or  Countess this, or Duchess that.\"    Elsie smiled and blushed, and meeting the eye of her betrothed fixed for  an instant upon her with an expression of unutterable content,  thankfulness, love and pride, smiled and blushed again.    Carrie caught the look and its effect upon her friend, and almost  breathless with astonishment, took the first opportunity, after all were  seated in the drawing-room, to prefer a whispered request to be taken to  Elsie's own private apartment for a moment, to see that her hair and dress  were in proper order.    They had come to spend the day, and bonnets and shawls had already been  carried away by the servants in attendance.    \"Now girls, don't run off for an interminable chat by yourselves,\" said  Mrs. Howard, as the two rose and crossed the room together.    \"No, Aunt Lora, we'll not stay long,\" said Elsie; \"for I want to improve  every moment of your visit, in renewing my acquaintance with you and my  young cousins.\"    \"Your family has grown, Lora,\" remarked her brother.    \"Yes, rather faster than yours,\" she said, looking round with pride upon  her little group of four boys, and a girl yet in her nurse's arms. \"Go and  speak to your uncle, Ned, Walter, Horace, and Arthur. You see I have given  you a namesake; and this little pet we call Rose Louise, for her two  aunties. Yours is Rose, too! and what a darling! and how little Horace has  grown!\"    \"Elsie, it can't be possible!\" cried Carrie, the instant they found  themselves alone.    \"What can'"]]]
