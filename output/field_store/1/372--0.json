LOUIS:                             BENZIGER BROTHERS                    PRINTERS TO THE HOLY APOSTOLIC SEE.                            COPYRIGHT, 1881, BY BENZIGER BROTHERS.          PREFACE.      This book, a reprint of a successful English publication, has been so  enlarged as to be to all intents and purposes new. It has been  carefully revised by a Reverend gentleman, who for some time filled  the chair of Physics and Chemistry in one of our colleges.    Recent inventions and improvements are described in a simple, popular  style, so as to be easily understood by all, and short notices are  given of prominent inventors and scientists. The paragraphs relating  to doctrinal matters conform in every respect to the teachings of the  Church.    A feature which will commend the book to every teacher is the  definitions of difficult words and terms, following the paragraphs in  which such words occur.    Technical language is avoided as much as possible, so as to enable  young pupils to become familiarly acquainted with the various  phenomena of nature, the leading characteristics and general history  of the objects of the animal, vegetable, and mineral kingdoms, and the  fundamental truths of the arts and sciences.    The illustrations are of a superior order, and a very complete Index,  which will be appreciated by every teacher, supplements the book. In a  word, no pains have been spared to enhance the value of the work, and  render it an important auxiliary in the dissemination of useful and  entertaining knowledge.    The publishers beg to acknowledge their obligations to the Sisters of  Mercy, Loretto, Pa., to whose kindness they are indebted for many  valuable suggestions.    In the hope that the book may be found suited to the accomplishment of  its aim, it is respectfully submitted to schools and instructors of  youth, who are the best judges of its merits.

DEW, WATER, RAIN, SNOW, HAIL, ATMOSPHERE, WIND, LIGHTNING,  THUNDER, ELECTRICITY, TWILIGHT, AND THE AURORA BOREALIS.      What is Dew?    Moisture collected from the atmosphere by the action of cold. During  the day, the powerful heat of the sun causes to arise from the earth  and water a moist vapor, which, after the sun sinks below the horizon,  is condensed by the cold, and falls in the form of dew. Dews are more  copious in the Spring and Autumn than at any other season; in warm  countries than in cold ones: because of the sudden changes of  temperature. Egypt abounds in dews all the summer; for the air being  too hot to condense the vapors in the day-time, they never gather into  clouds and form rain.         _Horizon_, the line which bounds the view on all sides, so       that the earth and sky appear to meet. A Greek word, from       the verb signifying to mark boundaries.         _Temperature_, degree of heat or cold.         _Condense_, to cause the particles of a body to approach or       unite more closely.      What are its uses?    It cools and refreshes the vegetable creation, and prevents it from  being destroyed by the heat of the sun. All hot countries where there  is little or no rain are therefore blessed with this provision by the  all-bountiful Creator, to render them luxuriant and inhabitable; and  the dews which fall are so copious, that the earth is as deeply soaked  with them during the night as if a heavy rain had fallen. For this  reason also it is, that we so often read in the Bible of the \"dew of  Heaven\" being promised to the Israelites as a signal favor.         _Luxuriant_, fertile, flourishing.         _Signal_, remarkable, eminent.      From what does the vapor originate?    Vapor is water, combined with a still greater quantity of  caloric,--that is, an imponderable and subtile form of matter, which  causes the sensation of heat; and which, driving asunder the particles  of the water, renders it aeriform.         _Imponderable_, without sensible weight.         _Subtile_, thin, not dense, or compact.         _Particle_, a small portion of matter.         _Aeriform_, having the form of air.      What is Water?    The fluid which covers more than three-fifths of the surface of our  globe, and which is necessary for the life and health of the animal  and vegetable creation; for without water there would be neither rain  nor dew, and everything would perish. It is likewise a necessary  beverage for man and the inferior animals.         _Beverage_, drink, liquor for drinking.      In how many states do we find Water?    In four: 1st, solid, as in ice, snow, hail, &c.; 2d, fluid, as in its  common form; 3d, aeriform, as in steam; and 4th, in a state of union  with other matter. Its most simple state is that of ice, which is  water deprived of a certain portion of its caloric: crystallization  then takes place, and the water becomes solid and is called ice.         _Crystallization_, the process by which the parts of a solid       body, separated by solution or fusion, are again brought       into the solid form. If the process is slow, the figure       assumed is regular and bounded by plane and smooth surfaces.         _Solution_, the diffusion of a solid through some liquid.         _Fusion_, melting, or rendering fluid by heat.      From what cause is the Water deprived of its caloric?    From the coldness of the atmosphere: underneath the poles of our globe  it is mostly solid; there it is similar to the hardest rocks, and may  be cut with a chisel, like stone or marble. This great solidity is  occasioned by the low temperature of the surrounding air; and in very  cold countries ice may be ground so fine as to be blown away by the  wind, and will still be ice.         _Poles_, the extremities or ends of the axis, an imaginary       line, supposed to be drawn through the centre of the earth;       or when applied to the heavens, the two points directly over       them.      Is ice the only instance of Water existing in a state of solidity?    No; it is found in a solid state in many minerals, as in marble, &c.,  and is then called _water of Crystallization_. It is essential, in  many cases, to their solidity and transparency.         _Essential_, necessary.         _Transparency_, clearness, the power of transmitting light.      Does Nature decompose Water in any of her operations?    Yes: every living vegetable has the power of decomposing water, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16737"],[0,"International Language, Past, Present & Future (#1)"],[1,"Distributed Proofreading Team at https://www.pgdp.net            ========================================================================    TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE:    This e-text uses the digraphs \"cx\", \"gx\", \"hx\", \"jx\", \"sx\" and \"ux\" to  represent letters unavailable in the latin-1 character set.

The world is spinning fast down the grooves of change. The old disorder  changeth. Haply it is yielding place to new. The tongue is a little  member. It should no longer be allowed to divide the nations.    Two things stand out in the swift change. Science with all its works is  spreading to all lands. The East, led by Japan, is coming into line with  the West.    Standardization of life may fittingly be accompanied by standardization  of language. The effect may be twofold--Practical and Ideal.          _Practical._    The World has a thousand tongues,                             Science but one:                        They'll climb up a thousand rungs                             When Babel's done.          _Ideal._        Mankind has a thousand tongues,                             Friendship but one:                        _Banzai!_ then from heart and lungs                             For the Rising Sun.
