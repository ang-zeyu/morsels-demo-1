The report continues:_    The enemy left several thousand dead on the field, and we have positive  information that upward of 12,000 wounded were removed by trains. Thirty  officers and 1,657 of other ranks were captured.    _The British commander's dispatch concerning the battle is long, and  says, among other things:_    Considerable delay occurred after the capture of Neuve Chapelle, and the  infantry was greatly disorganized. I am of the opinion that this delay  would not have occurred had the clearly expressed order of the general  officer commanding the First Army been more carefully observed.    _Field Marshal Sir John French's report, which covers the battles of  Neuve Chapelle and St. Eloi under date of April 5, was published in the  official Gazette today. The Commander in Chief writes:_    The event of chief interest and importance which has taken place is the  victory achieved over the enemy in the battle of Neuve Chapelle, which  was fought on March 10, 11, and 12.    The main attack was delivered by the troops of the First Army under  command of General Sir Douglas Haig, supported by a large force of heavy  artillery, a division of cavalry, and some infantry of the General  Reserve. Secondary and holding attacks and demonstrations were made  along the front of the Second Army, under direction of its commander,  Sir Horace Smith-Dorrien.    While the success attained was due to the magnificent bearing and  indomitable courage displayed by the troops of the Fourth and Indian  Corps, I consider that the able and skillful dispositions which were  made by the general officer commanding the First Army contributed  largely to the defeat of the enemy and to the capture of his position.  The energy and vigor with which General Sir Douglas Haig handled his  command show him to be a leader of great ability and power.    Another action of considerable importance was brought about by a  surprise attack made by the Germans on March 14 against the  Twenty-seventh Division holding the trenches east of St. Eloi. A large  force of artillery was concentrated in this area under the cover of a  mist and a heavy volume of fire was suddenly brought to bear on the  trenches.    At 5 o'clock in the afternoon this artillery attack was accompanied by  two mine explosions, and in the confusion caused by these and by the  suddenness of the attack the position of St. Eloi was captured and held  for some hours by the enemy.    Well-directed and vigorous counter-attacks, in which the troops of the  Fifth Army Corps showed great bravery and determination, restored the  situation by the evening of the 15th.    _The dispatch describes further operations, saying:_    On Feb. 6 a brilliant action by the troops of the First Corps materially  improved our position in the area south of La Bassee Canal. During the  previous night parties of the Irish Guards and the Third Battalion of  the Coldstream Guards had succeeded in gaining ground from which a  converging fire could be directed on the flanks and rear of certain  brick stacks occupied by the Germans, which had been for some time a  source of considerable annoyance. At 2 P.M. the affair commenced with a  severe bombardment of the brick stacks and the enemy's trenches.    A brisk attack by the Third Battalion of the Coldstream Guards and "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15480"],[0,"New York Times Current History; The European War, Vol 2, No. 3, June, 1915 (#1)"],[1,"the Project Gutenberg Online Distributed Proofreading Team        Note: Project Gutenberg also has an HTML version of this        file which includes the original illustrations.
