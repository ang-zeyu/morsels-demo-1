CHARLES E. MERRILL CO.          LIFE OF EMERSON      Ralph Waldo Emerson was born in Boston, May 25, 1803. He was descended  from a long line of New England ministers, men of refinement and  education. As a school-boy he was quiet and retiring, reading a great  deal, but not paying much attention to his lessons. He entered Harvard  at the early age of fourteen, but never attained a high rank there,  although he took a prize for an essay on Socrates, and was made class  poet after several others had declined. Next to his reserve and the  faultless propriety of his conduct, his contemporaries at college  seemed most impressed by the great maturity of his mind. Emerson  appears never to have been really a boy. He was always serene and  thoughtful, impressing all who knew him with that spirituality which  was his most distinguishing characteristic.    After graduating from college he taught school for a time, and then  entered the Harvard Divinity School under Dr. Channing, the great  Unitarian preacher. Although he was not strong enough to attend all  the lectures of the divinity course, the college authorities deemed  the name Emerson sufficient passport to the ministry. He was  accordingly \"approbated to preach\" by the Middlesex Association of  Ministers on October 10, 1826. As a preacher, Emerson was interesting,  though not particularly original. His talent seems to have been in  giving new meaning to the old truths of religion. One of his hearers  has said: \"In looking back on his preaching I find he has impressed  truths to which I always assented in such a manner as to make them  appear new, like a clearer revelation.\" Although his sermons were  always couched in scriptural language, they were touched with the  light of that genius which avoids the conventional and commonplace. In  his other pastoral duties Emerson was not quite so successful. It is  characteristic of his deep humanity and his dislike for all fuss and  commonplace that he appeared to least advantage at a funeral. A  connoisseur in such matters, an old sexton, once remarked that on such  occasions \"he did not appear at ease at all. To tell the truth, in my  opinion, that young man was not born to be a minister.\"    Emerson did not long remain a minister. In 1832 he preached a sermon  in which he announced certain views in regard to the communion service  which were disapproved by a large part of his congregation. He found  it impossible to continue preaching, and, with the most friendly  feelings on both sides, he parted from his congregation.    A few months later (1833) he went to Europe for a short year of  travel. While abroad, he visited Walter Savage Landor, Coleridge and  Wordsworth, and Thomas Carlyle. This visit to Carlyle was to both men  a most interesting experience. They parted feeling that they had much  intellectually in common. This belief fostered a sympathy which, by  the time they had discovered how different they really were, had grown  so strong a habit that they always kept up their intimacy. This year  of travel opened Emerson's eyes to many things of which he had  previously been ignorant; he had profited by detachment from the  concerns of a limited community and an isolated church.    After his return he began to find his true field of activity in the  lecture-hall, and delivered a number of addresses in Boston and its  vicinity. While thus coming before the open public on the lecture  platform, he was all the time preparing the treatise which was to  embody all the quintessential elements of his philosophical doctrine.  This was the essay _Nature_, which was published in 1836. By its  conception of external Nature as an incarnation of the Divine Mind it  struck the fundamental principle of Emerson's religious belief. The  essay had a very small circulation at first, though later it became  widely known.    In the winter of 1836 Emerson followed up his discourse on Nature by a  course of twelve lectures on the \"Philosophy of History,\" a  considerable portion of which eventually became embodied in his  essays. The next year (1837) was the year of the delivery of the _Man  Thinking, or the American Scholar_ address before the Phi Beta Kappa  Society at Cambridge.    This society, composed of the first twenty-five men in each class  graduating from college, has annual meetings which have called forth  the best efforts of many distinguished scholars and thinkers.  Emerson's address was listened to with the most profound interest. It  declared a sort of intellectual independence for America. Henceforth  we were to be emancipated from clogging foreign influences, and a  national literature was to expand under the fostering care of the  Republic.    These two discourses, _Nature_ and _The American Scholar_, strike the  keynote of Emerson's philosophical, poetical, and moral teachings. In  fact he had, as every great teacher has, only a limited number of  principles and theories to teach. These principles of life can all be  enumerated in twenty words--self-reliance, culture, intellectual and  moral independence, the divinity of nature and man, the necessity of  labor, and high ideals.    Emerson spent the latter part of his life in lecturing and in literary  work. His son, Dr. Edward Emerson, gave an interesting account of how  these lectures were constructed. \"All through his life he kept a  journal. This book, he said, was his 'Savings Bank.' The thoughts thus  received and garnered in his journals were indexed, and a great many  of them appeared in his published works. They were religiously set  down just as they came, in no order except chronological, but later  they were grouped, enlarged or pruned, illustrated, worked into a  lecture or discourse, and, after having in this capacity undergone  repeated testing and rearranging, were finally carefully sifted and  more rigidly pruned, and were printed as essays.\"    Besides his essays and lectures Emerson left some poetry in which is  embodied those thoughts which were to him too deep for prose  expression. Oliver Wendell Holmes in speaking of this says: \"Emerson  wrote occasionally in verse from his school-days until he had reached  the age which used to be known as the grand climacteric,  sixty-three.... His poems are not and hardly can become popular; they  are not meant to be liked by the many, but to be dearly loved and  cherished by the few.... His occasional lawlessness in technical  construction, his somewhat fantastic expressions, his enigmatic  obscurities hardly detract from the pleasant surprise his verses so  often bring with them.... The poetic license which we allow in the  verse of Emerson is more than excused by the noble spirit which makes  us forget its occasional blemishes, sometimes to be pleased with them  as characteristic of the writer.\"    Emerson was always a striking figure in the intellectual life of  America. His discourses were above all things inspiring. Through them  many were induced to strive for a higher self-culture. His influence  can be discerned in all the literary movements of the time. He was the  central figure of the so-called transcendental school which was so  prominent fifty years ago, although he always rather held aloof from  any enthusiastic participation in the movement.    Emerson lived a quiet life in Concord, Massachusetts. \"He was a  first-rate neighbor and one who always kept his fences up.\" He  traveled extensively on his lecturing tours, even going as far as  England. In _English Traits_ he has recorded his impressions of what  he saw of English life and manners.    Oliver Wendell Holmes has described him in this wise: \"His personal  appearance was that of the typical New Englander of college-bred  ancestry. Tall, spare, slender, with sloping shoulders, slightly  stooping in his later years, with light hair and eyes, the scholar's  complexion, the prominent, somewhat arched nose which belongs to many  of the New England sub-species, thin lips, suggestive of delicacy, but  having nothing like"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16653"],[0,"Myths of Babylonia and Assyria (#1)"],[1,"Proofreaders                MYTHS OF BABYLONIA AND ASSYRIA    Donald A.

The Last Days of Assyria and Babylonia          PREFACE      This volume deals with the myths and legends of Babylonia and Assyria,  and as these reflect the civilization in which they developed, a  historical narrative has been provided, beginning with the early  Sumerian Age and concluding with the periods of the Persian and  Grecian Empires. Over thirty centuries of human progress are thus  passed under review.    During this vast interval of time the cultural influences emanating  from the Tigro-Euphrates valley reached far-distant shores along the  intersecting avenues of trade, and in consequence of the periodic and  widespread migrations of peoples who had acquired directly or  indirectly the leavening elements of Mesopotamian civilization. Even  at the present day traces survive in Europe of the early cultural  impress of the East; our \"Signs of the Zodiac\", for instance, as well  as the system of measuring time and space by using 60 as a basic  numeral for calculation, are inheritances from ancient Babylonia.    As in the Nile Valley, however, it is impossible to trace in  Mesopotamia the initiatory stages of prehistoric culture based on the  agricultural mode of life. What is generally called the \"Dawn of  History\" is really the beginning of a later age of progress; it is  necessary to account for the degree of civilization attained at the  earliest period of which we have knowledge by postulating a remoter  age of culture of much longer duration than that which separates the  \"Dawn\" from the age in which we now live. Although Sumerian (early  Babylonian) civilization presents distinctively local features which  justify the application of the term \"indigenous\" in the broad sense,  it is found, like that of Egypt, to be possessed of certain elements  which suggest exceedingly remote influences and connections at present  obscure. Of special interest in this regard is Professor Budge's  mature and well-deliberated conclusion that \"both the Sumerians and  early Egyptians derived their primeval gods from some common but  exceedingly ancient source\". The prehistoric burial customs of these  separate peoples are also remarkably similar and they resemble closely  in turn those of the Neolithic Europeans. The cumulative effect of  such evidence forces us to regard as not wholly satisfactory and  conclusive the hypothesis of cultural influence. A remote racial  connection is possible, and is certainly worthy of consideration when  so high an authority as Professor Frazer, author of _The Golden  Bough_, is found prepared to admit that the widespread \"homogeneity of  beliefs\" may have been due to \"homogeneity of race\". It is shown  (Chapter 1) that certain ethnologists have accumulated data which  establish a racial kinship between the Neolithic Europeans, the  proto-Egyptians, the Sumerians, the southern Persians, and the  Aryo-Indians.    Throughout this volume comparative notes have been compiled in dealing  with Mesopotamian beliefs with purpose to assist the reader towards  the study of linking myths and legends. Interesting parallels have  been gleaned from various religious literatures in Europe, Egypt,  India, and elsewhere. It will be found that certain relics of  Babylonian intellectual life, which have a distinctive geographical  significance, were shared by peoples in other cultural areas where  they were similarly overlaid with local colour. Modes of thought were  the products of modes of life and were influenced in their development  by human experiences. The influence of environment on the growth of  culture has long been recognized, but consideration must also be given  to the choice of environment by peoples who had adopted distinctive  habits of life. Racial units migrated from cultural areas to districts  suitable for colonization and carried with them a heritage of  immemorial beliefs and customs which were regarded as being quite as  indispensable for their welfare as their implements and domesticated  animals.    When consideration is given in this connection to the conservative  element in primitive religion, it is not surprising to find that the  growth of religious myths was not so spontaneous in early  civilizations of the highest order as has hitherto been assumed. It  seems clear that in each great local mythology we have to deal, in the  first place, not with symbolized ideas so much as symbolized folk  beliefs of remote antiquity and, to a certain degree, of common  inheritance. It may not be found possible to arrive at a conclusive  solution of the most widespread, and therefore the most ancient folk  myths, such as, for instance, the Dragon Myth, or the myth of the  culture hero. Nor, perhaps, is it necessary that we should concern  ourselves greatly regarding the origin of the idea of the dragon,  which in one country symbolized fiery drought and in another  overwhelming river floods.    The student will find footing on surer ground by following the process  which exalts the dragon of the folk tale into the symbol of evil and  primordial chaos. The Babylonian Creation Myth, for instance, can be  shown to be a localized and glorified legend in which the hero and his  tribe are displaced by the war god and his fellow deities whose  welfare depends on his prowess. Merodach kills the dragon, Tiamat, as  the heroes of Eur-Asian folk stories kill grisly hags, by casting his  weapon down her throat.        He severed her inward parts, he pierced her heart,      He overcame her and cut off her life;      He cast down her body and stood upon it ...      And with merciless club he smashed her skull.      He cut through the channels of her blood,      And he made the north wind to bear it away into secret places.    Afterwards        He divided the flesh of the _Ku-pu_ and devised a cunning plan.    Mr. L.W. King, from whose scholarly _Seven Tablets of Creation_ these  lines are quoted, notes that \"Ku-pu\" is a word of uncertain meaning.  Jensen suggests \"trunk, body\". Apparently Merodach obtained special  knowledge after dividing, and perhaps eating, the \"Ku-pu\". His  \"cunning plan\" is set forth in detail: he cut up the dragon's body:        He split her up like a flat fish into two halves.    He formed the heavens with one half and the earth with the other, and  then set the universe in order. His power and wisdom as the Demiurge  were derived from the fierce and powerful Great Mother, Tiamat.    In other dragon stories the heroes devise their plans after eating the  dragon's heart. According to Philostratus,[1] Apollonius of Tyana was  worthy of being remembered for two things--his bravery in travelling  among fierce robber tribes, not then subject to Rome, and his wisdom  in learning the language of birds and other animals as the Arabs do.  This accomplishment the Arabs acquired, Philostratus explains, by  eating the hearts of dragons. The \"animals\" who utter magic words are,  of course, the Fates. Siegfried of the _Nibelungenlied_, after slaying  the Regin dragon, makes himself invulnerable by bathing in its blood.  He obtains wisdom by eating the heart: as soon as he tastes it he can  understand the language of birds, and the birds reveal to him that  Mimer is waiting to slay him. Sigurd similarly makes his plans after  eating the heart of the Fafner dragon. In Scottish legend  Finn-mac-Coul obtains the power to divine secrets by partaking of a  small portion of the seventh salmon associated with the \"well dragon\",  and Michael Scott and other folk heroes become great physicians after  tasting the juices of the middle part of the body of the white snake.  The hero of an Egyptian folk tale slays a \"deathless snake\" by cutting  it in two parts and putting sand between the parts. He then obtains  from the box, of which it is the guardian, the book of spells; when he  reads a page of the spells he knows what the birds of the sky, the  fish of the deep, and the beasts of the hill say; the book gives him  power to enchant \"the heaven and the earth, the abyss, the mountains  and the sea\".[2]    Magic and religion were never separated in Babylonia; not only the  priests but also the gods performed magical ceremonies. Ea, Merodach's  father, overcame Apsu, the husband of the dragon Tiamat, by means of  spells: he was \"the great magician of the gods\". Merodach's division  of the \"Ku-pu\" was evidently an act of contagious magic; by eating or  otherwise disposing of the vital part of the fierce and wise mother  dragon, he became endowed with her attributes, and was able to proceed  with the work of creation. Primitive peoples in our own day, like the  Abipones of Paraguay, eat the flesh of fierce and cunning animals so  that their strength, courage, and wisdom may be increased. "]]]
