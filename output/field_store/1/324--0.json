Every floor must be spotless, every chair dustless, and every bed  without a wrinkle.  Ninety-seven squirming little orphans must be  scrubbed and combed and buttoned into freshly starched ginghams; and  all ninety-seven reminded of their manners, and told to say, 'Yes,  sir,' 'No, sir,' whenever a Trustee spoke.    It was a distressing time; and poor Jerusha Abbott, being the oldest  orphan, had to bear the brunt of it.  But this particular first  Wednesday, like its predecessors, finally dragged itself to a close.  Jerusha escaped from the pantry where she had been making sandwiches  for the asylum's guests, and turned upstairs to accomplish her regular  work.  Her special care was room F, where eleven little tots, from four  to seven, occupied eleven little cots set in a row.  Jerusha assembled  her charges, straightened their rumpled frocks, wiped their noses, and  started them in an orderly and willing line towards the dining-room to  engage themselves for a blessed half hour with bread and milk and prune  pudding.    Then she dropped down on the window seat and leaned throbbing temples  against the cool glass.  She had been on her feet since five that  morning, doing everybody's bidding, scolded and hurried by a nervous  matron.  Mrs. Lippett, behind the scenes, did not always maintain that  calm and pompous dignity with which she faced an audience of Trustees  and lady visitors.  Jerusha gazed out across a broad stretch of frozen  lawn, beyond the tall iron paling that marked the confines of the  asylum, down undulating ridges sprinkled with country estates, to the  spires of the village rising from the midst of bare trees.    The day was ended--quite successfully, so far as she knew.  The  Trustees and the visiting committee had made their rounds, and read  their reports, and drunk their tea, and now were hurrying home to their  own cheerful firesides, to forget their bothersome little charges for  another month.  Jerusha leaned forward watching with curiosity--and a  touch of wistfulness--the stream of carriages and automobiles that  rolled out of the asylum gates.  In imagination she followed first one  equipage, then another, to the big houses dotted along the hillside.  She pictured herself in a fur coat and a velvet hat trimmed with  feathers leaning back in the seat and nonchalantly murmuring 'Home' to  the driver.  But on the door-sill of her home the picture grew blurred.    Jerusha had an imagination--an imagination, Mrs. Lippett told her, that  would get her into trouble if she didn't take care--but keen as it was,  it could not carry her beyond the front porch of the houses she would  enter.  Poor, eager, adventurous little Jerusha, in all her seventeen  years, had never stepped inside an ordinary house; she could not  picture the daily routine of those other human beings who carried on  their lives undiscommoded by orphans.                       Je-ru-sha Ab-bott                     You are wan-ted                     In the of-fice,                     And I think you'd                     Better hurry up!      Tommy Dillon, who had joined the choir, came singing up the stairs and  down the corridor, his chant growing louder as he approached room F.  Jerusha wrenched herself from the window and refaced the troubles of  life.    'Who wants me?' she cut into Tommy's chant with a note of sharp anxiety.                   Mrs. Lippett in the office,                 And I think she's mad.                        Ah-a-men!      Tommy piously intoned, but his accent was not entirely malicious.  Even  the most hardened little orphan felt sympathy for an erring sister who  was summoned to the office to face an annoyed matron; and Tommy liked  Jerusha even if she did sometimes jerk him by the arm and nearly scrub  his nose off.    Jerusha went without comment, but with two parallel lines on her brow.  What could have gone wrong, she wondered.  Were the sandwiches not thin  enough?  Were there shells in the nut cakes?  Had a lady visitor seen  the hole in Susie Hawthorn's stocking?  Had--O horrors!--one of the  cherubic little babes in her own room F 'sauced' a Trustee?    The long lower hall had not been lighted, and as she came downstairs, a  last Trustee stood, on the point of departure, in the open door that  led to the porte-cochere. Jerusha caught only a fleeting impression of  the man--and the impression consisted entirely of tallness.  He was  waving his arm towards an automobile waiting in the curved drive.  As  it sprang into motion and approached, head on for an instant, the  glaring headlights threw his shadow sharply against the wall inside.  The shadow pictured grotesquely elongated legs and arms that ran along  the floor and up the wall of the corridor.  It looked, for all the  world, like a huge, wavering daddy-long-legs.    Jerusha's anxious frown gave place to quick laughter.  She was by  nature a sunny soul, and had always snatched the tiniest excuse to be  amused.  If one could derive any sort of entertainment out of the  oppressive fact of a Trustee, it was something unexpected to the good.  She advanced to the office quite cheered by the tiny episode, and  presented a smiling face to Mrs. Lippett.  To her surprise the matron  was also, if not exactly smiling, at least appreciably affable; she  wore an expression almost as pleasant as the one she donned for  visitors.    'Sit down, Jerusha, I have something to say to you.'  Jerusha dropped  into the nearest chair and waited with a touch of breathlessness.  An  automobile flashed past the window; Mrs. Lippett glanced after it.    'Did you notice the gentleman who has just gone?'    'I saw his back.'    'He is one of our most affluential Trustees, and has given large sums  of money towards the asylum's support.  I am not at liberty to mention  his name; he expressly stipulated that he was to remain unknown.'    Jerusha's eyes widened slightly; she was not accustomed to being  summoned to the office to discuss the eccentricities of Trustees with  the matron.    'This gentleman has taken an interest in several of our boys.  You  remember Charles Benton and Henry Freize?  They were both sent through  college by Mr.--er--this Trustee, and both have repaid with hard work  and success the money that was so generously expended.  Other payment  the gentleman does not wish.  Heretofore his philanthropies have been  directed solely towards the boys; I have never been able to interest  him in the slightest degree in any of the girls in the institution, no  matter how deserving.  He does not, I may tell you, care for girls.'    'No, ma'am,' Jerusha murmured, since some reply seemed to be expected  at this point.    'To-day at the regular meeting, the question of your future was brought  up.'    Mrs. Lippett allowed a moment of silence to fall, then resumed in a  slow, placid manner extremely trying to her hearer's suddenly tightened  nerves.    'Usually, as you know, the children are not kept after they are  sixteen, but an exception was made in your case.  You had finished our  school at fourteen, and having done so well in your studies--not  always, I must say, in your conduct--it was determined to let you go on  in the village high school.  Now you are finishing that, and of course  the asylum cannot be responsible any longer for your support.  As it  is, you have had two years more than most.'    Mrs. Lippett overlooked the fact that Jerusha had worked hard for her  board during those two years, that the convenience of the asylum had  come first and her education second; that on days like the present she  was kept at home to scrub.    'As I say, the question of your future was brought up and your record  was discussed--thoroughly discussed.'    Mrs. Lippett brought accusing eyes to bear upon the prisoner in the  dock, and the prisoner looked guilty because it seemed to be  expected--not because she could remember any strikingly black pages in  her record.    'Of course the usual disposition of one in your place would be to put  you in a position where you could begin to work, but you have done well  in school in certain branches; it seems that your work in English has  even been brilliant.  Miss Pritchard, who is on our visiting committee,  is also on the school board; she has been talking with your rhetoric  teacher, and made a speech in your favour.  She also read aloud an  essay that you had written entitled, \"Blue Wednesday\".'    Jerusha's guilty expression this time was not assumed.    'It seemed to me that you showed little gratitude in holding up to  ridicule the institution that has done so much for you.  Had you not  managed to be funny I doubt if you would have been forgiven.  But  fortunately for you, Mr.--, that is, the gentleman who has just  gone--appears to have an immoderate sense of humour.  On the strength  of that impertinent paper, he has offered to send you to college.'    'To college?'  Jerusha's eyes grew big.  Mrs. Lippett nodded.    'He waited to discuss the terms with me.  They are unusual.  The  gentleman, I may say, is erratic.  He believes that you have  originality, and he is planning to educate you to become a writer.'    'A writer?'  Jerusha's mind was numbed.  She could only repeat Mrs.  Lippett's words.    'That is his wish.  Whether anything will come of it, the future will  show.  He is giving you a very liberal allowance, almost, for a girl  who has never had any experience in taking care of money, too liberal.  But he planned the matter in detail, and I did not feel free to make  any suggestions.  You are to remain here through the summer, and Miss  Pritchard has kindly offered to superintend your outfit.

How the fair Flower, by Zephyr woo'd, unfurls    Its panting leaves, and waves its azure curls;    Or spreads in gay undress its lucid form    To meet the sun, and shuts it to the storm;                   10    While in green veins impassion'd eddies move,    And Beauty kindles into life and love.      How the first embryon-fibre, sphere, or cube,    Lives in new forms,--a line,--a ring,--a tube;    Closed in the womb with limbs unfinish'd laves,               15    Sips with rude mouth the salutary waves;    Seeks round its cell the sanguine streams, that pass,    And drinks with crimson gills the vital gas;    Weaves with soft threads the blue meandering vein,    The heart's red concave, and the silver brain;                20    Leads the long nerve, expands the impatient sense,    And clothes in silken skin the nascent Ens.      Erewhile, emerging from its liquid bed,    It lifts in gelid air its nodding head;    The lights first dawn with trembling eyelid hails,            25    With lungs untaught arrests the balmy gales;    Tries its new tongue in tones unknown, and hears    The strange vibrations with unpractised ears;    Seeks with spread hands the bosom's velvet orbs.    With closing lips the milky fount absorbs;                    30    And, as compress'd the dulcet streams distil,    Drinks warmth and fragrance from the living rill;--    Eyes with mute rapture every waving line,    Prints with adoring kiss the Paphian shrine,    And learns erelong, the perfect form confess'd,               35    Ideal Beauty from its mother's breast.      Now in strong lines, with bolder tints design'd,    You sketch ideas, and portray the mind;    Teach how fine atoms of impinging light    To ceaseless change the visual sense excite;                  40    While the bright lens collects the rays, that swerve,    And bends their focus on the moving nerve.    How thoughts to thoughts are link'd with viewless chains,    Tribes leading tribes, and trains pursuing trains;    With shadowy trident how Volition guides,                     45    Surge after surge, his intellectual tides;    Or, Queen of Sleep, Imagination roves    With frantic Sorrows, or delirious Loves.      Go on, O FRIEND! explore with eagle-eye;    Where wrapp'd in night retiring Causes lie:                   50    Trace their slight bands, their secret haunts betray,    And give new wonders to the beam of day;    Till, link by link with step aspiring trod,    You climb from NATURE to the throne of GOD.    --So saw the Patriarch with admiring eyes                     55    From earth to heaven a golden ladder rise;    Involv'd in clouds the mystic scale ascends,    And brutes and angels crowd the distant ends.

It  happened, perhaps unfortunately for the inquirers into the knowledge of  diseases, that other sciences had received improvement previous to their  own; whence, instead of comparing the properties belonging to animated  nature with each other, they, idly ingenious, busied themselves in  attempting to explain the laws of life by those of mechanism and chemistry;  they considered the body as an hydraulic machine, and the fluids as passing  through a series of chemical changes, forgetting that animation was its  essential characteristic.    The great CREATOR of all things has infinitely diversified the works of his  hands, but has at the same time stamped a certain similitude on the  features of nature, that demonstrates to us, that _the whole is one family  of one parent_. On this similitude is founded all rational analogy; which,  so long as it is concerned in comparing the essential properties of bodies,  leads us to many and important discoveries; but when with licentious  activity it links together objects, otherwise discordant, by some fanciful  similitude; it may indeed collect ornaments for wit and poetry, but  philosophy and truth recoil from its combinations.    The want of a theory, deduced from such strict analogy, to conduct the  practice of medicine is lamented by its professors; for, as a great number  of unconnected facts are difficult to be acquired, and to be reasoned from,  the art of medicine is in many instances less efficacious under the  direction of its wisest practitioners; and by that busy crowd, who either  boldly wade in darkness, or are led into endless error by the glare of  false theory, it is daily practised to the destruction of thousands; add to  this the unceasing injury which accrues to the public by the perpetual  advertisements of pretended nostrums; the minds of the indolent become  superstitiously fearful of diseases, which they do not labour under; and  thus become the daily prey of some crafty empyric.    A theory founded upon nature, that should bind together the scattered facts  of medical knowledge, and converge into one point of view the laws of  organic life, would thus on many accounts contribute to the interest of  society. It would capacitate men of moderate abilities to practise the art  of healing with real advantage to the public; it would enable every one of  literary acquirements to distinguish the genuine disciples of medicine from  those of boastful effrontery, or of wily address; and would teach mankind  in some"]]]
