It is not a personal tribute. I speak, on behalf of  the whole fraternity of writers, this word of gratitude--and envy.    No one who has ever done any writing, or has any ambition toward  doing so, can ever be a Perfect Reader. Such a one is not  disinterested. He reads, inevitably, in a professional spirit. He  does not surrender himself with complete willingness of enjoyment.  He reads \"to see how the other fellow does it\"; to note the turn of  a phrase, the cadence of a paragraph; carrying on a constant  subconscious comparison with his own work. He broods constantly as  to whether he himself, in some happy conjuncture of quick mind and  environing silence and the sudden perfect impulse, might have  written something like that. He is (poor devil) confessedly selfish.  On every page he is aware of his own mind running with him, tingling  him with needle-pricks of conscience for the golden chapters he has  never written. And so his reading is, in a way, the perfection of  exquisite misery--and his writing also. When he writes, he yearns to  be reading; when he reads, he yearns to be writing.    But the Perfect Reader, for whom all fine things are written, knows  no such delicate anguish. When he reads, it is without any _arriere  pensee_, any twingeing consciousness of self. I like to think of one  Perfect Reader of my acquaintance. He is a seafaring man, and this  very evening he is in his bunk, at sea, the day's tasks completed.  Over his head is a suitable electric lamp. In his mouth is a pipe  with that fine wine-dark mahogany sheen that resides upon excellent  briar of many years' service. He has had (though I speak only by  guess) a rummer of hot toddy to celebrate the greatest of all  Evenings. At his elbow is a porthole, brightly curtained with a  scrap of clean chintz, and he can hear the swash of the seas along  his ship's tall side. And now he is reading. I can see him reading.  I know just how his mind feels! Oh, the Perfect Reader! There is not  an allusion that he misses; in all those lovely printed words he  sees the subtle secrets that a lesser soul would miss. He (bless his  heart!) is not thinking how he himself would have written it; his  clear, keen, outreaching mind is intent only to be one in spirit  with the invisible and long-dead author. I tell you, if there is  anywhere a return of the vanished, it is then, at such moments, over  the tilted book held by the Perfect Reader.    And how quaint it is that he should diminish himself so modestly.  \"Of course\" (he says), \"I'm only a Reader, and I don't know anything  about writing----\" Why, you adorable creature, _You_ are our court  of final appeal, you are the one we come to, humbly, to know  whether, anywhere in our miserable efforts to set out our unruly  hearts in parallel lines, we have done an honest thing. What do we  care for what (most of) the critics say? They (we know only too  well) are not criticising _us_, but, unconsciously, themselves. They  skew their own dreams into their comment, and blame us for not  writing what they once wanted to. You we can trust, for you have  looked at life largely and without pettifogging qualms. The parallel  lines of our eager pages meet at Infinity--that is, in the infinite  understanding and judgment of the Perfect Reader.    The enjoyment of literature is a personal communion; it cannot be  outwardly instilled. The utmost the critic can do is read the  marriage service over the reader and the book. The union is  consummated, if at all, in secret. But now and then there comes up  the aisle a new Perfect Reader, and all the ghosts of literature  wait for him, starry-eyed, by the altar. And as long as there are  Perfect Readers, who read with passion, with glory, and then speed  to tell their friends, there will always be, ever and anon, a  Perfect Writer.    And so, dear Perfect Reader, a Merry Christmas to you and a New Year  of books worthy your devotion! When you revive from that book that  holds you in spell, and find this little note on the cold hearth, I  hope you may be pleased.            [Illustration]        THE AUTOGENESIS OF A POET      The mind trudges patiently behind the senses. Day by day a thousand  oddities and charms outline themselves tenderly upon consciousness,  but it may be long before understanding comes with brush and colour  to fill in the tracery. One learns nothing until he rediscovers it  for himself. Every now and then, in reading, I have come across  something which has given me the wild surmise of pioneering mingled  with the faint magic of familiarity--for instance, some of the  famous dicta of Wordsworth and Coleridge and Shelley about poetry. I  realized, then, that a teacher had told me these things in my  freshman year at college--fifteen years ago. I jotted them down at  that time, but they were mere catchwords. It had taken me fifteen  years of vigorous living to overhaul those catchwords and fill them  with a meaning of my own. The two teachers who first gave me some  suspicion of what lies in the kingdom of poetry--who gave \"so sweet  a prospect into the way as will entice any man to enter into  it\"--are both dead. May I mention their names?--Francis B. Gummere  and Albert Elmer Hancock, both of Haverford College. I cannot thank  them as, now, I would like to. For I am (I think) approaching a  stage where I can somewhat understand and relish the things of which  they spoke. And I wonder afresh at the patience and charity of those  who go on lecturing, unabated in zest, to boys of whom one in ten  may perhaps, fifteen years later, begin to grasp their message.    In so far as any formal or systematic discipline of thought was  concerned, I think I may say my education was a complete failure.  For this I had only my own smattering and desultory habit of mind to  blame and also a vivid troublesome sense of the beauty of it all.  The charm of the prismatic fringe round the edges made juggling with  the lens too tempting, and a clear persistent focus was never  attained. Considered (oddly enough) by my mates as the pattern of a  diligent scholar, I was in reality as idle as the idlest of them,  which is saying much; though I confess that my dilettantism was not  wholly disreputable. My mind excellently exhibited the Heraclitean  doctrine: a constant flux of information passed through it, but  nothing"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15795"],[0,"The Rover Boys in Camp; or, The Rivals of Pine Island (#1)"],[1,"ROVER BOYS IN CAMP    Or, The Rivals of Pine Island    by    Arthur M. Winfield    1904                INTRODUCTION    My Dear Boys: \"The Rover Boys in Camp\" is a complete story in itself,  but forms the eighth volume of \"The Rover Boys Series for Young  Americans.\"    As I have mentioned before, when I started this line of stories I had  in mind to make not more than three, or possibly four, volumes. But the  publication of \"Rover Boys at School,\" \"Rover Boys on the Ocean,\"  \"Rover Boys in the Jungle,\" and \"Rover Boys Out West\" did not appear to  satisfy my readers, and so I followed with \"Rover Boys on the Great  Lakes,\" \"Rover Boys in the Mountains,\" and lastly with \"Rover Boys on  Land and Sea.\" But the publishers say there is still a cry for \"more!  more!\" and so I now present to you this new Rover Boys book, which  relates the adventures of Dick, Tom, and Sam, and a number of their  old-time friends, at home, at dear old Putnam Hall, and in camp on Pine  Island.    In writing this tale I have had in mind two thoughts--one to give my  young readers an out-and-out story of jolly summer adventure, along  with a little touch of mystery, and the other to show them that it very  often pays to return good for evil. Arnold Baxter had done much to  bring trouble to the Rover family, but what Dick Rover did in return  was Christian-like in the highest meaning of that term. Dick was not a  \"goody-goody\" youth, but he was a thoroughly manly one, and his example  is well worth following by any lad who wishes to make something of  himself.    Once more let me thank all of those who have expressed themselves as  satisfied with the previous stories in this series. I earnestly trust  the present volume will also prove acceptable to them, and will do them  good.    Affectionately and sincerely yours,    ARTHUR M. WINFIELD.          CONTENTS         I.

Why, half the folks won't believe our  story when they hear it.\"    \"They'll have to believe it.\" Sam hopped down to the depot platform,  followed by the others. \"Wonder if the folks got that telegram I  forwarded from Buffalo?\"    \"They must have, for there is Jack with the big carriage,\" said Tom,  and walked over to the turnout he mentioned. \"Hullo, Jack!\" he called  out. \"How is everybody?\"    \"Master Tom!\" ejaculated Jack Ness, the Rovers' hired man. \"Back at  last, are you, an' safe an' sound?\"    \"Sound as a dollar, Jack. How are the folks?\"    \"Your father is putty well, and so is your Uncle Randolph. Your Aunt  Martha got so excited a-thinkin' you was coming hum she got a  headache.\"    \"Dear Aunt Martha!\" murmured Tom. \"I'll soon cure her of that.\" He  turned to his brothers. \"What shall we do about the trunks? We can't  take 'em in the carriage.\"    \"Aleck is comin' for them boxes,\" said the hired man. \"There's his  wagon now.\"    A box wagon came dashing up to the depot platform, with a tall,  good-looking colored man on the seat. The eyes of the colored man lit  up with pleasure when he caught sight of the boys.    \"Well! well! well!\" he ejaculated, leaping down and rushing forward.  \"Heah yo' are at las', bless you! I'se been dat worried 'bout yo' I  couldn't 'most sleep fo' t'ree nights. An' jess to t'ink yo' was cast  away on an island in de middle of dat Pacific Ocean! It's a wonder dem  cannonballs didn't eat yo' up.\"    \"Thanks, but we didn't meet any 'cannonballs,' Aleck, I am thankful to  say,\" replied Dick Rover. \"Our greatest trouble was with some  mutineers who got drunk and wanted to run things to suit themselves.  They might have got the best of us, but a warship visited the island  just in the nick of time and rescued us.\"    \"So I heared out ob dat letter wot yo' writ yo' father. An' to t'ink  dat Miss Dora Stanhope and de Laning gals was wrecked wid yo'! It's  wonderful!\"    \"It certainly was strange, Aleck. But, come, I am anxious to get home.  Here are the trunk checks,\" and Dick passed the brasses over.    In a moment more the three boys had entered the carriage, along with  Jack Ness. Tom insisted on driving, and away they went at a spanking  gait, over Swift River, through the little village of Dexter's  Corners, and then out on the road that led to Valley Brook farm.    As my old readers know, the Rover boys were three in number, as already  introduced. They were the sons of Anderson Rover, a well-to-do  gentleman, who was now living in retirement at Valley Brook, in company  with his brother Randolph, and the latter's wife, Martha.    While Anderson Rover had been on a hunt for gold in the heart of  Africa, the three boys had been sent by their Uncle Randolph to a  military academy known as Putnam Hall. Here they made many friends and  also a few enemies, the worst of the latter being Dan Baxter, a bully  who wanted his way in everything. Baxter was the offspring of a family  of low reputation, and his father, Arnold Baxter, was now in prison for  various misdeeds.    The first term at school had been followed by an exciting chase on the  ocean, after which the boys had gone with their uncle to the jungles of  Africa, in a search after Anderson Rover. After the parent was found it  was learned that Arnold Baxter was trying to swindle the Rovers out of  a valuable gold mine in the far West, but this plot, after some  exciting adventures, was nipped in the bud.    The trip West had tired the boys, and they hailed an outing on the  Great Lakes with delight. During this outing they learned something  about a treasure located in the heart of the Adirondack Mountains, and  the next winter visited the locality and unearthed a box containing  gold, silver, and precious stones, worth several thousands of dollars.  During this treasure-hunt Dan Baxter did his best to bring the Rover  boys to grief, but without success.    After the winter in the Adirondacks, the boys had expected to return at  once to Putnam Hall to continue their studies. But three pupils were  taken down with scarlet fever, and the academy was promptly closed by  the master, Captain Victor Putnam.    \"That gives us another holiday,\" Tom had said. \"Let us put in the time  by traveling,\" and, later on, it was decided that the boys should visit  California for their health. This they did, and in the seventh volume  of this series, entitled \"The Rover Boys on Land and Sea,\" I related  the particulars of how they were carried off to sea during a violent  storm, in company with three of their old-time girl friends, Dora  Stanhope and her cousins, Nellie and Grace Laning. It may be mentioned  here that Dick thought Dora Stanhope the sweetest girl in the world,  and Tom and Sam were equally smitten with Nellie and Grace Laning.    Being cast away on the Pacific was productive of additional adventures  and surprises. On a ship that picked the girls and boys up they fell in  again with Dan Baxter, and he did all in his power to make trouble for  them. When all were cast away on a deserted island, Dan Baxter joined  some mutineers among the sailors, and there was a fight which  threatened to end seriously for our friends. But as luck would have it,  a United States warship hove into sight, and from that moment the boys  and girls, and the friends, who had stuck to them through thick and  thin, were safe.    Before the warship left the island a search was made for Dan Baxter and  for those who had mutinied with him. But the bully and his evil-minded  followers kept out of sight, and so they were left behind to shift for  themselves.    \"Do you think that we will ever see Dan Baxter again?\" Sam had  questioned.    \"I hardly think so,\" had been Dick's reply. But in this surmise the  elder Rover boy was mistaken, as later events will prove.    The journey across the Pacific to San Francisco was accomplished  without incident. As soon as the Golden Gate was reached the boys,  and also the girls, sent telegrams to their folks, telling them that  all was well.    Mrs. Stanhope was staying at Santa Barbara for her health. All of the  girls had been stopping with her, and now it was decided that Dora,  Nellie, and Grace should go to her again.    \"It"]]]
