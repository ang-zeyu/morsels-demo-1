I am going to look it over and burn up  the rubbish this evening.\"    She glanced once more at the letter in her hand, then with a sniff tossed  it upon the fire.    \"Yes'm,\" said Norah, as she set down the box with a thump. She stooped once  more to pick up something which had fallen out when the cover was jarred  open. It was a pink papier-mache angel, such as are often hung from the top  of Christmas trees as a crowning symbol. Norah stood holding it between  thumb and finger, staring amazedly. Who would think to find such a bit of  frivolity in the house of Miss Terry!    Her mistress looked up from the fire, where the bit of writing was writhing  painfully, and caught the expression of Norah's face.    \"What have you there?\" she asked, frowning, as she took the object into her  own hands. \"The Christmas Angel!\" she exclaimed under her breath. \"I had  quite forgotten it.\" Then as if it burned her fingers she thrust the little  image back into the box and turned to Norah brusquely. \"There, that's all.  You can go now, Norah,\" she said.    \"Yes'm,\" answered the maid. She hesitated. \"If you please'm, it's Christmas  Eve.\"    \"Well, I believe so,\" snapped Miss Terry, who seemed to be in a  particularly bad humor this evening. \"What do you want?\"    Norah flushed; but she was hardened to her mistress's manner. \"Only to ask  if I may go out for a little while to see the decorations and hear the  singing.\"    \"Decorations? Singing? Fiddlestick!\" retorted Miss Terry, poker in hand.  \"What decorations? What singing?\"    \"Why, all the windows along the street are full of candles,\" answered  Norah; \"rows of candles in every house, to light the Christ Child on his  way when he comes through the city to-night.\"    \"Fiddlestick!\" again snarled her mistress.    \"And choir-boys are going about the streets, they say, singing carols in  front of the lighted houses,\" continued Norah enthusiastically. \"It must  sound so pretty!\"    \"They had much better be at home in bed. I believe people are losing their  minds!\"    \"Please'm, may I go?\" asked Norah again.    Norah had no puritanic traditions to her account. Moreover she was young  and warm and enthusiastic. Sometimes the spell of Miss Terry's sombre house  threatened her to the point of desperation. It was so this Christmas Eve;  but she made her request with apparent calmness.    \"Yes, go along,\" assented her mistress ungraciously.    \"Thank you, 'm,\" said the servant demurely, but with a brightening of her  blue eyes. And presently the area door banged behind her quick-retreating  footsteps.    \"H'm! Didn't take her long to get ready!\" muttered Miss Terry, giving the  fire a vicious poke. She was alone in the house, on Christmas Eve, and not  a man, woman, or child in the world cared. Well, it was what she wanted. It  was of her own doing. If she had wished--    She sat back in her chair, with thin, long hands lying along the arms of  it, gazing into the fire. A bit of paper there was crumbling into ashes.  Alone on Christmas Eve! Even Norah had some relation with the world  outside. Was there not a stalwart officer waiting for her on the nearest  corner? Even Norah could feel a simple childish pleasure in candles and  carols and merriment, and the old, old superstition.    \"Stuff and nonsense!\" mused Miss Terry scornfully. \"What is our Christmas,  anyway? A time for shopkeepers to sell and for foolish folks to kill  themselves in buying. Christmas spirit? No! It is all humbug,--all  selfishness, and worry; an unwholesome season of unnatural activities. I am  glad I am out of it. I am glad no one expects anything of me,--nor I of any  one. I am quite independent; blessedly independent of the whole foolish  business. It is a good time to begin clearing up for the new year. I'm glad  I thought of it. I've long threatened to get rid of the stuff that has  been accumulating in that corner of the attic. Now I will begin.\"    She tugged the packing-case an inch nearer the fire. It was like Miss Terry  to insist upon that nearer inch. Then she raised the cover. It was a box  full of children's battered toys, old-fashioned and quaint; the toys in  vogue thirty--forty--fifty years earlier, when Miss Terry was a child. She  gave a reminiscent sniff as she threw up the cover and saw on the under  side of it a big label of pasteboard unevenly lettered.    [Illustration: PLAY BOX OF TOM TERRY AND ANGELINA TERRY (scrawl)]    \"Humph!\" she snorted. There was a great deal in that \"humph.\" It meant:  Yes, Tom's name had plenty of room, while poor little Angelina had to  squeeze in as well as she could. How like Tom! This accounted for  everything, even to his not being in his sister's house this very night.  How unreasonable he had been!    Miss Terry shrugged impatiently. Why think of Tom to-night? Years ago he  had deliberately cut himself adrift from her interests. No need to think of  him now. It was too late to appease her. But here were all these toys to be  got rid of. The fire was hungry for them. Why not begin?    Miss Terry stooped to poke over the contents of the box with lean, long  fingers. In one corner thrust up a doll's arm; in another, an animal's tail  pointed heavenward. She caught glimpses of glitter and tinsel, wheels and  fragments of unidentifiable toys.    \"What rubbish!\" she said. \"Yes, I'll burn them all. They are good for  nothing else. I suppose some folks would try to give them away, and bore a  lot of people to death. They seem to think they are saving something, that  way. Nonsense! I know better. It is all foolishness, this craze for giving.  Most things are better destroyed as soon as you are done with them. Why,  nobody wants such truck as this. Now, could any child ever have cared for  so silly a thing?\" She pulled out a faded jumping-jack, and regarded it  scornfully. \"Idiotic! Such toys are demoralizing for children--weaken their  minds. It is a shame to think how every one seems bound to spoil children,  especially at Christmas time. Well, no one can say that I have added to the  shameful waste.\"    Miss Terry tossed the poor jumping-jack on the fire, and eyed his last  contortions with grim satisfaction.    But as she watched, a quaint idea came to her. She was famous for eccentric  ideas.    \"I will try an experiment,\" she said. \"I will prove once for all my point  about the 'Christmas spirit.' I will drop some of these old toys out on the  sidewalk and see what happens. It may be interesting.\"          CHAPTER II    JACK-IN-THE-BOX      Miss Terry"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15718"],[0,"How To Write Special Feature Articles (#1)"],[1,"TO WRITE SPECIAL FEATURE ARTICLES    A HANDBOOK FOR REPORTERS, CORRESPONDENTS  AND FREE-LANCE WRITERS WHO DESIRE TO  CONTRIBUTE TO POPULAR MAGAZINES AND  MAGAZINE SECTIONS OF NEWSPAPERS    BY    WILLARD GROSVENOR BLEYER, PH.D.    _Author of \"Newspaper Writing and Editing,\" and \"Types of News Writing\";  Director of the Course in Journalism in the University of Wisconsin_        BOSTON, NEW YORK, CHICAGO, SAN FRANCISCO    HOUGHTON MIFFLIN COMPANY    The Riverside Press Cambridge    The Riverside Press  CAMBRIDGE, MASSACHUSETTS  PRINTED IN THE U.S.A.          PREFACE      This book is the result of twelve years' experience in teaching  university students to write special feature articles for newspapers and  popular magazines. By applying the methods outlined in the following  pages, young men and women have been able to prepare articles that have  been accepted by many newspaper and magazine editors. The success that  these students have achieved leads the author to believe that others who  desire to write special articles may be aided by the suggestions given  in this book.    Although innumerable books on short-story writing have been published,  no attempt has hitherto been made to discuss in detail the writing of  special feature articles. In the absence of any generally accepted  method of approach to the subject, it has been necessary to work out a  systematic classification of the various types of articles and of the  different kinds of titles, beginnings, and similar details, as well as  to supply names by which to identify them.    A careful analysis of current practice in the writing of special feature  stories and popular magazine articles is the basis of the methods  presented. In this analysis an effort has been made to show the  application of the principles of composition to the writing of articles.  Examples taken from representative newspapers and magazines are freely  used to illustrate the methods discussed. To encourage students to  analyze typical articles, the second part of the book is devoted to a  collection of newspaper and magazine articles of various types, with an  outline for the analysis of them.    Particular emphasis is placed on methods of popularizing such knowledge  as is not available to the general reader. This has been done in the  belief that it is important for the average person to know of the  progress that is being made in every field of human endeavor, in order  that he may, if possible, apply the results to his own affairs. The  problem, therefore, is to show aspiring writers how to present  discoveries, inventions, new methods, and every significant advance in  knowledge, in an accurate and attractive form.    To train students to write articles for newspapers and popular magazines  may, perhaps, be regarded by some college instructors in composition as  an undertaking scarcely worth their while. They would doubtless prefer  to encourage their students to write what is commonly called  \"literature.\" The fact remains, nevertheless, that the average  undergraduate cannot write anything that approximates literature,  whereas experience has shown that many students can write acceptable  popular articles. Moreover, since the overwhelming majority of Americans  read only newspapers and magazines, it is by no means an unimportant  task for our universities to train writers to supply the steady demand  for well-written articles. The late Walter Hines Page, founder of the  _World's Work_ and former editor of the _Atlantic Monthly_, presented  the whole situation effectively in an article on \"The Writer and the  University,\" when he wrote:        The journeymen writers write almost all that almost all Americans      read. This is a fact that we love to fool ourselves about. We talk      about \"literature\" and we talk about \"hack writers,\" implying that      the reading that we do is of literature. The truth all the while is,      we read little else than the writing of the hacks--living hacks,      that is, men and women who write for pay. We may hug the notion that      our life and thought are not really affected by current literature,      that we read the living writers only for utilitarian reasons, and      that our real intellectual life is fed by the great dead writers.      But hugging this delusion does not change the fact that the      intellectual life even of most educated persons, and certainly of      the mass of the population, is fed chiefly by the writers of our own      time....        Every editor of a magazine, every editor of an earnest and worthy      newspaper, every publisher of books, has dozens or hundreds of      important tasks for which he cannot find capable men; tasks that      require scholarship, knowledge of science, or of politics, or of      industry, or of literature, along with experience in writing      accurately in the language of the people.    Special feature stories and popular magazine articles constitute a type  of writing particularly adapted to the ability of the novice, who has  developed some facility in writing, but who may not have sufficient  maturity or talent to undertake successful short-story writing or other  distinctly literary work. Most special articles cannot be regarded as  literature. Nevertheless, they afford the young writer an opportunity to  develop whatever ability he possesses. Such writing teaches him four  things that are invaluable to any one who aspires to do literary work.  It trains him to observe what is going on about him, to select what will  interest the average reader, to organize material effectively, and to  present it attractively. If this book helps the inexperienced writer,  whether he is in or out of college, to acquire these four essential  qualifications for success, it will have accomplished its purpose.    For permission to reprint complete articles, the author is indebted to  the editors of the _Boston Herald_, the _Christian Science Monitor_, the  _Boston Evening Transcript_, the _New York Evening Post_, the _Detroit  News_, the _Milwaukee Journal_, the _Kansas City Star_, the _New York  Sun_, the _Providence Journal_, the _Ohio State Journal_, the _New York  World_, the _Saturday Evening Post_, the _Independent_, the _Country  Gentleman_, the _Outlook_, _McClure's Magazine_, _Everybody's Magazine_,  the _Delineator_, the _Pictorial Review_, _Munsey's Magazine_, the  _American Magazine_, _System_, _Farm and Fireside_, the _Woman's Home  Companion_, the _Designer_, and the Newspaper Enterprise Association.  The author is also under obligation to the many newspapers and magazines  from which excerpts, titles, and other material have been quoted.    At every stage in the preparation of this book the author has had the  advantage of the cooeperation and assistance of his wife, Alice Haskell  Bleyer.    _University of Wisconsin  Madison, August, 1919_          CONTENTS      PART I      I.
