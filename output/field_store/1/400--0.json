Printed in the United States of America          FOREWORD      Tempting boys to be what they should be--giving them in wholesome form  what they want--that is the purpose and power of Scouting. To help  parents and leaders of youth secure _books boys like best_ that are also  best for boys, the Boy Scouts of America organized EVERY BOY'S LIBRARY.  The books included, formerly sold at prices ranging from $1.50 to $2.00  but, by special arrangement with the several publishers interested, are  now sold in the EVERY BOY'S LIBRARY Edition at $1.00 per volume.    The books of EVERY BOY'S LIBRARY were selected by the Library Commission  of the Boy Scouts of America, consisting of George F. Bowerman,  Librarian, Public Library of the District of Columbia; Harrison W.  Craver, Director, Engineering Societies Library, New York City; Claude  G. Leland, Superintendent, Bureau of Libraries, Board of Education, New  York City; Edward F. Stevens, Librarian, Pratt Institute Free Library,  Brooklyn, N.Y., and Franklin K. Mathiews, Chief Scout Librarian. Only  such books were chosen by the Commission as proved to be, by _a nation  wide canvas_, most in demand by the boys themselves. Their popularity is  further attested by the fact that in the EVERY BOY'S LIBRARY Edition,  more than a million and a quarter copies of these books have already  been sold.    We know so well, are reminded so often of the worth of the good book and  great, that too often we fail to observe or understand the influence for  good of a boy's recreational reading. Such books may influence him for  good or ill as profoundly as his play activities, of which they are a  vital part. The needful thing is to find stories in which the heroes  have the characteristics boys so much admire--unquenchable courage,  immense resourcefulness, absolute fidelity, conspicuous greatness. We  believe the books of EVERY BOY'S LIBRARY measurably well meet this  challenge.    BOY SCOUTS OF AMERICA,            [signed] James E. West            Chief Scout Executive.

Restrictions of  all sorts had become onerous to me, and in my reading of the adventures  of the bold sea-rovers of the main, I had unconsciously selected those  portions of a pirate's life which were attractive to me, and had totally  disregarded all the rest.    In fact, I had a great desire to become what might be called a marine  Robin Hood. I would take from the rich and give to the poor; I would run  my long, low, black craft by the side of the merchantman, and when I had  loaded my vessel with the rich stuffs and golden ingots which composed  her cargo, I would sail away to some poor village, and make its  inhabitants prosperous and happy for the rest of their lives by a  judicious distribution of my booty.    I would always be as free as a sea-bird. My men would be devoted to me,  and my word would be their law. I would decide for myself whether this  or that proceeding would be proper, generous, and worthy of my unlimited  power; when tired of sailing, I would retire to my island,--the position  of which, in a beautiful semi-tropic ocean, would be known only to  myself and to my crew,--and there I would pass happy days in the company  of my books, my works of art, and all the various treasures I had taken  from the mercenary vessels which I had overhauled.    Such was my notion of a pirate's life. I would kill nobody; the very  sight of my black flag would be sufficient to put an end to all thought  of resistance on the part of my victims, who would no more think of  fighting me, than a fat bishop would have thought of lifting his hand  against Robin Hood and his merry men; and I truly believe that I  expected my conscience to have a great deal more to do in the way of  approval of my actions, than it had found necessary in the course of my  ordinary school-boy life.    I mention these early impressions because I have a notion that a great  many people--and not only young people--have an idea of piracy not  altogether different from that of my boyhood. They know that pirates  are wicked men, that, in fact, they are sea-robbers or maritime  murderers, but their bold and adventurous method of life, their bravery,  daring, and the exciting character of their expeditions, give them  something of the same charm and interest which belong to the robber  knights of the middle ages. The one mounts his mailed steed and clanks  his long sword against his iron stirrup, riding forth into the world  with a feeling that he can do anything that pleases him, if he finds  himself strong enough. The other springs into his rakish craft, spreads  his sails to the wind, and dashes over the sparkling main with a feeling  that he can do anything he pleases, provided he be strong enough.    The first pirates who made themselves known in American waters were the  famous buccaneers; these began their career in a very commonplace and  unobjectionable manner, and the name by which they were known had  originally no piratical significance. It was derived from the French  word _boucanier_, signifying \"a drier of beef.\"    Some of the West India islands, especially San Domingo, were almost  overrun with wild cattle of various kinds, and this was owing to the  fact that the Spaniards had killed off nearly all the natives, and so  had left the interior of the islands to the herds of cattle which had  increased rapidly. There were a few settlements on the seacoast, but  the Spaniards did not allow the inhabitants of these to trade with any  nation but their own, and consequently the people were badly supplied  with the necessaries of life.    But the trading vessels which sailed from Europe to that part of the  Caribbean Sea were manned by bold and daring sailors, and when they knew  that San Domingo contained an abundance of beef cattle, they did not  hesitate to stop at the little seaports to replenish their stores. The  natives of the island were skilled in the art of preparing beef by  smoking and drying it,--very much in the same way in which our Indians  prepare \"jerked meat\" for winter use.    But so many vessels came to San Domingo for beef that there were not  enough people on the island to do all the hunting and drying that was  necessary, so these trading vessels frequently anchored in some quiet  cove, and the crews went on shore and devoted themselves to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17192"],[0,"The Raven (#1)"],[1,"Transcriber's Notes:    In the List of Illustrations I restored a missing single quote after \"Lenore!\":    \"'Wretch,' I cried, 'thy God hath lent thee--by these angels he hath sent thee    Respite--respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore!'\"    The List of Illustrations uses 'visitor' where the poem and the actual  illustration use 'visiter'.             *       *       *       *       *          THE RAVEN    BY  EDGAR ALLAN POE    ILLUSTRATED  BY GUSTAVE DORE    [Illustration]    WITH COMMENT BY EDMUND C.

Tietze._    The secret of the Sphinx.                        _R. Staudenbaur._          COMMENT ON THE POEM.      The secret of a poem, no less than a jest's prosperity, lies in the ear of  him that hears it. Yield to its spell, accept the poet's mood: this, after  all, is what the sages answer when you ask them of its value. Even though  the poet himself, in his other mood, tell you that his art is but sleight  of hand, his food enchanter's food, and offer to show you the trick of  it,--believe him not. Wait for his prophetic hour; then give yourself to  his passion, his joy or pain. \"We are in Love's hand to-day!\" sings  Gautier, in Swinburne's buoyant paraphrase,--and from morn to sunset we are  wafted on the violent sea: there is but one love, one May, one flowery  strand. Love is eternal, all else unreal and put aside. The vision has an  end, the scene changes; but we have gained something, the memory of a  charm. As many poets, so many charms. There is the charm of Evanescence,  that which lends to supreme beauty and grace an aureole of Pathos. Share  with Landor his one \"night of memories and of sighs\" for Rose Aylmer, and  you have this to the full.    And now take the hand of a new-world minstrel, strayed from some proper  habitat to that rude and dissonant America which, as Baudelaire saw, \"was  for Poe only a vast prison through which he ran, hither and thither, with  the feverish agitation of a being created to breathe in a purer world,\" and  where \"his interior life, spiritual as a poet, spiritual even as a  drunkard, was but one perpetual effort to escape the influence of this  antipathetical atmosphere.\" Clasp the sensitive hand of a troubled singer  dreeing thus his weird, and share with him the clime in which he  found,--never throughout the day, always in the night,--if not the Atlantis  whence he had wandered, at least a place of refuge from the bounds in which  by day he was immured.    To one land only he has power to lead you, and for one night only can you  share his dream. A tract of neither Earth nor Heaven: \"No-man's-land,\" out  of Space, out of Time. Here are the perturbed ones, through whose eyes,  like those of the Cenci, the soul finds windows though the mind is dazed;  here spirits, groping for the path which leads to Eternity, are halted and  delayed. It is the limbo of \"planetary souls,\" wherein are all moonlight  uncertainties, all lost loves and illusions. Here some are fixed in trance,  the only respite attainable; others             \"move fantastically      To a discordant melody:\"    while everywhere are        \"Sheeted Memories of the Past--      Shrouded forms that start and sigh      As they pass the wanderer by.\"    Such is the land, and for one night we enter it,--a night of astral phases  and recurrent chimes. Its monodies are twelve poems, whose music strives to  change yet ever is the same. One by one they sound, like the chiming of the  brazen and ebony clock, in \"The Masque of the Red Death,\" which made the  waltzers pause with \"disconcert and tremulousness and meditation,\" as often  as the hour came round.    Of all these mystical cadences, the plaint of _The Raven_, vibrating  through the portal, chiefly has impressed the outer world. What things go  to the making of a poem,--and how true in this, as in most else, that race  which named its bards \"the makers\"? A work is called out of the void. Where  there was nothing, it remains,--a new creation, part of the treasure of  mankind. And a few exceptional lyrics, more than others that are equally  creative, compel us to think anew how bravely the poet's pen turns things  unknown              \"to shapes, and gives to airy nothing      A local habitation, and a name.\"    Each seems without a prototype, yet all fascinate us with elements wrested  from the shadow of the Supernatural. Now the highest imagination is  concerned about the soul of things; it may or may not inspire the Fantasy  that peoples with images the interlunar vague. Still, one of these lyrics,  in its smaller way, affects us with a sense of uniqueness, as surely as the  sublimer works of a supernatural cast,--Marlowe's \"Faustus,\" the \"Faust\" of  Goethe, \"Manfred,\" or even those ethereal masterpieces, \"The Tempest\" and  \"A Midsummer Night's Dream.\" More than one, while otherwise unique, has  some burden or refrain which haunts the memory,--once heard, never  forgotten, like the tone of a rarely used but distinctive organ-stop.  Notable among them is Buerger's \"Lenore,\" that ghostly and resonant ballad,  the lure and foil of the translators. Few will deny that Coleridge's  wondrous \"Rime of the Ancient Mariner\" stands at their very head. \"Le  Juif-Errant\" would have claims, had Beranger been a greater poet; and, but  for their remoteness from popular sympathy, \"The Lady of Shalott\" and \"The  Blessed Damozel\" might be added to the list. It was given to Edgar Allan  Poe to produce two lyrics, \"The Bells\" and _The Raven_, each of which,  although perhaps of less beauty than those of Tennyson and Rossetti, is a  unique. \"Ulalume,\" while equally strange and imaginative, has not the  universal quality that is a portion of our test.    _The"]]]
