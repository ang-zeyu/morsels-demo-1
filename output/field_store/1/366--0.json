Information is raw data from any source that may be  fragmentary, contradictory, unreliable, ambiguous, deceptive, or  wrong. Intelligence is information that has been collected,  integrated, evaluated, analyzed, and interpreted. Finished  intelligence is the final product of the Intelligence Cycle ready to  be delivered to the policymaker.    There are three types of finished intelligence: basic, current, and  estimative. Basic intelligence is the fundamental and factual  reference material on a country or issue, current intelligence reports  on new developments, and estimative intelligence judges probable  outcomes. The three are mutually supporting because basic intelligence  is the foundation on which the other two are based, current  intelligence helps to continually update the knowledge foundation, and  estimative intelligence serves to revise overall interpretations of  country and issue prospects for both basic and current intelligence.  The World Factbook, The President's Daily Brief, and National  Intelligence Estimates are examples of the three types of finished  intelligence.    The United States has carried on foreign intelligence activities since  the days of George Washington, but only since World War II have they  been coordinated on a governmentwide basis. Three programs have  highlighted the development of coordinated basic intelligence since  that time: (1) the Joint Army Navy Intelligence Studies (JANIS), (2)  the National Intelligence Survey (NIS), and (3) The World Factbook.    During World War II intelligence consumers realized that the  production of basic intelligence by different components of the US  Government resulted in a great duplication of effort and conflicting  information. The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941 brought home  to Congressional and executive branch leaders the need for integrating  and coordinating departmental reports to national policymakers.  Detailed general information was needed not only on such major powers  as Germany and Japan, but also on places of little previous interest.  In the Pacific Theater, for example, the Navy and Marines had to  launch amphibious operations against many islands about which  information was unconfirmed or nonexistent. Intelligence authorities  resolved that the United States should never again be caught  unprepared.    In 1943, Gen. George B. Strong (G-2), Adm. H. C. Train (Office of  Naval Intelligence - ONI), and Gen. William J. Donovan (Director of  the Office of Strategic Services - OSS) decided that a joint effort  should be initiated. A steering committee was appointed on 27 April  1943 that recommended the formation of a Joint Intelligence Study  Publishing Board to assemble, edit, coordinate, and publish the Joint  Army Navy Intelligence Studies (JANIS). JANIS was the first  interdepartmental basic intelligence program and fulfilled the needs  of the US Government for an authoritative and coordinated digest of  strategic basic intelligence. Between April 1943 and July 1947, the  board published 34 JANIS studies. JANIS performed well in the war  effort, and numerous letters of commendation were received including a  statement from Adm. Forrest Sherman, Chief of Staff, Pacific Ocean  Areas, which said \"JANIS has become the indispensable reference work  for the shore-based planners.\"    The need for even more comprehensive basic intelligence in the postwar  world was well expressed in 1946 by George S. Pettee, a noted author  on national security, when he wrote in The Future of American Secret  Intelligence (Infantry Journal Press, 1946, page 46) that world  leadership in peace requires more elaborate intelligence than war.  \"The conduct of peace involves all countries, all human activities-not  just the enemy and his war production.\"    The Central Intelligence Agency was established on 26 July 1947 and  officially began operating 18 September 1947. Effective 1 October  1947, the Director of Central Intelligence assumed operational  responsibility for JANIS. On 13 January 1948, the National Security  Council issued Intelligence Directive (NSCID) No. 3, which officially  authorized the National Intelligence Survey (NIS) program as a  peacetime replacement for the wartime JANIS program. Before adequate  NIS sections could be produced, it was necessary to develop gazetteers  and maps for an accurate presentation of intelligence by the  contributing agencies. The US Board on Geographic Names (BGN) compiled  the names, the Department of the Interior produced the gazetteers, and  CIA produced the maps.

Turning her hand to the  nearest work, she went out by the day as house-cleaner and laundress.  Later, seeking to better herself, she accepted employment as a  housekeeper for a well-to-do Scotch cattle-man, Mr. Stewart, who had  taken up a quarter-section in Wyoming. The letters, written through  several years to a former employer in Denver, tell the story of her new  life in the new country.

CONEY,--    Are you thinking I am lost, like the Babes in the Wood? Well, I am not  and I'm sure the robins would have the time of their lives getting  leaves to cover me out here. I am 'way up close to the Forest Reserve  of Utah, within half a mile of the line, sixty miles from the railroad.  I was twenty-four hours on the train and two days on the stage, and oh,  those two days! The snow was just beginning to melt and the mud was  about the worst I ever heard of.    The first stage we tackled was just about as rickety as it could very  well be and I had to sit with the driver, who was a Mormon and so  handsome that I was not a bit offended when he insisted on making love  all the way, especially after he told me that he was a widower Mormon.  But, of course, as I had no chaperone I looked very fierce (not that  that was very difficult with the wind and mud as allies) and told him  my actual opinion of Mormons in general and particular.    Meantime my new employer, Mr. Stewart, sat upon a stack of baggage and  was dreadfully concerned about something he calls his \"Tookie,\" but I  am unable to tell you what that is. The road, being so muddy, was full  of ruts and the stage acted as if it had the hiccoughs and made us all  talk as though we were affected in the same way. Once Mr. Stewart asked  me if I did not think it a \"gey duir trip.\" I told him he could call it  gay if he wanted to, but it didn't seem very hilarious to me. Every  time the stage struck a rock or a rut Mr. Stewart would \"hoot,\" until  I began to wish we would come to a hollow tree or a hole in the ground  so he could go in with the rest of the owls.    At last we \"arriv,\" and everything is just lovely for me. I have a  very, very comfortable situation and Mr. Stewart is absolutely no  trouble, for as soon as he has his meals he retires to his room and  plays on his bagpipe, only he calls it his \"bugpeep.\" It is \"The  Campbells are Coming,\" without variations, at intervals all day long  and from seven till eleven at night. Sometimes I wish they would make  haste and get here.    There is a saddle horse especially for me and a little shotgun with  which I am to kill sage chickens. We are between two trout streams, so  you can think of me as being happy when the snow is through melting and  the water gets clear. We have the finest flock of Plymouth Rocks and  get so many nice eggs. It sure seems fine to have all the cream I want  after my town experiences. Jerrine is making good use of all the good  things we are having. She rides the pony to water every day.    I have not filed on my land yet because the snow is fifteen feet deep  on it, and I think I would rather see what I am getting, so will wait  until summer. They have just three seasons here, winter and July and  August. We are to plant our garden the last of May. When it is so I can  get around I will see about land and find out all I can and tell you.    I think this letter is about to reach thirty-secondly, so I will send  you my sincerest love and quit tiring you. Please write me when you  have time.      Sincerely yours,      ELINORE RUPERT.          II    FILING A CLAIM           _May 24, 1909._    DEAR, DEAR MRS. CONEY,--    Well, I have filed on my land and am now a bloated landowner. I waited  a long time to even _see_ land in the reserve, and the snow is yet too  deep, so I thought that as they have but three months of summer and  spring together and as I wanted the land for a ranch anyway, perhaps I  had better stay in the valley. So I have filed adjoining Mr. Stewart  and I am well pleased. I have a grove of twelve swamp pines on my  place, and I am going to build my house there. I thought it would be  very romantic to live on the peaks amid the whispering pines, but I  reckon it would be powerfully uncomfortable also, and I guess my twelve  can whisper enough for me; and a dandy thing is, I have all the nice  snow-water I want; a small stream runs right through the center of my  land and I am quite near wood.    A neighbor and his daughter were going to Green River, the county-seat,  and said I might go along, so I did, as I could file there as well as  at the land office; and oh, that trip! I had more fun to the square  inch than Mark Twain or Samantha Allen _ever_ provoked. It took us a  whole week to go and come. We camped out, of course, for in the whole  sixty miles there was but one house, and going in that direction there  is not a tree to be seen, nothing but sage, sand, and sheep. About noon  the first day out we came near a sheep-wagon, and stalking along ahead  of us was a lanky fellow, a herder, going home for dinner. Suddenly it  seemed to me I should starve if I had to wait until we got where we had  planned to stop for dinner, so I called out to the man, \"Little  Bo-Peep, have you anything to eat? If you have, we'd like to find it.\"  And he answered, \"As soon as I am able it shall be on the table, if  you'll but trouble to get behind it.\" Shades of Shakespeare! Songs of  David, the Shepherd Poet! What do you think of us? Well, we got behind  it, and a more delicious \"it\" I never tasted. Such coffee! And out of  _such_ a pot! I promised Bo-Peep that I would send him a crook with  pink ribbons on it, but I suspect he thinks I am a crook without the  ribbons.    The sagebrush is so short in some places that it is not large enough to  make a fire, so we had to drive until quite late before we camped that  night. After driving all day over what seemed a level desert of sand,  we came about sundown to a beautiful canon, down which we had to drive  for a couple of miles before we could cross. In the canon the shadows  had already fallen, but when we looked up we could see the last shafts  of sunlight on the tops of the great bare buttes. Suddenly a great wolf  started from somewhere and galloped along the edge of the canon,  outlined black and clear by the setting sun. His curiosity overcame him  at last, so he sat down and waited to see what manner of beast we  were. I reckon he was disappointed for he howled most dismally. I  thought of Jack London's \"The Wolf.\"    After we quitted the canon I saw the most beautiful sight. It seemed as  if we were driving through a golden haze. The violet shadows were  creeping up between the hills, while away back of us the snow-capped  peaks were catching the sun's last rays. On every side of us stretched  the poor, hopeless desert, the sage, grim and determined to live in  spite of starvation, and the great, bare, desolate buttes. The  beautiful colors turned to amber and rose, and then to the general  tone, dull gray. Then we stopped to camp, and such a scurrying around  to gather brush for the fire and to get supper! Everything tasted so  good! Jerrine ate like a man. Then we raised the wagon tongue and  spread the wagon sheet"]]]
