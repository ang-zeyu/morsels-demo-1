London Bombay Sydney          In Memoriam    _Gladys Nina Chalmers Werner_        Preface    The chief literary sources of Chinese myths are the _Li tai shen hsien  t'ung chien_, in thirty-two volumes, the _Shen hsien lieh chuan_,  in eight volumes, the _Feng shen yen i_, in eight volumes, and the  _Sou shen chi_, in ten volumes. In writing the following pages I  have translated or paraphrased largely from these works. I have also  consulted and at times quoted from the excellent volumes on Chinese  Superstitions by Pere Henri Dore, comprised in the valuable series  _Varietes Sinologiques_, published by the Catholic Mission Press  at Shanghai. The native works contained in the Ssu K'u Ch'uean Shu,  one of the few public libraries in Peking, have proved useful for  purposes of reference. My heartiest thanks are due to my good friend  Mr Mu Hsueeh-hsuen, a scholar of wide learning and generous disposition,  for having kindly allowed me to use his very large and useful library  of Chinese books. The late Dr G.E. Morrison also, until he sold it  to a Japanese baron, was good enough to let me consult his extensive  collection of foreign works relating to China whenever I wished, but  owing to the fact that so very little work has been done in Chinese  mythology by Western writers I found it better in dealing with this  subject to go direct to the original Chinese texts. I am indebted to  Professor H.A. Giles, and to his publishers, Messrs Kelly and Walsh,  Shanghai, for permission to reprint from _Strange Stories from a  Chinese Studio_ the fox legends given in Chapter XV.    This is, so far as I know, the only monograph on Chinese mythology  in any non-Chinese language. Nor do the native works include any  scientific analysis or philosophical treatment of their myths.    My aim, after summarizing the sociology of the Chinese as a  prerequisite to the understanding of their ideas and sentiments,  and dealing as fully as possible, consistently with limitations of  space (limitations which have necessitated the presentation of a  very large and intricate topic in a highly compressed form), with  the philosophy of the subject, has been to set forth in English dress  those myths which may be regarded as the accredited representatives  of Chinese mythology--those which live in the minds of the people and  are referred to most frequently in their literature, not those which  are merely diverting without being typical or instructive--in short,  a true, not a distorted image.    _Edward Theodore Chalmers Werner_    _Peking_  _February_ 1922        Contents        Chapter    I.

Et l'Orient est la ou sont  les sources debordantes de poesie._    _Mardrus_,  _La Reine de Saba_            CHAPTER I    The Sociology of the Chinese      Racial Origin    In spite of much research and conjecture, the origin of the Chinese  people remains undetermined. We do not know who they were nor whence  they came. Such evidence as there is points to their immigration  from elsewhere; the Chinese themselves have a tradition of a Western  origin. The first picture we have of their actual history shows us, not  a people behaving as if long settled in a land which was their home and  that of their forefathers, but an alien race fighting with wild beasts,  clearing dense forests, and driving back the aboriginal inhabitants.    Setting aside several theories (including the one that the Chinese  are autochthonous and their civilization indigenous) now regarded  by the best authorities as untenable, the researches of sinologists  seem to indicate an origin (1) in early Akkadia; or (2) in Khotan,  the Tarim valley (generally what is now known as Eastern Turkestan),  or the K'un-lun Mountains (concerning which more presently). The  second hypothesis may relate only to a sojourn of longer or shorter  duration on the way from Akkadia to the ultimate settlement in China,  especially since the Khotan civilization has been shown to have  been imported from the Punjab in the third century B.C. The fact  that serious mistakes have been made regarding the identifications  of early Chinese rulers with Babylonian kings, and of the Chinese  _po-hsing_ (Cantonese _bak-sing_) 'people' with the Bak Sing or Bak  tribes, does not exclude the possibility of an Akkadian origin. But  in either case the immigration into China was probably gradual, and  may have taken the route from Western or Central Asia direct to the  banks of the Yellow River, or may possibly have followed that to the  south-east through Burma and then to the north-east through what is  now China--the settlement of the latter country having thus spread  from south-west to north-east, or in a north-easterly direction along  the Yangtzu River, and so north, instead of, as is generally supposed,  from north to south.      Southern Origin Improbable    But this latter route would present many difficulties; it would seem  to have been put forward merely as ancillary to the theory that the  Chinese originated in the Indo-Chinese peninsula. This theory is  based upon the assumptions that the ancient Chinese ideograms include  representations of tropical animals and plants; that the oldest and  purest forms of the language are found in the south; and that the  Chinese and the Indo-Chinese groups of languages are both tonal. But  all of these facts or alleged facts are as easily or better accounted  for by the supposition that the Chinese arrived from the north  or north-west in successive waves of migration, the later arrivals  pushing the earlier farther and farther toward the south, so that the  oldest and purest forms of Chinese would be found just where they are,  the tonal languages of the Indo-Chinese peninsula being in that case  regarded as the languages of the vanguard of the migration. Also, the  ideograms referred to represent animals and plants of the temperate  zone rather than of the tropics, but even if it could be shown, which  it cannot, that these animals and plants now belong exclusively to the  tropics, that would be no proof of the tropical origin of the Chinese,  for in the earliest times the climate of North China was much milder  than it is now, and animals such as tigers and elephants existed in the  dense jungles which are later found only in more southern latitudes.      Expansion of Races from North to South    The theory of a southern origin (to which a further serious objection  will be stated presently) implies a gradual infiltration of Chinese  immigrants through South or Mid-China (as above indicated) toward  the north, but there is little doubt that the movement of the races  has been from north to south and not _vice versa_. In what are now  the provinces of Western Kansu and Ssuch'uan there lived a people  related to the Chinese (as proved by the study of Indo-Chinese  comparative philology) who moved into the present territory of Tibet  and are known as Tibetans; in what is now the province of Yuennan were  the Shan or Ai-lao (modern Laos), who, forced by Mongol invasions,  emigrated to the peninsula in the south and became the Siamese; and in  Indo-China, not related to the Chinese, were the Annamese, Khmer, Mon,  Khasi, Colarains (whose remnants are dispersed over the hill tracts  of Central India), and other tribes, extending in prehistoric times  into Southern China, but subsequently driven back by the expansion  of the Chinese in that direction.      Arrival of the Chinese in China    Taking into consideration all the existing evidence, the objections to  all other theories of the origin of the Chinese seem to be greater  than any yet raised to the theory that immigrants from the Tarim  valley or beyond (_i.e._ from Elam or Akkadia, either direct or _via_  Eastern Turkestan) struck the banks of the Yellow River in their  eastward journey and followed its course until they reached the  localities where we first find them settled, namely, in the region  covered by parts of the three modern provinces of Shansi, Shensi,  and Honan where their frontiers join. They were then (about 2500 or  3000 B.C.) in a relatively advanced state of civilization. The country  east and south of this district was inhabited by aboriginal tribes,  with whom the Chinese fought, as they did with the wild animals and the  dense vegetation, but with whom they also commingled and intermarried,  and among whom they planted colonies as centres from which to spread  their civilization.      The K'un-lun Mountains    With reference to the K'un-lun Mountains, designated in Chinese  mythology as the abode of the gods--the ancestors of the Chinese  race--it should be noted that these are identified not with the range  dividing Tibet from Chinese Turkestan, but with"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15255"],[0,"Hinduism and Buddhism, An Historical Sketch, Vol. 1 (#1)"],[1,"AND BUDDHISM  AN HISTORICAL SKETCH      BY SIR CHARLES ELIOT          In three volumes VOLUME I    ROUTLEDGE & KEGAN PAUL LTD Broadway House, 68-74 Carter Lane, London,  E.C.4.    _First published_ 1921 _Reprinted_ 1954 _Reprinted_ 1957 _Reprinted_  1962      PRINTED IN GREAT BRITAIN BY    LUND HUMPHRIES LONDON {~BULLET~} BRADFORD          PREFACE      The present work was begun in 1907 and was practically complete when the  war broke out, but many circumstances such as the difficulty of  returning home, unavoidable delays in printing and correcting proofs,  and political duties have deferred its publication until now. In the  interval many important books dealing with Hinduism and Buddhism have  appeared, but having been resident in the Far East (with one brief  exception) since 1912 I have found it exceedingly difficult to keep in  touch with recent literature. Much of it has reached me only in the last  few months and I have often been compelled to notice new facts and views  in footnotes only, though I should have wished to modify the text.    Besides living for some time in the Far East, I have paid many visits to  India, some of which were of considerable length, and have travelled in  all the countries of which I treat except Tibet. I have however seen  something of Lamaism near Darjeeling, in northern China and in Mongolia.  But though I have in several places described the beliefs and practices  prevalent at the present day, my object is to trace the history and  development of religion in India and elsewhere with occasional remarks  on its latest phases. I have not attempted to give a general account of  contemporary religious thought in India or China and still less to  forecast the possible result of present tendencies.    In the following pages I have occasion to transcribe words belonging to  many oriental languages in Latin characters. Unfortunately a uniform  system of transcription, applicable to all tongues, seems not to be  practical at present. It was attempted in the _Sacred Books of the  East_, but that system has fallen into disuse and is liable to be  misunderstood. It therefore seems best to use for each language the  method of transcription adopted by standard works in English dealing  with each, for French and German transcriptions, whatever their merits  may be as representations of the original sounds, are often misleading  to English readers, especially in Chinese. For Chinese I have adopted  Wade's system as used in Giles's _Dictionary_, for Tibetan the system of  Sarat Chandra Das, for Pali that of the Pali Text Society and for  Sanskrit that of Monier-Williams's _Sanskrit Dictionary,_ except that I  write s instead of s. Indian languages however offer many difficulties:  it is often hard to decide whether Sanskrit or vernacular forms are more  suitable and in dealing with Buddhist subjects whether Sanskrit or Pali  words should be used. I have found it convenient to vary the form of  proper names according as my remarks are based on Sanskrit or on Pali  literature, but this obliges me to write the same word differently in  different places, e.g. sometimes Ajatasatru and sometimes Ajatasattu,  just as in a book dealing with Greek and Latin mythology one might  employ both Herakles and Hercules. Also many Indian names such as  Ramayana, Krishna, nirvana have become Europeanized or at least are  familiar to all Europeans interested in Indian literature. It seems  pedantic to write them with their full and accurate complement of  accents and dots and my general practice is to give such words in their  accurate spelling (Ramayana, etc.) when they are first mentioned and  also in the notes but usually to print them in their simpler and  unaccented forms. I fear however that my practice in this matter is not  entirely consistent since different parts of the book were written at  different times.    My best thanks are due to Mr R.F. Johnston (author of _Chinese  Buddhism_), to Professor W.J. Hinton of the University of Hong Kong and  to Mr H.I. Harding of H.M. Legation at Peking for reading the proofs and  correcting many errors: to Sir E. Denison Ross and Professor L. Finot  for valuable information: and especially to Professor and Mrs Rhys  Davids for much advice, though they are in no way responsible for the  views which I have expressed and perhaps do not agree with them. It is  superfluous for me to pay a tribute to these eminent scholars whose  works are well known to all who are interested in Indian religion, but  no one who has studied the early history of Buddhism or the Pali  language can refrain from acknowledging a debt of gratitude to those who  have made such researches possible by founding and maintaining during  nearly forty years the Pali Text Society and rendering many of the texts  still more accessible to Europe by their explanations and translations.

MYTHOLOGY IN HINDUISM AND BUDDHISM          INTRODUCTION    1. _Influence of Indian Thought in Eastern Asia_      Probably the first thought which will occur to the reader who is  acquainted with the matters treated in this work will be that the  subject is too large. A history of Hinduism or Buddhism or even of both  within the frontiers of India may be a profitable though arduous task,  but to attempt a historical sketch of the two faiths in their whole  duration and extension over Eastern Asia is to choose a scene unsuited  to any canvas which can be prepared at the present day. Not only is the  breadth of the landscape enormous but in some places it is crowded with  details which cannot be omitted while in others the principal features  are hidden by a mist which obscures the unity and connection of the  whole composition. No one can feel these difficulties more than I do  myself or approach his work with more diffidence, yet I venture to think  that wide surveys may sometimes be useful and are needed in the present  state of oriental studies. For the reality of Indian influence in  Asia--from Japan to the frontiers of Persia, from Manchuria to Java, from  Burma to Mongolia--is undoubted and the influence is one. You cannot  separate Hinduism from Buddhism, for without it Hinduism could not have  assumed its medieval shape and some forms of Buddhism, such as Lamaism,  countenance Brahmanic deities and ceremonies, while in Java and Camboja  the two religions were avowedly combined and declared to be the same.  Neither is it convenient to separate the fortunes of Buddhism and  Hinduism outside India from their history within it, for although the  importance of Buddhism depends largely on its foreign conquests, the  forms which it assumed in its new territories can be understood only by  reference to the religious condition of India at the periods when  successive missions were despatched.    This book then is an attempt to give a sketch of Indian thought or  Indian religion--for the two terms are nearly equivalent in extent--and of  its history and influence in Asia. I will not say in the world, for that  sounds too ambitious and really adds little to the more restricted  phrase. For ideas, like empires and races, have their natural frontiers.  Thus Europe may be said to be non-Mohammedan. Although the essential  principles of Mohammedanism seem in harmony with European monotheism,  yet it has been deliberately rejected by the continent and often  repelled by force. Similarly in the regions west of India[1], Indian  religion is sporadic and exotic. I do not think that it had much  influence on ancient Egypt, Babylon and Palestine or that it should be  counted among the forces which shaped the character and teaching of  Christ, though Christian monasticism and mysticism perhaps owed  something to it. The debt of Manichaeism and various Gnostic sects is  more certain and more considerable, but these communities have not  endured and were regarded as heretical while they lasted.
