GREAT PICTURES    As Seen and Described by Famous Writers    Edited and Translated by    ESTHER SINGLETON    Author of \"Turrets, Towers, and Temples\" and  Translator of \"The Music Dramas of Richard Wagner\"    With Numerous Illustrations                [Illustration: FISHERMAN PRESENTING THE RING TO THE DOGE GRADENIGO.          _Bordone._]            New York  Dodd, Mead and Company  Copyright, 1899  By Dodd, Mead and Company            Preface      The cordial reception of \"Turrets, Towers, and Temples\" has encouraged  me to hope that a welcome may be given to a book treating the  masterpieces of painting in a similar manner.    Great writers and literary tourists have occasionally been inspired to  record the impressions of their saunterings among galleries and museums.  The most interesting of these, not necessarily professional, I have  tried to bring together in the following pages. My object has been not  to make a selection of the greatest pictures in the world, although many  that have that reputation will be found here, but rather to bring  together those that have produced a powerful impression on great minds.  Consequently, when the reader is disturbed at the omission of some  world-famous painting, I beg him to remember my plan and blame the great  writers instead of me for neglecting his favourite.    My task has not been a light one. A few words of rapturous admiration  are constantly to be met with in the pages of art-lovers, but a  sympathetic study of a single work is rarely found. General comment of a  given artist's work is also plentiful, while discriminating praise of  individual canvases is scanty. The literary selection has, therefore,  involved a great deal of research.    From time to time the relative popularity of painters shifts strangely,  but no matter what inconstant fashion may dictate, or what may be the  cult of the hour, certain paintings never lose their prestige, but  annually attract as many pilgrims as Lourdes or Fusi-San.    Of modern painters I have only included Turner and Rossetti.    It is interesting to compare the example I have chosen from Rossetti  with Leonardo's \"Monna Lisa.\" Pater has admirably brought out, without  dwelling too much upon it, the charm that is eternal in her face as well  as the fantastic imagination of the great artist who created her for all  time. He says: \"The fancy of a perpetual life, sweeping together ten  thousand experiences, is an old one.... Certainly Lady Lisa might stand  as the embodiment of the _old_ fancy, the symbol of the _modern_ idea.\"  In a similar sense Lilith the siren, the Lorelei, the eternal  enchantress, in her modern robe, is the embodiment of a _new_ fancy, the  symbol of the _ancient_ idea; and just here across four centuries the  thoughts of two great artists meet.    The types of beauty and women in this book offer no little suggestion to  the fancy. From Botticelli's \"La Bella Simonetta,\" and Raphael's \"La  Fornarina,\" through all the periods of painting the model has been a  great influence upon the painter's work, and upon this point nearly  every essayist and critic represented in these pages dwells. In many of  the essays, such as Pater's on Botticelli, and Swinburne's on Andrea del  Sarto, the author strays away from the painting to talk of the painter,  but in doing this he gives us so thoroughly the spirit of that painter  that a fuller light is thrown upon the picture before us.    I have included a few criticisms by modern French critics, MM.  Valabregue, Lafond, Giron, Guiffrey, and Reymond, recognized authorities  upon the artists whose works they describe; and I have selected  Fromentin's valuable essay on \"The Night Watch,\" feeling sure that this  thoughtful criticism would interest even the enthusiastic admirers of  this enigmatical work.    I have been careful to take no unnecessary liberties with the text. In  the translations from Gruyer, Goethe, Fromentin, and others, which were  unfortunately too long to be included entire, I have not allowed myself  to condense, but only to cut. This is true, also, of the English  extracts.      E.S.    NEW YORK, _September_, 1899.
