Other times you are supposed to  read the text and then the headings. It really does not matter much as  long as you read them both. Be sure to do that. They are clever. _I  wrote them myself_.    I have been accused of trying to catch you coming and going, because I  have included in my book the right methods of gaining weight, as well as  those for losing weight. But this is not the reason--though I don't  object to doing that little thing--the reason is that the lack of  knowledge of foods is the foundation for both overweight and  underweight.    I did want my publishers to get this out in a cheaper edition, thinking  that more people could have it, and thus it would be doing more good;  but they have convinced me that that idea was a false claim of my mortal  mind, and that the more you paid for it, the more you would appreciate  it. I have received many times, and without grumbling on my part, ten  dollars for the same advice given in my office. Perhaps on this line of  reasoning we should have ten dollars for the book. Those of you who  think so may send the balance on through my publishers.    L.H.P.

It will not interest you in the least. I will come to  you later. I am not particularly interested in you anyway, for I cannot  get your point of view. How any one can want to be anything but thin is  beyond my intelligence. However, knowing that there are such deluded  individuals, I have been constrained to give you advice. You won't find  it spontaneous nor from the heart, but if you follow my directions I  will guarantee that you will gain; providing, of course, you have no  organic trouble; and the chances are that by giving proper attention to  your diet you will gain anyway, and maybe in passing lose your trouble.  Who knows?    [Sidenote: _Bad Business_]    In war time it is a crime to hoard food, and fines and imprisonment have  followed the expose of such practices. Yet there are hundreds of  thousands of individuals all over America who are hoarding food, and  that one of the most precious of all foods! _They have vast amounts of  this valuable commodity stored away in their own anatomy_.    [Illustration: contents noted]    Now fat individuals have always been considered a joke, but you are a  joke no longer. Instead of being looked upon with friendly tolerance and  amusement, you are now viewed with distrust, suspicion, and even  aversion! How dare you hoard fat when our nation needs it? You don't  dare to any longer. You never wanted to be fat anyway, but you did not  know how to reduce, and it is proverbial how little you eat. Why, there  is Mrs. Natty B. Slymm, who is beautifully thin, and she eats twice as  much as you do, and does not gain an ounce. You know positively that  eating has nothing to do with it, for one time you dieted, didn't eat a  thing but what the doctor ordered, besides your regular meals, and you  actually gained.    You are in despair about being anything but fat, and--! how you hate it.  But cheer up. I will save you; yea, even as I have saved myself and  many, many others, so will I save you.    [Sidenote: _Spirituality vs. Materiality_]    [Sidenote: _A Long, Long Battle_]    It is not in vain that all my life I have had to fight the too, too  solid. Why, I can remember when I was a child I was always being  consoled by being told that I would outgrow it, and that when I matured  I would have some shape. Never can I tell pathetically \"when I was  married I weighed only one hundred eighteen, and look at me now.\" No, I  was a delicate slip of one hundred and sixty-five when I was taken.    I never will tell you how much I have weighed, I am so thoroughly  ashamed of it, but my normal weight is one hundred and fifty pounds, and  at one time there was seventy pounds more of me than there is now, or  has been since I knew how to control it. I was not so shameless as that  very long, and as I look back upon that short period I feel like  refunding the comfortable salary received as superintendent of an  hospital; for I know I was only sixty-five per cent efficient, for  efficiency decreases in direct proportion as excess weight increases.  Everybody knows it.      _The Meeting Is Now Open for Discussion_    Jolly Mrs. Sheesasite has the floor and wants some questions answered.  You know Mrs. Sheesasite; her husband recently bought her a pair of  freight scales.    [Sidenote: _Mrs. Sheesasite_]    \"Why is it, Doctor, that thin people can eat so much more than fat  people and still not gain?\"    [Sidenote: _Me Answering_]    \"First: Thin people are usually more active than fat people and use up  their food.    \"Second: Thin people have been proved to radiate fifty per cent more  heat per pound than fat people; in other words, fat people are regular  fireless cookers! They hold the heat in, it cannot get out through the  packing, and the food which is also contained therein goes merrily on  with fiendish regularity, depositing itself as fat.    [Illustration: Fireless Cookers.]    \"And there are baby fireless cookers and children fireless cookers. The  same dietetic rules apply to them as to the adult.\"    \"I recognize Mrs. Tiny Weyaton; then you, Mrs. Knott Little.\"    [Sidenote: _Mrs. Weyaton_]    \"We have heard you say that fat people eat too much, and still we eat so  little?\"    [Sidenote: _Me Again_]    \"Yes, you eat too much, _no matter how little it is_, even if it be only  one bird-seed daily, _if you store it away as fat_. For, hearken; food,  and food only (sometimes plus alcohol) maketh fat. Not water--not  air--verily, nothing but food maketh fat. (And between you and me, Mrs.  Weyaton, just confidential like--don't tell it--we know that the small  appetite story is a myth.)\"    [Sidenote: _Mrs. Knott Little_]    \"But, Doctor, is it not true that some individuals inherit the tendency  to be fat, and can not help it, no matter what they do?\"    [Sidenote: _Doctor_]    \"Answer to first part--Yes.    \"Answer to second part--No! It is not true that they cannot help it;  they have to work a little harder, that is all. It is true that being  fat is a disease with some, due to imperfect working of the internal  secretory glands, such as the thyroid, generative glands, etc.; but that  is not true fat such as you have. Yours, and that of the other members  who are interested, is due to overeating and underexercising.    [Sidenote: _Not_?]    \"Those diseased individuals should be under the care of a physician.  Probably the secretory glands are somewhat inactive or sluggish in the  healthy fat individual. I use the word _healthy_ here in  contradistinction to the other type. In reality, individuals very much  overweight are not really healthy, and they should also visit their  physician.\"    \"Yes, Mrs. Ima Gobbler?\"    [Sidenote: _Mrs. Ima Gobbler_]    [Sidenote: _Doctor Dear_]    \"But, Doctor dear, what's the use of dieting? I only get fatter after I  stop.\"    (Answering delicate like, for I'm fond of her and she is sensitive):    \"You fat--! You make me fatigued! _You never diet long enough_ to get  out of the fireless cooker class. _If you did, you wouldn't.\"_    \"Is there anyone else who would like to be recognized? No?\"    [Sidenote: _Nothing That I Don't Know_]    It is well. I will probably answer more as I go along, for there is  nothing that I don't know or haven't studied or tried in the reducing  line. I know everything you have to contend with--how you no sooner  congratulate yourself on your will power, after you have dragged  yourself by the window with an exposure of luscious fat chocolates with  curlicues on their tummies, than another comes into view, and you have  it all to go through with again, and how you finally succumb.    I hope sometime it will be a misdemeanor, punishable by imprisonment, to  display candy as shamelessly as it is done.    Many fond parents think that candy causes worms. It doesn't, of course,  unless it is contaminated with worm eggs, but, personally, I wish every  time I ate a chocolate I would get a worm, then I would escape them. The  chocolates, I mean. I will tell you more about worms when I discuss  meat.

The Principal Doorway to the Cathedral at Trani, Italy.]          THE BROCHURE SERIES    OF ARCHITECTURAL ILLUSTRATION.    VOL. I. FEBRUARY, 1895. No. 2.           *       *       *       *       *    BYZANTINE-ROMANESQUE DOORWAYS IN SOUTHERN ITALY.      The illustrations chosen for this issue are all from the Byzantine  Romanesque work in the province of Apulia, that portion of Southern  Italy familiar in school-boy memory as the heel of the boot. Writers  upon architecture have found it difficult to strictly classify the  buildings of this neighborhood, as in fact is the case with most of the  medieval architecture of Italy, although the influences which have  brought about the conditions here seen are in the main plainly evident.  The traditions and surroundings, of Roman origin, were modified by trade  and association with the Levant through the commerce of Venice and Pisa,  resulting in a style embodying many of the characteristics of both the  Romans and the builders of Byzantium. Oftentimes these characteristics  are so blended and modified by one another as to be entirely  indistinguishable, while at other times features unquestionably  belonging to the Romanesque or the Byzantine will be found side by side.  An illustration of the latter condition may be seen in the two views of  the doorway to the cathedral of Trani. (Plates IX. and X.) On account of  the intimate relations maintained during the Middle Ages between this  province and Magna Grecia, and it may be partly on account of the  comparative remoteness from the principal cities of the north, the  Byzantine influence is here more strongly marked than in the cities of  Central and Northern Italy.    According to the classification adopted by Fergusson, the church of San  Miniato at Florence is one of the oldest examples and a good type of  this rather mixed style. It was built about the year 1013. It is  rectangular in plan, nearly three times as long as wide, with a  semicircular apse. Internally it is divided longitudinally into aisles,  and transversely into three nearly square compartments by clustered  piers, supporting two great arches which run up to the roof. The whole  of the inner compartment is occupied by a crypt or under church open to  the nave, above which is the choir and altar niche, approached by  flights of steps in the aisles. This general arrangement is followed  more or less closely in the churches at Bittonto, Bari, Altamura, Ruvo,  Galatina, Brindisi, and Barletta. The scale of the southern churches is,  however, much smaller than those of the north, the width of the nave of  the cathedral at Trani being only 50 feet, and the length 167 feet,  while the corresponding dimensions of the cathedral at Pisa, which is  referred to by Fergusson as the most notable example of this style in  the north, are 106 x 310 feet.    In these smaller churches, as far as external treatment is concerned,  the main attention is devoted to the principal facade, and here most of  the ornament is usually covered with a rich hood supported by pillars  resting on monsters, following the custom prevalent throughout Italy  during this period. Above this is either a gallery or one or two  windows, and the whole generally terminates in a circular rose window  filled with tracery.    [Illustration: X. The Principal Doorway to the Catherdral at Trani, Italy.]    Fergusson's final summing up of the architecture of this neighborhood  can scarcely be considered too enthusiastic in the light of the eight  illustrations here given. He says: \"No one who takes the pains to  familiarize himself with the architecture of these Southern Italian  churches can well fail to be impressed with their beauty. That beauty  will be found, however, to arise not so much from the dimensions or  arrangement of their plans, or the form of their outline, as from the  grace and elegance of their details. Every feature displays the feeling  of an elegant and refined people, who demanded decoration as a  necessity, though they were incapable of rising to any great  architectural conception. They excelled as ornamentists, though at best  only indifferent architects.\"    The examples of doorways chosen for illustrating this number  unquestionably show the work of men who labored for the enjoyment and  satisfaction to be got from their work. This is sufficiently evident in  the results before us. Its logical and constructive bearing can of  course be called in question, as in fact is the case with all but the  merest fraction of the architectural efforts of the world. As decoration  we can but admire the masterly way in which the ornament is distributed,  the refined sense of scale and proportion, and the skilful and subtle  treatment of light and shade, even if the detail of the ornament itself  is crude and archaic.    In making the choice of these subjects this point was kept in mind, and  they are not offered as material which can be cut out in portions of the  size and shape desired and transferred bodily by the designer to  embellish a modern masterpiece, in the manner in which the Gothic  architects of Venice used their patterns of window tracery. These plates  show certain qualities in decorative design in their fullest and best  development, and are on this account invaluable as suggestions to  designers of the present day. For \"cribbing material\" they do not stand  for much; but this should not be counted as against their usefulness,  for the draughtsman who has not advanced beyond the \"cribbing\" stage has  much still to learn before he can do the best and most satisfactory  work.      IX. and X.    PRINCIPAL DOORWAY TO THE CATHEDRAL AT TRANI, ITALY.    The cathedral at Trani dates from about the middle of the twelfth  century. Its main features have been indicated above in describing the  general characteristics of the class of churches to which it belongs.  The bronze doors shown in the illustration were made in 1160, and are  exceptionally fine examples of the work of this period.      XI.    PRINCIPAL DOORWAY TO THE CATHEDRAL AT CONVERSANO, ITALY.    Doorways of this general design are so familiar in the so-called  Romanesque architecture of our American cities that it seems almost like  an old friend; but we regret to say that most of our American designs  would hardly show to advantage if compared side by side with this.      XII.    PORTION OF THE FACADE OF THE BASILICA AT ALTAMURA, ITALY.    The remarkable sense of spotting and distribution of ornament shown in  the designing of this facade can hardly be too much commended. The  strong light and long slanting shadows of the photograph are well  calculated to emphasize this quality in the design, and we can readily  find justification here for the estimate of Fergusson quoted above.

The Principal Doorway to the Cathedral at Conversano,  Italy.]          #Advice to Young Architects.#      Prof. Aitchison's Royal Academy Lectures upon Architecture should be  read by all students who can obtain access to them, and this is not  really very difficult to accomplish, as they are always reported at  length in the English architectural periodicals, and then usually  reprinted without credit by one or more of the American papers. The  latest one, reported in the _Builder_ of Feb. 16, is that delivered on  Feb. 4, under the general title \"The Advancement of Architecture.\" It  deals in a common-sense fashion with the aesthetics of architecture, and  contains many valuable suggestions upon the study and practice of  architecture as an art. The three following quotations are well worth  attentive reading:--    \"Swift, in his 'Letters to a Young Clergyman,' says: 'I cannot forbear  warning you in the most earnest manner against endeavoring at wit in  your sermons, because, by the strictest computation, it is very near a  million to one that you have none.' Perhaps that would be good advice to  all who consciously seek for what is called originality, which is mostly  attained by exaggeration, disproportion, and oddness of arrangement;  real originality only comes from original minds, and will in that case  show itself properly and naturally, just as wit shows itself  spontaneously in the witty; for surely those original architects, who  have only been able to raise in us emotions of contempt or disgust,  would have been judicious had they abstained from the attempt. I think  that most architectural students, if they will only study the best  buildings, will make their plans to accurately answer the purposes  wanted, including the efficient lighting of the rooms, will study the  Vitruvian symmetry until their eye revolts from disproportion, will try  and make their profiles tell the story they want told, and will try and  bring such parts that, from the exigencies of the case, obtrude  themselves in odd places into harmony with the whole, that they will  produce an effect which will raise their buildings to the dignity of  humanity, and out of the range of the dog-kennel and rabbit-hutch type,  and will not exhibit ugliness, disproportion, or vulgarity. We see  plenty of examples where the designs have sunk much below this level; no  building of dead walls, with holes in it for doors and windows, could  cause us such disgust. Let me here say, by way of a parenthesis, that  if you candidly consider that your design is more offensive than a dead  wall, do not waste money and materials in making the wall more  repulsive, but let it alone.\"    \"Any one can be original if he be only impudent enough; any one can be  graceful if he is servile enough to copy: but to be both original and  graceful requires deep study, much striving, and natural talent.\"    \"I have also to remind"]]]
