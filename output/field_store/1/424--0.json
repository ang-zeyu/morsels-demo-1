It is becoming an axiom in anthropology that what is needed is not  discursive treatment of large subjects but the minute discussion of  special themes, not a ranging at large over the peoples of the earth  past and present, but a detailed examination of limited areas. This work  I am undertaking for Australia, and in the present volume I deal briefly  with some of the aspects of Australian kinship organisations, in the  hope that a survey of our present knowledge may stimulate further  research on the spot and help to throw more light on many difficult  problems of primitive sociology.    We have still much to learn of the relations of the central tribes and  their organisations to the less elaborately studied Anula and Mara. I  have therefore passed over the questions discussed by Dr Durkheim. We  have still more to learn as to the descent of the totem, the relation of  totem-kin, class and phratry, and the like; totemism is therefore  treated only incidentally in the present work, and lack of knowledge  compels me to pass over many other interesting questions.    The present volume owes much to Mr Andrew Lang. He has read twice over  both my typescript MS, and my proofs; in the detection of ambiguities  and the removal of obscurities he has rendered my readers a greater  service than any bald statement will convey; for his aid in the matter  of terminology, for his criticisms of ideas already put forward and for  his many pregnant suggestions, but inadequately worked out in the  present volume. I am under the deepest obligations to him; and no mere  formal expression of thanks will meet the case. I have been more than  fortunate in securing aid from Mr Lang in a subject which he has made  his own.    I do not for a moment suppose that the information here collected is  exhaustive. If any one should be in a position to supplement or correct  my facts or to enlighten me in any way as to the ideas and customs of  the blacks I shall be obliged if he will tell me all he knows about them  and their ways.

PUTNAM'S SONS  (For revised edition)      Made in the United States of America          PREFACE TO THIRD EDITION      Years have passed since the second edition of this book. But as most of  this time has been taken up with the writing of my \"Drawings of the  Florentine Painters,\" it has, in a sense, been spent in preparing me to  make this new edition. Indeed, it is to that bigger work that I must  refer the student who may wish to have the reasons for some of my  attributions. There, for instance, he will find the intricate Carli  question treated quite as fully as it deserves. Jacopo del Sellajo is  inserted here for the first time. Ample accounts of this frequently  entertaining tenth-rate painter may be found in articles by Hans  Makowsky, Mary Logan, and Herbert Horne.    The most important event of the last ten years, in the study of Italian  art, has been the rediscovery of an all but forgotten great master,  Pietro Cavallini. The study of his fresco at S. Cecilia in Rome, and of  the other works that readily group themselves with it, has illuminated  with an unhoped-for light the problem of Giotto's origin and  development. I felt stimulated to a fresh consideration of the subject.  The results will be noted here in the inclusion, for the first time, of  Cimabue, and in the lists of paintings ascribed to Giotto and his  immediate assistants.    B. B.    _Boston, November, 1908._          PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION      The lists have been thoroughly revised, and some of them considerably  increased. Botticini, Pier Francesco Fiorentino, and Amico di Sandro  have been added, partly for the intrinsic value of their work, and  partly because so many of their pictures are exposed to public  admiration under greater names. Botticini sounds too much like  Botticelli not to have been confounded with him, and Pier Francesco has  similarly been confused with Piero della Francesca. Thus, Botticini's  famous \"Assumption,\" painted for Matteo Palmieri, and now in the  National Gallery, already passed in Vasari's time for a Botticelli, and  the attribution at Karlsruhe of the quaint and winning \"Nativity\" to the  sublime, unyielding Piero della Francesca is surely nothing more than  the echo of the real author's name.    Most inadequate accounts, yet more than can be given here, of Pier  Francesco, as well as of Botticini, will be found in the Italian edition  of Cavalcaselle's _Storia della Pittura in Italia_, Vol. VII. The latter  painter will doubtless be dealt with fully and ably in Mr. Herbert P.  Horne's forthcoming book on Botticelli, and in this connection I am  happy to acknowledge my indebtedness to Mr. Horne for having persuaded  me to study Botticini. Of Amico di Sandro I have written at length in  the _Gazette des Beaux Arts_, June and July, 1899.    FIESOLE, November, 1899.

Florentine painting between Giotto and Michelangelo contains the names  of such artists as Orcagna, Masaccio, Fra Filippo, Pollaiuolo,  Verrocchio, Leonardo, and Botticelli. Put beside these the greatest  names in Venetian art, the Vivarini, the Bellini, Giorgione, Titian, and  Tintoret. The difference is striking. The significance of the Venetian  names is exhausted with their significance as painters. Not so with the  Florentines. Forget that they were painters, they remain great  sculptors; forget that they were sculptors, and still they remain  architects, poets, and even men of science. They left no form of  expression untried, and to none could they say, \"This will perfectly  convey my meaning.\" Painting, therefore, offers but a partial and not  always the most adequate manifestation of their personality, and we feel  the artist as greater than his work, and the man as soaring above the  artist.    [Page heading: MANYSIDEDNESS OF THE PAINTERS]    The immense superiority of the artist even to his greatest achievement  in any one art form, means that his personality was but slightly  determined by the particular art in question, that he tended to mould it  rather than let it shape him. It would be absurd, therefore, to treat  the Florentine painter as a mere link between two points in a necessary  evolution. The history of the art of Florence never can be, as that of  Venice, the study of a placid development. Each man of genius brought to  bear upon his art a great intellect, which, never condescending merely  to please, was tirelessly striving to reincarnate what it comprehended  of life in forms that would fitly convey it to others; and in this  endeavour each man of genius was necessarily compelled to create forms  essentially his own. But because Florentine painting was pre-eminently  an art formed by great personalities, it grappled with problems of the  highest interest, and offered solutions that can never lose their  value. What they aimed at, and what they attained, is the subject of the  following essay.      II.    The first of the great personalities in Florentine painting was Giotto.  Although he affords no exception to the rule that the great Florentines  exploited all the arts in the endeavour to express themselves, he,  Giotto, renowned as architect and sculptor, reputed as wit and  versifier, differed from most of his Tuscan successors in having  peculiar aptitude for the essential in painting _as an art_.    But before we can appreciate his real value, we must come to an  agreement as to what in the art of figure-painting--the craft has its  own altogether diverse laws--_is_ the essential; for figure-painting, we  may say at once, was not only the one pre-occupation of Giotto, but the  dominant interest of the entire Florentine school.    [Page heading: IMAGINATION OF TOUCH]    Psychology has ascertained that sight alone gives us no accurate sense  of the third dimension. In our infancy, long before we are conscious of  the process, the sense of touch, helped on by muscular sensations of  movement, teaches us to appreciate depth, the third dimension, both in  objects and in space.    In the same unconscious years we learn to make of touch, of the third  dimension, the test of reality. The child is still dimly aware of the  intimate connection between touch and the third dimension. He cannot  persuade himself of the unreality of Looking-Glass Land until he has  touched the back of the mirror. Later, we entirely forget the  connection, although it remains true, that every time our eyes recognise  reality, we are, as a matter of fact, giving tactile values to retinal  impressions.    Now, painting is an art which aims at giving an abiding impression of  artistic reality with only two dimensions. The painter must, therefore,  do consciously what we all do unconsciously,--construct his third  dimension. And he can accomplish his task only as we accomplish ours, by  giving tactile values to retinal impressions. His first business,  therefore, is to rouse the tactile sense, for I must have the illusion  of being able to touch a figure, I must have the illusion of varying  muscular sensations inside my palm and fingers corresponding to the  various projections of this figure, before I shall take it for granted  as real, and let it affect me lastingly.    It follows that the essential in the art of painting--as distinguished  from the art of colouring, I beg the reader to observe--is somehow to  stimulate our consciousness of tactile values, so that the picture shall  have at least as much power as the object represented, to appeal to our  tactile imagination.    [Page heading: GIOTTO]    Well, it was of the power to stimulate the tactile consciousness--of the  essential, as I have ventured to call it, in the art of painting--that  Giotto was supreme master. This is his everlasting claim to greatness,  and it is this which will make him a source of highest aesthetic delight  for a period at least as long as decipherable traces of his handiwork  remain on mouldering panel or crumbling wall. For great though he was as  a poet, enthralling as a story-teller, splendid and majestic as a  composer, he was in these qualities superior in degree only, to many of  the masters who painted in various parts of Europe during the thousand  years that intervened between the decline of antique, and the birth, in  his own person, of modern painting. But none of these masters had the  power to stimulate the tactile imagination, and, consequently, they  never painted a figure which has artistic existence. Their works have  value, if at all, as highly elaborate, very intelligible symbols,  capable, indeed, of communicating something, but losing all higher value  the moment the message is delivered.    Giotto's paintings, on the contrary, have not only as much power of  appealing to the tactile imagination as is possessed by the objects  represented--human figures in particular--but actually more, with the  necessary result that to his contemporaries they conveyed a _keener_  sense of reality, of life-likeness than the objects themselves!
