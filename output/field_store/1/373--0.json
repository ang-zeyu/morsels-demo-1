EP 118        Preface (3)    In the SIXTH READER, the general plan of the revision of McGUFFEY'S SERIES  has been carefully carried out to completion.    That plan has been to retain, throughout, those characteristic features of  McGUFFEY'S READERS, which have made the series so popular, and caused  their widespread use throughout the schools of the country. At the same  time, the books have been enlarged; old pieces have been exchanged for new  wherever the advantage was manifest; and several new features have been  incorporated, which it is thought will add largely to the value of the  series.    In the revision of the SIXTH READER, the introductory matter has been  retained with but little change, and it will he found very valuable for  elocutionary drill. In the preparation of this portion of the work, free  use was made of the writings of standard authors upon Elocution, such as  Walker, McCulloch, Sheridan Knowles, Ewing, Pinnock, Scott, Bell, Graham,  Mylins, Wood, Rush, and many others.    In making up the Selections for Reading, great care and deliberation have  been exercised. The best pieces of the old book are retained in the  REVISED SIXTH, and to the these been added a long list of selections from  the best English and American literature. Upwards of one hundred leading  authors are represented (see \"Alphabetical List. of Authors,\" page ix),  and thus a wide range of specimens of the best style has been secured.  Close scrutiny revealed the fact that many popular selections common to  several series of Readers, had been largely adapted, but in McGUFFEY'S  REVISED READERS, wherever it was possible to do so, the selections have  been compared, and made to conform strictly with the originals as they  appear in the latest editions authorized by the several writers.    The character of the selections, aside from their elocutionary value, has  also been duly considered. It will be found, upon examination, that they  present the same instructive merit and healthful moral tone which gave the  preceding edition its high reputation.    Two new features of the REVISED SIXTH deserve especial attention--the  explanatory notes, and the biographical notices of authors. The first, in  the absence of a large number of books of reference, are absolutely  necessary, in some cases, for the intelligent reading of the piece; and it  is believed that in all cases they will add largely to the interest and  usefulness of the lessons.    The biographical notices, if properly used, are hardly of less value than  the lessons themselves. They have been carefully prepared, and are  intended not only to add to the interest of the pieces, but to supply  information usually obtained only by the separate study of English and  American literature.    The illustrations of the REVISED SIXTH READER are presented as specimens  of fine art. They are the work of the best artists and engravers that  could be secured for the purpose in this country. The names of these  gentlemen may be found on page ten.    The publishers would here repeat their acknowledgments to the numerous  friends and critics who have kindly assisted in the work of revision, and  would mention particularly President EDWIN C. HEWETT, of the State Normal  University, Normal, Illinois, and the HON. THOMAS W. HARVEY, of  Painesville, Ohio, who have had the revision of the SIXTH READER under  their direct advice.    Especial acknowledgment is due to Messrs. Houghton, Osgood & Co., for  their permission to make liberal selections from their copyright editions  of many of the foremost American authors whose works they publish.  January, 1880.

PREFACE.      The object which the Author and Publisher of this little work have  proposed to themselves, has been the production, at a moderate price, of  a useful and reliable guide to the amateur telescopist.    Among the celestial phenomena described or figured in this treatise, by  far the larger number may be profitably examined with small telescopes,  and there are none which are beyond the range of a good 3-inch  achromatic.    The work also treats of the construction of telescopes, the nature and  use of star-maps, and other subjects connected with the requirements of  amateur observers.    R.A.P.    _January_, 1868.          CONTENTS.      CHAPTER I.                                          PAGE  A HALF-HOUR ON THE STRUCTURE OF THE TELESCOPE          1    CHAPTER II.

PLATE I.--_Frontispiece._    This plate presents the aspect of the heavens at the four seasons, dealt  with in Chapters II., III., IV., and V. In each map of this plate the  central point represents the point vertically over the observer's head,  and the circumference represents his horizon. The plan of each map is  such that the direction of a star or constellation, as respects the  compass-points, and its elevation, also, above the horizon, at the given  season, can be at once determined. Two illustrations of the use of the  maps will serve to explain their nature better than any detailed  description. Suppose first, that--at one of the hours named under Map  I.--the observer wishes to find Castor and Pollux:--Turning to Map I. he  sees that these stars lie in the lower left-hand quadrant, and very  nearly towards the point marked S.E.; that is, they are to be looked for  on the sky towards the south-east. Also, it is seen that the two stars  lie about one-fourth of the way from the centre towards the  circumference. Hence, on the sky, the stars will be found about  one-fourth of the way from the zenith towards the horizon: Castor will  be seen immediately above Pollux. Next, suppose that at one of the hours  named the observer wishes to learn what stars are visible towards the  west and north-west:--Turning the map until the portion of the  circumference marked W ... N.W. is lowermost, he sees that in the  direction named the square of Pegasus lies not very high above the  horizon, one diagonal of the square being vertical, the other nearly  horizontal. Above the square is Andromeda, to the right of which lies  Cassiopeia, the stars [beta] and [epsilon] of this constellation lying  directly towards the north-west, while the star [alpha] lies almost  exactly midway between the zenith and the horizon. Above Andromeda, a  little towards the left, lies Perseus, Algol being almost exactly  towards the west and one-third of the way from the zenith towards the  horizon (because one-third of the way from the centre towards the  circumference of the map). Almost exactly in the zenith is the star  [delta] Aurigae.    The four maps are miniatures of Maps I., IV., VII., and X. of my  'Constellation Seasons,' fourth-magnitude stars, however, being omitted.      PLATES II., III., IV., and V., illustrating Chapters II., III., IV., and V.    Plates II. and IV. contain four star-maps. They not only serve to  indicate the configuration of certain important star-groups, but they  illustrate the construction of maps, such as the observer should make  for himself when he wishes to obtain an accurate knowledge of particular  regions of the sky. They are all made to one scale, and on the conical  projection--the simplest and best of all projections for maps of this  sort. The way in which the meridians and parallels for this projection  are laid down is described in my 'Handbook of the Stars.' With a little  practice a few minutes will suffice for sweeping out the equidistant  circular arcs which mark the parallels and ruling in the straight  meridians.    The dotted line across three of the maps represents a portion of the  horizontal circle midway between the zenith and the horizon at the hour  at which the map is supposed to be used. At other hours, of course, this  line would be differently situated.    Plates III. and V. represent fifty-two of the objects mentioned in the  above-named chapters. As reference is made to these figures in the text,  little comment is here required. It is to be remarked, however, that the  circles, and especially the small circles, do not represent the whole  of the telescope's field of view, only a small portion of it. The object  of these figures is to enable the observer to know what to expect when  he turns his telescope towards a difficult double star. Many of the  objects depicted are very easy doubles: these are given as objects of  reference. The observer having seen the correspondence between an easy  double and its picture, as respects the relation between the line  joining the components and the apparent path of the double across the  telescope's field of view, will know how to interpret the picture of a  difficult double in this respect. And as all the small figures are drawn  to one scale, he will also know how far apart he may expect to find the  components of a difficult double. Thus he will have an exact conception  of the sort of duplicity he is to look for, and this is--_crede  experto_--a great step towards the detection of the star's duplicity.      PLATES VI. and VII., illustrating Chapters VI. and VII.    The views of Mercury, Venus, and Mars in these plates (except the  smaller view of Jupiter in Plate VII.) are supposed to be seen with the  same \"power.\"    The observer must not expect to see the details presented in the views  of Mars with anything like the distinctness I have here given to them.  If he place the plate at a distance of six or seven yards he will see  the views more nearly as Mars is likely to appear in a good three-inch  aperture.    The chart of Mars is a reduction of one I have constructed from views by  Mr. Dawes. I believe that nearly all the features included in the chart  are permanent, though not always visible. I take this opportunity of  noting that the eighteen orthographic pictures of Mars presented with my  shilling chart are to be looked on rather as maps than as representing  telescopic views. They illustrate usefully the varying presentation of  Mars towards the earth. The observer can obtain other such illustrations  for himself by filling in outlines, traced from those given at the foot  of Plate VI., with details from the chart. It is to be noted that Mars  varies in presentation, not only as respects the greater or less opening  out of his equator towards the north or south, but as respects the  apparent slope of his polar axis to the right or left. The four  projections as shown, or inverted, or seen from the back of the plate  (held up to the light) give presentations of Mars towards the sun at  twelve periods of the Martial year,--viz., at the autumnal and vernal  equinoxes, at the two solstices, and at intermediate periods  corresponding to our terrestrial months.    In fact, by means of these projections one might readily form a series  of sun-views of Mars resembling my 'Sun-views of the Earth.'    In the first view of Jupiter it is to be remarked that the three  satellites outside the disc are supposed to be moving in directions  appreciably parallel to the belts on the disc--the upper satellites from  right to left, the lower one from left to right. In general the  satellites, when so near to the disc, are not seen in a straight line,  as the three shown in the figure happen to be. Of the three spots on the  disc, the faintest is a satellite, the neighbouring dark spot its  shadow, the other dark spot the shadow of the satellite close to the  planet's disc.          HALF-HOURS WITH THE TELESCOPE.          CHAPTER I.    A HALF-HOUR ON THE STRUCTURE OF THE TELESCOPE.      There are few instruments which yield more pleasure and instruction than  the Telescope. Even a small telescope--only an inch and a half or two  inches, perhaps, in aperture--will serve to supply profitable amusement  to those who know how to apply its powers. I have often seen with  pleasure the surprise with which the performance even of an opera-glass,  well steadied, and directed towards certain parts of the heavens, has  been witnessed by those who have supposed that nothing but an expensive  and colossal telescope could afford any views of interest. But a  well-constructed achromatic of two or three inches in aperture will not  merely supply amusement and instruction,--it may be made to do useful  work.    The student of astronomy is often deterred from telescopic observation  by the thought that in a field wherein so many have laboured, with  abilities and means perhaps far"]]]
