Author of \"Mark Mason's Victory,\" \"Ben Bruce,\" \"Bernard Brook's  Adventures,\" \"A Debt of Honor,\" etc., etc.                A. L. Burt Company, Publishers  New York  1900          ADRIFT IN NEW YORK.        Chapter I.  The Missing Heir.      \"Uncle, you are not looking well to-night.\"    \"I'm not well, Florence. I sometimes doubt if I shall ever be any  better.\"    \"Surely, uncle, you cannot mean----\"    \"Yes, my child, I have reason to believe that I am nearing the end.\"    \"I cannot bear to hear you speak so, uncle,\" said Florence Linden, in  irrepressible agitation. \"You are not an old man. You are but  fifty-four.\"    \"True, Florence, but it is not years only that make a man old. Two  great sorrows have embittered my life. First, the death of my dearly  beloved wife, and next, the loss of my boy, Harvey.\"    \"It is long since I have heard you refer to my cousin's loss. I  thought you had become reconciled--no, I do not mean that,--I thought  your regret might be less poignant.\"    \"I have not permitted myself to speak of it, but I have never ceased  to think of it day and night.\"    John Linden paused sadly, then resumed:    \"If he had died, I might, as you say, have become reconciled; but he  was abducted at the age of four by a revengeful servant whom I had  discharged from my employment. Heaven knows whether he is living or  dead, but it is impressed upon my mind that he still lives, it may be  in misery, it may be as a criminal, while I, his unhappy father, live  on in luxury which I cannot enjoy, with no one to care for me----\"    Florence Linden sank impulsively on her knees beside her uncle's  chair.    \"Don't say that, uncle,\" she pleaded. \"You know that I love you, Uncle  John.\"    \"And I, too, uncle.\"    There was a shade of jealousy in the voice of Curtis Waring as he  entered the library through the open door, and approaching his uncle,  pressed his hand.    He was a tall, dark-complexioned man, of perhaps thirty-five, with  shifty, black eyes and thin lips, shaded by a dark mustache. It was  not a face to trust.    Even when he smiled the expression of his face did not soften. Yet he  could moderate his voice so as to express tenderness and sympathy.    He was the son of an elder sister of Mr. Linden, while Florence was  the daughter of a younger brother.    Both were orphans, and both formed a part of Mr. Linden's household,  and owed everything to his bounty.    Curtis was supposed to be in some business downtown; but he received a  liberal allowance from his uncle, and often drew upon him for outside  assistance.    As he stood with his uncle's hand in his, he was necessarily brought  near Florence, who instinctively drew a little away, with a slight  shudder indicating repugnance.    Slight as it was, Curtis detected it, and his face darkened.    John Linden looked from one to the other. \"Yes,\" he said, \"I must not  forget that I have a nephew and a niece. You are both dear to me, but  no one can take the place of the boy I have lost.\"    \"But it is so long ago, uncle,\" said Curtis. \"It must be fourteen  years.\"    \"It is fourteen years.\"    \"And the boy is long since dead!\"    \"No, no!\" said John Linden, vehemently. \"I do not, I will not, believe  it. He still lives, and I live only in the hope of one day clasping  him in my arms.\"    \"That is very improbable, uncle,\" said Curtis, in a tone of annoyance.  \"There isn't one chance in a hundred that my cousin still lives. The  grave has closed over him long since. The sooner you make up your mind  to accept the inevitable the better.\"    The drawn features of the old man showed that the words had a  depressing effect upon his mind, but Florence interrupted her cousin  with an indignant protest.    \"How can you speak so, Curtis?\" she exclaimed. \"Leave Uncle John the  hope that he has so long cherished. I have a presentiment that Harvey  still lives.\"    John Linden's face brightened up    \"You, too, believe it possible, Florence?\" he said, eagerly.    \"Yes, uncle. I not only believe it possible, but probable. How old  would Harvey be if he still lived?\"    \"Eighteen--nearly a year older than yourself.\"    \"How strange! I always think of him as a little boy.\"    \"And I, too, Florence. He rises before me in his little velvet suit,  as he was when I last saw him, with his sweet, boyish face, in which  his mother's looks were reflected.\"    \"Yet, if still living,\" interrupted Curtis, harshly, \"he is a rough  street boy, perchance serving his time at Blackwell's Island, and, a  hardened young ruffian, whom it would be bitter mortification to  recognize as your son.\"    \"That's the sorrowful part of it,\" said his uncle, in a voice of  anguish. \"That is what I most dread.\"    \"Then, since even if he were living you would not care to recognize  him, why not cease to think of him, or else regard him as dead?\"    \"Curtis Waring, have you no heart?\" demanded Florence, indignantly.    \"Indeed, Florence, you ought to know,\" said Curtis, sinking his voice  into softly modulated accents.    \"I know nothing of it,\" said Florence, coldly, rising from her  recumbent position, and drawing aloof from Curtis.    \"You know that the dearest wish of my heart is to find favor in your  eyes. Uncle, you know my wish, and approve of it, do you not?\"    \"Yes, Curtis; you and Florence are equally dear to me, and it is my  hope that you may be united. In that case, there will be no division  of my fortune. It will be left to you jointly.\"    \"Believe me, sir,\" said Curtis, with faltering voice, feigning an  emotion which he did not feel, \"believe me, that I fully appreciate  your goodness. I am sure Florence joins with me----\"    \"Florence can speak for herself,\" said his cousin, coldly. \"My uncle  needs no assurance from me. He is always kind, and I am always  grateful.\"    John Linden seemed absorbed in thought.    \"I do not doubt your affection,\" he said; \"and I have shown it by  making you my joint heirs in the event of your marriage; but it is  only fair to say that my property goes to my boy, if he still lives.\"    \"But, sir,\" protested Curtis, \"is not that likely to create  unnecessary trouble? It can never be known, and meanwhile----\"    \"You and Florence will hold the property in trust.\"    \"Have you so specified in your will?\" asked Curtis.    \"I have made two wills. Both are in yonder secretary. By the first the  property is bequeathed to you and Florence. By the second and later,  it goes to my lost boy in the event of his recovery. Of course, you  and Florence are not forgotten, but the bulk of the property goes to  Harvey.\"    \"I sincerely wish the boy might be restored to you,\" said Curtis; but  his tone belied his words. \"Believe me, the loss of the property would  affect me little, if you could be made happy by realizing your warmest  desire; but, uncle, I think it only the part of a friend to point out  to you, as I have already done, the baselessness of any such  expectation.\"    \"It may be as you say, Curtis,\" said his uncle, with a sigh. \"If I  were thoroughly convinced of it, I would destroy the later will, and  leave my property absolutely to you and Florence.\"    \"No, uncle,\" said Florence, impulsively, \"make no change; let the will  stand.\"    Curtis, screened from his uncle's view, darted a glance of bitter  indignation at Florence.    \"Is the girl mad?\" he muttered to himself. \"Must she forever balk me?\"    \"Let it be so for the present, then,\" said Mr. Linden, wearily.  \"Curtis, will you ring the bell? I am tired, and shall retire to my  couch early.\"    \"Let me help you, Uncle John,\" said Florence, eagerly.    \"It is too much for your strength, my child. I am growing more and  more helpless.\"    \"I, too, can help,\" said Curtis.    John Linden, supported on either side by his nephew and niece, left  the room, and was assisted to his chamber.    Curtis and Florence returned to the library.    \"Florence,\" said her cousin, \"my uncle's intentions, as expressed  to-night, make it desirable that there should be an understanding  between us. Take a seat beside me\"--leading her to a sofa--\"and let  us talk this matter over.\"    With a gesture of repulsion Florence declined the proffered seat, and  remained standing.    \"As you please,\" she answered, coldly.    \"Will you be seated?\"    \"No; our interview will be brief.\"    \"Then I will come to the point. Uncle John wishes to see us united.\"    \"It can never be!\" said Florence, decidedly.    Curtis bit his lip in mortification, for her tone was cold and  scornful.    Mingled with this mortification was genuine regret, for, so far as he  was capable of loving any one, he loved his fair young cousin.    \"You profess to love Uncle John, and yet you would disappoint his  cherished hope!\" he returned.    \"Is it his cherished hope?\"    \"There is no doubt about it. He has spoken to me more than once on the  subject. Feeling that his end is near, he wishes to leave you in  charge of a protector.\"    \"I can protect myself,\" said Florence, proudly.    \"You think so. You do not consider the hapless lot of a penniless girl  in a cold and selfish world.\"    \"Penniless?\" repeated Florence, in an accent of surprise.    \"Yes, penniless. Our uncle's bequest to you is conditional upon your  acceptance of my hand.\"    \"Has he said this?\" asked Florence, sinking into an armchair, with a  helpless look.    \"He has told me so more than once,\" returned Curtis, smoothly. \"You  don't know how near to his heart this marriage is. I know what you  would say: If the property comes to me I could come to your  assistance, but I am"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1860"],[0,"Westward Ho!

OXENHAM SAW THE WHITE BIRD         \"The hollow oak our palace is,          Our heritage the sea.\"    All who have travelled through the delicious scenery of North Devon must  needs know the little white town of Bideford, which slopes upwards from  its broad tide-river paved with yellow sands, and many-arched old bridge  where salmon wait for autumn floods, toward the pleasant upland on the  west. Above the town the hills close in, cushioned with deep oak woods,  through which juts here and there a crag of fern-fringed slate; below  they lower, and open more and more in softly rounded knolls, and fertile  squares of red and green, till they sink into the wide expanse of hazy  flats, rich salt-marshes, and rolling sand-hills, where Torridge joins  her sister Taw, and both together flow quietly toward the broad surges  of the bar, and the everlasting thunder of the long Atlantic swell.  Pleasantly the old town stands there, beneath its soft Italian sky,  fanned day and night by the fresh ocean breeze, which forbids alike the  keen winter frosts, and the fierce thunder heats of the midland; and  pleasantly it has stood there for now, perhaps, eight hundred years  since the first Grenville, cousin of the Conqueror, returning from the  conquest of South Wales, drew round him trusty Saxon serfs, and free  Norse rovers with their golden curls, and dark Silurian Britons from  the Swansea shore, and all the mingled blood which still gives to the  seaward folk of the next county their strength and intellect, and, even  in these levelling days, their peculiar beauty of face and form.    But at the time whereof I write, Bideford was not merely a pleasant  country town, whose quay was haunted by a few coasting craft. It was  one of the chief ports of England; it furnished seven ships to fight the  Armada: even more than a century afterwards, say the chroniclers, \"it  sent more vessels to the northern trade than any port in England, saving  (strange juxtaposition!) London and Topsham,\" and was the centre of a  local civilization and enterprise, small perhaps compared with the  vast efforts of the present day: but who dare despise the day of small  things, if it has proved to be the dawn of mighty ones? And it is to the  sea-life and labor of Bideford, and Dartmouth, and Topsham, and Plymouth  (then a petty place), and many another little western town, that England  owes the foundation of her naval and commercial glory. It was the men  of Devon, the Drakes and Hawkins', Gilberts and Raleighs, Grenvilles and  Oxenhams, and a host more of \"forgotten worthies,\" whom we shall learn  one day to honor as they deserve, to whom she owes her commerce, her  colonies, her very existence. For had they not first crippled, by their  West Indian raids, the ill-gotten resources of the Spaniard, and then  crushed his last huge effort in Britain's Salamis, the glorious fight of  1588, what had we been by now but a popish appanage of a world-tyranny  as cruel as heathen Rome itself, and far more devilish?    It is in memory of these men, their voyages and their battles, their  faith and their valor, their heroic lives and no less heroic deaths,  that I write this book; and if now and then I shall seem to warm into  a style somewhat too stilted and pompous, let me be excused for my  subject's sake, fit rather to have been sung than said, and to have  proclaimed to all true English hearts, not as a novel but as an epic  (which some man may yet gird himself to write), the same great message  which the songs of Troy, and the Persian wars, and the trophies of  Marathon and Salamis, spoke to the hearts of all true Greeks of old.      One bright summer's afternoon, in the year of grace 1575, a tall and  fair boy came lingering along Bideford quay, in his scholar's gown,  with satchel and slate in hand, watching wistfully the shipping and the  sailors, till, just after he had passed the bottom of the High Street,  he came opposite to one of the many taverns which looked out upon the  river. In the open bay window sat merchants and gentlemen, discoursing  over their afternoon's draught of sack; and outside the door was  gathered a group of sailors, listening earnestly to some one who stood  in the midst. The boy, all alive for any sea-news, must needs go up  to them, and take his place among the sailor-lads who were peeping and  whispering under the elbows of the men; and so came in for the following  speech, delivered in a loud bold voice, with a strong Devonshire accent,  and a fair sprinkling of oaths.    \"If you don't believe me, go and see, or stay here and grow all over  blue mould. I tell you, as I am a gentleman, I saw it with these eyes,  and so did Salvation Yeo there, through a window in the lower room; and  we measured the heap, as I am a christened man, seventy foot long, ten  foot broad, and twelve foot high, of silver bars, and each bar between  a thirty and forty pound weight. And says Captain Drake: 'There, my lads  of Devon, I've brought you to the mouth of the world's treasure-house,  and it's your own fault now if you don't sweep it out as empty as a  stock-fish.'\"    \"Why didn't you bring some of they home, then, Mr. Oxenham?\"    \"Why weren't you there to help to carry them? We would have brought  'em away, safe enough, and young Drake and I had broke the door abroad  already, but Captain Drake goes off in a dead faint; and when we came  to look, he had a wound in his leg you might have laid three fingers in,  and his boots were full of blood, and had been for an hour or more; but  the heart of him was that, that he never knew it till he dropped,  and then his brother and I got him away to the boats, he kicking and  struggling, and bidding us let him go on with the fight, though every  step he took in the sand was in a pool of blood; and so we got off. And  tell me, ye sons of shotten herrings, wasn't it worth more to save him  than the dirty silver? for silver we can get again, brave boys: there's  more fish in the sea than ever came out of it, and more silver in Nombre  de Dios than would pave all the streets in the west country: but of such  captains as Franky Drake, Heaven never makes but one at a time; and if  we lose him, good-bye to England's luck, say I, and who don't agree, let  him choose his weapons, and I'm his man.\"    He who delivered this harangue was a tall and sturdy personage, with a  florid black-bearded face, and bold restless dark eyes, who leaned, with  crossed legs and arms akimbo, against the wall of the house; and seemed  in the eyes of the schoolboy a very magnifico, some prince or duke at  least. He was dressed (contrary to all sumptuary laws of the time) in  a suit of crimson velvet, a little the worse, perhaps, for wear; by his  side were a long Spanish rapier and a brace of daggers, gaudy enough  about the hilts; his fingers sparkled with rings; he had two or three  gold chains about his neck, and large earrings in his ears, behind one  of which a red rose was stuck jauntily enough among the glossy black  curls; on his head was a broad velvet Spanish hat, in which instead of a  feather was fastened with a great gold clasp a whole Quezal bird, whose  gorgeous plumage of fretted golden green shone like one entire precious  stone. As he finished his speech, he took off the said hat, and looking  at the bird in it--    \"Look ye, my lads, did you ever see such a fowl as that before? That's"]]]
