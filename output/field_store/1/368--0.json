Translated from the German    OF    FRIEDRICH WIECK.    BOSTON:  LOCKWOOD, BROOKS, & COMPANY.  1875.        Entered according to Act of Congress, in the year 1875, by                 NOYES, HOLMES, AND COMPANY,  In the Office of the Librarian of Congress, at Washington.    _Cambridge:_  _Press of John Wilson and Son._          TRANSLATOR'S PREFACE.      FRIEDRICH WIECK, the author of the work a translation of which is here  offered to the public, was during his long life a distinguished teacher  of music. He died in the autumn of 1873. He was the father and teacher  of the celebrated pianist, Clara Wieck, now Fr. Dr. Clara Schumann,  widow of the renowned composer Robert Schumann, who was also a pupil of  Wieck. His second daughter, Fraeulein Marie Wieck, is well known in  Germany as an artistic performer on the piano-forte.    I have translated this little book, with the belief that a knowledge of  the author's views will be no less valuable in America than in his own  country; and with the hope that it may find readers who will be glad to  receive the suggestions of so experienced a teacher.    In illustration of his method, in addition to the two Etudes, already  published by F. Whistling, Leipzig, a number of piano exercises, &c.,  selected from the literary remains of Wieck, by his daughter Marie  Wieck and his pupil Louis Grosse, are, it is said, about to be  published.    I have omitted in the translation a few portions on the composition and  management of the opera, on the giving of concerts, and on the  construction of the piano, thinking that they would be of little  interest or practical value to the general public.    MARY P. NICHOLS.          PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.      I here present to the musical public a book written in a style of my  own, not a scientific and systematically well-arranged treatise. This no  reasonable man would expect of an old music-master, who, in his long  practice in the realm of tones, could not arrive at learned and too  often fruitless deductions. Nature made me susceptible to that which is  good and beautiful; a correct instinct and a tolerable understanding  have taught me to avoid the false and the vicious; a desire for  increased knowledge has led me to observe carefully whatever I met with  in my path in life; and I may say, without hesitation, that I have  endeavored, according to my ability, to fill the position to which I  have been called. This is no vain boast, but only the justifiable  assertion of a good conscience; and this no man needs to withhold. For  these reasons, I have been unwilling to refrain from giving to the world  a true expression of my opinions and feelings. I trust they will meet  with a few sympathizing spirits who are willing to understand my aims;  but I shall be still more happy if, here and there, a music-teacher will  adopt the views here set forth, at the same time carefully and  thoughtfully supplying many things which it did not enter into my plan  to explain more in detail. Abundant material lay spread out before me,  and even increased upon my hands while I was writing. Art is indeed so  comprehensive, and every thing in life is so closely connected with it,  that whoever loves and fosters it will daily find in it new sources of  enjoyment and new incitements to study. The most experienced teacher of  art must be a constant learner.    I have always held and still hold the opinions advanced in this work,  and I have neglected no opportunity to impress them upon my pupils.    I may be allowed to mention here, with some satisfaction, my daughters  Clara and Marie; and, among numerous other pupils, I speak with equal  pleasure of the estimable Herr Waldemar Heller, of Dresden, and Prof.  E.F. Wenzel, of Leipzig. I have always enjoyed their affection and  gratitude, and I feel a pride that they continue to defend and to teach  the principles which they have received from me.    This is not the first time that I have appeared as an author. The  \"Signale fuer die musikalische Welt,\" as well as the \"Neue Zeitschrift  fuer Musik,\" have published numerous essays from my pen under various  titles. The approval which they met with, at the time of their  appearance, has induced me to undertake this larger work. Several of  those earlier writings are included in this book, but in a partially  altered form. The frequently recurring character, the teacher Dominie,  originated with these essays; I need hardly say that he represents my  humble self. Those who are otherwise unacquainted with me will through  him understand my character, and will moreover see that a man of such  caustic brevity can be, by no means, a master of polished style. May  this last acknowledgment appease all those critics whose hair is made to  stand on end by my inelegant mode of writing. I will make no further  apology for my style. I have often availed myself of the dialogue form,  because it was conducive to brevity; not less frequently I have made use  of the form of the epistle and of personal discourse, as being more  congenial to my individual manner than that of a serious treatise. I  have also undertaken to say something about singing! A piano-teacher, if  he is possessed of mind and talent, as I suppose him to be, whether he  teaches the elements or occupies himself with more advanced instruction,  should understand the art of singing; he, at least, should show a warm  interest in it, and should have an earnest love for it. When I speak in  general of singing, I refer to that species of singing which is a form  of beauty, and which is the foundation for the most refined and most  perfect interpretation of music; and, above all things, I consider the  culture of beautiful tones the basis for the finest possible touch upon  the piano. In many respects, the piano and singing should explain and  supplement each other. They should mutually assist in expressing the  sublime and the noble, in forms of unclouded beauty. My book will make  this evident to many; but whether it will succeed with all, I doubt. Not  a few will even be found who will lay aside my book with contempt, and  who will scorn the zeal of the \"man of the past age.\" I am quite  prepared for this: it is the fashion at present to undervalue the old  times and their defenders; but I shall continue to be conservative,  until the \"men of the future\" shall be able to show me results which  shall excel those of the past, or at least shall equal them.    And now I commend my little book to the public, trusting that it will  instruct the willing, correct the erring, incite the indolent, and  chastise those who wilfully persist in the wrong.

ON ELEMENTARY PIANO-FORTE INSTRUCTION.      You ask, my dear friend, for some particular information about my piano  method, especially with regard to my mode of elementary instruction,  which differs essentially from that in common use.    I give you here the main points; and, if you place confidence in my  experience of forty years, and if you will supply those details which I  have omitted, your own varied experience as a thoughtful, talented, and  earnest piano-teacher will enable you to understand my theory, from the  following dialogue between my humble self under the title of Dominie, my  friend, and the little Bessie:--    DOMINIE. My dear friend, how have you managed to make piano-playing so  utterly distasteful to little Susie? and how is it that the instruction  which you have given her for the last three years actually amounts to  nothing?    FRIEND. Well, I will tell you how I have proceeded. First I taught her  the names of the keys, that was pretty dull work for her; then I made  her learn the treble notes, which was a difficult matter; after that I  taught her the bass notes, which puzzled her still more; then I  undertook to teach her a pretty little piece, which she hoped to perform  for the delight of her parents. Of course she constantly confused the  bass and treble notes, she could not keep time, she always used the  wrong fingers and could not learn it at all. Then I scolded her,--she  only cried; I tried a little coaxing,--that made her cry worse; finally  I put an end to the piano lessons, and she begged me never to begin them  again; and there you have the whole story.    DOMINIE. You certainly might have begun more judiciously. How is it  possible for a child to climb a ladder when not only the lower rounds,  but a great many more, are wanting? Nature makes no leaps, least of all  with children.    FRIEND. But did she not begin to climb the ladder at the bottom?    DOMINIE. By no means. She certainly never was able to reach the top. I  should say, rather, that she tumbled down head foremost. To speak  mildly, she began to climb in the middle; and even then you tried to  chase her up, instead of allowing her, carefully and quietly, to clamber  up one step at a time. Bring me your youngest daughter, Bessie, and I  will show you how I give a first lesson.    DOMINIE. Bessie, can you say your letters after me? so,--_c_, _d_, _e_,  _f_.    BESSIE. _c_, _d_, _e_, _f_.    DOMINIE. Go on,--_g_, _a_, _b_, _c_.
