The first edition of 1884 contained but 5 pages of type; the second of  1898, 14 pages. Only by conciseness has it been possible to give even a  summary of the principles of dietetics within the limit or this pamphlet.  Should there appear in places an abruptness or incompleteness of  treatment, these limitations must be my excuse.    Those who wish to thoroughly study the science of food are referred to the  standard work, \"Food and Dietetics,\" by Dr. R. Hutchison (E. Arnold,  16s.). The effects of purin bodies in producing illness has been patiently  and thoroughly worked out by Dr. Alexander Haig. Students are referred to  his \"Uric Acid, an epitome of the subject\" (J. & A. Churchhill, 1904,  2s.6d.), or to his larger work on \"Uric Acid.\" An able scientific summary  of investigations on purins, their chemical and pathological properties,  and the quantities in foods will be found in \"The Purin Bodies of Food  Stuffs,\" by Dr. I. Walker Hall (Sherratt & Hughes, Manchester, 1903,  4s.6d.). The U.S. Department of Agriculture has made a large number of  elaborate researches on food and nutrition. My thanks are due to Mr.  Albert Broadbent, the Secretary of the Vegetarian Society, for placing  some of their bulletins in my hands, and for suggestions and help. He has  also written several useful popular booklets on food of a very practical  character, at from a penny to threepence each.    Popular literature abounds in unsound statements on food. It is  unfortunate that many ardent workers in the cause of health are lacking  in scientific knowledge, especially of physiology and chemistry. By their  immature and sweeping statements from the platform and press, they often  bring discredit on a good cause. Matters of health must be primarily based  on experience and we must bear in mind that each person can at the most  have full knowledge of himself alone, and to a less degree of his family  and intimates. The general rules of health are applicable to all alike,  but not in their details. Owing to individual imperfections of  constitution, difference of temperament and environment, there is danger  when one man attempts to measure others by his own standard.    For the opinions here expressed I only must be held responsible, and not  the Society publishing the pamphlet.    Vegetarians, generally, place the humane as the highest reason for their  practice, though the determining cause of the change from a flesh diet has  been in most cases bad health.    A vegetarian may be defined as one who abstains from all animals as food.  The term animal is used in its proper scientific sense (comprising  insects, molluscs, crustaceans, fish, etc.). Animal products are not  excluded, though they are not considered really necessary. They are  looked upon as a great convenience, whilst free from nearly all the  objections appertaining to flesh food.    A.W.D.          The Chemistry of Food and Nutrition    By A.W. DUNCAN, F.C.S.      We may define a food to be any substance which will repair the functional  waste of the body, increase its growth, or maintain the heat, muscular,  and nervous energy. In its most comprehensive sense, the oxygen of the air  is a food; as although it is admitted by the lungs, it passes into the  blood, and there re-acts upon the other food which has passed through the  stomach. It is usual, however, to restrict the term food to such nutriment  as enters the body by the intestinal canal. Water is often spoken of as  being distinct from food, but for this there is no sufficient reason.    Many popular writers have divided foods into flesh-formers, heat-givers,  and bone-formers. Although attractive from its simplicity, this  classification will not bear criticism. Flesh-formers are also  heat-givers. Only a portion of the mineral matter goes to form bone.    Class I.--INORGANIC COMPOUNDS.    Sub-class 1. Water. 2. Mineral Matter or Salts.  Class II--ORGANIC COMPOUNDS.    1. Non-Nitrogeneous or Ternary Compounds. _a_ Carbohydrates.      _b_ Oils. _c_ Organic Acids.    2. Nitrogenous Compounds. _a_ Proteids. _b_ Osseids.  Class III.--NON-NUTRITIVES, FOOD ADJUNCTS AND DRUGS.    Essential Oils, Alkaloids, Extractives, Alcohol, &c.    These last are not strictly foods, if we keep to the definition already  given; but they are consumed with the true foods or"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15240"],[0,"A Journal of a Tour in the Congo Free State (#1)"],[1,"Distributed Proofreading Team        Note: Project Gutenberg also has an HTML version of this        file which includes the original illustrations.

Originally published in 1905 by J. Lebegue and Co., Brussels and  Kegan Paul, Trench, Truebner & Co., Ltd., London                Dedicated by Permission to  His Majesty Leopold II,  King of Belgium and Sovereign of the Congo Free State.          PREFACE.      This journal is practically my Diary reproduced with the minimum of  editing in order that the impressions gained on the spot should be  described without modification. It was never intended for publication,  and was written only as an aid to memory. Consequently it is little more  than a collection of rough notes.    Having left England with a prejudice against the Government of the Congo  Free State and returned with a very strong feeling in its favour, I feel  however that it is my duty to publish an account of what I did see for  the benefit of those whose opinions are not already formed beyond  recall.    As in all controversies where feelings subordinate reason and people  judge more by their emotions than by evidence, many are too quick to-day  to attribute interested motives to those whose opinions are not similar  to their own. Since a great number of people in the Congo and at home  are curious to know whether I was sent out by the Congo Government, the  British Government or the _Times_, I will state here once for all that I  went to the Congo entirely to please myself and with the hope of  shooting big game. In order indeed to satisfy curiosity, I will go  further and state that not only was I not paid for telling the truth,  but that the trip cost me a great deal of money.    It is however delightful to remember that wherever I went I was treated  with the greatest kindness and courtesy by all whether they approved of  the system of the Congo Government or not and it gives me great pleasure  to thank here the State officials, Missionaries of all denominations and  Traders of various nationalities for their hospitality, friendship and  valuable assistance.    M.R.P.D.    London 1905.    [Illustration: MAP--ITINERARY OF MARCUS R.P. DORMAN IN  THE CONGO FREE STATE]    [Illustration: THE STEAMER _FLORIDA_.]          CHAPTER I.    London to Banana.      There was no time to spare. The ship sailed from Southampton in forty  eight hours and I had only just arranged to accompany Lord Mountmorres  on a tour in the Congo Free Stale. He was going out for the purpose of  discovering the true condition of affairs in that country and of writing  articles thereupon for the _Globe_ but incidentally hoped to have some  big game shooting. After one has read much about a country it is always  interesting to visit it and as the prospect of good sport was added in  this case, I at once decided to brave the cannibals, wild beasts,  and--most dangerous of all--the climate, and to seize the opportunity to  visit the Congo.    It was necessary to purchase a complete camp outfit, suitable clothes  and much food-stuff and to arrange certain affairs at home. The first  part was however rendered easy for it was only necessary to duplicate  the order already given by Lord Mountmorres, and with a rapidity which  could not be equalled anywhere else, the Army and Navy Stores and  Messrs. Silvers packed and despatched tent, furniture and cases in a few  hours.    As there are many and varied discomforts which cannot be avoided when  travelling in the Congo, or any other tropical and half-civilised  country, it is just as well not to add to their number by omitting to  benefit by the experience of others. A few hints may therefore be  inserted here without apology for the benefit of other travellers. The  first articles to be considered are a tent, bed, and mosquito-net. Now  when the usual oblong tent with a penthouse roof is pitched and the bed  made, surmounted by the mosquito-net, the only place in which there is  room for it, is in the middle of the tent between the two poles. The  result is that as the roof slopes, it is absolutely impossible to stand  upright on either side and much space is therefore wasted. It would be  better to arrange for the bed to stand close to one side of the tent and  for the net to be attached to the sloping roof leaving the middle and  the other side free for table and chair. Circles of hooks for clothes  should be attached to the poles and large pockets in the walls of the  tent itself are useful. It is needless to specify particulars about  furniture, and I will only say that the folding or concertina pattern  bed, bath, washhandstand and table proved very comfortable and  withstood the great strain of being packed and unpacked nearly every day  for six months without breaking down. A strong, long lounge chair is  absolutely necessary. In climates where there is much glare, everything  should be made of green canvas. The well-known Lord's patent petrol lamp  is certainly the best and although it necessitates carrying a good  supply of oil, is cleaner and more convenient than candles. There is not  space here to give a list of all the necessities for travelling and  camping in the forests of Africa and it is enough to say that one has to  carry a complete house, furniture, kitchen utensils and much food. Wheat  and milk cows do not exist in the forest and very little grows which is  edible. It is therefore necessary to carry sufficient flour, butter,  lard, condiments, tinned meats, vegetables and fruits in order to cook,  and to make a variety from the antelopes, fish, game, goats and chickens  which are procurable on the spot. Water bottles and filters are very  necessary, but for Africa the best change at home--those which have  porcelain cores--are of no use for the water is very muddy, and the  minute pores at once become blocked. The charcoal filters, although  bulky to carry, are therefore the best for the forest. The question of  alcohol must be left to the individual himself, but it must be  remembered that there are only a very few places where it can be  purchased in the Congo and that the State officials are only permitted  to have a limited amount for themselves. Undoubtedly the best wine for  the climate is good claret or burgundy, and the healthiest spirit,  whisky. It is however, well to have some medical comforts in the shape  of champagne and brandy to take after attacks of fever. Excellent  native coffee can be purchased; tea and sugar must be carried. Drugs,  especially iron, quinine, arsenic and phenacetin are essential as also  splints, bandages and dressings in case of accidents.    Now it must be remembered that the climate is hot and humid. Metals rust  at once, leather and cloth become mouldy, food stuffs will keep one or  two days only after the tins are opened, and cigars, tobacco and  cigarettes become damp and ferment. In packing therefore, all the food,  cigars, cigarettes and tobacco should be soldered airtight and in tins  so arranged that when once opened, it is possible _to shut_ them again.  A tin of sardines or condensed milk once opened cannot be carried in a  case liable to be upside down at any moment. There are however, some  bottles with screw tops and india-rubber rings in which Messrs. Crosse  and Blackwell send out jam. These are airtight and so very useful for  when they are empty they can be cleaned and used for milk, sardines, or  anything else again and again. Messrs. Huntley and Palmer pack biscuits  in their usual tins but with an inner lid soldered, and these are also  very convenient. Above all things, remember curry powder, pickles,  chutney and Worcester sauce, for even goat's flesh can be rendered  pleasant if it tastes of something else. All this may sound trivial, but  it is really very important, for the appetite is easily lost in the  Congo and if the strength is not maintained by plenty of food, sickness  is certain to follow. Leather cases for rifles and guns are not good as  they deteriorate. The best case I have ever seen was made for me by a  ship's boatswain. It was of strong sail canvas made to fit the rifle  and covered outside with ordinary ship's paint; the inside speedily  became lined with oil and the whole formed an excellent guard against  the damp. It is however, necessary to have firearms cleaned and oiled  nearly every day whether used or not.    Clothes of cloth are not necessary. Drill, khaki and flannel are  sufficient with light helmets and plenty of strong boots. It must be  remembered that everything has to be carried by porters. Clothes,  blankets, etc. should be packed in tin boxes with rubber edges so that  when shut they are airtight; tents pack in bales and every article of  furniture should fold up. The whole equipment must be arranged so that  each load is about 50 or 60 lbs and is conveniently shaped for carrying  on the head or shoulder. We were careful to choose the lightest  articles, whenever consistent with strength, and thus our baggage when  completed weighed only a little more than two tons.    All was ready when we left Waterloo at 10.25 a.m. on Friday June 24th  1904 accompanied by Sir Alfred Jones and Sir Ralph Moor who saw us off  at Southampton. The latter has had much experience of Africa and told  some blood-curdling stories of the manners of the natives. Adulterers  used to be punished in a most barbarous way.
