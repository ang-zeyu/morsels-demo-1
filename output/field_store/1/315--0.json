INDIA    OLD AND NEW        BY    SIR VALENTINE CHIROL      AUTHOR OF \"INDIAN UNREST,\" \"THE EGYPTIAN PROBLEM,\" ETC.           \"We shall in time so far improve the character of our       Indian subjects as to enable them to govern and protect       themselves.\"--Minute by Sir Thomas Munro, Governor       of Madras, Dec. 31, 1824.        MACMILLAN AND CO., LIMITED    ST. MARTIN'S STREET, LONDON    1921          FOREWORD      It is little more than ten years since I wrote my _Indian Unrest_. But  they have been years that may well count for decades in the history of  the world, and not least in the history of India. Much has happened in  India to confirm many of the views which I then expressed. Much has  happened also to lead me to modify others, and to recognise more clearly  to-day the shortcomings of a system of government, in many ways  unrivalled, but subject to the inevitable limitations of alien rule.    At a very early stage of the Great War the Prime Minister warned the  British people that, after the splendid demonstration India was already  giving of her loyalty to the cause for which the whole Empire was then  in arms, our relations with her would have henceforth to be approached  from \"a new angle of vision.\" The phrase he used acquired a deeper  meaning still as the war developed from year to year into a  life-and-death struggle not merely between nations but between ideals,  and India claimed for herself the benefit of the ideals for which she  too fought and helped the British Commonwealth to victory. When victory  was assured, could India's claim be denied after she had been called in,  with all the members of the British Commonwealth, to the War Councils of  the Empire in the hour of need, and again been associated with them in  the making of peace? The British people have answered that question as  all the best traditions of British governance in India, and all the  principles for which they had fought and endured through four and a half  years of frightful war, bade them answer it.    The answer finally took shape in the great constitutional experiment of  which I witnessed the inauguration during my visit to India this winter.  It promises to rally as seldom before in active support of the British  connection those classes that British rule brought within the orbit of  Western civilisation by the introduction of English education, just  about a century ago. It has not disarmed all the reactionary elements  which, even when disguised in a modern garb, draw their inspiration from  an ancient civilisation, remote indeed from, though not in its better  aspects irreconcilable with, our own. A century is but a short moment of  time in the long span of Indian history, and the antagonism between two  different types of civilisation cannot be easily or swiftly lived down.  It would be folly to underrate forces of resistance which are by no  means altogether ignoble, and in this volume I have studied their origin  and their vitality because they underlie the strange \"Non-co-operation\"  movement which has consciously or unconsciously arrayed every form of  racial and religious and economic and political discontent, not merely  against British rule, but against the progressive forces which contact  with Western civilisation has slowly brought into existence under  British rule in India itself. These forces have been stirred to new  endeavour by the goal now definitely placed within their reach. That we  were bound to set that goal and no other before them I have tried to  show by reviewing the consistent evolution of British policy in India  for the last 150 years, keeping, imperfectly sometimes, but in the main  surely, abreast of our own national and political evolution at home and  throughout the Empire. Once placed in its proper perspective, this great  experiment, though fraught with many dangers and difficulties, is one of  which the ultimate issue can be looked forward to hopefully as the not  unworthy sequel to the long series of bold and on the whole wonderfully  successful experiments that make up the unique story of British rule in  India.    I have to express my thanks to the proprietors of _The Times_ for  allowing me to use some of the letters which I wrote for that paper  whilst I was in India last winter, and also to the Royal Society of Arts  for permission to reproduce the main portions of a lecture delivered by  me last year on Hinduism as the first of the Memorial Lectures  instituted in honour of the late Sir George Birdwood, to whom I owe as  much for the deeper understanding which he gave me of old India as I do  to the late Mr. G.K. Gokhale for the clearer insight I gained from him  into the spirit of new India whilst we were colleagues from 1912 to 1915  on the Royal Commission on Indian Public Services.

To bring home to every Indian the full significance of the  occasion, the King-Emperor did not shrink from using in his Royal  Message an Indian word which not long ago was held to bear no other than  a seditious construction. His Majesty gave it a new and finer meaning.  \"For years--it may be for generations--patriotic and loyal Indians have  dreamed of _Swaraj_ for their motherland. To-day you have the beginnings  of _Swaraj_ within my Empire, and the widest scope and ample opportunity  for progress to the liberty which my other Dominions enjoy.\"    It was a bold pronouncement inaugurating another, some say the boldest,  of all the many bold adventures which make up the marvellous history of  British rule in India. The simplicity, rare in the East, of the ceremony  itself enhanced its significance. It was not held, like the opening of  the Chamber of Princes, in the splendid Hall of Public Audience in the  old Fort where the Moghul Emperors once sat on the Peacock Throne, nor  were there the flash of jewels and blaze of colour that faced the Duke  when he addressed the feudatory chiefs who still rule their states on  ancient lines beyond the limits of direct British administration. The  members of the new Indian Legislatures, most of them in sober European  attire, though many of them retained their own distinctive head-dress,  were assembled within the white and unadorned walls of the temporary  building in which they will continue to sit until the statelier home to  be built for them in new Delhi is ready to receive them. But Delhi  itself with all its age-long memories was around one to provide the  historic setting for an historic scene, and Delhi still stands under the  sign of the Kutub Minar, the splendid minaret--a landmark for miles and  miles around--which dominates the vast graveyard of fallen dynasties at  its feet and the whole of the great plain beyond where the fate of  India, and not of India alone, has so often been decided.    On that plain were fought out, in prehistoric times, the fierce  conflicts of ancient Aryan races, Pandavas and Kauravas, around which  the poetic genius of India has woven the wonderful epos of the  Mahabharata. Only a couple of miles south of the modern city, the walls  of the Purana Kilat, the fortress built by Humayun, cover the site but  have not obliterated the ancient name of Indraprasthra, or Indrapat, the  city founded by the Pandavas themselves, when Yudhisthira celebrated  their final victory by performing on the banks of the Jumna, in token of  the Pandava claim to Empire, the _Asvamedha_, or great Horse Sacrifice,  originated by Brahma himself. There too, on a mound beyond Indrapat,  stands the granite shaft of one of Asoka's pillars, on which, with a  fine faith that the world has never yet justified, the great Buddhist  Apostle-"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15604"],[0,"Piano Mastery: Talks with Master Pianists and Teachers (#1)"],[1,"Archive Million Book Project        Note: Project Gutenberg also has an HTML version of this        file which includes the original illustrations.

They were secured with the hope and intention of benefiting  the American teacher and student.    Requests have come from all over the country, asking that the interviews  be issued in book form. In this event it was the author's intention to  ask each artist to enlarge and add to his own talk. This, however, has  been practicable only in certain cases; in others the articles remain  very nearly as they at first appeared.    The summer of 1913 in Europe proved to be a veritable musical  pilgrimage, the milestones of which were the homes of the famous  artists, who generously gave of their time and were willing to discuss  their methods of playing and teaching.    The securing of the interviews has given the author satisfaction and  delight. She wishes to share both with the fellow workers of her own  land.    The Talks are arranged in the order in which they were secured.          PIANO MASTERY          PIANO MASTERY          I    IGNACE JAN PADEREWSKI      One of the most consummate masters of the piano at the present time is  Ignace Jan Paderewski. Those who were privileged to hear him during his  first season in this country will never forget the experience. The  Polish artist conquered the new world as he had conquered the old; his  name became a household word, known from coast to coast; he traveled  over our land, a Prince of Tones, everywhere welcomed and honored. Each  succeeding visit deepened the admiration in which his wonderful art was  held.    The question has often been raised as to the reason of Paderewski's  remarkable hold on an audience; wherein lay his power over the musical  and unmusical alike. Whenever he played there was always the same  intense hush over the listeners, the same absorbed attention, the same  spell. The superficial attributed these largely to his appearance and  manner; the more thoughtful looked deeper. Here was a player who was a  thoroughly trained master in technic and interpretation; one who knew  his Bach, Beethoven, Chopin, Schumann and Liszt. These things of  themselves would not hold an audience spellbound, for there were other  artists equally well equipped. In a final analysis it was doubtless  Paderewski's wonderful _piano tone_, so full of variety and color, so  vital with numberless gradations of light and shade, that charmed and  enthralled his listeners. It mattered to no one--save the critics--that  he frequently repeated the same works. What if we heard the Chromatic  Fantaisie a score of times? In his hands It became a veritable Soliloquy  on Life and Destiny, which each repetition invested with new meaning and  beauty. What player has ever surpassed his poetic conception of  Schumann's _Papillons_, or the Chopin Nocturnes, which he made veritable  dream poems of love and ecstasy. What listener has ever forgotten the  tremendous power and titanic effect of the Liszt Rhapsodies, especially  No. 2? When Paderewski first came to us, in the flush of his young  manhood, he taught us what a noble instrument the piano really is in the  hands of a consummate master. He showed us that he could make the piano  speak with the delicacy and power of a Rubinstein, but with more  technical correctness; he proved that he could pierce our very soul with  the intensity of his emotion, the poignant, heart-searching quality of  his tones, the poetry and beauty of his interpretation.    Paderewski is known as composer and pianist, only rarely does he find  time to give instruction on his instrument. Mme. Antoinette Szumowska,  the Polish pianist and lecturer was at one time termed his \"only pupil.\"  Mr. Sigismond Stojowski, the Polish composer, pianist and teacher has  also studied with him. Both can testify as to his value as an  instructor.    Mme. Szumowska says:    \"Paderewski lays great stress on legato playing, and desires everything  to be studied slowly, with deep touch and with full, clear tone. For  developing strength he uses an exercise for which the hand is pressed  against the keyboard while the wrist remains very low and motionless and  each finger presses on a key, bringing, or drawing out as much tone as  possible.    \"Paderewski advises studying scales and arpeggios with accents, for  instance, accenting every third note, thus enabling each finger in turn  to make the accent impulse: this will secure evenness of touch. Double  passages, such as double thirds and sixths, should be divided and each  half practised separately, with legato touch. Octaves should be  practised with loose wrists and staccato touch. As a preparatory study  practise with thumb alone. The thumb must always be kept curved, with  joints well rounded out; it should touch the keys with its tip, so as to  keep it on a level with the other fingers. Paderewski is very particular  about this point.    \"It is difficult to speak of Paderewski's manner of teaching expression,  for here the ideas differ with each composer and with every composition.  As to tonal color, he requires all possible variety in tone production.  He likes strong contrasts, which are brought out, not only by variety of  touch but by skilful use of the pedals.    \"My lessons with Paderewski were somewhat irregular. We worked together  whenever he came to Paris. Sometimes I did not see him for several  months, and then he would be in Paris for a number of weeks; at such  seasons we worked together very often. Frequently these lessons, which  were given in my cousin's house, began very late in the evening--around  ten o'clock--and lasted till midnight, or even till one in the morning.    \"Paderewski the teacher is as remarkable as Paderewski the pianist. He  is very painstaking; his remarks are clear and incisive: he often  illustrates by playing the passage in question, or the whole  composition. He takes infinite trouble to work out each detail and bring  it to perfection. He is very patient and sweet tempered, though he can  occasionally be a little sarcastic. He often grows very enthusiastic  over his teaching, and quite forgets the lapse of time. In general,  however, he does not care to teach, and naturally has little time for  it.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Mr. Stojowski, when questioned in regard to his work with the Polish  pianist, said:    \"Paderewski is a very remarkable teacher. There are teachers who attempt  to instruct pupils about what they do not understand, or cannot do  themselves: there are others who are able to do the thing, but are not  able to explain how they do it. Paderewski can both do it and explain  how it is done. He knows perfectly what effects he wishes to produce,  how they are to be produced, the causes which underlie and bring them  about; he can explain and demonstrate these to the pupil with the  greatest exactness and detail.    \"As you justly remark the quality of tone and the variety of tonal  gradations are special qualities of Paderewski's playing. These must be"]]]
