This illustrates    the extremely unreal and untrue conception of the earth    among Moslem students, especially those who followed the    theories of Ptolomy--_e.g._, in the extension to    Africa eastward, so as practically or actually to join    China, making the Indian Ocean an inland sea.

Of uncertain    date, between _c._ 780-980 but probably not later    than the 10th century. One of the earliest examples of    Christian map-making.        THE ANGLO-SAXON MAP                                      54      (B. Mus., Cotton mss., Tib. B.V., fol. 59). This gives    us the most interesting and accurate view of the world    that we get in the pre-Crusading Christian science. The    square, but not conventional outline is detailed with    considerable care and precision. The writing, though    minute, is legible; but the Nile, which, like the Red    Sea in Africa, is coloured _red_, in contrast to the    ordinary _grey_ of water in this example, is made to    wander about Africa from side to side, with occasional    disappearances, in a thoroughly mythical fashion. This    map, from a ms. of Priscian's _Peviegesis_, appears    to have been executed at the end of the 10th century; it    is on vellum, highly finished, and has been engraved, in    outline, in Playfair's _Atlas_ (Pl. I), and more fully    in the _Penny Magazine_ (July 22, 1837). In the reign    of Henry II., it appears to have belonged to Battle Abbey.

WITH    PICTURES TO MATCH      by    FRANCIS C. WOODWORTH,    Editor of \"The Youth's Cabinet,\" Author of \"Stories  About Birds,\" &C.                Boston.  Phillips, Sampson and Company.  1851.  Entered, according to Act of Congress, in  the year 1849,  By D. A. Woodworth,  in the Clerk's Office of the District Court for  the Southern District of New York.            Preface.      In the following pages are grouped together anecdotes illustrative of  the peculiarities of different animals--mostly quadrupeds--their habits,  dispositions, intelligence, and affection. Nothing like a scientific  treatise of any of these animals has been attempted. I do not even give  a generic or specific history of one of them, except so far as they are  all casually and incidentally described in these anecdotes. Their  natural history, in detail, I leave for others, as the historian or  biographer of men, bent only on a record of the thoughts, words, and  acts of men, passes by the abstract details, however interesting they  may be, of human physiology, and the general characteristics of the  species. I have not aimed to introduce to the reader, in this volume,  all the animals belonging to the race of quadrupeds, who have a claim to  such a distinction. I have preferred rather to make a selection from the  great multitude, and to present such facts and anecdotes respecting  those selected as shall, while they interest and entertain the young  reader, tend to make him familiar with this branch of useful knowledge.    I ought, in justice to myself, to explain the reason why I have  restricted my anecdotes almost exclusively to animals belonging to the  race of quadrupeds. It is seldom wise, in my judgment, for an author to  define, very minutely, any plan he may have, to be developed in future  years--as so many circumstances may thwart that plan altogether, or very  materially modify it. Yet I may say, in this connection, that the  general plan I had marked out for myself, when I set about the task of  collecting materials for these familiar anecdotes, is by no means  exhausted in this volume, and that, should my stories respecting  quadrupeds prove as acceptable to my young friends as I hope, it is my  intention eventually to pursue the same, or a similar course, in  relation to the other great divisions of the animal kingdom--Birds,  Reptiles, Insects, Fishes, etc.    The stories I tell I have picked up wherever I could find them--having  been generally content when I have judged a particular story to be, in  the first place, a good story, and in the second place, a reliable one.  I have not thought it either necessary or desirable, to give, in every  case, the source from which I have derived my facts. Some of them I  obtained by actual observation; quite as many were communicated by  personal friends and casual acquaintances; and by far the greater  portion were gleaned from the current newspapers of the day, and from  the many valuable works on natural history, published in England and in  this country. Among the books I have consulted, I am mostly indebted to  the following: Bingley's Anecdotes illustrative of the Instincts of  Animals; Knight's Library of Entertaining Knowledge; Bell's Phenomena of  Nature; the Young Naturalist's Rambles; Natural History of the Earth and  Man; Chambers' Miscellany of Useful and Entertaining Knowledge; Animal  Biography; and the Penny Magazine.    The task of preparing this volume for the press has been an exceedingly  pleasant one. Indeed, it has been rather recreation than toil, in  comparison with other and severer literary labors. I trust my young  friends will take as much pleasure in reading these stories as I have  taken in collecting them. I hope too, that no one of my readers will  fail to discover, as he proceeds, the evidences of the wisdom, power,  and goodness of the Being who formed and who controls and governs the  animal kingdom. Here, as in every department of nature's works, these  evidences abound, if we will but perceive them. Look at them, dear  reader, and in your admiration of nature, forget not the love and  reverence you owe to nature's God.    [Illustration: (signed) Francis C. Woodworth]          Contents.

The Dog.      Whatever may be thought of the somewhat aristocratic pretensions of the  lion, as the dog, after all, has the reputation of being the most  intelligent of the inferior animals, I will allow this interesting  family the precedence in these stories, and introduce them first to the  reader. For the same reason, too--because they exhibit such wonderful  marks of intelligence, approaching, sometimes, almost to the boundary of  human reason--I shall occupy much more time in relating stories about  them than about any other animal. Let me see. Where shall I begin? With  Rover, my old friend Rover--my companion and play-fellow, when a little  boy? I have a good mind to do so; for he endeared himself to me by  thousands of acts of kindness and affection, and he has still a place  of honor in my memory. He frequently went to school with me. As soon as  he saw me get my satchel of books, he was at my side, and off he ran  before me toward the school-house. When he had conducted me to school,  he usually took leave of me, and returned home. But he came back again,  before school was out, so as to be my companion homeward. I might tell a  great many stories about the smartness of Rover; but on the whole I  think I will forbear. I am afraid if I should talk half an hour about  him, some of you would accuse me of too much partiality for my  favorite, and would think I had fallen into the same foolish mistake  that is sometimes noticed in over-fond fathers and mothers, who talk  about a little boy or girl of theirs, as if there never was another such  a prodigy. So I will just pass over Rover's wonderful exploits--for he  had some, let me whisper it in your ear--and tell my stories about other  people's dogs.    [Illustration: ROVER AND HIS PLAY-FELLOW.]    \"Going to the dogs,\" is a favorite expression with a great many people.  They understand by it a condition in the last degree deplorable. To \"go  to the dogs,\" is spoken of as being just about the worst thing that can  happen to a poor fellow. I think differently, however. I wish from my  heart, that some selfish persons whom I could name would go to the dogs.  They would learn there, I am sure, what they have never learned  before--most valuable lessons in gratitude, and affection, and  self-sacrifice--to say nothing about common sense, a little more of  which would not hurt them.    There is an exceedingly affecting story of a dog that lived in Scotland  as long ago as 1716: This dog belonged to a Mr. Stewart, of Argyleshire,  and was a great favorite with his master. He was a Highland greyhound, I  believe. One afternoon, while his master was hunting in company with  this dog, he was attacked with inflammation in his side. He returned  home, and died the same evening. Some three days afterward his funeral  took place, when the dog followed the remains of his master to the  grave-yard, which was nearly ten miles from the residence of the family.  He remained until the interment was completed, when he returned home  with those who attended the funeral. When he entered the house he found  the plaid cloak, formerly his"]]]
