[Entered at Stationer's Hall.]          [Illustration: Olaudah Equiano or GUSTAVUS VASSA, _the African_]          To the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and the Commons of the  Parliament of Great Britain.      _My Lords and Gentlemen_,    Permit me, with the greatest deference and respect, to lay at your  feet the following genuine Narrative; the chief design of which is to  excite in your august assemblies a sense of compassion for the  miseries which the Slave-Trade has entailed on my unfortunate  countrymen. By the horrors of that trade was I first torn away from  all the tender connexions that were naturally dear to my heart; but  these, through the mysterious ways of Providence, I ought to regard as  infinitely more than compensated by the introduction I have thence  obtained to the knowledge of the Christian religion, and of a nation  which, by its liberal sentiments, its humanity, the glorious freedom  of its government, and its proficiency in arts and sciences, has  exalted the dignity of human nature.    I am sensible I ought to entreat your pardon for addressing to you a  work so wholly devoid of literary merit; but, as the production of an  unlettered African, who is actuated by the hope of becoming an  instrument towards the relief of his suffering countrymen, I trust  that _such a man_, pleading in _such a cause_, will be acquitted of  boldness and presumption.    May the God of heaven inspire your hearts with peculiar benevolence on  that important day when the question of Abolition is to be discussed,  when thousands, in consequence of your Determination, are to look for  Happiness or Misery!                                           I am,                               My Lords and Gentlemen,                                         Your most obedient,                                 And devoted humble Servant,                                         Olaudah Equiano,                                               or                                          Gustavus Vassa.

Part I    OBJECT LESSONS ON THE HUMAN BODY    A Transcript of Lessons Given in the Primary Department of School No. 49,  New York City    Pupils' Edition (Revised)    New York:  Parker P. Simmons,  Successor to  A. Lovell & Company    1904                AUTHOR'S NOTE TO THE PUPIL      This book has been prepared to help you in learning about \"the house you  live in,\" and to teach you to take care of it, and keep it from being  destroyed by two of its greatest enemies,--Alcohol and Nicotine.    As you study its pages, be sure to find out the meaning of every word in  them which you do not understand; for, if you let your tongue say what your  mind knows nothing about, you are talking _parrot-fashion_.    And do not forget that you must pay for all the knowledge you obtain,  whether you are rich or poor. Nobody else can pay for you. You, your own  self, must _pay attention_ with your own mind, through your own eyes and  ears, _or do without knowledge_.    Be wise: gain all the knowledge you can concerning everything worth  knowing, and use it for the good of yourself and other people.    \"KNOWLEDGE IS POWER.\"        [Illustration: A, the heart; B, the lungs; light cross lines, arteries;  heavy lines, veins.]        PART I.    FORMULA FOR INTRODUCTORY LESSONS.    1. My body is built of bones covered with flesh and skin; the blood flows  through it, all the time, from my heart. I breathe through my nose and  mouth, and take the air into my lungs.    2. The parts of my body are the head, the trunk, the limbs.    3. My head.    The crown of my head.    The back of my head.    The sides of my head.    My face.    My forehead.    My two temples.    My two eyes.    My nose.    My two cheeks.    My mouth.    My chin.    My two ears.    My neck.    My two shoulders.    My two arms.    My two hands.    My trunk.    My back.    My two sides.    My chest.    My two legs.    My two knees.    My two feet.    I am sitting erect.           *       *       *       *       *    QUESTIONS FOR THE FORMULA.    1. Tell about your body.    2. Name the parts of the body.    3. Name the parts of the head, trunk, and limbs.           *       *       *       *       *    THE NOSE AND THE MOUTH.    Be sure to keep your mouth closed when you are not talking or singing,  especially when you are walking, running, or _asleep_. The two nostrils are  outside doors, always open to admit the air, and inside of the upper part  of the nose there are two other openings, through which it passes into the  throat. Air which goes this way is warmed, cleansed, and moistened, but  that which is breathed directly through the mouth is not so well prepared  for its work in the lungs.    Do not use your mouth as a box or a pin-cushion; the pin, or whatever yon  have put into it, may slip into your throat and cause your death.           *       *       *       *       *    QUESTIONS ON THE INTRODUCTORY LESSONS.

My arm has two parts:      my upper arm,       my fore-arm;    and three joints:      my shoulder joint,       my elbow joint,       my wrist joint.    3. My hand is used in holding, throwing, catching, and feeling:      the palm of my hand,    the back of my hand,    my fingers,    my thumb,    my forefinger,    my middle finger,    my ring finger,    my little finger,    my knuckles,    my finger joints,    my nails,    the tips of my fingers,    the veins,    the ball of my thumb,    and the lines where the flesh is bent.    4. My leg has two parts:      my thigh,       and my lower leg;    and three joints:      my hip joint,       my knee joint,       my ankle joint.    5. My foot is used in standing, walking, running, skating, and jumping:      my instep,    my toes,    the sole of my foot,    the ball,    the hollow,    the heel,    my toe joints,    and my toe nails, which protect my toes.           *       *       *       *       *    QUESTIONS FOR THE FORMULA.    1. Which are your limbs?    2. Tell about your arm.    3. Tell about your hand.    4. Tell about your leg.    5.

(A ball-and-socket joint.)]    Some joints, as those of the skull, are immovable; some, as those of the  spine, may be moved a little; and others more or less freely, as those of  the limbs. In machines, the parts which move upon each other need to be  oiled, to keep them from wearing out; but the joints of our bodies oil  themselves with a thin fluid, called _synovia_. This fluid resembles the  white of an egg, and comes from a smooth lining inside of the joints. The  ends of the bones which form joints are covered by gristle or _cartilage_,  and are fastened together by very strong, silvery white bands, called  _ligaments_. A sprain is caused by overstretching or tearing some of these  ligaments.           *       *       *       *       *    QUESTIONS ON THE LIMBS AND JOINTS OF THE BODY.
