The people of  Anaugasa having revolted, two of their towns were taken, a third  surrendered, while the chiefs of the Lotanu hastened to meet their lord  with their usual tribute. Advantage was taken of the encampment being at  the foot of the Lebanon to procure wood for building purposes, such as  beams and planks, masts and yards for vessels, which were all shipped by  the Kefatiu at Byblos for exportation to the Delta. This expedition was,  indeed, little more than a military march through the country. It would  appear that the Syrians soon accustomed themselves to the presence of  the Egyptians in their midst, and their obedience henceforward could be  fairly relied on. We are unable to ascertain what were the circumstances  or the intrigues which, in the year XXXV., led to a sudden outbreak  among the tribes settled on the Euphrates and the Orontes. The King  of Mitanni rallied round him the princes of Naharaim, and awaited the  attack of the Egyptians near Aruna. Thutmosis displayed great personal  courage, and the victory was at once decisive. We find mention of only  ten prisoners, one hundred and eighty mares, and sixty chariots in the  lists of the spoil. Anaugasa again revolted, and was subdued afresh  in the year XXXVIII.; the Shausu rebelled in the year XXXIX., and the  Lotanu or some of the tribes connected with them two years later. The  campaign of the year XLII. proved more serious. Troubles had arisen in  the neighbourhood of Arvad. Thutmosis, instead of following the usual  caravan route, marched along the coast-road by way of Phoenicia. He  destroyed Arka in the Lebanon and the surrounding strongholds, which  were the haunts of robbers who lurked in the mountains; then turning to  the northeast, he took Tunipa and extorted the usual tribute from  the inhabitants of Naharaim. On the other hand, the Prince of Qodshu,  trusting to the strength of his walled city, refused to do homage to the  Pharaoh, and a deadly struggle took place under the ramparts, in which  each side availed themselves of all the artifices which the strategic  warfare of the times allowed. On a day when the assailants and besieged  were about to come to close quarters, the Amorites let loose a mare  among the chariotry of Thutmosis. The Egyptian horses threatened to  become unmanageable, and had begun to break through the ranks, when  Amenemhabi, an officer of the guard, leaped to the ground, and, running  up to the creature, disembowelled it with a thrust of his sword; this  done, he cut off its tail and presented it to the king. The besieged  were eventually obliged to shut themselves within their newly  built walls, hoping by this means to tire out the patience of their  assailants; but a picked body of men, led by the same brave Amenemhabi  who had killed the mare, succeeded in making a breach and forcing an  entrance into the town. Even the numerous successful campaigns we have  mentioned, form but a part, though indeed an important part, of the wars  undertaken by Thutmosis to \"fix his frontiers in the ends of the  earth.\" Scarcely a year elapsed without the viceroy of Ethiopia having a  conflict with one or other of the tribes of the Upper Nile; little merit  as he might gain in triumphing over such foes, the spoil taken from them  formed a considerable adjunct to the treasure collected in Syria, while  the tributes from the people of Kush and the Uauaiu were paid with as  great regularity as the taxes levied on the Egyptians themselves. It  comprised gold both from the mines and from the rivers, feathers, oxen  with curiously trained horns, giraffes, lions, leopards, and slaves of  all ages. The distant regions explored by Hatshopsitu continued to pay  a tribute at intervals. A fleet went to Puanit to fetch large cargoes  of incense, and from time to time some Ilim chief would feel himself  honoured by having one of his daughters accepted as an inmate of the  harem of the great king. After the year XLII. we have no further records  of the reign, but there is no reason to suppose that its closing years  were less eventful or less prosperous than the earlier. Thutmosis III.,  when conscious of failing powers, may have delegated the direction of  his armies to his sons or to his generals, but it is also quite possible  that he kept the supreme command in his own hands to the end of his  days. Even when old age approached and threatened to abate his vigour,  he was upheld by the belief that his father Amon was ever at hand to  guide him with his counsel and assist him in battle. \"I give to thee,  declared the god, the rebels that they may fall beneath thy sandals,  that thou mayest crush the rebellious, for I grant to thee by decree the  earth in its length and breadth. The tribes of the West and those of the  East are under the place of thy countenance, and when thou goest up  into all the strange lands with a joyous heart, there is none who  will withstand Thy Majesty, for I am thy guide when thou treadest them  underfoot. Thou hast crossed the water of the great curve of Naharaim*  in thy strength and in thy power, and I have commanded thee to let them  hear thy roaring which shall enter their dens, I have deprived their  nostrils of the breath of life, I have granted to thee that thy deeds  shall sink into their hearts, that my uraeus which is upon thy head may  burn them, that it may bring prisoners in long files from the peoples of  Qodi, that it may consume with its flame those who are in the marshes,**  that it may cut off the heads of the Asiatics without one of them being  able to escape from its clutch. I grant to thee that thy conquests may  embrace all lands, that the urseus which shines upon my forehead may be  thy vassal, so that in all the compass of the heaven there may not be  one to rise against thee, but that the people may come bearing their  tribute on their backs and bending before Thy Majesty according to my  behest; I ordain that all aggressors arising in thy time shall fail  before thee, their heart burning within them, their limbs trembling!\"         * The Euphrates, in the great curve described by it across       Naharaim, after issuing from the mountains of Cilicia.         ** The meaning is doubtful. The word signifies pools,       marshes, the provinces situated beyond Egyptian territory,       and consequently the distant parts of the world--those which       are nearest the ocean which encircles the earth, and which       was considered as fed by the stagnant waters of the       celestial Nile, just as the extremities of Egypt were       watered by those of the terrestrial Nile.

It continued to  extend in the south-western direction from the heroic period of  the XVIIIth dynasty onwards, and all the eminence and valleys were  gradually appropriated one after the other for burying-places. At the  time of which I am speaking, this region formed an actual town, or  rather a chain of villages, each of which was grouped round some  building constructed by one or other of the Pharaohs as a funerary  chapel. Towards the north, opposite Karnak, they clustered at  Drah-abu'l-Neggah around pyramids of the first Theban monarchs, at  Qurneh around the mausolae of Ramses I. and Seti I., and at Sheikh  Abd el-Qurneh they lay near the Amenopheum and the Pamonkaniqimit,  or Ramesseum built by Ramses II. Towards the south they diminished  in number, tombs and monuments becoming fewer and appearing at wider  intervals; the Migdol of Ramses III. formed an isolated suburb, that of  Azamit, at Medinet-Habu; the chapel of Isis, constructed by Amenothes,  son of Hapu, formed a rallying-point for the huts of the hamlet of  Karka;* and in the far distance, in a wild gorge at the extreme limit  of human habitations, the queens of the Ramesside line slept their last  sleep.         * The village of Karka or Kaka was identified by Brugsch       with the hamlet of Deir el-Medineh: the founder of the       temple was none other than Amenothes, who was minister under       Amenothes III.    [Illustration: 004.jpg THE THEBAN CEMETERIES]    Each of these temples had around it its enclosing wall of dried brick,  and the collection of buildings within this boundary formed the Khiru,  or retreat of some one of the Theban Pharaohs, which, in the official  language of the time, was designated the \"august Khiru of millions of  years.\"    [Illustration: 005.jpg THE NECROPOLIS OF SHEIKH AND EL-QURNEH]         Drawn by Boudier, from a photograph by Beato.    A sort of fortified structure, which was built into one of the corners,  served as a place of deposit for the treasure and archives, and could be  used as a prison if occasion required.*         * This was the hliatmu, the dungeon, frequently mentioned in       the documents bearing upon the necropolis.    The remaining buildings consisted of storehouses, stables, and houses  for the priests and other officials. In some cases the storehouses were  constructed on a regular plan which the architect had fitted in with  that of the temple. Their ruins at the back and sides of the Ramesseum  form a double row of vaults, extending from the foot of the hills to  the border of the cultivated lands. Stone recesses on the roof furnished  shelter for the watchmen.* The outermost of the village huts stood among  the nearest tombs. The population which had been gathered together there  was of a peculiar character, and we can gather but a feeble idea of its  nature from the surroundings of the cemeteries in our own great cities.  Death required, in fact, far more attendants among the ancient Egyptians  than with us. The first service was that of mummification, which  necessitated numbers of workers for its accomplishment. Some of the  workshops of the embalmers have been discovered from time to time at  Sheikh Abd el-Qurneh and Deir el-Bahari, but we are still in ignorance  as to their arrangements, and as to the exact nature of the materials  which they employed. A considerable superficial space was required, for  the manipulations of the embalmers occupied usually from sixty to eighty  days, and if we suppose that the average deaths at Thebes amounted to  fifteen or twenty in the twenty-four hours, they would have to provide  at the same time for the various degrees of saturation of some twelve to  fifteen hundred bodies at the least.**         * The discovery of quantities of ostraca in the ruins of       these chambers shows that they served partly for cellars.         ** I have formed my estimate of fifteen to twenty deaths per       day from the mortality of Cairo during the French       occupation. This is given by R. Desgenettes, in the       _Description de l'Egypte_, but only approximately, as many       deaths, especially of females, must have been concealed from       the authorities; I have, however, made an average from the       totals, and applied the rate of mortality thus obtained to       ancient Thebes. The same result follows from calculations       based on more recent figures, obtained before the great       hygienic changes introduced into Cairo by Ismail Pacha, i.e.       from August 1, 1858, to July 31, 1859, and from May 24,       1865, to May 16, 1866, and for the two years from April 2,       1869, to March 21, 1870, and from April 2, 1870, to March       21, 1871.    Each of the corpses,moreover, necessitated the employment of at least  half a dozen workmen to wash it, cut it open, soak it, dry it, and  apply the usual bandages before placing the amulets upon the canonically  prescribed places, and using the conventional prayers.    [Illustration: 007.jpg HEAD OF A THEBAN MUMMY]         Drawn by Boudier, from a photograph by Emil Brugsch-Bey.    There was fastened to the breast, immediately below the neck, a stone  or green porcelain scarab, containing an inscription which was to be  efficacious in preventing the heart, \"his heart which came to him from  his mother, his heart from the time he was upon the earth,\" from rising  up and witnessing against the dead man before the tribunal of Osiris.*  There were placed on his fingers gold or enamelled rings, as talismans  to secure for him the true voice.**         * The manipulations and prayers were prescribed in the \"Book       of Embalming.\"         ** The prescribed gold ring was often replaced by one of       blue or green enamel.    The body becomes at last little more than a skeleton, with a covering of  yellow skin which accentuates the anatomical, details, but the head, on  the other hand, still preserves, where the operations have been properly  conducted, its natural form. The cheeks have fallen in slightly, the  lips and the fleshy parts of the nose have become thinner and more  drawn than during life, but the general expression of the face remains  unaltered.    [Illustration: 008.jpg THE MANUFACTURE AND PAINTING OF THE CARTONNAGE]         Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, after Rosellini.    A mask of pitch was placed over the visage to preserve it, above  which was adjusted first a piece of linen and then a series of bands  impregnated with resin, which increased the size of the head to twofold  its ordinary bulk. The trunk and limbs were bound round with a first  covering of some pliable soft stuff, warm to the touch. Coarsely  powdered natron was scattered here and there over the body as an  additional preservative. Packets placed between the legs, the arms and  the hips, and in the eviscerated abdomen, contained the heart, spleen,  the dried brain, the hair, and the cuttings of the beard and nails. In  those days the hair had a special magical virtue: by burning it while  uttering certain incantations, one might acquire an almost limitless  power over the person to whom it had belonged. The ernbalmers,  therefore, took care to place with the mummy such portions of the hair  as they had been obliged to cut off, so as to remove them out of the way  of the perverse ingenuity of the sorcerers.
