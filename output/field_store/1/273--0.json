PORT ELIZABETH. UITENHAGE.    JOHANNESBURG.    1922          _To    MY MOTHER_.          PREFACE.      The reader has a right to ask what qualification the writer may have for  dealing with the subject upon which he offers his opinions.    The author of this book claims the qualifications of an observer who,  during many years, has studied the ways and thoughts of the Natives of  South Africa on the spot, not through interpreters, but at first hand,  through the medium of their own speech, which he professes to know as  well as the Natives themselves.    P.N.          THE BLACK MAN'S PLACE IN SOUTH AFRICA.    THE QUESTION STATED.      The white man has taken up the burden of ruling his dark-skinned fellows  throughout the world, and in South Africa he has so far carried that  burden alone, feeling well assured of his fitness for the task. He has  seen before him a feeble folk, strong only in their numbers and fit only  for service, a people unworthy of sharing with his own race the  privileges of social and political life, and it has seemed right  therefore in his sight that this people should continue to bend under  his dominant will. But to-day the white man is being disturbed by signs  of coming strength among the black and thriving masses; signs of the  awakening of a consciousness of racial manhood that is beginning to find  voice in a demand for those rights of citizenship which hitherto have  been so easily withheld. The white people are beginning to ask  themselves whether they shall sit still and wait till that voice becomes  clamant and insistent throughout the land or whether they shall begin  now to think out and provide means for dealing with those coming events  whose shadows are already falling athwart the immediate outlook. The  strong and solid feeling among the whites in the past against giving any  political rights to the blacks however civilised they might be is not so  strong or as solid as it was. The number is growing of those among the  ruling race who feel that the right of representation should here also  follow the burden of taxation, but while there are many who think thus,  those who try to think the matter out in all its bearings soon come to  apprehend the possibility that where once political equality has been  granted social equality may follow, and this apprehension makes the  thinking man pause to think again before he commits himself to a  definite and settled opinion.    Taking the civilisation of to-day to mean an ordered and advanced state  of society in which all men are equally bound and entitled to share the  burdens and privileges of the whole political and social life according  to their individual limitations we ask whether the African Natives are  capable of acquiring this civilisation, and whether, if it be proved  that their capacity for progress is equal to that of the Europeans, the  demand for full racial equality that must inevitably follow can in  fairness be denied. This I take to be the crux of the Native Question in  South Africa.    Before we attempt to answer this question it is necessary to find out,  if we can, in what ways the African differs from the European; for if it  be found that there are radical and inherent differences between the two  races of a kind that seem certain to remain unaltered by new influences  and changed environment then the whites will feel justified in denying  equality where nature herself has made it impossible, whereas if the  existing difference be proved to be only outwardly acquired and not  inwardly heritable then the coming demand for equality will stand  supported by natural right which may not be ignored. The question, then,  before us is this. Is the African Native equal to the European in mental  and moral capacity or is he not? We must have an answer to this  question, for we cannot assign to the Native his proper place in the  general scheme of our civilisation till we know exactly what manner of  man he is.    We of to-day are rightly proud of our freedom from the sour  superstitions and religious animosities of the past, but these  hindrances to progress and general happiness were only dispelled by the  light of scientific thought and clear reasoning. Let us then bring to  bear that same blessed light upon our present enquiry into the reasons,  real or fancied, for those prejudices of race and colour which we still  retain, for it is only by removing the misconceptions and false notions  that obscure our view that we can come to a clear understanding of the  many complex issues that make up the great Native problem of Africa.      BODILY DIFFERENCES.    \"That which distinguishes man from the beast,\" said Beaumarchais, \"is  drinking without being thirsty, and making love at all seasons,\" and he  spoke perhaps truer than he knew, for the fact that man is not bound by  seasons and is not in entire subjection to his environment is the  cardinal distinction between him and the brutes. This distinction was  won through man's possession of a thinking brain which caused or  coincided with an upright carriage whereby his two hands were set free  from the lowly service of mere locomotion to make fire and to fashion  the tools wherewith he was enabled to control his environment instead of  remaining like the animals entirely controlled by it. This wonderful  brain also made possible the communication and tradition of his  experiences and ideas through articulate speech by which means his  successors in each generation were able to keep and develop the slowly  spelt lessons of human life.    Are the African Natives as far removed from the beasts as the Europeans,  and do they share equally with the Europeans this great human  distinction of ability to think?    The belief, at, one time commonly held, that in morphological  development and physical appearance the Bantu stand nearer in the scale  of evolution to our common ape-like ancestors than do the white people  does not seem to be warranted by facts. Careful investigations by  trained observers all over the world have shown that the various simian  features discernible in the anatomy of modern man are found fairly  evenly distributed amongst advanced and backward races.    The so-called prognathism of the Bantu has been cited as a racial mark  denoting comparative nearness to the brutes, but when it is noted that  anthropologists differ among themselves as to what constitutes this  feature, whether it is to be measured from points above or below the  nose or both, and when we are informed in some text books that while the  negroes are prognathous, bushmen must be classed with Europeans as being  the opposite, that is, orthognathous,[1] and when, added to this, we  learn from other quarters that white women are, on the average, more  prognathous than white men,[2] then the significance of this  distinction, which in any case is not regarded as being relative to  cranical capacity, is seen to be more apparent than real.    Extreme hairiness of body, on the other hand, which might well be taken  as a simian or vestigial character, is seldom met with in the Bantu, but  is equally common among Europeans and Australian aboriginals and is  found particularly developed in the Ainu of Japan. The texture also of  the African's hair is less like that of the hair of the man-like apes  than is the hair of the European. The proportions of the limbs of the  Europeans seem, on the average, to be nearer to the supposed prototype  of man than those of the Bantu. The specifically human development of  the red lips is more pronounced in the African than in the European,[3]  and if there is anything in what has been called the \"god-like erectness  of the human carriage\" then it must be admitted that the Bantu women  exhibit a straightness of form which may well be envied by the ladies of  civilisation.    It is generally accepted that the African Natives have a bodily odour of  their own which is _sui generis_ in that it is supposed to be different  from that of other human races. Some early travellers have compared it  with the smell of the female crocodile, and many people believe it to be  a racial characteristic denoting a comparatively humble origin and  intended by nature as a signal or warning for the rest of human kind  against close physical contact with the African race. A recent student  of the Negro question in America gives it as his opinion that this odour  is \"something which the Negroes will have difficulty in living down.\"[4]  To most Europeans this smell seems to be more or less unpleasant but it  must not be forgotten that it does not seem to affect the large numbers  of white men of all nationalities who have found and still find pleasure  in continued and intimate intercourse with African women. It would seem  as if highly \"refined\" Europeans are nowadays given to exaggerate the  sensation produced on their over delicate olfactory nerves by the  exhalations caused by perspiration through a healthy and porous skin. In  many of the so-called Ladies' Journals published in England and America  advertisements appear regularly vaunting chemical preparations for the  disguising of the odour of perspiration which, it is alleged, mars the  attractiveness of women. If this is so it would seem that the nostrils  of the modern European are rather too easily offended by the natural  smell of his kind. However this may be there is no evidence for  believing that the African's bodily smell is more animal-like than that  of any other race.    If there is one thing which the white man of South Africa is sure about  it is the comparative thickness of the \"nigger skull,\" but this notion  also would appear to be one of the many which have no foundation in  fact.    The opinion of medical men, based upon actual observation and  measurement, is to the effect that there is no evidence to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14909"],[0,"Elsie's New Relations (#1)"],[1,"Distributed Proofreading Team (www.pgdp.net)        ELSIE'S NEW RELATIONS    What They Did and How They Fared at Ion    A Sequel to _Grandmother Elsie_    by    MARTHA FINLEY    A. L. Burt Company  Publishers  New York Chicago    1911                CHAPTER I.        \"For wild, or calm, or far or near,       I love thee still, thou glorious sea.\"                        --Mrs. Hemans.        \"I bless thee for kind looks and words        Shower'd on my path like dew,       For all the love in those deep eyes,        A gladness ever new.\"                        --Mrs. Hemans.      It is late in the afternoon of a delicious October day; the woods back of  the two cottages where the Dinsmores, Travillas and Raymonds have spent  the last three or four months are gorgeous with scarlet, crimson and gold;  the air from the sea is more delightful than ever, but the summer visitors  to the neighboring cottages and hotels have fled, and the beach is almost  deserted, as Edward and his child-wife wander slowly along it, hand in  hand, their attention divided between the splendors of a magnificent  sunset and the changing beauty of the sea; yonder away in the distance it  is pale gray; near at hand delicate green slowly changing to pink, each  wave crested with snowy foam, and anon they all turn to burnished gold.    \"Oh, how very beautiful!\" cries Zoe, in an ecstasy of delight. \"Edward,  did you ever see anything finer?\"    \"Never! Let us go down this flight of steps and seat ourselves on the next  to the lowest. We will then be quite near the waves and yet out of danger  of being wet by them.\"    He led her down as he spoke, seated her comfortably and himself by her  side with his arm around her.    \"I've grown very fond of the sea,\" she remarked. \"I shall be sorry to  leave it. Will not you?\"    \"Yes and no,\" he answered, doubtfully. \"I, too, am fond of old ocean, but  eager to get to Ion and begin life in earnest. Isn't it time, seeing I  have been a married man for nearly five months? But why that sigh, love?\"    \"O Edward, are you not sorry you are married? Are you not sometimes very  much ashamed of me?\" she asked, her cheek burning hotly and the downcast  eyes filling with tears.    \"Ashamed of you, Zoe? Why, darling, you are my heart's best treasure,\" he  said, drawing her closer to his side, and touching his lips to her  forehead. \"What has put so absurd an idea into your head?\"    \"I know so little, so very little compared with your mother and sisters,\"  she sighed. \"I'm finding it out more and more every day, as I hear them  talk among themselves and to other people.\"    \"But you are younger than any of them, a very great deal younger than  mamma, and will have time to catch up to them.\"    \"But I'm a married woman and so can't go to school any more. Ah,\" with  another and very heavy sigh, \"I wish papa hadn't been quite so indulgent,  or that I'd had sense enough not to take advantage of it to the neglect of  my studies!\"    \"No, I suppose it would hardly do to send you to school, even if I could  spare you--which I can't,\" he returned laughingly, \"but there is a  possibility of studying at home, under a governess or tutor. What do you  say to offering yourself as a pupil to grandpa?\"    \"Oh, no, no! I'm sure he can be very stern upon occasion. I've seen it in  his eyes when I've made a foolish remark that he didn't approve, and I  should be too frightened to learn if he were my teacher.\"    \"Then some one else must be thought of,\" Edward said, with a look of  amusement. \"How would I answer?\"    \"You? Oh, splendidly!\"    \"You are not afraid of me?\"    \"No, indeed!\" she cried, with a merry laugh and a saucy look up into his  face.    \"And yet I'm the only person who has authority over you.\"    \"Authority, indeed!\" with a little contemptuous sniff.    \"You promised to obey, you know.\"    \"Did I? Well, maybe so, but that's just a form that doesn't really mean  anything. Most any married woman will tell you that.\"    \"Do you consider the whole of your marriage vow an unmeaning form, Zoe?\"  he asked, with sudden gravity and a look of doubt and pain in his eyes  that she could not bear to see.    \"No, no! I was only in jest,\" she said, dropping her eyes and blushing  deeply. \"But really, Edward, you don't think, do you, that wives are to  obey like children?\"    \"No, love, I don't; and I think in a true marriage the two are so entirely  one--so unselfishly desirous each to please the other--that there is  little or no clashing of wills. Thus far ours has seemed such to me. How  is it, do you think, little wife?\"    \"I hope so, Edward,\" she said, laying her head on his shoulder, \"I know  one thing--that there is nothing in this world I care so much for as to  please you and be all and everything to you.\"    \"And I can echo your words from my very heart, dearest,\" he said,  caressing her. \"I hope you are at home and happy among your new  relatives.\"    \"Yes, indeed, Edward, especially with mamma. She is the dearest, kindest  mother in the world; to me as much as to her own children, and oh, so wise  and good!\"    \"You are not sorry now that you and I are not to live alone?\" he queried,  with a pleased smile.    \"No, oh, no! I'm ever so glad that she is to keep house at Ion and all of  us to live together as one family.\"    \"Except Lester and Elsie,\" he corrected; \"they will be with us for a short  time, then go to Fairview for the winter. And it will probably become  their home after that, as mamma will buy it, if Mr. Leland--Lester's  uncle, who owns the place--carries out his intention of removing to  California. His children have settled there, and, of course, the father  and mother want to be with them.\"    The sun had set, and all the bright hues had faded from the sea, leaving  it a dull gray.    \"What a deserted spot this seems!\" remarked Zoe, \"and only the other day  it was gay with crowds of people. Nobody to be seen now but ourselves,\"  glancing up and down the coast as she spoke. \"Ah, yes! yonder is someone  sitting on that piece of wreck.\"    \"It is Lulu Raymond,\" Edward said, following the direction of her glance.  \"It is late for the child to be out so far from home; a full mile I should  say. I'll go and invite her to walk back with us.\"    \"No, you needn't,\" said Zoe, \"for see, there is her father going to her.  But let us go home, for I must change my dress before tea.\"    \"And we want time to walk leisurely along,\" returned Edward, rising and  giving her his hand to help her up the steps.    Lulu was reading, so absorbed in the story that she did not perceive her  father's approach, and as he accosted her with, \"It is late for you to be  here alone, my child, you should have come in an hour ago,\" she gave a  great start, and involuntarily tried to hide her book.    \"What have you there? Evidently something you do not wish your father to  see,\" he said, bending down and taking it from her unwilling hand.    \"Ah, I don't wonder!\" as he hurriedly turned over a few pages. \"A dime  novel! Where did you get this, Lulu?\"    \"It's Max's, papa, he lent it to me. O papa, what made you do that?\" as  with an energetic fling the captain suddenly sent it far out into the sea.  \"Max made me promise to take care of it and give it back to him, and  besides I wanted to finish the story.\"    \"Neither you nor Max shall ever read such poisonous stuff as that with my  knowledge and consent,\" replied the captain in stern accents.    \"Papa, I didn't think you'd be so unkind,\" grumbled Lulu, her face  expressing extreme vexation and disappointment, \"or that you would throw  away other people's things.\"    \"Unkind, my child?\" he said, sitting down beside her and taking her hand  in his. \"Suppose you had gathered a quantity of beautiful, sweet-tasted  berries that I knew to be poisonous, and were about to eat them; would it  be unkind in me to snatch them out of your hand and throw them into the  sea?\"    \"No, sir; because it would kill me to eat them, but that book couldn't  kill me, or even make me sick.\"    \"No, not your body, but it would injure your soul, which is worth far  more. I'm afraid I have been too negligent in regard to the mental food of  my children,\" he went on after a slight pause, rather as if thinking aloud  than talking to Lulu, \"and unfortunately I cannot take the oversight of it  constantly in the future. But remember, Lulu,\" he added firmly, \"I wholly  forbid dime novels, and you are not to read anything without first  obtaining the approval of your father or one of those under whose  authority he has placed you.\"    Lulu's face was full of sullen discontent and anger. \"Papa,\" she said, \"I  don't like to obey those people.\"    \"If you are wise, you will try to like what has to be,\" he said.    \"It wouldn't have to be if you would only say I needn't, papa.\"    \"I shall not say that, Lucilla,\" he answered with grave displeasure. \"You  need guidance and control even more than most children of your age, and I  should not be doing my duty if I left you without them.\"    \"I don't like to obey people that are no relation to me!\" she cried,  viciously kicking away a little heap of sand.    \"No, you don't even like to obey your father,\" he said with a sigh. \"Max  and Gracie together do not give me half the anxiety that you do by your  wilful temper.\"    \"Why, can't I do as I please as well as grown people?\" she asked in a more  subdued tone.    \"Even grown people have to obey,\" said her father. \"I am now expecting  orders from the government, and must obey them when they come. I must obey  my superior officers, and the officers and men under me must obey me. So  must my children. God gave you to me and requires me to train you up in  His fear and service to the best of my ability. I should not be doing that  if I allowed you to read such hurtful trash as that I just took from  you.\"    \"It was Max's, papa, and I promised to give it back. What shall I say when  he asks me for it?\"    \"Tell him to come to"]]]
