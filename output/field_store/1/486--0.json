I'll find a few coppers somewhere,\" replied  the boy, trying to speak cheerfully, although in his heart he also had  not the slightest idea in which direction to turn.    The winter had been a hard one: extreme cold, deep snow, and violent  winds. The Wang house had suffered greatly. The roof had fallen in,  weighed down by heavy snow. Then a hurricane had blown a wall over, and  Ming-li, the son, up all night and exposed to a bitter cold wind, had  caught pneumonia. Long days of illness followed, with the spending of  extra money for medicine. All their scant savings had soon melted away,  and at the shop where Ming-li had been employed his place was filled by  another. When at last he arose from his sick-bed he was too weak for  hard labour and there seemed to be no work in the neighbouring villages  for him to do. Night after night he came home, trying not to be  discouraged, but in his heart feeling the deep pangs of sorrow that come  to the good son who sees his mother suffering for want of food and  clothing.    \"Bless his good heart!\" said the poor widow after he had gone. \"No  mother ever had a better boy. I hope he is right in saying the gods will  provide. It has been getting so much worse these past few weeks that it  seems now as if my stomach were as empty as a rich man's brain. Why,  even the rats have deserted our cottage, and there's nothing left for  poor Tabby, while old Blackfoot is nearly dead from starvation.\"    When the old woman referred to the sorrows of her pets, her  remarks were answered by a pitiful mewing and woebegone barking  from the corner where the two unfed creatures were curled up together  trying to keep warm.    Just then there was a loud knocking at the gate. When the widow Wang  called out, \"Come in!\" she was surprised to see an old bald-headed  priest standing in the doorway. \"Sorry, but we have nothing,\" she went  on, feeling sure the visitor had come in search of food. \"We have fed on  scraps these two weeks--on scraps and scrapings--and now we are living  on the memories of what we used to have when my son's father was living.  Our cat was so fat she couldn't climb to the roof. Now look at her. You  can hardly see her, she's so thin. No, I'm sorry we can't help you,  friend priest, but you see how it is.\"    \"I didn't come for alms,\" cried the clean-shaven one, looking at her  kindly, \"but only to see what I could do to help you. The gods have  listened long to the prayers of your devoted son. They honour him  because he has not waited till you die to do sacrifice for you. They  have seen how faithfully he has served you ever since his illness, and  now, when he is worn out and unable to work, they are resolved to reward  him for his virtue. You likewise have been a good mother and shall  receive the gift I am now bringing.\"    \"What do you mean?\" faltered Mrs. Wang, hardly believing her ears at  hearing a priest speak of bestowing mercies. \"Have you come here to  laugh at our misfortunes?\"    \"By no means. Here in my hand I hold a tiny golden beetle which you will  find has a magic power greater than any you ever dreamed of. I will  leave this precious thing with you, a present from the god of filial  conduct.\"    \"Yes, it will sell for a good sum,\" murmured the other, looking closely  at the trinket, \"and will give us millet for several days. Thanks, good  priest, for your kindness.\"    \"But you must by no means sell this golden beetle, for it has the power  to fill your stomachs as long as you live.\"    The widow stared in open-mouthed wonder at the priest's surprising  words.    \"Yes, you must not doubt me, but listen carefully to what I tell you.  Whenever you wish food, you have only to place this ornament in a kettle  of boiling water, saying over and over again the names of what you want  to eat. In three minutes take off the lid, and there will be your  dinner, smoking hot, and cooked more perfectly than any food you have  ever eaten.\"    \"May I try it now?\" she asked eagerly.    \"As soon as I am gone.\"    When the door was shut, the old woman hurriedly kindled a fire, boiled  some water, and then dropped in the golden beetle, repeating these words  again and again:        \"Dumplings, dumplings, come to me,     I am thin as thin can be.     Dumplings, dumplings, smoking hot,     Dumplings, dumplings, fill the pot.\"      Would those three minutes never pass? Could the priest have told the  truth? Her old head was nearly wild with excitement as clouds of steam  rose from the kettle. Off came the lid! She could wait no longer. Wonder  of wonders! There before her unbelieving eyes was a pot, full to the  brim of pork dumplings, dancing up and down in the bubbling water, the  best, the most delicious dumplings she had ever tasted. She ate and ate  till there was no room left in her greedy stomach, and then she feasted  the cat and the dog until they were ready to burst.    \"Good fortune has come at last,\" whispered Blackfoot, the dog, to  Whitehead, the cat, as they lay down to sun themselves outside. \"I fear  I couldn't have held out another week without running away to look for  food. I don't know just what's happened, but there's no use questioning  the gods.\"    Mrs. Wang fairly danced for joy at the thought of her son's return and  of how she would feast him.    \"Poor boy, how surprised he will be at our fortune--and it's all on  account of his goodness to his old mother.\"    When Ming-li came, with a dark cloud overhanging his brow, the widow saw  plainly that disappointment was written there.    \"Come, come, lad!\" she cried cheerily, \"clear up your face and smile,  for the gods have been good to us and I shall soon show you how richly  your devotion has been rewarded.\" So saying, she dropped the golden  beetle into the boiling water and stirred up the fire.    Thinking his mother had gone stark mad for want of food, Ming-li stared  solemnly at her. Anything was preferable to this misery. Should he sell  his last outer garment for a few pennies and buy millet for her?  Blackfoot licked his hand comfortingly, as if to say, \"Cheer up, master,  fortune has turned in our favour.\" Whitehead leaped upon a bench,  purring like a sawmill.    Ming-li did not have long to wait. Almost in the twinkling of an eye he  heard his mother crying out,    \"Sit down at the table, son, and eat these dumplings while they are  smoking hot.\"    Could he have heard correctly? Did his ears deceive him? No, there on  the table was a huge platter full of the delicious pork dumplings he  liked better than anything else in all the world, except, of course, his  mother.

CAYLEY'S APOLOGY    XXII. MR. BEVERLEY MOVES ON          CHAPTER I. Mrs. Stevens is Frightened      In the drowsy heat of the summer afternoon the Red House was taking its  siesta. There was a lazy murmur of bees in the flower-borders, a gentle  cooing of pigeons in the tops of the elms. From distant lawns came  the whir of a mowing-machine, that most restful of all country sounds;  making ease the sweeter in that it is taken while others are working.    It was the hour when even those whose business it is to attend to  the wants of others have a moment or two for themselves. In the  housekeeper's room Audrey Stevens, the pretty parlour-maid, re-trimmed  her best hat, and talked idly to her aunt, the cook-housekeeper of Mr.  Mark Ablett's bachelor home.    \"For Joe?\" said Mrs. Stevens placidly, her eye on the hat. Audrey  nodded. She took a pin from her mouth, found a place in the hat for it,  and said, \"He likes a bit of pink.\"    \"I don't say I mind a bit of pink myself,\" said her aunt. \"Joe Turner  isn't the only one.\"    \"It isn't everybody's colour,\" said Audrey, holding the hat out at arm's  length, and regarding it thoughtfully. \"Stylish, isn't it?\"    \"Oh, it'll suit you all right, and it would have suited me at your  age. A bit too dressy for me now, though wearing better than some other  people, I daresay. I was never the one to pretend to be what I wasn't.  If I'm fifty-five, I'm fifty-five--that's what I say.\"    \"Fifty-eight, isn't it, auntie?\"    \"I was just giving that as an example,\" said Mrs. Stevens with great  dignity.    Audrey threaded a needle, held her hand out and looked at her nails  critically for a moment, and then began to sew.    \"Funny thing that about Mr. Mark's brother. Fancy not seeing your  brother for fifteen years.\" She gave a self-conscious laugh and went on,  \"Wonder what I should do if I didn't see Joe for fifteen years.\"    \"As I told you all this morning,\" said her aunt, \"I've been here five  years, and never heard of a brother. I could say that before everybody  if I was going to die to-morrow. There's been no brother here while I've  been here.\"    \"You could have knocked me down with a feather when he spoke about him  at breakfast this morning. I didn't hear what went before, naturally,  but they was all talking about the brother when I went in--now what  was it I went in for--hot milk, was it, or toast?--well, they was  all talking, and Mr. Mark turns to me, and says--you know his  way--'Stevens,' he says, 'my brother is coming to see me this afternoon;  I'm expecting him about three,' he says. 'Show him into the office,' he  says, just like that. 'Yes, sir,' I says quite quietly, but I was never  so surprised in my life, not knowing he had a brother. 'My brother from  Australia,' he says--there, I'd forgotten that. From Australia.\"    \"Well, he may have been in Australia,\" said Mrs. Stevens, judicially; \"I  can't say for that, not knowing the country; but what I do say is he's  never been here. Not while I've been here, and that's five years.\"    \"Well, but, auntie, he hasn't been here for fifteen years. I heard Mr.  Mark telling Mr. Cayley. 'Fifteen years,' he says. Mr. Cayley having  arst him when his brother was last in England. Mr. Cayley knew of him,  I heard him telling Mr. Beverley, but didn't know when he was last in  England--see? So that's why he arst Mr. Mark.\"    \"I'm not saying anything about fifteen years, Audrey. I can only speak  for what I know, and that's five years Whitsuntide. I can take my oath  he's not set foot in the house since five years Whitsuntide. And if he's  been in Australia, as you say, well, I daresay he's had his reasons.\"    \"What reasons?\" said Audrey lightly.    \"Never mind what reasons. Being in the place of a mother to you, since  your poor mother died, I say this, Audrey--when a gentleman goes to  Australia, he has his reasons. And when he stays in Australia fifteen  years, as Mr. Mark says, and as I know for myself for five years, he  has his reasons. And a respectably brought-up girl doesn't ask what  reasons.\"    \"Got into trouble, I suppose,\" said Audrey carelessly. \"They were saying  at breakfast he'd been a wild one. Debts. I'm glad Joe isn't like that.  He's got fifteen pounds in the post-office savings' bank. Did I tell  you?\"    But there was not to be any more talk of Joe Turner that afternoon. The  ringing of a bell brought Audrey to her feet--no longer Audrey, but now  Stevens. She arranged her cap in front of the glass.    \"There, that's the front door,\" she said. \"That's him. 'Show him into  the office,' said Mr. Mark. I suppose he doesn't want the other  ladies and gentlemen to see him. Well, they're all out at their golf,  anyhow--Wonder if he's going to stay--P'raps he's brought back a lot of  gold from Australia--I might hear something about Australia, because if  anybody can get gold there, then I don't say but what Joe and I--\"    \"Now, now, get on, Audrey.\"    \"Just going, darling.\" She went out.    To anyone who had just walked down the drive in the August sun, the open  door of the Red House revealed a delightfully inviting hall, of which  even the mere sight was cooling. It was a big low-roofed,  oak-beamed place, with cream-washed walls and diamond-paned windows,  blue-curtained. On the right and left were doors leading into other  living-rooms, but on the side which faced you as you came in were  windows again, looking on to a small grass court, and from open windows  to open windows such air as there was played gently. The staircase went  up in broad, low steps along the right-hand wall, and, turning to the  left, led you along a gallery, which ran across the width of the hall,  to your bedroom. That is, if you were going to stay the night. Mr.  Robert Ablett's intentions in this matter were as yet unknown.    As Audrey came across the hall she gave a little start as she saw Mr.  Cayley suddenly, sitting unobtrusively in a seat beneath one of the  front windows, reading. No reason why he shouldn't be there; certainly  a much cooler place than the golf-links on such a day; but somehow there  was a deserted air about the house that afternoon, as if all the guests  were outside, or--perhaps the wisest place of all--up in their bedrooms,  sleeping. Mr. Cayley, the master's cousin, was a surprise; and, having  given a little exclamation as she came suddenly upon him, she blushed,  and said, \"Oh, I beg your pardon, sir, I didn't see you at first,\" and  he looked up from his book and smiled at her. An attractive smile it was  on that big ugly face. \"Such a gentleman, Mr. Cayley,\" she thought to  herself as she went on, and wondered what the master would do without  him. If this brother, for instance, had to be bundled back to Australia,  it was Mr. Cayley who would do most of the bundling.    \"So this is Mr. Robert,\" said Audrey to herself, as she came in sight of  the visitor.    She told her aunt afterwards that she would have known him anywhere for  Mr. Mark's brother, but she would have said that in any event. Actually  she was surprised. Dapper little Mark, with his neat pointed beard and  his carefully curled moustache; with his quick-darting eyes, always  moving from one to the other of any company he was in, to register  one more smile to his credit when he had said a good thing, one more  expectant look when he was only waiting his turn to say it; he was  a very different man from this rough-looking, ill-dressed colonial,  staring at her so loweringly.    \"I want to see Mr. Mark Ablett,\" he growled. It sounded almost like a  threat.    Audrey recovered herself and smiled reassuringly at him. She had a smile  for everybody.    \"Yes, sir. He is expecting you, if you will come this way.\"    \"Oh! So you know who I am, eh?\"    \"Mr. Robert Ablett?\"    \"Ay, that's right. So he's expecting me, eh? He'll be glad to see me,  eh?\"    \"If you will come this way, sir,\" said Audrey primly.    She went to the second door on the left, and opened it.    \"Mr. Robert Ab--\" she began, and then broke off. The room was empty. She  turned to the man behind her. \"If you will sit down, sir, I will find  the master. I know he's in, because he told me that you were coming this  afternoon.\"    \"Oh!\" He looked round the room. \"What d'you call this place, eh?\"    \"The office, sir.\"    \"The office?\"    \"The room where the master works, sir.\"    \"Works, eh? That's new. Didn't know he'd ever done a stroke of work in  his life.\"    \"Where he writes, sir,\" said Audrey, with dignity. The fact that Mr.  Mark \"wrote,\" though nobody knew what, was a matter of pride in the  housekeeper's room.    \"Not well-dressed enough for the drawing-room, eh?\"    \"I will tell the master you are here, sir,\" said Audrey decisively.    She closed the door and left him there.    Well! Here was something to tell"]]]
