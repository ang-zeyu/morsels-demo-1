His father, Josiah Franklin, was a tallow chandler who married twice,  and of his seventeen children Benjamin was the youngest son.  His  schooling ended at ten, and at twelve he was bound apprentice to his  brother James, a printer, who published the \"New England Courant.\" To  this journal he became a contributor, and later was for a time its  nominal editor. But the brothers quarreled, and Benjamin ran away,  going first to New York, and thence to Philadelphia, where he arrived  in October, 1723.  He soon obtained work as a printer, but after a few  months he was induced by Governor Keith to go to London, where, finding  Keith's promises empty, he again worked as a compositor till he was  brought back to Philadelphia by a merchant named  Denman, who gave him  a position in his business. On Denman's death he returned to his former  trade, and shortly set up a printing house of his own from which he  published \"The Pennsylvania Gazette,\" to which he contributed many  essays, and which he made a medium for agitating a variety of local  reforms. In 1732 he began to issue his famous \"Poor Richard's Almanac\"  for the enrichment of which he borrowed or composed those pithy  utterances of worldly wisdom which are the basis of a large part of his  popular reputation.  In 1758, the year in which he ceases writing for  the Almanac, he printed in it \"Father Abraham's Sermon,\" now regarded  as the most famous piece of literature produced in Colonial America.    Meantime Franklin was concerning himself more and more with public  affairs.  He set forth a scheme for an Academy, which was taken up  later and finally developed into the University of Pennsylvania; and he  founded an \"American Philosophical Society\" for the purpose of enabling  scientific  men to communicate their discoveries to one another.  He  himself had already begun his electrical researches, which, with other  scientific inquiries, he called on in the intervals of money-making and  politics to the end of his life.  In 1748 he sold his business in order  to get leisure for study, having now acquired comparative wealth; and  in a few years he had made discoveries that gave him a reputation with  the learned throughout Europe.  In politics he proved very able both as  an administrator and as a controversialist; but his record as an  office-holder is stained by the use he made of his position to advance  his relatives.  His most notable service in home politics was his  reform of the postal system; but his fame as a statesman rests chiefly  on his services in connection with the relations of the Colonies with  Great Britain, and later with France.  In 1757 he was sent to England  to protest against the influence of the Penns in the government of the  colony, and for five years he remained there, striving to enlighten the  people and the ministry of England as to Colonial conditions.  On his  return to America he played an honorable part in the Paxton affair,  through which he lost his seat in the Assembly; but in 1764 he was  again despatched to England as agent for the colony, this time to  petition the King to resume the government from the hands of the  proprietors.  In London he actively opposed the proposed Stamp Act, but  lost the credit for this and much of his popularity through his  securing for a friend the office of stamp agent in America.  Even his  effective work in helping to obtain the repeal of the act left him  still a suspect; but he continued his efforts to present the case for  the Colonies as the troubles thickened toward the crisis of the  Revolution.  In 1767 he crossed to France, where he was received with  honor; but before his return home in 1775 he lost his position as  postmaster through his share in divulging to Massachusetts the famous  letter of Hutchinson and Oliver.  On his arrival in Philadelphia he was  chosen a member of the Continental Congress and in 1777 he was  despatched to France as commissioner for the United States.  Here he  remained till 1785, the favorite of French society; and with such  success did he conduct the affairs of his country that when he finally  returned he received a place only second to that of Washington as the  champion of American independence.  He died on April 17, 1790.    The first five chapters of the Autobiography were composed in England  in 1771, continued in 1784-5, and again in 1788, at which date he  brought it down to 1757.  After a most extraordinary series of  adventures, the original form of the manuscript was finally printed by  Mr. John Bigelow, and is here reproduced in recognition of its value as  a picture of one of the most notable personalities of Colonial times,  and of its acknowledged rank as one of the great autobiographies of the  world.            BENJAMIN FRANKLIN    HIS AUTOBIOGRAPHY      1706-1757        TWYFORD, at the Bishop of St. Asaph's,[0]  1771.         [0] The country-seat of Bishop Shipley, the good bishop,           as Dr. Franklin used to style him.--B.    DEAR SON:  I have ever had pleasure in obtaining any little anecdotes  of my ancestors.  You may remember the inquiries I made among the  remains of my relations when you were with me in England, and the  journey I undertook for that purpose.  Imagining it may be equally  agreeable to[1] you to know the circumstances of my life, many of which  you are yet unacquainted with, and expecting the enjoyment of a week's  uninterrupted leisure in my present country retirement, I sit down to  write them for you.  To which I have besides some other inducements.  Having emerged from the poverty and obscurity in which I was born and  bred, to a state of affluence and some degree of reputation in the  world, and having gone so far through life with a considerable share of  felicity, the conducing means I made use of, which with the blessing of  God so well succeeded, my posterity may like to know, as they may find  some of them suitable to their own situations, and therefore fit to be  imitated.         [1] After the words \"agreeable to\" the words \"some of\" were           interlined and afterward effaced.--B.    That felicity, when I reflected on it, has induced me sometimes to say,  that were it offered to my choice, I should have no objection to a  repetition of the same life from its beginning, only asking the  advantages authors have in a second edition to correct some faults of  the first.  So I might, besides correcting the faults, change some  sinister accidents and events of it for others more favorable.  But  though this were denied, I should still accept the offer.  Since such a  repetition is not to be expected, the next thing most like living one's  life over again seems to be a recollection of that life, and to make  that recollection as durable as possible by putting it down in writing.    Hereby, too, I shall indulge the inclination so natural in old men, to  be talking of themselves and their own past actions; and I shall  indulge it without being tiresome to others, who, through respect to  age, might conceive themselves obliged to give me a hearing, since this  may be read or not as any one pleases.  And, lastly (I may as well  confess it, since my denial of it will be believed by nobody), perhaps  I shall a good deal gratify my own vanity.  Indeed, I scarce ever heard  or saw the introductory words, \"Without vanity I may say,\" &c., but  some vain thing immediately followed.  Most people dislike vanity in  others, whatever share they have of it themselves; but I give it fair  quarter wherever I meet with it, being persuaded that it is often  productive of good to the possessor, and to others that are within his  sphere of action; and therefore, in many cases, it would not be  altogether absurd if a man were to thank God for his vanity among the  other comforts of life.    And now I speak of thanking God, I desire with all humility to  acknowledge that I owe the mentioned happiness of my past life to His  kind providence, which lead me to the means I used and gave them  success.  My belief of this induces me to hope, though I must not  presume, that the same goodness will still be exercised toward me, in  continuing that happiness, or enabling me to bear a fatal reverse,  which I may experience as others have done:  the complexion of my  future fortune being known to Him only in whose power it is to bless to  us even our afflictions.    The notes one of my uncles (who had the same kind of curiosity in  collecting family anecdotes) once put into my hands, furnished me with  several particulars relating to our ancestors.  From these notes I  learned that the family had lived in the same village, Ecton, in  Northamptonshire, for three hundred years, and how much longer he knew  not (perhaps from the time when the name of Franklin, that before was  the name of an order of people, was assumed by them as a surname when  others took surnames all over the kingdom), on a freehold of about  thirty acres, aided by the smith's business, which had continued in the  family till his time, the eldest son being always bred to that  business; a custom which he and my father followed as to their eldest  sons.  When I searched the registers at Ecton, I found an account of  their births, marriages and burials from the year 1555 only, there  being no registers kept in that parish at any time preceding.  By that  register I perceived that I was the youngest son of the youngest son  for five generations back.  My grandfather Thomas, who was born in  1598, lived at Ecton till he grew too old to follow business longer,  when he went to live with his son John, a dyer at Banbury, in  Oxfordshire, with whom my father served an apprenticeship.

CHAPTER I--THE BROWN FAMILY         \"I'm the Poet of White Horse Vale, sir,       With liberal notions under my cap.\"--Ballad    The Browns have become illustrious by the pen of Thackeray and the  pencil of Doyle, within the memory of the young gentlemen who are now  matriculating at the universities. Notwithstanding the well-merited but  late fame which has now fallen upon them, any one at all acquainted with  the family must feel that much has yet to be written and said before the  British nation will be properly sensible of how much of its greatness it  owes to the Browns. For centuries, in their quiet, dogged, homespun way,  they have been subduing the earth in most English counties, and leaving  their mark in American forests and Australian uplands. Wherever the  fleets and armies of England have won renown, there stalwart sons of the  Browns have done yeomen's work. With the yew bow and cloth-yard shaft at  Cressy and Agincourt--with the brown bill and pike under the brave  Lord Willoughby--with culverin and demi-culverin against Spaniards and  Dutchmen--with hand-grenade and sabre, and musket and bayonet, under  Rodney and St. Vincent, Wolfe and Moore, Nelson and Wellington, they  have carried their lives in their hands, getting hard knocks and hard  work in plenty--which was on the whole what they looked for, and the  best thing for them--and little praise or pudding, which indeed they,  and most of us, are better without. Talbots and Stanleys, St. Maurs,  and such-like folk, have led armies and made laws time out of mind; but  those noble families would be somewhat astounded--if the accounts ever  came to be fairly taken--to find how small their work for England has  been by the side of that of the Browns.    These latter, indeed, have, until the present generation, rarely been  sung by poet, or chronicled by sage. They have wanted their sacer vates,  having been too solid to rise to the top by themselves, and not having  been largely gifted with the talent of catching hold of, and holding on  tight to, whatever good things happened to be going--the foundation of  the fortunes of so many noble families. But the world goes on its way,  and the wheel turns, and the wrongs of the Browns, like other wrongs,  seem in a fair way to get righted. And this present writer, having for  many years of his life been a devout Brown-worshipper, and, moreover,  having the honour of being nearly connected with an eminently  respectable branch of the great Brown family, is anxious, so far as in  him lies, to help the wheel over, and throw his stone on to the pile.    However, gentle reader, or simple reader, whichever you may be, lest you  should be led to waste your precious time upon these pages, I make so  bold as at once to tell you the sort of folk you'll have to meet and put  up with, if you and I are to jog on comfortably together. You shall hear  at once what sort of folk the Browns are--at least my branch of them;  and then, if you don't like the sort, why, cut the concern at once, and  let you and I cry quits before either of us can grumble at the other.    In the first place, the Browns are a fighting family. One may question  their wisdom, or wit, or beauty, but about their fight there can be no  question. Wherever hard knocks of any kind, visible or invisible, are  going; there the Brown who is nearest must shove in his carcass.  And these carcasses, for the most part, answer very well to the  characteristic propensity: they are a squareheaded and snake-necked  generation, broad in the shoulder, deep in the chest, and thin in  the flank, carrying no lumber. Then for clanship, they are as bad as  Highlanders; it is amazing the belief they have in one another.  With them there is nothing like the Browns, to the third and fourth  generation. \"Blood is thicker than water,\" is one of their pet sayings.  They can't be happy unless they are always meeting one another. Never  were such people for family gatherings; which, were you a stranger, or  sensitive, you might think had better not have been gathered together.  For during the whole time of their being together they luxuriate in  telling one another their minds on whatever subject turns up; and their  minds are wonderfully antagonistic, and all their opinions are downright  beliefs. Till you've been among them some time and understand them, you  can't think but that they are quarrelling. Not a bit of it. They love  and respect one another ten times the more after a good set family  arguing bout, and go back, one to his curacy, another to his chambers,  and another to his regiment, freshened for work, and more than ever  convinced that the Browns are the height of company.    This family training, too, combined with their turn for combativeness,  makes them eminently quixotic. They can't let anything alone which they  think going wrong. They must speak their mind about it, annoying all  easy-going folk, and spend their time and money in having a tinker at  it, however hopeless the job. It is an impossibility to a Brown to leave  the most disreputable lame dog on the other side of a stile. Most other  folk get tired of such work. The old Browns, with red faces, white  whiskers, and bald heads, go on believing and fighting to a green old  age. They have always a crotchet going, till the old man with the scythe  reaps and garners them away for troublesome old boys as they are.    And the most provoking thing is, that no failures knock them up, or make  them hold their hands, or think you, or me, or other sane people in  the right. Failures slide off them like July rain off a duck's back  feathers. Jem and his whole family turn out bad, and cheat them one  week, and the next they are doing the same thing for Jack; and when he  goes to the treadmill, and his wife and children to the workhouse, they  will be on the lookout for Bill to take his place.    However, it is time for us to get from the general to the particular;  so, leaving the great army of Browns, who are scattered over the whole  empire on which the sun never sets, and whose general diffusion I take  to be the chief cause of that empire's stability; let us at once fix our  attention upon the small nest of Browns in which our hero was hatched,  and which dwelt in that portion of the royal county of Berks which is  called the Vale of White Horse.    Most of you have probably travelled down the Great Western Railway as  far as Swindon. Those of you who did so with their eyes open have been  aware, soon after leaving the Didcot station, of a fine range of chalk  hills running parallel with the railway on the left-hand side as you go  down, and distant some two or three miles, more or less, from the line.  The highest point in the range is the White Horse Hill, which you come  in front of just before you stop at the Shrivenham station. If you love  English scenery, and have a few hours to spare, you can't do better,  the next time you pass, than stop at the Farringdon Road or Shrivenham  station, and make your way to that highest point. And those who care for  the vague old stories that haunt country-sides all about England, will  not, if they are wise, be content with only a few hours' stay; for,  glorious as the view is, the neighbourhood is yet more interesting  for its relics of bygone times. I only know two English neighbourhoods  thoroughly, and in each, within a circle of five miles, there is enough  of interest and beauty to last any reasonable man his life. I believe  this to be the case almost throughout the country, but each has a  special attraction, and none can be richer than the one I am speaking of  and going to introduce you to very particularly, for on this subject I  must be prosy; so those that don't care for England in detail may skip  the chapter.    O young England! young England! you who are born into these racing  railroad times, when there's a Great Exhibition, or some monster sight,  every year, and you can get over a couple of thousand miles of ground  for three pound ten in a five-weeks' holiday, why don't you know more of  your own birthplaces? You're all in the ends of the earth, it seems to  me, as soon as you get your necks out of the educational collar, for  midsummer holidays, long vacations, or what not--going round Ireland,  with a return ticket, in a fortnight; dropping your copies of Tennyson  on the tops of Swiss mountains; or pulling down the Danube in Oxford  racing boats. And when you get home for a quiet fortnight, you turn the  steam off, and lie on your backs in the paternal garden, surrounded by  the last batch of books from Mudie's library, and half bored to death.  Well, well! I know it has its good side. You all patter French more or  less, and perhaps German; you have seen men and cities, no doubt, and  have your opinions, such as they are, about schools of painting, high  art, and all that; have seen the pictures of Dresden and the Louvre,  and know the taste of sour krout. All I say is, you don't know your own  lanes and woods and fields. Though you may be choke-full of science, not  one in twenty of you knows where to find the wood-sorrel, or bee-orchis,  which grow in the next wood, or on the down three miles off, or what the  bog-bean and wood-sage are good for. And as for the country legends,  the stories of the old gable-ended farmhouses, the place where the last  skirmish was fought in the civil wars, where the parish butts stood,  where the last highwayman turned to bay, where the last ghost was laid  by the parson, they're gone out of date altogether.    Now, in my time, when we got home by the old coach, which put us down at  the cross-roads with our boxes, the first day of the holidays, and had  been driven off by the family coachman, singing \"Dulce Domum\" at the top  of our voices, there we were,"]]]
