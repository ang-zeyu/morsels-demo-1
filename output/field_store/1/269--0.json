Before the Second Annual Meeting  of the Commission of Conservation  at Quebec, January, 1911    OTTAWA: CAPITAL PRESS LIMITED, 1911          _Animal Sanctuaries  in Labrador_    An Address Presented  BY  LT.-COLONEL WILLIAM WOOD  BEFORE  THE SECOND ANNUAL MEETING  OF THE COMMISSION OF CONSERVATION  HELD AT QUEBEC, JANUARY, 1911          An Appeal    All to whom wild Nature is one of the greatest glories of the Earth,  all who know its higher significance for civilized man to-day, and all  who consequently prize it as an heirloom for posterity, are asked to  help in keeping the animal life of Labrador from being wantonly done  to death.    There is nothing to cause disagreement among the three main classes of  people most interested in wild life--the men whose business depends in  any way on animal products, the sportsmen, and the Nature-lovers of  every kind. There are very good reasons why the general public should  support the scheme. And there are equally good reasons why it should  be induced to do so by simply telling it the truth about the senseless  extermination that is now going on.    Every reader can help by spreading some knowledge of the subject in  his or her home circle. Canada, like all free countries, is governed  by public opinion. And sound public opinion, like all other good  things, should always begin at home.    The Press can help, as it has helped many another good cause, by  giving the subject full publicity. Free use can be made of the present  paper in any way desired. It is left non-copyright for this very  purpose.    Experts can help by pointing out mistakes, giving information, and  making suggestions of their own. And if any of them will undertake to  lead, the present author will undertake to follow.    It is proposed to issue a supplement in 1912, containing all the  additional information collected in the mean time. Every such item of  information will be duly credited to the person supplying it.    All correspondence should be addressed--                              COLONEL WOOD,                               59, Grande Allee, Quebec.          Animal Sanctuaries in Labrador  BY  LIEUT.-COLONEL WILLIAM WOOD, F.R.S.C., ETC.      MR. CHAIRMAN AND GENTLEMEN:--    To be quite honest I must begin by saying that I am not a scientific  expert on either animals, sanctuaries or Labrador. But, by way of  excusing my temerity, I can plead a life-long love of animals, a good  deal of experience and study of them--especially down the Lower St.  Lawrence, and considerable attention to sanctuaries in general and  their suitability to Labrador in particular. Moreover, I can plead  this most pressingly important fact, that a magnificent opportunity is  fast slipping away before our very eyes there, without a single effort  being made to seize it. I have repeatedly discussed the question with  those best qualified to give sound advice--with naturalists,  explorers, missionaries, fishermen, furriers, traders, hunters,  sportsmen, and many who are accustomed to look ahead into the higher  development of our public life. I have also read the books, papers and  reports written from up-to-date and first-hand knowledge. And, though  I have been careful to consult men who regard such questions from very  different points of view, and books showing quite as wide a general  divergence, I have found a remarkable consensus of opinion in favour  of establishing a system of sanctuaries before it is too late. I  should like to add that any information on the subject, or any  correction of what I have written here, will be most welcome. The  simple address, Quebec, will always find me. The only special point I  would ask correspondents to remember is that even the best  recommendations must be adapted to the peculiarities of the Labrador  problem, which is new, strange, immense, and full of complex human  factors.    Perhaps I might be allowed to explain that I speak simply as a  Canadian. I am not connected with any of the material interests  concerned. I do not even belong to a Fish and Game club. My only  object is to prove, from verifiable facts, that animal life in  Labrador is being recklessly and wantonly squandered, that this is  detrimental to everyone except the get-rich-quickly people who are  ready to destroy any natural resources forever in order to reap an  immediate and selfish advantage, that sanctuaries will better  conditions in every way, and that the ultimate benefit to Canada--both  in a material and a higher sense--will repay the small present expense  required, over and over again. And this repayment need not be long  deferred. I can show that once the public grasps the issues at stake  it will supply enough petitioners to move any government based on  popular support, and that the scheme itself will supply enough money  to make the sanctuaries a national asset of the most paying kind, and  enough higher human interest to make them priceless as a possession  for ourselves and a heritage for all who come after.    If, Sir, you would allow me to make one more preliminary explanation,  I should like to say that I have purposely left out all the usual  array of statistics. I have, of course, examined them carefully  myself, and based my arguments upon them. But I have excluded them  from my text because they would have made an already long paper unduly  longer, and because they are perfectly accessible to every member of  the Commission which I have the honour of addressing to-night.      SANCTUARIES.    A sanctuary may be defined as a place where Man is passive and the  rest of Nature active. Till quite recently Nature had her own  sanctuaries, where man either did not go at all or only as a  tool-using animal in comparatively small numbers. But now, in this  machinery age, there is no place left where man cannot go with  overwhelming forces at his command. He can strangle to death all the  nobler wild life in the world to-day. To-morrow he certainly will have  done so, unless he exercises due foresight and self-control in the  mean time. There is not the slightest doubt that birds and mammals are  now being killed off much faster than they can breed. And it is always  the largest and noblest forms of life that suffer most. The whales and  elephants, lions and eagles, go. The rats and flies, and all mean  parasites, remain. This is inevitable in certain cases. But it is  wanton killing off that I am speaking of to-night. Civilized man  begins by destroying the very forms of wild life he learns to  appreciate most when he becomes still more civilized. The obvious  remedy is to begin conservation at an earlier stage, when it is  easier and better in every way, by enforcing laws for close seasons,  game preserves, the selective protection of certain species, and  sanctuaries. I have just defined a sanctuary as a place where man is  passive and the rest of Nature active. But this general definition is  too absolute for any special case. The mere fact that man has to  protect a sanctuary does away with his purely passive attitude. Then,  he can be beneficially active by destroying pests and parasites, like  bot-flies or mosquitoes, and by finding antidotes for diseases like  the epidemic which periodically kills off the rabbits and thus starves  many of the carnivora to death. But, except in cases where experiment  has proved his intervention to be beneficial, the less he upsets the  balance of Nature the better, even when he tries to be an earthly  Providence.    In itself a sanctuary is a kind of wild \"zoo,\" on a gigantic scale and  under ideal conditions. As such, it appeals to everyone interested in  animals, from the greatest zoologist to the mere holiday tourist.  Before concluding I shall give facts to show how well worth while it  would be to establish sanctuaries, even if there were no other people  to enjoy the benefits. Yet the strongest of all arguments is that  sanctuaries, far from conflicting with other interests, actually  further them. But unless we make these sanctuaries soon we shall be  infamous forever, as the one generation which defrauded posterity of  all the preservable wild life that Nature took a million years to  evolve into its present beautiful perfection. Only a certain amount of  animal life can exist in a certain area. The surplus must go outside.  So sanctuaries are more than wild \"zoos\", they are overflowing  reservoirs, fed by their own springs, and feeding streams of life at  every outlet. They serve not only those interested in animal life, but  those legitimately interested in animal death, for business, sport or  food. I might mention many instances of successful sanctuaries,  permanent or temporary, absolute or modified--the Algonquin, Rocky  Mountains, Yoho, Glacier, Jasper and Laurentides in Canada; the  Yellowstone, Yosemite, Grand Canon, Olympus and Superior in the United  States; with the sea-lions of California, the wonderful revival of  ibex in Spain and deer in Maine and New Brunswick, the great preserves  in Uganda, India and Ceylon, the selective work of Baron von Berlepsch  in Germany, the curious result of taboo protection up the Nelson  river, and the effects on seafowl in cases as far apart in time and  space as the guano islands under the Incas of Peru, Gardiner island in  the United States or the Bass rock off the coast of Scotland.    Yet I do not ignore the difficulties. First, there is the universal  difficulty of introducing or enforcing laws where there have been no  operative laws before. Next, there is the difficulty of arousing  public opinion on any subject, however worthy, which requires both  insight and foresight. Then, we must remember that protected species  increasing beyond their special means of subsistence have to seek "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14868"],[0,"The Tailor of Gloucester (#1)"],[1,"[Illustration]    THE TAILOR OF  GLOUCESTER    BY  BEATRIX POTTER    _Author of  \"The Tale of Peter Rabbit,\" etc_        \"I'LL BE AT CHARGES FOR A LOOKING-GLASS,       AND ENTERTAIN A SCORE OR TWO OF TAILORS\"                             _Richard III_    NEW YORK    FREDERICK WARNE & CO, INC    COPYRIGHT, 1903    BY    FREDERICK WARNE & Co.

He sat in the window of a little shop in Westgate Street, cross-legged on  a table, from morning till dark.    All day long while the light lasted he sewed and snippeted, piecing out  his satin and pompadour, and lutestring; stuffs had strange names, and  were very expensive in the days of the Tailor of Gloucester.    But although he sewed fine silk for his neighbours, he himself was very,  very poor--a little old man in spectacles, with a pinched face, old  crooked fingers, and a suit of thread-bare clothes.    He cut his coats without waste, according to his embroidered cloth; they  were very small ends and snippets that lay about upon the table--\"Too  narrow breadths for nought--except waistcoats for mice,\" said the tailor.    [Illustration]    One bitter cold day near Christmastime the tailor began to make a coat--a  coat of cherry-coloured corded silk embroidered with pansies and roses,  and a cream coloured satin waistcoat--trimmed with gauze and green  worsted chenille--for the Mayor of Gloucester.    [Illustration]    The tailor worked and worked, and he talked to himself. He measured the  silk, and turned it round and round, and trimmed it into shape with his  shears; the table was all littered with cherry-coloured snippets.    \"No breadth at all, and cut on the cross; it is no breadth at all; tippets  for mice and ribbons for mobs! for mice!\" said the Tailor of Gloucester.    When the snow-flakes came down against the small leaded window-panes and  shut out the light, the tailor had done his day's work; all the silk and  satin lay cut out upon the table.    [Illustration]    There were twelve pieces for the coat and four pieces for the waistcoat;  and there were pocket flaps and cuffs, and buttons all in order. For the  lining of the coat there was fine yellow taffeta; and for the button-holes  of the waistcoat, there was cherry-coloured twist. And everything was  ready to sew together in the morning, all measured and sufficient--except  that there was wanting just one single skein of cherry-coloured twisted  silk.    The tailor came out of his shop at dark, for he did not sleep there at  nights; he fastened the window and locked the door, and took away the key.  No one lived there at night but little brown mice, and they run in and out  without any keys!    [Illustration]    For behind the wooden wainscots of all the old houses in Gloucester, there  are little mouse staircases and secret trap-doors; and the mice run from  house to house through those long narrow passages; they can run all over  the town without going into the streets.    But the tailor came out of his shop, and shuffled home through the snow.  He lived quite near by in College Court, next the doorway to College  Green; and although it was not a big house, the tailor was so poor he only  rented the kitchen.    He lived alone with his cat; it was called Simpkin.    [Illustration]    Now all day long while the tailor was out at work, Simpkin kept house by  himself; and he also was fond of the mice, though he gave them no satin  for coats!    \"Miaw?\" said the cat when the tailor opened the door. \"Miaw?\"    The tailor replied--\"Simpkin, we shall make our fortune, but I am worn to  a ravelling. Take this groat (which is our last fourpence) and Simpkin,  take a china pipkin; buy a penn'orth of bread, a penn'orth of milk and a  penn'orth of sausages. And oh, Simpkin, with the last penny of our  fourpence buy me one penn'orth of cherry-coloured silk. But do not lose  the last penny of the fourpence, Simpkin, or I am undone and worn to a  thread-paper, for I have NO MORE TWIST.\"    [Illustration]    Then Simpkin again said, \"Miaw?\" and took the groat and the pipkin, and  went out into the dark.    The tailor was very tired and beginning to be ill. He sat down by the  hearth and talked to himself about that wonderful coat.    \"I shall make my fortune--to be cut bias--the Mayor of Gloucester is to be  married on Christmas Day in the morning, and he hath ordered a coat and an  embroidered waistcoat--to be lined with yellow taffeta--and the taffeta  sufficeth; there is no more left over in snippets than will serve to make  tippets for mice----\"    Then the tailor started; for suddenly, interrupting him, from the dresser  at the other side of the kitchen came a number of little noises--    _Tip tap, tip tap, tip tap tip!_    \"Now what can that be?\" said the Tailor of Gloucester, jumping up from his  chair. The dresser was covered with crockery and pipkins, willow pattern  plates, and tea-cups and mugs.    The tailor crossed the kitchen, and stood quite still beside the dresser,  listening, and peering through his spectacles. Again from under a tea-cup,  came those funny little noises--    _Tip tap, tip tap, Tip tap tip!_    \"This is very peculiar,\" said the Tailor of Gloucester; and he lifted up  the tea-cup which was upside down.    [Illustration]    Out stepped a little live lady mouse, and made a curtsey to the tailor!  Then she hopped away down off the dresser, and under the wainscot.    The tailor sat down again by the fire, warming his poor cold hands, and  mumbling to himself----    \"The waistcoat is cut out from peach-coloured satin--tambour stitch and  rose-buds in beautiful floss silk. Was I wise to entrust my last fourpence  to Simpkin? One-and-twenty button-holes of cherry-coloured twist!\"    But all at once, from the dresser, there came other little noises:    _Tip tap, tip tap, tip tap tip!_    \"This is passing extraordinary!\" said the Tailor of Gloucester, and  turned over another tea-cup, which was upside down.    [Illustration]    Out stepped a little gentleman mouse, and made a bow to the tailor!    And then from all over the dresser came a chorus of little tappings, all  sounding together, and answering one another, like watch-beetles in an old  worm-eaten window-shutter--    _Tip tap, tip tap, tip tap tip_!    And out from under tea-cups and from under bowls and basins, stepped other  and more little mice who hopped away down off the dresser and under the  wainscot.    [Illustration]    The tailor sat down, close over the fire, lamenting--\"One-and-twenty  button-holes of cherry-coloured silk! To be finished by noon of  Saturday: and this is Tuesday evening. Was it right to let loose those  mice, undoubtedly the property of Simpkin? Alack, I am undone, for I have  no more twist!\"    The little mice came out again, and listened to the tailor; they took  notice of the pattern of that wonderful coat. They whispered to one  another about the taffeta lining, and about little mouse tippets.    And then all at once they all ran away together down the passage behind  the wainscot, squeaking and calling to one another, as they ran from house  to house; and not one mouse was left in the tailor's kitchen when Simpkin  came back with the pipkin of milk!    [Illustration]    Simpkin opened the door and bounced in, with an angry \"G-r-r-miaw!\" like a  cat that is vexed: for he hated the snow, and there was snow in his ears,  and snow in his collar at the back of his neck. He put down the loaf and  the sausages upon the dresser, and sniffed.    \"Simpkin,\" said the tailor, \"where is my twist?\"    But Simpkin set down the pipkin of milk upon the dresser, and looked  suspiciously at the tea-cups. He wanted his supper of little fat mouse!    \"Simpkin,\" said the tailor, \"where is my TWIST?\"    [Illustration]    But Simpkin hid a little parcel privately in the tea-pot, and spit and  growled at the tailor; and if Simpkin had been able to talk, he would have  asked: \"Where is my MOUSE?\"    \"Alack, I am undone!\" said the Tailor of Gloucester, and went sadly to  bed.    All that night long Simpkin hunted and searched through the kitchen,  peeping into cupboards and under the wainscot, and into the tea-pot where  he had hidden that twist; but still he found never a mouse!    Whenever the tailor muttered and talked in his sleep, Simpkin said  \"Miaw-ger-r-w-s-s-ch!\" and made strange horrid noises, as cats do at  night.    [Illustration]    For the poor old tailor was very ill with a fever, tossing and turning in  his four-post bed; and still in his dreams he mumbled--\"No more twist! no  more twist!\"    All that day he was ill, and the next day, and the next; and what should  become of the cherry-coloured coat? In the tailor's shop in Westgate  Street the embroidered silk and satin lay cut out upon the  table--one-and-twenty button-holes--and who should come to sew them, when  the window was barred, and the door was fast locked?    But that does not hinder the little brown mice; they run in and out  without any keys through all the old houses in Gloucester!
