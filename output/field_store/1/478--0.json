AUTHOR'S PREFACE      This book is written for young students in high schools and normal  schools. No knowledge can be of more use to a young person than a  knowledge of himself; no study can be more valuable to him than a study  of himself. A study of the laws of human behavior,--that is the purpose  of this book.    What is human nature like? Why do we act as we do? How can we make  ourselves different? How can we make others different? How can we make  ourselves more efficient? How can we make our lives more worth while?  This book is a manual intended to help young people to obtain such  knowledge of human nature as will enable them to answer these questions.    I have not attempted to write a complete text on psychology. There are  already many such books, and good ones too. I have selected for  treatment only such topics as young students can study with interest and  profit. I have tried to keep in mind all the time the practical worth of  the matters discussed, and the ability and experience of the intended  readers.      TO THE TEACHER    This book can be only a guide to you. You are to help your students  study human nature. You must, to some extent, be a psychologist yourself  before you can teach psychology. You must yourself be a close and  scientific student of human nature. Develop in the students the spirit  of inquiry and investigation. Teach them to look to their own minds and  their neighbor's actions for verification of the statements of the text.  Let the students solve by observation and experiment the questions and  problems raised in the text and the exercises. The exercises should  prove to be the most valuable part of the book. The first two chapters  are the most difficult but ought to be read before the rest of the book  is studied. If you think best, merely read these two chapters with the  pupils, and after the book is finished come back to them for careful  study.    In the references, I have given parallel readings, for the most part to  Titchener, Pillsbury, and Muensterberg. I have purposely limited the  references, partly because a library will not be available to many who  may use the book, and partly because the young student is likely to be  confused by much reading from different sources before he has worked out  some sort of system and a point of view of his own. Only the most  capable members of a high school class will be able to profit much from  the references given.      TO THE STUDENT    You are beginning the study of human nature. You can not study human  nature from a book, you must study yourself and your neighbors. This  book may help you to know what to look for and to understand what you  find, but it can do little more than this. It is true, this text gives  you many facts learned by psychologists, but you must verify the  statements, or at least see their significance to _you_, or they will  be of no worth to you. However, the facts considered here, properly  understood and assimilated, ought to prove of great value to you. But  perhaps of greater value will be the psychological frame of mind or  attitude which you should acquire. The psychological attitude is that of  seeking to find and understand the _causes of human action, and the  causes, consequences, and significance of the processes of the human  mind_. If your first course in psychology teaches you to look for these  things, gives you some skill in finding them and in using the knowledge  after you have it, your study should be quite worth while.    W. H. PYLE.          EDITOR'S PREFACE      There are at least two possible approaches to the study of psychology by  teacher-training students in high schools and by beginning students in  normal schools.    One of these is through methods of teaching and subject matter. The  other aims to give the simple, concrete facts of psychology as the  science of the mind. The former presupposes a close relationship between  psychology and methods of teaching and assumes that psychology is  studied chiefly as an aid to teaching. The latter is less complicated.  The plan contemplates the teaching of the simple fundamentals at first  and applying them incidentally as the occasion demands. This latter  point of view is in the main the point of view taken in the text.    The author has taught the material of the text to high school students  to the end that he might present the fundamental facts of psychology in  simple form.    W. W. C.

Science is  knowledge; it is what we know. But mere knowledge is not science. For a  bit of knowledge to become a part of science, its relation to other bits  of knowledge must be found. In botany, for example, bits of knowledge  about plants do not make a science of botany. To have a science of  botany, we must not only know about leaves, roots, flowers, seeds, etc.,  but we must know the relations of these parts and of all the parts of a  plant to one another. In other words, in science, we must not only  _know_, we must not only have _knowledge_, but we must know the  significance of the knowledge, must know its _meaning_. This is only  another way of saying that we must have knowledge and know its relation  to other knowledge.    A scientist is one who has learned to organize his knowledge. The main  difference between a scientist and one who is not a scientist is that  the scientist sees the significance of facts, while the non-scientific  man sees facts as more or less unrelated things. As one comes to hunt  for causes and inquire into the significance of things, one becomes a  scientist. A thing or an event always points beyond itself to something  else. This something else is what goes before it or comes after it,--is  its cause or its effect. This causal relationship that exists between  events enables a scientist to prophesy. By carefully determining what  always precedes a certain event, a certain type of happening, a  scientist is able to predict the event. All that is necessary to be able  to predict an event is to have a clear knowledge of its true causes.  Whenever, beyond any doubt, these causes are found to be present, the  scientist knows the event will follow. Of course, all that he really  _knows_ is that such results have always followed similar causes in the  past. But he has come to have faith in the uniformity and regularity of  nature. The chemist does not find sulphur, or oxygen, or any other  element acting one way one day under a certain set of conditions, and  acting another way the next day under exactly the same conditions. Nor  does the physicist find the laws of mechanics holding good one day and  not the next.    The scientist, therefore, in his thinking brings order out of chaos in  the world. If we do not know the causes and relations of things and  events, the world seems a very mixed-up, chaotic place, where anything  and everything is happening. But as we come to know causes and  relations, the world turns out to be a very orderly and systematic  place. It is a lawful world; it is not a world of chance. Everything is  related to everything else.

Written by:  Miss Grace McCune  Athens, Ga.    Edited by:  Mrs. Sarah H. Hall  Athens, Ga.    and  Mrs. Leila Harris  Augusta, Ga.  [Date Stamp: APR 29 1938]      \"Yes chile, I'll be glad to tell you de story of my life, I can't tell  you much 'bout slav'ry 'cause I wuz jus' six months old when freedom  come, but I has heared quite a lot, and I will tell you all I kin  'member 'bout everythin.\" Said old \"Aunt\" Georgia Telfair, who lives  with her son to whom her devotion is quite evident. Both \"Aunt\" Georgia  and the little home show the excellent care that is given them.    \"My pa,\" she said, \"wuz Pleasant Jones, an' he b'longed to Marse Young  L.G. Harris. Dey lived at de Harris place out on Dearing Street. Hit wuz  all woods out dar den, an' not a bit lak Dearing Street looks now.    \"Rachel wuz my ma's name. Us don' know what her las' name wuz 'cause she  wuz sold off when she wuz too little to 'member. Dr. Riddin' (Redding)  bought her an' his fambly always jus' called her Rachel Riddin'. De  Riddin' place wuz whar Hancock Avenue is now, but it wuz all in woods  'roun' dar, jus' lak de place whar my pa wuz. Atter dey wuz married ma  had to stay on wid de Riddin' fambly an' her chilluns b'longed to de  Riddin's 'cause dey owned her. Miss Maxey Riddin' wuz my brudder's young  Missus, an' I wuz give to her sister, Miss Lula Riddin', for to be her  own maid, but us didn't git to wuk for 'em none 'cause it wuz jus' at  dis time all de slaves got sot free. Atter dat my pa tuk us all wid him  an' went to farm on de old Widderspoon (Witherspoon) place.    \"It wuz 'way off in de woods. Pa cut down trees an' built us a log  cabin. He made de chimbly out of sticks an' red mud, an' put iron bars  crost de fireplace to hang pots on for to bile our vittuls an' made  ovens for de bakin'. De bes' way to cook 'tatoes wuz to roas' 'em in de  ashes wid de jackets on. Dey ain' nothin' better tastin' dan ash-roasted  'tatoes wid good home-made butter to eat wid 'em. An 'us had de butter,  'cause us kep' two good cows. Ma had her chickens an' tukkeys an' us  raised plenty of hogs, so we nebber wuz widout meat. Our reg'lar Sunday  breakfas' wuz fish what pa cotch out of de crick. I used to git tired  out of fish den, but a mess of fresh crick fish would sho' be jus' right  now.    \"Us always kep' a good gyardan full of beans, corn, onions, peas an'  'taters, an' dey warn't nobody could beat us at raisin' lots of greens,  'specially turnips an' colla'd greens. Us saved heaps of dry peas an'  beans, an' dried lots of peaches an' apples to cook in winter. When de  wind wuz a howlin an' de groun' all kivvered wid snow, ma would make  dried fruit puffs for us, dat sho' did hit de spot.    \"When I wuz 'bout eight years old, dey sont me to school. I had to walk  from Epps Bridge Road to Knox School. Dey calls it Knox Institute now. I  toted my blue back speller in one han' and my dinner bucket in de other.  Us wore homespun dresses wid bonnets to match. De bonnets wuz all made  in one piece an' had drawstrings on de back to make 'em fit, an' slats  in de brims to make 'em stiff an' straight. Our dresses wuz made long to  keep our legs warm. I don't see, for to save me, how dey keeps dese  young-uns from freezin' now since dey let 'em go 'roun' mos' naked.    \"Our brush arbor church wuz nigh whar Brooklyn Mount Pleasant Church is  now, an' us went to Sunday School dar evvy Sunday. It warn't much of a  church for looks, 'cause it wuz made out of poles stuck in de groun' an'  de roof wuz jus' pine limbs an' brush, but dere sho' wuz some good  meetin's in dat old brush church, an' lots of souls foun' de way to de  heb'enly home right dar.    \"Our reg'lar preacher wuz a colored man named Morrison, but Mr. Cobb  preached to us lots of times. He wuz a white gemman, an' he say he could  a sot all night an' lissen long as us sung dem old songs. Some of 'em I  done clar forgot, but de one I lak bes' goes sorter lak dis:      'I want to be an angel     An' wid de angels stan'     A crown upon my forehead     And a harp widin my han'.'    \"Another tune wuz 'Roll, Jordan Roll.' Little chillun wuz larnt to sing,  'How Sweetly do de Time Fly, When I Please my Mother,' an' us chillun  sho' would do our best a singin' dat little old song, so Preacher Cobb  would praise us.    \"When I jined de church dere wuz 35 of us baptized de same day in de  crick back of de church. While Preacher Brown wuz a baptizin' us, a big  crowd wuz standin' on de bank a shoutin' an' singin', 'Dis is de healin'  Water,' an', 'Makin' for de Promise Lan! Some of 'em wuz a prayin' too.  Atter de baptizin' wuz done dey had a big dinner on de groun's for de  new members, but us didn't see no jugs dat day. Jus' had plenty of good  somethin' t'eat.    \"When us warn't in school, me an' my brudder wukked in de fiel' wid pa.  In cotton plantin' time, pa fixed up de rows an' us drap de seeds in  'em. Nex' day us would rake dirt over 'em wid wooden rakes. Pa made de  rakes hisse'f. Dey had short wooden teef jus' right for to kivver de  seed. Folkses buys what dey uses now an' don't take up no time makin'  nothin' lak dat.    \"In dem days 'roun' de house an' in de fiel' boys jus' wo' one piece of  clo'es. It wuz jus' a long shirt.
