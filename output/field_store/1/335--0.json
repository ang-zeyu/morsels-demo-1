PREFACE.           The following sketches, like the \"Ways of Wood Folk,\" are the       result of many years of personal observation in the woods and       fields. They are studies of animals, pure and simple, not of       animals with human motives and imaginations.         Indeed, it is hardly necessary for genuine interest to give human       traits to the beasts. Any animal is interesting enough as an       animal, and has character enough of his own, without borrowing       anything from man--as one may easily find out by watching long       enough.         Most wild creatures have but small measure of gentleness in them,       and that only by instinct and at short stated seasons. Hence I       have given both sides and both kinds, the shadows and lights, the       savagery as well as the gentleness of the wilderness creatures.         It were pleasanter, to be sure, especially when you have been       deeply touched by some exquisite bit of animal devotion, to let       it go at that, and to carry with you henceforth an ideal       creature.         But the whole truth is better--better for you, better for       children--else personality becomes confused with mere animal       individuality, and love turns to instinct, and sentiment       vaporizes into sentimentality.         This mother fox or fish-hawk here, this strong mother loon or       lynx that to-day brings the quick moisture to your eyes by her       utter devotion to the little helpless things which great Mother       Nature gave her to care for, will to-morrow, when they are grown,       drive those same little ones with savage treatment into the world       to face its dangers alone, and will turn away from their       sufferings thereafter with astounding indifference.         It is well to remember this, and to give proper weight to the       word, when we speak of the _love_ of animals for their little       ones.         I met a bear once--but this foolish thing is not to be       imitated--with two small cubs following at her heels. The mother       fled into the brush; the cubs took to a tree. After some timorous       watching I climbed after the cubs, and shook them off, and put       them into a bag, and carried them to my canoe, squealing and       appealing to the one thing in the woods that could easily have       helped them. I was ready enough to quit all claims and to take to       the brush myself upon inducement. But the mother had found a       blueberry patch and was stuffing herself industriously.         And I have seen other mother bears since then, and foxes and deer       and ducks and sparrows, and almost all the wild creatures       between, driving their own offspring savagely away. Generally       the young go of their own accord as early as possible, knowing no       affection but only dependence, and preferring liberty to       authority; but more than once I have been touched by the sight of       a little one begging piteously to be fed or just to stay, while       the mother drove him away impatiently. Moreover, they all kill       their weaklings, as a rule, and the burdensome members of too       large a family. This is not poetry or idealization, but just       plain animal nature.         As for the male animals, little can be said truthfully for their       devotion. Father fox and wolf, instead of caring for their mates       and their offspring, as we fondly imagine, live apart by       themselves in utter selfishness. They do nothing whatever for the       support or instruction of the young, and are never suffered by       the mothers to come into the den, lest they destroy their own       little ones. One need not go to the woods to see this; his own       stable or kennel, his own dog or cat will be likely to reveal the       startling brutality at the first good opportunity.         An indiscriminate love for all animals, likewise, is not the best       sentiment to cultivate toward creation. Black snakes in a land of       birds, sharks in the bluefish rips, rabbits in Australia, and       weasels everywhere are out of place in the present economy of       nature. Big owls and hawks, representing a yearly destruction of       thousands of good game birds and of untold innocent songsters,       may also be profitably studied with a gun sometimes instead of       an opera-glass. A mink is good for nothing but his skin; a red       squirrel--I hesitate to tell his true character lest I spoil too       many tender but false ideals about him all at once.         The point is this, that sympathy is too true a thing to be       aroused falsely, and that a wise discrimination, which recognizes       good and evil in the woods, as everywhere else in the world, and       which loves the one and hates the other, is vastly better for       children, young and old, than the blind sentimentality aroused by       ideal animals with exquisite human propensities. Therefore I       wrote the story of Kagax, simply to show him as he is, and so to       make you hate him.         In this one chapter, the story of Kagax the Weasel, I have       gathered into a single animal the tricks and cruelties of a score       of vicious little brutes that I have caught red-handed at their       work. In the other chapters I have, for the most part, again       searched my old notebooks and the records of wilderness camps,       and put the individual animals down just as I found them.

His  Milicete name means The Wandering One, but it ought to mean the  Mysterious and the Changeful as well. If you hear that he is bold and  fearless, that is true; and if you are told that he is shy and wary  and inapproachable, that is also true. For he is never the same two  days in succession. At once shy and bold, solitary and gregarious;  restless as a cloud, yet clinging to his feeding grounds, spite of  wolves and hunters, till he leaves them of his own free will; wild as  Kakagos the raven, but inquisitive as a blue jay,--he is the most  fascinating and the least known of all the deer.    One thing is quite sure, before you begin your study: he is never  where his tracks are, nor anywhere near it. And if after a season's  watching and following you catch one good glimpse of him, that is a  good beginning.    I had always heard and read of Megaleep as an awkward, ungainly  animal, but almost my first glimpse of him scattered all that to the  winds and set my nerves a-tingling in a way that they still remember.  It was on a great chain of barrens in the New Brunswick wilderness. I  was following the trail of a herd of caribou one day, when far ahead a  strange clacking sound came ringing across the snow in the crisp  winter air. I ran ahead to a point of woods that cut off my view from  a five-mile barren, only to catch breath in astonishment and drop to  cover behind a scrub spruce. Away up the barren my caribou, a big herd  of them, were coming like an express train straight towards me. At  first I could make out only a great cloud of steam, a whirl of flying  snow, and here and there the angry shake of wide antlers or the gleam  of a black muzzle. The loud clacking of their hoofs, sweeping nearer  and nearer, gave a snap, a tingle, a wild exhilaration to their rush  which made one want to shout and swing his hat. Presently I could make  out the individual animals through the cloud of vapor that drove down  the wind before them. They were going at a splendid trot, rocking  easily from side to side like pacing colts, power, grace, tirelessness  in every stride. Their heads were high, their muzzles up, the antlers  well back on heaving shoulders. Jets of steam burst from their  nostrils at every bound; for the thermometer was twenty below zero,  and the air snapping. A cloud of snow whirled out and up behind them;  through it the antlers waved like bare oak boughs in the wind; the  sound of their hoofs was like the clicking of mighty castanets--\"Oh  for a sledge and bells!\" I thought; for Santa Claus never had such a  team.    So they came on swiftly, magnificently, straight on to the cover  behind which I crouched with nerves thrilling as at a cavalry  charge,--till I sprang to my feet with a shout and swung my hat; for,  as there was meat enough in camp, I had small wish to use my rifle,  and no desire whatever to stand that rush at close quarters and be run  down. There was a moment of wild confusion out on the barren just in  front of me. The long swinging trot, that caribou never change if they  can help it, was broken into an awkward jumping gallop. The front rank  reared, plunged, snorted a warning, but were forced onward by the  pressure behind. Then the leading bulls gave a few mighty bounds which  brought them"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15955"],[0,"A Short History of Scotland (#1)"],[1,"from the 1911 William Blackwood and Sons edition by David  Price, email ccx074@coventry.ac.uk            A SHORT HISTORY OF SCOTLAND      CHAPTER I.  SCOTLAND AND THE ROMANS.      If we could see in a magic mirror the country now called Scotland as it  was when the Romans under Agricola (81 A.D.) crossed the Border, we  should recognise little but the familiar hills and mountains.  The  rivers, in the plains, overflowed their present banks; dense forests of  oak and pine, haunted by great red deer, elks, and boars, covered land  that has long been arable.  There were lakes and lagoons where for  centuries there have been fields of corn.  On the oldest sites of our  towns were groups of huts made of clay and wattle, and dominated,  perhaps, by the large stockaded house of the tribal prince.  In the  lochs, natural islands, or artificial islets made of piles (crannogs),  afforded standing-ground and protection to villages, if indeed these lake-  dwellings are earlier in Scotland than the age of war that followed the  withdrawal of the Romans.    The natives were far beyond the savage stage of culture.  They lived in  an age of iron tools and weapons and of wheeled vehicles; and were in  what is called the Late Celtic condition of art and culture, familiar to  us from beautiful objects in bronze work, more commonly found in Ireland  than in Scotland, and from the oldest Irish romances and poems.    In these \"epics\" the manners much resemble those described by Homer.  Like  his heroes, the men in the Cuchullain sagas fight from light chariots,  drawn by two ponies, and we know that so fought the tribes in Scotland  encountered by Agricola the Roman General (81-85 A.D.)  It is even said  in the Irish epics that Cuchullain learned his chariotry in _Alba_--that  is, in our Scotland. {2}  The warriors had \"mighty limbs and flaming  hair,\" says Tacitus.  Their weapons were heavy iron swords, in bronze  sheaths beautifully decorated, and iron-headed spears; they had large  round bronze-studded shields, and battle-axes.  The dress consisted of  two upper garments: first, the smock, of linen or other fabric--in  battle, often of tanned hides of animals,--and the mantle, or plaid, with  its brooch.  Golden torques and heavy gold bracelets were worn by the  chiefs; the women had bronze ornaments with brightly coloured enamelled  decoration.    Agriculture was practised, and corn was ground in the circular querns of  stone, of which the use so long survived.  The women span and wove the  gay smocks and darker cloaks of the warriors.    Of the religion, we only know that it was a form of polytheism; that  sacrifices were made, and that Druids existed; they were soothsayers,  magicians, perhaps priests, and were attendant on kings.    Such were the people in Alba whom we can dimly descry around Agricola's  fortified frontier between the firths of Forth and Clyde, about 81-82  A.D.  When Agricola pushed north of the Forth and Tay he still met men  who had considerable knowledge of the art of war.  In his battle at Mons  Graupius (perhaps at the junction of Isla and Tay), his cavalry had the  better of the native chariotry in the plain; and the native infantry,  descending from their position on the heights, were attacked by his  horsemen in their attempt to assail his rear.  But they were swift of  foot, the woods sheltered and the hills defended them.  He made no more  effectual pursuit than Cumberland did at Culloden.    Agricola was recalled by Domitian after seven years' warfare, and his  garrisons did not long hold their forts on his lines or frontier, which  stretched across the country from Forth to Clyde; roughly speaking, from  Graham's Dyke, east of Borrowstounnis on the Firth of Forth, to Old  Kilpatrick on Clyde.  The region is now full of coal-mines, foundries,  and villages; but excavations at Bar Hill, Castlecary, and Roughcastle  disclose traces of Agricola's works, with their earthen ramparts.  The  Roman station at Camelon, north-west of Falkirk, was connected with the  southern passes of the Highland hills by a road with a chain of forts.  The remains of Roman pottery at Camelon are of the first century.    Two generations after Agricola, about 140-145, the Roman Governor,  Lollius Urbicus, refortified the line of Forth to Clyde with a wall of  sods and a ditch, and forts much larger than those constructed by  Agricola.  His line, \"the Antonine Vallum,\" had its works on commanding  ridges; and fire-signals, in case of attack by the natives, flashed the  news \"from one sea to the other sea,\" while the troops of occupation  could be provisioned from the Roman fleet.  Judging by the coins found by  the excavators, the line was abandoned about 190, and the forts were  wrecked and dismantled, perhaps by the retreating Romans.    After the retreat from the Antonine Vallum, about 190, we hear of the  vigorous \"unrest\" of the Meatae and Caledonians; the latter people are  said, on very poor authority, to have been little better than savages.  Against them Severus (208) made an expedition indefinitely far to the  north, but the enemy shunned a general engagement, cut off small  detachments, and caused the Romans terrible losses in this march to a non-  existent Moscow.    Not till 306 do we hear of the Picts, about whom there is infinite  learning but little knowledge.  They must have spoken Gaelic by Severus's  time (208), whatever their original language; and were long recognised in  Galloway, where the hill and river names are Gaelic.    The later years of the Romans, who abandoned Britain in 410, were  perturbed by attacks of the Scoti (Scots) from Ireland, and it is to a  settlement in Argyll of \"Dalriadic\" Scots from Ireland about 500 A.D.  that our country owes the name of Scotland.    Rome has left traces of her presence on Scottish soil--vestiges of the  forts and vallum wall between the firths; a station rich in antiquities  under the Eildons at Newstead; another, Ardoch, near Sheriffmuir; a third  near Solway Moss (Birrenswark); and others less extensive, with some  roads extending towards the Moray Firth; and a villa at Musselburgh,  found in the reign of James VI. {4}          CHAPTER II.  CHRISTIANITY--THE RIVAL KINGDOMS.      To the Scots, through St Columba, who, about 563, settled in Iona, and  converted the Picts as far north as Inverness, we owe the introduction of  Christianity, for though the Roman Church of St Ninian (397), at Whithern  in Galloway, left embers of the faith not extinct near Glasgow, St  Kentigern's country, till Columba's time, the rites of Christian Scotland  were partly of the Celtic Irish type, even after St Wilfrid's victory at  the Synod of Whitby (664).    St Columba himself was of the royal line in Ulster, was learned, as  learning was then reckoned, and, if he had previously been turbulent, he  now desired to spread the Gospel.  With twelve companions he settled in  Iona, established his cloister of cells, and journeyed to Inverness, the  capital of Pictland.  Here his miracles overcame the magic of the King's  druids; and his Majesty, Brude, came into the fold, his people following  him.  Columba was no less of a diplomatist than of an evangelist.  In a  crystal he saw revealed the name of the rightful king of the Dalriad  Scots in Argyll--namely, Aidan--and in 575, at Drumceat in North Ireland,  he procured the recognition of Aidan, and brought the King of the Picts  also to confess Aidan's independent royalty.    In the 'Life of Columba,' by Adamnan, we get a clear and complete view of  everyday existence in the Highlands during that age.  We are among the  red deer, and the salmon, and the cattle in the hills, among the second-  sighted men, too, of whom Columba was far the foremost.  We see the  saint's inkpot upset by a clumsy but enthusiastic convert; we even make  acquaintance with the old white pony of the monastery, who mourned when  St Columba was dying; while among secular men we observe the differences  in rank, measured by degrees of wealth in cattle.  Many centuries elapse  before, in Froissart, we find a picture of Scotland so distinct as that  painted by Adamnan.    The discipline of St Columba was of the monastic model.  There were  settlements of clerics in fortified villages; the clerics were a kind of  monks, with more regard for abbots than for their many bishops, and with  peculiar tonsures, and a peculiar way of reckoning the date of Easter.  Each missionary was popularly called a Saint, and the _Kil_, or cell, of  many a Celtic missionary survives in hundreds of place-names.    The salt-water Loch Leven in Argyll was on the west the south frontier of  \"Pictland,\" which, on the east, included all the country north of the  Firth of Forth.  From Loch Leven south to Kintyre, a large cantle,  including the isles, was the land of the Scots from Ireland, the  Dalriadic kingdom.  The south-west, from Dumbarton, including our modern  Cumberland and Westmorland, was named Strathclyde, and was peopled by  British folk, speaking an ancient form of Welsh.  On the east, from  Ettrick forest into Lothian, the land was part of the early English  kingdom of Bernicia; here the invading Angles were already settled--though  river-names here remain Gaelic, and hill-names are often either Gaelic or  Welsh.  The great Northern Pictland was divided into seven provinces, or  sub-kingdoms, while there was an over-King, or Ardrigh, with his capital  at Inverness and, later, in Angus or Forfarshire.  The country about  Edinburgh was partly English, partly Cymric or Welsh.  The south-west  corner, Galloway, was called Pictish, and was peopled by Gaelic-speaking  tribes.    In the course of time and events the dynasty of the Argyll Scoti from  Ireland gave its name to Scotland, while the English element gave its  language to the Lowlands; it was adopted by the Celtic kings of the whole  country and became dominant, while the Celtic speech withdrew into the  hills "]]]
