THE LEGENDS OF THE JEWS    BY  LOUIS GINZBERG    TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN MANUSCRIPT BY  HENRIETTA SZOLD      II    BIBLE TIMES AND CHARACTERS FROM JOSEPH TO THE EXODUS          PREFACE    The arrangement and presentation of the material in this  volume are the same as in Volume I. In both my efforts  have been directed to bringing together as full as possible  a collection of Jewish legends that deal with Biblical personages  and events. The sources of those legends and explanations  of some of them will be given in the last volume  of the entire work, and the numbers throughout the work  refer to the notes in the concluding volume.    My original intention was to continue Volume II up to the  death of Moses, but the legendary material clustering around  the life and death of Moses is so abundant that practical  considerations demanded the division of this material, in order  not to make the second volume too bulky. The division  chosen is a natural one. This volume closes with the Exodus,  and contains the deeds of Moses in Egypt, while the following  volume will deal with Moses in the desert.    The fact that Job is placed between Jacob's sons and  Moses may appear strange to some readers, since in the  Bible Job is one of the last books; but \"legend is above time  and space,\" and I have, therefore, given Job the place which  legend has ascribed to him.

Whenever they expect to enjoy life in  tranquillity, Satan hinders them. He appears before God,  and says: \"Is it not enough that the future world is set  apart for the pious? What right have they to enjoy this  world, besides?\" After the many hardships and conflicts  that had beset the path of Jacob, he thought he would be at  rest at last, and then came the loss of Joseph and inflicted the  keenest suffering. Verily, few and evil had been the days  of the years of Jacob's pilgrimage, for the time spent outside  of the Holy Land had seemed joyless to him. Only the  portion of his life passed in the land of his fathers, during  which he was occupied with making proselytes, in accordance  with the example set him by Abraham and Isaac, did  he consider worth while having lived,[1] and this happy time  was of short duration. When Joseph was snatched away,  but eight years had elapsed since his return to his father's  house.[2]    And yet it was only for the sake of Joseph that Jacob had  been willing to undergo all the troubles and the adversity  connected with his sojourn in the house of Laban. Indeed,  Jacob's blessing in having his quiver full of children was due  to the merits of Joseph, and likewise the dividing of the  Red Sea and of the Jordan for the Israelites was the reward for  his son's piety. For among the sons of Jacob  Joseph was the one that resembled his father most closely in  appearance, and, also, he was the one to whom Jacob transmitted  the instruction and knowledge he had received from  his teachers Shem and Eber.[3] The whole course of the son's  life is but a repetition of the father's. As the mother of  Jacob remained childless for a long time after her marriage,  so also the mother of Joseph. As Rebekah had undergone  severe suffering in giving birth to Jacob, so Rachel in giving  birth to Joseph. As Jacob's mother bore two sons, so also  Joseph's mother. Like Jacob, Joseph was born circumcised.  As the father was a shepherd, so the son. As the father  served for the sake of a woman, so the son served under a  woman. Like the father, the son appropriated his older  brother's birthright. The father was hated by his brother,  and the son was hated by his brethren. The father was the  favorite son as compared with his brother, so was the son  as compared with his brethren. Both the father and the son  lived in the land of the stranger. The father became a servant  to a master, also the son. The master whom the father  served was blessed by God, so was the master whom the son  served. The father and the son were both accompanied by  angels, and both married their wives outside of the Holy  Land. The father and the son were both blessed with  wealth. Great things were announced to the father in a  dream, so also to the son. As the father went to Egypt and  put an end to famine, so the son. As the father exacted the  promise from his sons to bury him in the Holy Land, so  also the son. The father died in Egypt, there died also the  son. The body of the father was embalmed, also the body  of the son. As the father's remains were carried to the  Holy Land for interment, so also the remains of the son.  Jacob the father provided for the sustenance of his son  Joseph during a period of seventeen years, so Joseph the  son provided for his father Jacob during a period of seventeen  years.[4]    Until he was seventeen years old, Joseph frequented the  Bet ha-Midrash,[5] and he became so learned that he could  impart to his brethren the Halakot he had heard from his  father, and in this way he may be regarded as their teacher.[6]  He did not stop at formal instruction, he also tried to give  them good counsel, and he became the favorite of the sons  of the handmaids, who would kiss and embrace him.[7]    In spite of his scholarship there was something boyish  about Joseph. He painted his eyes, dressed his hair carefully,  and walked with a mincing step. These foibles of  youth were not so deplorable as his habit of bringing evil  reports of his brethren to his father. He accused them of  treating the beasts under their care with cruelty--he said  that they ate flesh torn from a living animal--and he charged  them with casting their eyes upon the daughters of the  Canaanites, and giving contemptuous treatment to the sons  of the handmaids Bilhah and Zilpah, whom they called  slaves.    For these groundless accusations Joseph had to pay  dearly. He was himself sold as a slave, because he had  charged his brethren with having called the sons of the  handmaids slaves, and Potiphar's wife cast her eyes upon  Joseph, because he threw the suspicion upon his brethren  that they had cast their eyes upon the Canaanitish women.  And how little it was true that they were guilty of cruelty  to animals, appears from the fact that at the very time when  they were contemplating "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14958"],[0,"Mother West Wind 'Why' Stories (#1)"],[1,"WEST WIND \"WHY\" STORIES      by      THORNTON W.

They hurry to call on him the very first thing every  morning after Old Mother West Wind has brought them down from the  Purple Hills. They always beg him to stop and play with them, but  often he refuses. But he does it in such a merry way and with such a  twinkle in his eyes that the Merry Little Breezes never get cross  because he won't play. No, Sir, they never get cross. If anything,  they think just a little bit more of Striped Chipmunk because he won't  play. You see, they know that the reason he won't play is because he  has work to do, and Striped Chipmunk believes and says:        \"When there is work for me to do       The sooner started, sooner through.\"    So every morning they ask him to play, and every morning they laugh  when he says he has too much to do. Then they rumple up his hair and  pull his whiskers and give him last tag and race down to the Smiling  Pool to see Grandfather Frog and beg him for a story. Now Grandfather  Frog is very old and very wise, and he knows all about the days when  the world was young. When he is feeling just right, he dearly loves to  tell about those long-ago days.    One morning the Merry Little Breezes found Grandfather Frog sitting  as usual on his big green lily-pad, and they knew by the way he folded  his hands across his white and yellow waistcoat that it was full of  foolish green flies.    \"Oh, Grandfather Frog, please do tell us why it is that Striped  Chipmunk has such beautiful stripes on his coat,\" begged one of the  Merry Little Breezes.    \"Chug-a-rum! They are stripes of honor,\" replied Grandfather Frog, in  his deep, gruff voice.    \"Honor! Oh, how lovely! Do tell us about it! Please do!\" begged the  Merry Little Breezes.    \"Chug-a-rum!\" began Grandfather Frog, his big, goggly eyes twinkling.  \"Once upon a time, when the world was young, old Mr. Chipmunk, the  grandfather a thousand times removed of Striped Chipmunk, lived very  much as Striped Chipmunk does now. He was always very busy, very  busy, indeed, and it was always about his own affairs. 'By attending  strictly to my own business, I have no time to meddle with the affairs  of my neighbors, and so I keep out of trouble,' said old Mr.  Chipmunk,\"    \"Just what Striped Chipmunk says now,\" broke in one of the Merry  Little Breezes.    \"That shows that he is just as wise as was his grandfather a thousand  times removed, about whom I am telling you,\" replied Grandfather Frog.  \"Old Mr. Chipmunk wore just a little, plain brown coat. It didn't  worry him a bit, not a bit, that his coat was just plain brown. It  kept him just as warm as if it were a beautiful red, like that of Mr.  Fox, or handsome black and white, like that of Mr. Skunk. He was  perfectly satisfied with his little plain brown coat and took the best  of care of it.    \"One day as he was hurrying home to dinner, he climbed up on an old  stump to look around and make sure that the way was clear. Over in a  little path in the meadow grass was walking old Mr. Meadow Mouse. He  was strolling along as if there was nothing in the world to fear. Way  back behind him in the same little path, walking very fast but very  quietly, was big Mr. Bob Cat. His eyes were yellow, and a hungry look  was in them. He didn't see Mr. Meadow Mouse, but he would in a few  minutes. Mr. Chipmunk saw that he would, and that there was no place  for Mr. Meadow Mouse to hide.    \"'Humph! I never meddle in other people's affairs, and this is none of  my business,' said little Mr. Chipmunk.    \"But old Mr. Meadow Mouse was a friend. He thought a great deal of Mr.  Meadow Mouse, did little Mr. Chipmunk. He couldn't bear to think of  what would happen to Mr. Meadow Mouse if big Mr. Bob Cat should catch  him. Then, almost without realizing what he was doing, little Mr.  Chipmunk began to shout at big Mr. Bob Cat and to call him names. Of  course big Mr. Bob Cat looked up right away and saw little Mr.  Chipmunk sitting on the old stump. His eyes grew yellower and  yellower, he drew his lips back from his long, sharp teeth in a very  angry way, and his little bob tail twitched and twitched. Then, with  great leaps, he came straight for the old stump on which little Mr.  Chipmunk was sitting.    \"Little Mr. Chipmunk didn't wait for him to get there. Oh, my, no! He  took one good look at those fierce, hungry, yellow eyes and long,  cruel teeth, and then he whisked into a hole in the old stump. You  see, there wasn't time to go anywhere else. Big Mr. Bob Cat found the  hole in the stump right away. He snarled when he saw it. You see it  was too small, very much too small, for him to get into himself. But  he could get one hand and arm in, and he did, feeling all around  inside for little Mr. Chipmunk. Little Mr. Chipmunk was frightened  almost to death. Yes, Sir, he was frightened almost to death. He made  himself just as flat as he could on the bottom of the hollow and held  his breath.    \"'You'd better come out of there, Mr. Chipmunk, or I'll pull you out!'  snarled Mr. Bob Cat.    \"Little Mr. Chipmunk just snuggled down flatter than ever and didn't  say a word. Mr. Bob Cat felt round and round inside the hollow stump  and raked his long claws on the sides until little Mr. Chipmunk's hair  fairly stood up. Yes, Sir, it stood right up on end, he was so  scared. When it did that, it tickled the claws of Mr. Bob Cat. Mr.  Bob Cat grinned. It was an ugly grin to see. Then he reached in a  little farther and made a grab for little Mr. Chipmunk. His  wide-spread, sharp claws caught in little Mr. Chipmunk's coat near the  neck and tore little strips the whole length of it.    \"Of course little Mr. Chipmunk squealed with pain, for those claws  hurt dreadfully, but he was glad that his coat tore. If it hadn't, Mr.  Bob Cat would surely have pulled him out. After a long time, Mr. Bob  Cat gave up and went off, growling and snarling. When he thought it  was safe, little Mr. Chipmunk crawled out of the old stump and hurried  home. He ached and smarted terribly, and his little plain brown coat  was torn in long strips.    \"'This is what I get for meddling in the affairs of other folks!'  said little Mr. Chipmunk bitterly. 'If I'd just minded my own  business, it wouldn't have happened.'    \"Just then he happened to look over to the house of Mr. Meadow Mouse.  There was Mr. Meadow Mouse playing with his children. He didn't know a  thing about what his neighbor, little Mr. Chipmunk, had done for him,  for you remember he hadn't seen Mr. Bob Cat at all. Little Mr.  Chipmunk grinned as well as he could for the pain.    \"'I'm glad I did it,' he muttered. 'Yes, Sir, I'm glad I did it, and  I'm glad that Neighbor Meadow Mouse doesn't know about it. I'm glad  that nobody knows about it.        'A kindly deed's most kindly done       In secret wrought, and seen of none.    And so"]]]
