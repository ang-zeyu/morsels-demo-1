In the beginning God made the heaven and the earth He also made the  sun, moon, and stars; trees, flowers, and all vegetable life; and all  animals, birds, fishes, and insects. Then God made man. The name of  the first man was Adam, and the first woman was Eve. Both were placed  in a beautiful garden called the Garden of Eden, where they might have  been happy continually had they not sinned. But God forbade them to  eat of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Satan  tempted Eve to take the fruit of this tree. She ate, and gave to Adam,  and he ate also. Thus they sinned, and sin came into the world.    Then God called to Adam and said, \"Where art thou?\" Before this, Adam  and Eve had been happy when God was near, now they were afraid. Why?  Because they knew they had done wrong. So sin makes us afraid of God.    God rebuked them for the evil they had done; and then drove them out  of the Garden of Eden, placing an angel to keep watch over the gate so  that they could not return.          CAIN AND ABEL.      What a sad story the Bible tells us in the fourth chapter of Genesis!  Cain and Abel were brothers, the sons of Adam and Eve. How they should  have loved each other! Yet we find that Cain killed Abel. Why did he  do this?    Cain was a husbandman, who tilled the ground; Abel was a shepherd, who  kept sheep. One day each offered a sacrifice to God. Cain brought  fruit, and Abel brought a lamb. God accepted Abel's offering, but not  Cain's. Why? Well, I am not quite sure, but I think it was because  Abel offered his sacrifice according as God had commanded, and had  faith in a promised Saviour; but Cain simply acknowledged God's  goodness in giving him the fruits of the earth. God had probably told  them, too, that when they came to worship Him, they were to bring a  lamb or a kid as a sacrifice for their sins; this Abel had done, but  Cain had not. Cain was angry because God had accepted Abel's offering  and not his; and he hated his brother Abel.    God knew the evil thought Cain had towards his brother, and asked him,  \"Why art thou wroth?\" and said, \"If thou doest well, shalt thou not be  accepted?\" But Cain did still more wickedly. When out in the field he  killed his brother. Was it not a cruel deed? They were alone when this  murder was committed, yet one eye saw it all. God saw it, and said to  Cain: \"Where is Abel, thy brother?\" We cannot sin without God knowing  it! Cain told God a lie. He answered, \"I know not.\" But he did know.  God was angry with Cain for his sin, and sent him as a fugitive and  vagabond to wander on the earth.    [Illustration: ABEL'S SACRIFICE.]          THE FLOOD.      About fifteen hundred years had passed since Cain slew Abel, during  which time man had become more and more wicked. At length God saw  \"that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every  imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.\"  Then God said, \"I will destroy man whom I have created from the face  of the earth.\"    But one man was righteous and served God. His name was Noah. God told  him that the world would be drowned by a flood because of the  wickedness of the people, and commanded him to build a great ark to  float upon the waters. In this ark God promised to preserve alive Noah  and his family; and also two of each of every living thing on the  earth--animals, birds, and creeping things. All the rest were to die.    Noah built the ark as God commanded. It took him a great many years,  during which time the people were warned to forsake their sins and  turn to God, but they did not do so. At last the ark was finished, and  Noah, with his wife, and his sons with their wives, and the animals,  birds, and creeping things, as God had commanded, all entered into it.  What a long procession it must have been! Then God shut them in, and  they dwelt in safety while the rain came down, and the waters rose up  and covered the earth. All were drowned except those in the ark.    A year afterwards, when the waters were dried up, Noah, and all that  had been with him, left the ark. Then Noah built an altar, and offered  sacrifices to God, in thankfulness for God's goodness to him and his  family.    [Illustration: ENTERING THE ARK.]          THE TOWER OF BABEL.      Babel means confusion. Was it not a strange name to give a tower? How  did it get this?    After Noah left the ark, God made a promise to him that He would no  more destroy the earth by a flood, and blessed him and his sons. In  course of time many little children were born, baby boys and girls,  who grew up to be fathers and mothers having children also. In this  manner a great many people dwelt again on the earth. For more than one  hundred years they all spoke the same language, and as, in course of  time, they journeyed onward, they came to a large plain in the land of  Shinar, near to where Babylon was afterwards built. Here they said  they would remain and build a great city, with a high tower ascending  to heaven.    Now God, when he blessed Noah, had said to him, \"Be fruitful, and  multiply, and replenish the earth;\" meaning that the people were to  scatter abroad, so that the world might become inhabited again. But  these men wanted to keep together, and found one great empire, the  centre of which should be the great city with the lofty tower. So they  made bricks and burnt them, and took a kind of pitch for mortar, and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17163"],[0,"Mother Stories from the New Testament (#1)"],[1,"the Online Distributed Proofreading Team at  https://www.pgdp.net                [Illustration: Front Cover]    [Illustration: LITTLE ONES SHOULD BE BROUGHT TO HIM.]          MOTHER    STORIES    FROM THE NEW TESTAMENT      A Book of the Best Stories from the  New Testament That Mothers  Can Tell Their Children      With Forty-five Illustrations    PHILADELPHIA  HENRY ALTEMUS COMPANY            ALTEMUS' MOTHER STORIES SERIES           *       *       *       *       *    MOTHER STORIES  A Book of the Best Stories that Mothers can tell their Children    MOTHER NURSERY RHYMES AND TALES  A Book of the Best Nursery Rhymes and Tales that Mothers can tell  their Children    MOTHER FAIRY TALES  A Book of the Best Fairy Tales that Mothers can tell their Children    MOTHER NATURE STORIES  A Book of the Best Nature Stories that Mothers can tell their Children    MOTHER STORIES FROM THE OLD TESTAMENT  A Book of the Best Old Testament Stories that Mothers can tell their  Children    MOTHER STORIES FROM THE NEW TESTAMENT  A Book of the Best New Testament Stories that Mothers can tell their  Children    MOTHER BEDTIME STORIES  A Book of the Best Bedtime Stories that Mothers can tell their  Children    MOTHER ANIMAL STORIES  A Book of the Best Animal Stories that Mothers can tell their Children    MOTHER BIRD STORIES  A Book of the Best Bird Stories that Mothers can tell their Children    MOTHER SANTA CLAUS STORIES  A Book of the Best Santa Claus Stories that Mothers can tell their  Children    Profusely illustrated and handsomely bound in cloth, with  ornamentation in colors    $1.00 PER VOLUME      COPYRIGHT 1906 BY HOWARD E.

The birth of Jesus Christ was announced by two remarkable events: the  coming of wise men from the East, and the appearance of angels to some  shepherds at Bethlehem.    The wise men were probably astronomers; and in watching the stars they  had seen one that had led them to leave their own country, and take a  long journey to Jerusalem. Most likely they rode on camels, and their  journey was a tedious one. But at last they reached Jerusalem, where  they inquired saying, \"Where is He that is born King of the Jews? for  we have seen His star in the East and are come to worship Him.\"  Tidings of these inquiries were brought to King Herod, and when he  heard them he was much troubled. He was a wicked king; and feared that  if another king had been born, he would grow up and take the crown  away. Herod was also cruel and treacherous, and while pretending to  act rightly, often did many evil things. And now he intended to  destroy the infant King, who might one day take his sceptre away.    So he first sent for the learned men of the Jews, the chief priests  and scribes, and demanded of them where Christ should be born; and  when they had replied that it was to be in Bethlehem, he secretly  called the wise men before him, and inquired of them what time the  star appeared. After getting the information he needed, he dismissed  the wise men, bidding them to go to Bethlehem \"and search diligently  for the young child; and when ye have found Him,\" said Herod, \"bring  me word again, that I may come and worship Him also.\"    So the wise men left King Herod and Jerusalem, and journeyed onward  towards Bethlehem; and the star which they had seen in the East went  before them, till it came and stood over where the young child lay.  And when they saw the star they rejoiced with exceeding great joy, for  they knew they had found Him whom they had come so far to seek.    But the wise men did not bring Herod word where Jesus was; and he was  so angry that shortly afterwards he sent his soldiers, and slew all  the children under two years of age that were in Bethlehem and its  neighbourhood. He thought by so doing to kill Jesus among them, but  God prevented him from doing so.    [Illustration: THE WISE MEN BEFORE THE KING.]          THE ANGEL'S TIDINGS.      It was night. In the fields near Bethlehem a company of shepherds kept  watch over their flocks. Probably they were holy men, and often  thought of God in the stillness of the early morn. And now they may  have been thinking of the coming of the promised Messiah.    While watching their flocks, the angel of the Lord came to these  shepherds, and a dazzling light shone round about them. They were much  afraid; but the angel said, \"Fear not; for behold I bring you good  tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people. For unto you is  born this day in the city of David a Saviour, which is Christ the  Lord.\" And suddenly there was with the angel a great multitude of the  heavenly host praising God and saying, \"Glory to God in the highest,  and on earth peace, good will toward men.\"    When the angels had departed, the shepherds returned to Bethlehem; and  there, in a stable, they found the infant Jesus, lying in a manger,  watched over and cared for by His mother Mary and Joseph. And so great  was the surprise and joy of the shepherds that they went out and told  all they met of the wondrous things which they had seen.    Shortly after the visit of the shepherds, the wise men from the East  reached Bethlehem, and in a house they found Joseph, and Mary, and  Jesus. Then they fell down and worshipped Jesus, opening the treasures  they had brought, and offering Him precious gifts, gold and  frankincense and myrrh. But God warned them not to go back to Herod,  to tell him where the new-born King of the Jews was, and they returned  to their own country another way.    [Illustration: THE SHEPHERDS WORSHIPPING THE INFANT JESUS.]          JESUS IN THE TEMPLE.      When Jesus was twelve years of age, His parents took Him with them to  Jerusalem to the feast of the Passover. Great numbers journeyed from  different parts to keep this feast; and travelled in companies or  caravans, the women and old men riding on asses or mules, and the rest  going on foot. Thus Joseph and Mary, with Jesus, left Nazareth, and  with many others journeyed to Jerusalem, where they kept the Passover.    When the feast was ended, as they returned homewards, Joseph and Mary  discovered that Jesus was missing; but supposing Him to have been  somewhere among the company, they continued their first day's short  journey. When, however, evening came, and the caravan halted, and  Jesus was nowhere to be found, His parents sorrowfully returned to  Jerusalem seeking Him. At last, on the third day, they went to the  Temple, and found Jesus sitting in the midst of the aged and learned  Jewish doctors, both hearing them and asking them questions. \"And all  that heard Him were astonished at His understanding and answers.\"    His parents were amazed when they saw Jesus in such company. But Mary,  while she rejoiced at finding Him, gently said, \"Son, why hast Thou  thus dealt with us? Behold Thy father and I have sought Thee  sorrowing.\" Jesus replied, \"How is it that ye"]]]
