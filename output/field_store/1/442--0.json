BY DR. WASHINGTON MATTHEWS.      Sec. I. The art of weaving, as it exists among the Navajo Indians of New  Mexico and Arizona, possesses points of great interest to the student  of ethnography. It is of aboriginal origin; and while European art has  undoubtedly modified it, the extent and nature of the foreign  influence is easily traced. It is by no means certain, still there are  many reasons for supposing, that the Navajos learned their craft from  the Pueblo Indians, and that, too, since the advent of the Spaniards;  yet the pupils, if such they be, far excel their masters to-day in the  beauty and quality of their work. It may be safely stated that with no  native tribe in America, north of the Mexican boundary, has the art of  weaving been carried to greater perfection than among the Navajos,  while with none in the entire continent is it less Europeanized. As in  language, habits, and opinions, so in arts, the Navajos have been less  influenced than their sedentary neighbors of the pueblos by the  civilization of the Old World.    The superiority of the Navajo to the Pueblo work results not only from  a constant advance of the weaver's art among the former, but from a  constant deterioration of it among the latter. The chief cause of this  deterioration is that the Pueblos find it more remunerative to buy, at  least the finer _serapes_, from the Navajos, and give their time to  other pursuits, than to manufacture for themselves; they are nearer  the white settlements and can get better prices for their produce;  they give more attention to agriculture; they have within their  country, mines of turquoise which the Navajos prize, and they have no  trouble in procuring whisky, which some of the Navajos prize even more  than gems. Consequently, while the wilder Indian has incentives to  improve his art, the more advanced has many temptations to abandon it  altogether. In some pueblos the skill of the loom has been almost  forgotten. A growing fondness for European clothing has also had its  influence, no doubt.    Sec. II. Cotton, which grows well in New Mexico and Arizona, the tough  fibers of yucca leaves and the fibers of other plants, the hair of  different quadrupeds, and the down of birds furnished in prehistoric  days the materials of textile fabrics in this country. While some of  the Pueblos still weave their native cotton to a slight extent, the  Navajos grow no cotton and spin nothing but the wool of the domestic  sheep, which animal is, of course, of Spanish introduction, and of  which the Navajos have vast herds.    The wool is not washed until it is sheared. At the present time it is  combed with hand cards purchased from the Americans. In spinning, the  simplest form of the spindle--a slender stick thrust through the  center of a round wooden disk--is used. The Mexicans on the Rio Grande  use spinning-wheels, and although the Navajos have often seen these  wheels, have had abundant opportunities for buying and stealing them,  and possess, I think, sufficient ingenuity to make them, they have  never abandoned the rude implement of their ancestors. Plate XXXIV  illustrates the Navajo method of handling the spindle, a method  different from that of the people of Zuni.    They still employ to a great extent their native dyes: of yellow,  reddish, and black. There is good evidence that they formerly had a  blue dye; but indigo, originally introduced, I think, by the Mexicans,  has superseded this. If they, in former days, had a native blue and a  native yellow, they must also, of course, have had a green, and they  now make green of their native yellow and indigo, the latter being the  only imported dye-stuff I have ever seen in use among them. Besides  the hues above indicated, this people have had, ever since the  introduction of sheep, wool of three different natural colors--white,  rusty black, and gray--so they had always a fair range of tints with  which to execute their artistic designs. The brilliant red figures in  their finer blankets were, a few years ago, made entirely of _bayeta_,  and this material is still largely used. Bayeta is a bright scarlet  cloth with a long nap, much finer in appearance than the scarlet  strouding which forms such an important article in the Indian trade of  the North. It was originally brought to the Navajo country from  Mexico, but is now supplied to the trade from our eastern cities. The  Indians ravel it and use the weft. While many handsome blankets are  still made only of the colors and material above described, American  yarn has lately become very popular among the Navajos, and many fine  blankets are now made wholly, or in part, of Germantown wool.    The black dye mentioned above is made of the twigs and leaves of the  aromatic sumac (_Rhus aromatica_), a native yellow ocher, and the gum  of the pinon (_Pinus edulis_). The process of preparing it is as  follows: They put into a pot of water some of the leaves of the sumac,  and as many of the branchlets as can be crowded in without much  breaking or crushing, and the water is allowed to boil for five or six  hours until a strong decoction is made. While the water is boiling  they attend to other parts of the process. The ocher is reduced to a  fine powder between two stones and then slowly roasted over the fire  in an earthen or metal vessel until it assumes a light-brown color; it  is then taken from the fire and combined with about an equal quantity  in size of pinon gum; again the mixture is put on the fire and  constantly stirred. At first the gum melts and the whole mass assumes  a mushy consistency; but as the roasting progresses it gradually  becomes drier and darker until it is at last reduced to a fine black  powder. This is removed from the fire, and when it has cooled  somewhat it is thrown into the decoction of sumac, with which it  instantly forms a rich, blue-black fluid. This dye is essentially an  ink, the tannic acid of the sumac combining with the sesquioxide of  iron in the roasted ocher, the whole enriched by the carbon of the  calcined gum.    [Illustration: PL. XXXIV.--NAVAJO WOMAN SPINNING.]    There are, the Indians tell me, three different processes for dyeing  yellow; two of these I have witnessed. The first process is thus  conducted: The flowering tops of _Bigelovia graveolens_ are boiled for  about six hours until a decoction of deep yellow color is produced.  When the dyer thinks the decoction strong enough, she heats over the  fire in a pan or earthen vessel some native almogen (an impure native  alum), until it is reduced to a somewhat pasty consistency; this she  adds gradually to the decoction and then puts the wool in the dye to  boil. From time to time a portion of the wool is taken out and  inspected until (in about half an hour from the time it is first  immersed) it is seen to have assumed the proper color. The work is  then done. The tint produced is nearly that of lemon yellow. In the  second process they use the large, fleshy root of a plant which, as I  have never yet seen it in fruit or flower, I am unable to determine.  The fresh root is crushed to a soft paste on the _metate_, and, for a  mordant, the almogen is added while the grinding is going on. The cold  paste is then rubbed between the hands into the wool. If the wool does  not seem to take the color readily a little water is dashed on the  mixture of wool and paste, and the whole is very slightly warmed. The  entire process does not occupy over an hour and the result is a color  much like that now known as \"old gold.\"    The reddish dye is made of the bark of _Alnus incana_ var. _virescens_  (Watson) and the bark of the root of _Cercocarpus parvifolius_; the  mordant being fine juniper ashes.

It is hoped that the following historical account of the discovery,  partial utilization, and almost complete extermination of the great  American bison may serve to cause the public to fully realize the folly  of allowing all our most valuable and interesting American mammals to be  wantonly destroyed in the same manner. The wild buffalo is practically  gone forever, and in a few more years, when the whitened bones of the  last bleaching skeleton shall have been picked up and shipped East for  commercial uses, nothing will remain of him save his old, well-worn  trails along the water-courses, a few museum specimens, and regret for  his fate. If his untimely end fails even to point a moral that shall  benefit the surviving species of mammals _which are now being  slaughtered in like manner_, it will be sad indeed.    Although _Bison americanus_ is a true bison, according to scientific  classification, and not a buffalo, the fact that more than sixty  millions of people in this country unite in calling him a \"buffalo,\" and  know him by no other name, renders it quite unnecessary for me to  apologize for following, in part, a harmless custom which has now become  so universal that all the naturalists in the world could not change it  if they would.    W. T. H.    THE EXTERMINATION OF THE AMERICAN BISON,    By WILLIAM T. HORNADAY,    _Superintendent of the National Zoological Park._          PART I.--LIFE HISTORY OF THE BISON.          I. DISCOVERY OF THE SPECIES.      The discovery of the American bison, as first made by Europeans,  occurred in the menagerie of a heathen king.    In the year 1521, when Cortez reached Anahuac, the American bison was  seen for the first time by civilized Europeans, if we may be permitted  to thus characterize the horde of blood thirsty plunder seekers who  fought their way to the Aztec capital. With a degree of enterprise that  marked him as an enlightened monarch, Montezuma maintained, for the  instruction of his people, a well-appointed menagerie, of which the  historian De Solis wrote as follows (1724):    \"In the second Square of the same House were the Wild Beasts, which were  either presents to Montezuma, or taken by his Hunters, in strong Cages  of Timber, rang'd in good Order, and under Cover: Lions, Tygers, Bears,  and all others of the savage Kind which New-Spain produced; among which  the greatest Rarity was the Mexican Bull; a wonderful composition of  divers Animals. It has crooked Shoulders, with a Bunch on its Back like  a Camel; its Flanks dry, its Tail large, and its Neck cover'd with Hair  like a Lion. It is cloven footed, its Head armed like that of a Bull,  which it resembles in Fierceness, with no less strength and Agility.\"    Thus was the first seen buffalo described. The nearest locality from  whence it could have come was the State of Coahuila, in northern Mexico,  between 400 and 500 miles away, and at that time vehicles were unknown  to the Aztecs. But for the destruction of the whole mass of the written  literature of the Aztecs by the priests of the Spanish Conquest, we  might now be reveling in historical accounts of the bison which would  make the oldest of our present records seem of comparatively recent  date.    Nine years after the event referred to above, or in 1530, another  Spanish explorer, Alvar Nuñez Cabeza, afterwards called Cabeza de  Vaca--or, in other words \"Cattle Cabeza,\" the prototype of our own  distinguished \"Buffalo Bill\"--was wrecked on the Gulf coast, west of  the delta of the Mississippi, from whence he wandered westward through  what is now the State of Texas. In southeastern Texas he discovered the  American bison on his native heath. So far as can be ascertained, this  was the earliest discovery of the bison in a wild state, and the  description of the species as recorded by the explorer is of historical  interest. It is brief and superficial. The unfortunate explorer took  very little interest in animated nature, except as it contributed to the  sum of his daily food, which was then the all-important subject of his  thoughts. He almost starved. This is all he has to say:[1]    [Note 1: Davis' Spanish Conquest of New Mexico. 1869. P. 67.]    \"Cattle come as far as this. I have seen them three times, and eaten of  their meat. I think they are about the size of those in Spain. They have  small horns like those of Morocco, and the hair long and flocky, like  that of the merino. Some are light brown (_pardillas_) and others black.  To my judgment the flesh is finer and sweeter than that of this country  [Spain]. The Indians make blankets of those that are not full grown, and  of the larger they make shoes and bucklers. They come as far as the  sea-coast of Florida [now Texas], and in a direction from the north, and  range over a district of more than 400 leagues. In the whole extent of  plain over which they roam, the people who live bordering upon it  descend and kill them for food, and thus a great many skins are  scattered throughout the country.\"    Coronado was the next explorer who penetrated the country of the  buffalo, which he accomplished from the west, by way of Arizona and New  Mexico. He crossed the southern part of the \"Pan-handle\" of Texas, to  the edge of what is now the Indian Territory, and returned through the  same region. It was in the year 1542 that he reached the buffalo  country, and traversed the plains that were \"full of crooke-backed oxen,  as the mountaine Serena in Spaine is of sheepe.\" This is the description  of the animal as recorded by one of his followers, Castañeda, and  translated by W. W. Davis:[2]    [Note 2: The Spanish Conquest of New Mexico. Davis. 1869. Pp. 206-7.]    \"The first time we encountered the buffalo, all the horses took to  flight on seeing them, for they are horrible to the sight.    \"They have a broad and short face, eyes two palms from each other, and  projecting in such a manner sideways that they can see a pursuer. Their  beard is like that of goats, and so long that it drags the ground when  they lower the head. They have, on the anterior portion of the body, a  frizzled hair like sheep's wool; it is very fine upon the croup, and  sleek like a lion's mane. Their horns are very short and thick, and can  scarcely be seen"]]]
