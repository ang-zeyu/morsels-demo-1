They would have thought there was magic in the brush and pencil.    Surely we are favoured in this generation when we see before us, the  old, old fairy tales, which are ever new, dressed in such a beautiful  and splendid fashion!    _EDRIC VREDENBURG._    [Illustration: From \"HANSEL AND GRETHEL\"]          [Illustration]    THE GOOSE GIRL      An old queen, whose husband had been dead some years, had a beautiful  daughter. When she grew up, she was betrothed to a prince who lived  a great way off; and as the time drew near for her to be married, she  got ready to set off on her journey to his country. Then the queen,  her mother, packed up a great many costly things--jewels, and gold,  and silver; trinkets, fine dresses, and, in short, everything that  became a royal bride; for she loved her child very dearly: and she  gave her a waiting-maid to ride with her, and give her into the  bridegroom's hands; and each had a horse for the journey. Now the  princess's horse was called Falada, and could speak.    When the time came for them to set out, the old queen went into her  bed-chamber, and took a little knife, and cut off a lock of her hair,  and gave it to her daughter, and said, \"Take care of it, dear child;  for it is a charm that may be of use to you on the road.\" Then they  took a sorrowful leave of each other, and the princess put the lock of  her mother's hair into her bosom, got upon her horse, and set off on  her journey to her bridegroom's kingdom. One day, as they were riding  along by the side of a brook, the princess began to feel very thirsty,  and said to her maid, \"Pray get down and fetch me some water, in my  golden cup, out of yonder brook, for I want to drink.\" \"Nay,\" said  the maid, \"if you are thirsty, get down yourself, and lie down by the  water and drink; I shall not be your waiting-maid any longer.\" Then  the princess was so thirsty that she got down, and knelt over the  brook and drank, for she was frightened, and dared not bring out her  golden cup; and then she wept, and said \"Alas! what will become of  me?\" And the lock of hair answered her, and said--          \"Alas! alas! if thy mother knew it,        Sadly, sadly her heart would rue it.\"    But the princess was very humble and meek, so she said nothing to her  maid's ill behaviour, but got upon her horse again.    Then all rode further on their journey, till the day grew so warm, and  the sun so scorching, that the bride began to feel very thirsty again;  and at last, when they came to a river, she forgot her maid's rude  speech, and said, \"Pray get down and fetch me some water to drink  in my golden cup.\" But the maid answered her, and even spoke more  haughtily than before, \"Drink, if you will, but I shall not be your  waiting-maid.\" Then the princess was so thirsty that she got off her  horse and lay down, and held her head over the running stream, and  cried, and said, \"What will become of me?\" And the lock of hair  answered her again--          \"Alas! alas! if thy mother knew it,        Sadly, sadly her heart would rue it.\"    And as she leaned down to drink, the lock of hair fell from her bosom  and floated away with the water, without her seeing it, she was so  frightened. But her maid saw it, and was very glad, for she knew the  charm, and saw that the poor bride would be in her power now that she  had lost the hair. So when the bride had drunk, and would have got  upon Falada again, the maid said, \"I shall ride upon Falada and you  may have my horse instead;\" so she was forced to give up her horse,  and soon afterwards to take off her royal clothes, and put on her  maid's shabby ones.    At last, as they drew near the end of the journey, this treacherous  servant threatened to kill her mistress if she ever told anyone what  had happened. But Falada saw it all, and marked it well. Then the  waiting-maid got upon Falada, and the real bride was set upon the  other horse, and they went on in this way till at last they came  to the royal court. There was great joy at their coming, the prince  hurried to meet them, and lifted the maid from her horse, thinking she  was the one who was to be his wife; and she was led upstairs to the  royal chamber, but the true princess was told to stay in the court  below.    [Illustration]    But the old king happened to be looking out of the window, and saw her  in the yard below; and as she looked very pretty, and too delicate for  a waiting-maid, he went into the royal chamber to ask the bride who it  was she had brought with her, that was thus left standing in the  court below. \"I brought her with me for the sake of her company on the  road,\" said she. \"Pray give the girl some work to do, that she may not  be idle.\" The old king could not for some time think of any work for  her to do, but at last he said, \"I have a lad who takes care of my  geese; she may go and help him.\" Now the name of this lad, that the  real bride was to help in watching the king's geese, was Curdken.    Soon after, the false bride said to the prince, \"Dear husband pray do  me one piece of kindness.\" \"That I will,\" said the prince. \"Then tell  one of your slaughterers to cut off the head of the horse I rode upon,  for it was very unruly, and plagued me sadly on the road.\" But the  truth was, she was very much afraid lest Falada should speak, and  tell all she had done to the princess. She carried her point, and the  faithful Falada was killed; but when the true princess heard of it she  wept, and begged the man to nail up Falada's head against a large  dark gate in the city through which she had to pass every morning  and evening, that there she might still see him sometimes. Then the  slaughterer said he would do as she wished; cut off the head, and  nailed it fast under the dark gate.    Early the next morning, as she and Curdken went out through the gate,  she said sorrowfully--          \"Falada, Falada, there thou art hanging!\"    and the head answered--          \"Bride, bride, there thou art ganging!        Alas! alas! if thy mother knew it,        Sadly, sadly her heart would rue it.\"    Then they went out of the city, and drove the geese in. And when she  came to the meadow, she sat down upon a bank here, and let down her  waving locks of hair, which were all of pure gold; and when Curdken  saw it glitter in the sun, he ran up, and would have pulled some of  the locks out; but she cried--          \"Blow, breezes, blow!        Let Curdken's hat go!        Blow, breezes, blow!        Let him after it go!        O'er hills, dales, and rocks.        Away be it whirl'd,        Till the golden locks        Are all comb'd and curl'd!\"    [Illustration]    Then there came a wind, so strong that it blew off Curdken's hat, and  away it flew over the hills, and he after it; till, by the time he  came back, she had done combing and curling her hair, and put it up  again safe. Then he was very angry and sulky, and would not speak  to her at all; but they watched the geese until it grew dark in the  evening, and then drove them homewards.    The next morning, as they were going through the dark gate, the poor  girl looked up at Falada's head, and cried--          \"Falada, Falada, there thou art hanging!\"    and it answered--          \"Bride, bride, there thou art ganging!        Alas! alas! if thy mother knew it,        Sadly, sadly her heart would rue it.\"    Then she drove on the geese and sat down again in the meadow, and  began to comb out her hair as before, and Curdken ran up to her, and  wanted to take hold of it; but she cried out quickly--          \"Blow, breezes, blow!        Let Curdken's hat go,        Blow, breezes, blow!        Let him after it go!        O'er hills, dales, and rocks,        Away be it whirl'd,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15147"],[0,"Beeton's Book of Needlework (#1)"],[1,"Team.

Day by day, it increases  its votaries, who enlarge and develop its various branches, so that any  addition and assistance in teaching or learning Needlework will be  welcomed by the Daughters of England, \"wise of heart,\" who work  diligently with their hands.    The recent introduction of Point Lace has brought a finer, and,  apparently, more difficult class of fancy work into general favour.  Ladies may now, however, confidently commence, with our patterns before  them, to reproduce Antique laces; for care and patience, with a  knowledge of Point Lace stitches, are alone required to perfect the  beautiful work, which, as shown in existing specimens of exquisite Old  Lace, constitute the chief glory of women's refined industry in past  centuries.    INSTRUCTIONS in TATTING, in EMBROIDERY, in CROCHET, in KNITTING and  NETTING, in BERLIN WOOL WORK, in POINT LACE, and GUIPURE D'ART are  prefixed to the pages devoted to these separate branches of needlework.  The whole work is interspersed with coloured and other Patterns in Point  Lace, Guipure d'Art, Tatting, Embroidery, and Designs for Monograms and  Initials for marking handkerchiefs and table-linen. The quantity of  materials required for each class of work is also given with every  pattern.    The idea of combining a series of minute and exact instructions in fancy  needlework with useful patterns was conceived some years ago by one  whose life was devoted to the inculcation of the practical duties of  woman's life, and to assisting her sex in their daily work of HOUSEHOLD  MANAGEMENT and REFINEMENT.    Her great wish was that her BOOK OF NEEDLEWORK should be as valuable in  its way to her Countrywomen as her work upon Household Management was  useful in showing the best mode of providing for the diurnal wants of  families. Other hands have brought to a conclusion her original plans.  The best attainable workers have contributed to this volume. Only those  who knew the extent of the late Mrs. Beeton's design, will miss, in the  pages now before them, \"the touch of a vanished hand.\"    S.O.B.    _Paternoster Row,_ 1870.

TATTING      INSTRUCTIONS    [Illustration: Tatting Shuttle.]    The needlework called Tatting in England, _Frivolite_ in French, and  _Frivolitaeten_ in German, is a work which seems, from all accounts, to  have been in favour several generations ago. Modern ingenuity has  discovered some ways of improving on the original plan of tatting, which  was, indeed, rather a primitive sort of business as first practised. To  Mrs. Mee, one of our most accomplished _artistes_ in all matters  connected with the work-table, belongs, we believe, the introduction of  the plan of working from the reel instead of the shuttle. By this  alteration the advantage of the shuttle being constantly kept filled  with cotton was gained, and the necessity also obviated for frequently  joining the thread; and to Mdlle. Riego, equally distinguished in all  details appertaining to the employment of the needle, ladies are  indebted for an arrangement by which the same thread used in the making  of the pattern is used for fastening the work. The old plan only  provided for the working of the different portions which constituted the  pattern, and then these portions had to be sewn together with a needle  and thread. The ingenious workers on the Continent have also given much  attention of late to the art of tatting, and our instructions now  printed comprise what we consider the best mode of learning and doing  this exceedingly interesting and fashionable work.    [Illustration: Tatting Pin.]    Tatting differs entirely from crochet, and is composed of stitches  forming _knots_. It is intended as an imitation of point lace, and is  especially used for trimming under-linen, on account of its strength.    To make the stitches or knots a small instrument is used, called a  _shuttle_. This shuttle consists of two oval pieces, flat on one side  and convex on the other, and is made of wood or ivory.    The two oval pieces are joined together by a strong cross-piece. The  illustration shows the construction of the shuttle. These shuttles are  made in ivory, pearl, tortoiseshell inlaid with pearl, and silver; they  are also manufactured in coloured bone, black, red, and white. The best  to work with are the pearl for a white shuttle, and the inlaid  tortoiseshell for a black shuttle; the prices vary from sixpence to one  shilling and two-and-sixpence each. In selecting a shuttle be careful to  see that the ends close, as if dropped it soon becomes unthreaded, which  is very inconvenient. The cotton intended for the work is wound round  this shuttle, and the thickness of the cotton varies according to the  style of work. It is better to use the proper tatting cotton, because it  is stronger than the ordinary kinds; this is manufactured by Messrs.  Walter Evans and Co. for the purpose. Their Boar's Head Cotton is also  frequently used, and answers very well.      _Shuttles._    These are made in 3 sizes:--Finest, No. 1; No. 2, useful medium size;  No. 3, the largest.      _The Way to Hold the Hands._    Take the shuttle in the right hand, between the thumb and second finger,  and allow the forefinger to remain at liberty, and rest the under part  of the shuttle _between_ the second and third and _on_ the middle  finger. Place the thread round the three middle fingers of the left  hand, so as to form a loop, keeping the second and third fingers a  little apart, and bring the cotton again between the thumb and  forefinger, letting the end fall within the palm of the hand, while the  end of cotton which holds on to the shuttle passes over the thumb-nail.      _To Make a Stitch._    Keep the hands in the position above described; pass the shuttle at the  back, through the loop--that is, between the second and third fingers.  Take the end of the shuttle which comes out from the loop between the  forefinger and thumb of the right hand, and strain the cotton very  tightly towards the right. When the cotton is drawn through the loop,  this cotton must not be impeded by the fourth finger; it should, on the  contrary, slide over it, and be drawn tight. It should divide the loop  into two parts. After this withdraw the second left-hand finger, which  is _above_ the cotton, and pass it again under that cotton, so as to  draw up the loop. A _half-stitch_ is thus formed, and must be tightened  by being drawn closely to the forefinger and thumb of the left hand. For  the remaining half of the stitch keep the hands in the same position,  but, instead of letting the cotton fall over the thumb, pass this cotton  over the back of the hand; then let the shuttle fall between the second  and third fingers of the left hand, in front, and take it out again at  the back, strain the cotton very tightly, withdraw the second finger  from the loop, letting the cotton which is behind the hand sweep over  the fingers. When this is done, guide with the unoccupied fingers of the  left hand this second half-stitch up to the other, thus completing _one  stitch_.      _The Way to Make a Loop in Tatting._    When a certain number of stitches are made, very tightly draw in the  loop by straining the cotton until the first stitch touches the last,  and thus a loop is formed. During this process the stitches should be  held tightly between the forefinger and thumb.      _The Way to Make a Purl._    A _purl_ is a small loop of cotton often used as an edging in tatting,  as, for instance, round the outer edge of the ovals in tatted insertion  No. 2. The following is the easiest method of making a purl:--The  stitches are not made quite closely together at the place where a purl  is to be made; about one-sixth of an inch is left between each. This  space is left free until the loop is made by uniting the stitches; then  the small piece of cotton in the space bulges out between the stitches,  and forms the purl. If several are required a small space is left  between every two or three stitches, according to the desired number.  Care must be taken in that case that the small pieces of cotton left be  all of the same length, so that the purl may be perfectly even. The purl  can also be made thus: At the same time with the end of thread take the  tatting-pin or a very large darning needle or knitting needle in the  left hand, so that the point may come out"]]]
