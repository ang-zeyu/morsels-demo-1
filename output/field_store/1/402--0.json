They have to some degree stimulated and nourished qualities  of supreme worth in individual and social life. With the young the  struggle against greed and falsehood and pride and cowardice is a very  real one, and situations in which these homely, fundamental traits are  involved are full of interest and seriousness. Again, to mature people  the reward of well-doing and the punishment of evil conduct portrayed in  these stories are apt to seem too realistic, too much also on the  cut-and-dried pattern; but it is far different with children. They have  a very concrete sense of right and wrong, and they demand a clear,  explicit, tangible outcome for every sort of action. They must have  concrete, living examples, with the appropriate outcome of each, set  before them.    A modest, faithful child will be strengthened in his good qualities;  while one lacking these will have them aroused, to some extent at any  rate, by following Cinderella in her career. Arrogance and selfishness  come to unhappy straits in this fancy world, and they are likely to  fare the same in the real world; so it would be better to part company  with them, and take up with gentleness and kindliness and faithfulness  instead. And every one may be of some help to others if he be only of  the right mind. The brother who thought himself faring badly with only a  cat for a legacy learns betimes that even so small and apparently  helpless a creature may be of much service when he is rightly disposed.  A person might think little Thumb could accomplish nothing of value to  any one, but he again teaches the child that all depends on the  willingness to be of assistance, the good-heartedness, the  fellow-feeling which one has for others.    In making this version anew the translator has endeavored to retain the  characteristics of the style of the early chap-book versions, while  evading the pompous, stilted language and Johnsonian phraseology so  fashionable when they were first translated.      M.V. O'SHEA.    UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN.            The Tales of Mother Goose.          CINDERELLA, OR THE LITTLE GLASS SLIPPER.      Once upon a time there was a gentleman who married, for his second wife,  the proudest and most haughty woman that ever was seen. She had two  daughters of her own, who were, indeed, exactly like her in all things.  The gentleman had also a young daughter, of rare goodness and sweetness  of temper, which she took from her mother, who was the best creature in  the world.    The wedding was scarcely over, when the stepmother's bad temper began to  show itself. She could not bear the goodness of this young girl, because  it made her own daughters appear the more odious. The stepmother gave  her the meanest work in the house to do; she had to scour the dishes,  tables, etc., and to scrub the floors and clean out the bedrooms. The  poor girl had to sleep in the garret, upon a wretched straw bed, while  her sisters lay in fine rooms with inlaid floors, upon beds of the very  newest fashion, and where they had looking-glasses so large that they  might see themselves at their full length. The poor girl bore all  patiently, and dared not complain to her father, who would have scolded  her if she had done so, for his wife governed him entirely.    When she had done her work, she used to go into the chimney corner, and  sit down among the cinders, hence she was called Cinderwench. The  younger sister of the two, who was not so rude and uncivil as the elder,  called her Cinderella. However, Cinderella, in spite of her mean  apparel, was a hundred times more handsome than her sisters, though they  were always richly dressed.    It happened that the King's son gave a ball, and invited to it all  persons of fashion. Our young misses were also invited, for they cut a  very grand figure among the people of the country-side. They were highly  delighted with the invitation, and wonderfully busy in choosing the  gowns, petticoats, and head-dresses which might best become them. This  made Cinderella's lot still harder, for it was she who ironed her  sisters' linen and plaited their ruffles. They talked all day long of  nothing but how they should be dressed.    \"For my part,\" said the elder, \"I will wear my red velvet suit with  French trimmings.\"    \"And I,\" said the younger, \"shall wear my usual skirt; but then, to make  amends for that I will put on my gold-flowered mantle, and my diamond  stomacher, which is far from being the most ordinary one in the world.\"  They sent for the best hairdressers they could get to make up their hair  in fashionable style, and bought patches for their cheeks. Cinderella  was consulted in all these matters, for she had good taste. She advised  them always for the best, and even offered her services to dress their  hair, which they were very willing she should do.    As she was doing this, they said to her:--    \"Cinderella, would you not be glad to go to the ball?\"    \"Young ladies,\" she said, \"you only jeer at me; it is not for such as I  am to go there.\"    \"You are right,\" they replied; \"people would laugh to see a Cinderwench  at a ball.\"    Any one but Cinderella would have dressed their hair awry, but she was  good-natured, and arranged it perfectly well. They were almost two days  without eating, so much were they transported with joy. They broke above  a dozen laces in trying to lace themselves tight, that they might have a  fine, slender shape, and they were continually at their looking-glass.    At last the happy day came; they went to Court, and Cinderella followed  them with her eyes as long as she could, and when she had lost sight of  them, she fell a-crying.    Her godmother, who saw her all in tears, asked her what was the matter.    \"I wish I could--I wish I could--\" but she could not finish for sobbing.    Her godmother, who was a fairy, said to her, \"You wish you could go to  the ball; is it not so?\"    \"Alas, yes,\" said Cinderella, sighing.    \"Well,\" said her godmother, \"be but a good girl, and I will see that you  go.\" Then she took her into her chamber, and said to her, \"Run into the  garden, and bring me a pumpkin.\"    Cinderella went at once to gather the finest she could get, and brought  it to her godmother, not being able to imagine how this pumpkin could  help her to go to the ball. Her godmother scooped out all the inside of  it, leaving nothing but the rind. Then she struck it with her wand, and  the pumpkin was instantly turned into a fine gilded coach.    She then went to look into the mouse-trap, where she found six mice, all  alive. She ordered Cinderella to lift the trap-door, when, giving each  mouse, as it went out, a little tap with her wand, it was that moment  turned into a fine horse, and the six mice made a fine set of six horses  of a beautiful mouse-colored, dapple gray.    Being at a loss for a coachman, Cinderella said, \"I will go and see if  there is not a rat in the rat-trap--we may make a coachman of him.\"    \"You are right,\" replied her godmother; \"go and look.\"    Cinderella brought the rat-trap to her, and in it there were three huge  rats. The fairy chose the one which had the largest beard, and, having  touched him with her wand, he was turned into a fat coachman with the  finest mustache and whiskers ever seen.    After that, she said to her:--    \"Go into the garden, and you will find six lizards behind the  watering-pot; bring them to me.\"    She had no sooner done so than her godmother turned them into six  footmen, who skipped up immediately behind the coach, with their  liveries all trimmed with gold and silver, and they held on as if they  had done nothing else their whole lives.    The fairy then said to Cinderella, \"Well, you see here a carriage fit to  go to the ball in; are you not pleased with it?\"    \"Oh, yes!\" she cried; \"but must I go as I am in these rags?\"    Her godmother simply touched her with her wand, and, at the same moment,  her clothes were turned "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17211"],[0,"A School History of the Great War (#1)"],[1,"SCHOOL HISTORY  OF THE GREAT WAR    BY    ALBERT E.

Its purpose is  to expand into an historical narrative the outline of the study of the  war which the authors prepared for the Board and which was published by  the United States Bureau of Education as Teachers' Leaflet No. 4, in  August, 1918. The arrangement of chapters and the choice of topics have  been largely determined by the various headings in the outline for the  course in grades seven and eight.    The authors trust that the simple presentation here given may aid in  developing a national comprehension of the issues involved in the war;  and they hope it may play some part in preparing the American people for  the solution of the great problems which lie immediately before us.

We must go back of the facts of to-day and find in  national history and personal ambition the causes of the present  struggle. Years of preparation were necessary before German military  leaders could convert a nation to their views, or get ready the men,  munitions, and transportation for the war they wanted. Conflicts of  races for hundreds of years have made the southeastern part of Europe a  firebrand in international affairs. The course of the Russian revolution  has been determined largely by the history of the Russian people and of  the Russian rulers during the past two centuries. The entrance of  England and Italy into the war against Germany was in each case brought  about by causes which came into existence long before August, 1914. A  person who understands, even in part, the causes of this great  struggle, will be in a better position to realize why America entered  the war and what our nation is fighting for. And better yet, he will be  more ready to take part in settling the many problems of peace which  must come after the war is over. For these reasons, the first few  chapters of this book are devoted to a study of the important facts of  recent European history.    [Illustration: EUROPE IN 1913]    A HUNDRED YEARS AGO.--It is remarkable that almost exactly a century  before the present world war, Europe was engaged in a somewhat similar  struggle to prevent an ambitious French general, Napoleon Bonaparte,  from becoming the ruler of all that continent, and of America as well.  He had conquered or intimidated nearly all the states of  Europe--Austria, Prussia, Russia, Spain, etc.--except Great Britain. He  once planned a great settlement on the Mississippi River, and so alarmed  President Jefferson that the latter said the United States might be  compelled to \"marry themselves to the British fleet and nation.\" But  England's navy kept control of the seas; Napoleon's colony in North  America was never founded; and at last the peoples of Europe rose  against their conqueror, and in the battle of Waterloo, June 18, 1815,  finally overthrew him.    EUROPE SINCE 1815.--After the downfall of Napoleon the rulers of  Europe met in conference at Vienna and sought to restore conditions as  they had been before the war. They were particularly anxious that the  great masses of the people in their several nations should continue to  respect what was termed \"the divine right of kings to rule over their  subjects.\" They did not, except in Great Britain, believe in  representative governments. They feared free speech and independent  newspapers and liberal educational institutions. They hated all kinds of  popular movements by which the inhabitants of any country might throw  off the monarch's yoke and secure a share in their own government. For  over thirty years the \"Holy Allies,\"--the name applied to the monarchs  of Austria, Prussia, and Russia,--succeeded tolerably well in keeping  the peoples in subjection. But they had many difficulties to face, and  after 1848 their policy was largely given up.    DEMOCRATIC MOVEMENTS.--During the nineteenth century the people of  Europe were restive under the rule of kings, and gradually governments  controlled in greater or less degree by the people were established.  Almost every decade saw popular uprisings in some of the European  states. About 1820 insurrections occurred in Greece, in Spain, and in  southern Italy; and the Spanish American colonies revolted from the  mother country. In 1830 popular uprisings took place in France, Belgium,  Germany, Poland, and other places. In 1848 a far more serious movement  occurred, which overthrew the French monarchy and established a  republic. From France the flame of liberty lighted fires of insurrection  in Germany, Austria, Poland, and Italy. Similar attempts were made at  later times. As a result of these popular uprisings and of the growing  education of all classes of the people, manhood suffrage and  representative institutions were established in most of the European  states.    NATIONAL ASPIRATIONS.--The Holy Allies had refused to recognize the  right of nations to independent existence. They had bartered peoples and  provinces \"as if they were chattels and pawns in a game.\" But when the  peoples tried to found democratic governments, they often discovered  that the quickest and surest way was to unite under one government all  who belonged to a given nationality. Thus the last hundred years in  Europe has witnessed the erection of a number of new national states  created by throwing off the yoke of some foreign ruler. Among the new  nations thus established were (1) Belgium, freed from the kingdom of  Holland; (2) Greece, Serbia, Roumania, Bulgaria, and Albania, freed from  Turkish rule; (3) Italy, united out of territories controlled by petty  sovereigns and Austrian rulers; (4) Norway, separated from Sweden. The  same period saw also the unification of a number of German states into  the German Empire. But during this time several races were unsuccessful  in obtaining independence, among which we may note the Poles (in Russia,  Prussia, and Austria), the Czechs (checks), or Bohemians (in northern  Austria), the Finns (in the northwestern part of the Russian Empire),  and the Slavic people in the southern part of Austria-Hungary.    INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT.--The nineteenth century was not only a period  of political change in Europe. It was also a time of great changes in  the general welfare of the people. It witnessed a remarkable alteration  in everyday employments and habits. In 1800 a great part of the  population was engaged in agriculture. Manufacturing and commerce were  looked upon as of minor importance. The goods that were produced were  made by hand labor in the workman's own home. Beginning first in England  about 1750 and extending to the Continent between 1820 and 1860, there  came a great industrial change. The steam engine was applied to  spinning, weaving, and countless other operations which previously had  been performed by hand. Steam engines could not of course be installed  in every small cottage; hence a number of machines were put in one  factory to be run by one steam engine. The workers left their small huts  and gardens in the country and came to live in towns and cities. After  the steam engine came steam transportation on land and water. Then  followed an enormous demand for coal, iron, steel, and other metals.  More goods could be produced in the factories than were needed for the  people at home. Hence arose more extended commerce and the search for  foreign markets.    COLONIAL EXPANSION.--In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries,  Spain, Portugal, France, and England settled the American continents and  parts of Asia. By a series of wars in the seventeenth and eighteenth  centuries the Dutch secured part of the possessions of Spain and  Portugal; and England obtained almost all of the French colonial  territories. In the eighteenth century the thirteen English colonies on  the Atlantic"]]]
