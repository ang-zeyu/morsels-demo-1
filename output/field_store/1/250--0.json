The translation of any work is at best a difficult task, and must  inevitably be prejudicial to whatever of beauty the original possesses.  When the principal charm of the original lies in its elegant  simplicity, as in the case of the \"Deutsche Liebe,\" the difficulty is  still further enhanced.  The translator has sought to reproduce the  simple German in equally simple English, even at the risk of  transferring German idioms into the English text.    The story speaks for itself.  Without plot, incidents or situations, it  is nevertheless dramatically constructed, unflagging in interest,  abounding in beauty, grace and pathos, and filled with the tenderest  feeling of sympathy, which will go straight to the heart of every lover  of the ideal in the world of humanity, and every worshipper in the  world of nature.  Its brief essays upon theology, literature and social  habits, contained in the dialogues between the hero and the heroine,  will commend themselves to the thoughtful reader by their clearness and  beauty of statement, as well as by their freedom from prejudice.  \"Deutsche Liebe\" is a poem in prose, whose setting is all the more  beautiful and tender, in that it is freed from the bondage of metre,  and has been the unacknowledged source of many a poet's most striking  utterances.    As such, the translator gives it to the public, confident that it will  find ready acceptance among those who cherish the ideal, and a tender  welcome by every lover of humanity.    The translator desires to make acknowledgments to J. J. Lalor, Esq.,  late of the Chicago _Tribune_ for his hearty co-operation in the  progress of the work, and many valuable suggestions; to Prof. Feuling,  the eminent philologist, of the University of Wisconsin, for his  literal version of the extracts from the \"Deutsche Theologie,\" which  preserve the quaintness of the original, and to Mrs. F. M. Brown, for  her metrical version of Goethe's almost untranslatable lines, \"Ueber  allen Gipfeln, ist Ruh,\" which form the keynote of the beautiful  harmony in the character of the heroine.      G.P.U.    Chicago, November, 1874.          AUTHOR'S PREFACE.    Who has not, at some period of his life, seated himself at a  writing-table, where, only a short time before, another sat, who now  rests in the grave?  Who has not opened the drawers, which for long  years have hidden the secrets of a heart now buried in the holy peace  of the church-yard?  Here lie the letters which were so precious to  him, the beloved one; here the pictures, ribbons, and books with marks  on every leaf.  Who can now read and interpret them?  Who can gather  again the withered and scattered leaves of this rose, and vivify them  with fresh perfume?  The flames, in which the Greeks enveloped the  bodies of the departed for the purpose of destruction; the flames, into  which the ancients cast everything once dearest to the living, are now  the securest repository for these relics.  With trembling fear the  surviving friend reads the leaves no eye has ever seen, save those now  so firmly closed, and if, after a glance, too hasty even to read them,  he is convinced these letters and leaves contain nothing which men deem  important, he throws them quickly upon the glowing coals--a flash and  they are gone.    From such flames the following leaves have been saved.  They were at  first intended only for the friends of the deceased, yet they have  found friends even among strangers, and, since it is so to be, may  wander anew in distant lands.  Gladly would the compiler have furnished  more, but the leaves are too much scattered and mutilated to be  rearranged and given complete.          FIRST MEMORY.    Childhood has its secrets and its mysteries; but who can tell or who  can explain them!  We have all roamed through this silent  wonder-wood--we have all once opened our eyes in blissful astonishment,  as the beautiful reality of life overflowed our souls.  We knew not  where, or who, we were--the whole world was ours and we were the whole  world's.  That was an infinite life--without beginning and without end,  without rest and without pain.  In the heart, it was as clear as the  spring heavens, fresh as the violet's perfume--hushed and holy as a  Sabbath morning.    What disturbs this God's-peace of the child?  How can this unconscious  and innocent existence ever cease?  What dissipates the rapture of this  individuality and universality, and suddenly leaves us solitary and  alone in a clouded life?    Say not, with serious face.  It is sin!  Can even a child sin?  Say  rather, we know not, and must only resign ourselves to it.    Is it sin, which makes the bud a blossom, and the blossom fruit, and  the fruit dust?    Is it sin, which makes the worm a chrysalis, and the chrysalis a  butterfly, and the butterfly dust?    And is it sin, which makes the child a man, and the man a gray-haired  man, and the gray-haired man dust?  And what is dust?    Say rather, we know not, and must only resign ourselves to it.    Yet it is so beautiful, recalling the spring-time of life, to look back  and remember one's self.  Yes, even in the sultry summer, in the  melancholy autumn and in the cold winter of life, there is here and  there a spring day, and the heart says: \"I feel like spring.\"  Such a  day is this--and so I lay me down upon the soft moss of the fragrant  woods, and stretch out my weary limbs, and look up, through the green  foliage, into the boundless blue, and think how it used to be in that  childhood.    Then, all seems forgotten.  The first pages of memory are like the old  family Bible.  The first leaves are wholly faded and somewhat soiled  with handling.  But, when we turn further, and come to the chapters  where Adam and Eve were banished from Paradise, then, all begins to  grow clear and legible.  Now if we could only find the title-page with  the imprint and date--but that is irrevocably lost, and, in their  place, we find only the clear transcript--our baptismal  certificate--bearing witness when we were born, the names of our  parents and godparents, and that we were not issued _sine loco et anno_.    But, oh this beginning!  Would there were none, since, with the  beginning, all thought and memories alike cease.  When we thus dream  back into childhood, and from childhood into infinity, this bad  beginning continually flies further away.  The thoughts pursue it and  never overtake it; just as a child seeks the spot where the blue sky  touches the earth, and runs and runs, while the sky always runs before  it, yet still touches the earth--but the child grows weary and never  reaches the spot.    But even since we were once there--wherever it may be, where we had a  beginning, what do we know now?  For memory shakes itself like the  spaniel, just come out of the waves, while the water runs in, his eyes  and he looks very strangely.    I believe I can even yet remember when I saw the stars for the first  time.  They may have seen me often before, but one evening it seemed as  if it were cold.  Although I lay in my mother's lap, I shivered and was  chilly, or I was frightened.  In short, something came over me which  reminded me of my little Ego in no ordinary manner.  Then my mother  showed me the bright stars, and I wondered at them, and thought that  she had made them very beautifully.  Then I felt warm again, and could  sleep well.    Furthermore, I remember how I once lay in the grass and everything  about me tossed and nodded, hummed and buzzed.  Then there came a great  swarm of little, myriad-footed, winged creatures, which lit upon my  forehead and eyes and said, \"Good day.\"  Immediately my eyes smarted,  and I cried to my mother, and she said: \"Poor little one, how the gnats  have stung him!\"  I could not open my eyes or see the blue sky any  longer, but my mother had a bunch of fresh violets in her hand, and it  seemed as if a dark-blue, fresh, spicy perfume were wafted through my  senses.  Even now, whenever I see the first violets, I remember this,  and it seems to me that I must close my eyes so that the old dark-blue  heaven of that day may again rise over my soul.    Still further do I remember, how, at another time, a new world  disclosed itself to me--more beautiful than the star-world or the  violet perfume.  It was on an Easter morning, and my mother had dressed  me early.  Before the window stood our old church.  It was not  beautiful, but still it had a lofty roof and tower, and on the tower a  golden cross, and it appeared very much older and grayer than the other  buildings.  I wondered who lived in it, and once I looked in through  the iron-grated door.  It was entirely empty, cold and dismal.  There  was not even one soul in the whole building, and after that I always  shuddered when I passed the door.  But on this Easter morning, it had  rained early, and when the sun came out in full splendor, the old  church with the gray sloping roof, the high windows and the tower with  the golden cross glistened with a wondrous shimmer.  All at once the  light which streamed through the lofty windows began to move and  glisten.

Valedictory eloquence is rare, and death-bed sayings  have not often hit the mark of the occasion. Charles Second, wit and  sceptic, a man whose life had been one long lesson in human incredulity,  an easy-going comrade, a manoeuvring king--remembered and embodied all  his wit and scepticism along with more than his usual good humour in the  famous \"I am afraid, gentlemen, I am an unconscionable time a-dying.\"    [Footnote 1: i.e. In the pages of _Scribner's Magazine_ (1888).]          I      An unconscionable time a-dying--there is the picture (\"I am afraid,  gentlemen,\") of your life and of mine. The sands run out, and the hours  are \"numbered and imputed,\" and the days go by; and when the last of  these finds us, we have been a long time dying, and what else? The very  length is something, if we reach that hour of separation undishonoured;  and to have lived at all is doubtless (in the soldierly expression) to  have served. There is a tale in Tacitus of how the veterans mutinied in  the German wilderness; of how they mobbed Germanicus, clamouring to go  home; and of how, seizing their general's hand, these old, war-worn  exiles passed his finger along their toothless gums. _Sunt lacrymae  rerum_: this was the most eloquent of the songs of Simeon. And when a  man has lived to a fair age, he bears his marks of service. He may have  never been remarked upon the breach at the head of the army; at least he  shall have lost his teeth on the camp bread.    The idealism of serious people in this age of ours is of a noble  character. It never seems to them that they have served enough; they  have a fine impatience of their virtues. It were perhaps more modest to  be singly thankful that we are no worse. It is not only our enemies,  those desperate characters--it is we ourselves who know not what we  do;--thence springs the glimmering hope that perhaps we do better than  we think: that to scramble through this random business with hands  reasonably clean, to have played the part of a man or woman with some  reasonable fulness, to have often resisted the diabolic, and at the end  to be still resisting it, is for the poor human soldier to have done  right well. To ask to see some fruit of our endeavour is but a  transcendental way of serving for reward; and what we take to be  contempt of self is only greed of hire.    And again if we require so much of ourselves, shall we not require much  of others? If we do not genially judge our own deficiencies, is it not  to be feared we shall be even stern to the trespasses of others? And he  who (looking back upon his own life) can see no more than that he has  been unconscionably long a-dying, will he not be tempted to think his  neighbour unconscionably long of getting hanged? It is probable that  nearly all who think of conduct at all, think of it too much; it is  certain we all think too much of sin. We are not damned for doing wrong,  but for not doing right; Christ would never hear of negative morality;  _thou shalt_ was ever his word, with which he superseded _thou shalt  not_. To make our idea of morality centre on forbidden acts is to defile  the imagination and to introduce into our judgments of our fellow-men a  secret element of gusto. If a thing is wrong for us, we should not dwell  upon the thought of it; or we shall soon dwell upon it with inverted  pleasure. If we cannot drive it from our minds--one thing of two: either  our creed is in the wrong and we must more indulgently remodel it; or  else, if our morality be in the right, we are criminal lunatics and  should place our persons in restraint. A mark of such unwholesomely  divided minds is the passion for interference with others: the Fox  without the Tail was of this breed, but had (if his biographer is to be  trusted) a certain antique civility now out of date. A man may have a  flaw, a weakness, that unfits him for the duties of life, that spoils  his temper, that threatens his integrity, or that betrays him into  cruelty. It has to be conquered; but it must never be suffered to  engross his thoughts. The true duties lie all upon the farther side,  and must be attended to with a whole mind so soon as this preliminary  clearing of the decks has been effected. In order that he may be kind  and honest, it may be needful he should become a total abstainer; let  him become so then, and the next day let him forget the circumstance.  Trying to be kind and honest will require all his thoughts; a mortified  appetite is never a wise companion; in so far as he has had to mortify  an appetite, he will still be the worse man; and of such an one a great  deal of cheerfulness will be required in judging life, and a great deal  of humility in judging others.    It may be argued again that dissatisfaction with our life's endeavour  springs in some degree from dulness. We require higher tasks, because  we do not recognise the height of those we have. Trying to be kind and  honest seems an affair too simple and too inconsequential for gentlemen  of our heroic mould; we had rather set ourselves to something bold,  arduous, and conclusive; we had rather found a schism or suppress a  heresy, cut off a hand or mortify an appetite. But the task before us,  which is to co-endure with our existence, is rather one of microscopic  fineness, and the heroism required is that of patience. There is no  cutting of the Gordian knots of life; each must be smilingly unravelled.    To be honest, to be kind--to earn a little and to spend a little less,  to make upon the whole a family happier for his presence, to renounce  when that shall be necessary and not be embittered, to keep a few  friends but these without capitulation--above all, on the same grim  condition, to keep friends with himself--here is a task for all that a  man has of fortitude and delicacy. He has an ambitious soul who would  ask more; he has a hopeful spirit who should look in such an enterprise  to be successful. There is indeed one element in human destiny that not  blindness itself can controvert: whatever else we are intended to do, we  are not intended to succeed; failure is the fate allotted. It is so in  every art and study; it is so above all in the continent art of living  well. Here is a pleasant thought for the year's end or for the end of  life: Only self-deception will be satisfied, and there need be no  despair for the despairer.          II      But Christmas is not only the mile-mark of another year, moving us to  thoughts of self-examination: it is a season, from all its associations,  whether domestic or religious, suggesting thoughts of joy. A man  dissatisfied with his endeavours is a man tempted to sadness. And in the  midst of the winter, when his life runs lowest and he is reminded of the  empty chairs of his beloved, it is well he should be condemned to this  fashion of the smiling face. Noble disappointment, noble self-denial are  not to be admired, not even to be pardoned, if they bring bitterness.  It is one thing to enter the kingdom of heaven maim; another to maim  yourself and stay without. And the kingdom of heaven is of the  childlike, of those who are easy to please, who love and who give  pleasure. Mighty men of their hands, the smiters and the builders and  the judges, have lived long and done sternly and yet preserved this  lovely character; and among our carpet interests and twopenny concerns,  the shame were indelible if _we_ should lose it. Gentleness and  cheerfulness, these come before all morality; they are the perfect  duties. And it is the trouble with moral men that they have neither one  nor other. It was the moral man, the Pharisee, whom Christ could not  away with. If your morals make you dreary, depend upon it they are  wrong. I do not say \"give them up,\" for they may be all you have; but  conceal them like a vice, lest they should spoil the lives of better  and simpler people.    A strange temptation attends upon man: to keep his eye on pleasures,  even when he will not share in them; to aim all his morals against  them. This very year a lady (singular iconoclast!) proclaimed a crusade  against dolls; and the racy sermon against lust is a feature of the age.  I venture to call such moralists insincere. At any excess or perversion  of a natural appetite, their lyre sounds of itself with relishing  denunciations; but for all displays of the truly diabolic--envy, malice,  the mean lie, the mean silence, the calumnious truth, the backbiter, the  petty tyrant, the peevish poisoner of family life--their standard is  quite different. These are wrong, they will admit, yet somehow not so  wrong; there is no zeal in their assault on them, no secret element of  gusto warms up the sermon; it is for things not wrong in themselves that  they reserve the choicest of their indignation. A man may naturally  disclaim all moral kinship with the Reverend Mr. Zola or the hobgoblin  old lady of the dolls; for these are gross and naked instances. And  yet in each of us some similar element resides. The sight of a pleasure  in which we cannot or else will not share moves us to a particular  impatience. It may be because we are envious, or because we are  sad, or because we dislike noise and romping--being so refined, or  because--being so philosophic--we have an overweighing sense of life's  gravity: at least, as we go on in years, we are all tempted to frown  upon our neighbour's pleasures. People are nowadays so fond of  resisting temptations; here is one to be resisted. They are fond of  self-denial; here is a propensity that cannot be too peremptorily  denied. There is an idea abroad among moral people that they should  make their neighbours good. One person I have to make good:"]]]
