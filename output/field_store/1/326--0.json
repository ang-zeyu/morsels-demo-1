Shrill and  sweet, from far and near it came, calling the faithful to prayer,  impelling merchants to leave their wares, buyers their purchases,  gossips their chatter, and to turn in the direction of Mecca and offer  their praise to Allah, who is God.    As the entire male population of the native quarter knelt, the girl  drew back beneath an awning of many colours which shaded silken goods  from the rays of the sun, whilst curious eyes peeped down upon her from  behind the shelter of the _masharabeyeh_, the harem lattice of  finely-carved wood.  Yards of silk of every hue lay tumbled inside and  outside the _dukkan_ or shop in the silk-market; silken scarves, plain  and embroidered, hung from strings; silk shawls were spread upon  Persian carpets; a veritable riot of colour against the yellow-white  plaster of the shop walls, above which flamed the sky, a cloak of blue,  embroidered in rose and gold and amethyst.    The native women behind the shelter of the wood lattice or the  _yashmak_ or the all-enveloping _barku_, talked softly together as they  watched the beautiful girl who serenely and quite unveiled walked  amongst men with an animal of surpassing hideousness at her heels.    She stood with her head uncovered--it is permissible at sunset--and  with her face lifted, as she listened to the call to prayer, so that a  sun-ray silting in through the silks blazed down upon the positively  red curls which rioted all over her head and were of a tone sharper  than henna, yet many times removed from the shades of red known as  carrots or ginger.    Her skin was _matte_, her mouth crimson, and curved, the teeth perfect,  and her heavily-lashed eyes of so deep a purple as to appear black.  She was slim and supple, unencumbered by anything more confining than a  suspender-belt, a fortnight off her eighteenth birthday and entirely  lovable in looks, ways and temperament in the eyes of all mankind,  which includes women.    The prayer over, and the men again about the business of the hour, she  enquired her way of the vendor of silks who, having quickly replaced  his shoes, had as hastily returned to his shop, his heart rejoicing at  the prospect of perhaps one or two hours' more bargaining--for where is  to be found the Oriental who knows the value of time?    Loving animals, Damaris wanted to find that corner near the silk-market  where can be purchased anything from a camel to a hunting cheetah, a  greyhound to a falcon.    It is not wise for European women to saunter about the old Arabian  quarter unaccompanied, especially if they have been blessed by the gods  in the ways of looks.  Damaris Hethencourt most certainly ought not to  have been there, but you must perforce follow the path Fate has marked  out for you, whether it leads through country lanes, or Piccadilly, or  the Arab quarter of Cairo.    The vendor of silks salaamed deeply before her beauty and the  graciousness of her manner, for she smiled when she talked and spoke  the prettiest broken Arabic in the world.    So, putting the huge two-year-old bulldog, which one day was to claim  the proud title of champion, on the leash, she wended her way through  the narrow streets in which two camels may scarce squeeze past each  other and where the _masharabeyeh_ of the harems almost meet overhead.    Water-carriers, camels, sweetmeat-sellers; lowly women in black gown  and _yashmak_; coffee-sellers; donkeys which continually bray and dogs  which unceasingly bark; cracking of whips; shrill cries of \"_Dahrik ya  sitt_ or _musyu_,\" (\"Thy back, lady, or sir\"); shouts of _U'a u'a_;  clashing of bronze ware; snarls of anger; laughter; song; dust and  colour, all the ingredients which go to the entrancement of the bazaar.    And the odours?    Scent and perfume, aroma and odour; cedars of Lebanon and _harem_ musk;  tang of the sandy sea, fume of the street; the trail of smoke and  onions; the milk of goats; the reek of humanity; the breath of kine.  Make a bundle of that, and tie it with the silken lashes of women's  eyes; secure it with the steel of a needle-pointed knife--and leave it  at that.    There is _no_ describing the smell of the East.    The sale of really good animals--the other kind you can buy by lifting  a finger in the streets--takes place twice a month in a small square  near the Suk-en Nahlesin; but as the way to it leads through many dirty  and twisting lanes, few Europeans ever get so far.    The stock is tethered to iron rings in the ground, the vendors squat  near by, but at a safe distance from teeth, claws or hoofs; the  purchasers stand still farther off; there sometimes occurs a free  fight, when the length of the chain that tethers the jaguar next the  hunting cheetah is too long by a foot or so; and the noise is always  deafening.    Abdul, falconer of Shammar--which district is to be found on the holy  road to Mecca--being of that locality specialises in the _shahin_,  which is a species of hawk; visits the market by appointment only, and,  being independent and a specialist, does not always keep that  appointment.    Damaris turned suddenly into the market and hurriedly looked round for  shelter, which she found in an arched doorway leading to the usual  court of the native house.    Zulannah the courtesan peered down upon her from between the silken  curtains of her balcony, and clapped her hands twice so that her  woman-slaves ran quickly to watch and whisper about this white woman  who stood unattended in the open market.  They giggled in the  insufferable Eastern way, and pointed across the Square, where the  whole of the male population surged about two men.  But Zulannah, the  recognised beauty of the North of Egypt, shrugged her dimpled shoulders  as she stuffed over-large portions of sweetmeats between her dazzling  teeth and stretched herself upon a divan to watch the scene over the  way.    Abdul, falconer of Shammar, bearded and middle-aged, stood with a  _shahin_ of Jaraza upon his fist and a hooded eyess--which means a  young hawk or nestling taken from the nest--of the same species upon a  padded and spiked perch beside him, whilst hooded or with seeled eyes,  upon perch or bough, were other yellow or dark-eyed birds of prey;  short-winged hawks, a bearded vulture, a hobby, a passage Saker.    But it was not upon Abdul or his stock that the girl's eyes rested,  nor, peradventure, the eyes behind the silken curtains.    The central figure of the glowing picture was that of Hugh Carden Ali,  the eldest and best-beloved son of Hahmed the Sheikh el-Umbar and Jill,  his beautiful, English and one and only wife; the son conceived in a  surpassing love and born upon the desert sands.    \"An Englishman,\" said Damaris softly as she withdrew yet further into  the sheltering doorway and unleashed the dog; and still further back,  when the man suddenly turned and looked across the Square as though in  search of someone.  \"No! a native,\" she added, as she noticed the  crimson _tarbusch_.  \"And yet . . .\"    She was by no means the first to wonder as to the nationality of the  man.    In riding-kit, with boots from Peter Yapp, he looked, except for the  headcovering, exactly like an Englishman.    Certainly the shape of the face was slightly more oval than is common  to the sons of a northern race, but nothing really out of the ordinary,  just as the eyes were an ordinary kind of brown, with a disconcerting  way of looking suddenly into your face, sweeping it in an  all-comprehensive lightning glance and looking indifferently away.    The nose was good and quite straight; the hair thick, brown and  controllable; the mouth covering the perfect teeth was deceptive, or  maybe it was the strength of the jaw which belied the gentleness, just  as the slimness of the six-foot of body, trained to a hair from  babyhood, gave no clue to the steel muscles underlying a skin as white  as and a good deal whiter than that of some Europeans.    He moved with the quickness and quietness of those accustomed to the  far horizon as a background; he was slow in speech; and dead-slow in  anger until aroused by opposition.    For the physically weak-born, he had the gentle sympathy of the very  strong; for the physically undeveloped and the morally weak he had no  use whatever--_none_.  In the West, his reserve with men had been  labelled taciturnity or swollen-headeduess, which did not fit the case  at all; whilst, in spite of his perfect manner towards them, his  indifference to woman _en masse_ or in the individual was supreme and  sincere.    He was the direct descendant of the founder of Nineveh where horses  were concerned,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15729"],[0,"History of the Jews in Russia and Poland, Volume 2 [of 3] (#1)"],[1,"OF THE JEWS  IN RUSSIA AND POLAND    FROM THE EARLIEST TIMES  UNTIL THE PRESENT DAY    BY  S.M. DUBNOW    TRANSLATED FROM THE RUSSIAN  BY  I. FRIEDLAENDER      VOLUME II      FROM THE DEATH OF ALEXANDER I. UNTIL THE DEATH OF ALEXANDER III.  (1825-1894)      PHILADELPHIA  THE JEWISH PUBLICATION SOCIETY OF AMERICA  5706--1946    Copyright 1918 by  THE JEWISH PUBLICATION SOCIETY OF AMERICA            TRANSLATOR'S PREFACE      It was originally proposed to give the history of Russian  Jewry after 1825--the year with which the first volume concludes--in a  single volume. This, however, would have resulted in producing a volume  of unwieldy dimensions, entirely out of proportion to the one preceding  it. It has, therefore, become imperative to divide Dubnow's work into  three, instead of into two, volumes. The second volume, which is  herewith offered to the public, treats of the history of Russian Jewry  from the death of Alexander I. (1825) until the death of Alexander III.  (1894). The third and concluding volume will deal with the reign of  Nicholas II., the last of the Romanovs, and will also contain the  bibliographical apparatus, the maps, the index, and other supplementary  material. This division will undoubtedly recommend itself to the reader.  The next volume is partly in type, and will follow as soon as  circumstances permit.    Of the three reigns described in the present volume, that of Alexander  III., though by far the briefest, is treated at considerably greater  length than the others. The reason for it is not far to seek. The events  which occurred during the fourteen years of his reign laid their  indelible impress upon Russian Jewry, and they have had a determining  influence upon the growth and development of American Israel. The  account of Alexander III.'s reign is introduced in the Russian original  by a general characterization of the anti-Jewish policies of Russian  Tzardom. Owing to the rearrangement of the material, to which reference  was made in the preface to the first volume, this introduction, which  would have interrupted the flow of the narrative, had to be omitted. But  a few passages from it, written in the characteristic style of Mr.  Dubnow, may find a place here:      Russian Tzardom began its consistent role as a persecutor of the    Eternal People when it received, by way of bequest, the vast Jewish    population of disintegrated Poland. At the end of the eighteenth    century, when Western Europe had just begun the emancipation of the    Jews, the latter were subjected in the East of Europe to every    possible medieval experiment.... The reign of Alexander II., who    slightly relieved the civil disfranchisement of the Jews by    permitting certain categories among them to live outside the Pale    and by a few other measures, forms a brief interlude in the Russian    policy of oppression. His tragic death in 1881 marks the beginning    of a new terrible reaction which has superimposed the system of    wholesale street pogroms upon the policy of disfranchisement, and    has again thrown millions of Jews into the dismal abyss of    medievalism.      Russia created a lurid antithesis to Jewish emancipation at a time    when the latter was consummated not only in Western Europe, but also    in the semi-civilized Balkan States.... True, the rise of Russian    Judaeophobia--the Russian technical term for Jew-hatred--was    paralleled by the appearance of German anti-Semitism in which it    found a congenial companion. Yet, the anti-Semitism of the West was    after all only a weak aftermath of the infantile disease of    Europe--the medieval Jew-hatred--whereas culturally retrograde    Russia was still suffering from the same infection in its acute,    \"childish\" form. The social and cultural anti-Semitism of the West    did not undermine the modern foundations of Jewish civil equality.    But Russian Judaeophobia, more governmental than social, being fully    in accord with the entire regime of absolutism, produced a system    aiming not only at the disfranchisement, but also at the direct    physical annihilation of the Jewish people. The policy of the    extermination of Judaism was stamped upon the forehead of Russian    reaction, receiving various colors at various periods, assuming the    hue now of economic, now of national and religious, now of    bureaucratic oppression. The year 1881 marks the starting-point of    this systematic war against the Jews, which has continued until our    own days, and is bound to reach a crisis upon the termination of the    great world struggle.    Concerning the transcription of Slavonic names, the reader is referred  to the explanations given in the preface to the first volume. The  foot-notes added by the translator have been placed in square brackets.  The poetic quotations by the author have been reproduced in English  verse, the translation following both in content and form the original  languages of the quotations as closely as possible. As in the case of  the first volume, a number of editorial changes have become necessary.  The material has been re-arranged and the headings have been supplied in  accordance with the general plan of the work. A number of pages have  been added, dealing with the attitude of the American people and  Government toward the anti-Jewish persecutions in Russia. These  additions will be found on pp. 292-296, pp. 394-396, and pp. 408-410. I  am indebted to Dr. Cyrus Adler for his kindness in reading the proof of  this part of the work.    The dates given in this volume are those of the Russian calendar, except  for the cases in which the facts relate to happenings outside of Russia.    As in the first volume, the translator has been greatly assisted by the  Hon. Mayer Sulzberger, who has read the proofs with his usual care and  discrimination, and by Professor Alexander Marx, who has offered a  number of valuable suggestions.    I.F.
