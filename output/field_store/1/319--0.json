PICKERING    Reprinted from the POPULAR SCIENCE MONTHLY, August, 1909.          THE FUTURE OF ASTRONOMY[1]    BY PROFESSOR EDWARD C. PICKERING    HARVARD COLLEGE OBSERVATORY      It is claimed by astronomers that their science is not only the oldest,  but that it is the most highly developed of the sciences. Indeed it  should be so, since no other science has ever received such support from  royalty, from the state and from the private individual. However this  may be, there is no doubt that in recent years astronomers have had  granted to them greater opportunities for carrying on large pieces of  work than have been entrusted to men in any other department of pure  science. One might expect that the practical results of a science like  physics would appeal to the man who has made a vast fortune through some  of its applications. The telephone, the electric transmission of power,  wireless telegraphy and the submarine cable are instances of immense  financial returns derived from the most abstruse principles of physics.  Yet there are scarcely any physical laboratories devoted to research, or  endowed with independent funds for this object, except those supported  by the government. The endowment of astronomical observatories devoted  to research, and not including that given for teaching, is estimated to  amount to half a million dollars annually. Several of the larger  observatories have an annual income of fifty thousand dollars.    [1] Commencement address at Case School of Applied Science, Cleveland,  May 27, 1909.    I once asked the wisest man I know, what was the reason for this  difference. He said that it was probably because astronomy appealed to  the imagination. A practical man, who has spent all his life in his  counting room or mill, is sometimes deeply impressed with the vast  distances and grandeur of the problems of astronomy, and the very  remoteness and difficulty of studying the stars attract him.    My object in calling your attention to this matter is the hope that what  I have to say of the organization of astronomy may prove of use to those  interested in other branches of science, and that it may lead to placing  them on the footing they should hold. My arguments apply with almost  equal force to physics, to chemistry, and in fact to almost every branch  of physical or natural science, in which knowledge may be advanced by  observation or experiment.    The practical value of astronomy in the past is easily established.  Without it, international commerce on a large scale would have been  impossible. Without the aid of astronomy, accurate boundaries of large  tracts of land could not have been defined and standard time would have  been impossible. The work of the early astronomers was eminently  practical, and appealed at once to every one. This work has now been  finished. We can compute the positions of the stars for years, almost  for centuries, with all the accuracy needed for navigation, for  determining time or for approximate boundaries of countries. The  investigations now in progress at the greatest observatories have  little, if any, value in dollars and cents. They appeal, however, to the  far higher sense, the desire of the intellectual human being to  determine the laws of nature, the construction of the material universe,  and the properties of the heavenly bodies of which those known to exist  far outnumber those that can be seen.    Three great advances have been made in astronomy. First, the invention  of the telescope, with which we commonly associate the name of Galileo,  from the wonderful results he obtained with it. At that time there was  practically no science in America, and for more than two centuries we  failed to add materially to this invention. Half a century ago the  genius of the members of one family, Alvan Clark and his two sons,  placed America in the front rank not only in the construction, but in  the possession, of the largest and most perfect telescopes ever made. It  is not easy to secure the world's record in any subject. The Clarks  constructed successively, the 18-inch lens for Chicago, the 26-inch for  Washington, the 30-inch for Pulkowa, the 36-inch for Lick and the  40-inch for Yerkes. Each in turn was the largest yet made, and each time  the Clarks were called upon to surpass the world's record, which they  themselves had already established. Have we at length reached the limit  in size? If we include reflectors, no, since we have mirrors of 60  inches aperture at Mt. Wilson and Cambridge, and a still larger one of  100 inches has been undertaken. It is more than doubtful, however,  whether a further increase in size is a great advantage. Much more  depends on other conditions, especially those of climate, the kind of  work to be done and, more than all, the man behind the gun. The case is  not unlike that of a battleship. Would a ship a thousand feet long  always sink one of five hundred feet? It seems as if we had nearly  reached the limit of size of telescopes, and as if we must hope for the  next improvement in some other direction.    The second great advance in astronomy originated in America, and was in  an entirely different direction, the application of photography to the  study of the stars. The first photographic image of a star was obtained  in 1850, by George P. Bond, with the assistance of Mr. J.A. Whipple, at  the Harvard College Observatory. A daguerreotype plate was placed at the  focus of the 15-inch equatorial, at that time one of the two largest  refracting telescopes in the world. An image of [Greek: alpha] Lyrae was  thus obtained, and for this Mr. Bond received a gold medal at the first  international exhibition, that at the Crystal Palace, in London, in  1851. In 1857, Mr. Bond, then Professor Bond, director of the Harvard  Observatory, again took up the matter with collodion wet plates, and in  three masterly papers showed the advantages of photography in many ways.  The lack of sensitiveness of the wet plate was perhaps the only reason  why its use progressed but slowly. Quarter of a century later, with the  introduction of the dry plate and the gelatine film, a new start was  made. These photographic plates were very sensitive, were easily  handled, and indefinitely long exposures could be made with them. As a  result, photography has superseded visual observations, in many  departments of astronomy, and is now carrying them far beyond the limits  that would have been deemed possible a few years ago.    The third great advance in astronomy is in photographing the spectra of  the stars. The first photograph showing the lines in a stellar spectrum  was obtained by Dr. Henry Draper, of New York, in 1872. Sir William  Huggins in 1863 had obtained an image of the spectrum of Sirius, on a  photographic plate, but no lines were visible in it. In 1876 he again  took up the subject, and, by an early publication, preceded Dr. Draper.  When we consider the attention the photography of stellar spectra is  receiving at the present time, in nearly all the great observatories in  the world, it may well be regarded as the third great advance in  astronomy.    What will be the fourth advance, and how will it be brought about? To  answer this question we must consider the various ways in which  astronomy, and for that matter any other science, may be advanced.    First, by educating astronomers. There are many observatories where  excellent instruction in astronomy is given, either to the general  student or to one who wishes to make it his profession. At almost any  active observatory a student would be received as a volunteer assistant.  Unfortunately, few young men can afford to accept an unpaid position,  and the establishment of a number of fellowships each offering a small  salary sufficient to support the student would enable him to acquire the  necessary knowledge to fill a permanent position. The number of these  scholarships should not be large, lest more students should undertake  the work than would be required to fill the permanent paying positions  in astronomy, as they become vacant.    In Europe, a favorite method of aiding science is to offer a prize for  the best memoir on a specified subject. On theoretical grounds this is  extremely objectionable. Since the papers presented are anonymous and  confidential, no one but the judges know how great is the effort wasted  in duplication. The larger the prize, the greater the injury to science,  since the greater will be the energy diverted from untried fields. It  would be much wiser to invite applications, select the man most likely  to produce a useful memoir, and award the prize to him if he achieved  success.    The award of a medal, if of great intrinsic value, would be an unwise  expenditure. The Victoria Cross is an example of a successful  foundation, highly prized, but of small intrinsic value. If made of  gold, it would carry no greater honor, and would be more liable to be  stolen, melted down or pawned.    Honorary membership in a famous society, or honorary degrees, have great  value if wisely awarded. Both are highly prized, form an excellent  stimulus to continued work, and as they are both priceless, and without  price, they in no way diminish the capacity for work. I recently had  occasion to compare the progress in various sciences of different  countries, and found that the number of persons elected as foreign  associates of the seven great national societies of the world was an  excellent test. Eighty-seven persons were members of two or more of  these societies. Only six are residents of the United States, while an  equal number come from Saxony, which has only a twentieth of the  population. Of the six residents here, only three were born in the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1565"],[0,"The Last Days of Pompeii (#1)"],[1,"LAST DAYS OF POMPEII    by Edward George Bulwer-Lytton          BOOK THE FIRST        Chapter I.    THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF POMPEII.    'HO, Diomed, well met!  Do you sup with Glaucus to-night?' said a young  man of small stature, who wore his tunic in those loose and effeminate  folds which proved him to be a gentleman and a coxcomb.    'Alas, no! dear Clodius; he has not invited me,' replied Diomed, a man  of portly frame and of middle age.  'By Pollux, a scurvy trick! for they  say his suppers are the best in Pompeii'.    'Pretty well--though there is never enough of wine for me.  It is not  the old Greek blood that flows in his veins, for he pretends that wine  makes him dull the next morning.'    'There may be another reason for that thrift,' said Diomed, raising his  brows.  'With all his conceit and extravagance he is not so rich, I  fancy, as he affects to be, and perhaps loves to save his amphorae  better than his wit.'    'An additional reason for supping with him while the sesterces last.  Next year, Diomed, we must find another Glaucus.'    'He is fond of the dice, too, I hear.'    'He is fond of every pleasure; and while he likes the pleasure of giving  suppers, we are all fond of him.'    'Ha, ha, Clodius, that is well said!  Have you ever seen my wine-cellars,  by-the-by?'    'I think not, my good Diomed.'    'Well, you must sup with me some evening; I have tolerable muraenae in  my reservoir, and I ask Pansa the aedile to meet you.'    'O, no state with me!--Persicos odi apparatus, I am easily contented.  Well, the day wanes; I am for the baths--and you...'    'To the quaestor--business of state--afterwards to the temple of Isis.  Vale!'    'An ostentatious, bustling, ill-bred fellow,' muttered Clodius to  himself, as he sauntered slowly away.  'He thinks with his feasts and  his wine-cellars to make us forget that he is the son of a freedman--and  so we will, when we do him the honour of winning his money; these rich  plebeians are a harvest for us spendthrift nobles.'    Thus soliloquising, Clodius arrived in the Via Domitiana, which was  crowded with passengers and chariots, and exhibited all that gay and  animated exuberance of life and motion which we find at this day in the  streets of Naples.    The bells of the cars as they rapidly glided by each other jingled  merrily on the ear, and Clodius with smiles or nods claimed familiar  acquaintance with whatever equipage was most elegant or fantastic: in  fact, no idler was better known in Pompeii.    'What, Clodius! and how have you slept on your good fortune?' cried, in  a pleasant and musical voice, a young man, in a chariot of the most  fastidious and graceful fashion.  Upon its surface of bronze were  elaborately wrought, in the still exquisite workmanship of Greece,  reliefs of the Olympian games; the two horses that drew the car were of  the rarest breed of Parthia; their slender limbs seemed to disdain the  ground and court the air, and yet at the slightest touch of the  charioteer, who stood behind the young owner of the equipage, they  paused motionless, as if suddenly transformed into stone--lifeless, but  lifelike, as one of the breathing wonders of Praxiteles. The owner  himself was of that slender and beautiful symmetry from which the  sculptors of Athens drew their models; his Grecian origin betrayed  itself in his light but clustering locks, and the perfect harmony of his  features.  He wore no toga, which in the time of the emperors had indeed  ceased to be the general distinction of the Romans, and was especially  ridiculed by the pretenders to fashion; but his tunic glowed in the  richest hues of the Tyrian dye, and the fibulae, or buckles, by which it  was fastened, sparkled with emeralds: around his neck was a chain of  gold, which in the middle of his breast twisted itself into the form of  a serpent's head, from the mouth of which hung pendent a large signet  ring of elaborate and most exquisite workmanship; the sleeves of the  tunic were loose, and fringed at the hand with gold: and across the  waist a girdle wrought in arabesque designs, and of the same material as  the fringe, served in lieu of pockets for the receptacle of the  handkerchief and the purse, the stilus and the tablets.    'My dear Glaucus!' said Clodius, 'I rejoice to see that your losses have  so little affected your mien.  Why, you seem as if you had been inspired  by Apollo, and your face shines with happiness like a glory; any one  might take you for the winner, and me for the loser.'    'And what is there in the loss or gain of those dull pieces of metal  that should change our spirit, my Clodius?  By Venus, while yet young,  we can cover our full locks with chaplets--while yet the cithara sounds  on unsated ears--while yet the smile of Lydia or of Chloe flashes over  our veins in which the blood runs so swiftly, so long shall we find  delight in the sunny air, and make bald time itself but the treasurer of  our joys.  You sup with me to-night, you know.'    'Who ever forgets the invitation of Glaucus!'    'But which way go you now?'    'Why, I thought of visiting the baths: but it wants yet an hour to the  usual time.'    'Well, I will dismiss my chariot, and go with you.  So, so, my Phylias,'  stroking the horse nearest to him, which by a low neigh and with  backward ears playfully acknowledged the courtesy: 'a holiday for you  to-day.  Is he not handsome, Clodius?'    'Worthy of Phoebus,' returned the noble parasite--'or of Glaucus.'        Chapter II    THE BLIND FLOWER-GIRL, AND THE BEAUTY OF FASHION.  THE ATHENIAN'S  CONFESSION.  THE READER'S INTRODUCTION TO ARBACES OF EGYPT.    TALKING lightly on a thousand matters, the two young men sauntered  through the streets; they were now in that quarter which was filled with  the gayest shops, their open interiors all and each radiant with the  gaudy yet harmonious colors of frescoes, inconceivably varied in fancy  and design. The sparkling fountains, that at every vista threw upwards  their grateful spray in the summer air; the crowd of passengers, or  rather loiterers, mostly clad in robes of the Tyrian dye; the gay groups  collected round each more attractive shop; the slaves passing to and fro  with buckets of bronze, cast in the most graceful shapes, and borne upon  their heads; the country girls stationed at frequent intervals with  baskets of blushing fruit, and flowers more alluring to the ancient  Italians than to their descendants (with whom, indeed, \"latet anguis in  herba,\" a disease seems lurking in every violet and rose); the numerous  haunts which fulfilled with that idle people the office of cafes and  clubs at this day; the shops, where on shelves of marble were ranged the  vases of wine and oil, and before whose thresholds, seats, protected  from the sun by a purple awning, invited the weary to rest and the  indolent to lounge--made a scene of such glowing and vivacious  excitement, as might well give the Athenian spirit of Glaucus an excuse  for its susceptibility to joy.    'Talk to me no more of Rome,' said he to Clodius.  'Pleasure is too  stately and ponderous in those mighty walls: even in the precincts of  the court--even in the Golden House of Nero, and the incipient glories  of the palace of Titus, there is a certain dulness of magnificence--the  eye aches--the spirit is wearied; besides, my Clodius, we are  discontented when we compare the enormous luxury and wealth of others  with the mediocrity of our own state.  But here we surrender ourselves  easily to pleasure, and we have the brilliancy of luxury without the  lassitude of its pomp.'    'It was from that feeling that you chose your summer retreat at  Pompeii?'    'It was.  I prefer it to Baiae: I grant the charms of the latter, but I  love not the pedants who resort there, and who seem to weigh out their  pleasures by the drachm.'    'Yet you are fond of the learned, too; and as for poetry, why, your  house is literally eloquent with AEschylus and Homer, the epic and the  drama.'    'Yes, but those Romans who mimic my Athenian ancestors do everything so  heavily.  Even in the chase they make their slaves carry Plato with  them; and whenever the boar is lost, out they take their books and their  papyrus, in order not to lose their time too. When the dancing-girls  swim before them in all the blandishment of Persian manners, some drone  of a freedman, with a face of stone, reads them a section of Cicero \"De  Officiis\".  Unskilful pharmacists! pleasure and study are not elements  to be thus mixed together, they must be enjoyed separately: the Romans  lose both by this pragmatical affectation of refinement, and prove that  they have no souls for either. Oh, my Clodius, how little your  countrymen know of the true versatility of a Pericles, of the true  witcheries of an Aspasia!  It was but the other day that I paid a visit  to Pliny: he was sitting in his summer-house writing, while an  unfortunate slave played on the tibia.  His nephew (oh! whip me such  philosophical coxcombs!) was reading Thucydides' description of the  plague, and nodding his conceited little head in time to the music,  while his lips were repeating all the loathsome details of that terrible  delineation. The puppy saw nothing incongruous in learning at the same  time a ditty of love and a description of the plague.'    'Why, they are much the same thing,' said Clodius.    'So I told him, in excuse for his coxcombry--but my youth stared me  rebukingly in the face, without taking the jest, and answered, that it  was only the insensate ear that the music pleased, whereas the book (the  description of the plague, mind you!) elevated the heart.  \"Ah!\" quoth  the fat uncle, wheezing, \"my boy is quite an Athenian, always mixing the  utile with the dulce.\" O Minerva, how I laughed in my sleeve!  While I  was there, they came to tell the boy-sophist that his favorite freedman  was just dead of a fever.  \"Inexorable death!\" cried he; \"get me my  Horace."]]]
