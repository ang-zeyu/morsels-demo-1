Pupa of White Butterfly (_Pieris_)                 85          CHAPTER I    INTRODUCTION      Among the manifold operations of living creatures few have more strongly  impressed the casual observer or more deeply interested the thoughtful  student than the transformations of insects. The schoolboy watches the  tiny green caterpillars hatched from eggs laid on a cabbage leaf by the  common white butterfly, or maybe rears successfully a batch of silkworms  through the changes and chances of their lives, while the naturalist  questions yet again the 'how' and 'why' of these common though wondrous  life-stories, as he seeks to trace their course more fully than his  predecessors knew.    [Illustration: Fig. 1. _a_, Diamond-back Moth (_Plutella  cruciferarum_); _b_, young caterpillar, dorsal view; _c_, full-grown  caterpillar, dorsal view; _d_, side view; _e_, pupa, ventral view.  Magnified 6 times. From _Journ. Dept. Agric. Ireland_, vol. I.]    Everyone is familiar with the main facts of such a life-story as that of  a moth or butterfly. The form of the adult insect (fig. 1 _a_) is  dominated by the wings--two pairs of scaly wings, carried respectively  on the middle and hindmost of the three segments that make up the  _thorax_ or central region of the insect's body. Each of these three  segments carries a pair of legs. In front of the thorax is the head on  which the pair of long jointed feelers and the pair of large,  sub-globular, compound eyes are the most prominent features. Below the  head, however, may be seen, now coiled up like a watch-spring, now  stretched out to draw the nectar from some scented blossom, the  butterfly's sucking trunk or proboscis, situated between a pair of short  hairy limbs or palps (fig. 2). These palps belong to the appendages of  the hindmost segment of the head, appendages which in insects are  modified to form a hind-lip or _labium_, bounding the mouth cavity below  or behind. The proboscis is made up of the pair of jaw-appendages in  front of the labium, the _maxillae_, as they are called. Behind the  thorax is situated the _abdomen,_ made up of nine or ten recognisable  segments, none of which carry limbs comparable to the walking legs, or  to the jaws which are the modified limbs of the head-segments. The whole  cuticle or outer covering of the body, formed (as is usual in the group  of animals to which insects belong) of a horny (chitinous) secretion of  the skin, is firm and hard, and densely covered with hairy or scaly  outgrowths. Along the sides of the insect are a series of paired  openings or spiracles, leading to a set of air-tubes which ramify  throughout the body and carry oxygen directly to the tissues.    [Illustration: Fig. 2. A. Head of a typical Moth, showing proboscis  formed by flexible maxillae (_g_) between the labial palps (_p_); _c_,  face; _e_, eye; the structure _m_ has been regarded as the vestige of a  mandible. B. Basal part (_b_) of maxilla removed from head, with  vestigial palp (_p_). Magnified.]    Such a butterfly as we have briefly sketched lays an egg on the leaf of  some suitable food-plant, and there is hatched from it the well-known  crawling larva[1] (fig. 1 _b, c, d_) called a caterpillar, offering in  many superficial features a marked contrast to its parent. Except on the  head, whose surface is hard and firm, the caterpillar's cuticle is as a  rule thin and flexible, though it may carry a protective armature of  closely set hairs, or strong sharp spines. The feelers (fig. 3 _At_) are  very short and the eyes are small and simple. In connection with the  mouth, there are present in front of the maxillae a pair of _mandibles_  (fig. 3 _Mn_), strong jaws, adapted for biting solid food, which are  absent from the adult butterfly, though well developed in cockroaches,  dragon-flies, beetles, and many other insects. The three pairs of legs  on the segments of the thorax are relatively short, and as many as five  segments of the abdomen may carry short cylindrical limbs or pro-legs,  which assist the clinging habits and worm-like locomotion of the  caterpillar. No trace of wings is visible externally. The caterpillar,  therefore, differs markedly from its parent in its outward structure, in  its mode of progression, and in its manner of feeding; for while the  butterfly sucks nectar or other liquid food, the caterpillar bites up  and devours solid vegetable substances, such as the leaves of herbs or  trees. It is well-known that between the close of its larval life and  its attainment of perfection as a butterfly, the insect spends a  period as a _pupa_ (fig. 1 "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1642"],[0,"Euthyphro (#1)"],[1,"By Plato      Translated by Benjamin Jowett          INTRODUCTION.    In the Meno, Anytus had parted from Socrates with the significant words:  'That in any city, and particularly in the city of Athens, it is easier  to do men harm than to do them good;' and Socrates was anticipating  another opportunity of talking with him. In the Euthyphro, Socrates is  awaiting his trial for impiety. But before the trial begins, Plato would  like to put the world on their trial, and convince them of ignorance in  that very matter touching which Socrates is accused. An incident which  may perhaps really have occurred in the family of Euthyphro, a  learned Athenian diviner and soothsayer, furnishes the occasion of the  discussion.    This Euthyphro and Socrates are represented as meeting in the porch of  the King Archon. (Compare Theaet.) Both have legal business in hand.  Socrates is defendant in a suit for impiety which Meletus has brought  against him (it is remarked by the way that he is not a likely man  himself to have brought a suit against another); and Euthyphro too is  plaintiff in an action for murder, which he has brought against his  own father. The latter has originated in the following manner:--A poor  dependant of the family had slain one of their domestic slaves in Naxos.  The guilty person was bound and thrown into a ditch by the command of  Euthyphro's father, who sent to the interpreters of religion at Athens  to ask what should be done with him. Before the messenger came back the  criminal had died from hunger and exposure.    This is the origin of the charge of murder which Euthyphro brings  against his father. Socrates is confident that before he could have  undertaken the responsibility of such a prosecution, he must have been  perfectly informed of the nature of piety and impiety; and as he is  going to be tried for impiety himself, he thinks that he cannot do  better than learn of Euthyphro (who will be admitted by everybody,  including the judges, to be an unimpeachable authority) what piety is,  and what is impiety. What then is piety?    Euthyphro, who, in the abundance of his knowledge, is very willing to  undertake all the responsibility, replies: That piety is doing as I do,  prosecuting your father (if he is guilty) on a charge of murder; doing  as the gods do--as Zeus did to Cronos, and Cronos to Uranus.    Socrates has a dislike to these tales of mythology, and he fancies that  this dislike of his may be the reason why he is charged with impiety.  'Are they really true?' 'Yes, they are;' and Euthyphro will gladly tell  Socrates some more of them. But Socrates would like first of all to have  a more satisfactory answer to the question, 'What is piety?' 'Doing as  I do, charging a father with murder,' may be a single instance of piety,  but can hardly be regarded as a general definition.    Euthyphro replies, that 'Piety is what is dear to the gods, and impiety  is what is not dear to them.' But may there not be differences of  opinion, as among men, so also among the gods? Especially, about good  and evil, which have no fixed rule; and these are precisely the sort of  differences which give rise to quarrels. And therefore what may be dear  to one god may not be dear to another, and the same action may be both  pious and impious; e.g. your chastisement of your father, Euthyphro, may  be dear or pleasing to Zeus (who inflicted a similar chastisement on his  own father), but not equally pleasing to Cronos or Uranus (who suffered  at the hands of their sons).    Euthyphro answers that there is no difference of opinion, either among  gods or men, as to the propriety of punishing a murderer. Yes, rejoins  Socrates, when they know him to be a murderer; but you are assuming the  point at issue. If all the circumstances of the case are considered, are  you able to show that your father was guilty of murder, or that all the  gods are agreed in approving of our prosecution of him? And must you  not allow that what is hated by one god may be liked by another? Waiving  this last, however, Socrates proposes to amend the definition, and  say that 'what all the gods love is pious, and what they all hate is  impious.' To this Euthyphro agrees.    Socrates proceeds to analyze the new form of the definition. He shows  that in other cases the act precedes the state; e.g. the act of being  carried, loved, etc. precedes the state of being carried, loved, etc.,  and therefore that which is dear to the gods is dear to the gods because  it is first loved of them, not loved of them because it is dear to them.  But the pious or holy is loved by the gods because it is pious or holy,  which is equivalent to saying, that it is loved by them because it is  dear to them. Here then appears to be a contradiction,--Euthyphro has  been giving an attribute or accident of piety only, and not the essence.  Euthyphro acknowledges himself that his explanations seem to walk  away or go round in a circle, like the moving figures of Daedalus, the  ancestor of Socrates, who has communicated his art to his descendants.    Socrates, who is desirous of stimulating the indolent intelligence of  Euthyphro, raises the question in another manner: 'Is all the pious  just?' 'Yes.' 'Is all the just pious?' 'No.' 'Then what part of justice  is piety?' Euthyphro replies that piety is that part of justice which  'attends' to the gods, as there is another part of justice which  'attends' to men. But what is the meaning of 'attending' to the gods?  The word 'attending,' when applied to dogs, horses, and men, implies  that in some way they are made better. But how do pious or holy acts  make the gods any better? Euthyphro explains that he means by pious  acts, acts of service or ministration. Yes; but the ministrations of the  husbandman, the physician, and the builder have an end. To what end do  we serve the gods, and what do we help them to accomplish? Euthyphro  replies, that all these difficult questions cannot be resolved in a  short time; and he would rather say simply that piety is knowing how to  please the gods in word and deed, by prayers and sacrifices. In other  words, says Socrates, piety is 'a science of asking and giving'--asking  what we want and giving what they want; in short, a mode of doing  business between gods and men. But although they are the givers of all  good, how can we give them any good in return? 'Nay, but we give them  honour.' Then we give them not what is beneficial, but what is pleasing  or dear to them; and this is the point which has been already disproved.    Socrates, although weary of the subterfuges and evasions of Euthyphro,  remains unshaken in his conviction that he must know the nature of  piety, or he would never have prosecuted his old father. He is still  hoping that he will condescend to instruct him. But Euthyphro is in a  hurry and cannot stay. And Socrates' last hope of knowing the nature  of piety before he is prosecuted for impiety has disappeared. As in the  Euthydemus the irony is carried on to the end.    The Euthyphro is manifestly designed to contrast the real nature of  piety and impiety with the popular conceptions of them. But when the  popular conceptions of them have been overthrown, Socrates does not  offer any definition of his own: as in the Laches and Lysis, he prepares  the way for an answer to the question which he has raised; but true to  his own character, refuses to answer himself.    Euthyphro is a religionist, and is elsewhere spoken of, if he be the  same person, as the author of a philosophy of names, by whose 'prancing  steeds' Socrates in the Cratylus is carried away. He has the conceit and  self-confidence of a Sophist; no doubt that he is right in prosecuting  his father has ever entered into his mind. Like a Sophist too, he is  incapable either of framing a general definition or of following the  course of an argument. His wrong-headedness, one-sidedness, narrowness,  positiveness, are characteristic of his priestly office. His failure  to apprehend an argument may be compared to a similar defect which  is observable in the rhapsode Ion. But he is not a bad man, and he is  friendly to Socrates, whose familiar sign he recognizes with interest.  Though unable to follow him he is very willing to be led by him, and  eagerly catches at any suggestion which saves him from the trouble  of thinking. Moreover he is the enemy of Meletus, who, as he says, is  availing himself of the popular dislike to innovations in religion in  order to injure Socrates; at the same time he is amusingly confident  that he has weapons in his own armoury which would be more than a match  for him. He is quite sincere in his prosecution of his father, who has  accidentally been guilty of homicide, and is not wholly free from blame.  To purge away the crime appears to him in the light of a duty, whoever  may be the criminal.    Thus begins the contrast between the religion of the letter, or of the  narrow and unenlightened conscience, and the higher notion of religion  which Socrates vainly endeavours to elicit from him. 'Piety is doing  as I do' is the idea of religion which first occurs to him, and to many  others who do not say what they think with equal frankness. For men are  not easily persuaded that any other religion is better than their own;  or that other nations, e.g. the Greeks in the time of Socrates, were  equally serious in their religious beliefs and difficulties. The chief  difference between us and them is, that they were slowly learning what  we are in process of forgetting. Greek mythology hardly admitted of the  distinction between accidental homicide and murder: that the pollution  of blood was the same in both cases is also the feeling of the Athenian  diviner. He had not as yet learned the lesson, which philosophy was  teaching, that Homer and Hesiod, if not banished from the state, or  whipped out of the assembly, as Heracleitus more rudely proposed, at any  rate "]]]
