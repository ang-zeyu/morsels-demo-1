[Illustration: Country house]    PHILEMON AND BAUCIS    I      Long ago, on a high hill in Greece, Philemon and Baucis lived.    They were poor, but they were never unhappy. They had many hives of bees  from which they got honey, and many vines from which they gathered  grapes. One old cow gave them all the milk that they could use, and they  had a little field in which grain was raised.    The old couple had as much as they needed, and were always ready to  share whatever they had with any one in want. No stranger was ever  turned from their door.    At the foot of the hill lay a beautiful village, with pleasant roads and  rich pasture lands all around. But it was full of wicked, selfish,  people, who had no love in their hearts and thought only of themselves.    At the time of this story, the people in the village were very busy.  Zeus, who they believed ruled the world, had sent word that he was about  to visit them. They were preparing a great feast and making everything  beautiful for his coming.    One evening, just at dark, two beggars came into the valley. They  stopped at every house and asked for food and a place to sleep; but the  people were too busy or too tired to attend to their needs. They were  thinking only of the coming of Zeus.    Footsore and weary, the two beggars at last climbed the hill to the hut  of Philemon and Baucis. These good people had eaten very little, for  they were saving their best food for Zeus.    When they saw the beggars, Philemon said, \"Surely these men need food  more than Zeus. They look almost starved.\"    \"Indeed, they do!\" said Baucis, and she ran quickly to prepare supper  for the strangers.    She spread her best white cloth upon the table, and brought out bacon,  herbs, honey, grapes, bread, and milk. She set these upon the table in  all the best dishes she had and called the strangers in.    Then what do you suppose happened? The dishes that the strangers touched  turned to gold. The pitcher was never empty, although they drank glass  after glass of milk. The loaf of bread stayed always the same size,  although the strangers cut slice after slice.    \"These are strange travelers,\" whispered the old couple to each other.  \"They do wonderful things.\"      II      That night Philemon and Baucis slept upon the floor that the strangers  might have their one bed. In the morning they went with the travelers to  the foot of the hill to see them safely started on their way.    \"Now, good people,\" said one of the strangers, \"we thank you, and  whatever you wish shall be yours.\"    As he said this, his face became like that of the sun. Then Philemon and  Baucis knew that Zeus had spoken to them.    \"Grant, O Zeus, that one of us may not outlive the other,\" they cried in  one voice.    \"Your wish is granted,\" said Zeus; \"yes, and more. Return to your home  and be happy.\"    [Illustration: Philemon and Baucis walking home]    Philemon and Baucis turned homeward, and, lo! their hut was changed to a  beautiful castle.    The old people turned around to thank their guests, but they had  disappeared.    In this castle Philemon and Baucis lived many years. They still did all  they could for others, and were always so happy that they never thought  of wishing anything for themselves.

ROCHESTER                         To          MY BELOVED PARENTS  in reverence and gratitude for their      beautiful and holy example          FOREWORD      My dear Mrs. Trager,    It gives me great pleasure to write a preface to your new book. I  consider it a real privilege, since it represents the fulfilment of a  hope expressed some five years ago. When you sent me the first article  for \"The Sinaist\" I told you that your pen would win the love and the  esteem not only of the child, but essentially also of the adult readers.    The simple joyousness of your style, the beauty and freshness of the  atmosphere, which you very well succeed in bringing to the pages of your  books, the strength of your faith, and the vividness of your  description, the love of Jew above the love of Palestine, all these  combine to render your volumes valuable additions to the small stock of  good Jewish literature in English. It is not only that you teach, while  talking so pleasantly; that you instruct while you interest and amuse;  that you have your own personality in the stories; that you convey the  charm of Eretz Israel, and the beauty of holiday spirit; but because  your stories help us to feel the depth of faith and the height of ideal  as the self-evident, normal factors of Jewish life.    For the children of our age, both young and old, should know that that  God-consciousness of the Jew, that wondrous sense of eternity in his  mission, is not a laboriously acquired conviction, not the result of  some spasmodic effort of grasping the innermost meaning of our history,  but the natural pervading spirit of Jewish life, the air which the Jew  breathes, when he lives with Torah as his guide and Mitzvah as his  ladder towards heaven.    They who read your stories conceive a deep love of Judaism, they find a  desire growing in them to live the life which produces such happiness  and goodness, they will want to study the Law and lore, of which that  life is an outward expression. I have given your tales to children in  various countries and all of them were enchanted with them, regretting  that \"there were only two books by Mrs. Trager.\" I am glad indeed to  find that another one is coming out. And it is in the interest of our  youth that I hope you will give us every year some of these nourishing  and very palatable fruits of your pen.    You will thereby be doing an additional bit for our God and our people  whom you are serving so loyally. You reinterpret to the Jewish youth of  to-day the treasures they are so carelessly abandoning, you will shed  light and reawaken love and hope in the heart of many a Jew, who seemed  to feel that our glorious faith had no message for the child of to-day,  unless it were shorn by our 'religious' barbers, robbed of its native  beauty and reduced to some platform-commonplace. As a lamented London  Maggid told me, \"There still live some real soldiers of God.\" Such are  those who use persuasion from the pulpit, such as shine through the  example of their own humane Jewishness and such as capture our hearts by  artless beautiful tales of Jewish life and lore.    I wish you every success in the world,    Yours very sincerely,    LEO JUNG          CONTENTS    THE ARRIVAL IN JERUSALEM  THE WELCOME  THE CELEBRATION OF PURIM  THE BAKING OF MATZOS  LAG B'OMER  THE SABBATH IN PALESTINE  THE SUCCAH  HOW CHARITY IS GIVEN  FATHER FROST IN JERUSALEM  ENGAGEMENT AND WEDDING CEREMONIES  JUBILEE OF ZORACH BARNETT  GLOSSARY          LIST OF ILLUSTRATIONS    THE FATHER TEACHING THE CHILD THE MEANING OF THE TSITSITH  CHADAR (SCHOOL)  YENSHVA (TALMUDICAL SCHOOL)  THE OLD LADY          THE ARRIVAL IN JERUSALEM      On a Friday afternoon everyone was very busy in Benjamin's home washing  and dressing to go to Shule. The mother was getting the living-room  clean and tidy for the Sabbath.      THE OFFENCE    The family lived in a few rooms off Commercial Road, in one of the many  back streets. The underground kitchen had to be used as the dining-and  sitting-room, for they had not been many years in England and it was a  hard struggle for Benjamin's parents to make ends meet and provide for a  large family.    The father and the elder boys were dressing as best they could in this  room. Just then the mother came in, very excited, and said to her  husband: \"What will you say to this? I gave Benjamin his Sabbath clothes  and a clean tsitsith, and what do you think he did?\"    \"What?\" asked the father, and stopped brushing his clothes.    \"Why, he took the tsitsith and threw it on the floor, and said he would  never wear it again. I punished him, and told him to put it on again. So  you had better go to him and give him what he deserves.\"    \"You are rather hasty, my dear wife,\" said the father; \"for, before  punishing him, you should have asked him why he did such a thing.\"    \"What!\" exclaimed the mother, \"do you think I have nothing else to do  but to stand and argue with him just before Sabbath, when I have so much  work? You are far too easy-going, Jacob--you should really be firmer  with the children.\"    \"No, no!\" said Jacob, who was a kindly man and understood human nature  better than his hasty, but well-meaning and loving, wife. The struggle  and constant hard work in keeping the home of a large family was telling  upon her, and any disobedience in the children irritated her very much.    \"We must not be hasty with the children,\" continued Jacob, \"especially  now-a-days, for they live under different circumstances from those we  knew when we were young. Instead of hastily scolding and punishing them,  let us rather quietly reason with them, when possible, and show them  where they are wrong.\"    \"Perhaps you may be right,\" said Benjamin's mother; \"so let us leave the  matter till you return from Shule and have had our Sabbath meal--then  you can quietly ask Benjamin why he acted as he did.\"      THE BOY BENJAMIN    An elder brother was sent to call Benjamin to go to Shule with his  father and brothers. Benjamin expected a scolding from his father  similar to that which he had had from his mother, so he came into the  room looking very sulky. As nothing was said to him on the subject when  he came into the room, he took his prayer-book, and followed his father  to Shule.    Benjamin was like many other boys of 13, not very clever, but blessed  with a good deal of common sense. His great ambition was to become a  teacher, and so he worked steadily at his lessons. His reason for  wishing to be a teacher was that he wanted to rule and to punish boys as  his master did. Whenever he had a caning from his headmaster he always  consoled himself with the thought that _his_ turn would come some  day--when he was a teacher--to do the same to other boys.    When they returned from Shule and nothing was said, even at the evening  meal, about the way Benjamin had annoyed his mother, he was rather  surprised. His mother, during the time they were at Shule, had made the  living-room, which was really the kitchen, look so clean and bright with  the five lighted candles placed on the snow-white table-cloth, and the  old stove so well polished, that it almost looked as bright as a looking  glass. What interested the young ones most was the saucepan which stood  on one side of the stove waiting for its contents to be put on the  table, and, oh, how they enjoyed the sweet savour which came from it!      FRIDAY EVE    They all gathered round the table to welcome the Princess Sabbath. The  father made kiddush, and the wine cup was handed round to all. Then they  washed their hands and said a prayer before sitting down to the evening  meal, which passed off very pleasantly, and zmires (or songs or psalms  of praise) were sung at intervals during the meal.    When the meal was ended, and the grace said by the father, they all  separated: one or two went out for a walk, while the other members of  the family took a newspaper or a book and quietly read.    When the table was cleared, the mother sat down to rest. Grateful,  indeed, was she for this Sabbath rest after her week's hard work. She  often said that, for such as herself, no blessing was as great as the  command: \"Thou shalt not do any work on the Sabbath.\"      WORD OF LOVE    When all were quietly settled down, Benjamin's father took him between  his knees, and said: \"My son, I wish to ask you something, and I want  you to answer my question frankly and truly. What made you throw the  tsitsith down on the floor this afternoon and say to your mother that  you would not wear it?\"    The boy Benjamin dropped his head and was silent for a minute or two,  for to hear his father speak in a kindly way made Benjamin far more  ashamed of himself and his deed than if his father had scolded him and  given him a whipping--in fact, he felt so wretched that he longed to run  out of the room and hide himself from everybody. His father's knowledge  of human nature made him understand what was passing through Benjamin's  mind, and he said: \"Do not fear to tell me, my son, why you acted in  such an unusual way, for there must be some reason for a Jewish boy to  act so.\"    With his head still down, Benjamin said: \"When I go swimming in the  baths, my school-fellows see my tsitsith when I undress, and they make  fun of it and pull it about, and say all sorts of nasty things to me for  wearing it, and it makes me feel I cannot stand it any longer. I will  gladly put on my tsitsith at home in the morning when I say my prayers,  but, Father, do let me go to school without wearing it?\""]]]
