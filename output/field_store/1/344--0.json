To meet the calls so frequently made upon as by intelligent visitors  to our City, for some work descriptive of the Mammoth Cave, we are, at  length, enabled to present the public a succinct, but instructive  narrative of a visit to this \"Wonder of Wonders,\" from the pen of a  gentleman, who, without professing to have explored ALL that is  curious or beautiful or sublime in its vast recesses, has yet seen  every thing that has been seen by others, and has described enough to  quicken and enlighten the curiosity of those who have never visited  it.    Aware of the embarrassment which most persons experience who design  visiting the Cave, owing to the absence of any printed itinerary of  the various routes leading to it, we have supplied, in the present  volume, this desideratum, from information received from reliable  persons residing on the different roads here enumerated. The road from  Louisville to the Cave, and thence to Nashville, is graded the entire  distance, and the greater part of it M'Adamized. From Louisville to  the mouth of Salt river, twenty miles, the country is level, with a  rich alluvial soil, probably at some former period the bed of a lake.  A few miles below the former place and extending to the latter, a  chain of elevated hills is seen to the South-East, affording beautiful  and picturesque situations for country seats, and strangely overlooked  by the rich and tasteful. The river is crossed by a ferry, and the  traveler is put down at a comfortable inn in the village of West  Point. Two miles from the mouth of Salt river, begins the ascent of  Muldrow's Hill. The road is excellent, and having elevated hills on  either side, is highly romantic to its summit, five miles. From the  top of this hill to Elizabethtown, the country is well settled, though  the improvements are generally indifferent--the soil thin, but well  adapted to small-grain, and oak the prevailing growth. Elizabethtown,  twenty-five miles from the mouth of Salt river, is quite a pretty and  flourishing village, built chiefly of brick, with several churches and  three large inns. From this place to Nolin creek, the distance is ten  miles. Here there is a small town, containing some ten or twelve log  houses, a large saw and grist mill, and a comfortable and very neat  inn, kept by Mr. Mosher. Immediately after crossing this creek, the  traveler enters \"Yankee Street,\" as the inhabitants style this section  of the road. For a distance of ten or twelve miles from Nolin toward  Bacon creek, the land belongs, or did belong to the former Postmaster  General, Gideon Granger, and on either side of the road, to the extent  of Mr. G.'s possessions, are settlements made by emigrants from New  York and the New England States. From Bacon creek to Munfordsville,  eight miles, the country is pleasantly undulating, and here, indeed  the whole route from Elizabethtown to the Cave, passes through what  was until recently a Prairie, or, in the language of the country,  \"Barrens,\" and renders it highly interesting, especially to the  botanist, from the multitude and variety of flowers with which it  abounds during the Spring and Autumn months. Munfordsville, and  Woodsonville directly opposite, are situated on Green river, on high  and broken ground. They are small places, in each of which, however,  are comfortable inns. Boats laden with tobacco and other produce,  descend from this point and from a considerable distance above, to New  Orleans. About two and a half miles beyond Munfordsville, the new  State road to the Cave, (virtually made by Dr. Croghan, at a great  expense,) leaves the Turnpike, and joins it again at the Dripping  Springs, eight miles below, on the route to Nashville. This road, in  going from Louisville to Nashville, is not only the shortest by three  and a half miles, but to the Cave it is from ten to twelve miles  shorter than the one taken by visiters previous to its construction.  It therefore lessens the inconvenience, delay and consequent expense  to which travelers were formerly subjected. The road itself is an  excellent one, the country through which it passes highly picturesque,  and Dr. Croghan has entitled himself to the gratitude of the traveling  community by his liberality and enterprise in constructing it.    Persons visiting the Cave by Steamer, (a boat leaves Louisville for  Bowling-Green every week) will find much to interest them in the  admirable locks and dams, rendering the navigation of Green river safe  and good at all seasons for boats of a large class. Passengers can  obtain conveyances at all times and at moderate rates, from  Bowling-Green, by the Dripping Spring, to the Cave, distant twenty-two  miles. Fifteen miles of this road is M'Adamized, the remainder is  graded and not inferior to the finished portion. The last eight miles  from the Dripping Spring to the Cave, cannot fail to excite the  admiration of every one who delights in beholding wild and beautiful  scenery. A visit to the Cedar Springs on this route, is alone worth a  journey of many miles. Passengers on the upper turnpike, from  Bardstown to Nashville, can, on reaching Glasgow, at all times procure  conveyances to the Cave, either by Bell's or by Prewett's Knob.    Arrived at the Cave, the visitor alights at a spacious hotel, the  general arrangements, attendance and _cuisine_ of which, are adapted  to the most fastidious taste. He feels that as far as the \"creature  comforts\" are necessary to enjoyment, the prospect is full of promise;  nor will he be disappointed. And now, this first and most important  preliminary to a traveler settled to his perfect content, he may  remain for weeks and experience daily gratification, \"_Stephen_ his  guide,\" in wandering through some of its two hundred and twenty-six  avenues--in gazing, until he is oppressed with the feeling of their  magnificence, at some of its forty-seven domes,--in listening,  until their drowsy murmurs pain the sense, to some of its many  water-falls,--or haply intent upon discovery, he hails some new vista,  or fretted roof, or secret river, or unsounded lake, or crystal  fountain, with as much rapture as Balboa, from \"that peak in Darien,\"  gazed on the Pacific; he is assured that he \"has a poet,\" and an  historian too. Stephen has linked his name to dome, or avenue, or  river, and it is already immortal--in the Cave.    Independent of the attractions to be found in the Cave, there is much  above ground to gratify the different tastes of visiters. There is a  capacious ball-room, ninety feet by thirty, with a fine band of  music,--a ten-pin alley,--romantic walks and carriage-drives in all  directions, rendered easy of access by the fine road recently  finished. The many rare and beautiful flowers in the immediate  vicinity of the Cave, invite to exercise, and bouquets as exquisite as  were ever culled in garden or green-house, may be obtained even as  late as August. The fine sport the neighborhood affords to the hunter  and the angler--Green river, just at hand, offers such \"store of  fish,\" as father Walton or his son and disciple Cotton, were they  alive again, would love to meditate and angle in!--and the woods!  Capt. Scott or Christopher North himself, might grow weary of the  sight of game, winged or quadruped.          INTERESTING FACTS.       1. Accidents of no kind have ever occurred in the Mammoth Cave.     2. Visiters, going in or coming out of the Cave, are not liable to  contract colds; on the contrary, colds are commonly relieved by a  visit in the Cave.     3. No impure air exists in any part of the Cave.     4. Reptiles, of no description, have ever been seen in the Cave; on  the contrary, they, as well as quadrupeds, avoid it.     5. Combustion is perfect in all parts of the Cave.     6. Decomposition and consequent putrefaction are unobservable in all  parts of the Cave.     7. The water of the Cave is of the purest kind; and, besides fresh  water, there are one or two sulphur springs.     8. There are two hundred and twenty-six Avenues in the Cave;  forty-seven Domes; eight Cataracts, and twenty-three Pits.     9. The temperature of the Cave is 59 deg. Fahrenheit, and remains so,  uniformly, winter and Summer.    10. No sound, not even the loudest peal of thunder, is heard one  quarter of a mile in the Cave.           *       *       *       *       *    The author of \"Rambles in the Mammoth Cave,\" has written a scientific  account of the Cave, embracing its Geology, Mineralogy, etc., which we  could not, in time, insert in this publication.

TO THE REVEREND JOHN LODGE, M.A.  FELLOW OF MAGDALEN COLLEGE, AND  LIBRARIAN TO THE UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE.      MY DEAR FRIEND,      Most grateful it is to me, at all times, to bear in remembrance those  pleasant discussions in which we were wont so frequently to indulge,  relating to the LIBRARIES upon the Continent:--but more than ordinarily  gratifying to me was _that_ moment, when you told me, that, on crossing the  Rhine, you took the third volume of my Tour under your arm, and on reaching  the Monasteries of Moelk and Goettwic, gave an off-hand translation to the  venerable Benedictine Inmates of what I had recorded concerning their MSS.  and Printed Books, and their hospitable reception of the Author. I  studiously concealed from You, at the time, the whole of the gratification  which that intelligence imparted; resolving however that, should this work  be deemed worthy of a second edition, to dedicate that republication to  YOURSELF. Accordingly, it now comes forth in its present form, much  enhanced, in the estimation of its Author, by the respectability of the  name prefixed to this Dedication; and wishing you many years enjoyment of  the honourable public situation with which you have been recently, and so  deservedly, invested, allow me to subscribe myself,      Your affectionate  and obliged Friend,    T.F.

PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION.      If I had chosen to introduce myself to the greatest possible advantage to  the reader, in this Preface to a Second Edition of the \"_Bibliographical,  Antiquarian, and Picturesque Tour_,\" I could not have done better than have  borrowed the language of those Foreigners, who, by a translation of the  Work (however occasionally vituperative their criticisms) have, in fact,  conferred an honour upon its Author. In the midst of censure, sometimes  dictated by spite, and sometimes sharpened by acrimony of feeling, it were  in my power to select passages of commendation, which would not less  surprise the Reader than they have done myself: while the history of this  performance may be said to exhibit the singular phenomenon, of a traveller,  usually lauding the countries through which he passes, receiving in return  the reluctant approbation of those whose institutions, manners, and  customs, have been praised by him. It is admitted, by the most sedulous and  systematic of my opponents--M. CRAPELET--that \"considering the quantity and  quality of the ornaments and engravings of this Tour, one is surprised that  its cost is so moderate.\"[1]    \"Few books (says the Bibliographer of Dijon) have been executed with  greater luxury. It is said that the expenses of printing and engraving  amounted to 6000 l.--to nearly 140,000 franks of our money. It must be  admitted that England is the only country in which such an undertaking  could be carried into effect. Who in France would dare to risk such a  sum--especially for three, volumes in octavo? He would be ruined, if he  did.\"[2] I quote these passages simply to shew under what extraordinary  obliquity of feeling those gentlemen must have set down to the task of  translation and abuse--of THAT VERY WORK, which is here admitted to contain  such splendid representations of the \"bibliographical, antiquarian, and  picturesque\" beauties of their country.    A brief account of this foreign _travail_ may be acceptable to the curious  in literary history. MONS. LICQUET, the successor of M. Gourdin, as Chief  Librarian to the Public Library at Rouen, led the way in the work of  warfare. He translated the ninth Letter relating to that Public Library; of  which"]]]
