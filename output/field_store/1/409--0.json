Girdled about with the immense darkness of this  mysterious universe even as we are, they were born and died, suffered  and struggled. Given over to fearful crime and passion, plunged in  the blackest ignorance, preyed upon by hideous and grotesque delusions,  yet steadfastly serving the profoundest of ideals in their fixed faith  that existence in any form is better than non-existence, they ever  rescued triumphantly from the jaws of ever-imminent destruction the  torch of life which, thanks to them, now lights the world for us. How  small, indeed, seem individual distinctions when we look back on these  overwhelming numbers of human beings panting and straining under the  pressure of that vital want! And how inessential in the eyes of God  must be the small surplus of the individual's merit, swamped as it  is in the vast ocean of the common merit of mankind, dumbly and  undauntedly doing the fundamental duty, and living the heroic life!  We grow humble and reverent as we contemplate the prodigious  spectacle.\"    WILLIAM JAMES, in _Human Immortality_.          ANTHROPOLOGY          CHAPTER I  SCOPE OF ANTHROPOLOGY      In this chapter I propose to say something, firstly, about the ideal  scope of anthropology; secondly, about its ideal limitations; and,  thirdly and lastly, about its actual relations to existing studies.  In other words, I shall examine the extent of its claim, and then go  on to examine how that claim, under modern conditions of science and  education, is to be made good.    Firstly, then, what is the ideal scope of anthropology? Taken at its  fullest and best, what ought it to comprise?    Anthropology is the whole history of man as fired and pervaded by the  idea of evolution. Man in evolution--that is the subject in its full  reach. Anthropology studies man as he occurs at all known times. It  studies him as he occurs in all known parts of the world. It studies  him body and soul together--as a bodily organism, subject to conditions  operating in time and space, which bodily organism is in intimate  relation with a soul-life, also subject to those same conditions.  Having an eye to such conditions from first to last, it seeks to plot  out the general series of the changes, bodily and mental together,  undergone by man in the course of his history. Its business is simply  to describe. But, without exceeding the limits of its scope, it can  and must proceed from the particular to the general; aiming at nothing  less than a descriptive formula that shall sum up the whole series  of changes in which the evolution of man consists.    That will do, perhaps, as a short account of the ideal scope of  anthropology. Being short, it is bound to be rather formal and  colourless. To put some body into it, however, it is necessary to  breathe but a single word. That word is: Darwin.    Anthropology is the child of Darwin. Darwinism makes it possible.  Reject the Darwinian point of view, and you must reject anthropology  also. What, then, is Darwinism? Not a cut-and-dried doctrine. Not a  dogma. Darwinism is a working hypothesis. You suppose something to  be true, and work away to see whether, in the light of that supposed  truth, certain facts fit together better than they do on any other  supposition. What is the truth that Darwinism supposes? Simply that  all the forms of life in the world are related together; and that the  relations manifested in time and space between the different lives  are sufficiently uniform to be described under a general formula, or  law of evolution.    This means that man must, for certain purposes of science, toe the  line with the rest of living things. And at first, naturally enough,  man did not like it. He was too lordly. For a long time, therefore,  he pretended to be fighting for the Bible, when he was really fighting  for his own dignity. This was rather hard on the Bible, which has  nothing to do with the Aristotelian theory of the fixity of species;  though it might seem possible to read back something of the kind into  the primitive creation-stories preserved in Genesis. Now-a-days,  however, we have mostly got over the first shock to our family pride.  We are all Darwinians in a passive kind of way. But we need to darwinize  actively. In the sciences that have to do with plants, and with the  rest of the animals besides man, naturalists have been so active in  their darwinizing that the pre-Darwinian stuff is once for all laid  by on the shelf. When man, however, engages on the subject of his noble  self, the tendency still is to say: We accept Darwinism so long as  it is not allowed to count, so long as we may go on believing the same  old stuff in the same old way.    How do we anthropologists propose to combat this tendency? By working  away at our subject, and persuading people to have a look at our results.  Once people take up anthropology, they may be trusted not to drop it  again. It is like learning to sleep with your window open. What could  be more stupefying than to shut yourself up in a closet and swallow  your own gas? But is it any less stupefying to shut yourself up within  the last few thousand years of the history of your own corner of the  world, and suck in the stale atmosphere of its own self-generated  prejudices? Or, to vary the metaphor, anthropology is like travel.  Every one starts by thinking that there is nothing so perfect as his  own parish. But let a man go aboard ship to visit foreign parts, and,  when he returns home, he will cause that parish to wake up.    With Darwin, then, we anthropologists say: Let any and every portion  of human history be studied in the light of the whole history of mankind,  and against the background of the history of living things in general.  It is the Darwinian outlook that matters. None of Darwin's particular  doctrines will necessarily endure the test of time and trial. Into  the melting-pot must they go as often as any man of science deems it  fitting. But Darwinism as the touch of nature that makes the whole  world kin can hardly pass away. At any rate, anthropology stands or  falls with the working hypothesis, derived from Darwinism, of a  fundamental kinship and continuity amid change between all the forms  of human life.    It remains to add that, hitherto, anthropology has devoted most of  its attention to the peoples of rude--that is to say, of  simple--culture, who are vulgarly known to us as \"savages.\" The main  reason for this, I suppose, is that nobody much minds so long as the  darwinizing kind of history confines itself to outsiders. Only when  it is applied to self and friends is it resented as an impertinence.  But, although it has always up to now pursued the line of least  resistance, anthropology does not abate one jot or tittle of its claim  to be the whole science, in the sense of the whole history, of man.  As regards the word, call it science, or history, or anthropology,  or anything else--what does it matter? As regards the thing, however,  there can be no compromise. We anthropologists are out to secure this:  that there shall not be one kind of history for savages and another  kind for ourselves, but the same kind of history, with the same  evolutionary principle running right through it, for all men,  civilized and savage, present and past.           *       *       *       *       *    So much for the ideal scope of anthropology. Now, in the second place,  for its ideal limitations. Here, I am afraid, we must touch for a moment  on very deep and difficult questions. But it is well worth while to  try at all costs to get firm hold of the fact that anthropology, though  a big thing, is not everything.    It will be enough to insist briefly on the following points: that  anthropology is science in whatever way history is science; that it  is not philosophy, though it must conform to its needs; and that it  is not policy, though it may subserve its designs.    Anthropology is science in the sense of specialized research that aims  at truth for truth's sake. Knowing by parts is science, knowing the  whole as a whole is philosophy. Each supports the other, and there  is no profit in asking which of the two should come first. One is aware  of the universe as the whole universe, however much one may be resolved  to study its details one at a time. The scientific mood, however, is  uppermost when one says: Here is a particular lot of things that seem  to hang together in a particular way; let us try to get a general idea  of what that way is. Anthropology, then, specializes on the particular  group of human beings, which itself is part of the larger particular  group of living beings.

CHAPTER I.    THE EARLIER KINGS OF FRANCE.      1. France.--The country we now know as France is the tract of land  shut in by the British Channel, the Bay of Biscay, the Pyrenees, the  Mediterranean, and the Alps. But this country only gained the name of  France by degrees. In the earliest days of which we have any account, it  was peopled by the Celts, and it was known to the Romans as part of a  larger country which bore the name of Gaul. After all of it, save the  north-western moorlands, or what we now call Brittany, had been  conquered and settled by the Romans, it was overrun by tribes of the  great Teutonic race, the same family to which Englishmen belong. Of  these tribes, the Goths settled in the provinces to the south; the  Burgundians, in the east, around the Jura; while the Franks, coming  over the rivers in its unprotected north-eastern corner, and making  themselves masters of a far wider territory, broke up into two  kingdoms--that of the Eastern Franks in what is now Germany, and that of  the Western Franks reaching from the Rhine to the Atlantic. These Franks  subdued all the other Teutonic conquerors of Gaul, while they adopted  the religion, the language, and some of the civilization of the  Romanized Gauls who became their subjects. Under the second Frankish  dynasty, the Empire was renewed in the West, where it had been for a  time put an end to by these Teutonic invasions, and the then Frankish  king, Charles the Great, took his place as Emperor at its head. But in  the time of his grandsons the various kingdoms and nations of which the  Empire was composed, fell apart again under different descendants of  his. One of these, _Charles the Bald_, was made King of the Western  Franks in what was termed the Neustrian, or \"not eastern,\" kingdom, from  which the present France has sprung. This kingdom in name covered all  the country west of the Upper Meuse, but practically the Neustrian king  had little power south of the Loire; and the Celts of Brittany were  never included in it.      2. The House of Paris.--The great danger which this Neustrian kingdom  had to meet came from the Northmen, or as they were called in England  the Danes. These ravaged in Neustria as they ravaged in England; and a  large part of the northern coast, including the mouth of the Seine, was  given by Charles the Bald to Rolf or Rollo, one of their leaders, whose  land became known as the Northman's land, or Normandy. What most checked  the ravages of these pirates was the resistance of Paris, a town which  commanded the road along the river Seine; and it was in defending the  city of Paris from the Northmen, that a warrior named Robert the Strong  gained the trust and affection of the inhabitants of the Neustrian  kingdom. He and his family became Counts (_i.e._, judges and protectors)  of Paris, and Dukes (or leaders) of the Franks. Three generations of  them were really great men--Robert the Strong, Odo, and Hugh the White;  and when the descendants of Charles the Great had died out, a Duke of  the Franks, _Hugh Capet_, was in 987 crowned King of the Franks. All the  after kings of France down to Louis Philippe were descendants of Hugh  Capet. By this change, however, he gained little in real power; for,  though he claimed to rule over the whole country of the Neustrian  Franks, his authority was little heeded, save in the domain which he had  possessed as Count of Paris, including the cities of Paris, Orleans,  Amiens, and Rheims (the coronation place). He was guardian, too, of the  great Abbeys of St. Denys and St. Martin of Tours. The Duke of Normandy  and the Count of Anjou to the west, the Count of Flanders to the north,  the Count of Champagne to the east, and the Duke of Aquitaine to the  south, paid him homage, but were the only actual rulers in their own  domains.      3. The Kingdom of Hugh Capet.--The language of Hugh's kingdom was  clipped Latin; the peasantry and townsmen were mostly Gaulish; the  nobles were almost entirely Frank. There was an understanding that the  king could only act by their consent, and must be chosen by them; but  matters went more by old custom and the right of the strongest than by  any law. A Salic law, so called from the place whence the Franks had  come, was supposed to exist; but this had never been used by their  subjects, whose law remained that of the old Roman Empire. Both of these  systems of law, however, fell into disuse, and were replaced by rude  bodies of \"customs,\" which gradually grew up. The habits of the time  were exceedingly rude and ferocious. The Franks had been the fiercest  and most untamable of all the Teutonic nations, and only submitted  themselves to the influence of Christianity and civilization from the  respect which the Roman Empire inspired. Charles the Great had tried to  bring in Roman cultivation, but we find him reproaching the young Franks  in his schools with letting themselves be surpassed by the Gauls, whom  they despised; and in the disorders that followed his death, barbarism  increased again. The convents alone kept up any remnants of culture; but  as the fury of the Northmen was chiefly directed to them, numbers had  been destroyed, and there was more ignorance and wretchedness than at  any other time. In the duchy of Aquitaine, much more of the old Roman  civilization survived, both among the cities and the nobility; and the  Normans, newly settled in the north, had brought with them the vigour of  their race. They had taken up such dead or dying culture as they found  in France, and were carrying it further, so as in some degree to awaken  their neighbours. Kings and their great vassals could generally read and  write, and understand the Latin in which all records were made, but few  except the clergy studied at all. There were schools in convents, and  already at Paris a university was growing up for the study of theology,  grammar, law, philosophy, and music, the sciences which were held to  form a course of education. The doctors of these sciences lectured; the  scholars of low degree lived, begged, and struggled as best they could;  and gentlemen were lodged with clergy, who served as a sort of private  tutors.      4. Earlier Kings of the House of Paris.--Neither Hugh nor the next  three kings (_Robert_, 996-1031; _Henry_, 1031-1060; _Philip_,  1060-1108) were able men, and they were almost helpless among the  fierce nobles of their own domain, and the great counts and dukes around  them. Castles were built of huge strength, and served as nests of  plunderers, who preyed on travellers and made war on each other,  grievously tormenting one another's \"villeins\"--as the peasants were  termed. Men could travel nowhere in safety, and horrid ferocity and  misery prevailed. The first three kings were good and pious men, but too  weak to deal with their ruffian nobles. _Robert, called the Pious_, was  extremely devout, but weak. He became embroiled with the Pope on account  of having married Bertha--a lady pronounced to be within the degrees of  affinity prohibited by the Church. He was excommunicated, but held out  till there was a great religious reaction, produced by the belief that  the world would end in 1000. In this expectation many persons left their  land untilled, and the consequence was a terrible famine, followed by a  pestilence; and the misery of France was probably unequalled in this  reign, when it was hardly possible to pass safely from one to another of  the three royal cities, Paris, Orleans, and Tours. Beggars swarmed, and  the king gave to them everything he could lay his hands on, and even  winked at their stealing gold off his dress, to the great wrath of a  second wife, the imperious Constance of Provence, who, coming from the  more luxurious and corrupt south, hated and despised the roughness and  asceticism of her husband. She was a fierce and passionate woman, and  brought an element of cruelty into the court. In this reign the first  instance of persecution to the death for heresy took place. The victim  had been the queen's confessor; but so far was she from pitying him that  she struck out one of his eyes with her staff, as he was led past her to  the hut where he was shut in and burnt. On Robert's death Constance took  part against her son, _Henry I._, on behalf of his younger brother, but  Henry prevailed. During his reign the clergy succeeded in proclaiming  what was called the Truce of God, which forbade war and bloodshed at  certain seasons of the year and on certain days of the week, and made  churches and clerical lands places of refuge and sanctuary, which often  indeed protected the lawless, but which also saved the weak and  oppressed. It was during these reigns that the Papacy was beginning the  great struggle for temporal power, and freedom from the influence of the  Empire, which resulted in the increased independence and power of the  clergy. The religious fervour which had begun with the century led to  the foundation of many"]]]
