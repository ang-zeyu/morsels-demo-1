G. Keene            THE FALL OF THE MOGHUL EMPIRE OF HINDUSTAN,  A NEW EDITION,  WITH CORRECTIONS AND ADDITIONS.    1887          PREFACE.    Two editions of this book having been absorbed, it has been  thought that the time was come for its reproduction in a form  more adapted to the use of students. Opportunity has been taken  to introduce considerable additions and emendations.    The rise and meridian of the Moghul Empire have been related in  Elphinstone's \" History of India: the Hindu and Mahometan Period;  \" and a Special Study of the subject will Also be found in the \"  Sketch of the History of Hindustan\" published by the present  writer in 1885. Neither of those works, however, undertakes to  give a detailed account of the great Anarchy that marked the  conclusion of the eighteenth century, the dark time that came  before the dawn of British power in the land of the Moghul. Nor  is there is any other complete English book on the Subject.    The present work is, therefore, to be regarded as a monograph on  the condition of the capital and neighbouring territories, from  the murder of Alamgir II. in 1759 to the occupation of Dehli by  Lake in 1803. Some introductory chapters are prefixed, with the  view of showing how these events were prepared; and an account of  the campaign of 1760-1 has been added, because it does not seem  to have been hitherto related on a scale proportioned to its  importance. That short but desperate struggle is interesting as  the last episode of mediÂ¾val war, when battles could be decided  by the action of mounted men in armour. It is also the sine qua  non of British Empire in India. Had the Mahrattas not been  conquered then, it is exceedingly doubtful if the British power  in the Bengal Presidency would ever have extended beyond Benares.    The author would wish to conclude this brief explanation by  reproducing the remarks which concluded the Preface to his second  edition.    \"There were two dangers,\" it was there observed; \"the first, that  of giving too much importance to the period; the second, that of  attempting to illustrate it by stories Â— such as those of Clive  and Hastings Â— which had been told by writers with whom  competition was out of the question. Brevity, therefore, is  studied; and what may seem baldness will be found to be a  conciseness, on which much pains have been bestowed.\"    \"The narrative,\" it was added, \"is one of confusion and  transition; and chiefly interesting in so far as it throws light  on the circumstances which preceded and caused the accession of  the East India Company to paramount power in India.\" The author  has only to add an expression of his hope that, in conjunction  with Mr. S. Owen's book, what he has here written may help to  remove doubts as to the benefits derived by the people of India  from the Revolution under consideration.    Finally, mention should be made of Mr. Elphinstone's posthumous  work, \"The Rise of British Power in the East.\" That work does  not, indeed, clash with the present book; for it did not enter  into the scope of the distinguished author to give the native  side of the story, or to study it from the point of view here  presented. For the military and political aims and operations of  the early British officers in Madras and Bengal, however,  Elphinstone will be found a valuable guide. His narrative bears  to our subject a relation similar to that of the \"Roman de Rou\"  to the history of the Carling Empire of Northern France.    OXFORD, 1887.    CONTENTS.    PART I.
