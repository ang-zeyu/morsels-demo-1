THE MINNESOTA HORTICULTURIST    Vol. 44 JANUARY, 1916 No. 1          President's Greeting, Annual Meeting, 1915.    THOS. E. CASHMAN, PRESIDENT.      This is the forty-ninth annual meeting of the Minnesota State  Horticultural Society. Nearly half a century has elapsed since that  little band of pioneers met in Rochester and organized that they might  work out a problem that had proven too difficult for any of them to  handle single handed and alone. Those men were all anxious to raise at  least sufficient fruit for themselves and families. They had tried and  failed. They were not willing to give up. They knew they could  accomplish more by interchanging ideas, and, furthermore, if they were  able to learn anything by experience they wanted to pass it on to their  neighbors.    Those men built better than they knew. The foundation was properly laid,  and the structure, while not finished, is an imposing one. A great many  people believe that this structure has been completed, that we have  reached our possibilities in fruit raising. This is only half true. We  are still building on this splendid foundation erected by those few  enthusiasts.    None of those men are left to enjoy the benefits of their labor. The  present generation and the generations to come are and will be the  beneficiaries, and I believe as a tribute to their memory and the good  that they have done that we should fittingly celebrate our fiftieth  anniversary. At this time I can not suggest how this should be done; I  simply make this suggestion in hopes that it may be worked out.    I was in hopes that a home for this society might have been erected this  year or at least made ready for the 1916 meeting. This would surely have  been an occasion worthy of the anniversary which we hope to celebrate.    The building committee appointed by the last meeting went before the  legislature and tried with all the eloquence at their command to make  the members of the legislature see the necessity of appropriating  sufficient money to build a permanent home for this organization. The  members saw the force of our argument, but we could not convince a  majority of the appropriation committee that they should deviate from  their plan of retrenchment which seemed to permeate their every act.    We were disappointed but not disheartened. We were promised better  success in the 1917 session. So we are living in hopes, and I firmly  believe that if our efforts are renewed at that time that this and the  auxiliary societies may have an opportunity of meeting and transacting  business in a home that, while it will belong to the state, will be for  the use of these organizations, and that we may be able to take up our  abode in it not later than the winter meeting of 1917.    Secretary Latham has prepared an excellent program for you. Many friends  of this society are with us again, full of enthusiasm and vigor, and I  know that we will have one of the most successful meetings ever enjoyed  by this organization.    Owing to the fullness of the program, I should consider it an imposition  on my part if I should attempt to make an extended address at this time  and will hasten to call on the gentlemen who are to contribute to the  success of this meeting.    [Illustration: New varieties of strawberries originated at the Minnesota  State Fruit-Breeding Farm.]          Annual Meeting, 1915, Minnesota State Horticultural Society.    A. W. LATHAM, SECRETARY.      Did you attend the 1915 meeting of this association, held in the West  Hotel, Minneapolis, four days, December 7-10 inclusive? Of course as a  member of the society you will get in cold print the substance of the  papers and discussions that were presented at this meeting, but you will  fail altogether in getting the wonderful inspiration that comes from  contact with hundreds of persons deeply interested in the various phases  of horticultural problems that are constantly passing in review during  the succeeding sessions of the meeting. With such a varied program there  is hardly any problem connected with horticulture that is not directly  or indirectly touched upon at our annual gathering, and the present  meeting was no exception to this. In all there were sixty-nine persons  on the program, and with the exception of Prof. Whitten, whom we  expected with us from the Missouri State University, and whom sickness  kept at home, and one other number, every person on the program was on  hand to perform the part assigned to him. Isn't this really a wonderful  thing where so many are concerned, emphasizing as it does the large  interest felt in the work of the society?    The meeting was held in the same room in the West Hotel which was used  for the banquet two years ago. It seats comfortably 250, and was  approximately filled at all of the sessions of the meeting. At the first  session there were in attendance about 200 when the meeting opened at  ten o'clock Tuesday morning. Later in the morning the seats were  practically all filled. Making allowance for the change in the personnel  of those in attendance at the various meetings, it is easily within the  limit to say that between 400 and 500 were in attendance at these  meetings.    Immediately adjoining the audience room on the same floor, and opening  out of the spacious balcony, were the various rooms occupied by the  fruit exhibit and the vegetable exhibit. The plant exhibit was in two  alcoves on this balcony, and the cut flowers were displayed along either  side of the balcony, making altogether a wonderful showing of nature's  floral products. The accommodations for this meeting were almost ideal,  and judging from the expressions of the members we have never been more  happily situated than on this occasion. I have endeavored to draw a  plan of the arrangements at this meeting and submit it to you, not for  criticism, but to assist you in understanding the situation.    We were greatly disappointed that Prof. Whitten was detained at home by  illness, but others from abroad took up the time so that there was  really no interim as a result of his absence. We were fortunate in  having with us the last day and a part of Thursday afternoon Sen. H.M.  Dunlap and Mrs. Dunlap, and their parts on the program were listened to  with intense interest, and I am sure much good was gained for our  membership from the service they rendered the society, which it must be  understood is a gratuitious one--indeed that applies to all of those  whose names appear upon the program. That is one good thing about the  horticulturist, he is willing to tell what he knows for the benefit of  others. To hold any other view than this would be too narrow and selfish  certainly for the true lover of horticulture.    The exhibits were in every case in excess of what we anticipated.  Notwithstanding the light crop of apples in the larger portion of the  state, there was really a fine showing, and quality was very high. Of  boxes of apples there were shown eleven, and of barrels of apples six,  for each one of which exhibits some premium was paid, as besides the  first, second and third premiums in each case there was also a sum to be  divided pro rata. There were twenty-nine pecks of apples exhibited, for  which premiums were also paid in the same way. Four collections of  top-worked apples were on the list. Premiums were awarded to forty  seedling apples, an exceedingly good showing for the season. As to the  number of single plates shown the record is not easily available, but  the accompanying list of awards will give information as far as they are  concerned, there being of course many plates to which no awards were  made.    The vegetable exhibit was an extraordinarily fine one and filled  comfortably the convenient room assigned for its use. It was excellently  managed by Mr. N.H. Reeves, President of the Minneapolis Market  Gardeners' Association.    As to the flower exhibit under the fine management of W.H. Bofferding,  it was so much better than we anticipated that it is hard to find words  suitably to express our thought in regard to it. Besides the splendid  collections of plants and the large display of cut flowers from the  state, there was shown from several eastern parties rare flowers, many  of them new productions, which had a great deal to do with the  beautiful appearance of the balcony, where all of these flowers were  shown.

BY H. W. HENSHAW.          INTRODUCTORY.      The considerable degree of decorative and artistic skill attained by the  so-called Mound-Builders, as evidenced by many of the relics that have  been exhumed from the mounds, has not failed to arrest the attention of  archaeologists. Among them, indeed, are found not a few who assert for  the people conveniently designated as above a degree of artistic skill  very far superior to that attained by the present race of Indians as  they have been known to history. In fact, this very skill in artistic  design, asserted for the Mound-Builders, as indicated by the sculptures  they have left, forms an important link in the chain of argument upon  which is based the theory of their difference from and superiority to  the North American Indian.    Eminent as is much of the authority which thus contends for an artistic  ability on the part of the Mound-Builders far in advance of the  attainments of the present Indian in the same line, the question is one  admitting of argument; and if some of the best products of artistic  handicraft of the present Indians be compared with objects of a similar  nature taken from the mounds, it is more than doubtful if the artistic  inferiority of the latter-day Indian can be substantiated. Deferring,  however, for the present, any comparison between the artistic ability of  the Mound-Builder and the modern Indian, attention may be turned to a  class of objects from the mounds, notable, indeed, for the skill with  which they are wrought, but to be considered first in another way and  for another purpose than mere artistic comparison.    As the term Mound-Builders will recur many times throughout this paper,  and as the phrase has been objected to by some archaeologists on account  of its indefiniteness, it may be well to state that it is employed here  with its commonly accepted signification, viz: as applied to the people  who formerly lived throughout the Mississippi Valley and raised the  mounds of that region. It should also be clearly understood that by its  use the writer is not to be considered as committing himself in any way  to the theory that the Mound-Builders were of a different race from the  North American Indian.    Among the more interesting objects left by the Mound-Builders, pipes  occupy a prominent place. This is partly due to their number, pipes  being among the more common articles unearthed by the labors of  explorers, but more to the fact that in the construction of their pipes  this people exhibited their greatest skill in the way of sculpture. In  the minds of those who hold that the Mound-Builders were the ancestors  of the present Indians, or, at least, that they were not necessarily of  a different race, the superiority of their pipe sculpture over their  other works of art excites no surprise, since, however prominent a place  the pipe may have held in the affections of the Mound-Builders, it is  certain that it has been an object of no less esteem and reverence among  the Indians of history. Certainly no one institution, for so it may be  called, was more firmly fixed by long usage among the North American  Indians, or more characteristic of them, than the pipe, with all its  varied uses and significance.    Perhaps the most characteristic artistic feature displayed in the pipe  sculpture of the Mound-Builders, as has been well pointed out by Wilson,  in his Prehistoric Man, is the tendency exhibited toward the imitation  of natural objects, especially birds and animals, a remark, it may be  said in passing, which applies with almost equal truth to the art  productions generally of the present Indians throughout the length and  breadth of North America. As some of these sculptured animals from the  mounds have excited much interest in the minds of archaeologists, and  have been made the basis of much speculation, their examination and  proper identification becomes a matter of considerable importance. It  will therefore be the main purpose of the present paper to examine  critically the evidence offered in behalf of the identification of the  more important of them. If it shall prove, as is believed to be the  case, that serious mistakes of identification have been made, attention  will be called to these and the manner pointed out in which certain  theories have naturally enough resulted from the premises thus  erroneously established.    It may be premised that the writer undertook the examination of the  carvings with no theories of his own to propose in place of those  hitherto advanced. In fact, their critical examination may almost be  said to have been the result of accident. Having made the birds of the  United States his study for several years, the writer glanced over the  bird carvings in the most cursory manner, being curious to see what  species were represented. The inaccurate identification of some of these  by the authors of \"The Ancient Monuments of the Mississippi Valley\" led  to the examination of the series as a whole, and subsequently to the  discussion they had received at the hands of various authors. The  carvings are, therefore, here considered rather from the stand-point of  the naturalist than the archaeologist. Believing that the question first  in importance concerns their actual resemblances, substantially the same  kind of critical study is applied to them which they would receive were  they from the hands of a modern zoological artist. Such a course has  obvious disadvantages, since it places the work of men who were in, at  best, but a semi-civilized condition on a much higher plane than other  facts would seem to justify. It may be urged, as the writer indeed  believes, that the accuracy sufficient for the specific identification  of these carvings is not to be expected of men in the state of culture  the Mound-Builders are generally supposed to have attained. To which  answer may be made that it is precisely on the supposition that the  carvings were accurate copies from nature that the theories respecting  them have been promulgated by archaeologists. On no other supposition  could such theories have been advanced. So accurate indeed have they  been deemed that they have been directly compared with the work of  modern artists, as will be noticed hereafter. Hence the method here  adopted in their study seems to be not only the best, but the only one  likely to produce definite results.    If it be found that there are good reasons for pronouncing the carvings  not to be accurate copies from nature, and of a lower artistic standard  than has been supposed, it will remain for the archaeologist to determine  how far their unlikeness to the animals they have been supposed to"]]]
