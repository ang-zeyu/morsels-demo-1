She used to lose her kittens continually, and  whenever they were lost they were always in mischief!    On baking day she determined to shut them up in a cupboard.    She caught Moppet and Mittens, but she could not find Tom.    Mrs. Tabitha went up and down all over the house, mewing for Tom  Kitten. She looked in the pantry under the staircase, and she searched  the best spare bedroom that was all covered up with dust sheets. She  went right upstairs and looked into the attics, but she could not find  him anywhere.    It was an old, old house, full of cupboards and passages. Some of the  walls were four feet thick, and there used to be queer noises inside  them, as if there might be a little secret staircase. Certainly there  were odd little jagged doorways in the wainscot, and things disappeared  at night--especially cheese and bacon.    Mrs. Tabitha became more and more distracted, and mewed dreadfully.    [Illustration]    [Illustration]    While their mother was searching the house, Moppet and Mittens had got  into mischief.    The cupboard door was not locked, so they pushed it open and came out.    [Illustration]    They went straight to the dough which was set to rise in a pan before  the fire.    They patted it with their little soft paws--\"Shall we make dear little  muffins?\" said Mittens to Moppet.    [Illustration]    But just at that moment somebody knocked at the front door, and Moppet  jumped into the flour barrel in a fright.    [Illustration]    Mittens ran away to the dairy, and hid in an empty jar on the stone  shelf where the milk pans stand.    The visitor was a neighbour, Mrs. Ribby; she had called to borrow some  yeast.    Mrs. Tabitha came downstairs mewing dreadfully--\"Come in, Cousin Ribby,  come in, and sit ye down! I'm in sad trouble, Cousin Ribby,\" said  Tabitha, shedding tears. \"I've lost my dear son Thomas; I'm afraid the  rats have got him.\" She wiped her eyes with her apron.    \"He's a bad kitten, Cousin Tabitha; he made a cat's cradle of my best  bonnet last time I came to tea. Where have you looked for him?\"    \"All over the house! The rats are too many for me. What a thing it is to  have an unruly family!\" said Mrs. Tabitha Twitchit.    [Illustration]    [Illustration]    \"I'm not afraid of rats; I will help you to find him; and whip him too!  What is all that soot in the fender?\"    [Illustration]    \"The chimney wants sweeping--Oh, dear me, Cousin Ribby--now Moppet and  Mittens are gone!\"    \"They have both got out of the cupboard!\"    [Illustration]    Ribby and Tabitha set to work to search the house thoroughly again.  They poked under the beds with Ribby's umbrella, and they rummaged in  cupboards. They even fetched a candle, and looked inside a clothes chest  in one of the attics. They could not find anything, but once they heard  a door bang and somebody scuttered downstairs.    \"Yes, it is infested with rats,\" said Tabitha tearfully. \"I caught seven  young ones out of one hole in the back kitchen, and we had them for  dinner last Saturday. And once I saw the old father rat--an enormous old  rat, Cousin Ribby. I was just going to jump upon him, when he showed his  yellow teeth at me and whisked down the hole.\"    \"The rats get upon my nerves, Cousin Ribby,\" said Tabitha.    [Illustration]    Ribby and Tabitha searched and searched. They both heard a curious  roly-poly noise under the attic floor. But there was nothing to be seen.    [Illustration]    They returned to the kitchen. \"Here's one of your kittens at least,\"  said Ribby, dragging Moppet out of the flour barrel.    They shook the flour off her and set her down on the kitchen floor. She  seemed to be in a terrible fright.    \"Oh! Mother, Mother,\" said Moppet, \"there's been an old woman rat in the  kitchen, and she's stolen some of the dough!\"    The two cats ran to look at the dough pan. Sure enough there were marks  of little scratching fingers, and a lump of dough was gone!    \"Which way did she go, Moppet?\"    But Moppet had been too much frightened to peep out of the barrel again.    Ribby and Tabitha took her with them to keep her safely in sight, while  they went on with their search.    [Illustration]    [Illustration]    They went into the dairy. The first thing they found was Mittens, hiding  in an empty jar.    [Illustration]    They tipped up the jar, and she scrambled out.    \"Oh, Mother, Mother!\" said Mittens--    [Illustration]    \"Oh! Mother, Mother, there has been an old man rat in the dairy--a  dreadful 'normous big rat, mother; and he's stolen a pat of butter and  the rolling-pin.\"    Ribby and Tabitha looked at one another.    \"A rolling-pin and butter! Oh, my poor son Thomas!\" exclaimed Tabitha,  wringing her paws.    \"A rolling-pin?\" said Ribby. \"Did we not hear a roly-poly noise in the  attic when we were looking into that chest?\"    Ribby and Tabitha rushed upstairs again. Sure enough the roly-poly noise  was still going on quite distinctly under the attic floor.    [Illustration]    \"This is serious, Cousin Tabitha,\" said Ribby. \"We must send for John  Joiner at once, with a saw.\"           *       *       *       *       *    [Illustration]    Now this is what had been happening to Tom Kitten, and it shows how very  unwise it is to go up a chimney in a very old house, where a person does  not know his way, and where there are enormous rats.    Tom Kitten did not want to be shut up in a cupboard. When he saw that  his mother was going to bake, he determined to hide.    He looked about for a nice convenient place, and he fixed upon the  chimney.    The fire had only just been lighted, and it was not hot; but there was a  white choky smoke from the green sticks. Tom Kitten got upon the fender  and looked up. It was a big old-fashioned fire-place.    The chimney itself was wide enough inside for a man to stand up and walk  about. So there was plenty of room for a little Tom Cat.    [Illustration]    [Illustration]    He jumped right up into the fire-place, balancing himself upon the iron  bar where the kettle hangs.    [Illustration]    Tom Kitten took another big jump off the bar, and landed on a ledge high  up inside the chimney, knocking down some soot into the fender.    [Illustration]    Tom Kitten coughed and choked with the smoke; and he could hear the  sticks beginning to crackle and burn in the fire-place down below. He  made up his mind to climb right to the top, and get out on the slates,  and try to catch sparrows.    \"I cannot go back. If I slipped I might fall in the fire and singe my  beautiful tail and my little blue jacket.\"    The chimney was a very big old-fashioned one. It was built in the days  when people burnt logs of wood upon the hearth.    The chimney stack stood up above the roof like a little stone tower, and  the daylight shone down from the top, under the slanting slates that  kept out the rain.    [Illustration]    Tom Kitten was getting very frightened! He climbed up, and up, and up.    [Illustration]    Then he waded sideways through inches of soot. He was like a little  sweep himself.    It was most confusing in the dark. One flue seemed to lead into  another.    There was less smoke, but Tom Kitten felt quite lost.    He scrambled up and up; but before he reached the chimney top he came to  a place where somebody had loosened a stone in the wall. There were some  mutton bones lying about--    \"This seems funny,\" said Tom Kitten. \"Who has been gnawing bones up here  in the chimney? I wish I had never come! And what a funny smell? It is  something like mouse; only dreadfully strong. It makes me sneeze,\" said  Tom Kitten.    [Illustration]    [Illustration]    He squeezed through the hole in the wall, and dragged himself along a  most uncomfortably tight passage where there was scarcely any light.    [Illustration]    He groped his way carefully for several yards; he was at the back of the  skirting-board in the attic, where there is a little mark * in the  picture.    [Illustration]    All at once he fell head over heels in the dark, down a hole, and  landed on a heap of very dirty rags.    When Tom Kitten picked himself up and looked about him--he found himself  in a place that he had never seen before, although he had lived all his  life in the house.    It was a very small stuffy fusty room, with boards, and rafters, and  cobwebs, and lath and plaster.    Opposite to him--as far away as he could sit--was an enormous rat.    \"What do you mean by tumbling into my bed all covered with smuts?\" said  the rat, chattering his teeth.    [Illustration]    \"Please sir, the chimney wants sweeping,\" said poor Tom Kitten.    [Illustration]    \"Anna Maria! Anna Maria!\" squeaked the rat. There was a pattering noise  and an old woman rat poked her head round a rafter.    All in a minute she rushed upon Tom Kitten, and before he knew what was  happening--    His coat was pulled off, and he was rolled up in a bundle, and tied with  string in very hard knots.    Anna Maria did the tying. The old rat watched her and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15580"],[0,"The Rustlers of Pecos County (#1)"],[1,"Meehan, and the Project Gutenberg Online Distributed Proofreading Team                                        THE RUSTLERS OF PECOS COUNTY                                  By Zane Grey                                      1914          Chapter 1    VAUGHN STEELE AND RUSS SITTELL      In the morning, after breakfasting early, I took a turn up and down the  main street of Sanderson, made observations and got information likely  to serve me at some future day, and then I returned to the hotel ready  for what might happen.    The stage-coach was there and already full of passengers. This stage did  not go to Linrock, but I had found that another one left for that point  three days a week.    Several cowboy broncos stood hitched to a railing and a little farther  down were two buckboards, with horses that took my eye. These probably  were the teams Colonel Sampson had spoken of to George Wright.    As I strolled up, both men came out of the hotel. Wright saw me, and  making an almost imperceptible sign to Sampson, he walked toward me.    \"You're the cowboy Russ?\" he asked.    I nodded and looked him over. By day he made as striking a figure as I  had noted by night, but the light was not generous to his dark face.    \"Here's your pay,\" he said, handing me some bills. \"Miss Sampson won't  need you out at the ranch any more.\"    \"What do you mean? This is the first I've heard about that.\"    \"Sorry, kid. That's it,\" he said abruptly. \"She just gave me the  money--told me to pay you off. You needn't bother to speak with her  about it.\"    He might as well have said, just as politely, that my seeing her, even  to say good-by, was undesirable.    As my luck would have it, the girls appeared at the moment, and I went  directly up to them, to be greeted in a manner I was glad George Wright  could not help but see.    In Miss Sampson's smile and \"Good morning, Russ,\" there was not the  slightest discoverable sign that I was not to serve her indefinitely.    It was as I had expected--she knew nothing of Wright's discharging me in  her name.    \"Miss Sampson,\" I said, in dismay, \"what have I done? Why did you let me  go?\"    She looked astonished.    \"Russ, I don't understand you.\"    \"Why did you discharge me?\" I went on, trying to look heart-broken. \"I  haven't had a chance yet. I wanted so much to work for you--Miss Sally,  what have I done? Why did she discharge me?\"    \"I did not,\" declared Miss Sampson, her dark eyes lighting.    \"But look here--here's my pay,\" I went on, exhibiting the money. \"Mr.  Wright just came to me--said you sent this money--that you wouldn't need  me out at the ranch.\"    It was Miss Sally then who uttered a little exclamation. Miss Sampson  seemed scarcely to have believed what she had heard.    \"My cousin Mr. Wright said that?\"    I nodded vehemently.    At this juncture Wright strode before me, practically thrusting me  aside.    \"Come girls, let's walk a little before we start,\" he said gaily. \"I'll  show you Sanderson.\"    \"Wait, please,\" Miss Sampson replied, looking directly at him. \"Cousin  George, I think there's a mistake--perhaps a misunderstanding. Here's  the cowboy I've engaged--Mr. Russ. He declares you gave him money--told  him I discharged him.\"    \"Yes, cousin, I did,\" he replied, his voice rising a little. There was  a tinge of red in his cheek. \"We--you don't need him out at the ranch.  We've any numbers of boys. I just told him that--let him down  easy--didn't want to bother you.\"    Certain it was that George Wright had made a poor reckoning. First she  showed utter amaze, then distinct disappointment, and then she lifted  her head with a kind of haughty grace. She would have addressed him  then, had not Colonel Sampson come up.    \"Papa, did you instruct Cousin George to discharge Russ?\" she asked.    \"I sure didn't,\" declared the colonel, with a laugh. \"George took that  upon his own hands.\"    \"Indeed! I'd like my cousin to understand that I'm my own mistress. I've  been accustomed to attending to my own affairs and shall continue doing  so. Russ, I'm sorry you've been treated this way. Please, in future,  take your orders from me.\"    \"Then I'm to go to Linrock with you?\" I asked.    \"Assuredly. Ride with Sally and me to-day, please.\"    She turned away with Sally, and they walked toward the first buckboard.    Colonel Sampson found a grim enjoyment in Wright's discomfiture.    \"Diane's like her mother was, George,\" he said. \"You've made a bad start  with her.\"    Here Wright showed manifestation of the Sampson temper, and I took him  to be a dangerous man, with unbridled passions.    \"Russ, here's my own talk to you,\" he said, hard and dark, leaning  toward me. \"Don't go to Linrock.\"    \"Say, Mr. Wright,\" I blustered for all the world like a young and  frightened cowboy, \"If you threaten me I'll have you put in jail!\"    Both men seemed to have received a slight shock. Wright hardly knew what  to make of my boyish speech. \"Are you going to Linrock?\" he asked  thickly.    I eyed him with an entirely different glance from my other fearful one.    \"I should smile,\" was my reply, as caustic as the most reckless  cowboy's, and I saw him shake.    Colonel Sampson laid a restraining hand upon Wright. Then they both  regarded me with undisguised interest. I sauntered away.    \"George, your temper'll do for you some day,\" I heard the colonel say.  \"You'll get in bad with the wrong man some time. Hello, here are Joe and  Brick!\"    Mention of these fellows engaged my attention once more.    I saw two cowboys, one evidently getting his name from his brick-red  hair. They were the roistering type, hard drinkers, devil-may-care  fellows, packing guns and wearing bold fronts--a kind that the Rangers  always called four-flushes.    However, as the Rangers' standard of nerve was high, there was room left  for cowboys like these to be dangerous to ordinary men.    The little one was Joe, and directly Wright spoke to him he turned to  look at me, and his thin mouth slanted down as he looked. Brick eyed me,  too, and I saw that he was heavy, not a hard-riding cowboy.    Here right at the start were three enemies for me--Wright and his  cowboys. But it did not matter; under any circumstances there would have  been friction between such men and me.    I believed there might have been friction right then had not Miss  Sampson called for me.    \"Get our baggage, Russ,\" she said.    I hurried to comply, and when I had fetched it out Wright and the  cowboys had mounted their horses, Colonel Sampson was in the one  buckboard with two men I had not before observed, and the girls were  in the other.    The driver of this one was a tall, lanky, tow-headed youth, growing like  a Texas weed. We had not any too much room in the buckboard, but that  fact was not going to spoil the ride for me.    We followed the leaders through the main street, out into the open,  on to a wide, hard-packed road, showing years of travel. It headed  northwest.    To our left rose the range of low, bleak mountains I had noted  yesterday, and to our right sloped the mesquite-patched sweep of ridge  and flat.    The driver pushed his team to a fast trot, which gait surely covered  ground rapidly. We were close behind Colonel Sampson, who, from his  vehement gestures, must have been engaged in very earnest colloquy with  his companions.    The girls behind me, now that they were nearing the end of the journey,  manifested less interest in the ride, and were speculating upon Linrock,  and what it would be like. Occasionally I asked the driver a question,  and sometimes the girls did likewise; but, to my disappointment, the  ride seemed not to be the same as that of yesterday.    Every half mile or so we passed a ranch house, and as we traveled on  these ranches grew further apart, until, twelve or fifteen miles out of  Sanderson, they were so widely separated that each appeared alone on the  wild range.    We came to a stream that ran north and I was surprised to see a goodly  volume of water. It evidently flowed down from the mountain far to the  west.    Tufts of grass were well scattered over the sandy ground, but it was  high and thick, and considering the immense area in sight, there was  grazing for a million head of stock.    We made three stops in the forenoon, one at a likely place to water the  horses, the second at a chuckwagon belonging to cowboys who were riding  after stock, and the third at a small cluster of adobe and stone houses,  constituting a hamlet the driver called Sampson, named after the  Colonel. From that point on to Linrock there were only a few ranches,  each one controlling great acreage.    Early in the afternoon from a ridgetop we sighted Linrock, a green path  in the mass of gray. For the barrens of Texas it was indeed a fair  sight.    But I was more concerned with its remoteness from civilization than its  beauty. At that time in the early 'seventies, when the vast western  third of Texas was a wilderness, the pioneer had done wonders to settle  there and establish places like Linrock.    As we rolled swiftly along, the whole sweeping range was dotted with  cattle, and farther on, within a few miles of town, there were droves  of horses that brought enthusiastic praise from Miss Sampson and her  cousin.    \"Plenty of room here for the long rides,\" I said, waving a hand at the  gray-green expanse. \"Your horses won't suffer on this range.\"    She was delighted, and her cousin for once seemed speechless.    \"That's the ranch,\" said the driver, pointing with his whip.    It needed only a glance for me to see that Colonel Sampson's ranch was  on a scale fitting the country.    The house was situated on the only elevation around Linrock, and it was  not high, nor more than a few minutes' walk from the edge of town.    It was a low, flat-roofed structure, made of red adobe bricks and  covered what appeared to be fully an acre of ground. All was green about  it except where the fenced"]]]
