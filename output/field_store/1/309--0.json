AUTHOR'S DEDICATION    MY DEAR SISTER,    Were any one to ask your countrymen in India what has been their  greatest source of pleasure while there, perhaps nine in ten would  say, the letters which they receive from their sisters at home.  These, of all things, perhaps, tend most to link our affections with  home by filling the landscapes, so dear to our recollections, with  ever varying groups of the family circles, among whom our infancy and  our boyhood have been passed; and among whom we still hope to spend  the winter of our days.    They have a very happy facility in making us familiar with the new  additions made from time to time to the _dramatis personae_ of these  scenes after we quit them, in the character of husbands, wives,  children, or friends; and, while thus contributing so much to our  happiness, they no doubt tend to make us better citizens of the  world, and servants of government, than we should otherwise be, for,  in our 'struggles through life in India', we have all, more or less,  an eye to the approbation of those circles which our kind sisters  represent--who may, therefore, be considered in the exalted light of  a valuable species of _unpaid magistracy_ to the Government of India.    No brother has ever had a kinder or better correspondent than I have  had in you, my dear sister; and it was the consciousness of having  left many of your valued letters unanswered, in the press of official  duties, that made me first think of devoting a part of my leisure to  you in these _Rambles and Recollections_, while on my way from the  banks of the Nerbudda river to the Himalaya mountains, in search of  health, in the end of 1835 and beginning of 1836. To what I wrote  during that journey I have now added a few notes, observations, and  conversations with natives, on the subjects which my narrative seemed  to embrace; and the whole will, I hope, interest and amuse you and  the other members of our family; and appear, perchance, not  altogether uninteresting or uninstructive to those who are strangers  to us both.    Of one thing I must beg you to be assured, that I have nowhere  indulged in fiction, either in the narrative, the recollections, or  the conversations. What I relate on the testimony of others I believe  to be true; and what I relate upon my own you may rely upon as being  so. Had I chosen to write a work of fiction, I might possibly have  made it a good deal more interesting; but I question whether it would  have been so much valued by you, or so useful to others; and these  are the objects I have had in view. The work may, perhaps, tend to  make the people of India better understood by those of my own  countrymen whose destinies are cast among them, and inspire more  kindly feelings towards them. Those parts which, to the general  reader, will seem dry and tedious, may be considered, by the Indian  statesman, as the most useful and important.    The opportunities of observation, which varied employment has given  me, have been such as fall to the lot of few; but, although I have  endeavoured to make the most of them, the time of public servants is  not their own; and that of few men has been more exclusively devoted  to the service of their masters than mine. It may be, however, that  the world, or that part of it which ventures to read these pages,  will think that it had been better had I not been left even the  little leisure that has been devoted to them.    Your ever affectionate brother,     W. H. SLEEMAN.

CORNER HOUSE PUBLISHERS    WILLIAMSTOWN, MASSACHUSETTS        _First Printed in 1922_    _Reprinted in 1968_    _by_    CORNER HOUSE PUBLISHERS        PRINTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA          PREFACE      This book is an attempt to portray by means of the writings of colonial  days the life of the women of that period,--how they lived, what their  work and their play, what and how they thought and felt, their strength  and their weakness, the joys and the sorrows of their everyday  existence. Through such an attempt perhaps we can more nearly understand  how and why the American woman is what she is to-day.    For a long time to come, one of the principal reasons for the study of  the writings of America will lie, not in their intrinsic merit alone,  but in their revelations of American life, ideals, aspirations, and  social and intellectual endeavors. We Americans need what Professor  Shorey has called \"the controlling consciousness of tradition.\" We have  not sufficiently regarded the bond that connects our present  institutions with their origins in the days of our forefathers. That is  one of the main purposes of this study, and the author believes that  through contributions of such a character he can render the national  intellectual spirit at least as valuable a service as he could through a  study of some legend of ancient Britain or some epic of an extinct race.  As Mr. Percy Boynton has said, \"To foster in a whole generation some  clear recognition of other qualities in America than its bigness, and of  other distinctions between the past and the present than that they are  far apart is to contribute towards the consciousness of a national  individuality which is the first essential of national life.... We  must put our minds upon ourselves, we must look to our past and to our  present, and then intelligently to our future.\"    The author has endeavored to follow such advice by bringing forward  those qualities of colonial womanhood which have made for the  refinement, the intellectuality, the spirit, the aggressiveness, and  withal the genuine womanliness of the present-day American woman. As the  book is not intended for scholars alone, the author has felt free when  he had not original source material before him to quote now and then  from the studies of writers on other phases of colonial life--such as  the valuable books by Dr. Philip Alexander Bruce, Dr. John Bassett, Dr.  George Sydney Fisher, Charles C. Coffin, Alice Brown, Alice Morse Earle,  Anna Hollingsworth Wharton, and Geraldine Brooks.    The author believes that many misconceptions have crept into the mind of  the average reader concerning the life of colonial women--ideas, for  instance, of unending long-faced gloom, constant fear of pleasure,  repression of all normal emotions. It is hoped that this book will go  far toward clearing the mind of the reader of such misconceptions, by  showing that woman in colonial days knew love and passion, felt longing  and aspiration, used the heart and the brain, very much as does her  descendant of to-day.    For permission to quote from the works mentioned hereafter, the author  wishes to express his gratitude to Sydney G. Fisher and the J.B.  Lippincott Company (_Men, Women and Manners in Colonial Days_), Ralph L.  Bartlett, executor for Charles C. Coffin, (_Old Times in Colonial  Days_), Alice Brown and Charles Scribner's Sons (_Mercy Warren_), Philip  Alexander Bruce and the Macmillan Company (_Institutional History of  Virginia in the Seventeenth Century_), Anne H. Wharton (_Martha  Washington_), John Spencer Bassett (_Writings of Colonel Byrd_), Alice  Earle Hyde (_Alice Morse Earl's Child Life in Colonial Days_), Geraldine  Brooks and Thomas Y. Crowell Company (_Dames and Daughters of Colonial  Days_). The author wishes to acknowledge his deep indebtedness to the  late Sylvia Brady Holliday, whose untiring investigations of the subject  while a student under him contributed much to this book.
