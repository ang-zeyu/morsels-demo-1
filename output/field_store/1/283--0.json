A QUEENS DELIGHT OF Conserves, and Preserves, Candying and Distilling  Waters.        _To preserve white Pear Plums, or green._      Take the Plums, and cut the stalk off, and wipe them then take the just  weight of them in Sugar, then put them in a skillet of water, and let  them stand in and scald, being close covered till they be tender, they  must not seeth, when they be soft lay them in a Dish, and cover them  with a cloth, and stew some of the the Sugar in the glass bottom, and  put in the Plums, strewing the sugar over till all be in, then let them  stand all night, the next day put them in a pan, and let them boil a  pace, keeping them clean scummed, & when your Plums look clear, your  syrup will gelly, and they are enough. If your Plums be ripe, peel off  the skins before you put them in the glass; they will be the better and  clearer a great deal to dry, if you will take the Plums white; if green,  do them with the rinds on.        _To preserve Grapes_    Take Grapes when they be almost through ripe, and cut the stalks off,  and stone them in the side, and as fast as you can stone them strew  Sugar on them; you must take to every pound of Grapes three quarters of  a pound of Sugar, then take some of the sower Grapes; and wring the  juyce of them, and put to every pound of Grapes two spoonfuls of juyce,  then set them on the fire, and still lift up the pan and shake it round,  for fear of burning to, then set them on again, & when the Sugar is  melted, boil them as fast as you can possible, and when they look very  clear, and the syrup is somewhat thick, they are enough.        _To preserve Quinces white._    Take a pair and coar them, and to every pound of your equal weights in  Sugar and Quince, take a wine pint of water; put them together, and boil  them as fast as you can uncovered; and this way you may also preserve  Pippins white as you do Quinces.        _To preserve Respass._    Take a pound of Respass, a pound of fine Sugar, a quarter of a pint of  the juyce of Respass, strew the Sugar under and above the Respass,  sprinkle the juyce all on them, set them on a clear fire, let them boil  as soft as is possible, till the syrup will gelly, then take them off,  let them stand till they be cold, then put them in a glass. After this  manner is the best way.        _To preserve Pippins._    Take fair Pippins, and boil them in fair water till they be somewhat  tender, then take them out, and peel off the skins and put them into a  fair earthen pot, and cover them till they be cold, then make the syrup  with fair water and Sugar, seeth it, and scum it very clean, then being  almost cold, put in your Pippins, so boil them softly together, put in  as much rind of Oranges as you think will tast them, if you have no  Oranges take whole Cinamon and Cloves, so boil them high enough to keep  them all the year.        _To preserve fruits green._    Take Pippins, Apricocks, Pear-Plums, or Peaches when they be green,  scald them in hot water, and peel them or scrape them, put them into  another water not so hot as the first, then boil them very tender, take  the weight of them in Sugar, put to it as much water as will make a  syrup to cover them; then boil them something leisurely, and take them  up, then boil the syrup till it be somewhat thick, that it will batten  on a dish side, and when they are cold, put them together.        _To preserve Oranges and Lemons the best way._    Take and boil them as for paste, then take as much sugar as they weigh,  and put to it as much water as will cover them by making a syrrup, then  boil them very leisurely till they be clear, then take them up and boil  the syrup till it batten on the dish side, and when they are cold put  them up, &c.        _An approved Conserve for a Cough or Consumption of the Lungs._    Take a pound of Elecampane Roots, draw out the pith, and boil them in  two waters till they be soft, when it is cold put to it the like  quantity of the pap of roasted Pippins, and three times their weight of  brown sugar-candy beaten to powder, stamp these in a Mortar to a  Conserve, whereof take every morning fasting as much as a Walnut for a  week or fortnight together, and afterwards but three times a week.  _Approved_.        _To make conserve of Any of these Fruits._    When you have boiled your paste as followeth ready to fashion on the  Pie-plate, put it up into Gallipots, and never dry it, and this is all  the difference between Conserves. And so you may make Conserves of any  Fruits, this is for all hard Fruits, as Quinces, Pippins, Oranges and  Lemons.        _To dry any Fruits after they are preserved, to or Candy them._    Take Pippins, Pears or Plums, and wash them out in warm water from the  syrup they are preserved in, strew them over with searsed Sugar, as you  would do flower upon fish to fry them; set them in a broad earthen Pan,  that they may lie one by one; then set them in a warm Oven or Stove to  dry. If you will candy them withall, you must strew on Sugar three or  four times in the drying.        _To preserve Artichokes young, green Walnuts and Lemons, and the  Elecampane-Roots, or any bitter thing._    Take any of these, and boil them tender, and shift them in their boyling  six or seven times to take away their bitterness out of one hot water  into another, then put a quart of Salt unto them, then take them up and  dry them with a fair cloth, then put them into as much clarified Sugar  as will cover them, then let them boil a walm or two, and so let them  stand soaking in the Sugar till the next morning, then take them up and  boil the Sugar a little higher by it self, and when they are cold put  them up.    Let your green Walnuts be prickt full of holes with a great pin, and let  them not be long in one water, for that will make them look black; being  boiled tender, stick two or three Cloves in each of them.    Set your Elecampane-Roots, being clean scraped, and shifted in their  boilings a dozen times, then dry them in a fair cloth, and so boil them  as is above written, take half so much more than it doth weigh, because  it is bitter, &c.        _To preserve Quinces white or red._    Take the Quinces, and coar them, and pare them, those that you will have  white, put them into a pail of water two or three hours, then take as  much Sugar as they weigh, put to it as much water as will make a Syrup  to cover them, then boil your Syrup a little while, then put your  Quinces in, and boil them as fast as you can, till they be tender and  clear, then take them up, and boil the Syrup a little higher by it self,  and being cold put them up. And if you will have them red, put them raw  into Sugar, and boil them leisurely close covered till they be red and  put them not into cold water.        _To preserve Grapes._    Take the Clusters, and stone them as you do Barberries, then take a  little more Sugar than they weigh, put to it as much Apple water as will  make a Syrup to cover them, then boil them as you do Cherries as fast as  you can, till the Syrup be thick and being cold pot it, thus may you  preserve Barberries or English Currans, or any kind of Berries.        _To preserve Pippins, Apricoks, Pear-Plums and Peaches when they are  ripe._    Take Pippins and pare them, bore a hole through them, & put them into a  Pail of water, then take as much Sugar as they do weigh, and put to it  as much water as will make a Syrup to cover them, and boil them as fast  as you can, so that you keep them from breaking, until they be tender,  that you may prick a Rush through them: let them be a soaking till they  be almost cold, then put them up.    Your Apricoks and Peaches must be stoned & pared, but the Pear-Plums  must not be stoned nor pared. Then take a little more Sugar than they  weigh, then take as much Apple water and Sugar as will make a Syrup for  them, then boil them as you do your Pippins, and Pot them as you do the  Pippins likewise, &c.        _To preserve Pippins, Apricocks, Pear-Plums, or Peaches green._    Take your Pippins green and quoddle them in fair water, but let the  water boil first before you put them in, & you must shift them in two  hot waters before they will be tender, then pull off the skin from them,  and so case them in so much clarified Sugar as will cover them, and so  boil them as fast as you can, keeping them from breaking, then take them  up, and boil the syrup until it be as thick as for Quiddony; then pot  them, and pour the syrup into them before they be cold.    Take your Apricocks and Pear-Plums and boil them tender, then take as  much Sugar as they do weigh, and take as much water as will make the  syrup, take your green Peaches before they be stoned and thrust a pin  through them, and then make a strong water of ashes, and cast them into  the hot standing lye to take off the fur from them, then wash them in  three or four waters warm, so then put them into so much clarified Sugar  as will candy them; so boil them, and put them up, &c.        _To dry Pippins, or Pears without Sugar._    Take Pippins or Pears and prick them full of holes with a bodkin, & lay  them in sweet wort three or four dayes, then lay them on a sieves  bottom, till they be dry in an Oven, but a drying heat. This you may do  to any tender Plum.        _To make Syrup of Clove-gilly flowers._    Take a quart of water, half a bushel of Flowers, cut off the whites, and  with a sieve sift away the seeds, bruise them a little; let your water  be boiled, and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15020"],[0,"The Brochure Series of Architectural Illustration, Vol. 01, No. 11, November, (#1)"],[1,"[Illustration: LXXXI. Ferme la Vallauine, Normandy.]          THE BROCHURE SERIES    OF ARCHITECTURAL ILLUSTRATION.    VOL. I.   NOVEMBER, 1895.   No. 11.          THE COUNTRY HOUSES OF NORMANDY.      The houses chosen for illustration in this number are of different  types, of different dates, built for men of different stations in  life, and are constructed of different materials. They are, however,  all in the province of Normandy, in northern France, and they are all  situated outside the towns; further than this it may not be well to go  in attempting to classify them under one head. Like the subjects  chosen for our last issue, they contain many suggestive ideas for  treatment of similar problems in our own country, and for this reason  they deserve special attention.    The tendency among the French has always been strong to build their  houses in compact groups, and detached buildings with free space on  all sides are the exception even in the country. Mr. Louis H. Gibson,  whose book \"Beautiful Houses\" we have noticed in another column, says  of the French domestic architecture:--    \"Excepting the chateaux, the structures of which we have the  completest record are almost entirely buildings fronting directly on  the street or road. In France it is rare indeed that one sees an  isolated building with a free passage around it, as is common in our  American towns and cities. It is not at all uncommon for a farm  building to be constructed within a wall; again, the farmer's house  may be almost flush with the road. Little farm communities, with the  buildings abutting on one another, are very common, because of the  companionship which such association brings. This was not alone true  in the early history of France, but obtains in the construction of  to-day. The small towns, as well as the cities, are almost universally  built very compactly. Thus we may expect to see very few examples of  isolated structures in France.\"    In this respect it will be seen the taste of the French house builder  differs from ours where open space about a dwelling-house is  considered one of its important attractions. Consequently the examples  here shown should not be considered as typical of French domestic  architecture. The town house is, if anything, the type.    Most of the examples which we have chosen belong to the sixteenth  century or thereabouts. The Manoir d'Ango, of which we gave four views  in last month's issue and of which three more are now shown, was built  about the middle of the sixteenth century, and the _manoir_ at  Archelles was also built about the same time. It was also during this  century that the best and most interesting of the French half-timber  work was done, and although we have no data at hand for determining  the matter, we judge that the two examples here illustrated date from  about this time. The construction in these buildings is doubtless the  same as that commonly used in others of this character--a strong  framework of timber filled in with brick masonry and then plastered.  Many of the town houses built in this way were very elaborate and were  adorned with exquisite carved wood ornament. In Verdier and Cattois'  \"Architecture Civile et Domestique\" may be found numerous examples,  and in a future number of THE BROCHURE SERIES we shall give place to  some of the most attractive.    [Illustration: LXXXII. Manoir at Archelles, Normandy.]    One consideration has influenced the selection of some of the subjects  included in the illustrations of this number which has not before been  mentioned, and it is not necessary to dwell upon it now. It has been  our experience that architectural students are constantly looking  about for appropriate subjects for sketching, and some are so  fastidious that they find very few satisfactory ones. We commend the  views here given, and also those in the last issue, as excellent and  appropriate subjects for treatment either in water-color, pen-and-ink,  or pencil. Next to working directly from nature, it would be hard to  find better practice than can be had by translating these photographic  views into drawings.    LXXXI.    FERME LA VALLAUINE, NORMANDY.    With the resources at our command we are unable to further identify  this house than the above title indicates. In fact, it tells its own  story. Judging by analogy, it probably dates from the sixteenth  century. Nothing could well be more picturesque.    LXXXII and LXXXIII.    MANOIR AT ARCHELLES, NORMANDY.    Archelles is a small village near Arques, and its principal attraction  is this beautiful _manoir_ with a garden at its back, and surrounded  by fine trees. It dates from the sixteenth century and is built of  brick decorated in a sort of mosaic inlaid with a light colored stone.  The old walls overgrown with vines are especially attractive.    LXXXIV.    PORCH OF CHURCH AT BEUVREIL, NORMANDY.    The form and proportions of this old porch are so good that in spite  of the rough and meagre detail it has an irresistible charm.    LXXXV.    MANOIR DE VITANVAL, STE. ANDRESSE, NORMANDY.    Ste. Andresse is a small community on the coast of Normandy a few  miles north-west of Havre.    LXXXVI to LXXXVIII.    MANOIR D'ANGO, NORMANDY.    This _manoir_ has already been referred to in the preceding number,  where four other views are given.          Architectural Schools.    COLUMBIA COLLEGE.      In the series of articles in which we have undertaken to give an idea  of the scope of the courses of architectural study offered by the  various schools of the country, we can hardly do better, in referring  to Columbia College, than quote from a paper in which Professor  William R. Ware describes the methods used for the teaching of the  history of architecture at Columbia. Our extracts are made from a  portion of the paper printed in _The American Architect_ for November  30, 1895.    These four exercises, the Lectures on History and Ornament, with the  study of English, French, and German text-books, the Historical  Research, the Historical Drawing, and the Historical Design, occupy a  chief part of the student's time during the first three years of the  course. At the end of the third year the stated instruction by  recitations and the lectures is virtually finished, the fourth year  being, by an arrangement which is perhaps a novelty in places of  learning, quite free from lectures or recitations. The men give their  whole time by day to problems in design, to what may be called  \"_atelier_ work,\" without interruption. Their evenings, throughout the  whole year, are devoted to historical study. As the college library,  including the Avery library, as well as the books and photographs  belonging to the Department of Architecture, is accessible every  evening until eleven o'clock, and the Metropolitan Museum is open  twice a week until ten, every facility is afforded for the prosecution  of this work. In order to make the most of these appliances, every  student of the Fourth-year class and all the special students (who are  of similar grade, being received only in advanced standing) prepares  once a month, under the name of Advanced Architectural History, an  original paper. This he illustrates by drawings and reads to the  class. All this affords an almost unexampled opportunity for serious  work.    We exhibit to the students the architecture of the past as a series of  problems just as it appeared to the builders of its own day, and we  hope thus not only to give them a clearer insight into the real spirit  and character of the masterpieces that have come down to us, by  bringing to view the ideas and considerations which really influenced  their designers, but at the same time to exercise our own young men in  the practical application of those same ideas. We hope thus to develop  in them the same good sense and good taste, the same readiness of  invention and happy ingenuity, to which these masterpieces are due.    [Illustration: LXXXIII. Manoir at Archelles, Normandy.]    The exercises themselves may be described as a species of design by  description or by dictation. The attempt is made, by indicating the  conditions under which a given piece of work was executed, to present  to the student the same problem that the workman of old was called  upon to solve. The student can then compare his own solution of it  with the one that has come down to him, thus receiving correction and  guidance in his work from the hand of the master. It is plain that the  special excellencies of the original monument are likely to reveal  themselves with fresh distinctness, and to find special sympathy and  appreciation in the mind of one who has striven, however  unsuccessfully, to solve the same problem.    An example or two taken from widely different fields will suffice to  illustrate this. In studying vaulting, we once got so far as to  understand how oblong vaults were thrown across a nave, while square  vaults covered the aisles. A class of fifteen or twenty students were  then asked to find out how a semi-circular or polygonal apse could be  added to a choir roofed on this system. In the course of a couple of  hours' figuring I found that they had worked out among them all the  five solutions of this problem, which in the Middle Ages it took one  or two hundred years to develop. This was very encouraging. At another  time they were given a somewhat minute description of four pilaster  capitals from Blois or Chambord, and they made thumb-nail sketches on  the spot, according to their interpretation of the description. The  next day photographs and drawings of a dozen or twenty other such  capitals were given them, so that they might understand the fashion of  the time, and they were told to draw out their sketches on a larger  scale. The result was fifteen or twenty sets of capitals, all showing  the same four motives, but differing in a most interesting way,  according to the personal differences of taste"]]]
