He did not trouble  himself in the least about his soldiers; nor did he care to go either to  the theatre or the chase, except for the opportunities then afforded him  for displaying his new clothes. He had a different suit for each hour of  the day; and as of any other king or emperor, one is accustomed to say,  \"he is sitting in council,\" it was always said of him, \"The Emperor is  sitting in his wardrobe.\"    Time passed merrily in the large town which was his capital; strangers  arrived every day at the court. One day, two rogues, calling themselves  weavers, made their appearance. They gave out that they knew how to  weave stuffs of the most beautiful colors and elaborate patterns, the  clothes manufactured from which should have the wonderful property of  remaining invisible to everyone who was unfit for the office he held, or  who was extraordinarily simple in character.    \"These must, indeed, be splendid clothes!\" thought the Emperor. \"Had I  such a suit, I might at once find out what men in my realms are unfit  for their office, and also be able to distinguish the wise from the  foolish! This stuff must be woven for me immediately.\" And he caused  large sums of money to be given to both the weavers in order that they  might begin their work directly.    So the two pretended weavers set up two looms, and affected to work very  busily, though in reality they did nothing at all. They asked for the  most delicate silk and the purest gold thread; put both into their own  knapsacks; and then continued their pretended work at the empty looms  until late at night.    \"I should like to know how the weavers are getting on with my cloth,\"  said the Emperor to himself, after some little time had elapsed; he was,  however, rather embarrassed, when he remembered that a simpleton, or  one unfit for his office, would be unable to see the manufacture. To be  sure, he thought he had nothing to risk in his own person; but yet, he  would prefer sending somebody else, to bring him intelligence about the  weavers, and their work, before he troubled himself in the affair. All  the people throughout the city had heard of the wonderful property the  cloth was to possess; and all were anxious to learn how wise, or how  ignorant, their neighbors might prove to be.    \"I will send my faithful old minister to the weavers,\" said the Emperor  at last, after some deliberation, \"he will be best able to see how the  cloth looks; for he is a man of sense, and no one can be more suitable  for his office than he is.\"    So the faithful old minister went into the hall, where the knaves were  working with all their might, at their empty looms. \"What can be the  meaning of this?\" thought the old man, opening his eyes very wide. \"I  cannot discover the least bit of thread on the looms.\" However, he did  not express his thoughts aloud.    The impostors requested him very courteously to be so good as to come  nearer their looms; and then asked him whether the design pleased  him, and whether the colors were not very beautiful; at the same time  pointing to the empty frames. The poor old minister looked and looked,  he could not discover anything on the looms, for a very good reason,  viz: there was nothing there. \"What!\" thought he again. \"Is it possible  that I am a simpleton? I have never thought so myself; and no one must  know it now if I am so. Can it be, that I am unfit for my office? No,  that must not be said either. I will never confess that I could not see  the stuff.\"    \"Well, Sir Minister!\" said one of the knaves, still pretending to work.  \"You do not say whether the stuff pleases you.\"    \"Oh, it is excellent!\" replied the old minister, looking at the loom  through his spectacles. \"This pattern, and the colors, yes, I will tell  the Emperor without delay, how very beautiful I think them.\"    \"We shall be much obliged to you,\" said the impostors, and then they  named the different colors and described the pattern of the pretended  stuff. The old minister listened attentively to their words, in order  that he might repeat them to the Emperor; and then the knaves asked for  more silk and gold, saying that it was necessary to complete what  they had begun. However, they put all that was given them into their  knapsacks; and continued to work with as much apparent diligence as  before at their empty looms.    The Emperor now sent another officer of his court to see how the men  were getting on, and to ascertain whether the cloth would soon be  ready. It was just the same with this gentleman as with the minister;  he surveyed the looms on all sides, but could see nothing at all but the  empty frames.    \"Does not the stuff appear as beautiful to you, as it did to my lord the  minister?\" asked the impostors of the Emperor's second ambassador; at  the same time making the same gestures as before, and talking of the  design and colors which were not there.    \"I certainly am not stupid!\" thought the messenger. \"It must be, that I  am not fit for my good, profitable office! That is very odd; however, no  one shall know anything about it.\" And accordingly he praised the stuff  he could not see, and declared that he was delighted with both colors  and patterns. \"Indeed, please your Imperial Majesty,\" said he to his  sovereign when he returned, \"the cloth which the weavers are preparing  is extraordinarily magnificent.\"    The whole city was talking of the splendid cloth which the Emperor had  ordered to be woven at his own expense.    And now the Emperor himself wished to see the costly manufacture, while  it was still in the loom. Accompanied by a select number of officers of  the court, among whom were the two honest men who had already admired  the cloth, he went to the crafty impostors, who, as soon as they were  aware of the Emperor's approach, went on working more diligently than  ever; although they still did not pass a single thread through the  looms.    \"Is not the work absolutely magnificent?\" said the two officers of the  crown, already mentioned. \"If your Majesty will only be pleased to look  at it! What a splendid design! What glorious colors!\" and at the same  time they pointed to the empty frames; for they imagined that everyone  else could see this exquisite piece of workmanship.    \"How is this?\" said the Emperor to himself. \"I can see nothing! This  is indeed a terrible affair! Am I a simpleton, or am I unfit to be an  Emperor? That would be the worst thing that could happen--Oh! the cloth  is charming,\" said he, aloud. \"It has my complete approbation.\" And he  smiled most graciously, and looked closely at the empty looms; for on no  account would he say that he could not see what two of the officers of  his court had praised so much. All his retinue now strained their eyes,  hoping to discover something on the looms, but they could see no more  than the others; nevertheless, they all exclaimed, \"Oh, how beautiful!\"  and advised his majesty to have some new clothes made from this splendid  material, for the approaching procession. \"Magnificent! Charming!  Excellent!\" resounded on all sides; and everyone was uncommonly gay. The  Emperor shared in the general satisfaction; and presented the impostors  with the riband of an order of knighthood, to be worn in their  button-holes, and the title of \"Gentlemen Weavers.\"    The rogues sat up the whole of the night before the day on which the  procession was to take place, and had sixteen lights burning, so that  everyone might see how anxious they were to finish the Emperor's new  suit. They pretended to roll the cloth off the looms; cut the air with  their scissors; and sewed with needles without any thread in them.  \"See!\" cried they, at last. \"The Emperor's new clothes are ready!\"    And now the Emperor, with all the grandees of his court, came to the  weavers; and the rogues raised their arms, as if in the act of holding  something up, saying, \"Here are your Majesty's trousers! Here is the  scarf! Here is the mantle! The whole suit is as light as a cobweb;  one might fancy one has nothing at all on, when dressed in it; that,  however, is the great virtue of this delicate cloth.\"    \"Yes indeed!\" said all the courtiers, although not one of them could see  anything of this exquisite manufacture.    \"If your Imperial Majesty will be graciously pleased to take off your  clothes, we will fit on the new suit, in front of the looking glass.\"    The Emperor was accordingly undressed, and the rogues pretended to  array him in his new suit; the Emperor turning round, from side to side,  before the looking glass.    \"How splendid his Majesty looks in his new clothes, and how well they  fit!\" everyone cried out. \"What a design! What colors! These are indeed  royal robes!\"    \"The canopy which is to be borne over your Majesty, in the procession,  is waiting,\" announced the chief master of the ceremonies.    \"I am quite ready,\" answered the Emperor. \"Do my new clothes fit well?\"  asked he, turning himself round again before the looking glass, in order  that he might appear to be examining his handsome suit.    The lords of the bedchamber, who were to carry his Majesty's train felt  about on the ground, as if they were lifting up the ends of the mantle;  and pretended to be carrying something; for they would by no means  betray anything like simplicity, or"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16042"],[0,"The Wonder Book of Bible Stories (#1)"],[1,"Distributed Proofreading Team at https://www.pgdp.net                [Illustration: THE FINDING OF MOSES--The daughter of Pharaoh comes  to the water's edge and finds the child.

235          INTRODUCTION      The Bible is one of the two or three oldest books in the world, but  unlike most of the ancient books, it is found not only in great  libraries, but in almost every home of the civilized world; and it is  not only studied by learned scholars, but read by the common people; and  its many stories grasp and hold the attention of little children. Happy  is that child who has heard, over and over again, the Bible stories  until they have become fixed in his mind and memory, to become the  foundations of a noble life.    It is with the desire of aiding parents and teachers in telling these  stories, and aiding children to understand them, also in the hope that  they may be read in many schools, that a few among the many interesting  stories in the Bible have been chosen, brought together and as far as  necessary simplified to meet the minds of the young.    [Signature: Jesse Lyman Hurlbut]          THE STORY OF ADAM AND EVE      The first man's name was Adam and his wife he called Eve. They lived in  a beautiful Garden away in the East Country which was called Eden,  filled with beautiful trees and flowers of all kinds. But they did not  live in Eden long for they did not obey God's command, but ate the fruit  of a tree which had been forbidden them. They were driven forth by an  angel and had to give up their beautiful home.    [Illustration: _They were driven forth by an angel_]    So Adam and his wife went out into the world to live and to work. For a  time they were all alone, but after a while God gave them a little child  of their own, the first baby that ever came into the world. Eve named  him Cain; and after a time another baby came, whom she named Abel.    When the two boys grew up, they worked, as their father worked before  them. Cain, the older brother, chose to work in the fields, and to raise  grain and fruits. Abel, the younger brother, had a flock of sheep and  became a shepherd.    While Adam and Eve were living in the Garden of Eden, they could talk  with God and hear God's voice speaking to them. But now that they were  out in the world, they could no longer talk with God freely, as before.  So when they came to God, they built an altar of stones heaped up, and  upon it, they laid something as a gift to God, and burned it, to show  that it was not their own, but was given to God, whom they could not  see. Then before the altar they made their prayer to God, and asked God  to forgive their sins, all that they had done was wrong; and prayed God  to bless them and do good to them.    Each of these brothers, Cain and Abel, offered upon the altar to God his  own gift. Cain brought the fruits and the grain which he had grown; and  Abel brought a sheep from his flock, and killed it and burned it upon  the altar. For some reason God was pleased with Abel and his offering,  but was not pleased with Cain and his offering. Perhaps God wished Cain  to offer something that had life, as Abel offered; perhaps Cain's heart  was not right when he came before God.    And God"]]]
