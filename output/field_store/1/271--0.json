ELSIE'S  CHILDREN    A SEQUEL TO  \"ELSIE'S MOTHERHOOD\"      By  MARTHA FINLEY    Complete Authorized Edition    Published by arrangement with  Dodd, Mead and Company      A.L. BURT COMPANY    PUBLISHERS  New York Chicago          DODD, MEAD & COMPANY.    1877    1905, BY  DODD, MEAD & COMPANY.            Preface.      With this volume, bringing the Story of Elsie  and her Children down to the present time, the  series closes.    It was not by request of the author's _personal_  friends, that either this or any one of the previous  volumes was written, but in acquiescence with the  demands of the Public--the friends and admirers  of Elsie herself; and we know that as child, as  young girl, as wife and mother, she has had many  friends who have been loath to part with her.  May they find neither her nor her children less  lovable in this, than in the earlier volumes, and  may their society prove sweet, comforting and helpful  to many readers and friends both old and new.    M.F.          Elsie's Children.          CHAPTER FIRST.        \"Of all the joys that brighten suffering earth,       What joy is welcom'd like a new-born child.\"                                       --MRS. NORTON.        A merry scene in the nursery at Viamede, where the little Travillas are  waiting for their morning half hour with \"dear mamma.\" Mammy coming in  smiling and mysterious, her white apron thrown over something held  carefully in her arms, bids the children guess what it is.    \"A new dolly for me?\" says Vi; \"I'm going to have a birthday to-morrow.\"    \"A kite,\" ventured Harold. \"No, a balloon.\"    \"A tite! a tite!\" cried little Herbert, clapping his hands.    \"Pshaw! it's nothing but a bundle of clothes mammy's been doing up for one  of you girls,\" said Eddie. \"I see a bit of lace or work, or something,  hanging down below her apron.\"    \"Is it a new dress for Vi, mammy?\" asked Elsie, putting her arm about her  sister and giving her a loving kiss.    \"Yah, yah; you ain't no whar nigh it yet, chillens,\" laughed mammy,  dropping into a chair, and warding off an attempt on the part of little  Herbert to seize her prize and examine it for himself.    \"Oh, it's alive,\" cried Harold, half breathlessly, \"I saw it move!\" Then  as a slight sound followed the movement, \"A baby! a baby!\" they all  exclaim, \"O, mammy, whose is it? where did you get it? oh, sit down and  show it to us!\"    \"Why, chillen, I reckon it 'longs to us,\" returned mammy, complying with  the request, while they gathered closely about her with eager and  delighted faces.    \"Ours, mammy? Then I'm glad it isn't black or yellow like the babies down  at the quarter,\" said Harold, eying it with curiosity and interest.    \"So am I too,\" remarked Violet, \"but it's got such a red face and hardly  any hair on the top of its head.\"    \"Well, don't you remember that's the way Herbie looked when he first  came?\" said Eddie.    \"And he grew very white in a few weeks,\" remarked Elsie. \"But is it  mamma's baby, mammy?\"    \"Yes, honey, dat it am; sho's yer born, 'nother pet for ole mammy,--de  bressed little darlin',\" she answered, pressing the little creature to  her breast.    The information was received with a chorus of exclamations of delight and  admiration.    \"Tate a bite of cacker, boy,\" said Herbert, offering a cracker which he  was eating with evident enjoyment.    Mammy explained, amid the good-natured laughter of the older children,  that the newcomer had no teeth and couldn't eat anything but milk.    \"Oh, poor 'ittle fing!\" he said, softly touching its velvet cheek. \"Won't  'oo tum and pay wis Herbie?\"    \"No, it can't play,\" said Violet, \"it can't walk and it can't talk.\"    \"Where's mamma, mammy?\" asked Eddie, glancing at the clock; \"it's past her  time; I wonder too she didn't come to show us the new baby herself.\"    \"She's sick, chile,\" returned mammy, a grave and anxious look coming into  her old eyes.    \"Mamma sick?\" exclaimed little Elsie, \"oh, may I go to her?\"    Mammy shook her head. \"Not jes now, honey darlin', byme by, when she's  bettah.\"    \"Mamma sick?\" echoed Violet. \"Oh, I'm so, so sorry!\"    \"Don't fret, chillen, de good Lord make her well again soon,\" said mammy,  with cheerful hopefulness, for she could not bear to see how sad each  little face had grown, how the young lips quivered, and the bright eyes  filled with tears; for dearly, dearly, they all loved their sweet, gentle  mother.    \"Herbie wants mamma,\" sobbed the baby boy, clinging to his eldest sister.    \"Don't cry, pet,\" Elsie said chokingly, hugging him close and kissing away  his tears. \"We'll all ask God to make her well, and I'm sure he will.\"    \"Why! why! what's the matter here?\" cried a cheery voice, as the door  opened and Mr. Travilla stepped into their midst. \"What's the matter with  papa's darlings?\" he repeated, gathering them all into his arms, and  caressing each in turn.    \"Is mamma, dear mamma, very sick?\" they asked, Vi immediately adding in  joyous tones,    \"No, no, she isn't, or papa wouldn't look so happy.\"    \"I am very happy,\" he said with emotion, glancing toward the bundle in  mammy's lap, \"we are both very happy over the new treasure God has given  us; and I trust she will soon be well.\"    \"Can we go and speak to her?\" they asked.    \"After a while,\" he said, \"she is trying to sleep now. What do you all  think of the little sister?\"    \"Sister,\" cried Elsie. \"Oh, that is nice, nice! I thought it was a boy.  What's its name, papa?\"    \"It has none yet.\"    \"I sorry for it,\" remarked Herbert, gazing with curious interest at the  tiny creature, \"I sorry for it; cause can't walk, can't talk, can't eat  good fings; dot no teef to eat wis. Do, boy, try to eat cacker, cacker  dood, Herbie likes,\" and breaking off a fragment he would have forced it  into the wee mouth, if papa and mammy had not interfered for its  protection.    \"No, no, my son, you would choke it,\" said Mr. Travilla, gently drawing  him away.    \"It isn't a boy; it's a girl, Herbie,\" corrected Harold.    \"Oh!\" cried Vi, who was gently feeling the top of the tiny head, and she  looked aghast at her father, \"O, papa, its head's rotten!\"    \"No, daughter, don't be alarmed,\" he said smiling slightly, \"there's  nothing wrong there; all young babies' heads are soft like that on the  top.\"    \"Oh, are they?\" she said with a sigh of relief, \"I was afraid it would  spoil soon and we couldn't keep her.\"    \"No, she seems to be all right,\" he said with a grave and tender smile.  \"God has been very good to us.\"    \"Yes, papa. Oh such a pretty darling as it is!\" said Elsie.    \"Yes, indeed,\" chimed in the others; Vi adding, \"and I'm so glad she's a  girl: 'cause now we have two sisters, Elsie, just the same as the boys.\"    \"Oh, but we have three now!\" said Eddie, laughing good naturedly at Vi's  crestfallen look.    \"Oh, yes,\" she acknowledged, then brightening, \"but we have three  brothers, and you only two; so it's even all around after all, isn't it,  papa?\"    The children were full of delight over their treasure, and eager to show  it to grandpa, grandma, Aunt Rosie, Aunt Wealthy and Aunt May; regretting  much that the rest of their friends had left Viamede before the advent of  the little stranger.    She proved a frail, gentle little creature, with violet eyes and pale  golden hair, so fair and delicate that Lily was the name that most readily  suggested itself and the one finally settled upon as really hers.    Lily became a great pet with them all, but Violet claimed a special  property in her because as she would say, \"The darling came to us almost  on my birthday and she's just the sweetest, prettiest birthday present  mamma ever gave me.\"    The weather was growing very warm at Viamede and Aunt Wealthy and the  little Duncans found the heat oppressive; so when Lily was three weeks old  and the dear mamma able to be up again, looking bright and well, that  party bade good-bye and set out on their return to Lansdale.    The Dinsmores and Travillas lingered until the middle of May, when they  too set their faces northward, not parting company till very near to Ion  and the Oaks.          CHAPTER SECOND.        \"Envy is but the smoke of low estate,       Ascending still against the fortunate.\"                                   --BROOKE.      It was dark and raining a little when the carriage turned into the avenue  at Ion; but the whole front of the house was ablaze with lights, the hall  door stood wide open, and a double line of servants in holiday attire,  each sooty face dressed in smiles, stood waiting to welcome the weary  travelers home.    There were many hearty shakings and kissings of hands; many fervent  ejaculations: \"God bless you, Massa and Missus!\" \"Tank de Lord you's got  home again, honey. We's been pinin' for you darlin's and for de sight of  de new baby,\" and with the last words the voices were lowered at a sign  from Aunt Chloe, in whose arms the little Lily lay sleeping sweetly.    There was some fretting among the weary little ones, but mamma and nurses  were kind and gentle, and a good supper and bed soon cured all their  troubles for that night.    Little Elsie was roused from her slumbers by a gentle shake, and starting  up in bed, found the sun shining and Vi standing by her side with eager,  excited face.    \"Come, come to the window!\" she cried. \"It does seem as if I must be  dreaming; it wasn't there before, I'm sure.\"    \"What?\" asked Elsie, springing out upon the floor and hurrying after Vi to  the window from which she had witnessed the burning of the schoolhouse.    \"There!\" said Violet, pointing with her finger, \"there! can you see it  too?\"    \"Oh!\" exclaimed Elsie, clasping her hands in a sort of ecstasy of delight,  \"oh, aren't papa and mamma good? How did they ever come to think of it!  and how could they get it done while they were away?\"    \"Grandpa, Uncle Horace and Cal,\" suggested Vi. \"Oh, aren't you glad?  Aren't you glad,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14880"],[0,"McGuffey's Fourth Eclectic Reader (#1)"],[1,"[Transcriber's Note:    Welcome to the schoolroom of 1900. The moral tone is plain.  \"She is kind to the old blind man.\"    The exercises are still suitable, and perhaps more helpful than some  contemporary alternatives. Much is left to the teacher. Explanations given  in the text are enough to get started teaching a child to read and write.  Counting in Roman numerals is included as a bonus in the form of lesson  numbers.    The form of contractions includes a space. The contemporary word \"don't\"  was rendered as \"do n't\".    The author, not listed in the text, is William Holmes McGuffey.    Passages using non-ASCI characters are approximately rendered in this text  version. See the PDF or DOC versions for the original images.    The section numbers are decimal in the Table of Contents but are in  Roman Numerals in the body.    Page headings are removed, but section titles are followed by the page on  which they appear.
