The author of this volume desires by way of preface to say just two  things:--firstly, that it is his earnest hope that this record of a hero  may be an aid to brave and true living in the Republic, so that the  problems knocking at its door for solution may find the heads, the  hands, and the hearts equal to the performance of the duties imposed by  them upon the men and women of this generation. William Lloyd Garrison  was brave and true. Bravery and truth were the secret of his marvelous  career and achievements. May his countrymen and countrywomen imitate his  example and be brave and true, not alone in emergent moments, but in  everyday things as well.    So much for the author's firstly, now for his secondly, which is to  acknowledge his large indebtedness in the preparation of this book to  that storehouse of anti-slavery material, the story of the life of  William Lloyd Garrison by his children. Out of its garnered riches he  has filled his sack.    HYDE PARK, MASS., May 10, 1891.              CONTENTS.

THE FATHER OF THE MAN.      William Lloyd Garrison was born in Newburyport, Massachusetts, December  10, 1805. Forty years before, Daniel Palmer, his great-grandfather,  emigrated from Massachusetts and settled with three sons and a daughter  on the St. John River, in Nova Scotia. The daughter's name was Mary, and  it was she who was to be the future grandmother of our hero. One of the  neighbors of Daniel Palmer was Joseph Garrison, who was probably an  Englishman. He was certainly a bachelor. The Acadian solitude of five  hundred acres and Mary Palmer's charms proved too much for the  susceptible heart of Joseph Garrison. He wooed and won her, and on his  thirtieth birthday she became his wife. The bride herself was but  twenty-three, a woman of resources and of presence of mind, as she  needed to be in that primitive settlement. Children and cares came apace  to the young wife, and we may be sure confined her more and more closely  to her house. But in the midst of a fast-increasing family and of  multiplying cares a day's outing did occasionally come to the busy  housewife, when she would go down the river to spend it at her father's  farm. Once, ten years after her marriage, she had a narrow escape on one  of those rare days. She had started in a boat with her youngest child,  Abijah, and a lad who worked in her household. It was spring and the St.  John was not yet clear of ice. Higher up the river the ice broke that  morning and came floating down with the current. The boat in which Mary  Garrison and her baby rode was overtaken by the fragments and wrecked.  The mother with her child sought refuge on a piece of ice and was driven  shoreward. Wrapping Abijah in all the clothes she could spare she threw  him ashore. She and the lad followed by the aid of an overhanging willow  bough. The baby was unharmed, for she had thrown him into a snow-bank.  But the perils of the river gave place to the perils of the woods. In  them Mary Garrison wandered with her infant, who was no less a personage  than the father of William Lloyd Garrison, until at length she found the  hut of a friendly Indian, who took her in and \"entertained her with his  best words and deeds, and the next morning conducted her safely to her  father's.\"    The Palmers were a hardy, liberty-loving race of farmers, and Joseph  Garrison was a man of unusual force and independence of character. The  life which these early settlers lived was a life lived partly on the  land and partly on the river. They were equally at home with scythe or  oar. Amid such terraqueous conditions it was natural enough that the  children should develop a passion for the sea. Like ducks many of them  took to the water and became sailors. Abijah was a sailor. The  amphibious habits of boyhood gave to his manhood a restless, roving  character. Like the element which he loved he was in constant motion. He  was a man of gifts both of mind and body. There was besides a strain of  romance and adventure in his blood. By nature and his seafaring life he  probably craved strong excitement. This craving was in part appeased no  doubt by travel and drink. He took to the sea and he took to the cup.  But he was more than a creature of appetites, he was a man of sentiment.  Being a man of sentiment what should he do but fall in love. The woman  who inspired his love was no ordinary woman, but a genuine Acadian  beauty. She was a splendid specimen of womankind. Tall she was, graceful  and admirably proportioned. Never before had Abijah in all his  wanderings seen a creature of such charms of person. Her face matched  the attractions of her form and her mind matched the beauty of her face.  She possessed a nature almost Puritanic in its abhorrence of sin, and in  the strength of its moral convictions. She feared to do wrong more than  she feared any man. With this supremacy of the moral sense there went  along singular firmness of purpose and independence of character. When a  mere slip of a girl she was called upon to choose between regard for her  religious convictions and regard for her family. It happened in this  wise. Fanny Lloyd's parents were Episcopalians, who were inclined to  view with contempt fellow-Christians of the Baptist persuasion. To have  a child of theirs identify herself with this despised sect was one of  those crosses which they could not and would not bear. But Fanny had in  a fit of girlish frolic entered one of the meetings of these low-caste  Christians. What she heard changed the current of her life. She knew  thenceforth that God was no respecter of persons, and that the crucified  Nazarene looked not upon the splendor of ceremonies but upon the  thoughts of the heart of His disciples. Here in a barn, amid vulgar  folk, and uncouth, dim surroundings, He had appeared, He, her Lord and  Master. He had touched her with that white unspeakable appeal. The  laughter died upon the fair girlish face and prayer issued from the  beautiful lips. If vulgar folk, the despised Baptists, were good enough  for the Christ, were they not good enough for her? Among them she had  felt His consecrating touch and among them she determined to devote  herself to Him. Her parents commanded and threatened but Fanny Lloyd was  bent on obeying the heavenly voice of duty rather than father and  mother. They had threatened that if she allowed herself to be baptised  they would turn her out of doors. Fanny was baptised and her parents  made good the threat. Their home was no longer her home. She had the  courage of her conviction--ability to suffer for a belief.    Such was the woman who subsequently became the wife of Abijah Garrison,  and the mother of one of the greatest moral heroes of the century.  Abijah followed the sea, and she for several years with an increasing  family followed Abijah. First from one place and then another she glided  after him in her early married life. He loved her and his little ones  but the love of travel and change was strong within him. He was ever  restless and changeful. During one of his roving fits he emigrated with  his family from Nova Scotia to the United States. It was in the spring  of 1805 that he and they landed in Newburyport. The following December  his wife presented him with a boy, whom they called William Lloyd  Garrison. Three years afterward Abijah deserted his wife and children.  Of the causes which led to this act nothing is now known.

PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION      The present work treats the problem of the Origin of Species on the same  general lines as were adopted by Darwin; but from the standpoint reached  after nearly thirty years of discussion, with an abundance of new facts  and the advocacy of many new or old theories.    While not attempting to deal, even in outline, with the vast subject of  evolution in general, an endeavour has been made to give such an account  of the theory of Natural Selection as may enable any intelligent reader  to obtain a clear conception of Darwin's work, and to understand  something of the power and range of his great principle.    Darwin wrote for a generation which had not accepted evolution, and  which poured contempt on those who upheld the derivation of species from  species by any natural law of descent. He did his work so well that  \"descent with modification\" is now universally accepted as the order of  nature in the organic world; and the rising generation of naturalists  can hardly realise the novelty of this idea, or that their fathers  considered it a scientific heresy to be condemned rather than seriously  discussed.    The objections now made to Darwin's theory apply, solely, to the  particular means by which the change of species has been brought about,  not to the fact of that change. The objectors seek to minimise the  agency of natural selection and to subordinate it to laws of variation,  of use and disuse, of intelligence, and of heredity. These views and  objections are urged with much force and more confidence, and for the  most part by the modern school of laboratory naturalists, to whom the  peculiarities and distinctions of species, as such, their distribution  and their affinities, have little interest as compared with the problems  of histology and embryology, of physiology and morphology. Their work in  these departments is of the greatest interest and of the highest  importance, but it is not the kind of work which, by itself, enables one  to form a sound judgment on the questions involved in the action of the  law of natural selection. These rest mainly on the external and vital  relations of species to species in a state of nature--on what has been  well termed by Semper the \"physiology of organisms,\" rather than on the  anatomy or physiology of organs.           *       *       *       *       *    It has always been considered a weakness in Darwin's work that he based  his theory, primarily, on the evidence of variation in domesticated  animals and cultivated plants. I have endeavoured to secure a firm  foundation for the theory in the variations of organisms in a state of  nature; and as the exact amount and precise character of these  variations is of paramount importance in the numerous problems that  arise when we apply the theory to explain the facts of nature, I have  endeavoured, by means of a series of diagrams, to exhibit to the eye the  actual variations as they are found to exist in a sufficient number of  species. By doing this, not only does the reader obtain a better and  more precise idea of variation than can be given by any number of  tabular statements or cases of extreme individual variation, but we  obtain a basis of fact by which to test the statements and objections  usually put forth on the subject of specific variability; and it will be  found that, throughout the work, I have frequently to appeal to these  diagrams and the facts they illustrate, just as Darwin was accustomed to  appeal to the facts of variation among dogs and pigeons.    I have also made what appears to me an important change in the  arrangement of the subject. Instead of treating first the comparatively  difficult and unfamiliar details of variation, I commence with the  Struggle for Existence, which is really the fundamental phenomenon on  which natural selection depends, while the particular facts which  illustrate it are comparatively familiar and very interesting. It has  the further advantage that, after discussing variation and the effects  of artificial selection, we proceed at once to explain how natural  selection acts.    Among the subjects of novelty or interest discussed in this volume, and  which have important bearings on the theory of natural selection, are:  (1) A proof that all _specific_ characters are (or once have been)  either useful in themselves or correlated with useful characters (Chap.  VI); (2) a proof that natural selection can, in certain cases, increase  the sterility of crosses (Chap. VII); (3) a fuller discussion of the  colour relations of animals, with additional facts and arguments on the  origin of sexual differences of colour (Chaps. VIII-X); (4) an attempted  solution of the difficulty presented by the occurrence of both very  simple and very complex modes of securing the cross-fertilisation of  plants (Chap. XI); (5) some fresh facts and arguments on the  wind-carriage of seeds, and its bearing on the wide dispersal of many  arctic and alpine plants (Chap. XII); (6) some new illustrations of the  non-heredity of acquired characters, and a proof that the effects of use  and disuse, even if inherited, must be overpowered by natural selection  (Chap. XIV); and (7) a new argument as to the nature and origin of the  moral and intellectual faculties of man (Chap. XV).           *       *       *       *       *    Although I maintain, and even enforce, my differences from some of  Darwin's views, my whole work tends forcibly to illustrate the  overwhelming importance of Natural Selection over all other agencies in  the production of new species. I thus take up Darwin's earlier  position, from which he somewhat receded in the later editions of his  works, on account of criticisms and objections which I have endeavoured  to show are unsound. Even in rejecting that phase of sexual selection  depending on female choice, I insist on the greater efficacy of natural  selection. This is pre-eminently the Darwinian doctrine, and I therefore  claim for my book the position of being the advocate of pure Darwinism.    I wish to express my obligation to Mr. Francis Darwin for lending me  some of his father's unused notes, and to many other friends for facts  or information, which have, I believe, been acknowledged either in the  text or footnotes. Mr. James Sime has kindly read over the proofs and  given me many useful suggestions; and I have to thank Professor Meldola,  Mr. Hemsley, and Mr. E.B. Poulton for valuable notes or corrections in  the later chapters in which their special subjects are touched upon.    GODALMING, _March 1889_.
