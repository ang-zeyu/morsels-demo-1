At the election of President and Vice President of the United States,  and members of Congress, in November, 1872, SUSAN B. ANTHONY, and  several other women, offered their votes to the inspectors of election,  claiming the right to vote, as among the privileges and immunities  secured to them as citizens by the fourteenth amendment to the  Constitution of the United States. The inspectors, JONES, HALL, and  MARSH, by a majority, decided in favor of receiving the offered votes,  against the dissent of HALL, and they were received and deposited in the  ballot box. For this act, the women, fourteen in number, were arrested  and held to bail, and indictments were found against them severally,  under the 19th Section of the Act of Congress of May 30th, 1870, (16 St.  at L. 144.) charging them with the offense of \"knowingly voting without  having a lawful right to vote.\" The three inspectors were also arrested,  but only two of them were held to bail, HALL having been discharged by  the Commissioner on whose warrant they were arrested. All three, however  were jointly indicted under the same statute--for having \"knowingly and  wilfully received the votes of persons not entitled to vote.\"    Of the women voters, the case of Miss ANTHONY alone was brought to  trial, a _nolle prosequi_ having been entered upon the other  indictments. Upon the trial of Miss ANTHONY before the U.S. Circuit  Court for the Northern District of New York, at Canandaigua, in June,  1873, it was proved that before offering her vote she was advised by her  counsel that she had a right to vote; and that she entertained no doubt,  at the time of voting, that she was entitled to vote. It was claimed in  her behalf:    I. That she was legally entitled to vote.    II. That if she was not so entitled, but voted in good faith in the  belief that it was her right, she was guilty of no crime.    III. That she did vote in such good faith, and with such belief.    The court held that the defendant had no right to vote--that good faith  constituted no defence--that there was nothing in the case for the jury  to decide, and directed them to find a verdict of guilty; refusing to  submit, at the request of the defendant's counsel, any question to the  jury, or to allow the clerk to ask the jurors, severally, whether they  assented to the verdict which the court had directed to be entered. The  verdict of guilty was entered by the clerk, as directed by the court,  without any express assent or dissent on the part of the jury. A fine of  $100, and costs, was imposed upon the defendant.    Miss ANTHONY insists that in these proceedings, the fundamental  principle of criminal law, that no person can be a criminal unless the  mind be so--that an honest mistake is not a crime, has been disregarded;  that she has been denied her constitutional right of trial by jury, the  jury having had no voice in her conviction; that she has been denied her  right to have the response of every juror to the question, whether he  did or did not assent to the verdict which the court directed the clerk  to enter.    The trial of the three inspectors followed that of Miss ANTHONY, and all  were convicted, the court holding, as in the case of Miss ANTHONY, that  good faith on their part in receiving the votes was not a protection;  which they think a somewhat severe rule of law, inasmuch as the statute  provides the same penalty, and in the same sentence, \"for knowingly and  wilfully receiving the vote of any person not entitled to vote, or  refusing to receive the vote of any person entitled to vote.\" The  inspectors claim, that according to this exposition of the law, they  were placed in a position which required them, without any opportunity  to investigate or take advice in regard to the right of any voter whose  right was questioned, to decide the question correctly, at the peril of  a term in the state's prison if they made a mistake; and, though this  may be a correct exposition of the law in their case, they would be  sorry to see it applied to the decisions of any court, not excepting the  tribunal by which they were convicted.    The defendant, HALL, is at a loss to know how he could have avoided the  penalty, inasmuch as he did all that he could in the way of rejecting  the votes, without throttling his co-inspectors, and forcing them to  desist from the wrong of receiving them. He is of opinion that by the  ruling of the Court, he would have been equally guilty, if he had tried  his strength in that direction, and had failed of success.    To preserve a full record of so important a judicial determination, and  to enable the friends of the convicted parties to understand precisely  the degree of criminality which attaches to them in consequence of these  convictions, the following pamphlet has been prepared--giving a more  full and accurate statement of the proceedings than can elsewhere be  found.
