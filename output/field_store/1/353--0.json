[Illustration: DRYING HOUSE FOR HERBS.]    From the rafters of the roof of the Drying House are suspended in  bunches all the herbs that the grower cultivates. To accelerate the  desiccation of rose leaves and other petals, the Drying House is fitted  up with large cupboards, which are slightly warmed with a convolving  flue, heated from a fire below.    The flower buds are placed upon trays made of canvas stretched upon a  frame rack, being not less than twelve feet long by four feet wide. When  charged they are placed on shelves in the warm cupboards till dry.

By universal consent, the physical faculties of man have been divided  into five senses,--seeing, hearing, touching, tasting, and smelling. It  is of matter pertaining to the faculty of Smelling that this book mainly  treats. Of the five senses, that of smelling is the least valued, and,  as a consequence, is the least tutored; but we must not conclude from  this, our own act, that it is of insignificant importance to our welfare  and happiness.    By neglecting to tutor the olfactory nerve, we are constantly led to  breathe impure air, and thus poison the body by neglecting the warning  given at the gate of the lungs. Persons who use perfumes are more  sensitive to the presence of a vitiated atmosphere than those who  consider the faculty of smelling as an almost useless gift.    In the early ages of the world the use of perfumes was in constant  practice, and it had the high sanction of Scriptural authority.    The patrons of perfumery have always been considered the most civilized  and refined people of the earth. If refinement consists in knowing how  to enjoy the faculties which we possess, then must we learn not only how  to distinguish the harmony of color and form, in order to please the  sight, the melody of sweet sounds to delight the ear; the comfort of  appropriate fabrics to cover the body, and to please the touch, but the  smelling faculty must be shown how to gratify itself with the  odoriferous products of the garden and the forest.    Pathologically considered, the use of perfumes is in the highest degree  prophylactic; the refreshing qualities of the citrine odors to an  invalid is well known. Health has often been restored when life and  death trembled in the balance, by the mere sprinkling of essence of  cedrat in a sick chamber.    The commercial value of flowers is of no mean importance to the wealth  of nations. But, vast as is the consumption of perfumes by the people  under the rule of the British Empire, little has been done in England  towards the establishment of flower-farms, or the production of the raw  odorous substances in demand by the manufacturing perfumers of Britain;  consequently nearly the whole are the produce of foreign countries.  However, I have every hope that ere long the subject will attract the  attention of the Society of Arts, and favorable results will doubtless  follow. Much of the waste land in England, and especially in Ireland,  could be very profitably employed if cultivated with odor-bearing  plants.    The climate of some of the British colonies especially fits them for the  production of odors from flowers that require elevated temperature to  bring them to perfection.    But for the lamented death of Mr. Charles Piesse,[A] Colonial Secretary  for Western Australia, I have every reason to believe that flower-farms  would have been established in that colony long ere the publication of  this work. Though thus personally frustrated in adapting a new and  useful description of labor to British enterprise, I am no less sanguine  of the final result in other hands.    Mr. Kemble, of Jamaica, has recently sent to England some fine samples  of Oil of Behn. The Moringa, from which it is produced, has been  successfully cultivated by him. The Oil of Behn, being a perfectly  inodorous fat oil, is a valuable agent for extracting the odors of  flowers by the maceration process.    At no distant period I hope to see, either at the Crystal Palace,  Sydenham, at the Royal Botanical Gardens, Kew, or elsewhere, a place to  illustrate the commercial use of flowers--eye-lectures on the methods of  obtaining the odors of plants and their various uses. The  horticulturists of England, being generally unacquainted with the  methods of economizing the scents from the flowers they cultivate,  entirely lose what would be a very profitable source of income. For many  ages copper ore was thrown over the cliffs into the sea by the Cornish  miners working the tin streams; how much wealth was thus cast away by  ignorance we know not, but there is a perfect parallel between the old  miners and the modern gardeners.    Many readers of the \"Gardeners' Chronicle\" and of the \"Annals of  Pharmacy and Chemistry\" will recognize in the following pages much  matter that has already passed under their eyes.    To be of the service intended, such matter must however have a book  form; I have therefore collected from the above-mentioned periodicals  all that I considered might be useful to the reader.    To Sir Wm. Hooker, Dr. Lindley, Mr. W. Dickinson, and Mr. W. Bastick, I  respectfully tender my thanks for the assistance they have so freely  given whenever I have had occasion to seek their advice.          Contents.      PREFACE      SECTION I.

The stories given are for  the most part adaptations of favorite tales from folklore,--Andersen,  Grimm, AEsop, and the Arabian Nights having been freely drawn upon.    Children are dramatic by nature. They _are_ for the time the kings, the  fairies, and the heroes that they picture in their imaginations. They  _are_ these characters with such abandon and with such intense pleasure  that the on-looker must believe that nature intended that they should  give play to this dramatic instinct, not so much formally, with all the  trappings of the man-made stage, but spontaneously and naturally, as  they talk and read. If this expressive instinct can be utilized in the  teaching of reading, we shall be able both to add greatly to the child's  enjoyment and to improve the quality of his oral reading. In these days  when so many books are hastily read in school, there is a tendency to  sacrifice expression to the mechanics and interpretation of reading.  Those acquainted with school work know too well the resulting  monotonous, indistinct speech and the self-conscious, listless attitude  which characterize so much of the reading of pupils in grades above the  third. It is believed that these readers will aid in overcoming these  serious faults in reading, which all teachers and parents deplore. The  dramatic appeal of the stories will cause the child to lose himself in  the character he is impersonating and read with a naturalness and  expressiveness unknown to him before, and this improvement will be  evident in all his oral reading, and even in his speech.    The use of the books permits the whole range of expression, from merely  reading the stories effectively, to \"acting them out\" with as little, or  as much, stage-setting or costuming as a parent or teacher may desire.  The stories are especially designed to be read as a part of the regular  reading work. Many different plans for using the books will suggest  themselves to the teacher. After a preliminary reading of a story during  the study period, the teacher may assign different parts to various  children, she herself reading the stage directions and the other brief  descriptions unclosed in brackets. The italicized explanations in  parentheses are not intended to be read aloud; they will aid in giving  the child the cue as to the way the part should be rendered. After the  story has been read in this way, if thought advisable it can be played  informally and simply, with no attempt at costuming or theatric effects.  It will often add to the interest of the play to have some of the  children represent certain of the inanimate objects of the scene, as the  forest, the town gate, a door, etc. Occasionally, for the \"open day,\" or  as a special exercise, a favorite play may be given by the children with  the simplest kind of costuming and stage-setting. These can well be made  in the school as a part of the manual training and sewing work. In  giving the play, it will generally be better not to have pupils memorize  the exact words of the book, but to depend upon the impromptu rendering  of their parts. This method will contribute more largely to the training  in English.    The best results will usually be obtained by using this book in the  third grade. In some schools, however, it may profitably be used in the  second grade.    A.S.
