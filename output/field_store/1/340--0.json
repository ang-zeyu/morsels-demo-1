With an Introductory Essay                           By Edwin Wolf 2nd          ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS      I want here to express my thanks and appreciation to Mr. Lessing  J. Rosenwald, through whose kindness this unique Doctrina was  presented to the Library of Congress and with whom the idea of this  publication originated. His interest and enthusiasm made possible  my work, and his friendly advice and encouragement have been both  valuable and heart-warming.    I also wish to thank others who have given me great assistance. They  are Dr. A.S.W. Rosenbach to whom I continually turned for advice,  Dr. Lawrence C. Wroth of the John Carter Brown Library and Dr. Leslie  W. Dunlap of the Library of Congress who very kindly read over my  manuscript and gave me the benefit of their suggestions and criticisms,  Mr. David C. Mearns and Miss Elsie Rackstraw of the Library of Congress  and Mrs. Ruth Lapham Butler of the Ayer Collection of the Newberry  Library who so freely and generously made available to me the great  collections of works on the Philippines in their libraries, Dr. John  H. Powell of the Free Library of Philadelphia who helped me find  reference books of the utmost importance, and the many librarians  who courteously answered written queries about early Philippine  material.                                 EDWIN WOLF 2ND.              DOCTRINA CHRISTIANA      The first book printed in the Philippines has been the object of a hunt  which has extended from Manila to Berlin, and from Italy to Chile,  for four hundred and fifty years. The patient research of scholars,  the scraps of evidence found in books and archives, the amazingly  accurate hypotheses of bibliographers who have sifted the material  so painstakingly gathered together, combine to make its history a  bookish detective story par excellence.    It is easy when a prisoner has been arrested and brought to the dock to  give details of his complexion, height, characteristics and identifying  marks, to fingerprint him and to photograph him, but how inadequate  was the description before his capture, how frequently did false scents  draw the pursuer off the right track! It is with this in mind that we  examine the subject of this investigation, remembering that it has not  been done before in detail. And, to complete the case, the book has  been photographed in its entirety and its facsimile herewith published.    In studying the Doctrina Christiana of 1593 there are four general  problems which we shall discuss. First, we shall give a physical  description of the book. Secondly, we shall trace chronologically the  bibliographical history of the Doctrina, that is, we shall record the  available evidence which shows that it was the first book printed in  the Philippines, and weigh the testimonies which state or imply to  the contrary. Thirdly, we shall try to establish the authorship of  the text, and lastly, we shall discuss the actual printing.    It hardly needs be told why so few of the incunabula of the Philippines  have survived. The paper on which they were printed was one of the most  destructible papers ever used in book production. The native worms and  insects thrived on it, and the heat and dampness took their slower but  equally certain toll. Add to these enemies the acts of providence of  which the Philippines have received more than their share--earthquake,  fire and flood--and the man-made devastations of war, combined with the  fact that there was no systematic attempt made in the Philippines to  preserve in archives and libraries the records of the past, and it  can well be understood why a scant handful of cradle-books have been  preserved. The two fires of 1603 alone, which burned the Dominican  convent in Manila to the ground and consumed the whole of Binondo just  outside the walls, must have played untold havoc upon the records of  the early missionaries. Perhaps the only copies of early Philippine  books which exist today, unchronided and forgotten, are those which  were sent to Europe in the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries, and may  now be lying uncatalogued in some library there.    One copy of this Doctrina was sent to Philip II by the Governor of  the Philippines in 1593; and in 1785 a Jesuit philologist, Hervas y  Panduro, printed Tagalog texts from a then extant copy. Yet, since  that time no example is recorded as having been seen by bibliographer  or historian. The provenance of the present one is but imperfectly  known. In the spring of 1946 William H. Schab, a New York dealer,  was in Paris, and heard through a friend of the existence of a 1593  Manila book. He expressed such incredulity at this information that his  friend, feeling his integrity impugned, telephoned the owner then and  there, and confirmed the unbelievable \"1593.\" Delighted and enthused,  Schab arranged to meet him, found that he was a Paris bookseller and  collector who specialized in Pacific imprints and was fully aware of  the importance of the volume, and induced him to sell the precious  Doctrina. He brought it back with him to the United States and offered  it to Lessing J. Rosenwald, who promptly purchased it and presented it  to the Library of Congress. Where the book had been before it reached  Paris we do not know. Perhaps it is the very copy sent to Philip II,  perhaps the copy from which Hervas got his text. Indeed, it may  have been churned to the surface by the late Civil War in Spain,  and sent from there to France. In the course of years from similar  sources may come other books to throw more light upon the only too  poorly documented history of the establishment of printing in the  Philippine Islands.        THE PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION      Let us first examine the book as it appears before us. The title-page  reads:                  Doctrina Christiana, en              lengua espanola ytagala, cor              regida por los Religiosos de las              ordenes Impressa con licencia, en              S. gabriel. de la orden de. S. Domigo              En Manila. 1593      The book, printed in Gothic letters and Tagalog [1] characters on  paper made from the paper mulberry, now browned and brittle with age,  consists of thirty-eight leaves, comprising a title-page as above,  under a woodcut [2] of St. Dominic, with the verso originally blank,  but in this copy bearing the contemporary manuscript inscription,  _Tassada en dos rreales_, signed _Juan de Cuellar_; and seventy-four  pages of text in Spanish, Tagalog transliterated into roman letters,  and Tagalog in Tagalog characters. The size of the volume, which  is unbound, is 9 1/8 by 7 inches, although individual leaves vary  somewhat due to chipping. Some of the leaves have become separated  from their complements, but enough remain in the original stitching  to indicate that the book was originally made up in four gatherings,  the first of twelve leaves, the second of ten, the third of ten, and  the fourth of six. Although the book is of the size called quarto,  the method of printing must have been page by page, so it is doubtful  that each sheet was folded twice in the usual quarto manner, but  more probable that it was printed four pages to a sheet of paper  approximately 9 1/8 by 14 inches, which was folded once.    The volume is printed throughout by the xylographic method, that is to  say, each page of text is printed from one wood-block which was carved  by hand. Along the inner margins of some pages are vertical lines which  were made by the inked edge of the block, and the grain of the wood has  caused striations to appear in the printed portions throughout. The  unevenness of the impression indicates that the pages were printed  in some primitive manner without the help of a conventional press.    The paper, which is one of the distinctive features of most old  Oriental books, has been discussed at length by Pardo de Tavera in  his study of early Philippine printing, and we can do no better than  translate the relevant passage in full:          \"I have said before that the material composition of our      books is inferior. The imprints before 1830 were made on a      paper called by some rice paper, by others silk paper, and      by still others China paper, according to their taste. It      is detestable, brittle, without consistency or resistance,      and was called rice paper because it was supposed to be      made from that grain. It was the only kind then used in the      Philippines, not only for printing, but for all manner of      writing, letters, etc., and it is even recorded that in 1874      when tobacco was a state monopoly, cigarettes were made with      this paper, and that the Indians and Chinese preferred it      (and perhaps they still do) to rag paper or other kinds,      because of the horrible taste it gives the tobacco.        \"In China they commonly made paper of bamboo, but more      principally from cotton and a plant which travellers have cited      only by its common name, which they transcribe in various ways,      calling it _kochu_, _kotsu_, or _kotzu_. Today it is known      that this plant is an ulmacea (_Broussonetia papyrifera_)      from a mash of which they still make cloth in Japan. Cotton      paper is superior to it, and naturally more expensive; but      the paper of inferior quality which was received in Manila,      where nothing was imported regularly but common articles of low      price, was of _kotsu._ As all Chinese-made paper it was coated      with alum, the finer [the paper] the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16130"],[0,"Judgments of the Court of Appeal of New Zealand on Proceedings to Review Aspects (#1)"],[1,"Distributed Proofreading Team (https://www.pgdp.net)        JUDGMENTS OF THE COURT OF APPEAL OF NEW ZEALAND ON PROCEEDINGS TO REVIEW  ASPECTS OF THE REPORT OF THE ROYAL COMMISSION OF INQUIRY INTO THE MOUNT  EREBUS AIRCRAFT DISASTER    C.A. 95/81    In the Court of Appeal of New Zealand--Between Air New Zealand Limited,  First Applicant, and Morrison Ritchie Davis, Second Applicant, and Ian  Harding Gemmell, Third Applicant, and Peter Thomas Mahon, First  Respondent, and the Attorney-General, Fourth Respondent, and New Zealand  Airline Pilots Association, Fifth Respondent, and the Attorney-General,  Sixth Respondent.      _Coram_    Woodhouse P.

JUDGMENT OF COOKE, RICHARDSON and SOMERS JJ.      On 5 August 1981, for reasons then given, this Court ordered that these  proceedings be removed as a whole from the High Court to this Court for  hearing and determination. They are proceedings, brought by way of  application for judicial review, in which certain parts of the report of  the Royal Commission on the Mount Erebus aircraft disaster are attacked.  In summary the applicants claim that these parts are contrary to law, in  excess of jurisdiction and in breach of natural justice.    One of the reasons for ordering the removal was that it was important  that the complaints be finally adjudicated on as soon as reasonably  practicable. We had in mind that the magnitude of the disaster--257  lives were lost--made it a national and indeed international tragedy, so  the early resolution of any doubts as to the validity of the report was  a matter of great public concern. Also the report contained very severe  criticism of certain senior officers of Air New Zealand. Naturally this  criticism must have been having damaging and continuing effects, as  evidenced for instance by the resignation of the chief executive, so it  was right that the airline and the individuals should have at a  reasonably early date a definite decision, one way or the other, on  whether their complaints were justified.    In the event the hearing in this Court was completed in less than six  days. We had envisaged that some further days might be required for  cross-examination, as there were applications for leave to cross-examine  the airline personnel and the Royal Commissioner himself on affidavits  that they had made in the proceedings. But ultimately the parties  elected to have no cross-examination--and it should be made clear that  this was by agreement reached between the parties, not by decision of  the Court. With the benefit of the very full written and oral arguments  submitted by counsel, the Court is now in a position to given judgment  before the end of the year.    We must begin by removing any possible misconception about the scope of  these proceedings. They are not proceedings in which this Court can  adjudicate on the causes of the disaster. The question of causation is  obviously a difficult one, as shown by the fact that the Commissioner  and the Chief Inspector of Air Accidents in his report came to different  conclusions on it. But it is not this Court's concern now. This is not  an appeal. Parties to hearings by Commissions of Inquiry have no rights  of appeal against the reports. The reason is partly that the reports  are, in a sense, inevitably inconclusive. Findings made by Commissioners  are in the end only expressions of opinion. They would not even be  admissible in evidence in legal proceedings as to the cause of a  disaster. In themselves they do not alter the legal rights of the  persons to whom they refer. Nevertheless they may greatly influence  public and Government opinion and have a devastating effect on personal  reputations; and in our judgment these are the major reasons why in  appropriate proceedings the Courts must be ready if necessary, in  relation to Commissions of Inquiry just as to other public bodies and  officials, to ensure that they keep within the limits of their lawful  powers and comply with any applicable rules of natural justice.    Although this is not an appeal on causation or on any other aspect of  the Commission's report, the issues with which this Court is properly  concerned--the extent of the Commissioner's powers in this inquiry, and  natural justice--cannot be considered without reference to the issues  and evidence at the inquiry. We are very conscious that we have not had  the advantage of seeing and hearing the witnesses. It can be very real,  as all lawyers know. It is true that the kind of analytical argument we  heard from counsel, with concentration focused on the passages of major  importance in the report and the transcript of evidence, can bring  matters into better perspective than long immersion in the details of a  case. Necessarily this Court is more detached from the whole matter than  was the Commissioner. And several different judicial minds may combine  to produce a more balanced view than one can. But as against those  advantages, which we have had, there is the advantage of months of  direct exposure to the oral evidence, which he had. So we have to be  very cautious in forming opinions on fact where there is any room for  different interpretations of the evidence.    Having stressed those limitations on the role of this Court, we think it  best to state immediately in general terms the conclusions that we have  reached in this case. Then we will go on to explain the background, the  issues and our reasoning in more detail. Our general conclusion is that  the paragraph in the report (377) in which the Commissioner purported to  find that there had been 'a pre-determined plan of deception' and 'an  orchestrated litany of lies' was outside his jurisdiction and contained  findings made contrary of natural justice. For these reasons we hold  that there is substance in the complaints made by the airline and the  individuals. Because of those two basic defects, an injustice has been  done, and to an extent that is obviously serious. It follows that the  Court must quash the penal order for costs made by the Commissioner  against Air New Zealand reflecting the same thinking as paragraph 377.      The Disaster    In 1977 Air New Zealand began a series of non-scheduled sightseeing  flights to the Antarctic with DC10 aircraft. The flights left and  returned to New Zealand within the day and without touching down en  route. The southernmost point of the route, at which the aircraft turned  round, was to be at about the latitude of the two scientific bases,  Scott Base (New Zealand) and McMurdo Station (United States), which lie  about two miles apart, south of Ross Island. On Ross Island there are  four volcanic mountains, the highest being Mount Erebus, about 12,450  feet. To the west of Ross Island is McMurdo Sound, about 40 miles long  by 32 miles wide at the widest point and covered by ice for most of the  year.    It was originally intended that the flight route south would be over  Ross Island at a minimum of 16,000 feet. From October 1977, with the  approval of the Civil Aviation Division, descent was permitted south of  the Island to not lower than 6000 feet, subject to certain conditions  concerning weather and other matters. However, the evidence is that the  pilots were in practice left with a discretion to diverge from these  route and height limitations in visual meteorological conditions; and  they commonly did so, flying down McMurdo Sound and at times at levels  lower than even 6000 feet. This had advantages both for sightseeing and  also for radio and radar contact with McMurdo Station. Moreover from  1978 the flight plan, recording the various waypoints, stored in the Air  New Zealand ground computer at Auckland actually showed the longitude of  the southernmost waypoint as 164 deg. 48' east, a point in the Sound  approximately 25 miles to the west of McMurdo Station.    The evidence of the member of the airline's navigation section who typed  the figures into the computer was that he must have mistakenly typed  164 deg. 48' instead of 166 deg. 48' and failed to notice the error.  Shortly before the fatal flight the navigation section became aware that  there was some error, although their evidence was that they understood it  to be only a matter of 10 minutes of longitude. In the ground computer the  entry was altered to 166 deg. 58' east, and this entry was among the many  in the flight plan handed over to the crew for that flight for typing into  the computerised device (AINS) on board the aircraft. The change was not  expressly drawn to the attention of the crew. The AINS enables the pilot  to fly automatically on the computer course ('nav' track) at such times  as he wishes.    The crash occurred at 12.50 pm on 28 November 1979. The aircraft struck  the northern slopes of Mount Erebus, only about 1500 feet above sea  level. There were no survivors. The evidence indicates that the weather  was fine but overcast and that the plane had descended below the cloud  base and was flying in clear air. The pilot, Captain Collins, had not  been to the Antarctic before, and of the other four members of the  flight crew only one, a flight engineer, had done so. The plane was on  nav track.    The Chief Inspector of Air Accidents, Mr R. Chippindale, carried out an  investigation and made a report to the Minister, dated 31 May 1980,  under reg. 16 of the Civil Aviation (Accident Investigation) Regulations  1978. It "]]]
