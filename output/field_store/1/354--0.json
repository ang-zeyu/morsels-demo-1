Petherick & Co., 33, Paternoster Row, E.C.    1890                [Illustration: MY WAGON.]          TO HER ROYAL HIGHNESS, PRINCESS LOUISE, MARCHIONESS OF LORNE,    This Volume, describing a recent tour, during which     a large portion of Her Majesty's magnificent       Dominions in South Africa were traversed,         is, by gracious permission, dedicated                with feelings of sincere                        respect.          [Illustration: Decorative]          INTRODUCTION.      The growth of the great Colonies of the British Empire is so phenomenal,  and their development is so rapid, and remarkable, that if we are to  possess a correct knowledge of their actual state, and condition, from  year to year, their current history requires to be constantly  re-written.    The writer of a decade since, is, to-day, almost obsolete. He has only  produced a current record of facts, and places, at the period he wrote.  This is especially the case with South Africa.    I have recently returned from a very interesting tour in that remarkable  country. My impressions were noted down, as they occurred, from day to  day. A summary of my observations, and of the incidents, in connection  with my journey, was the subject of a Paper I read at the opening  meeting of the present Session of the Royal Colonial Institute, on the  12th of November last. I wish it to be understood that the opinions  expressed on that occasion were my own, and that the Institute as a body  is in no way responsible for them. This Paper has formed the outline of  the volume, which--with much new matter from my note book--I now offer  to the public, in the belief, that the narrative of a traveller, simply  seeking instruction, as well as amusement, from a few months tour, while  traversing some 12,000 miles by sea, and 4,000 miles by land, through  the wonderful country in which he lately roamed, might prove of some  use, in awakening additional interest on the part of the general public,  to one of the most promising, and valuable portions of the Colonial  Empire.    In this spirit, I offer my \"Winter Tour in South Africa,\" to my  countrymen, \"at home and beyond the seas,\" in the hope that it may  receive from them, a favourable reception.    On the \"Political Situation,\" I have spoken strongly and frankly, I hope  not too much so. The result of my personal observations has convinced  me, that I have only correctly expressed the opinions, very widely  entertained by large classes of Her Majesty's subjects in South Africa.    I cannot conclude without acknowledging the aid I have derived from the  Statistical information contained in the \"Argus Annual,\" and it also  affords me much pleasure to thank Mr. James R. Boose, the Librarian of  the Royal Colonial Institute, for the assistance he has rendered me.

Lecture on Imperial Federation delivered at Cape Town       164-173          [Illustration: Decorative]    THE VOYAGE.      On the 3rd of May last, I left Southampton in the s.s. _Spartan_ for  Cape Town. This three weeks' ocean voyage has become one of the most  enjoyable it is possible to take by those who are seeking health or  pleasure on the sea. The steamers of the great companies, which carry on  so admirably the weekly communication between England and South Africa,  are so powerful, handsome, and commodious, their captains and crews are  so attentive and obliging, their food and cabin accommodation so ample  and luxurious, that it seems impossible for anyone, excepting a  confirmed grumbler, to find any reasonable fault with any of their  arrangements, where all are so good. Passengers will select the  particular vessel by which they desire to travel, rather by the  convenience of the date fixed for sailing, than from any particular  choice of the name of the steamer, either belonging to the Castle Mail  Packet Company, the Union Steamship Company, or any other line.    A sea voyage of the kind I have recently taken does not give opportunity  for much striking incident, or exciting variety.

TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES UNDER THE SEA      by    JULES VERNE            PART ONE        CHAPTER I    A SHIFTING REEF    The year 1866 was signalised by a remarkable incident, a mysterious and  puzzling phenomenon, which doubtless no one has yet forgotten.  Not to  mention rumours which agitated the maritime population and excited the  public mind, even in the interior of continents, seafaring men were  particularly excited.  Merchants, common sailors, captains of vessels,  skippers, both of Europe and America, naval officers of all countries,  and the Governments of several States on the two continents, were  deeply interested in the matter.    For some time past vessels had been met by \"an enormous thing,\" a long  object, spindle-shaped, occasionally phosphorescent, and infinitely  larger and more rapid in its movements than a whale.    The facts relating to this apparition (entered in various log-books)  agreed in most respects as to the shape of the object or creature in  question, the untiring rapidity of its movements, its surprising power  of locomotion, and the peculiar life with which it seemed endowed.  If  it was a whale, it surpassed in size all those hitherto classified in  science.  Taking into consideration the mean of observations made at  divers times--rejecting the timid estimate of those who assigned to  this object a length of two hundred feet, equally with the exaggerated  opinions which set it down as a mile in width and three in length--we  might fairly conclude that this mysterious being surpassed greatly all  dimensions admitted by the learned ones of the day, if it existed at  all.  And that it DID exist was an undeniable fact; and, with that  tendency which disposes the human mind in favour of the marvellous, we  can understand the excitement produced in the entire world by this  supernatural apparition.  As to classing it in the list of fables, the  idea was out of the question.    On the 20th of July, 1866, the steamer Governor Higginson, of the  Calcutta and Burnach Steam Navigation Company, had met this moving mass  five miles off the east coast of Australia.  Captain Baker thought at  first that he was in the presence of an unknown sandbank; he even  prepared to determine its exact position when two columns of water,  projected by the mysterious object, shot with a hissing noise a hundred  and fifty feet up into the air.  Now, unless the sandbank had been  submitted to the intermittent eruption of a geyser, the Governor  Higginson had to do neither more nor less than with an aquatic mammal,  unknown till then, which threw up from its blow-holes columns of water  mixed with air and vapour.    Similar facts were observed on the 23rd of July in the same year, in  the Pacific Ocean, by the Columbus, of the West India and Pacific Steam  Navigation Company.  But this extraordinary creature could transport  itself from one place to another with surprising velocity; as, in an  interval of three days, the Governor Higginson and the Columbus had  observed it at two different points of the chart, separated by a  distance of more than seven hundred nautical leagues.    Fifteen days later, two thousand miles farther off, the Helvetia, of  the Compagnie-Nationale, and the Shannon, of the Royal Mail Steamship  Company, sailing to windward in that portion of the Atlantic lying  between the United States and Europe, respectively signalled the  monster to each other in 42 deg. 15' N. lat. and 60 deg. 35' W. long.  In these simultaneous observations they thought themselves justified in  estimating the minimum length of the mammal at more than three hundred  and fifty feet, as the Shannon and Helvetia were of smaller dimensions  than it, though they measured three hundred feet over all.    Now the largest whales, those which frequent those parts of the sea  round the Aleutian, Kulammak, and Umgullich islands, have never  exceeded the length of sixty yards, if they attain that.    In every place of great resort the monster was the fashion.  They sang  of it in the cafes, ridiculed it in the papers, and represented it on  the stage.  All kinds of stories were circulated regarding it.  There  appeared in the papers caricatures of every gigantic and imaginary  creature, from the white whale, the terrible \"Moby Dick\" of sub-arctic  regions, to the immense kraken, whose tentacles could entangle a ship  of five hundred tons and hurry it into the abyss of the ocean.  The  legends of ancient times were even revived.    Then burst forth the unending argument between the believers and the  unbelievers in the societies of the wise and the scientific journals.  \"The question of the monster\" inflamed all minds.  Editors of  scientific journals, quarrelling with believers in the supernatural,  spilled seas of ink during this memorable campaign, some even drawing  blood; for from the sea-serpent they came to direct personalities.    During the first months of the year 1867 the question seemed buried,  never to revive, when new facts were brought before the public.  It was  then no longer a scientific problem to be solved, but a real danger  seriously to be avoided.  The question took quite another shape.  The  monster became a small island, a rock, a reef, but a reef of indefinite  and shifting proportions.    On the 5th of March, 1867, the Moravian, of the Montreal Ocean Company,  finding herself during the night in 27 deg. 30' lat. and 72 deg. 15'  long., struck on her starboard quarter a rock, marked in no chart for  that part of the sea.  Under the combined efforts of the wind and its  four hundred horse power, it was going at the rate of thirteen knots.  Had it not been for the superior strength of the hull of the Moravian,  she would have been broken by the shock and gone down with the 237  passengers she was bringing home from Canada.    The accident happened about five o'clock in the morning, as the day was  breaking.  The officers of the quarter-deck hurried to the after-part  of the vessel.  They examined the sea with the most careful attention.  They saw nothing but a strong eddy about three cables' length distant,  as if the surface had been violently agitated.  The bearings of the  place were taken exactly, and the Moravian continued its route without  apparent damage.  Had it struck on a submerged rock, or on an enormous  wreck?  They could not tell; but, on examination of the ship's bottom  when undergoing repairs, it was found that part of her keel was broken.    This fact, so grave in itself, might perhaps have been forgotten like  many others if, three weeks after, it had not been re-enacted under  similar circumstances.  But, thanks to the nationality of the victim of  the shock, thanks to the reputation of the company to which the vessel  belonged, the circumstance became extensively circulated.    The 13th of April, 1867, the sea being beautiful, the breeze  favourable, the Scotia, of the Cunard Company's line, found herself in  15 deg. 12' long. and 45 deg. 37' lat.  She was going at the speed of  thirteen knots and a half.    At seventeen minutes past four in the afternoon, whilst the passengers  were assembled at lunch in the great saloon, a slight shock was felt on  the hull of the Scotia, on her quarter, a little aft of the port-paddle.    The Scotia had not struck, but she had been struck, and seemingly by  something rather sharp and penetrating than blunt.  The shock had been  so slight that no one had been alarmed, had it not been for the shouts  of the carpenter's watch, who rushed on to the bridge, exclaiming, \"We  are sinking! we are sinking!\"  At first the passengers were much  frightened, but Captain Anderson hastened to reassure them.  The danger  could not be imminent.  The Scotia, divided into seven compartments by  strong partitions, could brave with impunity any leak.  Captain  Anderson went down immediately into the hold.  He found that the sea  was pouring into the fifth compartment; and the rapidity of the influx  proved that the force of the water was considerable.  Fortunately this  compartment did not hold the boilers, or the fires would have been  immediately extinguished.  Captain Anderson ordered the engines to be  stopped at once, and one of the men went down to ascertain the extent  of the injury.  Some minutes afterwards they discovered the existence  of a large hole, two yards in diameter, in the ship's bottom.  Such a  leak could not be stopped; and the Scotia, her paddles half submerged,  was obliged to continue her course.  She was then three hundred miles  from Cape Clear, and, after three days' delay, which caused great  uneasiness in Liverpool, she entered the basin of the company.    The engineers visited the Scotia, which was put in dry dock.  They  could scarcely believe it possible; at two yards and a half below  water-mark was a regular rent, in the form of an isosceles triangle.  The broken place in the iron plates was so perfectly defined that it  could not have been more neatly done by a punch.  It was clear, then,  that the instrument producing the perforation was not of a common stamp  and, after having been driven with prodigious strength, and piercing an  iron plate 1 3/8 inches thick, had withdrawn itself by a backward  motion.    Such was the last fact, which resulted in exciting once more the  torrent of public opinion.  From this moment all unlucky casualties  which could not be otherwise accounted for were put down to the monster.    Upon this imaginary creature rested the responsibility of all these  shipwrecks, which unfortunately were considerable; for of three  thousand ships whose loss was annually recorded at Lloyd's, the number  of sailing and steam-ships supposed to be totally lost, from the  absence of all news, amounted to not less than two hundred!    Now, it"]]]
