In order to make more widely known and more easily accessible to American  students the results of important researches on the Maya hieroglyphs,  printed in the German language, the Peabody Museum Committee on Central  American Research proposes to publish translations of certain papers  which are not too lengthy or too extensively illustrated. The present  paper by one of the most distinguished scholars in this field is the  first of the series.                                             F. W. PUTNAM.  Harvard University             September, 1904.          PREFACE.      Since the first edition of this pamphlet appeared in the year 1897,  investigation in this department of science has made such marked  progress, notwithstanding the slight amount of material, that a revision  has now become desirable. It can be readily understood, that a new  science, an investigation on virgin soil, such as the Maya study is,  makes more rapid progress and develops more quickly than one pertaining  to some old, much explored territory.    In addition to numerous separate treatises, special mention should be  made of Ernst Foerstemann's commentaries on the three Maya manuscripts  (Kommentar zur Mayahandschrift der Koeniglichen oeffentlichen Bibliothek zu  Dresden, Dresden 1901, Kommentar zur Madrider Mayahandschrift, Danzig  1902, and Kommentar zur Pariser Mayahandschrift, Danzig 1903) which  constitute a summary of the entire results of investigation in this field  up to the present time.    The proposal made in the first edition of this pamphlet, that the Maya  deities be designated by letters of the alphabet, has been very generally  adopted by Americanists, especially by those in the United States of  America. This circumstance, in particular, has seemed to make it  desirable to prepare for publication a new edition, improved to accord  with the present state of the science.    Warmest thanks are above all due to Mr. Bowditch, of Boston, who in the  most disinterested manner, for the good of science, has made possible the  publication of this new edition.    January, 1904.                             P. SCHELLHAS.            THE MATERIAL OF THE MANUSCRIPTS.      The three manuscripts which we possess of the ancient Maya peoples of  Central America, the Dresden (Dr.), the Madrid (Tro.-Cort.) and the Paris  (Per.) manuscripts, all contain a series of pictorial representations of  human figures, which, beyond question, should be regarded as figures of  gods. Together with these are a number of animal figures, some with human  bodies, dress and armor, which likewise have a mythologic significance.    The contents of the three manuscripts, which undoubtedly pertain to the  calendar system and to the computation of time in their relation to the  Maya pantheon and to certain religious and domestic functions, admit of  the conclusion, that these figures of gods embody the essential part of  the religious conceptions of the Maya peoples in a tolerably complete  form. For here we have the entire ritual year, the whole chronology with  its mythological relations and all accessories. In addition to this,  essentially the same figures recur in all three manuscripts. Their number  is not especially large. There are about fifteen figures of gods in human  form and about half as many in animal form. At first we were inclined to  believe that further researches would considerably increase the number of  deities, but this assumption was incorrect. After years of study of the  subject and repeated examination of the results of research, it may be  regarded as positively proved, that the number of deities represented in  the Maya manuscripts does not exceed substantially the limits mentioned  above. The principal deities are determined beyond question.    The way in which this was accomplished is strikingly simple. It amounts  essentially to that which in ordinary life we call \"memory of persons\" and  follows almost naturally from a careful study of the manuscripts. For, by  frequently looking attentively at the representations, one learns by  degrees to recognize promptly similar and familiar figures of gods, by  the characteristic impression they make as a whole, or by certain details,  even when the pictures are partly obliterated or exhibit variations, and  the same is true of the accompanying hieroglyphs. A purely inductive,  natural science-method has thus been followed, and hence this pamphlet is  devoted simply to descriptions and to the amassing of material. These  figures have been taken separately out of the manuscripts alone,  identified and described with the studious avoidance of all unreliable,  misleading accounts and of all presumptive analogies with supposedly  allied mythologies.    Whatever cannot be derived from the manuscripts themselves has been wholly  ignored. Hypotheses and deductions have been avoided as far as possible.  Only where the interpretation, or the resemblance and the relations to  kindred mythologic domains were obvious, and where the accounts agreed  beyond question, has notice been taken of the fact so that the imposed  limitations of this work should not result in one-sidedness.    Since, for the most part, the accounts of Spanish authors regarding the  mythology of the Mayas correspond only slightly or not at all with these  figures of gods, and all other conjectures respecting their significance  are very dubious, the alphabetic designation of the deities, which was  tentatively introduced in the first edition of this work, has been  preserved. This designation has proved to be practical. For the plate at  the end of this pamphlet, examples as characteristic as possible of the  individual figures of gods have been selected from the manuscripts.    It is a well known fact that we possess no definite knowledge either of  the time of the composition or of the local origin of the Maya  manuscripts. The objection might, therefore, be raised that it is a  hazardous proceeding to treat the material derived from these three  manuscripts in common, as if it were homogeneous. But these researches  themselves have proved beyond a doubt, that the mythologic import of the  manuscripts belongs to one and the same sphere of thought. Essentially  the same deities and the same mythologic ideas are, without question, to  be found in all the manuscripts.    The material of the inscriptions has been set entirely at one side,  because the style of representation contained in them, both of the  mythologic forms and of the hieroglyphs, renders comparison exceedingly  difficult. In this field especial credit is due to Foerstemann and Seler,  for the work they have done in furtherance of interpretation, and mention  should not be omitted of the generosity with which the well known  promoter of Americanist investigations, the Duke of Loubat, has presented  to the Berlin Museum of Ethnology costly originals of reliefs and  inscriptions for direct study. The representations on the reliefs from  the Maya region, it is true, give evidence of dealing with kindred  mythologic conceptions. Figures and hieroglyphs of gods, made familiar by  the manuscripts, can also be found here and there. But on the whole so  little appears in support of instituting a comparison with the  manuscripts, that it seems expedient to leave the inscriptions for  independent and special study.          I. REPRESENTATIONS OF GODS.      A. The Death-God.    [Illustration: Figs. 1-6]    God A is represented as a figure with an exposed, bony spine, truncated  nose and grinning teeth.[10-1] It is plainly to be seen that the head of  this god represents a skull and that the spine is that of a skeleton. The  pictures of the death-god are so characteristic in the Maya manuscripts  that the deity is always easily recognized. He is almost always  distinguished by the skeleton face and the bony spine. Several times in  the Dresden manuscript the death-god is pictured with large black spots  on his body and in Dr. 19b a woman with closed eyes, whose body also  displays the black spots, is sitting opposite the god. While the Aztecs  had a male and a female death-deity, in the Maya manuscripts we find the  death-deity only once represented as feminine, namely on p. 9c of the  Dresden manuscript. Moreover the Dresden manuscript contains several  different types of the death-god, having invariably the fleshless skull  and (with the exception of Dr. 9c) the visible vertebrae of the spine.  Several times (Dr. 12b and 13b) he is represented apparently with  distended abdomen. A distinguishing article of his costume is the stiff  feather collar, which is worn only by this god, his companion, the  war-god F, and by his animal symbol, the owl, which will both be  discussed farther on. His head ornament varies in the Dresden Codex; in  the first portion of the manuscript, relating in part to pregnancy and  child-birth (see the pictures of women on p. 16, et seq.), he wears on  his head several times a figure occurring very frequently just in "]]]
