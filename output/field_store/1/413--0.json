The greater number of the photographs here published  were taken by the authors themselves. Their thanks are due to M. Ernest  Leroux, of Paris, for his kind permission to reproduce a certain number  of plates from the works of M. de Morgan, illustrating his recent  discoveries in Egypt and Persia, and to Messrs. W. A. Mansell & Co., of  London, for kindly allowing them to make use of a number of photographs  issued by them.          PREFACE    The present volume contains an account of the most important additions  which have been made to our knowledge of the ancient history of Egypt  and Western Asia during the few years which have elapsed since the  publication of Prof. Maspero's _Histoire Ancienne des Peuples de  l'Orient Classique_, and includes short descriptions of the excavations  from which these results have been obtained. It is in no sense a  connected and continuous history of these countries, for that has  already been written by Prof. Maspero, but is rather intended as an  appendix or addendum to his work, briefly recapitulating and describing  the discoveries made since its appearance. On this account we  have followed a geographical rather than a chronological system of  arrangement, but at the same time the attempt has been made to suggest  to the mind of the reader the historical sequence of events.    At no period have excavations been pursued with more energy and  activity, both in Egypt and Western Asia, than at the present time, and  every season's work obliges us to modify former theories, and extends  our knowledge of periods of history which even ten years ago were  unknown to the historian. For instance, a whole chapter has been added  to Egyptian history by the discovery of the Neolithic culture of the  primitive Egyptians, while the recent excavations at Susa are revealing  a hitherto totally unsuspected epoch of proto-Elamite civilization.  Further than this, we have discovered the relics of the oldest  historical kings of Egypt, and we are now enabled to reconstitute from  material as yet unpublished the inter-relations of the early dynasties  of Babylon. Important discoveries have also been made with regard to  isolated points in the later historical periods. We have therefore  attempted to include the most important of these in our survey of recent  excavations and their results. We would again remind the reader that  Prof. Maspero's great work must be consulted for the complete history of  the period, the present volume being, not a connected history of Egypt  and Western Asia, but a description and discussion of the manner in  which recent discovery and research have added to and modified our  conceptions of ancient Egyptian and Mesopotamian civilization.

The Last Days of Ancient Egypt          EGYPT AND MESOPOTAMIA    _In the Light of Recent Excavation and Research_          CHAPTER I--THE DISCOVERY OF PREHISTORIC EGYPT    During the last ten years our conception of the beginnings of Egyptian  antiquity has profoundly altered. When Prof. Maspero published the  first volume of his great _Histoire Ancienne des Peuples des l'Orient  Classique_, in 1895, Egyptian history, properly so called, still began  with the Pyramid-builders, Sne-feru, Khufu, and Khafra (Cheops and  Chephren), and the legendary lists of earlier kings preserved at Abydos  and Sakkara were still quoted as the only source of knowledge of the  time before the IVth Dynasty. Of a prehistoric Egypt nothing was known,  beyond a few flint flakes gathered here and there upon the desert  plateaus, which might or might not tell of an age when the ancestors  of the Pyramid-builders knew only the stone tools and weapons of the  primeval savage.    Now, however, the veil which has hidden the beginnings of Egyptian  civilization from us has been lifted, and we see things, more or less,  as they actually were, unobscured by the traditions of a later day.  Until the last few years nothing of the real beginnings of history in  either Egypt or Mesopotamia had been found; legend supplied the only  material for the reconstruction of the earliest history of the oldest  civilized nations of the globe. Nor was it seriously supposed that any  relics of prehistoric Egypt or Mesopotamia ever would be found. The  antiquity of the known history of these countries already appeared  so great that nobody took into consideration the possibility of our  discovering a prehistoric Egypt or Mesopotamia; the idea was too remote  from practical work. And further, civilization in these countries had  lasted so long that it seemed more than probable that all traces  of their prehistoric age had long since been swept away. Yet the  possibility, which seemed hardly worth a moment's consideration in 1895,  is in 1905 an assured reality, at least as far as Egypt is concerned.  Prehistoric Babylonia has yet to be discovered. It is true, for example,  that at Mukay-yar, the site of ancient Ur of the Chaldees, burials  in earthenware coffins, in which the skeletons lie in the doubled-up  position characteristic of Neolithic interments, have been found; but  there is no doubt whatever that these are burials of a much later date,  belonging, quite possibly, to the Parthian period. Nothing that may  rightfully be termed prehistoric has yet been found in the Euphrates  valley, whereas in Egypt prehistoric antiquities are now almost as well  known and as well represented in our museums as are the prehistoric  antiquities of Europe and America.    With the exception of a few palasoliths from the surface of the Syrian  desert, near the Euphrates valley, not a single implement of the Age  of Stone has yet been found in Southern Mesopotamia, whereas Egypt  has yielded to us the most perfect examples of the flint-knapper's  art known, flint tools and weapons more beautiful than the finest that  Europe and America can show. The reason is not far to seek. Southern  Mesopotamia is an alluvial country, and the ancient cities, which  doubtless mark the sites of the oldest settlements in the land, are  situated in the alluvial marshy plain between the Tigris and the  Euphrates; so that all traces of the Neolithic culture of the country  would seem to have disappeared, buried deep beneath city-mounds, clay  and marsh. It is the same in the Egyptian Delta, a similar country; and  here no traces of the prehistoric culture of Egypt have been found. The  attempt to find them was made last year at Buto, which is known to be  one of the most antique centres of civilization, and probably was one of  the earliest settlements in Egypt, but without success. The infiltration  of water had made excavation impossible and had no doubt destroyed  everything belonging to the most ancient settlement. It is not going too  far to predict that exactly the same thing will be found by any explorer  who tries to discover a Neolithic stratum beneath a city-mound of  Babylonia. There is little hope that prehistoric Chaldaea will ever be  known to us. But in Egypt the conditions are different. The Delta is  like Babylonia, it is true; but in the Upper Nile valley the river flows  down with but a thin border of alluvial land on either side, through the  rocky and hilly desert, the dry Sahara, where rain falls but once in two  or three years. Antiquities buried in this soil in the most remote  ages are preserved intact as they were first interred, until the modern  investigator comes along to look for them. And it is on the desert  margin of the valley that the remains of prehistoric Egypt have been  found. That is the reason for their perfect preservation till our own  day, and why we know prehistoric Egypt so well.    The chief work of Egyptian civilization was the proper irrigation of  the alluvial soil, the turning of marsh into cultivated fields, and the  reclamation of land from the desert for the purposes of agriculture.  Owing to the rainless character of the country, the only means  of obtaining water for the crops is by irrigation, and where the  fertilizing Nile water cannot be taken by means of canals, there  cultivation ends and the desert begins. Before Egyptian civilization,  properly so called, began, the valley was a great marsh through which  the Nile found its way north to the sea. The half-savage, stone-using  ancestors of the civilized Egyptians hunted wild fowl, crocodiles,  and hippopotami in the marshy valley; but except in a few isolated  settlements on convenient mounds here and there (the forerunners of the  later villages), they did not live there. Their settlements were on  the dry desert margin, and it was here, upon low tongues of desert hill  jutting out into the plain, that they buried their dead. Their simple  shallow graves were safe from the flood, and, but for the depredations  of jackals and hyenas, here they have remained intact till"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17322"],[0,"History of Egypt, Chaldæa, Syria, Babylonia, and Assyria, Volume 2 (of 12) (#1)"],[1,"[Illustration: Spines]    [Illustration: Cover]    HISTORY OF EGYPT CHALDEA, SYRIA, BABYLONIA, AND ASSYRIA    By G.

The Great Sphinx Harmakhis has  mounted guard over its northern extremity ever since the time of the  Followers of Horus.         Illustration: Drawn by Boudier, from _La Description de       l'Egypte,_ A., vol. v. pl. 7. vignette, which is also by       Boudier, represents a man bewailing the dead, in the       attitude adopted at funerals by professional mourners of       both sexes; the right fist resting on the ground, while the       left hand scatters on the hair the dust which he has just       gathered up. The statue is in the Gizeh Museum.    Hewn out of the solid rock at the extreme margin of the  mountain-plateau, he seems to raise his head in order that he may be the  first to behold across the valley the rising of his father the Sun. Only  the general outline of the lion can now be traced in his weather-worn  body. The lower portion of the head-dress has fallen, so that the neck  appears too slender to support the weight of the head. The cannon-shot  of the fanatical Mamelukes has injured both the nose and beard, and  the red colouring which gave animation to his features has now almost  entirely disappeared. But in spite of this, even in its decay, it still  bears a commanding expression of strength and dignity. The eyes look  into the far-off distance with an intensity of deep thought, the lips  still smile, the whole face is pervaded with calmness and power. The  art that could conceive and hew this gigantic statue out of the  mountain-side, was an art in its maturity, master of itself and sure of  its effects. How many centuries were needed to bring it to this degree  of development and perfection!    [Illustration: 004.jpg THE MASTABA OF KHOMTINI IN THE NECROPOLIS OF  GIZEH]         Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a sketch by Lepsius. The       cornerstone at the top of the mastaba, at the extreme left       of the hieroglyphic frieze, had been loosened and thrown to       the ground by some explorer; the artist has restored it to       its original position.    In later times, a chapel of alabaster and rose granite was erected  alongside the god; temples were built here and there in the more  accessible places, and round these were grouped the tombs of the whole  country. The bodies of the common people, usually naked and uncoffined,  were thrust under the sand, at a depth of barely three feet from the  surface. Those of a better class rested in mean rectangular chambers,  hastily built of yellow bricks, and roofed with pointed vaulting.  No ornaments or treasures gladdened the deceased in his miserable  resting-place; a few vessels, however, of coarse pottery contained  the provisions left to nourish him during the period of his second  existence.    Some of the wealthy class had their tombs cut out of the mountain-side;  but the majority preferred an isolated tomb, a \"mastaba,\"* comprising a  chapel above ground, a shaft, and some subterranean vaults.         * \"The Arabic word 'mastaba,' plur. 'masatib,' denotes the       stone bench or platform seen in the streets of Egyptian       towns in front of each shop. A carpet is spread on the       'mastaba,' and the customer sits upon it to transact his       business, usually side by side with the seller. In the       necropolis of Saqqara, there is a temple of gigantic       proportions in the shape of a 'mastaba.'The inhabitants of       the neighbourhood call it 'Mastabat-el-Faraoun,' the seat of       Pharaoh, in the belief that anciently one of the Pharaohs       sat there to dispense justice. The Memphite tombs of the       Ancient Empire, which thickly cover the Saqqara plateau, are       more or less miniature copies of the 'Mastabat-el-       Faraoun.'Hence the name of mastabas, which has always been       given to this kind of tomb, in the necropolis of Saqqara.\"    From a distance these chapels have the appearance of truncated pyramids,  varying in size according to the fortune or taste of the owner; there  are some which measure 30 to 40 ft. in height, with a facade 160 ft.  long, and a depth from back to front of some 80 ft., while others attain  only a height of some 10 ft. upon a base of 16 ft. square.*         * The mastaba of Sabu is 175 ft. 9 in. long, by about 87 ft.       9 in. deep, but two of its sides have lost their facing;       that of Ranimait measures 171 ft. 3 in. by 84 ft. 6 in. on       the south front, and 100 ft. on the north front. On the       other hand, the mastaba of Papu is only 19 ft. 4 in. by 29       ft. long, and that of KMbiuphtah 42 ft. 4 in. by 21 ft. 8       in.    The walls slope uniformly towards one another, and usually have a smooth  surface; sometimes, however, their courses are set back one above the  other almost like steps.

Stone mastabas, on the contrary, present a regularity in the decoration  of their facings alone; in nine cases out of ten the core is built of  rough stone blocks, rudely cut into squares, cemented with gravel and  dried mud, or thrown together pell-mell without mortar of any kind. The  whole building should have been orientated according to rule, the four  sides to the four cardinal points, the greatest axis directed north and  south; but the masons seldom troubled themselves to find the true north,  and the orientation is usually incorrect.*         * Thus the axis of the tomb of Pirsenu is 17 deg. east of the       magnetic north. In some cases the divergence is only 1 deg. or       2 deg., more often it is 6 deg., 7 deg., 8 deg., or 9 deg., as can be easily       ascertained by consulting the work of Mariette.    The doors face east, sometimes north or south, but never west. One of  these is but the semblance of a door, a high narrow niche, contrived  so as to face east, and decorated with grooves framing a carefully  walled-up entrance; this was for the use of the dead, and it was  believed that the ghost entered or left it at will.
