MILTON.          PREFACE      The present book, as originally planned over seven years ago, was to be  a simplified paraphrase or restatement of the principles embodied in  Friedrich Ratzel's _Anthropo-Geographie_. The German work is difficult  reading even for Germans. To most English and American students of  geographic environment it is a closed book, a treasure-house bolted and  barred. Ratzel himself realized \"that any English form could not be a  literal translation, but must be adapted to the Anglo-Celtic and  especially to the Anglo-American mind.\" The writer undertook, with  Ratzel's approval, to make such an adapted restatement of the  principles, with a view to making them pass current where they are now  unknown. But the initial stages of the work revealed the necessity of a  radical modification of the original plan.    Ratzel performed the great service of placing anthropo-geography on a  secure scientific basis. He had his forerunners in Montesquieu,  Alexander von Humboldt, Buckle, Ritter, Kohl, Peschel and others; but he  first investigated the subject from the modern scientific point of view,  constructed his system according to the principles of evolution, and  based his conclusions on world-wide inductions, for which his  predecessors did not command the data. To this task he brought thorough  training as a naturalist, broad reading and travel, a profound and  original intellect, and amazing fertility of thought. Yet the field  which he had chosen was so vast, and its material so complex, that even  his big mental grasp could not wholly compass it. His conclusions,  therefore, are not always exhaustive or final.    Moreover, the very fecundity of his ideas often left him no time to test  the validity of his principles. He enunciates one brilliant  generalization after another. Sometimes he reveals the mind of a seer or  poet, throwing out conclusions which are highly suggestive, on the face  of them convincing, but which on examination prove untenable, or at  best must be set down as unproven or needing qualification. But these  were just the slag from the great furnace of his mind, slag not always  worthless. Brilliant and far-reaching as were his conclusions, he did  not execute a well-ordered plan. Rather he grew with his work, and his  work and its problems grew with him. He took a mountain-top view of  things, kept his eyes always on the far horizon, and in the splendid  sweep of his scientific conceptions sometimes overlooked the details  near at hand. Herein lay his greatness and his limitation.    These facts brought the writer face to face with a serious problem.  Ratzel's work needed to be tested, verified. The only solution was to go  over the whole field from the beginning, making research for the data as  from the foundation, and checking off the principles against the facts.  This was especially necessary, because it was not always obvious that  Ratzel had based his inductions on sufficiently broad data; and his  published work had been open to the just criticism of inadequate  citation of authorities. It was imperative, moreover, that any  investigation of geographic environment for the English-speaking world  should meet its public well supported both by facts and authorities,  because that public had not previously known a Ritter or a Peschel.    The writer's own investigation revealed the fact that Ratzel's  principles of anthropo-geography did not constitute a complete,  well-proportioned system. Some aspects of the subject had been developed  exhaustively, these of course the most important; but others had been  treated inadequately, others were merely a hint or an inference, and yet  others were represented by an hiatus. It became necessary, therefor, to  work up certain important themes with a thoroughness commensurate with  their significance, to reduce the scale of others, and to fill up  certain gaps with original contributions to the science. Always it was  necessary to clarify the original statement, where that was adhered to,  and to throw it into the concrete form of expression demanded by the  Anglo-Saxon mind.    One point more. The organic theory of society and state permeates the  _Anthropo-geographie_, because Ratzel formulated his principles at a  time when Herbert Spencer exercised a wide influence upon European  thought. This theory, now generally abandoned by sociologists, had to be  eliminated from any restatement of Ratzel's system. Though it was  applied in the original often in great detail, it stood there  nevertheless rather as a scaffolding around the finished edifice; and  the stability of the structure, after this scaffolding is removed shows  how extraneous to the whole it was. The theory performed, however, a  great service in impressing Ratzel's mind with the life-giving  connection between land and people.    The writer's own method of research has been to compare typical peoples  of all races and all stages of cultural development, living under  similar geographic conditions. If these peoples of different ethnic  stocks but similar environments manifested similar or related social,  economic or historical development, it was reasonable to infer that such  similarities were due to environment and not to race. Thus, by extensive  comparison, the race factor in these problems of two unknown quantities  was eliminated for certain large classes of social and historical  phenomena.    The writer, moreover, has purposely avoided definitions, formulas, and  the enunciation of hard-and-fast rules; and has refrained from any  effort to delimit the field or define the relation of this new science  of anthropo-geography to the older sciences. It is unwise to put tight  clothes on a growing child. The eventual form and scope of the science,  the definition and organization of its material must evolve gradually,  after long years and many efforts of many workers in the field. The  eternal flux of Nature runs through anthropo-geography, and warns  against precipitate or rigid conclusions. But its laws are none the less  well founded because they do not lend themselves to mathematical  finality of statement. For this reason the writer speaks of geographic  factors and influences, shuns the word geographic determinant, and  speaks with extreme caution of geographic control.    The present volume is offered to the public with a deep sense of its  inadequacy; with the realization that some of its principles may have to  be modified or their emphasis altered after wider research; but also  with the hope that this effort may make the way easier for the scholar  who shall some day write the ideal treatise on anthropo-geography.    In my work on this book I have only one person to thank, the great  master who was my teacher and friend during his life, and after his  death my inspiration.    ELLEN CHURCHILL SEMPLE.

Fisher Unwin Ltd.  Adelphi Terrace    1919                DEDICATORY LETTER TO SIR JAMES KNOTT    MY DEAR SIR JAMES,    We have travelled far since those early days when you and I, who are  of totally different tastes and temperament, first met and became  friends. I was attracted by your wide knowledge, versatile vigour of  mind, and engaging personality, which subsequent years have not  diminished. You were strenuously engaged at that time in breaking down  the weevilly traditions of a bygone age, and helping to create a new  era in the art of steamship management, and, at the same time,  studying for the Bar; and were I writing a biography of you, I would  have to include your interesting travels in distant lands in quest of  business and organizing it. That must be left for another occasion,  when the vast results to the commercial life of the country to which  you contributed may be fittingly told.    At the present time my vision recalls our joyous yachting cruises on  the Clyde, when poor Leadbitter added to the charm that stays. Perhaps  best of all were the golden days when we habitually took our week-end  strolls together by the edge of the inspiriting splendour of the blue  North Sea, strolls which are hallowed by many memories, and gave me  an opportunity of listening to your vehement flashes of human  sympathies, which are so widely known now. It is my high appreciation  of those tender gifts and of your personal worth, together with the  many acts of kindness and consideration shown to me when I have been  your guest, that gives me the desire to inscribe this book to you and  Lady Knott, and to the memory of your gallant sons, Major Leadbitter  Knott, D.S.O., who was killed while leading his battalion in a  terrific engagement in Flanders, and Captain Basil Knott, who fell so  tragically a few months previously at his brother's side.    With every sentiment of esteem,  I am, dear Sir James,  Ever yours sincerely,    WALTER RUNCIMAN.    March 1919.          PREFACE      This book has evolved from another which I had for years been urged to  write by personal friends. I had chatted occasionally about my own  voyages, related incidents concerning them and the countries and  places I had visited, the ships I had sailed in, the men I had sailed  with, and the sailors of that period. It is one thing to tell  sea-tales in a cosy room and to enjoy living again for a brief time in  the days that are gone; but it is another matter when one is asked to  put the stories into book form. Needless to say for a long time I  shrank from undertaking the task, but was ultimately prevailed upon to  do so. The book was commenced and was well advanced, and, as I could  not depict the sailors of my own period without dealing--as I thought  at the time--briefly with the race of men called buccaneers who were  really the creators of the British mercantile marine and Navy, who  lived centuries before my generation, I was obliged to deal with some  of them, such as Hawkins, Drake, Frobisher, Daimper, Alexander Selkirk  of Robinson Crusoe fame, and others who combined piracy with commerce  and sailorism. After I had written all I thought necessary about the  three former, I instinctively slipped on to Nelson as the greatest  sea personality of the beginning of the last century. I found the  subject so engrossing that I could not centre my thoughts on any  other, so determined to continue my narrative, which is not, and never  was intended to be a life of Nelson. Perhaps it may be properly termed  fragmentary thoughts and jottings concerning the life of an  extraordinary human force, written at intervals when I had leisure  from an otherwise busy life.    Even if I had thought it desirable, it was hardly possible to write  about Nelson without also dealing with Britain's great adversary and  Nelson's distracted opinion of him.    It would be futile to attempt to draw a comparison between the two  men. The one was a colossal human genius, and the other, extraordinary  in the art of his profession, was entirely without the faculty of  understanding or appreciating the distinguished man he flippantly  raged at from his quarterdeck.    But be that as it may, Nelson's terrific aversion to and explosions  against the French and Napoleon, in whose history I had been absorbed  for many years, seem to me to be the deliberate outpouring of a mind  governed by feeling rather than by knowledge as to the real cause of  the wars and of how we came to be involved and continue in them. Nor  does he ever show that he had any clear conception of the history of  Napoleon's advent as the Ruler of the People with whom we were at war.    I have given this book the title of \"Drake, Nelson and Napoleon\"  because it seemed to me necessary to bring in Drake, the prototype,  and Napoleon, the antagonist of Nelson.    Drake's influence bore fruit in what is known as the Fleet Tradition,  which culminated in the \"Nelson touch.\" No excuse is needed,  therefore, for writing a chapter which shows how little the seaman's  character has changed in essentials since that time. To-day, our  sailors have the same simple direct force which characterized the  Elizabethan seamen and those of Nelsonian times.    Of Napoleon I have written fully in my book \"The Tragedy of St.  Helena,\" and have contented myself here with pointing out how the  crass stupidity and blind prejudice of his opponents have helped  largely to bring about the world-war of our own times. I have also  endeavoured to contrast the statesmanlike attitude of Napoleon with  the short-sighted policy of England's politicians and their allies at  that time.    Having planned the book on such lines, it inevitably follows that  Nelson must occupy a larger space in it than either Drake or Napoleon,  but for that I offer no apology.    WALTER RUNCIMAN.

They discovered new lands, opened  up new avenues of commerce, and combined these legitimate forms of  enterprise with others which at this date would be regarded as rank  piracy. Since, however, they believed themselves to be the ambassadors  of God, they did everything in His name, whether it were the seizing  of Spanish treasure or the annexing of new worlds by fair means or  foul, believing quite sincerely in the sanctity of what they did with  a seriousness and faith which now appear almost comic.    For many years the authorities of the Inquisition had plundered goods  and put to death English seamen and merchants, and Spanish Philip,  when remonstrated with, shrugged his shoulders and repudiated the  responsibility by saying that he had no power over the \"Holy House.\"  Drake retaliated by taking possession of and bringing to England a  million and a half of Spanish treasure while the two countries were  not at war. It is said that when Drake laid hands on the bullion at  Panama he sent a message to the Viceroy that he must now learn not to  interfere with the properties of English subjects, and that if four  English sailors who were prisoners in Mexico were ill-treated he would  execute two thousand Spaniards and send him their heads. Drake never  wasted thought about reprisals or made frothy apologetic speeches as  to what would happen to those with whom he was at religious war if  they molested his fellow-countrymen. He met atrocity with atrocity. He  believed it to be his mission to avenge the burning of British seamen  and the Spanish and Popish attempts on the life of his virgin  sovereign. That he knew her to be an audacious flirt, an insufferable  miser, and an incurable political intriguer whose tortuous moves had  to be watched as vigilantly as Philip's assassins and English  traitors, is apparent from reliable records. His mind was saturated  with the belief in his own high destiny, as the chosen instrument to  break the Spanish power in Europe. He was insensible to fear, and knew  how to make other people fear and obey him. He was not only an  invincible crusader, but one of those rare personalities who have the  power of infusing into his comrades his own courage and enthusiasm.  The Spanish said he was \"a magician who had sold his soul to the  devil.\" The Spanish sailors, and Philip himself, together with his  nobles, were terror-stricken at the mention of his name. He was to  them an invincible dragon. Santa Cruz warned his compatriots that the  heretics \"had teeth, and could use them.\" Here is another instance,  selected from many, of the fanatical superstitions concerning Drake's  irresistible power.
