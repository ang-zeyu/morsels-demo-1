Let me show you,\"  exclaimed Grace Harlowe.    The gymnasium was full of High School girls, and a very busy and  interesting picture they made, running, leaping, vaulting, passing the  medicine ball and practising on the rings.    In one corner a class was in progress, the physical culture instructor  calling out her orders like an officer on parade.    The four girl chums had grown somewhat taller than when last seen. A rich  summer-vacation tan had browned their faces and Nora O'Malley's tip-tilted  Irish nose was dotted with freckles. All four were dressed in gymnasium  suits of dark blue and across the front of each blouse in letters of  sky-blue were the initials \"O.H.S.S.\" which stood for \"Oakdale High  School Sophomore.\" They were rather proud of these initials, perhaps  because the lettering was still too recent to have lost its novelty.    \"Never mind,\" replied Anne Pierson; \"I don't believe I shall ever learn,  it, but, thank goodness, vaulting isn't entirely necessary to human  happiness.\"    \"Thank goodness it isn't,\" observed Jessica, who never really enjoyed  gymnasium work.    \"It is to mine,\" protested Grace, glowing with exercise and enthusiasm.  \"If I couldn't do every one of these stunts I should certainly lie awake  at night grieving over it.\"    She gave a joyous laugh as she vaulted over the wooden horse as easily and  gracefully as an acrobat.    \"I'd much rather dance,\" replied Anne. \"Ever since Mrs. Gray's Christmas  party I've wanted to learn.\"    \"Why Anne,\" replied Grace, \"I had forgotten that you don't dance. I'll  give you a lesson at once. But you must first learn to waltz, then all  other dancing will be easy.\"    \"Just watch me while I show you the step,\" Grace continued.    \"Now, you try it while I count for you.\"    \"One, two, three. One, two, three. That's right. Just keep on practising,  until you are sure of yourself; then if Jessica will play for us, I'll  waltz with you.\"    \"With pleasure,\" said Jessica, \"Anne must learn to waltz. Her education in  dancing mustn't be neglected another minute.\"    Anne patiently practised the step while Jessica played a very slow waltz  on the piano and Grace counted for Anne. Then the two girls danced  together, and under Grace's guidance Anne found waltzing wasn't half as  hard as she had imagined it would be.    By this time the gymnasium was almost empty. The class in physical culture  had been dismissed, and the girls belonging to it had withdrawn to the  locker rooms to dress and go home. The four girl chums were practically  alone.    \"I do wish the rest of the basketball team would put in an appearance,\"  said Grace, as she and Anne stopped to rest. \"We need every minute we can  get for practice. The opening game is so very near, and it's really  difficult to get the gymnasium now, for the juniors seem to consider it  their especial possession. One would think they had leased it for the  season.\"    \"They are awfully mean, I think,\" said Nora O'Malley. \"They weren't at all  nice to us last year when we were freshmen and they were sophomores. Even  the dignity of being juniors doesn't seem to improve them any. They are  just as hateful as ever.\"    \"Most of the juniors are really nice girls, but it is due to Julia Crosby  that they behave so badly,\" said Jessica Bright thoughtfully, \"She leads  them, into all kinds of mischief. She is a born trouble-maker.\"    \"She is one of the rudest girls I have ever known,\" remarked Nora with  emphasis. \"How Miriam Nesbit can tolerate her is more than I can see.\"    \"Well,\" said Grace, \"it is hardly a case of toleration. Miriam seems  really fond of her.\"    \"Hush!\" said Anne, who had been silently listening to the conversation.  \"Here comes the rest of the team, and Miriam is with them.\"    Readers of the preceding volume of this series, \"GRACE HARLOWE'S PLEBE  YEAR AT HIGH SCHOOL,\" need no introduction to Grace Harlowe and her girl  chums. In that volume was narrated the race for the freshman prize, so  generously offered each year by Mrs. Gray, sponsor of the freshman class,  and the efforts of Miriam Nesbit aided by the disagreeable teacher of  algebra, Miss Leece, to ruin the career of Anne Pierson, the brightest  pupil of Oakdale High School. Through the loyalty and cleverness of Grace  and her friends, the plot was brought to light and Anne was vindicated.    Many and varied were the experiences which fell to the lot of the High  School girls. The encounter with an impostor, masquerading as Mrs. Gray's  nephew, Tom Gray, the escape from wolves in Upton Woods, and Mrs. Gray's  Christmas ball proved exciting additions to the routine of school work.    The contest between Grace and Miriam Nesbit for the basketball captaincy,  resulting in Grace's subsequent election, was also one of the interesting  features of the freshman year.    The beginning of the sophomore year found Miriam Nesbit in a most  unpleasant frame of mind toward Grace and her friends. The loss of the  basketball captaincy had been a severe blow to Miriam's pride, and she  could not forgive Grace her popularity.    As she walked across the gymnasium followed by the other members of the  team, her face wore a sullen expression which deepened as her eyes rested  upon Grace, and she nodded very stiffly to the young captain. Grace, fully  aware of the coldness of Miriam's salutation, returned it as courteously  as though Miriam had been one of her particular friends. Long before this  Grace had made up her mind to treat Miriam as though nothing disagreeable  had ever happened. There was no use in holding a grudge.    \"If Miriam once realizes that we are willing to overlook some things  which happened last year,\" Grace had confided to Anne, \"perhaps her better  self will come to the surface. I am sure she has a better self, only she  has never given it a chance to develop.\"    Anne did not feel quite so positive as to the existence of Miriam's better  self, but agreed with Grace because she adored her.    The entire team having assembled, Grace lost no time in assigning the  players to their various positions.    \"Miriam will you play one of the forwards?\" she asked.    \"Who is going to play center?\" queried Miriam ignoring Grace's question.    \"Why the girls have asked me to play,\" replied Grace.    \"If I cannot play center,\" announced Miriam shrugging her shoulders, \"I  shall play nothing.\"    A sudden silence fell upon the group of girls, who, amazed at Miriam's  rudeness, awaited Grace's answer.    Stifling her desire to retort sharply, Grace said? \"Why Miriam, I didn't  know you felt that way about it. Certainly you may play center if you wish  to. I am sure I don't wish to seem selfish.\"    This was too much for Nora O'Malley, who deeply resented Miriam's attitude  toward Grace.    \"We want our captain for center,\" she said. \"Don't we, girls?\"    \"Yes,\" chorused the girls.    It was a humiliating moment for proud Miriam. Grace realized this and felt  equally embarrassed at their outspoken preference.    Then Miriam said with a contemptuous laugh, \"Really, Miss Harlowe, I  congratulate you upon your loyal support. It is a good thing to have  friends at court. However, it is immaterial to me what position I play,  for I am not particularly enthusiastic over basketball. The juniors are  sure to win at any rate.\"    A flush mounted to Grace's cheeks at Miriam's insulting words. Controlling  her anger, she said quietly:    \"Very well, I will play center.\" Then she rapidly named the other players.    This last formality having been disposed of, the team lined up for  practice. Soon the game was at its height. Miriam in the excitement of the  play, forgot her recently avowed indifference toward basketball and went  to work with all the skill and activity she possessed.    The basketball team, during its infancy in the freshman class had given  splendid promise of future fame. Grace felt proud of her players as she  stopped for a moment to watch their agile movements and spirited work.  Surely, the juniors would have to look out for their laurels this year.  Her blood quickened at thought, of the coming contests which were to take  place during the course of the winter between the two class teams.

The Hon. the Minister of Health, Wellington.    SIR,--    The Committee of the Board of Health appointed by you to inquire into  and report upon the subject of venereal diseases in New Zealand have the  honour to submit herewith their report.          PART I.--INTRODUCTORY AND HISTORICAL.      SECTION 1.--ORIGIN AND SCOPE OF INQUIRY.    A perusal of departmental files reveals that many persons and bodies  have during recent times urged upon the Government the desirability of  setting up a Committee or Commission of Inquiry to go into this subject.  The appointment of the present Committee, however, arose out of a  suggestion forwarded to the Chairman of the Board of Health, under date  of the 20th June, 1922, from the Council of the New Zealand Branch of  the British Medical Association. The Board of Health duly considered the  representations of the Association and passed a resolution recommending  the Minister to set up a committee to gather data and to make  recommendations as to the best means of preventing and combating  venereal diseases. The proposal thereafter took concrete form, following  the receipt by the members of this Committee of the under-quoted letter,  dated 13th July, 1922, sent out under your direction by the Secretary of  the Board of Health:--         \"I am directed by the Hon. the Minister of Health, Chairman of this       Board, to inform you that, acting upon the recommendation of the       Board, he has decided to appoint a special Committee from among the       members of the Board to conduct an inquiry into the question of       venereal diseases in New Zealand. The following members are being       asked to become members of the Committee, and the Chairman trusts       you will see your way to accept the position: Dr. Valintine, Dr.       Elliott, Lady Luke, Hon. Mr. Triggs, Sir Donald McGavin, Mr.       Fraser. The Hon. the Minister has asked the Hon. Mr. Triggs to       accept the chairmanship of the Committee.         \"I am further directed to state that the function and duty laid       upon the Committee is as follows:--         \"(1.) To inquire into and report upon the prevalence; of venereal       disease in New Zealand.         \"(2.) To inquire into and report any special reasons or causes for       the existence of venereal disease in New Zealand.         \"(3.) To advise as to the best means of combating and preventing       venereal disease in New Zealand, and especially as to the necessity       or otherwise of fresh legislation in the matter.         \"The Minister of Health is anxious that the Committee should hear       such evidence and representations on the above-mentioned matters as       may be necessary to fully inform the Committee on the items       referred to it, and with respect to which it is asked to report,       and he further suggests to the Committee that the various       organizations and persons likely to be interested should be       notified that the Committee will, at a certain place and date, in       Wellington, hear any evidence they may desire to tender.\"    The Committee regrets that owing to ill health Dr. Valintine,  Director-General of Health, was unable to act as one of its members. His  place was taken by Dr. J.P. Frengley, Deputy Director-General of Health.  Unfortunately, illness also overtook Mr. Murdoch Fraser, who has been  unable to attend the sittings of the Committee since the middle of  August. The remaining members have been present at all sittings of the  Committee, details of which are appended in the following table:--    --------------------------------+------------------------------------------   Places and Dates of Sittings.
