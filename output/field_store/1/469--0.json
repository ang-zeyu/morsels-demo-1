To    MY DEAR COUSINS,    IDA AND GABRIELLE,      THIS    STORY OF A SUMMER    IS AFFECTIONATELY    Dedicated.          This little volume is in no sense a work of the imagination, but a  simple record of a pleasant summer's residence at Chappaqua, embracing  many facts and incidents heretofore unpublished, relating to one who  once occupied a large portion of the public mind.  Believing that it  may interest many who care to know more of that portion of his busy  life which was not seen by the public, but which pertained to his home  circle, the author has been persuaded to print what was written merely  for the amusement of herself and friends.

CHAPPAQUA, WESTCHESTER Co.,    _New York_, May 28, 1873    Again at dear Chappaqua, after an absence of seven months.  I have not  the heart to journalize tonight, everything seems so sad and strange.  What a year this has been--what bright anticipations, what overwhelming  sorrow!      _May 30_.    I have just returned from a long ramble over the dear old place; first  up to the new house so picturesquely placed upon a hill, and down  through the woods to the cool pine grove and the flower-garden.  Here I  found a wilderness of purple and white lilacs, longing, I thought, for  a friendly hand to gather them before they faded; dear little  bright-eyed pansies, and scarlet and crimson flowering shrubs, a  souvenir of travel in England, with sweet-scented violets striped blue  and white, transplanted from Pickie's little garden at Turtle Bay long  years ago.    [Illustration: The Side-Hill House.]    Returning, I again climbed the hill, and unlocked the doors of the new  house; that house built expressly for Aunt Mary's comfort, but which  has never yet been occupied.  Every convenience of the architect's art  is to be found in this house, from the immense, airy bedroom, with its  seven windows, intended for Aunt Mary, to _a porte cochere_ to protect  her against the inclemency of the weather upon returning from a drive.  But this house, in the building of which she took so keen an interest,  she was not destined to inhabit, although with that buoyancy of mind  and tenacity to life that characterized her during her long years of  weary illness, she contemplated being carried into it during the early  days of last October, and even ordered fires to be lighted to carry off  the dampness before she tried her new room.  By much persuasion,  however, she was induced to postpone her removal from day to day; and  finally, as she grew weaker and weaker, she decided to abandon that  plan, and journey to New York while she could.  In two weeks more she  had left us forever.      _June 1_.    Our first Sunday at Chappaqua.  We have a little church for a next-door  neighbor, in which services of different sects are held on alternate  Sundays, the pulpit being hospitably open to all denominations  excepting Papists.  Three members of our little household,  however--mamma, Marguerite, and I--belong to the grand old "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18298"],[0,"Essays in Natural History and Agriculture (#1)"],[1,"IN  NATURAL HISTORY  AND  AGRICULTURE.

In the following observations I intend to offer some remarks on  the various migratory fish of the _genus Salmo_; and then some  facts and opinions which tend to show the importance of some  change in the laws which are now in force regarding them.    We have first the Salmon; which, in the Ribble, varies in weight  from five to thirty pounds. We never see the fish here before May,  and then very rarely; a few come in June, July, and August if  there are high floods in the river, and about the latter end of  September they become tolerably abundant; as the fisheries near  the mouth of the river have then ceased for the season, and the  Salmon run very freely up the river from that time to the middle  or end of December. They begin to spawn at the latter end of  October, but the greater part of those that spawn here do so in  December. I believe nearer the source of the river they are  earlier, but many fish are seen on the spawning beds in January;  and I have even seen a pair so late as March; but this last is of  very rare occurrence.    Some of the male Kipper (Kelts) come down in December and January,  but the greater part of the females remain in the river until  April, and they are occasionally seen herding with shoals of  Smolts in May. In this state they will take a worm very readily,  and are, many of them, caught with the fly in the deeps; but they  are unfit to eat, the flesh being white, loose, and insipid;  although they have lost the red dingy appearance which they had  when about to spawn, and are almost as bright as the fresh fish,  their large heads and lank bodies render it sufficiently easy to  distinguish them from fish which are only ascending the river,  even if the latter were plentiful at this season; but this is  unfortunately not the case.    Secondly, we have the Mort. I am not sure whether this fish is  what is called the Grilse in Scotland, or whether it is the Sea  Trout of that country; it is a handsome fish, weighing from one  and a half to three pounds. We first see Morts in June; from that  time to the end of September they are plentiful in favourable  seasons in the Hodder, a tributary stream of the Ribble, although  they are never very numerous in the Ribble above the mouth of that  stream. It is the opinion of the fishermen here that this is a  distinct species; my own opinion is, that it is a young Salmon,  and yet, if I were called upon to give reasons for thinking so, I  could not offer any very conclusive ones: the best I have is, that  there is no perceptible difference in the fry when going down to  sea. It may be said, How do you know that one of the three or four  varieties of Smolts which you describe further on, is not the fry  of the Mort? To this objection, if made, I say that these  varieties exist in the Wharfe, where, owing either to natural or  artificial causes, there is never either a Mort or a Sprod  (Whitling?) seen.    Thirdly, we have the Sprod, which is, I believe, synonymous with  the Whitling, Whiting, or Birling of Scotland. It is a beautiful  fish of six or eight ounces in weight, and has more the appearance  of the Salmon than the Mort; it seldom ascends the river before  July, and, like the Mort, is far more abundant in the Hodder than  in the Ribble; this fish sometimes rises pretty freely at the fly,  and when it does so, makes a very handsome addition to the  angler's basket, but at other times it is difficult to hook,  because of its shyness. It disappears in a great measure about  September.    Fourthly, we have the Pink, or Par, which is found of two or three  sizes in the Ribble; the largest are all males, and in October the  milt in them is large; they are small fishes, ranging in weight  from about one to three ounces each, and it is well remarked by  the author of that delightful book \"Wild Sports of the West,\" they  have very much the appearance of Hybrids between the Salmon and  the Trout; they rise very freely at the fly and maggot, from July  to October, and afford good sport to the angler who is satisfied  with catching small fish. I trust I shall be able in the following  pages to give some information respecting this fish which will  assist in dispelling the mystery in which its natural history has  been enveloped.    I will now mention a few of the opinions respecting the various  species of the Salmon, and also my own, when they are at variance  with the generally received ones, and give the facts and  reasonings which have induced me to form those opinions, and I  shall be very glad, if I am in error on any of these points, if  some one of my readers, better acquainted with the subject than I  am, will take the trouble to set me right. It seems to be the  opinion of many, indeed of most persons, that the Salmon spawns  from November to February, that the young fry, or Smolts, go down  to the sea in the April or May following; my own opinion is that  they stay in the river much longer. The Grilse is by many believed  to be a distinct species, whilst others stoutly maintain that it  is a young Salmon.    The testimony of the witnesses from the Severn, the Wye, the Lee,  near Cork, and the Ness (see the evidence given before the Select  Committees of the House of Commons in 1824 and 1825), would lead  one to suppose that the fish were in best season from November to  March, whilst the evidence of the witnesses from other parts of  the kingdom goes to prove that this is the very worst period for  catching them.    One maintains that each river has its own variety of fish, which  can be distinguished from the fish of any other river; another  contends that there is no such difference; a third states that  stake nets are exceedingly injurious to the breed of the fish; and  a fourth attests that stake nets only catch the fish when they are  in the best season, that neither Kelt nor fry are taken in them,  and that if they were prohibited it would only be preserving the  fish for the grampuses and seals;--in short, the evidence  regarding both their habits, and the best mode of catching them,  having in view the preservation and increase of the breed, is so  completely contradictory as to leave a doubt in the mind of every  one who reads it, and has no other means of forming an opinion. I  will endeavour to show in some instances which of the testimonies  is correct, and it will be for my readers to judge how far I  succeed, and I hope they will be so obliging as to correct any  error into which I may fall.    First.--It is my opinion that the fry of Salmon are much older  when they leave the river than seems to be generally supposed, and  that the growth of this fish is by no means so rapid as it is  considered to be by those who have written upon the subject. For  several years previous to 1816 the Salmon were unable to ascend  into the upper parts of the river Wharfe, being prevented either  by the high weirs in the lower parts, or by some other cause, and  of course there were no Smolts or Par; but in that year either the  incessant rains of that summer or rumours of the formation of an  association for the protection of fish, or some other unknown  cause, enabled some Salmon to ascend the river, thirty or forty  miles, and to spawn there. In the next spring, 1817, there were no  Smolts, but about September they began to rise at the very small  flies which the anglers use in that river--they were then a little  larger than Minnows. In the spring of 1818 there were blue Smolts,  or what are generally known as Salmon fry, which went down to the  sea in the May of that year; but these were only part of the  brood, the females only, the males remaining all that summer,  being at the period when the females went down very much smaller  than they, and what was called at the Wharfe Grey Smolt and Pinks,  or Par elsewhere.    I have shown that there were two migrations from the spawn of  1816; but this was not all--there still remained a few Smolts  through the summer of 1819, which by that time were from four to  six ounces in weight, and which are known by the anglers there as  Brambling Smolts. The blue marks on their sides are very distinct,  and the fish is a perfect Smolt, except that it is considerably  larger. It is quite different from the Whitling, or Sprod, which  is not known in the Wharfe, at least not in the upper parts of  that river, whilst the Brambling is never seen in the Ribble. [1]    The "]]]
