I.    MARCH, 1895.    No. 3.      THE CLOISTER AT MONREALE, NEAR PALERMO, SICILY.      The island of Sicily, being in form nearly an equilateral triangle, with  one side facing towards Italy, another towards Greece, and the third,  towards Africa, was a tempting field for conquest to the various nations  surrounding it. It was successively overrun by the Greeks,  Carthaginians, and Romans, and later, after the Christian era, again  successively by the Byzantines, the Moors, and the Normans. Almost all  of the architectural remains of the older periods belong to the time of  the Greeks, as neither the Carthaginians nor Romans left much to show  for their occupation of the island. With the exception of occasional  ruined examples surviving from the time of the Dorian Greeks who  colonized Sicily, most of the monuments now existing belong to the  Byzantine, Saracenic, and Romanesque periods. As would be natural to  expect, the latter influences are not clearly separable one from another  either in time or in locality. They overlap in all directions; but in  general the Byzantine, which was the earliest and most powerful element,  is found more strongly marked, and more frequently on the east coast. It  however forms the groundwork and is the main ingredient of all that  follows. The Saracenic work, which succeeds the Byzantine in date, found  a stronger foothold in the South, on the coast nearest Africa; and the  influence of the Normans appears in the North.    Every new race of masters in this frequent recurrence of conquest found  the island already occupied by a very numerous population of extremely  various origin. The newcomers could do no more than add their own forms  to those previously in use; the consequence being in every case a mixed  style, containing elements derived from every portion of the  inhabitants.    Palermo, being on the northern coast, has felt the Norman influence  strongly. Its architecture is principally Romanesque in form, with a  generous admixture of Byzantine and Saracenic motives in detail and  decoration. Exuberance of detail and wealth of color are the rule.    Under the Norman conquerors the Sicilians built as they were directed.  Their arts and their civilization were superior to those of their  masters, and the Normans were apparently willing to make use of this  superiority, and merely adapted the forms of decoration and methods of  construction which they found here in use to their own needs and  purposes. The polychromatic decoration of the buildings of this  neighborhood, such as the interiors of the Capella Palatina and the  cathedral at Monreale, ranks among the most successful, if it be not the  most successful, work of its class now in existence. It is thoroughly  Oriental in character, although applied to buildings intended for Roman  ritual. On account of the great superiority of the Moors in art and  civilization, not only to the Normans but to all the other inhabitants  at the time of the Norman conquest, in the eleventh century, many of the  buildings of this period show very little Norman influence. In fact the  Oriental character is so extreme in some instances, such as the church  of San Giovanni degli Eremiti, that there is very little to suggest that  it was Norman and intended for Norman uses.    The village of Monreale is situated on the steep mountain-side about  five miles to the west of and overlooking the city of Palermo. The  cathedral and the cloister-adjoining it on the south were both parts of  a Benedictine convent, which is now mostly in ruins. They were erected  by King William the Second, between the years 1174 and 1182, and richly  endowed by him. The plan of the cathedral is that of a basilica.    The famous cloister, with coupled columns and clusters of four in the  corners, and with a charming fountain and a separate little square of  cloisters around it, as it were, in one corner of the open space, is one  of the most interesting relics of Palermo. In arrangement it follows the  style universal in the countries bordering on the Mediterranean, that  is, consisting of a pointed arcade supported by small but elegant  columns of Corinthian design, grouped in pairs; while in the North, in  England, France, and Germany, a cloister is formed of a series of  unglazed windows.    The columns surrounding the fountain, which unfortunately cannot be seen  in the general view given in Plate XX., show the richest decoration. The  shafts are either plain, rusticated, or covered with patterns executed  in relief or mosaic.    There appears to be some doubt as to the date of this work, as the  columns have evidently been inserted since the arches which spring from  them were built. The discrepancy will be seen in Plates XVIII., XIX.,  and XX. The disproportion of the dainty columns and capitals to the  heavy arches which are entirely in keeping with the architecture of the  rest of the cathedral, but which manifestly do not fit the columns,  leads to the conclusion that the columns were a later addition, although  probably inserted soon after the other work was completed.          [Illustration: XVII. Capitals from the Cloister of Monreale, Sicily.]      XVII.    CAPITALS FROM THE CLOISTER OF MONREALE, SICILY.    The hybrid character of this work will be perfectly evident at a glance.  It plainly belongs to none of the styles of the North, but nevertheless  has a distinct character and unmistakable charm. The use of mosaic  originally placed in the channels of the shafts added greatly to the  decorative effect and airiness of these columns.          [Illustration: XVIII. Capitals from the Cloister of Monreale, Sicily.]      XVIII.    CAPITALS FROM THE CLOISTER OF MONREALE, SICILY.    A common device in most of the Romanesque cloisters for adding interest  to the long colonnade was the grouping of two columns of dissimilar  design. This plan is followed here in treating the mosaic inlay  vertically in one and horizontally in the other.          [Illustration: XIX. Capitals from the Cloister of Monreale, Sicily.]      XIX.    CAPITALS FROM THE CLOISTER OF MONREALE, SICILY.    The design of the capitals shown in this plate follows the Corinthian  model very closely.          [Illustration: XX.

The portion surrounding the fountain,  with its groups of four clustered columns, is, in many respects, the  most beautiful portion of the structure This will be taken up later.          Ravenna Capitals.      With the reign of Constantine, and the introduction of Christianity as  the acknowledged religion of Rome, Byzantine art, as such, made its  appearance. The culture of Rome was transferred to Byzantium, henceforth  to be known as Constantinople. Governed alternately by Greek and by  Persian, it had received a strong Oriental character from the Eastern  nations, and had added to the Greek subtlety and delicacy of expression  the Oriental love of detail. When converted by Constantine into New  Rome, it became a perfect treasure house of Eastern and Grecian art. The  Byzantine work, which spread over the East in the sixth, seventh, and  eighth centuries, is therefore a union of the refinement of the Greek,  the desire for color and detail of the Oriental, and the vigor of  constructional invention and conception of mass and grandeur of the  Roman. A portion of it was transplanted to Ravenna during Justinian's  reign, and there is a glorious afterglow in the Venetian splendor of the  tenth and eleventh centuries. The three great centres of Byzantine art  work are Constantinople, Ravenna, and Venice; and the three most noted  examples, the churches of Sta. Sophia, S. Vitale, and St. Mark's. Apart  from these, the cathedral at Monreale, and the Capella Palatina in  Palermo, Sicily, represent a variation from the Byzantine type affected  by Moslem design.    From the time of Constantine to that of Justinian, one hundred and fifty  years, is a period of formation. Under the reign of Justinian, Byzantine  art reached its height. Prominent among its factors is the use of  mosaic, the influence of which spread insidiously through its whole  system, until in the later work the cornices and entablatures of classic  design withered into long thin lines of moulding; projections which  disturbed the effect of color by the shadows they cast were discarded;  voussoirs disappeared under a mosaic veil; surfaces resolved themselves  into broad expanses of infinitely varied tones, bounded by narrow but  strongly contrasting bands and borders of marble. All ornament had  resolved itself into surface decoration, or as nearly that as possible.    In 539 Belisarius took Ravenna in the name of the Emperor Justinian, and  to celebrate this event Justinian decided to erect a magnificent  monument in the city. He chose to replace, by a more important  structure, the small church dedicated to S. Vitale, and built by Neon in  the reign of Theodoric.    The wonderful basilica of Sta. Sophia at Constantinople was just  completed, and the novelty of its plan and immense effect Produced by  its dome, a method of construction entirely novel in Roman architecture,  doubtless excited the admiration of the Emperor and led to the adoption  of a similar plan for S. Vitale. S. Vitale 18 by no means a copy of Sta.  Sophia, but unquestionably was strongly influenced by it.    It was founded in 540, and consecrated in 547. It is octagonal in plan,  with an inner structure of eight large piers, arranged in a circle,  connected by arches which support a pendentive dome. Following the  custom then in vogue, its interior is incrusted throughout with  elaborate mosaics in a wealth of color. The most elaborate design and  richest color is used in the apse, which was"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18854"],[0,"The Gourmet's Guide to Europe (#1)"],[1,"GOURMET'S  GUIDE TO EUROPE          Publisher's Announcement      DINNERS AND DINERS:    Where and how to Dine in London    By Lieut.-Col.

Brillat Savarin.          PREFACE      Often enough, staying in a hotel in a foreign town, I have wished to  sally forth and to dine or breakfast at the typical restaurant of the  place, should there be one. Almost invariably I have found great  difficulty in obtaining any information regarding any such restaurant.  The proprietor of the caravanserai at which one is staying may admit  vaguely that there are eating-houses in the town, but asks why one  should be anxious to seek for second-class establishments when the best  restaurant in the country is to be found under his roof. The hall-porter  has even less scruples, and stigmatises every feeding-place outside the  hotel as a den of thieves, where the stranger foolishly venturing is  certain to be poisoned and then robbed. This book is an attempt to help  the man who finds himself in such a position. His guide-book may  possibly give him the names of the restaurants, but it does no more. My  co-author and myself attempt to give him some details--what his  surroundings will be, what dishes are the specialities of the house,  what wine a wise man will order, and what bill he is likely to be asked  to pay.    Our ambition was to deal fully with the capitals of all the countries of  Europe, the great seaports, the pleasure resorts, and the \"show places.\"  The most acute critic will not be more fully aware how far we have  fallen short of our ideal than we are, and no critic can have any idea  of the difficulty of making such a book as we hope this will some day be  when complete. At all events we have always gone to the best authorities  where we had not the knowledge ourselves. Our publisher, Mr. Grant  Richards, quite entered into the idea that no advertisements of any kind  from hotels or restaurants should be allowed within the covers of the  book; and though we have asked for information from all classes of  gourmets--from ambassadors to the simple globe-trotter--we have not  listened to any man interested directly or indirectly in any hotel or  restaurant.    Hotels as places to live in we have not considered critically, and have  only mentioned them when the restaurants attached to them are the  dining-places patronised by the _bon-vivants_ of the town.    Over England we have not thrown our net, for _Dinners and Diners_ leaves  me nothing new to write of London restaurants.    In conclusion I beg, on behalf of my co-author and myself, to return  thanks to all the good fellows who have given us information; and I  would earnestly beg any travelling gourmet, who finds any change in the  restaurants we have mentioned, or who comes on treasure-trove in the  shape of some delightful dining-place we know nothing of, to take pen  and ink and write word of it to me, his humble servant, to the care of  Mr. Grant Richards, Leicester Square. So shall he benefit, in future  editions, all his own kind. We hear much of the kindness of the poor to  the poor. This is an opportunity, if not for the rich to be kind to the  rich, at least for those who deserve to be rich to benefit their  fellows.    N. Newnham-Davis.

Paris is the culinary centre of the world. All the great missionaries of  good cookery have gone forth from it, and its cuisine was, is, and ever  will be the supreme expression of one of the greatest arts in the world.  Most of the good cooks come from the south of France, most of the good  food comes from the north. They meet at Paris, and thus the Paris  cuisine, which is that of the nation and that of the civilised world, is  created.    When the Channel has been crossed you are in the country of good soups,  of good fowl, of good vegetables, of good sweets, of good wine. The  _hors-d'oeuvre_ are a Russian innovation; but since the days when  Henry IV. vowed that every peasant should have a fowl in his pot, soup  from the simplest _bouillon_ to the most lordly _consommes_ and splendid  _bisques_ has been better made in France than anywhere else in the  world. Every great cook of France has invented some particularly  delicate variety of the boiled fillet of sole, and Duglere achieved a  place amongst the immortals, by his manipulation of the brill. The soles  of the north are as good as any that ever came out of British waters;  and Paris--sending tentacles west to the waters where the sardines swim,  and south to the home of the lamprey, and tapping a thousand streams for  trout and the tiny gudgeon and crayfish--can show as noble a list of  fishes as any city in the world. The _chef de cuisine_ who could not  enumerate an hundred and fifty entrees all distinctively French, would  be no proficient in his noble profession. The British beef stands  against all the world as the meat noblest for the spit, though the  French ox which has worked its time in the fields gives the best  material for the soup-pot; and though the Welsh lamb and the English  sheep are the perfection of mutton young and mutton old, the lamb  nurtured on milk till the hour of its death, and the sheep reared on the  salt-marshes of the north, make splendid contribution to the Paris  kitchens. Veal is practically an unknown meat in London; and the calf  which has been fed on milk and yolk of egg, and which has flesh as soft  as a kiss and as white as snow, is only to be found in the Parisian  restaurants. Most of the good restaurants in London import all their  winged creatures, except game, from France; and the Surrey fowl and the  Aylesbury duck, the representatives of Great Britain, make no great show  against the champions of Gaul, though the Norfolk turkey holds his own.  A vegetable dish, served by itself and not flung into the gravy of a  joint, forms part of every French dinner, large or small; and in the  battle of the kitchen gardens the foreigners beat us nearly all along  the line, though I think that English asparagus is better than the white  monsters of Argenteuil. A truffled partridge, or the homely _Perdrix au  choux_, or the splendid _Faisan a la Financiere_ show that there are  many more ways of treating a game bird than plain roasting him; and the  peasants of the"]]]
