Perry, Perrysburg, Ohio, and made available through the Christian  Classics Ethereal Library <http://www.ccel.org>. I have eliminated  unnecessary formatting in the text, corrected some errors in  transcription, and added the dedication, tables of contents,  Prologue, and the numbers of the questions and articles, as they  appeared in the printed translation published by Benziger Brothers.  Each article is now designated by part, question number, and article  number in brackets, like this:    > SECOND ARTICLE [I, Q. 49, Art. 2]    > Whether the Supreme Good, God, Is the Cause of Evil?    In a few places, where obvious errors appeared in the Benziger  Brothers edition, I have corrected them by reference to a Latin text  of the _Summa._ These corrections are indicated by English text in  brackets. For example, in Part I, Question 45, Article 2, the first  sentence in the Benziger Brothers edition begins: \"Not only is it  impossible that anything should be created by God....\" By reference  to the Latin, \"non solum _non_ est impossibile a Deo aliquid creari\"  (emphasis added), this has been corrected to \"Not only is it [not]  impossible that anything should be created by God....\"    This electronic edition also differs from the Benziger Brothers  edition in the following details (as well as the obvious lack of the  original page numbers and headers):    * The repetitive expression \"We proceed thus to the [next] Article\"  does not appear directly below the title of each article.    * Italics are represented by underscores at the beginning and end,  _like this._ Quotations and other \"quotable\" matter, however, are  ordinarily set off by quotation marks with no underscores in this  edition, in accordance with common English usage, even where they  were set in italics with no quotation marks in the Benziger Brothers  edition. Titles of books are set off by underscores when they appear  in the text with no parentheses, but not when the books are cited in  parentheses.    * Bible chapters and verses are cited with arabic numerals separated  by colons, like this: \"Dan. 7:10\"--not like this: \"Dan. vii. 10.\"  Small roman numerals have been retained where they appear in  citations to books other than the Bible.    * Any matter that appeared in a footnote in the Benziger Brothers  edition is presented in brackets at the point in the text where the  footnote mark appeared.    * Greek words are presented in Roman transliteration.    * Paragraphs are not indented and are separated by blank lines.    * Numbered topics, set forth at the beginning of each question and  at certain other places, are ordinarily presented on a separate line  for each topic.    * Titles of questions are in all caps.    Anything else in this electronic edition that does not correspond to  the content of the Benziger Brothers edition may be regarded as a  defect in this edition and attributed to me (David McClamrock).    ________________________    CONTENTS    FIRST PART OF THE SECOND PART (QQ. 1-114)    Question    1.

And since the last end of human life is  stated to be happiness, we must consider (1) the last end in general;  (2) happiness.    Under the first head there are eight points of inquiry:    (1) Whether it belongs to man to act for an end?    (2) Whether this is proper to the rational nature?    (3) Whether a man's actions are specified by their end?    (4) Whether there is any last end of human life?    (5) Whether one man can have several last ends?    (6) Whether man ordains all to the last end?    (7) Whether all men have the same last end?    (8) Whether all other creatures concur with man in that last end?  ________________________    FIRST ARTICLE [I-II, Q. 1, Art. 1]    Whether It Belongs to Man to Act for an End?    Objection 1: It would seem that it does not belong to man to act for  an end. For a cause is naturally first. But an end, in its very name,  implies something that is last.

Williamson                          With an Introduction                                   by                      A. C. Haddon, Sc.D., F.R.S.                         With Illustrations and Map                       Macmillan and Co., Limited                    St. Martin's Street, London                                1912                PREFACE      This book is the outcome of an expedition to British New Guinea  in 1910, in which, after a short stay among the people of some of  the western Solomon Islands, including those of that old centre  of the head hunters, the Rubiana lagoon, and a preparatory and  instructive journey in New Guinea among the large villages of the  Mekeo district, I struck across country by a little known route,  via Lapeka, to Ido-Ido and on to Dilava, and thus passed by way of  further preparation through the Kuni country, and ultimately reached  the district of the Mafulu villages, of whose people very little was  known, and which was therefore the mecca of my pilgrimage.    I endeavoured to carry out the enquiries of which the book is a record  as carefully and accurately as possible; but it must be remembered  that the Mafulu people had seen very few white men, except some  of the Fathers of the Catholic Mission of the Sacred Heart, the  visits of Government officials and once or twice of a scientific  traveller having been but few and far between, and only short; that  the mission station in Mafulu (the remotest station of the mission)  had only been established five years previously; that the people  were utterly unaccustomed to the type of questioning which systematic  ethnological enquiry involves, and that necessarily there was often  the usual hesitation in giving the required information.    I cannot doubt, therefore, that future enquiries and investigations  made in the same district will bring to light errors and  misunderstandings, which even with the greatest care can hardly be  avoided in the case of a first attempt on new ground, where everything  has to be investigated and worked up from the beginning. I hope,  however, that the bulk of my notes will be found to have been correct  in substance so far as they go.    I regret that my ignorance of tropical flora and fauna has made it  impossible for me to give the names of many of the plants and animals  to which I refer.    There are many people, more than I can mention here, to whom I owe my  grateful thanks. Prior to my departure for the South Seas Dr. Haddon  took great trouble in helping and advising me, and, indeed, I doubt  whether I should have ventured upon my solitary expedition if I had  not had his stimulating encouragement.    In New Guinea I had the never-failing hospitality and kindness  of my good friend Monseigneur de Boismenu (the Bishop of the  Mission of the Sacred Heart) and the Fathers and Brothers of the  Mission. Among the latter I would specially mention Father Egedi  and Father Clauser. Father Egedi (whose name is already familiar  to students of New Guinea Ethnology) was my friend and travelling  companion during a portion of my journeyings through the Mekeo and  Kuni districts, and his Mekeo explanations proved invaluable to me  when I reached my Mafulu destination. And dear good Father Clauser  was a pillar of help in Mafulu. He placed at my disposal all his  existing knowledge concerning the people, and was my intermediary  and interpreter throughout all my enquiries. And finally, when having  at some risk prolonged my stay at Mafulu until those enquiries were  completed, I was at last compelled by the serious state of my health  to beat a retreat, and be carried down to the coast, he undertook  to do the whole of my photographing and physical measurements, and  the care and skill with which he did so are evidenced by the results  as disclosed in this book. [1] I must also add that the frontispiece  and plates 17, 67, 68, 69 and 70 are taken from previous photographs  which Father Clauser kindly placed at my disposal. My remembrance of  His Lordship the Bishop, and of the Reverend Fathers and the Brothers  of the Mission will ever be one of affectionate personal regard, and  of admiration of the spirit of heroic self-sacrifice which impels  them to submit cheerfully to the grave and constant hardships and  dangers to which their labour of love necessarily exposes them.    Since my return home Dr. Seligmann has given me immense help, advising  me upon my notes, placing material at my disposal, and afterwards  reading through a considerable portion of my manuscript. Mr. T.A. Joyce  and Mr. J. Edge Partington helped me in arranging and dealing with  the things which I had brought back to the British Museum. Dr. Keith  examined and reported upon some skulls which I had obtained,  and advised me upon my notes on physique. Dr. Stapf helped me in  matters of botanical identification; Mr. S.H. Ray has given me the  full benefit of his wide knowledge of South Pacific linguistics,  and has written the appendices to the book. And, finally, Dr. Haddon  has very kindly read through my proof sheets.    In conclusion, I would add that there is still an immense amount  of detailed work to be done among the Mafulu people, and that  the districts of the Ambo and Boboi and Oru Lopiku people, still  further back among the mountains, offer an almost virgin field for  investigation to anyone who will take the trouble to go there.
