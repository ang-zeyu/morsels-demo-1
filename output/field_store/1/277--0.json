M.A. (LOND.)  ASSISTANT TUTOR AND LATE FELLOW, CHRIST'S COLLEGE, CAMBRIDGE;  ASSISTANT EXAMINER IN CLASSICS TO THE UNIVERSITY OF LONDON.    LONDON:  MACMILLAN AND CO.  1874    [_All Rights reserved_.]           *       *       *       *       *    TO  THOSE OF HIS PUPILS  WHO HAVE READ WITH HIM  _THE ACADEMICA_,  THIS EDITION  IS AFFECTIONATELY DEDICATED  BY  THE EDITOR.           *       *       *       *       *    PREFACE.    Since the work of Davies appeared in 1725, no English scholar has edited  the _Academica_. In Germany the last edition with explanatory notes is that  of Goerenz, published in 1810. To the poverty and untrustworthiness of  Goerenz's learning Madvig's pages bear strong evidence; while the work of  Davies, though in every way far superior to that of Goerenz, is very  deficient when judged by the criticism of the present time.    This edition has grown out of a course of Intercollegiate lectures given by  me at Christ's College several years ago. I trust that the work in its  present shape will be of use to undergraduate students of the Universities,  and also to pupils and teachers alike in all schools where the  philosophical works of Cicero are studied, but especially in those where an  attempt is made to impart such instruction in the Ancient Philosophy as  will prepare the way for the completer knowledge now required in the final  Classical Examinations for Honours both at Oxford and Cambridge. My notes  have been written throughout with a practical reference to the needs of  junior students. During the last three or four years I have read the  _Academica_ with a large number of intelligent pupils, and there is  scarcely a note of mine which has not been suggested by some difficulty or  want of theirs. My plan has been, first, to embody in an Introduction such  information concerning Cicero's philosophical views and the literary  history of the _Academica_ as could not be readily got from existing books;  next, to provide a good text; then to aid the student in obtaining a higher  knowledge of Ciceronian Latinity, and lastly, to put it in his power to  learn thoroughly the philosophy with which Cicero deals.    My text may be said to be founded on that of Halm which appeared in the  edition of Cicero's philosophical works published in 1861 under the  editorship of Baiter and Halm as a continuation of Orelli's second edition  of Cicero's works, which was interrupted by the death of that editor. I  have never however allowed one of Halm's readings to pass without carefully  weighing the evidence he presents; and I have also studied all original  criticisms upon the text to which I could obtain access. The result is a  text which lies considerably nearer the MSS. than that of Halm. My  obligations other than those to Halm are sufficiently acknowledged in my  notes; the chief are to Madvig's little book entitled _Emendationes ad  Ciceronis libros Philosophicos_, published in 1825 at Copenhagen, but  never, I believe, reprinted, and to Baiter's text in the edition of  Cicero's works by himself and Kayser. In a very few passages I have  introduced emendations of my own, and that only where the conjecttires of  other Editors seemed to me to depart too widely from the MSS. If any  apology be needed for discussing, even sparingly, in the notes, questions  of textual criticism, I may say that I have done so from a conviction that  the very excellence of the texts now in use is depriving a Classical  training of a great deal of its old educational value. The judgment was  better cultivated when the student had to fight his way through bad texts  to the author's meaning and to a mastery of the Latin tongue. The  acceptance of results without a knowledge of the processes by which they  are obtained is worthless for the purposes of education, which is thus made  to rest on memory alone. I have therefore done my best to place before the  reader the arguments for and against different readings in the most  important places where the text is doubtful.    My experience as a teacher and examiner has proved to me that the students  for whom this edition is intended have a far smaller acquaintance than they  ought to have with the peculiarities and niceties of language which the  best Latin writers display. I have striven to guide them to the best  teaching of Madvig, on whose foundation every succeeding editor of Cicero  must build. His edition of the _De Finibus_ contains more valuable material  for illustrating, not merely the language, but also the subject-matter of  the _Academica_, than all the professed editions of the latter work in  existence. Yet, even after Madvig's labours, a great deal remains to be  done in pointing out what is, and what is not, Ciceronian Latin. I have  therefore added very many references from my own reading, and from other  sources. Wherever a quotation would not have been given but for its  appearance in some other work, I have pointed out the authority from whom  it was taken. I need hardly say that I do not expect or intend readers to  look out all the references given. It was necessary to provide material by  means of which the student might illustrate for himself a Latin usage, if  it were new to him, and might solve any linguistic difficulty that  occurred. Want of space has compelled me often to substitute a mere  reference for an actual quotation.    As there is no important doctrine of Ancient Philosophy which is not  touched upon somewhere in the _Academica_, it is evidently impossible for  an editor to give information which would be complete for a reader who is  studying that subject for the first time. I have therefore tried to enable  readers to find easily for themselves the information they require, and  have only dwelt in my own language upon such philosophical difficulties as  were in some special way bound up with the _Academica_. The two books  chiefly referred to in my notes are the English translation of Zeller's  _Stoics, Epicureans and Sceptics_ (whenever Zeller is quoted without any  further description this book is meant), and the _Historia Philosophiae_ of  Ritter and Preller. The _pages_, not the _sections_, of the fourth edition  of this work are quoted. These books, with Madvig's _De Finibus_, all  teachers ought to place in the hands of pupils who are studying a  philosophical work of Cicero. Students at the Universities ought to have  constantly at hand Diogenes Laertius, Stobaeus, and Sextus Empiricus, all  of which have been published in cheap and convenient forms.    Although this edition is primarily intended for junior students, it is  hoped that it may not be without interest for maturer scholars, as bringing  together much scattered information illustrative of the _Academica_, which  was before difficult of access. The present work will, I hope, prepare the  way for an exhaustive edition either from my own or some more competent  hand. It must be regarded as an experiment, for no English scholar of  recent times has treated any portion of Cicero's philosophical works with  quite the purpose which I have kept in view and have explained above.  Should this attempt meet with favour, I propose to edit after the same plan  some others of the less known and less edited portions of Cicero's  writings.    In dealing with a subject so unusually difficult and so rarely edited I  cannot hope to have escaped errors, but after submitting my views to  repeated revision during four years, it seems better to publish them than  to withhold from students help they so greatly need. Moreover, it is a  great gain, even at the cost of some errors, to throw off that intellectual  disease of over-fastidiousness which is so prevalent in this University,  and causes more than anything else the unproductiveness of English  scholarship as compared with that of Germany,    I have only to add that I shall be thankful for notices of errors and  omissions from any who are interested in the subject.

Wells-Barnett          PREFACE      The greater part of what is contained in these pages was published in the  _New York Age_ June 25, 1892, in explanation of the editorial which the  Memphis whites considered sufficiently infamous to justify the destruction  of my paper, the _Free Speech_.    Since the appearance of that statement, requests have come from all parts  of the country that \"Exiled\" (the name under which it then appeared) be  issued in pamphlet form. Some donations were made, but not enough for that  purpose. The noble effort of the ladies of New York and Brooklyn Oct. 5  have enabled me to comply with this request and give the world a true,  unvarnished account of the causes of lynch law in the South.    This statement is not a shield for the despoiler of virtue, nor altogether  a defense for the poor blind Afro-American Sampsons who suffer themselves  to be betrayed by white Delilahs. It is a contribution to truth, an array  of facts, the perusal of which it is hoped will stimulate this great  American Republic to demand that justice be done though the heavens fall.    It is with no pleasure I have dipped my hands in the corruption here  exposed. Somebody must show that the Afro-American race is more sinned  against than sinning, and it seems to have fallen upon me to do so. The  awful death-roll that Judge Lynch is calling every week is appalling, not  only because of the lives it takes, the rank cruelty and outrage to the  victims, but because of the prejudice it fosters and the stain it places  against the good name of a weak race.    The Afro-American is not a bestial race. If this work can contribute in  any way toward proving this, and at the same time arouse the conscience of  the American people to a demand for justice to every citizen, and  punishment by law for the lawless, I shall feel I have done my race a  service. Other considerations are of minor importance.    IDA B. WELLS  _New York City_, Oct. 26, 1892          To the Afro-American women of New York and Brooklyn, whose race love,  earnest zeal and unselfish effort at Lyric Hall, in the City of New York,  on the night of October 5, 1892--made possible its publication, this  pamphlet is gratefully dedicated by the author.          HON. FRED. DOUGLASS'S LETTER      _Dear Miss Wells:_    Let me give you thanks for your faithful paper on the lynch abomination  now generally practiced against colored people in the South. There has  been no word equal to it in convincing power. I have spoken, but my word  is feeble in comparison. You give us what you know and testify from actual  knowledge. You have dealt with the facts with cool, painstaking fidelity  and left those naked and uncontradicted facts to speak for themselves.    Brave woman! you have done your people and mine a service which can  neither be weighed nor measured. If American conscience were only half  alive, if the American church and clergy were only half christianized, if  American moral sensibility were not hardened by persistent infliction of  outrage and crime against colored people, a scream of horror, shame and  indignation would rise to Heaven wherever your pamphlet shall be read.    But alas! even crime has power to reproduce itself and create conditions  favorable to its own existence. It sometimes seems we are deserted by  earth and Heaven yet we must still think, speak and work, and trust in the  power of a merciful God for final deliverance.    Very truly and gratefully yours,  FREDERICK DOUGLASS  _Cedar Hill, Anacostia, D.C._, Oct. 25, 1892          1 _The_ OFFENSE      Wednesday evening May 24, 1892, the city of Memphis was filled with  excitement. Editorials in the daily papers of that date caused a meeting  to be held in the Cotton Exchange Building; a committee was sent for the  editors of the _Free Speech_ an Afro-American journal published in that  city, and the only reason the open threats of lynching that were made were  not carried out was because they could not be found. The cause of all this  commotion was the following editorial published in the _Free Speech_ May  21, 1892, the Saturday previous.      Eight negroes lynched since last issue of the _Free Speech_ one at    Little Rock, Ark., last Saturday morning where the citizens broke(?)    into the penitentiary and got their man; three near Anniston, Ala., one    near New Orleans; and three at Clarksville, Ga., the last three for    killing a white man, and five on the same old racket--the new alarm    about raping white women. The same programme of hanging, then shooting    bullets into the lifeless bodies was carried out to the letter.      Nobody in this section of the country believes the old thread-bare lie    that Negro men rape white women. If Southern white men are not careful,    they will overreach themselves and public sentiment will have a    reaction; a conclusion will then be reached which will be very damaging    to the moral reputation of their women.    The _Daily Commercial_ of Wednesday following, May 25, contained the  following leader:      Those negroes who are attempting to make the lynching of individuals of    their race a means for arousing the worst passions of their kind are    playing with a dangerous sentiment. The negroes may as well understand    that there is no mercy for the negro rapist and little patience with his    defenders. A negro organ printed in this city, in a recent issue    publishes the following atrocious paragraph: \"Nobody in this section of    the country believes the old thread-bare lie that negro men rape white    women. If Southern white men are not careful they will overreach    themselves, and public sentiment will have a reaction; and a conclusion    will be reached which will be very damaging to the moral reputation of    their women.\"      The fact that a black scoundrel is allowed to live and utter such    loathsome and repulsive calumnies is a volume of evidence as to the    wonderful patience of Southern whites. But we have had enough of it.      There are some things that the Southern white man will not tolerate, and    the obscene intimations of the foregoing have brought the writer to the    very outermost limit of public patience. We hope we have said enough.    The _Evening Scimitar_ of same date, copied the _Commercial_'s editorial  with these words of comment:      Patience under such circumstances is not a virtue. If the negroes    themselves do not apply the remedy without delay it will be the duty of    those whom he has attacked to tie the wretch who utters these calumnies    to a stake at the intersection of Main and Madison Sts., brand him in    the forehead with a hot iron and perform upon him a surgical operation    with a pair of tailor's shears.    Acting upon this advice, the leading citizens met in the Cotton Exchange  Building the same evening, and threats of lynching were freely indulged,  not by the lawless element upon which the deviltry of the South is usually  saddled--but by the leading business men, in their leading business  centre. Mr. Fleming, the business manager and owning a half interest the  _Free Speech_, had to leave town to escape the mob, and was afterwards  ordered not to return; letters and telegrams sent me in New York where I  was spending my vacation advised me that bodily harm awaited my return.  Creditors took possession of the office and sold the outfit, and the _Free  Speech_ was as if it had never been.    The editorial in question was prompted by the many inhuman and fiendish  lynchings of Afro-Americans which have recently taken place and was meant  as a warning. Eight lynched in one week and five of them charged with  rape! The thinking public will not easily believe freedom and education  more brutalizing than slavery, and the world knows that the crime of rape  was unknown during four years of civil war, when the white women of the  South were at the mercy of the race which is all at once charged with  being a bestial one.    Since my business has been destroyed and I am an exile from home because  of that editorial, the issue has been forced, and as the writer of it I  feel that the race and the public generally should have a statement of the  facts as they exist. They will serve at the same time as a defense for the  Afro-Americans Sampsons who suffer themselves to be betrayed by white  Delilahs.    The whites of Montgomery, Ala., knew J.C. Duke sounded the keynote of the  situation--which they would gladly hide from the world, when he said in  his paper, the _Herald_, five years ago: \"Why is it that white women  attract negro men now more than in former days? There was a time when such  a thing was unheard of. There is a secret to this thing, and we greatly  suspect it is the growing appreciation of white Juliets for colored  Romeos.\" Mr. Duke, like the _Free Speech_ proprietors, was forced to leave  the city for reflecting on the \"honah\" of white women and his paper  suppressed; but the truth remains that Afro-American men do not always  rape(?) white women without their consent.    Mr. Duke, before leaving Montgomery, signed a card disclaiming any  intention of slandering Southern white women. The editor of the _Free  Speech_ has no disclaimer to enter, but asserts instead that there are  many white women in the South who would marry colored men if such an act  would not place them at once beyond the pale of society and within the  clutches of the law. The miscegnation laws of the South only operate  against the legitimate union of the races; they leave the white"]]]
