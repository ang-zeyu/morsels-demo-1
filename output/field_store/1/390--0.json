Library of  Little Masterpieces  In Forty-four Volumes    AUTOBIOGRAPHY    Edited by  GEORGE ILES    VOLUME XXXVI          PREFACE    A good play gives us in miniature a cross-section of life, heightened  by plot and characterisation, by witty and compact dialogue.  Of  course we should honour first the playwright, who has given form to  each well knit act and telling scene.  But that worthy man, perhaps at  this moment sipping his coffee at the Authors' Club, gave his drama  its form only; its substance is created by the men and women who, with  sympathy, intelligence and grace, embody with convincing power the  hero and heroine, assassin and accomplice, lover and jilt.  For the  success of many a play their writers would be quick to acknowledge a  further and initial debt, both in suggestion and criticism, to the  artists who know from experience on the boards that deeds should he  done, not talked about, that action is cardinal, with no other words  than naturally spring from action.  Players, too, not seldom remind  authors that every incident should not only be interesting in itself,  but take the play a stride forward through the entanglement and  unravelling of its plot.  It is altogether probable that the heights  to which Shakespeare rose as a dramatist were due in a measure to his  knowledge of how a comedy, or a tragedy, appears behind as well as in  front of the footlights, all in an atmosphere quite other than that  surrounding a poet at his desk.    This little volume begins with part of the life story of Joseph  Jefferson, chief of American comedians.  Then we are privileged to  read a few personal letters from Edwin Booth, the acknowledged king of  the tragic stage.  He is followed by the queen in the same dramatic  realm, Charlotte Cushman.  Next are two chapters by the first  emotional actress of her day in America, Clara Morris.  When she bows  her adieu, Sir Henry Irving comes upon the platform instead of the  stage, and in the course of his thoughtful discourse makes it plain  how he won renown both as an actor and a manager.  He is followed by  his son, Mr. Henry Brodribb Irving, clearly an heir to his father's  talents in art and in observation.  Miss Ellen Terry, long Sir Henry  Irving's leading lady, now tells us how she came to join his company,  and what she thinks of Sir Henry Irving in his principal roles.  The  succeeding word comes from Richard Mansfield, whose untimely death is  mourned by every lover of the drama.  The next pages are from the hand  of Tommaso Salvini, admittedly the greatest Othello and Samson that  ever trod the boards.  A few words, in closing, are from Adelaide  Ristori, whose Medea, Myrrha and Phaedra are among the great  traditions of the modern stage.  From first to last this little book  sheds light on the severe toil demanded for excellence on the stage,  and reveals that for the highest success of a drama, author and artist  must work hand in hand.

JOSEPH JEFFERSON    [William Winter, the dramatic critic of the New York _Tribune_, in  1894 wrote the \"Life and Art of Joseph Jefferson,\" published by the  Macmillan Company, London and New York.  He gives an account of  Jefferson's lineage, and then says:    \"In Joseph Jefferson, fourth of the line, famous as Rip Van Winkle,  and destined to be long remembered by that name in dramatic history,  there is an obvious union of the salient qualities of his ancestors.  The rustic luxuriance, manly vigour, careless and adventurous  disposition of the first Jefferson; the refined intellect, delicate  sensibility, dry humour, and gentle tenderness of the second; and the  amiable, philosophic, and drifting temperament of the third, reappear  in this descendant.  But more than any of his ancestors, and more than  most of his contemporaries, the present Jefferson is an originator in  the art of acting....  Joseph Jefferson is as distinct as Lamb among  essayists, or George Darley among lyrical poets.  No actor of the past  prefigured him, ... and no name, in the teeming annals of modern art,  has shone with a more tranquil lustre, or can be more confidently  committed to the esteem of posterity.\"    The Autobiography of Joseph Jefferson, copyright, 1889, 1890, by the  Century Company, New York, was published 1891.  From its chapters, by  permission, have been taken these pages.--ED.]        HOW I CAME TO PLAY RIP VAN WINKLE    The hope of entering the race for dramatic fame as an individual and  single attraction never came into my head until, in 1858, I acted Asa  Trenchard in \"Our American Cousin\"; but as the curtain descended the  first night on that remarkably successful play, visions of large type,  foreign countries, and increased remuneration floated before me, and I  resolved to be a star if I could.  A resolution to this effect is  easily made; its accomplishment is quite another matter.    Art has always been my sweetheart, and I have loved her for herself  alone.  I had fancied that our affection was mutual, so that when I  failed as a star, which I certainly did, I thought she had jilted me.  Not so.  I wronged her.  She only reminded me that I had taken too  great a liberty, and that if I expected to win her I must press my  suit with more patience.  Checked, but undaunted in the resolve, my  mind dwelt upon my vision, and I still indulged in day-dreams of the  future.    During these delightful reveries it came up before me that in acting  Asa Trenchard I had, for the first time in my life on the stage,  spoken a pathetic speech; and though I did not look at the audience  during the time I was acting--for that is dreadful--I felt that they  both laughed and cried.  I had before this often made my audience  smile, but never until now had I moved them to tears.  This to me  novel accomplishment was delightful, and in casting about for a new  character my mind was ever dwelling on reproducing an effect where  humour would be so closely allied to pathos that smiles and tears  should mingle with each other.  Where could I get one?  There had been  many written, and as I looked back into the dramatic history of the  past a long line of lovely ghosts loomed up before me, passing as in a  procession: Job Thornberry, Bob Tyke, Frank Ostland, Zekiel Homespun,  and a host of departed heroes \"with martial stalk went by my watch.\"  Charming fellows all, but not for me, I felt I could not do them  justice.  Besides, they were too human.  I was looking for a  myth--something intangible and impossible.  But he would not come.  Time went on, and still with no result,    During the summer of 1859 I arranged to board with my family at a  queer old Dutch farmhouse in Paradise Valley, at the foot of Pocono  Mountain, in Pennsylvania.  A ridge of hills covered with tall  hemlocks surrounds the vale, and numerous trout-streams wind through  the meadows and tumble over the rocks.  Stray farms are scattered  through the valley, and the few old Dutchmen and their families who  till the soil were born upon it; there and only there they have ever  lived.  The valley harmonised with me and our resources.  The scene  was wild, the air was fresh, and the board was cheap.  What could the  light heart and purse of a poor actor ask for more than this?
