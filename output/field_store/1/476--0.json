This book is intended for those who, though ignorant on the subject,  desire to know something about mushrooms. The first question which such  an one asks upon finding a mushroom is, \"What is its name?\" If there is  no one near to tell him, then follows the second inquiry, \"How can I  find it out for myself?\" If wild flowers were concerned, Gray's little  book, \"How the Plants Grow,\" could be used; and there is also Mrs.  Dana's book on \"The Wild Flowers,\" that has given so much pleasure. In  the case of mushrooms, however, but one answer can be returned to all  questions: \"There is no American text-book on mushrooms, there is no  manual for beginners.\"    There are many books on British fungi for students, but we want some  popular work easy to understand, with no technical expressions.    This necessity for a simple guide-book has been felt by many. Let us  give our own experience. We procured a list of works on fungi, and  looked for some volume not too deep for our comprehension nor too costly  for our purse. Among those we found were \"Handbook for Students\"  (Taylor); \"Edible and Poisonous Fungi\" (Cooke), and a pamphlet by  Professor Peck, \"Mushrooms and Their Uses.\" This seemed to be the one  that we could comprehend most easily, and so, armed with it, and another  pamphlet by Professor Underwood, called \"Suggestions to Collectors of  Fleshy Fungi,\" which contained a simple key, we started out to make  discoveries. We afterward procured some publications of Mr. C. G. Lloyd,  which were of great assistance, and lastly a glossary published by the  Boston Mycological Society, a necessary addition to our library.    We found Professor Peck's book was confined to edible mushrooms, and it  soon became too limited to satisfy our craving for further knowledge--it  incited a longing to know something of inedible fungi.    The rest is soon told. We were advised to get either a copy of  Stevenson's \"British Fungi\" or of Massee's works. We did so, but found  them too advanced to be readily used by the unlearned. Then the idea  arose, How can we help others in their difficulties? This little book is  the answer. It will not be of use to advanced students, they will only  criticise and discover how much has been left unsaid; but the beginner  is more easily satisfied with the extent of information gained, and if a  taste for knowledge is encouraged the object of this book is attained.    This explanation will also account for the use of simple terms. We find  a tiny fungus which looks like a brownish bird's nest, with some  miniature eggs in it, or a shining white mushroom, and we are told its  name in Latin; it is described in terms meaningless to the ignorant,  we lose interest, and our attention flags. We began for pleasure and  recreation, but it became irksome and fatiguing, and the subject which  might have amused us and helped to pass many an idle hour is put aside  and abandoned. Yet this study is a most fascinating one. We all long for  pleasant subjects of thought in our leisure hours, and there can be  nothing more diverting and absorbing than the investigation of the  beautiful and familiar plants around us.    When we leave the bustling, noisy streets of a city and go into the  quiet fields and woods the contrast is very great. A walk for exercise  alone is often dull and tiresome. We cannot be assured of pleasant  companions, nor is there always a fine view or picturesque scenery to  reward us during our strolls, but there are plants to be found and  gathered, and when these fail us, then the bright-hued mushrooms may  arrest our attention. The discovery of new specimens, the learning their  names, the knowledge of their curious organizations, will all add an  interest to our lives. It will inspire us with a love of nature, and  open our eyes to many objects of which we have before been unobservant.  Besides this it obliges us to be accurate. Our descriptions must be  exact or they are of no use.    Let us imagine ourselves taking a stroll in the woods or down some shady  lane, and see what we can find there.    The golden-rod and asters adorn the roadsides, the odors of the sweet  gale and scented fern are wafted gratefully to our senses as we pass  along the lanes, and there, among the fallen leaves, at the very edge of  the woods, peers out a bright yellow mushroom, brighter from the  contrast to the dead leaves around, and then another, close by, and then  a shining white cap; further on a mouse-colored one, gray, and silky in  texture. What a contrast of colors. What are they? By what names shall  we call them?

And,  although it was still but midafternoon, Dalgard pointed the outrigger  into the promised shelter, the dip of his steering paddle swinging in  harmony with that wielded by Sssuri in the bow of their narrow,  wave-riding craft.    The two voyagers were neither of the same race nor of the same  species, yet they worked together without words, as if they had  established some bond which gave them a rapport transcending the need  for speech.    Dalgard Nordis was a son of the Colony; his kind had not originated on  this planet. He was not as tall nor as heavily built as those Terran  outlaw ancestors who had fled political enemies across the Galaxy to  establish a foothold on Astra, and there were other subtle differences  between his generation and the parent stock.    Thin and wiry, his skin was brown from the gentle toasting of the  summer sun, making the fairness of his closely cropped hair even more  noticeable. At his side was his long bow, carefully wrapped in  water-resistant flying-dragon skin, and from the belt which supported  his short breeches of tanned duocorn hide swung a two-foot blade--half  wood-knife, half sword. To the eyes of his Terran forefathers he would  have presented a barbaric picture. In his own mind he was amply clad  and armed for the man-journey which was both his duty and his  heritage to make before he took his place as a full adult in the  Council of Free Men.    In contrast to Dalgard's smooth skin, Sssuri was covered with a fluffy  pelt of rainbow-tipped gray fur. In place of the human's steel blade,  he wore one of bone, barbed and ugly, as menacing as the spear now  resting in the bottom of the outrigger. And his round eyes watched the  sea with the familiarity of one whose natural home was beneath those  same waters.    The mouth of the cove was narrow, but after they negotiated it they  found themselves in a pocket of bay, sheltered and calm, into which  trickled a lazy stream. The gray-blue of the seashore sand was only a  fringe beyond which was turf and green stuff. Sssuri's nostril flaps  expanded as he tested the warm breeze, and Dalgard was busy  cataloguing scents as they dragged their craft ashore. They could not  have found a more perfect place for a camp site.    Once the canoe was safely beached, Sssuri picked up his spear and,  without a word or backward glance, waded out into the sea,  disappearing into the depths, while his companion set about his share  of camp tasks. It was still early in the summer--too early to expect  to find ripe fruit. But Dalgard rummaged in his voyager's bag and  brought out a half-dozen crystal beads. He laid these out on a  flat-topped stone by the stream, seating himself cross-legged beside  it.    To the onlooker it would appear that the traveler was meditating. A  wide-winged living splotch of color fanned by overhead; there was a  distant yap of sound. Dalgard neither looked nor listened. But perhaps  a minute later what he awaited arrived. A hopper, its red-brown fur  sleek and gleaming in the sun, its eternal curiosity drawing it,  peered cautiously from the bushes. Dalgard made mind touch. The  hoppers did not really think--at least not on the levels where  communication was possible for the colonists--but sensations of  friendship and good will could be broadcast, primitive ideas  exchanged.    The small animal, its humanlike front pawhands dangling over its  creamy vest, came out fully into the open, black eyes flicking from  the motionless Dalgard to the bright beads on the rock. But when one  of those paws shot out to snatch the treasure, the traveler's hand was  already cupped protectingly over the hoard. Dalgard formed a mental  picture and beamed it at the twenty-inch creature before him. The  hopper's ears twitched nervously, its blunt nose wrinkled, and then it  bounded back into the brush, a weaving line of moving grass marking  its retreat.    Dalgard withdrew his hand from the beads. Through the years the Astran  colonists had come to recognize the virtues of patience. Perhaps the  mutation had begun before they left their native world. Or perhaps the  change in temperament and nature had occurred in the minds and bodies  of that determined handful of refugees as they rested in the frozen  cold sleep while their ship bore them through the wide, uncharted  reaches of deep space for centuries of Terran time. How long that  sleep had lasted the survivors had never known. But those who had  awakened on Astra were different.    And their sons and daughters, and the sons and daughters of two more  generations were warmed by a new sun, nourished by food grown in alien  soil, taught the mind contact by the amphibian mermen with whom the  space voyagers had made an early friendship--each succeeding child  more attuned to the new home, less tied to the far-off world he had  never seen or would see. The colonists were not of the same breed as  their fathers, their grandfathers, or great-grandfathers. So, with  other gifts, they had also a vast, time-consuming patience, which  could be a weapon or a tool, as they pleased--not forgetting the  instantaneous call to action which was their older heritage.    The hopper returned. On the rock beside the shining things it  coveted, it dropped dried and shriveled fruit. Dalgard's fingers  separated two of the gleaming marbles, rolled them toward the animal,  who scooped them up with a chirp of delight. But it did not leave.  Instead it peered intently at the rest of the beads. Hoppers had their  own form of intelligence, though it might not compare with that of  humans. And this one was enterprising. In the end it delivered three  more loads of fruit from its burrow and took away all the beads, both  parties well pleased with their bargains.    Sssuri splashed out of the sea with as little ado as he had entered.  On the end of his spear twisted a fish. His fur, slicked flat to his  strongly muscled body, began to dry in the air and fluff out while the  sun awoke prismatic lights on the scales which covered his hands and  feet. He dispatched the fish and cleaned it neatly, tossing the offal  back into the water, where some shadowy things arose to tear at the  unusual bounty.    \"This is not hunting ground.\" His message formed in Dalgard's mind.  \"That finned one had no fear of me.\"    \"We were right then in heading north; this is new land.\" Dalgard got  to his feet.    On either side, the cliffs, with their alternate bands of red, blue,  yellow, and white strata, walled in this pocket. They would make far  better time keeping to the sea lanes, where it was not necessary to  climb. And it was Dalgard's cherished plan to add more than just an  inch or two to the explorers' map in the Council Hall.    Each of the colony males was expected to make his man-journey of  discovery sometimes between his eighteenth and twentieth year. He went  alone or, if he formed an attachment with one of the mermen near his  own age, accompanied only by his knife brother. And from knowledge so  gained the still-small group of exiles added to and expanded their  information about their new home.    Caution was drilled into them. For they were not the first masters of  Astra, nor were they the masters now. There were the ruins left by  Those Others, the race who had populated this planet until their own  wars had completed their downfall. And the mermen, with their  traditions of slavery and dark beginnings in the experimental pens of  the older race, continued to insist that across the sea--on the  unknown western continent--Those Others still held onto the remnants  of a degenerate civilization. Thus the explorers from Homeport went  out by ones and twos and used the fauna of the land as a means of  gathering information.    Hoppers could remember yesterday only dimly, and instinct took care of  tomorrow. But what happened today sped from hopper to hopper and could  warn by mind touch both merman and human. If one of the dread  snake-devils of the interior was on the hunting trail, the hoppers  sped the warning. Their vast curiosity brought them to the fringe of  any disturbance, and they passed the reason for it along. Dalgard knew  there were a thousand eyes at his service whenever he wanted them.  There was little chance of being taken by surprise, no matter how  dangerous this journey north might be.    \"The city--\" He formed the words in his mind even as he spoke them  aloud. \"How far are we from it?\"    The merman hunched his slim shoulders in the shrug of his race. \"Three  days' travel, maybe five. And it\"--though his furred face displayed no  readable emotion, the sensation of distaste was plain--\"was one of the  accursed ones. To such we have not returned since the days of falling  fire--\"    Dalgard was well acquainted"]]]
