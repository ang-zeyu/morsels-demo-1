The school was situated in the suburbs of the popular town of  Merrifield, and was known as the Great Shirley School. It had been  endowed some hundred years ago by a rich and eccentric individual who  bore the name of Charles Shirley, but was now managed by a Board of  Governors. By the express order of the founder, the governors were  women; and very admirably did they fulfil their trust. There was no  recent improvement in education, no better methods, no sanitary  requirements which were not introduced into the Great Shirley School.  The number of pupils was limited to four hundred, one hundred of which  were foundationers and were not required to pay any fees; the remaining  three hundred paid small fees in order to be allowed to secure an  admirable and up-to-date education under the auspices of the great  school.    There came a day in early autumn, shortly after the girls had  reassembled after their summer vacation, when they streamed out of the  building in groups of twenties and thirties and forties. They stood  about and talked as girls will.    The Great Shirley School, well as it was managed, had perhaps a larger  share than many schools of those temptations which make school a  world--a world for the training either for good or evil of those who go  to it. There were the girls who attended the school in the ordinary way,  and there were the girls who were drafted on to the foundation from  lower schools. These latter were looked down upon by the least noble and  the meanest of their fellow-scholars.    There was a slight rain falling, and two or three girls standing in a  group raised their umbrellas, but they still stood beside the gates.    \"She's quite the very prettiest girl I ever saw,\" cried Alice Tennant;  \"but of course we can have nothing to do with her. She entered a week  ago. She doesn't pay any of the fees; she has no pretence to being a  lady. Oh, here she comes! Did you ever see such a face?\"    A slight, shabbily dressed little girl, with her satchel of books slung  on her arm, now appeared. She looked to right and left of her as though  she were slightly alarmed. Her face was beautiful in the truest sense of  the world; it did not at all match with the shabby, faded clothes which  she wore. She had large deep-violet eyes, jet-black hair, and a sweet,  fresh complexion. Her expression was bewitching, and when she smiled a  dimple came in her cheek.    \"Look--look!\" cried Mary Denny. \"Isn't she all that I have said?\"    \"Yes, and more. What a pity we can't know her!\" said Alice Tennant.    \"But can't we? I really don't see why we should make the poor child  miserable,\" said Mary Denny.    \"It is not to be thought of. We must worship the beautiful new star  from afar. Perhaps she will do something to raise herself into our set;  but as it is, she must go with Kate Rourke and Hannah Johnson and Clara  Sawyer, and all the rest of the foundationers.\"    \"Well, we have seen her now,\" said Mary, \"so I suppose we needn't stand  talking about her any longer. Will you come home and have tea with me,  Alice? Mother said I might ask you.\"    \"I wish I could come,\" said Alice; \"but we are expecting Kathleen.\"    \"Oh, the Irish girl! Is it really arranged that she is to come?\"    \"Yes, of course it is. She comes to-night. I have never seen her. We are  all pleased, and expect that she will be a very great acquisition.\"    \"Irish girls always are,\" said Mary. \"They're so gay and full of life,  and are so ridiculously witty. Don't you remember that time when we had  Norah Mahoney at the school? What fun that was!\"    \"But she got into terrible scrapes, and was practically dismissed,\" said  Alice. \"I only hope Kathleen won't be in that style.\"    \"But do you know anything about her? The Irish are always so terribly  poor.\"    \"She is not poor at all. She has got an uncle and aunt in Chicago, and  they are as rich as can be; and her uncle is coming to see her at  Christmas. And besides that, her father has an awfully old castle in the  south-west of Ireland. He is never troubled on account of the Land  League or anything else, and Kathleen will have lots and lots of money.  I know she is paying mother well for giving her a home while she is  being educated at the Shirley School.\"    \"I can't imagine why she comes to our school if she is so rich,\" said  Mary. \"It seems almost unfair. The Great Shirley School is not meant for  rich girls: a girl of the kind you have just described ought not to  become a member of the school.\"    \"Oh, that is all very fine; but it seems her mother was educated here,  and swore a sort of vow that when Kathleen was old enough she should  come to this school and to no other. Her mother's name is Mrs. O'Hara,  and she wrote to Miss Ravenscroft and asked if there was a vacancy for  Kathleen, and if she knew of any one who would be nice to her and with  whom she could live. Miss Ravenscroft thought of mother; she knew that  mother would like to have a boarder who would pay her well. So the whole  thing was settled; mother has been corresponding with Mrs. O'Hara, and  Kathleen comes to-day. I really can't stay another moment, Mary. I must  rush home; there are no end of things to be attended to.\"    \"All right,\" said Mary. \"I will watch for you and the beautiful Irish  heiress--\"    \"I don't know that she is an heiress.\"    \"Well, whatever she is--the bewitching Irish girl--to-morrow morning.  Ta-ta for the present.\"    Mary turned to the left, and Alice continued her walk. She walked  quickly. She was a well-made, rather pretty girl of fifteen. Her hair,  very light in colour, hung down her back. She had a determined walk and  a good carriage. As she hurried her steps she saw Ruth Craven, the  pretty foundation girl, walking in front of her. Ruth walked slowly and  as if she were tired. Once she pressed her hand to her side, and Alice,  passing her, hesitated and looked back. The face that met hers was so  appealing and loving that she could not resist saying a word.    \"Are you awfully tired, Ruth Craven?\" she said.    \"I shall get used to it,\" replied Ruth. \"I have had a cold for the last  few days. Thank you so much, Miss Tennant!\"    \"Don't thank me,\" said Alice, frowning; \"and don't say 'Miss Tennant,'  It isn't good form in our school. I hope you will be better to-morrow. I  am sure, at least, that you will like the school very much.\"    \"Thank you,\" said the girl again.    The girls parted at the next corner. When Ruth found herself alone she  paused and looked behind her. Tears rose to her eyes; she took out her  handkerchief to wipe them away. She paused as if troubled by some  thought; then her face grew bright, and she stepped along more briskly.    \"I am a coward, and I ought to be ashamed of myself,\" she thought. \"Now,  when I go in and grandfather sees me, he will think he has done quite  wrong to let me go to the Shirley School. I must not let him think that."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15868"],[0,"The Man Without a Country, and Other Tales (#1)"],[1,"and the Online Distributed Proofreading Team.

FROM THE INGHAM PAPERS.      This story was written in the summer of 1863, as a contribution, however  humble, towards the formation of a just and true national sentiment, or  sentiment of love to the nation. It was at the time when Mr.  Vallandigham had been sent across the border. It was my wish, indeed,  that the story might be printed before the autumn elections of that  year,--as my \"testimony\" regarding the principles involved in them,--but  circumstances delayed its publication till the December number of the  Atlantic appeared.    It is wholly a fiction, \"founded on fact.\" The facts on which it is  founded are these,--that Aaron Burr sailed down the Mississippi River in  1805, again in 1806, and was tried for treason in 1807. The rest, with  one exception to be noticed, is all fictitious.    It was my intention that the story should have been published with no  author's name, other than that of Captain Frederic Ingham, U.S.N.  Whether writing under his name or my own, I have taken no liberties with  history other than such as every writer of fiction is privileged to  take,--indeed, must take, if fiction is to be written at all.    The story having been once published, it passed out of my hands. From  that moment it has gradually acquired different accessories, for which I  am not responsible. Thus I have heard it said, that at one bureau of the  Navy Department they say that Nolan was pardoned, in fact, and returned  home to die. At another bureau, I am told, the answer to questions is,  that, though it is true that an officer was kept abroad all his life,  his name was not Nolan. A venerable friend of mine in Boston, who  discredits all tradition, still recollects this \"Nolan court-martial.\"  One of the most accurate of my younger friends had noticed Nolan's death  in the newspaper, but recollected \"that it was in September, and not in  August.\" A lady in Baltimore writes me, I believe in good faith, that  Nolan has two widowed sisters residing in that neighborhood. A  correspondent of the Philadelphia Despatch believed \"the article untrue,  as the United States corvette 'Levant' was lost at sea nearly three  years since, between San Francisco and San Juan.\" I may remark that this  uncertainty as to the place of her loss rather adds to the probability  of her turning up after three years in Lat. 2 deg. 11' S., Long. 131 deg. W. A  writer in the New Orleans Picayune, in a careful historical paper,  explained at length that I had been mistaken all through; that Philip  Nolan never went to sea, but to Texas; that there he was shot in battle,  March 21, 1801, and by orders from Spain every fifth man of his party  was to be shot, had they not died in prison. Fortunately, however, he  left his papers and maps, which fell into the hands of a friend of the  Picayune's correspondent. This friend proposes to publish them,--and the  public will then have, it is to be hoped, the true history of Philip  Nolan, the man without a country.    With all these continuations, however, I have nothing to do. I can only  repeat that my Philip Nolan is pure fiction. I cannot send his  scrap-book to my friend who asks for it, because I have it not to send.    I remembered, when I was collecting material for my story, that in  General Wilkinson's galimatias, which he calls his \"Memoirs,\" is  frequent reference to a business partner of his, of the name of Nolan,  who, in the very beginning of this century, was killed in Texas.  Whenever Wilkinson found himself in rather a deeper bog than usual, he  used to justify himself by saying that he could not explain such or such  a charge because \"the papers referring to it were lost when _Mr. Nolan_  was imprisoned in Texas.\" Finding this mythical character in the  mythical legends of a mythical time, I took the liberty to give him a  cousin, rather more mythical, whose adventures should be on the seas. I  had the impression that Wilkinson's friend was named Stephen,--and as  such I spoke of him in the early editions of this story. But long after  this was printed, I found that the New Orleans paper was right in saying  that the Texan hero was named Philip Nolan.    If I had forgotten him and his name, I can only say that Mr. Jefferson,  who did not forget him, abandoned him and his,--when the Spanish  Government murdered him and imprisoned his associates for life. I have  done my best to repair my fault, and to recall to memory a brave man, by  telling the story of his fate, in a book called \"Philip Nolan's  Friends.\" To the historical statements in that book the reader is  referred. That the Texan Philip Nolan played an important, though  forgotten, part in our national history, the reader will  understand,--when I say that the terror of the Spanish Government,  excited by his adventures, governed all their policy regarding Texas and  Louisiana also, till the last territory was no longer their own.    If any reader considers the invention of a cousin too great a liberty to  take in fiction, I venture to remind him that \"'Tis sixty years since\";  and that I should have the highest authority in literature even for much  greater liberties taken with annals so far removed from our time.    A Boston paper, in noticing the story of \"My Double,\" contained in  another part of this collection, said it was highly _improbable_. I have  always agreed with that critic. I confess I have the same opinion of  this story of Philip Nolan. It passes on ships which had no existence,  is vouched for by officers who never lived. Its hero is in two or three  places at the same time, under a process wholly impossible under any  conceivable administration of affairs. When my friend, Mr. W.H. Reed,  sent me from City Point, in Virginia, the record of the death of PHILIP  NOLAN, a negro from Louisiana, who died in the cause of his country in  service in a colored regiment, I felt that he had done something to  atone for the imagined guilt of the imagined namesake of his unfortunate  god-father.      E.E.H.      ROXBURY, MASS., March 20, 1886.           *       *       *       *       *    I supposed that very few casual readers of the New York Herald of August  18th observed, in an obscure corner, among the \"Deaths,\" the  announcement,--        \"NOLAN. Died, on board U.S. Corvette Levant, Lat. 2 deg. 11' S., Long.      131 deg. W., on the 11th of May, PHILIP NOLAN.\"    I happened to observe it, because I was stranded at the old  Mission-House in Mackinaw, waiting for a Lake Superior steamer which did  not choose to come, and I was devouring to the very stubble all the  current literature I could get hold of, even down to the deaths and  marriages in the Herald. My memory for names and people is good, and the  reader will see, as he goes on, that I had reason enough to remember  Philip Nolan. There are hundreds of readers who would have paused at  that announcement, if the officer of the Levant who reported it had  chosen to make it thus:--\"Died, May 11th, THE MAN WITHOUT A COUNTRY.\"  For it was as \"The Man without a Country\" that poor Philip Nolan had  generally been known by the officers who had him in charge during some  fifty years, as, indeed, by all the men who sailed under them. I dare  say there is many a man who has taken wine with him once a fortnight, in  a three years' cruise, who never knew that his name was \"Nolan,\" or  whether the poor wretch had any name at all.    There can now be no possible harm in telling this poor creature's story.  Reason enough there has been till now, ever since Madison's  administration went out in 1817, for very strict secrecy, the secrecy of  honor itself, among the gentlemen of the navy who have had Nolan in  successive charge. And certainly it speaks well for the _esprit de  corps_ of the profession, and the personal honor of its members, that to  the press this man's story has been wholly unknown,--and, I think, to  the country at large also. I have reason to think, from some  investigations I made in the Naval Archives when I was attached to the  Bureau of Construction, that every official report relating to him was  burned when Ross burned the public buildings at Washington. One of the  Tuckers, or possibly one of the Watsons, had Nolan in charge at the end  of the war; and when, on returning from his cruise, he reported at  Washington to one of the Crowninshields,--who was in the Navy Department  when he came home,--he found that the Department ignored the whole  business. Whether they really knew nothing about it or whether it was a  \"_Non mi ricordo_,\" determined on as a piece of policy, I do not know.  But this I do know, that since 1817, and possibly before, no naval  officer has mentioned Nolan in his report of a cruise.    But, as I say, there is no need for secrecy any longer. And now the poor  creature is dead, it seems to me worth while to tell a little of his  story, by way of showing young Americans of to-day what it is to be A  MAN WITHOUT A COUNTRY.           *       *       *       *       *    Philip Nolan was as fine a young officer as there was in the \"Legion of  the West,\" as the Western division of "]]]
