OUTLINE OF THE ESSAY.      The place of Hinduism--which is professed by about a hundred and ninety  millions in India--among the religions of the world, and its great  antiquity, are pointed out.    The comparative simplicity of the system contained in the Vedas, the  oldest sacred books of the Hindus, its almost entire freedom from the  use of images, its gradual deterioration in the later hymns, its gradual  multiplication of gods, the advance of sacerdotalism, and the increasing  complexity of its religious rites are set forth.    The philosophical speculation that was carried on, the different  philosophical schools, the Buddhist reaction, its conflict with  Brahmanism, its final defeat, and its influence on the victorious system  are discussed.    The religious reconstruction represented by the Puranas, their  theological character, the modern ritual, the introduction and rise of  caste, and the treatment of women are then considered.    A contrast is drawn between the leading characteristics of Hinduism and  those of Christianity, and the effect of Christian ideas on modern  Hinduism is exhibited. The history of the Brahmo Somaj under Keshub  Chunder Sen is given at some length.          THE HINDU RELIGION.    INTRODUCTION.      [Sidenote: Hinduism deserving of study.  Its antiquity.]  The system of religious belief which is generally called Hinduism is, on  many accounts, eminently deserving of study. If we desire to trace the  history of the ancient religions of the widely extended Aryan or  Indo-European race, to which we ourselves belong, we shall find in the  earlier writings of the Hindus an exhibition of it decidedly more  archaic even than that which is presented in the Homeric poems. Then,  the growth--the historical development--of Hinduism is not less worthy  of attention than its earlier phases. It has endured for upward of three  thousand years, no doubt undergoing very important changes, yet in many  things retaining its original spirit. The progress of the system has not  been lawless; and it is exceedingly instructive to note the development,  and, if possible, explain it.    We are, then, to endeavor to study Hinduism chronologically. Unless he  does so almost every man who tries to comprehend it is, at first,  overwhelmed with a feeling of utter confusion and bewilderment. Hinduism  spreads out before him as a vast river, or even what seems at first                \"a dark      Illimitable ocean, without bound,      Without dimension, where length, breadth, and height,      And time, and place are lost.\"    [Sidenote: The discussion chronological.]  But matters begin to clear up when he begins at the beginning, and notes  how one thing succeeded another. It may not be possible as yet to trace  all the windings of the stream or to show at what precise points in its  long course it was joined by such and such a tributary; yet much is  known regarding the mighty river which every intelligent man will find  it profitable to note and understand.    [Sidenote: The Christian's duty in relation to the subject.]  The Christian ought not to rest satisfied with the vague general idea  that Hinduism is a form of heathenism with which he has nothing to do,  save to help in destroying it. Let him try to realize the ideas of the  Hindu regarding God, and the soul, and sin, and salvation, and heaven,  and hell, and the many sore trials of this mortal life. He will then  certainly have a much more vivid perception of the divine origin and  transcendent importance of his own religion. Farther, he will then  extend a helping hand to his Eastern brother with far more of  sensibility and tenderness; and in proportion to the measure of his  loving sympathy will doubtless be the measure of his success. A yearning  heart will accomplish more than the most cogent argument.    [Sidenote: The purpose of the Tract.]  In this Tract we confine ourselves to the laying down of great leading  facts and principles; but these will be dwelt upon at sufficient length  to give the reader, we trust, an accurate conception of the general  character and history of Hinduism. We shall also briefly contrast the  system with Christianity.    The history of Hinduism may be divided into three great periods, each  embracing, in round numbers, about a thousand years.          I.    THE VEDAS.      [Sidenote: The most ancient writings of India.]  Regarding the earliest form of Hinduism we must draw our conceptions  from the Veda, or, to speak more accurately, the four Vedas. The most  important of these is the Rig Veda; and internal evidence proves it to  be the most ancient. It contains above a thousand hymns; the earliest of  which may date from about the year 1500 B.C. The Hindus, or, as they  call themselves, the Aryas, had by that time entered India, and were  dwelling in the north-western portion, the Panjab. The hymns, we may  say, are racy of the soil. There is no reference to the life led by the  people before they crossed the Himalaya Mountains or entered by some of  the passes of Afghanistan.    It would be very interesting if we could discover the pre-Vedic form of  the religion. Inferentially this may, to some extent, be done by  comparing the teachings of the Vedas with those contained in the books  of other branches of the great Aryan family--such as the Greeks, the  Romans, and, above all, the Iranians (ancient Persians).    The ancient Hindus were a highly gifted, energetic race; civilized to a  considerable extent; not nomadic; chiefly shepherds and herdsmen, but  also acquainted with agriculture. Commerce was not unknown; the river  Indus formed a highway to the Indian Ocean, and at least the Phenicians  availed themselves of it from perhaps the seventeenth century B.C., or  even earlier.    [Sidenote: The hymns are strongly religious.  They are a selection.  Pre-eminently sacerdotal.  Present the religious thought of the ancient Hindus.]  As soon as we begin to study the hymns of the Veda we are struck by  their strongly religious character. Tacitly assuming that the book  contains the whole of the early literature of India, many writers have  expressed themselves in strong terms regarding the primitive Hindus as  religious above all other races. But as we read on we become convinced  that these poems are a selection, rather than a collection, of the  literature; and the conviction grows that the selection has been made by  priestly hands for priestly purposes. An acute critic has affirmed that  the Vedic poems are \"pre-eminently sacerdotal, and in no sense  popular.\"[1] We can thus explain a pervading characteristic of the book  which has taken most readers by surprise. There is a want of simplicity  in the Veda. It is often most elaborate, artificial, overrefined--one  might even say, affected. How could these be the thoughts, or those the  expressions, of the imperfectly civilized shepherds of the Panjab? But  if it be only a hymn-book, with its materials arranged for liturgical  purposes, the difficulty vanishes.[2] We shall accordingly take it for  granted that the Veda presents only the religious thought of the ancient  Hindus--and not the whole of the religious thought, but only that of a  very influential portion of the race. With all the qualifications now  stated, the Veda must retain a position of high importance for all who  study Indian thought and life. The religious stamp which the compilers  of the Veda impressed so widely and so deeply has not been obliterated  in the course of thirty centuries.    [Sidenote: Their religion is Nature-worship.]  The prevailing aspect of the religion presented in the Vedic hymns may  be broadly designated as Nature-worship.    [Sidenote: Physical phenomena in India.  Their effect on the religion.]  All physical phenomena in India are invested with a grandeur which they  do not possess in northern or even southern Europe.

BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH  of  MAJOR-GENERAL SIR W. H. SLEEMAN. K.C.B.         _______________________      This distinguished officer, whose career in India extended over a  period of forty years, and whose services were highly appreciated by  three Governors-General--Viscount Hardinge, the Earl of Ellenborough,  and the Marquess of Dalhousie--evinced by their appointing him to the  most difficult and delicate duties--was the son of Philip and Mary  Sleeman, and was born at Stratton, Cornwall, 8th August, 1788. In  early years he evinced a predilection for the military profession;  and at the age of twenty-one (October, 1809), through the good  offices of the late Lord De Dunstanville, he was appointed an  Infantry Cadet in the Bengal army. Thither he proceeded as soon as  possible, and was promoted successively to the rank of Ensign, 23rd  September, 1810; Lieutenant, 16th December, 1814; Brevet-Captain,  24th April, 1824; Captain, 23rd September, 1826; Major, 1st February,  1837; Lieutenant-Colonel, 26th May, 1843; Colonel, 24th November,  1853; and obtained the rank of Major-General 28th November, 1854.    Early in his career he served in the Nepaulese war. The value of his  talents soon became known, and in 1816, when it was considered  necessary to investigate a claim to property as prize-money arising  out of that war, Lieutenant Sleeman was selected to inquire into it.  The report was accordingly made by him in February 1817, which was  designated by the Government as \"able, impartial, and satisfactory.\"    In 1820 he was appointed junior Assistant to the Agent of the  Governor-General at Saugur, and remained in the Civil Department in  the Saugur and Nerbudda territories, with the exception of absence on  sick certificate, for nearly a quarter of a century. Here he  manifested that, if he had been efficient in an inferior position, he  was also an able administrator in a superior post. He distinguished  himself so much by his activity in the suppression of the horrible  practice of Thuggism, then so prevalent, that, in 1835, he was  employed exclusively in the Thuggee Department; his appointment in  the Saugur and"]]]
