I saw it in the daylight, with the sun upon it.  There was  no wind, no rain, no lightning, no thunder, no awful or unwonted  circumstance, of any kind, to heighten its effect.  More than that:  I had come to it direct from a railway station:  it was not more  than a mile distant from the railway station; and, as I stood  outside the house, looking back upon the way I had come, I could  see the goods train running smoothly along the embankment in the  valley. I will not say that everything was utterly commonplace,  because I doubt if anything can be that, except to utterly  commonplace people--and there my vanity steps in; but, I will take  it on myself to say that anybody might see the house as I saw it,  any fine autumn morning.    The manner of my lighting on it was this.    I was travelling towards London out of the North, intending to stop  by the way, to look at the house.  My health required a temporary  residence in the country; and a friend of mine who knew that, and  who had happened to drive past the house, had written to me to  suggest it as a likely place.  I had got into the train at  midnight, and had fallen asleep, and had woke up and had sat  looking out of window at the brilliant Northern Lights in the sky,  and had fallen asleep again, and had woke up again to find the  night gone, with the usual discontented conviction on me that I  hadn't been to sleep at all;--upon which question, in the first  imbecility of that condition, I am ashamed to believe that I would  have done wager by battle with the man who sat opposite me.  That  opposite man had had, through the night--as that opposite man  always has--several legs too many, and all of them too long.  In  addition to this unreasonable conduct (which was only to be  expected of him), he had had a pencil and a pocket-book, and had  been perpetually listening and taking notes.  It had appeared to me  that these aggravating notes related to the jolts and bumps of the  carriage, and I should have resigned myself to his taking them,  under a general supposition that he was in the civil-engineering  way of life, if he had not sat staring straight over my head  whenever he listened.  He was a goggle-eyed gentleman of a  perplexed aspect, and his demeanor became unbearable.    It was a cold, dead morning (the sun not being up yet), and when I  had out-watched the paling light of the fires of the iron country,  and the curtain of heavy smoke that hung at once between me and the  stars and between me and the day, I turned to my fellow-traveller  and said:    \"I BEG your pardon, sir, but do you observe anything particular in  me?\"  For, really, he appeared to be taking down, either my  travelling-cap or my hair, with a minuteness that was a liberty.    The goggle-eyed gentleman withdrew his eyes from behind me, as if  the back of the carriage were a hundred miles off, and said, with a  lofty look of compassion for my insignificance:    \"In you, sir?--B.\"    \"B, sir?\" said I, growing warm.    \"I have nothing to do with you, sir,\" returned the gentleman; \"pray  let me listen--O.\"    He enunciated this vowel after a pause, and noted it down.    At first I was alarmed, for an Express lunatic and no communication  with the guard, is a serious position.  The thought came to my  relief that the gentleman might be what is popularly called a  Rapper: one of a sect for (some of) whom I have the highest  respect, but whom I don't believe in.  I was going to ask him the  question, when he took the bread out of my mouth.    \"You will excuse me,\" said the gentleman contemptuously, \"if I am  too much in advance of common humanity to trouble myself at all  about it.  I have passed the night--as indeed I pass the whole of  my time now--in spiritual intercourse.\"    \"O!\" said I, somewhat snappishly.    \"The conferences of the night began,\" continued the gentleman,  turning several leaves of his note-book, \"with this message:  'Evil  communications corrupt good manners.'\"    \"Sound,\" said I; \"but, absolutely new?\"    \"New from spirits,\" returned the gentleman.    I could only repeat my rather snappish \"O!\" and ask if I might be  favored with the last communication.    \"'A bird in the hand,'\" said the gentleman, reading his last entry  with great solemnity, \"'is worth two in the Bosh.'\"    \"Truly I am of the same opinion,\" said I; \"but shouldn't it be  Bush?\"    \"It came to me, Bosh,\" returned the gentleman.    The gentleman then informed me that the spirit of Socrates had  delivered this special revelation in the course of the night.  \"My  friend, I hope you are pretty well.  There are two in this railway  carriage.  How do you do?  There are seventeen thousand four  hundred and seventy-nine spirits here, but you cannot see them.  Pythagoras is here.  He is not at liberty to mention it, but hopes  you like travelling.\"  Galileo likewise had dropped in, with this  scientific intelligence.  \"I am glad to see you, amico.  Come sta?  Water will freeze when it is cold enough.  Addio!\"  In the course  of the night, also, the following phenomena had occurred.  Bishop  Butler had insisted on spelling his name, \"Bubler,\" for which  offence against orthography and good manners he had been dismissed  as out of temper.  John Milton (suspected of wilful mystification)  had repudiated the authorship of Paradise Lost, and had introduced,  as joint authors of that poem, two Unknown gentlemen, respectively  named Grungers and Scadgingtone.  And Prince Arthur, nephew of King  John of England, had described himself as tolerably comfortable in  the seventh circle, where he was learning to paint on velvet, under  the direction of Mrs. Trimmer and Mary Queen of Scots.    If this should meet the eye of the gentleman who favored me with  these disclosures, I trust he will excuse my confessing that the  sight of the rising sun, and the contemplation of the magnificent  Order of the vast Universe, made me impatient of them.  In a word,  I was so impatient of them, that I was mightily glad to get out at  the next station, and to exchange these clouds and vapors for the  free air of Heaven.    By that time it was a beautiful morning.  As I walked away among  such leaves as had already fallen from the golden, brown, and  russet trees; and as I looked around me on the wonders of Creation,  and thought of the steady, unchanging, and harmonious laws by which  they are sustained; the gentleman's spiritual intercourse seemed to  me as poor a piece of journey-work as ever this world saw.  In  which heathen state of mind, I came within view of the house, and  stopped to examine it attentively.    It was a solitary house, standing in a sadly neglected garden: a  pretty even square of some two acres.  It was a house of about the  time of George the Second; as stiff, as cold, as formal, and in as  bad taste, as could possibly be desired by the most loyal admirer  of the whole quartet of Georges.  It was uninhabited, but had,  within a year or two, been cheaply repaired to render it habitable;  I say cheaply, because the work had been done in a surface manner,  and was already decaying as to the paint and plaster, though the  colors were fresh.  A lop-sided board drooped over the garden wall,  announcing that it was \"to let on very reasonable terms, well  furnished.\"  It was much too closely and heavily shadowed by trees,  and, in particular, there were six tall poplars before the front  windows, which were excessively melancholy, and the site of which  had been extremely ill chosen.    It was easy to see that it was an avoided house--a house that was  shunned by the village, to which my eye was guided by a church  spire some half a mile off--a house that nobody would take.  And  the natural inference was, that it had the reputation of being a  haunted house.    No period within the four-and-twenty hours of day and night is so  solemn to me, as the early morning.  In the summer-time, I often  rise very early, and repair to my room to do a day's work before  breakfast, and I am always on those occasions deeply impressed by  the stillness and solitude around me.  Besides that there is  something awful in the being surrounded by familiar faces asleep--  in the knowledge that those who are dearest to us and to whom we  are dearest, are profoundly unconscious of us, in an impassive  state, anticipative of that mysterious condition to which we are  all tending--the stopped life, the broken threads of yesterday, the  deserted seat, the closed book, the unfinished but abandoned  occupation, all are images of Death.  The tranquillity of the hour  is the tranquillity of Death.  The color and the chill have the  same association.  Even a certain air that familiar household  objects take upon them when they first emerge from the shadows of  the night into the morning, of being newer, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18333"],[0,"The Illustrated War News, Number 15, Nov. 18, 1914 (#1)"],[1,"ILLUSTRATED WAR NEWS          EACH NUMBER           NOVEMBER 18, 1914                                 COMPLETE IN ITSELF  __________________________________________________________________________    [Illustration: THE ILLUSTRATED WAR NEWS PART 15]      PRICE SIXPENCE:                                       PUBLISHING OFFICE:    BY INLAND POST,                                          172, STRAND,    SIXPENCE HALFPENNY.

We watch and  follow their steadfastness  and valour  with thankfulness and  pride, and there is, throughout my  Empire, a fixed  determination to  secure, at whatever  sacrifice, the triumph of  our arms  and the vindication of our cause.\"      [Illustration: COMMANDER OF THE BRITISH CRUISER WHICH \"IMPRISONED\" THE  \"KOeNIGSBERG\": CAPTAIN SIDNEY R.

The  Admiralty stated  that a \"large  combined operation  by fast  cruisers against the  'Emden' has been for some time  in progress. In this  search,  which covered  an immense  area, the  British cruisers  have been  aided  by  French,  Russian,  and Japanese  vessels  working  in  harmony.  H.M.A.S. 'Melbourne' and 'Sydney' were also included in these movements.\"    Photograph by Sport and General.    At whatever sacrifice! And that promises  to be terrible. For what will be  the  sacrifice entailed  by two  years of  war--to put  its duration  at a  moderate estimate--if our casualties in life and limb alone (compared with  which our  millions of  money are  as nothing)  amounted, according  to an  official statement in  Parliament, to about 57,000 of all  ranks up to the  end of October, and it is believed  that 10,000 at least must be added for  the first ten  days of November? Of  course, by far the  larger portion of  those casualties  are \"wounded,\" of whom,  according to one of  the Netley  authorities, nine in ten at least ought to recover; while those casualties  also include \"missing,\" or \"prisoners,\" of  whom the Germans claim to have  now  more than  16,000 in  their keeping.  In the  Boer War  our \"wounded\"  amounted to 22,829, of which only 2018 proved fatal cases; while our total  casualties  for over  two and  a-half years  of warfare,  including 13,250  deaths from  disease--which, in every  campaign, is always far  more fatal  than  lead or  steel--figured up  to 52,204,  as compared  with 57,000  in  France and Belgium for only three  months, or considerably more than twice  the number of men (26,000) whom we  landed in the Crimea; while the purely  British contingent  of Wellington's \"Allies\"  at Waterloo was  returned at  something like 24,000.

A HOT SHOWER-BATH  ESTABLISHMENT INSTALLED BY AN INGENIOUS FRENCH ENGINEER.]    Much has been said of the elaborate character of the German entrenchments,  and of the British  genius for comfort developed in our  own lines, but it  is doubtful  whether anything done  by either  side in that  direction has  surpassed the chef-d'oeuvre  of an ingenious French engineer  shown in our  illustration. At one point in the  French trenches not seven hundred yards  from those of the enemy, and within  two miles of the German artillery, he  constructed an up-to-date bathing  establishment, with a heating apparatus  and  a  shower-bath! The  apartment  was  fitted  with a  stove,  benches,  clothes-pegs,  and  curtains;  and  adjoining the  salle  de  douches,  or  shower-bath room, was  fitted up a salle de coiffure.  There was even talk  of enlivening the bathing hour with music and a topical revue."]]]
