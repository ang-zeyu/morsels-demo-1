The small  cabin was thickly redolent with spicy odors and Rip sniffed  appreciatively.    \"You're sure going to be about the best smelling Terran who ever set boot  on Sargol's soil,\" his soft slur of speech ended in a rich chuckle.    Dane snorted and tried to estimate progress over one shoulder.    \"The things we have to do for Trade!\" his comment carried a hint of  present embarrassment. \"Get it well in--this stuff's supposed to hold for  hours. It'd better. According to Van those Salariki can talk your ears  right off your head and say nothing worth hearing. And we have to sit and  listen until we get a straight answer out of them. Phew!\" He shook his  head. In such close quarters the scent, pleasing as it was, was also  overpowering. \"We would have to pick a world such as this--\"    Rip's dark fingers halted their circular motion. \"Dane,\" he warned,  \"don't you go talking against this venture. We got it soft and we're  going to be credit-happy--if it works out--\"    But, perversely, Dane held to a gloomier view of the immediate future.  \"_If_,\" he repeated. \"There's a galaxy of 'ifs' in this Sargol  proposition. All very well for you to rest easy on your fins--you don't  have to run about smelling like a spice works before you can get the time  of day from one of the natives!\"    Rip put down the jar of cream. \"Different worlds, different customs,\" he  iterated the old tag of the Service. \"Be glad this one is so easy to  conform to. There are some I can think of--There,\" he ended his massage  with a stinging slap. \"You're all evenly greased. Good thing you don't  have Van's bulk to cover. It takes him a good hour to get his cream  on--even with Frank helping to spread. Your clothes ought to be steamed  up and ready, too, by now--\"    He opened a tight wall cabinet, originally intended to sterilize clothing  which might be contaminated by contact with organisms inimical to  Terrans. A cloud of steam fragrant with the same spicy scent poured out.    Dane gingerly tugged loose his Trade uniform, its brown silky fabric damp  on his skin as he dressed. Luckily Sargol was warm. When he stepped out  on its ruby tinted soil this morning no lingering taint of his off-world  origin must remain to disgust the sensitive nostrils of the Salariki. He  supposed he would get used to this process. After all this was the first  time he had undergone the ritual. But he couldn't lose the secret  conviction that it was all very silly. Only what Rip had pointed out was  the truth--one adjusted to the customs of aliens or one didn't trade and  there were other things he might have had to do on other worlds which  would have been far more upsetting to that core of private fastidiousness  which few would have suspected existed in his tall, lanky frame.    \"Whew--out in the open with you--!\" Ali Kamil apprentice Engineer,  screwed his too regular features into an expression of extreme distaste  and waved Dane by him in the corridor.    For the sake of his shipmates' olfactory nerves, Dane hurried on to the  port which gave on the ramp now tying the Queen to Sargol's crust. But  there he lingered, waiting for Van Rycke, the Cargo-master of the spacer  and his immediate superior. It was early morning and now that he was out  of the confinement of the ship the fresh morning winds cut about him,  rippling through the blue-green grass forest beyond, to take much of his  momentary irritation with them.    There were no mountains in this section of Sargol--the highest elevations  being rounded hills tightly clothed with the same ten-foot grass which  covered the plains. From the Queen's observation ports, one could watch  the constant ripple of the grass so that the planet appeared to be  largely clothed in a shimmering, flowing carpet. To the west were the  seas--stretches of shallow water so cut up by strings of islands that  they more resembled a series of salty lakes. And it was what was to be  found in those seas which had lured the Solar Queen to Sargol.    Though, by rights, the discovery was that of another Trader--Traxt  Cam--who had bid for trading rights to Sargol, hoping to make a  comfortable fortune--or at least expenses with a slight profit--in the  perfume trade, exporting from the scented planet some of its most  fragrant products. But once on Sargol he had discovered the Koros  stones--gems of a new type--a handful of which offered across the board  in one of the inner planet trading marts had nearly caused a riot among  bidding gem merchants. And Cam had been well on the way to becoming one  of the princes of Trade when he had been drawn into the vicious net of  the Limbian pirates and finished off.    Because they, too, had stumbled into the trap which was Limbo, and had  had a very definite part in breaking up that devilish installation, the  crew of the Solar Queen had claimed as their reward the trading rights of  Traxt Cam in default of legal heirs. And so here they were on Sargol with  the notes left by Cam as their guide, and as much lore concerning the  Salariki as was known crammed into their minds.    Dane sat down on the end of the ramp, his feet on Sargolian soil, thin,  red soil with glittering bits of gold flake in it. He did not doubt that  he was under observation from hidden eyes, but he tried to show no sign  that he guessed it. The adult Salariki maintained at all times an  attitude of aloof and complete indifference toward the Traders, but the  juvenile population were as curious as their elders were contemptuous.  Perhaps there was a method of approach in that. Dane considered the idea.    Van Rycke and Captain Jellico had handled the first negotiations--and the  process had taken most of a day--the result totaling exactly nothing. In  their contacts with the off world men the feline ancestered Salariki were  ceremonious, wary, and completely detached. But Cam had gotten to them  somehow--or he would not have returned from his first trip with that  pouch of Koros stones. Only, among his records, salvaged on Limbo, he had  left absolutely no clue as to how he had beaten down native sales  resistance. It was baffling. But patience had to be the middle name of  every Trader and Dane had complete faith in Van. Sooner or later the  Cargo-master would find a key to unlock the Salariki.    As if the thought of Dane's chief had summoned him, Van Rycke, his  scented tunic sealed to his bull's neck in unaccustomed trimness, his  cap on his blond head, strode down the ramp, broadcasting waves of  fragrance as he moved. He sniffed vigorously as he approached his  assistant and then nodded in approval.    \"So you're all greased and ready--\"    \"Is the Captain coming too, sir?\"    Van Rycke shook his head. \"This is our headache. Patience, my boy,  patience--\" He led the way through a thin screen of the grass on the  other side of the scorched landing field to a well-packed earth road.    Again Dane felt eyes, knew that they were being watched. But no Salarik  stepped out of concealment. At least they had nothing to fear in the way  of attack. Traders were immune, taboo, and the trading stations were set  up under the white diamond shield of peace, a peace guaranteed on blood  oath by every clan chieftain in the district. Even in the midst of  interclan feuding deadly enemies met in amity under that shield and would  not turn claw knife against each other within a two mile radius of its  protection.    The grass forests rustled betrayingly, but the Terrans displayed no  interest in those who spied upon them. An insect with wings of brilliant  green gauze detached itself from the stalk of a grass tree and fluttered  ahead of the Traders as if it were an official herald. From the red soil  crushed by their boots arose a pungent odor which fought with the scent  they carried with them. Dane swallowed three or four times and hoped that  his superior officer had not noticed that sign of discomfort. Though Van  Rycke, in spite of his general air of sleepy benevolence and careless  goodwill, noticed everything, no matter how trivial, which might have a  bearing on the delicate negotiations of Galactic Trade. He had not  climbed to his present status of expert Cargo-master by overlooking  anything at all. Now he gave an order:    \"Take an equalizer--\"    Dane reached for his belt pouch, flushing, fiercely determined inside  himself, that no matter how smells warred about him that day, he was not  going to let it bother him. He swallowed the tiny pellet Medic Tau had  prepared for just such trials and tried to occupy his mind with the work  to come. If there would be any work--or would another long day be wasted  in futile speeches of mutual esteem which gave formal lip service to  Trade and its manifest benefits?    \"Houuuu--\" The cry which was half wail, half arrogant warning, sounded  along the road behind them.    Van Rycke's stride did not vary. He did not turn his head, show any sign  he had heard that heralding fanfare for a clan chieftain. And he  continued to keep to the exact center of the road, Dane the regulation  one pace to the rear and left as befitted his lower rank.    \"Houuu--\" that blast from the throat of a Salarik especially chosen for  his lung power was accompanied now by the hollow drum of many feet. The  Terrans neither looked around nor withdrew from the center, nor did their  pace quicken.

At this point  he closed his public career. He had reached the goal of a politician's  ambition and had become known as one of the best speakers of his time,  but he seems to have realized that under the Principate politics was a  dull farce, and that oratory was of little value in a time of peace  and strong government. The rest of his life was to be spent in writing  history. In the year of his consulship or immediately after it, he  published the _Agricola_ and _Germania_, short monographs in which he  practised the transition from the style of the speaker to that of the  writer. In the preface to the _Agricola_ he foreshadows the larger  work on which he is engaged. 'I shall find it a pleasant task to put  together, though in rough and unfinished style, a memorial of our  former slavery and a record of our present happiness.' His intention  was to write a history of the Principate from Augustus to Trajan. He  began with his own times, and wrote in twelve or fourteen books a full  account of the period from Nero's death in 68 A.D. to the death of  Domitian in 96 A.D. These were published, probably in successive  books, between 106 and 109 A.D. Only the first four and a half books  survive to us. They deal with the years 69 and 70, and are known as  _The Histories_. _The Annals_, which soon followed, dealt with the  Julian dynasty after the death of Augustus. Of Augustus' constitution  of the principate and of Rome's 'present happiness' under Trajan,  Tacitus did not live to write.    _The Histories_, as they survive to us, describe in a style that has  made them immortal one of the most terrible and crucial moments of  Roman history. The deadly struggle for the throne demonstrated finally  the real nature of the Principate--based not on constitutional  fictions but on armed force--and the supple inefficiency of the  senatorial class. The revolt on the Rhine foreshadowed the debacle of  the fifth century. Tacitus was peculiarly well qualified to write the  history of this period. He had been the eye-witness of some of the  most terrible scenes: he was acquainted with all the distinguished  survivors: his political experience gave him a statesman's point of  view, and his rhetorical training a style which mirrored both the  terror of the times and his own emotion. More than any other Roman  historian he desired to tell the truth and was not fatally biassed by  prejudice. It is wrong to regard Tacitus as an 'embittered  rhetorician', an 'enemy of the Empire', a 'detracteur de  l'humanite'.[1] He was none of these. As a member of a noble, though  not an ancient, family, and as one who had completed the republican  _cursus honorum_, his sympathies were naturally senatorial. He  regretted that the days were passed when oratory was a real power and  the consuls were the twin towers of the world. But he never hoped to  see such days again. He realized that monarchy was essential to peace,  and that the price of freedom was violence and disorder. He had no  illusions about the senate. Fault and misfortune had reduced them to  nerveless servility, a luxury of self-abasement. Their meekness would  never inherit the earth. Tacitus pours scorn on the philosophic  opponents of the Principate, who while refusing to serve the emperor  and pretending to hope for the restoration of the republic, could  contribute nothing more useful than an ostentatious suicide. His own  career, and still more the career of his father-in-law Agricola,  showed that even under bad emperors a man could be great without  dishonour. Tacitus was no republican in any sense of the word, but  rather a monarchist _malgre lui_. There was nothing for it but to pray  for good emperors and put up with bad ones.    Those who decry Tacitus for prejudice against the Empire forget that  he is describing emperors who were indubitably bad. We have lost his  account of Vespasian's reign. His praise of Augustus and of Trajan was  never written. The emperors whom he depicts for us were all either  tyrannical or contemptible, or both: no floods of modern biography can  wash them white. They seemed to him to have degraded Roman life and  left no room for _virtus_ in the world. The verdict of Rome had gone  against them. So he devotes to their portraiture the venom which the  fifteen years of Domitian's reign of terror had engendered in his  heart. He was inevitably a pessimist; his ideals lay in the past; yet  he clearly shows that he had some hope of the future. Without sharing  Pliny's faith that the millennium had dawned, he admits that Nerva and  Trajan have inaugurated 'happier times' and combined monarchy with  some degree of personal freedom.    There are other reasons for the 'dark shadows' in Tacitus' work.  History to a Roman was _opus oratorium,_ a work of literary art. Truth  is a great but not a sufficient merit. The historian must be not only  _narrator_ but _ornator rerum_. He must carefully select and arrange  the incidents, compose them into an effective group, and by the power  of language make them memorable and alive. In these books Tacitus has  little but horrors to describe: his art makes them unforgettably  horrible. The same art is ready to display the beauty of courage and  self-sacrifice. But these were rarer phenomena than cowardice and  greed. It was not Tacitus, but the age, which showed a preference for  vice. Moreover, the historian's art was not to be used solely for its  own sake. All ancient history was written with a moral object; the  ethical interest predominates almost to the exclusion of all others.  Tacitus is never merely literary. The [Greek: semnotes] which Pliny  notes as the characteristic of his oratory, never lets him sparkle to  no purpose. All his pictures have a moral object 'to rescue virtue  from oblivion and restrain vice by the terror of posthumous  infamy'.[2] His prime interest is character: and when he has  conducted some skilful piece of moral diagnosis there attaches to his  verdict some of the severity of a sermon. If you want to make men  better you must uncover and scarify their sins.    Few Christian moralists deal much in eulogy, and Tacitus' diatribes  are the more frequent and the more fierce because his was the morality  not of Christ but of Rome. 'The Poor' are as dirt to him: he can stoop  to immortalize some gleam of goodness in low life, but even then his  main object is by scorn of contrast to galvanize the aristocracy into  better ways. Only in them can true _virtus_ grow. Their degradation  seems the death of goodness. Tacitus had little sympathy with the  social revolution that was rapidly completing itself, not so much  because those who rose from the masses lacked 'blood', but because  they had not been trained in the right traditions. In the decay of  Education he finds a prime cause of evil. And being a Roman--wherever  he may have been born--he inevitably feels that the decay of Roman  life must rot the world. His eyes are not really open to the Empire.  He never seems to think that in the spacious provinces to which the  old Roman virtues had taken flight, men were leading happy, useful  lives, because the strong hand of the imperial government had come to  save them from the inefficiency of aristocratic governors. This  narrowness of view accounts for much of Tacitus' pessimism.    Recognition of the atmosphere in which Tacitus wrote and the objects  at which his history aimed helps one to understand why it sometimes  disappoints modern expectations. Particular scenes are seared on our  memories: persons stand before us lit to the soul by a fierce light of  psychological analysis: we learn to loath the characteristic vices of  the time, and to understand the moral causes of Roman decadence. But  somehow the dominance of the moral interest and the frequent  interruption of the narrative by scenes of senatorial inefficiency  serve to obscure the plain sequence of events. It is difficult after a  first reading of the _Histories_ to state clearly what happened in  these two years. And this difficulty is vastly annoying to experts who  wish to trace the course of the three campaigns. Those whose interest  is not in Tacitus but in the military history of the period are  recommended to study Mr. B.W. Henderson's _Civil War and Rebellion in  the Roman Empire_, a delightful book which makes the dark places  plain. But they are not recommended to share his contempt for Tacitus  because his accounts of warfare are as bad as, for instance,  Shakespeare's. Tacitus "]]]
