TO    THE READERS STUDIOUS IN HISTORIES.           *       *       *       *       *      The order obserued in the description of Britaine, by reason of the  necessarie diuision thereof into bookes and chapters growing out of  the varietie of matters therein conteined, seemed (in my iudgement) so  conuenient a course deuised by the writer, as I was easilie induced  thereby to digest the historie of England immediatlie following into the  like method: so that as in the one, so likewise in the other, by summarie  contents foregoing euerie chapter, as also by certeine materiall titles  added at the head of euerie page of the said historie, it is a thing of  no difficultie to comprehend what is discoursed and discussed in the  same.    Wherein (sith histories are said to be the registers of memorie and the  monuments of veritie) all louers of knowlege, speciallie historicall,  are aduisedlie to marke (among other points) the seuerall and successiue  alterations of regiments in this land: whereof it was my meaning to haue  [Sidenote: Pag. 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 26, 27, 28, 49, 50, 51, of the  description: and pag. 765, 766, of the historie of England.]  made an abstract, but that the same is sufficientlie handled in the first  booke and fourth chapter of the description of Britaine; whereto if the  seuenth chapter of the same booke be also annexed, there is litle or no  defect at all in that case wherof iustlie to make complaint.    Wherfore by remitting the readers to those, I reape this aduantage,  namelie a discharge of a forethought & purposed labour, which as to  reduce into some plausible forme was a worke both of time, paine and  studie: so seeming vnlikelie to be comprised in few words (being a matter  of necessarie and important obseruation) occasion of tediousnes is to and  fro auoided; speciallie to the reader, who is further to be aduertised,  that the computations of yeares here and there expressed, according to  the indirect direction of the copies whense they were deriued and drawne,  is not so absolute (in some mens opinion) as it might haue beene: howbeit  iustifiable by their originals.    Wherin hereafter (God prolonging peace in the church and commonwelth  that the vse of bookes may not be abridged) such diligent care shall be  had, that in whatsoeuer the helpe of bookes will doo good, or conference  with antiquaries auaile, there shall want no will to vse the one and the  other. And yet it is not a worke for euerie common capacitie, naie it is  a toile without head or taile euen for extraordinarie wits, to correct  the accounts of former ages so many hundred yeares receiued, out of  vncerteinties to raise certeinties, and to reconcile writers dissenting  in opinion and report. But as this is vnpossible, so is no more to be  looked for than may be performed: and further to inquire as it is against  reason, so to vndertake more than may commendablie be atchiued, were  fowle follie.    ABRAHAM FLEMING.                 *       *       *       *       *    THE FIRST BOOKE    OF THE    HISTORIE OF ENGLAND.           *       *       *       *       *          _Who inhabited this Iland before the comming of Brute: of Noah & his  three sonnes, among whom the whole earth was diuided: and to which of  their portions this Ile of Britaine befell._      THE FIRST CHAPTER.      What manner of people did first inhabite this our country, which hath  most generallie and of longest continuance beene knowne among all nations  by the name of Britaine as yet is not certeinly knowne; neither can it be  decided fr[=o] whence the first inhabitants there of came, by reason of  such diuersitie in iudgements as haue risen amongst the learned in this  [Sidenote: The originall of nations for the most part vncerteine.]  behalfe. But sith the originall in maner of all nations is doubtfull, and  euen the same for the more part fabulous (that alwaies excepted which we  find in the holie scriptures) I wish not any man to leane to that which  shall be here set downe as to an infallible truth, sith I doo but onlie  shew other mens conjectures, grounded neuerthelesse vpon likelie reasons,  concerning that matter whereof there is now left but little other  certeintie, or rather none at all.    [Sidenote: Whither Britaine were an Iland at the first.  _Geog. com. lib._  No Ilands at the first, as some coniecture.]  To fetch therefore the matter from the farthest, and so to stretch it  forward, it seemeth by the report of Dominicus Marius Niger that in the  beginning, when God framed the world, and diuided the waters apart from  the earth, this Ile was then a parcell of the continent, and ioined  without any separation of sea to the maine land. But this opinion (as all  other the like vncerteinties) I leaue to be discussed of by the learned:  howbeit for the first inhabitation of this Ile with people, I haue  thought good to set downe in part, what may be gathered out of such  writers as haue touched that matter, and may seeme to giue some light  vnto the knowledge thereof.    [Sidenote: In the first part of the acts of the English votaries.  Britaine inhabitied before the floud.  _Genesis 6_.  _Berosus ant. lib._ 1.]  First therefore Iohn Bale our countrieman, who in his time greatlie  trauelled in the search of such antiquities, dooth probablie coniecture,  that this land was inhabited and replenished with people long before the  floud, at that time in the which the generation of mankind (as Moses  writeth) began to multiplie vpon the vniuersall face of the earth: and  therfore it followeth, that as well this land was inhabited with people  long before the daies of Noah, as any the other countries and parts  of the world beside. But when they had once forsaken the ordinances  appointed them by God, and betaken them to new waies inuented of  themselues, such loosenesse of life ensued euerie where, as brought vpon  them the great deluge and vniuersall floud, in the which perished as well  the inhabitants of these quarters, as the residue of the race of mankind,  generallie dispersed in euerie other part of the whole world, onelie Noah  & his familie excepted, who by the prouidence and pleasure of almightie  God was preserued from the rage of those waters, to recontinue and  repaire the new generation of man of vpon earth.    [Sidenote: NOAH. _In comment. super 4. lib._  _Berosus de antiquit. lib._ 1  _Annius vt suor._]  After the flood (as Annius de Viterbo recordeth) and reason also  enforceth, Noah was the onlie monarch of all the world, and as the same  Annius gathereth by the account of Moses in the 100. yeare after the  flood, Noah diuided the earth among his three sonnes; assigning to the  possession of his eldest sonne all that portion of land which now is  knowne by the name of Asia; to his second sonne Cham, he appointed all  that part of the world which now is called Affrica: and to his third  sonne Iaphet was allotted all Europa, with all the Iles therto belonging,  wherin among other was conteined this our Ile of Britaine, with the other  Iles thereto perteining.    [Sidenote: IAPHET AND HIS SONNES.  _Johannes Bodinus ad fac. hist. cogn._  _Franciscus Tarapha_.]  Iaphet the third son of Noah, of some called Iapetus, and of others,  Atlas Maurus (because he departed this life in Mauritania) was the first  (as Bodinus affirmeth by the authoritie and consent of the Hebrue, Greeke  & Latine writers) that peopled the countries of Europe, which afterward  he diuided among his sonnes: of whom Tuball (as Tarapha affirmeth)  obteined the kingdome of Spaine. Gomer had dominion ouer the Italians,  and (as Berosus and diuers other authors agree) Samothes was the founder  of Celtica, which conteined in it (as Bale witnesseth) a great part of  Europe, but speciallie those countries which now are called by the names  of Gallia and Britannia.    [Sidenote: Britaine inhabited shortlie after the floud.]  Thus was this Iland inhabited and peopled within 200 yeeres after the  floud by the children of Iaphet the sonne of Noah: & this is not onlie  prooued by Annius, writing vpon Berosus, but also confirmed by Moses in  the scripture, where he writeth, that of the offspring of Iaphet, the  Iles of the Gentiles (wherof Britain is one) were sorted into regions in  the time of Phaleg the sonne of Hiber, who was borne at the time of the  [Sidenote: _Theophilus episcop. Antioch. ad Anfol lib. 2._  The words of Theophilus a doctor of the church, who liued an. Dom. 160.]  diuision of languages. Herevpon Theophilus hath these words: \"Cum priscis  temporibus pauci forent homines in Arabia & Chaldaea, post linguarum  diuisionem aucti & multiplicati paulatim sunt: hinc quidam abierunt  versus orientem, quidam concessere ad partes maioris continentis, alij  porro profecti sunt ad septentrionem sedes quaesituri, nec prius desierunt  terram vbiq; occupare, quam etiam Britannos in Arctois climatibus  accesserint, &c.\" _That is_; \"When at the first there were not manie  men in Arabia and Chaldaea, it came to passe, that after the diuision of  toongs, they began somewhat better to increase and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16523"],[0,"The Kitáb-i-Aqdas (#1)"],[1,"Kitab-i-Aqdas      by Baha'u'llah          Edition 1, (June 21, 2005)                                       BAHA'I TERMS OF USE      You have permission to freely make and use copies of the text and any  other information (\"Content\") available on this Site including printing,  emailing, posting, distributing, copying, downloading, uploading,  transmitting, displaying the Content in whole or in part subject to the  following:    1.

Let him that findeth no water for ablution repeat five times the     words \"In the Name of God, the Most Pure, the Most Pure\", and then     proceed to his devotions. #10     17.
