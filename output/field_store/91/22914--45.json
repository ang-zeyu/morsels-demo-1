[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34901"],[0,"On Liberty (#7)"],[1," the \"liberty of the press\" as one of the securities against  corrupt or tyrannical government. No argument, we may suppose, can now  be needed, against permitting a legislature or an executive, not  identified in interest with the people, to prescribe opinions to them,  and determine what doctrines or what arguments they shall be allowed to  hear. This aspect of the question, besides, has been so often and so  triumphantly enforced by preceding writers, that it need not be  specially insisted on in this place. Though the law of England, on the  subject of the press, is as servile to this day as it was in the time of  the Tudors, there is little danger of its being actually put in force  against political discussion, except during some temporary panic, when  fear of insurrection drives ministers and judges from their  propriety;[6] and, speaking generally, it is not, in constitutional  countries, to be apprehended that the government, whether completely  responsible to the people or not, will often attempt to control the  expression of opinion, except when in doing so it makes itself the organ  of the general intolerance of the public. Let us suppose, therefore,  that the government is entirely at one with the people, and never thinks  of exerting any power of coercion unless in agreement with what it  conceives to be their voice. But I deny the right of the people to  exercise such coercion, either by themselves or by their government. The  power itself is illegitimate. The best government has no more title to  it than the worst. It is as noxious, or more noxious, when exerted in  accordance with public opinion, than when in or opposition to it. If all  mankind minus one, were of one opinion, and only one person were of the  contrary opinion, mankind would be no more justified in silencing that  one person, than he, if he had the power, would be justified in  silencing mankind. Were an opinion a personal possession of no value  except to the owner; if to be obstructed in the enjoyment of it were  simply a private injury, it would make some difference whether the  injury was inflicted only on a few persons or on many. But the peculiar  evil of silencing the expression of an opinion is, that it is robbing  the human race; posterity as well as the existing generation; those who  dissent from the opinion, still more than those who hold it. If the  opinion is right, they are deprived of the opportunity of exchanging  error for truth: if wrong, they lose, what is almost as great a benefit,  the clearer perception and livelier impression of truth, produced by its  collision with error.    It is necessary to consider separately these two hypotheses, each of  which has a distinct branch of the argument corresponding to it. We can  never be sure that the opinion we are endeavouring to stifle is a false  opinion; and if we were sure, stifling it would be an evil still.      First: the opinion which it is attempted to suppress by authority may  possibly be true. Those who desire to suppress it, of course deny its  truth; but they are not infallible. They have no authority to decide the  question for all mankind, and exclude every other person from the means  of judging. To refuse a hearing to an opinion, because they are sure  that it is false, is to assume that _their_ certainty is the same thing  as _absolute_ certainty. All silencing of discussion is an assumption  of infallibility. Its condemnation may be allowed to rest on this common  argument, not the worse for being common.    Unfortunately for the good sense of mankind, the fact of their  fallibility is far from carrying the weight in their practical judgment,  which is always allowed to it in theory; for while every one well knows  himself to be fallible, few think it necessary to take any precautions  against their own fallibility, or admit the supposition that any  opinion, of which they feel very certain, may be one of the examples of  the error to which they acknowledge themselves to be liable. Absolute  princes, or others who are accustomed to unlimited deference, usually  feel this complete confidence in their own opinions on nearly all  subjects. People more happily situated, who sometimes hear their  opinions disputed, and are not wholly unused to be set right when they  are wrong, place the same unbounded reliance only on such of their  opinions as are shared by all who surround them, or to whom they  habitually defer: for in proportion to a man's want of confidence in his  own solitary judgment, does he usually repose, with implicit trust, on  the infallibility of \"the world\" in general. And the world, to each  individual, means the part of it with which he comes in contact; his  party, his sect, his church, his class of society: the man may be  called, by comparison, almost liberal and large-minded to whom it means  anything so comprehensive as his own country or his own age. Nor is his  faith in this collective authority at all shaken by his being aware that  other ages, countries, sects, churches, classes, and parties have  thought, and even now think, the exact reverse. He devolves upon his own  world the responsibility of being in the right against the dissentient  worlds of other people; and it never troubles him that mere accident has  decided which of these numerous worlds is the object of his reliance,  and that the same causes which make him a Churchman in London, would  have made him a Buddhist or a Confucian in Pekin. Yet it is as evident  in itself as any amount of argument can make it, that ages are no more  infallible than individuals; every age having held many opinions which  subsequent ages have deemed not only false but absurd; and it is as  certain that many opinions, now general, will be rejected by future  ages, as it is that many, once general, are rejected by the present.    The objection likely to be made to this argument, would probably take  some such form as the following. There is no greater assumption of  infallibility in forbidding the propagation of error, than in any other  thing which is done by public authority on its own judgment and  responsibility. Judgment is given to men that they may use it. Because  it may be used erroneously, are men to be told that they ought not to  use it at all? To prohibit what they think pernicious, is not claiming  exemption from error, but fulfilling the duty incumbent on them,  although fallible, of acting on their conscientious conviction. If we  were never to act on our opinions, because those opinions may be wrong,  we should leave all our interests uncared for, and all our duties  unperformed. An objection which applies to all conduct, can be no valid  objection to any conduct in particular. It is the duty of governments,  and of individuals, to form the truest opinions they can; to form them  carefully, and never impose them upon others unless they are quite sure  of being right. But when they are sure (such reasoners may say), it is  not conscientiousness but cowardice to shrink from acting on their  opinions, and allow doctrines which they honestly think dangerous to the  welfare of mankind, either in this life or in another, to be scattered  abroad without restraint, because other people, in less enlightened  times, have persecuted opinions now believed to be true. Let us take  care, it may be said, not to make the same mistake: but governments and  nations have made mistakes in other things, which are not denied to be  fit subjects for the exercise of authority: they have laid on bad taxes,  made unjust wars. Ought we therefore to lay on no taxes, and, under  whatever provocation, make no wars? Men, and governments, must act to  the best of their ability. There is no such thing as absolute certainty,  but there is assurance sufficient for the purposes of human life. We  may, and must, assume our opinion to be true for the guidance of our own  conduct: and it is assuming no more when we forbid bad men to pervert  society by the propagation of opinions which we regard as false and  pernicious.    I answer that it is assuming very much more. There is the greatest  difference between presuming an opinion to be true, because, with every  opportunity for contesting it, it has not been refuted, and assuming its  truth for the purpose of not permitting its refutation. Complete liberty  of contradicting and disproving our opinion, is the very condition which  justifies us in assuming its truth for purposes of action; and on no  other terms can a being with human faculties have any rational assurance  of being right.    When we consider either the history of opinion, or the ordinary conduct  of human life, to what is it to be ascribed that the one and the other  are no worse than they are? Not certainly to the inherent force of the  human understanding; for, on any matter not self-evident, there are  ninety-nine persons totally incapable of judging of it, for one who is  capable; and the capacity of the hundredth person is only comparative;  for the majority of the eminent men of every past generation held many  opinions now known to be erroneous, and did or approved numerous things  which no one will now justify. Why is it, then, that there is on the  whole a preponderance among mankind of rational opinions and rational  conduct? If there really is this preponderance--which there must be,  unless human affairs are, and have always been, in an almost desperate  state--it is owing to a quality of the human mind, the source of  everything respectable in man either as an intellectual or as a moral  being, namely, that his errors are corrigible. He is capable of  rectifying his mistakes, by discussion and experience. Not by experience  alone. There must be discussion, to show how experience is to be  interpreted. Wrong opinions and practices gradually yield to fact and  argument: but facts and arguments, to produce any effect on the mind,  must be brought before it. Very few facts are"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34903"],[0,"Dress Design: An Account of Costume for Artists & Dressmakers (#7)"],[1," made without a crown, as in Fig. 28 (see p. 94); the  roll was decorated, as a rule, with jewelled studs. A top hat, something  like our present shape, appears, but more belled at the top and also a  padded, rolled brim. It was made in various rich materials, and often  decorated with jewels. The peak-fronted hat still continued to be  favoured till about 1480, its chief difference being a crown more  eccentric in height. Tall cylinder hats, with folded brims or no brim,  and other shapes are illustrated. The variety is so great through this  period that it is well to study the vagaries of fashion which I have  illustrated in sequence as far as possible; they were mostly used till  about the last quarter of this century, when the low-crowned flat hat  with turned-up brim began to secure the fashion. This was generally worn  tilted on one side and often over a scarlet skull-cap. A large bunch of  plumes came in with this hat, set up from the front, curving backwards,  and giving a very grand effect: with most of the tall hats the  feather was set at the back.    [Illustration: FIG. 30.--Fifteenth century.]    [Illustration: FIG. 31.--Fifteenth century, 1st half.]    [Illustration: FIG. 32.--Fifteenth century, 2nd half.]    The notable change in the tunic, which was worn both very short and to  the ground, was the arrangement of folds to the back and front, gathered  to a =V= shape at the waist. The hanging sleeve began to go out of favour  after the middle of the century, but the sleeve or cuff covering the  hand was continued till the end of this century.    A sleeve, full at the shoulder, is found, and short, round, padded  sleeves came in, worn over a close-fitting sleeve. This short sleeve  became raised on the shoulder, and was cut or looped up the outer side:  a long loose outer sleeve is also seen in conjunction with these short  ones. A very short jacket is notable, of a plain square shape, with a  plain sleeve on the left arm and a hanging sleeve on the right to the  knee. The tight-fitting jerkin, laced down the front, was worn with this  as with most other coats.    [Illustration: FIG. 33.--End of fifteenth century.]    [Illustration: FIG. 34.--Fifteenth century, 2nd half.]    [Illustration: Plate VIIIa--        (_a_) Suit of Embroidered Silk. 1610-30.

Very short and very long \"chasubles\" were worn with or without sleeves  which were gathered high and full at the shoulders. The sleeves  were now sometimes slit open at the back and held with several ties, as  linen sleeves are now shown with these.    Parti-coloured tights were not so much favoured through this period, but  a decorated thigh, or part of the thigh and knee, was a favourite method  of enrichment.    [Illustration: FIG. 36.]    A long coat came in at the later part of this time, with a deep =V=-shaped  collar meeting at the waist; it was also cut into a square shape at the  shoulders, as in Fig. 43 (see p. 119). A loose bell-shaped sleeve  usually went with this, often opened in the front of the upper arm. A  short square cape is at times seen in conjunction with this. A low  square or round neck shape came in during the last quarter of this  century, filled in with a fine gathered lawn and a tight-fitting coat  with a pleated skirt and full padded sleeves, or a tight sleeve  with a full puff or spherical upper part.

Soft high boots to the top of the thigh, with folded top, belong  to this century, as well as the fashionable boot to the calf. The sword  or dagger was carried towards the front or side, and a small dagger  across the belt at the back. The pouch or purse was also used as a  dagger support.          CHAPTER V      SIXTEENTH CENTURY. CHARACTER OF TRIMMINGS.    Before the 16th century we find the art of decoration in costume had  been confined chiefly to applied ornamental bands at the neck, waist,  and borders of skirt and cloak. They had up till this time utilised,  with great artistry of design (no doubt partly due to the heraldic  study), the patterns of the finely decorated damasks and velvets.  The counter colour effects and relative proportions, such as a  small-patterned, dull-coloured silk setting off a large full-coloured  design was ably considered, as well as the introduction of a  nicely-balanced black note or setting, which proved these designers were  highly skilled in judgment of style. They also discovered the art of  giving enrichment and lightness to the effect by means of the various  serrated edgings to the materials, which also gave a flutter to the  movement. A preference of lacing for fastening added to the charm of the  dress, but the long rows of close buttons were also a feature of the  clinging robes, the clasps and brooches, neck-chains, girdle, belt, and  wallet being further very important items of enrichment to the effect.    On coming to the 16th century we enter what may be termed the slashed  and puffed period. The sleeves of Henry VIII's reign are very rich in  design and jewel-setting, the design of the sleeve as in Fig. 40 giving  a striking effect, the angle of the top sleeve being held out by the  stiffness of the under silk one. The neck-setting and festooning of the  jewel-chains play an important part in the design on the plain velvet  corset bodices. The head-dress is one of the most remarkable, and gave a  great chance for individual arrangement in binding the back fall to set  at various angles on the shaped cap piece, combining severity with a big  loose draping which is extremely picturesque. With Edward VI commences  what may be termed the braided period of decoration. This latter came  suitably with the stiffer corsage and set up. Mary's reign was not of  attractive severity, but the over-robe with the short circular sleeve at  the shoulder and high collar was a graceful creation, and was retained  by many as late as 1630. There was little to admire in the Elizabethan  age as regards design, except the beauty of the materials and the  exquisite needlework. The proportions of the dresses were exceedingly  ugly, and the pleated farthingale an absurdity. The male dress had much  interest and often beauty of setting and decorative effect. The slashed  materials gave a broken quality to what would otherwise be a hard  effect, and it also cleverly introduced another colour change through  the suit. There will be found many examples in these illustrations of  the pricked and punctured designs on leather-work which are worth  examining for modern treatment.    Quilting and pleating were ably combined with the braiding, and we see  the clever adaptation of straw patterns sewn on (a feature of the late  16th century), which harmonised with the gold braidings or gold lace, or  resembled the same effect.    The trimmings of braid were often enriched with precious or ornamental  stones and pearls, the stomacher, waist, front band down the skirt, and  borders of most garments. The points of slashes were often held by  jewelled settings, and the long slashes were caught here and there with  the same.    Another important item was the black stitchwork on linen, sometimes  mingled with gold, so highly prized now for its beauty of design and  effect, but beginning probably in the reign of Henry VII.    Short coats of this type of the Elizabethan age are marvels of skill,  and many caps are still in existence. Fine linen ruffs and collars were  often edged with this work, as well as with gold lace.    Jackets and caps, both male and female, bearing geometrical and scroll  designs in gold, filled in with coloured needlework of flowers, birds,  or animals have happily been preserved for our admiration.    Sequins appear on work from Henry VIII's time, and were much appreciated  by the Elizabethan workers, who no doubt found the trembling glitter  added much to the gold-lace settings and delicate veilings: long  pear-shaped sequins were favoured for this. Sleeves were often separate,  and could be changed at will.      SIXTEENTH CENTURY. HENRY VIII. FEMALE.    The hair at this period was parted in the centre and gathered into a  plait at the back; it was also seen rather full and waved at the sides  of the head, and a small circlet was often carried across the brow.
