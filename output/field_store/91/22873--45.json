They are then placed in layers, in jars,  sprinkled with salt and pepper, and covered with pure olive oil or  vinegar. _Lactarius deliciosus_, _Cantharellus cibarius_, _Morchellas_,  _Clavarias_, etc., are thus preserved. Before using the dried mushrooms  they are soaked in tepid water for some time and afterwards prepared as  if fresh, with the usual seasoning.      RECEIPTS.    _Broiled procerus._--Remove the scales and stalks from the agarics, and  broil lightly on both sides over a clear fire for a few minutes; arrange  them on a dish over freshly made, well-buttered toast; sprinkle with  pepper and salt and put a small piece of butter on each; set before a  brisk fire to melt the butter, and serve quickly. Bacon toasted over  mushrooms improves the flavor and saves the butter.    _Agarics delicately stewed._--Remove the stalks and scales from the  young half-grown agarics, and throw each one as you do so into a basin  of fresh water slightly acidulated with the juice of a lemon or a little  good vinegar. When all are prepared, remove them from the water and put  them in a stewpan with a very small piece of fresh butter. Sprinkle with  pepper and salt and add a little lemon juice; cover up closely and stew  for half an hour; then add a spoonful of flour with sufficient cream or  cream and milk, till the whole has the thickness of cream. Season to  taste, and stew again until the agarics are perfectly tender. Remove all  the butter from the surface and serve in a hot dish garnished with  slices of lemon. A little mace or nutmeg or catsup may be added, but  some think that spice spoils the flavor.    _Cottager's procerus pie._--Cut fresh agarics in small pieces; pepper,  salt, and place them on small shreds of bacon, in the bottom of a pie  dish; then put in a layer of mashed potatoes, and so fill the dish,  layer by layer, with a cover of mashed potatoes for the crust. Bake well  for half an hour and brown before a quick fire.    _A la provencale._--Steep for two hours in some salt, pepper, and a  little garlic; then toss them into a small stewpan over a brisk fire  with parsley chopped and a little lemon juice.    _Agaric catsup._--Place the agarics of as large a size as you can  procure, layer by layer, in a deep pan, sprinkling each layer as it is  put in with a little salt. Then next day stir them several times well so  as to mash and extract their juice. On the third day strain off the  liquor, measure and boil for ten minutes, and then to every pint of  liquor add half an ounce of black pepper, a quarter of an ounce of  bruised ginger root, a blade of mace, a clove or two, and a teaspoonful  of mustard seed. Boil again for half an hour; put in two or three bay  leaves and set aside until quite cold. Pass through a strainer and  bottle; cork well and dip salt on the gills. Lay them top downwards on a  gridiron over a moderate fire for five or six minutes at the most.    _To stew mushrooms._--Trim and rub clean half a pint of large button  mushrooms. Put into a stewpan 2 ounces of butter; shake it over a fire  until thoroughly melted; put in the mushrooms, a teaspoonful of salt,  half as much pepper, and a blade of mace pounded; stew until the  mushrooms are tender, then serve on a hot dish. This is usually a  breakfast dish.    _Mushrooms a la creme._--Trim and rub half a pint of button mushrooms;  dissolve in a stewpan 2 ounces of butter rolled in flour; put in the  mushrooms, a bunch of parsley, a teaspoonful of salt, half a teaspoonful  each of white pepper and of powdered sugar; shake the pan for ten  minutes; then beat up the yolks of two eggs with two tablespoonfuls of  cream, and add by degrees to the mushrooms; in two or three minutes you  can serve them in sauce.    _Mushrooms on toast._--Put a pint of mushrooms into a stewpan with two  ounces of butter rolled in flour; add a teaspoonful of salt, half a  teaspoonful of white pepper, a blade of powdered mace, and a half a  teaspoonful of grated lemon; stew until the butter is all absorbed; then  serve on toast as soon as the mushrooms are tender.

Indeed, birds without the white on the breast and  with very little on the wing are valuable breeders since there is a  tendency for too much white to occur in the plumage. Occasionally all  black birds occur and these can be used to advantage in breeding when  there is a tendency toward too much white in plumage. Plumage more than  half white is a disqualification. The dark plumage birds such as are  wanted are very likely to show considerable black or gypsy color in the  face which should be a good red. This must be selected against insofar  as possible. The nearly black or the darkest birds are quite likely to  show some white or grizzling on the head. Grizzled or brownish penciled  feathers sometimes occur in various parts of the plumage and must of  course be guarded against as the markings should be distinctly black and  white. The baby ducks of this variety are quite apt to show considerable  white although the best of them come yellowish black. This variety tends  to run a little larger in size than the white variety although the  standard weights are the same for both. Dun or chocolate colored ducks  sometimes come from Colored Muscovies while Blue Muscovies can be  produced by crossing the Colored and the white varieties.    [Illustration: FIG. 10. Upper--Colored Muscovy Drake. Notice the partly  erect crest feather on top of the head. Lower--White Muscovy Drake.  Notice the long, horizontal body and the rough or carunculated face.  (_Photographs from the Bureau of Animal Industry, U. S. Department of  Agriculture._)]    _The White Muscovy._ This variety should have pure white plumage  throughout. Young Muscovies of both sexes often have a patch of black on  top of the head up to the time they moult at maturity. Since black  disqualifies it is impossible to show young ducks in this condition but  these black feathers usually come in white after the moult and such  birds need not therefore be discarded as breeders. When it is desired to  show young White Muscovies which have black on the head it is customary  to pluck these black feathers a sufficient time before the show so that  the white feathers which come in their place will have time to grow out.  There is little or no trouble with black or gypsy face in this variety.    [Illustration: FIG. 11. Upper--Crested White Drake. Lower--Young White  Muscovy duck showing black on top of the head. This is not an unusual  occurrence and the black is lost when the bird gets its mature plumage  in the fall. (_Photographs from the Bureau of Animal Industry, U. S.  Department of Agriculture._)]    _The Blue Swedish._ In type and size this breed is about the same as the  Cayuga although perhaps slightly more upstanding. In selecting the  mating it is important to use birds which are close to standard weight  as there is somewhat of a tendency for the size to be too small. As its  name indicates the color is largely blue except for a white heart-shaped  patch or bib which should be present on the breast. Sometimes this white  extends along the underside of the body from the under-bill almost to  the vent. Such birds are undesirable as breeders since they show too  much white. On the other hand birds lacking a prominent white bib must  also be avoided. Two of the flight feathers should be white and birds  lacking these must be avoided. Guard against any red, gray or black in  any part of the plumage. Sometimes, however, birds having more or less  black throughout the plumage are used as breeders for the purpose of  strengthening the blue color. Avoid any tendency toward a ribbon on the  wing-bow and also birds that are too light, ashy or washed out in the  blue color.    Sometimes birds show lines of white feathers around the eyes and over  the head and these should be selected against as breeders as they are  likely to cause white splashing in the plumage. Yellow or greenish bills  must likewise be avoided since the first of these is a disqualification.  In general this variety in breeding behaves insofar as color is  concerned, very much like the Blue Andalusian chicken.[3] The young  ducks when hatched are yellow or creamy blue and from blue matings there  are also produced black and white ducklings. As in other colored breeds  and varieties, the dark pin feathers are somewhat of a disadvantage from  a market standpoint.    [Footnote 3: For a detailed discussion of the behaviour of the Blue  Andalusian in breeding, the reader is referred to \"The Mating and  Breeding of Poultry\" by Harry M. Lamon and Rob R. Slocum, published by  the Orange Judd Publishing Company, New York City.]    [Illustration: FIG. 12. Blue Swedish duck showing white flight feathers.  The Standard calls for only two white flights, but there is a decided  tendency as shown here for more flights to be white. (_Photograph from  the Bureau of Animal Industry, U. S. Department of Agriculture._)]    _The Crested White._ Although not so large, this breed is much like the  Pekin but with body carried more nearly horizontal and with a crest on  the head. The type varies considerably however, the principal selection  practiced having been for crest. The plumage is white in color  throughout. What is desired in the crest is to have as large a one as  possible, round and perfect in form, and set squarely on the head. Not  infrequently crooked crests occur and also double or split crests, that  is to say, where the crest is parted or divided. In some cases the  crests may even come treble, that is, split into three parts. Entire  absence of crest is by no means uncommon. In fact, it is considered a  pretty good proportion if one half of the ducks hatched have crests  although the matings vary considerably in this, occasionally one  producing practically 100% of the offspring with crests. Avoid as  breeders birds with small crests, lopped crests, split crests or showing  an absence of crest. Avoid also breeders showing mottled or green bills  in females and black bean in the bill of drakes.    _The Buff._ In type this breed is similar to the Swedish. As will be  seen from the standard weights it is one of the medium sized breeds and  makes a very nice market bird as it dresses out into a nice round fat  carcass and is a good layer. In color the birds of both sexes should be  as uniform a buff as possible except that the head and upper part of the  neck in the drake should be seal brown when in full plumage. Color  defects which are likely to be encountered and which should be avoided  are the tendency for the head of the drake to run to a chestnut color  and for his neck to be too light or faded out in color. Sometimes the  head of the drake runs too dark in color approaching a greenish black  like the head of the Rouen. This is of course undesirable. The wings of  both sexes are apt to run to light or even in some cases, pure white  flights. Blue wing bars are sometimes shown and these must be carefully  avoided. Penciling such as is found in the Fawn and White Runner  sometimes occurs and since it is a serious defect must be rigidly  guarded against. Any tendency toward a white bib or a white ring around  the neck of both sexes must likewise be avoided. Greenish or mottled  bills must be avoided in ducks which are to be used as breeders. Not  much trouble is experienced in the bill of drakes which as a rule comes  good. Any blue cast in the feathers on the rump and back of both sexes  must be selected against. As a rule the females of this breed tend to be  better colored than the males. At certain periods of the moult the head  coloring of the drakes becomes a good buff color and later when the  moult is complete, it changes to a copper color. When hatched the  ducklings are a creamy yellow.    [Illustration: FIG. 13. Pair of Buff Ducks--Drake on the right  (_Photographs from the Bureau of Animal Industry, U. S. Department of  Agriculture._)]    _The Runner._ The type of this breed is quite different from that of the  other breed of ducks and type is very important. The Runner wants to be  decidedly upstanding and to be very reachy. It should have very slim  slender lines. The neck should be straight and the head should be  carried at right angles to the neck. The bill should be perfectly  straight on top and on a line with the skull showing absolutely no  tendency to be dished. The legs of this breed are longer than those of  other ducks and this accounts for the fact that they run rather than  waddle when they move about. It is from this fact that they get their  name. They are very active and are troublesome about crawling through  fences. They are good layers and non-sitters and they have often been  called the Leghorns of the duck family. It must be remembered, however,  that while they have the inherent ability to lay as well as hens they  will do this only when they receive proper feed and care. It is quite  useless to expect a high egg yield from them when they are carelessly  fed and improperly housed and cared for. Avoid as breeders ducks of both  sexes that are too heavy behind, or in other words, are too  heavy-bottomed. Avoid birds which are too short in legs. Avoid crooked  or sharp backs. Round heads must likewise be avoided.    _The Fawn and White Runner._ In this variety the markings must be very  distinct and definite. There is a tendency which must be avoided for the  head to run to black instead of chestnut, especially in males. It is  likewise necessary to avoid females which tend to show penciling on the  sides of the breast or on the wing-bows. These defects are apt to be  associated with colored flight feathers which is also a defect to be  avoided. Guard against too much fawn extending up the neck from the body  to the head as the neck should be white"]]]
