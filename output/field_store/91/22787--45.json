Tiamat and her serpent-brood and the gods are all existent  before Merodach commences his work, and all that the god effects is a  reconstruction of the world. The method of this reconstruction possesses  no features superior to those of the Creation myths of other barbarous  nations. Our own Scandinavian ancestors had a similar one, the setting  of which was certainly not inferior to the grotesque battle of Merodach  with Tiamat. The prose Edda tells us that the first man, Bur, was the  father of Boer, who was in turn the father of Odin and his two brothers  Vili and Ve. These sons of Boer slew Ymir, the old frost giant.         \"They dragged the body of Ymir into the middle of Ginnungagap,       and of it formed the earth. From Ymir's blood they made the       sea and waters; from his flesh, the land; from his bones, the       mountains; and his teeth and jaws, together with some bits of       broken bones, served them to make the stones and pebbles.\"    It will be seen that there is a remarkable likeness between the  Babylonian and Scandinavian myths in the central and essential feature  of each, viz. the way in which the world is supposed to have been built  up by the gods from the fragments of the anatomy of a huge primaeval  monster. Yet it is not urged that there is any direct genetic connection  between the two; that the Babylonians either taught their legend to the  Scandinavians or learnt it from them.    Under ordinary circumstances it would hardly have occurred to any one to  try to derive the monotheistic narrative of Gen. i. from either of these  pagan myths, crowded as they are with uncouth and barbarous details. But  it happened that Mr. George Smith, who brought to light the Assyrian  Creation tablets, brought also to light a Babylonian account of the  Flood, which had a large number of features in common with the narrative  of Gen. vi.-ix. The actual resemblance between the two Deluge narratives  has caused a resemblance to be imagined between the two Creation  narratives. It has been well brought out in some of the later comments  of Assyriologists that, so far from there being any resemblance in the  Babylonian legend to the narrative in Genesis, the two accounts differ  _in toto_. Mr. T. G. Pinches, for example, points out that in the  Babylonian account there is--         \"No direct statement of the creation of the heavens and the       earth;         \"No systematic division of the things created into groups and       classes, such as is found in Genesis;         \"No reference to the Days of Creation;         \"No appearance of the Deity as the first and only cause of the       existence of things.\"[30:1]    Indeed, in the Babylonian account, \"the heavens and the earth are  represented as existing, though in a chaotic form, from the first.\"    Yet on this purely imaginary resemblance between the Biblical and  Babylonian Creation narratives the legend has been founded \"that the  introductory chapters of the Book of Genesis present to us the Hebrew  version of a mythology common to many of the Semitic peoples.\" And the  legend has been yet further developed, until writers of the standing of  Prof. Friedrich Delitzsch have claimed that the Genesis narrative was  _borrowed_ from the Babylonian, though \"the priestly scholar who  composed Genesis, chapter i. endeavoured of course to remove all  possible mythological features of this Creation story.\"[31:1]    If the Hebrew priest did borrow from the Babylonian myth, what was it  that he borrowed? Not the existence of sea and land, of sun and moon, of  plants and animals, of birds and beasts and fishes. For surely the  Hebrew may be credited with knowing this much of himself, without any  need for a transportation to Babylon to learn it. \"In writing an account  of the Creation, statements as to what are the things created must of  necessity be inserted,\"[31:2] whenever, wherever, and by whomsoever that  account is written.    What else, then, is there common to the two accounts? _Tiamat_ is the  name given to the Babylonian mother of the universe, the dragon of the  deep; and in Genesis it is written that \"darkness was upon the face of  the _deep_ (_teh[=o]m_).\"    Here, and here only, is a point of possible connection; but if it be  evidence of a connection, what kind of a connection does it imply? It  implies that the Babylonian based his barbarous myth upon the Hebrew  narrative. There is no other possible way of interpreting the  connection,--if connection there be.    The Hebrew word would seem to mean, etymologically, \"_surges_,\"  \"_storm-tossed waters_,\"--\"Deep calleth unto deep at the noise of Thy  waterspouts.\" Our word \"_deep_\" is apt to give us the idea of  stillness--we have the proverb, \"Still waters run deep,\"--whereas in  some instances _teh[=o]m_ is used in Scripture of waters which were  certainly shallow, as, for instance, those passed through by Israel at  the Red Sea:--         \"Pharaoh's chariots and his host hath He cast into the sea:       his chosen captains also are drowned in the Red Sea. The       _depths_ have covered them.\"    In other passages the words used in our Authorized Version, \"_deep_\" or  \"_depths_,\" give the correct signification.    But deep waters, or waters in commotion, are in either case natural  objects. We get the word _teh[=o]m_ used continually in Scripture in a  perfectly matter-of-fact way, where there is no possibility of  personification or myth being intended. Tiamat, on the contrary, the  Babylonian dragon of the waters, is a mythological personification. Now  the natural object must come first. It never yet has been the case that  a nation has gained its knowledge of a perfectly common natural object  by de-mythologizing one of the mythological personifications of another  nation. The Israelites did not learn about _teh[=o]m_, the surging water  of the Red Sea, that rolled over the Egyptians in their sight, from any  Babylonian fable of a dragon of the waters, read by their descendants  hundreds of years later.    Yet further, the Babylonian account of Creation is comparatively late;  the Hebrew account, as certainly, comparatively early. It is not merely  that the actual cuneiform tablets are of date about 700 B.C., coming as  they do from the Kouyunjik mound, the ruins of the palace of Sennacherib  and Assurbanipal, built about that date. The poem itself, as Prof. Sayce  has pointed out, indicates, by the peculiar pre-eminence given in it to  Merodach, that it is of late composition. It was late in the history of  Babylon that Merodach was adopted as the supreme deity. The astronomical  references in the poem are more conclusive still, for, as will be shown  later on, they point to a development of astronomy that cannot be dated  earlier than 700 B.C.    On the other hand, the first chapter of Genesis was composed very early.  The references to the heavenly bodies in verse 16 bear the marks of the  most primitive condition possible of astronomy. The heavenly bodies are  simply the greater light, the lesser light, and the stars--the last  being introduced quite parenthetically. It is the simplest reference to  the heavenly bodies that is made in Scripture, or that, indeed, could be  made.    There may well have been Babylonians who held higher conceptions of God  and nature than those given in the Tiamat myth. It is certain that very  many Hebrews fell short of the teaching conveyed in the first chapter of  Genesis. But the fact remains that the one nation preserved the Tiamat  myth, the other the narrative of Genesis, and each counted its own  Creation story sacred. We can only rightly judge the two nations by what  they valued. Thus judged, the Hebrew nation stands as high above the  Babylonian in intelligence, as well as in faith, as the first chapter of  Genesis is above the Tiamat myth.

CHAPTER IV    THE FIRMAMENT      The sixth verse of the first chapter of Genesis presents a difficulty as  to the precise meaning of the principal word, viz. that translated  _firmament_.         \"And God said, Let there be a _r[=a]qi[=a]`_ in the midst of       the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters. And       God made the _r[=a]qi[=a]`_, and divided the waters which were       under the _r[=a]qi[=a]`_ from the waters which were above the       _r[=a]qi[=a]`_: and it was so. And God called the       _r[=a]qi[=a]`_ _Shamayim_. And the evening and the morning       were the second day.\"    It is, of course, perfectly clear that by the word _r[=a]qi[=a]`_ in the  preceding passage it is the atmosphere that is alluded to. But later on  in the chapter the word is used in a slightly different connection. \"God  said, Let there be lights in the firmament of heaven.\"    As we look upward from the earth, we look through a twofold medium. Near  the earth we have our atmosphere; above that there is inter-stellar  space, void of anything, so far as we know, except the Ether. We are not  able to detect any line of demarcation where our atmosphere ends, and  the outer void begins. Both therefore are equally spoken of as \"the  firmament\"; and yet there is a difference between the two. The lower  supports the clouds; in the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28540"],[0,"Bibliomania; or Book-Madness (#7)"],[1," things very       memorable.\" Leland moreover tells his Majesty--that \"By his       laborious journey and costly enterprise, he had conserved       many good authors, the which otherwise had been like to have       perished; of the which, part remained in the royal palaces,       part also in his own custody, &c.\"         As Leland was engaged six years in this literary tour, so he       was occupied for a no less period of time in digesting and       arranging the prodigious number of MSS. he had collected.       But he sunk beneath the immensity of the task! The want of       amanuenses, and of other attentions and comforts, seems to       have deeply affected him; in this melancholy state, he wrote       to Archbishop Cranmer a Latin epistle, in verse, of which       the following is the commencement--very forcibly describing       his situation and anguish of mind.              Est congesta mihi domi supellex            Ingens, aurea, nobilis, venusta            Qua totus studeo Britanniarum            Vero reddere gloriam nitori.            Sed fortuna meis noverca coeptis            Jam felicibus invidet maligna.            Quare, ne pereant brevi vel hora            Multarum mihi noctium labores            Omnes----            CRANMERE, eximium decus piorum!            Implorare tuam benignitatem            Cogor.         The result was that Leland lost his senses; and, after       lingering two years in a state of total derangement, he died       on the 18th of April, 1552. \"Proh tristes rerum humanarum       vices! proh viri optimi deplorandam infelicissimamque       sortem!\" exclaims Dr. Smith, in his preface to Camden's       Life, 1691, 4to.         The precious and voluminous MSS. of Leland were doomed to       suffer a fate scarcely less pitiable than that of their       owner. After being pilfered by some, and garbled by others,       they served to replenish the pages of Stow, Lambard, Camden,       Burton, Dugdale, and many other antiquaries and historians.       Polydore Virgil, who had stolen from them pretty freely, had       the insolence to abuse Leland's memory--calling him \"a vain       glorious man;\" but what shall we say to this flippant       egotist? who, according to Caius's testimony [_De Antiq.       Cantab. head. lib._ 1.] \"to prevent a discovery of the many       errors of his own History of England, collected and burnt a       greater number of ancient histories and manuscripts than       would have loaded a waggon.\" The imperfect remains of       Leland's MSS. are now deposited in the Bodleian Library, and       in the British Museum.         Upon the whole, it must be acknowledged that Leland is a       melancholy, as well as illustrious, example of the influence       of the BIBLIOMANIA!]         [Footnote 23: In spite of BALE'S coarseness, positiveness,       and severity, he has done much towards the cause of       learning; and, perhaps, towards the propagation of the       disease under discussion. His regard for Leland does him       great honour; and although his plays are miserably dull,       notwithstanding the high prices which the original editions       of them bear, (vide ex. gr. Cat. Steevens, No. 1221;       which was sold for L12 12_s._ See also the reprints in the       Harleian Miscellany) the lover of literary antiquities must       not forget that his \"_Scriptores Britanniae_\" are yet quoted       with satisfaction by some of the most respectable writers of       the day. That he wanted delicacy of feeling, and       impartiality of investigation, must be admitted; but a       certain rough honesty and prompt benevolence which he had       about him compensated for a multitude of offences. The       abhorrence with which he speaks of the dilapidation of some       of our old libraries must endear his memory to every honest       bibliographer: \"Never (says he) had we been offended for the       loss of our LIBRARIES, being so many in number, and in so       desolate places for the more part, if the chief monuments       and most notable works of our excellent writers had been       reserved. If there had been in every shire of England, but       one SOLEMPNE LIBRARY, to the preservation of those noble       works, and preferment of good learning in our posterity, it       had been yet somewhat. But to destroy all without       consideration, is, and will be, unto England for ever, a       most horrible infamy among the grave seniors of other       nations. A great number of them which purchased those       superstitious mansions, reserved of those library-books,       some to serve the _jakes_, some to scour their candlesticks,       and some to rub their boots: some they sold to the grocers       and soap-sellers; some they sent over sea to the       book-binders, not in small number, but at times whole ships       full, to the wondering of the foreign nations. Yea, the       Universities of this realm are not all clear of this       detestable fact. But cursed is that belly which seeketh to       be fed with such ungodly gain, and shameth his natural       country. I know a merchant man, which shall at this time be       nameless, that _bought the contents of two noble libraries       for forty shillings price_; a shame it is to be spoken! This       stuff hath he occupied in the stead of grey paper, by the       space of more than ten years, and yet he hath store enough       for as many year to come!\" Bale's Preface to Leland's       \"_Laboryouse journey_, &c.\" Emprented at London by John       Bale.

They are curious and amusing. What relates to       the BIBLIOMANIA I here select from similar specimens. \"Oct.       4. At afternoon I went about the town [of Bruxelles]. I went       to the frier [Transcriber's Note: friar] Carmelites house,       and heard their even song: after, I desired to see the       LIBRARY. A frier [Transcriber's Note: friar] was sent to me,       and led me into it. There was not one good book but _Lyra_.       The friar was learned, spoke Latin readily, entered into       Greek, having a very good wit, and a greater desire to       learning. He was gentle and honest, &c.\" p. 370-1. \"Oct. 20.       to Spira: a good city. Here I first saw _Sturmius de       periodis_. I also found here _Ajax_, _Electra_, and       _Antigone Sophocles_, excellently, by my good judgment,       translated into verse, and fair printed this summer by       Gryphius. Your stationers do ill, that at least do 'not       provide you the register of all books, especially of old       authors, &c.'\" p. 372. Again: \"Hieronimus Wolfius, that       translated Demosthenes and Isocrates, is in this town. I am       well acquainted with him, and have brought him twice to my       Lord's to dinner. He looks very simple. He telleth me that       one Borrheus, that hath written well upon Aristot. priorum,       &c., even now is printing goodly commentaries upon       Aristotle's Rhetoric. But Sturmius will obscure them all.\"       p. 381.         It is impossible to read these extracts without being       convinced that Roger Ascham was a book-hunter, and infected       with the BIBLIOMANIA!]    If we are to judge from the beautiful Missal lying open before Lady  Jane Grey, in Mr. Copley's elegant picture now exhibiting at the  British Institution, it would seem rational to infer that this amiable  and learned female was slightly attacked by the disease. It is to be  taken for granted that Queen Elizabeth was not exempt from it; and  that her great Secretary,[25] Cecil, sympathised with her! In regard  to Elizabeth, her _Prayer-Book_[26] is quite evidence sufficient for  me that she found the BIBLIOMANIA irresistible! During her reign, how  vast and how frightful were the ravages of the Book-madness! If we are  to credit Laneham's celebrated Letter, it had extended far into the  country, and infected some of the worthy inhabitants of Coventry; for  one \"Captain Cox,[27] by profession a mason, and that right skilful,\"  had \"as fair a library of sciences, and as many goodly monuments both  in Prose and Poetry, and at afternoon could talk as much without book,  as any Innholder betwixt Brentford and Bagshot, what degree soever he  be!\"         [Footnote 25: It is a question which requires more time for       the solution than I am able to spare, whether CECIL'S name       stands more frequently at the head of a Dedication, in a       printed book, or of State Papers and other political       documents in MS. He was a wonderful man; but a little       infected--as I suspect--with the BOOK-DISEASE.              ----Famous Cicill, treasurer of the land,            Whose wisedom, counsell, skill of Princes state            The world admires----            The house itselfe doth shewe the owners wit,            And may for bewtie, state, and every thing,            Compared be with most within the land.              _Tale of Two Swannes_, 1590. 4_to._         I have never yet been able to ascertain whether the owner's       attachment towards VELLUM, or LARGE PAPER, Copies was the       more vehement!]         [Footnote 26: Perhaps this conclusion is too precipitate.
