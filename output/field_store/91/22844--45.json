The account of that Christmas Day of 1814 must be given in Marsden's own  words, which have already attained a classical celebrity:    \"On Sunday morning when I was upon deck, I saw the English flag flying,  which was a pleasing sight in New Zealand. I considered it as the signal  and the dawn of civilisation, liberty, and religion in a benighted land.  I never viewed the British colours with more gratification, and  flattered myself they would never be removed till the natives of that  island enjoyed all the happiness of British subjects.    \"About ten o'clock we prepared to go ashore, to publish for the first  time the glad tidings of the Gospel. I was under no apprehensions for  the safety of the vessel, and therefore ordered all on board to go on  shore to attend divine service, except the master and one man. When we  landed we found Korokoro, Ruatara, and Hongi dressed in regimentals  which Governor Macquarie had given them, with their men drawn up ready  to be marched into the enclosure to attend divine service. They had  swords by their sides, and switches in their hands. We entered the  enclosure, and were placed on the seats on each side of the pulpit.  Korokoro marched his men and placed them on my right hand, in the rear  of the Europeans; and Ruatara placed his men on the left. The  inhabitants of the town, with the women and children and a number of  other chiefs, formed a circle round the whole. A very solemn silence  prevailed: the sight was truly impressive. I rose up and began the  service with singing the Old Hundredth Psalm, and felt my very soul melt  within me when I viewed my congregation and considered the state they  were in. After reading the service, during which the natives stood up  and sat down at the signals given by Korokoro's switch, which was  regulated by the movements of the Europeans, it being Christmas Day, I  preached from the second chapter of St. Luke's Gospel, and tenth verse,  'Behold, I bring you glad tidings of great joy,' etc. The natives told  Ruatara that they could not understand what I meant. He replied that  they were not to mind that now, for they would understand by and by, and  that he would explain my meaning as far as he could. When I had done  preaching, he informed them what I had been talking about. Ruatara was  very much pleased that he had been able to make all necessary  preparations for the performance of divine worship in so short a time,  and we felt much obliged to him for his attention. He was extremely  anxious to convince us that he would do everything in his power, and  that the good of his country was his principal consideration. In this  manner the Gospel has been introduced into New Zealand, and I fervently  pray that the glory of it may never depart from its inhabitants till  time shall be no more.\"    For the moment it seemed as though Marsden's congregation had not been  very deeply impressed. Three or four hundred natives (says Nicholas)  began a furious war-dance, apparently to express gratitude and  appreciation. With conflicting feelings the missionaries at length  withdrew to their ship, and there, in the evening, Marsden \"administered  the Holy Sacrament in remembrance of our Saviour's birth and what He had  done and suffered for us.\"    What would be the reflections of this far-sighted man as he lay in his  berth that summer night? Fresh from the scene of the _Boyd_ tragedy, and  in the very presence of Te Pahi's desolated citadel, he had ventured to  take up the angels' song of peace on earth, goodwill to men. He might  perhaps have drawn some hope from the peace which the world at large was  then enjoying after years of desperate strife. Napoleon was a prisoner  in Elba, and the dogs of war were chained. But a few more months would  bring another outburst and the awful carnage of Waterloo. So would it be  in New Zealand also, and its Napoleon was a small quiet man who stood  listening thoughtfully on that Christmas Day to Marsden's message of  peace.    The planting of the settlement occupied the next fortnight. By the  second Sunday in the new year a large building was sufficiently advanced  to serve as a church. In a few days more this was divided into separate  apartments for the residence of the mission families.    Marsden was now at liberty to think of certain subordinate objects of  his visit--exploration and trade. In obedience to the Governor's  instructions, he took his brig on an exploring tour down the Hauraki  Gulf. On his return he had the vessel loaded with timber and flax for  conveyance to New South Wales. The expedition had, of course, been an  expensive matter, and it must be remembered that he had strained his own  private resources to provide means for its equipment. He had all along  looked to recoup himself for some of his outlay by a trade in logs and  spars. By the middle of February the vessel had received her cargo, the  missionaries were settling down in their new home, and his leave of  absence was nearing its expiration. But before he set sail two duties  claimed his attention. A child had been born to Mr. and Mrs. King, and  Marsden determined to make the first administration of Holy Baptism in  this heathen land as impressive as possible. The infant was brought out  into the open air. Many of the Maoris as well as the white folk stood  around while the little one was solemnly admitted into the congregation  of Christ's flock.    The other duty was less pleasant, and called for all the missionary's  skill and resource. Poor Ruatara had fallen ill in the hour of his  triumph--a victim, it would seem, to his admiration for the white man's  ways. At the service on Sunday, February 12th, he had been present in  European clothes, which had set off to advantage his manly form and  European-like features. The day was rainy, and probably he had gone home  in his wet clothes and thus contracted pneumonia. On the next day he was  suffering from a chill and fever which defied the kindly attentions of  Nicholas, who visited him daily until the _tohunga_ forbad his  admission. When Marsden returned from his trading enterprise he could  only force an entrance by threatening to bombard the town with the  ship's guns. The invalid seemed grateful for his visit and rallied for a  little time, but as soon as Marsden sailed for Australia he grew rapidly  worse. On the third day he was carried from his home and deposited on  the top of a bare hill to await his end. Ruatara has been often compared  with the Russian Peter, and like him he had purposed to build a new town  in which he could carry out the ideas he had gained abroad. It was to  the site of this projected metropolis that he was now borne, and it was  there that, after death, his body was laid on a stage erected for the  purpose. To complete the tragedy the same stage received the remains of  his favourite wife, who hung herself out of grief at her loss.    In spite of this noble Maori's enlightened efforts for the civilisation  of his countrymen, his mind seems to have been not wholly without  misgiving as to the possible consequences of his policy. He could not  altogether throw off the suggestions of the reactionary party, that the  coming of the white man would eventually lead to the slavery and  dispossession of the Maori. Could he look down from his lofty eminence  now that a century has passed, what would be his thoughts? He would see  his countrymen still residing on their own lands, their children  carefully taught, their houses fitted with mechanical appliances which  would have surprised even Marsden himself. But, on the other hand, the  crowded _pas_ and the vigorous life have passed away. Instead of the  long canoe with its stalwart tatooed rowers, he would see perhaps a  small motor-boat with one half-caste engineer. As for his \"town of  Rangihoo,\" he would see no trace of its existence. Maori dwellings,  mission-station--all are gone. Nothing now remains to show that man has  ever occupied the spot, save the rose-covered graves of one or two of  the original \"settlers,\" and the lofty stone cross which marks the place  where Christ was first preached on New Zealand soil.          CHAPTER III.    THE RECEPTION.    (1815-1822).      He that soweth discord among brethren.      --_Proverbs._      The position of the missionaries when left alone at Rangihoua was not an  easy one. Ruatara was dead, and there was no one to fill his place. His  successor at Rangihoua, though friendly and genial, seems to have had  but little influence. Korokoro cared for nothing but war. The real ruler  was Ruatara's uncle, Hongi, who lived some miles away; and Hongi's  character had yet to disclose itself. His behaviour was quiet and  gentlemanly; he assured the missionaries of his protection, and he kept  his word.    This protection, however, was subject to limitations. The settlers were  naturally anxious to grow corn and vegetables, but the cold clay of Te  Puna[1] was not a favourable soil. At the very beginning some of them  had pleaded for a more fertile spot, but their sagacious leader had set  his veto on the proposal. Not many months, however, after Marsden's  departure, Kendall and Hall crossed the Bay to a sunny spot at the mouth  of the Waitangi River. Here they bought 50 acres of fertile land, and  thither Hall transferred his family. He soon saw around him a prolific  growth of maize and vegetables, but just as he was congratulating  himself on the wisdom of the move, a scene occurred which quickly  altered his views. He was felled to the ground by a savage visitor who  brandished an axe over his head, and he struggled to his feet only to  behold his wife's countenance suffused with blood from a smashing blow  dealt her by another ruffian."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31425"],[0,"Report of the Decision of the Supreme Court of the United States, and the (#7)"],[1,"of the word, confined to persons born in a  foreign country, under a foreign Government. It is not a power to  raise to the rank of a citizen any one born in the United States, who,  from birth or parentage, by the laws of the country, belongs to an  inferior and subordinate class. And when we find the States guarding  themselves from the indiscreet or improper admission by other States  of emigrants from other countries, by giving the power exclusively to  Congress, we cannot fail to see that they could never have left with  the States a much more important power--that is, the power of  transforming into citizens a numerous class of persons, who in that  character would be much more dangerous to the peace and safety of a  large portion of the Union, than the few foreigners one of the States  might improperly naturalize. The Constitution upon its adoption  obviously took from the States all power by any subsequent legislation  to introduce as a citizen into the political family of the United  States any one, no matter where he was born, or what might be his  character or condition; and it gave to Congress the power to confer  this character upon those only who were born outside of the dominions  of the United States. And no law of a State, therefore, passed since  the Constitution was adopted, can give any right of citizenship  outside of its own territory.    A clause similar to the one in the Constitution, in relation to the  rights and immunities of citizens of one State in the other States,  was contained in the Articles of Confederation. But there is a  difference of language, which is worthy of note. The provision in the  Articles of Confederation was, \"that the _free inhabitants_ of each of  the States, paupers, vagabonds, and fugitives from justice, excepted,  should be entitled to all the privileges and immunities of free  citizens in the several States.\"    It will be observed, that under this Confederation, each State had the  right to decide for itself, and in its own tribunals, whom it would  acknowledge as a free inhabitant of another State. The term _free  inhabitant_, in the generality of its terms, would certainly include  one of the African race who had been manumitted. But no example, we  think, can be found of his admission to all the privileges of  citizenship in any State of the Union after these Articles were  formed, and while they continued in force. And, notwithstanding the  generality of the words \"free inhabitants,\" it is very clear that,  according to their accepted meaning in that day, they did not include  the African race, whether free or not: for the fifth section of the  ninth article provides that Congress should have the power \"to agree  upon the number of land forces to be raised, and to make requisitions  from each State for its quota in proportion to the number of _white_  inhabitants in such State, which requisition should be binding.\"    Words could hardly have been used which more strongly mark the line of  distinction between the citizen and the subject; the free and the  subjugated races. The latter were not even counted when the  inhabitants of a State were to be embodied in proportion to its  numbers for the general defence. And it cannot for a moment be  supposed, that a class of persons thus separated and rejected from  those who formed the sovereignty of the States, were yet intended to  be included under the words \"free inhabitants,\" in the preceding  article, to whom privileges and immunities were so carefully secured  in every State.    But although this clause of the Articles of Confederation is the same  in principle with that inserted in the Constitution, yet the  comprehensive word _inhabitant_, which might be construed to include  an emancipated slave, is omitted; and the privilege is confined to  _citizens_ of the State. And this alteration in words would hardly  have been made, unless a different meaning was intended to be  conveyed, or a possible doubt removed. The just and fair inference is,  that as this privilege was about to be placed under the protection of  the General Government, and the words expounded by its tribunals, and  all power in relation to it taken from the State and its courts, it  was deemed prudent to describe with precision and caution the persons  to whom this high privilege was given--and the word _citizen_ was on  that account substituted for the words _free inhabitant_. The word  citizen excluded, and no doubt intended to exclude, foreigners who had  not become citizens of some one of the States when the Constitution  was adopted; and also every description of persons who were not fully  recognised as citizens in the several States. This, upon any fair  construction of the instruments to which we have referred, was  evidently the object and purpose of this change of words.    To all this mass of proof we have still to add, that Congress has  repeatedly legislated upon the same construction of the Constitution  that we have given. Three laws, two of which were passed almost  immediately after the Government went into operation, will be  abundantly sufficient to show this. The two first are particularly  worthy of notice, because many of the men who assisted in framing the  Constitution, and took an active part in procuring its adoption, were  then in the halls of legislation, and certainly understood what they  meant when they used the words \"people of the United States\" and  \"citizen\" in that well-considered instrument.    The first of these acts is the naturalization law, which was passed at  the second session of the first Congress, March 26, 1790, and confines  the right of becoming citizens \"_to aliens being free white persons_.\"    Now, the Constitution does not limit the power of Congress in this  respect to white persons. And they may, if they think proper,  authorize the naturalization of any one, of any color, who was born  under allegiance to another Government. But the language of the law  above quoted, shows that citizenship at that time was perfectly  understood to be confined to the white race; and that they alone  constituted the sovereignty in the Government.    Congress might, as we before said, have authorized the naturalization  of Indians, because they were aliens and foreigners. But, in their  then untutored and savage state, no one would have thought of  admitting them as citizens in a civilized community. And, moreover,  the atrocities they had but recently committed, when they were the  allies of Great Britain in the Revolutionary war, were yet fresh in  the recollection of the people of the United States, and they were  even then guarding themselves against the threatened renewal of Indian  hostilities. No one supposed then that any Indian would ask for, or  was capable of enjoying, the privileges of an American citizen, and  the word white was not used with any particular reference to them.    Neither was it used with any reference to the African race imported  into or born in this country; because Congress had no power to  naturalize them, and therefore there was no necessity for using  particular words to exclude them.    It would seem to have been used merely because it followed out the  line of division which the Constitution has drawn between the citizen  race, who formed and held the Government, and the African race, which  they held in subjection and slavery, and governed at their own  pleasure.    Another of the early laws of which we have spoken, is the first  militia law, which was passed in 1792, at the first session of the  second Congress. The language of this law is equally plain and  significant with the one just mentioned. It directs that every \"free  able-bodied white male citizen\" shall be enrolled in the militia. The  word _white_ is evidently used to exclude the African race, and the  word \"citizen\" to exclude unnaturalized foreigners; the latter forming  no part of the sovereignty, owing it no allegiance, and therefore  under no obligation to defend it. The African race, however, born in  the country, did owe allegiance to the Government, whether they were  slave or free; but it is repudiated, and rejected from the duties and  obligations of citizenship in marked language.    The third act to which we have alluded is even still more decisive; it  was passed as late as 1813, (2 Stat., 809,) and it provides: \"That  from and after the termination of the war in which the United States  are now engaged with Great Britain, it shall not be lawful to employ,  on board of any public or private vessels of the United States, any  person or persons except citizens of the United States, _or_ persons  of color, natives of the United States.\"    Here the line of distinction is drawn in express words. Persons of  color, in the judgment of Congress, were not included in the word  citizens, and they are described as another and different class of  persons, and authorized to be employed, if born in the United States.    And even as late as 1820, (chap. 104, sec. 8,) in the charter to the  city of Washington, the corporation is authorized \"to restrain and  prohibit the nightly and other disorderly meetings of slaves, free  negroes, and mulattoes,\" thus associating them together in its  legislation; and after prescribing the punishment that may be  inflicted on the slaves, proceeds in the following words: \"And to  punish such free negroes and mulattoes by penalties not exceeding  twenty dollars for any one offence; and in case of the inability of  any such free negro or mulatto to pay any such penalty and cost  thereon, to cause him or her to be confined to labor for any time not  exceeding six calendar months.\" And in a subsequent part of the same  section, the act authorizes the corporation \"to prescribe the terms  and conditions upon which free negroes and mulattoes may reside in the  city.\"    This law, like the laws of the States, shows that this class of  persons were governed by special"]]]
