It is unfortunate that there has in the past been some  tendency to consider elaborate drainage provisions less necessary  where rigid types of surfaces were employed. It has become apparent,  from the nature of the defects observed in all sorts of road surfaces,  that to neglect or minimize the importance of drainage in connection  with either earth roads or any class of surfaced roads is to invite  rapid deterioration of some sections of the roadway surface and to add  to maintenance costs.    The degree to which lack of drainage provisions affect the  serviceability of the road surface varies with the amount of  precipitation in the locality and the manner in which it is  distributed throughout the year. In the humid areas of the United  States, which are, roughly, those portions east of a north and south  line passing through Omaha and Kansas City, together with the northern  part of the Pacific slope, precipitation is generally in excess of 30  inches per year and fairly well distributed throughout the year, but  with seasonal variations in rate. In these areas, the effect of the  precipitation, both as regards its tendency to lower the stability of  soils and as an eroding agent, must be carefully provided against in  highway design.    Outside of the areas mentioned above, the precipitation is much less  than 30 inches per year and its effect as an agent of erosion is of  greatest significance, although in restricted areas there may be short  periods when the soil is made unstable by ground water.    =Importance of Design.=--The drainage system for a proposed road  improvement ought to be designed with as much care as any other  element, and, to do so, a study must be made of all factors that have  any bearing on the drainage requirements and the probable  effectiveness of the proposed drainage system. The well established  principles of land drainage should be followed so far as applicable.    The basic principle of road drainage is to minimize the effect of  water to such an extent that there will always be a layer of  comparatively dry soil of appreciable thickness under the traveled  part of the road. This layer should probably never be less than two  feet thick and for soils of a structure favorable to capillary action  it should be at least three feet thick. The means employed to  accomplish the requisite drainage will be as various as the conditions  encountered.    =Surface Drainage.=--The drainage method which is by far the most  nearly general in application is that which utilizes open ditches, and  the system which employs these ditches is usually referred to as  surface drainage. The full possibilities of this method of minimizing  the effects of storm water are rarely fully utilized in road  construction. Very frequently, deterioration of a road surface is  directly attributable to failure to provide adequately for the removal  of the storm water or water from the melting of snow that has fallen  on the road, or water that flows to the road from land adjacent  thereto. Surface water can usually most cheaply and expeditiously be  carried away in open ditches, although special conditions are  occasionally encountered which require supplementary tile drains. The  cross section commonly adopted for roads lends itself naturally to the  construction of drainage ditches at the sides of the traveled way, and  these are usually the principal dependence for the disposal of storm  water.    =Run-off.=--The capacity required of side ditches to insure  satisfactory surface drainage will be affected by the amount and  nature of the precipitation in the region where the road is built. The  annual rainfall in a region may amount to several feet, but may be  well distributed throughout the year with an absence of excessive  rainfall for short periods, that is, flood conditions may rarely  occur. In other areas, the annual rainfall may be comparatively small  but the precipitation occurs at a very high rate, that is, flood  conditions may be common, or it may be at a low rate extending over a  considerable period. These peculiarities must be known before an  adequate drainage system can be planned.    It is almost universally true in the United States that precipitation  at a very high rate will be for a relatively short duration, and  during these short periods, which usually do not exceed thirty  minutes, a portion of the water that falls on the areas adjacent to  the road and that drains to the road ditches will soak into the soil  and therefore not reach the ditches along the road. The extent to  which the water is taken up by the soil will vary with the porosity  and slope of the land and the character of the growth thereon.  Cultivated land will absorb nearly all of the water from showers up to  fifteen or twenty minutes duration; grass land a somewhat smaller  percentage; and hard baked or other impervious soil will absorb a  comparatively small amount. Rocky ground and steep slopes will absorb  very little storm water.    The surface of the road is designed to turn water rapidly to the  ditches, but when the material is the natural soil, there is always  considerable absorption of storm water. Surfaces such as sandclay,  gravel and macadam do not absorb to exceed 10 per cent of the  precipitation during short showers. Bituminous surfaces, brick and  concrete pavements, do not absorb an appreciable amount of storm  water.    Generally it is best to assume that if a rain lasts for forty-five  minutes or more, all of the water will run off, as the soil will reach  a state of saturation in that time. This is not true of deep sand, but  is for nearly all other soils.    The ditch capacity needed will therefore depend upon the area drained,  the character of the soil, the slopes and the rainfall characteristics  of the region, and upon the nature of the road surface.    For a required capacity, the cross section area of the ditch will vary  inversely as the grade, because the velocity of flow increases with an  increase in the grade of the ditch. If the surface water must be  carried along the road for distances exceeding five or six hundred  feet, the ditch must be constructed of increasing capacity toward the  outlet in order to accommodate the accumulated volume of water.    The velocity of flow varies not only with the grade, but with the  shape of the cross section, cleanness of the channel, the depth of the  water in the channel, alignment of the channel and the kind of  material in which the channel is formed. It is not necessary to go to  great refinement in the design of the side ditches for the ordinary  case where the water is carried along the road for only a few hundred  feet. The ditches are made of ample capacity by using the commonly  accepted cross section for a road, which will be discussed in a later  paragraph. But where large areas must be drained by the road ditches,  it is desirable carefully to design the side ditches. The basis for  that design is too lengthy to be included herein, and reference should  be made to a standard treatise on the subject.    =Ordinary Design of Ditches.=--For grades of one per cent or less on  roads in the humid area, the bottom of the ditch should be at least  three and one-half feet lower than the traveled surface of the road,  except for very sandy soil. For grades greater than one per cent, this  depth may be decreased one foot, and for grades of four per cent and  upward, the depth may be still less. These general rules for depth are  susceptible of variation but are believed to be the minimum except in  arid or semi-arid climates. It is far better to be too liberal in  ditch allowance than to be too conservative. In arid or semi-arid  regions, the ditch design will be based on the necessity of providing  for flood flow and preventing damage through erosion. Ordinary  drainage requirements will be satisfactory with the ditch about one  foot deep.    If the topography is such that it is evident considerable storm water  will flow from the adjacent land to the road ditches, the design must  be modified to take this into account. Sometimes such water can be  diverted by ditches well back from the road, and thus prevented from  flowing into the side ditches along the roadway. It is especially  desirable to divert water, which would otherwise flow down the slope  of a cut, by means of a ditch on the hill-side above the upper edge of  the slope of the cut.    Ditches are not effective unless they afford a free flow throughout  their length and have an outlet to a drainage channel of ample  capacity. Therefore, ditch grades should be established by survey,  especially if the gradient is less than one per cent, and the  construction work should be checked to insure that the ditch is  actually constructed as planned. A few high places in the ditch will  greatly reduce the effectiveness, although these may appear at the  time of construction to be slight. Constricted places, such as might  be due to a small amount of loose earth left in the ditch, are always  to be avoided.    Where the side ditch passes from a cut to the berm alongside a fill,  the ditch should be excavated throughout in the undisturbed natural  soil, five feet or more from the toe of the slope of the fill, and  along the filled portion of the road there should be a berm of three  or four feet between the toe of the slope of the fill and the near  edge of the ditch.    =Underground Water.=--In a preceding paragraph, mention was made of  the fact that only a part of the storm water runs off over the surface  of the ground, the larger part being absorbed by the soil. The water  thus absorbed flows downward through the pores in the soil until it is"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29444"],[0,"The Machinery of the Universe: Mechanical Conceptions of Physical Phenomena (#7)"],[1,"  Nevertheless, if an atom be the embodiment of energy, there must have  been energy in the ether before any atom existed. One of the properties  of the ether is its ability to distribute energy in certain ways, but  there is no evidence that of itself it ever transforms energy. Once a  given kind of energy is in it, it does not change; hence for the  apparition of a form of energy, like the first vortex-ring, there must  have been not only energy, but some other agency capable of transforming  that energy into a permanent structure. To the best of our knowledge  to-day, the ether would be absolutely helpless. Such energy as was  active in forming atoms must be called by another name than what is  appropriate for such transformations as occur when, for instance, the  mechanical energy of a bullet is transformed into heat when the target  is struck. Behind the ether must be assumed some agency, directing and  controlling energy in a manner totally different from any agency, which  is operative in what we call physical science. Nothing short of what is  called a miracle will do--an event without a physical antecedent in any  way necessarily related to its factors, as is the fact of a stone  related to gravity or heat to an electric current.    Ether energy is an endowment instead of being an embodiment, and implies  antecedents of a super-physical kind.      12. MATTER IS AN ENERGY TRANSFORMER.    As each different kind of energy represents some specific form of  motion, and _vice versa_, some sort of mechanism is needful for  transforming one kind into another, therefore molecular structure of  one kind or another is essential. The transformation is a mechanical  process, and matter in some particular and appropriate form is the  condition of its taking place. If heat appears, then its antecedent has  been some other form of motion acting upon the substance heated. It may  have been the mechanical motion of another mass of matter, as when a  bullet strikes a target and becomes heated; or it may be friction, as  when a car-axle heats when run without proper oiling to reduce friction;  or it may be condensation, as when tinder is ignited by condensing the  air about it; or chemical reactions, when molecular structure is changed  as in combustion, or an electrical current, which implies a dynamo and  steam-engine or water-power. If light appears, its antecedent has been  impact or friction, condensation or chemical action, and if electricity  appears the same sort of antecedents are present. Whether the one or the  other of these forms of energy is developed, depends upon what kind of a  structure the antecedent energy has acted upon. If radiant energy,  so-called, falls upon a mass of matter, what is absorbed is at once  transformed into heat or into electric or magnetic effects; _which_ one  of these depends upon the character of the mechanism upon which the  radiant energy acts, but the radiant energy itself, which consists of  ether-waves, is traceable back in every case to a mass of matter having  definite characteristic motions.    One may therefore say with certainty that every physical phenomenon is a  change in the direction, or velocity, or character, of the energy  present, and such change has been produced by matter acting as a  transformer.      THE ETHER IS A NON-TRANSFORMER.    It has already been said that the absence of friction in the ether  enables light-waves to maintain their identity for an indefinite time,  and to an indefinitely great distance. In a uniform, homogeneous  substance of any kind, any kind of energy which might be in it would  continue in it without any change. Uniformity and homogeneity imply  similarity throughout, and the necessary condition for transformation is  unlikeness. One might not look for any kind of physical phenomenon which  was not due to the presence and activity of some heterogeneity.    As a ray of light continues a ray of light so long as it exists in free  ether, so all kinds of radiations, of whatever wave-length, continue  identical until they fall upon some mechanical structure called matter.  Translatory motion continues translatory, rotary continues rotary, and  vibratory continues to be vibratory, and no transforming change can  take place in the absence of matter. The ether is helpless.      13. MATTER IS ELASTIC.    It is commonly stated that certain substances, like putty and dough, are  inelastic, while some other substances, like glass, steel, and wood, are  elastic. This quality of elasticity, as manifested in such different  degrees, depends upon molecular combinations; some of which, as in glass  and steel, are favourable for exhibiting it, while others mask it, for  the ultimate atoms of all kinds are certainly highly elastic.    The measure of elasticity in a mass of matter is the velocity with which  a wave-motion will be transmitted through it. Thus the elasticity of the  air determines the velocity of sound in it. If the air be heated, the  elasticity is increased and the sound moves faster. The rates of such  sound-conduction range from a few feet in a second to about 16,000, five  times swifter than a cannon ball. In such elastic bodies as vibrate to  and fro like the prongs of a tuning-fork, or give sounds of a definite  pitch, the rate of vibration is determined by the size and shape of the  body as well as by their elementary composition. The smaller a body is,  the higher its vibratory rate, if it be made of the same material and  the form remains the same. Thus a tuning-fork, that may be carried in  the waistcoat-pocket, may vibrate 500 times a second. If it were only  the fifty-millionth of an inch in size, but of the same material and  form, it would vibrate 30,000,000000 times a second; and if it were made  of ether, instead of steel, it would vibrate as many times faster as the  velocity of waves in the ether is greater than it is in steel, and would  be as many as 400,000000,000000 times per second. The amount of  displacement, or the amplitude of vibration, with the pocket-fork might  be no more than the hundredth of an inch, and this rate measured as  translation velocity would be but five inches per second. If the fork  were of atomic magnitude, and should swing its sides one half the  diameter of the atom, or say the hundred-millionth of an inch, the  translational velocity would be equivalent to about eighty miles a  second, or a hundred and fifty times the velocity of a cannon ball,  which may be reckoned at about 3000 feet.    That atoms really vibrate at the above rate per second is very certain,  for their vibrations produce ether-waves the length of which may be  accurately measured. When a tuning-fork vibrates 500 times a second, and  the sound travels 1100 feet in the same interval, the length of each  wave will be found by dividing the velocity in the air by the number of  vibrations, or 1100 / 500 = 2.2 feet. In like manner, when one knows  the velocity and wave-length, he may compute the number of vibrations by  dividing the velocity by the wave-length. Now the velocity of the waves  called light is 186,000 miles a second, and a light-wave may be one  forty thousandth of an inch long. The atom that produces the wave must  be vibrating as many times per second as the fifth thousandth of an inch  is contained in 186,000 miles. Reducing this number to inches we have    186,000 x 5280 x 12  ------------------- = 400,000,000,000,000, nearly.        1/40,000    This shows that the atoms are minute elastic bodies that change their  form rapidly when struck. As rapid as the change is, yet the rate of  movement is only one-fifth that of a comet when near the sun, and is  therefore easily comparable with other velocities observed in masses of  matter.    These vibratory motions, due to the elasticity of the atoms, is what  constitutes heat.      THE ETHER IS ELASTIC.    The elasticity of a mass of matter is its ability to recover its  original form after that form has been distorted. There is implied that  a stress changes its shape and dimensions, which in turn implies a  limited mass and relative change of position of parts and some degree  of discontinuity. From what has been said of the ether as being  unlimited, continuous, and not made of atoms or molecules, it will be  seen how difficult, if not impossible, it is to conceive how such a  property as elasticity, as manifested in matter, can be attributed to  the ether, which is incapable of deformation, either in structure or  form, the latter being infinitely extended in every direction and  therefore formless. Nevertheless, certain forms of motion, such as  light-waves, move in it with definite velocity, quite independent of how  they originate. This velocity of 186,000 miles a second so much exceeds  any movement of a mass of matter that the motions can hardly be  compared. Thus if 400 miles per second be the swiftest speed of any mass  of matter known--that of a comet near the sun--the ether-wave moves  186,000 / 400 = 465 times faster than such comet, and 900,000 times  faster than sound travels in air. It is clear that if this rate of  motion depends upon elasticity, the elasticity must be of an entirely  different type from that belonging to matter, and cannot be defined in  any such terms as are employed for matter.    If one considers gravitative phenomena, the difficulty is enormously  increased. The orbit of a planet is never an exact ellipse,  on account of the perturbations produced by the planetary  attractions--perturbations which depend upon the direction and distance  of the attracting bodies. These, however, are so well known that slight  deviations are easily noticed. If gravitative attraction took any such  appreciable time to go from one astronomical body to another as does  light, it would make very considerable differences in the paths of the  planets and the earth. Indeed, if the velocity of gravitation were less  than a million times"]]]
