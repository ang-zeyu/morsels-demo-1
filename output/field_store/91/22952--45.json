There we shall hear the chant of birds, have sight of  verdant hills and plains, of cornfields undulating like the sea, of trees of  a thousand sorts; there also we shall have a larger view of the heavens,  which, however harsh to usward yet deny not their eternal beauty; things  fairer far for eye to rest on than the desolate walls of our city. Moreover,  we shall there breathe a fresher air, find ampler store of things meet for  such as live in these times, have fewer causes of annoy. For, though the  husbandmen die there, even as here the citizens, they are dispersed in  scattered homesteads, and 'tis thus less painful to witness. Nor, so far as  I can see, is there a soul here whom we shall desert; rather we may truly  say, that we are ourselves deserted; for, our kinsfolk being either dead or  fled in fear of death, no more regardful of us than if we were strangers, we  are left alone in our great affliction. No censure, then, can fall on us if  we do as I propose; and otherwise grievous suffering, perhaps death, may  ensue. Wherefore, if you agree, 'tis my advice, that, attended by our maids  with all things needful, we sojourn, now on this, now on the other estate,  and in such way of life continue, until we see--if death should not first  overtake us--the end which Heaven reserves for these events. And I remind  you that it will be at least as seemly in us to leave with honour, as in  others, of whom there are not a few, to stay with dishonour.\"    The other ladies praised Pampinea's plan, and indeed were so prompt to  follow it, that they had already begun to discuss the manner in some detail,  as if they were forthwith to rise from their seats and take the road, when  Filomena, whose judgment was excellent, interposed, saying:--\"Ladies, though  Pampinea has spoken to most excellent effect, yet it were not well to be so  precipitate as you seem disposed to be. Bethink you that we are all women;  nor is there any here so young, but she is of years to understand how women  are minded towards one another, when they are alone together, and how ill  they are able to rule themselves without the guidance of some man. We are  sensitive, perverse, suspicious, pusillanimous and timid; wherefore I much  misdoubt, that, if we find no other guidance than our own, this company is  like to break up sooner, and with less credit to us, than it should. Against  which it were well to provide at the outset.\" Said then Elisa:--\"Without  doubt man is woman's head, and, without man's governance, it is seldom that  aught that we do is brought to a commendable conclusion. But how are we to  come by the men? Every one of us here knows that her kinsmen are for the  most part dead, and that the survivors are dispersed, one here, one there,  we know not where, bent each on escaping the same fate as ourselves; nor  were it seemly to seek the aid of strangers; for, as we are in quest of  health, we must find some means so to order matters that, wherever we seek  diversion or repose, trouble and scandal do not follow us.\"    While the ladies were thus conversing, there came into the church three  young men, young, I say, but not so young that the age of the youngest was  less than twenty-five years; in whom neither the sinister course of events,  nor the loss of friends or kinsfolk, nor fear for their own safety, had  availed to quench, or even temper, the ardour of their love. The first was  called Pamfilo, the second Filostrato, and the third Dioneo. Very debonair  and chivalrous were they all; and in this troublous time they were seeking  if haply, to their exceeding great solace, they might have sight of their  fair friends, all three of whom chanced to be among the said seven ladies,  besides some that were of kin to the young men. At one and the same moment  they recognised the ladies and were recognised by them: wherefore, with a  gracious smile, Pampinea thus began:--\"Lo, fortune is propitious to our  enterprise, having vouchsafed us the good offices of these young men, who  are as gallant as they are discreet, and will gladly give us their guidance  and escort, so we but take them into our service.\" Whereupon Neifile,  crimson from brow to neck with the blush of modesty, being one of those that  had a lover among the young men, said:--\"For God's sake, Pampinea, have a  care what you say. Well assured am I that nought but good can be said of any  of them, and I deem them fit for office far more onerous than this which you  propose for them, and their good and honourable company worthy of ladies  fairer by far and more tenderly to be cherished than such as we. But 'tis no  secret that they love some of us here; wherefore I misdoubt that, if we take  them with us, we may thereby give occasion for scandal and censure merited  neither by us nor by them.\" \"That,\" said Filomena, \"is of no consequence; so  I but live honestly, my conscience gives me no disquietude; if others  asperse me, God and the truth will take arms in my defence. Now, should they  be disposed to attend us, of a truth we might say with Pampinea, that  fortune favours our enterprise.\" The silence which followed betokened  consent on the part of the other ladies, who then with one accord resolved  to call the young men, and acquaint them with their purpose, and pray them  to be of their company. So without further parley Pampinea, who had a  kinsman among the young men, rose and approached them where they stood  intently regarding them; and greeting them gaily, she opened to them their  plan, and besought them on the part of herself and her friends to join their  company on terms of honourable and fraternal comradeship. At first the young  men thought she did but trifle with them; but when they saw that she was in  earnest, they answered with alacrity that they were ready, and promptly,  even before they left the church, set matters in train for their departure.  So all things meet being first sent forward in due order to their intended  place of sojourn, the ladies with some of their maids, and the three young  men, each attended by a man-servant, sallied forth of the city on the  morrow, being Wednesday, about daybreak, and took the road; nor had they  journeyed more than two short miles when they arrived at their destination.  The estate (2) lay upon a little hill some distance from the nearest  highway, and, embowered in shrubberies of divers hues, and other greenery,  afforded the eye a pleasant prospect. On the summit of the hill was a palace  with galleries, halls and chambers, disposed around a fair and spacious  court, each very fair in itself, and the goodlier to see for the gladsome  pictures with which it was adorned; the whole set amidst meads and gardens  laid out with marvellous art, wells of the coolest water, and vaults of the  finest wines, things more suited to dainty drinkers than to sober and  honourable women. On their arrival the company, to their no small delight,  found their beds already made, the rooms well swept and garnished with  flowers of every sort that the season could afford, and the floors carpeted  with rushes. When they were seated, Dioneo, a gallant who had not his match  for courtesy and wit, spoke thus:--\"My ladies, 'tis not our forethought so  much as your own mother-wit that has guided us hither. How you mean to  dispose of your cares I know not; mine I left behind me within the city-gate  when I issued thence with you a brief while ago. Wherefore, I pray you,  either address yourselves to make merry, to laugh and sing with me (so far,  I mean, as may consist with your dignity), or give me leave to hie me back  to the stricken city, there to abide with my cares.\" To whom blithely  Pampinea replied, as if she too had cast off all her cares:--\"Well sayest  thou, Dioneo, excellent well; gaily we mean to live; 'twas a refuge from  sorrow that here we sought, nor had we other cause to come hither. But, as  no anarchy can long endure, I who initiated the deliberations of which this  fair company is the fruit, do now, to the end that our joy may be lasting,  deem it expedient, that there be one among us in chief authority, honoured  and obeyed by us as our superior, whose exclusive care it shall be to devise  how we may pass our time blithely. And that each in turn may prove the  weight of the care, as well as enjoy the pleasure, of sovereignty, and, no  distinction being made of sex, envy be felt by none by reason of exclusion  from the office; I propose, that the weight and honour be borne by each one  for a day; and let the first to bear sway be chosen by us all, those that  follow to be appointed towards the vesper hour by him or her who shall have  had the signory for that day; and let each holder of the signory be, for the  time, sole arbiter of the place and manner in which we are to pass our  time.\"    Pampinea's speech was received with the utmost applause, and with one accord  she was chosen queen for the first day. Whereupon Filomena hied her lightly  to a bay-tree, having often heard of the great honour in which its leaves,  and such as were deservedly crowned therewith, were worthy to be holden; and  having gathered a few sprays, she made thereof a goodly wreath of honour,  and set it on Pampinea's head; which wreath was thenceforth, while their  company endured, the visible sign of the wearer's sway and sovereignty.    No sooner was Queen Pampinea crowned than she bade all be silent. She then  caused summon to her presence their four maids, and the servants of the  three young men, and, all keeping silence, said to them:--\"That I may shew  you all at once, how, well still giving place to better, our company may"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37329"],[0,"The Domestic Cat (#7)"],[1,"be small,  round, and sweet, the expression of the countenance being singularly  kind and loving.  The heads of the tabbies ought to be broad and large,  and not snouty.  The whiskers of both ought to be very long, and of a  colour to match the general tone.  The ears have this peculiarity--they  are slightly bent downwards and forwards, which gives rather a pensive  character to their beauty.  They are, moreover, graced by the _aural  tuft_.  The eyes must also match; and this is what I like to see--a blue  eye in a white Persian, a hazel in a black, and a lovely sea-green in a  tabby.    3.  The _Pelage_: The pelage is long (the longer the better), especially  around the neck and a-down the sides; and a good brush, gracefully  swirled and carried, is an essential point of beauty.  The fur ought to  be as silken as possible; this shows that the cat is not only well-bred,  but well-fed and taken care of.    4.  _Markings_: They ought to be as distinct as possible, as pretty as  possible, and evenly laid on with reference to the two sides.    5.  _Colour_: All white in the pure white, all black in the black, and  so on with the other distinct colours; and for the tabbies the same  rules hold good as those given for short-haired tabbies.    _General rules for judging Asiatic Cats_.--First scan your cats,  remembering the difference in size you are to expect in tabbies from the  others.  Next see to the length and texture of the pelage--its  glossiness, and its freedom from cinder-holes, or the reverse.  Then  note the colour, and the evenness or unevenness of the markings.  The  head most be carefully noted, as to its size and shape, the colour of  the eyes and nose, ditto the whiskers; mark, too, the _lay_ of the ear,  and its _aural tuft_.  In the tabbies the _Mayor's Chain_ should swirl  around the chest.  Lastly, take a glance at the expression of face.    _Merits of the Asiatic Cats_.--I think every cat-fancier will bear me  out in saying that, although more delicate in constitution than our  European short-hairs, and hardly so keen at mousing, ratting, or so  fierce in fighting larger game, there can be no doubt of it they make  far nicer pets.  They are extremely affectionate and loving in their  dispositions, and so fond of other animals, such as dogs, pet rabbits,  guinea-pigs, etc.  Their love for a kind master or mistress only ends  with life itself.  Then they are so beautiful and so cleanly, and, if  kept in a clean room, take such care of their lovely pelage, that I only  wonder there are not more of them bred than there are.  They are a  little more expensive at first.  You can seldom pick up a good kitten at  a show under one pound sterling--but if you do succeed in getting one or  two nice ones, I am quite certain you will never have to repent it, if  you only do them ordinary justice.    It will be well to end this chapter here; but before doing so, I beg to  make one or two remarks, which I feel sure will interest secretaries of  coming cat-shows.    1.  In all shows give the cats nice roomy pens, whether of wood or zinc.    2.  Attend well to the ventilation, and more especially to disinfection.    3.  Attend to the feeding, and, at a more than one-day show, cats ought  to have _water_ as well as milk.  I think boiled lights, cut into small  pieces, with a very small portion of bullock's liver and bread soaked,  is the best food; but I have tried Spratt's Patent Cat Food with a great  number of cats, both of my own and those of friends, and have nearly  always found it agree; and at a cat-show it would, I believe, be both  handy and cleanly.    4.  On no account let the pussies lie on the bare wood or zinc, but  provide each with a cushion of some sort, and have a small box filled  with earth or sand, in each pen.  _Sawdust in a cat's cage is an  abomination_.  It soils the fur, and gets into the food-dish, and  renders pussy simply miserable.    CHAPTER EIGHT.    ON DIET, DRINK, AND HOUSING.    \"Throw physic to the dogs,\" said the immortal William.  That was a good  many years ago, and dogs then were of very little value, and little used  either to physic or good treatment; but nowadays we have found out that  the possession of even a cat, entails upon us the duty and  responsibility of seeing she is well cared for while in health, and  properly treated in sickness.  I recommended small doses of quinine and  steel to an unwell pussy the other day.    \"Ma conscience!\" cried her owner; \"gie medicine to a cat!  Wha ever  heard o' the like?\"    I'm sorry that woman was Scotch, but glad to say I reasoned even her  round, and her cat is now as sleek and lively as the day is long.    Most, if not all the diseases which feline flesh is heir to, are brought  on by bad feeding, starvation, or exposure to the weather, especially  the cruel custom many people have of leaving their poor cats out all  night, to seek for food and shelter for themselves.  These are the cats  who make night hideous with their howling, who tear up beautiful  flowerbeds, rob pigeon-lofts, murder valuable rabbits, and, in a general  way, do all they can to bring into disrepute the whole feline race.  I  declare to you honestly, there is as much difference between one of  these night-prowlers and a well-cared-for cat, as there is between one  of the lean and mangy curs who do scavengers' duty in Cairo, and a  champion Scottish Collie.    Some men will tell you that it is unmanly to love or care for a cat;  just as if it _could_ be unmanly to love anything that God made and  gifted with sagacity, wisdom, and undying love for all the human race!  But I can point you out scores of men who are good sportsmen, fearless  huntsmen, and fond of every manly sport--ay, and men, too, who are at  home on the stormiest ocean, and never pale when fired upon in anger--  who can both pride and prize a favourite cat.  At Exeter, not long  since, out of thirty-nine owners of cats, all were men except nine, and  of these nine seven were married, and the two others were young ladies,  while the owner of the first-prize cat _was a gallant soldier_.  So much  for the notion that only old maids care for cats.    Before going on to describe the diseases which afflict pussydom, we must  give a few general instructions regarding her treatment while well.    And first, as to her food.  Pussy will catch a mouse, and after playing  with it for half an hour in a way which is very cruel, but no doubt  makes it very tender, she will generally kill and eat it; but it by no  means follows that mice are the cat's natural food.  The majority of  cats catch mice more for the love of sport than anything else.  Nothing,  therefore, is more cruel than to starve poor pussy, with the erroneous  idea that it will make her a good mouser; it is just the reverse.  My  Phiz bids me say that mice-catching is long, weary, anxious work at the  best, and she is quite certain she would die if compelled to make a  living at it.    Feed your pussy well, then, if you would have her be faithful and  honest, and keep your house clear of mice and rats.    I have lived a good deal in apartments in my time, and I have always  avoided places where there was a lean and hungry-looking cat.  It is a  sure sign of irregularity and bad housekeeping.    Twice a day is often enough, but not too often, to feed your cat, and it  is better to let her have her allowance put down to her at once, instead  of feeding her with tid-bits.  Nothing can be better for pussy's  breakfast than oatmeal porridge and sweet milk.  _Entre nous_, reader,  nothing could be better for your own breakfast.  Oatmeal is the food of  both mind and matter, the food of the hero and the poet; it was the food  of Wallace, Bruce, and Walter Scott, and has been the food of brave men  and good since their day.      \"Oh! were I able to rehearse    Scotch oatmeal's praise in proper verse,    I'd blaw it oot as loud and fierce,            As piper's drones could blaw, man.\"    But I cannot wonder for a single moment at this favourite Scottish food  being in disrepute in England, because hardly anyone knows how to make  it.  Our cook at sea once undertook to supply our mess with a daily  matutinal meal of porridge, and of oatcakes too.  He was sure he could  make them, because his \"father had once lived in Scotland.\"  Nevertheless, I gave him some additional information, and we, the  Scottish officers, of whom there were two or three besides myself, were  in high glee, and took an extra turn on deck the first morning, to give  us a good appetite for the great coming double event.  Then down we  bolted to our porridge.  Porridge! save the name, such a slimy, thin,  disgusting mess you never saw!  Well might our chief engineer call out:    \"Tak' it awa', steward, tak' it awa'; it would scunner (sicken) the  de'il himsel'!\"    \"But, hurrah!\"  I cried, \"there's the oatcakes to come.  Steward, where  are the oatcakes?\"    The steward lifted the cover from the dish on which was wont to repose  our delicious \"'spatch cock,\" or savoury curry, and there, lo and  behold! half-a-dozen things of the shape and thickness of a ship's  biscuit, black, and wet, and steaming, and we were supposed to eat them  _with a knife and fork_!  Meanwhile the ham and eggs were fast  disappearing among the Englishmen at the other end of the table, and we  poor Scots had to go without our breakfast, and get laughed at into the  bargain.    But here, now, I'll tell you what I'll do for you, as Cheap Jack says--  I'll give you a receipt by which you shall live a hundred years, and  begin your second century a deal stronger than you began your first.  Buy your meal from the meal-shop--no, not the chemist, my dear--taste it  to make sure it has no \"nip;\" see, also, that it is fresh, and not  ground before Culloden, and buy it neither too fine nor too round, but  just a _happy medium_.  Having thus caught your hare, so to speak, go  home with it, and put a saucepan "]]]
