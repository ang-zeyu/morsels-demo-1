This species was first observed on August 28 in primary forest and       was seen regularly from then until September 28 in secondary       forest, primary forest, and in cocoa shade trees.    _=Cacomantis sonnerati=_ (Latham): Banded Bay Cuckoo.--Birds that may  have been of this species were observed on several occasions. E. J. H.  Berwick (pers. comm.) claimed he had heard _C. sonnerati_ at the Cocoa  Research Station. I have heard many times a call sometimes ascribed to  this species but I have not actually seen the bird making the sound. If  the call note I heard is actually of this species it is not rare in the  Quoin Hill area.    _=Cacomantis merulinus threnodes=_ Cabanis and Heine: Plaintive  Cuckoo.--_Specimens_, 5: Cocoa Research Station: [Male], 25.0 gm.,  September 8, 1962, MCT 2891; [Female] imm., 27.0 gm., September 8, 1962,  MCT 2892; [Male] testis 4 x 3 mm., November 29, 1962, MCT 3382. Tenom:  [Male], January 1, 1963, MCT 3563. Ulu Balung: [Female], July 15, 1963,  ADG 199.         This cuckoo was common in all habitats examined at all of our       collecting stations, except the moss forest near Tenom.    _=Cacomantis variolosus sepulchralis=_ (S. Muller): Fantailed  Cuckoo.--_Specimens_, 2: Cocoa Research Station: [Male], 30.8 gm.,  August 28, 1962, MCT 2824. Ulu Balung: [Male], July 10, 1963, ADG 183.         The specimens were collected in primary forest. There are only five       earlier records for all of Borneo (Smythies, 1960:253-254).       Probably this species nests in Borneo; it is unlikely that       specimens taken in August and July are migrants.    _=Chalcites xanthorhynchus xanthorhynchus=_ (Horsfield): Violet  Cuckoo.--_Specimens_, 1: Cocoa Research Station: [Female] largest ovum 1  mm., September 26, 1962, MCT 2964.         This species was seen twice, both times in the research station       cocoa plantings. The specimen taken was from a shade tree, _Trema       orientalis_.    _=Chalcites malayanus aheneus=_ Junge: Malaysian Green  Cuckoo.--_Specimens_, 9: Cocoa Research Station: [Female] definite brood  patch, 17.5 gm., body molt, July 4, 1962, MCT 2587; [Male] testis 4 x 4  mm., 19.1 gm., August 8, 1962, MCT 2736; [Female], 17.5 gm., August 8,  1962, MCT 2737; [Male], 17.5 gm., August 8, 1962, MCT 2738; [Male]  testis 4 x 3 mm., 18.2 gm., August 8, 1962, MCT 2739; [Female], August  25, 1962, MCT 2809; [Male], 21.1 gm., September 11, 1962, MCT 2900;  [Male], October 2, 1962, MCT 2984. Tiger Estate: [Female] oviduct  enlarged, brood patch, November 25, 1962, MCT 3318.         This cuckoo was common in the cocoa planting at the Cocoa Research       Station and not found in any other type of habitat. Smythies       (1960:255) thought that possibly two species of _Chalcites_ were       represented in the series of _Chalcites malayanus_ from Borneo. I       have assembled all 20 known specimens, however, including seven in       the Museum of Comparative Zoology at Harvard unreported by Smythies       (1957:638) and find that the variation in the coloration of the       head and upperparts is due to the difference in sexes, the males       being darker than the females. There is much variation in the       length of the wing, but the meaning of this variation is not yet       clear.    _=Surniculus lugubris barussarum=_ (Oberholser):  Drongo-cuckoo.--_Specimens_, 2: Cocoa Research Station: [Female] imm.,  July 28, 1962, MCT 2672, discarded; [Female] imm., 28.6 gm., August 25,  1962, MCT 2810.         The first specimen was taken in secondary forest; it had been       sitting in a dead tree, occasionally darting out after insects.       The second specimen was taken in cocoa; its stomach contained 50       caterpillars.    _=Eudynamys scolopacea=_ (Linnaeus): Koel.--This species was observed at  Tawau and on Siamil Island, on August 30 and September 18, respectively.    _=Clamator coromandus=_ (Linnaeus): Red-winged Crested  Cuckoo.--_Specimen_, 1: Telipok: [Female], February 10, 1963, TM 33.    _=Phaenicophaeus chlorophaeus fuscigularis=_ (Baker): Raffles  Malcoha.--_Specimen_, 1: Cocoa Research Station: [Male], August 26,  1962, MCT 2813.         Flocks of three and four were seen in the cocoa. At Kalabakan the       species was feeding about 40 feet up in the second canopy layer of       the primary forest.    _=Phaenicophaeus diardi borneensis=_ (Salvadori): Lesser Green-billed  Malcoha.--_Specimens_, 3: Cocoa Research Station: [Female], 58.2 gm.,  July 22, 1962, MCT 2636; [Female], 55.8 gm., September 8, 1962, MCT  2890; [Male], September 13, 1962, MCT 2918.         This malcoha was seen only three times; it was the second most       common malcoha.    _=Phaenicophaeus javanicus pallidus=_ (Robinson and Kloss): Red-billed  Malcoha.--_Specimens_, 2: Cocoa Research Station: [Female], 97.0 gm.,  August 31, 1962, MCT 2841; [Male], 98.0 gm., September 8, 1962, MCT  2889.         The two specimens were taken in cocoa. On October 2, 1962, I saw       one about 100 feet up in the top canopy layer of the primary forest       at the Cocoa Research Station and, on October 3, two more hopping       from branch to branch about 150 feet up in a tree.    _=Phaenicophaeus curvirostris borneensis=_ (Blasius and Nehrkorn):  Chestnut-breasted Malcoha.--_Specimens_, 7: Cocoa Research Station:  [Female] old brood patch, 121.8 gm., July 6, 1962, MCT 2602; [Female],  September 4, 1962, MCT 2864; [Male] testis 3 x 2 mm., 143.6 gm., wing  molt, July 7, 1962, MCT 2611; [Male] testis 6 x 2 mm., 111.0 gm., August  11, 1962, MCT 2763; [Female], May 25, 1963, ADG 110. Ulu Balung: sex?,  July 24, 1963, ADG 216. Tiger Estate: [Male], June 22, 1963, ADG 156.         This was the most numerous of the malcohas at the Cocoa Research       Station. It was observed in primary forest, secondary forest,       citrus trees, and cocoa trees. In the primary forest it ranged in       the upper canopy from 100 to 150 feet up.         As Peters has indicated (1940:56), the name _P. c. borneensis_       (Blasius and Nehrkorn) 1881 has priority over _P. c. microrhinus_       Berlepsch 1895 (used by Smythies).    _=Centropus sinensis=_ (Stephens): Common Coucal.--_Specimen_, 1: Cocoa  Research Station: [Female], May 15, 1963, ADG 108.         The finding of a coucal at the Cocoa Research Station on May 15,       1963, came as something of a surprise, since none had been seen       there earlier by our group. Coucals were seen at Tawau but were not       collected or identified to species.    _=Centropus bengalensis=_ (Gmelin): Lesser Coucal.--_Specimens_, 2:  Tuaran: [Female], April 1, 1963, ADG 46; sex?, December 3, 1963, SCFC  17.    _=Carpococcyx radiceus radiceus=_ (Temminck): Ground  Cuckoo.--_Specimen_, 1: 12 mi. N Kalabakan: [Male] imm., November 7,  1962, MCT 3217.         This male was taken in a native snare in primary forest and       provides our only record. The specimen is in the postjuvenal (first       prebasic) molt.         This record is the first for this species from North Borneo       (Smythies, 1957:643); others are known from Sarawak and Indonesian       Borneo.    _=Otus bakkamoena lemurum=_ Deignan. Collared Scops Owl.--_Specimens_,  3: Tiger Estate: [Female], November 25, 1962, MCT 3319. Tenom: [Male]  testis 6 x 5 mm., body molt, January 1, 1963, MCT 3552. Agricultural Oil  Palm Station: [Male], October 6, 1963, ADG 299.         The specimen from Tenom was taken in a bird net set in a       grass-scrubland situation; the testes were regressing. Harrison       (Smythies, 1957:645) found this species breeding in the Kelabit       uplands in January.    _=Glaucidium brodiei borneense=_ Sharpe: Pygmy Owlet.--_Specimen_, 1:  Ulu Balung: [Male], July 19, 1963, ADG 210.         The specimen taken by Garcia is the sixth known (Smythies,       1957:646) from Borneo and the first from the east coast. Specimens       were collected in 1956 in North Borneo by the Cambridge Expedition.    _=Ninox scutulata borneensis=_ (Bonaparte): Hawk-owl.--_Specimen_, 1:  Tenom: [Female] largest ovum 2 mm., oviduct evident, January 6, 1963,  MCT 3583.         This female, taken in a bird net in a grass-scrubland association,       was coming into breeding condition.    _=Strix leptogrammica=_ Temminck: Malaysian Wood Owl.--_Specimens_, 2:  Cocoa Research Station: sex?, July 9, 1963, ADG 182; [Male], May 25,  1963, ADG 111.         On September 7, 1962, I flushed two of these owls from a tree       beside the Apas River in primary forest. One was subsequently shot       but lost. Garcia's two specimens were not identified to subspecies.    _=Caprimulgus macrurus salvadori=_ Sharpe: Long-tailed  Nightjar.--_Specimens_, 3: Tuaran: [Female], January 12, 1963, MCT 3592;  [Female], March 2, 1963, ADG 6. Mt. Rumas: [Male], March 6, 1963, ADG  13.         This was an abundant bird on the Jesselton-Tuaran road but was not       seen at any of the other collecting stations in North Borneo.    _=Collocalia fuciphaga natunae=_ Stresemann: Thunberg  Swiftlet.--_Specimens_, 3: Cocoa Research Station: [Female] largest ovum  7 mm., oviduct enlarged, 13.1 gm., June 30, 1962, MCT 2570; [Female]  ovary small, September 8, 1962, MCT 2887. 5.5 mi. SW Tenom: [Female],  December 20, 1962, MCT 3485.         This swiftlet was seen every day while we were at the Cocoa       Research Station and was common also in the mountains around Tenom,       where it flew in and out of the fog over our camp.    _=Collocalia esculenta=_ ssp.: White-bellied Swiftlet.--_Specimens_, 7:  Cocoa Research Station: [Male], 5.5 gm., July 4, 1962, MCT 2591; [Male],  6.2 gm., July 5, 1962, MCT 2594; [Male], 6.2 gm., July 1, 1962, MCT  2574; [Female], 6.0 gm., July 4, 1962, MCT 2589; [Female], 5.7 gm., July  4, 1962, MCT 2590. 12 mi. N Kalabakan: [Male] testis 4 x 2 mm., November  10, 1962, MCT 3236; [Male], November 10, 1962, MCT 3237.         This was the most abundant of all the swifts at the Cocoa Research"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3307"],[0,"The Pagan Tribes of Borneo (#7)"],[1," in 1763 the Sultan of Sulu ceded to the East India Company the  territory in Borneo which had been given him when he killed the usurper  Abdul Mubin in Bruni. In 1773 a small settlement was formed on the  island of Balambangan, north of Bruni; and in the following year  the Sultan of Bruni agreed to give this settlement a monopoly of the  pepper trade in return for protection from piracy. In the next year,  however, Balambangan was surprised and captured by the Sulus. It was  reoccupied for a few months in 1803, and then finally forsaken.    Towards the end of the eighteenth century the Malays of Bruni,  Sulu, and Mindanao, with native followers and allies, inspired  we may suppose by the example of their European visitors, took to  piracy -- not that they had not engaged in such business before, but  that they now prosecuted an old trade with renewed vigour. English  traders still tried to pay occasional visits, but after the loss  of the MAY in 1788, the SUSANNA in 1803, and the COMMERCE in 1806,  with the murder of the crews, the Admiralty warned merchants that it  was CERTAIN DESTRUCTION to go up river to Bruni. For forty years this  intimation was left on British charts, and British seamen followed the  humiliating counsel. Not until the early forties was peace restored,  after an event of the most romantic and improbable kind, the accession  of an English gentleman to the throne of Sarawak.    Of this incident, so fateful for the future of the western side  of Borneo, it must suffice to say here that James Brooke, a young  Englishman, having resigned his commission in the army of the British  East India Company, invested his fortune in a yacht of 140 tons,  with which he set sail in 1838 for the eastern Archipelago. His  bold but vague design was to establish peace, prosperity, and just  government in some part of that troubled area, whose beauties he had  admired and whose misfortunes he had deplored on the occasion of an  earlier voyage to the China seas. When at Singapore, he heard that  the Malays of Sarawak, a district forming the southern extremity  of the Sultanate of Bruni, had rebelled against the Bruni nobles,  and had in vain appealed to the Dutch Governor-general at Batavia for  deliverance from their oppressors. Under the nominal authority of the  Sultan, these Bruni nobles, many of whom were of Arab descent, had  brought all the north-western part of Borneo to a state of chronic  rebellion. They had taught the Sea Dayaks of the Batang Lupar and  neighbouring rivers to join them in their piratical excursions, and,  being to some extent dependent upon their aid, were compelled to  treat them with some consideration; but all other communities were  treated by them with a rapacity and cruelty which was causing a rapid  depopulation and the return to jungle of much cultivated land.    Brooke sailed for Sarawak in August 1839, and found the country torn  by internal conflicts. The Sultan had recently sent Muda Hasim, his  uncle and heir-presumptive to the throne of Bruni, to restore order;  but this weak though amiable noble had found himself quite incapable  of coping with the situation. Brooke spent some time surveying the  coast and studying the people and country, and gained the confidence of  Muda Hasim. After an excursion to Celebes, Brooke sailed for a second  visit to Sarawak just a year after the first, and found the state of  the country going from bad to worse. Muda Hasim besought him to take  command of his forces and to suppress the rebellion. Brooke consented,  and soon secured the submission of the rebel leaders on the condition  that he (Brooke), and not any Bruni noble, should be the governor and  Rajah of Sarawak. Muda Hasim had offered to secure his appointment  to this office as an inducement to him to undertake the operations  against the rebels; Brooke therefore felt himself justified in granting  these terms. And when later Muda Hasim, no longer threatened with  disgrace and failure, showed himself disinclined to carry out this  arrangement, Brooke, feeling himself bound by his agreement with  the rebel leaders, whose lives he had with difficulty preserved from  the vengeance of the Bruni nobles, insisted upon it with some show  of force; and on September 24, 1841, he was proclaimed Rajah and  governor of Sarawak amid the rejoicings of the populace. Muda Hasim,  as representative of the Sultan, signed the document which conferred  this title and authority; but since he was not in any proper sense  Rajah of Sarawak, which in fact was not a raj, but a district hitherto  ruled or misruled by Bruni governors not bearing the title of Rajah,  this transaction cannot properly be described as an abdication by  Muda Hasim in favour of Brooke. Brooke accordingly felt that it was  desirable to secure from the Sultan himself a formal recognition of  his authority and title. To this end he visited the Sultan in the year  1842, and obtained from him the desired confirmation of the action of  his agent Muda Hasim. The way in which the raj of Sarawak has since  been extended, until it now comprises a territory of nearly 60,000  square miles (approximately equal to the area of England and Wales),  will be briefly described in a later chapter (XXII.).    The northern end of Borneo had long been a hunting-ground for slaves  for the nobles of Bruni and Sulu, whose Sultans claimed but did  not exercise the right to rule over it. In 1877 Mr. Alfred Dent,  a Shanghai merchant, induced the two Sultans to resign to him their  sovereign rights over this territory in return for a money payment. The  British North Borneo Company, which was formed for the commercial  development of it, necessarily undertook the task of pacification  and administration. In 1881 the company was granted a royal charter  by the British Government; and it now administers with success and a  fair prospect of continued commercial profit a territory which, with  the exception of a small area about the town of Bruni, includes all  of the island that had not been brought under the Dutch or Sarawak  flag. In 1888 Sarawak and British North Borneo were formally brought  under the protection of the British Government; but the territories  remained under the rule of the Rajah and of the company respectively,  except in regard to their foreign relations. In the year 1906 the  Sultan of Bruni placed himself and his capital, together with the  small territory over which he still retained undivided authority,  under the protection of the British Government; and thus was completed  the passing of the island of Borneo under European control.        CHAPTER 3    General Sketch of the Peoples of Borneo    It is not improbable that at one time Borneo was inhabited by people  of the negrito race, small remnants of which race are still to be  found in islands adjacent to all the coasts of Borneo as well as in  the Malay Peninsula. No communities of this race exist in the island  at the present time; but among the people of the northern districts  individuals may be occasionally met with whose hair and facial  characters strongly suggest an infusion of negrito or negroid blood.    It is probable that the mixed race of Hindu-Javanese invaders, who  occupied the southern coasts of Borneo some centuries ago, became  blended with the indigenous population, and that a considerable  proportion of their blood still runs in the veins of some of the  tribes of the southern districts (E.G. the Land Dayaks and Malohs).    There can be no doubt that of the Chinese traders who have been  attracted to Borneo by its camphor, edible birds' nests, and spices,  some have settled in the island and have become blended with and  absorbed by the tribes of the north-west (E.G. the Dusuns); and  it seems probable that some of the elements of their culture have  spread widely and been adopted throughout a large part of Borneo. For  several centuries also Chinese settlers have been attracted to the  south-western district by the gold which they found in the river  gravel and alluvium. These also have intermarried with the people of  the country; but they have retained their national characteristics,  and have been continually recruited by considerable numbers of their  fellow countrymen. Since the establishment of peace and order and  security for life and property by the European administrations, and  with the consequent development of trade during the last half-century,  the influx of Chinese has been very rapid; until at the present time  they form large communities in and about all the chief centres of  trade. A certain number of Chinese traders continue to penetrate far  into the interior, and some of these take wives of the people of the  country; in many cases their children become members of their mothers'  tribes and so are blended with the native stocks.    Among the Mohammedans, who are found in all the coast regions of  Borneo, there is a considerable number of persons who claim Arab  forefathers; and there can be no doubt that the introduction of the  Mohammedan religion was largely due to Arab traders, and that many  Arabs and their half-bred descendants have held official positions  under the Sultans of Bruni.    During the last half-century, natives of India, most of whom are Klings  from Madras, have established themselves in the small trades of the  towns; and of others who came as coolies, some have settled in the  towns with their wives and families. These people do not penetrate  into the interior or intermarry with the natives.    With the exception of the above-mentioned immigrants and their  descendants, the population of Borneo may be described as falling  naturally into two great classes; namely, on the one hand those  who have accepted, nominally at least, the Mohammedan religion and  civilisation, and on the other hand the pagan peoples. In Bruni and in  all the coast regions the majority of the people are Mohammedan, have  no tribal"]]]
