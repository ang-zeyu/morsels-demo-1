I am, with much Esteem and Gratitude,      HONOURABLE SIRS,      Your most obedient, and      most obliged humble Servant,      SAMUEL HEARNE.          PREFACE.      Mr. Dalrymple, in one of his Pamphlets relating to Hudson's Bay, has  been so very particular in his observations on my Journey, as to remark,  that I have not explained the construction of the Quadrant which I had  the misfortune to break in my second Journey to the North. It was a  Hadley's Quadrant, with a bubble attached to it for a horizon, and made  by Daniel Scatlif of Wapping. But as no instrument of the same principle  could be procured when I was setting out on my last Journey, an old  Elton's Quadrant, which had been upwards of thirty years at the Fort,  was the only instrument I could then be provided with, in any respect  proper for making observations with on the land.    Mr. Dalrymple also observes, that I only inserted in my last Journal to  the Company, one observation for the latitude, which may be true; but I  had, nevertheless, several others during that Journey, particularly at  Snow-bird Lake, Thelwey-aza-yeth, and Clowey, exclusive of that  mentioned in the Journal taken at Conge-cathawhachaga. But when I was on  that Journey, and for several {vi} years after, I little thought that  any remarks made in it would ever have attracted the notice of the  Public; if I had, greater pains might and would have been taken to  render it more worthy of their attention than it now is. At that time my  ideas and ambition extended no farther than to give my employers such an  account of my proceedings as might be satisfactory to them, and answer  the purpose which they had in view; little thinking it would ever come  under the inspection of so ingenious and indefatigable a geographer as  Mr. Dalrymple must be allowed to be. But as the case has turned out  otherwise, I have at my leisure hours recopied all my Journals into one  book, and in some instances added to the remarks I had before made; not  so much for the information of those who are critics in geography, as  for the amusement of candid and indulgent readers, who may perhaps feel  themselves in some measure gratified, by having the face of a country  brought to their view, which has hitherto been entirely unknown to every  European except myself. Nor will, I flatter myself, a description of the  modes of living, manners, and customs of the natives (which, though long  known, have never been described), be less acceptable to the curious.    I cannot help observing, that I feel myself rather hurt at Mr.  Dalrymple's rejecting my latitude in so peremptory a manner, and in so  great a proportion, as he has done; because, before I arrived at  Conge-cathawhachaga, the {vii} Sun did not set during the whole night: a  proof that I was then to the Northward of the Arctic Circle. I may be  allowed to add, that when I was at the Copper River, on the eighteenth  of July, the Sun's declination was but 21 deg., and yet it was certainly  some height above the horizon at midnight; how much, as I did not _then_  remark, I will not _now_ take upon me to say; but it proves that the  latitude was considerably more than Mr. Dalrymple will admit of. His  assertion, that no grass is to be found on the (rocky) coast of  Greenland farther North than the latitude of 65 deg., is no proof there  should not be any in a much higher latitude in the interior parts of  North America. For, in the first place, I think it is more than  probable, that the Copper River empties itself into a sort of inland  Sea, or extensive Bay, somewhat like that of Hudson's: and it is well  known that no part of the coast of Hudson's Straits, nor those of  Labradore, at least for some degrees South of them, any more than the  East coast of Hudson's Bay, till we arrive near Whale River, have any  trees on them; while the West coast of the Bay in the same latitudes, is  well clothed with timber. Where then is the ground for such an  assertion? Had Mr. Dalrymple considered this circumstance only, I  flatter myself he would not so hastily have objected to woods and grass  being seen in similar situations, though in a much higher latitude.  Neither can the reasoning which Mr. Dalrymple derives from the error I  committed in estimating the distance to Cumberland House, any way affect  the question under {viii} consideration; because that distance being  chiefly in longitude, I had no means of correcting it by an observation,  which was not the case here.    I do not by any means wish to enter into a dispute with, or incur the  displeasure of Mr. Dalrymple; but thinking, as I do, that I have not  been treated in so liberal a manner as I ought to have been, he will  excuse me for endeavouring to convince the Public that his objections  are in a great measure without foundation. And having done so, I shall  quit the disagreeable subject with declaring, that if any part of the  following sheets should afford amusement to Mr. Dalrymple, or any other  of my readers, it will be the highest gratification I can receive, and  the only recompence I desire to obtain for the hardships and fatigue  which I underwent in procuring the information contained in them.    Being well assured that several learned and curious gentlemen are in  possession of manuscript copies of, or extracts from, my Journals, as  well as copies of the Charts, I have been induced to make this copy as  correct as possible, and to publish it; especially as I observe that  scarcely any two of the publications that contain extracts from my  Journals, agree in the dates when I arrived at, or departed from,  particular places. To rectify those disagreements I applied to the  Governor and Committee of the Hudson's Bay Company, for leave to peruse  my original Journals. This was granted with the greatest affability {ix}  and politeness; as well as a sight of all my Charts relative to this  Journey. With this assistance I have been enabled to rectify some  inaccuracies that had, by trusting too much to memory, crept into this  copy; and I now offer it to the Public under authentic dates and the  best authorities, however widely some publications may differ from it.    I have taken the liberty to expunge some passages which were inserted in  the original copy, as being no ways interesting to the Public, and  several others have undergone great alterations; so that, in fact, the  whole may be said to be new-modelled, by being blended with a variety of  Remarks and Notes that were not inserted in the original copy, but which  my long residence in the country has enabled me to add.    The account of the principal quadrupeds and birds that frequent those  Northern regions in Summer, as well as those which never migrate, though  not described in a scientific manner, may not be entirely unacceptable  to the most scientific zoologists; and to those who are unacquainted  with the technical terms used in zoology, it may perhaps be more useful  and entertaining, than if I had described them in the most classical  manner. But I must not conclude this Preface, without acknowledging, in  the most ample manner, the assistance I have received from the perusal  of Mr Pennant's Arctic Zoology, which has enabled me to give several of  the birds their proper {x} names; for those by which they are known in  Hudson's Bay are purely Indian, and of course quite unknown to every  European who has not resided in that country.    To conclude, I cannot sufficiently regret the loss of a considerable  Vocabulary of the Northern Indian Language, containing sixteen folio  pages, which was lent to the late Mr. Hutchins, then Corresponding  Secretary to the Company, to copy for Captain Duncan, when he went on  discoveries to Hudson's Bay in the year one thousand seven hundred and  ninety. But Mr. Hutchins dying soon after, the Vocabulary was taken away  with the rest of his effects, and cannot now be recovered; and memory,  at this time, will by no means serve to replace it.

Major  Jacob Brown was left in charge of the works opposite Matamoras with the  Seventh Regiment of Infantry, Captain Sands's company of artillery, and  Bragg's field battery.    By some accident provision was not made complete for Arista to make prompt  crossing of the river, and that gave General Taylor time to reach his  base, reinforce it, and draw sufficient supplies. Advised of our move by  General Mejia, at Matamoras, General Arista was thrown into doubt as to  whether our move was intended for Matamoras, and sent back part of his  forces for its defence. Finding, however, that Taylor had gone to Point  Isabel, Arista crossed the river and put his line athwart our return march  at Palo Alto. To hasten Taylor's return, he ordered General Mejia, at  Matamoras, to open his batteries on our troops at Fort Brown, and make  serious demonstrations against them.    General Taylor started on his return on the 7th of May. We had heard the  artillery-fire upon comrades left at the forts, and were anxiously looking  for the order. It was received with cheers, and a good march was made, but  the night was awful. The mosquitoes seemed as thick as the blades of grass  on the prairie, and swarmed and buzzed in clouds, and packs of  half-famished wolves prowled and howled about us. There was no need for  the sound of reveille. The wolves and mosquitoes, and perhaps some solemn  thoughts, kept us on the _qui vive_. Arista's army was known to be in line  of battle only a few miles off. About one o'clock we halted to fill the  canteens, and marched to meet the enemy. The columns were  deployed,--Fifth Infantry on the right, Ringgold's battery, Third  Infantry, a two-gun battery of eighteen-pounders, the Fourth Infantry,  battalion of artillery acting as infantry, Duncan's field battery and  Eighth Infantry, Captains Charles May and Croghan Ker, with squadrons of  dragoons, looking to the trains; the Third and Fourth Infantry, the Third  Brigade, under Colonel John Garland. That brigade, with the Fifth  Regiment, the heavy guns, and Ringgold's, were of the right wing, General  Twiggs commanding. Other forces of the left were under Colonel William G.  Belknap, Eighth Infantry, and Duncan's Battery.    As the lines deployed, Lieutenant J. E. Blake, of the Topographical  Engineers, dashed forward alone, made a close inspection of the enemy's  line with such lightning speed that his work was accomplished before the  enemy could comprehend his purpose, rode back and reported to the  commanding general. He was one of the heroes of the day, but his laurels  were enjoyed only a few hours. As he took his pistol off at night he threw  it upon the ground, and an accidental explosion of one of the charges gave  him a mortal wound.    The line advanced until the puff of smoke from one of the enemy's guns  rose, and the ball bounded over the prairie, passed over our heads, and  wounded a teamster far in our rear. Our infantry was ordered down and our  artillery into practice. It was an artillery combat more than a battle,  and held until night. The Mexican cavalry made a charge against the Fifth  Regiment, and finding our front of square too strong repeated on another  front, but were repulsed. Presently the grass took fire, and the winds so  far favored us as to sweep the smoke in the enemy's faces, and when it  passed we found the Mexican line had been drawn back a little. May's  squadron was sent there, and General Taylor advanced the right of his  line, but night closed in before decisive work could be done. The armies  were near enough during the night to hear the moans of the wounded. Major  Ringgold was mortally wounded, also Captain John Page, of the Fourth  Infantry, but less than fifty of our troops were lost.    Early the next morning a few of the Mexican troops could be seen, but when  the sun rose to light the field it was found vacant. A careful  reconnoissance revealed that the enemy was in retreat, and the dragoons  reported them in march towards our comrades at Fort Brown.    General Taylor remained on the field a few hours to have the killed and  wounded of both sides cared for, but sent the dragoons, light infantry,  and Ringgold's battery in pursuit, the latter under Lieutenant Randolph  Ridgely. The light infantry was of two battalions, under Captain George A.  McCall and Captain C. F. Smith. The route of march was through a dense  chaparral on both sides of the road, the infantry finding their way as  best they could through the chaparral, the dragoons and Texas Rangers  moving on the road, and far off from our flanks, wherever they could find  ways of passage. The company to which I was attached was of Smith's  battalion, on the right of the road. After a considerable march the  battalion came to the body of a young Mexican woman. She had ceased to  breathe, but blood heat was still in her body, and her expression  life-like. A profusion of black hair covered her shoulders and person, the  only covering to her waist. This sad spectacle, so unlike our thoughts of  battle, unnerved us a little, but the crush through the thorny bushes soon  brought us back to thoughts of heavy work, and then came reports of  several guns and of grapeshot flying over our heads and tearing through  the wood. A reconnoissance found General Arista's army on the south bank  of a stream, Resaca de la Palma, which at this season had dried into  lagoons with intervening passes. The road crossed at a wide gap between  two extensive lagoons. The most of the enemy's artillery was near the  road, the infantry behind the lagoons, with improvised breast defences of  pack-saddles and other articles that could be found to stop musket-balls.  The lagoons were about a hundred feet wide and from two to three feet  deep.    The position was so strong that General Arista thought it would not be  attacked. He left General La Vega in command at the road, and made his  head-quarters some distance in rear, holding his cavalry in hand to look  for any flank move, unpacked his mule-train, and turned the animals out to  graze. General Taylor received reports of our adventures and  reconnoissance when he rode up, deployed his army for battle, and ordered  it forward. In the dense chaparral it was not possible to hold the  regiments to their lines, and in places the companies were obliged to  break files to get along. All of the enemy's artillery opened, and soon  his musketry. The lines closed in to short work, even to bayonet work at  places. Lieutenant-Colonel McIntosh had a bayonet thrust through his mouth  and neck.[2] Lieutenant R. M. Cochran, Fourth Regiment, and T. L.  Chadbourne, of the Eighth, were killed; C. R. Gates and C. D. Jordan, of  the Eighth, were severely wounded. The latter, a classmate, was  overpowered and about to be slaughtered when rescued by Lieutenant George  Lincoln, of the Eighth, who slew with his sword one of the assailants.    Finding the enemy's strong fight, in defence, by his artillery, General  Taylor ordered Captain May to charge and capture the principal battery.  The squadron was of his own and S. P. Graham's troops. The road was only  wide enough to form the dragoons in column of fours. When in the act of  springing to their work, Ridgely called, \"Hold on, Charlie, till I draw  their fire,\" and loosed his six guns upon the battery at the road.    The return was prompt, but General Taylor, not noting the cause of delay,  repeated the order. Ridgely's work, however, was done, and May's spurs  pressing his horses had them on the leap before the order reached his  ears. In a minute he was at the guns sabring the gunners, and wheeling  right and left got possession of the batteries. General La Vega was found  at one of his batteries trying to defend it with his sword against one of  May's dragoons, but was forced to get in between the wheels of his guns to  avoid the horse's heels as they pressed him, when his rank was recognized  and he was called to surrender.    As May made his dash the infantry on our right was wading the lagoon. A  pause was made to dip our cups for water, which gave a moment for other  thoughts; mine went back to her whom I had left behind. I drew her  daguerreotype from my breast-pocket, had a glint of her charming smile,  and with quickened spirit mounted the bank in time to send some of the  mixed infantry troops to relieve May of his charge of the captive knight.    As a dragoon and soldier May was splendid. He stood six feet four without  boots, wore his beard full and flowing, his dark-brown locks falling well  over his shoulders. His appearance as he sat on his black horse Tom, his  heavy sabre over General La Vega, was grand and picturesque. He was  amiable of disposition, lovable and genial in character.    Not so grand of stature, or beard, or flowing locks, Randolph Ridgely was  as accomplished a soldier and as charming a companion,--a fitting  counterpart in spirit and dash.    I have gone thus far into the Mexican War for the opportunity to mention  two valued friends, whose memory returning refreshes itself. Many gallant,  courageous deeds have since been witnessed, but none more interesting than  Ridgely's call for the privilege to draw upon himself the fire that was  waiting for May.
