In the bottom of the vessel there is an  absorbing ring made of burnt or dried clay, which absorbs the moisture  escaping from the fruit. The air in the vessel is rarefied either  by heat or by the application of an air pump to the opening in the  bottom.    This apparatus was recently patented by Mr. Carl J. Renz, of Hudson,  N. Y.

(TRANSLATED FOR THE _COMMERCIAL BULLETIN._)      Gold and silver designs for carpeting and oilcloths have been hitherto  prepared in the following manner: The gold or silver were put in  leaves or bronze powder on the designs, which were printed with a  varnish of linseed oil, or similar adhesive. The bronze thus attached  did not possess much firmness, and the method was necessarily  expensive. The method recently adopted by Wohlforth is as follows:  The bronze powder is united at once to printing material. The liquid  silicate of potash, or of oxide of sodium, answers this purpose. One  part, by weight, of gold, silver, or bronze powder, along with two  parts of the silicate, will give a print color, which is easily  transferable by rollers to paper, oilcloth, and woods and metals. The  bronze thus printed dries very rapidly, and cannot be taken off by  oil or water, unless they are boiling. It bears light and heat  equally well, and especially sulphureted hydrogen, which has such  a destructive effect on bronzes put on in the form of powder. It is  recommended to thin the mass by an addition of warm water, 10 to 20  per cent, so as to keep it from becoming too hard during the process  of printing. An addition of glycerine or sirup, of 5 to 10 per cent.,  will be even preferable. The bronze color remaining on the printing  forms can be taken off by warm water.           *       *       *       *       *          THE EDISON ORE SEPARATOR NOT NEW    _To the Editor of the Scientific American:_    In your issue of June 19, 1880, I notice an illustration of an  electro-magnetic ore separator invented by Mr. Edison, and patented  June 1, 1880.    A device absolutely identical with this has been in use for the past  ten or fifteen years at the emery works at Chester, Hampden county,  Mass. I there saw it in use myself in November, 1876, and was  informed, I think by Mr. Ames, that it was not patented, and that no  valid patent could be granted upon it by reason of its long continued  public use.    My uncle, John S. Williams, of this city, president of the Ore Knob  Copper Company, had heard of the machine, and sent me to Chester with  a view to purchasing the right to use it at the Ore Knob Copper Works,  in Ashe county, North Carolina. On my return to Baltimore I had the  magnets constructed by Watts & Co., electricians, on November 24,  1876, for a large machine, similar to the one at Chester, which  machine was completed about December 10, 1876, and practically tested  at No. 52 Commerce St., Baltimore. It was sent to the Ore Knob Mine  about Christmas, 1876, to be used in separating magnetic oxide of iron  from the copper ore, and, for aught I know to the contrary, is in use  there yet. This is a striking instance of how history repeats itself  in inventions. Mr. Edison is doubtless an original inventor of the  device, but he most certainly is not the first inventor.    R. D.

Few articles meet with a readier sale or more promptly remunerate the  inventor than the class of inventions adapted to the use of children  either in their school life or in their amusements. One of these  useful little novelties is shown in our engraving. It is a slate  washer, consisting of two pieces of metal stamped up so as to form a  holder for the sponge at the top and the cloth drier at the bottom.  They also form a tubular receptacle containing a supply sponge, which  is moistened by removing the corks at the ends.    This invention was recently patented by Mr. Jacob A. Smith, of Salem,  Ohio.    [Illustration: SMITH'S SLATE WASHER.]           *       *       *       *       *          THE UTILIZATION OF GENESEE FALLS.    The plan to furnish Rochester, N. Y., with power for manufacturing and  for running street cars through the utilization of the falls of the  Genesee in compressing air, was described in this paper some weeks  ago. All the power of the lower falls, save what is needed to run two  wheels for factories already in operation, has been purchased by  the inventor of the system, and a promising beginning has been made.  According to the Rochester _Union_, a large gang of men are at work  building the crib just below the falls on the east side of the river  in a cove which seems to have been made by nature for this purpose.  This foundation is 100 feet long by 75 feet wide, and will have an  average depth of 13 feet. It is being constructed of solid logs of oak  timber bolted together, and the center will be filled with stone. On  the top of the crib will be erected the derrick, 125 feet high, and  the water will pour into it from the top of the falls through the  bulkheads at one end of the dam. The stand pipes will run from the  top of the derrick to the cylinders on the crib, which will be in the  neighborhood of 500 feet long. The whole machinery will be roofed in.  The difficulty in the way of getting the materials to the place,  they all having to be lowered over the falls, makes the work of  construction somewhat slow. It is expected, however, that the first  application of the system to the propulsion of street cars will be  possible in September next.           *       *       *       *       *          STEVENS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY.

We give herewith perspective and sectional views of an improved  portable shower bath, recently patented by Mr. James E. Vansant, of  Covington, Ky. It consists of a spherical vessel, having at the bottom  a supporting rim which admits of setting it on the floor when occasion  requires. The top is provided with a screw cap, perforated with  numerous small holes for discharging water in fine streams. In the  center of the cover there is a filling tube, which extends nearly to  the bottom of the vessel. A float is provided to indicate when the  vessel is filled, and shot contained in the two side tubes serves as  ballast to keep the device either in an upright or inverted position.    [Illustration: Fig. 1.--VANSANT'S PORTABLE SHOWER BATH.]    [Illustration: Fig. 2.--SECTION OF SHOWER BATH.]      The vessel is pivoted in a light jointed frame that admits of hanging  it up or setting it down. In use it is tipped by means of the cords  attached.           *       *       *       *       *          MINES AND RAILROADS OF LEADVILLE.    _To the Editor of the Scientific American:_    Nearly every person interested in geology sets up a theory of his own  with regard to the carbonate deposits of Leadville, immediately on  arriving in this famous district. There is, however, but one theory  which has been generally adopted by scientific men, formulated by  W. S. Keyes, General Manager of the Chrysolite Iron and Little Chief  Mines, and substantiated by the mute testimony of the fossil remains  that fix the geologic data. The theory is substantially as follows:    A shallow sea overspread this entire region. An even bed of limestone,  dolomitic, was formed by the myriads of shell-fish that subsisted in  this shallow sea. From some natural convulsion the waters flowed off,  leaving the sedimentary deposits. Subsequently the porphyritic rock  flowed over the surface in a pasty mass, covering the limestone. There  then followed two processes of ore making. The first was through the  mineralizing action of heated and ore depositing waters, coming up out  of the depths, and impregnating and permeating the hanging and foot  walls of the contact. No free oxygen was contained in these waters;  neither did they carry any chlorides or chlorobromides, wherein  consists the present richness of Leadville's ores; but in the first  process the ore was entirely in the form of sulphurets.    The second process was initiated by the uplifting of the mountain  ranges to their present height, at which time the diorites, those ore  indicators of the globe, uprose through the sedimentary strata.  Thus was the original surface of deposit bent and folded, and not  unfrequently entirely broken. The surface waters carrying free oxygen  and free carbonic acid now penetrated along the contact, and oxidized  the sulphurets, which formed free sulphuric acid, giving rise to  the sulphates and sulpho-carbonates. The irresistible law of gravity  distributed these sulphates, these oxides, and these carbonates in  vast bonanzas, that have been the wonder of the world. The fossil  trilobites of this region identify it with the silver lead districts  of Nevada, Utah, and Mexico. It is not anomalous, but simply richer  than its sister regions to the West and South.    The output of ore from the Leadville mines last year (1879) aggregated  122,483 tons, which represents a value of $11,477,046. That is to say,  there was an average yield at $90 per ton, or just $31,443.96 each  day. On the first day of May of the present year (1880), the returns  from thirty-seven of the leading mines gave a total daily output  of 8991/2 tons of ore, yielding, at the low average of $90 per ton,  something like $80,955 per"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38516"],[0,"The Children's Life of the Bee (#7)"],[1,"of bridge for the crowd which is ever mounting and  mounting. And, by slow degrees, these chains, as the number of bees  which form them becomes greater and greater, become a kind of dense,  three-cornered curtain. When the the last of the bees has joined itself  to this curtain that hangs in the darkness, all movement ceases in the  hive; and for long hours this strange cluster will wait, in a stillness  so complete as to be almost uncanny, for the mystery of wax to appear.    In the meantime, the rest of the bees--those whose business it was to  remain below in the hive--have paid not the smallest attention to the  others who were forming the curtain, and have made no effort whatever to  add themselves to the number. They have been told off to inspect the  hive, and to do what is immediately necessary. They start sweeping the  floor, and most carefully remove, one by one, every twig, grain of sand,  and dead leaf. This satisfactorily accomplished, they will most  thoroughly examine and test the floor of the new dwelling. They will  fill up every crack and crevice with a kind of raw wax; they will start  varnishing the walls, from the top to the bottom. A certain number of  guards will be sent to the gate, to take up their post there; and very  soon a detachment of workers will go forth to the fields, whence they  will come back with their store of pollen.      Before we raise the folds of the mysterious curtain, let us try to form  some idea of the skill and industry shown by the bees in fitting up the  new hive to serve their purposes. Within the walls there is merely a  desert; they must plan out their city, decide where the dwellings shall  be; and these must be built as quickly as possible, for the queen is  ready to begin to lay her eggs. They must consider the ventilation of  these dwellings, and these, too, must be strong and substantial.  Different buildings will be wanted for the different kinds of food that  are to be stored in them; also it is important that they should be  handily placed, so that there shall be no difficulty in finding them;  and passages and streets must be contrived between the cells and  store-houses. And there are many other problems besides, too many indeed  to relate, but they have all to be dealt with.    Bee-keepers provide different kinds of hives for the bees, ranging from  the hollow tree, or the earthenware pot, or the familiar bell-shaped  dome of straw which we find in our farmers' kitchen-gardens or under  their windows, hidden away between masses of sunflowers, phlox and  hollyhock, to what may be called the model factory, which is, as it  were, the last word of man's ingenuity as applied to the bee. It is a  building that will hold more than three hundred pounds of honey, having  three or four layers of combs set in a frame which makes it easy to  remove or handle the combs and take out the honey; after which, the  combs can be put back in their place like a book that we return to the  shelf. Now let us imagine that one fine day an obedient swarm of bees is  lodged in one of these hives. The little insects are expected to be able  to find their way about, to make their home there, to accept all these  strange things as natural. They have to make up their minds where the  winter storehouses shall be, and where the brood-cells; and these last  must not be too high or too low, neither too near to or far from the  entrance gate. The swarm may very likely just have come from the trunk  of a fallen tree, in which there was one long, narrow gallery; it finds  itself now in a tower-shaped building, whose ceiling is lost in the  gloom. And in the midst of this building is a confused and bewildering  network of frames and scaffolding, the like of which the bee never has  seen; and all around it are puzzling signs of the impertinent  interference of man.      But all this makes no difference to the bee; and no case has ever been  known of a swarm refusing to do its duty, or of allowing the strangeness  of its surroundings to discourage it--except only if the new home should  be too much exposed to the weather, or have an offensive smell. And even  then they will not give way to despair; they will promptly abandon the  place, fly away and seek better fortune a little further off.    But if no objection of this kind offers itself in a huge factory of this  kind, the bees will calmly go their own way, paying no heed whatever to  man's desires or intentions; the frames seem to them of use for their  combs, they will readily accept them. This will be more particularly the  case if the bee-keeper has artfully surrounded the upper layers of the  comb with a little strip of wax; the bees will pick out the wax, and go  on with the comb. If this should be covered all over with leaves of  foundation-wax, the bees will often be content to deepen and lengthen  the cells that have been traced out in the leaves, but will be careful  to alter the position of the cells should these not form an absolutely  straight line. And thus, in the space of a week, they will be in  possession of a city as comfortable and well-built as the one they have  left; whereas, in the ordinary way, if all the work had had to be done  by them, it would have taken them two or three months to erect the  buildings and storehouses out of their own shining wax.      Sir John Lubbock, who has written many interesting books on ants, bees,  and wasps, does not believe that the bee has any real intelligence of  its own, once it departs from what it has always been accustomed to do.  And as a proof of this he mentions an experiment that any one can try  for himself. If you put half a dozen bees, and the same number of flies  into a bottle, then place the bottle on the table with its foot to the  window, you will find that the bees will be quite unable to find their  way out, and will go on flinging themselves against the glass, till they  die of fatigue and hunger; while the flies will all have escaped, in  less than two minutes, through the open neck of the bottle. Sir John  Lubbock concludes from this that the bee cannot reason at all, and that  the fly shows more ingenuity in getting out of a difficulty. It is not  quite sure, however, that this conclusion is the right one. If you take  up the bottle and turn it round and round, holding now the neck and now  the foot to the window, you will find that the bees will turn with it,  so as always to face the light. It is their love of the light, it is  actually because of their intelligence, that they come to grief in this  experiment. They feel convinced that the escape from every prison must  be there where the light shines clearest. To them glass is a mystery  which they have never met with in nature; they cannot understand why  they are unable to pass through it, and convinced that there must be a  way, they persevere to the end; in fact, it is because of their  intelligence that they make these unhappy efforts to discover the  secret. The feather-brained flies, on the other hand, to whom the  mystery of glass means nothing and who possess no power of thought  whatever, merely flutter wildly hither and thither, and end by rushing  against the friendly opening that sets them free.      As another instance of the bees' lack of intelligence, Sir John Lubbock  quotes a passage from a book written by a great American bee-keeper, Mr.  Langstroth: \"As the fly has to feed on many substances in which it might  easily be drowned, it has learned to be very prudent, and alights  carefully on the edge of a vessel containing liquid food; the bee, on  the other hand, plunges in headlong, and very quickly perishes. The sad  fate of their companions does not hinder others from madly rushing in in  their turn, to share the same miserable end. No one can understand the  extent of their folly till he has seen a confectioner's shop which has  been besieged by a crowd of hungry bees. I have known thousands to be  strained out from a vat of sirup in which they had been drowned;  thousands more kept on plunging into the boiling sweets; the floors were  covered and the windows completely darkened with bees, some crawling,  others flying, and some so bedaubed that they could neither fly nor  crawl--not one bee in ten able to carry home its ill-gotten spoil, and  yet the air filled with new hosts of thoughtless comers!\"    It will not do, however, to condemn the bees too hastily; there is  something to be said on their side. They are accustomed to live in the  midst of nature, which has her own regular laws; and the ways of man are  strange and bewildering to them. In the forest, in their ordinary life,  the madness which Langstroth describes might have come over them if  some accident suddenly had destroyed a hive full of honey; but in that  case there would have been no fatal glass, no boiling sugar or cloying  sirup; there would have been no death or danger other than that to which  every animal is exposed while seeking its food. And let us remember too  that it was not mere greed, not the bees' own hunger, that caused them  to rush so wildly into the boiling vat. It was not for themselves that  they plunged into the deadly sugar; they can always feast on honey at  home, if they want to. The first thing the bee does when it returns to  the hive is to add the honey which it has gathered to the general store;  thirty times in an hour perhaps it will bring its offering to the  marvelous treasure-house. Their labors, therefore, their eagerness, have  no selfish motive; they have one desire, and one only, to increase the  wealth in the home of their sisters, which is also the home of the  future.      However, the whole truth must be told. Their industry is beyond all  praise; their methods, their sacrifice of self, arouse all our  admiration; but there is one thing that shocks us somewhat, and that is  the indifference with which they regard the misfortunes or death of  their comrades.
