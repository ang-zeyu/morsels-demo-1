Vizard and Co., of Lincoln's Inn, to procure his  lordship's signature to a legal instrument. On his arrival, the clerk  sent a message to the noble poet, who appointed to receive him on the  following morning. Each party was punctual to the minute. His lordship  had dressed himself with the most studious care; and, on the opening of  the door of his apartment, it was evident that he had placed himself in  what he thought a becoming _pose_. His right arm was displayed over the  back of a splendid couch, and his head was gently supported by the  fingers of his left hand. He bowed slightly as his visitor approached  him, and appeared anxious that his recumbent attitude should remain for  a time undisturbed. After the signing of the deed, the noble bard made a  few inquiries upon the politics of England, in the tone of a finished  exquisite. Some refreshment which was brought in afforded the messenger  an opportunity for more minute observation. His lordship's hair had been  curled and parted on the forehead; the collar of his shirt was thrown  back, so that not only the throat but a considerable portion of his  bosom was exposed to view, though partially concealed by some fanciful  ornament suspended round the neck. His waistcoat was of costly velvet,  and his legs were enveloped in a superb wrapper. It is to be regretted  that so great a mind as that of Byron could derive satisfaction from  things so trivial and unimportant, but much more that it was liable to  be disturbed by a recollection of personal imperfections. In the above  interview, the clerk directed an accidental glance at his lordship's  lame foot, when the smile that had played upon the visage of the poet  became suddenly converted into a frown. His whole frame appeared  discomposed; his tone of affected suavity became hard and imperious; and  he called to an attendant to open the door, with a peevishness seldom  exhibited even by the most irritable.           *       *       *       *       *      LORD BYRON'S APOLOGY.    No one knew how to apologize for an affront with better grace, or with  more delicacy, than Lord Byron. In the first edition of the first  canto of _Childe Harold_, the poet adverted in a note to two political  tracts--one by Major Pasley, and the other by Gould Francis Leckie,  Esq.; and concluded his remarks by attributing \"ignorance on the one  hand, and prejudice on the other.\" Mr. Leckie, who felt offended at the  severity and, as he thought, injustice of the observations, wrote to  Lord Byron, complaining of the affront. His lordship did not reply  immediately to the letter; but, in about three weeks, he called upon  Mr. Leckie, and begged him to accept an elegantly-bound copy of a new  edition of the poem, in which the offensive passage was omitted.           *       *       *       *       *      FINE FLOURISHES.    Lord Brougham, in an essay published long ago in the _Edinburgh Review_,  read a smart lesson to Parliamentary wits. \"A wit,\" says his lordship,  \"though he amuses for the moment, unavoidably gives frequent offence to  grave and serious men, who don't think public affairs should be lightly  handled, and are constantly falling into the error that when a person  is arguing the most conclusively, by showing the gross and ludicrous  absurdity of his adversary's reasoning, he is jesting, and not arguing;  while the argument is, in reality, more close and stringent, the more he  shows the opposite picture to be grossly ludicrous--that is, the more  effective the wit becomes. But, though all this is perfectly true, it is  equally certain that danger attends such courses with the common run of  plain men.    \"Nor is it only by wit that genius offends: flowers of imagination,  flights of oratory, great passages, are more admired by the critic than  relished by the worthy baronets who darken the porch of Boodle's--chiefly  answering to the names of Sir Robert and Sir John--and the solid  traders, the very good men who stream along the Strand from 'Change  towards St. Stephen's Chapel, at five o'clock, to see the business of  the country done by the Sovereign's servants. A pretty long course of  observation on these component parts of a Parliamentary audience begets  some doubt if noble passages, (termed 'fine flourishes,') be not taken  by them as personally offensive.\"    Take, for example, \"such fine passages as Mr. Canning often indulged  himself and a few of his hearers with; and which certainly seemed to be  received as an insult by whole benches of men accustomed to distribute  justice at sessions. These worthies, the dignitaries of the empire,  resent such flights as liberties taken with them; and always say, when  others force them to praise--'Well, well, but it was out of place; we  have nothing to do with king Priam here, or with a heathen god, such  as AEolus; those kind of folk are all very well in Pope's _Homer_ and  Dryden's _Virgil_; but, as I said to Sir Robert, who sat next me, what  have you or I to do with them matters? I like a good plain man of  business, like young Mr. Jenkinson--a man of the pen and desk, like his  father was before him--and who never speaks when he is not wanted: let  me tell you, Mr. Canning speaks too much by half. Time is short--there  are only twenty four hours in the day, you know.'\"           *       *       *       *       *      MATHEMATICAL SAILORS.    Nathaniel Bowditch, the translator of Laplace's _Mecanique Celeste_,  displayed in very early life a taste for mathematical studies. In the  year 1788, when he was only fifteen years old, he actually made an  almanack for the year 1790, containing all the usual tables, calculations  of the eclipses, and other phenomena, and even the customary predictions  of the weather.    Bowditch was bred to the sea, and in his early voyages taught navigation  to the common sailors about him. Captain Prince, with whom he often  sailed, relates, that one day the supercargo of the vessel said to him,  \"Come, Captain, let us go forward and hear what the sailors are talking  about under the lee of the long-boat.\" They went forward accordingly,  and the captain was surprised to find the sailors, instead of spinning  their long yarns, earnestly engaged with book, slate, and pencil,  discussing the high matters of tangents and secants, altitudes, dip,  and refraction. Two of them, in particular, were very zealously  disputing,--one of them calling out to the other, \"Well, Jack, what have  you got?\" \"I've got the _sine_,\" was the answer. \"But that ain't right,\"  said the other; \"_I_ say it is the _cosine_.\"           *       *       *       *       *      LEWIS'S \"MONK.\"    This romance, on its first appearance, roused the attention of all the  literary world of England, and even spread its writer's name to the  continent. The author--\"wonder-working Lewis,\" was a stripling under  twenty when he wrote _The Monk_ in the short space of ten weeks! Sir  Walter Scott, probably the most rapid composer of fiction upon record,  hardly exceeded this, even in his latter days, when his facility of  writing was the greatest.           *       *       *       *       *      THOMSON'S RECITATIONS.    Thomson, the author of the \"Seasons,\" was a very awkward reader of his  own productions. His patron, Doddington, once snatched a MS. from  his hand, provoked by his odd utterance, telling him that he did not  understand his own verses! A gentleman of Brentford, however, told the  late Dr. Evans, in 1824, that there was a tradition in that town of  Thomson frequenting one of the inns there, and reciting his poems to the  company.           *       *       *       *       *      GOLDSMITH'S \"SHE STOOPS TO CONQUER.\"    Goldsmith, during the first performance of this comedy, walked all the  time in St. James' Park in great uneasiness. Finally, when he thought  that it must be over, hastening to the theatre, hisses assailed his  ears as he entered the green-room. Asking in eager alarm of Colman the  cause--\"Pshaw, pshaw!\" said Colman, \"don't be afraid of squibs, when we  have been sitting on a barrel of gunpowder for two hours.\" The comedy  had completely triumphed--the audience were only hissing the after  farce. Goldsmith had some difficulty in getting the piece on the stage,  as appears from the following letter to Colman:--\"I entreat you'll  relieve me from that state of suspense in which I have been kept for a  long time. Whatever objections you have made, or shall make, to my play,  I will endeavour to remove, and not argue about them. To bring in any  new judges either of its merits or faults, I can never submit to. Upon a  former occasion, when my other play was before Mr. Garrick, he offered  to bring me before Mr. Whitehead's tribunal, but I refused the proposal  with indignation. I hope I shall not experience as hard treatment from  you, as from him. I have, as you know, a large sum of money to make up  shortly; by accepting my play, I can readily satisfy my creditor that  way; at any rate, I must look about to some certainty to be prepared.  For God's sake take the play, and let us make the best of it; and let me  have the same measure at least which you have given as bad plays as  mine.\"           *       *       *       *       *      SILENCE NOT ALWAYS WISDOM.    Coleridge once dined in company with a person who listened to him, and  said nothing for a long time; but he nodded his head, and Coleridge  thought him intelligent. At length, towards the end of the dinner, some  apple dumplings were placed on the table, and the listener had no sooner  seen them than he burst forth, \"Them's the jockeys for me!\" Coleridge  adds: \"I wish Spurzheim could have examined the fellow's head.\"    Coleridge was very luminous in conversation,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/304"],[0,"Rio Grande's Last Race, and Other Verses (#7)"],[1,"drew the whip and dropped it on the mare --    I let her have it twice, and then she shot    Ahead of me, and Smithy opened out    And let her up beside him on the rails,    And kept her there a-beltin' her like smoke    Until she struggled past him pullin' hard    And came to Ike; but Ikey drew his whip    And hit her on the nose and sent her back    And won the race himself -- for, after all,    It seems he had a fiver on the Dook    And never told us -- so our stuff was lost.    And then they had us up for ridin' foul,    And warned us off the tracks for twelve months each,    To get our livin' any way we could;    But Ikey wasn't touched, because his boss    Was judge and steward and the Lord knows what.      But Mister -- if you'll lend us half-a-crown,    I know three certain winners at the Park --    Three certain cops as no one knows but me;    And -- thank you, Mister, come an' have a beer    (I always like a beer about this time) . . .    Well, so long, Mister, till we meet again.          The Road to Gundagai          The mountain road goes up and down,    From Gundagai to Tumut Town.      And branching off there runs a track,    Across the foothills grim and black,      Across the plains and ranges grey    To Sydney city far away.           .    .    .    .    .      It came by chance one day that I    From Tumut rode to Gundagai.      And reached about the evening tide    The crossing where the roads divide;      And, waiting at the crossing place,    I saw a maiden fair of face,      With eyes of deepest violet blue,    And cheeks to match the rose in hue --      The fairest maids Australia knows    Are bred among the mountain snows.      Then, fearing I might go astray,    I asked if she could show the way.      Her voice might well a man bewitch --    Its tones so supple, deep, and rich.      'The tracks are clear,' she made reply,    'And this goes down to Sydney town,    And that one goes to Gundagai.'      Then slowly, looking coyly back,    She went along the Sydney track.      And I for one was well content    To go the road the lady went;      But round the turn a swain she met --    The kiss she gave him haunts me yet!           .    .    .    .    .      I turned and travelled with a sigh    The lonely road to Gundagai.          Saltbush Bill's Second Fight          The news came down on the Castlereagh, and went to the world at large,    That twenty thousand travelling sheep, with Saltbush Bill in charge,    Were drifting down from a dried-out run to ravage the Castlereagh;    And the squatters swore when they heard the news,      and wished they were well away:    For the name and the fame of Saltbush Bill were over the country side    For the wonderful way that he fed his sheep,      and the dodges and tricks he tried.    He would lose his way on a Main Stock Route,      and stray to the squatters' grass;    He would come to a run with the boss away, and swear he had leave to pass;    And back of all and behind it all, as well the squatters knew,    If he had to fight, he would fight all day, so long as his sheep got through:    But this is the story of Stingy Smith, the owner of Hard Times Hill,    And the way that he chanced on a fighting man to reckon with Saltbush Bill.           .    .    .    .    .      'Twas Stingy Smith on his stockyard sat, and prayed for an early Spring,    When he stared at sight of a clean-shaved tramp, who walked with jaunty swing;    For a clean-shaved tramp with a jaunty walk a-swinging along the track    Is as rare a thing as a feathered frog on the desolate roads out back.    So the tramp he made for the travellers' hut,      and asked could he camp the night;    But Stingy Smith had a bright idea, and he said to him, 'Can you fight?'    'Why, what's the game?' said the clean-shaved tramp,      as he looked at him up and down --    'If you want a battle, get off that fence, and I'll kill you for half-a-crown!    But, Boss, you'd better not fight with me, it wouldn't be fair nor right;    I'm Stiffener Joe, from the Rocks Brigade, and I killed a man in a fight:    I served two years for it, fair and square, and now I'm a trampin' back,    To look for a peaceful quiet life away on the outside track ----'    'Oh, it's not myself, but a drover chap,' said Stingy Smith with glee;    'A bullying fellow, called Saltbush Bill -- and you are the man for me.    He's on the road with his hungry sheep, and he's certain to raise a row,    For he's bullied the whole of the Castlereagh till he's got them under cow --    Just pick a quarrel and raise a fight, and leather him good and hard,    And I'll take good care that his wretched sheep don't wander a half a yard.    It's a five-pound job if you belt him well -- do anything short of kill,    For there isn't a beak on the Castlereagh will fine you for Saltbush Bill.'      'I'll take the job,' said the fighting man; 'and hot as this cove appears,    He'll stand no chance with a bloke like me,      what's lived on the game for years;    For he's maybe learnt in a boxing school, and sparred for a round or so,    But I've fought all hands in a ten-foot ring each night in a travelling show;    They earned a pound if they stayed three rounds,      and they tried for it every night --    In a ten-foot ring!  Oh, that's the game that teaches a bloke to fight,    For they'd rush and clinch, it was Dublin Rules, and we drew no colour line;    And they all tried hard for to earn the pound, but they got no pound of mine:    If I saw no chance in the opening round I'd slog at their wind, and wait    Till an opening came -- and it ALWAYS came -- and I settled 'em, sure as fate;    Left on the ribs and right on the jaw --      and, when the chance comes, MAKE SURE!    And it's there a professional bloke like me gets home on an amateur:    For it's my experience every day, and I make no doubt it's yours,    That a third-class pro is an over-match for the best of the amateurs ----'    'Oh, take your swag to the travellers' hut,'      said Smith, 'for you waste your breath;    You've a first-class chance, if you lose the fight,      of talking your man to death.    I'll tell the cook you're to have your grub, and see that you eat your fill,    And come to the scratch all fit and well to leather this Saltbush Bill.'           .    .    .    .    .      'Twas Saltbush Bill, and his travelling sheep were wending their weary way    On the Main Stock Route, through the Hard Times Run,      on their six-mile stage a day;    And he strayed a mile from the Main Stock Route, and started to feed along,    And, when Stingy Smith came up, Bill said that the Route was surveyed wrong;    And he tried to prove that the sheep had rushed      and strayed from their camp at night,    But the fighting man he kicked Bill's dog, and of course that meant a fight:    So they sparred and fought, and they shifted ground      and never a sound was heard    But the thudding fists on their brawny ribs, and the seconds' muttered word,    Till the fighting man shot home his left on the ribs with a mighty clout,    And his right flashed up with a half-arm blow -- and Saltbush Bill 'went out'.    He fell face down, and towards the blow;      and their hearts with fear were filled,    For he lay as still as a fallen tree, and they thought that he must be killed.    So Stingy Smith and the fighting man, they lifted him from the ground,    And sent to home for a brandy-flask, and they slowly fetched him round;    But his head was bad, and his jaw was hurt --      in fact, he could scarcely speak --    So they let him spell till he got his wits, and he camped on the run a week,    While the travelling sheep went here and there, wherever they liked to stray,    Till Saltbush Bill was fit once more for the track to the Castlereagh.           .    .    .    .    .      Then Stingy Smith he wrote a note, and gave to the fighting man:    'Twas writ to the boss of the neighbouring run, and thus the missive ran:    'The man with this is a fighting man, one Stiffener Joe by name;    He came near murdering Saltbush Bill, and I found it a costly game:    But it's worth your while to employ the chap,      for there isn't the slightest doubt    You'll have no trouble from Saltbush Bill while this man hangs about ----'    But an answer came by the next week's mail, with news that might well appal:    'The man you sent with a note is not a fighting man at all!    He has shaved his beard, and has cut his hair, but I spotted him at a look;    He is Tom Devine, who has worked for years for Saltbush Bill as cook.    Bill coached him up in the fighting yarn, and taught him the tale by rote,    And they shammed to fight, and they got your grass      and divided your five-pound note.    'Twas a clean take-in, and you'll find it wise --      'twill save you a lot of pelf --    When next you're hiring a fighting man, just fight him a round yourself.'           .    .    .    .    .      And the teamsters out on the Castlereagh, when they meet with a week of rain,    And the waggon sinks to its axle-tree, deep down in the black soil plain,    When the bullocks wade in a sea of mud, and strain at the load of wool,    And the cattle-dogs at the bullocks' heels are biting to make them pull,    When the off-side driver flays the team, and curses them while he flogs,    And the air is thick with the language used,      and the clamour of men and dogs --    The teamsters say, as they pause to rest and moisten each hairy throat,    They wish they could swear like Stingy Smith      when he read that neighbour's note.          Hard Luck          I left the course, and by my side     There walked a ruined tout --    A hungry creature evil-eyed,     Who poured this story out.      'You see,' he said, 'there came a swell     To Kensington to-day,    And if I picked the winners well,     A crown at least he'd pay.      'I picked three winners straight, I did,     I filled his purse with pelf,"]]]
