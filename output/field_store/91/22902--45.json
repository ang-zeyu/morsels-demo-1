Girolamo della Carita was exhibited, \"it was so abused by  all the eminent painters, of whom many then flourished, that he himself  joined in its condemnation, in order to save his credit.\" See  Falconieri, Lett. Pittor. tom. ii. lett. 17. He continues: \"Is not the  tribune of the church of S. Andrea della Valle, ornamented by  Domenichino, among the finest specimens of painting in fresco? and yet  they talked of sending masons with hammers to knock it down after he had  displayed it. When Domenichino afterwards passed through the church, he  stopped with his scholars to view it; and, shrugging up his shoulders,  observed, 'After all, I do not think the picture so badly executed.'\"]    [Footnote 21: The most singular and novel opinions concerning our  painters are contained in the volumes published by M. Cochin, who is  confuted in the _Guides_ to the cities of Padua and Parma, and is often  convicted of erroneous statements in matter of fact. He is reproved,  with regard to Bologna, by Crespi, in Lett. Pittor. tom. vii.; and for  what he has said of Genoa, by Ratti, in the lives of the painters of  that city. Commencing with his preface, they point out the grossest  errors in Cochin. It is there also observed that his work was  disapproved of by Watellet, by Clerisseau, and other French connoisseurs  then living: nor do I believe it would have pleased Filibien, De Piles,  and such masters of the critical art. Italy also, at a later period, has  produced a book, which aims at overturning the received opinions on  subjects connected with the fine arts. It is entitled _Arte di vedere  secondo i principii di Sulzer e di Mengs_. The author, who in certain  periodical works at Rome, was called the modern Diogenes, has been  honoured with various confutations. (See _Lettera in Difesa del Cav.  Ratti_, p. 11.) Authors like these launch their extravagant opinions,  for the purpose of attracting the gaze of the world; but men of letters,  if they cannot pass them over in silence, ought not to be very anxious  to gratify their wishes--\"Opinionum commenta delet dies.\" _Cicero._]    [Footnote 22: Of Apelles himself Pliny observes, \"Vulgum diligentiorem  judicem quam se praeferens.\" Examine also Carlo Dati in _Vite de' Pittori  Antichi_, p. 99, where he proves, by authority and examples, that  judgment, in the imitative arts, is not confined to the learned.

Agucchi, in a fragment preserved by Bellori, in  _Vite de' Pittori, Scultori, e Architetti moderni_, p. 190.]            BIOGRAPHICAL NOTICE.[24]      Luigi Lanzi was born in the year 1732, at Monte dell' Olmo, in the  diocese of Fermo, of an ancient family, which is said to have enjoyed  some of the chief honours of the municipality to which it belonged. His  father was a physician, and also a man of letters: his mother, a truly  excellent and pious woman, was allied to the family of the Firmani. How  deeply sensible the subject of this memoir was of the advantages he  derived, in common with many illustrious characters, from early maternal  precepts and direction, he has shewn in a beautiful Latin elegy to her  memory, which appeared in his work, entitled _Inscriptionum et  Carminum_.    Possessed of a naturally lively and penetrating turn of mind, he began  early to investigate the merits of the great writers of his own country;  alike in poetry, in history, and in art. His poetical taste was formed  on the models of Petrarch and of Dante, and he was accustomed, while yet  a child, to repeat their finest passages to his father, an enthusiastic  admirer of Italy's old poets, who took pride in cultivating the same  fervour in the mind of his son, a fervour of which in more northern  climates, we can form little idea. His imitations of these early poets,  whose spirit he first imbibed at the fountain head, before he grew  familiar with the corrupt and tasteless compositions of succeeding eras,  are said to have frequently been so bold and striking, as to deceive the  paternal eye. To these, too, he was perhaps mainly indebted for that  energy of feeling, and solidity of judgment, as well as that richness of  illustration and allusion, which confer attractions upon his most  serious and elaborate works. He was no less intimate with the best  political and literary historians at an early age; with Machiavelli,  Davila, and Guicciardini; with Muratori and Tiraboschi; whose respective  compositions he was destined to rival in the world of art.    Lanzi's first studies were pursued in the Jesuits' College at Fermo,  where an Italian Canzone, written in praise of the Beata Vergine, is  said to have acquired for him, as a youth of great promise, the highest  degree of regard. Under the care of his spiritual instructor, father  Raimondo Cunich, Lanzi likewise became deeply versed in all the  excellences of classical literature, not as a vain parade of words and  syllables; for along with the technical skill of the scholar, he imbibed  the spirit of the ancient writers. In his succeeding philosophical and  mathematical studies he was assisted by Father Boscovich, one of the  first mathematicians of his day. Thus to a keen and fertile intellect,  animated by enthusiasm for true poetry and the beauties of art, was  added that regular classical and scientific learning, inducing a love of  order and of truth, capable of applying the clear logic derived from  Euclid to advantage, in subjects of a less tangible and demonstrative  nature. The value of such preliminary acquirements to the examination of  antiquarian and scientific remains, which can only be conducted on  uncertain data and a calculation of possibilities, as in ancient  specimens of art, can bear no question; and of this truth Lanzi was  fully aware. To feel rightly, to reason clearly, to decide upon  probabilities, to distinguish degrees, resemblances, and differences,  comparing and weighing the whole with persevering accuracy; these were  among the essentials which Lanzi conceived requisite to prepare a writer  upon works of art.    These qualities, too, will be found finely relieved and elevated by  frequent and appropriate passages of eloquent feeling; flowing from that  sincere veneration for his subject, and that love which may be termed  the religion of the art to which he became so early attached. How  intimately such a spirit is connected with the best triumphs of the art  of painting, is seen in the angelic faces of Da Vinci, of Raffaello, and  Coreggio; and the same enthusiasm must have been felt by a true critic,  such as Lanzi. Far, however, from impeding him in the acquisition of his  stores of antiquarian knowledge, and in his scientific arrangements, his  enthusiasm conferred upon him only an incredible degree of diligence and  despatch. He was at once enabled to decipher the age and character, to  arrange in its proper class, and to give the most exact description of  every object of art which passed under his review.    Lanzi thus came admirably prepared to his great task, one of the most  complete models of sound historical composition, of which the modern age  can boast. It was written in the full maturity of his powers; no hasty  or isolated undertaking, it followed a series of other excellent  treatises, all connected with some branches of the subject, and  furnishing materials for his grand design. Circumstances further  contributed to promote his views. Shortly after the dissolution of the  order of Jesuits, to which he belonged, he was recommended by his friend  Fabroni, prior of the church of S. Lorenzo, to the grand duke Leopold of  Florence, who, in 1775, appointed him to the care of his cabinet of  medals and gems, in the gallery of Florence. This gave rise to one of  his first publications, entitled, _A Description of the Florentine  Gallery_, which he sent in 1782 to the same friend, Angiolo Fabroni,  then General Provveditore of the Studio at Pisa, and who conducted the  celebrated Literary Journal of that place, in which Lanzi's DESCRIPTION  appeared.    His next dissertation, still more enriched with antiquarian illustration  and research, was his Essay on the _Ancient Italian dialects_, which  contains a curious account of old Etruscan monuments, and the ducal  collection of classical vases and urns. This was followed by his  _Preliminary Notices respecting the Sculpture of the Ancients, and their  various Styles_, put forth in the year 1789, in which he pursues the  same plan which he subsequently perfected in the history before us, of  allotting to each style its respective epochs, to each epoch its  peculiar characters, these last being exemplified by their leading  professors, most celebrated in history. He farther adduces examples of  his system as he proceeds, from the various cabinets of the Royal  Museum, which he explains to the reader as a part of his chief design in  illustrating them. He enters largely into the origin and character of  the Etruscan School, and examines very fully the criticisms, both on  ancient and Italian art, by Winckelmann and Mengs.    From the period of these publications, the Grand Duke, entertaining a  high opinion of Lanzi's judgment, was in the habit of consulting him  before he ventured to add any new specimens to his cabinet of  antiquities. He was also "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34501"],[0,"Wolf and Coyote Trapping: An Up-to-Date Wolf Hunter's Guide (#7)"],[1,"be readily located.      [Illustration: Young Wolf Pups at the Entrance of a Den.]    One hunter who uses a dog for this style of hunting says: \"The kind  of a dog needed is a good ranger, extra good cold trailer and an  everlasting stayer. Then if he will only run a short distance after  starting the wolf and come back and hunt the pups and then bark at  them when found, you have a good dog that is worth a large price.  There are plenty of dogs that will hunt and trail wolves all right,  but very few that will hunt the pups.\"    The den is usually a natural one; a hole worn in the rocks by the  elements, or in washed out cavities in the hard ground of the bad  lands. Down in the valleys they sometimes den in the ground,  enlarging the burrow of a badger or other animal. The opening is, as  a rule, large enough to allow one to enter and secure the pups, but  sometimes it will be necessary to dig the den open. For dens in the  rocks, which are too small to allow one to enter, the hunter should  provide a hook, something on the order of a gaff hook such as is used  by fishermen. The hook should be of fair size, very sharp, and should  be attached to a handle about three or four feet in length. A famous  western wolf hunter in speaking of his outfit says:    \"I will say to the boys who intend to hunt pups, get two or three  strong fish hooks and a strong cord and carry them in your pocket.  You can usually find a small stick or pole of some kind. When you  find a den, tie your hooks on end of stick, wrapping cord very tight.  If you use two hooks, put one on each side of stick. Shove your stick  in the den among the pups and turn or twist it and you will soon have  a pup hooked. This works the best of anything I have ever tried;  where pups are small. I have gotten many a bunch or pups this way,  when my pick or shovel would be five or six miles away.      [Illustration: The Hunter's Outfit.]    When the pups get too large and strong to pull out alive, I put a  candle on the stick, shove it into the den and lay on my stomach.  With a 22 rifle I shoot the pups in the head and then they are easily  pulled out with the fish hooks. I mean this for dens that cannot be  dug out, as there are many of them in rock ledges and in holes in the  solid rock. Instead of the candles mentioned by this hunter, some  prefer to use a lantern and one \"wolfer\" uses a hunting lamp,  attached to his hat. Some sort of firearm should be carried always. A  revolver is good for use in the den, but a rifle is best outside.      [074 An Oklahoma Hunter with Young Coyotes Taken from Den.]    It is not often that the mother wolf will be found in the den, as she  usually makes her escape before one comes near, but should she be  found at home she should be disposed of first. There is no danger,  whatever, from the adult wolves. One of our western friends in  speaking of this says: \"I never hesitate in entering a wolf den, even  when I know the mother wolf is with her young, and have never known  one to act vicious, but always sneaking and cowardly. A few years ago  at the Cypress Hills in Canada I entered a den and took ten pups. The  mother crawled as far from me as she could and never raised her head.  I set my 30-30 Savage and pulled it off with a rope, shooting her  through the heart. It was forty feet from the entrance of the hole to  where she lay, and it was midnight when I got her out. I had to move  some dirt and rocks and it was a big job.    \"I have killed other grown wolves in the den and have never known one  to show fight. Of course, I always use a lantern to see what I am  doing, and would not enter a den without one.\" The young wolves  should be killed immediately and live pups should never be handled  with bare hands, as blood poisoning is likely to result from a bite.        CHAPTER VI.    HUNTING WOLVES WITH DOGS.    Beyond all doubt wolf chasing as it is practiced in some parts of the  country is one of the most fascinating of sports and in a place where  the animals are fairly plentiful and the surface of the country is  not too rough, is also profitable. In parts of the states of  Minnesota, Wisconsin and Michigan, some of the professional wolfers  use this method of securing their game and in the states lying west  of the Mississippi River and east of the Rocky Mountains, also in  Western Canada, wolf hunting is a very popular sport among the  ranchmen.    Among the dogs that are most approved of by the wolf and coyote  hunters, may be mentioned the fox hound, the greyhounds, and stag  hounds of various varieties, the bloodhound and crosses of these  dogs. The grey hounds are the swiftest of dogs and a pair of them are  invariably to be found in a pack, the balance being some heavier and  fiercer breed of dog, such as the blood hound, fox hound or a cross  of the two. It is the grey hounds that run the game down and hold it  until the arrival of the balance of the pack, the heavier dogs doing  the actual fighting.    One who has followed wolf hunting extensively gives the following  short but interesting description of the sport: \"On the open plains  of the west, wolves are often hunted with large swift running dogs,  grey hounds, stag or wolf hounds or their crosses. The hunters go on  horseback and the wolves are usually roused out of some coulee or  draw. Sometimes trail hounds are used to start the game, on breaking  from cover and being sighted by the running dogs the race is on.  Wolf, dogs and horsemen, race across the often rough and dangerous  ground at breakneck speed. The wolf, maneuvering to gain the coulee  or cover of some sort and get out of sight of the dogs (the running  dogs have only slight scenting powers and depend entirely on their  sight). The lighter and swifter grey hounds, as a rule, are the first  to overtake the wolf and by coming up alongside and snapping at his  flanks, force him to turn and face them, thus giving the heavier and  fiercer wolf hounds a chance to close in and grapple with and kill  the wolf. Unless the dogs are well trained and very courageous, a  large timber wolf often proves more than a match for the bunch of  four or five dogs.\"    No matter what kind of dogs are used, they must be good tonguers and  good fighters, and must have an abundance of strength and endurance.  It is needless to say that the dog must be trained and this must be  done at an early age. The young dog should never be run alone, for  the wolf is likely to fight it off and once the young dog is driven  back it will be spoiled for hunting purposes.    One of our Kansas friends in speaking of wolf dogs says: \"We have  plenty of wolves (coyotes) and have had for the twenty years we have  kept dogs. As to breeding, we used an English greyhound bitch with  courage, speed and a special hatred for a wolf, crossed with an  English fox hound with all the qualities necessary, except the speed.  We then picked the bitch with the most good qualities and crossed her  with another fox hound whose ancestry is perfect. Here we get the dog  we are using now and with which we have made the most satisfactory of  catches. We seldom have a run lasting more than three hours and catch  many, when vegetation is not too high, in from one to one and a half  hours. Where this dog has the advantage over the fox hound is in  speed and the fact that it is ever on the watch ahead for the game.\"    Evidently the party who used this breed of dog has endeavored to  instill into the one type, all of the good qualities of the several  breeds that go to make up the regulation pack of wolf dogs. It is  surmised, also, that the one breed of dog is used alone, when chasing  wolves. In Western Canada, wolf hunting is a favorite sport and one  of the hunters from that section in speaking on this subject gives  the following method of hunting:    \"First, we put a box on the sleigh big enough to hold our dogs and  then hook up a lively team, and strike across the country, leaving  the dogs run along side. When a wolf is sighted, we get the dogs into  the box and drive as close to the wolf as we can--that's usually from  three to five hundred yards--then turn the dogs loose and cheer them  to victory. The dogs usually run down the wolf within a mile, and we  follow as fast as horse flesh can take us. When the leading dog gets  alongside, the wolf stops, and in a second the dogs form a circle  around him and he is a goner. Some hunters just turn the dogs loose,  not knowing when they are ever going to see them again. That plan  would not work with me. Good hounds are too expensive to monkey with  that way. I have found that letting one or two dogs on a wolf trail  spoils them, because one wolf will give two dogs all they can handle,  and sometimes a little bit more, especially if they are young dogs.  It takes two old dogs at least, to handle one wolf, and I have seen  them get the hard end of it. The wolf perhaps would take to running  into the scrub and then it wouldn't be long until a pair of wolves  would be slashing your dogs or 'fleecing' the stuffing out of them.\"      [Illustration: Catch of a Canadian Hunter Who Uses Dogs.]    Those who make a business of wolf hunting, or in other words, those  who hunt for profit, do not always allow the dogs to fight and kill  the wolf, but carry a gun with them, on all occasions and if they  have an opportunity to shorten the chase by means of a well directed  bullet, do not hesitate to do so. A high powered rifle should be used  and one should learn to handle it in a business-like way. In the  Western States where the large ranches are rapidly disappearing and  the farm, with the barbed wire fence is taking its place, wolf  hunting will soon be a thing of the past. Mr. Jack Kinsey, one of the  most noted wolfers of the West, gives a description of an exciting  wolf chase, in which he illustrates this point, and we give the story  in his own words:    \"While I was in Dakota last winter I had two"]]]
