The method recommended is only the \"path method,\" and to be used  altogether without any bait or scents; as I believe the best results  are obtained by just taking a fox unawares, and the whole secret is  in choosing the place, then knowing just how to conceal the trap, and  have everything as natural as possible when the set is made.    Look for fox tracks in stock paths, in pastures, fields, and woods,  in large gullies, washouts and places under fences, old roads not  much used, sand bars along streams, and other places; always  selecting a narrow place for your set; approaching such places with  trap ready set and wired to the brush, then with ready sharpened hard  wood stick, stop and stand in one place until trap is properly set,  when you can just walk right on to the next place.    Always dig the pit just the size of trap to be used, having the  springs lengthwise in the path or trail--not across it--and just deep  enough so the trap will be a little below the surface level when put  in the pit. Cover over springs and around the outside of the jaws  with dirt, lay a piece of paper over pan and jaws, or put fine moss,  cotton, wool or dead grass inside of jaws and under pan; then haul on  the fine dirt, just enough of it to thinly cover all, brush with a  twig to level and complete the set by laying a couple of dead weeds,  or small sticks, just haphazard like some two or three inches on each  side of the trap.    As soon as you kill your fox, reset the trap in the same pit, but if  your brush drag is chewed up, replace it with a new one. In addition,  if it is a female fox that is caught, kill it near a path or any good  place where a set can be made and where you have lately noticed a  fox's track; then conceal and secure your trap as before, and the  chances are as good for you to catch one or more fox at this set.      [Illustration: SACKING FOXES.]    Now try this method all the way through and you will soon see that I  am right. My brother set his first fox trap Dec. 9th and on the  morning of the 10th had a large female red fox and killed it in a  pasture near a path, and that night caught the largest dog fox I ever  saw or heard of.    He got both these foxes just exactly as the above method indicates.  The dog fox weighed 19 pounds and its hide measured 5 ft. 5 inches on  the board. The old fox had lots of gray hairs on his head, evidently  an old timer.        CHAPTER X.    WIRE AND TWINE SNARE.    Various are the ways being studied for the capture of the fox and  other shy animals, says J. H. Shufelt, of Canada. Most every trapper  has a particular method of his own. Years ago trappers thought it was  necessary to set in water in order to be successful in catching  foxes, but after a closer acquaintance with the ways of the fox, it  was found that they were easily caught in a steel trap on dry land in  many ways. At the present time the trapper has found a less expensive  way of catching them with the snare. This method has many advantages,  and when properly set is a sure thing. It takes in most of those old  sly ones that have been nipped by steel traps, etc.    The method shown here is only one of the many ways of the snare.  Owing to the peculiar fastening of the snare, a powerful spring pole  or weight can be used with a lighter wire. I use a copper or brass  wire 1 gauge, with a foot or more slack between fastenings, which  gives the spring pole a chance to instantly take advantage of the fox  as soon as caught, when he will be caught up to the staple (which  should be high enough from the ground so the fox will swing clear)  and choked.    I set my snares in paths where weeds or grass grow each side to hide  the snare. The loop should be seven inches in diameter, ten inches  from the ground. It is as well before trapping to get the fox to  traveling a path by leaving some good scent along the path. This can  be done by boring a three-fourths hole downward in a tree near the  path and pour the scent in, which will last a long time. If the same  care is used in setting snares as is used in trapping, I think the  snare will catch more. They work well in cold weather, and some fine  catches can be made after a snowfall with the snare. Then the fur  will be good and prime.      [Illustration: WIRE OR TWINE SNARE.]    A--Spring pole.    B--Staple.    C--Two small nails driven in tree. (Three inch nail head, end down,  with snare looped at each end with a foot of slack between. As soon  as the D--three inch nail is pulled down, it will slip past the nail  at top end, when spring pole will instantly take up the slack, also  the fox, to staple and does its work.)    E--Slack line or wire.    F--Loop should be 7 inches in diameter and bottom of loop ten inches  from the ground.    Remarks--The nails should be driven above staple so it will pull  straight down to release the snare fastening.      * * *    I may state that I learned all the best ways of setting traps for fox  long ago from an old trapper, says A. H. Sutherland, of Nova Scotia.  But I never bothered setting a trap for a fox in my life, for the  reason that I can catch them with snares on bare ground much easier  and cheaper than with traps. But on snow if I could get fox to take  bait, I would try poison on him. I may add that the snare is good for  other animals besides the fox, such as coon, skunk and wild cat.    Go to a hardware store and get some rabbit wire and put about five  strands of it together, and twist it just enough so that it will stay  together nicely. Have a small loop on both ends and run one end  through the other so as to make a noose of it. Next get some good  twine, put a piece about 10 or 12 inches in length into the loop on  the end of the snare, that is, the end that is going to be fastened.    Now find a path in an old clearing or in the woods, and select a  place where you think best to set your snare. Cut a stake about 2  feet long and 1 1/2 inches through, have a limb on the butt end of it  almost 3/4 inch in length. Sharpen the small end of the stake and  drive it in the ground, leaving about 10 or 12 inches above ground;  then cut a nice little pole about an inch and a half at the butt end  and sharpen it, trim off at about an inch at the top end and fasten  your snare, or at least take your pole in both hands and force the  butt end into the ground till it will be good and firm.    Now bend down your pole and fasten your snare to it, and put the end  of the pole under the catch on the stake. Be sure to drive your stake  close enough to the path so as to have your snare light about the  center of the path and the lower side of the snare about 8 inches  from the ground. It is best to have them high enough so the fox  cannot jump over them. Of course a man must use good judgment at  setting snares just the same as he would in setting traps.    Another good place is a brush fence. Find holes under it where the  fox will be going through, put your snare there, and if there are any  going you will have some of them. Next find a good stream in the  woods or anywhere frequented by foxes, and if you find good trees  that fall across the stream have a good sharp axe and give a good  slash or two of the axe about the middle of the tree, or at least  above the middle of the brook. As I was going to say, give a good  slash or two of the axe lengthwise of the tree and make a wedge shape  stake and drive it into the tree, and then fasten your snare to a  spring pole. If you prefer, you could bore an auger hole in the log  and drive your pin in that way, and fasten the snare to the pin about  10 or 12 inches from the log so that the snare will hang downwards,  it will do better. Be sure and have the lower side of snare 7 or 8  inches from the log.      [Illustration: THE WIRE LOOP.]    Now there is another kind of brass or copper wire that one strand  will be enough to hold a fox. If you find that they are cutting your  snares put little rollers of wood in the snare boring a hole  lengthwise with a 3/8 bit, and have the roller almost 5 inches long  and say an inch in diameter. Put that on snare so it will run down to  the side of his neck, and he will keep biting at it.    I get No. 14 brass wire (mind, you must temper the wire) that I find  the hardest part of the game. Cut your wire about 34 or 36 inches  long, make it into rings round, put in a good hot fire for three or  four minutes, or until red. Be very careful and not let it lie on  coal, handle very carefully; don't strike against anything while hot,  as it will break like glass, but if you have it tempered you cannot  break it. I have caught three foxes in the same snare, says Larry  Burns, of Canada.    You must make your snare just the same as a rabbit snare, only make a  loop about six inches around. Find when the fox passes under a fence  or on a cow path, in winter, find where they make a habit of going.  Set your snare in such places or around old carrion in bushes, cedar  is best, use weeds rolled round your snare, don't use too many as  they will notice. Use a green stick to hold your snare fast, You wire  about a foot from large end. Always stand up the stick just the same  as growing. The stick should be 1 1/2 inches thick. Be careful and  make as few foot marks as possible and stand on one side of your  snare. While setting don't spit tobacco juice near snare.      * * *    A great many foxes have been caught in this country by the plan of  the drawing outlined, writes J. C. Hunter, of Canada. A--the snare,  should be made of rabbit wire, four or five strands twisted together.  Should be long enough to make a loop about seven inches in diameter  when set.

The mink did not seem trap shy although he had lost a  foot in a previous experience.    There are any number of mink here, but the catch is rather small  compared to the catch of other furs. I very often ask the trappers,  \"why don't you go after mink, they will pay you best?\" The answer is  invariably, \"I can't catch them, I don't know how.\" \"Why don't you  set your traps in their runs, or at the mouth of the dens?\" Acting on  this advice he sails out, finds a den, leaves all his traps and other  plunder at it, and hikes out home for a spade and old Towser. They  both put in half a day, then give it up. Mr. Mink is not at home.  Can't trap them no how. Sometimes he accidentally gets one. Then he  goes after them right, tears and digs up every den he can find until  his enthusiasm plays out. By this time he has spoiled all, or a good  portion of his trapping ground, when if he had placed a trap at the  mouth of each den, and done it in a proper manner, he might have  caught twenty or twenty-five mink during the season.    Now and then you find a fellow who has a good mink dog and catches  $75 or $100 worth of them in a season. While this is all right for  the fellow that owns a dog, it does not fill my ideas of getting mink  pelts, as tearing and digging out their dens has a tendency to cause  them to hunt homes elsewhere. I have caught four nice mink at the  mouth of one den in a single season, and very likely I shall catch  some there this season. I do not cover the trap, nor do I use scent  or bait. I place the trap in a depression about four or six inches  from the mouth of the den; don't cock the trap up so that he can see  it twenty feet before he reaches it; arrange matters so he will have  to get over the trap to get in the den. When he comes next time you  will likely get him.      [Illustration: A YOUNG TRAPPER.]    Mink here use the prairies around ponds and small streams that drain  the prairies. Around rice farms is a splendid place for them. They  den in rank grass and sand knolls, and travel at night, in all kinds  of weather, and very often you see them of foggy mornings. They feed  on frogs, small fish, crawfish, birds, rabbits and the like, and very  often they visit the poultry yards. My advice to the Southern mink  trapper is, find where mink use, follow out their trails and runs. By  noticing these closely you will find the places where he is compelled  to put his feet or quit the trail. Here is the place to set your  trap. Take a No. 1 of any good make, set it and adjust it properly  and slip it in the trail through the grass, and be sure that the top  of the jaws and spring are level with the ground. Do this in order  that he can't see the trap until he is at, or in it.    In catching mink on the branches I very often use baits. When you  find a log crossing the stream, cut a notch for your trap, and smear  it with mud so it won't look fresh. It is the same with logs laying  up and down streams. On these sets I use bait and a slight covering  of fine trashy leaves. Put the bait under the trap, stake the chain  to the side of the log, then place on the slight covering.    In most sets in water I make them blind, but should surroundings  require, I bait. While I use a very small amount, I am not averse to  using bait where I consider it required, and can say the same of  covering for traps. As for scent, have never used any, but am of the  opinion it would be of great help at certain seasons.    Mink is about all there is to trap in this part of North Carolina,  and I have studied out a good many things about trapping them. I live  where the country is hilly and has a good many branches and creeks,  yet it is so thickly settled that mink are scarce. Up to within a  year ago there was scarcely any trapping done about here.    Everybody seems to have a spite against the little mink, and whenever  the dogs start one everybody lays aside everything to help kill the  pesky varmint, and whoever kills it demands a chicken pie, whether he  gets it or not. And for just such reasons as this they are very  scarce, and it is very seldom that I can find the track of a real  large one. I think they must get out of this neighborhood as soon as  they are grown.    I have to conceal my traps very cautiously to catch these small and  medium mink. When I am looking for a place to set my trap I select a  narrow sand bar where they wade down into the water. I then dig out a  place for the trap so it will set level and under water about a  quarter of an inch; I then take some large water soaked leaves and  cover trap, then cover leaves with fine dirt or sand like that around  trap. If the water is perfectly still, and nothing to bother  covering, I prefer a piece of wet paper, a little larger than trap,  instead of leaves.    I will say to those trappers who never use anything but leaves to  cover their traps, that they could not get many mink around here that  way, for I have tried it, and they would either go around trap or  jump over it. Always carry some kind of firearms; it will more than  pay for its trouble. Then too, it leads others to believe you are  hunting and they won't be so apt to see you setting traps, and if you  let as few as possible see you set traps you won't have to accuse  \"Sneakum\" so often. It doesn't matter what you are trapping, cover  your traps the best you can, and then it won't be a fine job; don't  leave any loose dirt, tracks or anything else around trap that looks  odd or unnatural; when you get your pelt, don't tear it off any old  way, take your time and you will get big pay for it.    In the following words I not only express my sentiments but the views  of all trappers I have conversed with on the subject, writes a Texas  trapper. Our mink are not at all educated. They are easily caught in  traps not even concealed. The mink, as we all know, is fond of having  food at all times, and when hungry does not appear to consider the  trap an impediment.    Many are caught in Stop Thief Traps in this community. I was the  first to introduce that trap in this section, and it has met with  favor because it deprives the mink of the privilege of gnawing off  his foot or leg. They are trapped both in water and on land.    I have always had better success trapping mink than other animals,  often catching them by their tails, which, by the way, is the best  kind to hold. If the mink here were trap-shy it would be better for  them, for there are very few of them that have not met the trapper's  fate.      [Illustration: LARGE SOUTHERN MINK.]    A Southern trapper writes as follows: When I was about fourteen years  old I got hold of a price list of raw furs and a kind of trapping  fever got hold of me and I purchased a trapper's guide, and when I  had studied it my father and I set to work to make some traps. When  we got them done I went down to a branch near here and set them the  best I knew how for mink. I tried him every way but never got a  smell. So I tried a year without success. Then I gave it up for  several years and thought I would have to content myself working in  the shop, as I am a mechanic by trade and not a trapper.    In later years I thought I would try it again as the mink were giving  the poultry around here trouble. So I set out again, and in the  meantime I received a price list and I noticed they advertised animal  bait for sale. I ordered a bottle of mink bait and thought I would  catch them. When I received the bait I found where an old mink or two  had a runway in a small branch. They would come up the branch every  night. I killed some birds and used some mink bait on them and hung  them over my traps. One old dog mink would come within six inches of  the bait and my traps and did not pay any attention to it. I had some  of my traps in water and some on sand bars concealed the best I knew  how, but I did not get him that way.    One evening I was at the shop and I told my father I was going down  to place my traps and see which was the smartest, the mink or me. I  had noticed he would go by my traps and climb up a little bank and  jump down over a root, so I set the trap there and covered with  leaves. I had four traps set close together, and when I went to the  sets the next morning I found him with a foot in each. He didn't dig  and gnaw everything in reach as he was too badly tied up.    I thought I would get them all now, but I never got any more till  last season. I wrote to the Oneida Community for a price list of  traps and they mailed me one, and sent an advertisement of the H-T-T.  So I subscribed at once and received the October number. In reading  the letters I saw Brother F. M. Frazier's letter headed, \"Advice to  Young Trappers.\" I was impressed with the old gentleman's tone of  writing so I wrote to him and asked him for help, and explained my  difficulties to him. He gave me some fine sets and told me things I  never thought of or heard of before, although I have since learned  that they had been published in the H-T-T.    I purchased about thirty-nine second hand traps Nos. 1 and 1 1/2.  December 30th found me setting traps for mink. I carried out Brother  Frazier's plans and directions. I made thirteen blind sets, and on  Monday morning went around to see if anything was doing. The first  trap I came to was sprung and had a mink's toe in it. I felt pretty  bad, but that was more than I had gotten in a good while. So I went  to another trap, and before I got there I saw everything gnawed up,  and on going closer up jumped an old mink on a log near the trap. His  eyes sparked but I soon put an end to him, and I have been catching  mink ever since.    On February 1st I moved some of my traps down a river near here. I  made most of my sets in water and used rabbit for bait. I made  enclosures and put bait in back end of same "]]]
