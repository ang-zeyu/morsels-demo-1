During these  conflicts, Mr. Webster often encountered as an antagonist the  celebrated William Cobbett, at that time conducting a journal in  Philadelphia, distinguished alike for ability and for unscrupulous  violence.    While Mr. Webster lived in New-York, the yellow fever prevailed in  this city and in Philadelphia, and he wrote a minute and comprehensive  _History of Pestilential Diseases_, in two volumes, which was  published in New-York and in London. It attracted much attention in  its time, and was referred to with interest during the subsequent  prevalence of the cholera. He also published in 1802 an able treatise  on _The Rights of Neutral Nations in time of War_, occasioned by the  interference of the French government with the shipping of the world,  and its seizure of American vessels, under the proclamation of a  blockade. He also published _Historical Notices of the Origin and  State of Banking Institutions and Insurance Offices_, a work of  authority and popularity.    In 1798 he removed to New Haven, but retained the direction of his  paper at New-York for several years. After disposing of his interest  in it he devoted the remainder of his life to literary pursuits.    His first work was a _Philosophical and Practical English Grammar_,  printed in 1807. It was in many respects original, acute, and  excellently fitted for the purposes of instruction. It was, however,  only one of the studies for his subsequent and far more important  performance. For more than twenty years he had been a close student of  the elements and sources of the English language; he had gradually, as  his various occupations permitted, accumulated and arranged materials  for its exposition, and he now felt himself at liberty to forego all  other pursuits and ambitions to devote himself for the remainder of  his life to the great labors which have made his name so honorably  eminent in the history of the intellectual advances of his country and  of the Saxon family. The preparation of a Dictionary, under any  circumstances, must be regarded as a very formidable task, involving  even for an enthusiast the most dry and wearying researches,  unenlivened by any of the pleasing excitements which vary the monotony  and relieve the tedium of ordinary literary pursuits. Mr. Webster from  the beginning had a just conception of the duties and difficulties  before him; he was assured that no superficial study or careless  execution would command or in any degree deserve approval, in one who  followed in the track of Johnson. He was not disposed to make the work  of that great man a basis for his own; to be simply an editor, whose  duties should be fulfilled by additions of the new words and new  definitions introduced in seventy years; he determined to make a new  and altogether original work; to study the English language in the  writings of its most distinguished authors, to inquire into its actual  usage in conversation and public discourse, not by loosely gathered  and ill arranged groups of synonymes, but by a clear and precise  statement of meanings, illustrated, whenever it should be necessary,  by various instances. In this work, Johnson had made a beginning; he  first conceived the plan of defining by descriptions, instead of  synonymes; and he had introduced into his larger dictionary quotations  from the best authors. But his work, valuable as it was, was  imperfect, even in regard to the words current in his time, and which  he succeeded in collecting. But, if Johnson had perfectly accomplished  his design, the lapse of seventy years of such extraordinary and  various activity in every department of human action and aspiration,  would have rendered a New Dictionary indispensable. New sciences and  arts had been discovered, which, in their manifold applications to  industry, had changed or wonderfully augmented the technology and  common speech of every class and description of workers. New  experiments had been made in governments; new institutions had been  introduced; literature had assumed new forms; and speculation, with  perfect freedom and gigantic force, had forged new weapons for its new  endeavors. The necessity for a new Dictionary of the English language,  indeed is, demonstrated in the simple fact that the first edition of  Webster's great work contained twelve thousand words not in Johnson;  the second, thirty thousand. This statement does not, however, give a  just impression of the difference between Johnson and Webster, or of  the actual labor which Webster performed. The new definitions, many of  which were fruits, not more of patient research than of nice  discrimination, the arrangement of these definitions, so as to exhibit  the history of words as it had been slowly developed, cost the author  an amount of toil which can with difficulty be measured. We hazard  little concerning the importance or difficulties of the work, when we  quote the remark of Coleridge, that the history of a word is often  more important than that of a campaign.    The etymology of the language, was a subject to which he devoted much  attention, and in which he made great advances. To qualify himself for  tracing the derivations of English words, he studied some twenty  languages, and wrote out a synopsis of the leading words of each, and  incorporated the chief results of this extraordinary investigation in  the very full and instructive statement of words of similar imports,  which in the larger Dictionary is prefixed to English words, and which  he prepared for the press also, as a separate work, of about half the  size of the _American Dictionary_, entitled \"_A Synopsis of Words in  Twenty Languages_,\" which is still unpublished.    In 1812, he removed to Amherst, in Massachusetts, where he devoted ten  years entirely to these labors. He returned to New Haven in 1822; in  the following year he received from Yale College the degree of LL. D.,  and in the spring of 1824 he proceeded to Paris to consult in the  _Bibliotheque du Roi_ some works not accessible in this country, and  then went to England and passed eight months in the libraries of the  University of Cambridge.    Returning to America, he made arrangements for the publication of his  great work, and it finally appeared, near the end of 1826, in an  edition of twenty-five hundred copies, in two quarto volumes, which  were sold at twenty dollars per copy. An edition of three thousand  copies was soon after printed in England.    Dr. Webster was now seventy years of age, and he considered his  life-task accomplished; but habits of literary occupation had become  fixed and necessary, and after a few months he began to rewrite his  _History of the United States for Schools_. In 1840 he published a  second edition of the _Dictionary_, in two octavo volumes; in 1843, _A  Collection of Papers, on Political, Literary and Moral Subjects_,  selected from his various writings in early life; and in 1847 another  edition of the _American Dictionary_ appeared, after a thorough  revision of it by Professor Goodrich, of Yale College. In this edition  very large additions were made, amounting to a fifth of the whole  work. There were new words, and new definitions, when needed; careful  attention was bestowed on technical terms of science and art; and it  was made a general cyclopaedia of knowledge. Yet by employing a finer  type, and adopting a close yet clear style of printing, the original  work, with all these copious additions, was brought within the compass  of a single quarto, which has been styled the finest specimen of  book-manufacture ever produced in America. A revised edition of the  abridgement was issued at the same time, and both volumes have had a  circulation which evinces the general appreciation of their value.  Several of the New England states, we believe, have furnished a copy  of the quarto Dictionary to every school district within their limits,  and the legislature of New-York, during its recent session, passed a  law for the distribution of some thousands of copies in the school  districts of this state also. Whatever may be said of the Dictionary  by Dr. WEBSTER, it will not be questioned by the disinterested scholar  that it is one of the most extraordinary and honorable monuments of  well-directed intellectual labor of which we have any account in the  histories of literature or learning. It is as great an advance from  the work of Dr. Johnson, as that was from the wretched vocabularies of  the English language which existed before his time; and so accurate  and exhausting has been the investigation which it displays that no  rival work is likely to take its place until sufficient time has  elapsed for the language itself to pass into a new condition.    [Illustration: THE BIRTHPLACE OF NOAH WEBSTER.]    Much has been said of Dr. Webster's innovations, but for the most  part, by persons altogether ignorant of the philosophy of languages in  general, as well as of the character and condition of the English  language. Dr. Webster attempted, and with eminent success, to reduce  the English language to order, and to subject it to the operation of  principles. The changes which he made, though in a few instances,  necessary for consistency, striking, are much less numerous than is  commonly supposed, and even to scholars, with whom the study of  languages is not a _specialite_, they would not be very apparent but  for the frequent attempts which are made to prejudice the public  against the work. An amusing illustration of this fact occurred a few  years ago, when, a concerted assault upon the Dictionary having been  made, and sustained for some time, a distinguished author who had a  new book in the press of the Harpers, was alarmed by intelligence that  they intended to adopt for it Webster's orthography.

No one who has not had the most ample opportunities of personal  observation should attempt to mould Indian life and mythology to the  purposes of fiction without carefully studying whatever Mr.  Schoolcraft has published respecting them. The chief distinction of  the Algic style with which he has made us acquainted is its wonderful  simplicity and conciseness, with which the common verbosity, redundant  description, false sentiment, and erroneous manners of what are called  Indian tales, are as little in keeping as \"English figures in  moccasins, and holding bows and arrows.\"    The excellent portrait at the beginning of this article is from a  daguerreotype by Simons, of Philadelphia.

THE MARGRAVINE OF ANSPACH.      The death, in London, a few weeks ago, of a daughter of the celebrated  Lady Craven, afterwards Margravine of Anspach, has recalled attention  to the history of that remarkable and celebrated person, whose life  has the interest of a romance.    ELIZABETH BERKELEY, Margravine of Anspach, was born in December, 1750.  She was the daughter of Augustus, fourth Earl of Berkeley, by his wife  Elizabeth, daughter of Henry Drax of Charborough. She was brought up  under the care of a native of Switzerland, the wife of a German tutor  of her uncle. She describes herself as having been a delicate,  diminutive child, addicted at an early age to reading, and of timid  and retired habits. She first beheld a play when she was twelve years  old, and from that occasion she dates the growth of her subsequent  partiality for theatrical entertainments. At the age of thirteen she  paid a short visit to France with her mother and her elder sister, and  at fourteen she had been, as she says she afterwards discovered, \"in  love without knowing it\" with the Marquis de Fitz James. On the 10th  May, 1767, she was married to William Craven, nephew and heir of the  fifth Lord Craven, whom he succeeded in 1769. She professes to have  felt indifference when receiving his addresses, but the marriage was  for some time a happy one, and she says, \"My husband seemed to have no  other delight than in procuring for me all the luxuries and enjoyments  within his power, and it was an eternal dispute (how amiable a  dispute!) between us; _he_ always offering presents, and _I_ refusing  whenever I could.\" Gifted with genius and beauty, both of which she  knew well how to apply; a woman of Lady Craven's rank naturally drew  around her a large circle of admirers. She says of herself very  characteristically, \"In London the Duke and Duchess of Marlborough  showed their partiality to me, and Mr. Walpole, afterwards Lord  Orford, Dr. Johnson, Garrick, and his friend Colman, were among my  numerous admirers; and Sir Joshua Reynolds did not conceal his high  opinion of me. Charles Fox almost quarrelled with me because I was  unwilling to interfere with politics--a thing which I always said I  detested, and considered as being out of the province of a woman.\"    It appears to have been in the year 1779 that Lady Craven discovered  the infidelities with which she charged her husband, when she  requested of him the favor \"that he would not permit his mistress to  call herself Lady Craven.\" After an interval of about three years  spent in partial reconciliation, a separation took place. The  indifferent tone in which she treats the whole of this transaction,  and her professed readiness to overlook every slight that was not  public and glaring, are a stain on her character, which she has by her  own animated pen exhibited to an age which had forgotten the  accusations to which she was subjected. At the time of her separation  from her husband she was the mother of seven children.    Lady Craven had in the mean time produced her first play, \"The  Sleepwalker,\" a translation from the French, printed in 1778, at her  friend Walpole's press at Strawberry Hill. In 1779 she published  \"Modern Anecdotes of the Family of Kinvervankotsprakengatchdern, a  Tale for Christmas.\" This was a caricature of the ceremonious  pomposity of the petty German courts; it was dramatized by Mr. M. P.  Andrews. Soon after the separation, she passed some time in France,  where she met with the Margrave of Anspach. They formed a sudden  friendship for each other, and agreed to consider each other (we are  told) as brother and sister. In June, 1785, Lady Craven commenced a  tour, in which, starting from Paris, she passed by the Rhine to Italy,  went thence by the Tyrol to Vienna, passed on to Warsaw, Petersburg,  and Moscow, proceeded by the Don to Turkey, and returned by Vienna,  which she reached in August, 1786. On this occasion she ran, by her  own account, a serious risk of being made Empress of Austria. In 1789  she published an account of her tour (1 vol. 4to), in letters  addressed to the margrave, saying in the dedication, \"Beside  curiosity, my friends will in these letters see, at least for some  time, where the real Lady Craven has been, and where she is to be  found--it having been the practice for some years past for a  Birmingham coin of myself to pass in most of the inns in France,  Switzerland, and England, for the wife of my husband. My arms and  coronet sometimes supporting in some measure this insolent deception;  by which, probably, I may have been seen to behave very improperly.\"  This work is interesting from the many sketches it contains of eminent  people--such as the Empress Catharine, the Princess Dashcoff, Prince  Potemkin, Count Romanzoff, Admiral Mordvinoff, the Duc de Choiseul,  and others. It is full of accurate observation and lively description,  expressed in clear and simple English--a style from which in later  life she considerably diverged. She descended into the grotto of  Antiparos, being the first female to undertake the adventure. The  French biographers maintain that the tameness of her description of  the scene shows a deficiency of appreciation of the wonderful and  sublime. She does not indeed ornament her description with hyperboles  and exclamations, but it is clear and expressive, and by the  distinctness of the impression which it conveys to the reader, shows  that the scene was fully noticed and comprehended by the writer. After  her return from her journey, she visited England to see her children,  and then proceeded to France, where she joined the margrave and  accompanied him to Anspach. Here, during a residence of a few years,  she established a theatre, which was chiefly supplied with dramatic  entertainments of her own composition. They were collected into two  volumes 8vo, under the title of \"Nouveau Theatre d'Anspach et de  Triesdorf,\" the latter being the name of a country seat nine miles  from Anspach, where she laid out a park and garden in the English  manner. She established at the same time \"a society for the  encouragement of arts and sciences.\" She soon afterwards visited, in  company with the margrave, the congenial court of Naples, where she  made the acquaintance of Sir William and Lady Hamilton. Her conduct  was the subject of much censure both in England and among the  officials of the court of Anspach, to whom her interference was a  natural subject of distrust; and if it should even be admitted that  her own account of the purity of her motives and conduct is correct,  it cannot be denied that she afforded material for forming the worst  interpretations of them. She maintains that she always opposed the  cession of his dominions to the crown of Prussia by the margrave in  1791, but she was almost his sole adviser on the occasion. She states  that she received the first hint of his design at Naples. One day  while she was dressing for dinner, a servant intimated that the  margrave desired to see her. On her appearance he said, \"I must go to  Berlin _incog._--will you go with me? it is the only sacrifice of your  time I will ever require of you.\" They set out together, and on the  way through Anspach they found the establishment nearly in open revolt  against her influence. The king, however, was kind and generous in the  extreme, and the contracting parties are represented as only striving  to excel each other in generosity. Meanwhile the margrave's first wife  died, and Lord Craven's death occurred six months afterwards, on the  26th September, 1791. Immediately on hearing of this event, Lady  Craven was married to the margrave. \"It was six weeks,\" she says,  \"after Lord Craven's decease that I gave my hand to the margrave,  which I should have done six hours after, had I known it at the time.\"  As the cession of the margraviate to Prussia dates 2d December, 1791,  the marriage must have taken place about three weeks before it. The  nuptials were solemnized at Lisbon, whence the new married pair passed  through Spain and France to England.    The margrave, on the sale of his principality, resolved to spend his  days with his wife in England. They had no sooner arrived, however,  than the storm of family and public indignation which had been brewing  against the margravine burst upon her head. She received a letter from  her three daughters, saying, \"with due deference to the Margravine of  Anspach, the Miss Cravens inform her that, out of respect to their  father, they cannot wait upon her,\" and her eldest son, Lord Craven,  refused to countenance her. The margrave received a message from the  queen, through the Prussian minister, to the effect that his wife,  though she had received a diploma from the emperor, could not be  received at court as a princess of the empire. She says that she  refused to derogate from her dignity by appearing merely as a peeress  of England; but it is not clear that she would have been received in  that"]]]
