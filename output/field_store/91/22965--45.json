He selected his best squabs to  keep for the purpose of increasing his flock and sold the others in his  nearest market.    At the end of a year he had saved another fifty pairs for breeding and  found he had sold squabs enough to pay for a new house and all of the  feed he had bought during this time.    Then he concluded to begin advertising squabs for sale as breeders. He  received quite a number of orders, but the demand for squabs for the  market became so strong that he gave up the breeding part of the  business and began to sell in the market only. At last so many were sold  in the town that a prominent provision firm came to him and made him a  flat offer of $4.00 a dozen for all the squabs he would raise. He  refused this offer, as he was getting more than this for a good many of  his squabs and did not think he could afford to make a binding contract  on a market where the price was increasing all the time. This same  breeder now has a thousand pairs of breeding pigeons and hires a man to  take care of them, while he attends to his own business, and makes about  $1,000.00 clear money from his pigeons every year.    Another way to build up a private trade is to introduce nicely dressed  squabs among the wealthiest families of a town. This can be done by  presenting them with two or three pairs, nicely put up in a box, and  asking them to try them. One breeder who started out in this way now  sells all his squabs at $1.00 a pair. He dresses them neatly, puts a  pair in a nice white box with a colored bit of \"baby ribbon.\" He has a  demand for all he can get at $1 a pair, although he lives near a large  city where the price is often lower than this.    The enterprising squab breeder will be able to find a market for the  product of his loft, no matter where he lives. The express companies  carry squabs at the regular dressed-poultry rates, and in many places  there are fast freight lines which take butter and eggs to distant  markets in the shortest possible time.    The Parcel Post now brings a large field of customers right to your  door, for dressed squabs may be sent many miles for a few cents and the  package will be promptly delivered in good order to your customer. This  new branch of the Postal service opens up greater possibilities for the  squab producer and the live breeder who first takes advantage of this  service will reap the rewards.    Squabs properly packed may be sent 1,000 miles to market and yet be  profitable, but there is hardly a place in this country where a good  market can not be found within 200 or 300 miles, and even a thousand  miles is not a long distance for an express train.    The trouble will not be so much where to find a market as how to produce  squabs enough, once the breeder has been in the business long enough to  make a name for himself.    If any breeder sends squabs of good size and color and keeps up the  quality regularly, it will not be long before there will be a call for  his particular brand of squabs, and after that it will be a question of  meeting the demand, for this will grow all the time.      DRESSING AND PACKING SQUABS    Squabs are usually ready to send to the market when four weeks old. Some  well-fed ones, or those bred from the best parents, will come to market  condition a few days earlier and some a few days later. As a rule, it  will be about four weeks from the time they are hatched until they are  ready to send to market.    They should be dressed just about the time they are ready to leave the  nest, for they are heavier and fatter at that time than they ever will  be again.    They should be dressed at the time all the pin feathers are out. They  then have a solid feeling about the abdomen and the breast is plump and  full. It is very easy to learn the exact time that squabs should be sent  to market, and anyone can learn it at once.    Go over the nests in the evening and select the squabs which are to be  dressed the next day. These should be put in a coop by themselves, where  they can not get anything to eat, so their crops will be empty when they  are dressed. If they are sent to market with full crops, the contents of  the crop will sour and ferment and spoil the squabs for food purposes in  a short time. When dressed with the crops empty and properly iced in  warm weather, they will remain fresh until they can be sold in the  market.    A \"killing rack\" should be made before dressing begins. This consists of  a frame not quite shoulder high, a 2x4 scantling making a good  cross-piece for the top. In the side of this cross-piece drive ten-penny  nails about six inches apart, leaving half the length of the nail  protruding.      [Illustration: Fig. 11. Showing the Arrangement of a Small Plant on a    Back Lot.]    Make a loop of stout cord, looping it over both feet of the squab, and  by this string hang it on one of the nails. Then cross the wings over  the back in such a way that they are locked. This prevents fluttering  and is painless. To lock the wings, turn the pigeon with the back to you  and cross the hands. Then take a wing in each hand and pass one under  the other in such a position that the \"elbows\" lock together.    With the small blade of a pen-knife in the right hand take the head of  the squab in the left hand in such a way that the thumb and forefinger  may be used to hold the mouth open. If held in the right way, the  shoulders of the birds will be in the palm of the hand.    Run the blade of the knife up through the top of the mouth into the  brain and immediately pass to another squab, letting the one just killed  bleed, as it is necessary for the bird to be free from blood to prevent  red spots from appearing along its back after it has been killed a few  hours. These red spots are called \"blisters\" and injure the selling  qualities of a squab which shows them.    After the birds are thoroughly bled, carefully pick the feathers from  them, being careful not to tear the skin in any place, as this also  lowers the value in the market.    The English method of killing is rapidly gaining in favor in this  country and is superior in many ways to the use of the knife. By this  method the operator grasps the bird firmly in the left hand with the  thumb and fingers about the neck and the breast and wing, butts held  securely in the hand. The bird's head is caught in the right hand with  the thumb over and at the back of the head and the first and second  fingers at the throat. Then with a firm pull, the neck is dislocated and  the jugular vein is ruptured so the bird is killed instantly and  thoroughly bled, all of the blood however remaining inside the skin of  the neck.    A little practice will enable anyone to learn this method and it is much  faster, neater and cleaner than the old method.    When a squab is plucked clean, throw it into a tub of water from a  spring or well from thirty minutes to an hour. Then it should be thrown  into a tub of ice-cold water to further cool and solidify the flesh, for  all the animal heat must be chilled out before a squab is packed or it  will not keep well, arriving in the market soft and unattractive in  appearance.    Be very careful to have the second chilling water almost cold enough to  freeze the birds. In cold weather they soon cool out in water which has  been exposed to the air, but at any time in the year first cool them in  well or spring water of normal temperature.    After the squabs are picked and cooled, pack them in ice in barrels or  boxes. We prefer rather small boxes, say about the size of soap-boxes,  but many thousand pairs are sent to market in clean barrels. Empty apple  barrels or cracker barrels may be used.    In the bottom of the packet put a good layer of cracked ice. A good many  times the ice is not cracked as small as it should be. It should be  broken into pieces about the size of a hickory nut, so the pieces will  work down through the space between the birds. After the bottom is  covered with ice, put in a layer of squabs, pack down and so the  carcasses are closely packed but not squeezed together. Over these put  another layer of ice and again a layer of birds until within two or  three inches of the top. Fill the remaining space with cracked ice and  fasten the package.    Be liberal about using ice, for it is necessary that the birds should be  kept cool and the express companies make allowance for the weight of the  ice in weighing squabs packed this way.    If any grain has been found in the crop of a squab as it is being  dressed, it should be removed. Cut a very small slit in the breast over  the crop and wash out the grain. A small hose with light pressure from a  tank or water system is very handy for this purpose.    Before packing the birds, carefully wash all the blood from them and  wash the feet and legs until they are bright and red.    If there is a shade of difference in the quality of squabs, select the  best for the top of the package and take pains that the top layer is  very carefully laid in so that it will look nice when the package is  opened.    If there happens to be a number of dark-fleshed or rather light-weight  squabs in a killing, these should be packed by themselves and sent on in  anticipation of receiving a low price for them. Nothing is gained by  putting some poor squabs among a number of good ones, for they will  reduce the price of the whole package. If fine ones are put by  themselves and marked \"Firsts\" and the poorer ones sent without any  particular mark the prices obtained for the whole shipment will be  larger than it would have been if good and poor had been packed  together.    It is best to kill on a certain day in the week, the day depending on  the distance to market. In South Jersey they kill on Monday or Tuesday  and send the squabs to New York and usually get a check for them by  Saturday.

Regard them where we  will, they are ever the same. In the larger or the smaller towns, in the  streets or in the country, every one goes his own way without troubling  himself about others, and without saluting those with whom he is  unacquainted. Never do we see neighbors associating with each other; and  neighborly friendship is here unknown. If acquaintances meet, they nod to  each other, or the one murmurs, '_How do you do?_' while the other  replies, '_Very well_,' without delaying an instant, unless business  affairs require a conversation. This concluded, they depart without a word,  unless, indeed, as an exception, they wish each other good morning, or  evening. Nor are they less distant in hotels, or during journeys in  railroad cars and steamboats.\"--\"Continued conversations, in which several  take part, are extremely rare. Any one speaking frequently to a stranger,  at table or during a journey, runs the risk not merely of being regarded as  impertinent, but as entertaining dishonest views; and, indeed, one should  invariably be on his guard against Americans who manifest much  friendliness, since, in this manner, pickpockets are accustomed to make  their advances.    \"In a corresponding degree this coldness of disposition is manifested  towards more intimate acquaintances. Never do we observe among friends a  deep and heart-inspired, or even a confiding relationship. Nay, this is not  even to be found among members of the same family. The son or the daughter,  who has not for several days seen his or her parents, returns and enters  the room without a greeting, or without any signs of joy being manifested  by either. Or else the salutation is given and returned in such a manner  that scarcely a glance passes between the parties. The direst calamities  are imparted and listened to with an apathy evincing no signs of emotion,  and a great disaster, occurring on a railroad or steamboat, in the United  States, excites in Germany more attention and sympathy than in the former  country, even when friends and perhaps relatives have thereby suffered.  Even the loss of a member of the family is hardly manifested by the  survivors.\"    In a recent English work we were indeed complimented for our _patience_,  but it was reserved for Doctor Kirsten to discover in us, this degree of  iron-hearted, immovable, _nil admirarism_. But when he goes on to assert  that \"in the most deadly peril--in such moments as those which precede the  anticipated explosion of a steamboat boiler, even their ladies preserve the  same repose and equanimity,\" so that any expression from a stranger is  coldly listened to, without producing evident impression, _our_ surprise is  changed to wonder, and we are tempted to inquire, Can it be possible, that  we are such Spartans--endowed with such superior human stoicism?    \"This coldness of the American is legibly impressed on his features. In  both sexes we frequently meet with pretty, and occasionally beautiful,  faces; but seldom, however, do we perceive in either, aught cheerful or  attractive. In place thereof we observe, even in the fairest, a certain  earnestness, verging towards coldness. From the great majority of faces we  should judge that no emotion could be made to express itself upon them, and  such is truly the case.    \"That the nearest acquaintances address each other with _Sir_ and _Master_,  or _Miss_ and _Mistress_, and that husband and wife, parents and children,  yes, even the children themselves employ these titles to each other, has  undoubtedly much to do with their marked and cold demeanor. But this must  have a deeper ground than that merely caused by the use of distant forms of  salutation.    \"And yet, the Americans are by no means of a bad disposition, since they  are neither crafty and treacherous, nor revengeful, nor even prone to  distrust; on the contrary, quite peaceable, and by the better classes,  there is much charity for apparent misery; seldom does one suffering with  bodily ailments leave the house of a wealthy man without being munificently  aided; the which charity is silently extended to him, without a sign of  emotion. Those who are capable of work--no matter what the cause of their  sufferings may be, seldom receive alms, for the Americans go upon the  principle that work is not disgraceful, and without reflecting that the  applicant may not have been accustomed to work, refuse in any manner to aid  him. If any man want work, he can apply to the overseers of the poor, who  are obliged to receive him in a poor-house, and maintain him until he find  such. Much is done at the state's expense for the aged, sick, and insane.\"    After this our doctor lets fall a few flattering drops of commendation by  way of admitting that this iron immobility of the American is not without  its good points, but fearing that he has spoken too favorably, he brings up  the chapter by remarking that--    \"The here-mentioned good traits in the American character can, however, by  no means overbalance or destroy the evil impression which their coldness  produces, but merely soften it.\"    From our appearance and deportment he proceeds to a bold, hasty, and  remarkably superficial criticism of education in America. The father of a  family in America, we are informed, is occupied with business from morning  to night, and leaves all care for the education and training of his  children to the mother, who is, however, generally quite incapable to  fulfil such duty. No teacher dare correct a child, for fear of incurring  legal punishment, in consequence of which they grow up destitute of  decency, order, or obedience. Some few, indeed, find their way eventually  into academies and colleges, which are not so badly managed; but, as for  school-boys, since there is no one to insure their regular attendance at  school, they play truant _a discretion_. As for the children of the lower  and middle classes, they pass their boyhood in idleness, and grow up in  ignorance, until at a later period they enter into business, when they are  compelled to perfect themselves in the arts of reading and writing, yet  they quickly acquire the business spirit of their fathers.    \"The education of the girls is, however, of an entirely different nature.  On them the mothers expend much care and trouble, which is, however, of the  most perverted kind, since it is in its nature entirely external. Before  all, do they seek to give them an air of decency and culture, which is,  nevertheless, more apparent than real. In accordance with the republican  spirit of striving after equality, every mother--no matter how poor, or how  low her rank may be--desires to bring her daughter up in such a manner that  she may be inferior in respectability and external culture to no one.\" \"In  fact, the daughters of the poorest workman bear themselves like those of  the richest merchant. In their mien we see a pride flashing forth, which  can hardly be surpassed by that of the haughtiest daughters of the highest  German nobility. And that their daughters may in every respect equal those  of others, we see poor men lavishing upon them their last penny; and while  the boys run in the streets, covered with ragged and dirty fragments of  clothing, the sisters wear bonnets with veils, bearing parasols, and while  at school, short dresses and drawers.\"    After this fearful announcement, we are informed, that the poor girls  profit as little in school as their unhappy brothers, and that no regard is  paid to their future destiny.    \"Even after the maiden has left school, her mother instructs her in no  feminine employment, not even in domestic affairs, and least of all, in  cookery. While the former lives, and the daughter remains unmarried, she  (the mother,) attends to housekeeping, as far as the word can be taken in  the German sense, while her daughter passes the time in reading, more  frequently with bedecking herself, but generally in idleness. When the  daughter, however, marries, we may well imagine how a house is managed in  such hands. The principal business henceforth is self-adornment and  housekeeping. All imaginable care is bestowed upon these branches, but none  whatever on any other. Cookery is of the lowest grade; nearly every day  sees the same dishes, and those, also, which are prepared with the least  trouble. Very frequently, indeed, the husbands are obliged to prepare their  meals before and after their business hours. Knitting and spinning, either  in town or country, is unknown; only manufactured or woven stockings are  worn, and shirts are generally purchased ready-made in the shops.\" \"Washing  is the only work which they undertake, and this is done by young ladies of  wealthy family. This takes place every Monday, for there are very few  families who own linen sufficient for more than a single week's wear.    \"So long as the father lives, his daughters stick to him, useless as they  are, and heavy as the burden may be to him. It is _his_ business to see  where the money comes from wherewith to nourish and decently clothe them:  on this account the servant girls in America generally consist of Irish,  Germans, and blacks. Even these, taking pattern from their mistresses,  refuse to perform duties which are expected from every housemaid in  Germany--for examples, boot-brushing, clothes-cleaning, and the bringing of  water across the way, as well as street and step-cleaning; for which reason  we often see respectable men performing these duties.\"    From this terrible plague of daughters, and daughterly extravagance, the  doctor finds that poorer men in America are by no means as well off as  would be imagined from their high wages. \"The father with many daughters,  so far from advancing in wealth,"]]]
