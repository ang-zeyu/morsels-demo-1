True, Wagner  found the clew when he succeeded in throwing off routine; but had he  really never possessed it, he would have declared the fact without  bitterness. And, after all, this sentence in Wagner's letter expresses  the true artist-contempt for routine, inasmuch as he waives all claim to  a qualification which he thinks meanly of, and takes care that others  may not invest him with it. This self-praise he utters with a mien of  ironic desperation. He is, in very truth, unhappy that composition is at  a standstill, but finds rich consolation in the consciousness that his  genius is above the cheap expedients of routine; at the same time, with  an air of modesty, he sorrowfully confesses that he has not acquired a  training belonging to the craft.    The sentence is a masterpiece of the native cunning of the instinct of  self-preservation; but equally proves--and that is our point--the  pettiness of routine in creative work.                               *       *       *    RESPECT the Pianoforte! Its disadvantages are evident, decided, and  unquestionable: The lack of sustained tone, and the pitiless, unyielding  adjustment of the inalterable semitonic scale.    But its advantages and prerogatives approach the marvelous.    It gives a single man command over something complete; in its  potentialities from softest to loudest in one and the same register it  excels all other instruments. The trumpet can blare, but not sigh;  contrariwise the flute; the pianoforte can do both. Its range embraces  the highest and deepest practicable tones. Respect the Pianoforte!    Let doubters consider how the pianoforte was esteemed by Bach, Mozart,  Beethoven, Liszt, who dedicated their choicest thoughts to it.    And the pianoforte has one possession wholly peculiar to itself, an  inimitable device, a photograph of the sky, a ray of moonlight--the  Pedal.    The effects of the pedal are unexhausted, because they have remained  even to this day the drudges of a narrow-souled and senseless harmonic  theory; the treatment accorded them is like trying to mould air or water  into geometric forms. Beethoven, who incontestably achieved the greatest  progress on and for the pianoforte, divined the mysteries of the pedal,  and to him we owe the first liberties.    The pedal is in ill-repute. For this, absurd irregularities must bear  the blame. Let us experiment with _sensible_ irregularities.                               *       *       *    \"I FELT ... that the book I shall write will be neither in English nor  in Latin; and this for the one reason ... namely, that the language in  which it may be given me not only to write, but also to think, will not  be Latin, or English, or Italian, or Spanish, but a language not even  one of whose words I know, a language in which dumb things speak to me,  and in which, it may be, I shall at last have to respond in my grave to  an Unknown Judge.\"                                       (Von Hofmannsthal: A letter.)

Nothing in my action showed, or could show, the meaning of  my words.    If any of your readers who have resided for some weeks or months in a  country where a language is spoken entirely foreign to their own--say,  Arabic, or Basque, or Welsh--will recall of how many words they  insensibly learn the meaning without asking it, and merely by hearing  them always used in certain relations, they will have, I think, a fair  measure of the extent and nature of a dog's knowledge of the language of  his masters. My dog has lived fewer years in the world than I have  passed in Wales, but he knows just about as much English as I know  Welsh, and has acquired it just in the same way.              F. P. C.      TEACHING DOGS A METHOD OF COMMUNICATION.              [_Dec. 29, 1883._]    Mr. Darwin's \"Notes on Instinct,\" recently published by my friend, Mr.  Romanes, have again called attention to the interesting subject of  instinct in animals.    Miss Martineau once remarked that, considering how long we have lived in  close association with animals, it is astonishing how little we know  about them, and especially about their mental condition. This applies  with especial force to our domestic animals, and, above all, of course,  to dogs. I believe that it arises very much from the fact that hitherto  we have tried to teach animals, rather than to learn from them--to  convey our ideas to them, rather than to devise any language, or code of  signals, by means of which they might communicate theirs to us. No doubt  the former process is interesting and instructive, but it does not carry  us very far.    Under these circumstances it has occurred to me whether some such system  as that followed with deaf mutes, and especially by Dr. Howe with Laura  Bridgman, might not prove very instructive if adapted to the case of  dogs. Accordingly I prepared some pieces of stout cardboard, and printed  on each in legible letters a word, such as \"food,\" \"bone,\" \"out,\" &c. I  then began training a black poodle, Van by name, kindly given me by my  friend, Mr. Nickalls.    I commenced by giving the dog food in a saucer, over which I laid the  card on which was the word \"food,\" placing also by the side an empty  saucer, covered by a plain card. Van soon learnt to distinguish between  the two, and the next stage was to teach him to bring me the card; this  he now does, and hands it to me quite prettily, and I then give him a  bone, or a little food, or take him out, according to the card brought.  He still brings sometimes a plain card, in which case I point out his  error, and he then takes it back and changes it. This, however, does not  often happen. Yesterday morning, for instance, he brought me the card  with \"food\" on it nine times in succession, selecting it from among  other plain cards, though I changed the relative position every time. No  one who sees him can doubt that he understands the act of bringing the  card with the word \"food\" on it, as a request for something to eat, and  that he distinguishes between it and a plain card. I also believe that  he distinguishes, for instance, between the card with the word \"food\" on  it and the card with \"out\" on it.    This, then, seems to open up a method which may be carried much further,  for it is obvious that the cards may be multiplied, and the dog thus  enabled to communicate freely with us. I have as yet, I know, made only  a very small beginning, and hope to carry the experiment much further,  but my object in troubling you with this letter is twofold. In the first  place, I trust that some of your readers may be able and willing to  suggest extensions or improvements of the idea. Secondly, my spare time  is small, and liable to many interruptions; and animals also, we know,  differ greatly from one another. Now, many of your readers have  favourite dogs, and I would express a hope that some of them may be  disposed to study them in the manner indicated. The observations, even  though negative, would be interesting; but I confess I hope that some  positive results might follow, which would enable us to obtain a more  correct insight into the minds of animals than we have yet acquired.              JOHN LUBBOCK.      COMMUNICATION WITH ANIMALS.              [_April 12, 1884._]    You did me the honour, some weeks ago, to insert a letter of mine,  containing suggestions as to a method of studying the psychology of  animals and a short account of a beginning I had myself made in that  direction.    This letter has elicited various replies and suggestions which you will  perhaps allow me to answer, and I may also take the opportunity of  stating the progress which my dog Van has made, although, owing greatly,  no doubt, to my frequent absences from home and the little time I can  devote to him, this has not been so rapid as I doubt not would otherwise  have been the case. Perhaps I may just repeat that the essence of my  idea was to have various words, such as \"food,\" \"bone,\" \"water,\" \"out,\"  &c., printed on pieces of card-board, and, after some preliminary  training, to give the dog anything for which he asked by bringing a  card. I use pieces of cardboard about ten inches long and three inches  high, placing a number of them on the floor side by side, so that the  dog has several cards to select from, each bearing a different word.    One correspondent has suggested that it would be better to use variously  coloured cards. This might, no doubt, render the first steps rather  more easy, but, on the other hand, any temporary advantage gained would  be at the expense of subsequent difficulty, since the pupil would very  likely begin by associating the object with the colour, rather than with  the letters. He would, therefore, as is too often the case with our own  children, have the unnecessary labour of unlearning some of his first  lessons. At the same time, the experiment would have an interest as a  test of the colour-sense in dogs.    Another suggestion has been that, instead of words, pictorial  representations should be placed on the cards. This, however, could only  be done with material objects, such as \"food,\" \"bone,\" \"water,\" &c., and  would not be applicable to such words as \"out,\" \"pet me,\" &c.; nor even  as regards the former class do I see that it would present any  substantial advantage.    Again, it has been suggested that Van is led by scent rather than by  sight. He has, no doubt, an excellent nose, but in this case he is  certainly guided by the eye. The cards are all handled by us, and must  emit very nearly the same odour. I do not, however, rely on this, but  have in use a number of cards bearing the same word. When, for instance,  he has brought a card with \"food\" on it, we do not put down the same  identical card, but another with the same word; when he has brought  that, a third is put down, and so on. For a single meal, therefore,  eight or ten cards will have been used, and it seems clear, therefore,  that in selecting them Van must be guided by the letters.    When I last wrote I had satisfied myself that he had learnt to regard  the bringing of a card as a request, and that he could distinguish a  card with the word \"food\" on it from a plain one, while I believed that  he could distinguish between a card with \"food\" on it and one with \"out\"  on it.    I have now no doubt that he can distinguish between different words. For  instance, when he is hungry he will bring a \"food\" card time after time,  until he has had enough, and then he lies down quietly for a nap. Again,  when I am going for a walk, and invite him to come, he gladly responds  by picking up the \"out\" card, and running triumphantly with it before me  to the front door. In the same way he knows the \"bone\" card quite well.  As regards water (which I spell phonetically, so as not to confuse him  unnecessarily), I keep a card always on the floor in my dressing-room,  and whenever he is thirsty he goes off there, without any suggestion  from me, and brings the card with perfect gravity. At the same time he  is fond of a game, and if he is playful or excited will occasionally run  about with any card. If through inadvertence he brings a card for  something he does not want, when the corresponding object is shown him,  he seizes the card, takes it back again, and fetches the right one. No  one who has seen him look along a row of cards, and select the right  one, can, I think, doubt that in bringing a card he feels that he is  making a request, and that he can not only perfectly distinguish between  one word and another, but also associates the word and the object.    I do not for a moment say that Van thus shows more intelligence than  has been recorded in the case of other dogs; that is not my point, but  it does seem to me that this method of instruction opens out a means by  which dogs and other animals may be enabled to communicate with us more  satisfactorily than hitherto. I am still continuing my observations, and  am now considering the best mode of testing him in very simple  arithmetic, but I wish I could induce others to co-operate, for I feel  satisfied that the system would well repay more time and attention than  I am myself able to give.              JOHN LUBBOCK.      INSTINCT OF LOCALITY IN DOGS.              [_March 4, 1893._]    A cat carried a hundred miles in a basket, a dog taken, perhaps, five  hundred miles by rail, in a few days may have found their way back to  the starting-point. So we have often been told, and, no doubt, the thing  has happened. We have been astonished at the wonderful intelligence  displayed. Magic, I should call it. Last week I heard of a captain who  sailed from Aberdeen to Arbroath. He left behind him a dog which,  according to the story, had never been in Arbroath, but when he arrived  there the dog was waiting on the quay. I was expected to believe that  the dog had known his master's destination, and been able"]]]
