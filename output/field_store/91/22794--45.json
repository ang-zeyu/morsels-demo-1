Where there is no faith there is no  respect for law pertaining to future rewards; and where this is the case  there is no sense of moral obligations connecting man with the future  retribution. So there is nothing resting upon an unbeliever's heart that  will serve as a check upon his passions, and deter him from living with  reference to the gratification of a mere animal nature. Skepticism, by  shutting God out of the mind, destroys the very idea of law. Cicero's  description of law is in these noble words: There is one true and  original law conformable to reason and to nature, diffused over all,  invariable, eternal, which calls to the fulfillment of duty and to  abstinence from injustice, and which calls with that irresistible voice  which is felt in all its authority wherever it is heard. This law can  not be abolished or curtailed, nor affected in its sanctions by any law  of man. A whole senate, a whole people, can not dispense from its  paramount obligations. It requires no commentators to render it  intelligible; nor is it different at Rome, at Athens, from what it was  ages ago, nor is it different now from what it will be in ages to come.  In all nations and in every age it has been, is, and forever will be the  same--_one_, as God, its greatest author, _is one_. Man is man, _truly_,  as he yields himself to this divine influence. Faith in God implants  this law in the individual and national heart. Infidelity excludes its  authority and influence and leaves man to the mercy of his undisciplined  appetites. The fruits of infidelity have always been selfishness. The  Christian believer regards himself as subordinated to a higher power,  and labors under a sense of obligations which begets habits of  self-control that are the life of morality. The ideal character of the  Christian religion is such that faith in God and future rewards tend to  make the earth life an image of the divine. This is the glory of both  reason and faith, that it perceives the invisible. The students of the  present have no trouble to see that the true greatness of the nation of  antiquity was in their attribute of morality. Virtue and morality in an  ancient ruler shines in history even across the dark ages, and makes  glad the heart of the student of the nineteenth century. Faith in God  has been the great leading thought in the rise of nations--that is, in  reformations. Luther and Melancthon preceded Lord Bacon, Newton and  Locke. The few stars that lit up the gloomy night that preceded the  reformation and the revival of literature were lighted by the faith of  God. Speaking of this fact, Dr. Goode says: \"We behold a flood of  noonday bursting all at once over every quarter of the horizon and  dissipating the darkness of a thousand years; we behold mankind in  almost every quarter of Europe, from the Carpathian Mountains to the  pillars of Hercules, from the Tiber to the Vistula, waking as from a  profound sleep to a life of activity and bold adventure; ignorance  falling prostrate before advancing knowledge; brutality and barbarism  giving way to science and polite letters; vice and anarchy to order and  moral conduct.    \"The modern opposers of Christianity, reasoning in a retro-grade  motion--that is, going backwards--ascribe every improvement to science  and philosophy, but it was religion that took the lead in _both_ the  great revival of learning and the reformation. Aldhelm, Bede and Alcuin  were three great Anglo-Saxon luminaries of the eighth century. Alcuin  was the tutor and confidential friend of Charlemagne. Ingulph, made  abbot of Croyland by William the Conquerer, was the bright light of the  eleventh century. To him we are indebted for much that has come down to  us. John of Salisbury, Girald the Cambrian, and the monk Adelard, and  Robert of Reading were all religious leaders. The last two traveled in  Egypt and Arabia, studied mathematics at Cordovia. Adelard translated  Euclid out of Arabic into Latin. Such also was Alfred the Great, who was  victorious in prosperity and adversity, as a legislator and philosopher,  as a soldier and politician, a king and a Christian; he was the pride of  princes, the flower of society and the delight of mankind.\" Roger Bacon,  of notoriety on account of his superior knowledge of physics, was the  bright Christian light of the thirteenth century. From this century all  the way through the reformation the revival of faith in God was the  revival of the golden age of learning or literature. When faith in God  expired in France the entire social fabric steadily declined until all  crumbled and fell as in the ruins of an earthquake. At the same time the  inhabitants, loosened from the restraints which faith in the living God  imposes, stained every part of the country with blood, and its glory and  grandeur perished. It has been well said that the rights of man can not  be well secured and enjoyed unless he is viewed in his relations to God.  Where government aims at and subserves this end it is a blessing.  Blackstone has well remarked that the whole should protect all its  parts, and that every part should pay obedience to the will of the  whole; or, in other words, that the community shall guard the rights of  each individual member, and that in return for this protection each  individual should submit to the law of the community. Faith lets God  down into the hearts of lawmakers, and a sense of accountability to him  must, most certainly, have a grand tendency to refine laws in their  first conception. At least it happens to be true that wherever God is  feared and law made the basis of the legislation and policy of a nation,  that nation is, in fact, found to excel in those interests which are  essential to a nation's well-being and glory. We challenge any man, or  set of men, to an estimate of the comparative purity and morals of the  nations of the earth. It is, and forever will be, found to correspond  with their religious systems. The great conflict which is now going on  in every civilized country is a conflict between faith and infidelity.  For the triumph of light and truth the very throne of God is pledged.  There may be difficulties to encounter, but these will be vanquished. As  well undertake to pluck the sun and stars from the heavens, and spread  the black curtain of one long protracted night over the world, as to try  to quench the light of immortal truth as it flows freely into the hearts  of so many millions and stirs up the deep fountains of human spirits.          *      *      *      *      *    \"Owing to the attitude of the churches for the last fifteen hundred  years truth-telling has not been a very lucrative business.\"--_Col.  Ingersoll._    The Colonel's business _has been very lucrative_, therefore his _has not  been a truth-telling business_.          THE THEORY OF THE ORIGINAL FREE-THINKERS.      _See how they have advanced!_ \"Free-thinking Christians,\" a name lately  adopted by a society which arose in the year 1799, and has ever since  regularly assembled in London, calling itself _a church of God_ founded  on the principles of free inquiry. Their first members separated from a  congregation of Trinitarian dissenters in Parliament Court Chapel,  Bishopgate street; they rejected the doctrine of the trinity, the  atonement, and other points of Calvinism; then the sacraments and the  immateriality of the soul; and lastly, the inspiration of the scriptures  and public worship, for they have neither singing nor praying in their  assemblies, and regard the Bible only as an authentic history.    These free-thinking Christians readily admit that, since their first  assembling as a body, their sentiments have undergone considerable  alteration on points of primary importance, but they contend that this  is the natural consequence of free inquiry; that men who had heretofore  been the slaves of error could not but advance in the attainment of  truth after adopting a system which left thought _unrestrained and  conscience free_, and they are still ready to renounce any opinion  whenever it shall appear to them untenable. In consequence, their public  meetings, which are mostly on Sunday forenoons, resemble rather a  debating society than a Christian Church. The elder opens the meeting by  stating the subject for consideration, and, at his call, several  speakers successively address the meeting. It is not unusual to hear  among them difference of opinion, and they are all prompt to controvert  the current doctrines of the Christian world, to show their dissent from  all sects and parties, and their aversion to the clergy and to Christian  ministers of all denominations.    This society was little known till the year 1808, when they advertised  their intention of publicly inquiring into the existence of a being  called _the devil_. So singular a notice could not fail of drawing a  considerable number of persons to their assembly, especially on a  Sunday morning. The landlord of the house at which they met in the old  'Change, alarmed for his personal security, obliged them to remove, and  they engaged the large room at the Paul's Head, Cateaton street. Here  the magistracy interfered, but as they had taken the precaution to  license themselves under the toleration act, nothing could be done  legally to restrain them. Since then they have set up a periodical  publication under the title of the \"Free-thinking Christian's Magazine,\"  in which they profess to disseminate Christian, moral, and philosophical  truth, and they have erected a handsome meeting-house in the crescent  behind Jewin street, Cripplegate, where this weekly assembly, consisting  of members and strangers, is said to amount to between four and five  hundred persons.    The following appears to be the latest summary of their opinions: \"The  Christian religion,\" they say, \"consists in the worship of one God,  eternal, just, and good, and in an obedience to the commands of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28678"],[0,"The Christian Foundation, Or, Scientific and Religious Journal, Volume I, No. (#7)"],[1,"ossess,'  said they, 'the churches, the lands, the castles, the tithes, the  offerings of the living and the dead; they have only to take from us the  ring and the crosier.' _The monks remained in possession._\"    \"In 1139 was another council of Lateran, by Pope Innocent II. It is said  a thousand bishops were present. Here the ecclesiastical tithes are  declared to be of _divine right_, and all laymen possessing any of them  are excommunicated.    \"In 1215 was the last general council of Lateran, by Pope Innocent III.  Four hundred and twelve bishops and eight hundred abbots were here. This  was in the time of the Crusades, and the popes have established a Latin  patriarch at Jerusalem and one at Constantinople. These patriarchs  attend this council. This council declares, among other things, that 'no  one can be saved out of the Catholic church.' The word  transubstantiation was not known until after this council. It forbade  the establishment of new religious orders; but, since that time, no less  than eighty have been instituted. It was in this council that Raimond,  Count of Toulouse, was stripped of all his lands.    \"In 1245 a council assembled at the city of Lyons. Innocent IV. brings  thither the Emperor of Constantinople, John Puleologus, and makes him  sit beside him. He deposes the Emperor Frederick as a felon, and gives  the cardinals a red but, as a sign of hostility to Frederick, and the  source of thirty years of civil war.    \"In 1274 another council is held at the city of Lyons. Five hundred  bishops are present, seventy great and a thousand lesser abbots. The  Greek emperor, Michael Paleologus, that he may have the protection of  the Pope, sends his Greek patriarch, Theophanes, to unite, in his name,  with the Latin church; but the Greek church disowns these bishops.    \"In 1311 Pope Clement V. assembled a general council in the small town  of Vienne, in Dauphiny, in which he abolishes the order of the Templars.  It is here ordained that the Begares, Beguins and Beguines shall be  burned. These were a species of heretics '_to whom was imputed all that  had formerly been imputed to the primitive Christians_.'\" So says  Voltaire. He does not, like the pitiful blaspheming infidels of to-day,  try to heap all this corruption of the dark ages upon primitive  Christianity. No! The hull of Voltaire's soul was too great for such a  deed.    \"In 1414 the great council of Constance was assembled by an emperor who  resumes his rights, viz: by Sigismund. Here Pope John XXIII., convicted  of numerous crimes, is deposed, and John Huss and Jerome of Sprague  convicted of _obstinacy and burned_.    \"In 1431 a council was held at Basle, where they in vain depose Pope  Eugene IV., who is too clever for the council. This was a stormy  council, and it is said that Eugene regretted in _his_ old age that he  ever left his monastery.    \"In 1438 a council assembled at Ferrara, transferred to Florence, where  the excommunicated pope excommunicates the council, and declares it  guilty of high treason. Here a feigned union is made with the Greek  church, crushed by the Turkish synods held sword in hand.    \"Pope Julius II. would have had his council of Lateran in 1512 pass for  an ecumenical council. In it that pope solemnly excommunicated Louis  XII., King of France, laid France under an interdict, summoned the whole  Parliament of Provence to appear before him, and excommunicated all the  philosophers because most of them had taken part with Louis XII. Yet  this council was not like that of Ephesus, called the council of  robbers.    \"In 1537 the council of Trent was first assembled at Mantua, by Paul  III., afterwards at Trent, in 1543, and terminated in Dec., 1561, under  Pius VI.\" See vol. Phil. Dic.    \"Pope Pius IX. convened a council in 1869, which in July, 1870, decreed  the _personal infallability of the Pope_ in matters of faith and morals,  to be a dogma of the church.\"    Reader, if you will digest this little piece of history, you will  doubtless discover good reasons for asserting the right of private  judgment and the liberty of conscience. _Truth stands true to her god;  men alone vascillate._          FREE-THOUGHT IN GERMANY, FRANCE AND RUSSIA, OR RUSSIAN NIHILISM.    BY FITZ CUNLIFFE OWEN. LIBRARY MAG. VOL. 3.      Rationalism and radicalism exist to a certain extent in every country of  Europe. But the Social Democrats of Germany and Austria and the  Communists of France and Spain turn with horror from Russian  revolutionists, who consider the programme of the Paris commune of 1871  condemnably weak, and Felix Pyat, Cluseret and their companions as  little better than conservatives. The Social Democrats and even the  Communists of the rest of Europe have in view aims which, no matter how  fantastic, are always of a sufficiently defined nature. They look  forward to an entirely democratic form of government, and hope for a  recognization of the social world, under which all capital and property  would be held either by the State or Commune for the equal benefit of  everybody. They are levellers, but they are not destroyers. Take the  right of property from the citizens of a government and the greatest  motive to industry and prosperity is gone.    The revolutionary party in Russia has no definite aims of either  reorganization or improvement. In its sight everything as it now exists  is rotten, and before anything new and good can be created all existing  institutions must be utterly destroyed. Religion, the state, the family,  laws, property, morality, are all equally odious, and must be rooted out  and abolished. It is because \"nothing,\" as it exists at present, finds  favor in their eyes that they have been called \"Nihilists.\" They  maintain that no one should be bound by laws or even moral obligations  of any kind, but that every body should be allowed to do exactly as he  pleases. They desire to break up the actual social organization into  mere individualism, with entire independence for each separate person.  Their object is anarchy in the very truest sense of the word. They are  only modest enough to decline the attempt to create a new order of  things in the place of what they propose to destroy. That they intend to  leave for a better and more enlightened generation. The following, from  a Nihilist paper, Narodnia Volya (The Will of the People), which is  published at St. Petersburg by means of secret presses, will set them  forth in their true inwardness:    \"The Russian press is bent almost double by the imperial government.  Notwithstanding its disagreeable position it does its utmost to curry  favor of its oppressors. Whenever thefts, murders, or incendiarisms take  place in Russia the press invariably attributes them to the Nihilists.  There is an old proverb which says, 'Slander, slander; some result will  always be obtained.' Judging from the tone of the press some result has  been obtained. According to its statements the Nihilists are little  better than wild beasts. We do not venture to assert that there are no  bad men in our ranks, but are yours entirely free from them? The number  of bad persons among the Nihilists is so very small that we need hardly  enumerate them. Since 1862 over 17,000 persons have been exiled to  Siberia for political offenses.    \"You accuse us of adopting means of action which are unjustifiable in  every way. But what can we do? We are reduced to silence. We only adopt  questionable means of action very rarely, and then only in self-defense;  whereas you use them daily.    \"The money obtained from private individuals by means of theft and  blackmail has not been levied by order of the 'committee,' but by  certain unscrupulous Nihilists acting on their own behalf. However, we  are all the more ready to admit that such things have been done when we  remember that only five such cases are known to have taken place.    \"Do not accuse us of being murderers, because of our attempts to take  the life of His Most Sacred Majesty? Why, we would most gladly  accomplish his destruction, and he has only escaped until now in  consequence of the many cowards in our ranks! It has been stated that  Solowjew's attempt in April last has disturbed the rest and peace of  mind of many harmless and respectable citizens. Some of the Liberal  papers even go so far as to say that it will have the effect of  producing a reaction in favor of the government. Why, what idle and  stupid talk! These good newspaper proprietors, who love their ease and  their books, must have been asleep not to have perceived that the  reaction began sixteen years ago, not in favor of the government, but  against it.    \"We are quite persuaded that if Solowjew's attempt had succeeded,  everybody would talk in a different manner, even the slaves and asses  who surrounded the throne would have rejoiced.    \"Do not be surprised at these political assassinations, but rather be  astonished that they are not more frequent. Unfortunately for our cause,  the Nihilists are too humanitarian, and hence are incapable of carrying  out many necessary measures. Perhaps in time they will acquire the  aptitude necessary in critical moments; perhaps it will be your conduct  which will effect this change in them. Then in that case the  responsibility of terrorism and assassination will rest with you, and  not with us.\"          *      *      *      *      *    How many amusing and ridiculous scenes should we witness if each pair of  men that secretly laugh at each other were to do it openly!

These are  foundation axioms underlying the entire system of Christian theology.  The first looks backward, and the second looks forward.
