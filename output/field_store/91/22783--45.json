Even in the old Greek  and Roman times the doctors recommended deep breathing, the voluntary  holding of air in the lungs, believing that this exercise cleansed the  system of impurities and gave strength. And all our scientific  discoverers have proven that they were right, and modern doctors have  only learned more of the process and added to the wisdom of the  ancients. Professor Lehwess says that he uses deep breathing not only  as a health remedy but as a cure for muscular convulsions, especially  chronic spasms; and he says that he bases his method for the cure of  stuttering mainly upon respiratory and vocal exercises, \"whereby,\" he  says, \"we work on enervated muscles, and make their function bring  them into permanent activity and make them obedient to our will.\" Thus  not only will the respiratory system be enlarged and quickened, and  the lungs strengthened, but the blood circulation is promoted and  those injurious influences overcome which often take away the  stutterer's courage for speaking.    Dr. Niemeyer, of Leipzig, urges breathing in these words: \"Prize air;  use good, pure air; breathe fresh air in your room by night and day.\"  Dr. Bicking says that respiratory gymnastics are the only effectual  remedy for pulmonary affection, especially for consumption. The  Marquise Ciccolina claims that by the teaching of breathing gymnastics  she has cured people of a tendency to take cold easily; she has  benefited cases of lung and heart trouble, and she has cured nervous  asthma even in cases that have lasted from childhood to maturity. Dr.  Kitchen asserts that if the various structures of the body, including  the lungs, are in a sufficiently healthy state, consumption cannot  find a soil in which to commence its ravages, or, if already  commenced, can be cured by attention to the general health, by pure  air and deep breathing.    All this proves that the breathing is of great importance--of just as  much importance to women as to men. It used to be thought that women  breathe naturally with the upper part of the chest and men with the  abdominal muscles, but we have now learned that in the breathing of  both men and women the diaphragm should be used and the lower part of  the chest expanded. The breathing should neither be thoracic--that is,  with the upper part of the chest--nor abdominal. It should be  diaphragmatic; that is, with the expansion of the sides of the lower  part of the chest, thus filling every air-cell and bringing the  life-giving oxygen to the blood. The importance of the diaphragm as  the breathing muscle cannot be overestimated. A diaphragm, you know,  is a partition across a cylinder; the diaphragm is a muscular  partition across the cylinder of the body, dividing the lungs from the  abdomen. In breathing, the diaphragm becomes tense, and in becoming  tense becomes also flattened, just as an umbrella does by being  opened. In fact the opening and shutting of an umbrella gives a very  good idea of the motion of the diaphragm in breathing. We can realize,  then, how much larger around the body will be when the lungs are fully  inflated than it is when we breathe the air out and the lungs are  empty. A few minutes spent each day in exercising in diaphragmatic  breathing would be of great advantage in increasing beauty of form, in  giving strength and power to the voice, in improving the complexion  and adding to the health, and therefore to the happiness. In taking  these exercises, one should either stand erect or lie flat upon the  back and draw the air in through the nose, keeping the mouth closed.  Draw in gently, allowing the chest to expand at the sides, hold the  air for a little time, and then breathe out slowly.    These exercises performed in a room that is well ventilated, or,  better still, in the pure air of outdoors, will do much toward driving  away headaches, clearing the brain, giving better judgment, stronger  will, and a clearer, happier, brighter disposition.          CHAPTER VI.    HINDRANCES TO BREATHING.      This little conversation will be on the hindrances to deep breathing,  for if we make up our minds that it is so important to breathe deeply  we shall be very anxious to know how to avoid the hindrances to deep  breathing. First, let me speak of attitude. If you study physiology  and note the arrangement of the internal organs, you will very easily  see that when the body is compressed in a sitting attitude there must  be a hindrance to full and deep breathing. The girl who is running the  typewriter or the sewing-machine, or the girl who is working as  bookkeeper or stenographer, or the girl at her studies, is sitting so  that it will not be possible to breathe deeply, for the lungs are  encroached upon by the crowding together of the other _viscera_ (which  means the vital organs) and the action of the breathing muscles is  impeded by compression. As you will readily observe, there can be no  lifting of the chest in this compressed attitude, no complete  flattening of the diaphragm, no full inflation of the minute  air-cells; therefore, as we have learned, the blood is not thoroughly  purified, and actual poisons created by the vital processes  accumulate in the brain and tissues until you feel overpoweringly  weary and stupid. You cannot think, because you cannot fully breathe.    You have often found, when sewing, that the machine would get, as you  say, bewitched. It wouldn't feed, the thread would break or the needle  would snap, and the whole work go wrong. Put the machine away, take a  rest, and the next day, without doing anything at all to the machine,  you find that it runs perfectly. The trouble was with yourself. It is  so with the girl who is running the typewriter. She finds that it  makes mistakes in spelling, things go wrong altogether. It \"acts up,\"  as she would say. So with the girl who is bookkeeper. The figures will  not add themselves up right. Now if, under these circumstances, the  girl would get up, go to the door, take a few deep breaths and expand  the lungs fully, she would relieve the internal congestion consequent  upon the cramped position, the brain would be freed from the  accumulated poison, and as a consequence the troublesome problems  would soon be solved, the typewriter would spell correctly, the  figures would add themselves up accurately, and life would become  brighter at once. Five minutes spent each hour in deep breathing of  pure air would add both to the quality and quantity of work done, and  so be a saving of time. This certainly is of great value to you in  your work in the world.    After working-hours are over, the girl should make a special effort to  sit erect for other reasons than that of breathing, though that is  reason enough.    But wrong sitting-postures are not the only attitudes that interfere  with deep breathing. Very often the position in standing is also  objectionable. When one stands with the weight resting on the heels  the body is thrown out of balance, and as a consequence the shoulders  are not on a vertical line with the hips. In this attitude it is  impossible to manifest fullness of life, because the lungs are not  fully inflated with air at each breath. We live, enjoy, accomplish  only in proportion to our breathing ability. As one writer says, \"The  deep thinker, the orator, the fine singer, must of necessity be a good  breather.\"    The most serious hindrance to deep breathing is found in the  restrictions of the clothing. I do not say of the corsets, because  tight bands or waists can also compress the body and make full  breathing impossible. Of course you say your dresses are loose, and  you run your hand up under your waist to prove it to me. I will not  argue the question with you, but I will ask you to argue it with  yourself.    If breathing is the measure of your living and doing, then if, in the  least degree, you limit by your dress your breathing, the dress is too  tight. \"Well,\" you ask \"how shall I know if I am hindering my  breathing? My dress feels comfortable. It seems to me that I breathe.  Is there any way that I can prove whether my dress is tight or not?\"    It is true that one becomes accustomed to uncomfortable things and  scarcely realizes that they ever were uncomfortable. The dress may  seem a little tight when you first put it on, then it begins to grow  comfortable, and after a while it feels loose, and you say it  certainly is loose. I will give a simple rule by which you may know  whether your clothing is loose enough or not. Unfasten every article  of clothing; dress, corset, skirt-bands, everything. Now breathe in  slowly until every air-cell is full. It may take some practice to do  this, but persevere until you find the chest elevated and filled to  its utmost extent. It should swell out at the sides along the line of  the insertion of the diaphragm. There should be no heaving of the  chest. Now, with the lungs so completely filled with air, bring your  dress waist together without pulling a particle. Will it fasten  without pressing out a bit of air from the lungs? If so, it is loose  enough. If, however, you have to pull it together, even to the tiniest  extent, you have pressed out some of the air. The minute air-cells  that have thus been emptied cannot be again filled while the dress is  fastened. Therefore you are defrauded of your rightful amount of air,  and because part of the air is pressed out, the lungs take less space  and the dress seems looser. You can understand how that would be.    The trouble is that our dresses are usually fitted over empty lungs.  The dressmaker pulls the dress together, squeezes the air out of the  lungs, and fastens the dress. Now you can readily understand that it  will be impossible to fill those air-cells so long as the dress is  worn, and yet it may not seem uncomfortable, because we become  accustomed to it. Nature has made us so that we "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2846"],[0,"The Life of Flavius Josephus (#7)"],[1," his domestics, and to restore the  Babylonians to Batanea again. He also gave it him in charge to take all  possible care that none of his subjects should be guilty of making any  innovation. Accordingly, upon these directions from the king, he made  haste to do what he was commanded.    37. Now there was one Joseph, the son of a female physician, who excited  a great many young men to join with him. He also insolently addressed  himself to the principal persons at Gamala, and persuaded them to revolt  from the king; and take up arms, and gave them hopes that they should,  by his means, recover their liberty. And some they forced into the  service, and those that would not acquiesce in what they had resolved  on, they slew. They also slew Chares, and with him Jesus, one of his  kinsmen, and a brother of Justus of Tiberias, as we have already said.  Those of Gamala also wrote to me, desiring me to send them an armed  force, and workmen to raise up the walls of their city; nor did I reject  either of their requests. The region of Gaulanitis did also revolt  from the king, as far as the village Solyma. I also built a wall  about Seleucia and Soganni, which are villages naturally of ver great  strength. Moreover, I, in like manner, walled several villages of Upper  Galilee, though they were very rocky of themselves. Their names are  Jamnia, and Meroth, and Achabare. I also fortified, in the Lower  Galilee, the cities Tarichee, Tiberias, Sepphoris, and the villages, the  cave of Arbela, Bersobe, Selamin, Jotapata, Capharecho, and Sigo, and  Japha, and Mount Tabor. [15] I also laid up a great quantity of corn  in these places, and arms withal, that might be for their security  afterward.    38. But the hatred that John, the son of Levi, bore to me, grew now  more violent, while he could not bear my prosperity with patience. So  he proposed to himself, by all means possible, to make away with me;  and built the walls of Gischala, which was the place of his nativity. He  then sent his brother Simon, and Jonathan, the son of Sisenna, and about  a hundred armed men, to Jerusalem, to Simon, the son of Gamaliel, [16]  in order to persuade him to induce the commonalty of Jerusalem to take  from me the government over the Galileans, and to give their suffrages  for conferring that authority upon him. This Simon was of the city of  Jerusalem, and of a very noble family of the sect of the Pharisees,  which are supposed to excel others in the accurate knowledge of the laws  of their country. He was a man of great wisdom and reason, and capable  of restoring public affairs by his prudence, when they were in an ill  posture. He was also an old friend and companion of John; but at that  time he had a difference with me. When therefore he had received such an  exhortation, he persuaded the high priests, Ananus, and Jesus the son of  Gamala, and some others of the same seditious faction, to cut me  down, now I was growing so great, and not to overlook me while I was  aggrandizing myself to the height of glory; and he said that it would be  for the advantage of the Galileans, if I were deprived of my government  there. Ananus also, and his friends, desired them to make no delay about  the matter, lest I should get the knowledge of what was doing too soon,  and should come and make an assault upon the city with a great army.  This was the counsel of Simon; but Artanus the high priest demonstrated  to them that this was not an easy thing to be done, because many of the  high priests and of the rulers of the people bore witness that I had  acted like an excellent general, and that it was the work of ill men to  accuse one against whom they had nothing to say.    39. When Simon heard Ananus say this, he desired that the messengers  would conceal the thing, and not let it come among many; for that he  would take care to have Josephus removed out of Galilee very quickly. So  he called for John's brother, [Simon,] and charged him that they should  send presents to Ananus and his friends; for, as he said, they might  probably by that means persuade them to change their minds. And indeed  Simon did at length thus compass what he aimed at; for Artanus, and  those with him, being corrupted by bribes, agreed to expel me out of  Galilee, without making the rest of the citizens acquainted with what  they were doing. Accordingly, they resolved to send men of distinction  as to their families, and of distinction as to their learning also.  Two of these were of the populace, Jonathan [17] and Ananias, by sect  Pharisees; while the third, Jozar, was of the stock of the priests, and  a Pharisee also; and Simon, the last of them, was of the youngest of the  high priests. These had it given them in charge, that, when they were  come to the multitude of the Galileans, they should ask them, what was  the reason of their love to me? and if they said that it was because I  was born at Jerusalem, that they should reply, that they four were all  born at the same place; and if they should say, it was because I was  well versed in their law, they should reply, that neither were they  unacquainted with the practices of their country; but if, besides these,  they should say, they loved me because I was a priest, they should  reply, that two of these were priests also.    40. Now, when they had given Jonathan and his companions these  instructions, they gave them forty thousand [drachmae] out of the public  money: but when they heard that there was a certain Galilean that then  sojourned at Jerusalem, whose name was Jesus, who had about him a band  of six hundred armed men, they sent for him, and gave him three months  pay, and gave him orders to follow Jonathan and his companions, and be  obedient to them. They also gave money to three hundred men that were  citizens of Jerusalem, to maintain them all, and ordered them also to  follow the ambassadors; and when they had complied, and were gotten  ready for the march, Jonathan and his companions went out with them,  having along with them John's brother and a hundred armed men. The  charge that was given them by those that sent them was this: That if  I would voluntarily lay down my arms, they should send me alive to the  city of Jerusalem; but that, in case I opposed them, they should kill  me, and fear nothing; for that it was their command for them so to do.  They also wrote to John to make all ready for fighting me, and gave  orders to the inhabitants of Sepphoris, and Gabara, and Tiberins, to  send auxiliaries to John.    41. Now, as my father wrote me an account of this, [for Jesus the son of  Gamala, who was present in that council, a friend and companion of mine,  told him of it,] I was very much troubled, as discovering thereby that  my fellow citizens proved so ungrateful to me, as, out of envy, to give  order that I should be slain: my father earnestly pressed me also in his  letter to come to him, for that he longed to see his son before he died.  I informed my friends of these things, and that in three days' time I  should leave the country, and go home. Upon hearing this, they were all  very sorry, and desired me, with tears in their eyes, not to leave them  to be destroyed; for so they thought they should be, if I were deprived  of the command over them: but as I did not grant their request, but was  taking care of my own safety, the Galileans, out of their dread of the  consequence of my departure, that they should then be at the mercy  of the robbers, sent messengers over all Galilee to inform them of my  resolution to leave them. Whereupon, as soon as they heard it, they  got together in great numbers, from all parts, with their wives and  children; and this they did, as it appeared to me, not more out of their  affection to me, than out of their fear on their own account; for while  I staid with them, they supposed that they should suffer no harm. So  they all came into the great plain, wherein I lived, the name of which  was Asochis.    42. But wonderful it was what a dream I saw that very night; for when I  had betaken myself to my bed, as grieved and disturbed at the news that  had been written to me, it seemed to me, that a certain person stood by  me, [18] and said, \"O Josephus! leave off to afflict thy soul, and  put away all fear; for what now grieves thee will render thee very  considerable, and in all respects most happy; for thou shalt get over  not only these difficulties, but many others, with great success.  However, be not cast down, but remember that thou art to fight with the  Romans.\" When I had seen this dream, I got up with an intention of going  down to the plain. Now, when the whole multitude of the Galileans, among  whom were the women and children, saw me, they threw themselves down  upon their faces, and, with tears in their eyes, besought me not to  leave them exposed to their enemies, nor to go away and permit their  country to be injured by them. But when I did not comply, with their  entreaties, they compelled me to take an oath, that I would stay  with them: they also cast abundance of reproaches upon the people of  Jerusalem, that they would not let their country enjoy peace.    43. When I heard this, and saw what sorrow the people were in, I was  moved with compassion to them, and thought it became me to undergo the  most manifest hazards for the sake of so great a multitude; so I let  them know I would stay with them. And when I had given order that five  thousand off them should come to me armed, and with provisions for their  maintenance, I sent the rest away to their own homes; and when those  five thousand were come, I took them, together with three thousand of  the soldiers that were with me before, and eighty horsemen, and marched  to the village of Chabolo, situated in the confines of Ptolimias, and  there kept my forces together, pretending to get ready to fight with  Placidus, who was come with two cohorts of footmen, and one troop of  horsemen, and was "]]]
