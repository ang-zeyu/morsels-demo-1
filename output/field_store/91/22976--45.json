SW San Geronimo, Coahuila.]    _Baculum._--Of _Baiomys_, 166 bacula were processed, using the method of  White (1951:125), and studied. They provide characters of taxonomic  worth at the level of species and aid in evaluating generic  relationships.    The baculum of _B. taylori_ differs from that of _B. musculus_ in: shaft  narrow; wings anterior to base projecting dorsolaterally instead of  anteriorly; anterior part knob-shaped having indentation at tip, instead  of anterior part spatulate-shaped (in some) to knob-shaped (see Figure  7), without indentation; significantly shorter (see Table 4).

Excluding juveniles contained in Table 4, but including young and  subadults, only three bacula of _B. taylori_ were longer than 3 mm., and  only one baculum of _B. musculus_ (a young) was shorter than 3 mm. The  total length of the baculum, considered together with its shape, serves  to identify to species all specimens examined by me.    The bacula of both species of _Baiomys_ were compared with bacula of  _Akodon_, _Scotinomys_, _Holochilus_, _Oryzomys_, _Zygodontomys_,  _Reithrodontomys_, _Thaptomys_, and _Calomys_ and illustrations of  bacula by Blair (1942:197, 200) of _Peromyscus_ (subgenera _Peromyscus_,  _Haplomylomys_, _Podomys_), _Ochrotomys_, and material at the University  of Kansas Museum of Natural History of _Megadontomys_. Shape of baculum  most resembled that of _Ochrotomys_ and _Calomys_. The bacula of  _Baiomys_, as pointed out by Blair (_op cit._:203), differ as much from  those of the genus _Peromyscus_ as do the bacula of _Reithrodontomys_  and _Onychomys_. In size of baculum, _Baiomys_ resembles _Ochrotomys_.  Blair (_op. cit._:202) pointed out that the length of the baculum of _B.  taylori subater_ was contained in the length of the animal's body 20.3  times, and 24.2 times in the length of that of _Ochrotomys nuttalli_.  The length of the baculum of _B. musculus_ (average of 58 specimens  without regard to subspecies) is contained in the length of the body (of  specimens from which the bacula were removed) 22.7 times, a figure  approaching that in _Ochrotomys_. When bacula of both species of  _Baiomys_ were compared to those of _O. nuttalli_, bacula of _B.  musculus_ were found to most closely resemble those of _O. nuttalli_.  The baculum of a single specimen of _Calomys_ (_C. laucha_) was  contained in the length of the body 15.5 times. In general shape, as  well as in possession of an anterior knob and the position of the  expanded posterior wings, the baculum of _C. laucha_ resembles the  baculum of _Ochrotomys_ and _Baiomys musculus_.    Blair (_op. cit._:201) considers generic _versus_ subgeneric rank for  _Ochrotomys_, and on the basis of studies of the phallus Hooper  (1958:23) stated that \"it is clear that _nuttalli_ should be removed  from _Peromyscus_ and should be listed as _Ochrotomys nuttalli_  (Harlan).\" I agree with Hooper (_loc. cit._) and point out that on the  basis of the baculum, there is less of a hiatus between _Baiomys_ on the  one hand, and _Ochrotomys_ and _Calomys_ on the other hand, than there  is between any one of those three genera and _Peromyscus_.    White (1953:631) reported that the baculum of chipmunks might indicate  relationships more clearly than do skulls and skins. He thought that  skulls might more quickly than bacula reflect the habitus of the animal.  The resemblance in cranial morphology between _Peromyscus_ and _Baiomys_  is judged to be the result of such a convergence of habitus and the  baculum in _Baiomys_ is thought to reflect relationships more accurately  than does the skull.    _Auditory ossicles._--Examination of a number of auditory ossicles of  _Baiomys_ reveals constant interspecific differences in the malleus and  incus. There is only slight individual variation, slight variation with  age, and no secondary sexual variation. In _Baiomys taylori_ the  orbicular apophysis of the malleus (see Figure 8, A) is rounded to  nearly ovoid; the anterior process is pointed, and the neck is short,  being slightly recurved. The body of the incus is round and the short  process is elongate. The sides of the long limb of the incus are nearly  parallel. The lenticular process is relatively large. The posterior and  anterior crus of the stapes are bowed, and the muscular process is  either absent or much reduced.    In _Baiomys musculus_, the orbicular apophysis of the malleus (see  Figure 8, B) is round to oblong, and less ovoid than in _B. taylori_;  the anterior process is less acutely pointed than in _B. taylori_, and  the neck is long, less recurved than in _B. taylori_. The body of the  incus, though tending to be round, is more flattened, and the short  process is knob-shaped, not elongated. The sides of the long limb of the  incus are not parallel. The lenticular process is, relative to the size  of the incus, small. The posterior and anterior crus of the stapes are  more nearly straight than in _taylori_. A prominent muscular process  occurs on the posterior crus.    The auditory ossicles of representative species of all the subgenera of  _Peromyscus_ were studied as were the ossicles of _Onychomys_,  _Ochrotomys_, _Oryzomys_, _Akodon_, _Thaptomys_, _Zygodontomys_,  _Calomys_, _Reithrodontomys_, and _Holochilus_.        [Illustration: FIG. 8. Lateral views of auditory ossicles. x 20.        A. _B. taylori analogous_, adult, female, No. 28104 KU, 4 kms.         ENE Tlalmanalco, 2290 meters, Estado de Mexico.        B. _B. musculus pallidus_, adult, male, No. 28346 KU, Cahuilotal,         Sacacoyuca, 960 meters, Guerrero.]    The general plan of structure of the auditory ossicles in _Baiomys_  resembles that in _Calomys_, _Akodon_, and _Thaptomys_. The ossicles of  _Calomys_ and _Thaptomys_, in particular, closely resemble the auditory  ossicles of _Baiomys musculus_. The short process of the incus is  knoblike in _Calomys_ and _Thaptomys_, and the general conformation of  malleus and stapes in those two genera is nearly identical to that in  _B. musculus_. In _Akodon_, the anterior and posterior crus of the  stapes is more rounded than in _B. musculus_, resembling that in _B.  taylori_.    _Reithrodontomys_ differ from _Baiomys_ in having a more elongate  orbicular apophysis on the body of the malleus, an elongated short limb  on the incus, and a stapes having anterior and posterior crura bowed as  in mice of the genus _Peromyscus_.    In _Ochrotomys_, the orbicular apophysis of the malleus resembles the  orbicular apophysis of _B. musculus_, but the short process of the incus  is longer, resembling the short process of _B. taylori_. In general  conformation of the malleus, incus, and stapes, _Ochrotomys_ shows  closer resemblance to _B. taylori_ than to _B. musculus_.    In _Holochilus_ the anterior crus and posterior crus of the stapes are  similar to those in _B. musculus_, but in shape and size of malleus and  incus, _Holochilus_ differs considerably from _B. musculus_ and _B.  taylori_.    In _Zygodontomys_, size and shape of the ossicles differ greatly from  those of _Baiomys_.    In the genus _Peromyscus_, only _Peromyscus floridanus_ (subgenus  _Podomys_) possesses a knoblike short process on the incus similar to  that in _B. musculus_; representatives of the other subgenera examined  possess an elongated short limb on the incus. The conformation of the  ossicles of both _Onychomys_ and _Oryzomys_ appears to be more nearly  like that in _Peromyscus_ than that of _Baiomys_.    On the basis of shape and size of auditory ossicles, _Baiomys_ resembles  South American hesperomines (_Calomys_ and _Thaptomys_) rather than  North American hesperomines.

Type, _Hesperomys (Vesperimus) taylori_ Thomas.    _Diagnosis._--Size small (total length in adults, 93-135); tail shorter  than head and body; hind foot in adults 12-17; ears small (8-12) and  rounded; upper parts blackish sepia to ochraceous-buff; underparts slaty  gray to white or pale buffy; eyes small; hind feet having six plantar  pads, soles nearly naked except for some hairs on anterior parts of  soles and anteriorly to base of toes and between toes; occipitonasal  length of skull in adults, 17.0-21.5; zygomatic breadth, 9.0-11.5;  coronoid process of mandible well developed, strongly recurved;  ascending ramus of mandible short and erect; anterior palatine foramina  (incisive foramina) long, usually terminating posterior to plane of the  front of first molars; posterior palatine foramina nearly opposite  middle of M2; interorbital space wide relative to widest part of  frontals; nasals projecting only slightly over incisors; condyle  terminal; upper incisors relatively heavy; primary first fold of M3  obliterated at an early stage of wear; major cusps of upper and lower  anteriormost two molars alternating, more so in m1-m2 than in M1-M2, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38308"],[0,"Natural History of Cottonmouth Moccasin, Agkistrodon piscovorus (Reptilia) (#7)"],[1," 40 millimeters in  tail length. Weights of the three living young were 10.0, 10.1, and 11.1  grams. Another litter of five young measured by Richard S. Funk were  larger, and differences in the proportions of the tail length and  snout-vent length suggest the sexual dimorphism found in larger  individuals. However, sex of these young snakes was not recorded.  Snout-vent length and tail length in millimeters were 232, 41; 243, 47;  229, 40; 240, 48; and 225, 40 in the order of their birth. These snakes  are considerably smaller than the nine young of _A. p. piscivorus_  reported by Wharton (1960:127) that averaged 338 millimeters total  length and 28.7 grams. The yolk of one young _piscivorus_ was 11.7 per  cent of the total weight. Yolk is used up in about two weeks if its rate  of utilization resembles that of the copperhead as reported by Gloyd  (1934:600).    Early rates of growth of three living young are shown in Table 10. On  the 56th day after birth, each was fed one minnow less than two inches  long. Between the 80th and 120th days three additional small minnows  were fed to each snake. Young cottonmouths increase nearly 50  millimeters in length by the first spring if they inhabit warm areas and  feed in autumn or winter.    Variation in size of newborn cottonmouths may be less in nature than in  captivity. Average size at birth can be determined accurately by the  size of young captured in early spring, at least in northern parts of  the range where winter feeding and growth do not occur at all or are  negligible. Total lengths of 19 juveniles thought by Barbour (1956:38)  to be seven to eight months old do not differ markedly from lengths of  the five newly-born young measured by Funk.

Position of the scar was found by Edgren (1951:1) to be  sexually dimorphic in the eastern hog-nose snake (_Heterodon  platyrhinos_), but nothing has been published on this matter concerning  the cottonmouth. Consequently, I counted the scales of several  individuals from the anal plate, and there was no marked difference in  the position of the scar in males and females; it varied in position  from the 10th to the 18th scale. When counted from the anterior end, the  scar ranged from ventral number 115 to 122 (average, 119) in 28 females  and from number 117 to 126 (average, 121) in 14 males. The difference  between male and female cottonmouths is not nearly so great as in  _Heterodon_.      Later Growth and Bodily Proportions    The only records of growth increments in a natural population of  cottonmouths are those in Table 11. The period of growth is mostly the  period of activity, and differences are expected between northern and  southern populations. As size increases, determination of growth rate  becomes more difficult because age classes overlap in size. Growth of  any individual depends not only on climate and food but also on disease  and parasitism and the innate size potential. Stabler (1951:91) showed  weight and length relationships in two cottonmouths for a period of six  and one-half years.

Of the 306 cottonmouths measured by me, 16 males and  five females exceeded 700 millimeters in snout-vent length. Two males  were more than 850 millimeters long. One cottonmouth lived in captivity  for 18 years and 11 months (Perkins, 1955:262). The maximum total  lengths were reported by Conant (1958:186-187) to be 74 inches (1876  mm.) in _A. p. piscivorus_ and 54 inches (1370 mm.) in _A. p.  leucostoma_.    [Illustration: FIG. 6. Head length (º) and head width (.) expressed as a  percentage of snout-vent length of living and preserved cottonmouths.  Head length was measured from the tip of the snout to the posterior end  of the mandible. Head width was measured across the supraocular scales,  since accuracy was greater than if measured at the posterior edge of the  jaw. No sexual dimorphism or geographical variation occurs in these  characters.]    Proportions of various parts of the body vary considerably depending on  age, size and, in some instances, sex. Heads are proportionately larger  in young than in adults (Fig. 6), as is true of vertebrates in general.  This larger head has survival value for the cottonmouth in permitting  more venom to be produced and in permitting it to be injected deeper  than would be the case if the proportions were the same as in adults.  Relative to the remainder of the snake the head is considerably larger  than in the copperhead (Fitch, 1960:108) and slightly larger than in the  rattlesnake, _Crotalus ruber_ (Klauber, 1956:152).    [Illustration: FIG. 7. Tail length expressed as a percentage of  snout-vent length of living and preserved cottonmouths (.--males;  º--females).]    In general, tails are relatively longer in males than in females of the  same size (Fig. 7), except that there is little or no difference at  birth. Growth of the tail in males proceeds at a more rapid rate. In  certain individuals sex cannot be recognized from length of the tail  relative to snout-vent length because overlapping occurs, especially in  medium-sized individuals. Similar changes of proportions with increase  in age occur in copperheads (Fitch, 1960:106) and rattlesnakes (Klauber,  1956:158-159), but the tail of the cottonmouth is relatively much  longer.          SHEDDING    The Shedding Operation      Shedding of the skin is necessary to provide for growth and wear in  snakes. The milkiness or bluing of the eyes, which causes partial  blindness, marks the initial stage of shedding and is caused by a  discharge of the exuvial glands that loosens the old _stratum corneum_  from the layer below. In four to seven days the opaqueness disappears,  and the snake sheds after an additional three to six days (Table 12).  Young snakes first shed within a few days after birth and generally shed  more frequently than adults, but the interval is variable. The eyes of  three young cottonmouths observed by Wharton (1960:126) became milky on  the fourth day but cleared on the seventh day, and the skin was shed on  the eighth day. The eyes of three young kept by me became milky two to  three days after birth, cleared on the seventh to tenth days, and the  skin was shed on the thirteenth day. Possibly the relatively long  interval in this instance resulted from low relative humidity in the  room where the snakes were kept. According to Fitch (1960:134), litters  of young copperheads usually shed within three to ten days after birth;  but under unusually dry conditions shedding did not occur for several  weeks.

After the skin is loosened from the head, more rubbing against rough  surfaces and writhing serves to pull the old skin off, turning it inside  out.
