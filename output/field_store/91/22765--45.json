Marguerite, tall and queen-like in her rich gown, and costly jewels,  wearing with glorious pride the invisible crown of happy wifehood:  Juliette, slim and girlish, dressed all in white, with a soft, straw  hat on her fair curls, and bearing on an otherwise young and child-like  face, the hard imprint of the terrible sufferings she had undergone, of  the deathly moral battle her tender soul had had to fight.    Soon a group of friends joined them. Paul Deroulede among these, also  Sir Andrew and Lady Ffoulkes, and strolling slowly towards them, his  hands buried in the pockets of his fine cloth breeches, his broad  shoulders set to advantage in a coat of immaculate cut, priceless lace  ruffles at neck and wrist, came the inimitable Sir Percy.          Chapter V: Sir Percy and His Lady        To all appearances he had not changed since those early days of  matrimony, when his young wife dazzled London society by her wit and by  her beauty, and he was one of the many satellites that helped to bring  into bold relief the brilliance of her presence, of her sallies and of  her smiles.    His friends alone, mayhap--and of these only an intimate few--had  understood that beneath that self-same lazy manner, those shy and  awkward ways, that half-inane, half-cynical laugh, there now lurked an  undercurrent of tender and passionate happiness.    That Lady Blakeney was in love with her own husband, nobody could fail  to see, and in the more frivolous cliques of fashionable London this  extraordinary phenomenon had oft been eagerly discussed.    \"A monstrous thing, of a truth, for a woman of fashion to adore her own  husband!\" was the universal pronouncement of the gaily-decked little  world that centred around Carlton House and Ranelagh.    Not that Sir Percy Blakeney was unpopular with the fair sex. Far be it  from the veracious chronicler's mind even to suggest such a thing. The  ladies would have voted any gathering dull if Sir Percy's witty sallies  did not ring from end to end of the dancing hall, if his new satin coat  and 'broidered waistcoat did not call for comment or admiration.    But that was the frivolous set, to which Lady Blakeney had never  belonged.    It was well known that she had always viewed her good-natured husband  as the most willing and most natural butt for her caustic wit; she still  was fond of aiming a shaft or two at him, and he was still equally ready  to let the shaft glance harmlessly against the flawless shield of his  own imperturbable good humour, but now, contrary to all precedent, to  all usages and customs of London society, Marguerite seldom was seen at  routs or at the opera without her husband; she accompanied him to all  the races, and even one night--oh horror!--had danced the gavotte with  him.    Society shuddered and wondered! tried to put Lady Blakeney's sudden  infatuation down to foreign eccentricity, and finally consoled itself  with the thought that after all this nonsense could not last, and that  she was too clever a woman and he too perfect a gentleman to keep up  this abnormal state of things for any length of time.    In the meanwhile, the ladies averred that this matrimonial love was a  very one-sided affair. No one could assert that Sir Percy was anything  but politely indifferent to his wife's obvious attentions. His lazy eyes  never once lighted up when she entered a ball-room, and there were those  who knew for a fact that her ladyship spent many lonely days in her  beautiful home at Richmond whilst her lord and master absented himself  with persistent if unchivalrous regularity.    His presence at the Gala had been a surprise to everyone, for all  thought him still away, fishing in Scotland or shooting in Yorkshire,  anywhere save close to the apron strings of his doting wife. He himself  seemed conscious of the fact that he had not been expected at this  end-of-summer fete, for as he strolled forward to meet his wife and  Juliette Marny, and acknowledge with a bow here and a nod there the many  greetings from subordinates and friends, there was quite an apologetic  air about his good-looking face, and an obvious shyness in his smile.    But Marguerite gave a happy little laugh when she saw him coming towards  her.    \"Oh, Sir Percy!\" she said gaily, \"and pray have you seen the show? I vow  'tis the maddest, merriest throng I've seen for many a day. Nay! but for  the sighs and shudders of my poor little Juliette, I should be enjoying  one of the liveliest days of my life.\"    She patted Juliette's arm affectionately.    \"Do not shame me before Sir Percy,\" murmured the young girl, casting shy  glances at the elegant cavalier before her, vainly trying to find in the  indolent, foppish personality of this society butterfly, some trace of  the daring man of action, the bold adventurer who had snatched her and  her lover from out the very tumbril that bore them both to death.    \"I know I ought to be gay,\" she continued with an attempt at a smile, \"I  ought to forget everything, save what I owe to...\"    Sir Percy's laugh broke in on her half-finished sentence.    \"Lud! and to think of all that I ought not to forget!\" he said loudly.  \"Tony here has been clamouring for iced punch this last half-hour, and I  promised to find a booth wherein the noble liquid is properly dispensed.  Within half an hour from now His Royal Highness will be here. I assure  you, Mlle. Juliette, that from that time onwards I have to endure the  qualms of the damned, for the heir to Great Britain's throne always  contrives to be thirsty when I am satiated, which is Tantalus' torture  magnified a thousandfold, or to be satiated when my parched palate most  requires solace; in either case I am a most pitiable man.\"    \"In either case you contrive to talk a deal of nonsense, Sir Percy,\"  said Marguerite gaily.    \"What else would your ladyship have me do this lazy, hot afternoon?\"    \"Come and view the booths with me,\" she said. \"I am dying for a sight of  the fat woman and the lean man, the pig-faced child, the dwarfs and  the giants. There! Monsieur Deroulede,\" she added, turning to the young  Frenchman who was standing close beside her, \"take Mlle. Juliette to  hear the clavecin players. I vow she is tired of my company.\"    The gaily-dressed group was breaking up. Juliette and Paul Deroulede  were only too ready to stroll off arm-in-arm together, and Sir Andrew  Ffoulkes was ever in attendance on his young wife.    For one moment Marguerite caught her husband's eye. No one was within  earshot.    \"Percy,\" she said.    \"Yes, m'dear.\"    \"When did you return?\"    \"Early this morning.\"    \"You crossed over from Calais?\"    \"From Boulogne.\"    \"Why did you not let me know sooner?\"    \"I could not, dear. I arrived at my lodgings in town, looking a  disgusting object.... I could not appear before you until I had washed  some of the French mud from off my person. Then His Royal Highness  demanded my presence. He wanted news of the Duchesse de Verneuil, whom I  had the honour of escorting over from France. By the time I had told him  all that he wished to hear, there was no chance of finding you at home,  and I thought I should see you here.\"    Marguerite said nothing for a moment, but her foot impatiently tapped  the ground, and her fingers were fidgeting with the gold fringe of her  scarf. The look of joy, of exquisite happiness, seemed to have suddenly  vanished from her face; there was a deep furrow between her brows.    She sighed a short, sharp sigh, and cast a rapid upward glance at her  husband.    He was looking down at her, smiling good-naturedly, a trifle  sarcastically perhaps, and the frown on her face deepened.    \"Percy,\" she said abruptly.    \"Yes, m'dear.\"    \"These anxieties are terrible to bear. You have been twice over to  France within the last month, dealing with your life as lightly as if  it did not now belong to me. When will you give up these mad adventures,  and leave others to fight their own battles and to save their own lives  as best they may?\"    She had spoken with increased vehemence, although her voice was scarce  raised above a whisper. Even in her sudden, passionate anger she was on  her guard not to betray his secret. He did not reply immediately, but  seemed to be studying the beautiful face on which heartbroken anxiety  was now distinctly imprinted.    Then he turned and looked at the solitary booth in the distance, across  the frontal of which a large placard had been recently affixed, bearing  the words: \"Come and see the true representation of the guillotine!\"    In front of the booth a man dressed in ragged breeches, with Phrygian  cap on his head, adorned with a tri-colour cockade, was vigorously  beating a drum, shouting volubly the while:    \"Come in and see, come in and see! the only realistic presentation of  the original guillotine. Hundreds perish in Paris every day! Come and  see! Come and see! the perfectly vivid performance of what goes on  hourly in Paris at the present moment.\"    Marguerite had followed the direction of Sir Percy's eyes. She too was  looking at the booth, she heard the man's monotonous, raucous cries. She  gave a slight shudder and once more looked imploringly at her husband.  His face--though outwardly as lazy and calm as before--had a strange set  look about the mouth and firm jaw, and his slender hand, the hand of a  dandy accustomed to handle cards and dice and to play lightly with the  foils, was clutched tightly beneath the folds of the priceless Mechlin  frills.    It was but a momentary stiffening of the whole powerful frame, an  instant's flash of the ruling passion hidden within that very secretive  soul. Then he once more turned towards her, the rigid lines of his face  relaxed, he broke into a pleasant laugh, and with the most elaborate and  most courtly bow he took her hand in his and raising her "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27867"],[0,"Scientific American magazine, Vol. 2 Issue 1 (#7)"],[1,"would appear to be far preferable.

We presented in a late number, a brief extract from an article on this  subject from the \"Eureka,\" and should have thought no more of it, had  we not observed the following notice editorial in the N, Y. Farmer and  Mechanic. We copy the article entire, that our readers may judge for  themselves whether the style and statements savor most of reality or  humbug.    \"NEW PAVEMENTS.--A new system of making streets has been made known to  us;--but as it will be the subject of Patents, here and in Europe, we  can only give some of its most prominent features. A material or  composition, of a very cheap character, has been invented, as hard,  strong and compact as flint. It is formed into any desirable shape in  the course of manufacture. From this, streets of any grade may be  formed, and in such a way as to entirely secure a permanent and level  surface to its proper arch; it can be taken up in five minutes, so as  to get at the water pipes, and on being replaced will, from necessity,  resume its first position. In durability, it will last ten times as  long as granite, and twenty times as long as the common paving,  without liability to require repair. It is so laid that frost and  storms cannot affect it. But we shall have occasion to refer to it  again\".--Persons wishing information may inquire of Kingsley & Pirsson,  No. 5 Wall street.           *       *       *       *       *          TO RENDER SHINGLES DURABLE.      One of our exchanges mentions an experiment which was made  twenty-seven years ago, of dipping shingles into hot linseed oil prior  to nailing them on the roof: and although they have not been painted,  they are said to continue perfectly sound as when first put on. They  were of the common pine, and as much exposed as roofs in general. This  instance may be sufficient to establish the fact that shingles thus  prepared, will last longer without painting than they could possibly  be preserved by painting in the usual way. As a security against fire,  however, we should recommend that they be first dipped in a hot  solution of common salt; and afterward, when dry, be dipped in the hot  oil. The expense will be trifling, and there can be no doubt of their  durability, and there will be no danger of their taking fire from  sparks or cinders.           *       *       *       *       *          BEST PLAN OF A BARN.      Perhaps no building on the farm in the Northern States is of more  importance than the barn. Those who have had the charge of cattle  during our long winters, can at once see that much time and hard labor  could be saved by a judicious arrangement of stalls, and bay or bay  lots, granaries, &c, so that every creature could be fed by taking as  few steps as possible. One very important thing to be considered, is  the best mode of preserving as well as collecting manure, so that it  shall retain all its valuable properties in the spring, and be easily  got out. We like the plan of having a barn on the side of a hill, and  so arranged that you may drive your cart load in pretty near the ridge  pole, and thus pitch most of your hay down instead of up. Having your  stalls under the hay, you can continue to pitch the hay down, and if  you have a cellar beneath, you can throw the manure down also, and  thus make the attraction of gravitation perform much of the labor of  transportation from the mow to the manure cart.           *       *       *       *       *      The Westfield, Mass., News-Letter states that there are between 25 and  30 manufacturers of whips in that town, who employ not less than 1000  braiders, beside their shop hands.           *       *       *       *       *          ROBERT FULTON.      Robert Fulton, a celebrated engineer, whose name is connected with  steamboat navigation, was born in the town of Little Britain, in the  state of Pennsylvania, in 1765. His genius disclosed itself at an  early period. He was attracted to the shops of mechanics; and at the  age of seven he painted landscapes and portraits in Philadelphia. Thus  he was enabled in part to purchase a small farm for his widowed  mother. At the age of twenty-one, he by the advice of his friends  repaired to London, to place himself under guidance of Mr. West, the  painter, and by him was kindly received, and admitted as an inmate of  his house for several years. Prosecuting his business as painter, he  spent two years in Devonshire, where he became acquainted with the  duke of Bridgewater and with lord Stanhope, well known for his  attachment to the mechanic arts. In 1793, he engaged in the project of  improving inland navigation, and in 1796, obtained patents for a  double inclined plane, and for machines for spinning flax and making  ropes. The subject of canals now chiefly occupied his attention, and  at this period, in 1796, his work on canals was published. In his  profession of civil engineer he was greatly benefitted by his skill in  drawing and painting. He went to Paris in 1797, and being received  into the family of Joel Barlow, he there spent seven years, studying  chemistry, physics and mathematics, and acquiring a knowledge of the  French, Italian, and German languages. In Dec. 1797, he made his first  experiment on sub-marine explosion in the Seine, but without success.  His plan for a sub-marine boat was afterwards perfected.--In 1801,  while he was residing with his friend, Mr. Barlow, he met in Paris  Chancellor Livingston, the American minister, who explained to him the  importance in America of navigating boats by steam. Mr. Fulton had  already conceived the project as early as 1793, as appears by his  letter to lord Stanhope. He now engaged anew in the affair, and at the  common expense of himself and Mr. Livingston built a boat on the  Seine, in 1803, and successfully navigated the river. The principles  of the steam engine he did not invent; he claimed only the application  of that machine to water wheel, for propelling vessels. In 1806 he  returned to America; he and Mr. Livingston built, in 1807, the first  boat, the Clermont, 130 feet in length, which navigated the Hudson at  the rate of five miles an hour. Nothing could exceed the surprise and  admiration of all who witnessed the experiment. The minds of the most  incredulous were, changed in a few minutes. Before the boat had made  the progress of a quarter of a mile, the greatest unbeliever must have  been converted. The man who, while he looked on the expensive machine,  thanked his stars that he had more wisdom than to waste his money on  such idle schemes, changed the expression of his features as the boat  moved from the wharf and gained her speed, and his complacent  expression gradually softened into one of wonder. The jeers of the  ignorant, who had neither sense nor feeling to suppress their  contemptuous ridicule and rude jokes, were silenced for a moment by a  vulgar astonishment, which deprived them of the power of utterance,  till the triumph of genius extorted from the incredulous multitude  which crowded the shores, shouts and acclamations of congratulation  and applause. In February, 1809, he took out his first patent. In 1811  and 1812, he built two steam ferry boats for crossing the Hudson; he  contrived also a very ingenious floating dock for the reception of  those boats. In 1813, he obtained a patent for a sub-marine battery.  Conceiving the plan of a steam man-of-war, the government, in March  1814, appropriated $320,000 for constructing it, and appointed him the  engineer. In about four months, she was launched with the name of  Fulton the First; but before this frigate was finished, Fulton had  paid the debt of nature.           *       *       *       *       *      The population of Great Britain for the last ten years shows an  average annual increase of 230,000.

With our best bow, we present ourselves before our friends and the  public, in a new dress, from head to foot, and though conscious of  appearing rather plain and quaker-like, we can assure our friends that  in this, we conform to the newest fashion, and have no doubt of being  treated civilly by as large a portion of the public, as if we had  appeared with more gay feathers in our cap, with starched ruffles and  gilt buttons and trimmings. In this, however, we would not be  understood to boast, of any peculiar evidence of taste of our own, as  we have been induced in this instance, to submit wholly to that of our  tailors, who it must be conceded, understand these things much better;  while we have only to regard alertness and independence of movement,  with a little vivacity, and intelligence of conversation.--Our general  principles, and rules of self-government will continue according to  our original pledge, and the policy pursued in our first volume: we  shall endeavor to encourage and excite a spirit of enterprise and  emulation in artists, manufactures and mechanics, while we present  such instruction and useful intelligence in arts and trades, practical  science and new discoveries, inventions and improvements, as will add  to the facilities of enterprise, and conduce to "]]]
