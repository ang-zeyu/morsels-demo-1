I was in want of boots, of clothes, of the  whole human varnish that makes a man perceptible. I took my way--I  tell it to you, but you will not put it in any book--I took my way to  the cake woman--I hid myself behind her; the woman didn't think how  much she concealed. I went out first in the evening; I ran about the  streets in the moonlight; I made myself long up the walls--it tickles  the back so delightfully! I ran up, and ran down, peeped into the  highest windows, into the saloons, and on the roofs, I peeped in where  no one could peep, and I saw what no one else saw, what no one else  should see! This is, in fact, a base world! I would not be a man if it  were not now once accepted and regarded as something to be so! I saw  the most unimaginable things with the women, with the men, with  parents, and with the sweet, matchless children; I saw,\" said the  shadow \"what no human being must know, but what they would all so  willingly know--what is bad in their neighbor. Had I written a  newspaper, it would have been read! but I wrote direct to the persons  themselves, and there was consternation in all the towns where I came.  They were so afraid of me, and yet they were so excessively fond of  me. The professors made a professor of me; the tailors gave me new  clothes--I am well furnished; the master of the mint struck new coin  for me, and the women said I was so handsome! and so I became the man  I am. And I now bid you farewell;--here is my card--I live on the  sunny side of the street, and am always at home in rainy weather!\" And  so away went the shadow.    \"That was most extraordinary!\" said the learned man.    Years and days passed away, then the shadow came again.    \"How goes it?\" said the shadow.    \"Alas!\" said the learned man, \"I write about the true, and the good,  and the beautiful, but no one cares to hear such things; I am quite  desperate, for I take it so much to heart!\"    \"But I don't!\" said the shadow, \"I become fat, and it is that one  wants to become! You do not understand the world. You will become ill  by it. You must travel! I shall make a tour this summer; will you go  with me?--I should like to have a travelling companion! will you go  with me, as shadow? It will be a great pleasure for me to have you  with me; I shall pay the travelling expenses!\"    \"Nay, this is too much!\" said the learned man.    \"It is just as one takes it!\"--said the shadow. \"It will do you much  good to travel!--will you be my shadow?--you shall have everything  free on the journey!\"    \"Nay, that is too bad!\" said the learned man.    \"But it is just so with the world!\" said the shadow,--\"and so it will  be!\"--and away it went again.    The learned man was not at all in the most enviable state; grief and  torment followed him, and what he said about the true, and the good,  and the beautiful, was, to most persons, like roses for a cow!--he was  quite ill at last.    \"You really look like a shadow!\" said his friends to him; and the  learned man trembled, for he thought of it.    \"You must go to a watering-place!\" said the shadow, who came and  visited him; \"there is nothing else for it! I will take you with me  for old acquaintance' sake; I will pay the travelling expenses, and  you write the descriptions--and if they are a little amusing for me on  the way! I will go to a watering-place,--my beard does not grow out as  it ought--that is also a sickness--and one must have a beard! Now you  be wise and accept the offer; we shall travel as comrades!\"    And so they travelled; the shadow was master, and the master was the  shadow; they drove with each other, they rode and walked together,  side by side, before and behind, just as the sun was; the shadow  always took care to keep itself in the master's place. Now the learned  man didn't think much about that; he was a very kind-hearted man, and  particularly mild and friendly, and so he said one day to the shadow:  \"As we have now become companions, and in this way have grown up  together from childhood, shall we not drink '_thou_' together, it is  more familiar?\"    \"You are right,\" said the shadow, who was now the proper master. \"It  is said in a very straight-forward and well-meant manner. You, as a  learned man, certainty know how strange nature is. Some persons cannot  bear to touch grey paper, or they become ill; others shiver in every  limb if one rub a pane of glass with a nail: I have just such a  feeling on hearing you say _thou_ to me; I feel myself as if pressed  to the earth in my first situation with you. You see that it is a  feeling; that it is not pride: I cannot allow you to say _thou_ to me,  but I will willingly say _thou_ to you, so it is half done!\"    So the shadow said _thou_ to its former master.    \"This is rather too bad,\" thought he, that I must say _you_ and he say  \"thou,\" but he was now obliged to put up with it.    So they came to a watering-place where there were many strangers, and  amongst them was a princess, who was troubled with seeing too well;  and that was so alarming!    She directly observed that the stranger who had just come was quite a  different sort of person to all the others;--\"He has come here in  order to get his beard to grow, they say, but I see the real cause, he  cannot cast a shadow.\"    She had become inquisitive; and so she entered into conversation  directly with the strange gentleman, on their promenades. As the  daughter of a king, she needed not to stand upon trifles, so she said,  \"Your complaint is, that you cannot cast a shadow?\"    \"Your Royal Highness must be improving considerably,\" said the  shadow,--\"I know your complaint is, that you see too clearly, but it  has decreased, you are cured. I just happen to have a very unusual  shadow! Do you not see that person who always goes with me? Other  persons have a common shadow, but I do not like what is common to all.  We give our servants finer cloth for their livery than we ourselves  use, and so I had my shadow trimmed up into a man: yes, you see I have  even given him a shadow. It is somewhat expensive, but I like to have  something for myself!\"    \"What!\" thought the princess, \"should I really be cured! These baths  are the first in the world! In our time water has wonderful powers.  But I shall not leave the place, for it now begins to be amusing here.  I am extremely fond of that stranger: would that his beard should not  grow! for in that case he will leave us.\"    In the evening, the princess and the shadow danced together in the  large ball-room. She was light, but he was still lighter; she had  never had such a partner in the dance. She told him from what land she  came, and he knew that land; he had been there, but then she was not  at home; he had peeped in at the window, above and below--he had seen  both the one and the other, and so he could answer the princess, and  make insinuations, so that she was quite astonished; he must be the  wisest man in the whole world! she felt such respect for what he knew!  So that when they again danced together she fell in love with him; and  that the shadow could remark, for she almost pierced him through with  her eyes. So they danced once more together; and she was about to  declare herself, but she was discreet; she thought of her country and  kingdom, and of the many persons she would have to reign over.    \"He is a wise man,\" said she to herself--\"It is well; and he dances  delightfully--that is also good; but has he solid knowledge?--that is  just as important!--he must be examined.\"    So she began, by degrees, to question him about the most difficult  things she could think of, and which she herself could not have  answered; so that the shadow made a strange face.    \"You cannot answer these questions?\" said the princess.    \"They belong to my childhood's learning,\" said the shadow. \"I really  believe my shadow, by the door there, can answer them!\"    \"Your shadow!\" said the princess; \"that would indeed be marvellous!\"    \"I will not say for a certainty that he can,\" said the shadow, \"but I  think so; he has now followed me for so many years, and listened to my  conversation--I should think it possible. But your royal highness will  permit me to observe, that he is so proud of passing himself off for a  man, that when he is to be in a proper humor--and he must be so to  answer well--he must be treated quite like a man.\"    \"Oh! I like that!\" said the princess.    So she went to the learned man by the door, and she spoke to him about  the sun and the moon, and about persons out of and in the world, and  he answered with wisdom and prudence.    \"What a man that must be who has so wise a shadow!\" thought she; \"It  will be a real blessing to my people and kingdom if I choose him for  my consort--I will do it!\"    They were soon agreed, both the princess and the shadow; but no one  was to know about it before she arrived in her own kingdom.    \"No one--not even my shadow!\" said the shadow, and he had his own  thoughts about it!    Now they were in the country where the princess reigned when she was  at home.    \"Listen, my good friend,\" said the shadow to the learned man. \"I have  now become as happy and mighty as any one can be; I will, therefore,  do something particular for thee! Thou shalt always live with me in  the palace, drive with me in my royal carriage, and have ten thousand  pounds a year; but then thou must submit to be called shadow by all  and every one; thou must not say that thou hast ever been a man; and  once a-year, when I sit on the balcony in the sunshine, thou must lie  at my feet, as a shadow shall do! I must tell thee: I am going to  marry the king's daughter, and the nuptials are to take place this  evening!\"    \"Nay, this is going too far!\" said the learned man; \"I will not have  it; I will not do it! it is to deceive the whole country and the  princess too! I will tell every thing!--that I am a man, and that thou  art a shadow--thou art only dressed up!"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31111"],[0,"Across Asia on a Bicycle (#7)"],[1,"the very start. The Vali was evidently in a  bad humor, for we overheard him storming in a high key at some one in the  room with him. As we passed under the heavy matted curtains the two  attendants who were holding them up cast a rather horrified glance at our  dusty shoes and unconventional costume. The Vali was sitting in a large  arm-chair in front of a very small desk, placed at the far end of a  vacant-looking room. After the usual salaams, he motioned to a seat on the  divan, and proceeded at once to examine our credentials while we sipped at  our coffee, and whiffed the small cigarettes which were immediately  served. This furnished the Vali an opportunity to regain his usual  composure. He was evidently an autocrat of the severest type; if we  pleased him, it would be all right; if we did not, it would be all wrong.  We showed him everything we had, from our Chinese passport to the little  photographic camera, and related some of the most amusing incidents of our  journey through his country. From the numerous questions he asked we felt  certain of his genuine interest, and were more than pleased to see an  occasional broad smile on his countenance. \"Well,\" said he, as we rose to  take leave, \"your passports will be ready any time after to-morrow; in the  mean time I shall be pleased to have your horses quartered and fed at  government expense.\" This was a big joke for a Turk, and assured us of his  good-will.    A bicycle exhibition which the Vali had requested was given the morning of  our departure for Bayazid, on a level stretch of road just outside the  city. Several missionaries and members of the consulates had gone out in  carriages, and formed a little group by themselves. We rode up with the  \"stars and stripes\" and \"star and crescent\" fluttering side by side from  the handle-bars. It was always our custom, especially on diplomatic  occasions, to have a little flag of the country associated with that of  our own. This little arrangement evoked a smile from the Vali, who, when  the exhibition was finished, stepped forward and said, \"I am satisfied, I  am pleased.\" His richly caparisoned white charger was now brought up.  Leaping into the saddle, he waved us good-by, and moved away with his  suite toward the city. We ourselves remained for a few moments to bid  good-by to our hospitable friends, and then, once more, continued our  journey toward the east.      [Illustration]                                                II                              THE ASCENT OF MOUNT ARARAT      According to tradition, Mount Ararat is the scene of two of the most  important events in the history of the human race. In the sacred land of  Eden, which Armenian legend places at its base, the first of human life  was born; and on its solitary peak the last of human life was saved from  an all-destroying flood. The remarkable geographical position of this  mountain seems to justify the Armenian view that it is the center of the  world. It is on the longest line drawn through the Old World from the Cape  of Good Hope to Bering Strait; it is also on the line of the great deserts  and inland seas stretching from Gibraltar to Lake Baikal in Siberia--a line  of continuous depressions; it is equidistant from the Black and Caspian  Seas and the Mesopotamian plain, which three depressions are now watered  by three distinct river-systems emanating from Ararat's immediate  vicinity. No other region has seen or heard so much of the story of  mankind. In its grim presence empires have come and gone; cities have  risen and fallen; human life has soared up on the wings of hope, and  dashed against the rocks of despair.    To the eye Ararat presents a gently inclined slope of sand and ashes  rising into a belt of green, another zone of black volcanic rocks streaked  with snow-beds, and then a glittering crest of silver. From the burning  desert at its base to the icy pinnacle above, it rises through a vertical  distance of 13,000 feet. There are but few peaks in the world that rise so  high (17,250 feet above sea-level) from so low a plain (2000 feet on the  Russian, and 4000 feet on the Turkish, side), and which, therefore,  present so grand a spectacle. Unlike many of the world's mountains, it  stands alone. Little Ararat (12,840 feet above sea-level), and the other  still smaller heights that dot the plain, only serve as a standard by  which to measure Ararat's immensity and grandeur.    Little Ararat is the meeting-point, or corner-stone, of three great  empires. On its conical peak converge the dominions of the Czar, the  Sultan, and the Shah. The Russian border-line runs from Little Ararat  along the high ridge which separates it from Great Ararat, through the  peak of the latter, and onward a short distance to the northwest, then  turns sharply to the west. On the Sardarbulakh pass, between Great and  Little Ararat, is stationed a handful of Russian Cossacks to remind  lawless tribes of the guardianship of the \"White Sultan.\"    The two Ararats together form an elliptical mass, about twenty-five miles  in length, running northwest and southeast, and about half that in width.  Out of this massive base rise the two Ararat peaks, their bases being  contiguous up to 8800 feet and their tops about seven miles apart. Little  Ararat is an almost perfect truncated cone, while Great Ararat is more of  a broad-shouldered dome supported by strong, rough-ribbed buttresses. The  isolated position of Ararat, its structure of igneous rocks, the presence  of small craters and immense volcanic fissures on its slopes, and the  scoriae and ashes on the surrounding plain, establish beyond a doubt its  volcanic origin. But according to the upheaval theory of the eminent  geologist, Hermann Abich, who was among the few to make the ascent of the  mountain, there never was a great central crater in either Great or Little  Ararat. Certain it is that no craters or signs of craters now exist on the  summit of either mountain. But Mr. James Bryce, who made the last ascent,  in 1876, seems to think that there is no sufficient reason why craters  could not have previously existed, and been filled up by their own  irruptions. There is no record of any irruption in historical times. The  only thing approaching it was the earthquake which shook the mountain in  1840, accompanied by subterranean rumblings, and destructive blasts of  wind. The Tatar village of Arghuri and a Kurdish encampment on the  northeast slope were entirely destroyed by the precipitated rocks. Not a  man was left to tell the story. Mr. Bryce and others have spoken of the  astonishing height of the snow-line on Mount Ararat, which is placed at  14,000 feet; while in the Alps it is only about 9000 feet, and in the  Caucasus on an average 11,000 feet, although they lie in a very little  higher latitude. They assign, as a reason for this, the exceptionally dry  region in which Ararat is situated. Mr. Bryce ascended the mountain on  September 12, when the snow-line was at its very highest, the first large  snow-bed he encountered being at 12,000 feet. Our own ascent being made as  early as July 4,--in fact, the earliest ever recorded,--we found some snow  as low as 8000 feet, and large beds at 10,500 feet. The top of Little  Ararat was still at that time streaked with snow, but not covered. With so  many extensive snow-beds, one would naturally expect to find copious  brooks and streams flowing down the mountain into the plain; but owing to  the porous and dry nature of the soil, the water is entirely lost before  reaching the base of the mountain. Even as early as July we saw no stream  below 6000 feet, and even above this height the mountain freshets  frequently flowed far beneath the surface under the loosely packed rocks,  bidding defiance to our efforts to reach them. Notwithstanding the  scarcity of snow-freshets, there is a middle zone on Mount Ararat,  extending from about 5000 feet to 9000 feet elevation, which is covered  with good pasturage, kept green by heavy dews and frequent showers. The  hot air begins to rise from the desert plain as the morning sun peeps over  the horizon, and continues through the day; this warm current, striking  against the snow-covered summit, is condensed into clouds and moisture. In  consequence, the top of Ararat is usually--during the summer months, at  least--obscured by clouds from some time after dawn until sunset. On the  last day of our ascent, however, we were particularly fortunate in having  a clear summit until 1:15 in the afternoon.    Among the crags of the upper slope are found only a few specimens of the  wild goat and sheep, and, lower down, the fox, wolf, and lynx. The bird  and insect life is very scanty, but lizards and scorpions, especially on  the lowest slopes, are abundant. The rich pasturage of Ararat's middle  zone attracts pastoral Kurdish tribes. These nomadic shepherds, a few  Tatars at New Arghuri, and a camp of Russian Cossacks at the well of  Sardarbulakh, are the only human beings to disturb the quiet solitude of  this grandest of nature's sanctuaries.    The first recorded ascent of Mount Ararat was in 1829, by Dr. Frederick  Parrot, a Russo-German professor in the University of Dorpat. He reached  the summit with a party of three Armenians and two Russian soldiers, after  two unsuccessful attempts. His ascent, however, was doubted, not only by  the people in the neighborhood, but by many men of science and position in  the Russian empire, notwithstanding his clear account, which has been  confirmed by subsequent observers, and in spite of the testimony of the  two Russian soldiers who had gone with him.(1) Two of the Armenians who  reached the summit with him declared that they had gone to a great height,  but at the point where they had left off had seen much higher tops rising  around them. This, thereupon, became the opinion of the whole country.  After Antonomoff, in 1834, Herr Abich, the geologist,"]]]
