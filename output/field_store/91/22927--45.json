Saveria spoke truly when she     said, that of all the children of Signora Laetitia, the Emperor was     the one from whom future greatness was least to be prognosticated\"     (vol. i. p. 10, edit. 1883)]--    Generally speaking, Bonaparte was not much liked by his comrades at  Brienne. He was not social with them, and rarely took part in their  amusements. His country's recent submission to France always caused in  his mind a painful feeling, which estranged him from his schoolfellows.  I, however, was almost his constant companion. During play-hours he used  to withdraw to the library, where he-read with deep interest works  of history, particularly Polybius and Plutarch. He was also fond of  Arrianus, but did not care much for Quintus Gurtius. I often went off to  play with my comrades, and left him by himself in the library.    The temper of the young Corsican was not improved by the teasing he  frequently experienced from his comrades, who were fond of ridiculing  him about his Christian name Napoleon and his country. He often said to  me, \"I will do these French all the mischief I can;\" and when I tried to  pacify him he would say, \"But you do not ridicule me; you like me.\"    Father Patrauld, our mathematical professor, was much attached to  Bonaparte. He was justly proud of him as a pupil. The other professors,  in whose classes he was not distinguished, took little notice of him. He  had no taste for the study of languages, polite literature, or the arts.  As there were no indications of his ever becoming a scholar, the pedants  of the establishment were inclined to think him stupid. His superior  intelligence was, however, sufficiently perceptible, even through  the reserve under which it was veiled. If the monks to whom the  superintendence of the establishment was confided had understood the  organisation of his mind, if they had engaged more able mathematical  professors, or if we had had any incitement to the study of chemistry,  natural philosophy, astronomy, etc., I am convinced that Bonaparte  would have pursued these sciences with all the genius and spirit of  investigation which he displayed in a career, more brilliant it is true,  but less useful to mankind. Unfortunately, the monks did not perceive  this, and were too poor to pay for good masters. However, after  Bonaparte left the college they found it necessary to engage two  professors from Paris, otherwise the college would have fallen to  nothing. These two new professors, MM. Durfort and Desponts, finished  my education; and I regretted that they did not come sooner. The  often-repeated assertion of Bonaparte having received a careful  education at Brienne is therefore untrue. The monks were incapable of  giving it him; and, for my own part, I must confess that the extended  information of the present day is to me a painful contrast with the  limited course of education I received at the Military College. It is  only surprising that the establishment should have produced a single  able man.    Though Bonaparte had no reason to be satisfied with the treatment he  received from his comrades, yet he was above complaining of it; and when  he had the supervision of any duty which they infringed, he would rather  go to prison than denounce the criminals.    I was one day his accomplice in omitting to enforce a duty which we were  appointed to supervise. He prevailed on me to accompany him to prison,  where we remained three days. We suffered this sort of punishment  several times, but with less severity.    In 1783 the Duke of Orleans and Madame de Montesson visited Brienne;  and, for upwards of a month, the magnificent chateau of the Comte  de Brienne was a Versailles in miniature. The series of brilliant  entertainments which were given to the august travellers made them  almost forget the royal magnificence they had left behind them.    The Prince and Madame de Montesson expressed a wish to preside at the  distribution of the prizes of our college. Bonaparte and I won the  prizes in the class of mathematics, which, as I have already observed,  was the branch of study to which he confined his attention, and in  which he excelled. When I was called up for the seventh time Madame de  Montesson said to my mother, who had come from Sens to be present at  the distribution, \"Pray, madame, crown your son this time; my hands are  a-weary.\"    There was an inspector of the military schools, whose business it was  to make an annual report on each pupil, whether educated at the public  expense or paid for by his family. I copied from the report of 1784 a  note which was probably obtained surreptitiously from the War Office. I  wanted to purchase the manuscript, but Louis Bonaparte bought it. I did  not make a copy of the note which related to myself, because I should  naturally have felt diffident in making any use of it. It would,  however, have served to show how time and circumstances frequently  reversed the distinctions which arise at school or college. Judging from  the reports of the inspector of military schools, young Bonaparte was  not, of all the pupils at Brienne in 1784, the one most calculated to  excite prognostics of future greatness and glory.    The note to which I have just alluded, and which was written by M. de  Kerralio, then inspector of the military schools, describes Bonaparte in  the following terms:                 INSPECTION OF MILITARY SCHOOLS                   1784.         REPORT MADE FOR HIS MAJESTY BY M. DE KERALIO.       M. de Buonaparte (Napoleon), born 15th August 1769, height 4 feet 10     inches 10 lines, is in the fourth class, has a good constitution,     excellent health, character obedient, upright, grateful, conduct     very regular; has been always distinguished by his application to     mathematics. He knows history and geography very passably. He is     not well up in ornamental studies or in Latin in which he is only in     the fourth class. He will be an excellent sailor. He deserves to     be passed on to the Military School of Paris.    Father Berton, however, opposed Bonaparte's removal to Paris, because  he had not passed through the fourth Latin class, and the regulations  required that he should be in the third. I was informed by the  vice-principal that a report relative to Napoleon was sent from the  College of Brienne to that of Paris, in which he was described as being  domineering, imperious, and obstinate.         --[Napoleon remained upwards of five years at Brienne, from April     1779 till the latter end of 1784. In 1783 the Chevalier Keralio,     sub-inspector of the military schools, selected him to pass the year     following to the military school at Paris, to which three of the     best scholars were annually sent from each of the twelve provincial     military schools of France. It is curious as well as satisfactory     to know the opinion at this time entertained of him by those who     were the best qualified to judge. His old master, Le Guille,     professor of history at Paris, boasted that, in a list of the     different scholars, he had predicted his pupil's subsequent career.     In fact, to the name of Bonaparte the following note is added: \"a     Corsican by birth and character--he will do something great, if     circumstances favour him.\" Menge was his instructor in geometry,     who also entertained a high opinion of him. M. Bauer, his German     master, was the only one who saw nothing in him, and was surprised     at being told he was undergoing his examination for the artillery.     --Hazlitt.]--    I knew Bonaparte well; and I think M. de Keralio's report of him was  exceedingly just, except, perhaps, that he might have said he was very  well as to his progress in history and geography, and very backward in  Latin; but certainly nothing indicated the probability of his being an  excellent seaman. He himself had no thought of the navy.         --[Bourrienne is certainly wrong as to Bonaparte having no thought     of the navy. In a letter of 1784 to the Minister of War his father     says of Napoleon that, \"following the advice of the Comte de     Marbeuf, he has turned his studies towards the navy; and so well has     he succeeded that he was intended by M. de Keralio for the school of     Paris, and afterwards for the department of Toulon. The retirement     of the former professor (Keralio) has changed the fate of my son.\"     It was only on the failure of his intention to get into the navy     that his father, on 15th July 1784 applied for permission for him to     enter the artillery; Napoleon having a horror of the infantry, where     he said they did nothing. It was on the success of this application     that he was allowed to enter the school of Parts (Iung, tome i. pp.     91-103). Oddly enough, in later years, on 30th August 1792, having     just succeeded in getting himself reinstated as captain after his     absence, overstaying leave, he applied to pass into the Artillerie     de la Marine. \"The application was judged to be simply absurd, and     was filed with this note, 'S. R.' ('sans reponse')\" (Iung, tome ii.     p. 201)]--    In consequence of M. de Keralio's report, Bonaparte was transferred to  the Military College of Paris, along with MM. Montarby de Dampierre, de  Castres, de Comminges, and de Laugier de Bellecourt, who were all, like  him, educated at the public expense, and all, at least, as favorably  reported.    What could have induced Sir Walter Scott to say that Bonaparte was the  pride of the college, that our mathematical master was exceedingly fond  of him, and that the other professors in the different sciences had  equal reason to be satisfied with him? What I have above stated,  together with the report of M. de Keralio, bear evidence of his  backwardness in almost every branch of education except mathematics.  Neither was it, as Sir Walter affirms, his precocious progress in  mathematics that occasioned him to be"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35744"],[0,"The gradual acceptance of the Copernican theory of the universe (#7)"],[1,"to combat it. Possibly Osiander's preface turned  opposition aside, and certainly the non-acceptance of the system as a  whole by Tycho Brahe, the leading astronomer of Europe at that time,  made people slow to consider it.    [Footnote 139: Prowe: II, 233-244.]          CHAPTER III.    THE LATER DEVELOPMENT AND SCIENTIFIC DEFENSE OF THE COPERNICAN SYSTEM.      Copernicus accomplished much, but even his genius could not far outrun  the times in which he lived. When one realizes that not only all the  astronomers before him, but he and his immediate successor, Tycho  Brahe, made all their observations and calculations unaided by even  the simplest telescope, by logarithms or by pendulum clocks for  accurate measurement of time,[140] one marvels not at their errors,  but at the greatness of their genius in rising above such  difficulties. This lack of material aids makes the work of Tycho  Brahe,[141] accounted one of the greatest observers that has ever  lived,[142] as notable in its way perhaps as that of Copernicus.    [Footnote 140: Burckhardt: 8.]    [Footnote 141: The two standard lives of Tycho Brahe are the _Vita  Tychonis Brahei_ by Gassendi (1655) till recently the sole source of  information, and Dreyer's _Tycho Brahe_ (1890) based not only on  Gassendi but on the documentary evidence disclosed by the researches  of the 19th century. For Tycho's works I have used the _Opera Omnia_  published at Frankfort in 1648. The Danish Royal Scientific Society  has issued a reprint (1901) of the rare 1573 edition of the _De Nova  Stella_.]    [Footnote 142: Bridges: 206.]    His life[143] was a somewhat romantic one. Born of noble family on  December 14th, 1546, at Knudstrup in Denmark, Tyge Brahe, the second  of ten children,[144] was early practically adopted by his father's  brother. His family wished him to become a statesman and sent him in  1559 to the university at Copenhagen to prepare for that career. A  partial eclipse of the sun on August 21st, 1560 as foretold by the  astronomers thrilled the lad and determined him to study a science  that could foretell the future and so affect men's lives.[145] When he  was sent to Leipsic with a tutor in 1562 to study law, he devoted his  time and money to the study of mathematics and astronomy. Two years  later when eighteen years of age, he resolved to perform anew the task  of Hipparchos and Ptolemy and make a catalogue of the stars more  accurate than theirs. His family hotly opposed these plans; and for  six years he wandered through the German states, now at Wittenberg,  now at Rostock (where he fought the duel in which he lost part of his  nose and had to have it replaced by one of gold and silver)[146] or at  Augsburg--everywhere working on his chosen subjects. But upon his  return to Denmark (1570) he spent two years on chemistry and medicine,  till the startling appearance of the New Star in the constellation of  Cassiopaea (November, 1572) recalled him to what became his life  work.[147]    [Footnote 143: Dreyer: 11-84.]    [Footnote 144: Gassendi: 2.]    [Footnote 145: Dreyer: 13.]    [Footnote 146: Gassendi: 9-10.]    [Footnote 147: Dreyer: 38-44.]    Through the interest and favor of King Frederick II, he was given the  island of Hveen near Elsinore, with money to build an observatory and  the pledge of an annual income from the state treasury for his  support.[148] There at Uraniborg from 1576 to 1597 he and his pupils  made the great catalogue of the stars, and studied comets and the  moon. When he was forced to leave Hveen by the hostility and the  economical tendencies of the young king,[149] after two years of  wandering he accepted the invitation of the Emperor Rudolphus and  established himself at Prague in Bohemia. Among his assistants at  Prague was young Johann Kepler who till Tycho's death (on October 24,  1601) was his chief helper for twenty months, and who afterwards  completed his observations, publishing the results in the Rudolphine  Tables of 1627.    [Footnote 148: Ibid: 84.]    [Footnote 149: Ibid: 234-5.]    This \"Phoenix among Astronomers\"--as Kepler calls him,[150]--was the  father of modern practical astronomy.[151] He also propounded a third  system of the universe, a compromise between the Ptolemaic and the  Copernican. In this the Tychonic system,[152] the earth is motionless  and is the center of the orbits of the sun, the moon, and the sphere  of the fixed stars, while the sun is the center of the orbits of the  five planets.[153] Mercury and Venus move in orbits with radii shorter  than the sun's radius, and the other three planets include the earth  within their circuits. This system was in harmony with the Bible and  accounted as satisfactorily by geometry as either of the other two  systems for the observed phenomena.[154] To Tycho Brahe, the Ptolemaic  system was too complex,[155] and the Copernican absurd, the latter  because to account for the absence of stellar parallax it left vacant  and purposeless a vast space between Saturn and the sphere of the  fixed stars,[156] and because Tycho's observations did not show any  trace of the stellar parallax that must exist if the earth moves.[157]    [Footnote 150: Kepler: _Tabulae Rudolphinae_. Title page.]    [Footnote 151: Dreyer: 317-363.]    [Footnote 152: As stated in his Book on the Comet of 1577 (pub.  1588).]    [Footnote 153: Dreyer: 168-9.]    [Footnote 154: Schiaparelli in Snyder: 165.]    [Footnote 155: Brahe: _Op. Om._, pt. I, p. 337.]    [Footnote 156: Ibid: 409-410.]    [Footnote 157: The Tychonic system has supporters to this day. See  chap. viii.]    Though Tycho thus rejected the Copernican theory, his own proved to be  the stepping stone toward the one he rejected,[158] for by it and by  his study of comets he completely destroyed the ideas of solid  crystalline spheres to the discredit of the scholastics; and his  promulgation of a third theory of the universe helped to diminish  men's confidence in authority and to stimulate independent thinking.    [Footnote 158: Dreyer: 181.]    Copernicus worked out his system by mathematics with but slight aid  from his own observations. It was a theory not yet proven true. Tycho  Brahe, though denying its validity, contributed in his mass of  painstaking, accurate observations the raw material of facts to be  worked up by Kepler into the great laws of the planets attesting the  fundamental truth of the Copernican hypothesis.    Johann Kepler[159] earned for himself the proud title of \"lawmaker for  the universe\" in defiance of his handicaps of ill-health, family  troubles, and straitened finances.[160] Born in Weil, Wurtemberg,  (December 27, 1571) of noble but indigent parents, he was a sickly  child unable for years to attend school regularly. He finally left the  monastery school in Mulifontane in 1586 and entered the university at  Tuebingen to stay for four and a half years. There he studied  philosophy, mathematics, and theology (he was a Lutheran) receiving  the degree of Master of Arts in 1591. While at the university he  studied under Maestlin, professor of mathematics and astronomy, and a  believer in the Copernican theory. Because of Maestlin's teaching  Kepler developed into a confirmed and enthusiastic adherent to the new  doctrine.    [Footnote 159: The authoritative biography is the _Vita_ by Frisch in  vol. VIII, pp. 668-1028 of _Op. Om. Kep._]    [Footnote 160: Frisch: VIII, 718. [Transcriber's Note: Missing  footnote reference in original text has been added above in a logical  place.]]    In 1594 he reluctantly abandoned his favorite study, philosophy, and  accepted a professorship in mathematics at Graetz in Styria. Two years  later he published his first work: _Prodromus Dissertationum continens  mysterium cosmographicum_ etc. (1596) in which he sought to prove that  the Creator in arranging the universe had thought of the five regular  bodies which can be inscribed in a sphere according to which He had  regulated the order, the number and the proportions of the heavens and  their movements.[161] The book is important not only because of its  novelty, but because it gave the Copernican doctrine public  explanation and defense.[162] Kepler himself valued it enough to  reprint it with his _Harmonia Mundi_ twenty-five years later. And it  won for him appreciative letters from various scientists, notably from  Tycho Brahe and Galileo.[163]    [Footnote 161: Delambre: _Astr. Mod._ 314-315.]    [Footnote 162: Frisch: VIII, 999.]    [Footnote 163: Ibid: VIII, 696.]    As Kepler, a Lutheran, was having difficulties in Graetz, a Catholic  city, he finally accepted Tycho's urgent invitation to come to  Prague.[164] He came early in 1600, and after some adjustments had  been made between the two,[165] he and his family settled with Tycho  that autumn to remain till the latter's death the following November.  Kepler himself then held the office of imperial mathematician by  appointment for many years thereafter.[166]    [Footnote 164: Ibid: VIII, 699-715.]    [Footnote 165: Dreyer: 290-309.]    [Footnote 166: Frisch: VIII, 715.]    With the researches of Tycho's lifetime placed at his disposal, Kepler  worked out two of his three great planetary laws from Tycho's  observations of the planet Mars. Yet, as M. Bertrand remarks,[167] it  was well for Kepler that his material was not too accurate or its  variations (due to the then unmeasured force of attraction) might have  hindered him from proving his laws; and luckily for him the earth's  orbit is so nearly circular that in calculating the orbit of Mars to  prove its elliptical form, he could base his work on the earth's orbit  as a circle without vitiating his results for Mars.[168] That a  planet's orbit is an ellipse and not the perfect circle was of course  a triumph for the new science over the scholastics and Aristotelians.  But they had yet to learn what held the planets in their courses.    [Footnote 167: Bertrand: p. 870-1.]    [Footnote 168:"]]]
