A  glacier descends on to it from mountains inland and there is a bay  between cliffs. Then we get a stereo scene of approximately the least  hospitable of scenery I ever did see--except maybe when Parvati Lal  Dutt's brother made me climb up what he swore was the smallest peak in  the Himalayas.    It is a small bay backed by tumbled cliffs. A shelving beach can be  deduced from contour and occasional boulders big enough to stick  through the snow that smothers it all. A sort of mess of rocks and mud  at the back may be glacial moraine. Over the sea the ice is split in  all directions by jagged rifts and channels; the whole thing is a bit  like Antarctica but nothing is high enough or white enough to uplift  the spirit, it looks not only chilly but kind of mean.    \"This place,\" says the colonel, \"is the only one, about which we have  any topographical information, that seems to meet the requirements.  Got to know about it through an elementary planetography. One of the  observers had the sense to see we might need something of the sort.  This place\"--the stereo jigs as he taps his projector--\"seems it's the  center of a rising movement in the crust ... that's not to the point.  Neither side has bothered to claim the land at the poles....\"    I see their point if it's all like this--    \"... And a ship trying to land on those cliffs might very well pitch  over into the sea. That is, if she were trying to land on emergency  rockets.\"    Rockets--that brings home the ancientness of this ship  _Gilgamesh_--but after all the ships that settled Incognita probably  carried emergency rockets, too.    This settled, the meeting turns into a briefing session and merges  imperceptibly with the beginning of the job.           *       *       *       *       *    The job of course is Faking the background of the crash; working out  the past history and present aims of the Lost Kafoozalum. We have to  invent a planet and what's more difficult convey all the essential  information about it by the sort of sideways hints you gather among  peoples' personal possessions; diaries, letters et cetera; and what is  even _more_ difficult we have to leave out anything that could lead to  definite identification of our unknown world with any known one.    We never gave that world a name; it might be dangerous. Who speaks of  their world by name, except to strangers? They call it \"home\"--or  \"Earth,\" as often as not.    Some things have been decided for us. Language, for instance--one of  two thousand or so Earth tongues that went out of use late enough to  be plausible as the main language of a colonized planet. The settlers  on Incognita were not of the sort to take along dictionaries of the  lesser-known tongues, so the computers at Russett had a fairly wide  choice.    We had to take a hypnocourse in that language. Ditto the script, one  of several forgotten phonetic shorthands. (Designed to enable the  tongues of Aliens to be written down; but the Aliens have never been  met. It is plausible enough that some colony might have kept the  script alive; after all Thasia uses something of the sort to this  day.)    The final result of our work looks pretty small. Twenty-three  \"Personal Background Sets\"--a few letters, a diary in some, an  assortment of artifacts. Whoever stocked this ship we are on supplied  wood, of the half-dozen kinds that have been taken wherever men have  gone; stocks of a few plastics--known at the time of the Exodus, or  easily developed from those known, and not associated with any  particular planet. Also books on Design, a Form-writer for translating  drawings into materials, and so on. Someone put in a lot of work  before this voyage began.    Most of the time it is like being back on Russet doing a group  Project. What we are working on has no more and no less reality than  that. Our work is all read into a computer and checked against  everybody else's. At first we keep clashing. Gradually a consistent  picture builds up and gets translated finally into the Personal  Background Kits. The Lost Kafoozalum start to exist like people in a  History book.    Fifteen days hard work and we have just about finished; then we  reach--call it Planet Gilgamesh.    I wake in my bunk to hear that there will be brief cessation of  weight; strap down, please.    We are coming off Mass-Time to go on planetary drive.    Colonel Delano-Smith is in charge of operations on the planet, with  Ram and Peter to assist. None of the rest of us see the melting out of  fifty years' accumulation of ice, the pumping away of the water, the  fitting and testing of the holds for the grappling-beams. We stay  inside the ship, on five-eighths gee which we do not have time to get  used to, and try to work, and discard the results before the computer  can do so. There is hardly any work left to do, anyway.    It takes nearly twelve hours to get the ship free, and caulked, and  ready to lift. (Her hull has to be patched because of Mr. Yardo's  operations which make use of several sorts of vapors). Then there is a  queer blind period with Up now one way, now another, and sudden jerks  and tugs that upset everything not in gimbals or tied down;  interspersed with periods when weightlessness supervenes with no  warning at all. After an hour or two of this it would be hard to say  whether Mental or physical discomfort is more acute; B consulted,  however, says my autonomic system must be quite something, after five  minutes _her_ thoughts were with her viscera entirely.    Then, suddenly, we are back on Mass-Time again.    Two days to go.           *       *       *       *       *    At first being on Mass-Time makes everything seem normal again. By  sleep time there is a strain, and next day it is everywhere. I know as  well as any that on Mass-Time the greater the mass the faster the  shift; all the same I cannot help feeling we are being slowed, dragged  back by the dead ship coupled to our live one.    When you stand by the hull _Gilgamesh_ is only ten feet away.    I should have kept something to work on like B and Kirsty who have not  done their Letters for Home in Case of Accidents; mine is signed and  sealed long ago. I am making a good start on a Neurosis when  Delano-Smith announces a Meeting for one hour ahead.    Hurrah! now there is a time-mark fixed I think of all sorts of things  I should have done before; for instance taking a look at the controls  of the Hoppers.    I have been in one of them half an hour and figured out most of the  dials--Up down and sideways are controlled much as in a helicar, but  here a big viewscreen has been hooked in to the autopilot--when  across the hold I see the air lock start to move.    _Gilgamesh_ is on the other side.    It takes forever to open. When at last it swings wide on the dark  tunnel what comes through is a storage rack, empty, floating on  antigrav.    What follows is a figure in a spacesuit; modern type, but the windows  of the hopper are semipolarized and I cannot make out the face inside  the bubble top.    He slings the rack upon the bulkhead, takes off the helmet and hangs  that up, too. Then he just stands. I am beginning to muster enough  sense to wonder why when he comes slowly across the hold.    Reaching the doorway he says: \"Oh it's you, Lizzie. You'll have to  help me out of this. I'm stuck.\"    M'Clare.    The outside of the suit is still freezing cold; maybe this is what has  jammed the fastening. After a few minutes tugging it suddenly gives  away. M'Clare climbs out of the suit, leaving it standing, and says,  \"Help me count these, will you?\"    _These_ are a series of transparent containers from a pouch slung at  one side of the suit. I recognize them as the envelopes in which we  put what are referred to as Personal Background Sets.    I say, \"There ought to be twenty-three.\"    \"No,\" says M'Clare dreamily, \"twenty-two, we're saving one of them.\"    \"What on earth is the use of an extra set of faked documents and  oddments--\"    He seems to wake up suddenly and says: \"What are you doing here,  Lizzie?\"    I explain and he wanders over to the hopper and starts to explain the  controls.    There is something odd about all this. M'Clare is obviously dead  tired, but kind of relaxed; seeing that the hour of Danger is only  thirty-six hours off I don't understand it. Probably several of his  students are going to have to risk their lives--    I am on the point of seeing something important when the speaker  announces in the colonel's voice that Professor M'Clare and Miss Lee  will report to the Conference Room at once please.    M'Clare looks at me and grins. \"Come along, Lizzie. Here's where we  take orders for once, you and I.\"    It is the colonel's Hour. I suppose that having to work with  Undergraduates is something he could never quite forget, but from the way  he looks at us we might almost be Space Force personnel,--low-grade of  course but respectable.    Everything is at last worked out and he has it on paper in front of  him; he puts the paper four square on the table, gazes into the middle  distance and proceeds to recite.    \"One. This ship will go off Mass-Time on 2nd August at 11.27 hours  ship's time....    \"Thirty-six hours from now.    \"...

Nearly all these diverse elements of the Pennsylvania population were  decidedly sectional in character. The Welsh had a language of their own,  and they attempted, though without success, to maintain it, as well as  a government of their own within their barony independent of the regular  government of the province. The Germans were also extremely sectional.  They clung with better success to their own language, customs, and  literature. The Scotch-Irish were so clannish that they had ideas of  founding a separate province on the Susquehanna. Even the Church of  England people were so aloof and partisan that, though they lived about  Philadelphia among the Quakers, they were extremely hostile to the  Quaker rule and unremittingly strove to destroy it.    All these cleavages and divisions in the population continue in their  effects to this day. They prevented the development of a homogeneous  population. No exact statistics were taken of the numbers of the  different nationalities in colonial times; but Franklin's estimate is  probably fairly accurate, and his position in practical politics gave  him the means of knowing and of testing his calculations. About the year  1750 he estimated the population as one-third Quaker, one-third German,  and one-third miscellaneous. This gave about 50,000 or 60,000 to each of  the thirds. Provost Smith, of the newly founded college, estimated the  Quakers at only about 40,000. But his estimate seems too low. He was  interested in making out their numbers small because he was trying  to show the absurdity of allowing such a small band of fanatics and  heretics to rule a great province of the British Empire. One great  source of the Quaker power lay in the sympathy of the Germans, who  always voted on their side and kept them in control of the Legislature,  so that it was in reality a case of two-thirds ruling one-third. The  Quakers, it must be admitted, never lost their heads. Unperturbed  through all the conflicts and the jarring of races and sects, they held  their position unimpaired and kept the confidence and support of the  Germans until the Revolution changed everything.    The varied elements of population spread out in ever widening half  circles from Philadelphia as a center. There was nothing in the  character of the region to stop this progress. The country all the way  westward to the Susquehanna was easy hill, dale, and valley, covered  by a magnificent growth of large forest trees--oaks, beeches, poplars,  walnuts, hickories, and ash--which rewarded the labor of felling by  exposing to cultivation a most fruitful soil.    The settlers followed the old Indian trails. The first westward  pioneers seem to have been the Welsh Quakers, who pushed due west from  Philadelphia and marked out the course of the famous Lancaster Road,  afterwards the Lancaster Turnpike. It took the line of least resistance  along the old trail, following ridges until it reached the Susquehanna  at a spot where an Indian trader, named Harris, established himself and  founded a post which subsequently became Harrisburg, the capital of the  State.    For a hundred years the Lancaster Road was the great highway westward,  at first to the mountains, then to the Ohio, and finally to the  Mississippi Valley and the Great West. Immigrants and pioneers from all  the New England and Middle States flocked out that way to the land of  promise in wagons, or horseback, or trudging along on foot. Substantial  taverns grew up along the route; and habitual freighters and stage  drivers, proud of their fine teams of horses, grew into characters of  the road. When the Pennsylvania Railroad was built, it followed the same  line. In fact, most of the lines of railroad in the State follow Indian  trails. The trails for trade and tribal intercourse led east and west.  The warrior trails usually led north and south, for that had long been  the line of strategy and conquest of the tribes. The northern tribes,  or Six Nations, established in the lake region of New York near the  headwaters of the Delaware, the Susquehanna, and the Ohio, had the  advantage of these river valleys for descending into the whole Atlantic  seaboard and the valley of the Mississippi. They had in consequence  conquered all the tribes south of them as far even as the Carolinas and  Georgia. All their trails of conquest led across Pennsylvania.    The Germans in their expansion at first seem to have followed up the  Schuylkill Valley and its tributaries, and they hold this region to the  present day. Gradually they crossed the watershed to the Susquehanna and  broke into the region of the famous limestone soil in Lancaster County,  a veritable farmer's paradise from which nothing will ever drive them.  Many Quaker farmers penetrated north and northeast from Philadelphia  into Bucks County, a fine rolling and hilly wheat and corn region,  where their descendants are still found and whence not a few well-known  Philadelphia families have come.    The Quaker government of Pennsylvania in almost a century of its  existence largely fulfilled its ideals. It did not succeed in governing  without war; but the war was not its fault. It did succeed in governing  without oaths. An affirmation instead of an oath became the law of  Pennsylvania for all who chose an affirmation; and this law was soon  adopted by most American communities. It succeeded in establishing  religious liberty in Pennsylvania in the fullest sense of the word. It  brought Christianity nearer to its original simplicity and made it less  superstitious and cruel.    The Quakers had always maintained that it was a mistake to suppose that  their ideas would interfere with material prosperity and happiness;  and they certainly proved their contention in Pennsylvania. To Quaker  liberalism was due not merely the material prosperity, but prison reform  and the notable public charities of Pennsylvania; in both of which  activities, as in the abolition of slavery, the Quakers were leaders.  Original research in science also flourished in a marked degree in  colonial Pennsylvania. No one in those days knew the nature of thunder  and lightning, and the old explanation that they were the voice of an  angry God was for many a sufficient explanation. Franklin, by a long  series of experiments in the free Quaker colony, finally proved in 1752  that lightning was electricity, that is to say, a manifestation of  the same force that is produced when glass is rubbed with buckskin. He  invented the lightning rod, discovered the phenomenon of positive and  negative electricity, explained the action of the Leyden jar, and was  the first American writer on the modern science of political economy.  This energetic citizen of Pennsylvania spent a large part of his life  in research; he studied the Gulf Stream, storms and their causes,  waterspouts, whirlwinds; and he established the fact that the northeast  storms of the Atlantic coast usually move against the wind.    But Franklin was not the only scientist in the colony. Besides his three  friends, Kinnersley, Hopkinson, and Syng, who worked with him and helped  him in his discoveries, there were David Rittenhouse, the astronomer,  John Bartram, the botanist, and a host of others. Rittenhouse excelled  in every undertaking which required the practical application of  astronomy, He attracted attention even in Europe for his orrery which  indicated the movements of the stars and which was an advance on all  previous instruments of the kind. When astronomers in Europe were  seeking to have the transit of Venus of 1769 observed in different parts  of the world, Pennsylvania alone of the American colonies seems to  have had the man and the apparatus necessary for the work. Rittenhouse  conducted the observations at three points and won a world-wide  reputation by the accuracy and skill of his observations. The whole  community was interested in this scientific undertaking; the Legislature  and public institutions raised the necessary funds; and the American  Philosophical Society, the only organization of its kind in the  colonies, had charge of the preparations.    The American Philosophical Society had been started in Philadelphia in  1743. It was the first scientific society to be founded in America, and  throughout the colonial period it was the only society of its kind in  the country. Its membership included not only prominent men throughout  America, such as Thomas Jefferson, who were interested in scientific  inquiry, but also representatives of foreign nations. With its library  of rare and valuable collections and its annual publication of essays on  almost every branch of science, the society still continues its useful  scientific work.    John Bartram, who was the first botanist to describe the plants of the  New World and who explored the whole country from the Great Lakes to  Florida, was a Pennsylvania Quaker of colonial times, farmer born and  bred. Thomas Godfrey, also a colonial Pennsylvanian, was rewarded by  the Royal Society of England for an improvement which he made in  the quadrant. Peter Collinson of England, a famous naturalist and  antiquarian of early times, was a Quaker. In modern times John Dalton,  the discoverer of the atomic theory of colorblindness, was born of  Quaker parents, and Edward Cope, of a well-known Philadelphia Quaker  family, became one of the most eminent naturalists and paleontologists  of the nineteenth century, and unaided discovered over a third of the  three thousand extinct species of vertebrates recognized by men of  science. In the field of education, Lindley Murray, the grammarian of  a hundred years ago, was a Quaker. Ezra Cornell, a Quaker, founded the  great university in New York which bears his name; and Johns Hopkins,  also a Quaker, founded the university of that name in Baltimore."]]]
