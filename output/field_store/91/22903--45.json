At station E-5 upstream from  E-4, however, _N. volucellus_ was taken but _N. buchanani_ was not  found.    In the upper Neosho basin, Cross (1954a:310) took _N. volucellus_ but  not _N. buchanani_. Other collections have shown _N. buchanani_ to be  abundant in the lower Neosho River in Kansas. Moore and Paden (1950:85)  observe that _N. buchanani_ was found only near the mouth of the  Illinois River in Oklahoma and was sharply segregated ecologically from  _N. volucellus_ that occupied a niche in the clear main channels in  contrast to the more sluggish waters inhabited by _N. buchanani_.      #Notropis camurus# (Jordan and Meek): Stations C-3, C-4, C-5, C-6, C-7,  C-8, C-9, C-10, C-11, C-12, C-13, E-1, E-5 (C-131).    Highest concentrations of the bluntface shiner were found close to the  mouths of two tributaries of Big Caney River: Rock Creek and Otter  Creek. On Rock Creek (Station C-4) this shiner was abundant in a shallow  pool below a riffle where water was flowing rapidly. Many large males in  breeding condition were taken (June 3). The species formed 20.2 per cent  of the fish taken.    On Otter Creek (Station C-13) the species was common in shallow bedrock  pools below riffles. It formed 12.1 per cent of the fish taken.    At station C-5, _N. camurus_ was characteristically found in an area of  shallow pools and riffles. At station C-10 it was found in clear flowing  water over rubble bottom and in small coves over mud bottom. At C-11  (July 26) _N. camurus_ was taken only in one small pool with rapidly  flowing water below a riffle. In this pool _N. camurus_ was the dominant  fish. At station C-12, on April 2, _N. camurus_ was abundant in the  stream, which was then clear and flowing. On August 24, it was not taken  from the same pool, which was then turbid and drying.    The frequent occurrence of this species in clear, flowing water seems  significant. Cross (1954a:309) notes that the bluntface shiner prefers  moderately fast, clear water. Hall (1952:57) found _N. camurus_ only in  upland tributaries east of Grand River and not in lowland tributaries  west of the river. Moore and Buck (1953:22) took this species in the  Chikaskia River, which was at that time a clear, flowing stream. They  noted that in Oklahoma it seems to be found only in relatively clear  water.    _N. camurus_ did not seem to ascend the smaller tributaries of Big Caney  River as did _N. rubellus_ and _N. boops_ even when these tributaries  were flowing.      #Notropis deliciosus missuriensis# (Cope): Stations A-1, A-2, A-3, W-1,  W-2, W-3 (C-136).    Sand shiners seemed to be abundant in the Arkansas River, rare in the  Walnut River and absent from other streams surveyed. This shiner was  most abundant in shallow, flowing water in the Arkansas River; in  backwaters, where _Gambusia affinis_ prevailed, _N. deliciosus_ formed  only a small percentage of the fish population.      #Notropis girardi# Hubbs and Ortenburger: Stations A-2 and A-3.    At station A-2 the Arkansas River shiner made up 14.6 per cent of all  fish taken. At A-2, it was found only in rapidly-flowing water over  clean sand in the main channels. It was absent from the shallow,  slowly-flowing water where _N. deliciosus missuriensis_ was abundant. At  A-3 _N. girardi_ made up 22 per cent of the total catch, and again  preferred the deeper, faster water over clean-swept sand. Failure to  find _N. girardi_ at station A-1 is not understood.    Females were gravid in both collections (August 25 and 27). In neither  collection were young-of-the-year taken. Moore (1944:210) has suggested  that _N. girardi_ requires periods of high water and turbidity to spawn.  Additional collecting was done at station A-3 on December 22, 1957. A  few adults were taken in flowing water but no young were found.    In this area, _N. girardi_ showed no tendency to ascend tributaries of  the Arkansas River. Not far to the west, however, this pattern changes  as shown by Hubbs and Ortenburger (1929a:32) who took this fish at seven  of ten stations on the Cimarron, Canadian, and Salt Fork of the  Arkansas. _N. girardi_ was taken only in the lowermost stations on both  Stillwater Creek (Cross, 1950:136) and the Chikaskia River (Moore and  Buck, 1953:22). In the next major stream west of the Chikaskia, the  Medicine River, _N. girardi_ seems to occur farther upstream than in the  Chikaskia. (Collection C-5-51 by Dr. A. B. Leonard and Dr. Frank B.  Cross on Elm Creek near Medicine Lodge on July 20, 1951.)      #Notropis lutrensis# (Baird and Girard): Stations A-1, A-2, W-1, W-2,  W-3, W-4, G-1, G-2, G-4, G-5, G-8, G-9, G-10, G-11, G-12, G-13, G-14,  G-15, G-16, B-1, B-2, B-3, C-1, C-2, C-3, C-4, C-5, C-6, C-9, C-10,  C-11, C-12, C-13, C-14, M-1, E-1, E-2, E-4, E-7 (E&F, C-131, C-133,  C-136).    The red shiner was taken in every stream surveyed. The relative  abundance seemed to be greatest in two types of habitat which were  separated geographically. The first habitat was in large rivers such as  the Arkansas and Walnut. In the Arkansas River the red shiner  consistently made up 20 per cent to 25 per cent of the catch. On the  Walnut River percentages ranged from 10 per cent (station W-3) to 45 per  cent (station W-2).    The second habitat in which numbers of _N. lutrensis_ reached high  proportions was in the upper parts of the most intermittent tributaries.  At the uppermost station in Silver Creek this species formed 30 per cent  of the fish taken. In Crab Creek the following percentages were taken in  six collections from mouth to source: 20.6%, 26.1%, 25%, 85%, 14.6%, and  1%. In the mainstream of Grouse Creek the highest percentage taken was  19.27 near the mouth at station G-1. In middle sections of Grouse Creek  this species was either absent or made up less than 2 per cent of the  fish taken.    At no station on Big Caney River was the red shiner abundant. The  smallest relative numbers were found at upstream stations, in contrast  to collections made on tributaries of Grouse Creek. This distributional  pattern possibly may be explained by the severe conditions under which  fish have been forced to live in the upper tributaries of Grouse Creek.  Water was more turbid, and pools were smaller than in Big Caney. These  factors possibly decimate numbers of the less hardy species permitting  expansion by more adaptable species, among which seems to be _N.  lutrensis_. In the upper tributaries of Big Caney River conditions have  not been so severe due to greater flow from springs and less cultivation  of the watershed in most places. Under such conditions _N. lutrensis_  seems to remain a minor faunal constituent.      #Notropis percobromus# (Cope): Stations A-1, A-2, W-1, W-2, W-3, G-1.    At station W-1 the plains shiner constituted 20 per cent of the fish  taken. The river was flowing rapidly with large volume at the time of  this collection, and all specimens were taken near the bank in  comparatively quiet water over gravel bottom. At station W-3, below  Tunnel Mill Dam at Winfield, _N. percobromus_ comprised 18.7 per cent of  the fish taken, second only to _Lepomis humilis_ in relative abundance.  Immediately below the west end of the dam, plains shiners were so  concentrated that fifty or more were taken in one haul of a four-foot  nylon net. The amount of water overflowing the dam at this point was  slight. Water was shallow (8-12 inches) and the bottom consisted of the  pitted apron or of fine gravel. At the east end of the dam where water  was deeper (1-3 feet) and the flow over the dam greater, large numbers  of _Lepomis humilis_ were taken while _N. percobromus_ was rare.    In the Arkansas River smaller relative numbers of this shiner were  obtained. At station A-2, it formed 4.68 per cent of the total. At this  station _N. percobromus_ was taken with _N. lutrensis_ in water about 18  inches deep next to a bank where the current was sluggish and tangled  roots and detritus offered some shelter.    At station G-1 on Grouse Creek the plains shiner made up 7.68 per cent  of the fish taken. The habitat consisted of intermittent pools with  rubble bottoms at this station, which was four miles upstream from the  mouth of the creek. The plains shiner seems rarely to ascend the upland  streams of the area.      #Notropis rubellus# (Agassiz): Stations C-3, C-5, C-6, C-7, C-8, C-10,  C-11, C-12, C-13, C-14 (J&J).    No fish in these collections showed a more persistent preference than  _Notropis rubellus_ for clear, cool streams. All collections of the  rosyface shiner were in the Big Caney River system, but at only four  stations in this system was it common. At station C-11 the highest  relative numbers (10.6 per cent) were obtained. This site possessed the  most limpid water of any station on the mainstream of Big Caney. Aquatic  plants (_Myriophyllum heterophyllum_ and _Potamogeton nodosus_) were  common. Other fishes that flourished at this station were _N. boops_,  _N. camurus_, _Campostoma anomalum_, and _Etheostoma spectabile_. The  water temperature was 86 deg. at surface and 80 deg. at bottom whereas air  temperature was 97 deg..    _N. rubellus_ was common at all stations in Otter Creek, the clear,  upland character of which has been discussed. In May and June only  adults were found. On September 1, examination of several pools in upper  Otter Creek revealed numerous young-of-the-year in small spring-fed  pools.    Literature is scarce concerning this shiner in Kansas. Cross (1954a:308)  stated that it was abundant in the South Fork of the Cottonwood River  and was one of those fishes primarily associated with the Ozarkian  fauna, rather than with the fauna of the plains. Elliott (1947) found  _N. rubellus_ in Spring Creek, a tributary of Fall River which seems  similar to Otter Creek in physical"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3457"],[0,"The Man of the Forest (#7)"],[1,"surprise.    \"Apache country, miss,\" he said. \"I reckon I'm sorry. Thet's shore no  place for you-all... Beggin' your pawdin--you ain't Mormons?\"    \"No. We're nieces of Al Auchincloss,\" rejoined Helen.    \"Wal, you don't say! I've been down Magdalena way an' heerd of Al....  Reckon you're goin' a-visitin'?\"    \"It's to be home for us.\"    \"Shore thet's fine. The West needs girls.... Yes, I've heerd of Al.  An old Arizona cattle-man in a sheep country! Thet's bad.... Now I'm  wonderin'--if I'd drift down there an' ask him for a job ridin' for  him--would I get it?\"    His lazy smile was infectious and his meaning was as clear as crystal  water. The gaze he bent upon Bo somehow pleased Helen. The last year or  two, since Bo had grown prettier all the time, she had been a magnet for  admiring glances. This one of the cowboy's inspired respect and liking,  as well as amusement. It certainly was not lost upon Bo.    \"My uncle once said in a letter that he never had enough men to run his  ranch,\" replied Helen, smiling.    \"Shore I'll go. I reckon I'd jest naturally drift that way--now.\"    He seemed so laconic, so easy, so nice, that he could not have been  taken seriously, yet Helen's quick perceptions registered a daring, a  something that was both sudden and inevitable in him. His last word was  as clear as the soft look he fixed upon Bo.    Helen had a mischievous trait, which, subdue it as she would,  occasionally cropped out; and Bo, who once in her wilful life had been  rendered speechless, offered such a temptation.    \"Maybe my little sister will put in a good word for you--to Uncle Al,\"  said Helen. Just then the train jerked, and started slowly. The cowboy  took two long strides beside the car, his heated boyish face almost on a  level with the window, his eyes, now shy and a little wistful, yet bold,  too, fixed upon Bo.    \"Good-by--Sweetheart!\" he called.    He halted--was lost to view.    \"Well!\" ejaculated Helen, contritely, half sorry, half amused. \"What a  sudden young gentleman!\"    Bo had blushed beautifully.    \"Nell, wasn't he glorious!\" she burst out, with eyes shining.    \"I'd hardly call him that, but he was--nice,\" replied Helen, much  relieved that Bo had apparently not taken offense at her.    It appeared plain that Bo resisted a frantic desire to look out of the  window and to wave her hand. But she only peeped out, manifestly to her  disappointment.    \"Do you think he--he'll come to Uncle Al's?\" asked Bo.    \"Child, he was only in fun.\"    \"Nell, I'll bet you he comes. Oh, it'd be great! I'm going to love  cowboys. They don't look like that Harve Riggs who ran after you so.\"    Helen sighed, partly because of the reminder of her odious suitor, and  partly because Bo's future already called mysteriously to the child.  Helen had to be at once a mother and a protector to a girl of intense  and wilful spirit.    One of the trainmen directed the girls' attention to a green, sloping  mountain rising to a bold, blunt bluff of bare rock; and, calling  it Starvation Peak, he told a story of how Indians had once driven  Spaniards up there and starved them. Bo was intensely interested, and  thereafter she watched more keenly than ever, and always had a question  for a passing trainman. The adobe houses of the Mexicans pleased her,  and, then the train got out into Indian country, where pueblos appeared  near the track and Indians with their bright colors and shaggy wild  mustangs--then she was enraptured.    \"But these Indians are peaceful!\" she exclaimed once, regretfully.    \"Gracious, child! You don't want to see hostile Indians, do you?\"  queried Helen.    \"I do, you bet,\" was the frank rejoinder.    \"Well, I'LL bet that I'll be sorry I didn't leave you with mother.\"    \"Nell--you never will!\"      They reached Albuquerque about noon, and this important station, where  they had to change trains, had been the first dreaded anticipation of  the journey. It certainly was a busy place--full of jabbering Mexicans,  stalking, red-faced, wicked-looking cowboys, lolling Indians. In the  confusion Helen would have been hard put to it to preserve calmness,  with Bo to watch, and all that baggage to carry, and the other train to  find; but the kindly brakeman who had been attentive to them now helped  them off the train into the other--a service for which Helen was very  grateful.    \"Albuquerque's a hard place,\" confided the trainman. \"Better stay in the  car--and don't hang out the windows.... Good luck to you!\"    Only a few passengers were in the car and they were Mexicans at the  forward end. This branch train consisted of one passenger-coach, with a  baggage-car, attached to a string of freight-cars. Helen told herself,  somewhat grimly, that soon she would know surely whether or not her  suspicions of Harve Riggs had warrant. If he was going on to Magdalena  on that day he must go in this coach. Presently Bo, who was not obeying  admonitions, drew her head out of the window. Her eyes were wide in  amaze, her mouth open.    \"Nell! I saw that man Riggs!\" she whispered. \"He's going to get on this  train.\"    \"Bo, I saw him yesterday,\" replied Helen, soberly.    \"He's followed you--the--the--\"    \"Now, Bo, don't get excited,\" remonstrated Helen. \"We've left home now.  We've got to take things as they come. Never mind if Riggs has followed  me. I'll settle him.\"    \"Oh! Then you won't speak--have anything to do with him?\"    \"I won't if I can help it.\"    Other passengers boarded the train, dusty, uncouth, ragged men, and  some hard-featured, poorly clad women, marked by toil, and several more  Mexicans. With bustle and loud talk they found their several seats.    Then Helen saw Harve Riggs enter, burdened with much luggage. He was a  man of about medium height, of dark, flashy appearance, cultivating long  black mustache and hair. His apparel was striking, as it consisted of  black frock-coat, black trousers stuffed in high, fancy-topped boots,  an embroidered vest, and flowing tie, and a black sombrero. His belt and  gun were prominent. It was significant that he excited comment among the  other passengers.    When he had deposited his pieces of baggage he seemed to square himself,  and, turning abruptly, approached the seat occupied by the girls. When  he reached it he sat down upon the arm of the one opposite, took off  his sombrero, and deliberately looked at Helen. His eyes were light,  glinting, with hard, restless quiver, and his mouth was coarse and  arrogant. Helen had never seen him detached from her home surroundings,  and now the difference struck cold upon her heart.    \"Hello, Nell!\" he said. \"Surprised to see me?\"    \"No,\" she replied, coldly.    \"I'll gamble you are.\"    \"Harve Riggs, I told you the day before I left home that nothing you  could do or say mattered to me.\"    \"Reckon that ain't so, Nell. Any woman I keep track of has reason to  think. An' you know it.\"    \"Then you followed me--out here?\" demanded Helen, and her voice, despite  her control, quivered with anger.    \"I sure did,\" he replied, and there was as much thought of himself in  the act as there was of her.    \"Why? Why? It's useless--hopeless.\"    \"I swore I'd have you, or nobody else would,\" he replied, and here, in  the passion of his voice there sounded egotism rather than hunger for  a woman's love. \"But I reckon I'd have struck West anyhow, sooner or  later.\"    \"You're not going to--all the way--to Pine?\" faltered Helen, momentarily  weakening.    \"Nell, I'll camp on your trail from now on,\" he declared.    Then Bo sat bolt-upright, with pale face and flashing eyes.    \"Harve Riggs, you leave Nell alone,\" she burst out, in ringing, brave  young voice. \"I'll tell you what--I'll bet--if you follow her and  nag her any more, my uncle Al or some cowboy will run you out of the  country.\"    \"Hello, Pepper!\" replied Riggs, coolly. \"I see your manners haven't  improved an' you're still wild about cowboys.\"    \"People don't have good manners with--with--\"    \"Bo, hush!\" admonished Helen. It was difficult to reprove Bo just then,  for that young lady had not the slightest fear of Riggs. Indeed, she  looked as if she could slap his face. And Helen realized that however  her intelligence had grasped the possibilities of leaving home for a  wild country, and whatever her determination to be brave, the actual  beginning of self-reliance had left her spirit weak. She would rise  out of that. But just now this flashing-eyed little sister seemed a  protector. Bo would readily adapt herself to the West, Helen thought,  because she was so young, primitive, elemental.    Whereupon Bo turned her back to Riggs and looked out of the window. The  man laughed. Then he stood up and leaned over Helen.    \"Nell, I'm goin' wherever you go,\" he said, steadily. \"You can take that  friendly or not, just as it pleases you. But if you've got any sense  you'll not give these people out here a hunch against me. I might hurt  somebody.... An' wouldn't it be better--to act friends? For I'm goin' to  look after you, whether you like it or not.\"    Helen had considered this man an annoyance, and later a menace, and now  she must declare open enmity with him. However disgusting the idea that  he considered himself a factor in her new life, it was the truth. He  existed, he had control over his movements. She could not change that.  She hated the need of thinking so much about him; and suddenly, with a  hot, bursting anger, she hated the man.    \"You'll not look after me. I'll take care of myself,\" she said, and  she turned her back upon him. She heard him mutter under his breath and  slowly move away down the car. Then Bo slipped a hand in hers.    \"Never mind, Nell,\" she whispered. \"You know what old Sheriff Haines  said about Harve Riggs. 'A four-flush would-be gun-fighter! If he ever  strikes a real Western town he'll get run out of it.' I just wish my  red-faced cowboy had got on this train!\"    Helen felt a rush of gladness that she"]]]
