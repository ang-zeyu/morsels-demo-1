Commercial intercourse with all,  but political ties with none.\" But a more pressing issue on which the  public wished information was that furnished by the Alien and Sedition  laws, which Marshall had originally criticized on grounds both of  expediency and of constitutionality. Now, however, he defended these  measures on constitutional grounds, taking the latitudinarian position  that \"powers necessary for the attainment of all objects which are  general in their nature, which interest all America,... would be  naturally vested in the Government of the whole,\" but he declared  himself strongly opposed to their renewal. At the same time he denounced  the Virginia Resolutions as calculated \"to sap the foundations of our  Union.\"    The election was held late in April, under conditions which must have  added greatly to popular interest. Following the custom in Virginia, the  voter, instead of casting a ballot, merely declared his preference  in the presence of the candidates, the election officials, and the  assembled multitude. In the intensity of the struggle no voter, halt,  lame, or blind, was overlooked; and a barrel of whisky near at hand lent  further zest to the occasion. Time and again the vote in the district  was a tie, and as a result frequent personal encounters took place  between aroused partisans. Marshall's election by a narrow majority in a  borough which was strongly pro-Jeffersonian was due, indeed, not to his  principles but to his personal popularity and to the support which he  received from Patrick Henry, the former Governor of the State.    The most notable event of his brief stay in Congress was his successful  defense of President Adams's action in handing over to the British  authorities, in conformity with the twenty-seventh article of the Jay  treaty, Jonathan Robins, who was alleged to be a fugitive from justice.  Adams's critics charged him with having usurped a judicial function.  \"The President,\" said Marshall in reply, \"is sole organ of the nation  in its external relations, and its sole representative with foreign  nations. Of consequence, the demand of a foreign nation can only be made  on him. He possesses the whole executive power. He holds and directs  the force of the nation. Of consequence, any act to be performed by the  force of the nation is to be performed through him. He is charged to  execute the laws. A treaty is declared to be a law. He must then execute  a treaty where he, and he alone, possesses the means of executing it.\"  This is one of the few speeches ever uttered on the floor of Congress  which demonstrably made votes. Gallatin, who had been set to answer  Marshall, threw up his brief; and the resolutions against the President  were defeated by a House hostile to him.    Marshall's course in Congress was characterized throughout by  independence of character, moderation of views, and level good sense,  of which his various congressional activities afford abundant evidence.  Though he had himself been one of the \"X.Y.Z.\" mission, Marshall now  warmly supported Adams's policy of renewing diplomatic relations with  France. He took his political life in his hands to register a vote  against the Sedition Act, a proposal to repeal which was brought before  the House. He foiled a scheme which his party associates had devised,  in view of the approaching presidential election, to transfer to a  congressional committee the final authority in canvassing the electoral  vote--a plan all too likely to precipitate civil war. His Federalist  brethren of the extreme Hamiltonian type quite resented the frequency  with which he was wont to kick over the party traces. \"He is disposed,\"  wrote Sedgwick, the Speaker, \"to express great respect for the sovereign  people and to quote their opinions as an evidence of truth,\" which \"is  of all things the most destructive of personal independence and of that  weight of character which a great man ought to possess.\" *       * Letter from Sedgwick to King, May 11, 1800. \"Life and  Correspondence of Rufus King,\" vol. III, pp. 236-7.      Marshall had now come to be practically indispensable to the isolated  President, at whose most earnest insistence he entered the Cabinet  as Secretary of State, though he had previously declined to become  Secretary of War. The presidential campaign was the engrossing interest  of the year, and as it spread its \"havoc of virulence\" throughout the  country, Federalists of both factions seemed to turn to Marshall in the  hope that, by some miracle of conciliation, he could save the day. The  hope proved groundless, however, and all that was ultimately left the  party which had founded the Government was to choose a President from  the rival leaders of the opposition. Of these Marshall preferred Burr,  because, as he explained, he knew Jefferson's principles better. Besides  having foreign prejudices, Mr. Jefferson, he continued, \"appears to me  to be a man who will embody himself with the House of Representatives,  and by weakening the office of President, he will increase his personal  power.\" Better political prophecy has, indeed, rarely been penned.  Deferring nevertheless to Hamilton's insistence--and, as events were to  prove, to his superior wisdom--Marshall kept aloof from the fight in the  House, and his implacable foe was elected.    Marshall was already one of the eminent men of the country when Adams,  without consulting him, nominated him for Chief Justice. He stood at the  head of the Virginia bar; he was the most generally trusted leader of  his party; he already had a national reputation as an interpreter of  the Constitution. Yet his appointment as Chief Justice aroused criticism  even among his party friends. Their doubt did not touch his intellectual  attainments, but in their opinion his political moderation, his  essential democracy, his personal amiability, all counted against him.  \"He is,\" wrote Sedgwick, \"a man of very affectionate disposition,  of great simplicity of manners, and honest and honorable in all his  conduct. He is attached to pleasures, with convivial habits strongly  fixed. He is indolent therefore. He has a strong attachment to  popularity but is indisposed to sacrifice to it his integrity; hence he  is disposed on all popular subjects to feel the public pulse, and hence  results indecision and AN EXPRESSION of doubt.\" *       * Op. cit.      It was perhaps fortunate for the Federal Judiciary, of which he was now  to take command, that John Marshall was on occasion \"disposed... to feel  the public pulse.\" A headstrong pilot might speedily have dashed his  craft on the rocks; a timid, one would have abandoned his course; but  Marshall did neither. The better answer to Sedgwick's fears was given in  1805 when John Randolph declared that Marshall's \"real worth was never  known until he was appointed Chief Justice.\" And Sedgwick is further  confuted by the portraits of the Chief Justice, which, with all their  diversity, are in accord on that stubborn chin, that firm placid mouth,  that steady, benignant gaze, so capable of putting attorneys out of  countenance when they had to face it overlong. Here are the lineaments  of self-confidence unmarred by vanity, of dignity without condescension,  of tenacity untouched by fanaticism, and above all, of an easy  conscience and unruffled serenity. It required the lodestone of a great  and thoroughly congenial responsibility to bring to light Marshall's  real metal.        CHAPTER III. Jefferson's War On The Judiciary    By a singular coincidence Marshall took his seat as Chief Justice at the  opening of the first term of Court in Washington, the new capital, on  Wednesday, February 4, 1801. The most beautiful of capital cities was  then little more than a swamp, athwart which ran a streak of mire named  by solemn congressional enactment \"Pennsylvania Avenue.\" At one end of  this difficult thoroughfare stood the President's mansion--still in  the hands of the builders but already sagging and leaking through the  shrinkage of the green timber they had used--two or three partially  constructed office-buildings, and a few private edifices and boarding  houses. Marshall never removed his residence to Washington but occupied  chambers in one or other of these buildings, in company with some of  the associate justices. This arrangement was practicable owing to the  brevity of the judicial term, which usually lasted little more than six  weeks, and was almost necessitated by the unhealthful climate of  the place. It may be conjectured that the life of John Marshall was  prolonged for some years by the Act of 1802, which abolished the August  term of court, for in the late summer and early autumn the place swarmed  with mosquitoes and reeked with malaria.    The Capitol, which stood at the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue, was in  1801 even less near completion than the President's house; at this time  the south wing rose scarcely twenty feet above its foundations. In  the north wing, which was nearer completion, in a basement chamber,  approached by a small hall opening on the eastern side of the Capitol  and flanked by pillars carved to represent bundles of cornstalks with  ears half opened at the top, Marshall held court for more than a third  of a century and elaborated his great principles of constitutional law.  This room, untouched by British vandalism in the invasion of 1814,  was christened by the witty malignity of John Randolph, \"the cave of  Trophonius.\" *       * It should, however, be noted in the interest of accuracy, that  the Court does not seem to have occupied its basement chamber during the  years 1814 to 1818, while the Capitol was under repair.      It was in the Senate Chamber in this same north wing that Marshall  administered the oath of office to Jefferson just one month after he  himself had taken office.

Dick had by this time become a good shot, and the buck at  which he aimed fell dead in its tracks.  Tom was not much of a shot, but  he had fired into the thick of the deer and gave a shout of delight at  seeing one of them fall.  The rest of the herd dashed off at full speed.  Tom ran, shouting, forward, but to his mortification the stag that he  had hit rose again to its feet and went off at a trot in the direction  taken by the others; a minute later the Kaffir boy was seen running  towards them at his full speed, leading the horses.    The two boys on his arrival leapt into their saddles and started in  pursuit of the wounded stag, which was still in sight, thinking at first  they could easily ride it down.  But the animal seemed rather to gain  than to lose strength, and, although they had considerably lessened the  start he had obtained of them, he still kept steadily on.  Active and  wiry as their horses were, they could not overtake it, and the boys had  at last the mortification of seeing that the stag was now gaining upon  them, and they presently drew rein, and their panting horses came to a  standstill.    \"What a horrid sell!\"  Tom Jackson exclaimed angrily.  \"I can't  understand his going like that after I fairly brought him down.\"    \"I expect,\" Dick said, \"that your bullet can only have grazed his skull;  it stunned him for the moment, but after he had once come to himself he  went on as briskly as usual.  If he had been hard hit we should  certainly have ridden him down.\"    \"Well, I suppose,\" Tom said more good-humouredly, \"there is nothing for  it but to ride back.\"    \"But which is our road?\"  Dick said in some dismay.  \"I am sure I have  no idea, and now that the sun is gone in there is nothing to steer by.\"    While they had been riding, the day had changed; the sky, which had for  weeks been bright and fine, was now overcast with heavy clouds.    \"We are in for a storm, I think,\" Dick went on, \"and it is coming on  fast.  I have not an idea which way to go, and I think our best plan  will be to halt.  Joel will track us, and the farther we go the longer  he will be in overtaking us.  There is the first drop!  The best thing  to do, Tom, will be to take off our saddles and tether our horses, and  then to wait.  This storm is a nuisance; in the first place we shall be  drenched, in the second it will wash out our tracks, and the darkness  will come so quickly that I am afraid Joel will not be able to trace us.  You see we do not know whether we have been riding straight or not; the  stag may have been running in a circle for anything we know, and as we  have been riding for something like two hours, we may be within five  miles of home or we may be five and twenty.\"    Scarcely had the boys got the saddles off and tethered their horses when  the rain came down in a sheet, accompanied by the most tremendous  thunder and the most vivid lightning Tom had ever seen.    \"This is awful, Dick,\" he said.    \"Yes,\" Dick agreed; \"thunderstorms here are frightful.  Houses are often  struck; but, lying down here in the open, there is not much fear.\"    For hours the storm continued unabated; the rain came down in a perfect  deluge.  The boys had put their saddles together and had covered these  with the horse-cloths so as to form a sort of tent, but they were  nevertheless soaked to the skin, and, to add to their discomfiture, the  horses had been so frightened by the blinding glare of the lightning  that they tugged at the ropes until, as the wet penetrated the ground,  the pegs became loosened, and they scoured away into the darkness.    After continuing for five hours the rain suddenly ceased.    \"What are we to do in the morning, Dick?\"    \"If it is fine it will be easy enough; we shall put our saddles on our  heads and walk eastward.  I have got a little pocket-compass which  father gave me in case I should at any time get lost, so we shall have  no difficulty in keeping our way, and sooner or later we must strike the  road running north to Newcastle.\"    They did not, however, wait till morning; so wet and chilled were they,  that they agreed they would rather walk than lie still.  Accordingly  they put the saddles on their heads as soon as the rain ceased and the  stars shone out, struck a light and looked at their compass, fixed on a  star to steer by, and then set out on their journey.    Fortunately, after two hours' walking, they struck the road at a point  some ten miles from the farm, and were home soon after daybreak, just as  their fathers were about to set out with a body of Kaffirs in search of  them.  Joel had returned late at night, having turned his face homeward  when it became too dark to follow the track; the horses had both come in  during the night.    CHAPTER FOUR.    THE OUTBREAK OF WAR.    As soon as the Jacksons' house was finished, they went into residence  there; but two or three times a week Dick and Tom managed to meet, one  or other being sure to find some excuse for riding over.    The Humphreys had arrived in Natal at the end of April, 1877, and by  November in the following year their farm presented a very different  appearance to that which it had worn on their arrival--sixteen months of  energetic labour, carried on by a considerable number of hands, will  effect wonders.  Possessing ample capital Mr Humphreys was able to keep  a strong gang of Kaffirs at work, and for some time had thirty men upon  the farm.  Thus the house which, when he took it, stood solitary and  lone in a bare plain, was now surrounded by 200 acres of young trees.  Of these, twenty acres were fruit-trees; the remainder, trees grown for  their wood.  These were planted thickly, as they would every year be  thinned out, and the young poles would fetch a good sum for fencing.  Although they had only been planted a few months, they were already  green and bright; they were protected from the cattle by a wire fence  encircling the whole.    The cattle had thriven and were doing well, and a large field of Indian  corn had been harvested for the use of the Kaffirs.  The cattle had  nearly doubled in numbers, as Mr Humphreys did not care about selling  at present.  The expenses of living were slight.  Meat, fowls, and eggs  were raised upon the farm, and the guns of Mr Humphreys and Dick  provided them with a plentiful supply of game.  Four milch cows were  kept in a paddock near the house, and supplied it with milk, butter, and  cheese.  Groceries and flour had alone to be purchased, and, as Mr  Humphreys said, he did not care if he did not sell a head of cattle for  the next ten years; but he would be obliged to do so before long, as the  farm would carry but a small number more than he already possessed, and  its available extent for that purpose would diminish every year, as the  planting went on.    Mr Humphreys was fortunate in having a small stream run through his  farm.  He erected a dam across a hollow, so that in winter a pond of two  or three acres in extent, and fifteen or sixteen feet deep, was formed,  affording an ample supply for the summer; this was of great utility to  him, as he was thereby enabled to continue his planting operations,  filling up each hole with water when the trees were put in, and then, as  this subsided, filling in the earth; by this means the young trees got a  good start, and seldom required watering afterwards.  He had a large  water-cart built for him; this was drawn by four oxen, and brought the  water to the point where the Kaffirs were engaged in planting.    Steers sufficient for two waggons had been broken in, and when these  were not employed in bringing up young trees and fencing from Newcastle  they worked upon the road between Newcastle and Pieter-Maritzburg, there  being a great demand for conveyance, as numbers of traders were going up  into the Transvaal and opening stores there.  Mr Jackson had also two  waggons engaged in the same work.  When trees and goods were wanted for  the farm, Dick went down with the waggons to see that these were  properly loaded, and that the young trees, which were often in leaf,  were taken out every night and set with the roots in water until the  morning.    One evening, early in October, Mr Jackson rode over with Tom.    \"I have heard,\" the former said to Mr Humphreys, \"that the government  have determined on moving the troops down to the Zulu frontier; the  attitude of Cetewayo is very threatening.\"    \"He is a troublesome neighbour,\" Mr Humphreys said.  \"They say that he  has 30,000 fighting-men, and in that case he ought to be able to overrun  both Natal and the Transvaal, for there is no doubt that Zulus fight  with great bravery.  As for the Dutch, I really can't blame the Zulus.  The Boers are always encroaching on their territory, and any  remonstrance is answered by a rifle-shot.  Had it not been for our  annexation of the Transvaal, Cetewayo would have overrun it and  exterminated the Dutch before now.  We have a strong force in the colony  just at present, and I think Sir Bartle Frere means to bring matters to  a crisis.  The existence of such an army of warlike savages on the  frontier is a standing threat to the very existence of the colony, and  the constitution of the army renders it almost a necessity that it  should fight.  All the men are soldiers, and as none are allowed to  marry until the regiment to which they belong has distinguished itself  in battle they are naturally always burning for war.  The  Pieter-Maritzburg paper says that it understands that Sir Bartle Frere  is about to send in an ultimatum, demanding--in addition to various  small matters, such as the punishing of raiders across the frontier--the  entire abandonment of the present system of the Zulu army, and cessation  of the bloody massacres which constantly take place in that country.
