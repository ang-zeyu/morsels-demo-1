Sometimes the witch of night throws the brother and sister,  the mother and son, the sun and the aurora, together into the waves of  the sea, whence they both escape again, to reappear in the morning.    All these alternative variations of a mythical representation become  each in turn a legend by itself, as we shall see again more in detail,  when the study of the different animals that take part in them shall  furnish us with opportunities of doing so. In the meantime, we have  here finished our enumeration of all that in the hymns of the  _Rigvedas_ refers in any way to the bull and the cow,--to the wind,  moon, and sun bulls, to the cow-cloud, moon, spring and  aurora,--leaving it, however, to be understood how natural it is to  pass from the bull to the handsome hero-prince, and from the cow to  the beautiful girl, the rich princess, the valiant heroine, or the  wise fairy. For though in the mythical hymns of the _Rigvedas_ we have  little more than hints or foreshadows of the many popular legends  which we have thus referred to, often without naming them, these are  so many and so precise that it seems to me to be almost impossible  not to recognise them. To demonstrate this, however, it will be  necessary for me to show further what form the mythological ideas and  figures relating to the animals dispersed in the Vedic hymns  afterwards assumed in the Hindoo traditions.

The root, HI, properly signifies to _distend, draw  out_; here, to _draw out_ the arm of Indras seems to me to mean to  elongate it, to render it as fine as a thread--to sharpen it (in  Italian, _affilare_); the cows that sharpen (It. _affilanti_), are a  variety of the cows that _spin_ (It. _filanti_).

In this stanza, however, _Vansagah_ may  probably signify rather _the stallion_ than _the bull_, as we find in  the second stanza this same Agnis already compared to a radiant horse  (atyo na prishtham prushitasya rocate).    [25] _Adris_ and _parvatas_ properly mean mountain, but, in the Vedas,  often cloud; and among their many meanings there is also that of tree;  _agas_ (properly that which does not move) expresses equally tree and  mountain. Hence perhaps the Italian proverb: _Le montagne stanno  ferme, ma gli uomini s'incontrano_, Mountains stand still, but men  meet; hence the cry of Ramas in the _Ramayanam_, ii. 122, that the  Himalayas would move before he should become a traitor; hence the  assurance with which Macbeth, after the celebrated prophecy of the  witches, can say: \"That will never be; who can impress the forest; bid  the tree unfix his earth-bound root?\" _Shakespeare_ (_Macbeth_, iv.  1.) Nevertheless the forest moved, as it not unfrequently does in the  myths, where the tree-clouds walk, and fill all with terror wherever  they go, where heroes and monsters often fight, by unrooting the trees  of a whole forest.

Here all the stars  or cows together form _many horns_; but perhaps each star or cow in  itself was supposed to have but _one horn_; for the stars, like the  moon, shed but one ray of light, but one light. This, it appears to  me, may be inferred from the name of _Ekacringas_ or _unicorns_,  given, in the later mythology of the Indians, to an entire order of  Mani, of whom the stars are represented as the supreme habitations,  and even purest forms.

The enormous task which the British Army has performed and still      is performing may be shown by a few figures. In this battle of      Armentieres the Germans thus far have engaged twenty-eight      divisions (392,000 men) and since March 21 they have engaged 126      divisions, (1,764,000 men.)        Of these the British Army alone has engaged seventy-nine,      (1,106,000 men,) the French alone have engaged twenty-four,      (336,000 men,) and the remainder, twenty-three, (322,000 men,)      have been engaged by the British and French together.        Of the German divisions which the British engaged, twenty-eight      have been fought twice and one thrice. Of the German divisions      which the French engaged, four have fought twice. Of the German      divisions which the French and British engaged together, fifteen      have been fought twice and one thrice.        It is unpleasant business standing the hammering, but so long as      we can stand it the only question to be asked is, What is      happening to Bluecher--what has become of the reserves?    Thus the perilous situation stood at the time when this magazine went to  press--April 19--with the British fighting fiercely in Flanders and  waiting for Foch to strike with his reserve forces and relieve the  strain.      The Women's Army Auxiliary Corps    By JOHN OXENHAM          _Great work! State work!--willingly done and well,      For the men who are doing so much for us      Ay--more than words can tell!      Right work! White work! faithfully, skillfully done,      But the whole of the soul of it will not be known      Till the war is properly won._        They mend the men; they tend the men;      They help them carry on;      They drop a little veil upon      The woes they've undergone.        They feed the men; they speed the men;      They make their daily bread;      They mend them while they're living,      And they tend them when they're dead.        There's many a lonely man out there      They've saved from black despair;      There's many a lowly grave out there      Made gracious by their care.        They toil for them; they moil for them;      Help lame dogs over stiles,      And do their best to buck them up      With cheery words and smiles.        They're just a little bit of home,      Come out to lend a hand.      They're gleams of warm bright sunshine      In a dreary, weary land.        They are sweet as pinks and daisies,      Just the sight of them is good,      When you've lived for eighteen months or so      In a sink of Flanders mud.        _New work, true work, gallantly, patiently done,      For the men who are giving their all for us--      Your brother, your lover, your son.

Four Epic Weeks of Carnage    By Philip Gibbs    _Special Correspondent with the British Armies_    [Copyrighted in U. S. A.]        _The first phase of the battle of Picardy, which began March 21,      1918, was a vain attempt of the German forces to drive a wedge      between the French and British Armies at their point of      juncture; the second was an equally unsuccessful attempt to      wrest Arras and Vimy Ridge from the British; the third sought to      annihilate the British armies in Flanders and break through to      the English Channel. The last-named phase was still undecided      when this magazine went to press, (April 19.) All three phases      were vividly described from day to day by Philip Gibbs. The      following narrative is compiled from his dispatches to The New      York Times, which are available for Current History Magazine as      an affiliated publication of the Times:_      Thursday, March 21.--A German offensive against the British front has  begun. At about 5 o'clock this morning the enemy began an intense  bombardment of the lines and batteries on a very wide front--something  like sixty miles, from the country south of the Scarpe and to the west  of Bullecourt in the neighborhood of Croisilles, as far south as the  positions between St. Quentin and the British right flank.    After several hours of this hurricane shelling, in which a great deal of  gas was used, the German infantry advanced and developed attacks against  a number of strategical points on a very wide front.    Among the places against which they have directed their chief efforts  are Bullecourt, Lagnecourt, and Noreuil, both west of Cambrai, where  they once before penetrated the British lines and were slaughtered in  great numbers; the St. Quentin Ridge, which was on the right of the  Cambrai fighting, and the villages of Roussoy and Hargicourt, south of  the Cambrai salient.    _Friday, March 22._--The enemy flung the full weight of his great army  against the British yesterday. Nearly forty divisions are identified,  and it is certain that as many as fifty must be engaged. In proportions  of men, the British are much outnumbered, therefore the obstinacy of  the resistance of the troops is wonderful. Nine German divisions were  hurled against three British at one part of the line, and eight against  two at another. All the storm troops, including the guards, were in  brand-new uniforms. They advanced in dense masses, and never faltered  until shattered by the machine-gun fire.    The enemy introduced no new frightfulness, no tanks and no specially  invented gas, but relied on the power of his artillery and the weight of  the infantry assault. The supporting waves advanced over the bodies of  the dead and wounded. The German commanders were ruthless in the  sacrifice of life, in the hope of overwhelming the defense by the sheer  weight of numbers.    They had exceeding power in guns. Opposite three of the British  divisions they had a thousand, and at most parts of the line one to  every twelve or fifteen yards. They had brought a number of long-range  guns, probably naval, and their shellfire was scattered as far back as  twenty-eight miles behind the lines. During the last hour of the  bombardment they poured out gas shells, and continued to send  concentrated gas about the British batteries and reserve trenches. The  atmosphere was filled with poisonous clouds.    _Saturday, March 23._--The enemy has been continuing his attacks all  day along the whole battlefront and has made further progress at various  points in spite of the heroic resistance of the British troops, greatly  outnumbered owing to the enormous concentration of the enemy divisions,  which are constantly reinforced and passing through one another, so that  fresh regiments may pursue the assaults.      ATTACK AT ST. QUENTIN    The St. Quentin attack began along the whole sweep of the front with six  hours' bombardment and intense gas shelling of the British batteries,  and afterward an attack was launched by overwhelming numbers of German  storm troops. The British battleline was held by some three divisions,  from a point south of Pontruet to Itancourt, south of the St. Quentin  Canal. Along this sector the enemy line had been held before the attack  by three divisions also, but the night before the battle they were  reinforced until eight German divisions [upward of 100,000 men] were  massed for assault on a front of some 2,000 yards. I believe this is a  greater strength than has ever been brought into battle on such a narrow  front during the whole of this war.    On this sector, the front north and south of St. Quentin, and opposite  the British line further south, the enemy's intention, as is known from  prisoners, was to reach the line of the St. Quentin Canal--or the Crozat  Canal, as it is sometimes called--on the first day, and then advance in  quick stages westward. The rate of progress was to be eight miles on the  first day, twelve on the second, and twenty on the third.    In spite of their intense gunfire of massed batteries, supported by  Austrian howitzers and large numbers of heavy trench mortars, the  Germans' plans were thwarted so far as this rapidity of progress was  concerned.    The heavy fog of the early morning on Thursday threw their assault  troops at some points into wild confusion. The first line of assault,  each division apparently advancing with two regiments in line, with two  battalions in line, with the other strength of the divisions following  in depth, with light machine-gun companies at intervals of 100 yards,  and then heavy machine guns and field artillery, sometimes became  hopelessly mixed up with the third and fourth lines, while right  battalions were confused with left battalions.    This fog and the British machine-gun fire, which caught the German  waves, checked the pace of their onslaught and caused heavy losses.    The German high command relied entirely on weight of guns and man power  to break the British resistance, and the driving power of the whole  monstrous machine was set in movement. The British line was not strong  enough to hold all the old positions against such a tide of brute force.  The men served their guns and rifles, but as attack followed attack and  column followed column, and their own losses increased as the hours  passed, they were ordered at certain points to give ground and fall  back, fighting heroic rearguard actions from one position to another.      BRITISH LINE BENDS    The main attack, just south of St. Quentin, was directed against  Urvillers and Essigny, and the enemy forced his way through these places  by great drives. The British garrison there was partly destroyed by his  stupendous gunfire. He gained possession of Essigny before midday, March  21, and captured Contescourt, on the edge of the canal. This gave him  important high ground, of which he made full"]]]
