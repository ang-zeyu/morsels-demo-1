But a still more curious story is told of the heart of Louis XIV. An  ancestor of Sir William Harcourt, at the time of the French Revolution  had given to him by a canon of St. Denis the great monarch's heart,  which he had annexed from a casket at the time the royal tombs were  demolished by the mob. It resembled a small piece of shrivelled leather,  an inch or so long. Many years afterwards the late Dr. Buckland, Dean of  Westminster, during a visit to the Harcourts was shown the curiosity. We  will quote the rest in Mr Labouchere's words, for he it was who related  the story in _Truth_. \"He (Dr. Buckland) was then very old. He had some  reputation as a man of science, and the scientific spirit moved him to  wet his finger, rub it on the heart, and put the finger to his mouth.  After that, before he could be stopped, he put the heart in his mouth  and swallowed it, whether by accident or design will never be known.  Very shortly afterwards he died and was buried in Westminster Abbey. It  is impossible that he could ever have digested the thing. It must have  been a pretty tough organ to start with, and age had almost petrified  it. Consequently the heart of Louis XIV. must now be reposing in  Westminster Abbey enclosed in the body of an English dean.\"    FOOTNOTES:    [7] The old Hall was pulled down in 1771.

NOOKS IN NORFOLK      Wells-next-the-Sea, on the north coast of Norfolk, sounds attractive,  and looks attractive on the map; but that is about all that can be said  in its favour, for a more depressing place would be difficult to find.  Even Holkham, with all its art treasures, leaves a pervading impression  of chill and gloom. The architects of the middle of the eighteenth  century had no partiality for nooks and corners in the mansions they  designed. Vastness and discomfort seems to have been their principal  aim. Well might the noble earl for whom it was built have observed, \"It  is a melancholy thing to stand alone in one's own country.\" The advent  of the motor car must indeed be welcome, to bring the place in touch  with life.    We were attracted to the village of Stiffkey, to the east of Wells,  mainly by a magazine article fresh in our memory, of some of its  peculiarities, conspicuous among which was its weird red-headed  inhabitants. The race of people, however, must have died out, for what  few villagers we encountered were very ordinary ones: far from  ill-favoured. Possibly they still invoke the aid of the local \"wise  woman,\" as they do in many other parts of Norfolk, so therein they are  no further behind the times than their neighbours.    We heard of an instance farther south, for example, where the head of an  establishment, as was his wont, having disposed of his crop of potatoes,  disappeared for a week with the proceeds; and returning at length in a  very merry condition, his good wife, in the hopes of frightening him,  unknown to him removed his watch from his pocket. Next morning in sober  earnest he went with his sole remaining sixpence to consult the wise  woman of the village, who promptly told him the thief was in his own  house. Consequently the watch was produced, and the lady who had  purloined it, instead of teaching a lesson, was soundly belaboured with  a broom-handle!    [Illustration: EAST BARSHAM MANOR.]    Stiffkey Hall is a curious Elizabethan gabled building with a massive  flint tower, built, it is said, by Sir Nathaniel Bacon, the brother of  the philosopher, but it never was completed. Far more picturesque and  interesting are the remains of East Barsham manor-house, some seven  miles to the south of Wells. Although it contained some of the finest  ornamental Tudor brickwork in England when we were there, and possibly  still, the old place could have been had for a song. It had the  reputation of being haunted, and was held in awe. The gatehouse, bearing  the arms and ensigns of Henry VIII., reminds one of a bit of Hampton  Court, and the chimneys upon the buildings on the northern side of the  Court are as fine as those at Compton Wyniates. The wonder is that in  these days of appreciation of beautiful architecture nobody has restored  it back into a habitable mansion. That such ruins as this or Kirby Hall  or Burford Priory should remain to drop to pieces, seems a positive sin.  A couple of miles to the west of Barsham is Great Snoring, whose  turreted parsonage is also rich in early-Tudor moulded brickwork, as is  also the case at Thorpland Hall to the south.    One grieves to think that the old Hall of the Townshends on the other  side of Fakenham has been shorn of its ancestral portraits. What a  splendid collection, indeed, was this, and how far more dignified did  the full-length Elizabethan warriors by Janssen look here than upon the  walls at Christie's a year or so ago. The famous haunted chambers have a  far less awe-inspiring appearance than some other of the bedrooms with  their hearse-like beds and nodding plumes. We do not know when the  \"Brown Lady\" last made her appearance, but there are rumours that she  was visible before the decease of the late Marquis Townshend. Until then  the stately lady in her rich brown brocade had absented herself for half  a century. She had last introduced herself unbecoming a modest ghost, to  two gentlemen visitors of a house party who were sitting up late at  night. One of these gentlemen, a Colonel Loftus, afterwards made a  sketch of her from memory which possibly is still in existence.    [Illustration: WALSINGHAM.]    [Illustration: WALSINGHAM.]    Walsingham, midway between Fakenham and Wells, is a quaint old town; its  timber houses and its combined Gothic well, lock-up, and cross in the  market-place giving it quite a mediaeval aspect. Before the image of Our  Lady of Walsingham was consigned to the flames by Wolsey's confidential  servant Cromwell, the pilgrimages to the Priory were in every respect as  great as those to Canterbury, and the \"way\" through Brandon and  Newmarket may be traced like that in Kent. Notwithstanding the fact that  Henry VIII. himself had been a barefoot pilgrim, and had bestowed a  costly necklace on the image, his gift as well as a host of other riches  from the shrine came in very handy at the Dissolution. A relic of Our  Lady's milk enclosed in crystal, says Erasmus, was occasionally like  chalk mixed with the white of eggs. It had been brought from  Constantinople in the tenth century; but this and a huge bone of St  Peter's finger, of course, did not survive. The site of the chapel,  containing the altar where the pilgrims knelt, stood somewhere to the  north-west of the ruins of the Priory. These are approached from the  street through a fine old early fifteenth-century gateway. The  picturesque remains of the refectory date from the previous century, the  western window being a good example of the purest Gothic. The old  pilgrims' entrance was in \"Knight Street,\" which derives its name from  the miracle of a horseman who had sought sanctuary passing through the  extraordinarily narrow limits of the wicket. Henry III. is said to have  set the fashion for walking to Walsingham, and we strongly recommend  the tourists of to-day, who may find themselves stranded at  Wells-next-the-Sea, to do likewise.    [Illustration: FONT CANOPY, TRUNCH.]    The little seaside resort Mundesley is an improvement on Wells; but dull  as it is now, what must it have been in Cowper's time: surely a place  ill-calculated to improve the poor poet's melancholia! There is little  of interest beyond the ruined church on the cliffs and the Rookery Farm  incorporated in the remains of the old monastery. A priest's hole is, or  was not long since, to be seen in one of the gabled roofs. The churches  of Trunch and Knapton to the south-west both are worth a visit for their  fine timber roofs. The font at Trunch is enclosed by a remarkable canopy  of oak supported by graceful wooden pillars from the floor. It is  probably of early-Elizabethan date, and is certainly one of the most  remarkable baptistries in the country. Here and in other parts of  Norfolk when there are several babies to be christened the ceremony is  usually performed on the girls last, as otherwise when they grew up they  would develop beards!    Ten miles to the south-west as the crow flies is historic Blickling, one  of the reputed birthplaces of the ill-fated Anne Boleyn. By some  accounts Luton Hoo in Bedfordshire claims her nativity as well as  Rochford Hall in Essex and Hever Castle in Kent; but, though Hever is  the only building that will go back to that date, she probably was born  in the older Hall of Blickling, the present mansion dating only from the  reign of James I.    Upon the occasion of our visit the house was closed, so we can only  speak of the exterior, and of the very extensive gardens, where in vain  we sought the steward, who was said to be somewhere on the premises.    The rampant bulls, bearing shields, perched on the solid piers that  guard the drawbridge across the moat, duly impress one with the  ancestral importance of the Hobarts, whose arms and quarterings,  surmounted by the helmet and ancient crest, adorn the principal  entrance. Like Hatfield and Bramshill, the mellowed red-brick gives it a  charm of colour which only the lapse of centuries will give; and though  not so old as Knole or Hatfield, the main"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/398"],[0,"The First Book of Adam and Eve (#7)"],[1,"sorrow.\"    4 When Adam heard these words from God, he worshipped before Him.  He  and Eve worshipped Him and gave Him thanks, because He had dealt  mercifully with them.    5 Then God commanded the three angels, Michael, Gabriel and Raphael,  each to bring what he had brought, and give it to Adam.  And they did  so, one by one.    6 And God commanded Suriyel and Salathiel to bear up Adam and Eve, and  bring them down from the top of the high mountain, and to take them to  the Cave of Treasures.    7 There they laid the gold on the south side of the cave, the incense  on the eastern side, and the myrrh on the western side.  For the mouth  of the cave was on the north side.    8 The angels then comforted Adam and Eve, and departed.    9 The gold was seventy rods*; the incense, twelve pounds; and the  myrrh, three pounds.    10 These remained by Adam in the Cave of Treasures**.    11 God gave these three things to Adam on the third day after he had  come out of the garden, in token of the three days the Lord should  remain in the heart of the earth.    12 And these three things, as they continued with Adam in the cave,  gave him light by night; and by day they gave him a little relief from  his sorrow.      * A rod is a unit of linear measure equivalent to 5.5 yards and also a  unit of area measure equivalent to 30.25 square yards.  In this case,  the word rod simply means a kind of long, thin piece of gold of  unspecified size and weight.    ** This is the original text which appears to contain embedded  editorial content:  \"These remained by Adam in the House of Treasures;  therefore was it called 'of concealment.'  But other interpreters say  it was called the 'Cave of Treasures,' by reason of the bodies of  righteous men that were in it.          Chapter XXXII - Adam and Eve go into the water to pray.    1 And Adam and Eve remained in the Cave of Treasures until the seventh  day; they neither ate of the fruit the earth, nor drank water.    2 And when it dawned on the eighth day, Adam said to Eve, \"O Eve, we  prayed God to give us something from the garden, and He sent his angels  who brought us what we had desired.    3 But now, get up, let us go to the sea of water we saw at first, and  let us stand in it, praying that God will again be favorable to us and  take us back to the garden; or give us something; or that He will give  us comfort in some other land than this in which we are.\"    4 Then Adam and Eve came out of the cave, went and stood on the border  of the sea in which they had before thrown themselves, and Adam said to  Eve:--    5 Come, go down into this place, and come not out of it until the end  of thirty days, when I shall come to you.  And pray to God with burning  heart and a sweet voice, to forgive us.    6 And I will go to another place, and go down into it, and do like you.\"    7 Then Eve went down into the water, as Adam had commanded her.  Adam  also went down into the water; and they stood praying; and besought the  Lord to forgive them their offense, and to restore them to their former  state.    8 And they stood like that praying, until the end of the thirty-five  days.          Chapter XXXIII - Satan falsely promises the \"bright light.\"    1 But Satan, the hater of all good, sought them in the cave, but found  them not, although he searched diligently for them.    2 But he found them standing in the water praying and thought within  himself, \"Adam and Eve are standing like that in that water praying to  God to forgive them their transgression, and to restore them to their  former state, and to take them from under my hand.    3 But I will deceive them so that they shall come out of the water, and  not fulfil their vow.\"    4 Then the hater of all good, went not to Adam, but he went to Eve, and  took the form of an angel of God, praising and rejoicing, and said to  her:--    5 \"Peace be to you!  Be glad and rejoice!  God is favorable to you, and  He sent me to Adam.  I have brought him the glad tidings of salvation,  and of his being filled with bright light as he was at first.    6 And Adam, in his joy for his restoration, has sent me to you, that  you come to me, in order that I crown you with light like him.    7 And he said to me, 'Speak to Eve; if she does not come with you, tell  her of the sign when we were on the top of the mountain; how God sent  his angels who took us and brought us to the Cave of Treasures; and  laid the gold on the southern side; incense, on the eastern side; and  myrrh on the western side.'  Now come to him.\"    8 When Eve hear these words from him, she rejoiced greatly.  And  thinking Satan's appearance was real, she came out of the sea.    9 He went before, and she followed him until they came to Adam.  Then  Satan hid himself from her, and she saw him no more.    10 She then came and stood before Adam, who was standing by the water  and rejoicing in God's forgiveness.    11 And as she called to him, he turned around, found her there and  cried when he saw her, and beat his chest; and from the bitterness of  his grief, he sank into the water.    12 But God looked at him and at his misery, and at his being about to  breathe his last.  And the Word of God came from heaven, raised him out  of the water, and said to him, \"Go up the high bank to Eve.\"  And when  he came up to Eve he said to her, \"Who told you to come here?\"    13 Then she told him the discourse of the angel who had appeared to her  and had given her a sign.    14 But Adam grieved, and gave her to know it was Satan.  He then took  her and they both returned to the cave.    15 These things happened to them the second time they went down to the  water, seven days after their coming out of the garden.    16 They fasted in the water thirty-five days; altogether forty-two days  since they had left the garden.          Chapter XXXIV - Adam recalls the creation of Eve.  He eloquently  appeals for food and drink.    1 And on the morning of the forty-third day, they came out of the cave,  sorrowful and crying.  Their bodies were lean, and they were parched  from hunger and thirst, from fasting and praying, and from their heavy  sorrow on account of their transgression.    2 And when they had come out of the cave they went up the mountain to  the west of the garden.    3 There they stood and prayed and besought God to grant them  forgiveness of their sins.    4 And after their prayers Adam began to beg God, saying, \"O my Lord, my  God, and my Creator, You commanded the four elements* to be gathered  together, and they were gathered together by Thine order.    5 Then You spread Your hand and created me out of one element, that of  dust of the earth; and You brought me into the garden at the third  hour, on a Friday, and informed me of it in the cave.    6 Then, at first, I knew neither night nor day, for I had a bright  nature; neither did the light in which I lived ever leave me to know  night or day.    7 Then, again, O Lord, in that third hour in which You created me, You  brought to me all beasts, and lions, and ostriches, and fowls of the  air, and all things that move in the earth, which You had created at  the first hour before me of the Friday.    8 And Your will was that I should name them all, one by one, with a  suitable name.  But You gave me understanding and knowledge, and a pure  heart and a right mind from you, that I should name them after Thine  own mind regarding the naming of them.    9 O God, You made them obedient to me, and ordered that not one of them  break from my sway, according to Your commandment, and to the dominion  which You had given me over them.  But now they are all estranged from  me.    10 Then it was in that third hour of Friday, in which You created me,  and commanded me concerning the tree, to which I was neither to go  near, nor to eat thereof; for You said to me in the garden, 'When you  eat of it, of death you shall die.'    11 And if You had punished me as You said, with death, I should have  died that very moment.    12 Moreover, when You commanded me regarding the tree, I was neither to  approach nor to eat thereof, Eve was not with me; You had not yet  created her, neither had You yet taken her out of my side; nor had she  yet heard this order from you.    13 Then, at the end of the third hour of that Friday, O Lord, You  caused a slumber and a sleep to come over me, and I slept, and was  overwhelmed in sleep.    14 Then You drew a rib out of my side, and created it after my own  likeness and image.  Then I awoke; and when I saw her and knew who she  was, I said, 'This is bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh; from now  on she shall be called woman.'    15 It was of Your good will, O God, that You brought a slumber in a  sleep over me, and that You immediately brought Eve out of my side,  until she was out, so that I did not see how she was made; neither  could I witness, O my Lord, how awful and great are Your goodness and  glory.    16 And of Your goodwill, O Lord, You made us both with bodies of a  bright nature, and You made us two, one; and You gave us Your grace,  and filled us with praises of the Holy Spirit; that we should be  neither hungry nor thirsty, nor know what sorrow is, nor yet faintness  of heart; neither suffering, fasting nor weariness.    17 But now, O God, since we transgressed Your commandment and broke  Your law, You have brought us out into a strange land, and have caused  suffering, and faintness, hunger  and thirst to come over us.    18 Now, therefore, O God, we pray you, give us something to eat from  the garden, to satisfy our hunger with it; and something wherewith to  quench our thirst.    19 For, behold, many days, O God, we have tasted nothing and drunk  nothing, and our flesh is dried up, and our strength is wasted, and  sleep is gone from our eyes from faintness and crying.    20 Then, O God, we dare not gather anything from the fruit of trees,  from fear of you.  For when we transgress at first You spared us and "]]]
