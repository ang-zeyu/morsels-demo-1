He drew a little nigher, and then he saw  that it was a woman, clad in green like the sward whereon she lay.  She  was playing with the welling out of the water, and she had trussed up her  sleeves to the shoulder that she might thrust her bare arms therein.  Her  shoes of black leather lay on the grass beside her, and her feet and legs  yet shone with the brook.    Belike amidst the splashing and clatter of the water she did not hear him  drawing nigh, so that he was close to her before she lifted up her face  and saw him, and he beheld her, that it was the maiden of the thrice-seen  pageant.  She reddened when she saw him, and hastily covered up her legs  with her gown-skirt, and drew down the sleeves over her arms, but  otherwise stirred not.  As for him, he stood still, striving to speak to  her; but no word might he bring out, and his heart beat sorely.    But the maiden spake to him in a clear sweet voice, wherein was now no  trouble: \"Thou art an alien, art thou not?  For I have not seen thee  before.\"    \"Yea,\" he said, \"I am an alien; wilt thou be good to me?\"    She said: \"And why not?  I was afraid at first, for I thought it had been  the King's Son.  I looked to see none other; for of goodly men he has  been the only one here in the land this long while, till thy coming.\"    He said: \"Didst thou look for my coming at about this time?\"    \"O nay,\" she said; \"how might I?\"    Said Walter: \"I wot not; but the other man seemed to be looking for me,  and knew of me, and he brought me bread to eat.\"    She looked on him anxiously, and grew somewhat pale, as she said: \"What  other one?\"    Now Walter did not know what the dwarf might be to her, fellow-servant or  what not, so he would not show his loathing of him; but answered wisely:  \"The little man in the yellow raiment.\"    But when she heard that word, she went suddenly very pale, and leaned her  head aback, and beat the air with her hands; but said presently in a  faint voice: \"I pray thee talk not of that one while I am by, nor even  think of him, if thou mayest forbear.\"    He spake not, and she was a little while before she came to herself  again; then she opened her eyes, and looked upon Walter and smiled kindly  on him, as though to ask his pardon for having scared him.  Then she rose  up in her place, and stood before him; and they were nigh together, for  the stream betwixt them was little.    But he still looked anxiously upon her and said: \"Have I hurt thee?  I  pray thy pardon.\"    She looked on him more sweetly still, and said: \"O nay; thou wouldst not  hurt me, thou!\"    Then she blushed very red, and he in like wise; but afterwards she turned  pale, and laid a hand on her breast, and Walter cried out hastily: \"O me!  I have hurt thee again.  Wherein have I done amiss?\"    \"In nought, in nought,\" she said; \"but I am troubled, I wot not  wherefore; some thought hath taken hold of me, and I know it not.  Mayhappen in a little while I shall know what troubles me.  Now I bid  thee depart from me a little, and I will abide here; and when thou comest  back, it will either be that I have found it out or not; and in either  case I will tell thee.\"    She spoke earnestly to him; but he said: \"How long shall I abide away?\"    Her face was troubled as she answered him: \"For no long while.\"    He smiled on her and turned away, and went a space to the other side of  the oak-trees, whence she was still within eyeshot.  There he abode until  the time seemed long to him; but he schooled himself and forbore; for he  said: Lest she send me away again.  So he abided until again the time  seemed long to him, and she called not to him: but once again he forbore  to go; then at last he arose, and his heart beat and he trembled, and he  walked back again speedily, and came to the maiden, who was still  standing by the rock of the spring, her arms hanging down, her eyes  downcast.  She looked up at him as he drew nigh, and her face changed  with eagerness as she said: \"I am glad thou art come back, though it be  no long while since thy departure\" (sooth to say it was scarce half an  hour in all).  \"Nevertheless I have been thinking many things, and  thereof will I now tell thee.\"    He said: \"Maiden, there is a river betwixt us, though it be no big one.  Shall I not stride over, and come to thee, that we may sit down together  side by side on the green grass?\"    \"Nay,\" she said, \"not yet; tarry a while till I have told thee of  matters.  I must now tell thee of my thoughts in order.\"    Her colour went and came now, and she plaited the folds of her gown with  restless fingers.  At last she said: \"Now the first thing is this; that  though thou hast seen me first only within this hour, thou hast set thine  heart upon me to have me for thy speech-friend and thy darling.  And if  this be not so, then is all my speech, yea and all my hope, come to an  end at once.\"    \"O yea!\" said Walter, \"even so it is: but how thou hast found this out I  wot not; since now for the first time I say it, that thou art indeed my  love, and my dear and my darling.\"    \"Hush,\" she said, \"hush! lest the wood have ears, and thy speech is loud:  abide, and I shall tell thee how I know it.  Whether this thy love shall  outlast the first time that thou holdest my body in thine arms, I wot  not, nor dost thou.  But sore is my hope that it may be so; for I also,  though it be but scarce an hour since I set eyes on thee, have cast mine  eyes on thee to have thee for my love and my darling, and my  speech-friend.  And this is how I wot that thou lovest me, my friend.  Now  is all this dear and joyful, and overflows my heart with sweetness.  But  now must I tell thee of the fear and the evil which lieth behind it.\"    Then Walter stretched out his hands to her, and cried out: \"Yea, yea!  But  whatever evil entangle us, now we both know these two things, to wit,  that thou lovest me, and I thee, wilt thou not come hither, that I may  cast mine arms about thee, and kiss thee, if not thy kind lips or thy  friendly face at all, yet at least thy dear hand: yea, that I may touch  thy body in some wise?\"    She looked on him steadily, and said softly: \"Nay, this above all things  must not be; and that it may not be is a part of the evil which entangles  us.  But hearken, friend, once again I tell thee that thy voice is over  loud in this wilderness fruitful of evil.  Now I have told thee, indeed,  of two things whereof we both wot; but next I must needs tell thee of  things whereof I wot, and thou wottest not.  Yet this were better, that  thou pledge thy word not to touch so much as one of my hands, and that we  go together a little way hence away from these tumbled stones, and sit  down upon the open greensward; whereas here is cover if there be spying  abroad.\"    Again, as she spoke, she turned very pale; but Walter said: \"Since it  must be so, I pledge thee my word to thee as I love thee.\"    And therewith she knelt down, and did on her foot-gear, and then sprang  lightly over the rivulet; and then the twain of them went side by side  some half a furlong thence, and sat down, shadowed by the boughs of a  slim quicken-tree growing up out of the greensward, whereon for a good  space around was neither bush nor brake.    There began the maiden to talk soberly, and said: \"This is what I must  needs say to thee now, that thou art come into a land perilous for any  one that loveth aught of good; from which, forsooth, I were fain that  thou wert gotten away safely, even though I should die of longing for  thee.  As for myself, my peril is, in a measure, less than thine; I mean  the peril of death.  But lo, thou, this iron on my foot is token that I  am a thrall, and thou knowest in what wise thralls must pay for  transgressions.  Furthermore, of what I am, and how I came hither, time  would fail me to tell; but somewhile, maybe, I shall tell thee.  I serve  an evil mistress, of whom I may say that scarce I wot if she be a woman  or not; but by some creatures is she accounted for a god, and as a god is  heried; and surely never god was crueller nor colder than she.  Me she  hateth sorely; yet if she hated me little or nought, small were the gain  to me if it were her pleasure to deal hardly by me.  But as things now  are, and are like to be, it would not be for her pleasure, but for her  pain and loss, to make an end of me, therefore, as I said e'en now, my  mere life is not in peril with her; unless, perchance, some sudden  passion get the better of her, and she slay me, and repent of it  thereafter.  For so it is, that if it be the least evil of her conditions  that she is wanton, at least wanton she is to the letter.  Many a time  hath she cast the net for the catching of some goodly young man; and her  latest prey (save it be thou) is the young man whom I named, when first I  saw thee, by the name of the King's Son.  He is with us yet, and I fear  him; for of late hath he wearied of her, though it is but plain truth to  say of her, that she is the wonder of all Beauties of the World.  He hath  wearied of her, I say, and hath cast his eyes upon me, and if I were  heedless, he would betray me to the uttermost of the wrath of my  mistress.  For needs must I say of him, though he be a goodly man, and  now fallen into thralldom, that he hath no bowels of compassion; but is a  dastard, who for an hour's pleasure would undo me, and thereafter would  stand by smiling and taking my mistress's pardon with good cheer, while  for me would be no pardon.  Seest thou, therefore, how it is with me  between these two cruel fools?  And moreover there are others of whom I  will not even speak to thee.\"    And therewith she put her hands before her face, and wept, and murmured:  \"Who shall deliver me from this death in life?\"    But Walter cried out: \"For what else am I come hither, I, I?\"    And it"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30550"],[0,"Finn The Wolfhound (#7)"],[1,"matters for the pups. Then she  began to lick the back and flank of the pup nearest her head; one  of her own. The Master leaned forward. The foster's sensitive nose  passed over the back of the first pup to the wriggling tail of  Finn; and her big eyes hardened and looked queerly straight down  her muzzle at the fat grey back of the stranger; a back twice as  broad as those of her own pups. The black nostrils quivered and  expanded, expressing suspicious resentment. No warm tongue curled  out over Finn's fat back; but, instead, a nose made curiously harsh  and unsympathetic pushed him clear away from the place he had  selected, after spluttering hurried investigation, and out upon the  straw of the bed.    Immediately then, and almost before Finn's sticky mouth could open  in a bleat of protest, the Master's hand had returned him to the  warm dugs. Again came the harsh, suspicious nose of the foster  about Finn's tail, and this time a low growl followed the resentful  sniff, and blind, helpless, unformed little jelly that Finn was,  instinct made him wriggle fearfully from under that cold nose. The  language in which bitches speak to the very young among puppies is  simplicity itself. The Master, human though he was, had not failed  to catch the sense of this observation of the foster's, which was:--    \"Get out of here, you lumping great whelp! You're not mine, and I  won't nurse you. Get out, or I'll bite. It's true you've somehow  got the smell of mine; but--you can't deceive me. Gr-r-r-! Get  out!\"    But, though Finn instinctively wriggled his hind-quarters from  under that cold muzzle, his mouth and fore-feet vigorously pursued  their business; and, before the threatened bite came, the Master's  hand (a firm one, and soothing to dog people) had caressingly  pressed the foster's head back upon the straw, and held it there.    \"There, there, little woman,\" he said, good-humouredly. \"Let him  have his chance; he's a good pup, and will do you great credit  presently.\"    His hand continued to rest on the sheep-dog's neck or head, till  the three pups were comfortably full, and the foster herself was  comfortably eased of her bounteous milk-supply. Then, gently, he  removed his hand, and the foster proceeded to lick her own two pups  with exemplary diligence. Out of consideration for the Master, whom  she found an obviously well-meaning person, she refrained from  taking any active steps against the big grey pup, but she very  pointedly ignored him. And when, in due course, Finn came  galumphing about her neck, with all the doddering insolence of the  full-fed pup, she turned her head in the opposite direction with  cool superciliousness, and exhaled a long breath through her nose,  as though she found the air offensive. But the Master petted her,  and gave her a very little warm bread and milk. Then he took the  three puppies away in the warm blanket and handed one of them to  some one who waited outside the door of the back-kitchen. Finn,  with one sleepy foster-brother, was replaced in the hamper near the  kitchen stove.    A couple of hours later, the foster-mother began to worry, and to  wish that her puppies would come and take another meal. At about  the same time Finn and his diminutive companion in the hamper began  to worry, and to wish that they could have another meal. Ten  minutes after that they were carried down to the coach-house, and  put to nurse again. While they fed vigorously, the foster,  apparently by accident, touched Finn once or twice with her tongue,  in process of licking her own pup; and she did not growl.    \"Good!\" said the Master, and he sat down on a little barrel of  disinfectant powder to fill a pipe.    Then both puppies began to grovel and slide about the foster's legs  and body; this being the natural order of things for very young  puppies: to feed full, to grovel and wriggle, to sleep; and then to  begin again at the beginning. But for the complete comfort and  well-being of puppies at this age, certain maternal attentions,  apart from the provision of nourishment, are requisite. For several  minutes the foster-mother plied her own offspring with every good  office, and severely ignored the rotund and would-be playful Finn.  Then the sheep-dog lay flat on her side, and breathed out through  her nostrils a statement to the effect that:--    \"That is really quite as far as I can be expected to go. This big  grey creature has fed beside mine, and I have suffered it, as a  matter of charity; but---no more. The great clumsy thing must shift  for itself now.\"    But Finn appeared to think otherwise. His mode of progression was  rather that of an intoxicated snake, or an over-fed turtle on dry  land; but he managed to stagger along as far as the foster's  muzzle, and swayed there on his little haunches within reach of her  warm breath. Instinct guided the pup so far, and left him waiting  vaguely uncomfortable.    The Master watched closely, but nothing happened, save that the  bitch ostentatiously closed her eyes. Then instinct moved again,  strongly, in shapeless little Finn, and he straddled the foster's  nose, so that his round stomach pressed on her nostrils. There he  wriggled helplessly. Then a curious thing happened, while the  Master leaned forward, prepared to snatch the pup from danger. The  sheep-dog emitted a low, angry growl, which filled Finn with  uncomprehending fear, and toppled him over on his fat back. But,  even while she growled, maternity asserted its claim strongly in  the kindly heart of this soft-eyed sheep-dog. Finn did not know in  the least what he wanted; but the wise little sheep-dog did; and,  her growl ended, she rolled Finn into the required position with  her nose, and gave him the licking and tongue-washing which his  bodily comfort demanded, with quiet, conscientious thoroughness.  When this was over, Finn, feeling ever so much more content, sidled  back to a place beside the other pup, and in a minute the pair of  them were fast asleep in the warm shelter of the foster's flank.  Then the Master laid down his pipe, and bent forward to stroke and  fondle the little sheep-dog for two or three minutes, chatting with  her, and establishing firmly the friendship already begun between  them. And then, feeling quite safe in the matter, now that the  foster had once licked Finn into comfort, he went away, and left  the three together while he paid a visit to Tara.    Next morning, while the foster-mother was being petted and fed in  the garden, some one removed her own little puppy from the bed, and  when she returned to the coach-house, full of the contentment  inspired by a good meal, a little exercise, and a deal of kindly  petting, it was to find her bed occupied only by the big grey  whelp. But she showed no more than momentary surprise and  uneasiness, and within the minute was busily engaged in giving Finn  his morning tubbing and polishing, after which she disposed herself  with great consideration in a position which made nursing an easy  delight for Finn, and enabled his assiduous foster-mother to watch  the undulations of his fat back, out of the tail of her left eye,  while apparently sleeping.          [Illustration]    CHAPTER IV    FIRST STEPS      The sturdy, kindly, plebeian sheep-dog proved an admirable foster-mother,  diligent, thorough, and forgetful of nothing, not even of  her own needs and well-being, though it was evident that these were  served from quite unselfish motives, and obliged to take a  secondary place in all her thoughts. It was particularly well for  Finn that the sheep-dog proved so sterling a soul; for, though he  naturally knew and cared nothing about it all, Finn received less  attention during the next few days from the Master and the Mistress  than they were wont to give their canine families. Of course, the  foster was properly fed and given exercise and otherwise looked  after; but the Master did not smoke his pipe in the coach-house,  and the Mistress of the Kennels did not sit on the side of the bed  for half an hour at a time and stroke the foster's ears while  admiring her nursling, as certainly would have happened in normal  circumstances.    The Master's doubts about poor Tara's health had been fully  justified. Her puppies were thin and inclined to be ailing, and she  herself was only just saved, by means of scrupulous care and  attention, and the use of other drugs besides externally-applied  belladonna, from a severe illness. Meantime, another foster was  telegraphed for, and, an hour after this new-comer's arrival, one  of Tara's pups died. The Master had no time to be greatly concerned  about this, by reason of his anxiety regarding Tara herself. He  felt that another bout of the illness in which she had nearly lost  her life in the early days would almost certainly be fatal, and the  steps he took to stave this off kept him very busy. In addition to  this, a carpenter had to be set to work in a great hurry to put  together a suitable bed for the new foster-mother in a shed in the  orchard. Fortunately, the weather was very favourable, and the two  puppies taken from Tara soon picked up their lost ground when they  were established with their foster, an active, cross-bred  spaniel-retriever.    But Finn in the coach-house knew nothing of all this. Apart from  anything else, he was still perfectly blind; also, he had as much  of the best kind of nourishment as he was capable of absorbing, and  was watched over, and cared for, and ministered to by the loyal  little sheep-dog quite as scrupulously as a human baby is tended.  There never was a truer saying than that \"Blood will tell.\" But,  not only is a mongrel mother's milk rich and strong (if she is a  healthy, well-cared for animal), but also her care of her young is  slavish and unremitting. Her nerves are never overstrained; she is  not unduly sensitive; she knows how to economize vital energy.  There is as much difference between "]]]
