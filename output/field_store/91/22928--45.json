She sent for her a mulatto woman to whom she was much  attached, named Euphemie, who was the foster-sister of Madame Bonaparte,  and passed (I do not know if the supposition was correct) as her natural  sister. Euphemie, accompanied by Charvet, made the journey in one of  Madame Bonaparte's carriages. Mademoiselle Hortense, on their arrival,  was delighted with the journey she was about to make, and above all with  the idea of being near her mother, for whom she felt the tenderest  affection. Mademoiselle Hortense was, I would not say, greedy, but she  was exceedingly fond of sweets; and Charvet, in relating these details,  said to me, that at each town of any size through which they passed the  carriage was filled with bonbons and dainties, of which mademoiselle  consumed a great quantity. One day, while Euphemie and Charvet were  sound asleep, they were suddenly awakened by a report, which sounded  frightful to them, and caused them intense anxiety, as they found when  they awoke that they were passing through a thick forest. This ludicrous  incident threw Hortense into fits of laughter; for hardly had they  expressed their alarm when they found themselves deluged with an  odoriferous froth, which explained the cause of the explosion. A bottle  of champagne, placed in one of the pockets of the carriage, had been  uncorked; and the heat, added to the motion of the carriage, or rather  the malice of the young traveler, had made it explode with a loud report.    When mademoiselle arrived at Plombieres, her mother's health was almost  restored; so that the pupil of Madame Campan found there all the  distractions which please and delight at the age which the daughter of  Madame Bonaparte had then attained.    There is truth in the saying that in all evil there is good, for had this  accident not happened to Madame Bonaparte, it is very probable she would  have become a prisoner of the English; in fact, she learned that  'La Pomone', the vessel on which she wished to make the voyage, had  fallen into the power of the enemies of France. General Bonaparte, in  all his letters, still dissuaded his wife from the plan she had of  rejoining him; and, consequently, she returned to Paris.    On her arrival Josephine devoted her attention to executing a wish  General Bonaparte had expressed to her before leaving. He had remarked  to her that he should like, on his return, to have a country seat; and he  charged his brother to attend to this, which Joseph, however, failed to  do. Madame Bonaparte, who, on the contrary, was always in search of what  might please her husband, charged several persons to make excursions in  the environs of Paris, in order to ascertain whether a suitable dwelling  could be found. After having vacillated long between Ris and Malmaison,  she decided on the latter, which she bought from M. Lecoulteux-Dumoley,  for, I think, four hundred thousand francs. Such were the particulars  which Charvet was kind enough to give me when I first entered the service  of Madame Bonaparte. Every one in the house loved to speak of her; and  it was certainly not to speak evil, for never was woman more beloved by  all who surrounded her, and never has one deserved it more. General  Bonaparte was also an excellent man in the retirement of private life.    After the return of the First Consul from his campaign in Egypt, several  attempts against his life had been made; and the police had warned him  many times to be on his guard, and not to risk himself alone in the  environs of Malmaison. The First Consul had been very careless up to  this period; but the discovery of the snares which were laid for him,  even in the privacy of his family circle, forced him to use precautions  and prudence. It has been stated since, that these pretended plots were  only fabrications of the police to render themselves necessary to the  First Consul, or, perhaps, of the First Consul himself, to redouble the  interest which attached to his person, through fear of the perils which  menaced his life; and the absurdity of these attempts is alleged as proof  of this. I could not pretend to elucidate such mysteries; but it seems  to me that in such matters absurdity proves nothing, or, at least, it  does not prove that such plots did not exist. The conspirators of that  period set no bounds to their extravagance; for what could be more  absurd, and at the same time more real, than the atrocious folly of the  infernal machine?    Be that as it may, I shall relate what passed under my own eyes during  the first month of my stay at Malmaison. No one there, or, at least, no  one in my presence, showed the least doubt of the reality of these  attempts.    In order to get rid of the First Consul, all means appeared good to his  enemies: they noted everything in their calculations, even his absence of  mind. The following occurrence is proof of this:    There were repairs and ornamentations to be made to the mantel in the  rooms of the First Consul at Malmaison. The contractor in charge of this  work had sent marblecutters, amongst whom had slipped in, it seems, a few  miserable wretches employed by the conspirators. The persons attached to  the First Consul were incessantly on the alert, and exercised the  greatest watchfulness; and it was observed that among these workmen there  were men who pretended to work, but whose air and manner contrasted  strongly with their occupation. These suspicions were unfortunately only  too well founded; for when the apartments had been made ready to receive  the First Consul, and just as he was on the eve of occupying them, some  one making a final inspection found on the desk at which he would first  seat himself, a snuff-box, in every respect like one of those which he  constantly used. It was thought at first that this box really belonged  to him, and that it had been forgotten and left there by his valet; but  doubts inspired by the suspicious manner of a few of the marble-cutters,  leading to further investigation, the tobacco was examined and analyzed.  It was found to be poisoned.    The authors of this perfidy had, it is said, at this time, communication  with other conspirators, who engaged to attempt another means of ridding  themselves of the First Consul. They promised to attack the guard of the  chateau (Malmaison), and to carry off by force the chief of the  government. With this intention, they had uniforms made like those of  the consular guards, who then stood sentinel, day and night, over the  First Consul, and followed him on horseback in his excursions. In this  costume, and by the aid of signals, with their accomplices (the pretended  marble-cutters) on the inside, they could easily have approached and  mingled with the guard, who were fed and quartered at the chateau. They  could even have reached the First Consul, and carried him off. However,  this first project was abandoned as too uncertain; and the conspirators  flattered themselves that they would succeed in their undertaking more  surely, and with less danger, by taking advantage of the frequent  journeys of the First Consul to Paris. By means of their disguise they  planned to distribute themselves on the road, among the guides of the  escort, and massacre them, their rallying-point being the quarries of  Nanterre; but their plots were for the second time foiled. There was in  the park at Malmaison a deep quarry; and fears being entertained that  they would profit by it to conceal themselves therein, and exercise some  violence against the First Consul on one of his solitary walks, it was  decided to secure it with an iron door.    On the 19th of February, at one in the afternoon, the First Consul went  in state to the Tuileries, which was then called the Government palace,  to install himself there with all his household. With him were his two  colleagues; one of whom, the third consul, was to occupy the same  residence, and be located in the Pavilion de Flore. The carriage of the  consuls was drawn by six white horses, which the Emperor of Germany had  presented to the conqueror of Italy after the signature of the treaty of  peace of Campo-Formio. The saber that the First Consul wore at this  ceremony was magnificent, and had also been presented to him by this  monarch on the same occasion.    A remarkable thing in this formal change of residence was that the  acclamations and enthusiasm of the crowd, and even of the most  distinguished spectators, who filled the windows of rue Thionville and of  the quai Voltaire, were addressed only to the First Consul, and to the  young warriors of his brilliant staff, who were yet bronzed by the sun of  the Pyramids or of Italy. At their head rode General Lannes and Murat;  the first easy to recognize by his bold bearing and soldierly manners;  the second by the same qualities, and further by a striking elegance,  both of costume and equipments. His new title of brother-in-law of the  First Consul contributed, also, greatly to fix upon him the attention of  all. As for myself, all my attention was absorbed by the principal  personage of the cortege, whom, like every one around me, I regarded with  something like a religious reverence; and by his stepson, the son of my  excellent mistress, himself once my master,--the brave, modest, good  Prince Eugene, who at that time, however, was not yet a prince. On his  arrival at the Tuileries, the First Consul took possession at once of the  apartments which he afterwards occupied, and which were formerly part of  the royal apartments. These apartments consisted of a bed-chamber"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35802"],[0,"Lusitania: Canti popolari portoghesi (#7)"],[1,"ecc.,  p. 118; lo stesso, _De la poesia popular gallega_, in _Romania_, anno  VI, p. 68, ed altri. Ricorda qua e lÃ  il presente canto anche un'altra  bella romanza castigliana, che leggo, tradotta dal PUYMAIGRE, in  appendice al _Romanceiro_ (_Comment la reine fit tuer dona Isabel de  Liar_) p. 265.    Scrive il medesimo a p. 414, t. II, dei _Vieux auteurs castillans_: Â«Ce  comte, qui se croit obligÃ© d'accorder Ã  son roi la cruelle satisfaction  qu'on lui demande, qui sacrifie une femme qu'il aime Ã  un faux point  d'honneur, peut nous sembler monstrueux, impossible; mais, comme l'a  remarquÃ© Bouterwek, il n'est pas invraisemblable d'aprÃ¨s les moeurs et  les opinions du siÃ¨cle oÃ¹ l'action se passe. [Une loi antique permet en  effet au roi d'ordonner Ã  un vassal infidÃ¨le de tuer la femme qu'il a  Ã©pousÃ©e au mÃ©pris de la foi donnÃ©e Ã  une autre. BARET, _Les troubadours  et leur influence sur la littÃ©rature du Midi de l'Europe_, Paris, 1867,  p. 428]. Cette lÃ©gende, suivant Ticknor, est une des compositions les  plus pathÃ©tiques, les plus belles qu'il y ait dans aucune langue. Cet  Ã©loge n'est pas exagÃ©rÃ©; rien de plus Ã©mouvant que le retour du comte,  que son attitude Ã  table, que le soin qu'il prende de fermer, contre son  habitude, la chambre oÃ¹ il se retire avec sa femme. [Cfr. SHAKSPEARE,  _Othello_, Atto V, Sc. 2]. Comme, dans la derniÃ¨re scÃ¨ne de ce drame  horrible, la prÃ©sence du petit enfant Ã  qui sa mÃ¨re veut donner le sein  encore une fois, comme cette prÃ©sence augmente l'intÃ©rÃªt qui s'attache Ã   la victime!... Que de naturel dans les paroles de la comtesse demandant  Ã  se retirer chez son pÃ¨re pour y Ã©lever ses enfants mieux que celle qui  viendra!... Tous ces dÃ©tails, qui contribuent si bien Ã  l'effet de tout  le tableau, sont d'une vÃ©ritÃ© admirable, et n'ont pu Ãªtre trouvÃ©s que  par un poÃ«te. Cela est beau, cela est rÃ©ellement beau et poignant....  Desdemona, au moment oÃ¹ Othello lui demande si elle a fait sa priÃ¨re,  est moins touchante que la comtesse priant son mari de lui laisser dire  une petite oraison qu'elle sait.Â»    E dopo messo a riscontro della romanza spagnola del Conte Alarcos e  dell'Infanta Solisa la poesia portoghese, aggiunge a p. 407: Â«M. Almeida  Garret trouve ce romance supÃ©rieur au poÃ¨me espagnol: je ne saurais Ãªtre  de cet avis. La mÃ¨re est moins touchante dans le romance portugais; les  adieux qu'elle adresse Ã  ses fleurs, Ã  la fontaine de son jardin, sont  des lieux-communs; dans l'oeuvre castillane la comtesse ne pense qu'Ã   son fils, et ce sentiment est bien dans la nature: tout lugubre qu'il  soit, je prÃ©fÃ¨re aussi le dÃ©noÃ»ment de l'oeuvre espagnole [dove il conte  strangola in modo atroce la moglie, e tutti i colpevoli, citati da essa  davanti alla giustizia divina, muojono nel termine di trenta giorni],  sans toutefois les derniers vers relatifs Ã  l'accomplissement de  l'_ajournement_ prononcÃ© par la comtesse.Â» Io non presumo di sentenziare  _ex cathedra_ tra i due valentuomini; dico solo che la contessa del  canto lusitano, volgendo per poco il pensiero alle cose che insieme col  figlio le rallegravano la vita, non esce poi tanto fuori del naturale:  contro natura sarebbe se nell'animo suo l'amor delle rose, dei garofani,  delle chiare fresche e dolci acque, o che so io, vincesse o pareggiasse  quello del suo piccino. Ma come l'amor di questo prevale senza confronto  e giganteggia su gli altri, cosÃ­ il dolore della separazione oltre ogni  dire angosciosa, serba quella gradazione, che, non osservata, avrebbe  tolto davvero alla nostra romanza grandissima parte della sua bellezza.    Â«La fin du romance offre... des diffÃ©rences de dÃ©tails dans plusieurs  leÃ§ons. Dans une version catalane, sans doute peu ancienne, un ange  intervient, et apprend au mari, Ã  l'instant oÃ¹ il va tuer sa femme, que  Dieu a frappÃ© le roi et l'infant [V. PELAY BRIZ, _Cansons de la terra,  cants pop. catalans_, Barcelona, 1866-77, t. III, p. 33].Â» PUYMAIGRE,  _Romanceiro_, p. 235.    Â«L'Ã©pisode qui fait le sujet de notre romance a Ã©tÃ© plusieurs fois mis  au thÃ©Ã¢tre. Il l'a Ã©tÃ© en Allemagne par Schlegel, en Espagne par Guillen  de Castro, par Jose Milanez, par Mira de Mesca, sous le titre de _Conte  Alarcos_, et par Lope de Vega, sous celui de la _Fuerza lastimosa_. Dans  cette piÃ¨ce le dÃ©nouement est heureux. Ce n'est pas le comte Enrique  (Alarcos), comme le croyaient le roi et l'infante elle-mÃªme, qui a  surpris les faveurs de la princesse; c'est le duc Otavio. Le quiproquo  se dÃ©couvre Ã  temps pour que don Enrique ne soit pas contraint de tuer  sa femme, et le vrai coupable Ã©pouse l'infante.Â» Lo stesso, ivi, p.  234-35. Valga il vero; se uno scioglimento sÃ­ fatto potÃ© mandare a casa  contente le nervose damine ed i buoni borghesi di Madrid e di Siviglia,  si vede alla prima come non abbia quasi piÃº ombra di quel patetico e di  quella impareggiabile efficacia, che sollevano il rozzo canto popolare  alle piÃº gloriose altezze dell'arte.    Alcuni passi di questa romanza, come pure di altre, hanno corso anche  oggi sotto forma prosastica. V.

II, degli _Auteurs Castillans_: Â«.... on pensait que souvent les  enfants mÃªme Ã  la mamelle, pouvaient se trouver animÃ©s d'un Ã©sprit  prophÃ©tique, ou douÃ©s de la facultÃ© de la seconde vue, et qu'alors ils  parlaient miraculeusement.
