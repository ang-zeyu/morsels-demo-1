She sent for her a mulatto woman to whom she was much  attached, named Euphemie, who was the foster-sister of Madame Bonaparte,  and passed (I do not know if the supposition was correct) as her natural  sister. Euphemie, accompanied by Charvet, made the journey in one of  Madame Bonaparte's carriages. Mademoiselle Hortense, on their arrival,  was delighted with the journey she was about to make, and above all with  the idea of being near her mother, for whom she felt the tenderest  affection. Mademoiselle Hortense was, I would not say, greedy, but she  was exceedingly fond of sweets; and Charvet, in relating these details,  said to me, that at each town of any size through which they passed the  carriage was filled with bonbons and dainties, of which mademoiselle  consumed a great quantity. One day, while Euphemie and Charvet were  sound asleep, they were suddenly awakened by a report, which sounded  frightful to them, and caused them intense anxiety, as they found when  they awoke that they were passing through a thick forest. This ludicrous  incident threw Hortense into fits of laughter; for hardly had they  expressed their alarm when they found themselves deluged with an  odoriferous froth, which explained the cause of the explosion. A bottle  of champagne, placed in one of the pockets of the carriage, had been  uncorked; and the heat, added to the motion of the carriage, or rather  the malice of the young traveler, had made it explode with a loud report.    When mademoiselle arrived at Plombieres, her mother's health was almost  restored; so that the pupil of Madame Campan found there all the  distractions which please and delight at the age which the daughter of  Madame Bonaparte had then attained.    There is truth in the saying that in all evil there is good, for had this  accident not happened to Madame Bonaparte, it is very probable she would  have become a prisoner of the English; in fact, she learned that  'La Pomone', the vessel on which she wished to make the voyage, had  fallen into the power of the enemies of France. General Bonaparte, in  all his letters, still dissuaded his wife from the plan she had of  rejoining him; and, consequently, she returned to Paris.    On her arrival Josephine devoted her attention to executing a wish  General Bonaparte had expressed to her before leaving. He had remarked  to her that he should like, on his return, to have a country seat; and he  charged his brother to attend to this, which Joseph, however, failed to  do. Madame Bonaparte, who, on the contrary, was always in search of what  might please her husband, charged several persons to make excursions in  the environs of Paris, in order to ascertain whether a suitable dwelling  could be found. After having vacillated long between Ris and Malmaison,  she decided on the latter, which she bought from M. Lecoulteux-Dumoley,  for, I think, four hundred thousand francs. Such were the particulars  which Charvet was kind enough to give me when I first entered the service  of Madame Bonaparte. Every one in the house loved to speak of her; and  it was certainly not to speak evil, for never was woman more beloved by  all who surrounded her, and never has one deserved it more. General  Bonaparte was also an excellent man in the retirement of private life.    After the return of the First Consul from his campaign in Egypt, several  attempts against his life had been made; and the police had warned him  many times to be on his guard, and not to risk himself alone in the  environs of Malmaison. The First Consul had been very careless up to  this period; but the discovery of the snares which were laid for him,  even in the privacy of his family circle, forced him to use precautions  and prudence. It has been stated since, that these pretended plots were  only fabrications of the police to render themselves necessary to the  First Consul, or, perhaps, of the First Consul himself, to redouble the  interest which attached to his person, through fear of the perils which  menaced his life; and the absurdity of these attempts is alleged as proof  of this. I could not pretend to elucidate such mysteries; but it seems  to me that in such matters absurdity proves nothing, or, at least, it  does not prove that such plots did not exist. The conspirators of that  period set no bounds to their extravagance; for what could be more  absurd, and at the same time more real, than the atrocious folly of the  infernal machine?    Be that as it may, I shall relate what passed under my own eyes during  the first month of my stay at Malmaison. No one there, or, at least, no  one in my presence, showed the least doubt of the reality of these  attempts.    In order to get rid of the First Consul, all means appeared good to his  enemies: they noted everything in their calculations, even his absence of  mind. The following occurrence is proof of this:    There were repairs and ornamentations to be made to the mantel in the  rooms of the First Consul at Malmaison. The contractor in charge of this  work had sent marblecutters, amongst whom had slipped in, it seems, a few  miserable wretches employed by the conspirators. The persons attached to  the First Consul were incessantly on the alert, and exercised the  greatest watchfulness; and it was observed that among these workmen there  were men who pretended to work, but whose air and manner contrasted  strongly with their occupation. These suspicions were unfortunately only  too well founded; for when the apartments had been made ready to receive  the First Consul, and just as he was on the eve of occupying them, some  one making a final inspection found on the desk at which he would first  seat himself, a snuff-box, in every respect like one of those which he  constantly used. It was thought at first that this box really belonged  to him, and that it had been forgotten and left there by his valet; but  doubts inspired by the suspicious manner of a few of the marble-cutters,  leading to further investigation, the tobacco was examined and analyzed.  It was found to be poisoned.    The authors of this perfidy had, it is said, at this time, communication  with other conspirators, who engaged to attempt another means of ridding  themselves of the First Consul. They promised to attack the guard of the  chateau (Malmaison), and to carry off by force the chief of the  government. With this intention, they had uniforms made like those of  the consular guards, who then stood sentinel, day and night, over the  First Consul, and followed him on horseback in his excursions. In this  costume, and by the aid of signals, with their accomplices (the pretended  marble-cutters) on the inside, they could easily have approached and  mingled with the guard, who were fed and quartered at the chateau. They  could even have reached the First Consul, and carried him off. However,  this first project was abandoned as too uncertain; and the conspirators  flattered themselves that they would succeed in their undertaking more  surely, and with less danger, by taking advantage of the frequent  journeys of the First Consul to Paris. By means of their disguise they  planned to distribute themselves on the road, among the guides of the  escort, and massacre them, their rallying-point being the quarries of  Nanterre; but their plots were for the second time foiled. There was in  the park at Malmaison a deep quarry; and fears being entertained that  they would profit by it to conceal themselves therein, and exercise some  violence against the First Consul on one of his solitary walks, it was  decided to secure it with an iron door.    On the 19th of February, at one in the afternoon, the First Consul went  in state to the Tuileries, which was then called the Government palace,  to install himself there with all his household. With him were his two  colleagues; one of whom, the third consul, was to occupy the same  residence, and be located in the Pavilion de Flore. The carriage of the  consuls was drawn by six white horses, which the Emperor of Germany had  presented to the conqueror of Italy after the signature of the treaty of  peace of Campo-Formio. The saber that the First Consul wore at this  ceremony was magnificent, and had also been presented to him by this  monarch on the same occasion.    A remarkable thing in this formal change of residence was that the  acclamations and enthusiasm of the crowd, and even of the most  distinguished spectators, who filled the windows of rue Thionville and of  the quai Voltaire, were addressed only to the First Consul, and to the  young warriors of his brilliant staff, who were yet bronzed by the sun of  the Pyramids or of Italy. At their head rode General Lannes and Murat;  the first easy to recognize by his bold bearing and soldierly manners;  the second by the same qualities, and further by a striking elegance,  both of costume and equipments. His new title of brother-in-law of the  First Consul contributed, also, greatly to fix upon him the attention of  all. As for myself, all my attention was absorbed by the principal  personage of the cortege, whom, like every one around me, I regarded with  something like a religious reverence; and by his stepson, the son of my  excellent mistress, himself once my master,--the brave, modest, good  Prince Eugene, who at that time, however, was not yet a prince. On his  arrival at the Tuileries, the First Consul took possession at once of the  apartments which he afterwards occupied, and which were formerly part of  the royal apartments. These apartments consisted of a bed-chamber"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35802"],[0,"Lusitania: Canti popolari portoghesi (#7)"],[1,"ecc.,  p. 118; lo stesso, _De la poesia popular gallega_, in _Romania_, anno  VI, p. 68, ed altri. Ricorda qua e là il presente canto anche un'altra  bella romanza castigliana, che leggo, tradotta dal PUYMAIGRE, in  appendice al _Romanceiro_ (_Comment la reine fit tuer dona Isabel de  Liar_) p. 265.    Scrive il medesimo a p. 414, t. II, dei _Vieux auteurs castillans_: «Ce  comte, qui se croit obligé d'accorder à son roi la cruelle satisfaction  qu'on lui demande, qui sacrifie une femme qu'il aime à un faux point  d'honneur, peut nous sembler monstrueux, impossible; mais, comme l'a  remarqué Bouterwek, il n'est pas invraisemblable d'après les moeurs et  les opinions du siècle où l'action se passe. [Une loi antique permet en  effet au roi d'ordonner à un vassal infidèle de tuer la femme qu'il a  épousée au mépris de la foi donnée à une autre. BARET, _Les troubadours  et leur influence sur la littérature du Midi de l'Europe_, Paris, 1867,  p. 428]. Cette légende, suivant Ticknor, est une des compositions les  plus pathétiques, les plus belles qu'il y ait dans aucune langue. Cet  éloge n'est pas exagéré; rien de plus émouvant que le retour du comte,  que son attitude à table, que le soin qu'il prende de fermer, contre son  habitude, la chambre où il se retire avec sa femme. [Cfr. SHAKSPEARE,  _Othello_, Atto V, Sc. 2]. Comme, dans la dernière scène de ce drame  horrible, la présence du petit enfant à qui sa mère veut donner le sein  encore une fois, comme cette présence augmente l'intérêt qui s'attache à  la victime!... Que de naturel dans les paroles de la comtesse demandant  à se retirer chez son père pour y élever ses enfants mieux que celle qui  viendra!... Tous ces détails, qui contribuent si bien à l'effet de tout  le tableau, sont d'une vérité admirable, et n'ont pu être trouvés que  par un poëte. Cela est beau, cela est réellement beau et poignant....  Desdemona, au moment où Othello lui demande si elle a fait sa prière,  est moins touchante que la comtesse priant son mari de lui laisser dire  une petite oraison qu'elle sait.»    E dopo messo a riscontro della romanza spagnola del Conte Alarcos e  dell'Infanta Solisa la poesia portoghese, aggiunge a p. 407: «M. Almeida  Garret trouve ce romance supérieur au poème espagnol: je ne saurais être  de cet avis. La mère est moins touchante dans le romance portugais; les  adieux qu'elle adresse à ses fleurs, à la fontaine de son jardin, sont  des lieux-communs; dans l'oeuvre castillane la comtesse ne pense qu'à  son fils, et ce sentiment est bien dans la nature: tout lugubre qu'il  soit, je préfère aussi le dénoûment de l'oeuvre espagnole [dove il conte  strangola in modo atroce la moglie, e tutti i colpevoli, citati da essa  davanti alla giustizia divina, muojono nel termine di trenta giorni],  sans toutefois les derniers vers relatifs à l'accomplissement de  l'_ajournement_ prononcé par la comtesse.» Io non presumo di sentenziare  _ex cathedra_ tra i due valentuomini; dico solo che la contessa del  canto lusitano, volgendo per poco il pensiero alle cose che insieme col  figlio le rallegravano la vita, non esce poi tanto fuori del naturale:  contro natura sarebbe se nell'animo suo l'amor delle rose, dei garofani,  delle chiare fresche e dolci acque, o che so io, vincesse o pareggiasse  quello del suo piccino. Ma come l'amor di questo prevale senza confronto  e giganteggia su gli altri, cosí il dolore della separazione oltre ogni  dire angosciosa, serba quella gradazione, che, non osservata, avrebbe  tolto davvero alla nostra romanza grandissima parte della sua bellezza.    «La fin du romance offre... des différences de détails dans plusieurs  leçons. Dans une version catalane, sans doute peu ancienne, un ange  intervient, et apprend au mari, à l'instant où il va tuer sa femme, que  Dieu a frappé le roi et l'infant [V. PELAY BRIZ, _Cansons de la terra,  cants pop. catalans_, Barcelona, 1866-77, t. III, p. 33].» PUYMAIGRE,  _Romanceiro_, p. 235.    «L'épisode qui fait le sujet de notre romance a été plusieurs fois mis  au théâtre. Il l'a été en Allemagne par Schlegel, en Espagne par Guillen  de Castro, par Jose Milanez, par Mira de Mesca, sous le titre de _Conte  Alarcos_, et par Lope de Vega, sous celui de la _Fuerza lastimosa_. Dans  cette pièce le dénouement est heureux. Ce n'est pas le comte Enrique  (Alarcos), comme le croyaient le roi et l'infante elle-même, qui a  surpris les faveurs de la princesse; c'est le duc Otavio. Le quiproquo  se découvre à temps pour que don Enrique ne soit pas contraint de tuer  sa femme, et le vrai coupable épouse l'infante.» Lo stesso, ivi, p.  234-35. Valga il vero; se uno scioglimento sí fatto poté mandare a casa  contente le nervose damine ed i buoni borghesi di Madrid e di Siviglia,  si vede alla prima come non abbia quasi piú ombra di quel patetico e di  quella impareggiabile efficacia, che sollevano il rozzo canto popolare  alle piú gloriose altezze dell'arte.    Alcuni passi di questa romanza, come pure di altre, hanno corso anche  oggi sotto forma prosastica. V.

Trovo bensí rammentata la  Normandía qualche altra volta nell'antica letteratura spagnola; per es.,  al cap. XXII del _Don Paolo de Segovia_, romanzo di Francesco de  Quevedo-Villegas, dove parlasi di certa commediaccia composta da non so  quale istrione, in cui si vede un re del su mentovato paese farsi  eremita senza una ragione al mondo.]    [Nota 22: Fino al sec.

Fur._, C. 46, ott. 102.    «... voglio io che tu mi facci una grazia, che che di me s'avvegna, ove  tu non abbi certa novella della mia vita, che tu m'aspetti _un anno et  un mese et un dí_ senza rimaritarti ecc.» BOCCACCIO, _Decam._, Gior. X,  N. IX, p. 341-42 dell'ediz. di Parma, 1814.

Osservazione giustissima.]    [Nota 26: Il testo: «Adeus flor da Alexandria!» Spero che i lettori  intelligenti non vorranno farmi carico di questa piccola mutazione, che  a parer mio non riesce dannosa né all'effetto né al senso.]    [Nota 27:        «... e baciando il volto      del figliuolo innocente:      Questo [il sangue], disse, è quel latte      che ti può dare il petto      di tua madre infelice...»        SPERONI, _Canace e Macareo_, Atto V, sc. 4.]    [Nota 28: Anche la lezione galliziana citata piú sopra finisce in  maniera simile: «Moureu a filla do rey pela soberba que tinha: ecc.» E  il sig.

Osserva lo stesso ALMEIDA-GARRETT, nel suo _Romanceiro_ (ediz. del  1842-43, t. II, p. 54): «Este prodigio de fallarem os innocentes ao  peito das mães, nos grandes circumstancias públicas ou nas grandes  crises domesticas, era mui favorito dos nossos.» E il PUYMAIGRE, a p.  420, t. II, degli _Auteurs Castillans_: «.... on pensait que souvent les  enfants même à la mamelle, pouvaient se trouver animés d'un ésprit  prophétique, ou doués de la faculté de la seconde vue, et qu'alors ils  parlaient miraculeusement. Cette conviction était repandue dans des  contrées fort eloignées les unes des autres: elle existait en Suisse  comme en Portugal.» E cita: MARMIER, _Tradictions de la Suisse_, in  _Revue de Paris_, 1841, t. IX, e le _Diverses leçons_ de PIERRE DE  MESSIE, cap. XXI. Riporta infine il seguente passo del DE LOYER  (_Discours et Histoire des spectres, visions, et apparitions des esprits  anges démons et âmes_, Paris, MDCV) intorno ai giuochi dei fanciulli,  cui si soleva attribuire un che di profetico: «Certes, ces esbats  puérils ne sont guère sans prodige. Car tantost vous verrez les enfans  faire une longue létanie en rue comme s'ils conduisoient une pompe  funèbre. De là on tire un présage de quelque mortalité à venir. Et puis  tantost vous les verrez qu'ils porteront des enseignes et banderolles,  marcheront de rang, seront divisés en escadrons et se livreront  batailles les uns aux autres. Ils ont maintefois predit des guerres en  cette façon. Et quelquefois s'est trouvé que ces enfants soutenans en  leurs combats qui le party des amis, qui celuy des ennemys, faisoient  tomber le plus souvent le sort de la perte future de la bataille sur  ceux d'un des partis qui etoient demeurés vaincus.»--Mi torna a mente  quel verso di Giacomo Leopardi:        «Non so se il riso o la pietà prevale.»]    [Nota 29: «O romance de Sylvana é um dos mais sabidos em Portugal.
