There is no  contradiction in this. You can no more demonstrate its impossibility than  I can demonstrate mathematically that it is so. In metaphysics we scarcely  reason on anything but probabilities. We are all swimming in a sea of  which we have never seen the shore. Woe be to those who fight while they  swim! Land who can; but he that cries out to me, \"You swim in vain, there  is no land,\" disheartens me, and deprives me of all my strength. What is  the object of our dispute? To console our unhappy existence. Who consoles  it--you or I? You yourself own, in some passages of your work, that the  belief in a God has withheld some men on the brink of crime; for me this  acknowledgment is enough. If this opinion had prevented but ten  assassinations, but ten calumnies, but ten iniquitous judgments on the  earth, I hold that the whole earth ought to embrace it.' \"--_Voltaire's  Philosophical Dictionary._    This Voltaire says: \"The laws punished public crimes; it was necessary to  establish a check upon secret crimes; this check was to be found only in  religion.\" In the same article we find the following: \"We are obliged to  hold intercourse and transact business and mix up in life with knaves  possessing little or no reflection; with vast numbers of persons addicted  to brutality, intoxication and rapine. You may, if you please, preach to  them that there is no hell, and that the soul of man is mortal. As for  myself, I will be sure to thunder in their ears that if they rob me they  will inevitably be damned.\" His true position upon the hell question is,  that it is necessary to preach hell to the blind and brutal populace, that  there is a real necessity for such teaching, whether it be true or false.  He seems to regard it untrue, but necessary. What an idea! The harmony and  consistency of unbelievers is (?) grand. It is no wonder that Voltaire's  name should stand, along with the names of Atheists and Pantheists and  Deists, above the head line upon the first page of the _Boston  Investigator_.            IS GOD THE AUTHOR OF DECEPTION AND FALSEHOOD?      There is a want of fair dealing with Bible language manifested by all the  enemies of our religion. The unbelievers of our time will find it very  difficult for them to sustain the reputation of moral honesty and, at the  same time, retain many of the old, worn out objections which they have  urged against the Bible. They should remember that while the light of  scientific investigation is exposing the old, unscientific and  unscriptural tenets of the creeds of our forefathers, and making it hard  for candid, sensible men to defend them, it is also shedding light upon  Bible truth to such an extent that unbelievers are finding it equally  difficult to retain their silly objections to the Bible. They have  asserted from 1st Kings 32, that God kept false as well as true prophets.  This charge is not only without foundation in fact, but also false and  contemptible. The four hundred prophets mentioned in the sixth verse of  that chapter are emphatically denominated \"Ahab's prophets,\"  notwithstanding they professed to be the Lord's prophets. This wicked King  of Israel had those wicked, false prophets in his service. The address of  Micaiah to the two kings in verses 19-23 is a mere parable showing what,  in the providence of God, would shortly take place, and the divine  permission for the agents, spoken of, to act. Micaiah did not tell the mad  and impious Ahab that his prophets were all liars; but he represents the  whole by a parable, and, in language equally strong and inoffensive, he  says that which amounts to the same thing. Unbelievers of the schools of  modern spiritualism and Bostonian infidelity, both say that God inspired  prophets with false messages, and violated his own word.    The charge of inspiring prophets with false messages is founded,  pretendingly, upon 1st Kings 22: 22, 23, Jeremiah 4: 10, and Ezekiel 14:  9. To answer this, it is only necessary to know that it is an idiom of the  original languages to express, in the imperative active, that which is  simply permitted. Thus, when the devils begged permission to enter into  the herd of swine, Jesus said, \"_Go_\"--Mat. 8: 31.    And so we are to understand, John 13: 27, where Jesus says to Judas  Iscariot, \"What thou dost, _do quickly_.\" No man is thoroughly posted as a  Bible scholar who is honest in making the above charge. It is either  ignorance or dishonesty that causes men to thus oppose the record. As we  are not justifiable in saying that Jesus commanded his own betrayal, so we  are not justifiable in saying God commanded lying. Correct principles of  interpretation do not justify the unbeliever in any such blasphemy. When  an evil spirit offered himself to be a lying spirit in the mouth of a  wicked prophet--false prophet--God said, \"Go forth and do so,\" which only  signifies permission, not command. In Jeremiah 4: 10, where the prophet  complains that God had deceived them, saying, \"They should have peace,  when the sword reached to the soul,\" we are to understand that God  permitted the false prophets to deceive him, prophesying peace to the  people, as appears from the history (Ezekiel 14: 9). _I_, the _Lord_, have  deceived that prophet, that is, permitted him to be deceived, and  permitted him to deceive the people, as the legitimate result of their own  wickedness, and a just judgment upon them for their rejection of the  testimony of his true prophets. There is nothing strange about all this;  for as sure as there is a God, so sure it is that he permits wicked lying  men to be deceived in our own day. He has done this in all ages of the  world. In fact, it belongs to his ordained plan to permit, or suffer, men,  individually or collectively, to fall in their own deceptions and  wickedness. This he threatened in the above case, as you may see in the  fifth verse of Ezekiel 14, in these words, \"I will take the house of  Israel in their own heart, because they are all estranged from me through  their idols; because they have chosen to themselves false Gods, I will  _suffer them to be deceived_ with _false prophets_; and I will stretch out  my hand _upon him_, and I will _destroy him_ from the midst of my people.\"  _Destroy whom?_ Ans.--_The false prophet._    When the prophet of God mistook the promise of God, who told him, when he  commissioned him, that he would be with him, by which he understood that  he would be saved from all evils, he said, \"Thou hast deceived me, and I  was deceived.\" This prophet was now a derision, the people mocking him,  and in his passion and weakness he breaks forth in the above language. It  was simply his own mistake, or misunderstanding of God's promise. God had  not promised him that he should not meet with scorn and opposition and  persecution, but simply that they should not prevail against him, as we  may learn from the latter part of the first chapter. The second objection,  that the Lord violated his promise, is also founded in ignorance or  dishonesty; it is based upon the statements found in Joshua 13: 1, and  Judges 2: 20, 21, compared with Genesis 15: 18 and 18: 19, 20. In Joshua  13, it is said that there remained very much land yet unconquered, which  they had not taken possession of, notwithstanding the Lord had promised to  be with them, and to give them all the land remaining yet in the  possession of their enemies.    In Judges 2: 20, it is said that the people did not perform their part of  the covenant, and this is given as the reason why the Lord had not driven  out any more of the nations before them.    The covenant with Abraham was in consideration of his past faith and  obedience; yet it was suspended upon the future obedience of his  posterity. See Deut. 7: 12, 13 and 11: 22 to 24; and Judges 2 to 20. The  Lord gives the following as the reason why he had not given them a  complete fulfillment of the covenant upon his part, \"Because that this  people hath transgressed my covenant which I commanded their fathers, and  have not harkened to my voice, I also will not henceforth drive out any of  the nations which Joshua left when he died.\" There are none so blind as  those who will not see. When we find a promise from the Lord, and it is in  the positive form, that is, when its terms are not rested upon an  expressed condition, we are authorized to supply the condition which  involves the moral element in the divine government, viz: obedience upon  the part of man, or men, as the case may be. See Ezekiel 33: 13.            DARWINISM WEIGHED IN THE BALANCES.      Scientists who claim to be followers of Darwin in scientific investigation  are known as evolutionists. The majority of them seem to enjoy themselves  very much in opposing the statements of Moses respecting the creation. It  might be well for them to remember that Darwin himself was compelled by  his better sense to declare that science demands a miracle in order to the  existence of the living unit lying at the base of the series of evolution.  So after all it remains a fact that Darwinism is chained to miracle. If  Strauss had remembered this he need not have said, Darwin deserves to be  praised as one of the benefactors of the race because of having learned us  how to get rid of miracles. If there is any value in evolution against the  Bible it lies in the use that men make of it to destroy the idea that God  created man out of the dust of the earth and breathed into his nostrils  the breath of life. Where does Darwinism take you to to study the origin  of man? To the dust of the earth? _Not exactly!_ It takes you to the  _slime_ of the sea, or the _mud_ of the Nile, just one "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28075"],[0,"The Christian Foundation, Or, Scientific and Religious Journal, March, 1880 (#7)"],[1,"to think that  the earth contained the water; that the water was standing in the earth.  This was very natural, for people generally live upon the land. The Bible,  however, presented a different idea, saying, the earth was \"standing out  of the water and in the water.\"    When the Scriptures speak upon this subject they refer to the waters just  as a man would who never had any misgivings upon the subject of their  sufficiency. Their teachings are in harmony with recent scientific  discovery, and against old-fashioned unbelief.    Before Galileo's time men would have been regarded insane if they had  asserted the gravity of the air, but the Bible contained the fact. It was  laid away in Job 28: 25: \"For he looketh to the ends of the earth and  seeth under the whole heaven to make the weight for the winds; and he  weigheth the waters by measure.\"    The force that is required annually in nature to give us the upper waters,  to form the clouds, is estimated by Arago to be more than the labor of  four hundred million of able bodied men, continued two hundred thousand  years.--_Aunuaire du bur. des. longit._, 1835, p. 196.    The Scriptures speak of floods and disorders that unbelievers of the  bygone considered incredible, but in the present time geologists feel that  the half was not told, for they are unable to account for all the  destructions found in their investigations. The events known in the  geological history are only in harmony with the fact that our planet has  been subjected to immense submersions. They are scientifically described  thus: An internal fire which, raising the temperature of the seas and of  the deep waters, caused on the one side an enormous evaporation and  impetuous rains, as if the flood-gates of heaven were opened; and, on the  other, an irresistible dilation, which not only raised the waters from  their depths, broke up the fountains of the GREAT ABYSS, and raised its  powerful waves to the level of the highest mountains, but which caused  immense stratifications of calcareous carbonate, under the double pressure  of a great heat and a pressure equal to eight thousand  atmospheres.--_Gansen_, p. 195.    The same author gives us the following, which will be beneficial to the  scholar: \"Water is dilated 1-23 in passing from the temperature of ice  melting to that of water boiling. An elevation of from sixteen to  seventeen degrees Reaumer will then increase its volume 1-111. Now, we  find by an easy calculation that the quantity of water necessary to  submerge the earth to the height of 1-1000 of the radius of our globe is  equal to 1-333 of its entire volume, or 1-111 of its third. If, then, we  suppose that the one third of the terrestrial globe is metallic (at the  mean specific gravity of 12-1/2), that the second third is solid (at the  weight of 21), and that the remaining third is water; then, first, the  specific gravity of the entire globe will be equal to 5-1/2 (according to  the conclusions of Maskeline and of Cavendish); and, secondly, it will  have been sufficient for the submersion of the earth to the height of  6,368 metres, or 1,546 metres above Mount Blanc; that the temperature of  the mass of the water in the days of the deluge should have risen to  sixteen degrees Reaumer is a reasonable conclusion.\" This calculation also  has reference to the unnecessary idea that the flood was universal. But  why is it that a few men recognize the existence of a God omnipotent and  ridicule the flood?    The sufficiency of the ark is also called in question. Buffon says the  various species of four-footed animals may be reduced to two hundred and  fifty. And Dr. Hales shows conclusively that the ark had the capacity of  bearing forty-two thousand four hundred and thirteen tons. He says: Can we  doubt of it being sufficient to contain eight persons and about two  hundred and fifty pair of four-footed animals, together with all the  subsistence necessary for twelve months, with the fowls of the air and  such reptiles and insects as can not live in water? Besides places for the  beasts and birds and their provisions, Noah might find room in the third  story for thirty-six cabins occupied by household utensils, instruments of  husbandry, books, grains and seeds, for a kitchen, a hall, and a space of  about forty-eight cubits in length to walk in. In addition to all this, it  is conceded, by the very best minds conversant with ship building, that  Moses' description of the dimensions of the ark are the descriptions of  one of the very best floating vessels that ever rested upon the waters.  This fact has puzzled the minds of many unbelievers who seem to think  there was but little scientific knowledge in that early period. They do  not believe that God was with Noah. HE WAS.            THE MOSAIC LAW IN GREECE, IN ROME, AND IN THE COMMON LAW OF ENGLAND.      There is no logical reason against the thought that God gave to man law in  the gift of speech or language. Speech is not natural to man. He does not  express his feelings and passions with sighs and groans systematically and  invariably as do the lower animals. The speechless child has no order of  this kind; the lower kingdom differs widely from man in this respect; the  same animals have the same manner of expressing their feelings and  passions throughout the world; but man has language to express _ideas_.  Infants learn to speak by imitation; they do not speak naturally. Language  is the result of education, of the imitative faculty of man. \"It has been  experimentally demonstrated that a man who has never heard the  articulations of the human voice can never speak.\" So deafness always  carries dumbness along with it when that deafness is from birth, or  contracted in early childhood. I have in my mind at the present moment two  bright-eyed girls in their \"teens,\" who contracted deafness in infancy  from the spotted fever; both are destitute of speech. If there ever was a  language of nature it was abandoned when artificial language was taught.  The greatest philosophers have failed to account for the origin of  language or speech. The Pagans have declared that it was a gift from the  gods. If all the inhabitants of the world could be congregated, and all  would consent to the use of one and the same vocabulary, then we might,  through universal training in that vocabulary, have an universal language.  How could such a convention be assembled? The truth is, the origin of  language or speech is neither natural or conventional, but imitative, and  it is a fact, beyond the possibility of cavil, that the thing must have  existed before it could have been imitated. With whom did it exist? \"We  think by words, and infants think by things.\" Words were from God.    Two lessons we must have as a capital to work with, and all else that we  need will grow legitimately out of exercise in those two. \"First, The  elementary ideas. Second, The elementary words significant to them.\" Such  was doubtless given man, as the Bible teaches, as a capital stock, and all  languages are, directly or indirectly, from this original stock, and its  results upon the human understanding; for who can set limits to  possibilities of the human mind when once it is furnished with a capital  stock and learned the art of its use? In Europe twenty-seven languages are  known, which are kindred branches from three roots, and these three roots  are scions of one stock; all languages are traceable to one stock. The  Bible _alone_ accounts for the origin of speech, which was, doubtless, the  origin of law. Chaldea, Media, Persia, Phoenicia and Egypt, under the  sovereignty of Chedorlaomer, had everything in legislative knowledge to  learn from the Hebrews. This \"Chedorlaomer was king of Elam, in Persia, in  the times of Abraham. He made the cities in the region of the Dead Sea his  tributaries; and on their rebelling he came with four allied kings and  overran the whole country south and east of the Jordan. Lot was among his  captives, but was rescued by Abraham.\" _See Zell's Encyclopedia._  Lycurgus, a celebrated legislator of Sparta, who was born 926 years before  Christ, gave an agrarian law that finds its prototype, without its  defects, in the agrarian law of the Hebrews. Solon, one of the seven wise  men of Greece, who died 558 years before Christ, transcribed, from the  laws of Moses, the laws prohibiting certain degrees in marriage. The laws  of descent, among the Grecians, are almost identical with the laws of  descent among the Jews. The Grecians borrowed many laws from the Hebrews.  They had their harvest vintage festival; the presentation of the best of  their flocks; the offering of their first fruits, and the portion  prescribed to their priests; the law against garments of divers colors;  protection from violence to the man who fled to their altars; the law  prohibiting all from the altar who had touched a dead body or any other  impurity; the law prohibiting from the priesthood all those having  blemishes upon their persons. All these laws, found in the Athenian code,  had their origin with the laws of the Hebrews--were taken from Moses.    During the reign of Artaxerxes Longimanus, who was the brother of Darius,  and who ascended the throne of the kingdom of Persia in the year 465  before Christ, the Jews were scattered all over the kingdom of Persia, and  their laws were the subject of conversation and notoriety. Haman speaks of  them to the king as differing from the laws of all other people.    The oldest and most noted legislators and wise men took their laws from  the law of Moses. The Egyptians and the Phoenicians borrowed from the  Jewish laws. Ancient and modern writers affirm that the individuals  commissioned by the Senate and tribune under Justinian to form the \"Twelve  Tables\" were directed to examine the laws of Athens and the Grecian  cities. This took them at once to the consideration of many of the laws of  Moses. Zell, in his "]]]
