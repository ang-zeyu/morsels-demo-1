A few may be seen in our  parks, and now and then children have picked up the bright dead form  from the green grass, and wondered what might be its name. Compare it  with the Redbird, with which it is often confounded, and the contrast  will be striking.    His call is a warble, broken by a pensive call note, sounding like the  syllables _chip-churr_, and he is regarded as a superior musician.    \"Passing through an orchard, and seeing one of these young birds that  had but lately left the nest, I carried it with me for about half a  mile to show it to a friend, and having procured a cage,\" says Wilson,  \"hung it upon one of the large pine trees in the Botanic Garden,  within a few feet of the nest of an Orchard Oriole, which also  contained young, hoping that the charity and kindness of the Orioles  would induce them to supply the cravings of the stranger. But charity  with them as with too many of the human race, began and ended at home.  The poor orphan was altogether neglected, and as it refused to be fed  by me, I was about to return it to the place where I had found it,  when, toward the afternoon, a Scarlet Tanager, no doubt its own  parent, was seen fluttering around the cage, endeavoring to get in.  Finding he could not, he flew off, and soon returned with food in his  bill, and continued to feed it until after sunset, taking up his  lodgings on the higher branches of the same tree. In the morning, as  soon as day broke, he was again seen most actively engaged in the  same manner, and, notwithstanding the insolence of the Orioles, he  continued his benevolent offices the whole day, roosting at night as  before. On the third or fourth day he seemed extremely solicitous for  the liberation of his charge, using every expression of distressful  anxiety, and every call and invitation that nature had put in his  power, for him to come out. This was too much for the feelings of my  friend. He procured a ladder, and mounting to the spot where the bird  was suspended, opened the cage, took out his prisoner, and restored  him to liberty and to his parent, who, with notes of great exultation,  accompanied his flight to the woods.\"          [Illustration: From col. F. M. Woodruff. SCARLET TANAGER.]      THE SCARLET TANAGER.      What could be more beautiful to see than this bird among the green  leaves of a tree? It almost seems as though he would kindle the dry  limb upon which he perches. This is his holiday dress. He wears it  during the nesting season. After the young are reared and the summer  months gone, he changes his coat. We then find him dressed in a dull  yellowish green--the color of his mate the whole year.    Do you remember another bird family in which the father bird changes  his dress each spring and autumn?    The Scarlet Tanager is a solitary bird. He likes the deep woods, and  seeks the topmost branches. He likes, too, the thick evergreens. Here  he sings through the summer days. We often pass him by for he is  hidden by the green leaves above us.    He is sometimes called our \"Bird of Paradise.\"    Tanagers feed upon winged insects, caterpillars, seeds, and berries.  To get these they do not need to be on the ground. For this reason it  is seldom we see them there.    Both birds work in building the nest, and both share in caring for the  little ones. The nest is not a very pretty one--not pretty enough for  so beautiful a bird, I think. It is woven so loosely that if you were  standing under it, you could see light through it.    Notice his strong, short beak. Now turn to the picture of the  Rose-Breasted Grosbeaks in April BIRDS. Do you see how much alike they  are? They are near relatives.    I hope that you may all have a chance to see a Scarlet Tanager dressed  in his richest scarlet and most jetty black.          THE RUFFED GROUSE.      The Ruffed Grouse, which is called Partridge in New England and  Pheasant in the Middle and Southern States, is the true Grouse, while  Bob White is the real Partridge. It is unfortunate that they continue  to be confounded. The fine picture of his grouseship, however, which  we here present should go far to make clear the difference between  them.    The range of the Ruffed Grouse is eastern United States, south to  North Carolina, Georgia, Mississippi, and Arkansas. They hatch in  April, the young immediately leaving the nest with the mother. When  they hear the mother's warning note the little ones dive under leaves  and bushes, while she leads the pursuer off in an opposite direction.  Building the nest and sitting upon the eggs constitute the duties of  the female, the males during this interesting season keeping separate,  not rejoining their mates until the young are hatched, when they begin  to roam as a family.    Like the Turkey, the Ruffed Grouse has a habit of pluming and  strutting, and also makes the drumming noise which has caused so much  discussion. This noise \"is a hollow vibrating sound, beginning softly  and increasing as if a small rubber ball were dropped slowly and then  rapidly bounced on a drum.\" While drumming the bird contrives to make  himself invisible, and if seen it is difficult to get the slightest  clue to the manner in which the sound is produced. And observers say  that it beats with its wings on a log, that it raises its wings and  strikes their edges above its back, that it claps them against its  sides like a crowing rooster, and that it beats the air. The writer  has seen a grouse drum, appearing to strike its wings together over  its back. But there is much difference of opinion on the subject, and  young observers may settle the question for themselves. When preparing  to drum he seems fidgety and nervous and his sides are inflated.  Letting his wings droop, he flaps them so fast that they make one  continuous humming sound. In this peculiar way he calls his mate, and  while he is still drumming, the hen bird may appear, coming slyly from  the leaves.    The nest is on the ground, made by the female of dry leaves and a few  feathers plucked from her own breast. In this slight structure she  lays ten or twelve cream-colored eggs, specked with brown.    The eyes of the Grouse are of great depth and softness, with deep  expanding pupils and golden brown iris.    Coming suddenly upon a young brood squatted with their mother near a  roadside in the woods, an observer first knew of their presence by the  old bird flying directly in his face, and then tumbling about at his  feet with frantic signs of distress and lameness. In the meantime the  little ones scattered in every direction and were not to be found. As  soon as the parent was satisfied of their safety, she flew a short  distance and he soon heard her clucking call to them to come to her  again. It was surprising how quickly they reached her side, seeming to  pop up as from holes in the ground.          [Illustration: From col. F. M. Woodruff. RUFFED GROUSE.]      THE RUFFED GROUSE.      At first sight most of you will think this is a turkey. Well, it does  look very much like one. He spreads his tail feathers, puffs himself  up, and struts about like a turkey. You know by this time what his  name is and I think you can easily see why he is called Ruffed.    This proud bird and his mate live with us during the whole year. They  are found usually in grassy lands and in woods.    Here they build their rude nest of dried grass, weeds and the like.  You will generally find it at the foot of a tree, or along side of an  old stump in or near swampy lands.    The Ruffed Grouse has a queer way of calling his mate. He stands on a  log or stump, puffed up like a turkey--just as you see him in the  picture. Then he struts about for a time just as you have seen a  turkey gobbler do. Soon he begins to work his wings--slowly at first,  but faster and faster, until it sounds like the beating of a drum.    His mate usually answers his call by coming. They set up housekeeping  and build their rude nest which holds from eight to fourteen eggs. As  soon as the young are hatched they can run about and find their own  food. So you see they are not much bother to their parents. When they  are a week old they can fly. The young usually stay with their parents  until next Spring. Then they start out and find mates for themselves.    I said at the first that the Ruffed Grouse stay with us all the year.  In the winter, when it is very cold, they burrow into a snowdrift to  pass the night. During the summer they always roost all night.          THE BLACK AND WHITE CREEPING WARBLER.      This sprightly little bird is met with in various sections of the  country. It occurs in all parts of New England and New York, and has  been found in the interior as far north as Fort Simpson. It is common  in the Bahamas and most of the West India Islands, generally as a  migrant; in Texas, in the Indian Territory, in Mexico, and throughout  eastern America.    Dr. Coues states that this warbler is a very common summer resident  near Washington, the greater number going farther north to breed. They  arrive there during the first week in April and are exceedingly  numerous until May.    In its habits this bird seems to be more of a creeper than a Warbler.  It is an expert and nimble climber, and rarely, if ever, perches  on the branch of a tree or shrub. In the manner of the smaller  Woodpecker, the Creepers, Nuthatches, and Titmice, it moves rapidly  around the trunks and larger limbs of the trees of the forest in  search of small insects and their larvae. It is graceful and rapid in  movement, and is often so intent upon its hunt as to be unmindful of  the near presence of man.    It is found chiefly in thickets, where its food is most easily  obtained, and has been known to breed in the immediate vicinity of a  dwelling.    The song of this Warbler is sweet and pleasing. It begins to sing from  its first appearance in May and continues to repeat"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30667"],[0,"The Tale of Old Dog Spot (#7)"],[1," feet.    \"Where did they go?\" he demanded.    \"Ah!\" Mr. Crow croaked. \"That's telling.\" And he would say no more.    Then Spot went back to the farmyard.    Meanwhile the Woodchuck family were working hard, digging a new home for  themselves at the other end of the pasture. They had all met at last on  the edge of the clover patch. And Mr. Woodchuck had declared that they  must move at once, because it wasn't safe to live in their old house any  longer. He said that old dog Spot would be sure to keep an eye on it for  some time.    They soon found a place that suited them all very well.    \"We'll live here,\" said Mr. Woodchuck to his wife and their son Billy.  \"You two can take turns digging while I sit up and watch for old dog  Spot. After all the running I did to-day it wouldn't be safe for me to  do any digging.\"    That was Mr. Woodchuck's plan. And they followed it.          XIX    OFF FOR THE CIRCUS      Great circus posters had covered one side of Farmer Green's barn for  weeks. Ever since some men came and pasted them on the barn Johnnie  Green had studied them carefully. He had practiced bareback riding on  his pony, Twinkleheels. He had tried a high dive into the mill pond from  the top of the dam. And much to old dog Spot's disgust Johnnie had tried  to make him jump through a hoop covered with paper.    Spot had refused flatly to do anything of the kind. If he had known that  his young master had half a notion to teach him to jump through a hoop  of fire Spot would have run away--at least until circus time had come  and gone.    \"What puts all these queer ideas into Johnnie's head?\" the old dog asked  his friend Ebenezer, the horse, one day.    \"Don't you know?\" said Ebenezer. \"It's those circus pictures. Johnnie  won't think of anything else until the twenty-third of August.\"    \"What's going to happen then?\" Spot inquired.    \"That's the day when the circus comes to the village,\" the old horse  explained. \"The whole family's going to see it.\"    \"Do you expect to take them?\"    \"No!\" Ebenezer replied. \"Farmer Green will hitch the bays to the  carryall. And to tell the truth, I'll be just as pleased to stay behind.  It will be a great day to take naps here at home.\"    \"It will be a lonesome day, with everybody away,\" said Spot. \"I believe  I'll go to the circus myself.\"    \"Farmer Green may decide to leave you here,\" the old horse suggested.    \"Then I'll surprise him,\" said Spot. \"I'll hide behind a tree until  Farmer Green has driven out of the yard. And then I'll follow the  carryall.\"    The old dog began to tell everybody in the farmyard that he was going to  the circus on the twenty-third of August. Of course some of the farmyard  folk were jealous of him. The Rooster remarked that he didn't believe  Spot would hear any _crowing_ at the circus that would be worth  listening to. Turkey Proudfoot said that when it came to _strutting_ the  circus couldn't show Spot any that couldn't be beaten right there on the  farm. And Henrietta Hen, who went to the county fair the year before,  declared that she shouldn't care to go to the village except to see a  poultry show.    But old dog Spot didn't mind anything they said. And when the  twenty-third of August came he lingered about the farmyard. Early in the  morning he saw Farmer Green run the carryall into the yard and harness  the bays to it. Then the rest of the family came out of the house.    Spot, from his hiding place behind a tree, was pleased to see that  Johnnie Green did not forget to bring a big lunch basket with him.    At last everybody was ready to start. And then, to Spot's dismay, Farmer  Green caught sight of his nose, sticking out from behind a tree.    \"That dog means to follow us,\" he cried. \"I'll have to shut him up in  the barn.\" And to old Spot he called, \"Come here, sir!\"    Spot didn't dare disobey. With his tail between his legs he crept up to  the carryall. And though he whined and begged to be taken to the circus,  Farmer Green caught hold of his collar and led him into the barn. Then  Farmer Green closed the door.    Poor Spot had to give one loud howl when he heard the wheels of the  carryall crunching on the gravel driveway.          XX    SPOT GOES TO TOWN      The bays had to step lively that morning, for Farmer Green's family  didn't want to be late for the circus parade in the village.    There were many other teams on the road, and almost nobody to be seen  working in the fields. It seemed to Johnnie Green as if everybody had  made up his mind to go to the circus. The only thing that troubled him  was that his father didn't drive fast enough to suit him.    Half way from the farm to the village Farmer Green stopped the bays at a  watering trough. Johnnie jumped out of the carryall to uncheck them, so  they could drink. And there, beneath the carriage, was old dog Spot!    \"Spot's followed us!\" Johnnie Green cried.    The old dog whisked out from between the wheels and frolicked about  Johnnie. He didn't act at all guilty.    \"Well, I never!\" said Farmer Green. \"I certainly shut the barn door  after I shoved him inside.\"    Spot gave a few short, sharp barks, as if to say, \"Yes! But you forgot  the window that was open.\"    He had scrambled through the window and overtaken the carryall before it  reached the gristmill.    Well, what could Farmer Green do? They had come too far to send Spot  back home.    \"We'll have to take him with us now,\" said Johnnie Green's father,  \"though he'll be a nuisance because the village will be crowded to-day.\"    As soon as the bays had had their drink the party started on again. And  old dog Spot was content. He did not mind the dust that the bays' heels  kicked up as he followed beneath the carriage. And the faster they  trotted, the more they pleased him; for he was as anxious as Johnnie  Green to get to town and see the crowds and the fun.    Once a surly dog ran out from a farmhouse and tried to reach him. That  made Spot somewhat uneasy.    \"I don't want to stop to fight this fellow,\" he thought. \"If I do, I'll  be left behind.\"    Luckily Farmer Green cut at the strange dog with his whip and bade him  be off.    Spot grinned as he sneaked away, yelping.    At last they entered the village. Main Street was thronged with people.  Carriages and wagons of all sorts lined the road on both  sides--glistening buggies with red ribbons tied in bows about the whip  stocks, old lumber wagons with chairs set behind the driver's seat.    Johnnie Green had never seen such a gathering--not even at the fair.    \"The whole county's here!\" he exclaimed. \"I hope we'll find a good place  to stop, where we can see the parade.\"    They did. Farmer Green backed the bays into the last open space in the  gutter. And Johnnie Green was greatly relieved.    The crowd made such a roar, with its talking and laughter, that old Spot  cowered down under the carryall and almost wished he had stayed at home.  The cries of men selling peanuts and popcorn, squawkers and toy  balloons, mingled with the shouts of small boys and the squeals of their  sisters.    \"Goodness!\" Spot murmured. \"What a racket! It hurts my ears.\"    A moment later he stuck his nose out from beneath the carriage and burst  into a mournful howl.    \"Keep still!\" Farmer Green ordered.    Little did he know, then, what made Spot cry like that. But in a minute  or two Johnnie Green heard the same thing that Spot's sharp ears had  caught first. And Johnnie howled too.    \"Hear the band!\" he shouted. \"Hurrah! The parade's coming!\"          XXI    THE CIRCUS PARADE      The crash and blare of the circus band came nearer and nearer. Johnnie  Green craned his neck out of the carryall, as it stood at the side of  Main Street, and tried to get a glimpse of the parade.    Old dog Spot did not howl again, but stole out beside the bays and  looked up the street too.    Soon a man with a tall, shiny hat on his head rode a proud, prancing  horse around a corner. And behind him six more horses with gay plumes on  their bridles made a wide turn as they swung into view. On top of the  high red wagon that they drew sat the band, all in red suits and  playing away like mad.    Spot couldn't help whining. Although the bandsmen were playing the  liveliest air they knew, music always made Spot sad. And he was glad  when the band wagon had passed on.    Other wagons, blazoned with red and gold, followed.    Old dog Spot's hair began to rise along his back and he sniffed,  growling. He had noticed a strange mixture of the queerest odors. He  didn't know, for a moment, whether to run away or not.    \"Oh, see the tiger!\" Johnnie Green shouted. \"And the lions! And the  monkeys! And the bear!\"    \"_See_ them!\" Spot yelped. \"I say, _smell_ them!\"    He felt better when the animals in their cages had gone creaking past.  And he forgot his uneasiness as he watched dozens of horses, ridden by  folk whose bespangled clothes glittered in the sunlight.    Then came a funny man in a little, two-wheeled cart, driving a donkey.  This was the clown. He bowed and smiled to everybody, right and left,  and even threw kisses at some of the girls. His painted face, his  bag-like clothes, and his odd little round, pointed hat made Johnnie  Green laugh. And to Johnnie's great delight, when the clown saw Spot he  whistled.    Old Spot was all for dashing out into the street. But Farmer Green  wouldn't let him do that. Spot had to be content with barking at the  clown.    Then a man on a brisk little horse came down the street. He had a big  voice. And he kept using it all the time, shouting so everybody would  be sure to hear, \"Look out for your bosses! The elephants are coming!\"    And they came. The elephants came. When Spot saw their huge forms  plodding down Main Street he dived beneath the carryall again and  shivered until the last one had passed along.    The bays stirred restlessly as the elephants neared them. And the  younger of the pair snorted with fear.    Farmer Green"]]]
