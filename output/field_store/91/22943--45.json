It is  startlingly suggestive of disturbed yellow-jackets, but when you move  around the trunk in cautious reconnoissance, you discover the round  portal of a flicker's home, and the sound resolves itself into  harmlessness. It is only the callow young clamoring for food, or  complaining of their circumscribed quarters.    Not many days hence they will be out in the wide world of air and  sunshine of which they now know as little as when they chipped the  shell. Lusty fellows they will be then, with much of their parents'  beauty already displayed in their bright new plumage and capable of an  outcry that will hold a bird-eating cat at bay. A little later they will  be, as their parents are, helpful allies against the borers, the  insidious enemies of our apple-tree. It is a warfare which the  groundling habits of the golden-wings make them more ready to engage in  than any other of the woodpecker clans.    In sultry August weather, when the shrill cry of the cicada pierces the  hot air like a hotter needle of sound, and the dry husky beat of his  wings emphasizes the apparent fact of drouth as you walk on the  desiccated slippery herbage of meadow and pasture, the golden-wings with  all their grown-up family fly up before you from their feast on the ant  hills and go flashing and flickering away like rockets shot aslant, into  the green tent of the wild cherry trees to their dessert of juicy black  fruit.    Early in the dreariness of November, they have vanished with all the  horde of summer residents who have made the season of leaf, flower, and  fruit the brighter by their presence. The desolate leafless months go  by, till at last comes the promise of spring, and you are aware of a  half unconscious listening for the golden-wings. Presently the loud,  long, joyous iteration breaks upon your ear, and you hail the  fulfillment of the promise and the blithe new comer, a golden link in  the lengthening chain that is encircling the earth.          XV    JUNE DAYS      June brings skies of purest blue, flecked with drifts of silver, fields  and woods in the flush of fresh verdure, with the streams winding among  them in crystal loops that invite the angler with promise of more than  fish, something that tackle cannot lure nor creel hold.    The air is full of the perfume of locust and grape bloom, the spicy odor  of pine and fir, and of pleasant voices--the subdued murmur of the  brook's changing babble, the hum of bees, the stir of the breeze, the  songs of birds. Out of the shady aisles of the woods come the flute note  of the hermit thrush, the silvery chime of the tawny thrush; and from  the forest border, where the lithe birches swing their shadows to and  fro along the bounds of wood and field, comes that voice of June, the  cuckoo's gurgling note of preparation, and then the soft, monotonous  call that centuries ago gave him a name.    General Kukushna the exiles in Siberia entitle him; and when they hear  his voice, every one who can break bounds is irresistibly drawn to  follow him, and live for a brief season a free life in the greenwood. As  to many weary souls and hampered bodies there, so to many such here  comes the voice of the little commander, now persuasive, now imperative,  not to men and women in exile or wearing the convict's garb, but  suffering some sort of servitude laid upon them or self-imposed. Toiling  for bread, for wealth, for fame, they are alike in bondage--chained to  the shop, the farm, the desk, the office.    Some who hear, obey, and revel in the brief but delightful freedom of  June days spent in the perfumed breath of full-leafed woods, by cold  water-brooks and rippled lakes. Others listen with hungry hearts to the  summons, but cannot loose their fetters, and can only answer with a  sigh, \"It is not for me,\" or \"Not yet,\" and toil on, still hoping for  future days of freedom.    But saddest of all is the case of such as hear not, or, hearing, heed  not the voice of the Kukushna, the voices of the birds, the murmurous  droning of bees amid the blossoms, the sweet prattle of running waters  and dancing waves. Though these come to them from all about, and all  about them are unfolded the manifold beauties of this joyous month, no  sign is made to them. Their dull ears hear not the voices of nature,  neither do their dim eyes see the wondrous miracle of spring which has  been wrought all about them. Like the man with the muck-rake, they toil  on, intent only upon the filth and litter at their feet. Sad indeed must  it be to have a soul so poor that it responds to no caress of nature,  sadder than any imposition of servitude or exile which yet hinders not  one's soul from arising with intense longing for the wild world of woods  and waters when Kukushna sounds his soft trumpet call.          XVI    THE BULLFROG      The flooded expanse of the marshes has shrunken perceptibly along its  shoreward boundaries, leaving a mat of dead weeds, bits of driftwood,  and a water-worn selvage of bare earth to mark its widest limits. The  green tips of the rushes are thrust above the amber shallows, whereon  flotillas of water-shield lie anchored in the sun, while steel-blue  devil's-needles sew the warm air with intangible threads of zigzag  flight.    The meshed shadows of the water-maples are full of the reflections of  the green and silver of young leaves. The naked tangle of button-bushes  has become a green island, populous with garrulous colonies of redwings.  The great flocks of wild ducks that came to the reopened waters have had  their holiday rest, and journeyed onward to summer homes and cares in  the further north. The few that remain are in scattered pairs and  already in the silence and seclusion of nesting. You rarely see the  voyaging muskrat or hear his plaintive love calls.    Your ear has long been accustomed to the watery clangor of the bittern,  when a new yet familiar sound strikes it, the thin, vibrant bass of the  first bullfrog's note. It may be lacking in musical quality, but it is  attuned to its surroundings, and you are glad that the green-coated  player has at last recovered his long-submerged banjo, and is twanging  its water-soaked strings in prelude to the summer concert. He is a  little out of practice, and his instrument is slightly out of tune, but  a few days' use will restore both touch and resonance, when he and his  hundred brethren shall awaken the marsh-haunting echoes and the sleeping  birds with a grand twilight recital. It will reach your ears a mile  away, and draw you back to the happy days of boyhood, when you listened  for the bullfrogs to tell that fish would bite, and it was time for boys  to go a-fishing.    In the first days of his return to the upper world of water, this old  acquaintance may be shy, and neither permit nor offer any familiarity.  The fixed placidity of his countenance is not disturbed by your  approach, but if you overstep by one pace what he considers the proper  limit, down goes his head under cover of the flood. Marking his jerky  course with an underwake and a shiver of the rushes, he reappears, to  calmly observe you from a safer distance.    Custom outwears his diffidence, and the fervid sun warms him to more  genial moods, when he will suffer you to come quietly quite close to him  and tickle his sides with a bullrush, till in an ecstasy of pleasure he  loses all caution, and bears with supreme contentment the titillation of  your finger tips. His flabby sides swell with fullness of enjoyment, his  blinking eyes grow dreamy and the corners of his blandly expressionless  mouth almost curve upward with an elusive smile. Not till your fingers  gently close upon him does he become aware of the indiscretion into  which he has lapsed, and with a frantic struggle he tears himself away  from your grasp and goes plunging headlong into his nether element,  bellowing out his shame and astonishment.    Another day as you troll along the channel an oar's length from the  weedy borders, you see him afloat on his lily-pad raft, heeding you no  more than does the golden-hearted blossom whose orange odor drifts about  him, nor is he disturbed by splash of oar nor dip of paddle, nor even  when his bark and her perfume-freighted consort are tossed on your  undulating wake.    As summer wanes you see and hear him less frequently, but he is still  your comrade of the marshes, occasionally announcing his presence with a  resonant twang and a jerky splash among the sedges.    The pickerel weeds have struck their blue banners to the conquering  frost, and the marshes are sere, and silent, and desolate. When they are  warmed again with the new life of spring, we shall listen for the  jubilant chorus of our old acquaintance, the bullfrog.          XVII    THE ANGLER      I    Angling is set down by the master of the craft, whom all revere but none  now follow, as the Contemplative Man's Recreation; but is the angler,  while angling, a contemplative man?    That beloved and worthy brother whose worm-baited hook dangles in quiet  waters, placid as his mind--till some wayfaring perch, or bream, or  bullhead shall by chance come upon it, he, meanwhile, with rod set in  the bank, taking his ease upon the fresh June sward, not touching his  tackle nor regarding it but with the corner of an eye--he may  contemplate and dream day dreams. He may watch the clouds drifting  across the blue, the green branches waving between him and them,  consider the lilies of the field, note the songs of the catbird in the  willow thicket, watch the poise and plunge of the kingfisher, and so  spend all the day with nature and his own lazy thoughts. That is what he  came for. Angling with him is only a pretense, an excuse to pay a visit  to the great mother whom he so dearly loves; and if he carries"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/36866"],[0,"South Africa and the Transvaal War, Vol. 3 (of 8) (#7)"],[1,"to point to the fact that there was no longer  occasion for him to be judged by appearances. We knew the inner man now.  He did his duty grandly, and his splendid courage and perseverance had  made him independent of the pomp and panoply of war. In the matter of  \"grit\" they were all alike. But in externals they had curious  differences, their characteristics varying considerably according to the  regiment to which they belonged. Some were dapper still--the newly  arrived ones--with hair clipped to an eighth of an inch for head and  half an inch for moustache; others had succumbed to circumstances, and  had grown beards of odd sizes and shapes and colours (scumbled in all  cases with dust), while the youngsters displayed an unhappy medium,  styled by an officer \"pieces of unexpected wool,\" on promiscuous parts  of their faces! Still, when all was said, joviality and \"grit\" put an  identical veneer on them all!    The officers too were transmogrified. They were dressed exactly like the  men. Tan brown belts, swords, and revolvers were no longer in evidence.  When going off to war, or any other duty at all under arms, each officer  arrayed himself in his servant's belt and equipment--stained with clay  paste to the prevalent dust or kharki colour--and took with him his  servant's rifle and one hundred rounds of ammunition. There was a  difference without a distinction. The officer carried a field-glass, and  this when not in use was concealed in a coat-pocket. Every precaution  was now adopted to prevent them from inviting an undue share of  attention. The mounted officers had carbines--neat, handy weapons, which  slipped into a leather carbine bucket in the saddle, on the other side  of which went the very necessary wire-cutters. Barbed wire entanglements  were so much a part of the Boer programme--\"to cheer you up in crossing  the drifts,\" some one said--that the cutters became an essential part of  warlike gear. A strange innovation this; very small but very full of  meaning. The Boers were teaching us a great deal. We were beginning to  understand, almost to admire, their curious modes of warfare--their  strange ability to \"sit tight,\" wire themselves in, and yet to fly away!  Years ago, when some tactician ventured to say that the war of the  future embraced only the question of long-range rifles and  wire-entangled trenches, we were inclined to pooh-pooh! Now we were  beginning to see wisdom in this stubborn and persistent, and yet  skittishly mobile foe! When we looked at our wire nippers and their  strong entrenchments we began to formulate the war motto of the future,  which resolves itself into five words: \"Six legs and a spade!\" The  sword, the bayonet, the cavalry charge were passing away for ever. Here  the dignified charger was ill-matched with the nimble steed of the  country, and many officers were only too glad to supplement their  English horses with Basuto ponies--to secure four serviceable and sure  legs, as the climate and other circumstances contrived to wear out those  of their British beasts. Fortunately there was still a plentiful choice  in horse-flesh, what with British and Australian and Argentine  specimens, but the Basuto ponies were the most knowing and handy for the  purposes required. The imported horse, it was discovered, needed a long  and probationary period to make him at home on the South African veldt.  Like other aristocratical creatures, he was unequal to the hand-to-mouth  existence of the African-born animal, who, by habit and instinct, could  shift for himself. He was neither knowing nor cautious, having been  unaccustomed to ground honeycombed with mole-holes, sluits, and other  obstacles, or to the trick of rolling on the veldt and picking up his  meals haphazard from the first bush he came across. Hence it became  evident that horses in plenty must be forthcoming if we were ever to  remedy our deficiencies and make our progress something other than the  steam-roller style of progress to which we had been accustomed.          CHAPTER II    MAFEKING      Plucky little Mafeking continued to hold its own, and not merely to hold  its own, but to make itself dauntlessly aggressive. Continual sorties  took place, and indeed formed part of the routine of daily life.  Commandant Cronje now sent in a communication disputing the right of the  British to use dynamite in any way in the operations for the defence of  the town; but Colonel Baden-Powell was inclined for deeds, not  arguments, so Cronje was silenced. The town was enlivened by a great  concert, in which the National Anthem was sung with fervour and intense  significance. This showed without doubt that Mafeking meant to fight so  long as breath should last. In regard to provisions and water, the  garrison was getting on well. The art of dodging shells, said one  officer, was being carried to a state of great perfection, and the  fighting was being conducted in strict accordance with military  etiquette, Commandant Cronje always giving due notice of bombardment!    For some time after Colonel Walford's gallant defence of Cannon Kopje on  the 31st October, nothing much occurred. The losses from this attack  were more than at first supposed. Captain the Hon. H. Marsham, as we  know, was killed, and Captain Pechell, who was hit in the abdomen by a  piece of shell, succumbed to his injuries. Sergeant Lloyd, who did  splendid service with the Red Cross company, was struck while attending  to the wounded, and died. Trooper Nicholas, whose arm was shattered,  succumbed owing to shock to the system. A trooper who was hit by a  bullet in the collar-bone escaped death miraculously. Fortunately,  Lieutenants Brady and Dawson, who were also injured, were getting on  well.    Among the marvellous escapes recorded, and these were not a few, was one  of a negro who was shot through the brain by a bullet. The projectile  passed through one temple and lodged in the other, yet the man still  survived, and showed a decided intention to recover. There is an old  story of a Jamaica negro who fell from a tree without injury, and when  asked how he escaped, he explained his good fortune by saying, \"Tank  God, me fall on me head!\" The invulnerability of the nigger cranium in  that case, as in this, had its advantages, and it would be interesting  if some of our specialists--say Dr. Horsley--would account for the  rough-and-tumble superiority of blacks over whites.    On the 1st of November a lamentable incident occurred. Parslow, the  correspondent of the _Daily Chronicle_, was shot by a member of the  garrison. The following is an extract from a letter relating to the sad  affair, which was in the possession of the Editor of the _Daily  Chronicle_:--    \"MAFEKING, _November 19_.--One item, the most unpleasant of the whole  beleaguerment, occupied attention during last week--that is, the  court-martial of Lieutenant Murchison for the murder of Mr. Parslow,  special war correspondent of the London _Daily Chronicle_. He was a  genial, good-humoured young fellow, and asked Murchison, an artilleryman  of ability and undoubted courage, to dine with him. After dinner Mr.  Parslow strolled with Murchison across the Market Square towards Dixon's  Hotel, the headquarters of the Staff, the ostensible purpose being for  both of them to obtain a copy of the orders for the day, usually issued  about that time--half-past nine or ten o'clock P.M. Some words ensued  apparently during the few minutes occupied in reaching Dixon's. Parslow  left his companion in the passage of the hotel, and was passing out,  when it is alleged that Murchison drew his revolver and shot him dead,  the bullet entering his head on the occipital protuberance an inch or an  inch and a half behind the left ear, and lodging against the base of the  skull. The case is completed, and the court closed to consider the  verdict.\"    The young journalist was exceedingly popular and deeply regretted. He  was buried with military honours on the evening of the 2nd. His coffin  was covered with the Union Jack, and carried to the grave by Major  Baillie of the _Morning Post_, Mr. Angus Hamilton of the _Times_, Mr.  Hellawell of the _Daily Mail_, Mr. Reilly of the _Pall Mall Gazette_,  and the correspondent of the Press Association. The funeral was attended  by many members of the Staff, who were desirous of showing their esteem  for the promising and gallant writer.    [Illustration: THE SIEGE OF MAFEKING    TOPOGRAPHICAL SKETCH SHOWING THE BRITISH AND BOER POSITIONS    From a sketch by a British officer brought by runner to Buluwayo]    The enemy now engaged in hostilities under the command of the son of  Cronje, who was said to have had, in the interval, a _passage d'armes_  with his father, the General, the younger man having taunted the elder  for not having succeeded in reducing Mafeking to submission. Whereupon  Cronje _fils_ undertook to do the great deed himself, and in setting  about it managed to get killed. The Boers again stormed the place, and  were driven back in confusion by the magnificent energy of the British  South African Police, leaving strewn on the field of action an enormous  number of dead and wounded. Their removal occupied two hours. Captain  Goodyear, commanding a squad of Cape \"boys,\" made a dashing sortie, and  received a wound in the leg, but he nevertheless captured the  brickfields, and held them against the enemy, thus preventing him from  utilising them for sniping operations.    Sunday the 5th of November was, as usual, observed as a day of truce.  The enemy made an effort to defy the rules of Sabbath etiquette, and  were informed, under a flag of truce, that if they should continue to  erect works commanding the brickfields, the guns would open fire on  them. This warning had the desired effect. The memory of Guy Fawkes,  together with the news of our victories in Natal, was honoured by an  exhibition of fireworks--a display which some thought rather"]]]
