[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35545"],[0,"Sanders of the River (#7)"],[1,"ore, borrowed a boat and rowed out to investigate. The  explanation was simple--the bell had been stolen.    \"Now!\" said the President of the Liberian Republic in despair, \"may  Beelzebub, who is the father and author of all sin, descend upon these  thieving Kroomen!\"    Another bell was attached. The same night it was stolen. Yet another  bell was put to the buoy, and a boat-load of admirals kept watch.  Throughout the night they sat, rising and falling with the swell, and  the monotonous \"clang-jangle-clong\" was music in their ears. All night  it sounded, but in the early morning, at the dark hour before the sun  comes up, it seemed that the bell, still tolling, grew fainter and  fainter.    \"Brothers,\" said an admiral, \"we are drifting away from the bell.\"    But the explanation was that the bell had drifted away from them, for,  tired of half measures, the Kroomen had come and taken the buoy, bell  and all, and to this day there is no mark to show where a sometime  man-of-war rots in the harbour of Monrovia.    The ingenious soul who planned and carried out this theft was one  Bosambo, who had three wives, one of whom, being by birth Congolaise,  and untrustworthy, informed the police, and with some ceremony Bosambo  was arrested and tried at the Supreme Court, where he was found guilty  of \"theft and high treason\" and sentenced to ten years' penal servitude.    They took Bosambo back to prison, and Bosambo interviewed the black  gaoler.    \"My friend,\" he said, \"I have a big ju-ju in the forest, and if you do  not release me at once you and your wife shall die in great torment.\"    \"Of your ju-ju I know nothing,\" said the gaoler philosophically, \"but I  receive two dollars a week for guarding prisoners, and if I let you  escape I shall lose my job.\"    \"I know a place where there is much silver hidden,\" said Bosambo with  promptitude. \"You and I will go to this place, and we shall be rich.\"    \"If you knew where there was silver, why did you steal bells, which are  of brass and of no particular value?\" asked his unimaginative guard.    \"I see that you have a heart of stone,\" said Bosambo, and went away to  the forest settlement to chop down trees for the good of the State.    Four months after this, Sanders, Chief Commissioner for the Isisi,  Ikeli, and Akasava countries, received, _inter alia_, a communication of  a stereotyped description--        TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN.        Wanted,--on a warrant issued by H.E. the President of Liberia,      Bosambo Krooboy, who escaped from the penal settlement near      Monrovia, after killing a guard. He is believed to be making for      your country.    A description followed.    Sanders put the document away with other such notices--they were not  infrequent in their occurrence--and gave his mind to the eternal problem  of the Ochori.    Now, as ever, the Ochori people were in sad trouble. There is no other  tribe in the whole of Africa that is as defenceless as the poor Ochori.  The Fingoes, slaves as they are by name and tradition, were ferocious as  the Masai, compared with the Ochori.    Sanders was a little impatient, and a deputation of three, who had  journeyed down to headquarters to lay the grievances of the people  before him, found him unsympathetic.    He interviewed them on his verandah.    \"Master, no man leaves us in peace,\" said one. \"Isisi folk, N'Gombi  people from far-away countries, they come to us demanding this and that,  and we give, being afraid.\"    \"Afraid of what?\" asked Sanders wearily.    \"We fear death and pain, also burning and the taking of our women,\" said  the other.    \"Who is chief of you?\" asked Sanders, wilfully ignorant.    \"I am chief lord,\" said an elderly man, clad in a leopard skin.    \"Go back to your people, chief, if indeed chief you are, and not some  old woman without shame; go back and bear with you a fetish--a most  powerful fetish--which shall be, as me, watching your interest and  protecting you. This fetish you shall plant on the edge of your village  that faces the sun at noon. You shall mark the place where it shall be  planted, and at midnight, with proper ceremony, and the sacrifice of a  young goat, you shall set my fetish in its place. And after that  whosoever ill-treats you or robs you shall do so at some risk.\"    Sanders said this very solemnly, and the men of the deputation were duly  impressed. More impressed were they when, before starting on their  homeward journey, Sanders placed in their hands a stout pole, to the end  of which was attached a flat board inscribed with certain marks.    They carried their trophy six days' journey through the forest, then  four days' journey by canoe along the Little River, until they came to  Ochori. There, by the light of the moon, with the sacrifice of two goats  (to make sure), the pole was planted so that the board inscribed with  mystic characters would face the sun at noon.    News travels fast in the back lands, and it came to the villages  throughout the Isisi and the Akasava country that the Ochori were  particularly protected by white magic. Protected they had always been,  and many men had died at the white man's hand because the temptation to  kill the Ochori folk had proved irresistible.    \"I do not believe that Sandi has done this thing,\" said the chief of the  Akasava. \"Let us go across the river and see with our own eyes, and if  they have lied we shall beat them with sticks, though let no man kill,  because of Sandi and his cruelty.\"    So across the water they went, and marched until they came within sight  of the Ochori city, and the Ochori people, hearing that the Akasava  people were coming, ran away into the woods and hid, in accordance with  their custom.    The Akasava advanced until they came to the pole stuck in the ground and  the board with the devil marks.    Before this they stood in silence and in awe, and having made obeisance  to it and sacrificed a chicken (which was the lawful property of the  Ochori) they turned back.    After this came a party from Isisi, and they must needs come through the  Akasava country.    They brought presents with them and lodged with the Akasava for one  night.    \"What story is this of the Ochori?\" asked the Isisi chief in command; so  the chief of the Akasava told him.    \"You may save yourself the journey, for we have seen it.\"    \"That,\" said the Isisi chief, \"I will believe when I have seen.\"    \"That is bad talk,\" said the Akasava people, who were gathered at the  palaver; \"these dogs of Isisi call us liars.\"    Nevertheless there was no bloodshed, and in the morning the Isisi went  on their way.    The Ochori saw them coming, and hid in the woods, but the precaution was  unnecessary, for the Isisi departed as they came.    Other folk made a pilgrimage to the Ochori, N'Gombi, Bokeli, and the  Little People of the Forest, who were so shy that they came by night,  and the Ochori people began to realise a sense of their importance.    Then Bosambo, a Krooman and an adventurer at large, appeared on the  scene, having crossed eight hundred miles of wild land in the earnest  hope that time would dull the memory of the Liberian Government and  incidentally bring him to a land of milk and honey.    Now Bosambo had in his life been many things. He had been steward on an  Elder Dempster boat, he had been scholar at a mission school--he was the  proud possessor of a bound copy of _The Lives of the Saints_, a reward  of industry--and among his accomplishments was a knowledge of English.    The hospitable Ochori received him kindly, fed him with sweet manioc  and sugar-cane, and told him about Sandi's magic. After he had eaten,  Bosambo walked down to the post and read the inscription--      TRESPASSERS BEWARE.    He was not impressed, and strolled back again thinking deeply.    \"This magic,\" he said to the chief, \"is good magic. I know, because I  have white man's blood in my veins.\"    In support of this statement he proceeded to libel a perfectly innocent  British official at Sierra Leone.    The Ochori were profoundly moved. They poured forth the story of their  persecutions, a story which began in remote ages, when Tiganobeni, the  great king, came down from the north and wasted the country as far south  as the Isisi.    Bosambo listened--it took two nights and the greater part of a day to  tell the story, because the official story-teller of the Ochori had only  one method of telling--and when it was finished Bosambo said to  himself--    \"This is the people I have long sought. I will stay here.\"    Aloud he asked:    \"How often does Sandi come to you?\"    \"Once every year, master,\" said the chief, \"on the twelfth moon, and a  little after.\"    \"When came he last?\"    \"When this present moon is at full, three moons since; he comes after  the big rains.\"    \"Then,\" said Bosambo, again to himself, \"for nine months I am safe.\"    They built him a hut and planted for him a banana grove and gave him  seed. Then he demanded for wife the daughter of the chief, and although  he offered nothing in payment the girl came to him. That a stranger  lived in the chief village of the Ochori was remarked by the other  tribes, for news of this kind spreads, but since he was married, and  into the chief's family at that, it was accepted that the man must be of  the Ochori folk, and such was the story that came to headquarters. Then  the chief of the Ochori died. He died suddenly in some pain; but such  deaths are common, and his son ruled in his place. Then the son died  after the briefest reign, and Bosambo called the people together, the  elders, the wise men, and the headmen of the country.    \"It appears,\" he said, \"that the many gods of the Ochori are displeased  with you, and it has been revealed to me in a dream that I shall be  chief of the Ochori. Therefore, O chiefs and wise men and headmen, bow  before me, as is the custom, and I will make you a great people.\"    It is characteristic of the Ochori that no"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35554"],[0,"A Voice of Warning (#7)"],[1,"ars; and they shall turn away  their ears from the truth, and shall be turned unto fables.\" This  prophecy has been fulfilled to the very letter; for it applies to  every religious teacher who has arisen from that day unto the present,  except those commissioned by direct _revelation_ and _inspired_ by the  _Holy Ghost_. But, to convince the reader of its full accomplishment,  we need only point to the numberless priests of the day who preach for  hire, and divine for money, and who receive their authority from their  fellow man; and as to the fables to which they are turned, we need  only to mention the spiritualizings and private interpretations which  salute our ears from almost every religious press and pulpit.    But there is another prophecy of Paul well worth our attention, as  illustrative of the times in which we live; it is found in the first  five verses of the third chapter of 2 Timothy: \"This know also that in  the last days perilous times shall come; for men shall be lovers of  their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient  to parents, unthankful, unholy, without natural affection, truce  breakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that  are good, traitors, heady, high minded, lovers of pleasures more than  lovers of God, having a form of godliness, but denying the power  thereof: from such turn away.\" From the last verse of this quotation  we learn to our _astonishment_ that this _sum_ of awful _wickedness_  applies to _professors_ of _religion_ ONLY; that is, this would be the  character of the (so called) Christian part of the community in the  last days. Do not startle, kind reader; we do not make the application  without proof _positive_ to the point, for, remember, non-professors  have no _form of godliness_, but those ungodly characters spoken of  were to have a _form of godliness_, _denying the power thereof_. But,  if you doubt Paul's testimony on the subject, look around you, examine  for yourselves. \"By their fruits ye shall know them.\" My heart is  pained while I write. Alas, has it come to this; has the Spirit of  Truth removed the veil of obscurity from the last days, only to  present us with the vision of a fallen people; an apostate church,  full of all manner of abominations, and even despising those who are  good; while they themselves have nothing left but the form of  godliness, denying the power of God; that is, setting aside the direct  inspiration and supernatural gifts of the Spirit, which ever  characterize the Church of Christ? Was it for this only that the Holy  Spirit opened to the view of holy men the events of unborn time,  enabling them to gaze upon the opening glories of the latter days? O  ye Prophets and Apostles, ye holy men of old, what have you done if  you stop here; if your prophetic vision only extended down the stream  of time to the present year? Alas! you have filled our minds with  sorrow and despair: the Jews you have left wandering in sorrow and  darkness, far from all their hearts hold most dear on earth; their  land a desolation, their city and temple in ruins, and they, without  the knowledge of the true Messiah. The Gentiles, after partaking of  the root and fatness of the tame olive tree, having fallen, after the  same example of unbelief, are left without fruit, dead, plucked up by  the roots, with naught but a form of godliness; while the powers that  characterized the ancient church have fled from among men. Is this the  consummation of all your labors? Was it for this you searched, toiled,  bled, and died? I pause for a reply; if you have a word of comfort yet  in store, concerning the future, let it quickly speak, lest our souls  should linger in the dark valley of sorrow and despair!          CHAPTER II.    ON THE FULFILMENT OF PROPHECY YET FUTURE.    What is Prophecy but History reversed?      Having made the discovery and produced sufficient proof that the  prophecies, thus far, have been LITERALLY fulfilled--to the very  letter--we hope the reader will never lose sight of the same rule with  regard to those yet future. And, while we stand upon the threshold of  futurity, with the wonders of unborn time about to open upon our view,  presenting before our astonished vision the most mighty and majestic  scenes, the most astonishing revolutions, the most extraordinary  destructions, as well as the most miraculous displays of the power and  majesty of Jehovah, in His great restoration of His long dispersed  covenant people from the four quarters of the earth: I say, as these  scenes are about to open to our view, let us bow before the great I  AM, in the name of Jesus, and pray in faith for His Spirit to enlarge  our hearts and enlighten our minds, that we may understand and believe  all that is written, however miraculous it may be. But, O! kind  reader, whoever you are, if you are not prepared for persecution, if  you are unprepared to have your name cast out as evil, if you cannot  bear to be called a knave, an impostor, or madman, or one that hath a  devil; or if you are bound by the creeds of men to believe just so  much and no more, you had better stop here; for if you were to believe  the things written in the Bible that are yet to come, you will be  under the necessity of believing miracles, signs and wonders,  revelations, and manifestations of the power of God, even beyond  anything that any former generation has witnessed; yes, you will  believe that the waters will be divided and Israel go through dryshod,  as they journey to their own land, as they did in the days of Moses;  for no man ever yet believed the Bible without believing and expecting  such glorious events in the latter days. And I will now venture to say  that a believer in the Bible would be something that very few men have  ever seen in this generation, with all its boasted religion: for there  is a great difference between believing the book to be true when shut,  and believing the things therein written. It is now considered in  Christendom a great disgrace not to believe the Bible when _shut_: but  whosoever tries the experiment will find it a greater disgrace to  believe that the things therein written will surely come to pass.  Indeed, it is our firm belief in the things written in the Bible, and  careful teaching of them, that is one great cause of the persecution  we suffer. For let the prophecies be understood by the people, and let  them roll on in their fulfilment, and this will blow to the four winds  every religious craft in Christendom, and cause the kingdom of Christ  to rise upon their ruins, while the actual _knowledge_ of the _truth_  will cover the earth as the waters do the sea.    Having said so much by way of caution, if there are any of my readers  so bold, and regardless of consequences, as to dare with me to gaze  upon the future, we will commence with Isaiah xi, 11, 12, 15, 16: \"And  it shall come to pass in that day, that the Lord shall set his hand  again the second time to recover the remnant of his people, which  shall be left, from Assyria, and from Egypt, and from Pathros, and  from Cush, and from Elam, and from Shinar, and from Hamath, and from  the islands of the sea. And he shall set up an ensign for the nations,  and shall assemble the outcasts of Israel, and gather together the  dispersed of Judah from the four corners of the earth. And the LORD  shall utterly destroy the tongue of the Egyptian Sea; and with his  mighty wind shall he shake his hand over the river, and shall smite it  in the seven streams, and make men go over dryshod. And there shall be  an highway for the remnant of his people, which shall be left from  Assyria; like as it was to Israel in the day that he came up out of  the land of Egypt.\"    Here you behold an ensign to be reared for the nations; not only for  the dispersed of Judah, but the outcasts of Israel. The Jews are  called dispersed, because they are scattered among the nations; but  the ten tribes are called outcasts, because they are cast out from the  knowledge of the nations, into a land by themselves. Now, the reader  will bear in mind that the ten tribes have not dwelt in the land  of Canaan since they were led captive by Shalmaneser, king of Assyria.  We have also presented before us, in the fifteenth verse, the  marvelous power of God, which will be displayed in the destruction of  a small branch of the Red Sea, called the tongue of the Egyptian Sea;  and also the dividing of the seven streams of some river, and causing  men to go over dryshod; and, lest any should not understand it  _literally_, the fifteenth verse says: \"There shall be a highway for  the remnant of his people, which shall be left from Assyria, _like as  it was to Israel when he came up out of the land of Egypt_.\" Now, we  have only to ask whether, in the days of Moses, the Red Sea was  _literally_ divided, or whether it was only a figure? For as it was  then so shall it be again. And yet we are told by modern divines that  the days of miracles have gone forever; and those who believe in  miracles, in our day, are counted as impostors, or, at least, poor  ignorant fanatics, and the public are warned against them, as false  teachers who would, if possible, deceive the very elect. On the  subject of this restoration the Prophets have spoken so fully and  repeatedly, that we can only notice a few of the most striking  instances, which will go to show the particular circumstances and  incidents attending it, and the manner and means of its  accomplishment. The sixteenth chapter of Jeremiah, fourteenth,  fifteenth and sixteenth verses, says: \"Therefore, behold, the days  come, saith the Lord, that it shall no more be said, the Lord liveth  that brought up the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt; but,  the Lord liveth that brought up the children of Israel from the land  of the north, and from all the lands whither he had driven them: and I  will bring them again into their land "]]]
