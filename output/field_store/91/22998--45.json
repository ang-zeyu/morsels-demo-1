He laughed me in the face; on which I said  that if I knew how to use my tools in handicraft as well as he had seen,  I could be quite as clever with my sword in claiming the just payment of  my labour. While we were exchanging these words, an old man happened to  come up, called Maestro Antonio, of San Marino. He was the chief among  the Roman goldsmiths, and had been Firenzuolas master. Hearing what I  had to say, which I took good care that he should understand, he  immediately espoused my cause, and bade Firenzuola pay me. The dispute  waxed warm, because Firenzuola was an admirable swordsman, far better  than he was a goldsmith. Yet reason made itself heard; and I backed my  cause with the same spirit, till I got myself paid. In course of time  Firenzuola and I became friends, and at his request I stood godfather to  one of his children.    Note 1. Cellinis use of the word 'arte' for the 'art' or 'trade' of  goldsmiths corresponds to the art as used by English writers early in  this century. See Haydons Autobiography, 'passim.'    Note 2. The Italian is 'sobbillato,' which might be also translated  'inveigled' or 'instigated.' But Varchi, the contemporary of Cellini,  gives this verb the force of using pressure and boring on until somebody  is driven to do something.    XV    I WENT on working with Pagolo Arsago, and earned a good deal of money,  the greater part of which I always sent to my good father. At the end of  two years, upon my fathers entreaty, I returned to Florence, and put  myself once more under Francesco Salimbene, with whom I earned a great  deal, and took continual pains to improve in my art. I renewed my  intimacy with Francesco di Filippo; and though I was too much given to  pleasure, owing to that accursed music, I never neglected to devote some  hours of the day or night to study. At that time I fashioned a silver  hearts-key ('chiavaquore'), as it was then so called. This was a girdle  three inches broad, which used to be made for brides, and was executed  in half relief with some small figures in the round. It was a commission  from a man called Raffaello Lapaccini. I was very badly paid; but the  honour which it brought me was worth far more than the gain I might have  justly made by it. Having at this time worked with many different  persons in Florence, I had come to know some worthy men among the  goldsmiths, as for instance, Marcone, my first master; but I also met  with others reputed honest, who did all they could to ruin me, and  robbed me grossly. When I perceived this, I left their company, and held  them for thieves and black-guards. One of the goldsmiths, called  Giovanbattista Sogliani, kindly accommodated me with part of his shop,  which stood at the side of the New Market near the Landis bank. There I  finished several pretty pieces, and made good gains, and was able to  give my family much help. This roused the jealousy of the bad men among  my former masters, who were called Salvadore and Michele Guasconti. In  the guild of the goldsmiths they had three big shops, and drove a  thriving trade. On becoming aware of their evil will against me, I  complained to certain worthy fellows, and remarked that they ought to  have been satisfied with the thieveries they practised on me under the  cloak of hypocritical kindness. This coming to their ears, they  threatened to make me sorely repent of such words; but I, who knew not  what the colour of fear was, paid them little or no heed.    XVI    IT chanced one day that I was leaning against a shop of one of these  men, who called out to me, and began partly reproaching, partly  bullying. I answered that had they done their duty by me, I should have  spoken of them what one speaks of good and worthy men; but as they had  done the contrary, they ought to complain of themselves and not of me.  While I was standing there and talking, one of them, named Gherardo  Guasconti, their cousin, having perhaps been put up to it by them, lay  in wait till a beast of burden went by. [1] It was a load of bricks.  When the load reached me, Gherardo pushed it so violently on my body  that I was very much hurt. Turning suddenly round and seeing him  laughing, I struck him such a blow on the temple that he fell down,  stunned, like one dead. Then I faced round to his cousins, and said:  Thats the way to treat cowardly thieves of your sort; and when they  wanted to make a move upon me, trusting to their numbers, I, whose blood  was now well up, laid hands to a little knife I had, and cried: If one  of you comes out of the shop, let the other run for the confessor,  because the doctor will have nothing to do here. These words so  frightened them that not one stirred to help their cousin. As soon as I  had gone, the fathers and sons ran to the Eight, and declared that I had  assaulted them in their shops with sword in hand, a thing which had  never yet been seen in Florence. The magistrates had me summoned. I  appeared before them; and they began to upbraid and cry out upon  me-partly, I think, because they saw me in my cloak, while the others  were dressed like citizens in mantle and hood; [2] but also because my  adversaries had been to the houses of those magistrates, and had talked  with all of them in private, while I, inexperienced in such matters, had  not spoken to any of them, trusting in the goodness of my cause. I said  that, having received such outrage and insult from Gherardo, and in my  fury having only given him a box on the ear, I did not think I deserved  such a vehement reprimand. I had hardly time to finish the word box,  before Prinzivalle della Stufa, [3] who was one of the Eight,  interrupted me by saying: You gave him a blow, and not a box, on the  ear. The bell was rung and we were all ordered out, when Prinzivalle  spoke thus in my defence to his brother judges: Mark, sirs, the  simplicity of this poor young man, who has accused himself of having  given a box on the ear, under the impression that this is of less  importance than a blow; whereas a box on the ear in the New Market  carries a fine of twenty-five crowns, while a blow costs little or  nothing. He is a young man of admirable talents, and supports his poor  family by his labour in great abundance; I would to God that our city  had plenty of this sort, instead of the present dearth of them.    Note 1. The Italian is 'appostò che passassi una soma.' The verb  'appostare' has the double meaning of lying in wait and arranging  something on purpose. Cellinis words may mean, 'caused a beast of  burden to pass by.'    Note 2. Varchi says that a man who went about with only his cloak or  cape by daytime, if he were not a soldier, was reputed an ill-liver. The  Florentine citizens at this time still wore their ancient civil dress of  the long gown and hood called 'lucco.'    Note 3. This man was an ardent supporter of the Medici, and in 1510  organized a conspiracy in their favour against the Gonfalonier Soderini.    XVII    AMONG the magistrates were some Radical fellows with turned-up hoods,  who had been influenced by the entreaties and the calumnies of my  opponents, because they all belonged to the party of Fra Girolamo; and  these men would have had me sent to prison and punished without too  close a reckoning. [1] But the good Prinzivalle put a stop to that. So  they sentenced me to pay four measures of flour, which were to be given  as alms to the nunnery of the Murate. [2] I was called in again; and he  ordered me not to speak a word under pain of their displeasure, and to  perform the sentence they had passed. Then, after giving me another  sharp rebuke, they sent us to the chancellor; I muttering all the while,  It was a slap and not a blow, with which we left the Eight bursting  with laughter. The chancellor bound us over upon bail on both sides; but  only I was punished by having to pay the four measures of meal. Albeit  just then I felt as though I had been massacred, I sent for one of my  cousins, called Maestro Annibale, the surgeon, father of Messer  Librodoro Librodori, desiring that he should go bail for me. [3] He  refused to come, which made me so angry, that, fuming with fury and  swelling like an asp, I took a desperate resolve. At this point one may  observe how the stars do not so much sway as force our conduct. When I  reflected on the great obligations which this Annibale owed my family,  my rage grew to such a pitch that, turning wholly to evil, and being  also by nature somewhat choleric, I waited till the magistrates had gone  to dinner; and when I was alone, and observed that none of their  officers were watching me, in the fire of my anger, I left the palace,  ran to my shop, seized a dagger and rushed to the house of my enemies,  who were at home and shop together. I found them at table; and Gherardo,  who had been the cause of the quarrel, flung himself upon me. I stabbed  him in the breast, piercing doublet and jerkin through and through to  the shirt, without however grazing his flesh or doing him the least harm  in the world. When I felt my hand go in, and heard the clothes tear, I  thought that I had killed him; and seeing him fall terror-struck to  earth, I cried: Traitors, this day is the day on which I mean to murder  you all. Father, mother, and sisters, thinking the last day had come,  threw themselves upon their knees, screaming out for mercy with all  their might; but I perceiving that they offered no resistance, and that  he was stretched for dead upon the ground, thought it too base a thing  to touch them. I ran storming down the staircase; and when I reached the  street, I found all the rest of the household, more than twelve persons;  one of them had seized an iron shovel, another a thick iron pipe, one  had an anvil, some of them hammers, and some"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4035"],[0,"Greek Studies: a Series of Essays (#7)"],[1,"e, he  belongs to two worlds, and has much in common with her, and a full  share of those dark possibilities which, even apart from the story of  the rape, belong to her.  He is a Chthonian god, and, like all the  children of the earth, has an element of sadness; like Hades himself,  he is hollow and devouring, an eater of man's flesh--sarcophagus--the  grave which consumed unaware the ivory-white shoulder of Pelops.    And you have no sooner caught a glimpse of this image, than a certain  perceptible shadow comes creeping over the whole story; for, in  effect, we have seen glimpses of the sorrowing Dionysus, all along.  Part of the interest of the Theban legend of his birth is that he  comes of the marriage of a god with a mortal woman; and from the  first, like merely mortal heroes, he falls within the sphere of human  chances.  At first, indeed, the melancholy settles round the person  of his mother, dead in childbirth, and ignorant of the glory of her  son; in shame, according to Euripides; punished, as her own sisters  allege, for impiety.  The death of Semele [45] is a sort of ideal or  type of this peculiar claim on human pity, as the descent of  Persephone into Hades, of all human pity over the early death of  women.  Accordingly, his triumph being now consummated, he descends  into Hades, through the unfathomable Alcyonian lake, according to the  most central version of the legend, to bring her up from thence; and  that Hermes, the shadowy conductor of souls, is constantly associated  with Dionysus, in the story of his early life, is not without  significance in this connexion.  As in Delphi the winter months were  sacred to him, so in Athens his feasts all fall within the four  months on this and the other side of the shortest day; as Persephone  spends those four months--a third part of the year--in Hades.  Son or  brother of Persephone he actually becomes at last, in confused, half-  developed tradition; and even has his place, with his dark sister, in  the Eleusinian mysteries, as Iacchus; where, on the sixth day of the  feast, in the great procession from Athens to Eleusis, we may still  realise his image, moving up and down above the heads of the vast  multitude, as he goes, beside \"the two,\" to the temple of Demeter,  amid the light of torches at noonday.    But it was among the mountains of Thrace that this gloomier element  in the being of Dionysus had taken the strongest hold.  As in the  sunny villages of Attica the cheerful elements of his religion had  been developed, so, in those [46] wilder northern regions, people  continued to brood over its darker side, and hence a current of  gloomy legend descended into Greece.  The subject of the Bacchanals  of Euripides is the infatuated opposition of Pentheus, king of  Thebes, to Dionysus and his religion; his cruelty to the god, whom he  shuts up in prison, and who appears on the stage with his delicate  limbs cruelly bound, but who is finally triumphant; Pentheus, the man  of grief, being torn to pieces by his own mother, in the judicial  madness sent upon her by the god.  In this play, Euripides has only  taken one of many versions of the same story, in all of which  Dionysus is victorious, his enemy being torn to pieces by the sacred  women, or by wild horses, or dogs, or the fangs of cold; or the  maenad Ambrosia, whom he is supposed to pursue for purposes of lust,  suddenly becomes a vine, and binds him down to the earth  inextricably, in her serpentine coils.    In all these instances, then, Dionysus punishes his enemies by  repaying them in kind.  But a deeper vein of poetry pauses at the  sorrow, and in the conflict does not too soon anticipate the final  triumph.  It is Dionysus himself who exhausts these sufferings.  Hence, in many forms--reflexes of all the various phases of his  wintry existence--the image of Dionysus Zagreus, the Hunter--of  Dionysus in winter--storming wildly on the dark Thracian hills, from  which, like Ares and Boreas, he originally descends into [47] Greece;  the thought of the hunter concentrating into itself all men's  forebodings over the departure of the year at its richest, and the  death of all sweet things in the long-continued cold, when the sick  and the old and little children, gazing out morning after morning on  the dun sky, can hardly believe in the return any more of a bright  day.  Or he is connected with the fears, the dangers and hardships of  the hunter himself, lost or slain sometimes, far from home, in the  dense woods of the mountains, as he seeks his meat so ardently;  becoming, in his chase, almost akin to the wild beasts--to the wolf,  who comes before us in the name of Lycurgus, one of his bitterest  enemies--and a phase, therefore, of his own personality, in the true  intention of the myth.  This transformation, this image of the  beautiful soft creature become an enemy of human kind, putting off  himself in his madness, wronged by his own fierce hunger and thirst,  and haunting, with terrible sounds, the high Thracian farms, is the  most tragic note of the whole picture, and links him on to one of the  gloomiest creations of later romance, the werewolf, the belief in  which still lingers in Greece, as in France, where it seems to become  incorporate in the darkest of all romantic histories, that of Gilles  de Retz.    And now we see why the tradition of human sacrifice lingered on in  Greece, in connexion with Dionysus, as a thing of actual detail, and  [48] not remote, so that Dionysius of Halicarnassus counts it among  the horrors of Greek religion.  That the sacred women of Dionysus  ate, in mystical ceremony, raw flesh, and drank blood, is a fact  often mentioned, and commemorates, as it seems, the actual sacrifice  of a fair boy deliberately torn to pieces, fading at last into a  symbolical offering.  At Delphi, the wolf was preserved for him, on  the principle by which Venus loves the dove, and Hera peacocks; and  there were places in which, after the sacrifice of a kid to him, a  curious mimic pursuit of the priest who had offered it represented  the still surviving horror of one who had thrown a child to the  wolves.  The three daughters of Minyas devote themselves to his  worship; they cast lots, and one of them offers her own tender infant  to be torn by the three, like a roe; then the other women pursue  them, and they are turned into bats, or moths, or other creatures of  the night.  And fable is endorsed by history; Plutarch telling us  how, before the battle of Salamis, with the assent of Themistocles,  three Persian captive youths were offered to Dionysus the Devourer.    As, then, some embodied their fears of winter in Persephone, others  embodied them in Dionysus, a devouring god, whose sinister side (as  the best wine itself has its treacheries) is illustrated in the dark  and shameful secret society described by Livy, in which his worship  ended at Rome, afterwards abolished by solemn act of the senate. [49]  He becomes a new Aidoneus, a hunter of men's souls; like him, to be  appeased only by costly sacrifices.    And then, Dionysus recovering from his mid-winter madness, how  intensely these people conceive the spring!  It is that triumphant  Dionysus, cured of his great malady, and sane in the clear light of  the longer days, whom Euripides in the Bacchanals sets before us, as  still, essentially, the Hunter, Zagreus; though he keeps the red  streams and torn flesh away from the delicate body of the god, in his  long vesture of white and gold, and fragrant with Eastern odours.  Of  this I hope to speak in another paper; let me conclude this by one  phase more of religious custom.    If Dionysus, like Persephone, has his gloomy side, like her he has  also a peculiar message for a certain number of refined minds,  seeking, in the later days of Greek religion, such modifications of  the old legend as may minister to ethical culture, to the perfecting  of the moral nature.  A type of second birth, from first to last, he  opens, in his series of annual changes, for minds on the look-out for  it, the hope of a possible analogy, between the resurrection of  nature, and something else, as yet unrealised, reserved for human  souls; and the beautiful, weeping creature, vexed by the wind,  suffering, torn to pieces, and rejuvenescent again at last, like a  tender shoot of living green out of the hardness and stony darkness+  [50] of the earth, becomes an emblem or ideal of chastening and  purification, and of final victory through suffering.  It is the  finer, mystical sentiment of the few, detached from the coarser and  more material religion of the many, and accompanying it, through the  course of its history, as its ethereal, less palpable, life-giving  soul, and, as always happens, seeking the quiet, and not too anxious  to make itself felt by others.  With some unfixed, though real, place  in the general scheme of Greek religion, this phase of the worship of  Dionysus had its special development in the Orphic literature and  mysteries.  Obscure as are those followers of the mystical Orpheus,  we yet certainly see them, moving, and playing their part, in the  later ages of Greek religion.  Old friends with new faces, though  they had, as Plato witnesses, their less worthy aspect, in certain  appeals to vulgar, superstitious fears, they seem to have been not  without the charm of a real and inward religious beauty, with their  neologies, their new readings of old legends, their sense of mystical  second meanings, as they refined upon themes grown too familiar, and  linked, in a sophisticated age, the new to the old.  In this respect,  we may perhaps liken them to the mendicant orders in the Middle Ages,  with their florid, romantic theology, beyond the bounds of orthodox  tradition, giving so much new matter to art and poetry.  They are a  picturesque addition, also, to the exterior of Greek life, with [51]  their white dresses, their dirges, their fastings and"]]]
