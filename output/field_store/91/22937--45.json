[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/36496"],[0,"On the cattle plague: or, Contagious typhus in horned cattle. Its history, (#7)"],[1,"consisted of whey mixed with a  little vinegar, and nitred hay. The broths, or alimentary beverages,  consisted of a decoction of bread, and of water mixed with bran and  meal, whether of barley, oats, or wheat.    At this stage of the curative process, the majority of physicians  recommended one or two bleedings, in order to abate the violence of the  fever, and of the congestions near the nervous centres and the lungs;  and as constipation prevailed at the time, they strove with the same  object to empty the digestive passages, the intestines, and the  stomachs, notwithstanding the difficulty that exists to produce this  result in ruminating animals.    The purgatives employed consisted of a decoction of senna, mixed with  prune juice, with a little rhubarb or fresh linseed oil, infused in  their drink, or applied as a clyster in warm water slightly salted.  Those who practised polypharmacy administered at night a mixture of  nitre, camphor, red-lead, and rhubarb, in half a pailful of warm water;  and greatly did they boast of the active influence of this beverage.    Some practitioners even endeavoured, in the first stage of the malady,  to accelerate its action on the skin by giving for that purpose warm  drinks, and by covering the cattle with woollen cloths, to promote  perspiration; but it was generally admitted that the sick animals  preferred cold drinks, and that they were particularly fond of  acidulated whey.    In the second period of the distemper, the same drinks were continued,  adding thereto some theriac or Jesuit's bark, in order to lessen the  frequency of the diarrhoetic evacuations. They also provoked the  depurating secretions from the mouth, nose, and eyes, by repeated  washings; and as those animals, in which the running was most easy and  copious, seemed to be less seriously affected with the disease, they  strove to increase that which flowed from the glands of the mouth by  fixing a gag in the jaws, and keeping it there for several hours. This  measure seemed so efficacious that a decree from the Parlement de Rouen,  issued on the 13th of March, 1745, ordered the application of a gag, or  bit, for three hours every day, to the cattle under treatment.    In the third period, they sought to overcome the wasting of strength in  the system by means of tonic and nutritious drinks, decoctions of  centaury, Jesuit's bark, juniper berries, &c. They likewise administered  emollient clysters if the evacuations were bloody.    Moreover, they placed two or three setons, principally in the dewlap, in  order to obey the signs and indications of nature--_quo natura vergit,  eo ducendum_; as a salutary and critical eruption of the skin was at  that period forcing its way. These setons were kept open with a mixture  of turpentine and yolks of egg, for the purpose of encouraging the  secretion. The purulent or emphysematous tumours were cut.    But whatever means might be employed, almost all the cattle perished,  and the few and rare recoveries only afforded the pessimists the  satisfaction of claiming the merit of them for themselves. It was  remarked, besides, that the fattest beasts were the least able to resist  the effects of the distemper.    It is hardly necessary to say, that during the whole course of the  treatment, great care was taken to keep both the stables and the cattle  in a perfect state of cleanliness.    The convalescence of those animals which were cured was invariably long,  and required great attention as to their food and hygienic treatment.  Solid substances, roots, and forage were withheld until rumination  revived; and it was only after several days of encouraging trials that  the recovered animal was suffered at last to feed all day in the field,  according to his pleasure.    Such, then, was that formidable epizootia which, in the middle of the  eighteenth century, swept away upwards of six millions of horned cattle,  and which occasioned a loss to Europe exceeding fifty millions  sterling--perhaps we might say a hundred millions--for other domestic  animals, sheep, horses, &c. (as generally happens in cases of  epizootia), had likewise suffered, in different degrees, from the  various complaints arising from inclement seasons.    It was certainly necessary to our purpose that we should have taken this  retrospective view of the cattle disease, and it will afford us a  valuable guide for the future. We may now content ourselves with  bringing together the different annals in the chain of time which  elapsed between Layard's treatise, which was published in 1757, and the  present day. This chain of time amounts to 108 years.      V.    The typhus of Horned Cattle, which had shown itself in a manner  permanent, sometimes raging at one part of the globe, sometimes at  another, could not, under the unaltered conditions by which it had been  generated, suspend its ravages; and though, thanks to her isolated  position, England may be less exposed to it than other countries, it is,  however, necessary to take note of what may serve for our instruction in  the several epizootics which will pass under our view.    Medical writers relate that contagious typhus broke out several times in  Holland during the years 1768, 1769, and 1770; it also appeared in  French Flanders in 1771, in Hainault in 1773. In France one particular  spot was, at this period, completely rendered intact by drawing a  sanitary fence about its limits, and bestowing on the cattle particular  hygienic attention as a safeguard. The stables of these animals were  washed, cleansed, and fumigated; spring water was given them to drink,  their food was chosen with care, and a certain quantity of salt was  mixed with it.    In 1774, Holland, a cold and damp country, was once more invaded by the  scourge; and the Government offered in vain a reward of 80,000 florins  to any one who should discover the preventive or specific remedy for the  disease.    The typhus which, at that epoch, had likewise broken out again in the  south of France, threatened to become an abiding peril to the wealth of  nations. Two French authors, Vicq d'Azyr and Paulet, betook themselves  earnestly to the task of collecting every document which up to that time  had been published on the successive visitations of the malady, and of  offering the means of preventing it. Their intention was unquestionably  laudable, but the time for obtaining such a result had not yet arrived;  besides which, these two writers, whatever may have been their desert,  were not equal to an achievement of this character. They belonged,  indeed, to that order of men who look upon the cultivation of science  solely as a step to personal distinction.    Vicq d'Azyr himself was but twenty-five years old when he issued, in  1775, his work, entitled, \"Expose des Moyens curatifs et preservatifs  qui peuvent etre employes contre les Maladies des Betes a Cornes.\" We  should deceive ourselves if we expected to find in this exposition  anything but an interesting compilation of the works already published.    Paulet's treatise appeared likewise in 1775, under the title,  \"Recherches historiques et physiques sur les Maladies epizootiques, avec  les Moyens d'y remedier dans tous les Cas, publiees _par ordre du Roi_.\"  Paris. Two volumes.    After reading and reflecting on this title, as servile as it is  arrogant, I might have dispensed with all examination of the work. A  scientific man, whilst in the pursuit of truth, takes orders from  nobody, not even from kings. Paulet, therefore, writing _by order_,  could only produce a work of mediocrity, and such is incontestably the  degree of value of his two volumes, forming, as they do, a fastidious  dissertation of epizootics in general, and of those relating to cattle  in particular.    The works of Paulet and Vicq d'Azyr, written at the same time, not being  the labour of men practising the medical art, are on a level as to the  notions which they have handed down to us; but that of Vicq d'Azyr  being the better of the two, we shall extract therefrom what may chiefly  interest us.    Vicq d'Azyr relates the history of the epizootics, and expatiates on the  original cause of the typhus in horned cattle, and on its nature. The  passages in which he treats of its mode of propagation and its  treatment, are the most deserving of our notice.    He says, that he tried to no purpose to communicate the disease a second  time to animals which had been fortunate enough to get cured.    That cows covered with the fresh skins stripped from dead cattle,  victims to the distemper, did not contract it.    That infected clothes which had been worn by men who had served in  hospitals where cattle were under treatment, having been laid on the  backs of several beasts in sound health, were found to transmit the  distemper in three cases out of six.    That the gases expelled from the intestines, received into a bladder  ball, and let out under the noses of healthy cattle, have communicated  the disease to them, after ten or fifteen days of latent incubation;  and that the same gases being mixed with their drink, have also  propagated the contagion.    That frictions, with the hands impregnated with virus, having been made  over the skin, did not produce any ill effects.    That some oxen which had been designedly placed for a few hours among  sick animals, have afterwards been seized with the distemper.    That a calf which had been placed in a stall containing some oxen  grievously affected, but which calf had a basket beneath its nose filled  with aromatic herbs, withstood the contagion.    That cowsheds which had been partially cleansed and fumigated,  transmitted the disease to other cattle, even several months after they  had been vacated.    Finally, he mentions the experiments of inoculation made by Lay and in  England, but not understanding their aim and capacity, he adds, that  inoculation does not seem to him of any use, since the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/36504"],[0,"Freshwater Sponges, Hydroids & Polyzoa (#7)"],[1,"of all species  that have been found in stagnant water, whether fresh or brackish, but  those of species not yet found in fresh water are enclosed in square  brackets.    +-----------------------------------------------------------------------+  |                       INDIAN SPONGILLIDAE.                            |  |                                                                       |  +---------------------------------+----------------------+--------------+  |         NAME.                   |   TYPE IN COLL.      |  MATERIAL    |  |                                 |                      |  EXAMINED.   |  +---------------------------------+----------------------+--------------+  | _Spongilla lacustris_ subsp.    | Ind.
