Whether the State Constitutions are to be regarded as  property-conserving, aristocratic instruments, or as progressive  documents, depends upon the point of view. And so it is with the spirit  of union or of nationality in the United States. One student emphasizes  the fact of there being \"thirteen independent republics differing...  widely in climate, in soil, in occupation, in everything which makes  up the social and economic life of the people\"; while another sees \"the  United States a nation.\" There is something to be said for both sides,  and doubtless the truth lies between them, for there were forces making  for disintegration as well as for unification. To the student of the  present day, however, the latter seem to have been the stronger and more  important, although the possibility was never absent that the thirteen  States would go their separate ways.    There are few things so potent as a common danger to bring discordant  elements into working harmony. Several times in the century and a half  of their existence, when the colonies found themselves threatened by  their enemies, they had united, or at least made an effort to unite,  for mutual help. The New England Confederation of 1643 was organized  primarily for protection against the Indians and incidentally against  the Dutch and French. Whenever trouble threatened with any of the  European powers or with the Indians--and that was frequently--a plan  would be broached for getting the colonies to combine their efforts,  sometimes for the immediate necessity and sometimes for a broader  purpose. The best known of these plans was that presented to the Albany  Congress of 1754, which had been called to make effective preparation  for the inevitable struggle with the French and Indians. The beginning  of the troubles which culminated in the final breach with Great Britain  had quickly brought united action in the form of the Stamp Act  Congress of 1765, in the Committees of Correspondence, and then in the  Continental Congress.    It was not merely that the leaven of the Revolution was already working  to bring about the freer interchange of ideas; instinct and experience  led the colonies to united action. The very day that the Continental  Congress appointed a committee to frame a declaration of independence,  another committee was ordered to prepare articles of union. A month  later, as soon as the Declaration of Independence had been adopted, this  second committee, of which John Dickinson of Pennsylvania was chairman,  presented to Congress a report in the form of Articles of Confederation.  Although the outbreak of fighting made some sort of united action  imperative, this plan of union was subjected to debate intermittently  for over sixteen months and even after being adopted by Congress, toward  the end of 1777, it was not ratified by the States until March, 1781,  when the war was already drawing to a close. The exigencies of the hour  forced Congress, without any authorization, to act as if it had been  duly empowered and in general to proceed as if the Confederation had  been formed.    Benjamin Franklin was an enthusiast for union. It was he who had  submitted the plan of union to the Albany Congress in 1754, which with  modifications was recommended by that congress for adoption. It provided  for a Grand Council of representatives chosen by the legislature of  each colony, the members to be proportioned to the contribution of  that colony to the American military service. In matters concerning the  colonies as a whole, especially in Indian affairs, the Grand Council was  to be given extensive powers of legislation and taxation. The executive  was to be a President or Governor-General, appointed and paid by the  Crown, with the right of nominating all military officers, and with a  veto upon all acts of the Grand Council. The project was far in advance  of the times and ultimately failed of acceptance, but in 1775, with the  beginning of the troubles with Great Britain, Franklin took his Albany  plan and, after modifying it in accordance with the experience of  twenty years, submitted it to the Continental Congress as a new plan of  government under which the colonies might unite.    Franklin's plan of 1775 seems to have attracted little attention in  America, and possibly it was not generally known; but much was made of  it abroad, where it soon became public, probably in the same way that  other Franklin papers came out. It seems to have been his practice to  make, with his own hand, several copies of such a document, which he  would send to his friends with the statement that as the document in  question was confidential they might not otherwise see a copy of it. Of  course the inevitable happened, and such documents found their war into  print to the apparent surprise and dismay of the author. Incidentally  this practice caused confusion in later years, because each possessor of  such a document would claim that he had the original. Whatever may have  been the procedure in this particular case, it is fairly evident that  Dickinson's committee took Franklin's plan of 1775 as the starting  point of its work, and after revision submitted it to Congress as their  report; for some of the most important features of the Articles of  Confederation are to be found, sometimes word for word, in Franklin's  draft.    This explanation of the origin of the Articles of Confederation is  helpful and perhaps essential in understanding the form of government  established, because that government in its main features had been  devised for an entirely different condition of affairs, when a strong,  centralized government would not have been accepted even if it had  been wanted. It provided for a \"league of friendship,\" with the primary  purpose of considering preparation for action rather than of taking the  initiative. Furthermore, the final stages of drafting the Articles of  Confederation had occurred at the outbreak of the war, when the people  of the various States were showing a disposition to follow readily  suggestions that came from those whom they could trust and when they  seemed to be willing to submit without compulsion to orders from the  same source. These circumstances, quite as much as the inexperience of  Congress and the jealousy of the States, account for the inefficient  form of government which was devised; and inefficient the Confederation  certainly was. The only organ of government was a Congress in which  every State was entitled to one vote and was represented by a delegation  whose members were appointed annually as the legislature of the State  might direct, whose expenses were paid by the State, and who were  subject to recall. In other words, it was a council of States whose  representatives had little incentive to independence of action.    Extensive powers were granted to this Congress \"of determining on peace  and war,... of entering into treaties and alliances,\" of maintaining an  army and a navy, of establishing post offices, of coining money, and  of making requisitions upon the States for their respective share of  expenses \"incurred for the common defence or general welfare.\" But none  of these powers could be exercised without the consent of nine States,  which was equivalent to requiring a two-thirds vote, and even when such  a vote had been obtained and a decision had been reached, there  was nothing to compel the individual States to obey beyond the mere  declaration in the Articles of Confederation that, \"Every State shall  abide by the determinations of the United States in Congress assembled.\"    No executive was provided for except that Congress was authorized \"to  appoint such other committees and civil officers as may be necessary  for managing the general affairs of the United States under their  direction.\" In judicial matters, Congress was to serve as \"the last  resort on appeal in all disputes and differences\" between States; and  Congress might establish courts for the trial of piracy and felonies  committed on the high seas and for determining appeals in cases of prize  capture.    The plan of a government was there but it lacked any driving force.  Congress might declare war but the States might decline to participate  in it; Congress might enter into treaties but it could not make the  States live up to them; Congress might borrow money but it could not be  sure of repaying it; and Congress might decide disputes without being  able to make the parties accept the decision. The pressure of necessity  might keep the States together for a time, yet there is no disguising  the fact that the Articles of Confederation formed nothing more than a  gentlemen's agreement.        CHAPTER IV. THE NORTHWEST ORDINANCE    The population of the United States was like a body of water that was  being steadily enlarged by internal springs and external tributaries. It  was augmented both from within and from without, from natural increase  and from immigration. It had spread over the whole coast from Maine to  Georgia and slowly back into the interior, at first along the lines of  river communication and then gradually filling up the spaces between  until the larger part of the available land east of the Alleghany  Mountains was settled. There the stream was checked as if dammed by the  mountain barrier, but the population was trickling through wherever it  could find an opening, slowly wearing channels, until finally, when the  obstacles were overcome, it broke through with a rush.    Twenty years before the Revolution the expanding population had reached  the mountains and was ready to go beyond. The difficulty of crossing the  mountains was not insuperable, but the French and Indian War, followed  by Pontiac's Conspiracy, made outlying"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3034"],[0,"The Anti-Slavery Crusade: A Chronicle of the Gathering Storm (#7)"],[1,"them  as members of the Convention because they were women. The tone of  the discussion convinced them that women were looked upon by men with  disdain and contempt. Because the laws of the land and the customs of  society consigned women to an inferior position, and because there would  be no place for effective public work on the part of women until these  laws were changed, both these women became advocates of women's rights  and conspicuous leaders in the initiation of the propaganda. The  Reverend Samuel J. May, of Syracuse, New York, preached a sermon in 1845  in which he stated his belief that women need not expect to have their  wrongs fully redressed until they themselves had a hand in the making  and in the administration of the laws. This is an early suggestion  that equal suffrage would become the ultimate goal of the efforts for  righting women's wrongs.    At the same time there were accessions to the cause from a different  source. In 1833 Oberlin College was founded in northern Ohio. Into some  of the first classes there women were admitted on equal terms with men.  In 1885 the trustees offered the presidency to Professor Asa Mahan, of  Lane Seminary. He was himself an abolitionist from a slave State, and he  refused to be President of Oberlin College unless negroes were admitted  on equal terms with other students. Oberlin thus became the first  institution in the country which extended the privileges of the higher  education to both sexes of all races. It was a distinctly religious  institution devoted to radical reforms of many kinds. Not only was the  use of all intoxicating beverages discarded by faculty and students but  the use of tobacco as well was discouraged.    Within fifteen years after the founding of Oberlin, there were women  graduates who had something to say on numerous questions of public  interest. Especially was this true of the subject of temperance.  Intemperance was a vice peculiar to men. Women and children were the  chief sufferers, while men were the chief sinners. It was important,  therefore, that men should be reached. In 1847 Lucy Stone, an Oberlin  graduate, began to address public audiences on the subject. At the same  time Susan B. Anthony appeared as a temperance lecturer. The manner of  their reception and the nature of their subject induced them to unite  heartily in the pending crusade for the equal rights of women. The three  causes thus became united in one.    Along with the crusade against slavery, intemperance, and women's  wrongs, arose a fourth, which was fundamentally connected with the  slavery question: Quakers and Southern and Western abolitionists were  ardently devoted to the interests of peace. They would abolish slavery  by peaceable means because they believed the alternative was a terrible  war. To escape an impending war they were nerved to do and dare and to  incur great risks. New England abolitionists who labored in harmony with  those of the West and South were actuated by similar motives. Sumner  first gained public notice by a distinguished oration against war.  Garrison went farther: he was a professional non-resistant, a root and  branch opponent of both war and slavery. John Brown was a fanatical  antagonist of war until he reached the conclusion that according to the  Divine Will there should be a short war of liberation in place of the  continuance of slavery, which was itself in his opinion the most cruel  form of war.    Slavery as a legally recognized institution disappeared with the Civil  War. The war against intemperance has made continuous progress and this  problem is apparently approaching a solution. The war against war as  a recognized institution has become the one all-absorbing problem of  civilization. The war against the wrongs of women is being supplanted by  efforts to harmonize the mutual privileges and duties of men and women  on the basis of complete equality. As Samuel May predicted more than  seventy years ago, in the future women are certain to take a hand both  in the making and in the administration of law.        CHAPTER IV. THE TURNING-POINT    The year 1831 is notable for three events in the history of the  anti-slavery controversy: on the first day of January in that year  William Lloyd Garrison began in Boston the publication of the Liberator;  in August there occurred in Southampton, Virginia, an insurrection of  slaves led by a negro, Nat Turner, in which sixty-one white persons  were massacred; and in December the Virginia Legislature began its long  debate on the question of slavery.    On the part of the abolitionists there was at no time any sudden break  in the principles which they advocated. Lundy did nothing but revive and  continue the work of the Quakers and other non-slaveholding classes  of the revolutionary period. Birney was and continued to be a typical  slaveholding abolitionist of the earlier period. Garrison began his  work as a disciple of Lundy, whom he followed in the condemnation of the  African colonization scheme, though he went farther and rejected every  form of colonization. Garrison likewise repudiated every plan  for gradual emancipation and proclaimed the duty of immediate and  unconditional liberation of the slaves.    The first number of the Liberator contained an Address to the Public,  which sounded the keynote of Garrison's career. \"I shall contend for the  immediate enfranchisement of our slave population--I will be as harsh as  truth and as uncompromising as justice on this subject--I do not wish to  think, or speak, or write with moderation--I am in earnest--I will not  equivocate--I will not retreat a single inch, and I WILL BE HEARD!\"    The New England Anti-Slavery Society, of which Garrison was the chief  organizer, was in essential harmony with the societies which Lundy had  organized in other sections. Its first address to the public in 1833  distinctly recognized the separate States as the sole authority in  the matter of emancipation within their own boundaries. Through moral  suasion, eschewing all violence and sedition, its authors proposed to  secure their object. In the spirit of civil and religious liberty and by  appealing to the Declaration of Independence, the Liberty party of 1840  and 1844, by the Freesoil party of 1848, and later by the Republican  party, and that nearly all of the abolitionists continued to be faithful  adherents to those principles, are sufficient proof of the essential  unity of the great anti-slavery movement. The apparent lack of harmony  and the real confusion in the history of the subject arose from the  peculiar character of one remarkable man.    The few owners of slaves who had assumed the role of public defenders of  the institution were in the habit of using violent and abusive language  against anti-slavery agitators. This appeared in the first debate on  the subject during Washington's administration. Every form of rhetorical  abuse also accompanied the outbreak of mob violence against the  reformers at the time of Garrison's advent into the controversy. He was  especially fitted to reply in kind. \"I am accused,\" said he, \"of using  hard language. I admit the charge. I have not been able to find a soft  word to describe villainy, or to identify the perpetrator of it.\" This  was a new departure which was instantly recognized by Southern leaders.  But from the beginning to the bitter end, Garrison stands alone  as preeminently the representative of this form of attack. It was  significant, also, that the Liberator was published in Boston, the  literary center of the country.    There is no evidence that there was any direct connection between the  publication of the Liberator and the servile insurrection which occurred  during the following August. * It was, however, but natural that the  South should associate the two events. A few utterances of the paper  were fitted, if not intended, to incite insurrection. One passage  reads: \"Whenever there is a contest between the oppressed and the  oppressor--the weapons being equal between the parties--God knows that  my heart must be with the oppressed, and always against the oppressor.  Therefore, whenever commenced, I cannot but wish success to all slave  insurrections.\" Again: \"Rather than see men wearing their chains in  a cowardly and servile spirit, I would, as an advocate of peace, much  rather see them breaking the heads of the tyrant with their chains.\"         * Garrison himself denied any direct connection with the Nat       Turner insurrection. See \"William Lloyd Garrison, the Story       of His Life told by His Children,\" vol. I, p. 251.    George Thompson, an English co-laborer with Garrison, is quoted as  saying in a public address in 1835 that \"Southern slaves ought, or  at least had a right, to cut the throats of their masters.\" * Such  utterances are rare, and they express a passing mood not in the least  characteristic of the general spirit of the abolition movement; yet  the fact that such statements did emanate from such a source made it  comparatively easy for extremists of the opposition to cast odium upon  all abolitionists. The only type of abolition known in South Carolina  was that of the extreme Garrisonian agitators, and it furnished at  least a shadow of excuse for mob violence in the North and for complete  suppression of discussion in the South. To encourage slaves to cut  the throats of their masters was far from being a rhetorical figure of  speech in communities where slaves were in the majority. Santo Domingo  was at the time a prosperous republic founded by former slaves who had  exterminated the Caucasian residents of the island. Negroes from Santo  Domingo had fomented insurrection in South Carolina. The Nat Turner  incident was more than a suggestion of the dire possibilities of the  situation. Turner was a trusted slave, a preacher among the blacks. He  succeeded in concealing his plot for weeks. When the massacre began,"]]]
