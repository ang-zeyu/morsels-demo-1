He was one day very       much astonished to learn that his daughter Jenny was fifteen.       Alas! a year afterward the poor child was no longer in the       family, neither was happiness. But for this sad history we must       return to the past. Gretry, during his sojourn at Rome, in the       spring-time of his life, was fond of seeking religious       inspiration in the garden of an almost deserted convent. He       observed one day, in the summer-house, an old monk of venerable       form, who was separating seeds with a meditative air, and at       the same time observing them with a microscope. The       absent-minded musician approached him in silence. 'Do you like       flowers?' the monk asked him. 'Very much,' 'At your age,       however, we only cultivate the flowers of life; the culture of       the flowers of earth is pleasing only to the man who has       fulfilled his task. It is then almost like cultivating his       recollection. The flowers recall the birth, the natal land, the       garden of the family, and what more? You know better than I who       have thrown to forgetfulness all worldly enjoyments!' 'I do not       see, father,' replied Gretry, 'why you separate these seeds       which seem to me to be all alike. 'Look through this       microscope, and see this black speck on those which I place       aside; but I wish to carry the horticultural lesson still       further.' He took a flower-pot, made six holes in the earth,       and planted three of the good seeds, and three of the spotted       ones. 'Recollect that the bad ones are on the side of the       crack, and when you come and take a walk, do not forget to       watch the stalks as they grow.'         \"Gretry found a melancholy charm in returning frequently to the       garden of the convent. As he passed, he each time cast a glance       on the old flower-pot. The six stems at first shot up, each       equally verdant. The spotted seeds soon grew the longest, to       his great surprise. He was about to accuse the old monk of       having lost his wits; but what was afterwards his sorrow, when       he saw his three plants gradually fading away in their       spring-time! With each setting sun a leaf fell and dried up,       while the leaves of the other stems thrived more and more with       every breeze, every ray of the sun, every drop of dew. He went       to dream every day before his dear plants, with exceeding       sadness. He soon saw them wither away, even to the last leaf.       On the same day the others were in flower.         \"This accident of nature was a cruel horoscope. Thirty years       afterward poor Gretry saw three other flowers alike fated, fade       and fall under the wintry wind of death. He had forgotten the       name of the flowers of the Roman convent, but in dying he still       repeated the names of the others. They were his three       daughters, Jenny, Lucile, and Antoinette. 'Ah!' exclaimed the       poor musician, in relating the death of his three daughters,       'I have violated the laws of nature to obtain genius. I have       watered with my blood the most frivolous of my operas, I have       nourished my old mother, I have seized on reputation by       exhausting my heart and my soul; Nature has avenged herself on       my children! My poor children, I foredoomed them to death!'         \"Gretry's daughters all died at the age of sixteen. There is       something strange in their life and in their death, which       strikes the dreamer and the poet. This sport of destiny, this       freak of death, this vengeance of Nature, appears here invested       with all the charms of romance. You will see.         \"Jenny had the pale, sweet countenance of a virgin. On seeing       her, Greuze said one day, 'If I ever paint Purity, I shall       paint Jenny.' 'Make haste!' murmured Gretry, already a prey to       sad presentiments. 'Then she is going to be married?' said       Greuze. Gretry did not answer. Soon, however, seeking to blind       himself, he continued: 'She will be the staff of my old age;       like Antigone, she will lead her father into the sun at the       decline of life.'         \"The next day Gretry came unexpectedly upon Jenny, looking more       pale and depressed than ever. She was playing on the       harpischord, but sweetly and slowly. As she was playing an air       from _Richard Coeur-de-Lion_, in a melancholy strain, the       poor father fancied that he was listening to the music of       angels. One of her friends entered. 'Well, Jenny, you are going       to-night to the ball?' 'Yes, yes, to the ball,' answered poor       Jenny, looking toward heaven; and suddenly resuming, 'No, I       shall not go, my dance is ended.' Gretry pressed his daughter       to his heart, 'Jenny, are you suffering?' 'It is over!' said       she.         \"She bent her head and died instantly, without a struggle! Poor       Gretry asked if she was asleep. She slept with the angels.         \"Lucile was a contrast to Jenny; she was a beautiful girl, gay,       enthusiastic, and frolicksome, with all the caprices of such a       disposition. She was almost a portrait of her father, and       possessed, besides, the same heart and the same mind. 'Who       knows,' said poor Gretry, 'but that her gayety may save her.'       She was unfortunately one of those precocious geniuses who       devour their youth. At thirteen she had composed an opera which       was played every where, _Le Marriage d'Antonio_. A journalist,       a friend of Gretry, who one day found himself in Lucile's       apartment, without her being aware of it, so much was she       engrossed with her harp, has related the rage and madness which       transported her during her contests with inspiration, that was       often rebellious. 'She wept, she sang, she struck the harp with       incredible energy. She either did not see me, or took no notice       of me; for my own part, I wept with joy, in beholding this       little girl transported with so glorious a zeal, and so noble       an enthusiasm for music.'         \"Lucile had learned to read music before she knew her alphabet.       She had been so long lulled to sleep with Gretry's airs, that       at the age when so many other young girls think only of hoops       and dolls, she had found sufficient music in her soul for the       whole of a charming opera. She was a prodigy. Had it not been       for death, who came to seize her at sixteen like her sister,       the greatest musician of the eighteenth century would, perhaps,       have been a woman. But the twig, scarcely green, snapped at the       moment when the poor bird commenced her song. Gretry had Lucile       married at the solicitation of his friends. 'Marry her, marry       her,' they incessantly repeated; 'if Love has the start of       Death, Lucile is safe.' Lucile suffered herself to be married       with the resignation of an angel, foreseeing that the marriage       would not be of long duration. She suffered herself to be       married to one of those artists of the worst order, who have       neither the religion of art nor the fire of genius, and who       have still less heart, for the heart is the home of genius. The       poor Lucile saw at a glance the desert to which her family had       exiled her. She consoled herself with a harp and a harpsichord;       but her husband, who had been brought up like a slave, cruelly       took delight, with a coward's vengeance, in making her feel all       the chains of Hymen. She would have died, like Jenny, on her       father's bosom, amidst her loving family, after having sung her       farewell song; but thanks to this barbarous fellow, she died in       his presence, that is to say, alone. At the hour of her death,       'Bring me my harp!' said she, raising herself a little. 'The       doctor has forbidden it,' said this savage. She cast a bitter,       yet a suppliant look upon him. 'But as I am dying!' said she.       'You will die very well without that.' She fell back on her       pillow. 'My poor father,' murmured she, 'I wished to bid you       adieu on my harp; but here I am not free except to die!'       Lucile, it is the nurse who related the scene, suddenly       extended her arms, called Jenny with a broken voice, and fell       asleep like her for ever.         \"Antoinette was sixteen. She was fair and smiling like the       morn, but she was fated to die like the others. Gretry prayed       and wept, as he saw her growing pale; but death was not stopped       so easily. _Cruel that he is, he stops his ears, there is no       use to pray to him!_ Gretry, however, still hoped. 'God,' said       he, 'will be touched by my thrice bitter tears.' He almost       abandoned music, in order to have more time to consecrate to       his dear Antoinette. He anticipated all her fancies, dresses,       and ornaments, books and excursions,--in a word, she enjoyed to       her heart's desire every pleasure the world could afford. At       each new toy she smiled with that divine smile which seems       formed for heaven. Gretry succeeded in deceiving himself; but       she one day revealed to him all her ill-fortune in these words,       which accidentally escaped from her: 'My godmother died on the       scaffold: she was a godmother of bad augury, Jenny died at       sixteen, Lucile died at sixteen, and I am now sixteen myself.'       The godmother of Antoinette was the queen Maria Antoinette.         \"Another day, Antoinette was meditating over a pink at the       window. On seeing her with this flower in her hand, Gretry       imagined that the poor girl was suffering herself to be carried       away by a dream of love. It was the dream of death! He soon       heard Antoinette murmur; '_I shall die this spring, this       summer, this autumn, this winter!_' She was at the last leaf.

I sho do 'member when dat man Sherman an' his  mens marched through Orange County, but, it didn' take no army of  Yankees to ruin my white folks home, it took jus' one Yankee, but even  dat didn' bow my Mistis' head.    \"I ain't never seed nobody as proud as my Mis' 'Riah Cotton. She never  bowed her head to trouble nor nobody; she never even bowed her head in  chu'ch. When de preacher prayed she jus' folded her hands an' set up  straight, facin' de Lawd wid no fear. No, suh, my Mistis ain't gwine  bow her head no time. Young Mis' Laughter broke her mammy's heart, but  she ain't make her bend her head.    \"Mis' Laughter's sho nuff name was Mis' Clorena Cotton. She wasn' tall  an' dark like Mis' 'Riah; she was little an' roun' an' pretty as a  thorn flower, all pink an' gol'. She was jus' like a butterfly, never  still a minute, skippin' here an' yonder, laughin' wid everybody. Dat's  whare she got her name. Us niggers 'gun to call her Mis' Laughter kaze  she was so happy. She was de only one dat could make Mis' 'Riah smile.  She would run up to Mis' 'Riah an' ruffle her hair dat she done comb  back so slick an' smooth, den she would stick a red rose behin' her  ear, an' say: 'Now, pretty Mammy, you look like you did when Pappy come  cou'tin'.' Marse Ned would lay down his paper an' look fus' at Mis'  'Riah den at Mis' Laughter, an' for a minute Mis' 'Riah would smile,  den she would look firm an' say to Mis' Laughter, 'Don't you know dat  rightousness an' virtue am more 'ceptable to de Lawd den beauty?

Den befo' Mis' 'Riah could speak her mind, Mis'  Laughter done gone skippin' down de hall, her little feets in de gol'  slippers twinklin' from de ruffles of her pantalets. Everybody on de  place love dat chile an' de house wasn' never de same after she done  gone away.    \"My gran'mammy, Rowena, say dat Mis' 'Riah was bawn for trouble. She  was bawn de las' day of March 'tween midnight an' day. De moon was on  de wane, an' jus 'as Mistis was bawn de wind come down de chimbley an'  blew de ashes out on de hearth. Gran'mammy say dat mean trouble an'  death; dat new bawn baby ain't never gwine keep long de things she love  de mos', an' she better never love nobody too well, if she do dey gwine  be took away from her, an' trouble sho did follow Mis' 'Riah after she  growed up.    \"When de war come Marse Ned went off to fight. He was Marse General  Cotton den. Dat didn't leave nobody at home 'cept Mis' 'Riah, her  mammy, Mis' Roberta Davis, but we called her ole Mistis, den dare was  Mis' Laughter an' young Marse Jerome. Young Marse wasn' but fifteen  when de war started, but dey got him in de las' call an' he didn' never  come back no more.    \"De plantation was big, but Mis' 'Riah 'tended to things an' handled de  niggers same as a man. De fus' year of de war she rode a hoss 'bout de  fields like an overseer, seein' after de cotton an' cawn an' taters.  But de Yankees come an' set fire to de cotton; dey took de cawn to dey  camp for dey hosses, an' dey toted off de taters to eat. De nex year  Mis' 'Riah didn' plant no cotton a tall kaze de seeds an' gin done been  burned up, but she had de niggers plant cawn, taters an' a good garden.  Dat fall de wind blew de hickory leaves to de no'th an' by spring  trouble done come sho nuff. Dey was a drouth an' de cawn didn' come up;  de garden burned to pa'chment, but de taters done all right. Wid all  dat Mis' 'Riah held up her head an' kep' goin'. Den one day a buzzard  flew over de house top an' his wings spread a shadow out on de roof.  Dat night death come an' got Ole Mistis. She passed on to glory in her  sleep. ''Twas de lawd's will,' Mis' 'Riah tole gran'mammy, an' she  still held up her head. But Gran'mammy said dat if somebody had shot  dat buzzard an' wiped his shadow off de roof Ole Mistis wouldn' have  gone nowhare.    \"De nex' spring dey wasn' much to plant.
