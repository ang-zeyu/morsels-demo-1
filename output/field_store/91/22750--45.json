[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2745"],[0,"Karl Ludwig Sand (#7)"],[1," continued slowly to  mature the plan in his head in order to familiarise himself with its  execution; but all the impressions arising from this thought remained in  his own mind, and none was manifested on the surface. To everyone else  he was the same; but for some little time past, a complete and unaltered  serenity, accompanied by a visible and cheerful return of inclination  towards life, had been noticed in him. He had made no charge in the  hours or the duration of his studies; but he had begun to attend the  anatomical classes very assiduously. One day he was seen to give even  more than his customary attention to a lesson in which the professor was  demonstrating the various functions of the heart; he examined with the  greatest care the place occupied by it in the chest, asking to have some  of the demonstrations repeated two or three times, and when he went out,  questioning some of the young men who were following the medical  courses, about the susceptibility of the organ, which cannot receive  ever so slight a blow without death ensuing from that blow: all this  with so perfect an indifference and calmness that no one about him  conceived any suspicion.    Another day, A. S., one of his friends, came into his room. Sand, who  had heard him coming up, was standing by the table, with a paper-knife  in his hand, waiting for him; directly the visitor came in, Sand flung  himself upon him, struck him lightly on the forehead; and then, as he  put up his hands to ward off the blow, struck him rather more violently  in the chest; then, satisfied with this experiment, said:--    \"You see, when you want to kill a man, that is the way to do it; you  threaten the face, he puts up his hands, and while he does so you thrust  a dagger into his heart.\"    The two young men laughed heartily over this murderous demonstration,  and A. S. related it that evening at the wine-shop as one of the  peculiarities of character that were common in his friend. After the  event, the pantomime explained itself.    The month of March arrived. Sand became day by day calmer, more  affectionate, and kinder; it might be thought that in the moment of  leaving his friends for ever he wished to leave them an ineffaceable  remembrance of him. At last he announced that on account of several  family affairs he was about to undertake a little journey, and set about  all his preparations with his usual care, but with a serenity never  previously seen in him. Up to that time he had continued to work as  usual, not relaxing for an instant; for there was a possibility that  Kotzebue might die or be killed by somebody else before the term that  Sand had fixed to himself, and in that case he did not wish to have lost  time. On the 7th of March he invited all his friends to spend the  evening with him, and announced his departure for the next day but one,  the 9th. All of them then proposed to him to escort him for some  leagues, but Sand refused; he feared lest this demonstration, innocent  though it were, might compromise them later on. He set forth alone,  therefore, after having hired his lodgings for another half-year, in  order to obviate any suspicion, and went by way of Erfurt and Eisenach,  in order to visit the Wartburg. From that place he went to Frankfort,  where he slept on the 17th, and on the morrow he continued his journey  by way of Darmstadt. At last, on the 23rd, at nine in the morning, he  arrived at the top of the little hill where we found him at the  beginning of this narrative. Throughout the journey he had been the  amiable and happy young man whom no one could see without liking.    Having reached Mannheim, he took a room at the Weinberg, and wrote his  name as \"Henry\" in the visitors' list. He immediately inquired where  Kotzebue lived. The councillor dwelt near the church of the Jesuits; his  house was at the corner of a street, and though Sand's informants could  not tell him exactly the letter, they assured him it was not possible to  mistake the house. [At Mannheim houses are marked by letters, not by  numbers.]    Sand went at once to Kotzebue's house: it was about ten o'clock; he was  told that the councillor went to walk for an hour or two every morning  in the park of Mannheim. Sand inquired about the path in which he  generally walked, and about the clothes he wore, for never having seen  him he could only recognise him by the description. Kotzebue chanced to  take another path. Sand walked about the park for an hour, but seeing no  one who corresponded to the description given him, went back to the  house.    Kotzebue had come in, but was at breakfast and could not see him.    Sand went back to the Weinberg, and sat down to the midday table d'hote,  where he dined with an appearance of such calmness, and even of such  happiness, that his conversation, which was now lively, now simple, and  now dignified, was remarked by everybody. At five in the afternoon he  returned a third time to the house of Kotzebue, who was giving a great  dinner that day; but orders had been given to admit Sand. He was shown  into a little room opening out of the anteroom, and a moment after,  Kotzebue came in.    Sand then performed the drama which he had rehearsed upon his friend A.  S. Kotzebue, finding his face threatened, put his hands up to it, and  left his breast exposed; Sand at once stabbed him to the heart; Kotzebue  gave one cry, staggered, and fell back into an arm-chair: he was dead.    At the cry a little girl of six years old ran in, one of those charming  German children, with the faces of cherubs, blue-eyed, with long flowing  hair. She flung herself upon the body of Kotzebue, calling her father  with piercing cries. Sand, standing at the door, could not endure this  sight, and without going farther, he thrust the dagger, still covered  with Kotzebue's blood, up to the hilt into his own breast. Then, seeing  to his surprise that notwithstanding the terrible wound--he had just  given himself he did not feel the approach of death, and not wishing to  fall alive into the hands of the servants who were running in, he rushed  to the staircase. The persons who were invited were just coming in;  they, seeing a young man, pale and bleeding with a knife in his breast,  uttered loud cries, and stood aside, instead of stopping him. Sand  therefore passed down the staircase and reached the street below; ten  paces off, a patrol was passing, on the way to relieve the sentinels at  the castle; Sand thought these men had been summoned by the cries that  followed him; he threw himself on his knees in the middle of the street,  and said, \"Father, receive my soul!\"    Then, drawing the knife from the wound, he gave himself a second blow  below the former, and fell insensible.    Sand was carried to the hospital and guarded with the utmost strictness;  the wounds were serious, but, thanks to the skill of the physicians who  were called in, were not mortal; one of them even healed eventually; but  as to the second, the blade having gone between the costal pleura and  the pulmonary pleura, an effusion of blood occurred between the two  layers, so that, instead of closing the wound, it was kept carefully  open, in order that the blood extravasated during the night might be  drawn off every morning by means of a pump, as is done in the operation  for empyaemia.    Notwithstanding these cares, Sand was for three months between life and  death.    When, on the 26th of March, the news of Kotzebue's assassination came  from Mannheim to Jena, the academic senate caused Sand's room to be  opened, and found two letters--one addressed to his friends of the  Burschenschaft, in which he declared that he no longer belonged to their  society, since he did not wish that their brotherhood should include a  man about to die an the scaffold. The other letter, which bore this  superscription, \"To my nearest and dearest,\" was an exact account of  what he meant to do, and the motives which had made him determine upon  this act. Though the letter is a little long, it is so solemn and so  antique in spirit, that we do not hesitate to present it in its entirety  to our readers:--    \"To all my own \"Loyal and eternally cherished souls    \"Why add still further to your sadness? I asked myself, and I hesitated  to write to you; but my silence would have wounded the religion of the  heart; and the deeper a grief the more it needs, before it can be  blotted out, to drain to the dregs its cup of bitterness. Forth from my  agonised breast, then; forth, long and cruel torment of a last  conversation, which alone, however, when sincere, can alleviate the pain  of parting.    \"This letter brings you the last farewell of your son and your brother.    \"The greatest misfortune of life far any generous heart is to see the  cause of God stopped short in its developments by our fault; and the  most dishonouring infamy would be to suffer that the fine things  acquired bravely by thousands of men, and far which thousands of men  have joyfully sacrificed themselves, should be no more than a transient  dream, without real and positive consequences. The resurrection of our  German life was begun in these last twenty years, and particularly in  the sacred year 1813, with a courage inspired by God. But now the house  of our fathers is shaken from the summit to the base. Forward! let us  raise it, new and fair, and such as the true temple of the true God  should be.    \"Small is the number of those who resist, and who wish to oppose  themselves as a dyke against the torrent of the progress of higher  humanity among the German people. Why should vast whole masses bow  beneath the yoke of a perverse minority? And why, scarcely healed,  should we fall back into a worse disease than that which we are leaving  behind?    \"Many of these seducers, and those are the most infamous, are playing  the game of corruption with us; among them is Kotzebue, the most cunning  and the worst of all, a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2746"],[0,"Urbain Grandier (#7)"],[1,"convulsions,  and Barre recommenced his prayers and exorcisms, but was soon  interrupted by shrieks; for one of the persons present had seen a black  cat come down the chimney and disappear. Instantly everyone concluded it  must be the devil, and began to seek it out. It was not without great  difficulty that it was caught; for, terrified at the sight of so many  people and at the noise, the poor animal had sought refuge under a  canopy; but at last it was secured and carried to the superior's  bedside, where Barre began his exorcisms once more, covering the cat  with signs of the cross, and adjuring the devil to take his true shape.  Suddenly the 'touriere', (the woman who received the tradespeople,) came  forward, declaring the supposed devil to be only her cat, and she  immediately took possession of it, lest some harm should happen to it.    The gathering had been just about to separate, but Barry fearing that  the incident of the cat might throw a ridiculous light upon the evil  spirits, resolved to awake once more a salutary terror by announcing  that he was going to burn the flowers through which the second spell had  been made to work. Producing a bunch of white roses, already faded, he  ordered a lighted brazier to be brought. He then threw the flowers on  the glowing charcoal, and to the general astonishment they were consumed  without any visible effect: the heavens still smiled, no peal of thunder  was heard, and no unpleasant odour diffused itself through the room.  Barre feeling that the baldness of this act of destruction had had a bad  effect, predicted that the morrow would bring forth wondrous things;  that the chief devil would speak more distinctly than hitherto; that he  would leave the body of the superior, giving such clear signs of his  passage that no one would dare to doubt any longer that it was a case of  genuine possession. Thereupon the criminal lieutenant, Henri Herve, who  had been present during the exorcism, said they must seize upon the  moment of his exit to ask about Pivart, who was unknown at Loudun,  although everyone who lived there knew everybody else. Barre replied in  Latin, \"Et hoc dicet epuellam nominabit\" (He will not only tell about  him, but he will also name the young girl). The young girl whom the  devil was to name was, it may be recollected, she who had introduced the  flowers into the convent, and whose name the demon until now had  absolutely refused to give. On the strength of these promises everyone  went home to await the morrow with impatience.          CHAPTER IV      That evening Grandier asked the bailiff for an audience. At first he had  made fun of the exorcisms, for the story had been so badly concocted,  and the accusations were so glaringly improbable, that he had not felt  the least anxiety. But as the case went on it assumed such an important  aspect, and the hatred displayed by his enemies was so intense, that the  fate of the priest Gaufredi, referred to by Mignon, occurred to Urbain's  mind, and in order to be beforehand with his enemies he determined to  lodge a complaint against them. This complaint was founded on the fact  that Mignon had performed the rite of exorcism in the presence of the  civil lieutenant, the bailiff, and many other persons, and had caused  the nuns who were said to be possessed, in the hearing of all these  people, to name him, Urbain, as the author of their possession. This  being a falsehood and an attack upon his honour, he begged the bailiff,  in whose hands the conduct of the affair had been specially placed, to  order the nuns to be sequestered, apart from the rest of the sisterhood  and from each other, and then to have each separately examined. Should  there appear to be any evidence of possession, he hoped that the bailiff  would be pleased to appoint clerics of well-known rank and upright  character to perform whatever exorcisms were needful; such men having no  bias against him would be more impartial than Mignon and his adherents.  He also called upon the bailiff to have an exact report drawn up of  everything that took place at the exorcisms, in order that, if  necessary, he as petitioner might be able to lay it before anyone to  whose judgment he might appeal. The bailiff gave Grandier a statement of  the conclusions at which he had arrived, and told him that the exorcisms  had been performed that day by Barre, armed with the authority of the  Bishop of Poitiers himself. Being, as we have seen, a man of common  sense and entirely unprejudiced in the matter, the bailiff advised  Grandier to lay his complaint before his bishop; but unfortunately he  was under the authority of the Bishop of Poitiers, who was so prejudiced  against him that he had done everything in his power to induce the  Archbishop of Bordeaux to refuse to ratify the decision in favour of  Grandier, pronounced by the presidial court. Urbain could not hide from  the magistrate that he had nothing to hope for from this quarter, and it  was decided that he should wait and see what the morrow would bring  forth, before taking any further step.    The impatiently expected day dawned at last, and at eight o'clock in the  morning the bailiff, the king's attorney, the civil lieutenant, the  criminal lieutenant, and the provost's lieutenant, with their respective  clerks, were already at the convent. They found the outer gate open, but  the inner door shut. In a few moments Mignon came to them and brought  them into a waiting-room. There he told them that the nuns were  preparing for communion, and that he would be very much obliged to them  if they would withdraw and wait in a house across the street, just  opposite the convent, and that he would send them word when they could  come back. The magistrates, having first informed Mignon of Urbain's  petition, retired as requested.    An hour passed, and as Mignon did not summon them, in spite of his  promise, they all went together to the convent chapel, where they were  told the exorcisms were already over. The nuns had quitted the choir,  and Mignon and Barre came to the grating and told them that they had  just completed the rite, and that, thanks to their conjurations, the two  afflicted ones were now quite free from evil spirits. They went on to  say that they had been working together at the exorcism from seven  o'clock in the morning, and that great wonders, of which they had drawn  up an account, had come to pass; but they had considered it would not be  proper to allow any one else to be present during the ceremony besides  the exorcists and the possessed. The bailiff pointed out that their  manner of proceedings was not only illegal, but that it laid them under  suspicion of fraud and collusion, in the eyes of the impartial:  Moreover, as the superior had accused Grandier publicly, she was bound  to renew and prove her accusation also publicly, and not in secret;  furthermore, it was a great piece of insolence on the part of the  exorcists to invite people of their standing and character to come to  the convent, and having kept them waiting an hour, to tell them that  they considered them unworthy to be admitted to the ceremony which they  had been requested to attend; and he wound up by saying that he would  draw up a report, as he had already done on each of the preceding days,  setting forth the extraordinary discrepancy between their promises and  their performance. Mignon replied that he and Barre had had only one  thing in view, viz. the expulsion of the, demons, and that in that they  had succeeded, and that their success would be of great benefit to the  holy Catholic faith, for they had got the demons so thoroughly into  their power that they had been able to command them to produce within a  week miraculous proofs of the spells cast on the nuns by Urbain Grandier  and their wonderful deliverance therefrom; so that in future no one  would be able to doubt as to the reality of the possession. Thereupon  the magistrates drew up a report of all that had happened, and of what  Barre and Mignon had said. This was signed by all the officials present,  except the criminal lieutenant, who declared that, having perfect  confidence in the statements of the exorcists, he was anxious to do  nothing to increase the doubting spirit which was unhappily so prevalent  among the worldly.    The same day the bailiff secretly warned Urbain of the refusal of the  criminal lieutenant to join with the others in signing the report, and  almost at the same moment he learned that the cause of his adversaries  was strengthened by the adhesion of a certain Messire Rene Memin,  seigneur de Silly, and prefect of the town. This gentleman was held in  great esteem not only on account of his wealth and the many offices  which he filled, but above all on account of his powerful friends, among  whom was the cardinal-duke himself, to whom he had formerly been of use  when the cardinal was only a prior. The character of the conspiracy had  now become so alarming that Grandier felt it was time to oppose it with  all his strength. Recalling his conversation with the bailiff the  preceding day, during which he had advised him to lay his complaint  before the Bishop of Poitiers, he set out, accompanied by a priest of  Loudun, named Jean Buron, for the prelate's country house at Dissay. The  bishop, anticipating his visit, had already given his orders, and  Grandier was met by Dupuis, the intendant of the palace, who, in reply  to Grandier's request to see the bishop, told him that his lordship was  ill. Urbain next addressed himself to the bishop's chaplain, and begged  him to inform the prelate that his object in coming was to lay before  him the official reports which the magistrates had drawn up of the  events which had taken place at the Ursuline convent, and to lodge a  complaint as to the slanders and accusations of which he was the victim.  Grandier spoke so urgently that the chaplain could not refuse to"]]]
