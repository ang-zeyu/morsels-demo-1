Close  by the tomb of this saint is the tomb of his grandson, Aaron Burr, who  killed Hamilton.    The literary reputation of Jonathan Edwards has turned, like the  vicissitudes of his life, upon factors that could not be foreseen. His  contemporary fame was chiefly as a preacher, and was due to sermons  like those upon \"God Glorified in Man's Dependence\" and \"The Reality of  Spiritual Life,\" rather than to such discourses as the Enfield sermon,  \"Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God,\" which in our own day is the best  known of his deliverances. Legends have grown up around this terrific  Enfield sermon. Its fearful power over its immediate hearers cannot be  gainsaid, and it will long continue to be quoted as an example of the  length to which a Calvinistic logician of genius was compelled by his  own scheme to go. We still see the tall, sweet-faced man, worn by his  daily twelve hours of intense mental toil, leaning on one elbow in the  pulpit and reading from manuscript, without even raising his gentle  voice, those words which smote his congregation into spasms of terror  and which seem to us sheer blasphemy.    Yet the \"Farewell Sermon of 1750\" gives a more characteristic view of  Edwards's mind and heart, and conveys an ineffaceable impression of  his nobility of soul. His diction, like Wordsworth's, is usually plain  almost to bareness; the formal framework of his discourses is obtruded;  and he hunts objections to their last hiding place with wearisome  pertinacity. Yet his logic is incandescent. Steel sometimes burns to the  touch like this, in the bitter winters of New England, and one wonders  whether Edwards's brain was not of ice, so pitiless does it seem.  His treatise denying the freedom of the will has given him a European  reputation comparable with that enjoyed by Franklin in science and  Jefferson in political propaganda. It was really a polemic demonstrating  the sovereignty of God, rather than pure theology or metaphysics.  Edwards goes beyond Augustine and Calvin in asserting the arbitrary will  of the Most High and in \"denying to the human will any self-determining  power.\" He has been refuted by events and tendencies, such as the growth  of historical criticism and the widespread acceptance of the doctrine of  evolution, rather than by the might of any single antagonist. So, too,  the Dred Scott decision of Chief Justice Taney, holding that the slave  was not a citizen, was not so much answered by opponents as it was  superseded by the arbitrament of war. But the idealism of this lonely  thinker has entered deeply and permanently into the spiritual life of  his countrymen, and he will continue to be read by a few of those who  still read Plato and Dante.    \"My mother grieves,\" wrote Benjamin Franklin to his father in 1738,  \"that one of her sons is an Arian, another an Arminian. What an Arminian  or an Arian is, I cannot say that I very well know. The truth is I  make such distinctions very little my study.\" To understand Franklin's  indifference to such distinctions, we must realize how completely he  represents the secularizing tendencies of his age. What a drama of  worldly adventure it all was, this roving life of the tallow-chandler's  son, who runs away from home, walks the streets of Philadelphia with  the famous loaves of bread under his arm, is diligent in business,  slips over to London, where he gives lessons in swimming and in total  abstinence, slips back to Philadelphia and becomes its leading citizen,  fights the long battle of the American colonies in London, sits in the  Continental Congress, sails to Europe to arrange that French Alliance  which brought our Revolution to a successful issue, and comes home at  last, full of years and honors, to a bland and philosophical exit from  the stage!    He broke with every Puritan tradition. The Franklins were relatively  late comers to New England. They sprang from a long line of blacksmiths  at Ecton in Northamptonshire. The seat of the Washingtons was not far  away, and Franklin's latest biographer points out that the pink-coated  huntsmen of the Washington gentry may often have stopped at Ecton to  have their horses shod at the Franklin smithy. Benjamin's father came  out in 1685, more than fifty years after the most notable Puritan  emigration. Young Benjamin, born in 1706, was as untouched by the  ardors of that elder generation as he would have been by the visions of  Dante--an author, by the way, whom he never mentions, even as he never  mentions Shakespeare. He had no reverence for Puritan New England. To  its moral beauty, its fine severity, he was wholly blind. As a boy he  thriftily sold his Pilgrim's \"Progress.\" He became, in the new fashion  of that day, a Deist. Like a true child of the eighteenth century,  his attitude toward the seventeenth was that of amused or contemptuous  superiority. Thackeray has somewhere a charming phrase about his own  love for the back seat of the stage-coach, the seat which, in the old  coaching days, gave one a view of the receding landscape. Thackeray,  like Burke before him, loved historical associations, historical  sentiment, the backward look over the long road which humanity has  traveled. But Franklin faced the other way. He would have endorsed his  friend Jefferson's scornful sentence, \"The dead have no rights.\" He  joined himself wholly to that eighteenth century in which his own lot  was cast, and, alike in his qualities and in his defects, he became one  of its most perfect representatives.    To catch the full spirit of that age, turn for an instant to the London  of 1724--the year of Franklin's arrival. Thirty-six years have elapsed  since the glorious Revolution of 1688; the Whig principles, then  triumphant, have been tacitly accepted by both political parties; the  Jacobite revolt of 1715 has proved a fiasco; the country has accepted  the House of Hanover and a government by party leadership of the House  of Commons, and it does not care whether Sir Robert Walpole buys a  few rotten boroughs, so long as he maintains peace with Europe  and prosperity at home. England is weary of seventeenth century  \"enthusiasm,\" weary of conflict, sick of idealism. She has found in the  accepted Whig principles a satisfactory compromise, a working theory of  society, a modus vivendi which nobody supposes is perfect but which will  answer the prayer appointed to be read in all the churches, \"Grant us  peace in our time, O Lord.\" The theories to which men gave their lives  in the seventeenth century seem ghostly in their unreality; but the  prize turnips on Sir Robert's Norfolk farm, and the wines in his cellar,  and the offices at his disposal--these are very real indeed. London  merchants are making money; the squire and the parson are tranquilly  ruling the country parishes; the philosophy of John Locke is everywhere  triumphant. Mr. Pope is the poet of the hour, and his \"Essay on Man,\"  counseling acceptance of our mortal situation, is considered to be the  last word of human wisdom and of poetical elegance. In prose, the style  of the \"Spectator\" rules--an admirable style, Franklin thought, and he  imitated it patiently until its ease and urbanity had become his own.  And indeed, how much of that London of the third decade of the century  passed into the mind of the inquisitive, roving, loose-living printer's  apprentice from Philadelphia! It taught him that the tangible world is  the real world, and that nothing succeeds like success; but it never  even whispered to him that sometimes nothing damns like success.    In his limitations, no less than in his power of assimilation, Franklin  was the representative man of his era. He had no artistic interests, no  liking for metaphysics after his brief devotion, in early manhood, to  the dialogues of Plato. He taught himself some Latin, but he came to  believe that the classics had little significance and that they should  be superseded by the modern languages. For the mediaeval world he had no  patience or understanding. To these defects of his century we must  add some failings of his own. He was not always truthful. He had an  indelible streak of coarseness. His conception of the \"art of virtue\"  was mechanical. When Carlyle called Franklin the \"father of all the  Yankees,\" we must remember that the Scotch prophet hated Yankees and  believed that Franklin's smooth, plausible, trader type of morality was  only a broad way to the everlasting bonfire.    But it is folly to linger over the limitations of the tallow-chandler's  son. The catalogue of his beneficent activity is a vast one. Balzac once  characterized him as the man who invented the lightning-rod, the  hoax, and the republic. His contributions to science have to do with  electricity, earthquakes, geology, meteorology, physics, chemistry,  astronomy, mathematics, navigation of air and water, agriculture,  medicine, and hygiene. In some of these fields he did pioneer work  of lasting significance. His teachings of thrift and prudence, as  formulated in the maxims of Poor Richard, gave him a world-wide  reputation. He attacked war, like Voltaire, not so much for its  wickedness as for its folly, and cheerfully gave up many years of a long  life to the effort to promote a better understanding among the nations  of the world.    It is perhaps needless to add what all persons who love good writing  know, that Benjamin Franklin was a most delightful writer. His letters  cover an amusing and extraordinary variety of topics. He ranges from  balloons to summer hats, and from the advantages of deep ploughing to  bifocal glasses, which, by the way, he invented. He argues for sharp  razors and cold baths, and for fresh air in the sleeping-room. He  discusses the morals of the game of chess, the art of swimming, the  evils of smoky chimneys, the need of reformed spelling. Indeed, his  passion for "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34110"],[0,"Deadfalls and Snares (#7)"],[1," lower end to fly  up. Now place the beveled end of the short lath in the slot of the  long lath and the trap is set.    Hang your bait from the drop bars, under the weight, about eight  inches from the front. The game will then come to the side of the  trap. Never tie bait on the lath.    Set the trap in front of the hole, block up by setting up two stones  V shape on the upper side of hole, forcing game thru the trap to  enter or come out.        CHAPTER VIII.    SOME TRIGGERS.    During my trapping experiences I remember of visiting an old  trapper's deadfalls and at that time I had never seen or used any  trigger other than the figure 4, but this trapper used the prop and  spindle. I looked at several of his traps; in fact, went considerably  out of my way to look at some eight or ten of them. Two of these  contained game--a skunk and opossum. I had often heard of these  triggers, but was skeptical about them being much good. I now saw  that these triggers were all right and on visiting my traps again set  a few of them with these triggers. Since that time I have never used  the figure 4.    The prop and spindle I know will look to many too hard to \"go off,\"  but they can be set so that they will go off fairly easy. It is not  necessary that the trap be set so that the least touch will make it  go off. It is best to have the trap set so that mice nibbling at bait  will not throw it.    Trappers who have never used the deadfall will, no doubt, find that  after they use them a short time and become better acquainted with  their construction and operation that they will catch more game than  at first. This is only natural as all must learn from experience  largely, whether at trapping or anything else.    The prop is a straight piece about seven inches long and about  one-half inch in diameter. The spindle, or long trigger, is about the  size of the prop, but should be sixteen or eighteen inches long with  a prong cut off within two inches of the end to help hold the bait on  more securely. See cut elsewhere showing these triggers and of the  figure likewise. These illustrations will give a better idea of how  the triggers are made to those who have never seen or used them.      * * *    I saw some time ago where a brother wanted to know how to make a  deadfall, writes an Illinois trapper. I send a picture of one that I  think is far ahead of any that I have seen in the H-T-T yet, that is,  the triggers. I have seen deadfall triggers that would catch and not  fall when the bait was pulled at, but there is no catch to these.    Trigger No. 1 is stub driven in the ground with a notch cut in the  upper end for end of bait. Stick No. 5 to fit in No. 3 is another  stub driven in ground for bait stick No. 5 to rest on top. No. 3 is a  stick, one end laid on top of bait stick outside of stub No. 2, the  other end on top of lower pole. No. 4 is the prop stick. One end is  set on stick No. 3 about one inch inside the lower pole the other end  underneath the upper pole. The X represents the bait. When the bait  stick is pulled out of notch in stub No. 1, the upper pole comes down  and has got your animal.      [Illustration: ILLINOIS TRAPPER'S TRIGGERS.]    If you find your bait is caught between the poles you may know the  bait is not back in the box far enough. If you find the trap down and  bait and bait stick gone, you may know that the bait is too far back.  The animal took his whole body in before he pulled the bait.    I have tried to describe this trap for the ones that don't know how  to make a deadfall.    Somebody wants to know how to make a good deadfall. Well the plans  published in back numbers of H-T-T are all right except the figure  four sticks and bait. Make your sticks like this, and you will be  pleased with the way they work, says an experienced trapper.      [Illustration: TRIP TRIGGERS.]    No. 2 flat view. The trigger sets in the slanting cut in side of No.  2. Don't put bait on trigger. Put it in back end of pen and pin it to  the ground. Turn trigger across opening slanted slightly in, then you  get them by neck or shoulders. The longer the slot in the trigger,  the harder they will trip. Set as straight up as possible.    Make 1 and 2 of hard wood. Saw a block 3 1/2 inches long and split  into 3/4 inch squares. Make cuts square with a saw and split out the  part you don't want. Bevel ends with a hatchet. Make trigger of green  hard wood stick with bark on.      * * *    I cut a tree from 8 to 10 inches in diameter and cut off 7 feet long.  Split the piece open and bury one piece on a level with the  earth--split side up--and place the other half on top. I hew off any  bumps and make a perfect fit. Then I cut out bushes the size of my  arm, and drive them down on each side of my fall and leave them an  inch or two higher than I expect my top log to be when set. Be sure  to begin far enough at the back to force the animals to go in at the  front. I use the figure four triggers and tie the bait to the long  trigger.    Another trigger is made as follows: Cut two forks and lay pole across  just in front of the log on top of the forks. Take another piece of  timber about four feet long, tie a string to each end and let one end  have a trigger and the other be tied on your top log. I drive a nail  in the top log and tie the string to it, and I call this my Fly  trigger. It acts as a lever, for when the fly comes up over the piece  on the forks and the trigger goes over half way back by the side of  the log, and the trigger about a foot long--straight and thin, and  sticks under the log--have a short trigger tied to the fly pole and a  forked sapling the size of your finger and long enough to stick in  the ground to hold the trigger. Put the bait on long trigger and  catch the short trigger through the fork and let it catch the long  trigger. This trigger leaves the fall open in front and is the one I  prefer.    Take two small logs about 10 or 12 feet long, large enough to break a  coon's back, and make a pen about midway, or one-third from front  end, to put the bait in, and the trigger. Two foot boards, or  saplings will do, and make the pen so that the animal will have to  step across the bottom log and take the bait, and be sure to set so  that the top log will fall across the mink, coon, skunk, or opossum,  as they are the animals I kill with the fall. Use fly pole triggers  as above, for this deadfall.    I make these falls near the runways of the animals I wish to catch.  When I am sure to stay at a place, I build my falls in the summer and  by the trapping time they look old and natural.        CHAPTER IX.    TRIP TRIGGERS.    The deadfall shown here can be used at dens or in paths where animals  travel frequently. When set across the entrance of dens it will catch  an animal going in without bait. That is, it will catch an animal  going in, as the triggers are so constructed that they can only be  pushed towards the bait as shown in illustration. If the trap is to  be used at dens without bait the regular figure 4 triggers had best  be used, but set extending along the log instead of back into the  pen. An animal in entering will strike the trigger and down comes the  fall.    The trap shown here and the triggers are made as follows: Cut two  logs and lay one on the ground. This log should be at least four feet  long. Place it firmly on the ground with flat side up. This log need  not be as flat as shown in illustration, but should be flattened  slightly. Drive two stakes three feet long within a foot or so of one  end (8) and (9).    Now come to the other end and drive two more (10) and (11). Stake ten  which is directly opposite from (11) you want to be careful not to  split, as one of the triggers rests on it. The fall is now placed in  position, that is the upper log. The end of this is split and a stake  driven in the ground so that the fall will not turn between the  stakes but is held firmly. See that the fall will work easily up and  down; that the stakes are not so close together that the fall binds,  yet it wants to fit snugly.      [Illustration: ANIMAL ENTERING TRIP DEADFALL.]    Cut trip stick (4) and trigger (3), lifting the fall up with one knee  and place end of (3) onto (4) slightly, so that a small pressure on  (4) will spring the trap. After you have the trap set spring it to  see that it works all right. If the trap works all right and you are  setting across the entrance of a den the pen of course is not wanted.  If you are setting in paths or near dens, drive stakes in a  semi-circle as shown in illustration, but the stakes should stick  above the ground some eighteen inches or about as high as the \"fall\"  pole when set. It is a good plan to throw leaves or grass on the  stakes.    A small notch (5) should be cut in upright post (8) for trip stick to  fit in to hold it up to that end. Be careful, however, that this  notch is not cut too deep. The bait (6) is placed back in the pen and  fastened with wire or a stake driven thru it into the ground. The  open space over bait is now covered over and the entire trap can be  made to not look so suspicious by cutting brush and throwing over it  excepting in front of the bait. An animal in going in for bait steps  on or pushes the long stick (marked 4 at one end and 5 at the other)  off of (3) and is usually caught.      * * *    This is another good trip trigger deadfall. A short log should be  laid on the ground and the two stakes driven opposite each other as  in the trap just described. These stakes are not shown, as a better  view of the triggers and workings of the trap can be had by omitting  these.    In the illustration the \"fall\" pole is weighted, but it is best to  have the pole heavy enough and not weighted. The stakes on which the  upper or cross piece is nailed should be from twelve to eighteen  inches apart. The cross piece need not be heavy, yet should be strong  so that the weight of the fall will not bend"]]]
