Where are the eggs deposited? What is the number of the eggs?    How soon do they hatch?      11. What is the food of the larva or nymph? Are the food habits    of the insects harmful to man? If so, how?      12. Describe the larva as to form, color, and appendages. Is it    capable of locomotion?      13. Is the metamorphosis complete or incomplete? If complete,    describe the pupa and tell where it may be found.          _Drawings._    There should be one drawing of the insect to show its general  characteristics; usually a dorsal view is best. For other drawings  ask your instructor.      8. A REVIEW OF INSECTS          _Directions._    The answers to questions in this study may be conveniently written in  the form of a table. Construct this table by placing the topics at  the left and the names of insects at the top. Allow ample space,  about one half inch for the horizontal spaces and one and one half  inches in width for the vertical columns. Use one or two insects from  each of the principal orders, letting the table extend across two  opposite pages.          _Topics._    1. What is the habitat?    2. What regions has the body?    3. How many antennae? What is their form?    4. What kinds of eyes has the insect? How many of each kind?    5. How many legs?    6. For what kind of locomotion are the legs adapted? Which legs are  thus used?    7. How many wings? Membranous or thickened?    8. What is the position of the wings when at rest?    9. If the fore wings are thickened, what is their texture,--leathery,  smooth and sheath-like, partly membranous, covered with scales?    10. What kind of mouth parts,--jaws for biting, a beak for piercing,  a tube for sucking, adapted for both sucking and biting?    11. By what means is respiration accomplished?      Summary of Important Points from the Table      1. What characters are common to all the insects described in the  table?    2. What are the various types of wings? Why do they vary?    3. What are the various types of legs? How are they characterized?    4. What are the various types of mouth parts?    5. Show how the variations in insects are related to the habitat and  mode of life of the insect.      9. KEY TO THE PRINCIPAL ORDERS OF INSECTS       A^1 Insects with _no_ wings. (See list below.)

Give examples to show how greatly the food of insects and the  method of obtaining it varies.    7. Give some illustrations of the great muscular development of  insects. Why is this needed?    8. In what various ways are insects protected against their enemies?  Give examples to illustrate your statement.    9. Show how and why the great numbers of insects have affected the  structure and mode of life of the insects.      Classification      1. By means of illustrations from your studies of insects show how  classification is based upon likeness of structure.    2. In the same manner show how differences in structure affect  classification.    3. Show how variation in the wings and mouth parts is used to  separate insects into orders.    4.
