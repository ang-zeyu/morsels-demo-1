Exceptions to the last mentioned character are _S. fumeus_  and _S. dispar_. The subgenus _Sorex_ in North America should include  only the following species: _S. jacksoni_, _S. tundrensis_, _S.  arcticus_, _S. gaspensis_, _S. dispar_, _S. fumeus_, _S. trowbridgii_,  _S. merriami_, and all the members of the Mexican _S. saussurei_  group.    The subgenera _Otisorex_ and _Sorex_ probably separated in early  Pleistocene or late Pliocene. _Sorex_ is unknown in North America  earlier than the late Pliocene (Simpson, 1945:51).    In the genus _Microsorex_ the characters of the subgenus _Otisorex_  are carried to an extreme; the unicuspid ridges are prominent and end  in distinct cusplets, and the 3rd unicuspid is not merely smaller than  the 4th, but is reduced almost to the vanishing point. In addition,  the post-mandibular foramen is absent. Although it is closer  structurally to _Otisorex_ than to _Sorex_, the recognition of  _Microsorex_ as a distinct genus seems warranted.    Figure 15 is intended to represent graphically some of the  relationships discussed above. It must be re-emphasized that much of  it is purely speculative, especially as regards actual time when  various separations took place. It will be noted that I have indicated  most separations as having taken place in interglacial ages. They are  generally regarded as periods of warmth and aridity and, therefore,  probably are times of segmentation of the ranges of boreal mammals and  hence times exceptionally favorable to the process of speciation.  Glacial ages, characterized by extensive and continuous areas of  boreal habitat, probably were times of relatively unrestricted gene  flow between many populations of boreal mammals and hence not  favorable to rapid speciation.      =Sorex vagrans=    Wandering Shrew    The size of the wandering shrew varies from small in the subspecies  _monticola_ and _vagrans_ to large in the subspecies _pacificus_. The  tail makes up from a little more than a third to almost half of the  total length. The color pattern ranges from tricolored through  bicolored to almost monocolored. Color ranges from reddish (Sayal or  Snuff Brown) to grayish in summer pelage and from black to light gray  in winter. Diagnostic dental characters include: 3rd upper unicuspid  smaller than 4th, and unicuspids, except 5th, with a pigmented ridge  extending from near apex of each tooth medially to cingulum and  sometimes ending as internal cusplet. _S. vagrans_ differs from  members of the _ornatus_ group in less flattened skull, and in more  ventrally situated foramen magnum that encroaches more on the  basioccipital and less on the supraoccipital. The wandering shrew  differs from _S. trowbridgii_ and _S. saussurei_ in the dental  characters mentioned above. These dental characters also serve to  distinguish _S. vagrans_ readily from _S. cinereus_, _S. merriami_,  and _S. arcticus_ which may occur with _vagrans_. The large marsh  shrew and water shrew, _S. palustris_ and _S. bendiri_, can be  distinguished at a glance from _S. vagrans_ by larger size and darker  color.       [Illustration: FIG. 15. Diagrammatic representation of the        probable phylogeny of _Sorex vagrans_ and its near relatives.]    In the following treatment of the 29 subspecies of _Sorex vagrans_,  the subspecies are arranged in geographic sequence, beginning with the  southernmost large subspecies on the California coast and proceeding  clockwise, north, east, south, and then west back to the starting  point.      =Sorex vagrans sonomae= Jackson        _Sorex pacificus sonomae_ Jackson, Jour.

Washington, 31:127,      November 29, 1918.        _Sorex pacificus yaquinae_, V. Bailey, N. Amer. Fauna, 55:364,      August 29, 1936.    _Type._--Adult female, skin and skull; No. 73051 U. S. Biol. Surv.  Coll., obtained on July 18, 1895, by B. J. Bretherton, from Yaquina  Bay, Lincoln Co., Oregon.    _Diagnosis._--Size large for the species; average and extreme external  measurements of 11 specimens from Oakridge, Lane Co., Oregon, are:  total length, 125.3 (11-136); tail, 55.1 (49-61); hind foot, 14.9  (14-16). Color reddish in summer, browner or grayer in winter.    _Comparisons._--See account of _S. v. pacificus_ for comparison with  that subspecies. Larger and more reddish than _S. v. bairdi_ with  which it intergrades to the north and east. Much larger and more  reddish than the sympatric _S. v. vagrans_.    _Remarks._--The name _yaquinae_ actually applies to a population of  intergrades between _pacificus_ and _bairdi_. There is much variation  over the range of the subspecies, and individuals from the western and  southern parts are larger than those from the west slope of the  Cascades. Specimens from Vida and McKenzie Bridge are smaller than  those from Mapleton, Mercer, and the type locality but still seem  closer to _yaquinae_ than to topotypes of _bairdi_. Between Marshfield  and Umpqua on the one hand, and the Columbia River and the Cascade  Mountains on the other, the size of _Sorex vagrans_ decreases quite  rapidly from the large_ pacificus_ to the smaller _permiliensis_. Size  decreases less rapidly northward along the coast than it does eastward  toward the mountains; consequently, at any given latitude, coastal  shrews are larger than mountain shrews. In this area of rapid change  in size it is difficult to draw subspecific boundaries between  _pacificus_, _yaquinae_, and _bairdi_, and this must be done somewhat  arbitrarily.    Jackson (1928:141) remarked upon the possibility that intergradation  between _pacificus_ and _yaquinae_ took place. He noted also the close  resemblance between _yaquinae_ and _bairdi_, and stated (_loc. cit._)  that specific affinity between the two might be demonstrated with more  specimens. He had a series of eight specimens from Vida, Oregon, seven  of which he assigned to _S. o. bairdi_ and one to _yaquinae_. I have  examined these specimens and find no more variation between the  largest and the smallest than would be expected in any normally  variable series of shrews. Vernon Bailey (1936:364) arranged  _yaquinae_ as a subspecies of _pacificus_ without giving his reasons  for so doing.    _Specimens examined._--Total number, 65.

These turtles were found on the forest floor, in small sluggish streams,  and in pools in the forest. One adult male had, in life, the top of the  head yellow with black spots; the stripes on the head and neck were red.  Specimens were obtained both in the dry and rainy seasons. The local  name for both species of _Kinosternon_ is _pochitoque_.      =Kinosternon leucostomum= Dumeril and Bibron          Chinaja, 3; 15 km. NW of Chinaja, 1; 20 km. NNW of Chinaja, 2.    Individuals of this turtle were found on the forest floor and in small  sluggish streams. In life most specimens had a tan or pale brown head  with pinkish tan stripes on the head and neck. All individuals were  obtained in February and March. No ecological differences between this  species and _K. acutum_ were evident.      =Staurotypus triporcatus= (Wiegmann)          Paso Subin, 1.    This species is represented in the collection by one complete shell  found on the bank of the Rio Subin. The carapace has a length of 292 mm.  The local name is _Guao_. Natives stated that this turtle was not  uncommon in clear rivers and lakes, a habitat suggested for the species  by Stuart (1958:19).      =Dermatemys mawi= Gray          Chinaja, 1; Rio San Roman, 4.    The record from Chinaja is based on a carapace found in a chiclero camp,  where the turtle evidently had been brought for food. The four specimens  from the Rio San Roman were obtained from edges of deep pools in clear  water. In adult males the top of the head was reddish orange in life.  One of the specimens from the Rio San Roman currently is living in the  Philadelphia Zoological Gardens. The local name for this turtle is  _tortuga blanca_; it is sought for its meat.      =Geoemyda areolata= (Dumeril and Bibron)          Chinaja, 2.    Two specimens were obtained from dense forest at Chinaja. The local name  is _mojina_.      =Pseudemys scripta ornata= (Gray)          Paso Subin, 1.    One subadult was obtained from clear water in the Rio Subin. The stripes  on the head and neck were yellow; there was no red \"ear\" on the side of  the head. The stripes on the forelimbs were orange, and the ocelli on  the carapace were red. The local name is _jicotea_.      =Coleonyx elegans elegans= Gray          Toocog, 1.    One adult male having a snout-vent length of 89 mm. was found beneath a  log in the forest. Locally this gecko is known as _escorpion_; the  natives believe it to be deadly poisonous. The use of the name  _escorpion_ seems to be restricted to lizards thought to be venomous.  Nearly everywhere in Mexico and Central America some species of lizard  carries this appellation. In El Peten I heard the name used only for  _Coleonyx elegans_ and _Thecadactylus rapicaudus_; in the lowlands of  Guerrero, Mexico, the name is applied to geckos of the genus  _Phyllodactylus_. The venomous lizards of the genus _Heloderma_ in the  lowlands of western Mexico are called _escorpiones_. In the mountains of  southern Mexico various skinks of the genus _Eumeces_, as well as  lizards of the genus _Xenosaurus_, carry the same appellation. _Abronia_  in the mountains of Mexico and _Gerrhonontus_ throughout Mexico and  Central America likewise are called _escorpiones_. Although many people  in various parts of Middle America consider most lizards poisonous,  there is a unanimity of opinion concerning the venomous qualities of the  various kinds of _escorpiones_. I know of only two other lizards in  Middle America that are so uniformly regarded in native beliefs; these  are _Enyaliosaurus clarki_ in the Tepalcatepec Valley in Michoacan,  called _nopiche_, and _Phrynosoma asio_ in western Mexico, called  _cameleon_.      =Sphaerodactylus lineolatus= Lichtenstein          15 km. NW of Chinaja, 1; Toocog, 1.    These small geckos were much more abundant than the few specimens  indicate. They frequently were seen on the trunks of corozo palms, where  they quickly took refuge in crevices at the bases of the fronds. The  specimen obtained at Toocog was under the bark of a standing dead tree.  In life the ventral surface of the tail was orange. The individual from  Chinaja was in the leaf litter on the ground at the base of a dead tree.      =Thecadactylus rapicaudus= (Houttuyn)          15 km. NW of Chinaja, 1; 20 km. NNW of Chinaja, 2.    Two specimens were found beneath the bark of standing dead trees;  another was found in the crack in the trunk of a mahogany tree about 13  meters above the ground. In life the dorsum was yellowish tan with dark  brown markings; the venter was yellowish tan with brown flecks, and the  iris was olive-tan. The largest specimen is a male having a snout-vent  length of 95 mm.; all specimens have regenerated tails. Individuals when  caught twisted their bodies and attempted to bite; upon grabbing a  finger they held on with great tenacity.      =Anolis biporcatus= (Wiegmann)          14 km. NNW of Chinaja, 1; 17 km. NNW of Chinaja, 1; 20 km. NNW        of Chinaja, 3; 30 km. NNW of Chinaja, 1; Sayaxche, 1.    All specimens of this large anole were obtained from trees. Some  individuals were found in the tops of trees immediately after they were  felled. My limited observations on this anole suggest that it is an  inhabitant of the upper levels of the forest. In life an adult male from  20 kilometers north-northwest of Chinaja was brilliant green above; the  eyelids were bright yellow; the belly was white. The outer part of the  dewlap was pale orange, and the median part was pinkish blue. A juvenile  having a snout-vent length of 47 mm. and a tail length of 86 mm. was  pale grayish green with pale gray flecks on the dorsum. The largest male  has a snout-vent length of 98 mm. and a tail length of 217 mm.; the same  measurements of the largest female are 89 and 213 mm. This species,  together with all other anoles, is known locally as _toloque_.      =Anolis capito= Peters          Chinaja, 2; 14 km. NNW of Chinaja, 1; Rio de la Pasion, 1.    All individuals were observed on trunks of trees between heights of  three and ten meters above the ground. The largest male has a snout-vent  length of 81 mm. and a tail length of 155 mm.; the same measurements of  the largest female are 87 and 150 mm. The streaked brown dorsum,  combined with the lizards' habit of pressing the body against the trunks  of trees, make this anole especially difficult to see.      =Anolis humilis uniformis= Cope          Chinaja, 24; 15 km. NW of Chinaja, 22; 20 km. NNW of Chinaja,        6; Sayaxche, 1.    This small dull brown anole is a characteristic inhabitant of the forest  floor, where the lizards move about in a series of quick, short hops and  thus easily evade capture. Three individuals were found on small bushes,  and four were on the bases of trees; otherwise, all were observed on the  ground. Observations indicate that this species is active throughout  the day, except during and immediately after heavy rains. The males have  a deep red dewlap with a dark blue median spot.      =Anolis lemurinus bourgeaei= Bocourt          Chinaja, 11; 20 km. NNW of Chinaja, 4; 30 km. NNW of Chinaja,        2; Rio de la Pasion, 1; Rio San Roman, 1; Sayaxche, 8; Toocog,        6.    This moderate-sized anole characteristically inhabits the low bushes and  bases of trees in the forest. Individuals were most readily observed on  the buttresses of some of the gigantic mahogany and ceiba trees. When  approached the lizards usually ran around the tree or ducked to the  other side of the buttress; if the observer moved closer, they jumped to  the ground and ran off. None was observed to ascend large trees. Some  individuals were observed foraging on the forest floor; these took  shelter on the bases of trees. One individual was sleeping on a palm  frond at night. The adult males have a uniformly orange-red dewlap.      =Anolis limifrons rodriguezi= Bocourt          15 km. NW of Chinaja, 2; 20 km. NNW of Chinaja, 1.    In dry forests and more open situations than occur at Chinaja this  little anole is abundant, but in the wet forests of southern El Peten,  only three specimens were found. Two were on palm fronds about two  meters above the ground; the other was on a low bush. I suspect that  ecologically this species overlaps _A. humilis uniformis_ and _A.  lemurinus bourgeaei_, but too few observations are recorded to justify a  definite statement at this time.      =Anolis sericeus sericeus= Hallowell          Chinaja, 2; Sayaxche, 1; Toocog, 1.    This small anole is common and widespread in the Atlantic lowlands of  southern Mexico and northern Central America; usually it inhabits  sub-humid regions. Consequently, its presence in the wet forests of  southern El Peten was unexpected. The specimens from Chinaja were  sleeping on low bushes at night, whereas the others were found on bushes  by day.      =Basiliscus vittatus= Wiegmann          Chinaja, 6; Rio de la Pasion, 1; Rio San Roman, 1; Sayaxche,        3; Toocog, 1.    Individuals of this abundant species were most frequently seen in dense  bushes along the margins of rivers or small streams. None was observed  far from water. These lizards, like the anoles, are known locally as  _toloque_.      =Corythophanes cristatus= (Merrem)          Chinaja, 3; 20 km. NNW of Chinaja, 1.    Three individuals were found on tree trunks; the fourth was on a thick  vine about one meter above the ground. The two largest males have  snout-vent lengths of 121 and 115 mm. and tail lengths of 265 and 243  mm. The largest female (KU 59603), obtained on June 28, has a snout-vent  length of 125 mm. and a tail length of 247 mm. This individual contained  eight ova varying in greatest diameter from 10.6 to 12.2 (average 11.1)  mm. Also present are numerous ovarian eggs having diameters up to about  3.5 mm.    One of the large males displayed a defensive behavior prior to capture.  When first observed the lizard was clinging to a tree trunk about one  and one-half meters above the ground."]]]
