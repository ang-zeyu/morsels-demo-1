Because,  if not, I think we ought to be going.\"    \"Yes,\" said Jimmy; \"I do want my tea!\"    \"Tea!\" said the unseen Mabel scornfully. \"Do you mean to say  you'd go off to your teas and leave me after getting me into this  mess?\"    \"Well, of all the unfair Princesses I ever met!\" Gerald began. But  Kathleen interrupted    \"Oh, don't rag her,\" she said. \"Think how horrid it must be to be  invisible!\"    \"I don't think,\" said the hidden Mabel, \"that my aunt likes me very  much as it is. She wouldn't let me go to the fair because I'd  forgotten to put back some old trumpery shoe that Queen Elizabeth  wore I got it out from the glass case to try it on.\"    \"Did it fit?\" asked Kathleen, with interest    \"Not it much too small,\" said Mabel. \"I don't believe it ever fitted  anyone.\"    \"I do want my tea!\" said Jimmy    \"I do really think perhaps we ought to go,\" said Gerald. \"You see,  it isn't as if we could do anything for you.\"    \"You'll have to tell your aunt,\" said Kathleen kindly    \"No, no, no!\" moaned Mabel invisibly; \"take me with you. I'll  leave her a note to say I've run away to sea.\"    \"Girls don't run away to sea.\"\"    They might,\" said the stone floor between the pillars, \"as  stowaways, if nobody wanted a cabin boy cabin girl, I mean.\"    \"I'm sure you oughtn't,\" said Kathleen firmly.    \"Well, what am I to do?\"    \"Really,\" said Gerald, \"I don't know what the girl can do. Let her  come home with us and have \"    \"Tea oh, yes,\" said Jimmy, jumping up.    \"And have a good council.\"    \"After tea,\" said Jimmy    \"But her aunt'lI find she's gone.\"    \"So she would if I stayed.\"    \"Oh, come on,\" said Jimmy.    \"But the aunt'll think something's happened to her.\"    \"So it has.\"    \"And she'll tell the police, and they'll look everywhere for me.\"    \"They'll never find you,\" said Gerald. \"Talk of impenetrable  disguises!\"    \"I'm sure,\" said Mabel, \"aunt would much rather never see me  again than see me like this. She'd never get over it; it might kill her  she has spasms as it is. I'll write to her, and we'll put it in the big  letter-box at the gate as we go out. Has anyone got a bit of pencil  and a scrap of paper?\"    Gerald had a note-book, with leaves of the shiny kind which you  have to write on, not with a blacklead pencil, but with an ivory  thing with a point of real lead. And it won't write on any other  paper except the kind that is in the book, and this is often very  annoying when you are in a hurry. Then was seen the strange  spectacle of a little ivory stick, with a leaden point, standing up at  an odd, impossible-looking slant, and moving along all by itself as  ordinary pencils do when you are writing with them    \"May we look over?\" asked Kathleen.    There was no answer. The pencil went on writing.    \"Mayn't we look over?\" Kathleen said again.\"    Of course you may!\" said the voice near the paper. \"I nodded,  didn't I? Oh, I forgot, my nodding's invisible too.\"T    he pencil was forming round, clear letters on the page torn out of  the note-book. This is what it wrote:    \"DEAR AUNT, I am afraid you will not see me again for some  time. A lady in a motor-car has adopted me, and we are going  straight to the coast and then in a ship. It is useless to try to follow  me. Farewell, and may you be happy. I hope you enjoyed the fair    MABEL.\"    \"But that's all lies,\" said Jimmy bluntly.    \"No, it isn't; it's fancy,\" said Mabel. \"If I said I've become invisible,  she'd think that was a lie, anyhow.\"\"    Oh, come along,\" said Jimmy; \"you can quarrel just as well  walking.\"    Gerald folded up the note as a lady in India had taught him to do  years before, and Mabel led them by another and very much nearer  way out of the park. And the walk home was a great deal shorter,  too, than the walk out had been.    The sky had clouded over while they were in the Temple of Flora,  and the first spots of rain fell as they got back to the house, very  late indeed for tea.    Mademoiselle was looking out of the window, and came herself to  open the door    \"But it is that you are in lateness, in lateness!\" she cried. \"You  have had a misfortune no? All goes well?\"    \"We are very sorry indeed,\" said Gerald. \"It took us longer to get  home than we expected. I do hope you haven't been anxious. I have  been thinking about you most of the way home.\"    \"Go, then,\" said the French lady, smiling; \"you shall have them in  the same time the tea and the supper.\"    Which they did.    \"How could you say you were thinking about her all the time?\"  said a voice just by Gerald's ear, when Mademoiselle had left them  alone with the bread and butter and milk and baked apples. \"It was  just as much a lie as me being adopted by a motor lady.\"    \"No, it wasn't,\" said Gerald, through bread and butter. \"I was  thinking about whether she'd be in a wax or not. So there!\"    There were only three plates, but Jimmy let Mabel have his, and  shared with Kathleen. It was rather horrid to see the bread and  butter waving about in the air, and bite after bite disappearing  from it apparently by no human agency; and the spoon rising with  apple in it and returning to the plate empty. Even the tip of the  spoon disappeared as long as it was in Mabel's unseen mouth; so  that at times it looked as though its bowl had been broken off    Everyone was very hungry, and more bread and butter had to be  fetched. Cook grumbled when the plate was filled for the third  time.    \"I tell you what,\" said Jimmy; \"I did want my tea.\"    \"I tell you what,\" said Gerald; \"it'll be jolly difficult to give Mabel  any breakfast. Mademoiselle will be here then. She'd have a fit if  she saw bits of forks with bacon on them vanishing, and then the  forks coming back out of vanishment, and the bacon lost for ever.\"    \"We shall have to buy things to eat and feed our poor captive in  secret,\" said Kathleen.    \"Our money won't last long,\" said Jimmy, in gloom. \"Have you got  any money?\"    He turned to where a mug of milk was suspended in the air without  visible means of support.    \"I've not got much money,\" was the reply from near the milk, \"but  I've got heaps of ideas.\"    \"We must talk about everything in the morning,\" said Kathleen.  \"We must just say good night to Mademoiselle, and then you shall  sleep in my bed, Mabel. I'll lend you one of my nightgowns.\"    \"I'll get my own tomorrow,\" said Mabel cheerfully.    \"You'll go back to get things?\"    \"Why not? Nobody can see me. I think I begin to see all sorts of  amusing things coming along. It's not half bad being invisible.\"    It was extremely odd, Kathleen thought, to see the Princess's  clothes coming out of nothing. First the gauzy veil appeared  hanging in the air. Then the sparkling coronet suddenly showed on  the top of the chest of drawers. Then a sleeve of the pinky gown  showed, then another, and then the whole gown lay on the floor in  a glistening ring as the unseen legs of Mabel stepped out of it. For  each article of clothing became visible as Mabel took it off. The  nightgown, lifted from the bed, disappeared a bit at a time.    \"Get into bed,\" said Kathleen, rather nervously.    The bed creaked and a hollow appeared in the pillow. Kathleen put  out the gas and got into bed; all this magic had been rather  upsetting, and she was just the least bit frightened, but in the dark  she found it was not so bad. Mabel's arms went round her neck the  moment she got into bed, and the two little girls kissed in the kind  darkness, where the visible and the invisible could meet on equal  terms.    \"Good night,\" said Mabel. \"You're a darling, Cathy; you've been  most awfully good to me, and I shan't forget it. I didn't like to say  so before the boys, because I know boys think you're a muff if  you're grateful. But I am. Good night.\"    Kathleen lay awake for some time. She was just getting sleepy  when she remembered that the maid who would call them in the  morning would see those wonderful Princess clothes.    \"I'll have to get up and hide them,\" she said. \"What a bother!\"    And as she lay thinking what a bother it was she happened to fall  asleep, and when she woke again it was bright morning, and Eliza  was standing in front of the chair where Mabel's clothes lay,  gazing at the pink Princess-frock that lay on the top of her heap  and saying, \"Law!\"    \"Oh, don't touch, please!\" Kathleen leaped out of bed as Eliza was  reaching out her hand.    \"Where on earth did you get hold of that?\"    \"We're going to use it for acting,\" said Kathleen, on the desperate  inspiration of the moment. \"It's lent me for that.\"    \"You might show me, miss,\" suggested Eliza.    \"Oh, please not!\" said Kathleen, standing in front of the chair in  her nightgown. \"You shall see us act when we are dressed up.  There! And you won't tell anyone, will you?\"    \"Not if you're a good little girl,\" said Eliza. \"But you be sure to let  me see when you do dress up. But where\"    Here a bell rang and Eliza had to go, for it was the postman, and  she particularly wanted to see him.    \"And now,\" said Kathleen, pulling on her first stocking, \"we shall  have to do the acting. Everything seems very difficult.\"    \"Acting isn't,\" said Mabel; and an unsupported stocking waved in  the air and quickly vanished. \"I shall love it.,\"    \"You forget,\" said Kathleen gently, \"invisible actresses can't take  part in plays unless they're magic ones.\"    \"Oh,\" cried a voice from under a petticoat that hung in the air, \"I've  got such an idea!\"    \"Tell it us after breakfast,\" said Kathleen, as the water in the basin  began to splash about and to drip from nowhere back into itself.  \"And oh! I do wish you hadn't written such whoppers to your aunt.  I'm sure we oughtn't to tell lies for anything.\"    \"What's the use of telling the truth if nobody believes you?\""]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35409"],[0,"Beauty: Illustrated Chiefly (#7)"],[1," that beauty results from the perfection, chiefly of  external forms, and the correspondence of that perfection with superiority  of internal functions; on the more or less perfect perception of which,  love, intermarriage, and the condition of our race, are dependant.    This mode of considering the elements, the nature, and the consequences of  beauty, is equally applicable to the two sexes; but, in woman, the form of  the species presents peculiar modifications.    In this work, it is the form of woman which is chosen for examination,  because it will be found, by the contrast which is perpetually necessary,  to involve a knowledge of the form of man, because it is best calculated  to ensure attention from men, and because it is men who, exercising the  power of selection, have alone the ability thus to ensure individual  happiness, and to ameliorate the species; which are the objects of this  work.    Let it not be imagined that the views now taken are less favorable to  woman than to man. Whatever ensures the happiness of one ensures that of  the other; and as the variety of forms and functions in man requires as  many varieties in woman, it is not to exclusion or rejection with regard  to woman that this work tends, but to a reasoned guidance in man's choice,  to the greater suitableness of all intermarriages, and to the greater  happiness of woman as well as man, both in herself and in her progeny.    But notwithstanding the importance of any work which is in any degree  calculated to promote such an object, some will tell us that the analysis  of female beauty, on which it can alone be founded, is indelicate.--I  shall, on the contrary, show that decency demands this analysis; that the  interests of nature, of truth, of the arts, and of morality, demand it.    Our present notions of sexual decency belong more to art than to nature,  and may be divided into artificial and artful decencies.    Artificial decencies are illustrated in the habits of various nations.  They have their origin in cold countries, where clothing is necessary, and  where a deviation from the degree or mode of clothing constitutes  indecency. They could not exist in hot climates, where clothing is  scarcely possible.    In hot climates, natural decency can alone exist; and there is not, I  believe, one traveller in such countries whose works do not prove that  natural decency there exists as much as in cold countries. In  exemplification of this, I make a single quotation: it would be easy to  make thousands. Burchell, speaking of the Bushmen Hottentots, says: \"The  natural bashful reserve of youth and innocence is to be seen as much among  these savages, as in more polished nations; and the young girls, though  wanting but little of being perfectly naked, evinced as just a sense of  modesty as the most rigid and careful education could have given them.\"    In mild climates, the half-clothed or slightly-clothed people appear to be  somewhat at a loss what to do. Fond of decorations, like all savage or  half-civilized people, they seem to be divided between the tatooing and  painting of hot climates, and the clothing of cold ones; and when they  adopt the latter, they do not rightly know what to conceal.    The works of all travellers afford the same illustrations of this fact. I  quote one. Kotzebue describes the custom among the Tartar women of Kasan,  of flying or of concealing their countenance from the sight of a stranger.  The necessity of conforming to this custom threw into great embarrassment  a young woman who was obliged to pass several times before the German  traveller. She at first concealed her face with her hands; but, soon  embarrassed by that attitude, she removed the veil which covered her  bosom, and threw it over her face. \"That,\" adds Kotzebue, \"was, as we say,  uncovering Paul to cover Jacques: the bosom remained naked. To cover that,  she next showed what should have been concealed; and if anything escaped  from her hands, she stooped, and then,\" says Kotzebue, \"I saw both one  and the other.\"    In colder or more uncertain climates, the greatest degree of covering  constitutes the greatest degree of artificial decency: fashion and decency  are confounded. Among old-fashioned people, of whom a good example may be  found in old countrywomen of the middle class in England, it is indecent  to be seen with the head unclothed; such a woman is terrified at the  chance of being seen in that condition; and if intruded on at such a time,  she shrieks with terror and flies to conceal herself. In the equally  polished dandy of the metropolis, it is indecent to be seen without  gloves. Which of these respectable creatures is the most enlightened, I do  not take upon me to say; but I believe that the majority of suffrages  would be in favor of the old woman.    So entirely are these decencies artificial, that any number of them may  easily be created, not merely with regard to man or woman, but even with  regard to domesticated animals. If it should please some persons partially  to clothe horses, cows, or dogs, it would ere long be felt that their  appearing in the streets without trowsers or aprons was grossly indecent.  We might thus create a real feeling of indecency, the perception of a new  impurity, which would take the place of the former absence of all impure  thought, and once established, the evil would be as real as our whims have  made it in other respects.    Moral feeling is deeply injured by this substitution of impure thoughts,  however fancifully founded, for pure ones, or rather for the entire  absence of thought about worthless things. Artificial crimes are thus  made, which are not the less real because artificial; for if aught of this  kind is believed to be right, there is weakness or wrong in its violation.  But violated it must be, if it were but accidentally.    To corrupt minds, this very violation of artificial decency in the case of  woman affords the zest for the sake of which many of these decencies seem  to have been instituted; and thus are created the artful decencies.    The purpose and the zest of artful decency are well illustrated by  coquetry. Coquetry adopts a general concealment, which it well knows can  alone give a sensual and seductive power to momentary exposure. Coquetry  eschews permanent exposure as the bane of sensuality and seduction; and  where these are great, as among the women of Spain, the concealment of  dress is increased, even in warm climates. Nothing can throw greater light  than this does on the nature of these decencies.    That coquetry has well calculated her procedure, does not admit of a  doubt. She appeals to imagination, which she knows will spread charms over  even ugly forms; she seeks the concealment under which sensuality and lust  are engendered; and, in marriage, she at last lifts the veil which  gratifies, only to disgust, and repays a sensual hallucination by years of  misery.    Ought religion to claim the right of saying grace to such unveiling of  concealment and the nuptial rites that follow it? Ought religion to profit  by the impurities of sexual association? Marriage is a civil ceremony in  other countries, even in Scotland. Such profane and profitable sanctions  have nothing to do with primitive Christianity: they are abhorrent to its  letter as well as to its spirit. But worldly and profitable religion is  connected in business with government, under the firm of Church and State,  and drives a thriving trade, in which the junior partner is contented with  the profit arising from the common acts of life, while the senior one  draws much of his living from other rites.[2]    What is said here, is no argument for living nudity: that, our climate and  our customs forbid; and, in so doing, we can only regret that they are  unfavorable to natural purity; while perfect familiarity with the figure  ensures that feeling in the highest degree.    A distinguished artist informs me that greater modesty is nowhere to be  seen than at the Life academy; and it was an observation of the great  Flaxman, that \"the students, in entering the academy, seemed to hang up  their passions with their hats.\" I can, from personal experience, give the  same testimony in behalf of medical students at the dissecting-rooms. The  familiarity of both these classes with natural beauty leads them only to  seek to inform their minds and to purify their taste.[3]    Sinibaldi observes, that \"nothing is more injurious to morals and to  health, than the incitements of the women who in such numbers walk our  streets,\" and that \"the laws as to offences against morals ought certainly  to affect them the moment their language or actions can be deemed  offensive.\" But it is not to those who are critically conversant with the  highest beauty of the human figure, that defective forms, ill-painted  skins, rude manners, and contagious diseases, are at all seductive.    Nothing, then, can be more favorable to virtue than the decoration of  every house with the beautiful copies of the glorious works of ancient  Greece; and it is only humiliating to think that what has been so  extensively done in this respect in the best houses, is less owing to our  own taste than to the poor wanderers from Lucca or Barga. Experiment on  this subject is peculiarly easy in London: let any one spend an hour in  the shop of the very able Mr. Sarti, of Dean street, where he will meet  the most liberal attention, and let him ask himself, in coming out,  whether his moral feeling, as well as his taste, is not improved.    Those who cannot make this experiment, will perhaps be satisfied with the  assurance of Hogarth, who says: \"The rest of the body, not having  advantages in common with the face, would soon satiate the eye, were it  to be as constantly exposed, nor would it have more effect than a marble  statue.\" Surely this is decisive enough in its way! Now let them mark what  follows. \"But,\" he continues,"]]]
