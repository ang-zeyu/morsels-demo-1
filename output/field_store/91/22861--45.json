If he does not, then the sooner professional advice is called in  the better, as you may be certain that something is wrong.      Damaged Food.    Damaged, mouldy, or sour food, the horse, of course, will not eat unless  he is very hungry, and then only sufficient to stay his appetite. Damaged  grain there is no excuse for, and can only be given through carelessness  or indifference on the part of the owner or his servants. Sour food, or  food that has fermented, is, with the best intentions, likely to be placed  before the animal, as it is surprising how soon fermentation will set up  in damp grain in a hot climate. The food should not be damped more than  twenty minutes or half an hour at the most before it is given, and a dirty  bucket will easily contaminate it. In the hot weather in India,  particularly during the rains, when both man and beast are down below par,  very little will put both off their feed. If the food, however, is at all  sour it ought to be at once detected, as the smell is unmistakable.      Irregular Teeth.    In old horses the back teeth get irregular and worn in such a fashion that  the food cannot be masticated and crushed, and is not then properly  digested. The upper jaw of the horse is wider than the lower one, so that  the upper teeth overlap the lower ones at the outside, and the lower ones  the upper at the inside. By continually wearing, the upper back teeth get  worn down more on the inside than the outside, and the lower ones more on  the outside than the inside, or, in other words, the grinding surface of  the teeth, instead of being horizontal, is at an angle or slope. The horse  masticates his food with a sideways motion of the jaws, crushing the food  between the back teeth like mill-stones, so that if the grinding surfaces  of the teeth are not level, but sloped at an angle, they become locked,  and prevent sufficient sideways play of the jaws. If this is suspected,  the back teeth can be easily inspected by turning the horse with his tail  to the sun, grasping the tongue with the left hand and opening the mouth,  while the light is reflected into it by a small looking-glass held in the  right. They can also be felt by putting one's hand on the outside of the  cheek, where the outer edge of the upper teeth can be easily felt, and  pushing the finger inwards and upwards, so as to get on the grinding  surface when the horse opens his mouth, and the angle they are at can be  at once detected through the cheek. This is, of course, only a rough  method of examination, but it gives one a fair idea of the state the  molars are in. If a tooth is broken or deficient, the corresponding one  in the other jaw from not being worn down will become over-grown and fill  up the vacant space, even growing so long as to damage the gum or bone in  the jaw above or below it, as the case may be, and preventing the horse  feeding. If it is one of the front molars, it is possible that the growth  may be detected from outside, but the probabilities are that a more  careful examination will be necessary, and, at all events, professional  skill required to set matters right. Horses also suffer from decayed  teeth; and, in fact, the whole matter of equine dentistry is much more  important than is usually supposed, many animals remaining poor and thin  simply because their teeth are not properly attended to.      Young Horses Cutting Teeth.    Young horses sometimes have great trouble when cutting their teeth, and if  they go off their feed they should be attended to; but this requires  professional skill.      Quidding.    When young horses begin to what is called \"quid\" their food, it is almost  a certain indication that there is something wrong with the mouth.  \"Quidding\" is gathering up a mouthful of hay or grass, rolling it about  in the mouth, and half masticating it till it gets into a lump or ball,  and then spitting it out without swallowing it. Sometimes a dozen or more  of these \"quids\" will be found in the manger or on the stable floor.      Indigestion (_bud hazmie_).    Indigestion, or dyspepsia, which horses suffer from more commonly than the  public imagine, will put them off their feed; but this is a matter for  professional advice and treatment, and it is exceedingly dangerous for the  owner to go trying domestic remedies. I have had many fatal cases of bowel  diseases brought to me that have arisen solely from this cause.      Lampas.    This is a disorder that is firmly fixed in every groom's mind, both  European and native, and is supposed to consist of a swelling or  inflammation of the palate, or \"barbs,\" just behind the upper incisor  teeth. I do not deny for a moment the existence of such a thing, but what  I do maintain is that in 75 per cent. of the cases brought to one, it  exists only in the imagination of the attendant. The popular remedy some  years ago was to cauterize the part with a hot iron, and I have no  hesitation in saying that any one doing this should be indicted for  cruelty to animals. Lately, the popular treatment has been more merciful  in having the part scarified with a lancet, but even this is useless.  Where lampas does exist, there is more or less enlargement and swelling of  the membrane of the entire alimentary canal, but the \"barbs\" of the mouth  being the only part visible, it is popularly supposed to be a local  affection. Under these conditions, it will be readily understood how  utterly useless lancing or scarifying one small part of the affected canal  will be. A small dose of aperient medicine, or even putting the horse on a  laxative diet of bran mash for a few days, will do all that is required,  without having recourse to heroic measures.      Nose-bags (_tobra_).    Nose-bags are sadly neglected by \"syces,\" and unless looked after by the  owner, they never dream of cleaning them, so that, particularly with  leather ones, they get into a very filthy condition, and frequently horses  refuse to eat out of such dirty things. Both mangers and nose-bags should  frequently be washed and scrubbed out with soap, or sand and water.  Nose-bags are, at the best, a necessary evil, and if they have to be used  at all, canvas ones are better than leather, being more easily cleaned. I  only allowed nose-bags to be used when on the march, or out in camp; when  in the stable the horses were fed out of an ordinary bucket, or else a  manger, and even then they were not fastened on the head, but held on the  ground.      Mangers (_kurlie_).    In the stable a manger should be used. In an Indian stable one is easily  made out of a shallow, wide-mouthed earthen vessel (\"gumalo\"), built up  with mud, about three feet high, in the corner. The \"syces\" can do this  themselves, and the gumalo only costs a few pence in the bazaar. I always  had two built in opposite corners, one for food and the other for water.  If for any reason the manger cannot be built, or there is not one in the  stable, then the horse should be fed out of a tin or zinc bucket, or else  off a feeding-sheet. An old gunney-bag, spread out opened at the seams,  answers admirably. The \"syce\" should hold the bucket or sheet while he is  feeding, or the horse is very likely to knock the first over, or tear the  sheet, by pawing at it with his fore feet.      Worms (_kirim_).    Parasites, or worms, in the intestines cause horses to lose condition very  quickly. The most common are long white ones, like ordinary earthworms,  about five to eight inches long; and small, very thin thread-like ones,  about three inches long. They cause the horse to become very unthrifty and  thin, the coat being dull, without the natural gloss that is seen in  health, or as it is termed, \"hide-bound.\" The horse is also apt to back up  against any projection, or into a corner, and rub his tail against the  wall, breaking off the hair, and giving it an unsightly appearance. If  worms are suspected, the \"syce\" should be instructed to look for them in  the horse's droppings in the morning, where the long ones are most likely  to be found; also to examine under his dock, where the small ones will  leave a yellowish incrustation under the root of the tail. An enema of  common salt and water, made by dissolving about a table-spoonful of salt  in a quart of luke-warm water, generally suffices to get rid of the small  ones. The large ones, however, require medical treatment, which should be  left in professional hands. If there are any worms passed, the litter,  droppings, etc., should be carefully burned, and the floor of the stable  scraped and the _debris_ burned, and a new floor laid down.      Rubbing the Tail.    Although commonly due to parasites in the intestines, \"particularly the  small thread-worms,\" with some horses it is a trick; neglect also, and the  irritation caused by dirt, will often cause it. In India it is more often  seen in coarse-bred horses, such as many Australians are, than in  country-breds and Arabs. If it is from dirt, washing the tail well with  soap and water will stop it; if it is a trick, keeping the tail in a  tail-case, which is merely a piece of leather, with buckles and straps to  fasten it on with; or an ordinary roller bandage put round from the tip to  the root will generally stop it.      Scouring (_dast_).    Scouring, or diarrhoea, is usually seen in nervous horses when they get  excited, and, as a rule, disappears when they get quiet again. It is more  commonly seen in light-coloured, or what the horseman calls \"washey,\"  chestnuts and blacks, than any other colour. Some horses will always scour  after a draught of cold water, and with such the chill should be taken off  either by adding a little warm water, or standing the bucket out in the  sun for a couple of hours before it is used. If the scouring persists,  after returning to the stable, let the next feed consist of dry bran, not  \"bran mash,\" and this generally stops it.

Total length, 300-375; tail, 20-43; hind foot, 64-81; ear  from notch (dry), 50-64; weight (topotypes of _S. b. macrorhinus_) 16  [MALE] 679 (561-832), 22 [FEMALE] 707 (517-843) grams. Body uniformly  dark brown or brownish gray, but tail whitish beneath; hair on  midventral part of body gray at base; only a slight crenulation of ridge  of enamel which separates an individual molariform tooth into anterior  and posterior sections. From _Sylvilagus audubonii_, the only other  species of _Sylvilagus_ in the same geographic area, _S. bachmani_  differs in smaller size, less white on underparts (the hairs on the  midventral part of the body being gray instead of white at base),  shorter ears and legs, and a less crenulated ridge of enamel separating  the anterior and posterior parts of a molariform tooth.    The brush rabbit is a Pacific Coastal species; as may be seen from  figure 9 on the next page, this species occurs from the Columbia River  on the north to the tip of Baja California on the south. Nowhere, so far  as I can learn, does it occur as far east as the crest of the  Cascade-Sierra Nevada Mountain Chain. Throughout its range the brush  rabbit is closely associated with--in fact, lives in--the chaparral that  is dense enough to afford protection from raptorial birds and the larger  carnivorous mammals. The rabbit's reliance on protective cover is so  great that, as pointed out on an earlier page, a person can turn this  trait to advantage in protecting cultivated crops from inroads that the  rabbits might make on them. The protection is afforded by clearing the  brush from a strip forty-five feet wide so that the cleared strip  intervenes between the cultivated crops and the brushy shelter. The  rabbits will not risk crossing the open strip and hence do not reach the  growing crops.    [Illustration: FIG. 9.

Only one  observer (Orr, 1940: 173) has reported an individual entering a hole. In  patches of chaparral in which the rabbits live they make runways that  are especially well defined at the edges of the brush. The outer  entrance to a runway is tunnellike and one to two feet from the outer  entrance there is a special form that serves as a lookout post. A brush  rabbit that is about to venture into the open ordinarily pauses in such  a form for several minutes, presumably to satisfy itself that no enemy  is in the open area whither the rabbit is bound.    The breeding season is from January to June, at least in California.  There are 2 to 5 young, averaging 3.5 per litter. They are born in a  nest.
