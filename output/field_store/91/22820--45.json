The aeronaut and Tom looked from the windows of the car, to note if any  further damage had been done. They were just congratulating themselves  that the rudder marked the extent, when, from a scuttle in the roof  there came a procession of young ladies, led by an elderly matron,  wearing spectacles and having a very determined, bristling air.    \"Well, I must say, this is a very unceremonious proceeding!\" exclaimed  the spectacled woman. \"Pray, gentlemen, to what are we indebted for  this honor?\"    \"It was an accident, ma'am,\" replied Mr. Sharp, removing his hat, and  bowing. \"A mere accident!\"    \"Humph! I suppose it was an accident that the tower of this building  was damaged, if not absolutely loosened at the foundations. You will  have to pay the damages!\" Then turning, and seeing about two score of  young ladies behind her on the flat roof, each young lady eying with  astonishment, not unmixed with admiration, the airship, the elderly one  added: \"Pupils! To your rooms at once! How dare you leave without  permission?\"    \"Oh, Miss Perkman!\" exclaimed a voice, at the sound of which Tom  started. \"Mayn't we see the airship? It will be useful in our natural  philosophy study!\"    Tom looked at the young lady who had spoken. \"Mary Nestor!\" he  exclaimed.    \"Tom--I mean Mr. Swift!\" she rejoined. \"How in the world did you get  here?\"    \"I was going to ask you the same question,\" retorted the lad. \"We flew  here.\"    \"Young ladies! Silence!\" cried Miss Perkman, who was evidently the  principal of the school. \"The idea of any one of you daring to speak to  these--these persons--without my permission, and without an  introduction! I shall make them pay heavily for damaging my seminary,\"  she added, as she strode toward Mr. Sharp, who, by this time, was out  of the car. \"To your rooms at once!\" Miss Perkman ordered again, but  not a young lady moved. The airship was too much of an attraction for  them.          Chapter 6    Getting Off The Roof      For a few minutes Mr. Sharp was so engrossed with looking underneath  the craft, to ascertain in what condition the various planes and braces  were, that he paid little attention to the old maid school principal,  after his first greeting. But Miss Perkman was not a person to be  ignored.    \"I want pay for the damage to the tower of my school,\" she went on. \"I  could also demand damages for trespassing on my roof, but I will  refrain in this case. Young ladies, will you go to your rooms?\" she  demanded.    \"Oh, please, let us stay,\" pleaded Mary Nestor, beside whom Tom now  stood. \"Perhaps Professor Swift will lecture on clouds and air currents  and--and such things as that,\" the girl went on slyly, smiling at the  somewhat embarrassed lad.    \"Ahem! If there is a professor present, perhaps it might be a good idea  to absorb some knowledge,\" admitted the old maid, and, unconsciously,  she smoothed her hair, and settled her gold spectacles straighter on  her nose. \"Professor, I will delay collecting damages on behalf of the  Rocksmond Young Ladies Seminary, while you deliver a lecture on air  currents,\" she went on, addressing herself to Mr. Sharp.    \"Oh, I'm not a professor,\" he said quickly. \"I'm a professional  balloonist, parachute jumper. Give exhibitions at county fairs. Leap  for life, and all that sort of thing. I guess you mean my friend. He's  smart enough for a professor. Invented a lot of things. How much is the  damage?\"    \"No professor?\" cried Miss Perkman indignantly. \"Why I understood from  Miss Nestor that she called some one professor.\"    \"I was referring to my friend, Mr. Swift,\" said Mary. \"His father's a  professor, anyhow, isn't he, Tom? I mean Mr. Swift!\"    \"I believe he has a degree, but he never uses it,\" was the lad's answer.    \"Ha!  Then I have been deceived!  There is no professor present!\" and  the old maid drew herself up as though desirous of punishing some one.  \"Young ladies, for the last time, I order you to your rooms,\" and, with  a dramatic gesture she pointed to the scuttle through which the  procession had come.    \"Say something, Tom--I mean Mr. Swift,\" appealed Mary Nestor, in a  whisper, to our hero. \"Can't you give some sort of a lecture? The girls  are just crazy to hear about the airship, and this ogress won't let us.  Say something!\"    \"I--I don't know what to say,\" stammered Tom.    But he was saved the necessity for just then several women, evidently  other teachers, came out on the roof.    \"Oh, an airship!\" exclaimed one. \"How lovely! We thought it was an  earthquake, and we were afraid to come up for quite a while. But an  airship! I've always wanted to see one, and now I have an opportunity.  It will be just the thing for my physical geography and natural history  class. Young ladies, attention, and I will explain certain things to  you.\"    \"Miss Delafield, do you understand enough about an airship to lecture  on one?\" asked Miss Perkman smartly.    \"Enough so that my class may benefit,\" answered the other teacher, who  was quite pretty.    \"Ahem! That is sufficient, and a different matter,\" conceded Miss  Perkman. \"Young ladies, give your undivided attention to Miss  Delafield, and I trust you will profit by what she tells you.  Meanwhile I wish to have some conversation concerning damages with the  persons who so unceremoniously visited us. It is a shame that the  pupils of the Rocksmond Seminary should be disturbed at their studies.  Sir, I wish to talk with you,\" and the principal pointed a long,  straight finger at Mr. Sharp.    \"Young ladies, attention!\" called Miss Delafield. \"You will observe the  large red body at the top, that is--\"    \"I'd rather have you explain it,\" whispered Mary Nestor to Tom. \"Come  on, slip around to the other side. May I bring a few of my friends with  me? I can't bear Miss Delafield. She thinks she knows everything.  She  won't see us if we slip around.\"    \"I shall be delighted,\" replied Tom, \"only I fear I may have to help  Mr. Sharp out of this trouble.\"    \"Don't worry about me, Tom,\" said the balloonist, who overheard him.  \"Let me do the explaining. I'm an old hand at it. Been in trouble  before. Many a time I've had to pay damages for coming down in a  farmer's corn field. I'll attend to the lady principal, and you can  explain things to the young ones,\" and, with a wink, the jolly aeronaut  stepped over to where Miss Perkman, in spite of her prejudice against  the airship, was observing it curiously.    Glad to have the chance to talk to his young lady friend, Tom slipped  to the opposite side of the car with her and a few of her intimate  friends, to whom she slyly beckoned. There Tom told how the Red Cloud  came to be built, and of his first trip in the air, while, on the  opposite side, Miss Delafield lectured to the entire school on  aeronautics, as she thought she knew them.    Mr. Sharp evidently did know how to \"explain\" matters to the irate  principal, for, in a short while, she was smiling. By this time Tom had  about finished his little lecture, and Miss Delafield was at the end of  hers. The entire school of girls was grouped about the Red Cloud,  curiously examining it, but Mary Nestor and her friends probably  learned more than any of the others. Tom was informed that his friend  had been attending the school in Rocksmond since the fall term opened.    \"I little thought, when I found we were going to smash into that tower,  that you were below there, studying,\" said the lad to the girl.    \"I'm afraid I wasn't doing much studying,\" she confessed. \"I had just a  glimpse of the airship through the window, and I was wondering who was  in it, when the crash came. Miss Perkman, who is nothing if not brave,  at once started for the roof, and we girls all followed her.  However,  are you going to get the ship down?\"    \"I'm afraid it is going to be quite a job,\" admitted Tom ruefully.  \"Something went wrong with the machinery, or this never would have  happened. As soon as Mr. Sharp has settled with your principal we'll  see what we can do.\"    \"I guess he's settled now,\" observed Miss Nestor. \"Here he comes.\"    The aeronaut and Miss Perkman were approaching together, and the old  maid did not seem half so angry as she had been.    \"You see,\" Mr. Sharp was saying, \"it will be a good advertisement for  your school. Think of having the distinction of having harbored the  powerful airship, Red Cloud, on your roof.\"    \"I never thought of it in that light,\" admitted the principal.  \"Perhaps you are right. I shall put it in my next catalog.\"    \"And, as for damages to the tower, we will pay you fifty dollars,\"  continued the balloonist. \"Do you agree to that, Mr. Swift?\" he asked  Tom. \"I think your father, the professor, would call that fair.\"    \"Oh, as long as this airship is partly the property of a professor,  perhaps I should only take thirty-five dollars,\" put in Miss Perkman.  \"I am a great admirer of professors--I mean in a strictly educational  sense,\" she went on, as she detected a tendency on the part of some of  the young ladies to giggle.    \"No, fifty dollars will be about right,\" went on Mr. Sharp, pulling out  a well-filled wallet. \"I will pay you now.\"    \"And if you will wait I will give you a receipt,\" continued the  principal, evidently as much appeased at the mention of a professor's  title, as she was by the money.    \"We're getting off cheap,\" the balloonist whispered to Tom, as the head  of the seminary started down the scuttle to the class-rooms below.    \"Maybe it's easier getting out of that difficulty than it will be to  get off the roof,\" replied the lad.    \"Don't worry. Leave that to me,\" the aeronaut said. It took  considerable to ruffle Mr. Sharp.    With a receipt in full for the damage to the tower, and expressing the  hope that, some day, in the near future, Professor Swift would do the  seminary the honor of lecturing to the young lady pupils, Miss Perkman  bade Mr. Sharp and Tom good-by.    \"Young ladies, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30066"],[0,"Laboratory Manual of Glass-Blowing (#7)"],[1,"bulbs may be made on tubing of a diameter of 3/16 inch  or a little less, but the beginner is advised to start with tubing of  about 1/4 inch diameter. The use of tubing with too thick walls usually  produces bulbs which are thick-walled at the point where they leave the  tube, but inclined to be too thin at the point of maximum diameter  (perpendicular to the axis of the tube) where most of the strain comes  and strength is particularly needed.          CHAPTER IV    ADVANCED EXERCISES      EXERCISE NO. 8    SEALING A TUBE THROUGH ANOTHER TUBE    _First Method--Making a Gas-washing Tube_    This first method can be used whenever one can work through an open end  opposite to the end of the tube where the joint is to be made. To  illustrate it, take a piece of rather thin-walled tubing, about 3/4 inch  in diameter, and some pieces of rather strong tubing a little less than  1/4 inch in diameter. Draw off the large tube in a short cone, then draw  off the tail as in the making of the bulb on the end of the tube, blow  out the little lump slightly, shrink the whole cone a little and blow  gently to form a rounded end like that on a test-tube, with walls about  the thickness of those of the rest of the tube. Cut this tube to a  suitable length, say about six inches, and provide two corks which will  fit the open end of it. Now cut a piece of the small tubing of the  proper length to form the piece which is to be inside the large tube.  For practice purposes, this piece should be about an inch shorter than  the large tube. Flange one end of this tube a little, and anneal the  flange well in the smoky flame. Bore one of the corks so that a piece of  the small tubing will fit it, and cut a couple of notches in the side of  this cork so that air can pass between it and the glass. Pass a short  piece of the small tubing through this cork, and attach the flanged  piece of small tube to this by means of a short piece of rubber tubing,  so that when the whole is inserted in the large tube it is arranged as  in _a_, Fig. 11. The piece of glass tubing projecting out through the  cork is now cut off so as to leave an end about 1/2 inch long when the  cork is firmly seated and the inner tube pushed into contact with the  center of the end of the large tube, as shown in the drawing. Care  should be taken that the little rubber tube which joins the two pieces  is arranged as in the figure; _i.e._, most of it on the piece of tubing  which passes through the cork, and very little on the other piece, so  that when the cork is removed after the small tube has been sealed  through the large one, the rubber tube may easily come with it. Select a  short piece of the small tubing of suitable length for the piece which  is to be on the outside of the large tube as a continuation of the  piece inside, and another piece for the delivery tube. A small bulb may  be blown in the latter at a point about 2-1/2 inches from the closed  end, and the open end cut off about 1-1/2 inches from the bulb. A cork  or cork-boring of suitable size to stopper the small tube is prepared,  and laid ready with the other (unbored) cork for the large tube.    [Illustration: FIG. 11.--Gas-washing tube.]    When everything is in readiness, the rounded end of the large tube is  slowly heated until it softens and joins firmly to the small tube  inside. After it has shrunk down well, it is blown out to its original  size, placing the whole end of the large tube, cork and all, in the  mouth. Now with a fine-pointed flame the glass covering the end of the  small tube is heated to the softening temperature, and then is blown out  to an excrescence by blowing on the end of the small tube which passes  through the cork. The end of this excrescence is heated and blown off in  the usual way, so as to leave the small tube sealed on the inside of the  large one and opening through it into this short tube which has been  blown out. The end of the small tube which passes through the cork is  now closed with the cork prepared for it, and the short outer tube is  joined to the tube that has just been blown out, so that the joint  appears like _b_, Fig. 11. Use the first method (Exercise No. 1) for  this joint. Reheat the whole of the end of the tube nearly to the  softening temperature, anneal it a little, and allow to cool a few  seconds until well set. Now remove the cork, short glass tube and rubber  tube from the open end of the large tube and insert the solid cork in  their place. Warm the joint and the whole of that end of the tube again  carefully up to about the softening point, then seal on the side tube  for the delivery of the gas in the usual way, taking care that the whole  of the end and the joint are kept warm meanwhile. When thoroughly  sealed, the delivery tube is bent up parallel to the tube through which  the gas enters, and then out at right angles to it, as shown in _c_. The  whole of the end of the tube is now cautiously reheated and then cooled  slowly to anneal it.    The cork may now be removed from the open end of the large tube, this  end heated in a large flame, caught together with a scrap of glass  tubing and drawn off into a cone so that the base of the cone is about  opposite the end of the inner tube. The lump of glass is drawn off the  point of this cone and it is reblown to form a rounded end, as  previously described.    After this cools, the tube through which the gas enters may be heated at  the proper point and bent at right angles to form the finished apparatus  as shown in _d_. The ends of the small tube are cut off square and  fire-polished.    =Discussion.=--After the joint has once been made, great care must be  taken that it is kept hot during all the subsequent manipulations, and  if it becomes somewhat cool at any time it must be reheated very slowly.  It is obvious that the rate of heating and cooling of the inner tube  will be slower than that of the outer tube, and this will readily  produce stresses which tend to crack the tube at the joint. The amount  of heating and cooling which such a joint will stand depends upon its  form. The beginner should examine such a joint on regular factory-made  apparatus, and note the uniformity of wall-thickness and the \"clean-cut\"  appearance of the joint, as a model for his imitation. A ragged joint,  where the line of joining of the inner and outer tubes wavers instead of  going squarely around the tube, is almost sure to crack during the  cooling and heating unless extra precautions are taken with it. The  presence of a small lump of glass at any point on the joint affords an  excellent starting place for a crack, as do also the points on a ragged  joint where the inner tube comes farther down on the outer tube than at  other points.    In order to insure a joint which is square and not ragged, it is  essential that the angle between the inner and outer tubes at the joint  be very nearly a right angle. For this reason the two tubes should not  be of too near the same size, or if this cannot be avoided, a small bulb  should be blown on the end where the joint is to be made. If this bulb  be made with the same wall-thickness as the rest of the tube, and  somewhat pear-shaped, it may be drawn out to the same size as the rest  of the tube, if necessary, after the joint has been made.    This method is used wherever possible in preference to the second method  (Exercise No. 9), as it is easier to get a good joint with it. It may  also be used where it is desired to seal the tube through the side of a  tube, or for a tube sealed through the wall of a bulb, as in a Geissler  potash bulb or similar apparatus. Where there is not space to join the  inner tube to the blowing tube by a rubber tube, this joint may be made  with a small piece of gummed paper, which can readily be broken when  desired.      EXERCISE NO. 9    SEALING A TUBE THROUGH ANOTHER TUBE    _Second Method--Making a Suction Pump_    Select a piece of tubing 3/8 to 1/2 inch in diameter, with walls about  1/16 inch or a little less in thickness, heat a place about 4 inches  from one end and draw it out so that when cut off at the proper point it  will look like _a_, Fig. 12; the open end of the drawn out part being  small enough to slip inside another piece of the original tube. A small  thick-walled bulb is now blown as indicated by the dotted lines, and  annealed. A piece of the original tubing is now prepared, 7 or 8 inches  long, with one end cut square off and the other closed. A piece of  1/4-in tubing about 2 inches long, and drawn out at one end to a tail  several inches long is also prepared, to form the inlet tube for the  air. Another piece of the 3/8-inch tube is prepared, about 4 inches  long, and provided with a tail drawn out as indicated in _b_, so that  when cut off at about 2-1/2 or 3 inches from the main tube its inner  diameter may be slightly less than that of the narrowest point of the  tube _a_. A small thick-walled bulb is blown at the point indicated by  the dotted lines, and annealed. Care must be taken in drawing the  capillary and blowing the bulb in both _a_ and _b_ that the capillary  tubes are in the axis of the main tube, and in the same straight line  with it.    [Illustration: FIG. 12.--Suction pump.]    The open end of the 8-inch piece of tube and the bulb of the piece _a_  are now warmed together, the end of the tube only moderately and the  bulb to about its softening temperature. The tube _a_ is now inserted in  the open end of the large tube, and the bulb softened with a suitable  flame and pressed into good contact with the tube. It is then reheated,  including the joint, blown a little and pulled out to form a straight  tube in line with the main tube. By warming the joint a little, and  proper rotation, the capillary may be brought into the same straight  line with the rest of the tube.    Keeping this joint hot, a place about an inch from it on the tube _a_ is  warmed, and the piece of 1/4-"]]]
