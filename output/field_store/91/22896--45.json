Watch them as they hover  about among your flowers. Some, you will observe, are intent on nothing  but idle frolicking; and you may conclude at once that _these_ have no  immediate duty to perform. Others are flying without hesitation from  flower to flower, gorging themselves with the sweets of life: these are  not the objects of your search. But you will descry certain others,  flying round about the beds and borders with a steadier and more  matronly air, taking little or no notice of their more frivolous  companions, and paying not the slightest heed to the bright  nectar-producing cups of the numerous flowers. These are seriously  engaged with family affairs only. Watch one of them carefully, and as  soon as she has settled herself on a leaf, walk steadily towards her  till you are near enough to observe her movements. She will not move  unless you approach too closely, for, like busy folk generally, she has  no time to worry about petty annoyances. You will now actually witness  the deposition of the eggs exactly as carried on in the perfect freedom  of nature; and the eggs themselves may be taken either for examination  or for the rearing of the caterpillars.    Some species of _Lepidoptera_ lay some hundreds of eggs, and it is  seldom that the number laid by one female is much below a hundred.    As already stated, the under surfaces of leaves are generally chosen for  the deposit of eggs, but a few of the insects we are considering always  select the upper surface for this purpose. Thus the Puss Moth (page  235), and two or three others resembling it, though much smaller, known  as the Kittens (page 234), invariably lay them on the upper surface. And  this is the more surprising since the eggs of these moths are brown or  black, and consequently so conspicuous on the green leaves as to be in  danger of being sighted by the numerous enemies of insects.    The Hairstreak Butterflies (page 183) afford another exception to the  general rule, for their eggs are deposited on the _bark_ of the trees  and shrubs (birch, sloe, elm, oak, and bramble) on which their larvae  feed.    At the moment each egg is laid it is covered with a liquid sticky  substance, so that it is immediately glued to the leaf or stem as soon  as it is deposited. The sticky substance soon dries, causing the egg to  be so firmly fastened in its place that it is often impossible to force  it off without destroying it completely.    Some of the _Lepidoptera_ deposit their eggs singly, or in small  irregular clusters; but by far the larger number set them very regularly  side by side, in so compact a mass that it would be impossible to place  them on a smaller area without piling one on top of another. This is not  accomplished with the aid of the sight, for the insect performing her  task with such precision often has her head on one side of a leaf or  stem while arranging her eggs on the other. If you take the trouble to  watch her, you will see that she carefully _feels_ out a place for each  egg by means of the tip of her abdomen immediately before laying it.    The eggs are laid by moths and butterflies at various seasons of the  year. In some cases they are deposited early in the spring, even before  the buds of the food plants have burst; and the young larvae, hatched a  few weeks later, commence to feed on the young and tender leaves. Then,  throughout the late spring, the whole of the summer and autumn, and even  till the winter frosts set in, the eggs of various species are being  laid.    Those deposited during the warm weather are often hatched in a few days,  but those laid toward the autumn remain unchanged until the following  spring.    In this latter case the frosts of the most severe winter are not capable  of destroying the vitality of the eggs. In many instances the perfect  insect or the larva would be killed by the temperature of an average  winter day, but the vitality of the eggs is such that they have been  subjected to a temperature, artificially produced, of fifty degrees  below the freezing point, and even after this the young larvae walked out  of their cradles at their appointed time just as if nothing unusual had  occurred.    Experiments have also been performed on the eggs with a view of  determining how far their vitality is influenced by high temperatures.  We know that the scorching midsummer sun has no destructive influence on  them, but these experiments prove that they are not influenced by a  temperature only twenty degrees below the boiling point--actually a  considerably higher temperature than is _necessary_ to properly cook a  hen's egg.    Let us now examine a number of eggs of different species, that we may  note some of the many variations in form and colour.    With regard to colour, we have already observed that the eggs of a few  species are black; but more commonly they are much lighter--pearly  white, green, yellow, and grey being of frequent occurrence.    The great variety of form, however, will provide a vast amount of  enjoyment to anyone who possesses a good magnifying lens or a small  compound microscope. Some are globular, others oval; while many others  represent cups, basins, and domes. Then we have miniature vases, flasks,  bottles with short necks, and numerous figures that must remind a  juvenile admirer of the sweet cakes and ornamental jellies that have so  often gladdened his longing eyes.    Again, the beautifully sculptured surfaces of a large number are even  more striking than their general shapes. Some are regularly ribbed from  top to bottom with parallel or radiating ridges, and at the same time  marked with delicate transverse lines. Others are beautifully pitted or  honeycombed, some ornamented with the most faithful representation of  fine wicker-work, while a few are provided with a cap, more or less  ornamental, that is raised by the young larva when about to see the  world for the first time. A few of these beautiful forms are here  illustrated and named, and another has already appeared on page 14, but  an enthusiastic young naturalist may easily secure a variety of others  for his own examination.    [Illustration: FIG. 11.--EGG OF THE MEADOW BROWN BUTTERFLY.]    [Illustration: FIG. 12.--EGG OF THE SPECKLED WOOD BUTTERFLY.]    [Illustration: FIG. 13.--EGG OF THE VAPOURER MOTH.]    It may be surmised from the accompanying illustrations that the form of  the egg is always the same for any one species. This is really the case,  and consequently an experienced entomologist can often decide on the  name of the butterfly or moth that deposited a cluster of eggs he  happens to find in his rambles and searchings; but in such decisions he  is always greatly assisted by a knowledge of the food plants of the  various insects, and sometimes also by the manner in which the eggs are  arranged.    We have seen that the period during which the _Lepidoptera_ remain in  the egg stage is very variable, and depends largely on the season in  which they were laid; but it is often possible to tell when to expect  the young larvae by certain changes which take place in the appearance of  the egg. As the horny covering of the egg is transparent, the gradual  development of the caterpillar from the clear fluid can be watched to a  certain extent; but if you have a microscope, and would like to witness  this development to perfection, proceed as follows.    Arrange that some butterflies and moths shall lay their eggs on strips  of glass of convenient dimensions for microscopic work--three inches  long by one wide is the usual size for this kind of work. This is easily  accomplished by placing a proper selection of female insects in a rather  small box temporarily lined with such 'slips.' When a few eggs have thus  been secured, all you have to do is to examine them at intervals with  your microscope, always using the reflector so as to direct a strong  light _through_ the eggs from below.    But even without such an arrangement some interesting changes are to be  observed. As a rule, the colour of the egg turns darker as the time for  the arrival of the infant larva approaches, and you will often be able  to see a little brown or black head moving slightly within the 'shell.'  You may know then that the hatching is close at hand, and the movements  of the tiny creature are well worth careful watching. Soon a small hole  appears in the side of the case, and a little green or dark cap begins  to show itself. Then, with a magnifier of some kind, you may see a pair  of tiny jaws, working horizontally, and not with an up-and-down motion  like our own, gradually gnawing away at the cradle, till at last the  little creature is perfectly free to ramble in search of food.    Strange to say, the young larva does not waste a particle of the horny  substance that must necessarily be removed in securing its liberty, but  devours it with an apparent relish. Indeed, it appreciates the flavour  of this viand so highly that it often disposes of the whole of its  little home, with the exception of the small circular patch by which it  was cemented to the plant. When the whole brood have thus dispensed with  their empty cradles, there remains on the stem or leaf a glittering  patch of little pearly plates.    After the performance of this feat the young caterpillar starts off in  life on its own account with as much briskness and confidence as if it  had previously spent a term in the world under the same conditions; but  we must reserve an account of its doings and sufferings for our next  chapter.          CHAPTER III    _THE LARVA_      In almost every case the young caterpillar, on quitting the 'shell' of  the egg, finds itself standing on and surrounded by its natural food,  and immediately commences to do justice to the abundant supply. It will  either nibble away at the surface of the leaf, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34175"],[0,"Domestic Animals (#7)"],[1,"says, \"In drawing up this table, I have  adopted the proportions of gluten, for the most part, from Boussingault.  Some of them, however, appear to be very doubtful. The proportions of  fatty matter are also very uncertain. With a few exceptions, those above  given have been taken from Sprengel, and they are, in general, stated  considerably too low. It is an interesting fact, that the proportion of  fatty matter in and immediately under the husk of the grains of corn, is  generally much greater than in the substance of the corn itself. Thus I  have found the pollard of wheat to yield more than twice as much oil as  the fine flour obtained from the same sample of grain. The four  portions separated by the miller from a superior sample of wheat grown  in the neighborhood of Durham, gave of oil respectively: fine flour, 1.5  per cent.; pollard, 2.4; boxings, 3.6; and bran, 3.3 per cent. Dumas  states that the husk of oats sometimes yields as much as five or six per  cent. of oil.\" The columns under starch, &c., and fatty matter, denote  the value for respiration or sustaining life, and the fattening  qualities; that under gluten, the capacity for yielding muscle and  supporting labor; and saline matter indicates something of the  proportions which are capable of being converted into bones.

An absolute,  unchanging value can never be assumed of any one substance, as the  quality of each must differ with the particular variety, the soil upon  which it is grown, the character of the season, the manner of curing,  and other circumstances. An approximate relative value is all that can  be expected, and this we may hope ere long to obtain, from the spirit of  analytical research, which is now developed and in successful progress.  More especially do we need these investigations with _American  products_, some of which are but partially cultivated in Europe, whence  we derive most of our analyses. And many which are there reared, differ  widely from those produced here, as these also differ from each other.  What, for instance, is the character of _meadow hay_? We know that this  varies as four to one, according to the particular kinds grown; and our  Indian corn has certainly a less range than from five to nine.      The Changes in the Food of Animals.    Potatoes, when first ripe, are estimated to be worth, for feeding  purposes, nearly twice as much as when old; and the relative value of  the different kinds, varies greatly at the same age and under similar  conditions of growth. Perrault ascertained by careful experiment, that  hay, clover, and lucerne lost much of their nutritive qualities by  drying, and in lucerne this loss amounted to about thirty-five per cent.  This is an important consideration in the feeding of green and dry  forage. Oats are among the best feed, both for young and working  animals; but it has been found that they are greatly improved for the  latter, and perhaps for both, by allowing the new crop to remain till  the latter part of winter, before feeding.    The improvement by steaming and cooking food, is seldom sufficiently  appreciated. Food properly managed, can never be made worse by cooking  for any stock; although it has not been considered so essential for  working, and generally, for ruminating animals, as for swine, and such  as were stall-feeding. But the alteration produced in cooking, by  fitting it for a more ready assimilation, must, as a general rule, add  much to the value of the food, and the rapid improvement of the animal.    The effect of slight fermentation, or souring the food, produces the  same result. Animals accustomed to this acid food, will reject what is  unprepared when they can get at the former; and we have no doubt, from  our own experience, that there is a saving in thus preparing it, from 20  to 40 per cent. A mixture of food should be supplied to all animals.  Like man, they tire of any constant aliment. For such, especially, as  are fattening, and which it is desirable to mature with the greatest  rapidity, a careful indulgence of their appetite should be studied. They  should be provided with whatever they most crave, if it be adapted to  the secretion of fat. Cutting, crushing, and grinding the food; cooking,  souring, and mixing it, are each by themselves an improvement for  feeding; and frequently two or more of these preparations combined, are  of great utility in effecting the object proposed.      The Profit of Feeding.    It is evident, that this consists in a valuable return from the animal  of the food consumed. In the horse, this can only be received in labor  or breeding; in the ox, from labor and flesh; in the cow, from the milk,  the flesh, and her young. In the sheep, it may be returned in its  fleece, its carcass, or its progeny; and in the swine only by its  progeny and flesh. The manure we expect from all; and if this be not  secured and judiciously used, few animals about the farm will be found  to yield a satisfactory profit for their food and attention; though it  is evident, it should form but a small part of the return looked for.    Animals are only profitable to the farmer, when they yield a daily  income, as in their milk or labor; or annually, by their young or  fleece; unless it be in a course of regular improvement, either in their  ordinary growth or preparation for the butcher. The animal must consume  a certain amount of food merely to keep up its stationary condition, and  to supply the materials for waste, respiration, perspiration, and the  evacuations. These must first be provided for in all cases, before the  farmer can expect any thing for the food.    Frequent observation has shown, that an ox will consume about two per  cent, of his weight of hay per day, to maintain his condition. If put to  moderate labor, an increase of this quantity to three per cent., will  enable him to perform his work, and still maintain his flesh. If to be  fattened, he requires about 41/2 per cent. of his weight daily, in  nutritious food. A cow to remain stationary and give no milk, eats two  per cent. of her weight daily; and if in milk, she will consume three  per cent. If these statements are correct, which it is certain they are  in principle, though they may not be entirely in degree, it will require  the same food to keep three yoke of cattle in idleness, as two at work;  and the food of every two that are idle, will nearly support one under  the most rapid condition of fatting. Two cows may be kept in milk, with  the same feed that will keep three without.    No practice is more impolitic, than barely to sustain the stock through  the winter, or a part of the year, as is the case in too many instances,  and allow them to improve only when turned on grass in summer. Besides  subjecting them to the risk of disease, consequent upon their privation  of food, nearly half the year is lost in their use, or in maturing them  for profitable disposal; when if one-third of the stock had been sold,  the remainder would have been kept in a rapidly improving condition, and  at three years of age, they would probably be of equal value, as  otherwise at five or six. It is true that breed has much to do with this  rapid advancement, but breed is useless without food to develop and  mature it.          CHAPTER II.    NEAT OR HORNED CATTLE.      The value of our neat cattle exceeds that of any other of the domestic  animals in the United States. They are as widely disseminated, and more  generally useful. Like sheep and all our domestic brutes, they have been  so long and so entirely subject to the control of man, that their  original type is unknown. They have been allowed entire freedom from all  human direction or restraint for hundreds of years, on the boundless  pampas of South America, California, and elsewhere; but when permitted  to resume that natural condition, by which both plants and animals  approximate to the character of their original head, they have scarcely  deviated in any respect, from the domestic herds from which they are  descended. From this it may be inferred, that our present races do not  differ, in any of their essential features and characteristics, from the  original stock.      Various Domestic Breeds.
