Now when you shoot the game, pick it up and wait until your dog  comes, then show it to him, but never let him eat one, for if you  only cripple one he will catch and eat it. Teach him in the start to  hold game until you come to him. Now to get him to start to hunt  another rabbit may be your trouble. He may want to stay with you and  try to steal your rabbit. The best way to start him out is to start  walking through the brush and stamping on brush piles, at the same  time telling him to \"hunt 'em up.\" Keep a piece away from him and he  will soon start to hunt again. Now if he runs one into a den, what  should you do? Dig 'im out and be a \"Johnny-dig-'em-out\" or let him  go.    Better examine the first den, and if not over 2 or 3 feet deep and  only a small hole, you may dig it out, if it is one of your dog's  first hunts, but don't dig very big dens, for by the time you dig one  out, you may get a shot at another. The way to get your pup away from  a den is to look the situation over and then give up, telling him to  give it up; we can't get it; he will soon come away.    There are other things to be careful of; first you should never hurry  your dog; walk slow and when he gets used to hunting let him scare up  the most of the game or he will get lazy and want you to be the dog.  Never whip your dog for a mistake, or you may spoil him. Then when  you come home you may give him the rabbit heads. Let him in the  house, and when you eat your rabbit, give him all the bones. This  will teach him why and for what you take your game home. One great  thing is, if your dog scares up game and is following on the trail,  don't change your standing place too often; judge the point where the  game will come around and stay there until it does come.    Some fellows will run, jump and halloo after his dog while running a  rabbit; there is where you spoil him, for you must be cool in mind.  Then when your dog is running a rabbit and night is coming on, don't  go home until your dog comes to you, or right there is where your dog  will be discouraged. So when the day's hunt is over you can go home  with your dog by your side.    While you are showing him what good he did for you, if he is wet and  cold call him near the stove and dry him. For if a dog must lay  outside all wet, he will soon become stiff in his limbs, and  rheumatism will be seen at an early age. Always after the day's hunt,  give him all he wants to eat. Don't have him too fat in hunting  season, because he will tire out too easily.      [Illustration: The Fair Sex are More and More Becoming  Practical Nimrods.]        CHAPTER VIII.    TRAINING THE DEER HOUND.    On all things there is a main point, also certain rules which should  never be forgotten in training hounds, especially the age and the way  to train them. My experience has taught me that it is a big mistake  to allow a young deer hound to go in the woods before he is 12 to 15  months old, says a Canadian hunter.    At a year old a hound should know how to lead well, that is not to  pull on the chain for all he is worth ahead of his master but to  follow behind him through every place he passes, if between, under or  over logs as well as fences, to follow exactly the same trail as his  master. A dog or a pair coupled together, so trained, can be easily  led in any bush without any bother whatever. It is not at all  necessary that a dog should lead in front of his master to find a  trail. A dog with a keen nose can pick a trail from the air several  yards before reaching it. He will then pull you in the direction of  the same and if the scent is fresh, he will be anxious to follow it,  then if the hunter is a man who understands his business, he will  examine the track by following  it 100 yards or so and if suitable  and going (if it is a deer) in the right direction and if the wind is  also right, will then allow his hound to go.    A dog which knows his business will not open the minute he gets the  scent but will cover the ground fast and save his steam until he has  jumped the deer or fox, then open his value and if he is a flyer he  will water more deer in five hours than another which gives tongue as  soon as he takes the scent in five days for the reason that a dog  which opens the very instant he finds a trail will have to cover 20  times more ground to bring his deer to water, than the one which does  not.      [Illustration: The Deer Seeks Refuge in Deep Water.]    A hound should not be gun or water shy but should be shy of  strangers, traps and of poisoned baits. He should know how to swim  across a river or lake and where to land. He should have but one  master and obey him to the word and this without the use of the whip.  He should know how to ride in a canoe. All this can be taught to him  in about 3 months and he should know all these things before he is  broken to hunt.    The next thing is to accustom your dog to the gun. This is easily  done. All you have to do is to take your gun and dog into a field and  once there to tie your dog say five or six feet from you, then to  shoot the gun and after every shot to speak kindly to your dog and  make him smell the gun. In a day or so repeat as before and the  moment you see that your dog is not afraid let him loose and shoot  again and always pet him. He will then know what a gun is. So when  your young hound knows the gun, the canoe and water, he may be taught  to be shy of strangers, traps and of poisoned baits.    To break a dog to hunt, you must not allow him to go in the bush  whenever he likes. A dog that hunts without being in the company of  his master will never be a well trained dog. Therefore, you must lead  him in the bush and if you have a well trained dog, you may couple  him with the young one and walk until you find a good trail then  follow it with the dogs till you see that the young one has caught  scent right, then let go the young hound first and the \"old timer\"  last. If the hound comes from hunting stock, he will hang to the  trail with the other dog and he will only turn up with him but for  some reason or another, should the young hound come back to you,  \"don't get mad and kick or beat him.\" No, this is a great error and  many are the dogs which have been spoiled that way. Instead of  beating, speak kindly to him and pet him a few seconds and keep  moving towards where the chase is going.    Don't excite your dog, pay no attention to him. If he wants to follow  you at your heels, let him do so and once you reach a place where  likely the other dog is going to pass, stay there and when the old  dog comes along, the young one will again join and may stay this time  with him, as the scent will be hot and the chances are ten to one  that the young hound will take a hand in the music. But if after ten,  or twenty minutes, he should again return, treat him as before. Be  always kind to him. If you have no old dog to train your young one,  go with your dog and show him the game you want him to hunt, lead him  until you kill one, then blood him. The blooding is the \"A, B, C\" of  training. Allow him to smell the game all he likes, speak kindly to  him even if he bites the game, don't kick him off or use a stick on  him, as I have often seen done by some fellows who pretend that to  teach a hound you must abuse him. If you want a foolish dog, that is  the way to use him but if you desire an intelligent one, you must  encourage him.    After a dog has been well blooded (the blooding is done by rubbing  the hot blood of the game on the front legs, as well as on the sides  of the dog), you may turn him loose or you may lead him until you  find another trail. He will at once be anxious to follow. Let him  lead for a hundred yards and once you are sure that he has the scent  in the right direction, let him go and if that hound comes from  trained stock, he will run that scent immediately and should he only  be away for five, ten or more minutes and come back to you, speak  kindly to him and tell him to hunt. Always mention his name and keep  moving in the direction where you suppose the game is.    It is a good thing that a young dog backs his own tracks at first, as  it teaches him that he can find you when he likes and a hound that  does this after each chase will never get lost no matter where you  may go. In deer hunting, it has many advantages in so far, that when  you are several miles from camp, after your dog has a start you keep  moving and if you find where a deer has just passed, you can just sit  there and wait for the return of the dog and as soon as he returns,  you just tie him and allow him to rest for fifteen or twenty minutes  and then you start him again. I have often had two and sometimes four  chases in one forenoon and this without bother. Hounds thus trained,  will always return to camp every night for their feed and will be  ready for the next day.      [Illustration: Well Trained Hounds.]    Some hunters say that their dogs are so good that when they turn them  loose, they always stay away for three or four days and they even go  so far as to say, that they hunt night and day during the whole time  they are away. Well, this is not the case at all. The reason is that  they will chase a deer or fox for three or four hours or more and  when they have watered the deer or holed their fox, will then start  to ramble around and start after another and after watering their  second deer, they will be so far away that they are unable to find  their way back, and they will walk until they can go no more. They  will then lie down for a long time and walk around and howl until  they find somebody's trail, which they will follow to the end or  until they land at a settler's house or at some shanty and will  remain there.    Now how many dogs like these will a party of ten or twelve men  require to hunt, during ten or fifteen days in a strange country?
