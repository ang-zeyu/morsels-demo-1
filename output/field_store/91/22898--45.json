Commencing with the sixth, the rings decrease  in width and the abdomen ends in a cone, the extremity of which, formed  of the ninth segment, constitutes a weapon of a new kind. It is a sheaf  of eight brown spikes. The last two exceed the others in length and  stand out from the group in a double terminal plowshare.    There is a round air hole in front, on either side of the thorax, and  similar stigmata on the flanks of each of the first seven abdominal  segments. When at rest, the nymph is curved into a bow. When about to  act, it suddenly unbends and straightens itself. It measures 15 to 20  millimeters long and 4 to 5 millimeters across.    Such is the strange perforating machine that is to prepare an outlet  for the feeble Anthrax through the Mason bee's cement. The structural  details, so difficult to explain in words, may be summed up as follows:  in front, on the forehead, a diadem of spikes, the ramming and digging  tool; behind, a many bladed plowshare which fits into a socket and  allows the pupa to slacken suddenly in readiness for an attack on the  barrier which has to be demolished; on the back, four climbing belts, or  graters, which keep the animal in position by biting on the walls of the  tunnel with their hundreds of teeth; and, all over the body, long, stiff  bristles, pointing backwards, to prevent falls or recoils.    A similar structure exists in the other species of Anthrax with slight  variations of detail. I will confine myself to one instance, that of  Anthrax sinuata, who thrives at the cost of Osmia tricornis. Her nymph  differs from that of Anthrax trifasciata, the Anthrax of the mason bee,  in possessing less powerful armor. Its four climbing belts consist of  only fifteen to seventeen double spiked arches, instead of twenty-five;  also, the abdominal segments, from the sixth onwards, are supplied  merely with stiff bristles, without a trace of horny spikes. If the  evolution of the various Anthrax flies were better known to us,  the number of these arches would, I believe, be of great service  to entomology in the differentiation of species. I see it remaining  constant for any given species, with marked variations between one  species and another. But this is not my business: I merely call the  attention of the classifiers to this field of study and pass on.    About the end of May, the coloring of the nymph, hitherto a light red,  alters greatly and forecasts the coming transformation. The head, the  thorax and the scarf formed by the wings become a handsome, shiny black.  A dark band shows on the back of the four segments with their two rows  of spikes; three spots appear on the two next rings; the anal armor  becomes darker. In this manner we foresee the black livery of the coming  insect. The time has arrived for the pupa to work at the exit gallery.    I was anxious to see it in action, not under natural conditions, which  would be impracticable, but in a glass tube in which I confine it  between two thick stoppers of sorghum pith. The space thus marked off  is about the same size as the natal cell. The partitions front and back,  although not so stout as the Chalicodoma's masonry, are nevertheless  firm enough not to yield except to prolonged efforts; on the other hand,  the side walls are smooth and the toothed belts will not be able to grip  them: a most unfavorable condition for the worker. No matter: in the  space of a single day, the pupa pierces the front partition, three  quarters of an inch thick. I see it fixing its double plowshare against  the back partition, arching into a bow and then suddenly releasing  itself and striking the plug in front of it with its barbed forehead.  Under the impact of the spikes, the sorghum slowly crumbles to pieces.  It is slow in coming away; but it comes away all the same, atom by atom.  At long intervals, the method changes. With its crown of awls driven  into the pith, the animal frets and fidgets, sways on the pivot of its  anal armor. The work of the auger follows that of the pickaxe. Then the  blows recommence, interspersed with periods of rest to recover from the  fatigue. At last, the hole is made. The pupa slips into it, but does not  pass through entirely: the head and thorax appear outside; the abdomen  remains held in the gallery.    The glass cell, with its lack of supports at the side, has certainly  perplexed my subject, which does not seem to have made use of all its  methods. The hole through the sorghum is wide and irregular; it is  a clumsy breach and not a gallery. When made through the mason bee's  walls, it is cylindrical, fairly neat and exactly of the animal's  diameter. So I hope that, under natural conditions, the pupa does not  give quite so many blows with the pickaxe and prefers to work with the  drill.    Narrowness and evenness in the exit tunnel are necessary to it. It  always remains half caught in it and even pretty securely fixed by the  graters on its back. Only the head and thorax emerge into the outer air.  This is a last precaution for the final deliverance. A fixed support is,  in fact, indispensable to the Anthrax for issuing from her horny sheath,  unfurling her great wings and extricating her slender legs from their  scabbards. All this very delicate work would be endangered by any lack  of steadiness.    The pupa, therefore, remains fixed by the graters of its back in the  narrow exit gallery and thus supplies the stable equilibrium essential  to the new birth. All is ready. It is time now for the great act. A  transversal cleft makes its appearance on the forehead, at the bottom  of the perforating diadem; a second, but longitudinal slit divides the  skull in two and extends down the thorax. Through this cross-shaped  opening, the Anthrax suddenly appears, all moist with the humors of  life's laboratory. She steadies herself upon her trembling legs, dries  her wings and takes to flight, leaving at the window of the cell  her nymphal slough, which keeps intact for a very long period. The  sand-colored fly has five or six weeks before her, wherein to explore  the clay nests amid the thyme and to take her small share of the joys  of life. In July, we shall see her once more, busy this time with the  entrance into the cell, which is even stranger than the exit.          CHAPTER III. ANOTHER PROBER (PERFORATOR)    What can he be called, this creature whose style and title I dare not  inscribe at the head of the chapter? His name is Monodontomerus cupreus,  SM. Just try it, for fun: Mo-no-don-to-me-rus. What a gorgeous mouthful!  What an idea it gives one of some beast of the Apocalypse! We think,  when we pronounce the word, of the prehistoric monsters: the mastodon,  the mammoth, the ponderous megatherium. Well, we are misled by the  scientific label: we have to do with a very paltry insect, smaller than  the common gnat.    There are good people like that, only too happy to serve science with  resounding appellations that might come from Timbuktu; they cannot name  you a midge without striking terror into you. O ye wise and revered  ones, ye christeners of animals, I am willing, in my study, to  make use--but not undue use--of your harsh terminology, with its  conglomeration of syllables; but there is a danger of their leaving the  sanctum and appearing before the public, which is always ready to show  its lack of deference for terms that do not respect its ears. I, wishing  to speak like everybody else, so that I may be understood by all, and  persuaded that science has no need of this Brobdignagian jargon, make a  point of avoiding technical nomenclature when it becomes too barbarous,  when it threatens to lumber the page the moment my pen attempts it. And  so I abandon Monodontomerus.    It is a puny little insect, almost as tiny as the midges whom we see  eddying in a ray of sunshine at the end of autumn. Its dress is golden  bronze; its eyes are coral red. It carries a naked sword, that is to  say, the sheath of its drill stands out slantwise at the tip of its  belly, instead of lying in a hollow groove along the back, as it  does with the Leucospis. This scabbard holds the latter half of the  inoculating filament, which extends below the animal to the base of  the abdomen. In short, its utensil is that of the Leucospis, with this  difference, that its lower half sticks out like a rapier.    This mite that bears a sword upon her rump is yet another persecutor of  the mason bees and not one of the least formidable. She exploits their  nests at the same time as the Leucospis. I see her, like the Leucospis,  slowly explore the ground with her antennae; I see her, like the  Leucospis, bravely drive her dagger into the stone wall. More taken up  with her work, less conscious perhaps of danger, she pays no heed to the  man who is observing her so closely. Where the Leucospis flies, she does  not budge. So great is her assurance that she comes right into my study,  to my work table, and disputes my ownership of the nests whose occupants  I am examining. She operates under my lens, she operates just beside  my forceps. What risk does she run? What can one do to a thing so very  small? She is so certain of her safety that I can take the Mason's  nest in my hand, move it, put it down and take it up again without  the insect's raising any objection: it continues its work even when my  magnifying glass is placed over it.    One of these heroines has come to inspect a nest of the Chalicodoma of  the Walls, most of whose cells are occupied by the numerous cocoons of  a parasite, the Stelis. The contents of these cells, which have been  partially ripped up to satisfy my curiosity, are very much exposed to  view. The windfall appears to be appreciated, for I see the dwarf ferret  about from cell to cell for four days on end, see her choose her cocoon  and insert her awl in the most approved fashion.

Blunt, in his professional excitement, had already forgotten her  presence, and Frere was in earnest conversation with Vickers.    \"Take a boat?\" said that gentleman. \"Certainly, my dear Frere, by all  means. That is to say, if the captain does not object, and it is not  contrary to the Regulations.\"    \"Captain, you'll lower a boat, eh? We may save some of the poor  devils,\" cries Frere, his heartiness of body reviving at the prospect of  excitement.    \"Boat!\" said Blunt, \"why, she's twelve miles off and more, and there's  not a breath o' wind!\"    \"But we can't let 'em roast like chestnuts!\" cried the other, as the  glow in the sky broadened and became more intense.    \"What is the good of a boat?\" said Pine. \"The long-boat only holds  thirty men, and that's a big ship yonder.\"    \"Well, take two boats--three boats! By Heaven, you'll never let 'em burn  alive without stirring a finger to save 'em!\"    \"They've got their own boats,\" says Blunt, whose coolness was in strong  contrast to the young officer's impetuosity; \"and if the fire gains,  they'll take to 'em, you may depend. In the meantime, we'll show 'em  that there's someone near 'em.\" And as he spoke, a blue light flared  hissing into the night.    \"There, they'll see that, I expect!\" he said, as the ghastly flame rose,  extinguishing the stars for a moment, only to let them appear again  brighter in a darker heaven.    \"Mr. Best--lower and man the quarter-boats! Mr. Frere--you can go in  one, if you like, and take a volunteer or two from those grey jackets  of yours amidships. I shall want as many hands as I can spare to man the  long-boat and cutter, in case we want 'em. Steady there, lads! Easy!\"  and as the first eight men who could reach the deck parted to the  larboard and starboard quarter-boats, Frere ran down on the main-deck.    Mrs. Vickers, of course, was in the way, and gave a genteel scream as  Blunt rudely pushed past her with a scarce-muttered apology; but her  maid was standing erect and motionless, by the quarter-railing, and as  the captain paused for a moment to look round him, he saw her dark eyes  fixed on him admiringly. He was, as he said, over forty-two, burly  and grey-haired, but he blushed like a girl under her approving gaze.  Nevertheless, he said only, \"That wench is a trump!\" and swore a little.    Meanwhile Maurice Frere had passed the sentry and leapt down into the  'tween decks. At his nod, the prison door was thrown open. The air was  hot, and that strange, horrible odour peculiar to closely-packed human  bodies filled the place. It was like coming into a full stable.    He ran his eye down the double tier of bunks which lined the side of the  ship, and stopped at the one opposite him.    There seemed to have been some disturbance there lately, for instead of  the six pair of feet which should have protruded therefrom, the gleam of  the bull's-eye showed but four.    \"What's the matter here, sentry?\" he asked.    \"Prisoner ill, sir. Doctor sent him to hospital.\"    \"But there should be two.\"    The other came from behind the break of the berths. It was Rufus Dawes.  He held by the side as he came, and saluted.    \"I felt sick, sir, and was trying to get the scuttle open.\"    The heads were all raised along the silent line, and eyes and ears were  eager to see and listen. The double tier of bunks looked terribly like a  row of wild beast cages at that moment.    Maurice Frere stamped his foot indignantly.    \"Sick! What are you sick about, you malingering dog? I'll give you  something to sweat the sickness out of you. Stand on one side here!\"    Rufus Dawes, wondering, obeyed. He seemed heavy and dejected, and passed  his hand across his forehead, as though he would rub away a pain there.    \"Which of you fellows can handle an oar?\" Frere went on. \"There, curse  you, I don't want fifty! Three'll do. Come on now, make haste!\"    The heavy door clashed again, and in another instant the four  \"volunteers\" were on deck. The crimson glow was turning yellow now, and  spreading over the sky.    \"Two in each boat!\" cries Blunt. \"I'll burn a blue light every hour for  you, Mr. Best; and take care they don't swamp you. Lower away, lads!\" As  the second prisoner took the oar of Frere's boat, he uttered a groan and  fell forward, recovering himself instantly. Sarah Purfoy, leaning over  the side, saw the occurrence.    \"What is the matter with that man?\" she said. \"Is he ill?\"    Pine was next to her, and looked out instantly. \"It's that big fellow in  No. 10,\" he cried. \"Here, Frere!\"    But Frere heard him not. He was intent on the beacon that gleamed ever  brighter in the distance. \"Give way, my lads!\" he shouted. And amid a  cheer from the ship, the two boats shot out of the bright circle of the  blue light, and disappeared into the darkness.    Sarah Purfoy looked at Pine for an explanation, but he turned abruptly  away. For a moment the girl paused, as if in doubt; and then, ere his  retreating figure turned to retrace its steps, she cast a quick glance  around, and slipping down the ladder, made her way to the 'tween decks.    The iron-studded oak barricade that, loop-holed for musketry, and  perforated with plated trapdoor for sterner needs, separated soldiers  from prisoners, was close to her left hand, and the sentry at its  padlocked door looked at her inquiringly. She laid her little hand on  his big rough one--a sentry is but mortal--and opened her brown eyes at  him.    \"The hospital,\" she said. \"The doctor sent me\"; and before he could  answer, her white figure vanished down the hatch, and passed round the  bulkhead, behind which lay the sick man.          CHAPTER IV. THE HOSPITAL.        The hospital was nothing more nor less than a partitioned portion of the  lower deck, filched from the space allotted to the soldiers. It ran fore  and aft, coming close to the stern windows, and was, in fact, a sort of  artificial stern cabin. At a pinch, it might have held a dozen men.    Though not so hot as in the prison, the atmosphere of the lower deck was  close and unhealthy, and the girl, pausing to listen to the subdued hum  of conversation coming from the soldiers' berths, turned strangely sick  and giddy. She drew herself up, however, and held out her hand to a man  who came rapidly across the misshapen shadows, thrown by the sulkily  swinging lantern, to meet her. It was the young soldier who had been  that day sentry at the convict gangway.    \"Well, miss,\" he said, \"I am here, yer see, waiting for yer.\"    \"You are a good boy, Miles; but don't you think I'm worth waiting for?\"    Miles grinned from ear to ear.    \"Indeed you be,\" said he.    Sarah Purfoy frowned, and then smiled.    \"Come here, Miles; I've got something for you.\"    Miles came forward, grinning harder.    The girl produced a small object from the pocket of her dress. If Mrs.  Vickers had seen it she would probably have been angry, for it was  nothing less than the captain's brandy-flask.    \"Drink,\" said she. \"It's the same as they have upstairs, so it won't  hurt you.\"    The fellow needed no pressing. He took off half the contents of the  bottle at a gulp, and then, fetching a long breath, stood staring at  her.    \"That's prime!\"    \"Is it? I dare say it is.\" She had been looking at him with unaffected  disgust as he drank. \"Brandy is all you men understand.\" Miles--still  sucking in his breath--came a pace closer.    \"Not it,\" said he, with a twinkle in his little pig's eyes. \"I  understand something else, miss, I can tell yer.\"    The tone of the sentence seemed to awaken and remind her of her errand  in that place. She laughed as loudly and as merrily as she dared, and  laid her hand on the speaker's arm. The boy--for he was but a boy, one  of those many ill-reared country louts who leave the plough-tail for  the musket, and, for a shilling a day, experience all the \"pomp  and circumstance of glorious war\"--reddened to the roots of his  closely-cropped hair.    \"There, that's quite close enough. You're only a common soldier, Miles,  and you mustn't make love to me.\"    \"Not make love to yer!\" says Miles. \"What did yer tell me to meet yer  here for then?\"    She laughed again.    \"What a practical animal you are! Suppose I had something to say to  you?\"    Miles devoured her with his eyes.    \"It's hard to marry a soldier,\" he said, with a recruit's proud  intonation of the word; \"but yer might do worse, miss, and I'll work for  yer like a slave, I will.\"    She looked at him with curiosity and pleasure. Though her time was  evidently precious, she could not resist the temptation of listening to  praises of herself.    \"I know you're above me, Miss Sarah. You're a lady, but I love yer, I  do, and you drives me wild with yer tricks.\"    \"Do I?\"    \"Do yer? Yes, yer do. What did yer come an' make up to me for, and then  go sweetheartin' with them others?\"    \"What others?\"    \"Why, the cuddy folk--the skipper, and the parson, and that Frere. I see  yer walkin' the deck wi' un o' nights. Dom 'um, I'd put a bullet through  his red head as soon as look at un.\"    \"Hush! Miles dear--they'll hear you.\"    Her face was all aglow, and her expanded nostrils throbbed. Beautiful as  the face was, it had a tigerish look about it at that moment.    Encouraged by the epithet, Miles put his arm round her slim waist, just  as Blunt had done, but she did not resent it so abruptly. Miles had  promised more.    \"Hush!\" she whispered, with admirably-acted surprise--\"I heard a noise!\"  and as the soldier started back, she smoothed her dress complacently.    \"There is no one!\" cried he.    \"Isn't there? My mistake, then. Now come here, Miles.\"    Miles obeyed.    \"Who is in the hospital?\"    \"I dunno.\"    \"Well, I want to go in.\"    Miles scratched his head, and grinned.    \"Yer carn't.\"    \"Why not? You've let me in before.\" \"Against the doctor's orders. He  told me special to let no one in but himself.\"    \"Nonsense.\"    \"It ain't nonsense. There was a"]]]
