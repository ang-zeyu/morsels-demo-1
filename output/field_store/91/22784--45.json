Moses says further, that God planted a paradise in the east,  flourishing with all sorts of trees; and that among them was the tree of  life, and another of knowledge, whereby was to be known what was good  and evil; and that when he brought Adam and his wife into this garden,  he commanded them to take care of the plants. Now the garden was watered  by one river,3 which ran round about the whole earth, and was parted  into four parts. And Phison, which denotes a multitude, running into  India, makes its exit into the sea, and is by the Greeks called Ganges.  Euphrates also, as well as Tigris, goes down into the Red Sea.4 Now the  name Euphrates, or Phrath, denotes either a dispersion, or a flower: by  Tiris, or Diglath, is signified what is swift, with narrowness; and Geon  runs through Egypt, and denotes what arises from the east, which the  Greeks call Nile.    4. God therefore commanded that Adam and his wife should eat of all the  rest of the plants, but to abstain from the tree of knowledge; and  foretold to them, that if they touched it, it would prove their  destruction. But while all the living creatures had one language, 5 at  that time the serpent, which then lived together with Adam and his wife,  shewed an envious disposition, at his supposal of their living happily,  and in obedience to the commands of God; and imagining, that when they  disobeyed them, they would fall into calamities, he persuaded the woman,  out of a malicious intention, to taste of the tree of knowledge, telling  them, that in that tree was the knowledge of good and evil; which  knowledge, when they should obtain, they would lead a happy life; nay, a  life not inferior to that of a god: by which means he overcame the  woman, and persuaded her to despise the command of God. Now when she had  tasted of that tree, and was pleased with its fruit, she persuaded Adam  to make use of it also. Upon this they perceived that they were become  naked to one another; and being ashamed thus to appear abroad, they  invented somewhat to cover them; for the tree sharpened their  understanding; and they covered themselves with fig-leaves; and tying  these before them, out of modesty, they thought they were happier than  they were before, as they had discovered what they were in want of. But  when God came into the garden, Adam, who was wont before to come and  converse with him, being conscious of his wicked behavior, went out of  the way. This behavior surprised God; and he asked what was the cause of  this his procedure; and why he, that before delighted in that  conversation, did now fly from it, and avoid it. When he made no reply,  as conscious to himself that he had transgressed the command of God, God  said, \"I had before determined about you both, how you might lead a  happy life, without any affliction, and care, and vexation of soul; and  that all things which might contribute to your enjoyment and pleasure  should grow up by my providence, of their own accord, without your own  labor and pains-taking; which state of labor and pains-taking would soon  bring on old age, and death would not be at any remote distance: but now  thou hast abused this my good-will, and hast disobeyed my commands; for  thy silence is not the sign of thy virtue, but of thy evil conscience.\"  However, Adam excused his sin, and entreated God not to be angry at him,  and laid the blame of what was done upon his wife; and said that he was  deceived by her, and thence became an offender; while she again accused  the serpent. But God allotted him punishment, because he weakly  submitted to the counsel of his wife; and said the ground should not  henceforth yield its fruits of its own accord, but that when it should  be harassed by their labor, it should bring forth some of its fruits,  and refuse to bring forth others. He also made Eve liable to the  inconveniency of breeding, and the sharp pains of bringing forth  children; and this because she persuaded Adam with the same arguments  wherewith the serpent had persuaded her, and had thereby brought him  into a calamitous condition. He also deprived the serpent of speech, out  of indignation at his malicious disposition towards Adam. Besides this,  he inserted poison under his tongue, and made him an enemy to men; and  suggested to them, that they should direct their strokes against his  head, that being the place wherein lay his mischievous designs towards  men, and it being easiest to take vengeance on him, that way. And when  he had deprived him of the use of his feet, he made him to go rolling  all along, and dragging himself upon the ground. And when God had  appointed these penalties for them, he removed Adam and Eve out of the  garden into another place.              CHAPTER 2. Concerning The Posterity Of Adam, And The Ten Generations  From Him To The Deluge.    1. Adam and Eve had two sons: the elder of them was named Cain; which  name, when it is interpreted, signifies a possession: the younger was  Abel, which signifies sorrow. They had also daughters. Now the two  brethren were pleased with different courses of life: for Abel, the  younger, was a lover of righteousness; and believing that God was  present at all his actions, he excelled in virtue; and his employment  was that of a shepherd. But Cain was not only very wicked in other  respects, but was wholly intent upon getting; and he first contrived to  plough the ground. He slew his brother on the occasion following:Â—They  had resolved to sacrifice to God. Now Cain brought the fruits of the  earth, and of his husbandry; but Abel brought milk, and the first-fruits  of his flocks: but God was more delighted with the latter oblation,6  when he was honored with what grew naturally of its own accord, than he  was with what was the invention of a covetous man, and gotten by forcing  the ground; whence it was that Cain was very angry that Abel was  preferred by God before him; and he slew his brother, and hid his dead  body, thinking to escape discovery. But God, knowing what had been done,  came to Cain, and asked him what was become of his brother, because he  had not seen him of many days; whereas he used to observe them  conversing together at other times. But Cain was in doubt with himself,  and knew not what answer to give to God. At first he said that he was  himself at a loss about his brother's disappearing; but when he was  provoked by God, who pressed him vehemently, as resolving to know what  the matter was, he replied, he was not his brother's guardian or keeper,  nor was he an observer of what he did. But, in return, God convicted  Cain, as having been the murderer of his brother; and said, \"I wonder at  thee, that thou knowest not what is become of a man whom thou thyself  hast destroyed.\" God therefore did not inflict the punishment [of death]  upon him, on account of his offering sacrifice, and thereby making  supplication to him not to be extreme in his wrath to him; but he made  him accursed, and threatened his posterity in the seventh generation. He  also cast him, together with his wife, out of that land. And when he was  afraid that in wandering about he should fall among Wild beasts, and by  that means perish, God bid him not to entertain such a melancholy  suspicion, and to go over all the earth without fear of what mischief he  might suffer from wild beasts; and setting a mark upon him, that he  might be known, he commanded him to depart.    2. And when Cain had traveled over many countries, he, with his wife,  built a city, named Nod, which is a place so called, and there he  settled his abode; where also he had children. However, he did not  accept of his punishment in order to amendment, but to increase his  wickedness; for he only aimed to procure every thing that was for his  own bodily pleasure, though it obliged him to be injurious to his  neighbors. He augmented his household substance with much wealth, by  rapine and violence; he excited his acquaintance to procure pleasures  and spoils by robbery, and became a great leader of men into wicked  courses. He also introduced a change in that way of simplicity wherein  men lived before; and was the author of measures and weights. And  whereas they lived innocently and generously while they knew nothing of  such arts, he changed the world into cunning craftiness. He first of all  set boundaries about lands: he built a city, and fortified it with  walls, and he compelled his family to come together to it; and called  that city Enoch, after the name of his eldest son Enoch. Now Jared was  the son of Enoch; whose son was Malaliel; whose son was Mathusela; whose  son was Lamech; who had seventy-seven children by two wives, Silla and  Ada. Of those children by Ada, one was Jabal: he erected tents, and  loved the life of a shepherd. But Jubal, who was born of the same mother  with him, exercised himself in music;7 and invented the psaltery and the  harp. But Tubal, one of his children by the other wife, exceeded all men  in strength, and was very expert and famous in martial performances. He  procured what tended to the pleasures of the body by that method; and  first of all invented the art of making brass. Lamech was also the  father of a daughter, whose name was Naamah. And because he was so  skillful in matters of divine revelation, that he knew he was to be  punished for Cain's murder of his brother, he made that known to his  wives. Nay, even while Adam was alive, it came to pass that the  posterity of Cain became exceeding wicked, every one successively dying,  one after another, more wicked than the former. They were intolerable in  war, and vehement in robberies; and if any one were slow to murder  people, yet was he bold in his profligate behavior, in acting unjustly,  and doing injuries for gain.    3. Now Adam, who was the first man, and made out of the earth, [for our  discourse must"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2849"],[0,"Against Apion (#7)"],[1,"of affairs, if any other man ever were so;  although, as he says, all the priests of the Jews took tithes of the  products of the earth, and managed public affairs, and were in number  not above fifteen hundred at the most.\" Hecateus mentions this Hezekiah  a second time, and says, that \"as he was possessed of so great a  dignity, and was become familiar with us, so did he take certain of  those that were with him, and explained to them all the circumstances  of their people; for he had all their habitations and polity down in  writing.\" Moreover, Hecateus declares again, \"what regard we have for  our laws, and that we resolve to endure any thing rather than transgress  them, because we think it right for us to do so.\" Whereupon he adds,  that \"although they are in a bad reputation among their neighbors,  and among all those that come to them, and have been often treated  injuriously by the kings and governors of Persia, yet can they not  be dissuaded from acting what they think best; but that when they are  stripped on this account, and have torments inflicted upon them, and  they are brought to the most terrible kinds of death, they meet them  after an extraordinary manner, beyond all other people, and will not  renounce the religion of their forefathers.\" Hecateus also produces  demonstrations not a few of this their resolute tenaciousness of their  laws, when he speaks thus: \"Alexander was once at Babylon, and had an  intention to rebuild the temple of Belus that was fallen to decay, and  in order thereto, he commanded all his soldiers in general to bring  earth thither. But the Jews, and they only, would not comply with that  command; nay, they underwent stripes and great losses of what they had  on this account, till the king forgave them, and permitted them to live  in quiet.\" He adds further, that \"when the Macedonians came to them  into that country, and demolished the [old] temples and the altars, they  assisted them in demolishing them all [18] but [for not assisting them  in rebuilding them] they either underwent losses, or sometimes obtained  forgiveness.\" He adds further, that \"these men deserve to be admired on  that account.\" He also speaks of the mighty populousness of our nation,  and says that \"the Persians formerly carried away many ten thousands of  our people to Babylon, as also that not a few ten thousands were removed  after Alexander's death into Egypt and Phoenicia, by reason of the  sedition that was arisen in Syria.\" The same person takes notice in his  history, how large the country is which we inhabit, as well as of its  excellent character, and says, that \"the land in which the Jews inhabit  contains three millions of arourae, [19] and is generally of a most  excellent and most fruitful soil; nor is Judea of lesser dimensions.\"  The same man describe our city Jerusalem also itself as of a most  excellent structure, and very large, and inhabited from the most ancient  times. He also discourses of the multitude of men in it, and of the  construction of our temple, after the following manner: \"There are many  strong places and villages [says he] in the country of Judea; but one  strong city there is, about fifty furlongs in circumference, which is  inhabited by a hundred and twenty thousand men, or thereabouts; they  call it Jerusalem. There is about the middle of the city a wall of  stone, whose length is five hundred feet, and the breadth a hundred  cubits, with double cloisters; wherein there is a square altar, not made  of hewn stone, but composed of white stones gathered together, having  each side twenty cubits long, and its altitude ten cubits. Hard by it  is a large edifice, wherein there is an altar and a candlestick, both  of gold, and in weight two talents: upon these there is a light that is  never extinguished, either by night or by day. There is no image, nor  any thing, nor any donations therein; nothing at all is there planted,  neither grove, nor any thing of that sort. The priests abide therein  both nights and days, performing certain purifications, and drinking  not the least drop of wine while they are in the temple.\" Moreover, he  attests that we Jews went as auxiliaries along with king Alexander,  and after him with his successors. I will add further what he says he  learned when he was himself with the same army, concerning the actions  of a man that was a Jew. His words are these: \"As I was myself going to  the Red Sea, there followed us a man, whose name was Mosollam; he was  one of the Jewish horsemen who conducted us; he was a person of great  courage, of a strong body, and by all allowed to be the most skillful  archer that was either among the Greeks or barbarians. Now this man, as  people were in great numbers passing along the road, and a certain  augur was observing an augury by a bird, and requiring them all to stand  still, inquired what they staid for. Hereupon the augur showed him the  bird from whence he took his augury, and told him that if the bird staid  where he was, they ought all to stand still; but that if he got up, and  flew onward, they must go forward; but that if he flew backward, they  must retire again. Mosollam made no reply, but drew his bow, and shot at  the bird, and hit him, and killed him; and as the augur and some others  were very angry, and wished imprecations upon him, he answered them  thus: Why are you so mad as to take this most unhappy bird into your  hands? for how can this bird give us any true information concerning our  march, who could not foresee how to save himself? for had he been able  to foreknow what was future, he would not have come to this place, but  would have been afraid lest Mosollam the Jew should shoot at him, and  kill him.\" But of Hecateus's testimonies we have said enough; for as to  such as desire to know more of them, they may easily obtain them from  his book itself. However, I shall not think it too much for me to name  Agatharchides, as having made mention of us Jews, though in way of  derision at our simplicity, as he supposes it to be; for when he was  discoursing of the affairs of Stratonice, \"how she came out of Macedonia  into Syria, and left her husband Demetrius, while yet Seleueus would not  marry her as she expected, but during the time of his raising an army at  Babylon, stirred up a sedition about Antioch; and how, after that, the  king came back, and upon his taking of Antioch, she fled to Seleucia,  and had it in her power to sail away immediately yet did she comply with  a dream which forbade her so to do, and so was caught and put to  death.\" When Agatharehides had premised this story, and had jested upon  Stratonice for her superstition, he gives a like example of what was  reported concerning us, and writes thus: \"There are a people called  Jews, and dwell in a city the strongest of all other cities, which the  inhabitants call Jerusalem, and are accustomed to rest on every seventh  day [20] on which times they make no use of their arms, nor meddle with  husbandry, nor take care of any affairs of life, but spread out their  hands in their holy places, and pray till the evening. Now it came to  pass, that when Ptolemy, the son of Lagus, came into this city with his  army, that these men, in observing this mad custom of theirs, instead of  guarding the city, suffered their country to submit itself to a bitter  lord; and their law was openly proved to have commanded a foolish  practice. [21] This accident taught all other men but the Jews to  disregard such dreams as these were, and not to follow the like idle  suggestions delivered as a law, when, in such uncertainty of human  reasonings, they are at a loss what they should do.\" Now this our  procedure seems a ridiculous thing to Agatharehides, but will appear to  such as consider it without prejudice a great thing, and what deserved  a great many encomiums; I mean, when certain men constantly prefer the  observation of their laws, and their religion towards God, before the  preservation of themselves and their country.    23. Now that some writers have omitted to mention our nation, not  because they knew nothing of us, but because they envied us, or for some  other unjustifiable reasons, I think I can demonstrate by particular  instances; for Hieronymus, who wrote the History of Alexander's  Successors, lived at the same time with Hecateus, and was a friend of  king Antigonus, and president of Syria. Now it is plain that Hecateus  wrote an entire book concerning us, while Hieronymus never mentions us  in his history, although he was bred up very near to the places where we  live. Thus different from one another are the inclinations of men;  while the one thought we deserved to be carefully remembered, as some  ill-disposed passion blinded the other's mind so entirely, that he could  not discern the truth. And now certainly the foregoing records of the  Egyptians, and Chaldeans, and Phoenicians, together with so many of  the Greek writers, will be sufficient for the demonstration of our  antiquity. Moreover, besides those forementioned, Theophilus, and  Theodotus, and Mnaseas, and Aristophanes, and Hermogenes, Euhemerus  also, and Conon, and Zopyrion, and perhaps many others, [for I have not  lighted upon all the Greek books,] have made distinct mention of us. It  is true, many of the men before mentioned have made great mistakes about  the true accounts of our nation in the earliest times, because they had  not perused our sacred books; yet have they all of them afforded their  testimony to our antiquity, concerning which I am now treating. However,  Demetrius Phalereus, and the elder Philo, with Eupolemus, have not  greatly missed the truth about our affairs; whose lesser mistakes  ought therefore to be forgiven them; for it was not in their power to  understand our writings with the utmost accuracy.    24. One particular there is still remaining behind of what I at first  proposed to speak to, and that is, to"]]]
