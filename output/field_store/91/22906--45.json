The wood was thrown on endwise, crosswise, or any  way, so that it would burn, precisely as a crowd of boys make a bonfire  on the village green. The object being, apparently, to get rid of the  wood in the shortest possible time.    When the fire burnt low, toward mid-night, the guests would saunter off  to the hotel; and the guides, who had been waiting impatiently, would  organize what was left of the fire, roll themselves in their blankets,  and turn in. I suggested to the trapper that he and I make one fire as  it should be, and maybe they would follow suit--which would save half  the fuel, with a better fire. But he said, \"No; they like to build  bonfires, and 'Ed.' can stand the wood, because it is best to let them  have their own way. Time seems to hang heavy on their hands--and they  pay well.\" Summer boarders, tourists and sportsmen, are not the only men  who know how to build a camp-fire all wrong.    When I first came to Northern Pennsylvania, thirty-five years ago, I  found game fairly abundant; and, as I wanted to learn the country where  deer most abounded, I naturally cottoned to the local hunters. Good  fellows enough, and conceited, as all local hunters and anglers are apt  to be. Strong, good hunters and axe-men, to the manner born, and prone  to look on any outsider as a tenderfoot. Their mode of building  camp-fires was a constant vexation to me. They made it a point to always  have a heavy sharp axe in camp, and toward night some sturdy chopper  would cut eight or ten logs as heavy as the whole party could lug to  camp with hand-spikes. The size of the logs was proportioned to the  muscular force in camp. If there was a party of six or eight, the logs  would be twice as heavy as when we were three or four. Just at dark,  there would be a log heap built in front of the camp, well chinked with  bark, knots and small sticks; and, for the next two hours, one could  hardly get at the fire to light a pipe. But the fire was sure though  slow. By 10 or 11 P.M. it would work its way to the front, and the camp  would be warm and light. The party would turn in, and deep sleep would  fall on a lot of tired hunters--for two or three hours. By which time  some fellow near the middle was sure to throw his blanket off with a  spiteful jerk, and dash out of camp with, \"Holy Moses! I can't stand  this; it's an oven.\"    Another Snorer (partially waking).--\"N-r-r-rm, gu-r-r, ugh. Can't  you--deaden--fire--a little?\"    First Speaker.--\"Deaden h----. If you want the fire deadened, get up and  help throw off some of these logs.\"    Another (in coldest corner of shanty)--\"What's 'er matter--with a-you  fellows? Better dig out--an' cool off in the snow. Shanty's comfor'ble  enough.\"    His minority report goes unheeded. The camp is roasted out. Strong hands  and hand-spikes pry a couple of glowing logs from the front and replace  them with two cold, green logs; the camp cools off, and the party takes  to blankets once more--to turn out again at 5 A.M., and inaugurate  breakfast. The fire is not in favorable shape for culinary operations,  the heat is mainly on the back side, just where it isn't wanted. The few  places level enough to set a pot or pan are too hot; and, in short,  where there is any fire, there is too much. One man sees, with intense  disgust, the nozzle of his coffee-pot drop into the fire. He makes a  rash grab to save his coffee, and gets away--with the handle, which  hangs on just enough to upset the pot.    \"Old Al.,\" who is frying a slice of pork over a bed of coals that would  melt a gun barrel, starts a horse laugh, that is cut short by a blue  flash and an explosion of pork fat, which nearly blinds him. And the  writer, taking in these mishaps in the very spirit of fun and frolic, is  suddenly sobered and silenced by seeing his venison steak drop from the  end of the \"frizzling stick,\" and disappear between two glowing logs.  The party manages, however, to get off on the hunt at daylight, with  full stomachs; and perhaps the hearty fun and laughter more than  compensate for these little mishaps.    This is a digression. But I am led to it by the recollection of many  nights spent in camps and around camp-fires, pretty much as described  above. I can smile today at the remembrance of the calm, superior way in  which the old hunters of that day would look down on me, as from the  upper branches of a tall hemlock, when I ventured to suggest that a  better fire could be made with half the fuel and less than half the  labor. They would kindly remark, \"Oh, you are a Boston boy. You are used  to paying $8.00 a cord for wood. We have no call to save wood here. We  can afford to burn it by the acre.\" Which was more true than logical.  Most of these men had commenced life with a stern declaration of war  against the forest; and, although the men usually won at last, the  battle was a long and hard one. Small wonder that they came to look upon  a forest tree as a natural enemy. The camp-fire question came to a  crisis, however, with two or three of these old settlers. And, as the  story well illustrates my point, I will venture to tell it.    [Sidenote: _A Winter Camp_]    It was in the \"dark days before Christmas\" that a party of four started  from W., bound for a camp on Second Fork, in the deepest part of the  wilderness that lies between Wellsboro and the Block House. The party  consisted of Sile J., Old Al., Eli J. and the writer. The two first were  gray-haired men, the others past thirty; all the same, they called us  \"the boys.\" The weather was not inviting, and there was small danger of  our camp being invaded by summer outers or tenderfeet. It cost twelve  miles of hard travel to reach that camp; and, though we started at  daylight, it was past noon when we arrived. The first seven miles could  be made on wheels, the balance by hard tramping. The road was execrable;  no one cared to ride; but it was necessary to have our loads carried as  far as possible. The clearings looked dreary enough, and the woods  forbidding to a degree, but our old camp was the picture of desolation.  There was six inches of damp snow on the leafless brush roof, the  blackened brands of our last fire were sticking their charred ends out  of the snow, the hemlocks were bending sadly under their loads of wet  snow, and the entire surroundings had a cold, cheerless, slushy look,  very little like the ideal hunter's camp. We placed our knapsacks in the  shanty, Eli got out his nail hatchet, I drew my little pocket-axe, and  we proceeded to start a fire, while the two older men went up stream a  few rods to unearth a full-grown axe and a bottle of old rye, which they  had cached under a log three months before. They never fooled with  pocket-axes. They were gone so long that we sauntered up the band,  thinking it might be the rye that detained them. We found them with  their coats off, working like beavers, each with a stout, sharpened  stick. There had been an October freshet, and a flood-jam at the bend  had sent the mad stream over its banks, washing the log out of position  and piling a gravel bar two feet deep over the spot where the axe and  flask should have been. About the only thing left to do was to cut a  couple of stout sticks, organize a mining company, limited, and go in;  which they did. Sile was drifting into the side of the sandbar savagely,  trying to strike the axe-helve, and Old Al. was sinking numberless  miniature shafts from the surface in a vain attempt to strike whisky.  The company failed in about half an hour. Sile resumed his coat, and sat  down on a log--which was one of his best holds, by the way. He looked at  Al.; Al. looked at him; then both looked at us, and Sile remarked that,  if one of the boys wanted to go out to the clearings and \"borry\" an axe,  and come back in the morning, he thought the others could pick up wood  enough to tough it out one night. Of course nobody could stay in an open  winter camp without an axe.    It was my time to come to the front. I said: \"You two just go at the  camp; clean the snow off and slick up the inside. Put my shelter-cloth  with Eli's, and cover the roof with them; and if you don't have just as  good a fire tonight as you ever had, you can tie me to a beech and leave  me here. Come on, Eli.\" And Eli did come on. And this is how we did it:  We first felled a thrifty butternut tree ten inches in diameter, cut off  three lengths at five feet each, and carried them to camp. These were  the back logs. Two stout stakes were driven at the back of the fire, and  the logs, on top of each other, were laid firmly against the stakes. The  latter were slanted a little back, and the largest log placed at bottom,  the smallest on top, to prevent tipping forward. A couple of short,  thick sticks were laid with the ends against the bottom log by way of  fire dogs; a fore stick, five feet long and five inches in diameter; a  well built pyramid of bark, knots and small logs completed the  camp-fire, which sent a pleasant glow of warmth and heat to the furthest  corner of the shanty. For \"night-wood,\" we cut a dozen birch and ash  poles from four to six inches across, trimmed them to the tips, and  dragged them to camp. Then we denuded a dry hemlock of its bark by the  aid of ten-foot poles, flattened at one end, and packed the bark to  camp. We had a bright, cheery fire from the early evening until morning,  and four tired hunters never slept more soundly.    [Illustration: CAMP-FIRE AS IT SHOULD BE MADE]    We stayed in that camp a week; and, though the weather was rough and  cold, the little pocket-axes kept us well in firewood. We selected  butternut for backlogs, because, when green, it burns very slowly and  lasts a long time. And we dragged our smaller wood to camp"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34617"],[0,"The Jews of Barnow: Stories (#7)"],[1,"question, answered with cold severity, \"My servants are all  pious, and are stanch believers in the faith of their fathers.\" This he  said with his eyes fixed on the ground. Had he looked up he would have  seen his brother-in-law's lips tremble with bitter grief and  disappointment. And yet his answer was gentle.    \"Listen, Moses,\" he said; \"it is written, and it is a true saying, 'By  their fruits ye shall know them.' Every incident of my life is known to  you, and to all our neighbors. I have always been terribly alone in the  world, forsaken of all men, but still I have striven with all my heart  and soul to unite my life to that of others. I have striven to make it  as useful as it was possible for it to be after the blight that had  fallen upon it. You are the first person to whom I have ever said this,  and you will be the last who will ever hear from me that I know I have  acted toward my fellow-men with as much beneficence--as it is called--as  I could; and yet, what is such beneficence in reality but the duty every  man owes to his kind? I have not, therefore, lived either a happy or a  good life; but judge, Moses, I entreat of you, whether it shows either  folly or sin?\"    Moses passed his hand slowly across his forehead and eyes, as though to  give himself time for thought.    Then he answered more mildly:    \"No man can judge a whole life with a righteous judgement; God, who  knows all, can alone do so. I am willing to believe it is as you say,  and it is well for you that you can thus justify your life. For you can  thus wait quietly for the hour when God Himself will judge you. But\"--he  interrupted himself, and then continued, almost shyly--\"_do_ you believe  in God?\"    \"Yes,\" replied Schlome, raising his head; \"yes, I believe in Him. I  sought Him in my boyhood, when I imagined that he was a God of wrath and  vengeance, the light and refuge of one people alone; I sought Him in my  youth, when I imagined that He was a God of love and mercy, who yet was  only gracious to those who worshiped Him with certain forms and  ceremonies. Later on, I really found Him and knew Him as He is. He is  neither a God of wrath nor of mercy, but a God of justice and necessity;  He _is_, and all are in Him, even those who deny Him....\"    He had risen in his excitement, and as he stood in the moonlight before  Moses, the latter felt strangely moved; it seemed to him almost as if  Schlome's face shone. He did not know how it happened, but he could not  help looking at the image of Christ opposite to him in the monastery  garden, which stood out sharp and distinct in the clear pale light  against the dark sky. \"And He over there?\" he asked, almost fearing the  words he had uttered.    \"He,\" answered the Meschumed, his voice sounding strangely soft and  gentle, \"He was a great and noble man, perhaps the best man that ever  lived. But He is dead, and His spirit has died out--died out even in  those who call Him their Redeemer! The fools! Through himself alone can  man be redeemed--through himself and in himself....\"    He ceased, and Moses was silent also.    The two men sat side by side for some time without speaking, each busied  with his own thoughts.    At length Moses asked: \"And what do you want with the child?\"    \"I want to be her teacher,\" replied Schlome, \"for I have learned to love  her dearly in the few interviews I dared to have with her. And believe  me--she is no common child! Oh, had she only been a boy! I have often  thought; and then, again, I have been thankful she was a girl--you can  guess why, perhaps. She has a real hunger for knowledge, and a strange  longing for the light of truth....\"    Here the other interrupted him impatiently. \"You are dreaming,  Schlome!... Esther is scarcely nine years old, and I, her own father,  have noticed nothing of the kind in her.\"    \"Because you wouldn't see it,\" was the answer; \"because you wouldn't see  it, or, forgive me, couldn't see it. You look upon it as dreaming or  folly, or else think it childish. But I know what it is for a young  heart to have to bear that longing alone. Believe me, it would be a sin  to let it die out for want of food. I therefore beg of you to allow me  to be Esther's teacher!\"    There was another long silence between the men.    At length Moses answered: \"I can not, brother, and I dare not if I  would. It isn't because of you that I say this--I believe that you are  good, and that you would only teach the child what is good. But it would  not be suitable for my daughter. I wish her to remain a simple Jewish  girl; I wish it, and it must be so. Why should she learn what may make  her sad, and discontented with her lot? My daughter is to grow up a  pious, simple-minded woman; it is best for her that it should be so, and  that is my reason for refusing your request. I have already arranged  that she should marry a rich and honorable man.\"    \"Yes,\" said the Meschumed, and, for the first time during this  conversation, his voice sounded bitter and hard--\"yes; you are rich and  have the right to do as you will: you have therefore arranged that you  should have a rich son-in-law. The girl is now nine years old; in six or  seven years' time you will give her to the wealthiest and most pious  youth in the district, or perhaps to a widower who is even richer and  more pious. She will not know him, but what of that? she will have  plenty of time to make his acquaintance after marriage! Then she will  probably fear him, or hate him, or else he will be indifferent to her.  But what of that? What does a Jewish woman want with love? What more  does she need but to love God, and her children, and--let me not forget  to mention it--her little possessions?...\"    \"I don't understand you,\" said Moses, hesitating and astonished.    \"You do not understand me!\" cried the other, springing up excitedly.  \"Can _you_ say that--_you_? O Moses, think of my sister....\"    Moses Freudenthal started like a wild creature shot to the heart. He  wanted to answer angrily, to order Schlome to leave him at once and for  ever; but he could not do it. His eyes involuntarily sank before those  of the despised Meschumed: after a long and hard struggle with himself  he felt constrained to answer low and sadly, \"It was not my fault.\"    \"No,\" replied the other, gently; \"no, it was not your fault; it was that  of your father and mine. But remember that you, and you only, will be  responsible for what you do with your child.\"    He paused a while, and then finding that Moses was too deeply moved to  be able to answer, went on: \"Do not harden your heart, lest you be  tempted to evil. Remember what is written, 'Give to the thirsty to  drink.' Brother, will you allow me to show your child the light and life  for which her whole nature thirsts?\"    Moses was unable to answer, but next day a strange rumor was afloat in  the Ghetto, to the effect that Moses Freudenthal had become reconciled  to Schlome, the Meschumed, and had permitted him to teach his only  child!...    It is of that hour that the lonely old man in the synagogue is thinking,  and it is that hour which he curses from the bottom of his soul. The  remembrance of it follows him as he rises with the rest of the  congregation and goes out into the spring night. The narrow streets are  full of life; the houses are lighted up; the children and young girls  are standing in the doorway of their homes waiting for the return of  their parents. The unhappy man tortures himself as he walks with the  thought of how different everything would be if he were now going home  with his son-in-law and his daughter, to be greeted by his grandchildren  at the gate. Every child's laugh, every word of welcome that he hears,  cuts him to the heart. Ah, well! Perhaps he is not so very much to blame  when he mutters below his breath, \"If God is just, he will punish him  who gained the heart of my child only to lead her astray, and him also  who opened her ears to the words of the tempter!...\"    At this moment he feels a hand laid upon his shoulder, and, turning  round to see who it is, starts back as though he saw a ghost. His breath  comes thick and fast, his eyes flash, and he clinches his fist. The man  he has just cursed stands before him--a sickly, broken old man--Schlome,  the Meschumed.    \"I must speak to you,\" he says to Moses. \"I have a letter....\"    \"Silence, wretch!\" cries the other, half mad with rage and misery.  \"Silence .... I will not listen.... May you words choke....\"    A crowd collects round the two men.    The Meschumed advances a few steps nearer his brother-in-law, and  repeats: \"I must speak to you. Curse me if you like, but listen to me.  She is....\"    Before he can utter another word, Moses has turned and rushed away. He  flies like a hunted creature through the narrow streets, across the  market-place, and up to his own house. There he sinks half fainting on  the stone seat by the door. He sits still, waiting till his breathing  becomes more regular, and his pulses beat less quickly. Then all at once  he thinks he hears some one mention his name. The first-floor windows  are lighted up and widely opened; loud laughter can be heard within the  room. Frau Kasimira Lozinska is having an \"at home\" this evening. Now he  hears it again quite distinctly: his name, and then a burst of laughter.  He pays no attention to it, but goes into his parlor and sits down,  silently pushing away the food and drink the old housekeeper sets before  him. \"She is dead!\"--these words seem to ring in his ears and heart--\"of  course--she is dead!\"    Thus he sits alone in the brilliantly lighted room in a tumult of wild  thoughts, of passionate internal conflict. All around him is hushed; the  melancholy sputtering of the numerous candles is the only sound to be  heard.           *       *       *       *       *    The wife of the district judge has an \"at home\" to-night.
