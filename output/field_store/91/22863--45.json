The prevomer is joined  to the premaxillary by ossification. The posterior margin of the  prevomer bears a narrow cartilaginous articulation with the  sphenethmoid. The anterolateral and posterolateral processes of the  prevomer form an incomplete bony margin to the small choanae; each  prevomer bears four to seven teeth. The palatine is small, curved  anteriorly and edentate. The anterior part of the parasphenoid is  robust and ends in a point. The pterygoid is slender and weakly  developed.    _Natural History._--_Hyla elaeochroa_ inhabits humid lowland tropical  forests in lower Central America and breeds in temporary ponds.  Clasping pairs, gravid females, and calling males have been found  mostly in June, July, and August. William E. Duellman informed me that  he also found males calling in mid-February, late April, and May.  Duellman (1967) reported detailed observations of the social  organization in the mating call of _Hyla elaeochroa_. The choruses in  this species are initially organized, but when many individuals call,  the chorus loses organization. I observed this species breeding in a  temporary pond at Puerto Viejo, Heredia Province, Cost Rica, in late  June. Calling males and clasping pairs were extremely abundant within a  few hours after a heavy rain. Males were mostly found calling from low  emergent herbs in the pond and less commonly from bushes and trees to  heights of six meters above the water. Calling males were also observed  at Ricon de Osa, Puntarenas Province, Costa Rica, in late July. These  breeding individuals were found in a shallow pond at the edge of a wet  forest. Calling stations were less than two meters in height. John D.  Lynch informed me that after a heavy rain in early August, he found  several hundred individuals congregated in a small grassy pond less  than a foot deep, at Rincon de Osa. Males were calling from sites on  grass stems a few centimeters above the water.    The mating call of _Hyla elaeochroa_ consists of short notes, repeated  at intervals of about 0.40 second. Each note has a duration of 0.12 to  0.24 second. The fundamental frequency varies from 48 to 65 cycles per  second, and the notes have 40-50 pulses per second; the dominant  frequency is at about 2,900 cycles per second (Table 2, Pl. 4A).    The eggs are deposited in a mass in the water near floating vegetation.  William E. Duellman informed me that he observed hatchlings oriented  vertically with the tip of the mouth at the surface of the water. They  gradually sank to bottom, but swam back to surface again. No additional  information is available concerning early development. Tadpoles have  been found in shallow grassy ponds in clearings and in temporary  woodland ponds.    _Tadpoles._--Three hundred and thirty-one tadpoles in various stages of  development are available. Thirty-five tadpoles in stage 35 have a mean  body length of 8.1 mm. (8.0-9.0 mm.), tail length of 17.7 mm.  (15.0-19.5 mm.), and total length of 25.9 mm. (23.0-27.5 mm.). The  largest tadpole examined is in stage 40 and has a total length of 34.5  mm. (Table 6).    A typical tadpole, stage 35 of development (KU 104134, from Puerto  Viejo, Heredia Province, Costa Rica), has a body length of 9.1 mm.,  tail length of 17.7 mm., and a total length of 26.8 mm. Other  characters are as follows: body depressed anteriorly; body length  greater than depth of tail; internarial space as broad as interorbital  distance; nostril equidistant between eye and tip of snout; eyes  moderately large; mouth anteroventral and triangular; median fourth of  upper lip bare; rest of lip bordered by one row of papillae; clumps of  small papillae at corners of mouth; tooth rows 2/3; upper rows equal in  length; second row interrupted medially; lower rows shorter than upper  rows, diminishing in length; beak rather weak with small serrations;  spiracle short and nearer eyes than anus; anal opening not reaching  edge of ventral fin; caudal musculature attenuated distally (Figs. 2B  and 3B).

In preservative, yellowish tan and silvery-gold colors  lost; black reticulations present on tail.    _Remarks._--Cope (1876:105) described _Hyla elaeochroa_ from Sipurio,  Limon Province, Costa Rica. He based his description on a small  specimen, 26.0 mm. in snout-vent length, having a dorsum uniformly  colored and lacking an interorbital triangle and blotches on the  thighs. Cope (1887) described pigmented specimens from Nicaragua as  _Hyla quinquevittata_, which he diagnosed as having dark brown bars on  the hind limbs and five dark brown longitudinal stripes on the dorsum,  the median one of which was expanded anteriorly so as to form a large  triangular spot between the eyes. He thought this species was related  to _Hyla eximia_ Baird and noted that \"the hinder legs are much larger;  the muzzle is more acuminate and the color bands are much wider\" than  in _eximia_. Cope did not compare _quinquevittata_ with _elaeochroa_,  which he had described ten years before. Guenther (1901:268), Noble  (1918:340), and Nieden (1923:251) regarded both _elaeochroa_ and  _quinquevittata_ as valid species. Dunn and Emlen (1932:25) regarded  both as synonyms of _Hyla rubra_, but they made no qualifying  statements. Taylor (1952:859) placed _quinquevittata_ as a synonym of  _elaeochroa_ and indicated that _rubra_ was another species.    Taylor (1958:37) described _Hyla dulcensis_ from the humid tropical  forests of Golfo Dulce, Puntarenas Province, Costa Rica. He thought  this species was \"related to _H. elaeochroa_ but differs in its  somewhat larger size, smaller finger and toe discs, the obsolete  canthus rostralis; the loreal region concave and the choanae larger.\"  Duellman (1966a:270) compared adults, tadpoles, and mating calls of  _dulcensis_ and _elaeochroa_ and concluded that a single species was  involved.    _Hyla elaeochroa_ can be easily confused with the closely related _Hyla  staufferi_. Although the durations of the calls are similar, the call  of _elaeochroa_ has only about one third the number of pulses per  second, a much lower fundamental frequency, and a lower dominant  frequency than that of _staufferi_. _Hyla elaeochroa_ is larger and has  a less pointed snout than does _staufferi_. Although the skulls of the  two species are similar, that of _elaeochroa_ differs "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32518"],[0,"The Adventures of a Cat, and a Fine Cat Too! (#7)"],[1,"mmer's  afternoon, we sat in the arbour together. I do not know how it was we  had walked out there, whether at his wish or at my invitation, but there  we sat, and I remember thinking--for I said nothing--that nature had  never appeared more beautiful. The flowers seemed to be tinged with more  lovely colours; the green of the trees wore a richer and deeper hue;  the butterflies looked as if they had put on their most dazzling suits  in celebration of some holiday; and the birds appeared to be holding  high festival beneath the glowing heavens, and fluttered and twittered  and sang with greater glee than they had ever seemed to do before. My  companion's voice, low and deep at all times, was surely softer on that  evening than I had ever known it; and his eyes wore a look of tenderness  which made me cast mine to the ground, for fear he should discover the  same expression in my own.    He had just placed his paw on mine, and opened his mouth with the  intention of making a speech, which I am sure would have been a sweet  one, when I saw his face change, his back set up, his tail swell out and  move angrily to and fro, while his ears fell back, and an angry hiss  whistled fiercely from his close-set teeth, as he looked towards the  palings. I turned quickly round in the direction of his eyes, and, to my  horror, saw one of the malicious creatures of the house close by, who  was watching us with intense satisfaction through a break in the fence,  and grinning at the tender scene which I have been attempting to  describe.    When she saw she was discovered, she started off towards her own house,  uttering, as she went, a hoarse Mul-rou-u-u! but before she had got  halfway there, my companion had leapt over the fence and pounced upon  her, to punish her for her indiscreet curiosity and impertinence.  The screams of the young Puss, and the loud and angry tones of Senhor  Dickie (for I grieve to say he swore dreadfully), brought all her family  out-of-doors, who, seeing the chastisement, and without inquiring  whether it was deserved, fell upon poor Senhor Dickie in a body, and so  ill-treated him, tearing his very coat off his back, that he was forced  to run limping away, nor did he ever again venture to make his  appearance in the neighbourhood.    [Illustration: ONE TOO MANY.]    When my poor companion had thus been forced to take to flight, all the  anger of the enraged creatures fell on me. As I made my way into the  house, hisses, screams, the most horrible sounds the Cat tribe are  capable of uttering, broke from the numerous family; and, what was  worse, the uproar having brought all my neighbours out-of-doors, the  greatest falsehoods were told them about the origin of the dispute, and  I had not strength to raise my voice in order to explain the truth.  Finding there was no chance of obtaining justice, or even a hearing,  from my prejudiced judges, I walked slowly into the house, apparently  indifferent to what they were saying about my slyness and my cruelty;  but as soon as I got in-doors all my calmness vanished. Sorrow,  confusion, anger, so warred together in my bosom, that my Cat's frame  could bear it no longer. I fell to the ground in a fainting fit, and  was conveyed to bed by my servants, where I remained several days, a  prey to as much unpleasant feeling as if I were really the cruel Puss my  neighbours accused me of being, and as if it were really true that I had  persuaded poor Senhor Dickie to fall upon the little spy out of spite  towards her family.          REFLECTIONS AND RESOLUTIONS.      There is no place so conducive to reflection as the quiet of one's  bedchamber, when confined to it by sickness. It is true, when the  illness is violent, pain for the time excludes every thought beyond that  of the actual suffering,--for pain makes us all very, very selfish; but  when the bodily suffering is over, and our meditations come back into  their usual channel; when we are in a state of convalescence, and are  about shortly to resume our intercourse with the world, a crowd of  thoughts comes trooping from our brains, and we live over again much of  our former lives, and imagine beforehand scenes of our life to come.    At least it was so with me. When I had recovered from the fever into  which the disagreeable events related in the last Chapter had thrown me,  I ran over in my recollection everything that had occurred to me up to  the present time. I was again a thoughtless Kitten, gamboling on the  green, playing with my own tail, or resisting with all my might the  efforts of my poor mother to lick me clean! Again I wandered in the  fields with my young companions, clambered trees for birds, or hid  myself away in solitary places for stray rats! I once more hearkened to  my dead cousin's voice, as she warbled one of her pretty songs; and as  I still went on reflecting, I was again sitting in the arbour, listening  to the deep tones of Senhor Dickie, until the malicious face of my  neighbour's daughter, peering at us from the broken paling, broke in  upon my thoughts, and I heard the vile malicious screams and hisses of  the ill-bred Cats which had caused his abrupt departure and my present  confinement. It was a bitter recollection; and, as I recalled the scene,  I hid my face in my paws and mewed aloud.    As I got calmer I meditated upon what was best to be done. I would have  despised the reports of cruelty which I was sure were spread abroad  against me, and have continued my school, if my scholars had felt  inclined to resume their lessons; but as they had not come back after  the first day, that resource was denied me. Without some occupation, I  felt certain I could not bear the being at war with my neighbours; for  although I had done nothing unkind, they evidently believed I had; and  as there was no opportunity of convincing them of the truth, I suffered  just as much as if I had been guilty.    One road was yet open to me; and as I thought of it my eyes brightened  up, and a low purr of satisfaction unconsciously broke from my bosom--I  could travel! This idea had no sooner entered my head than it took  entire possession of me, and drove everything else out of my thoughts.  I wished to be at once well and strong, in order to carry out my  new-formed resolution. The prospect of a speedy change, and the thought  of seeing new countries and other animals, produced at once a favourable  effect, and not many days elapsed before I was able to sit up and resume  some of my usual habits.    I did not venture into the garden, for fear of again exciting the  remarks of my rude neighbours; but I sat by the door, and looked out  upon the green trees, and the blue sky, and the lively birds, with a  delight I cannot describe.    How beautiful does all nature seem after we have been deprived for some  time, by illness, of the pleasure of looking upon it! How delicious is  the air! how sweet the perfume of the flowers! and how agreeable to the  sense the hum of each fly as it basks in the sunshine, cleaning its  glittering wings, or darts in and out and round and round in chase of  some companion! It is worth being ill, to enjoy such pure happiness, and  to feel the gratitude which gushes up from our hearts at being permitted  to see again the loveliness of creation.    It has been said by more than one animal, that Cats are such selfish  creatures that they are envious of the enjoyments of others, and can  feel no pleasure beyond their own particular gratifications. I deny that  this is the truth. I, a Cat, boldly affirm, in defence of my tribe, that  they are capable of as strong and unselfish affections as those of any  other beasts; and although, as my cousin told me, when in the service of  man they display a different character, such character must not be  considered as their true one, but rather forced upon them by their state  of servitude and the want of confidence reposed in them. Even under such  disadvantageous circumstances, I have heard that they often discover  traits of kindness and fidelity, and receive many slights and insults  with a patience which would do honour to their masters themselves.    As I had no one to consult about my departure, or the day I should set  forth, I was not interrupted in my preparations, for I was too anxious  myself to obtain a change of scene, to have any delay when I once began  my arrangements.    My house was put in order; my box was packed; my servants received their  instructions, and were put on board-wages till my return. I promised  to write to them when an opportunity offered, to inform them of my  adventures, and let them know my opinions concerning the manners of  foreign countries.    [Illustration: BON VOYAGE!]    The morning at length arrived when I was to take my departure. Dressed  in my second-best clothes, with a parasol in one paw,--for the sun was  hot,--and with my travelling-bag, containing a few necessaries, in the  other, I ventured into the streets for the first time since that  memorable evening. A stout cur, whom I had hired as a valet to accompany  and protect me, walked behind me with my trunk upon his head; and as I  turned from the door I perceived my servants, and some other Cats whom I  had at times assisted, watching me as I went, and bidding me a mournful  adieu. I was affected by their gestures, and should have been more so,  but that I was still in sight of my neighbours' dwellings, and was  apprehensive of some disagreeable remarks. Fortunately none of them were  visible. I passed their houses; I got out of the very street, but not  till I had stopped at the corner and given a quiet mew to the villa  where I had spent so many pleasant days, and which I was now leaving  perhaps for ever. We moved on through the Cats' quarter, across one or  two streets inhabited by the Dogs, and out into the open country. We  soon left behind us the few straggling houses which were at the entrance  of the town, and,"]]]
