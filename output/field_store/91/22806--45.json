What the young people of to-day are  making of themselves physically, mentally and morally, is deciding what  shall be the future of the country.          THE WHITE CROSS.      The cross is considered as an emblem of self-denial, the immolating of  selfish wishes upon the altar of universal good.    In a nobler sense it means not so much self-denial as the creation  of nobler desires, so that the individual wants only those things which  he rightfully should have; he is not obliged to deny himself, because  he asks nothing but that which is noble and pure. In this sense the  cross is not so much the emblem of self-denial as an emblem of  self-ennoblement--the exaltation of self.    The White Cross typifies the purifying of the life from the desire of  mere sense pleasures. It means the noble manhood which claims for itself  the privilege of chastity and the rewards of purity.    The White Cross army is composed of men and boys over fourteen years of  age who unite to resist vice, to secure safety for the home and for  society, to become all that becomes true manhood. In organized  co-operation there is strength. It is not only the \"long pull\" and  the \"strong pull,\" but the \"pull altogether,\" that is thoroughly  successful.    Hundreds of men are living the white life individually, but are not  associated together in an effort to influence others. Such association  would result in more rapidly spreading the idea of the responsibility of  the individual, would create public opinion, would give moral support to  those who might find their unaided strength inadequate to meet the  temptations of the world, in short, would furnish the conditions  favorable to the highest ideals of social and individual life.    The White Cross Society aims to unite men in such an organized effort  for the elevation of moral standards. Its members are pledged to the  keeping of a fivefold obligation. The first of these appeals to the  chivalry latent in the heart of every man, making him a protector of  every woman, however lonely or friendless she may be, recognizing her  potential value to the race; protecting her against his own selfish  desires, against the open and covert assaults of other men, against her  own unwisdom, if need be.    The second obligation pledges the White Cross knight to a pure heart  expressed not only in conduct but in word. He will think and speak  reverently of life in all its phases, and help to cleanse the  language--written or spoken--of all that pollutes the heart or vitiates  the imagination. The third obligation claims for the White Cross soldier  the glory of living up to the highest moral standards, of being as pure  as the noblest woman that lives. The fourth recognizes the power of  influence and binds the members to a helpful interest in all humanity.    The fifth covers the whole scope of life in the obligation to use every  effort to fulfil the command, \"Keep thyself pure.\" The heart of the true  man must throb a quick response to the appeal made to him by the White  Cross.    It means marital fidelity, it implies the sanctity of the home, it  creates individual purity, and that insures social purity, it means a  nobler manhood, a grander womanhood, a safer childhood.    The appeal is made to you individually. Will you not become a White  Cross knight? Will you not, even if you cannot join an organized  society, become a standard-bearer of the White Cross, pledging yourself  to its five obligations? Soon you will find others willing to unite with  you in this great work, and the society will be formed.    Each one who reads this book may become a true and faithful knight of  the White Cross, no matter where he may be, in city mart or lonely farm,  in busy shop or quiet school, and not only may he be a soldier, but he  may be a recruiting officer, inducing others to enlist under the White  Cross banner.

No one can claim originality in comparing the body to a house, for that  comparison is as old as literature.    But the simile is still of interest to the juvenile mind, and as science  is ever making new discoveries, there is continual demand for new and  interesting works on physiology.    Dr. Wood-Allen in this new book has united scientific "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29070"],[0,"Brighter Britain! (Volume 1 of 2) (#7)"],[1," citizens, standing in well  laid-out grounds, and making a very pleasing picture.    We now look right across the densest part of the city, from our first  standpoint near St. Matthew's Church. Below is Queen Street, with the  roofs of the various buildings already noticed in it. Beyond it there is  a corresponding high ground to that on which we are, and behind that  again is Freeman's Bay. On the crest of the eminence is St. Paul's  \"cathedral\"--so styled; the principal Anglican church of the city. In  the distance the breezy suburb of Ponsonby is pointed out to us,  occupying high ground, from which is visible the winding valley of the  Waitemata, stretching away up into the hills. Here and there can be  seen the spires or belfries of numerous churches and chapels, for  Auckland is an eminently religious city, and has temples and tabernacles  for almost every Christian creed.    Our companion dilates upon the institutions of the city, which are  highly creditable to so young a community, and are in advance of those  of many European towns of equal population, that can trace back their  history considerably further than Auckland's thirty-and-odd years. In  matters ecclesiastical and educational the young city is indeed well  endowed. There are two bishops, Roman and Anglican, a Presbytery, and  governing bodies of other denominations. There is a College and Grammar  School of the New Zealand University, common schools in the city,  private schools of all sorts and sects, a training school and ship at  Kohimarama, an establishment for young clergymen, and convent schools.  There are asylums, orphanages, and refuges.    There are institutes and halls belonging to all kinds of societies:  Young Men's Christian Association, Mechanics, Good Templars, Freemasons,  Orangemen, Oddfellows, Foresters, etc. There is the Auckland Institute  and Museum, the Acclimatization Society, Agricultural Society,  Benevolent Societies, etc. There are Cricketing, Rowing, and Yachting  Clubs. There is a mayor and City Council, with Harbour Board, Highway  Board, Domain Board, and Improvement Commissions. There is the Supreme  Court, the District Court, the Resident Magistrate's Court, and the  Police Court. There are public and circulating libraries, two daily  morning newspapers, an evening newspaper, two weekly newspapers, two  weekly journals of fiction, and two monthly religious periodicals.    The city is lighted by gas supplied by a private company; and the  water-supply is under municipal control. It returns three members to the  House of Representatives, while Parnell and Newton each return one. So  much and more does our cicerone favour us with, until he has, as he  thinks, convinced us that Auckland is really the finest place of  residence in the world.    We now pass down into the city again, taking a new route past the  Northern Club, a lofty and unsightly building, whose members are  notoriously hospitable, and much given to whist and euchre. Downhill a  short distance, and we come to the Albert Barracks, where newly-arrived  immigrants are housed, and where most of our sometime shipmates now are.  They are comfortably quartered here for the present, but no incitement  is held out to them to remain long, and every inducement is given them  to get an engagement and quit as soon as may be. It seldom happens that  there is any difficulty in this; usually, indeed, there is a rush to  engage the new-comers, so much are servants and labourers, mechanics and  artizans in request.    There have been times when would-be employers would go off in  shore-boats to the immigrant ship in the harbour, and though not allowed  on board, would make efforts to hire domestics and labourers at the side  of the vessel. Again, when the government immigrants were landed, and  were marched up from the wharf to the barracks, a mob of employers would  escort the procession, endeavouring to hire helps, and with such success  that sometimes the barracks were hardly needed at all. But such scenes  are becoming rarer now, though there must continue, for many years to  come, to be a run upon certain classes of immigrants, notably single  girls for house-servants.[2]    Turning into the barrack-yard, round which are the various buildings  where the immigrants are temporarily housed, we find an animated scene  before us. Here are assembled most of our immigrant shipmates, some few  of whom have already got engagements and gone off. A considerable party  of settlers and agents are now busily at work trying to hire the people  they severally want; while the poor bewildered immigrants find  themselves treated as though they were goods in an auction-room, and  scarcely know whether they are standing on their heads or their heels.    It so happens that there is just now a great demand for agricultural and  domestics, so that settlers are actually bidding against each other for  the individuals they want to engage. Our ship-load was no special body  of people, but a motley collection of men, women, and children from all  parts of the old country. Among them are natives of Kent and of  Cornwall, of Yorkshire and of Wales, of Inverness and of Galway.    Here are a couple of brothers whom we made special friends with on the  voyage, young hardy Scots; let us see how they get on. We find them at a  premium, surrounded by a little crowd of farmers from the Waikato, who  each and all seem intent on hiring them. The lads do not wish to part if  they can help it; and so, as to get one means to get both, the farmers  are all the hotter in their pursuit of them. For these young men are  just the right sort that are most wanted, having the thews and sinews  and power of endurance so necessary for a rough life; having experience  of sheep and cattle and agricultural work from their earliest infancy;  having, in fact, all the qualities most essential and useful to the  pioneer farmer. They come of the right race, too, as all the world  knows--colonists especially--for honesty, sobriety, and patient  industry.    What a change for them--from the inclement sky, the hostile winter, the  rugged battle for life they have left behind them with their native  Grampians, to this bright clime of everlasting summer, of strange  fertility, to these sunshiny isles of beauty and plenty! Well, well, it  is not a land of indolence either; the work demanded here is stern and  hard and rough; but what a reward may be reaped in the end from earnest  and unshrinking toil! No wonder if, in a year or two's time, our friends  yonder will write to the dear ones they left at home, in the Perthshire  glen, such an account as shall bear witness that they, at least, have  found on earth the Peasant's Paradise!    There is hot and excited bargaining going on in the group of which the  brothers form the centre. They are a little dazed, and do not venture to  speak; but they are canny for all that, and bide their time. Amid the  babel of voices that surrounds us on all sides, we catch a few  utterances as follows:--    \"Five shillings a day, and your tucker!\"    \"Five and threepence, lads!\"    \"He'll give you nothing but salt pork; try me at the same wage!\"    \"And you'll have to live on potatoes and pumpkins with him!\"    \"Five and six, and as much mutton as you want!\"    \"Too much, perhaps, and braxy at that!\"    \"Come, a cottage to yourselves, rations, and five and six a day!\"    \"Cottage! A tumble-down whare is what he means!\"    \"Fresh meat every day with me, boys--beef, mutton, and pork!\"    \"Yes; and he'll want you to work twelve hours!\"    \"Better engage with me at five and nine; I'll lodge you well, and feed  you first chop!\"    And so on and so on, until at last the brothers pluck up determination,  and make choice of an employer. So our Caledonian friends begin to  gather together their traps and make preparations to accompany their  complaisant and well-satisfied boss to his farm on the banks of the  Waikato. And an indescribable joy is in their hearts, for they are to  receive six shillings and sixpence a day, and to be provided with  comfortable lodging and lavish \"tucker\" withal; and though, no doubt,  they will prove worthy of that high wage to their employer, yet what  marvellous wealth it is, compared to the most they could have earned had  they remained to toil upon the braes of Albyn!    Of course, very few of the other immigrants get such a wage as that. The  two young Scots are the picked men of the crowd. Five shillings a day  and \"all found\" is the ordinary wage for an agricultural, and though  some are worth more, new-chums are generally held to be worth a good  deal less for their first year. The distich--      \"Eight hours' sleep and eight hours' play,    Eight hours' work and eight bob a day,\"    has been, and is, verified literally over and over again in New Zealand;  but the \"eight bob a day\" cannot be called an ordinary wage. A man must  be worth his salt and something over to get it, and will not do so  unless labour is scarce and in much demand. Those who contract, or do  work by the piece, often make as much and more if they are first-rate  workers; and that kind of engagement is preferred by both employers and  employes, as a rule.    All sorts of skilled labourers get high wages. Carpenters and  blacksmiths will get ten and twelve shillings a day with their keep;  and when they have saved a little money, and can go on the job by  themselves, they may earn an advance on that.    I have already noticed the great demand that there is for female  house-servants, and the high wages they can get. Girls cannot be relied  on to stop in a situation very long, as they are sure to receive  numerous matrimonial offers; hence there is a perpetual seeking after  new domestics. Marriage is an institution that turns out uncommonly well  here. There is no such thing as a descent to pauperism for those who  will work. By little and little the working couple thrive and prosper,  and "]]]
