Parliamentary monarchy - a state headed by a monarch who is not  actively involved in policy formation or implementation (i.e., the  exercise of sovereign powers by a monarch in a ceremonial capacity);  true governmental leadership is carried out by a cabinet and its head -  a prime minister, premier, or chancellor - who are drawn from a  legislature (parliament).    Republic - a representative democracy in which the people's elected  deputies (representatives), not the people themselves, vote on  legislation.    Socialism - a government in which the means of planning, producing, and  distributing goods is controlled by a central government that  theoretically seeks a more just and equitable distribution of property  and labor; in actuality, most socialist governments have ended up being  no more than dictatorships over workers by a ruling elite.    Sultanate - similar to a monarchy, but a government in which the  supreme power is in the hands of a sultan (the head of a Muslim state);  the sultan may be an absolute ruler or a sovereign with  constitutionally limited authority.    Theocracy - a form of government in which a Deity is recognized as the  supreme civil ruler, but the Deity's laws are interpreted by  ecclesiastical authorities (bishops, mullahs, etc.); a government  subject to religious authority.    Totalitarian - a government that seeks to subordinate the individual to  the state by controlling not only all political and economic matters,  but also the attitudes, values, and beliefs of its population.

Heliports    This entry gives the total number of heliports with hard-surface  runways, helipads, or landing areas that support routine sustained  helicopter operations exclusively and have support facilities including  one or more of the following facilities: lighting, fuel, passenger  handling, or maintenance. It includes former airports used exclusively  for helicopter operations but excludes heliports limited to day  operations and natural clearings that could support helicopter landings  and takeoffs.    Household income or consumption by percentage share    Data on household income or consumption come from household surveys,  the results adjusted for household size. Nations use different  standards and procedures in collecting and adjusting the data. Surveys  based on income will normally show a more unequal distribution than  surveys based on consumption. The quality of surveys is improving with  time, yet caution is still necessary in making inter-country  comparisons.    Hydrographic data codes    see Data codes    Illicit drugs    This entry gives information on the five categories of illicit drugs -  narcotics, stimulants, depressants (sedatives), hallucinogens, and  cannabis. These categories include many drugs legally produced and  prescribed by doctors as well as those illegally produced and sold  outside of medical channels.    Cannabis (Cannabis sativa) is the common hemp plant, which provides  hallucinogens with some sedative properties, and includes marijuana  (pot, Acapulco gold, grass, reefer), tetrahydrocannabinol (THC,  Marinol), hashish (hash), and hashish oil (hash oil).    Coca (mostly Erythroxylum coca) is a bush with leaves that contain the  stimulant used to make cocaine. Coca is not to be confused with cocoa,  which comes from cacao seeds and is used in making chocolate, cocoa,  and cocoa butter.    Cocaine is a stimulant derived from the leaves of the coca bush.    Depressants (sedatives) are drugs that reduce tension and anxiety and  include chloral hydrate, barbiturates (Amytal, Nembutal, Seconal,  phenobarbital), benzodiazepines (Librium, Valium), methaqualone  (Quaalude), glutethimide (Doriden), and others (Equanil, Placidyl,  Valmid).    Drugs are any chemical substances that effect a physical, mental,  emotional, or behavioral change in an individual.    Drug abuse is the use of any licit or illicit chemical substance that  results in physical, mental, emotional, or behavioral impairment in an  individual.    Hallucinogens are drugs that affect sensation, thinking, self-  awareness, and emotion. Hallucinogens include LSD (acid, microdot),  mescaline and peyote (mexc, buttons, cactus), amphetamine variants  (PMA, STP, DOB), phencyclidine (PCP, angel dust, hog), phencyclidine  analogues (PCE, PCPy, TCP), and others (psilocybin, psilocyn).    Hashish is the resinous exudate of the cannabis or hemp plant (Cannabis  sativa).    Heroin is a semisynthetic derivative of morphine.    Mandrax is a trade name for methaqualone, a pharmaceutical depressant.    Marijuana is the dried leaf of the cannabis or hemp plant (Cannabis  sativa).    Methaqualone is a pharmaceutical depressant, referred to as mandrax in  Southwest Asia and Africa.    Narcotics are drugs that relieve pain, often induce sleep, and refer to  opium, opium derivatives, and synthetic substitutes. Natural narcotics  include opium (paregoric, parepectolin), morphine (MS-Contin, Roxanol),  codeine (Tylenol with codeine, Empirin with codeine, Robitussan AC),  and thebaine. Semisynthetic narcotics include heroin (horse, smack),  and hydromorphone (Dilaudid). Synthetic narcotics include meperidine or  Pethidine (Demerol, Mepergan), methadone (Dolophine, Methadose), and  others (Darvon, Lomotil).    Opium is the brown, gummy exudate of the incised, unripe seedpod of the  opium poppy.    Opium poppy (Papaver somniferum) is the source for the natural and  semisynthetic narcotics.    Poppy straw is the entire cut and dried opium poppy-plant material,  other than the seeds. Opium is extracted from poppy straw in commercial  operations that produce the drug for medical use.    Qat (kat, khat) is a stimulant from the buds or leaves of Catha edulis  that is chewed or drunk as tea.    Quaaludes is the North American slang term for methaqualone, a  pharmaceutical depressant.    Stimulants are drugs that relieve mild depression, increase energy and  activity, and include cocaine (coke, snow, crack), amphetamines  (Desoxyn, Dexedrine), ephedrine, ecstasy (clarity, essence, doctor,  Adam), phenmetrazine (Preludin), methylphenidate (Ritalin), and others  (Cylert, Sanorex, Tenuate).    Imports    This entry provides the total US dollar amount of merchandise imports  on a c.i.f. (cost, insurance, and freight) or f.o.b. (free on board)  basis. These figures are calculated on an exchange rate basis, i.e.,  not in purchasing power parity (PPP) terms.

Independence    For most countries, this entry gives the date that sovereignty was  achieved and from which nation, empire, or trusteeship. For the other  countries, the date given may not represent \"independence\" in the  strict sense, but rather some significant nationhood event such as the  traditional founding date or the date of unification, federation,  confederation, establishment, fundamental change in the form of  government, or state succession. Dependent areas include the notation  \"none\" followed by the nature of their dependency status. Also see the  Terminology note.

He has abused my credulity, he now abuses my love!  He does not know me! He thinks he can trample on me--me, in whose power  are his fortune, his honour, his very life itself!\"    Then, turning to Rose--    \"And you, miserable woman! by what unworthy artifice did you gain his  love? Was it by witchcraft? or some poisonous philtre learned from your  worthy father?\"    \"Alas! no, madame; my weakness is my only crime, and also my only  excuse. I loved him, long ago, when I was only a young girl, and these  memories have been my ruin.\"    \"Memories? What! did you also think you were loving the same man? Are  you also his dupe? Or are you only pretending, in order to find a rag of  excuse to cover your wickedness?\"    It was now Rose who failed to understand; Bertrande continued, with  growing excitement--    \"Yes, it was not enough to usurp the rights of a husband and father, he  thought to play his part still better by deceiving the mistress also . .  . . Ah! it is amusing, is it not? You also, Rose, you thought he was  your old lover! Well, I at least am excusable, I the wife, who only  thought she was faithful to her husband!\"    \"What does it all mean?\" asked the terrified Rose.    \"It means that this man is an impostor and that I will unmask him.  Revenge! revenge!\"    Pierre came forward. \"Bertrande,\" he said, \"so long as I thought you  were happy, when I feared to disturb your peace, I was silent, I  repressed my just indignation, and I spared the usurper of the name and  rights of my nephew. Do you now give me leave to speak?\"    \"Yes,\" she replied in a hollow voice.    \"You will not contradict me?\"    By way of answer she sat down by the table and wrote a few hasty lines  with a trembling hand, then gave them to Pierre, whose eyes sparkled  with joy.    \"Yes,\" he said, \"vengeance for him, but for her pity. Let this  humiliation be her only punishment. I promised silence in return for  confession, will you grant it?\"    Bertrande assented with a contemptuous gesture.    \"Go, fear not,\" said the old man, and Rose went out. Pierre also left  the house.    Left to herself, Bertrande felt utterly worn out by so much emotion;  indignation gave way to depression. She began to realise what she had  done, and the scandal which would fall on her own head. Just then her  baby awoke, and held out its arms, smiling, and calling for its father.  Its father, was he not a criminal? Yes! but was it for her to ruin him,  to invoke the law, to send him to death, after having taken him to her  heart, to deliver him to infamy which would recoil on her own head and  her child's and on the infant which was yet unborn? If he had sinned  before God, was it not for God to punish him? If against herself, ought  she not rather to overwhelm him with contempt? But to invoke the help,  of strangers to expiate this offence; to lay bare the troubles of her  life, to unveil the sanctuary of the nuptial couch--in short, to summon  the whole world to behold this fatal scandal, was not that what in her  imprudent anger she had really done? She repented bitterly of her haste,  she sought to avert the consequences, and notwithstanding the night and  the bad weather, she hurried at once to Pierre's dwelling, hoping at all  costs to withdraw her denunciation. He was not there: he had at once  taken a horse and started for Rieux. Her accusation was already on its  way to the magistrates!    At break of day the house where Martin Guerre lodged when at Rieux was  surrounded by soldiers. He came forward with confidence and inquired  what was wanted. On hearing the accusation, he changed colour slightly,  then collected himself, and made no resistance. When he came before the  judge, Bertrande's petition was read to him, declaring him to be \"an  impostor, who falsely, audaciously, and treacherously had deceived her  by taking the name and assuming the person of Martin Guerre,\" and  demanding that he should be required to entreat pardon from God, the  king, and herself.    The prisoner listened calmly to the charge, and met it courageously,  only evincing profound surprise at such a step being taken by a wife who  had lived with him for two years since his return, and who only now  thought of disputing the rights he had so long enjoyed. As he was  ignorant both of Bertrande's suspicions and their confirmation, and also  of the jealousy which had inspired her accusation, his astonishment was  perfectly natural, and did not at all appear to be assumed. He  attributed the whole charge to the machinations of his uncle, Pierre  Guerre; an old man, he said, who, being governed entirely by avarice and  the desire of revenge, now disputed his name and rights, in order the  better to deprive him of his property, which might be worth from sixteen  to eighteen hundred livres. In order to attain his end, this wicked man  had not hesitated to pervert his wife's mind, and at the risk of her own  dishonour had instigated this calumnious charge--a horrible and  unheard-of thing in the mouth of a lawful wife. \"Ah! I do not blame  her,\" he cried; \"she must suffer more than I do, if she really  entertains doubts such as these; but I deplore her readiness to listen  to these extraordinary calumnies originated by my enemy.\"    The judge was a good deal impressed by so much assurance. The accused  was relegated to prison, whence he was brought two days later to  encounter a formal examination.    He began by explaining the cause of his long absence, originating, he  said, in a domestic quarrel, as his wife well remembered. He there  related his life during these eight years. At first he wandered over the  country, wherever his curiosity and the love of travel led him. He then  had crossed the frontier, revisited Biscay, where he was born, and  having entered the service of the Cardinal of Burgos, he passed thence  into the army of the King of Spain. He was wounded at the battle of St.  Quentin, conveyed to a neighbouring village, where he recovered,  although threatened with amputation. Anxious to again behold his wife  and child, his other relations and the land of his adoption, he returned  to Artigues, where he was immediately recognised by everyone, including  the identical Pierre Guerre, his uncle, who now had the cruelty to  disavow him. In fact, the latter had shown him special affection up to  the day when Martin required an account of his stewardship. Had he only  had the cowardice to sacrifice his money and thereby defraud his  children, he would not to-day be charged as an impostor. \"But,\"  continued Martin, \"I resisted, and a violent quarrel ensued, in which  anger perhaps carried me too far; Pierre Guerre, cunning and revengeful,  has waited in silence. He has taken his time and his measures to  organise this plot, hoping thereby to obtain his ends, to bring justice  to the help of his avarice, and to acquire the spoils he coveted, and  revenge for his defeat, by means of a sentence obtained from the  scruples of the judges.\" Besides these explanations, which did not  appear wanting in probability, Martin vehemently protested his  innocence, demanding that his wife should be confronted with him, and  declaring that in his presence she would not sustain the charge of  personation brought against him, and that her mind not being animated by  the blind hatred which dominated his persecutor, the truth would  undoubtedly prevail.    He now, in his turn, demanded that the judge should acknowledge his  innocence, and prove it by condemning his calumniators to the punishment  invoked against himself; that his wife, Bertrande de Rolls, should be  secluded in some house where her mind could no longer be perverted, and,  finally, that his innocence should be declared, and expenses and  compensations awarded him.    After this speech, delivered with warmth, and with every token of  sincerity, he answered without difficulty all the interrogations of the  judge. The following are some of the questions and answers, just as they  have come down to us:--    \"In what part of Biscay were you born?\"    \"In the village of Aymes, province of Guipuscoa.\"    \"What were the names of your parents?\"    \"Antonio Guerre and Marie Toreada.\"    \"Are they still living?\"    \"My father died June 15th, 1530; my mother survived him three years and  twelve days.\"    \"Have you any brothers and sisters?\"    \"I had one brother, who only lived three months. My four sisters, Inez,  Dorothea, Marietta, and Pedrina, all came to live at Artigues when I  did; they are there still, and they all recognised me.\"    \"What is the date of your marriage?\"    \"January 10, 1539.\"    \"Who were present at the ceremony?\"    \"My father-in-law, my mother-in-law, my uncle, my two sisters, Maitre  Marcel and his daughter Rose; a neighbour called Claude Perrin, who got  drunk at the wedding feast; also Giraud, the poet, who composed verses  in our honour.\"    \"Who was the priest who married you?\"    \"The old cure, Pascal Guerin, whom I did not find alive when I  returned.\"    \"What special circumstances occurred on the wedding-day?\"    \"At midnight exactly, our neighbour, Catherine Boere, brought us the  repast which is known as 'medianoche.' This woman has recognised me, as  also our old Marguerite, who has remained with us ever since the  wedding.\"    \"What is the date of your son's birth?\"    \"February 10, 1548, nine years after our marriage. I was only twelve  when the ceremony took place, and did not arrive at manhood till several  years later.\"    \"Give the date of your leaving Artigues.\"    \"It was in August 1549. As I left the village, I met Claude Perrin and  the cure Pascal, and took leave of them. I went towards Beauvais, end I  passed through Orleans, Bourges, Limoges, Bordeaux, and Toulouse. If you  want the names of people whom I saw and to whom I spoke, you can have  them. What more can I say?\"    Never, indeed, was there a more apparently veracious statement!
