Wipe inside the eyelids a little  liquid glue and carefully set the eyes, using care to preserve natural  fullness of the ball under lids.    In drying, the tip of the nose will shrink away. When the specimen is  dry and the nose-wire is cut off, a wax tip may be modeled on, nostrils  being punched into it with a bit of wire.    To set the wax nose, with a sharp knife trim away the shrunken tip,  place a bit of wax upon the socket, and melt it into firm contact with a  heated wire. Shape the artificial nose with a small wooden modeling  tool. Replace faded colors of turtles with thin tints of tube colors.    An ideal method of mounting turtles is to finish head, neck, legs, and  tail in compo. No. II.    Use the leg bones and wrap them thinly with tow. Wrap a small, hard, tow  neck upon the wire and a thin tow core upon the tail-wire. Cover these  cores, to natural size of muscles, with papier mache.    Cover the skull where meat was scraped from jaws. Push the neck, tail  and legs into place and wire to shell as in Fig. 27. Stuff shell with  tow to hold papier mache filling of limbs in place until dry.    Turtles mounted in this way should be positioned upon a board, modeled  with a tool into anatomical lines of neck, legs, etc., and allowed to  remain wired upon the board until the compo. begins to harden.    When this is well under way, take the turtle from the board and finish  drying, wrong side up in a well ventilated place. Remove the tow from  inside the shell to allow of quicker evaporation. Turtles mounted with  sawdust dry very quickly and usually very slowly when finished in papier  mache.      PREPARING AND MOUNTING A SMALL LIZARD      (Apply the wrapped body principle, given herewith, to mounting    small snakes, using a wire through center.)    A horned toad is a good example for us to work out in this department.  Skin the specimen as you would a small mammal, except that body incision  runs from jaw to tip of tail and skull is left attached to face-skin.  Keep the skinned carcass in alcohol for reference in making the hard  wrapped excelsior body. Mount as you would a bird specimen, except that  all leg-wires are set solid same as the two legs of the bird are.    The lizard's leg bones are wired exactly as in a bird and are wrapped  with tow or cotton to replace muscles. Wire neck and tail and put the  specimen together as shown in Fig. 29.    [Illustration: Fig. 29.]    Position the specimen and wire upon a temporary base. Set eyes same as  in turtles. When dry finish in same manner as a turtle.    In large lizards a light covering of compo. No. II may be employed over  a hard wrapped core, but is not so satisfactory as dry mounting as the  skins of lizards are water-proof and consequently do not allow of  moisture evaporating. With care in application the first mentioned  method may be employed upon nearly all lizard specimens with most  satisfactory results.    Alligators may be mounted with wrapped legs and tail and stuffed body,  like the small mammal method with the exception of the head.    Be sure to remove all the jaw meat, tongue, and eye socket fat from the  skulls of lizard specimens. Replace tongue and other tissues with  colored wax and cotton when mouth is opened.      PREPARING AND MOUNTING A SMALL CRUSTACEAN    A crawfish or \"land crab\" will serve as a typical medium for describing  the method of preparing specimens of this nature.    When possible, take notes of the living colors.    Crustaceans may be killed most handily with chloroform. Place the  specimen in a large mouthed bottle or other vessel that may be closed  tightly. Pour a little chloroform upon a wad of cotton and drop it into  the vessel with the specimen and close up tightly.    When beginning work, lay the specimen upon its back and with a sharp  scalpel loosen the large thorax plate around its edge and remove it  carefully with head and antennae left attached intact.    Separate tail entire from body meat. Split it along fleshy under side  and remove muscles from it with the scalpel.    The legs will come apart and must be kept in natural order. If the claws  are large and meaty, cut a round hole in under side of thick part and  scrape meat out. Apply arsenic-water to all inner surfaces.    Cut wires of suitable size for all the legs. Have them enough longer  than the legs so that a sharpened end will protrude to run through and  clinch in the body core. Push wires in full length of legs. (Fig. 30.  shows the details of making the body core of fine excelsior.) Make the  core of a size to fit a little loosely into shell of body and tail.    [Illustration: Fig. 30.]    Set legs upon core as shown in Fig. 31. When the legs are properly  anchored, cover the core with enough of compo. No. I. so it will fit  snugly into thorax and tail shells. Place these upon the core now and  press them accurately into position.    [Illustration: Fig. 31.]    Whatever compo. squeezes out may be removed with a bit of damp cloth or  sponge. Position legs and tail approximately and wire upon the base. Set  the legs in their permanent position, spread or close the tail fan as  desired, arrange the antennae, and set the specimen in a well ventilated  spot to dry. Tint with oil colors, thinned with kerosene as they are  used, laying the tints on with soft brushes.    Sanded or graveled board bases may be made for birds, turtles, etc., by  applying a coat of heavy shellac to top and sides of pieces, cut to  required sizes and shapes, and before the shellac has a chance to dry,  throwing sand or fine gravel on forcibly or laying the boards in the  sand and piling sand over the moist tops, letting them lay a few moments  before removing and shaking off the loose sand. Allow such bases to dry  thoroughly before using.          PREPARING AND MOUNTING A VIRGINIA DEER HEAD          CHAPTER V    PREPARING AND MOUNTING A VIRGINIA DEER HEAD      Well mounted trophies of the chase are a source of delight to the  fortunate sportsman who possesses them.    Antlered game heads that are mounted true to life in form and expression  may go far to beautify many dining rooms, dens, and hallways, enhancing  the artistic tone of the rooms in which they are well placed.    As in all taxidermy work, outline sketches direct from the fresh  specimen, top and side views, both before and after skinning, are of  great value in mounting deer heads.    As in other specimens, deer scalps for mounting should be as fresh as  possible. If a scalp is to be kept for some little time before mounting  it should be well salted.    Roll the scalp up and lay over night to drain. Next day scrape off the  first salt and rub in another thorough salting. Keep the skin rolled up  to prevent drying hard until mounting or sent to the tanner.    An ideal deer scalp includes the neck skin entire to swell of shoulders  and brisket. The incisions to be made for removing a deer scalp are  shown in Fig. 32. A good sharp knife will be required for peeling the  skin from the neck.    [Illustration: Fig. 32.]    Cut very carefully up under rim of horn bases when removing skin from  around them, using care not to haggle edge of skin. Use same care in  skinning out the face, splitting lips and eyelids and skinning out the  ears as in small mammal specimen. Remove the ear cartilages entire,  after skinning their backs, beginning at the thick top edge and  proceeding very carefully, looking out not to tear open the edges.    Scalps may be mounted raw or tanned. The ideal way is to use a tanned,  thin pared scalp, mounting it with papier mache upon a modeled mannikin.  The raw skin method is perhaps easiest of application, but in all ways  is not as satisfactory as the tanned skin method.    For mounting a deer scalp raw, if salted, soak out the salt by squeezing  through two or three baths of cold, weak carbolic water. Dry the scalp  thoroughly in fine sawdust, rubbing it into the hair and repeatedly  shaking until all moisture is removed.    With a small, hardwood paring \"beam,\" shown in Fig. 33, clamped to edge  of table, and a sharp paring knife, remove all flesh from inner surface  of skin and peel out nose cartilage. Leave nearly an inch of nostril  lining around the openings.    [Illustration: Fig. 33.]    Pare all flesh from lips, leaving a half or three-quarters inch of the  lining all around them. Split white eyelid lining free to edge and leave  a quarter inch of it all around the openings. When skinning out the  ears keep the cartilages for models.    Poison all inner surfaces of the cleaned skin with arsenic water brushed  in well. Fold face, wrong side out, back upon neck. Fold neck skin flesh  to flesh over face, roll the scalp up, hair side out, and lay aside in  cool place over one night before mounting. The mannikin should be  prepared in time so that the skin will not have to lay wet for more than  a day before mounting.    It is well to prepare mannikin before skin is poisoned so that skin may  be used for fitting unless accurate outline studies are at hand. With  these the fitting is not necessary.    For raw-mounting the head, clean skull by boiling in a deep pail until  meat comes off easily. A little washing soda in the water will help  clean the bone. With a saw, cut through under side of brain cavity,  lengthwise on each side of axis bone. Cut the loosened piece out with a  chisel and remove brain.    Set the skull upon neck-board of suitable length (refer to studies)  mounted with screws upon a cut out neck base-board of inch thick wood,  as shown in Fig. 34. Fasten skull to top of neck board with nails driven  through holes drilled through the bone. If turned head is desired, make  opening in under side of brain cavity wider and nail skull at any  desired angle upon top of neck board. Screw upon back of neck base-board  a one by three inch piece with free end dropping a few inches below  bottom of base-board so "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29728"],[0,"Cookery and Dining in Imperial Rome (#7)"],[1,"about  \"C{oe}lius,\" Torinus would be the man. (Cf. Schanz, Roem. Lit. Gesch.,  Mueller's Handbuch d. klass. Altertums-Wissenschaft, V III, 112, p.  506.) However, there is no _raison d'etre_ for C{oe}lius.    His presence and the unreality thereof has been cleared up by Vollmer,  as will be duly shown. The squabble of the medieval savants has also  given rise to the story that Apicius is but a joke perpetrated upon  the world by a medieval savant. This will be refuted also later on.  Our book is a genuine Roman. Medieval savants have made plenty of  Roman \"fakes,\" for sundry reasons. A most ingenious hoax was the  \"completion\" of the Petronius fragment by a scholar able to hoodwink  his learned contemporaries by an exhibition of Petronian literary  style and a fertile imagination. Ever so many other \"fakers\" were  shown up in due time. When this version of Petronius was pronounced  genuine by the scientific world, the perpetrator of the \"joke\"  confessed, enjoying a good laugh at the expense of his colleagues. But  we shall presently understand how such a \"joke\" with Apicius would be  impossible. Meanwhile, we crave the indulgence of the modern reader  with our mention of C{oe}lius. We desire to do full justice to the  ancient work and complete the presentation of its history. The  controversies that have raged over it make this course necessary.    Our predecessors have not had the benefit of modern communication,  and, therefore, could not know all that is to be known on the subject.  We sympathize with Lister yet do not condemn Torinus. If Torinus ever  dared making important changes in the old text, they are easily  ascertained by collation with other texts. This we have endeavored to  do. Explaining the discrepancies, it will be noted that we have not  given a full vote of confidence to Lister.    Why should the mysterious C{oe}lius or Caelius, if such an author or  compiler of a tome on cookery existed affix the name of \"Apicius\" to  it? The reason would be commercial gain, prestige accruing from the  name of that cookery celebrity. Such business sense would not be  extraordinary. Modern cooks pursue the same method. Witness the  innumerable a la soandsos. Babies, apartment houses, streets, cities,  parks, dogs, race horses, soap, cheese, herring, cigars, hair  restorers are thus named today. \"Apicius\" on the front page of any  ancient cookery book would be perfectly consistent with the ancient  spirit of advertising. It has been stated, too, that C{oe}lius had  more than one collaborator. Neither can this be proven.    The copyists have made many changes throughout the original text.  Misspelling of terms, ignorance of cookery have done much to obscure  the meaning. The scribes of the middle ages had much difficulty in  this respect since medieval Latin is different from Apician language.    The very language of the original is proof for its authenticity. The  desire of Torinus to interpret to his medieval readers the ancient  text is pardonable. How much or how little he succeeded is attested to  by some of his contemporary readers, former owners of our copies.  Scholars plainly confess inability to decipher Apicius by groans  inscribed on the fly leaves and title pages in Latin, French and other  languages. One French scholar of the 16th century, apparently \"kidded\"  for studying an undecipherable cook book, stoically inscribes the  title page of our Lyon, 1541, copy with: \"This amuses me. Why make fun  of me?\" This sort of message, reaching us out of the dim past of  bygone centuries is among the most touching reading we have done, and  has urged us on with the good though laborious and unprofitable work.    Notwithstanding its drawbacks, our book is a classic both as to form  and contents. It has served as a prototype of most ancient and modern  books. Its influence is felt to the present day.    The book has often been cited by old writers as proof of the  debaucheries and the gluttony of ancient Rome. Nothing could be  further from the truth because these writers failed to understand the  book.    The Apicius book reflects the true condition (partly so, because it is  incomplete) of the kitchen prevailing at the beginning of our era when  the mistress of the Old World was in her full regalia, when her ample  body had not yet succumbed to that fatty degeneration of the interior  so fatal to ever so many individuals, families, cities and nations.    We repeat, our Apicius covers Rome's healthy epoch; hence the  importance of the book. The voluptuous concoctions, the fabulous  dishes, the proverbial excesses that have made decent people shudder  with disgust throughout the ages are not known to Apicius. If they  ever existed at all in their traditional ugliness they made their  appearance after Apicius' time. We recall, Petronius, describing some  of these \"stunts\" is a contemporary of Nero (whom he satirizes as  \"Trimalchio\"). So is Seneca, noble soul, another victim of Caesarean  insanity; he, too, describes Imperial excesses. These extremely few  foolish creations are really at the bottom of the cause for this  misunderstanding of true Roman life. Such stupidity has allowed the  joy of life which, as Epikuros and Platina believe, may be indulged in  with perfect virtue and honesty to become a byword among all good  people who are not gastronomers either by birth, by choice or by  training.    With due justice to the Roman people may we be permitted to say that  proverbial excesses were exceedingly rare occurrences. The follies and  the vices of a Nero, a boy Heliogabalus, a Pollio, a Vitellius and a  few other notorious wasters are spread sporadically over a period of  at least eight hundred years. Between these cases of gastronomic  insanity lie wellnigh a thousand years of everyday grind and drudgery  of the Roman people. The bulk was miserably fed as compared with  modern standards of living. Only a few patricians could afford \"high  living.\" Since a prosperous bourgeoisie (usually the economic and  gastronomic background of any nation) was practically unknown in Rome,  where the so-called middle classes were in reality poor, shiftless and  floating freedmen, it is evident that the bulk of the population  because of the empire's unsettled economic conditions, its extensive  system of slavery (precluding all successful practice of trades by  freemen), the continuous military operations, the haphazard financial  system, was forced to live niggardly. The contrast between the middle  classes and the upper classes seemed very cruel. This condition may  account for the many outcries against the \"extravagances\" of the few  privileged ones who could afford decent food and for the exaggerated  stories about their table found in the literature of the time.    The seemingly outlandish methods of Apician food preparation become  plain and clear in the light of social evolution. \"Evolution\" is  perhaps not the right word to convey our idea of social perpetual  motion.    Apicius used practically all the cooking utensils in use today. He  only lacked gas, electricity and artificial refrigeration, modern  achievements while useful in the kitchen and indispensable in  wholesale production and for labor saving, that have no bearing on  purely gastronomical problems. There is only one difference between  the cooking utensils of yore and the modern products: the old ones are  hand-made, more individualistic, more beautiful, more artistic than  our machine-made varieties.    Despite his strangeness and remoteness, Apicius is not dead by any  means. We have but to inspect (as Gollmer has pointed out) the table  of the Southern Europeans to find Apician traditions alive. In the  Northern countries, too, are found his traces. To think that Apicius  should have survived in the North of Europe, far removed from his  native soil, is a rather audacious suggestion. But the keen observer  can find him in Great Britain, Scandinavia and the Baltic provinces  today. The conquerors and seafarers coming from the South have carried  the pollen of gastronomic flowers far into the North where they  adjusted themselves to soil and climate. Many a cook of the British  isles, of Southern Sweden, Holstein, Denmark, Friesland, Pomerania  still observes Apicius rules though he may not be aware of the fact.    We must realize that Apicius is only a book, a frail hand-made record  and that, while the record itself might have been forgotten, its  principles have become international property, long ago. Thus they  live on. Like a living thing--a language, a custom, they themselves  may have undergone changes, \"improvements,\" alterations, augmentation,  corruption. But the character has been preserved; a couple of thousand  years are, after all, but a paltry matter. Our own age is but the  grandchild of antiquity. The words we utter, in their roots, are those  of our grandfathers. And so do many dishes we eat today resemble those  once enjoyed by Apicius and his friends.    Is it necessary to point the tenacity of the spirit of the Antique,  reaching deep into the modern age? The latest Apicius edition in the  original Latin is dated 1922!    The gastronomic life of Europe was under the complete rule of old Rome  until the middle of the seventeenth century. Then came a sudden change  for modernity, comparable to the rather abrupt change of languages  from the fashionable Latin to the national idioms and vernacular, in  England and Germany under the influence of literary giants like  Luther, Chaucer, Shakespeare.    All medieval food literature of the continent and indeed the early  cookery books of England prior to La Varenne (Le Cuisinier Francois,  1654) are deeply influenced by Apicius. The great change in eating,  resulting in a new gastronomic order, attained its highest peak of  perfection just prior to the French revolution. Temporarily suspended  by this social upheaval, it continued to flourish until about the  latter part"]]]
