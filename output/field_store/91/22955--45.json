With this one and  only prop, the animal's body juts out stiffly, at full length, with  legs folded. It forms a right angle with the supporting axis, so much  so that the whole weight of the insect, which has turned itself into  the arm of a lever rests upon the mandibles.    The Ammophila sleeps extended in space by virtue of her mighty jaws. It  takes an animal to think of a thing like that, which upsets all our  preconceived ideas of repose. Should the threatening storm burst,  should the stalk sway in the wind, the sleeper is not troubled by her  swinging hammock; at most, she presses her fore-legs for a moment  against the tossed mast. As soon as equilibrium is restored, the  favourite posture, that of the horizontal lever, is resumed, perhaps  the mandibles, like the bird's toes, possess the faculty of gripping  tighter in proportion to the rocking of the wind.    The Ammophila is not the only one to sleep in this singular position,  which is copied by many others--Anthidia (Cotton-bees.--Translator's  Note.), Odyneri (A genus of Mason-wasps.--Translator's Note.), Eucerae  (A species of Burrowing-bees.--Translator's Note.)--and mainly by the  males. All grip a stalk with their mandibles and sleep with their  bodies outstretched and their legs folded back. Some, the stouter  species, allow themselves to rest the tip of their arched abdomen  against the pole.    This visit to the dormitory of certain Wasps and Bees does not explain  the problem of the Empusa; it sets up another one, no less difficult.  It shows us how deficient we are in insight, when it comes to  differentiating between fatigue and rest in the cogs of the animal  machine. The Ammophila, with the static paradox afforded by her  mandibles; the Empusa, with her claws unwearied by ten months' hanging,  leave the physiologist perplexed and make him wonder what really  constitutes rest. In absolute fact, there is no rest, apart from that  which puts an end to life. The struggle never ceases; some muscle is  always toiling, some nerve straining. Sleep, which resembles a return  to the peace of non-existence, is, like waking, an effort, here of the  leg, of the curled tail; there of the claw, of the jaws.    The transformation is effected about the middle of May, and the adult  Empusa makes her appearance. She is even more remarkable in figure and  attire than the Praying Mantis. Of her youthful eccentricities, she  retains the pointed mitre, the saw-like arm-guards, the long bust, the  knee-pieces, the three rows of scales on the lower surface of the  belly; but the abdomen is now no longer twisted into a crook and the  animal is comelier to look upon. Large pale-green wings, pink at the  shoulder and swift in flight in both sexes, cover the belly, which is  striped white and green underneath. The male, the dandy sex, adorns  himself with plumed antennae, like those of certain Moths, the Bombyx  tribe. In respect of size, he is almost the equal of his mate.    Save for a few slight structural details, the Empusa is the Praying  Mantis. The peasant confuses them. When, in spring, he meets the mitred  insect, he thinks he sees the common Prego-Dieu, who is a daughter of  the autumn. Similar forms would seem to indicate similarity of habits.  In fact, led away by the extraordinary armour, we should be tempted to  attribute to the Empusa a mode of life even more atrocious than that of  the Mantis. I myself thought so at first; and any one, relying upon  false analogies, would think the same. It is a fresh error: for all her  warlike aspect, the Empusa is a peaceful creature that hardly repays  the trouble of rearing.    Installed under the gauze bell, whether in assemblies of half a dozen  or in separate couples, she at no time loses her placidity. Like the  larva, she is very abstemious and contents herself with a Fly or two as  her daily ration.    Big eaters are naturally quarrelsome. The Mantis, bloated with Locusts,  soon becomes irritated and shows fight. The Empusa, with her frugal  meals, does not indulge in hostile demonstrations. There is no strife  among neighbours nor any of those sudden unfurlings of the wings so  dear to the Mantis when she assumes the spectral attitude and puffs  like a startled Adder; never the least inclination for those cannibal  banquets whereat the sister who has been worsted in the fight is  devoured. Such atrocities or here unknown.    Unknown also are tragic nuptials. The male is enterprising and  assiduous and is subjected to a long trial before succeeding. For days  and days he worries his mate, who ends by yielding. Due decorum is  preserved after the wedding. The feathered groom retires, respected by  his bride, and does his little bit of hunting, without danger of being  apprehended and gobbled up.    The two sexes live together in peace and mutual indifference until the  middle of July. Then the male, grown old and decrepit, takes counsel  with himself, hunts no more, becomes shaky in his walk, creeps down  from the lofty heights of the trellised dome and at last collapses on  the ground. His end comes by a natural death. And remember that the  other, the male of the Praying Mantis, ends in the stomach of his  gluttonous spouse.    The laying follows close upon the disappearance of the males.    One word more on comparative manners. The Mantis goes in for battle and  cannibalism; the Empusa is peaceable and respects her kind. To what  cause are these profound moral differences due, when the organic  structure is the same? Perhaps to the difference of diet. Frugality, in  fact, softens character, in animals as in men; gross feeding brutalizes  it. The gormandizer gorged with meat and strong drink, a fruitful  source of savage outbursts, could not possess the gentleness of the  ascetic who dips his bread into a cup of milk. The Mantis is that  gormandizer, the Empusa that ascetic.    Granted. But whence does the one derive her voracious appetite, the  other her temperate ways, when it would seem as though their almost  identical structure ought to produce an identity of needs? These  insects tell us, in their fashion, what many have already told us: that  propensities and aptitudes do not depend exclusively upon anatomy; high  above the physical laws that govern matter rise other laws that govern  instincts.        CHAPTER 4. THE CAPRICORN.    My youthful meditations owe some happy moments to Condillac's famous  statue which, when endowed with the sense of smell, inhales the scent  of a rose and out of that single impression creates a whole world of  ideas. (Etienne Bonnot de Condillac, Abbe de Mureaux (1715-80), the  leading exponent of sensational philosophy. His most important work is  the \"Traite des sensations,\" in which he imagines a statue, organized  like a man, and endows it with the senses one by one, beginning with  that of smell. He argues by a process of imaginative reconstruction  that all human faculties and all human knowledge are merely transformed  sensation, to the exclusion of any other principle, that, in short,  everything has its source in sensation: man is nothing but what he has  acquired.--Translator's Note.) My twenty-year-old mind, full of faith  in syllogisms, loved to follow the deductive jugglery of the  abbe-philosopher: I saw, or seemed to see, the statue take life in that  action of the nostrils, acquiring attention, memory, judgment and all  the psychological paraphernalia, even as still waters are aroused and  rippled by the impact of a grain of sand. I recovered from my illusion  under the instruction of my abler master, the animal. The Capricorn  shall teach us that the problem is more obscure than the abbe led me to  believe.    When wedge and mallet are at work, preparing my provision of firewood  under the grey sky that heralds winter, a favourite relaxation creates  a welcome break in my daily output of prose. By my express orders, the  woodman has selected the oldest and most ravaged trunks in his stack.  My tastes bring a smile to his lips; he wonders by what whimsy I prefer  wood that is worm-eaten--chirouna, as he calls it--to sound wood which  burns so much better. I have my views on the subject; and the worthy  man submits to them.    And now to us two, O my fine oak-trunk seamed with scars, gashed with  wounds whence trickle the brown drops smelling of the tan-yard. The  mallet drives home, the wedges bite, the wood splits. What do your  flanks contain? Real treasures for my studies. In the dry and hollow  parts, groups of various insects, capable of living through the bad  season of the year, have taken up their winter quarters: in the  low-roofed galleries, galleries which some Buprestis-beetle has built,  Osmia-bees, working their paste of masticated leaves, have piled their  cells, one above the other; in the deserted chambers and vestibules,  Megachiles (Leaf-cutting Bees.--Translator's Note.) have arranged their  leafy jars; in the live wood, filled with juicy saps, the larvae of the  Capricorn (Cerambyx miles), the chief author of the oak's undoing, have  set up their home.    Strange creatures, of a verity, are these grubs, for an insect of  superior organization: bits of intestines crawling about! At this time  of year, the middle of autumn, I meet them of two different ages. The  older are almost as thick as one's finger; the others hardly attain the  diameter of a pencil. I find, in addition, pupae more or less fully  coloured, perfect insects, with a distended abdomen, ready to leave the  trunk when the hot weather comes again. Life inside the wood,  therefore, lasts three years. How is this long period of solitude and  captivity spent? In wandering lazily through the thickness of the oak,  in making roads whose rubbish serves as food. The horse in Job swallows  the ground in a figure of speech; the Capricorn's grub literally eats  its way. (\"Chafing and raging, he swalloweth the ground, neither doth  he make account when the noise of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37566"],[0,"Natural History of the Ornate Box Turtle, Terrapene ornata ornata Agassiz (#7)"],[1,"in some females obtained in September. Atretic  follicles, ordinarily orange, brown, or purplish, were observed on the  ovaries of many of the females examined; in most instances, not more  than two follicles of the small or medium size groups were atretic.  Atresia was in no instance great enough to account for the complete  loss of enlarged follicles.    Further study probably will show that many of the females laying in  May and early June lay again before the end of July, and that eggs in  the oviducts of females captured in the latter month frequently  represent second clutches. Under favorable conditions, eggs laid by  the end of July would have a good chance of hatching before the advent  of cold weather in autumn; turtles hatching too late to escape from  the nest could burrow into its sides and probably escape freezing  temperatures.    Cagle's findings concerning _Pseudemys scripta_ (1950:38) and  _Chrysemys picta_ (1954:228-9) suggest that these species lay more  than one clutch per season, at least in the southern parts of their  ranges. Carr (1952) indicated that multiple layings were known in most  species of marine turtles (families Dermochelydae and Chelonidae) and  strongly suspected in other species. Other turtles recorded to have  produced multiple clutches in a single season (based chiefly on  captive specimens or cultured populations) include: the starred  tortoise, _Geochelone elegans_ (Deraniyagala, 1939:287); the Asiatic  trionychid, _Lissemys punctata_ (_op. cit._:304); the diamond-backed  terrapin, _Malaclemys terrapin_ (Hildebrand and Prytherch, 1947:2);  and the Japanese soft-shelled turtle, _Trionyx japonicus_ (Mitsukuri,  1895, cited by Cagle, 1950:38).    There is a marked alternation of ovarian activity in _T. ornata_, one  ovary being more active than its partner in a given season. The less  active ovary is more active than its partner in the following season.  For example, a specimen killed in July had four corpora lutea on the  right ovary and two on the left and there were five enlarged follicles  (of the medium size group), representing the next set of eggs to be  ovulated, four on the left ovary and one on the right. Similar  alternation of ovarian activity was observed, to a greater or lesser  extent, in nearly all of the females examined. Many subadult females  that were approaching their first breeding season (as evidenced by the  presence of large ovarian follicles but no indication of former  ovulation) had but one active ovary. This may account in part for the  tendency of small, young females to lay clutches smaller than average.  One ovary may become senile in old females before its partner does;  this may explain the occasional absence or atrophy of one ovary in  large females that I have examined.    In all the specimens examined, it was evident that ovulation had  occurred or would occur in two successive seasons. Senile or young  females might, however, be expected to skip a laying season if only  one ovary was functioning.    After ovulation, the collapsed follicle assumes a cuplike shape and  becomes a glandular corpus luteum (Pl. 20, Fig. 2). Corpora lutea are  approximately eight millimeters in diameter and are easily discernible  at least until the eggs are laid; they are somewhat less distinct  after preservation. Corpora lutea undergo rapid involution following  oviposition and, after two to three weeks, are little more than small  puckerings on the ovarian epithelium. At this stage they are properly  referred to as corpora albicantia and are discernible only after  careful examination of the ovary under low magnification. Corpora  albicantia remain on the ovary until April of the year following  ovulation but disappear in May and are never present after the new set  of eggs is ovulated. Ovaries of some subadults (that would have laid  first in the season following capture) contained enlarged follicles  and, but for their lack of corpora lutea and corpora albicantia, were  indistinguishable from those of older, fully mature females.    Altland (1951:605-610) gave a histological description of the corpus  luteum of _Terrapene carolina_. Corpora lutea were glandular and  filled with lipoidal material until the eggs were laid. Atresia of  corpora lutea began when eggs were laid, was completed by mid-August,  and was coincident with atresia of large follicles that did not  undergo ovulation. Altland did not describe the gross external  appearance of the corpus albicans.    The corpus luteum of oviparous reptiles seems to be closely associated  with the intrauterine life of the eggs and, in viviparous reptiles, it  may be an important factor in maintaining optimum gestational  environment; however, its functions in all reptiles are poorly  understood (Miller, 1948:200-201).    Information gleaned from records of gravid females and known dates of  nesting suggests that eggs are retained in the oviducts two to three  weeks before laying. Once they are ovulated, the eggs are exposed to  but few hazards until laid; counts of corpora lutea are an accurate  indication of the number of eggs laid. In the gravid females examined  by me, number of corpora lutea on the ovaries was equal, in all but  one instance, to the number of oviducal eggs. In the single instance  in which an extra corpus luteum was found, one egg had probably been  laid before the specimen was captured. The high incidence of  correspondence between counts of corpora lutea and counts of oviducal  eggs indicates also that _T. ornata_ deposits the entire complement of  oviducal eggs at one time, not singly or in smaller groups.    Extrauterine migration of ova, whereby eggs from one ovary pass into  the oviduct of the opposite side, is of common occurrence in _T.  ornata_ and is known to occur also in _T. carolina_, _Chrysemys  picta_, _Emydoidea blandingi_, _Pseudemys scripta_, _Cnemidophorus  sexlineatus_, and in several mammals (Legler, 1958). This ovular  migration may serve to redistribute eggs to the oviducts when the  ovaries are functioning at unequal rates.    The eggs acquire shells soon after they enter the oviducts. No  shell-less eggs were found in oviducts but several specimens of _T.  ornata_ had oviducal eggs, the thin, parchmentlike shells of which  lacked the outer calceous layer; in these specimens the corpora lutea  were fresh, probably not more than two days old. Eggs that had  remained in the oviducts longer had a calceous layer on the outside of  the shell. Eggs having incompletely developed shells were successfully  incubated in the laboratory. Cagle (1950:38) found shelled but  yolkless eggs in the oviducts of several _Pseudemys scripta_ but found  no yolkless eggs in nests. No yolkless eggs were found in specimens of  _T. ornata_ in the course of the present study.    The uterine portion of the oviducts becomes darkened (pale gray to  intense black) in the breeding season. Darkening of oviducts seemed to  coincide with the period when eggs were in the oviducts and it  persisted for a variable length of time after the eggs were laid.  Oviducts of immature females were ordinarily pale.      Nesting    Ornate box turtles nest chiefly in June. Some females nest as early as  the first week of May or as late as mid-July but the nesting season  reaches its peak in mid-June. Eggs nearly ready to be laid were in  oviducts (determined by bimanual palpation in the field or by  dissection in the laboratory) of many females captured in June; nearly  half of the records so obtained were in the second week of that month.  Early records of shelled oviducal eggs were April 25 (specimen from  Ottawa County, Oklahoma), May 5, and May 22. The two latest records  are for females retaining oviducal eggs on July 2 and 11. Known dates  for nesting of free-living females were distributed rather evenly  through the month of June. It is worthy of note that all (four) of  the nestings known to occur in July were by captive females. Females  of _T. ornata_, like those of some other turtles (Cagle and Tihen,  1948; Risley, 1933:694), seem to retain their eggs until conditions  are suitable for nesting. Most of the reports in the literature of  nesting after mid-July represent records for captive females.    Nests of _T. o. ornata_ were so well-concealed that they were  difficult to find even when a gravid female had been followed to the  approximate location by means of a trailing thread. Females spend one  to several days seeking a site for the nest, usually traveling a  circuitous route within a restricted area. Movements of nest-seeking  females were more extensive than those of males and non-gravid females  observed in the same periods.    Activities of one gravid female, typical in most respects of the  activities of several other gravid females observed (for periods of  one to 23 days) at the Damm Farm, illustrate pre-nesting behavior  (Fig. 29). A trailer was attached to the female on the morning of June  7. She was recovered early on the following afternoon; her movements  in the elapsed period had been restricted to a small, deep, ravine 150  feet long and 20 to 30 feet wide. She had traversed each edge of the  ravine at least once and had crossed it six or seven times, keeping  mostly to areas on the upper parts of south--or west--facing slopes  where vegetation was sparse or lacking. In six places she had dug into  the ground, probably to test the suitability of the soil for nesting.  In three places she dug beneath rocks that jutted out from the bank,  and in two places merely scratched away the upper crust of soil. Her  most recent attempt at digging (probably late the previous evening or  in early morning on the day of her capture) consisted of a  flask-shaped cavity that, but for the lack of eggs and a covering of  earth, was like a completed nest (Pl. 21, Fig. 1). The cavity was 55  millimeters deep, 80 millimeters wide at the bottom, and 60  millimeters wide at the opening. For"]]]
