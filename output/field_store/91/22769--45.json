The woman, in paddling these awkward tubs,  stands in the bow, and makes the stroke with the paddle, by reaching it  forward in the water, and drawing it to her, by which means she pulls  the canoe along with considerable speed. These very curious and  rudely-constructed canoes are made in the form of the Welsh coracle;  and, if I mistake not, propelled in the same manner, which is a very  curious circumstance; inasmuch as they are found in the heart of the  great wilderness of America, where all the surrounding tribes construct  their canoes in decidedly different forms, and of different materials.\"    [Illustration: Skin Canoes of the Mandan Indians.]    It is generally agreed by travellers, that the flesh of the Bison is  little inferior to the beef of our domestic oxen. The tongue is  considered a delicacy, and the hump is much esteemed. A kind of  potted-beef, called _pemmican_, is made of the flesh of the Bison, in  the following manner:--The flesh is spread on a skin, dried in the sun,  and pounded with stones; then all the hair is carefully sifted out of  it, and melted fat kneeded into it. This, when properly made and kept  dry, will keep good for twelve months. The tallow of the Bison forms an  important article of commerce; one fat bull yielding sometimes as much  as 150 pounds weight.    Mr. Turner, a gentleman long resident in America, is of opinion, that  the Bison is superior even to our domestic cattle for the purposes of  husbandry, and has expressed a wish to see this animal domesticated on  the English farms. He informs us, that a farmer on the great Kenhawa  broke a young Bison to the plough; and having yoked it with a steer,  taken from his tame cattle, it performed its work to admiration. But  there is another property in which the Bison far surpasses the Ox, and  this is his strength. \"Judging from the extraordinary size of his bones,  and the depth and formation of the chest, (continues this gentleman,) I  should not think it unreasonable to assign nearly a double portion of  strength to this powerful inhabitant of the forest. Reclaim him, and you  gain a capital quadruped, both for the draught and for the plough; his  activity peculiarly fits him for the latter, in preference to the ox.\"    As there are no Game Laws in America, (except in a very few confined  instances on the Atlantic border,) the consequence is that the Bison is  fast disappearing before the approach of the white settlers. At the  commencement of the eighteenth century these wild cattle were found in  large numbers all throughout the valley of the Ohio, of the Mississippi,  in Western New York, in Virginia, &c. In the beginning of the present  century they were still existing in the extreme western or southwestern  part of the State of New York. As late as 1812 they were natives of  Ohio, and numerous in that State. And now they are not to be seen in  their native state in any part of the United States, east of the  Mississippi River; nor are they now to be found in any considerable  numbers west of that great river, until you have travelled some eighty  or a hundred miles into the interior of the country.    There were no Bisons west of the Rocky Mountains, when Lewis and Clarke  travelled there in 1805. On their return from the Columbia, or Oregon  River, in July of that year, the first Bison they saw was on the day  after they commenced their descent of the Rocky Mountains towards the  east. On the second day after that, they saw immense herds of them on  the banks of the Medicine River. One collection of these animals which  they subsequently saw, on the borders of the Missouri River, they  estimated as being at least 20,000 in number.    In 1823 it was discovered that the Bisons had crossed the Rocky  Mountains, and some were to be seen in the vallies to the west of that  range.    East of that range of mountains, these animals migrate from the uplands  or mountains to the plains, and from north to south, about the beginning  of November; and return from the south to the north, and from the plains  to the uplands, soon after the disappearance of the snow in the spring.    The herds of Bisons wander over the country in search of food, usually  led by a bull remarkable for strength and fierceness. While feeding,  they are often scattered over a great extent of country; but when they  move, they form a dense and almost impenetrable column, which, when once  in motion, is scarcely to be impeded. Their line of march is seldom  interrupted, even by considerable rivers, across which they swim,  without fear or hesitation, nearly in the order in which they traverse  the plains. The Bisons which frequent the woody parts of the country  form smaller herds than those which roam over the plains, but are said  to be individually of a greater size.    The rutting takes place the latter part of July and the beginning of  August, after which the cows separate from the bulls in distinct herds.  They bring forth their young in April: from which it appears that the  term of gestation is about nine months.    The pair of American Bisons in the Zoological Gardens produced a calf in  1849; from the observations made in that instance, the period of  gestation was calculated at 270 days.    The most important anatomical difference between the American and the  European is, that the American has fifteen pairs of ribs, whereas the  European has but fourteen.    The following are the dimensions of a large specimen:--                                                        Ft. In.  From the nose to the insertion of the tail           8   6  Height at the shoulder                               6   0    \"         at the croup                             5   0  Length of the head                                   2   1    Their weights vary from 1200 to 2000 pounds.    [Illustration: Head of young male Bison.]          THE AUROCHS, OR EUROPEAN BISON.    _Bos Bison._      [Illustration]    In this, as in the American species, the head is very broad, and the  forehead arched; but the horns are longer, more curved, and end in a  finer point than those of the American Bison. The eyes are large and  dark; the hair on the forehead is long and wavy; under the chin and on  the breast it forms a sort of beard. In winter, the whole of the neck,  hump, and shoulders are covered with a long woolly hair of a dusky brown  colour, intermingled with a short soft fur of a fawn colour. The long  hair is gradually cast in the summer, to be again renewed as the  inclemency of winter comes on. The legs, back, and posterior portions  are covered with short, dark brown hair. The tail is of a moderate  length, is covered with hair, and terminates in a large tuft.    The females are not so large as the males, neither are they  characterised by that abundance of hair on the anterior parts, which is  so conspicuous in the bulls.    These animals have never been domesticated, although calves have  sometimes been caught, and confined in an enclosed pasture. An instance  of this kind is recorded by Mr. Gilibert, who, while in Poland, had the  opportunity of observing the character of four young ones thus reared in  captivity. They were suckled by a she-goat, obstinately refusing to  touch a common cow. This antipathy to the domestic cow, which they  manifested so early, maintained its strength as they advanced in years;  their anger was sure to be excited at the appearance of any domestic  cattle, which, whenever introduced to them, they vigorously expelled  from their pasture. They were, however, sufficiently tame to acknowledge  the voice of their keeper.    The geographical range of this animal is now comparatively very limited,  being confined to the forests of Lithuania, Moldavia, Wallachia, and  some of the Caucasian mountain forests; yet there can be no doubt that,  at an early period, they roamed at large over a great part of both  Europe and Asia.    Although they have never been, strictly speaking, domesticated, yet  herds of them are kept in certain localities in the forest of  Bialowieza, under the special protection of the Emperor of Russia, and  under the immediate superintendence of twelve herdsmen, each herdsman  keeping the number allotted to his charge in a particular department of  the forest, near some river or stream. The estimated number of the  twelve herds is about 800.    They feed on grass and brushwood; also on the leaves and bark of young  trees, particularly the willow, poplar, ash, and birch. In autumn they  likewise browse on heath, and the lichens which cover the bark of trees.  In winter, when the ground is covered with snow, fodder is provided for  them.    Their cry is quite peculiar, resembling a groan, or a grunt, more than  the lowing of an ox.    They do not attain their full stature until after the sixth year, and  live till between thirty and forty.    \"The strength of the Zubr,\" says Dr. Weissenborn, \"is enormous; and  trees of five or six inches diameter cannot withstand the thrusts of old  bulls. It is neither afraid of wolf nor bear, and assails its enemies  both with its horns and hoofs. An old Zubr is a match for four wolves;  packs of the latter animal, however, sometimes hunt down even old bulls  when alone; but a herd of Zubrs has nothing to fear from any rapacious  animal.    \"Notwithstanding the great bulk of its body, the Zubr can run very  swiftly. In galloping, its hoofs are raised above its head, which it  carries very low. The animal has, however, but little bottom, and seldom  runs farther than one or two English miles. It swims well, and is very  fond of bathing.
