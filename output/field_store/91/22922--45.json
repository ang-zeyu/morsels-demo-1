[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35413"],[0,"A Review of the Middle American Tree Frogs of the Genus Ptychohyla (#7)"],[1,"of feet grayish tan;  ventrolateral glands pinkish tan; anterior one-half of chin flecked  with brown.    In life the dorsum was pale tan (Pinkish Buff); the dark markings on  dorsum dull brown (Tawny-Olive); tarsi pale tan (Pale Pinkish Buff);  flanks pinkish tan (Pale Cinnamon-Pink); iris coppery bronze (Capucine  Orange).    _Variation._--The few specimens from a limited geographic region  preclude any analysis of geographic variation. All specimens, except  the one described above, have the fifth toe webbed to the base of the  disc. Many individuals have a bifid subarticular tubercle beneath the  fourth finger. The shape of the posterior edge of the tongue varies  from nearly straight and shallowly notched to bluntly rounded and  emarginate. Two females (KU 58050-1) have more pointed snouts in  dorsal profile than do males.    Some specimens, such as KU 58048, are notably darker than the specimen  described above; in dark specimens the dorsum is brown with dark brown  markings; all fingers and the webbing on the hand are brown. The tarsi  and feet are like those in the specimen described above, but the  posterior surfaces of the thighs are yellowish tan heavily suffused  with brown; the venter is cream color. In life KU 58048 had a brown  (Verona Brown) dorsum with dark brown (Chocolate) markings. KU 58047  is slightly darker than KU 58048 and has scattered small white flecks  on the dorsum. All specimens have the thin white line on the upper  lip, but in some individuals it is indistinct. The grayish white line  above the anus is present in all specimens.    _Description of Tadpole._--The following description is based on KU  60049 from Rio Hondo, 9.5 kilometers south of Pueblo Nuevo  Solistahuacan, Chiapas, Mexico (Figs. 4B and 6B). No limb buds; total  length, 36.2 mm.; body length, 11.1 mm.; body length/total length,  30.6 per cent. Body moderately depressed, slightly wider than deep,  ovoid in dorsal profile; mouth directed ventrally; eyes small,  directed dorsolaterally; nostrils slightly protuberant and directed  anteriorly, somewhat closer to eye than snout; spiracle sinistral and  posteroventrad to eye; anal tube dextral. Caudal fin low, acutely  rounded posteriorly; depth of caudal musculature slightly more than  one-half greatest depth of caudal fin; caudal musculature extending  nearly to tip of tail.    Mouth large; lips having deep lateral folds; two complete rows of  papillae on lips; five or six rows of papillae laterally. Beaks  moderately developed, bearing small peglike serrations; moderately  wide lateral projections on upper beak; tooth-rows 4/6; upper rows  subequal in length; fourth row interrupted medially; length of lower  rows 1-4 subequal to upper rows; fifth and sixth lower rows decreasing  in length; first lower row interrupted medially.    Body brown above; tip of snout cream color; venter creamy white;  caudal musculature creamy tan; caudal fin transparent; cream-colored  crescent-shaped mark on posterior edge of body and anterior part of  caudal musculature, bordered posterodorsally by dark brown blotch;  four dark brown blotches on dorsum of anterior part of caudal  musculature; scattered brown flecks on caudal musculature and fin; eye  silvery bronze in life.    _Variation._--The variation in size and proportions is given in Table  2. All specimens have 4/6 tooth-rows; in some the first lower row is  interrupted medially. Specimens from Jacaltenango and two kilometers  west of San Pedro Necta, Depto. Huehuetenango, Guatemala, have weakly  developed sixth lower tooth-rows.    The cream-colored crescent-shaped mark is distinct in all specimens;  the dorsal blotches on the anterior part of the caudal musculature are  narrow and do not extend far onto the sides of the tail. The blotches  are most distinct in small tadpoles and sometimes indistinct in large  ones.    _Comparisons._--_Ptychohyla euthysanota macrotympanum_ can be  distinguished from both _P. spinipollex_ and _P. leonhardschultzei_ by  the absence of bold black and white marbling on the flanks, as well as  by the characters given in the diagnosis; furthermore, from the former  it differs in having more and smaller horny nuptial tuberosities and  from the latter by having the snout, in lateral profile, rounded above  instead of angulate. _Ptychohyla euthysanota macrotympanum_ differs  from _P. e. euthysanota_ by normally having a paler dorsum, narrower  stripe on upper lip, and no distinct lateral stripe.    _Ptychohyla euthysanota macrotympanum_ occurs sympatrically with  _Plectrohyla guatemalensis_ and _P. matudai matudai_. Each of the last  two has a bony prepollex, rather rugose skin on the dorsum, and more  squat body. Other sympatric species are _Hyla walkeri_, which has a  green dorsum with brown markings and a rather pointed snout, and _Hyla  sumichrasti_, a small yellow frog usually lacking vomerine teeth.    _Life History._--This species breeds in clear mountain streams in  mixed pine and broad-leafed forest. Males call from trees and bushes  along the streams. The breeding call consists of a soft \"wraack,\"  repeated three to nine times with intervals of 2.7 to 3.4 seconds  between notes. Each note has a duration of 0.60 to 0.65 second, and a  rate of 92 to 100 pulses per second; the dominant frequency falls  between 3000 and 3200 cycles per second (Pl. 11B). The call is  indistinguishable from that of _P. e. euthysanota_.    Tadpoles in various stages of development were found in the Rio Hondo,  Chiapas, on June 16, 1960. The smallest tadpole has a total length of  24.1 mm.; in this individual the sixth lower tooth row has barely  started to develop. A metamorphosing frog taken at the same time has a  snout-vent length of 19.8 mm., a short remnant of the tail, and the  mouth and tongue developed, whereas another individual having a  snout-vent length of 17.8 mm. and a tail 31.0 mm. in length still has  larval teeth. Three completely metamorphosed juveniles collected by L.  C. Stuart at Jacaltenango, Guatemala, on June 6 and 7, 1955, have  snout-vent lengths of 16.0, 16.0, and 16.1 mm.    _Remarks._--Tanner (1957:52) based the description of _Hyla  macrotympanum_ on a single female, which, of course, lacked the  characters diagnostic of _Ptychohyla_. On the basis of general  external characters Tanner suggested that _Hyla macrotympanum_ was  related to _H. miotympanum_, from which it differed in having a larger  tympanum and a bifid subarticular tubercle beneath the fourth finger.  The collection of additional females, together with males of the  species, has shown that _Hyla macrotympanum_ is a _Ptychohyla_.    Intergradation between _Ptychohyla euthysanota_ and _P. macrotympanum_  has not been demonstrated. Currently their ranges are separated by the  dry valleys of the Rio Grijalva and Rio Cuilco. The similarity in  structure of the adults and tadpoles and the indistinguishable  breeding calls are the basis for considering the two populations  subspecies.    _Distribution._--This species occurs in mixed pine and broad-leafed  forests at elevations of 700 to 1700 meters on the southern slopes of  the Chiapan Highlands and Sierra de Cuchumatanes, in Guatemala. These  forests are on the south facing slopes north of the valleys of the Rio  Grijalva and Rio Cuilco.    _Specimens examined._--MEXICO: _Chiapas_: 6 km. NE of Chiapa de Corzo,  TCWC 16183; 16 km.
