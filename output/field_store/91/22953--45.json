That just  suited Cousin Glenwood, for he liked to spend money and show off what he  knew about the city; so he took Uncle Lovejoy 'most everywhere, and told  him to buy 'most everything he saw. And of course Uncle Silas did it,  because he wanted to surprise Aunt Melissy when he got back, and make  her feel happy for once in her life.    \"Cousin Glen took Uncle Lovejoy to the stores first, and then to a good  many different kinds of places afterward, and every place where there  was a mirror Uncle Lovejoy would stand before it and admire himself and  wonder what Aunt Melissy would say when he got home. He kept buying new  things every day, because every day he'd see somebody with something on  or carrying or leading something, and when he remembered what Aunt  Melissy said, he made up his mind he'd have to have all the things to  please her, and he got them as far as he could. Even Cousin Glenwood had  to commence buying things pretty soon to keep up, and before long people  used to stop on the street and look at them when they went by. Uncle  Silas didn't want to go home, either, when the time came, but of course  he had to, and he put on his best clothes for the trip, and took a young  man he'd hired to wait on him, and started.    [Illustration: PEOPLE USED TO STOP ON THE STREET AND LOOK AT THEM]    \"He didn't tell Aunt Melissy just what time he'd be there, so it was a  surprise sure enough. He walked right into the yard, and behind was the  young man he'd hired, carrying his things. Aunt Melissy was getting  dinner, and had just come to the door a minute to see what time it was  by the sun, when all of a sudden, as she looked up, there he was! He had  his hat in one hand and a cane in the other, and was leading a game  chicken by a string. All his boxes and bundles and the young man were  behind him. Uncle Lovejoy wore an eyeglass, too, and smoked a paper  thing he said was a cigarette. My little cousins, who were there, told  me afterward that their pa had never looked so fine in his life before  or since. They didn't know him at all, and neither did Aunt Melissy. She  thought he was somebody with something to sell at first, and when he  said, 'Aw, there, Melissah!' she threw up her hands and was about to  call for help, when just that minute she saw it was Uncle Silas.    [Illustration: HE WALKED RIGHT INTO THE YARD, AND BEHIND WAS THE YOUNG  MAN HE'D HIRED]    \"Poor Uncle Silas! He meant to surprise her, and he did it sure  enough. He meant to please her, though, and he didn't do that worth a  cent. It seemed funny, but she was mad. That's just the trouble about  women folks; you never know when you're going to please them. My little  cousins said they never saw their ma so mad before or since. She made  Uncle Lovejoy take off all his nice clothes, and the young man, too, and  she cooked the game chicken for dinner. Then, right after dinner, she  picked up a bag of shinney sticks that Uncle Lovejoy had brought home,  and she says to him and the young man:--    [Illustration: \"NOW YOU GET OUT IN THE GARDEN, BOTH OF YOU\"]    \"'Now you get out in the garden,' she says, 'both of you, and try to  earn back some of this money you've been spending.' And Uncle Lovejoy  didn't feel very much like it, but he went, and so did the young man. So  did Aunt Melissy, and she used up most of those shinney sticks on Uncle  Silas and the young man before fall, and Uncle Silas never saw any of  his nice clothes again, though they had the best garden they ever did  have, so my little cousins said.    \"And that,\" said Mr. 'Possum, leaning back in his chair to smoke,  \"that's why I've always been afraid to try family life. It's easier to  please one than two, especially when the other one is a spry, stirring  person like Aunt Melissy Lovejoy.\"    \"What became of all the good clothes?\" asked Jack Rabbit, who was always  very stylish.    \"Why, I've heard,\" said Mr. 'Possum, \"that Aunt Melissy made some of  them over for my little cousins, and that she traded off the rest of  them to a pedler for patent medicine to give Uncle Silas for a weak  mind, and I think he needed it some myself for trying to please her in  the first place.\"    Mr. Rabbit nodded.    \"It takes all kinds of people to make a world,\" he said.    Mr. 'Coon yawned and rubbed his eyes. The others were fast asleep.          AROUND THE WORLD AND BACK AGAIN      ONCE upon a time, when Mr. Dog was over spending the evening with the  Hollow Tree people, he told them that Mr. Man had said the world was  round, like a ball. Of course this was after Mr. Dog got to be good  friends with the 'Possum and the 'Coon and the Old Black Crow, and he  often used to come over to the Hollow Tree, where they lived, for a  quiet talk and smoke, and to tell the things that Mr. Man said and did,  and what he had on his table for dinner.    The Hollow Tree people liked to hear about Mr. Man, too; but when they  heard what he said about the world being round they thought there must  be some mistake in the way Mr. Dog had understood it. Mr. 'Coon said  that it couldn't be so, for the edge of the world was just beyond the  last trees of the Big Deep Woods, and that he'd often sat there and hung  his feet over and watched the moon come up. Mr. 'Possum said so, too;  and Mr. Crow said that the other edge was over along the Wide Blue  Water, where Mr. Turtle lived, and that of course the water was flat, as  everybody could see. Anyway, it would spill out if it wasn't.    But Mr. Dog stuck to it that Mr. Man had said just what Mr. Dog had said  he said, and that, what was more, Mr. Man had said that the world turned  over every day, and that the sun and moon and stars all went round it.  And Mr. Man had said, too, that people sometimes went around the world,  and didn't turn over or fall off into the sky when they were underneath,  but kept on, and came up on the other side, right back to the very  place they started from.    Well, that made them all wonder a good deal more than ever; and Mr. Jack  Rabbit, who came in just then for the evening, said he shouldn't be a  bit surprised if it were true, for he'd often noticed how the seasons  went round and round, and he thought, now, they must travel around the  world some way, too. He said he'd composed some poetry on Spring as he  came along, and that now he understood some lines of it better than he  had at the start; for, of course, when poetry just comes to anybody, as  it does to Mr. Rabbit, it isn't expected that even the poet himself will  understand it very well at first.    Then they all wanted to hear Jack Rabbit's poem, and Mr. Rabbit said  that it really wasn't just as he wanted it yet, but that if they  wouldn't expect too much, he'd let them hear how it went, anyway.      WHICH WAY, SPRING?    BY J. RABBIT                  O Spring,                Ho, Spring!          Whither do you go, Spring?          If I did but know, Spring,            I would go there, too.                Pray, Spring,                Say, Spring,          Whither and away, Spring?          I would start to-day, Spring,            If I go with you.    And Spring answers:--                  Why, sir,                I, sir,          Just go tripping by, sir--          If you did but try, sir,            You could go with me.                Follow,                Follow,          Over hill and hollow--          Where the bluebirds call, O,            I am sure to be.    Well, everybody applauded that, of course; and Mr. 'Coon said that for  his part he was tired of cold weather, and that if to-morrow was a  bright day, and anybody'd go with him, he'd start out at sunrise and  follow Spring clear around the world. Then Mr. 'Possum said he'd go just  to see whether Mr. Man was right or not, and Mr. Crow said he'd go, too.  Mr. Rabbit wanted to go to prove some things in his poem, but he had to  make a garden if it was a good day, and Mr. Dog had an engagement to dig  moles for Mr. Man.    So the next morning, bright and early, the three Hollow Tree people got  up and started. They packed some lunch in a basket, so they wouldn't get  hungry, in case they were gone all day, and set out in high spirits; for  it was a beautiful morning in April, and they knew Spring had come at  last.    They saw a bluebird up in a tree not far away, and they remembered what  Mr. Rabbit's poem had said about following him over hill and hollow; so  they went along in that direction, talking and whistling and singing,  because they felt so good in the fresh morning sunlight.    And Mr. Bluebird hopped and whistled and flew along ahead, until, by and  by, they came to where Mr. Fox lived.    \"Where are you fellows going so early?\" called Mr. Fox.    \"We're following Spring around the world,\" called back Mr. Crow; and  then they told him all that Mr. Dog had said.    Then Mr. Fox looked very wise, for he didn't know if Mr. Dog was playing  a trick on them, or if it were really true that the world was round and  he hadn't heard of it. Anyway, he wasn't going to let on, so he said:--    [Illustration: SET OUT IN HIGH SPIRITS]    \"Why, of course! I knew that all the time. You just keep right on until  you come to that big elm over yonder, and turn to the right. Anybody  over there can show you the way.\" Then Mr. Fox coughed and went back  into the house, but he made up his mind he wouldn't laugh until he had  seen Mr. Dog and was sure it was all a joke. And the Hollow Tree people  kept on to the elm tree, and, sure enough, there was Mr. Bluebird,  hopping and whistling and flying on ahead, for he'd been listening to  what Mr. Fox had told them.    So they hurried right along after him till they came to Mr. Wolf's  place. Mr. Wolf was looking out of his door as they came by.    \"Hello, you early birds!\" he called. \"Whose hen roost you been after?\"    Then they told him they weren't thinking of such things as that on a  beautiful morning "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37472"],[0,"Zanzibar Tales: Told (#7)"],[1,"certainly  know how to talk! Now, the fact of it is, I'm looking for some one  to insult me. I'm just aching to have some one pick a quarrel with  me. I'm impatient for a family alliance. Go on with your message.\"    Then Keejeepaa said, \"You don't bear any ill will against me, who am  only a messenger?\"    And the sultan said, \"None at all.\"    \"Well,\" said Keejeepaa, \"look at this pledge I bring;\" dropping the  diamond wrapped in leaves into the sultan's lap.    When the sultan opened the leaves and saw the great, sparkling jewel,  he was overcome with astonishment. At last he said, \"Well?\"    \"I have brought this pledge,\" said the gazelle, \"from my master,  Sultan Daaraa'ee. He has heard that you have a daughter, so he sent  you this jewel, hoping you will forgive him for not sending something  more worthy of your acceptance than this trifle.\"    \"Goodness!\" said the sultan to himself; \"he calls this a trifle!\" Then  to the gazelle: \"Oh, that's all right; that's all right. I'm  satisfied. The Sultan Daaraaee has my consent to marry my daughter,  and I don't want a single thing from him. Let him come empty-handed. If  he has more of these trifles, let him leave them at home. This is my  message, and I hope you will make it perfectly clear to your master.\"    The gazelle assured him that he would explain everything  satisfactorily, adding: \"And now, master, I take my leave. I go  straight to our own town, and hope that in about eleven days we shall  return to be your guests.\" So, with mutual compliments, they parted.    In the meantime, Haamdaanee was having an exceedingly tough  time. Keejeepaa having disappeared, he wandered about the town moaning,  \"Oh, my poor gazelle! my poor gazelle!\" while the neighbors laughed  and jeered at him, until, between them and his loss, he was nearly  out of his mind.    But one evening, when he had gone to bed, Keejeepaa walked in. Up  he jumped, and began to embrace the gazelle, and weep over it, and  carry on at a great rate.    When he thought there had been about enough of this kind of thing,  the gazelle said: \"Come, come; keep quiet, my master. I've brought  you good news.\" But the beggar man continued to cry and fondle,  and declare that he had thought his gazelle was dead.    At last Keejeepaa said: \"Oh, well, master, you see I'm all right. You  must brace up, and prepare to hear my news, and do as I advise you.\"    \"Go on; go on,\" replied his master; \"explain what you will, I'll  do whatever you require me to do. If you were to say, 'Lie down on  your back, that I may roll you over the side of the hill,' I would  lie down.\"    \"Well,\" said the gazelle, \"there is not much to explain just now,  but I'll tell you this: I've seen many kinds of food, food that is  desirable and food that is objectionable, but this food I'm about to  offer you is very sweet indeed.\"    \"What?\" said Haamdaanee. \"Is it possible that in this world there  is anything that is positively good? There must be good and bad in  everything. Food that is both sweet and bitter is good food, but if  food were nothing but sweetness would it not be injurious?\"    \"H'm!\" yawned the gazelle; \"I'm too tired to talk philosophy. Let's  go to sleep now, and when I call you in the morning, all you have to  do is to get up and follow me.\"    So at dawn they set forth, the gazelle leading the way, and for five  days they journeyed through the forest.    On the fifth day they came to a stream, and Keejeepaa said to his  master, \"Lie down here.\" When he had done so, the gazelle set to and  beat him so soundly that he cried out: \"Oh, let up, I beg of you!\"    \"Now,\" said the gazelle, \"I'm going away, and when I return I  expect to find you right here; so don't you leave this spot on any  account.\" Then he ran away, and about ten o'clock that morning he  arrived at the house of the sultan.    Now, ever since the day Keejeepaa left the town, soldiers had been  placed along the road to watch for and announce the approach of Sultan  Daaraaee; so one of them, when he saw the gazelle in the distance,  rushed up and cried to the sultan, \"Sultan Daaraaee is coming! I've  seen the gazelle running as fast as it can in this direction.\"    The sultan and his attendants immediately set out to meet his guests;  but when they had gone a little way beyond the town they met the  gazelle coming along alone, who, on reaching the sultan, said,  \"Good day, my master.\" The sultan replied in kind, and asked the  news, but Keejeepaa said: \"Ah, do not ask me. I can scarcely walk,  and my news is bad!\"    \"Why, how is that?\" asked the sultan.    \"Oh, dear!\" sighed the gazelle; \"such misfortune and misery! You see,  Sultan Daaraaee and I started alone to come here, and we got along  all right until we came to the thick part of the forest yonder, when  we were met by robbers, who seized my master, bound him, beat him,  and took everything he had, even stripping off every stitch of his  clothing. Oh, dear! oh, dear!\"    \"Dear me!\" said the sultan; \"we must attend to this at once.\" So,  hurrying back with his attendants to his house, he called a groom,  to whom he said, \"Saddle the best horse in my stable, and put on him  my finest harness.\" Then he directed a woman servant to open the  big inlaid chest and bring him a bag of clothes. When she brought  it he picked out a loin-cloth, and a long white robe, and a black  overjacket, and a shawl for the waist, and a turban cloth, all of  the very finest. Then he sent for a curved sword with a gold hilt,  and a curved dagger with gold filigree, and a pair of elegant sandals,  and a fine walking-cane.    Then the sultan said to Keejeepaa, \"Take some of my soldiers, and  let them convey these things to Sultan Daaraaee, that he may dress  himself and come to me.\"    But the gazelle answered: \"Ah, my master, can I take these soldiers  with me and put Sultan Daaraaee to shame? There he lies, beaten and  robbed, and I would not have any one see him. I can take everything  by myself.\"    \"Why,\" exclaimed the sultan, \"here is a horse, and there are clothes  and arms. I don't see how a little gazelle can manage all those  things.\"    But the gazelle had them fasten everything on the horse's back, and  tie the end of the bridle around his own neck, and then he set off  alone, amidst the wonder and admiration of the people of that city,  high and low.    When he arrived at the place where he had left the beggar-man, he  found him lying waiting for him, and overjoyed at his return.    \"Now,\" said he, \"I have brought you the sweet food I promised. Come,  get up and bathe yourself.\"    With the hesitation of a person long unaccustomed to such a thing,  the man stepped into the stream and began to wet himself a little.    \"Oh,\" said the gazelle, impatiently, \"a little water like that won't  do you much good; get out into the deep pool.\"    \"Dear me!\" said the man, timidly; \"there is so much water there;  and where there is much water there are sure to be horrible animals.\"    \"Animals! What kind of animals?\"    \"Well, crocodiles, water lizards, snakes, and, at any rate, frogs;  and they bite people, and I'm terribly afraid of all of them.\"    \"Oh, well,\" said Keejeepaa, \"do the best you can in the stream; but  rub yourself well with earth, and, for goodness' sake, scrub your  teeth well with sand; they are awfully dirty.\"    So the man obeyed, and soon made quite a change in his appearance.    Then the gazelle said: \"Here, hurry up and put on these things. The  sun has gone down, and we ought to have started before this.\"    So the man dressed himself in the fine clothes the sultan had sent,  and then he mounted the horse, and they started; the gazelle trotting  on ahead.    When they had gone some distance, the gazelle stopped, and said,  \"See here: nobody who sees you now would suspect that you are the man  who scratched in the dust heap yesterday. Even if we were to go back to  our town the neighbors would not recognize you, if it were only for the  fact that your face is clean and your teeth are white. Your appearance  is all right, but I have a caution to give you. Over there, where we  are going, I have procured for you the sultan's daughter for a wife,  with all the usual wedding gifts. Now, you must keep quiet. Say nothing  except, 'How d'ye do?' and 'What's the news?' Let me do the talking.\"    \"All right,\" said the man; \"that suits me exactly.\"    \"Do you know what your name is?\"    \"Of course I do.\"    \"Indeed? Well, what is it?\"    \"Why, my name is Haamdaanee.\"    \"Not much,\" laughed Keejeepaa; \"your name is Sultan Daaraaee.\"    \"Oh, is it?\" said his master. \"That's good.\"    So they started forward again, and in a little while they saw soldiers  running in every direction, and fourteen of these joined them to  escort them. Then they saw ahead of them the sultan, and the vizirs,  and the emirs, and the judges, and the great men of the city, coming  to meet them.    \"Now, then,\" said Keejeepaa, \"get off your horse and salute your  father-in-law. That's him in the middle, wearing the sky-blue jacket.\"    \"All right,\" said the man, jumping off his horse, which was then led  by a soldier.    So the two met, and the sultans shook hands, and kissed each other,  and walked up to the palace together.    Then they had a great feast, and made merry and talked until night,  at which time Sultan Daaraaee and the gazelle were put into an inner  room, with three soldiers at the door to guard and attend upon them.    When the morning came, Keejeepaa went to the sultan and said: \"Master,  we wish to attend to the business which brought us here. We want  to marry your daughter, and the sooner the ceremony takes place,  the better it will please the Sultan Daaraaee.\"    \"Why, that's all right,\" said the sultan; \"the bride is ready. Let  some one call the teacher, Mwaalee'moo, and tell him to come at once.\"    When Mwaaleemoo arrived, the sultan said, \"See here, we want you to  marry this gentleman to my daughter"]]]
