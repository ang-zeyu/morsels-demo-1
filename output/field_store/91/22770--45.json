The second step was the construction  of the 'Solar,' or chamber over the kitchen, which became the bedroom of  the master and the mistress of the house. Then they built a room behind  the solar for the daughters and the maidservants; the sons and the  menservants still sleeping in the Hall. Presumably the house was at this  stage in the time of King Ethelred, just before the Norman Conquest. The  ladies' 'bower' followed, and after that the sleeping rooms for the men.    There was no furniture, as we understand it. Benches there were, and  trestles for the tables, which were literally laid at every meal: a  great chair was provided for the Lord and Lady: tapestry kept out the  draughts: weapons, musical instruments, and other things hung upon the  walls. Dinner was at noon: supper in the evening when work was over:  they made great use of vegetables and they had nearly all our modern  fruits: they drank, as the national beverage, beer or mead.    But everybody was not a wealthy merchant: most of the citizens were  craftsmen of some kind. These lived in small wooden houses of two rooms,  one above the other: those who were not able to afford so much slept in  hovels, consisting of four uprights with 'wattle and daub' for the  sides, a roof of thatch, no window, and a fire in the middle of the  floor. They lived very roughly: they endured many hardships: but they  were a well-fed people, turbulent and independent: their houses were  crowded in narrow lanes--how narrow may be understood by a walk along  Thames Street; they were always in danger of fire--in 962, in 1087, in  1135, the greater part of the City was burned to the ground. They lived  in plenty: there was work for all: they had their folk mote--their City  parliament--and their ward mote--which still exists: they had no feudal  lord to harass them: as for the dirt and mud and stench of the narrow  City streets, they cared nothing for such things. They were free: and  they were well fed: and they were cheerful and contented.          11. THE WALL OF LONDON.      Let us examine into the history and the course of the Wall of London, if  only for the very remarkable facts that the boundary of the City was  determined for fifteen hundred years by the erection of this Wall; that  for some purposes the course of the Wall still affects the government of  London; and that it was only pulled down bit by bit in the course of the  last century.    You will see by reference to the map what was the course of the Wall. It  began, starting from the east where the White Tower now stands. Part of  the foundation of the Tower consists of a bastion of the Roman wall. It  followed a line nearly north as far as Aldgate. Then it turned in a N.W.  direction just north of Camomile Street and Bevis Marks to Bishopsgate.  Thence it ran nearly due W., north of the street called London Wall,  turning S. at Monkwell Street. At Aldersgate it turned W. until it  reached Newgate, where it turned nearly S. again and so to the river, a  little east of the present Blackfriars Bridge. It ran, lastly, along the  river bank to join its eastern extremity. The river wall had openings or  gates at Dowgate and Bishopsgate, and probably at Queen Hithe. The  length of the Wall, without counting the river side, was 2 miles and 608  feet.    This formidable Wall was originally about 12 feet thick made of rubble  and mortar, the latter very hard, and faced with stone. You may know  Roman work by the courses of tiles or bricks. They are arranged in  double layers about 2 feet apart. The so-called bricks are not in the  least like our bricks, being 6 inches long, 12 inches wide and 11/2 inch  thick. The Wall was 20 feet high, with towers and bastions at intervals  about 50 feet high. At first there was no moat or ditch, and it will be  understood that in order to protect the City from an attack of  barbarians--Picts or Scots--it was enough to close the gates and to man  the towers. The invaders had no ladders.    [Illustration: CITY GATES.]    In the course of centuries a great many repairs and rebuildings of the  Wall took place. The Saxons allowed it to fall into a ruinous condition.  Alfred rebuilt it and strengthened it. The next important repairs were  made in the reign of King John in 1215, by Henry III., Edward I.,  Edward II., Edward III., Richard II., Edward IV. After these various  rebuildings there would seem to be little left of the original Wall.  That, however, a great part of it continued to be the hard rubble core  of the Roman work seems evident from the fact that the course of the  Wall was never altered. The only alteration was when they turned the  Wall west at Ludgate down to the Fleet River and so to the confluence of  the Fleet and the Thames. The river side of the Wall was also allowed to  be removed.    [Illustration: REMAINS OF THE WALL.]    The City was thus protected by a great wall pierced by a few gates, with  bastions and towers. At the East End after the Norman Conquest rose the  Great White Tower still standing. At the West End was a tower called  Montfichet's Tower.    [Illustration: PART OF THE ROMAN WALL AT LEICESTER.]    But a wall without a ditch, where a ditch was possible, became of  little use as soon as scaling ladders were invented with wooden movable  towers and other devices. A ditch was accordingly constructed in the  year 1211 in the reign of King John. It appears to have been from the  very first neglected by the citizens, who trusted more to their own  bravery than to the protection of a ditch. It was frequently ordered to  be cleansed and repaired: it abounded, when it was clean, with good fish  of various kinds: but it was gradually allowed to dry up until, in the  reign of Queen Elizabeth, nothing was left but a narrow channel or no  channel at all but a few scattered ponds, with market gardens planted in  the ditch itself. In Agas's map of London these gardens are figured,  with summer houses and cottages for the gardeners and cattle grazing. On  the west side north of Ludgate the ditch has entirely disappeared and  houses are built against the Wall on the outside. Houndsditch is a row  of mean houses facing the moat. Fore Street is also built over against  the moat. Within and without the Wall they placed churchyards--those of  St. Alphege, Allhallows, and St. Martin's Outwich, you may still see for  yourselves within the Wall: that of St. Augustine's at the north end of  St. Mary Axe, has vanished. Those of the three churches of St. Botolph,  Bishopsgate, Aldgate, Aldersgate, and that of St. Giles are churchyards  without the Wall. Then the ditch became filled up and houses were built  all along the Wall within and without. Thus began unchecked, perhaps  openly encouraged, the gradual demolition of the Wall. It takes a long  time to tear down a wall of solid rubble twelve feet thick. It took the  Londoners about 160 years. In the year 1760 they finally removed the  gates. Most of the Wall was gone by this time but large fragments  remained here and there. You may still see a considerable piece, part of  a bastion in the churchyard of St. Giles, and the vestry of All Hallows  on the Wall is built upon a bastion. In Camomile Street and in other  places portions of the Wall have been discovered where excavations have  been made: and, of course, the foundation of the Wall exists still, from  end to end.          12. NORMAN LONDON.      When William the Conqueror received the submission of the City he gave  the citizens a Charter--their first Charter--of freedom. There can be no  doubt that the Charter was the price demanded by the citizens and  willingly paid by the Conqueror in return for their submission. The  following is the document. Short as it is, the whole future of the City  is founded upon these few words:--    'William King greets William Bishop and Gosfrith Portreeve and all the  burghers within London, French and English, friendly.    'I do you to wit that I will that ye be all law worthy that were in King  Edward's day, and I will that every child be his father's heir after his  father's day: and I will not endure that any man offer any wrong to you.    'God keep you.'    The ancient Charter itself is preserved at Guildhall. Many copies of it  and translations of it were made from time to time. Let us see what it  means.    The citizens were to be 'law worthy' as they had been in the days of  King Edward. This meant that they were to be free men in the courts of  justice, with the right to be tried by their equals, that is, by jury.  'All who were law worthy in King Edward's day.' Serfs were not law  worthy, for instance. That the children should inherit their father's  property was, as much as the preceding clause, great security to the  freedom of the City, for it protected the people from any feudal claims  that might arise. Next, observe that there was never any Earl of London:  the City had no Lord but the King: it never would endure any Lord but  the King. An attempt was made, but only one, and that was followed by  the downfall of the Queen--Matilda--who tried it. Feudal customs arose  and flourished and died, but they were unknown in this free city.    But the City with its strong walls, its great multitude of people, and  its resources, might prove so independent as to lock out the King.  William therefore began to build the Tower, by means of which he could  not only keep the enemy out of London but could keep his own strong hand  upon the burghers. He took down a piece of the wall and enclosed twelve  acres of ground, in which he built his stronghold, within a deep and  broad ditch. The work was entrusted to Gundulph, Bishop of Rochester,  who left it unfinished when he died thirty years after.    The next great Charter of the City was granted by Henry the First. He  remitted the payment of the levies for feudal service, of tax called  Danegeld, originally imposed for buying off the Danes: of the murder  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2800"],[0,"The Koran (Al-Qur'an) (#7)"],[1," the growth of a new power, by the ruinous strifes of the Persians and Greeks.

SURA1 XCVI.-THICK BLOOD, OR CLOTS OF BLOOD [I.]    MECCA.-19 Verses    In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful2    RECITE3 thou, in the name of thy Lord who created;-    Created man from CLOTS OF BLOOD:-    Recite thou! For thy Lord is the most Beneficent,    Who hath taught the use of the pen;-    Hath taught Man that which he knoweth not.    Nay, verily,4 Man is insolent,    Because he seeth himself possessed of riches.    Verily, to thy Lord is the return of all.    What thinkest thou of him that holdeth back    A servant5 of God when he prayeth?    What thinkest thou?6 Hath he followed the true Guidance, or enjoined Piety?    What thinkest thou? Hath he treated the truth as a lie and turned his back?    What! doth he not know how that God seeth?    Nay, verily, if he desist not, We shall seize him by the forelock,    The lying sinful forelock!    Then let him summon his associates;7    We too will summon the guards of Hell:    Nay! obey him not; but adore, and draw nigh to God.8      _______________________    1 The word Sura occurs nine times in the Koran, viz. Sur. ix. 65, 87, 125,  128; xxiv. 1; xlvii. 22 (twice); ii. 21; x. 39; but it is not easy to  determine whether it means a whole chapter, or part only of a chapter, or is  used in the sense of \"revelation.\" See Weil's Mohammed der Prophet, pp. 361-  363. It is understood by the Muhammadan commentators to have a primary  reference to the succession of subjects or parts, like the rows of bricks in  a wall. The titles of the Suras are generally taken from some word occurring  in each, which is printed in large type throughout, where practicable.    2 This formula-Bismillahi 'rrahmani 'rrahim-is of Jewish origin. It was in  the first instance taught to the Koreisch by Omayah of Taief, the poet, who  was a contemporary with, but somewhat older than, Muhammad; and who, during  his mercantile journeys into Arabia Petra and Syria, had made himself  acquainted with the sacred books and doctrines of Jews and Christians. (Kitab  al-Aghâni, 16. Delhi.) Muhammad adopted and constantly used it, and it is  prefixed to each Sura except the ninth. The former of the two epithets  implies that the mercy of God is exercised as occasions arise, towards all  his creatures; the latter that the quality of mercy is inherent in God and  permanent, so that there is only a shade of difference between the two words.  Maracci well renders, In Nomine Dei Miseratoris, Misericordis. The rendering  I have adopted is that of Mr. Lane in his extracts from the Koran. See also  Freytag's Lex. ii. p. 133. Perhaps, In the name of Allah, the God of Mercy,  the Merciful, would more fully express the original Arabic. The first five  verses of this Sura are, in the opinion of nearly all commentators, ancient  and modern, the earliest revelations made to Muhammad, in the 40th year of  his life, and the starting point of El-Islam. (See the authorities quoted in  detail in Nöldeke's Geschichte des Qorâns, p. 62, n.)    3 The usual rendering is read. But the word qaraa, which is the root of the  word Koran, analogous to the Rabbinic mikra, rather means to address, recite;  and with regard to its etymology and use in the kindred dialects to call, cry  aloud, proclaim. Compare Isai. lviii. 1; 1 Kings xviii. 37; and Gesen.  Thesaur. on the Hebrew root. I understand this passage to mean, \"Preach to  thy fellow men what thou believest to be true of thy Lord who has created man  from the meanest materials, and can in like manner prosper the truth which  thou proclaimest. He has taught man the art of writing (recently introduced  at Mecca) and in this thou wilt find a powerful help for propagating the  knowledge of the divine Unity.\" The speaker in this, as in all the Suras, is  Gabriel, of whom Muhammad had, as he believed, a vision on the mountain Hirâ,  near Mecca. See note 1 on the next page. The details of the vision are quite  unhistorical.    4 This, and the following verses, may have been added at a later period,  though previous to the Flight, and with special reference, if we are to  believe the commentators Beidhawi, etc., to the opposition which Muhammad  experienced at the hands of his opponent, Abu Jahl, who had threatened to set  his foot on the Prophet's neck when prostrate in prayer. But the whole  passage admits of application to mankind in general.    5 That is Muhammad. Nöldeke, however, proposes to render \"a slave.\" And it is  certain that the doctrines of Islam were in the first instance embraced by  slaves, many of whom had been carried away from Christian homes, or born of  Christian parents at Mecca. \"Men of this description,\" says Dr. Sprenger  (Life of Mohammad. Allahabad. p. 159), \"no doubt prepared the way for the  Islam by inculcating purer notions respecting God upon their masters and  their brethren. These men saw in Mohammad their liberator; and being  superstitious enough to consider his fits as the consequence of an  inspiration, they were among the first who acknowledged him as a prophet.  Many of them suffered torture for their faith in him, and two of them died as  martyrs. The excitement among the slaves when Mohammad first assumed his  office was so great, that Abd Allah bin Jod'an, who had one hundred of these  sufferers, found it necessary to remove them from Makkah, lest they should  all turn converts.\" See Sura xvi. 105, 111; ii. 220.    6 Lit. hast thou seen if he be upon the guidance.    7 The principal men of the Koreisch who adhered to Abu Jahl.    8 During a period variously estimated from six months to three years from the  revelation of this Sura, or of its earliest verses, the prophetic inspiration  and the revelation of fresh Suras is said to have been suspended. This  interval is called the Fatrah or intermission; and the Meccan Suras delivered  at its close show that at or during this period Muhammad had gained an  increasing and more intimate acquaintance with the Jewish and Christian  Scriptures. \"The accounts, however,\" says Mr. Muir (vol. ii. 86) \"are  throughout confused, if not contradictory; and we can only gather with  certainty that there was a time during which his mind hung in suspense, and  doubted the divine mission.\" The idea of any supernatural influence is of  course to be entirely excluded; although there is no doubt that Muhammad  himself had a full belief in the personality and influence of Satans and  Djinn. Profound meditation, the struggles of an earnest mind anxious to  attain to truth, the morbid excitability of an epileptic subject, visions  seen in epileptic swoons, disgust at Meccan idolatry, and a desire to teach  his countrymen the divine Unity will sufficiently account for the period of  indecision termed the Fatrah, and for the determination which led Muhammad,  in all sincerity, but still self-deceived, to take upon himself the office  and work of a Messenger from God. We may perhaps infer from such passages as  Sura ii. 123, what had ever been the leading idea in Muhammad's mind.      SURA LXXIV.-THE ENWRAPPED1 [II.]    MECCA.-55 Verses    In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful    O THOU, ENWRAPPED in thy mantle!    Arise and warn!    Thy Lord-magnify Him!    Thy raiment-purify it!    The abomination-flee it!    And bestow not favours that thou mayest receive again with increase;    And for thy Lord wait thou patiently.    For when there shall be a trump on the trumpet,2    That shall be a distressful day,    A day, to the Infidels, devoid of ease.    Leave me alone to deal with him3 whom I have created,    And on whom I have bestowed vast riches,    And sons dwelling before him,    And for whom I have smoothed all things smoothly down;-    Yet desireth he that I should add more!    But no!  because to our signs he is a foe    I will lay grievous woes upon him.    For he plotted and he planned!    May he be cursed!  How he planned!    Again, may he be cursed!  How he planned!    Then looked he around him,    Then frowned and scowled,    Then turned his back and swelled with disdain,    And said, This is merely magic that will be wrought;    It is merely the word of a mortal.    We will surely cast him into Hell-fire.    And who shall teach thee what Hell-fire is?    It leaveth nought, it spareth nought,    Blackening the skin.    Over it are nineteen angels.    None but angels have we made guardians of the fire:4 nor have we made this to  be their number but to perplex the unbelievers, and that they who possess the  Scriptures may be certain of the truth of the Koran, and that they who  believe may increase their faith;    And that they to whom the Scriptures have been given, and the believers, may  not doubt;    And that the infirm of heart and the unbelievers may say, What meaneth God by  this parable?    Thus God misleadeth whom He will, and whom He will doth He guide aright: and  none knoweth the armies of thy Lord but Himself: and this is no other than a  warning to mankind.    Nay, by the Moon!    By the Night when it retreateth!    By the Morn when it brighteneth!    Hell is one of the most grievous woes,    Fraught with warning to man,    To him among you who desireth to press forward, or to remain behind.5    For its own works lieth every soul in pledge.  But they of Gods right hand    In their gardens shall ask of the wicked;-    What hath cast you into Hell-fire?6    They will say, We were not of those who prayed,    And we were not of those who fed the poor,    And we plunged into vain disputes with vain disputers,    And we rejected as a lie, the day of reckoning,    Till the certainty7 came upon us-    And intercession of the interceders shall not avail them.    Then what hath come to them that they turn aside from the Warning    As if they were affrighted asses"]]]
