Years ago I used to devour       the 'Spirit of the Times.' Indeed, much of my passion for       sports of all kinds grew out of reading the 'Spirit.' Like       Albert Pike's poet, in 'Fantasms,' I            'Had not known the bent of my own mind,           Until the mighty spell of 'Porter' woke           Its hidden passions.'         Only Albert Pike, says 'Coleridge' and 'Powers' for 'Porter'       and 'passions.' Then, I have a half-written novel in my MS.       piles, with poems, tales, sketches, histories, commenced, or       arranged in my mind ready to be put in writing, _to order_.       In a word, I am cocked and primed for authorship. My life       here invites me urgently to literary employments. My house,       servants, &c. &c.,--all that a country gentleman, really       wants of the goods of life,--are in sure possession to me       and mine. I want honors, and some little more money. Be good       enough, my dear sir, to let me know how I am to go about       acquiring them.\"    We wrote with frankness what we thought as true, of possible pecuniary  advantages from the course he proposed, and were answered:         \"What you say about the returns in money for an author's       labors is dispiriting enough,--and I at once give over an       earnest purpose, which I had formed, of writing _books_.       Thank God, I am not dependent on the booksellers, but have a       moderate and sure support for my family, apart from the       crowding hopes and fears which dependence on them, would no       doubt generate. But I must add (or forego some       gratifications) two or three hundred dollars per annum to my       ordinary means. I might easily make this by my profession,       which I have deserted and neglected, but it would be as bad       as the tread-mill to me; I detest the law. On the other       hand, I love the fever-fits of composition. The music of       rhythm, coming from God knows where, like the airy melody in       the Tempest, tingles pleasantly in my veins and fingers; I       like to build the verse cautiously, but with the excitement       of a rapid writer, which I rein in and check; and then, we       both know how glorious it is to make the gallant dash, and       round off the stanza with the sonorous couplet, or with some       rhyme as natural to its place as a leaf on a tree, but       separated from its mate that peeps down to it over the inky       ends of many intervening lines.... That unepistolary       sentence has considerably fatigued me. I was saying, or       about to say, that I would be obliged to you for information       as to the profitableness of writing for periodicals.\"    From this time Mr. Cooke wrote much, but in a desultory way, and seemed, in  a growing devotion to a few friends, and in the happiness that was in his  home, to forget almost the dreams of ambition. He had commenced an  historical novel to be called \"Lutzen,\" in which that great battle was to  end the adventures of his hero; this he threw aside, and his love for that  age appeared in \"The Chevalier Merlin,\" suggested by the beautiful story  of Charles the Twelfth, as given by Voltaire, several chapters of which  appeared in the Southern Literary Messenger. In the same magazine he  printed \"John Carpe,\" \"The Two Country Houses,\" and other tales, parts of a  series in which he intended to dramatize the whole life and manners of  Virginia. As for any applause that these might win for him, he wrote to his  friend John R. Thompson:         \"I look upon these matters serenely, and will treat renown       as Sir Thomas More advises concerning guests; welcome its       coming when it cometh, hinder not with oppressive eagerness       its going, when it goeth. Furthermore, I am of the temper to       look placidly upon the profile of this same renown, if,       instead of stopping, it went by to take up with another;       therefore it would not ruffle me to see you win the honors       of southern letters away from me.\"    The chivalric poetry had filled his mind early and long, and he was only  banishing it for the more independent and beautiful growth of his nature,  when his untimely death destroyed hopes of fruits which the productions of  his youth seemed to precede as blossoms. He died suddenly, at his home, on  Sunday, the 20th of January, 1850, at the age of thirty-three.    At the time of his death he was writing \"The Women of Shakspeare,\" \"The  Chariot Race,\" and a political and literary satire.    Undoubtedly Philip Pendleton Cooke was one of the truest poets of our day,  and what he has left us was full of promise that he would become one of the  most famous. Of his love poems, this little song, written when he was  scarcely more than twenty, is perhaps the finest:      FLORENCE VANE.        I loved thee long and dearly,          Florence Vane;      My life's bright dream, and early          Hath come again;      I renew, in my fond vision,          My heart's dear pain,      My hopes, and thy derision,          Florence Vane.        The ruin lone and hoary,          The ruin old,      Where thou didst hark my story,          At even told,----      That spot--the hues Elysian          Of sky and plain----      I treasure in my vision,          Florence Vane.        Thou wast lovelier than the roses,          In their prime;      Thy voice excelled the closes          Of sweetest rhyme;      Thy heart was as a river          Without a main;      Would I had loved thee never,          Florence Vane.        But fairest, coldest wonder!          Thy glorious clay      Lieth the green sod under----          Alas the day!      And it boots not to remember          Thy disdain----      To quicken love's pale ember,          Florence Vane.        The lilies of the valley          By young graves weep,      The pansies love to dally          Where maidens sleep;      May their bloom, in beauty vying,          Never wane      Where thine earthly part is lying,          Florence Vane!    We cannot quote others; in the lines \"To my Daughter Lilly,\" may be  discovered the tenderness and warmth of his affections; in his Ballads, the  fiery and chivalrous phase of his intelligence; in \"Ugolino,\" his pathos;  in \"Life in the Autumn Woods,\" his love of nature; and in all his writings,  the thoroughly healthy character of his mind.    As a boy and as a young man, we understand, his life was always  poetical--apart, original, and commanding affectionate respect. As he grew  older, and married, he became practical in his views, reaching that point  in the life of genius in which its beautiful ideals take the forms of duty  or become the strength of wise resolves. Toward his family, including his  father, mother, brothers, and sisters, he cherished a deep and unfaltering  devotion. A short time before his last illness he introduced into his  household morning and evening prayers. He died, as he had lived, a  pure-minded gentleman and humble Christian.    Of his personal appearance a just impression is given by the portrait at  the beginning of this article. His carriage was graceful and upright; his  frame vigorous and elastic, trained as he was by constant hunting in the  Blue Ridge; his hair was black and curling; his eye dark and bright; his  expression calm and thoughtful; his manner impressed with dignity.        ----\"Lycidas is dead, dead ere his prime,      Young Lycidas, and hath not left his peer.\"          DR. HUNTINGTON ON COPYRIGHT.      The author of _Alice_ and _Alban_ has written the following piquant letter  on the important subject of INTERNATIONAL COPYRIGHT.    _To the Editor of the Morning Chronicle._    As an American deeply interested in the subject of international copyright,  and much struck by the fallacies of some of the speakers at a meeting of  authors and publishers, recently reported in the London journals, may I, as  the subject is fresh so long as it is undecided, beg of your courtesy a  little space to point them out.    Let me begin by admitting the force of most that was said by the  distinguished chairman on that occasion, Sir Edward Bulwer Lytton. No man  living, perhaps, has a better right than he to complain of my countrymen,  to whose intellectual pleasures and moral instruction he has contributed  ever since I was a boy, out of the hard labor of his brains--helping to  enrich our publishers and booksellers, and to stimulate all the trade  connected with bookmaking, and vivifying the circulation of magazines and  newspapers--for all which he has never received a penny. The same may be  said of Dickens, whose works are of course as familiar to us as to you, and  whose characters have become a part of our stock of ideas, more precious  than the gold from our new-discovered mines. It is true that neither of  these great men has benefited us so much as he might have done if we had  paid for our pleasure honorably, for the influence of genius is like that  of grace--the fertilizing shower falls in vain on the arid, stony places of  selfish and unjust enjoyment. Charles Dickens has never received a penny  from us, although we insulted our unpaid creditor when he came among us by  asking him to Boz balls and dinners, given on a scale of splendor which  showed how well we could have afforded to pay our debt if we had been  honest enough to have admitted it. How degrading--how incongruous--for a  great nation, such as we boast of being, to be thus the literary  pensioners, the intellectual beggars of England, meanly enjoying what we  won't pay for?

This  animal had a large allowance of rice, therefore about three-quarters of  a pound were placed within each tube of plantain stem. A lady offered  the elephant, when being fed, a very small sweet biscuit, about an inch  and a half in diameter. This was accepted in the trunk, but almost  immediately rejected and thrown upon the ground. The mahout, fearing  that his elephant had behaved rudely in thus refusing a present from a  lady's hand, picked up the biscuit and inserted it in the next parcel of  rice and plantain stem. This was placed within the elephant's mouth. At  the first crunch the animal showed evident signs of disgust, and at once  spat out the whole of the contents. There lay a complete ruin of the  neat package, which had been burst by the power of the great jaws; but  among the scattered rice that had been ejected we perceived the biscuit  which had caused the second instance of bad behaviour. So utterly  disgusted was the elephant with this tiny foreign substance that it  endeavoured to cleanse its mouth from every grain of rice, as though  polluted by the contact, and for several minutes it continued to insert  its trunk and rake out each atom from its tongue and throat.    The adaptation of the trunk to many purposes is very interesting. I had  an elephant who would eat every particle of rice in a round bamboo  basket by sucking it up the trunk and then blowing it into its mouth.  The basket was close-grained and smooth inside, but although brimful at  the commencement of operations, it was emptied by the elephant as though  it had been cleansed with a dry sponge.    A distinct rule for feeding elephants cannot be laid down without  exceptions rendered necessary by peculiarities of localities and the  amount of hard work required from the animal. If the elephant is simply  turned out to grass for a season, it will thrive upon such natural  herbage as bamboos, the foliage of the banyan, peepul, and other  varieties of the Ficus family; but if it is expected to travel and  perform good work, it is usual in the Commissariat department to allow  each elephant seven and a half seers of flour, equal to 15 lbs.  avoirdupois. In addition to this, 600 lbs. of green fodder are given,  and about 1 lb. of ghee (buffalo butter), with salt and jaggery (native  sugar). During a jungle expedition I have always doubled the allowance  of flour to 30 lbs. daily for each animal. This is made into large flat  cakes like Scotch \"scones,\" weighing 2 lbs. each. The elephants are fed  at about an hour before sunset, and then taken to drink water before  actual night. Cleanliness is indispensable to the good health and  condition of the elephant. It should bathe daily, and the entire body  should be well scoured with a piece of brick or a soft quality of  sandstone. This operation is much enjoyed, and the huge animal, obeying  the command, lies down upon its side and accommodates its carcase to the  scrubbing process by adapting its position to the requirements of the  operator. It will frequently bury its head completely beneath the water,  and merely protrude the extremity of its trunk to breathe above the  surface. The coolie is most particular in scrubbing every portion of the  animal, after which it will usually stand within the tank or river and  shower volumes of water from its trunk over its back and flanks. When  well washed, it appears a thoroughly clean black mass, but in a few  minutes it proceeds to destroy its personal beauty by throwing clouds of  dust upon its back, which, adhering to the moisture occasioned by its  recent bath, converts the late clean animal into a brown mound of earth.    There is no quadruped not absolutely amphibious that is so thoroughly at  home in the water as the elephant. In a wild state it will swim the  largest rivers, and it delights in morasses, where it rolls in the deep  mud like a pig or buffalo, and thus coats its hide with a covering of  slime, which protects it from the attacks of flies and the worry of  mosquitoes. When in a domestic state, the elephant is shy of trusting  itself upon unsound earth or quicksands, as it appears to have lost the  confidence resulting from an independent freedom among the jungles, and  marshy valleys teeming with aquatic vegetation. It will also refuse to  cross a bridge unless of solid masonry, and it is curious to observe the  extreme care with which it sounds the structure, either by striking with  the coiled extremity of the trunk or by experimenting with the pressure  of one foot, before it ventures to trust its whole weight upon the  suspected floor.    It is difficult to describe the limit of an elephant's swimming powers;  this must depend upon many circumstances, whether it is following the  stream or otherwise, but the animal can remain afloat for several hours  without undue fatigue. The displacement of an elephant's carcase is less  than the weight of water, although it swims so deeply immersed that it  would appear to float with difficulty. An elephant shot dead within the  water will float immediately, with a considerable portion of one flank  raised so high above the surface that several men could be supported, as  though upon a raft. The body of a hippopotamus will sink like a stone,  and will not reappear upon the surface for about two hours, until the  gas has to a certain degree distended the carcase: thus the hippopotamus  is of a denser and heavier material than the elephant, although it is an  aquatic animal.    When tame elephants cross a river they are conducted by their drivers,  who stand upon their backs, either balancing themselves without  assistance, or supported by holding a cord attached to the animal's  neck. It is very interesting to watch the passage of a large river by a  herd of these creatures, who to a stranger's eye would appear to be in  danger of drowning, although in reality they are merely gamboling in the  element which is their delight. I have seen them cross the Brahmaputra  when the channel was about a mile in width. Forty elephants scrambled  down the precipitous bank of alluvial deposit and river sand: this,  although about thirty-five feet high, crumbled at once beneath the  fore-foot of the leading elephant, and many tons detached from the  surface quickly formed a steep incline. Squatting upon its  hind-quarters, and tucking its hinder knees beneath its belly, while it  supported its head upon its trunk and outstretched fore legs, it slid  and scrambled to the bottom, accompanied by an avalanche of earth and  dust, thus forming a good track for the following herd.    It is surprising to see in how few minutes a large herd of elephants  descending a steep place will form a road. I have frequently seen them  break down an alluvial cliff in the manner described, where at first  sight I should have thought it impossible for an elephant to descend.  Once within the river the fun began in earnest. After a march in the hot  sun, it was delightful to bathe in the deep stream of the Brahmaputra,  and the mighty forms splashed and disported themselves, sometimes  totally submerged, with the drivers standing ankle-deep upon their  hidden backs, which gave them the appearance of walking upon the  surface. A tip of the trunk was always above water, and occasionally the  animal would protrude the entire head, but only to plunge once more  beneath the stream. In this way, swimming at great speed, and at the  same time playing along their voyage, the herd crossed the broad river,  and we saw their dusky forms glittering in the sunlight as they rose  wetted from their bath, and waded majestically along the shallows to  reach an island; from which they again started upon a similar journey to  cross another channel of the river.    The first impression of a stranger when observing the conduct of a  mahout or driver is sympathy for the animal, which is governed through  the severe authority of the iron spike. This instrument is about twenty  inches long, and resembles somewhat an old-fashioned boat-hook, being a  sharp spike at the extremity beyond the keen-pointed hook; it can thus  be used either to drive the elephant forward by digging the point into  its head, or to pull it back by hooking on to the tender base of the  ears. These driving-hooks weigh from about 4 to 6 lbs., and are  formidable weapons; some are exceedingly ancient, and have been  preserved for a couple of centuries or more, such specimens being highly  artistic, and first-rate examples of the blacksmith's work. Although we  may commence our experience by pitying the animal that is subjected to  such harsh treatment, we quickly discover that without the hook the  elephant is like the donkey without the stick. The fact of his knowing  that you possess the power, or propeller, is sufficient to ensure  comparative obedience, but it would be impossible to direct the  movements of an elephant by simple kindness without the power to inflict  punishment. This fact alone will prove that the elephant does not serve  man through affection, but that it is compelled through fear. It is  curious to witness the absurd subjection of this mighty animal even by a  child. I have frequently seen a small boy threaten a large elephant with  a stick, and the animal has at once winced; and, curling the trunk  between the legs, it has closed its eyes and exhibited every symptom of  extreme terror when struck repeatedly upon the trunk and face. The male  is generally more uncertain than the female. It would at first sight  appear that for shooting purposes the bull elephant would be preferred  for its greater strength and courage. There can be no doubt that a pair  of long tusks is an important protection, and not only forms a defence  against the attack of a tiger or other animal, but is valuable for  offensive purposes; yet, notwithstanding this advantage, the female is  generally"]]]
