Schomburgk has  given me information on this head. See also 'Journal of R. Geographical  Soc.' volume 13 1843 page 65.)    The main argument in favour of the several breeds of the dog being the  descendants of distinct wild stocks, is their resemblance in various  countries to distinct species still existing there. It must, however, be  admitted that the comparison between the wild and domesticated animal has  been made but in few cases with sufficient exactness. Before entering on  details, it will be well to show that there is no a priori difficulty in  the belief that several canine species have been domesticated. Members of  the dog family inhabit nearly the whole world; and several species agree  pretty closely in habits and structure with our several domesticated dogs.  Mr. Galton has shown (1/12. 'Domestication of Animals' Ethnological Soc.  December 22, 1863.) how fond savages are of keeping and taming animals of  all kinds. Social animals are the most easily subjugated by man, and  several species of Canidae hunt in packs. It deserves notice, as bearing on  other animals as well as on the dog, that at an extremely ancient period,  when man first entered any country, the animals living there would have  felt no instinctive or inherited fear of him, and would consequently have  been tamed far more easily than at present. For instance, when the Falkland  Islands were first visited by man, the large wolf-like dog (Canis  antarcticus) fearlessly came to meet Byron's sailors, who, mistaking this  ignorant curiosity for ferocity, ran into the water to avoid them: even  recently a man, by holding a piece of meat in one hand and a knife in the  other, could sometimes stick them at night. On a island in the Sea of Aral,  when first discovered by Butakoff, the saigak antelopes, which are  \"generally very timid and watchful, did not fly from us, but on the  contrary looked at us with a sort of curiosity.\" So, again, on the shores  of the Mauritius, the manatee was not at first in the least afraid of man,  and thus it has been in several quarters of the world with seals and the  morse. I have elsewhere shown (1/13. 'Journal of Researches' etc. 1845 page  393. With respect to Canis antarcticus, see page 193. For the case of the  antelope, see 'Journal Royal Geographical Soc.' volume 23 page 94.) how  slowly the native birds of several islands have acquired and inherited a  salutary dread of man: at the Galapagos Archipelago I pushed with the  muzzle of my gun hawks from a branch, and held out a pitcher of water for  other birds to alight on and drink. Quadrupeds and birds which have seldom  been disturbed by man, dread him no more than do our English birds, the  cows, or horses grazing in the fields.    It is a more important consideration that several canine species evince (as  will be shown in a future chapter) no strong repugnance or inability to  breed under confinement; and the incapacity to breed under confinement is  one of the commonest bars to domestication. Lastly, savages set the highest  value, as we shall see in the chapter on Selection, on dogs: even half-  tamed animals are highly useful to them: the Indians of North America cross  their half-wild dogs with wolves, and thus render them even wilder than  before, but bolder: the savages of Guiana catch and partially tame and use  the whelps of two wild species of Canis, as do the savages of Australia  those of the wild Dingo. Mr. Philip King informs me that he once trained a  wild Dingo puppy to drive cattle, and found it very useful. From these  several considerations we see that there is no difficulty in believing that  man might have domesticated various canine species in different countries.  It would indeed have been a strange fact if one species alone had been  domesticated throughout the world.    We will now enter into details. The accurate and sagacious Richardson says,  \"The resemblance between the Northern American wolves (Canis lupus, var.  occidentalis) and the domestic dogs of the Indians is so great that the  size and strength of the wolf seems to be the only difference. I have more  than once mistaken a band of wolves for the dogs of a party of Indians; and  the howl of the animals of both species is prolonged so exactly in the same  key that even the practised ear of the Indian fails at times to  discriminate them.' He adds that the more northern Esquimaux dogs are not  only extremely like the grey wolves of the Arctic circle in form and  colour, but also nearly equal them in size. Dr. Kane has often seen in his  teams of sledge-dogs the oblique eye (a character on which some naturalists  lay great stress), the drooping tail, and scared look of the wolf. In  disposition the Esquimaux dogs differ little from wolves, and, according to  Dr. Hayes, they are capable of no attachment to man, and are so savage that  when hungry they will attack even their masters. According to Kane they  readily become feral. Their affinity is so close with wolves that they  frequently cross with them, and the Indians take the whelps of wolves \"to  improve the breed of their dogs.\" The half-bred wolves sometimes (Lamare-  Picquot) cannot be tamed, \"though this case is rare;\" but they do not  become thoroughly well broken in till the second or third generation. These  facts show that there can be but little, if any, sterility between the  Esquimaux dog and the wolf, for otherwise they would not be used to improve  the breed. As Dr. Hayes says of these dogs, \"reclaimed wolves they  doubtless are.\" (1/14. The authorities for the foregoing statements are as  follow:--Richardson in 'Fauna Boreali-Americana' 1829 pages 64, 75; Dr.  Kane 'Arctic Explorations' 1856 volume 1 pages 398, 455; Dr. Hayes 'Arctic  Boat Journey' 1860 page 167. Franklin's 'Narrative' volume 1 page 269,  gives the case of three whelps of a black wolf being carried away by the  Indians. Parry, Richardson, and others, give accounts of wolves and dogs  naturally crossing in the eastern parts of North America. Seeman in his  'Voyage of H.M.S. \"Herald\"' 1853 volume 2 page 26, says the wolf is often  caught by the Esquimaux for the purpose of crossing with their dogs, and  thus adding to their size and strength. M. Lamare-Picquot in 'Bull. de la  Soc. d'Acclimat.' tome 7 1860 page 148, gives a good account of the half-  bred Esquimaux dogs.)    North America is inhabited by a second kind of wolf, the prairie-wolf  (Canis latrans), which is now looked at by all naturalists as specifically  distinct from the common wolf; and is, according to Mr. J.K. Lord, in some  respects intermediate in habits between a wolf and a fox. Sir J.  Richardson, after describing the Hare Indian dog, which differs in many  respects from the Esquimaux dog, says, \"It bears the same relation to the  prairie-wolf that the Esquimaux dog does to the great grey wolf.\" He could,  in fact, detect no marked difference between them; and Messrs. Nott and  Gliddon give additional details showing their close resemblance. The dogs  derived from the above two aboriginal sources cross together and with the  wild wolves, at least with the C. occidentalis, and with European dogs. In  Florida, according to Bartram, the black wolf-dog of the Indians differs in  nothing from the wolves of that country except in barking. (1/15. 'Fauna  Boreali-Americana' 1829 pages 73, 78, 80. Nott and Gliddon, 'Types of  Mankind' page 383. The naturalist and traveller Bartram is quoted by  Hamilton Smith in 'Naturalist Lib.' volume 10 page 156. A Mexican domestic  dog seems also to resemble a wild dog of the same country; but this may be  the prairie-wolf. Another capable judge, Mr. J.K. Lord ('The Naturalist in  Vancouver Island' 1866 volume 2 page 218), says that the Indian dog of the  Spokans, near the Rocky Mountains, \"is beyond all question nothing more  than a tamed Cayote or prairie-wolf,\" or Canis latrans.)    Turning to the southern parts of the new world, Columbus found two kinds of  dogs in the West Indies; and Fernandez (1/16. I quote this from Mr. R.  Hill's excellent account of the Alco or domestic dog of Mexico, in Gosse's  'Naturalist's Sojourn in Jamaica' 1851 page 329.) describes three in  Mexico: some of these native dogs were dumb--that is, did not bark. In  Guiana it has been known since the time of Buffon that the natives cross  their dogs with an aboriginal species, apparently the Canis cancrivorus.  Sir R. Schomburgk, who has so carefully explored these regions, writes to  me, \"I have been repeatedly told by the Arawaak Indians, who reside near  the coast, that they cross their dogs with a wild species to improve the  breed, and individual dogs have been shown to me which certainly resembled  the C. cancrivorus much more than the common breed. It is but seldom that  the Indians keep the C. cancrivorus for domestic purposes, nor is the Ai,  another species of wild dog, and which I consider to be identical with the  Dusicyon silvestris of H. Smith, now much used by the Arecunas for the  purpose of hunting. The dogs of the Taruma Indians are quite distinct, and  resemble Buffon's St. Domingo greyhound.\" It thus appears that the natives  of Guiana have partially domesticated two aboriginal species, and still  cross their dogs with them; these two species belong to a quite different  type from the North American and European wolves. A careful observer,  Rengger (1/17. 'Naturgeschichte der Saugethiere von Paraguay' 1830 s.  151.), gives reasons for believing that a hairless dog was domesticated  when America was first visited by Europeans: some of these dogs in Paraguay  are still dumb, and Tschudi (1/18. Quoted in Humboldt 'Aspects of Nature'  (English translation) volume 1 page 108.) states that they suffer from cold  in the Cordillera. This naked dog is, however quite distinct from that  found preserved in the ancient Peruvian burial-places, and described by  Tschudi, under the name of Canis ingae, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28711"],[0,"Operas Every Child Should Know (#7)"],[1,"was able,  because of her favouritism, to find out much about the prisoners; but  on the other hand, she was in danger of discovery. Although the  situation was tragic, there was considerable of a joke in Marcelline's  devotion to the youth Fidelio, and in the consequent jealousy of  Jaquino.    Love of money was Rocco's (the jailer) besetting sin. He sang of his  love with great feeling:         Life is nothing without money,         Anxious cares beset it round;       Sad, when all around is sunny,         Feels the man whom none hath found.         But when to thy keeping the treasure hath rolled,         Blind fortune thou mayest defy, then;       Both love and power their secrets unfold,         And will to thy wishes comply, then.    Rocco was also a man of heart; and since hiring Fidelio (Leonora) he  had really become very fond of the young man. When he observed the  attachment between Fidelio and Marcelline, he was inclined to favour  it.    Don Pizarro had long been the bitterest enemy of Don Florestan,  Leonora's husband, because that noble had learned of his atrocities  and had determined to depose him as governor of the fortress prison.    Hence, when Pizarro got Florestan in his clutches, he treated him with  unimaginable cruelties, and falsely reported that he was dead.    Now in the prison there had lately been much hope and rejoicing  because it was rumoured that Fernando, the great Minister of State,  was about to pay a visit of investigation. This promised a change for  the better in the condition of the prisoners. But no one knew better  than Don Pizarro that it would mean ruin to himself if Fernando found  Don Florestan in a dungeon. The two men were dear friends, and so  cruelly treated had Florestan been that Pizarro could never hope for  clemency. Hence, he called Rocco, and told him that Florestan must be  killed at once, before the arrival of Fernando.    Rocco refused point blank to do the horrid deed; but as a dependent he  could not control matters, and hence he had to consent to dig the  grave, with the understanding that Pizarro, himself, should do the  killing.    Thus far, Fidelio had been able to find out nothing about her beloved  husband, but she had become more and more of a favourite with the  unfortunate old jailer, and was permitted to go about with a certain  amount of freedom.    Upon the day when Pizarro had directed Rocco to kill a prisoner in a  certain dungeon, she overheard a good deal of the plot, and she began  to fear it might be her husband.    She went at once to Rocco:    \"Rocco, I have seen very little of the prison. May I not go into the  dungeon and look about?\"    \"Oh, it would never be allowed,\" Rocco declared. \"Pizarro is a stern  and cruel governor, and if I should do the least thing he did not  command, it would go hard with me. I should not dare let you do that,\"  he said, much troubled with the deed that was in hand.    \"But wilt thou not ask him, Rocco?\" Fidelio entreated so determinedly  that Rocco half promised.    \"Fidelio, I will tell thee. I have a bad job to do. It is to dig a  grave in one of the dungeons.\" Fidelio could hardly conceal her horror  and despair. Her suspicions were confirmed. \"There is an old well,  covered by a stone, down there, far underground, and if I lift the  stone that covers it, that will do for the grave. I will ask Pizarro  if I may have thee to help me. If he consents, it will be thy chance  to see the dungeons, but if not, I shall have done all I can about  it.\" So he went away to discuss the matter with Pizarro, while Fidelio  waited between hope and despair.    Meantime, Pizarro was gloating over his triumph. Soon his revenge  would be complete, and he sang of the matter in a most savage fashion:         Ha! what a day is this,         My vengeance shall be sated.       Thou treadest on an abyss!         For now thy doom is fated.    The words mean little, but Beethoven's music to them means much:         Remember, that once in the dust I trembled,       'Mid mocking fiends assembled;       Beneath thy conquering steel,         But Fortune's wheel is turning,         In torments thou art burning,         The victim of my hate.    The guards told one another that they had better be about their  business, as some great affair seemed afoot.    Rocco entered again.    \"I do not see the need for this killing,\" he urged. \"The man is nearly  dead as it is. He cannot last long; but at least, if I must dig the  grave, I shall need help. I have a youth in my service who is to marry  my daughter--thus I can count upon his faithfulness; and I had better  be permitted to take him into the dungeon with me, if I am to do the  work. I am an old man, and not so strong as I used to be.\"    \"Very well, very well,\" Pizarro replied. \"But see to the business.  There is no time to lose.\" And going back to Fidelio, Rocco told her  the good news: that Pizarro had consented. Then she sang joyfully of  it:    [Music:         Oh Hope, thou wilt not let the star of sorrowing love be         dimm'd for ever!       Oh come, sweet Hope, show me the goal,       However, however far forsake it will I never,         forsake it will I never,         forsake it I will never, etc.]    \"But, Rocco, instead of digging a grave for the poor man, to whom we  go, couldst thou not set him free?\" she begged.    \"Not I, my boy. It would be as much as my life was worth. I have not  been permitted even to give him food. He is nearly dead from  starvation already. Try to think as little as you can of the horrors  of this place. It is a welcome release for the poor fellow.\"    \"But to have a father-in-law who has committed a murder,\" Fidelio  shuddered, trying to prevail upon Rocco by this appeal. But he sang:    [Music:         My good lad, thou need'st not fear,       Of killing, of killing him I shall be clear,       Yes, yes, I shall be clear,       My lord himself, my lord himself will do the deed.]    \"Nay, do not worry--you'll have no murderer for a father-in-law. Our  only business is to dig the man's grave.\"    In spite of herself Leonora wept.    \"Come, come. This is too hard for thee, gentle boy. I'll manage the  business alone.\"    \"Oh, no! No! I must go. Indeed I am not afraid. I must go with thee,\"  she cried. While she was thus distracted, in rushed Marcelline and  Jaquino.    \"Oh, father! Don Pizarro is frantic with rage. You have given the  prisoners a little light and air, and he is raging about the prison  because of this. What shall we do?\" Rocco thought a moment.    \"Do nothing! He is a hard man, I--\" At that moment Pizarro came in.    \"What do you mean by this? Am I governing this prison or are you?\"    \"Don Pizarro,\" Rocco spoke calmly. \"It is the King's birthday, and I  thought it might be politic for you to give the prisoners a little  liberty, especially as the Minister was coming. It will look well to  him.\" At that Pizarro was somewhat appeased, but nevertheless he  ordered the men back to their cells. It was a mournful procession,  back to dungeon darkness. As they went they sang:    [Music:         Farewell, thou warm and sunny beam,       How soon thy joys have faded,       How soon thy joys have faded!]    While they were singing, Rocco once more tried to soften Pizarro's  heart.    \"Wilt thou not let the condemned prisoner live another day, your  highness?\" The request enraged Pizarro still more.    \"Enough! Now have done with your whimpering. Take that youth of thine  who is to help, and be about the job. Go! and let me hear no more.\"  With that awful voice of revenge and cruelty in her ears, the unhappy  Leonora followed Rocco to the dungeons, to dig her husband's grave.      ACT II    Down in the very bowels of the earth, as it seemed to Leonora, was  Florestan's dungeon. There he sat, manacled, despairing, with no ray  of light to cheer him, and his thoughts occupied only with his visions  of the beautiful home he had known, and of his wife, Leonora. When  Leonora and Rocco entered the dungeon, Florestan had fallen, half  sleeping, half dreaming upon the floor of his cell, and Leonora groped  her way fearfully toward him, believing him to be dead.    \"Oh, the awful chill of this vault,\" she sobbed. \"Look! Is the man  dead, already, Rocco?\" Rocco went to look at the prisoner.    \"No, he only sleeps. Come, that sunken well is near, and we have only  to uncover it to have the job done. It is a hard thing for a youth  like thee. Let us hurry.\" Rocco began searching for the disused well,  into which he meant the body of Florestan to be dumped after the  governor had killed him.    \"Reach me that pickaxe,\" he directed Fidelio. \"Are you afraid?\"    \"No, no, I feel chilled only.\"    \"Well, make haste with the work, my boy, and it will warm you,\" Rocco  urged. Then while he worked and urged Fidelio to do the same, she  furtively watched the prisoner whose features she could not see in the  gloom of the cell.    \"If we do not hurry, the governor will be here. Haste, haste!\" Rocco  cried.    \"Yes, yes,\" she answered, nearly fainting with grief and horror.    \"Come, come, my boy. Help me lift this great stone which closes the  mouth of the well.\" The despairing Fidelio lifted with all her poor  strength.    \"I'm lifting, I'm lifting,\" she sobbed, and she tugged and tugged,  because she dared not shirk the work. Then the stone slowly rolled  away. She was still uncertain as to the identity of the poor wretch  who was so soon to be put out of existence. She peered at him  continually.    \"Oh, whoever thou art, I will save thee. I will save thee,\" she  thought. \"I cannot have so great a horror take place. I must save  him.\" Still she peered through the darkness at the hopeless prisoner.  At the same time her grief overwhelmed her, and she began to weep. The  prisoner was roused, and plaintively thanked the strange youth for his  kindly tears.    \"Oh, whoever this poor man may be, let me give him this piece of  bread,\" Fidelio"]]]
