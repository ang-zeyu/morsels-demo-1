Among the many paratypes are specimens from Tonola,  Chiapas, and Tehuantepec, Oaxaca. These apparently were referred to  _perplexus_ solely on the nature of the cranial crests. All of the  specimens examined during the course of the present study from the  lowlands of Veracruz and from the Pacific lowlands from Sinaloa  southward to Chiapas are referable to _Bufo marmoreus_; those from the  Balsas-Tepalcatepec Basin are referable to _Bufo perplexus_, as defined  above. Ten specimens from Chilpancingo, Guerrero (UMMZ 115352), do not  readily fit either species. Perhaps there is gene exchange between the  inland and coastal populations through the relatively low pass at  Chilpancingo, at the mouth of the Rio Balsas, and near the convergent  headwaters of the Rio Coahuayana and Rio Tepalcatepec in southern  Jalisco. If this can be demonstrated, then _Bufo perplexus_ would have  to be considered as a subspecies of _Bufo marmoreus_, instead of an  allopatric species.      ~Bufo perplexus~ Taylor         _Bufo perplexus_ Taylor, Univ.

This toad is an inhabitant of pine and oak forests between 900 and 2400  meters. Near Charapendo on the slopes of the Sierra de los Tarascos and  at Coalcoman it apparently reaches its lowest altitudinal limits. At  both of these localities the pine-oak forest is replaced by arid  tropical scrub forest on the lower slopes.    Twenty-four tadpoles were collected on May 3 in a quiet section of a  fast stream near Barranca Seca. The tadpoles have a robust body,  broadest about two-thirds the distance from the snout to the posterior  edge of the body, half again as broad as deep. Eyes dorsolateral;  nostrils dorsal, somewhat directed forward, and about three-fifths the  distance from the tip of the snout to the eye; spiracle sinistral and  lateral, located at about midbody; anus median; tail long and slender;  tail-musculature extends nearly to tip of tail; depth of  tail-musculature at mid-length about one-third total depth of tail;  dorsal tail-fin not extending onto body (Fig. 5); average body length of  ten tadpoles having small hind limb buds, 14.4 mm.; average tail length,  22.0 mm.    Mouth ventral, nearly terminal, about one-third as wide as widest part  of body; anterior lip has no papillae; lower lip bordered by two rows of  papillae and lateral lips by one row of papillae; beaks moderately well  developed, the upper forming a broad arch and finely denticulate; tooth  rows 2/3, the upper rows extending to the edge of the lips, subequal in  length, and slightly longer than lower rows, which also are subequal in  length; inner upper tooth row broken medially; inner lower tooth row  sometimes broken (Fig. 6).    The body is black dorsally and laterally, and bluish gray ventrally; the  tail musculature is brown and stippled with darker brown. The fins are  transparent and stippled with brown, the stippling being most pronounced  on the posterior two-thirds of the upper tail-fin.    [Illustration: FIG. 5.

Mouthparts of larval _Bufo occidentalis_ (UMMZ  94269) from Barranca Seca, Michoacan. x 20.]    Forty recently metamorphosed individuals average 18.9 mm. in snout-vent  length.    The relationships of this toad seem to be with _Bufo bocourti_ Brocchi,  an inhabitant of pine and oak forests in the uplands of Chiapas and  Guatemala. In _Bufo occidentalis_ the tympanum usually is indistinct and  sometimes completely covered, and it is absent in _bocourti_. _Bufo  occidentalis_ has a broader interorbital area and relatively shorter and  more rounded parotid glands than _bocourti_. The tadpoles of the two  species are nearly identical (see Stuart, 1943:12).      ~Leptodactylus labialis~ (Cope)         _Cystignathus labialis_ Cope, Proc. Amer. Philos.

In the Tepalcatepec Valley this frog reaches the northernmost known  limit of its range in western Mexico. Although the species is abundant  in the valley, it apparently is absent from the coastal lowlands. In the  Tepalcatepec Valley _Leptodactylus melanonotus_ seems to be more  abundant than _labialis_. In the rainy season both species have been  heard calling from the same ponds and flooded fields.    There are only slight differences in size between the sexes;  measurements of 20 males and eight females are, respectively: snout-vent  length, 32.3-39.5 (35.1), 34.1-39.2 (37.2); tibia length, 14.3-17.0  (15.4), 14.9-16.8 (15.8); head width, 11.0-13.6 (12.0), 12.2-13.2  (12.6); head length, 12.8-15.1 (13.3), 12.8-14.6 (13.7).      ~Leptodactylus melanonotus~ (Hallowell)         _Cystignathus melanonotus_ Hallowell, Proc.

This species is widespread in the lowlands of the state; it has been  collected up to elevations of 1050 meters in the Tepalcatepec Valley. In  the dry season individuals were discovered beneath rocks along streams  and in damp arroyos; in the rainy season they were found wherever there  was water. Males were heard calling from flooded fields, ditches, rocky  streams, and small puddles. The call is a series of individual notes:  \"woink, woink, woink.\"    Adult males are noticeably smaller than females; measurements for 20  males and ten females from Apatzingan are, respectively: snout-vent  length, 29.6-34.6 (32.3), 36.3-44.1 (40.8); tibia length, 12.6-15.1  (14.0), 16.5-19.0 (17.8); head width, 10.8-11.9 (11.3), 12.6-14.8  (13.7); head length, 11.2-13.2 (11.9), 13.1-14.8 (14.0). Brownish yellow  ventral glands are present in some juveniles and in some adults  collected in the dry season as well as in the rainy season.      ~Leptodactylus occidentalis~ Taylor         _Leptodactylus occidentalis_ Taylor, Trans. Kansas Acad.       Sci., 39:349, 1937.--Tepic, Nayarit, Mexico.         Five km. W of Tangamandapio.    On the night of June 11, 1958, this species was calling from a  hyacinth-choked ditch. Although numerous individuals were heard, only  one specimen was obtained. The frogs were calling from the tangled mat  of hyacinths along with _Hyla eximia_, _Hypopachus oxyrrhinus ovis_, and  _Rana pipiens_.    Taylor (1936a:352) characterized this species as follows: \"The narrow  head, small maximum size (38 mm. for females, 33 mm. for males), the  character of the postaxillary and postfemoral glands, the narrower  groups of vomerine teeth, clearly distinguish this western Mexican form  from the more robust, larger _melanonotus_ to the south. The call is  likewise fainter and different in quality.\" Concerning the glands,  Taylor (_loc. cit._) remarked: \"There is a possibility that the horny  excrescence covering the glands may appear only during the breeding  season. This character is quite as strongly marked in females as in  males.\" Bogert and Oliver (1945:324) concluded that the population of  _Leptodactylus_ in northwestern Mexico could not be distinguished from  _melanonotus_ in other parts of the country and thus synonymized  _Leptodactylus occidentalis_ with _melanonotus_.
