Fionn was a woodsman, but he had only two eyes to look with,  one set of feet to carry him in one sole direction. But when he was  looking to the front what, or how many whats, could be staring at him  from the back? He might face in this direction, away from, or towards a  smile on a hidden face and a finger on a string. A lance might slide at  him from this bush or from the one yonder.. In the night he might have  fought them; his ears against theirs; his noiseless feet against their  lurking ones; his knowledge of the wood against their legion: but during  the day he had no chance.    Fionn went to seek his fortune, to match himself against all that might  happen, and to carve a name for himself that will live while Time has an  ear and knows an Irishman.        CHAPTER VIII    Fionn went away, and now he was alone. But he was as fitted for  loneliness as the crane is that haunts the solitudes and bleak wastes  of the sea; for the man with a thought has a comrade, and Fionn's mind  worked as featly as his body did. To be alone was no trouble to him who,  however surrounded, was to be lonely his life long; for this will be  said of Fionn when all is said, that all that came to him went from him,  and that happiness was never his companion for more than a moment.    But he was not now looking for loneliness. He was seeking the  instruction of a crowd, and therefore when he met a crowd he went into  it. His eyes were skilled to observe in the moving dusk and dapple of  green woods. They were trained to pick out of shadows birds that were  themselves dun-coloured shades, and to see among trees the animals that  are coloured like the bark of trees. The hare crouching in the fronds  was visible to him, and the fish that swayed in-visibly in the sway and  flicker of a green bank. He would see all that was to be seen, and he  would see all that is passed by the eye that is half blind from use and  wont.    At Moy Life' he came on lads swimming in a pool; and, as he looked  on them sporting in the flush tide, he thought that the tricks they  performed were not hard for him, and that he could have shown them new  ones.    Boys must know what another boy can do, and they will match themselves  against everything. They did their best under these observing eyes, and  it was not long until he was invited to compete with them and show his  mettle. Such an invitation is a challenge; it is almost, among boys, a  declaration of war. But Fionn was so far beyond them in swimming that  even the word master did not apply to that superiority.    While he was swimming one remarked: \"He is fair and well shaped,\" and  thereafter he was called \"Fionn\" or the Fair One. His name came from  boys, and will, perhaps, be preserved by them.    He stayed with these lads for some time, and it may be that they  idolised him at first, for it is the way with boys to be astounded and  enraptured by feats; but in the end, and that was inevitable, they grew  jealous of the stranger. Those who had been the champions before he came  would marshal each other, and, by social pressure, would muster all the  others against him; so that in the end not a friendly eye was turned on  Fionn in that assembly. For not only did he beat them at swimming, he  beat their best at running and jumping, and when the sport degenerated  into violence, as it was bound to, the roughness of Fionn would be ten  times as rough as the roughness of the roughest rough they could put  forward. Bravery is pride when one is young, and Fionn was proud.    There must have been anger in his mind as he went away leaving that lake  behind him, and those snarling and scowling boys, but there would have  been disappointment also, for his desire at this time should have been  towards friendliness.    He went thence to Lock Le'in and took service with the King of  Finntraigh. That kingdom may have been thus called from Fionn himself  and would have been known by another name when he arrived there.    He hunted for the King of Finntraigh, and it soon grew evident that  there was no hunter in his service to equal Fionn. More, there was no  hunter of them all who even distantly approached him in excellence. The  others ran after deer, using the speed of their legs, the noses of their  dogs and a thousand well-worn tricks to bring them within reach, and,  often enough, the animal escaped them. But the deer that Fionn got the  track of did not get away, and it seemed even that the animals sought  him so many did he catch.    The king marvelled at the stories that were told of this new hunter, but  as kings are greater than other people so they are more curious; and,  being on the plane of excellence, they must see all that is excellently  told of.    The king wished to see him, and Fionn must have wondered what the king  thought as that gracious lord looked on him. Whatever was thought, what  the king said was as direct in utterance as it was in observation.    \"If Uail the son of Baiscne has a son,\" said the king, \"you would surely  be that son.\"    We are not told if the King of Finntraigh said anything more, but we  know that Fionn left his service soon afterwards.    He went southwards and was next in the employment of the King of Kerry,  the same lord who had married his own mother. In that service he came to  such consideration that we hear of him as playing a match of chess with  the king, and by this game we know that he was still a boy in his mind  however mightily his limbs were spreading. Able as he was in sports and  huntings, he was yet too young to be politic, but he remained impolitic  to the end of his days, for whatever he was able to do he would do, no  matter who was offended thereat; and whatever he was not able to do he  would do also. That was Fionn.    Once, as they rested on a chase, a debate arose among the Fianna-Finn as  to what was the finest music in the world.    \"Tell us that,\" said Fionn turning to Oisi'n [pronounced Usheen]    \"The cuckoo calling from the tree that is highest in the hedge,\" cried  his merry son.    \"A good sound,\" said Fionn. \"And you, Oscar,\" he asked, \"what is to your  mind the finest of music?\"    \"The top of music is the ring of a spear on a shield,\" cried the stout  lad.    \"It is a good sound,\" said Fionn. And the other champions told their  delight; the belling of a stag across water, the baying of a tuneful  pack heard in the distance, the song of a lark, the laugh of a gleeful  girl, or the whisper of a moved one.    \"They are good sounds all,\" said Fionn.    \"Tell us, chief,\" one ventured, \"what you think?\"    \"The music of what happens,\" said great Fionn, \"that is the finest music  in the world.\"    He loved \"what happened,\" and would not evade it by the swerve of  a hair; so on this occasion what was occurring he would have occur,  although a king was his rival and his master. It may be that his mother  was watching the match and that he could not but exhibit his skill  before her. He committed the enormity of winning seven games in  succession from the king himself!!!    It is seldom indeed that a subject can beat a king at chess, and this  monarch was properly amazed.    \"Who are you at all?\" he cried, starting back from the chessboard and  staring on Fionn.    \"I am the son of a countryman of the Luigne of Tara,\" said Fionn.    He may have blushed as he said it, for the king, possibly for the first  time, was really looking at him, and was looking back through twenty  years of time as he did so. The observation of a king is faultless--it  is proved a thousand times over in the tales, and this king's equipment  was as royal as the next.    \"You are no such son,\" said the indignant monarch, \"but you are the son  that Muirne my wife bore to Uall mac Balscne.\"    And at that Fionn had no more to say; but his eyes may have flown to his  mother and stayed there.    \"You cannot remain here,\" his step-father continued. \"I do not want you  killed under my protection,\" he explained, or complained.    Perhaps it was on Fionn's account he dreaded the sons of Morna, but no  one knows what Fionn thought of him for he never thereafter spoke of his  step-father. As for Muirne she must have loved her lord; or she may have  been terrified in truth of the sons of Morna and for Fionn; but it is so  also, that if a woman loves her second husband she can dislike all that  reminds her of the first one. Fionn went on his travels again.        CHAPTER IX    All desires save one are fleeting, but that one lasts for ever. Fionn,  with all desires, had the lasting one, for he would go anywhere and  forsake anything for wisdom; and it was in search of this that he went  to the place where Finegas lived on a bank of the Boyne Water. But  for dread of the clann-Morna he did not go as Fionn. He called himself  Deimne on that journey.    We get wise by asking questions, and even if these are not answered we  get wise, for a well-packed question carries its answer on its back as  a snail carries its shell. Fionn asked every question he could think of,  and his master, who was a poet, and so an honourable man, answered them  all, not to the limit of his patience, for it was limitless, but to the  limit of his ability.    \"Why do you live on the bank of a river?\" was one of these questions.  \"Because a poem is a revelation, and it is by the brink of running water  that poetry is revealed to the mind.\"    \"How long have you been here?\" was the next query. \"Seven years,\" the  poet answered.    \"It is a long time,\" said wondering Fionn.    \"I would wait twice as long for a poem,\" said the inveterate bard.    \"Have you caught good poems?\" Fionn asked him.    \"The poems I am fit for,\" said the mild master. \"No person can get more  than that, for a man's readiness is his limit.\"    \"Would "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28957"],[0,"The Acts of the General Assemblies of the Church of Scotland (#7)"],[1,"where thirtie voters of Noble men and Barrons, beside the  pretended Bishops, who had no commission from any Presbyterie. In the  fourth Session of this pretended Assembly it is plainly said, That the  Noble men and Barrons came to it by the Kings direction.    III. The voting of the commissioners was not free: for by the Kings Letter  to the Assembly they were threatned, and it was declared that their  content was not needfull to any act to be made there: The King might doe  it by his own power, yet they were allured to vote by a promise that their  good service in so doing should be remembred and rewarded thereafter.    IV. The principall acts which were made, were set down _verbatim_ in the  privie conference, which chiefly consisted of the Kings Commissioners and  pretended Bishops, and only read to be ratified in the Assembly.    V. Sundrie ministers then present, doe now declare, that they knew the  ministers who voted the wrong way, to have received their present reward,  and that money was largely dealt unto them.        _Reasons for annulling the pretended Assembly at_ Aberdene, 1616.      I. There was no election of a Moderatour: but that place usurped by the  pretended Bishop of Saint _Andrews_, as the Register beareth.    II. The indiction of that pretended Assembly was but twentie dayes before  the holding of it: so that the Presbyteries and burghes could not be  prepared for sending their commissioners: which caused the absence of many  Presbyteries and fourtie foure Burghes.    III. There were twentie five noble-men, and gentle-men voters without  commission from the Kirk. Ma. _William Struthers_ voted for the  Presbyterie of _Edinburgh_, yet had no commission there-from. The  commission being given by that Presbyterie to other three, as the said  Commission registrar in the books of the Presbytery beareth. And whereas  there should be but one Commissioner from every burgh, except _Edinburgh_,  to the Assembly; at this pretended Assembly, there were two Commissioners  from _Glasgow_, two from _Cowper_, two from St. _Andrews_: whereas there  were no ruling Elders having commission from their Presbyteries at that  Assembly.    IV. When the acts of that pretended assembly were written, the Bishop of  St. _Andrews_ with his own hand did interline, adde, change, vitiate,  direct to be extracted or not extracted, as he pleased: as the scrolls  themselves seen, doe show; wherefore the Clerk did not registrat the acts  of that Assembly, in the books of Assemblies, as may be easily seen by the  blank in the register left for them remaining unfilled.        _The nullitie of the pretended Assembly at_ Saint Andrews, 1617.      I. There is no mention of it in the register of the Assemblies, and so no  warrand for their commissions, their Moderatour or Clerk.    II. The indiction of it was so unformall, that as the scroll declareth, a  great part of the Commissioners from Synods, Burrows, and gentle-men,  would not be present.    III. The Kings Majestie in his letter to _Perths_ Assembly, acknowledged  it was but a meeting, wherein disgrace was offered to his Majestie.    IV. The former corruptions of the foure preceding Assemblies had their  confluence in this and the subsequent Assembly.        _Reasons for annulling the pretended Assembly, holden at_ Perth, 1618.      I. The Assembly was indicted but twentie dayes before the holding of it:  and all parties requisit received not advertisement, as appeareth by their  absence. The untimous indicting of it, is cleared by Presbyterie books.    II. There was no election of the Moderatour, as was accustomed to be in  lawfull Assemblies; The register cleareth this.    III. No formall election of their new Clerk.    IIII. There were five whole Dioces absent, viz. _Orknay_, _Cathnes_,  _Rosse_, _Argyll_, and _Isles_: and many Presbyteries had no Commissioners  there, as the register of that pretended Assembly beareth.    V. There were nineteen noblemen and Barrons, eleven Bishops that had no  Commission from the Kirk. Whereas the act for constitution of Assemblies,  ordaineth every Burgh to have but one Commissioner, except _Edinburgh_,  which may have two (Act at _Dundie_ 1597) yet in that pretended Assembly,  _Perth_ had three Commissioners, _Dundie_, had two, _Glasgow_ had two, and  _St. Andrews_ had two: Of the Burghes, there were there six absent: And  for ruling Elders, there were none at all with commission from their  Presbyteries. All these things are cleared by the records of that  pretended Assemblie.    VI. The Commissioners from some Presbyteries exceeded their numbers  prescribed in the act at _Dundie_, 1597, for the Presbyterie of _Arbroth_  were foure Commissioners and three for the Presbyterie of _Aughterardour_:  Beside these that were heard to vote, having no commission at all, and  some who had commission were rejected, and were not enrolled, but others  put in their place without commission.    VII. The pretended Bishops did practice foure of the articles to be  concluded there, before the pretended Assembly, in _Edinburgh_, _St.  Andrews_, and other cathedral Churches, by keeping festival dayes,  kneeling at ye Communion. Thus their voices were prejudged by their  practice of these services before condemned by the Kirk, and therefore  they should have been secluded from voicing.    VIII. In all lawfull Assemblies, the voicing should be free: But in this  pretended Assembly there were no free voicing; for the voicers were  threatned to voice _affirmative_, under no lesse pain nor the wrath of  authoritie, imprisonment, banishemnt, deprivation of ministers, and utter  subversion of the state: Yea, it was plainly professed, that neither  reasoning nor the number of voices should carie the matter away: Which is  qualified by the declaration of many honest old reverend Brethren of the  ministery now present.    IX. In all lawful Assemblies, the grounds of proceeding were, and used to  be, the word of God, the confession of Faith, and acts of former general  Assemblies. But in this pretended Assembly, the ground of their proceeding  in voicing was the Kings commandment only: For so the question was stated:  _Whether the five articles, in respect of his Majesties commandement,  should passe in act, or not_: As the records of that pretended Assembly  beareth. Where it is declared, that for the reverence and respect which  they bear unto his Majesties Royal commandements, they did agree to the  foresaids articles.    X. Many other reasons verifying the nullitie of all these Assemblies, were  showen and proven before the Assembly, which needeth not here to be  insert.          Act. Sess. 13. December 5. 1638.        _Against the unlawfull oaths of intrants._      The six Assemblies immediately preceeding, for most just and weightie  reasons above-specified, being found to be unlawful, and null from the  beginning: The Assembly declareth the oathes and subscriptions exacted by  the Prelates of the intrants in the ministerie all this time by past (as  without any pretext of warrand from the Kirk, so for obedience of the acts  of these null Assemblies, and contrare to the ancient and laudable  constitutions of this Kirk, which never have been nor can be lawfully  repealled, but must stand in force) to be unlawful, and no way  obligatorie. And in like manner declareth, that the power of Presbyteries,  and of provincial and general Assemblies, hath been unjustly surpressed,  but never lawfully abrogate. And therefore that it hath been most lawful  unto them, not withstanding any point unjustly objected by the Prelats to  the contrare, to admit, suspend, or deprive ministers, _respective_ within  their bounds, upon relevant complaints sufficiently proven; to choose  their own Moderatours, and to execute all the parts of ecclesiastical  jurisdiction according to their own limits appointed them by the Kirk.          Act. Sess. 14. December 6. 1638.        _Condemning the Service-book, Book of Canons, Book of Ordination, and the  high Commission._      I. The Assembly having diligently considered the Book of common prayer,  lately obtruded upon the reformed Kirk within this Realme, both in respect  of the manner of the introducing thereof, and in respect of the matter  which it containeth, findeth that it hath been devised and brought in by  the pretended Prelats, without direction from the Kirk, and pressed upon  ministers without warrand from the Kirk, to be universally received as the  only forme of divine service under all highest paines, both civill and  ecclesiasticall, and the book it self, beside the _popish_ frame and forms  in divine worship, to containe many _popish_ errours and ceremonies, and  the seeds of manifold and grosse superstition and idolatrie. The Assembly  therefore all in one voice, hath rejected, and condemned and by these  presents doth reject and condemne the said book, not only as illegally  introduced, but also as repugnant to the doctrine, discipline and order of  this reformed Kirk, to the Confession of Faith, constitutions of generall  Assemblies, and acts of Parliament establishing the true Religion; and  doth prohibite the use and practice thereof: and ordaine Presbyteries to  proceed with the censure of the Kirk against all such as shall  transgresse.    II. The Assembly also, taking to their consideration the book of Canons,  and the manner how it hath been introduced, findeth that it hath been  devised by the pretended Prelats, without warrand or direction from the  generall Assembly; and to establish a tyrannicall power in the persons of  the pretended Bishops, over the worship of God, mens consciences,  liberties and goods, and to overthrow the whole discipline and government  of the generall and Synodall Assemblies, Presbyteries, and Sessions  formerly established in our Kirk.    Therefore the Assembly all in one voice hath rejected and condemned, and  by these presents doth reject and condemne the said book, as"]]]
