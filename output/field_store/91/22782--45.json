[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28402"],[0,"The Sexual Life of the Child (#7)"],[1,"  This external secretion of the testicles does, however, receive the  admixture of a number of other secretions, to constitute the semen as  actually discharged, viz., the secretion of the prostate gland, that of  the seminal vesicles, Cowper's glands, and the glands of the vasa  deferentia, and perhaps also that of the glands of Littre. The term  semen is, indeed, often applied to the secretion of the testicles alone;  but to avoid misunderstanding, Fuerbringer[8] recommends that only the  mixed secretion, as actually discharged, should be spoken of as the  semen, and that this term should never be employed to denote the  testicular secretion alone.    In what has gone before, I have not only described the structure of the  male sexual organs, but have alluded also in passing to their functions.  These latter must, however, be described more fully. Let us begin with  _erection_, which, as we saw, is due to distension of the penis with  blood. How is this distension brought about? It results from stimulation  of the erection centre. Until recently, it was supposed that this centre  was situated in the lumbar enlargement of the spinal cord; but now,  owing to the researches of L. R. Mueller, it is believed to form part of  the sympathetic plexuses of the pelvis. Stimulation of the centre leads  to distension of the penis with blood, and thus to erection of that  organ. The stimulation of the centre can be effected in either of two  ways.    In the first place, by psychical processes. Thus, in a man, the sight of  a woman exercises such a stimulus, the stimulation proceeding from the  brain along the spinal cord to reach the centre. The psychical stimulus  may also consist of reminiscences. In this way the memory of an  attractive woman may be just as effective in causing erection as if she  were actually visible at the moment; reading erotic literature may have  the same result. When the sexual impulse is perverted, the ideas causing  erection will naturally be themselves of a perverse character. Thus, in  the homosexual male, erection occurs at the sight or remembrance of a  man; in the fetichist, the idea of the fetich is operative--in the case  of the body-linen fetichist, for instance, the idea of articles of  underclothing.    In the second place, the activity of the erection centre can be aroused  by physical stimuli. To this category belong masturbatory manipulations,  stimulation of the glans penis and other parts of the genital organs.  But other erogenic areas exist, the stimulation of which produces the  same results. Among these areas, the buttocks must be particularly  mentioned. But individual peculiarities play a great part in this  connexion. Thus, in many persons, a slight stimulation of the nape of  the neck, of the scalp, &c., has an erogenic effect. In all cases alike,  the stimulus is conducted along the sensory nerves to the erection  centre, and it is the stimulation of this centre which by reflex action  leads to distension of the penis with blood and its consequent erection.  The physical stimulus leading to erection may also result from some  pathological process, such as inflammation of the penis or of the  urethra. Finally, certain internal physiological processes may be the  starting-point of the afferent physical stimuli leading to erection; for  example, distension of the bladder, and also of the seminal vesicles,  and of the seminiferous tubules of the testicle. In addition, it is  probable that many of the processes of growth occurring in the  reproductive glands act in a similar way. These internal stimuli all  pass to the erection centre along the afferent (sensory) nerves, and  induce erection by reflex action; and it is important to bear in mind  that this effect may result without any direct affection of  consciousness by the originating afferent impulses.    Although either kind of stimuli, psychical or physical, acting alone,  may give rise to erection, experience shows that in most instances the  two varieties co-operate in the production of this effect. Thus, in the  sexually mature man, the accumulation of semen in the seminal vesicles  gives rise, not only to excitement of the erection centre, but also to  voluptuous ideas, and these latter, in their turn, further stimulate the  erection centre.    Normally, during coitus, erection is followed by _ejaculation_. A  special nerve centre for ejaculation is also supposed to exist; and the  ejaculation centre, like the erection centre, was formerly believed to  be situated in the lumbar enlargement of the spinal cord, but recent  investigations have shown that it also most probably forms part of the  sympathetic plexuses of the pelvis. This centre also may be stimulated  either by psychical or by physical stimuli. In normal conditions,  however, much more powerful stimuli are needed to cause ejaculation than  those which are competent to give rise to erection. For this reason,  erections often occur without leading to ejaculation, whereas in normal  conditions ejaculation hardly ever occurs without erection. In fact,  ejaculation in the absence of erection is almost peculiar to  pathological states, and may occur, for instance, in many forms of  impotence, in which the ejaculation centre still remains susceptible to  stimulation, whilst the erection centre is exhausted. Whereas  stimulation of the erection centre exercises its reflex influence  through the vasomotor nerves, thus leading to distension of the penis  with blood, the reflex impulses resulting from stimulation of the  ejaculation centre are transmitted by the motor nerves to certain  muscles--those, namely, whose contraction forcibly expels the  accumulated semen. The contractions of the affected muscles occur  rhythmically, the stimulation of the ejaculation centre giving rise to a  series of contractions alternating with relaxations. True ejaculation,  resulting from the activity of these muscles, must be distinguished from  the appearance of a drop or two of fluid at the urethral meatus, which  occasionally occurs at the outset of sexual excitement--the so-called  _urethrorrhoea ex libidine_. This fluid runs out while the ejaculatory  muscles are quiescent. It was formerly believed that it consisted of the  secretion of the prostate gland; but Fuerbringer, to whom we are indebted  for the most valuable researches in this province, has shown that this  view is erroneous. These drops are, he states, derived solely from the  glands of Littre and the glands of Cowper (urethral and suburethral  glands).    Sexual excitement is accompanied throughout by a sensation of pleasure,  specifically known as _voluptuous pleasure_, the _voluptuous sensation_,  or simply _voluptuousness_ (in Latin, _libido sexualis_). Several stages  of the voluptuous sensation must be distinguished: its onset; the  equable voluptuous sensation; the voluptuous acme, coincident with the  rhythmical contraction of the perineal muscles and the ejaculation of  the semen; and, finally, the quite sudden diminution and cessation of  the voluptuous sensation. Associated with the last stage we usually have  a sense of satisfaction, and simultaneously a cessation of the sexual  impulse; a sense of ease and calm ensues, and at the same time a feeling  of fatigue. This voluptuous sensation localised in the genital organs  must, of course, be distinguished from the general sense of pleasure  produced in a man by the idea of, or by contact with, a woman in whom he  is sexually interested.    Now let us pass on to the consideration of the reproductive organs in  the female. The most conspicuous part of the external genital organs  consists of two large folds, situated on either side of the median line,  and known as the _labia majora_. Within these are two much smaller  folds, the _labia minora_ or _nymphae_. In the median line, in the space  between the labia minora, we see two apertures: the anterior of these is  the _urethral orifice_ (_meatus_), from which the comparatively short  and almost straight urethra of the female passes upwards and backwards  to the bladder; the posterior aperture is the _vaginal orifice_. The  labia minora, divergent posteriorly, converge as they pass forwards like  the limbs of a V; at the apex of the V is the _clitoris_; in shape and  structure this resembles the penis of the male, but it is much smaller,  and is solid, not being perforated by the urethra. It contains two  _corpora cavernosa_, which unite to form the _body_ of the organ, whilst  the distal extremity is known as the _glans_, and is homologous to the  glans penis. Posteriorly to the clitoris, and beneath the mucous  membrane on either side, is an additional mass of erectile tissue, known  as the _vaginal bulb_, or _bulb of the vestibule_. Just outside the  vaginal orifice on either side are visible the orifices of the ducts of  _Bartholin's glands_ (known also as _Duverney's glands_); these are  homologous with Cowper's glands in the male.    When we attempt to pass from the vaginal orifice to the internal  reproductive organs, we find that in the virgin an obstacle exists, the  _hymen_ or _maidenhead_, consisting of a duplicature of the mucous  membrane. It is very variable in form, but in the great majority of  instances it diminishes the size of the vaginal inlet to such an extent  as to render coitus impossible until the hymen has been torn. Through  the vaginal orifice access is gained to the interior of the _vagina_, a  tubular structure, but flattened from before backwards, so that in the  quiescent state the anterior and posterior walls of the passage are in  apposition. The _uterus_ or _womb_ is a muscular, pear-shaped organ,  with an elongated central cavity, which opens into the upper part of the  vagina. At the upper end of the cavity of the uterus are two small  laterally placed apertures, which lead into the _Fallopian tubes_ (or  _oviducts_). These tubes pass outwards in a somewhat sinuous"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28434"],[0,"The Astronomy of Milton's 'Paradise Lost' (#7)"],[1,"and influential, was intensified by the bitterness and  sarcasm which he imparted into his controversies, and the attitude  assumed by his enemies at last became so threatening that he deemed it  prudent to resign the Chair of Mathematics in the University of Pisa.    In the following year he was appointed to a similar post at Padua, where  his fame attracted crowds of pupils from all parts of Europe.    In 1611 Galileo visited Rome. He was received with much distinction by  the different learned societies, and was enrolled a member of the  Lyncaean Academy. In two years after his visit to the capital he  published a work in which he declared his adhesion to the Copernican  theory, and openly avowed his disbelief in the astronomical facts  recorded in the Scriptures. Galileo maintained that the sacred writings  were not intended for the purpose of imparting scientific information,  and that it was impossible for men to ignore phenomena witnessed with  their eyes, or disregard conclusions arrived at by the exercise of their  reasoning powers.    The champions of orthodoxy having become alarmed, an appeal was made to  the ecclesiastical authorities to assist in suppressing this recent  astronomical heresy, and other obnoxious doctrines, the authorship of  which was ascribed to Galileo.    In 1615, Galileo was summoned before the Inquisition to reply to the  accusation of heresy. 'He was charged with maintaining the motion of the  Earth and the stability of the Sun; with teaching this doctrine to his  pupils; with corresponding on the subject with several German  mathematicians; and with having published it, and attempted to reconcile  it to Scripture in his letters to Mark Velser in 1612.'    These charges having been formally investigated by the Inquisition,  Cardinal Bellarmine was authorised to communicate with Galileo, and  inform him that unless he renounced the obnoxious doctrines, and  promised 'neither to teach, defend, or publish them in future,' it was  decreed that he should be committed to prison. Galileo appeared next day  before the Cardinal, and, without any hesitation, pledged himself that  for the future he would adhere to the pronouncement of the Inquisition.    Having, as they imagined, silenced Galileo, the Inquisition resolved to  condemn the entire Copernican system as heretical; and in order to  effectually accomplish this, besides condemning the writings of Galileo,  they inhibited Kepler's 'Epitome of the Copernican System,' and  Copernicus's own work, 'De Revolutionibus Orbium Celestium.'    Whether it was that Galileo regarded the Inquisition as a body whose  decrees were too absurd and unreasonable to be heeded, or that he  dreaded the consequences which might have followed had he remained  obstinate, we know that, notwithstanding the pledges which he gave, he  was soon afterwards engaged in controversial discussion on those  subjects which he promised not to mention again.    On the accession of his friend Cardinal Barberini to the pontifical  throne in 1623, under the title of Urban VIII., Galileo undertook a  journey to Rome to offer him his congratulations upon his elevation to  the papal chair. He was received by his Holiness with marked attention  and kindness, was granted several prolonged audiences, and had conferred  upon him several valuable gifts.    Notwithstanding the kindness of Pope Urban and the leniency with which  he was treated by the Inquisition, Galileo, having ignored his pledge,  published in 1632 a book, in dialogue form, in which three persons were  supposed to express their scientific opinions. The first upheld the  Copernican theory and the more recent philosophical views; the second  person adopted a neutral position, suggested doubts, and made remarks of  an amusing nature; the third individual, called Simplicio, was a  believer in Ptolemy and Aristotle, and based his arguments upon the  philosophy of the ancients.    As soon as this work became publicly known, the enemies of Galileo  persuaded the Pope that the third person held up to ridicule was  intended as a representation of himself--an individual regardless of  scientific truth, and firmly attached to the ideas and opinions  associated with the writings of antiquity.    Almost immediately after the publication of the 'Dialogues' Galileo was  summoned before the Inquisition, and, notwithstanding his feeble health  and the infirmities of advanced age, he was, after a long and tedious  trial, condemned to abjure by oath on his knees his scientific beliefs.    'The ceremony of Galileo's abjuration was one of exciting interest and  of awful formality. Clothed in the sackcloth of a repentant criminal,  the venerable sage fell upon his knees before the assembled cardinals,  and, laying his hand upon the Holy Evangelists, he invoked the Divine  aid in abjuring, and detesting, and vowing never again to teach the  doctrines of the Earth's motion and of the Sun's stability. He pledged  himself that he would nevermore, either in words or in writing,  propagate such heresies; and he swore that he would fulfil and observe  the penances which had been inflicted upon him.' 'At the conclusion of  this ceremony, in which he recited his abjuration word for word and then  signed it, he was conveyed, in conformity with his sentence, to the  prison of the Inquisition.'[2]    Galileo's sarcasm, and the bitterness which he imparted into his  controversies, were more the cause of his misfortunes than his  scientific beliefs. When he became involved in difficulties he did not  possess the moral courage to enable him to abide by the consequences of  his acts; nor did he care to become a martyr for the sake of science,  his submission to the Inquisition having probably saved him from a fate  similar to what befell Bruno. Though it would be impossible to justify  Galileo's want of faith in his dealings with the Inquisition, yet one  cannot help sympathising deeply with the aged philosopher, who, in this  painful episode of his life, was compelled to go through the form of  making a retractation of his beliefs under circumstances of a most  humiliating nature.    But the persecution of Galileo did not delay the progress of scientific  inquiry nor retard the advancement of the Copernican theory, which,  after the discovery by Newton of the law of gravitation, was universally  adopted as the true theory of the solar system.    Ferdinand, Duke of Tuscany, having exerted his influence with Pope Urban  on behalf of Galileo, he was, after a few days' incarceration, released  from prison, and permission was given him to reside at Siena, where he  remained for six months. He was afterwards allowed to return to his  villa at Arcetri, and, though regarded as a prisoner of the Inquisition,  was permitted to pursue his studies unmolested for the remainder of his  days.    Galileo died at Arcetri on January 8, 1642, when in the seventy-eighth  year of his age.    Though not the inventor, he was the first to construct a refracting  telescope and apply it to astronomical research. With this instrument  he made a number of important discoveries which tended to confirm his  belief in the truthfulness of the Copernican theory.    On directing his telescope to the Sun, he discovered movable spots on  his disc, and concluded from his observation of them that the orb  rotated on his axis in about twenty-eight days. He also ascertained that  the Moon's illumination is due to reflected sunlight, and that her  surface is diversified by mountains, valleys, and plains.    On the night of January 7, 1610, Galileo discovered the four moons of  Jupiter. This discovery may be regarded as one of his most brilliant  achievements with the telescope; and, notwithstanding the improvement in  construction and size of modern instruments, no other satellite was  discovered until near midnight on September 9, 1892, when Mr. E. E.  Barnard, with the splendid telescope of the Lick Observatory, added  'another gem to the diadem of Jupiter.'    The phases of Venus and Mars, the triple form of Saturn, and the  constitution of the Milky Way, which he found to consist of a countless  multitude of stars, were additional discoveries for our knowledge of  which we are indebted to Galileo and his telescope. Galileo made many  other important discoveries in mechanical and physical science. He  detected the law of falling bodies in their accelerated motion towards  the Earth, determined the parabolic law of projectiles, and  demonstrated that matter, even if invisible, possessed the property of  weight.    In these pages a short historical description is given of the progress  made in astronomical science from an early period to the time in which  Milton lived. The discoveries of Copernicus, Kepler, and Galileo had  raised it to a position of lofty eminence, though the law of  gravitation, which accounts for the form and permanency of the planetary  orbits, still remained undiscovered. Theories formerly obscure or  conjectural were either rejected or elucidated with accuracy and  precision, and the solar system, having the Sun as its centre, with his  attendant family of planets and their satellites revolving in majestic  orbits around him, presented an impressive spectacle of order, harmony,  and design.          CHAPTER II    ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY      The seventeenth century embraces the most remarkable epoch in the whole  history of astronomy. It was during this period that those wonderful  discoveries were made which have been the means of raising astronomy to  the lofty position which it now occupies among the sciences. The  unrivalled genius and patient labours of the illustrious men whose names  stand out in such prominence on the written pages of the history of this  era have rendered it one of the most interesting and elevating of  studies. Though Copernicus lived in the preceding century, yet the names  of Tycho Brahe, Kepler, Galileo, and Newton,"]]]
