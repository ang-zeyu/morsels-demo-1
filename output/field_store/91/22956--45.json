[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37595"],[0,"Ecological Studies of the Timber Wolf in Northeastern Minnesota (#7)"],[1,"s.    Two direct cases of intolerance were observed, both involving the  radiotagged pack and other wolves within the usual range of the pack.  Following is a direct quote from the field notes of Mech:         \"Feb. 7, 1969--about 11:30 a.m.--aerial and visual--1059 and       2 other wolves traveling overland about halfway between       Heart L. and August L. (R10W-T61 N. Sect. 17 center). They       were traveling quickly and intently along a fresh wolf       trail, with a lighter reddish individual in the lead. The       other 2 animals were darker colored, and one of them was       smaller than the other. One of them must have been 1059.         \"We soon found that about half a mile ahead of the pack was       a dark wolf hurrying away from the three. This animal often       looked back and ran whenever it encountered good running       conditions. It soon became obvious that the pack of 3 was       chasing this individual. Because it [the lone wolf] often       broke its own trail, the pack gradually gained on this       animal. The single wolf flushed a deer which ran when the       wolf was about 75 feet away and floundered in the snow, but       the wolf continued hurrying on by.         \"Although the deer ran only about 50 yards and stopped, the       pack of 3 also hurried on by. The single wolf flushed       another deer, ignored it, and continued by, as did the pack       of 3. The chase continued for 2 miles as we watched, into       the N.E. corner of Sect. 18 and then into the N. Central       part of Sect. 8, and the pack got to within 150 yards of the       single wolf.         \"However, at this point, the 2 darker members of the pack       had fallen about 100 yards behind the lead one. The lead       animal stopped and waited for them, as it had done a few       times before. It then turned around and headed back to these       animals. When they met, the reddish animal's tail was held       vertically and there was much tail wagging by all for about       1 minute. Then all animals lay down for a minute and then       went up on a knoll. There was much activity and 'playing' on       the knoll. (12:10 p.m.)         \"The single wolf continued running and looking back for at       least another mile. We left at 12:21 p.m.         \"At 4:07 p.m. we saw a single wolf running across a small       lake and looking behind it about 8 miles N.W. of these       animals. The creature behaved the same as the one being       chased today, and we wondered whether it could be the same       animal.\"    On February 18, 1969, Ream made a similar observation, as follows  (quoted from his field notes):         \"Got visual sighting on 1059 with 3 other wolves at 11:55       about a mile west of Omaday Lake and they were running along       fairly fast on a trail. When we circled a second time we saw       2 wolves curled up sleeping on a knoll ahead (south) of the       running pack. We then realized the running wolves were on       the trail of the sleeping wolves and when the pack of 4 with       'red' in the lead was about 50 yards from the knoll the 2       sleeping wolves jumped up and charged away in the opposite       direction full tilt, and split and went in 2 directions.       When the pack reached the knoll they started off on the       trail of the wolf that headed N.E. and then changed and went       after the one that headed S.W. The reddish wolf was in the       lead and really picked up the pace. Although the reddish       wolf seemed to gain on the chased one 3 or 4 times, the pack       as a whole couldn't catch up, even though the single was       breaking trail. The reddish wolf, after gaining, always       stopped and waited for the others or went back to find them.       They chased this wolf for 2-1/2 to 3 miles, all the way down       to Highway 1 at a point 3.0 miles from the lab [Kawishiwi       Field Station, U.S. Forest Service]. There was a dense       patch, 10-15 acres, of woods just before Highway 1 and we       lost sight of the chased wolf for a while and also the 4       when they entered it, but shortly we found that the chased       one had somehow doubled back and was heading N.E. again. The       pack was apparently confused for at one point 3 of them were       wandering back and forth on Highway 1, apparently looking       for the trail of the chased wolf. Two of these paralleled       the Highway for a couple hundred yards and then stopped on       top of a hill, apparently resting. During this chase both       the single wolf and the pack chased up deer from their route       of travel and didn't seem to pay much attention to them,       even though some were really floundering in the deep snow.       We finally stopped watching all of this at 1:30 p.m. and       proceeded on our rounds.\"    On February 21 we also saw a single wolf running and looking behind  several times on Ojibway Lake. Even when it saw a fisherman on the lake  within 1/8 mile, it continued across to the opposite shore seeming most  intent on avoiding whatever was on its trail. Presumably it had also  been chased by a pack.    The cases of tolerance or indifference that we witnessed between wolves  involved our lone animals. On January 27, 1051 was at a kill he had  made the day before, and another wolf was sitting within 100 feet  looking toward the carcass. Eventually the unidentified wolf left  without approaching any closer. A lone wolf was also seen near 1053 in  the general vicinity of a moose carcass, which probably both were  feeding on at different times. Three such observations were made, on  February 10, 15, and 18; and on February 21 another wolf was also seen  near 1053 some 2.5 miles away from the moose carcass. In all cases, the  two animals were 80 to 200 yards apart in open country and must have  been aware of each other's presence.      Hunting, Killing, and Feeding Behavior    The primary prey of most wolves in our study area is the white-tailed  deer (fig. 29), but some moose (fig. 30) are also killed. We have  examined the remains of six moose that were eaten by wolves, two of  which were killed by them (fig. 31). One was found on February 25,  1967, on Gillis Lake and the other on March 7, 1969, on Twinkle Lake.  These locations are within 3 miles of each other, suggesting that a  wolf pack in that area may be more accustomed to preying on moose than  other packs. The other four moose carcasses were found in other parts  of the study area, but circumstances were such that the causes of death  of those animals could not be determined. A discussion of the details  of wolf-moose relations in our study area must await the collection of  additional data.    [Illustration: _Figure 29.--The main prey of wolves in northern  Minnesota is the white-tailed deer. (Photo courtesy of L. D. Mech.)_]    [Illustration: _Figure 30.--Moose are also killed by wolves. (Photo  courtesy of Allan Taylor.)_]    [Illustration: _Figure 31.--Only a few wolf-killed moose were located  during the study. (Photo courtesy of Laurence Pringle.)_]    The remains of 93 wolf-killed deer, and 49 probable wolf-kills, were  examined for age, sex, and condition and were compared with a sample of  433 hunter-killed deer from the same general area. The wolf-killed deer  were generally much older than the hunter-kills and had a significantly  higher percentage of jaw and limb abnormalities (see Mech and Frenzel,  page 35).    Until recently the only observations of wolves hunting deer were those  reported by Stenlund (1955) for northern Minnesota. He described two  reports of actual observations and two reports of interpretations of  tracks in the snow, all successful hunts. Since that time several  descriptions of successful and unsuccessful hunts have also been  published (Mech 1966b, Rutter and Pimlott 1968, Pimlott _et al._ 1969,  Mech 1970). Nevertheless, many more observations must be made before  generalizations can be formed.    During the present study we were able to witness a number of hunts from  the air and piece together others based on tracks. The following  descriptions are quoted from the field notes of Mech:         \"26 January 1967. About 3/4 mile N.E. of Alice Lake.         \"Jack Burgess [pilot] and I were following a pack of 8       wolves, when at 4:15 they veered from their former line of       travel, about 30 deg. They were then about 200 yards from 2       deer. They began wagging their tails when about 175 yards       from the deer. One deer, on the edge of a steep bank, was       lying, but one was standing about 75 yards N. of it in open       hardwoods. The wolves continued toward the latter deer.         \"This deer remained standing in the same place until the       wolves approached to within about 100 feet of it. The lead       wolf stopped, when that distance from the deer, and the       others caught up but also stopped when within about 25 feet       behind the lead wolf. By this time the deer, whose body was       facing away from the wolves, had its head turned back over       its shoulder toward the wolves. The wolves and the deer       remained absolutely still while staring at each other, 100       feet apart, for 1-2 minutes, while we made several circles.         \"Suddenly the deer bolted, and instantly the wolves pursued.       I am fairly certain that it was the deer that bolted first,       but could be mistaken. The action was almost simultaneous.       The deer headed toward the other deer near the top of the       high bank. This animal had been lying but had arisen when       the wolves were about 150 yards away.         \"The lead wolf followed in the deer's trail, but the others       cut toward the bank. This flushed the second deer (near the       edge of the bank), which ran down the bank. Meanwhile when       the first deer reached the edge of the bank, it headed due       W. along the top of it. Only the lead wolf pursued this       animal. The other deer had"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37599"],[0,"The Legend of the Glorious Adventures of Tyl Ulenspiegel in the land of Flanders (#7)"],[1," blowing a pair of bagpipes. In front of him was a dog with  red hair howling dismally, because, as it seemed, he did not at  all appreciate the music which his master was making. The sun shone  brightly, and at the lad's side there stood a pretty young girl in  fits of laughter at the pitiful howling of the dog.    This then was the sight that met the eye of the beautiful lady and  her fat attendant as they passed in front of the cottage: none else  but Ulenspiegel blowing his pipes, and Nele in fits of laughter,  and Titus Bibulus Schnouffius howling with all his might.    \"You naughty boy,\" said the dame to Ulenspiegel, \"will you never stop  making this poor red-hair howl like this?\"    But Ulenspiegel, staring back at her, blew his pipes more valiantly  than ever, and Bibulus Schnouffius howled the more dismally, and Nele  laughed all the louder.    The lady's attendant grew angry, and pointed at Ulenspiegel, saying:    \"If I beat this wretched little imp of a man with the scabbard of my  sword he would give over his insolent row.\"    Ulenspiegel looked the attendant in the face and called him  \"Jan Papzak\" because of his fat belly, and went on blowing his  bagpipes. The attendant came up to him, and threatened him with his  fist. But Bibulus Schnouffius went for him straightway and bit him  in the leg, and the man fell down, crying for mercy:    \"Help, help!\"    The dame only smiled, and said to Ulenspiegel:    \"Tell me, my player of bagpipes, is the road still the same that  leads from Damme to Dudzeel?\"    But Ulenspiegel went on playing, and only nodded his head and stared.    \"Why do you look at me so fixedly?\" she asked him.    But he, still continuing to play, opened his eyes all the wider as  though transported by an ecstasy of admiration.    \"Are you not ashamed,\" she said, \"young as you are, to stare at  ladies so?\"    Ulenspiegel blushed faintly, but went on blowing his pipes, and  staring more than ever.    \"I have already asked you once,\" the lady insisted, \"whether the road  is still the same that leads from Damme to Dudzeel.\"    \"It is green no longer since you deprived it of the honour of carrying  you,\" Ulenspiegel answered.    \"Will you show me the way?\" said the lady.    But Ulenspiegel still remained sitting where he was, and still went  on staring at her. And she, seeing him so roguish, and knowing it  all for the gamesomeness of youth, forgave him willingly.    He got up at last, and began to walk back into the cottage.    \"Whither are you going?\" she asked him.    \"To put on my best clothes,\" he replied.    \"Very well,\" she said.    Then the lady sat herself down on the bench, close to the doorstep,  and tried to talk to Nele. But Nele would not answer her, for she  was jealous.    It was not long before Ulenspiegel returned, well washed and clothed  in fustian. He looked fine in his Sunday clothes, the little man.    \"Are you really going off with this fine lady?\" Nele asked him.    \"I shall soon be back,\" he told her.    \"Let me go instead of you,\" said Nele.    \"No,\" he said, \"the roads are muddy.\"    \"Why, little girl,\" said the lady, who was annoyed and jealous now  in her turn, \"why do you try to hinder him from coming with me?\"    Nele did not answer, but great tears gushed from her eyes, and she  gazed at the fine lady in sadness and in anger.    Then the four of them started off, the dame seated like a queen  upon her ambling palfrey, the attendant with his belly that shook  with every step, Ulenspiegel holding the lady's horse by the bridle,  and Bibulus Schnouffius walking at his side, tail proudly in air.    Thus went they on horseback and on foot for some long while. But  Ulenspiegel was not at his ease; dumb as a fish he sniffed the fine  scent of benjamin that floated from the lady, and saw out of the  corner of his eye all her beautiful gear, rare jewels and trinkets,  and the sweet expression of her face, her bright eyes, and bare neck,  and her hair that shone in the sunlight like a hood of gold.    \"Why are you so quiet, my little man?\" she asked him.    He answered nothing.    \"Do you keep your tongue so deep in your boots that you could not  take a message for me?\"    \"What is it?\" said Ulenspiegel.    \"I would have you leave me here,\" said the dame, \"and go to Koolkercke,  from whence this wind is blowing. There you will find a gentleman  dressed in black and red motley. Tell him that he must not expect  me to-day, but let him come to-morrow evening to my chateau, by the  postern gate, at ten o' the clock.\"    \"I will not go,\" said Ulenspiegel.    \"Why not?\" asked the lady.    \"I will not go, not I,\" Ulenspiegel said again.    \"What can it be,\" the lady asked him, \"what can it be that inspires  you with this unyielding will, you angry little cock?\"    \"I will not go,\" Ulenspiegel persisted.    \"But if I gave you a florin?\"    \"No,\" said he.    \"A ducat?\"    \"No.\"    \"A carolus!\"    \"No,\" Ulenspiegel repeated, \"although\"--and this was added with  a sigh--\"I should rather see it in my mother's purse than a  mussel-shell!\"    The dame laughed, then suddenly cried out in a loud voice:    \"My bag! I have lost my little bag! Beautiful it was and rare, made  of silk, and sown with fine pearls! It was hanging from my belt when  we were at Damme!\"    Ulenspiegel did not budge, but her attendant came up to his lady.    \"Madame,\" said he, \"whatever else you do, be careful not to send  this young robber to look for it, for so you will certainly never  see it again.\"    \"Who will go then?\" asked the lady.    \"I will,\" he answered, \"old as I am.\"    And away he went.    Midday had struck. It was very hot. The silence was  profound. Ulenspiegel said not a word, but taking off his new doublet  he laid it on the grass in the shade of a lime-tree, so that the dame  might sit down thereon without fear of the damp. He stood close by,  heaving a sigh.    She looked up at him, and felt compassion on that shy little figure,  and she inquired of him if he was not tired standing there upright  on his young legs. He did not answer, but slid gently down at her  side. She was desirous of resting him, and she drew his head on to her  bare neck, and there it lay so willingly that she would have thought  it the sin of cruelty itself had she bade him find some other pillow.    After a while the attendant came back, saying that he had not been  able to find the bag.    \"I have found it myself,\" replied the lady, \"for when I dismounted  from my horse, there it was hanging half open on the stirrup. And  now\"--this to Ulenspiegel--\"show us the way to Dudzeel, please,  and tell me your name.\"    \"My patron saint,\" he replied, \"is Monsieur Saint Thylbert, a name  which means fleet of foot towards that which is good; my second name  is Claes, and my surname Ulenspiegel. But now, if you would deign to  look at yourself in my mirror, you would see that in all the land of  Flanders there is not one flower so dazzling in its beauty as is the  scented grace of you.\"    The lady blushed with pleasure, and was not angry with Ulenspiegel.    But Soetkin and Nele sat at home, weeping together, through all this  long absence.              XVIII      When Ulenspiegel returned from Dudzeel and came to the entrance of  the town, he saw Nele standing there leaning with her back against the  toll-gate. She was picking the stones out of a bunch of black grapes,  which she munched one by one, and found therefrom, doubtless, much  delight and refreshment; nevertheless, she did not allow anything  of her enjoyment to appear on her countenance. On the contrary, she  seemed annoyed at something, tearing at the grapes angrily. She looked,  indeed, so sad and sorrowful, so sweetly unhappy, that Ulenspiegel  felt overcome with that pity which is almost love, and coming up to  her from behind, he printed a kiss on the nape of the girl's neck. But  all the return she gave him was a great box on the ear.    \"Now I shall not be able to see properly any more,\" he said.    She burst into tears.    \"O Nele,\" says he, \"are you going to set up fountains at the entrance  of all the villages?\"    \"Be off with you,\" says she.    \"But I can't go away and leave you crying like this, my little pet.\"    \"I am not your little pet,\" says Nele; \"neither am I crying.\"    \"No, you are not crying, but there is certainly some water coming  out of your eyes.\"    \"Will you go away?\" She turned on him.    \"No,\" he answered.    All the time she was holding her pinafore in her small trembling hand,  tearing at the stuff in little spasms of rage, and wetting it with  her tears.    \"Nele,\" said Ulenspiegel, \"when is it going to be fine again?\"    And he smiled at her very lovingly.    \"Why do you ask me that?\" she said.    \"Because when it is fine there is an end of weeping,\" answered  Ulenspiegel.    \"Go back to your beautiful lady of the brocaded gown,\" she said. \"Your  jokes are good enough for her....\"    Then Ulenspiegel sang:              When I see my love crying          My heart is torn.          When she smiles 'tis honey,          Pearls when she weeps.          Either way I love her.          And I'll draw a draught of wine,          Good wine from Louvain,          And I'll draw a draught of wine,          When Nele smiles again.      \"You villainous man!\" she cried, \"making fun of me again!\"    \"Nele,\" said Ulenspiegel, \"it is true that I am a man. But I am not  a villain. For our family is of noble origin, a family of aldermen,  and it carries on its shield three pint pots argent on a ground  bruinbier. But, Nele, tell me now, is it a fact that in Flanders when  a man sows a kiss he always reaps a box on the ear?\"    \"I refuse to speak to you,\" said Nele.    \"Then why open your mouth to tell me so?\"    \"I am angry,\" she said.    Ulenspiegel slapped her on the back very lightly with his hand, saying:    \"Kiss a naughty girl and she will cuff you; cuff her, she will  cry. Come then, sweet, cry upon my shoulder since I have cuffed you!\"    "]]]
