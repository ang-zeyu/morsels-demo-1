Some Patroclides in urgent need would not have to soil his cloak, but  could fly off, satisfy his requirements, and, having recovered his  breath, return. If one of you, it matters not who, had adulterous  relations and saw the husband of his mistress in the seats of the  senators, he might stretch his wings, fly thither, and, having appeased  his craving, resume his place. Is it not the most priceless gift of all,  to be winged? Look at Diitrephes!(18) His wings were only wicker-work  ones, and yet he got himself chosen Phylarch and then Hipparch; from  being nobody, he has risen to be famous; 'tis now the finest gilded cock  of his tribe.(19)      f(1) The actor, representing Procne, was a flute-player.    f(2) The parabasis.    f(3) A sophist of the island of Ceos, a disciple of Protagoras, as  celebrated for his knowledge as for his eloquence. The Athenians  condemned him to death as a corrupter of youth in 396 B.C.      f(4) Lovers were wont to make each other presents of birds. The cock and  the goose are mentioned, of course, in jest.    f(5) i.e. that it gave notice of the approach of winter, during which  season the Ancients did not venture to sea.    f(6) A notorious robber.    f(7) Meaning, \"We are your oracles.\" --Dodona was an oracle in  Epirus.--The temple of Zeus there was surrounded by a dense forest,  all the trees of which were endowed with the gift of prophecy; both the  sacred oaks and the pigeons that lived in them answered the questions of  those who came to consult the oracle in pure Greek.    f(8) The Greek word for 'omen' is the same as that for 'bird.'    f(9) A satire on the passion of the Greeks for seeing an omen in  everything.    f(10) An imitation of the nightingale's song.    f(11) God of the groves and wilds.    f(12) The 'Mother of the Gods'; roaming the mountains, she held dances,  always attended by Pan and his accompanying rout of Fauns and Satyrs.    f(13) An allusion to cock-fighting; the birds are armed with brazen  spurs.    f(14) An allusion to the spots on this bird, which resemble the scars  left by a branding iron.    f(15) He was of Asiatic origin, but wished to pass for an Athenian.    f(16) Or Philamnon, King of Thrace; the scholiast remarks that the  Phrygians and the Thracians had a common origin.    f(17) The Greek word here is also the name of a little bird.    f(18) A basket-maker who had become rich.--The Phylarchs were the  headmen of the tribes. They presided at the private assemblies and were  charged with the management of the treasury.--The Hipparchs, as the name  implies, were the leaders of the cavalry; there were only two of these  in the Athenian army.    f(19) He had become a senator.    PISTHETAERUS Halloa! What's this? By Zeus! I never saw anything so funny  in all my life.(1)      f(1) Pisthetaerus and Euelpides now both return with wings.    EUELPIDES What makes you laugh?    PISTHETAERUS 'Tis your bits of wings. D'you know what you look like?  Like a goose painted by some dauber-fellow.    EUELPIDES And you look like a close-shaven blackbird.    PISTHETAERUS 'Tis ourselves asked for this transformation, and, as  Aeschylus has it, \"These are no borrowed feathers, but truly our  own.\"(1)      f(1) Meaning, 'tis we who wanted to have these wings.--The verse from  Aeschylus, quoted here, is taken from 'The Myrmidons,' a tragedy of  which only a few fragments remain.    EPOPS Come now, what must be done?    PISTHETAERUS First give our city a great and famous name, then sacrifice  to the gods.    EUELPIDES I think so too.    EPOPS Let's see. What shall our city be called?    PISTHETAERUS Will you have a high-sounding Laconian name? Shall we call  it Sparta?    EUELPIDES What! call my town Sparta? Why, I would not use esparto for my  bed,(1) even though I had nothing but bands of rushes.      f(1) The Greek word signified the city of Sparta, and also a kind of  broom used for weaving rough matting, which served for the beds of the  very poor.    PISTHETAERUS Well then, what name can you suggest?    EUELPIDES Some name borrowed from the clouds, from these lofty regions  in which we dwell--in short, some well-known name.    PISTHETAERUS Do you like Nephelococcygia?(1)      f(1) A fanciful name constructed from (the word for) a cloud,  and (the word for) a cuckoo; thus a city of clouds and  cuckoos.--'Wolkenkukelheim' is a clever approximation in German.  Cloud-cuckoo-town, perhaps, is the best English equivalent.    EPOPS Oh! capital! truly 'tis a brilliant thought!    EUELPIDES Is it in Nephelococcygia that all the wealth of Theovenes(1)  and most of Aeschines'(2) is?      f(1) He was a boaster nicknamed 'smoke,' because he promised a great  deal and never kept his word.    f(2) Also mentioned in 'The Wasps.'    PISTHETAERUS No, 'tis rather the plain of Phlegra,(1) where the gods  withered the pride of the sons of the Earth with their shafts.      f(1) Because the war of the Titans against the gods was only a fiction  of the poets.    EUELPIDES Oh! what a splendid city! But what god shall be its patron?  for whom shall we weave the peplus?(1)      f(1) A sacred cloth, with which the statue of Athene in the Acropolis  was draped.    PISTHETAERUS Why not choose Athene Polias?(1)      f(1) Meaning, to be patron-goddess of the city. Athene had a temple of  this name.    EUELPIDES Oh! what a well-ordered town 'twould be to have a female deity  armed from head to foot, while Clisthenes(1) was spinning!      f(1) An Athenian effeminate, frequently ridiculed by Aristophanes.    PISTHETAERUS Who then shall guard the Pelargicon?(1)      f(1) This was the name of the wall surrounding the Acropolis.    EPOPS One of us, a bird of Persian strain, who is everywhere proclaimed  to be the bravest of all, a true chick of Ares.(1)      f(1) i.e. the fighting cock.    EUELPIDES Oh! noble chick! What a well-chosen god for a rocky home!    PISTHETAERUS Come! into the air with you to help the workers who are  building the wall; carry up rubble, strip yourself to mix the mortar,  take up the hod, tumble down the ladder, an you like, post sentinels,  keep the fire smouldering beneath the ashes, go round the walls, bell in  hand,(1) and go to sleep up there yourself; then d(i)spatch two heralds,  one to the gods above, the other to mankind on earth and come back here.      f(1) To waken the sentinels, who might else have fallen asleep.--There  are several merry contradictions in the various parts of this list of  injunctions.    EUELPIDES As for yourself, remain here, and may the plague take you for  a troublesome fellow!    PISTHETAERUS Go, friend, go where I send you, for without you my orders  cannot be obeyed. For myself, I want to sacrifice to the new god, and I  am going to summon the priest who must preside at the ceremony. Slaves!  slaves! bring forward the basket and the lustral water.    CHORUS I do as you do, and I wish as you wish, and I implore you to  address powerful and solemn prayers to the gods, and in addition to  immolate a sheep as a token of our gratitude. Let us sing the Pythian  chant in honour of the god, and let Chaeris accompany our voices.    PISTHETAERUS (TO THE FLUTE-PLAYER) Enough! but, by Heracles! what is  this? Great gods! I have seen many prodigious things, but I never saw a  muzzled raven.(1)      f(1) In allusion to the leather strap which flute-players wore to  constrict the cheeks and add to the power of the breath. The performer  here no doubt wore a raven's mask.    EPOPS Priest! 'tis high time! Sacrifice to the new gods.    PRIEST I begin, but where is he with the basket? Pray to the Vesta of  the birds, to the kite, who presides over the hearth, and to all the god  and goddess-birds who dwell in Olympus.    CHORUS Oh! Hawk, the sacred guardian of Sunium, oh, god of the storks!    PRIEST Pray to the swan of Delos, to Latona the mother of the quails,  and to Artemis, the goldfinch.    PISTHETAERUS 'Tis no longer Artemis Colaenis, but Artemis the  goldfinch.(1)      f(1) Hellanicus, the Mitylenian historian, tells that this surname of  Artemis is derived from Colaenus, King of Athens before Cecrops and a  descendant of Hermes. In obedience to an oracle he erected a temple to  the goddess, invoking her as Artemis Colaenis (the Artemis of Colaenus).    PRIEST And to Bacchus, the finch and Cybele, the ostrich and mother of  the gods and mankind.    CHORUS Oh! sovereign ostrich, Cybele, The mother of Cleocritus,(1) grant  health and safety to the Nephelococcygians as well as to the dwellers in  Chios...      f(1) This Cleocritus, says the scholiast, was long-necked and strutted  like an ostrich.    PISTHETAERUS The dwellers in Chios! Ah! I am delighted they should be  thus mentioned on all occasions.(1)      f(1) The Chians were the most faithful allies of Athens, and hence their  name was always mentioned in prayers, decrees, etc.    CHORUS ...to the heroes, the birds, to the sons of heroes, to the  porphyrion, the pelican, the spoon-bill, the redbreast, the grouse, the  peacock, the horned-owl, the teal, the bittern, the heron, the stormy  petrel, the fig-pecker, the titmouse...    PISTHETAERUS Stop! stop! you drive me crazy with your endless list.  Why, wretch, to what sacred feast are you inviting the vultures and the  sea-eagles? Don't you see that a single kite could easily carry off the  lot at once? Begone, you and your fillets and all; I shall know how to  complete the sacrifice by myself.    PRIEST It is imperative that I sing another sacred chant for the rite of  the lustral water, and that I invoke the immortals, or at least one of  them, provided always that you have some suitable food to offer him;  from what I see here, in the shape of gifts, there is naught whatever  but horn and hair.    PISTHETAERUS Let us address our sacrifices and our prayers to the winged  gods.    A POET Oh, Muse! celebrate happy Nephelococcygia in your hymns.

The  substance is fleshy in _Boletus_, but in _Polyporus_ the greater  number of species are leathery or corky, and more persistent. The  basidia, spicules, and quaternate spores agree with those of  _Agaricini_.[L] In fact there are no features of importance which  relate to the hymenium in any order of _Hymenomycetes_ (the  _Tremellini_ excepted) differing from the same organ in _Agaricini_,  unless it be the absence of _cystidia_.    [Illustration: FIG. 5.--_Hydnum repandum._]    HYDNEI.--Instead of pores, in this order the hymenium is spread over  the surface of spines, prickles, or warts.[M]    AURICULARINI.--The hymenium is more or less even, and in--    CLAVARIEI the whole fungus is club-shaped, or more or less intricately  branched, with the hymenium covering the outer surface.    [Illustration: FIG. 6.--_Calocera viscosa._]    [Illustration: FIG. 7.--_Tremella mesenterica._]    TREMELLINI.--In this order we have a great departure from the  character of the substance, external appearance, and internal  structure of the other orders in this family. Here we have a  gelatinous substance, and the form is lobed, folded, convolute, often  resembling the brain of some animal. The internal structure has been  specially illustrated by M. Tulasne,[N] through the common species,  _Tremella mesenterica_. This latter is of a fine golden yellow colour,  and rather large size. It is uniformly composed throughout of a  colourless mucilage, with no appreciable texture, in which are  distributed very fine, diversely branched and anastomosing filaments.  Towards the surface, the ultimate branches of this filamentous network  give birth, both at their summits and laterally, to globular cells,  which acquire a comparatively large size. These cells are filled with  a protoplasm, to which the plant owes its orange colour. When they  have attained their normal dimensions, they elongate at the summit  into two, three, or four distinct, thick, obtuse tubes, into which the  protoplasm gradually passes. The development of these tubes is unequal  and not simultaneous, so that one will often attain its full  dimensions, equal, perhaps, to three or four times the diameter of the  generative cell, whilst the others are only just appearing. By  degrees, as each tube attains its full size, it is attenuated into a  fine point, the extremity of which swells into a spheroidal cell,  which ultimately becomes a spore. Sometimes these tubes, or spicules,  send out one or two lateral branches, each terminated by a spore.  These spores (about .006 to .008 _mm._ diameter) are smooth, and  deposit themselves, like a fine white dust, on the surface of the  _Tremella_ and on its matrix. M. Leveille[O] was of opinion that the  basidia of the Tremellini were monosporous, whilst M. Tulasne has  demonstrated that they are habitually tetrasporous, as in other of the  Hymenomycetes. Although agreeing in this, they differ in other  features, especially in the globose form of the basidia, mode of  production of the spicules, and, finally, the division of the basidia  into two, three, or four cells by septa which cut each other in their  axis. This division precedes the growth of the spicules. It is not  rare to see these cells, formed at the expense of an unilocular  basidium, become partly isolated from each other; in certain cases  they seem to have separated very early, they then become larger than  usual, and are grouped on the same filament so as to represent a kind  of buds. This phenomenon usually takes place below the level of the  fertile cells, at a certain depth in the mucous tissue of the  _Tremella_.    Besides the reproductive system here described, Tulasne also made  known the existence of a series of filaments which produce spermatia.  These filaments are often scattered and confused with those which  produce the basidia, and not distinguishable from them in size or any  other apparent characteristic, except the manner in which their  extremities are branched in order to produce the spermatia. At other  times the spermatia-bearing surface covers exclusively certain  portions of the fungus, especially the inferior lobes, imparting  thereto a very bright orange colour, which is communicated by the  layer of spermatia, unmixed with spores. These spots retain their  bright colour, while the remainder of the plant becomes pale, or  covered with a white dust. The spermatia are very small, spherical,  and smooth, scarcely equalling .002 _mm._ They are sessile, sometimes  solitary, sometimes three or four together, on the slightly swollen  extremities of certain filaments of the weft of the fungus.[P] Tulasne  found it impossible to make these corpuscles germinate, and in all  essential particulars they agreed with the spermatia found in  ascomycetous fungi.    In the genus _Dacrymyces_, the same observer found the structure to  have great affinity with that of _Tremella_. The spores in the species  examined were of a different form, being oblong, very obtuse, slightly  curved (.013 - .019 x .004 - .006 _mm._), at first unilocular, but  afterwards triseptate. The basidia are cylindrical or clavate, filled  with coloured granular matter; each of these bifurcates at the summit,  and gradually elongates into two very open branches, which are  attenuated above, and ultimately each is crowned by a spore. There are  to be found also in the species of this genus globose bodies,  designated \"sporidioles\" by M. Leveille, which Tulasne took  considerable care to trace to their source. He thus accounts for  them:--Each of the cells of the spore emits exteriorly one or several  of these corpuscles, supported on very short and very slender  pedicels, which remain after the corpuscles are detached from them,  new corpuscles succeeding the first as long as there remains any  plastic matter within the spore. The pedicels are not all on the same  plane; they are often implanted all on the same, and oftenest on the  convex side of the reproductive body. These corpuscles, though placed  under the most favourable conditions, never gave the least sign of  vegetation, and Tulasne concludes that they are spermatia, analogous  to those produced in _Tremella_. The spores which produce spermatia  are not at all apt to germinate, whilst those which did not produce  spermatia germinated freely. Hence it would appear that, although all  spores seem to be perfectly identical, they have not all the same  function. The same observer detected also amongst specimens of the  _Dacrymyces_ some of a darker and reddish tint, always bare of spores  or spermatia on the surface, and these presented a somewhat different  structure. Where the tissue had turned red it was sterile, the  constituent filaments, ordinarily colourless, and almost empty of  solid matter, were filled with a highly-coloured protoplasm; they were  of less tenuity, more irregularly thick, and instead of only rarely  presenting partitions, and remaining continuous, as in other parts of  the plant, were parcelled out into an infinity of straight or curved  pieces, angular and of irregular form, especially towards the surface  of the fungus, where they compose a sort of pulp, varying in cohesion  according to the dry or moist condition of the atmosphere. All parts  of these reddish individuals seemed more or less infected with this  disintegration, the basidia divided by transverse diaphragms into  several cylindrical or oblong pieces, which finally become free.  Transitional conditions were also observed in mixed individuals. This  sterile condition is called by Tulasne \"gemmiparous,\" and he believes  that it has ere now given origin to one or more spurious species, and  misled mycologists as to the real structure of perfect and fruitful  _Dacrymyces_.    PHALLOIDEI.--In this order the hymenium is at first enclosed within a  sort of peridium or universal volva, maintaining a somewhat globose or  egg-shape. This envelope consists of an outer and inner coat of  somewhat similar texture, and an intermediate gelatinous layer, often  of considerable thickness. When a section is made of the fungus,  whilst still enclosed in the volva, the hymenium is found to present  numerous cavities, in which basidia are developed, each surmounted by  spicules (four to six) bearing oval or oblong spores.[Q] It is very  difficult to observe the structure of the hymenium in this order, on  account of its deliquescent nature. As the hymenium approaches  maturity, the volva is ruptured, and the plant rapidly enlarges. In  _Phallus_, a long erect cellular stem bears the cap, over which the  hymenium is spread, and this expands enormously after escaping the  restraint of the volva. Soon after exposure, the hymenium deliquesces  into a dark mucilage, coloured by the minute spores, which drips from  the pileus, often diffusing a most loathsome odour for a considerable  distance. In _Clathrus_, the receptacle forms a kind of network. In  _Aseroee_, the pileus is beautifully stellate. In many the attractive  forms would be considered objects of beauty, were it not for their  deliquescence, and often foetid odour.[R]    [Illustration: FIG. 8.--Basidia and spores of _Phallus_.]    PODAXINEI.--This is a small but very curious group of fungi, in which  the peridium resembles a volva, which is more or less confluent with  the surface of the pileus. They assume hymenomycetal forms, some of  them looking like Agarics, Boleti, or species of _Hydnum_, with  deformed gills, pores, or spines; in _Montagnites_, in fact, the gill  structure is very distinct. The spores are borne in definite clusters  on short pedicels in such of the genera as have been examined.[S]    HYPOGAEI.--These are subterranean puff-balls, in which sometimes a  distinct peridium is present; but in most cases it consists entirely  of an external series of cells,"]]]
