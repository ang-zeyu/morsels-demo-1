The solid line indicates the number of voles per acre,  the broken line the percentage of females with a vaginal orifice and the  dotted line the inches of rainfall.]    A marked reduction in the percentage of females having vaginal orifices  was observed in the unusually dry summer of 1952. The rate of  reproduction was found to be positively correlated with rainfall (Fig.  9). Correlation coefficients were higher in each case when the amount of  rainfall in the month preceding each sampling period was used instead of  that in the month of the sample. This suggested that the rainfall  exerted its influence indirectly through its effect on plant growth.  Bailey (1924:530) reported that a reduction in either the quantity or  quality of food had a depressing effect on reproduction. Drought, such  as occurred in 1952, would certainly have a depressing effect on both.  The critical factor seems to be the supply of new, actively growing  shoots available to the voles for food rather than the total amount of  vegetation. As far as could be determined from the small sample of males  examined, their fecundity was not affected by rainfall. Some decrease in  the percentage of males that were fecund was noted in the winter and was  reported also by Jameson (1947:145) but most of the males in any sample  were fecund. Thus any depression in the reproductive rate was due to  loss of fecundity by females. This was in agreement with reports in the  literature on the subject (Baker and Ransom, 1932a:320; 1932b:43).    The correlation coefficient between rainfall and the percentage of adult  females with a vaginal orifice was 0.53. This was considered to be  surprisingly high in view of the expected effects on the breeding rate  of temperature, seasonal diet variations and whatever rhythms were  inherent in the voles. When only the summer months were considered the  correlation coefficient between rainfall and the percentage of adult  females with a vaginal orifice was 0.84. This indicated that, during the  season when breeding was at its height, rainfall was a factor in  determining the rate of reproduction and when rainfall was scarce, as in  the summer of 1952, it seemed to be a limiting factor (Fig. 9).    [Illustration: FIG. 9. Comparison between monthly rainfall and  reproductive rate of voles in summer. The dry summer of 1952 caused a  notable decrease in reproductive activity. The correlation coefficient  between rainfall and the percentage of females with a vaginal orifice  was 0.84.]    Of the total captures 20.6 per cent involved more than one individual.  When the distribution of these multiple captures was graphed for the  period of study, a high correlation between the percentage of captures  that were multiple and the percentage of females with a vaginal orifice  (r = 0.70) was found. An even higher correlation (r = 0.76) was observed  between the percentage of captures that were multiple and the population  density. The higher percentage of multiple captures may have been  largely a result of fewer available traps per individual on the area and  thus only indirectly related to the rate of reproduction.    Of the multiple captures, 66 per cent involved both sexes. The  correlation coefficient between the percentage of captures involving  both sexes and the level of reproductive activity was 0.58. Among those  pairs of individuals caught together more than once, 61 per cent were  composed of both sexes. Among those pairs taken together three or more  times 76 per cent were male and female and among those pairs taken  together four or more times 80 per cent were male and female. When adult  voles stayed together any length of time their relationship usually  appeared to be connected with sex. Family groups were also noted, as  pairs were often trapped which seemed to be mother and offspring. A  lactating female would sometimes enter a trap even after it had been  sprung by a juvenile, presumably her offspring, or a juvenal vole would  enter a trap after its mother had been captured. Such family groups  persisted only until the young voles had been weaned.    The youngest female known to be gravid was 26 days old and weighed 28  grams. During summer most of the females were gravid before they were  six weeks old, although females born in October and after were often  more than 15 weeks old before they became gravid. The youngest male  known to be fecund was approximately six weeks old. Male fecundity was  determined as described by Jameson (1950). Difference in the age of  attainment of sexual maturity serves to reduce the mating of litter  mates (Hamilton, 1941:7) and has been noticed in various species of the  genus _Microtus_ by several authors (Bailey, 1924:529; Hatfield,  1935:264; Hamilton, _loc. cit._; Leslie and Ransom, 1940:32).    For 35 females, each of which was caught at least once each month for  ten consecutive months or longer, the mean number of litters per year  was 4.07. Certain of the more productive members of the group produced  11 litters in 16 months. _M. ochrogaster_ seems to be less prolific than  _M. pennsylvanicus_. Bailey (1924:528) reported that one female meadow  vole delivered 17 litters in 12 months. Hamilton (1941:14) considered 17  litters per year to be the maximum and stated that in years when the  vole population was low the females produced an average of five to six  litters per year. In \"mouse years\" the average rose to eight to ten  litters per year. During this study several females delivered two or  more litters in rapid succession. This was noted more frequently in  spring and early summer than in other parts of the year. Those females  which produced two or three litters in rapid succession in spring and  early summer often did not litter again until fall. Post-parous  copulation has been observed in _M. pennsylvanicus_ by Bailey (1924:528)  and Hamilton (1940:429; 1949:259) and probably occurs also in _M.  ochrogaster_.    The gestation period was approximately 21 days, the same as reported for  _M. pennsylvanicus_ (Bailey, _loc. cit._; Hamilton, 1941:13) and _M.  californicus_ (Hatfield, 1935:264). A more precise study of the breeding  habits of _M. ochrogaster_ failed to materialize when the voles refused  to breed in captivity. Fisher (1945:437) also reported that _M.  ochrogaster_ failed to breed in captivity although _M. pennsylvanicus_  (Bailey, 1924) and _M. californicus_ (Hatfield, 1935) reproduced readily  in the laboratory.      Litter Size and Weight    In the course of this study 65 litters were observed. The mean number of  young per litter was 3.18 +- 0.24 and the median was three (Fig. 10).  Three litters contained but one individual and the largest litter  contained six individuals. Other investigators have reported the number  of young per litter in _M. ochrogaster_ as three or four (Lantz,  1907:18) and 3.4 (1-7) (Jameson, 1947:146). _M. pennsylvanicus_ seems to  have larger litters. Although Poiley (1949:317) found the mean size of  416 litters to be only 3.72 +- 0.18, both Bailey (1924:528) and Hamilton  (1941:15) found five to be the commonest number of young per litter in  that species. Leslie and Ransom (1940:29) reported the average number of  live births per litter to be 3.61 in the British vole, _M. agrestis_.  Selle (1928:96) reported the average size of five litters of _M.  californicus_ to be 4.8. Hatfield (1935:265), working with the same  species, found that litter size varied directly with the age of the  female producing the litter. He reported litters of young females as two  to four young per litter and of older females as five to seven young per  litter. In the litters of _M. ochrogaster_ that I examined, young  females did not have more than three young and usually had but two.  However, older females had litters of one, two and three often enough so  that no relationship, as described above, was indicated clearly.    [Illustration: FIG. 10. Distribution of litter size among 65 litters of  voles.]    No seasonal variation in litter size was noted. The mean size of the  litters in 1950, 2.68 +- 0.30, was significantly lower than that found in  1951 (3.76 +- 0.20) but neither differed significantly from the mean size  of litters in 1952 (3.35 +- 0.66). The lower mean size of litters was in  part coincidental with a high population level and the higher mean of  the two later years was in part coincidental with a low population  level. Since a sharp break in the curve for population density occurred  after the flood in July, 1951, the litters were arranged in pre-flood  and post-flood categories for study. Pre-flood litters averaged 3.07 +-  0.28 young per litter whereas post-flood litters averaged 3.34 +- 0.48.  This difference was not significant. Increase in litter size, if it had  actually occurred, might have been a response to the increasing food  supply and lower population density after the flood.    A difference in the mean number of young per litter was noted for those  litters delivered in traps as compared with those delivered in captivity  and the numbers of embryos examined in the uterus. The mean number of  embryos per female was higher than the mean number of young per litter  delivered in captivity and the mean number of young per litter delivered  in traps was lower than in those delivered in captivity. The differences  were not statistically significant. In some instances females that  delivered young voles in traps may have delivered others prior to  entering the trap or the mother or her trapmates may have eaten some of  the newborn voles before they were discovered.    The mean weight of 16 newborn (less than one day old) individuals was  2.8 +- 0.36 grams. No other data on the weight of newborn _M.  ochrogaster_ were found in the literature but this mean was close to the  3.0 grams (Bailey, 1924:530) and 2.07 grams (Hamilton, 1937a:504;  1941:10) reported for _M. pennsylvanicus_ and to the 2.7"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/39421"],[0,"Mount Everest, the Reconnaissance, 1921 (#7)"],[1," the  course at the point nearest its own home.    On May 13 Major Morshead with his assistant surveyors and fifty coolies  left Darjeeling for Khamba Dzong. They went the direct road up the  Teesta Valley correcting the Sikkim map as they went along. Their object  in going this way was to connect the Indian Survey with the new survey  that it was proposed to carry out in Tibet. This would occupy all Major  Morshead's time until we should be able to join him at Khamba Dzong in  June.    The chief transport of the Expedition consisted of 100 mules belonging  to the Supply and Transport Corps and lent to us by the  Commander-in-Chief. These arrived at Darjeeling a few days before we  were due to start and were camped in the open on the old parade ground  at the top of Katapahar. Sub-Conductor Taylor, who had already had  experience of mule transport in Tibet in 1904-5, and was to have come in  charge of them, was unfortunately laid up at the last moment with a bad  attack of influenza. The next man chosen was passed medically unfit, and  the third man in temporary charge of the mules was, when he arrived at  Darjeeling, already suffering from ague. It was not till May 15 that  Sergeant Fowkes arrived, who was to take charge of the mules. He was a  very capable and energetic N.C.O., and their subsequent failure was in  no way due to him, but solely to the fact that the mules were in no kind  of condition to do hard work in the hills, being sleek and fat from the  plains where they had had very little work to do. The muleteers, or  drabies, were all hill-men and had been picked out specially for us and  fitted out with every kind of warm clothing. Though there were a hundred  mules, this did not mean that there were a hundred mules to carry our  loads--so much extra warm clothing and blankets had been given to the  drabies that together with all their line gear it needed twenty-seven  mules to carry their kit, which left only seventy-three mules for the  Expedition loads, each mule carrying 160 lb., and this was not nearly  sufficient for our requirements. A certain amount of our stores had  therefore to be left behind at Government House, Darjeeling, for a  second journey, and we only took with us sufficient food and supplies  for three and a half months, relying on the mules going back and  returning with the remainder of the stores in July or August. Owing to  the camping grounds being small, and bungalow accommodation limited on  the journey across Sikkim, we divided ourselves into two parties with  fifty mules and twenty coolies in each party; Wollaston, Wheeler,  Mallory and myself being with the first party and Raeburn, Kellas,  Bullock and Heron with the second.    The first party left Darjeeling on May 18, and the second party the  following day. I remained behind to see the second party off, and then  by doing a double march I caught the first party up that evening at  Kalimpong, not, however, without noticing on the way that several of our  mules were already knocked up. The night before we started rain came  down in torrents, and it was still pouring when the mules came round in  the morning, and though the rain stopped soon afterwards yet the  hillsides were all wreathed in soft grey mists and every moss-hung  branch and tree dripped steadily with moisture all day long. The first  day's march from Darjeeling was to Peshoke--a seventeen-mile march and  down hill all the way after Ghoom. From Darjeeling we gradually ascended  some 500 feet to Ghoom and then for 6 miles followed the well-engineered  cart road which leads below Senchal to the new military cantonment of  Takda which is, I believe, about to be abandoned, as the Gurkhas, for  whom it was built, are not at all happy there. During the war it was  used as a German internment camp. Along this ridge there are magnificent  forests of evergreen oaks, all of which were covered with ferns and  orchids and long trailing mosses. This first ridge rising straight out  of the plains condenses all the moisture-laden winds that blow up from  the Bay of Bengal and causes it almost always to be enveloped in clouds  and mists. The path now rapidly descended 4,000 feet, through tea  plantations. The whole hillside was covered with tea bushes, neatly  planted in lines, and showing a very vivid green at this time of the  year. Here and there grew tall tree ferns, 20 feet to 30 feet in height,  their stems covered with ferns and Coelogene orchids. The air was now  growing hotter and hotter as we descended, but the wonderful and varied  vegetation, the beautiful and brilliantly coloured butterflies--for  which the Teesta Valley is famous--that flitted across the path in front  of us, proved an irresistible attraction, and made us forget the fact  that we were dripping with perspiration from every pore. We had already  descended nearly 5,000 feet by the time that we reached the P.W.D.  bungalow at Peshoke, which was situated in a clearing in the forest. We  were, however, still 2,000 feet above the muddy Teesta River which ran  down below us in its steamy gorge, and the next morning saw us  descending 2,000 feet through a Sal forest by a slippery path of clay  leading to the suspension bridge which crosses the mighty river that  with its affluents drains the whole of Sikkim. It rushes along with  irresistible force in mighty waves and rapids, and though attempts have  been made to float timber down it for commercial purposes, yet the  current is too swift and the logs were all smashed to pieces. Here at  the bridge we were only 700 feet above the sea and the heat was intense.  Several mules had been left exhausted at Peshoke and had been unable to  proceed the following day and several more only just reached Kalimpong,  the second day's march, only 12 miles from Peshoke, but the climb of  3,300 feet up from the bridge over the Teesta in the steamy and  enervating heat proved too much for them. The forests here were very  beautiful--huge sal trees and giant terminalia abounded with weird and  wonderful creepers embracing their stems, or hanging down from their  branches. The handsome pothos--the finest of the creepers--grew  everywhere. The curious pandanus or screw pine displayed its long and  picturesque fronds, while here and there among the dark green of the  tropical forest showed up as a brilliant patch of colour the scarlet  blooms of the clerodendrons. Above the forests the hillsides had been  terraced with immense labour into rice fields, which at this time of  year were not yet planted out, but the fields of maize were already  ripening. At Kalimpong there was a large and comfortable Dak bungalow,  surrounded by a well-kept garden full of roses and scarlet hibiscus with  a beautiful and large-flowered mauve solanum growing up the pillars on  the verandah. At Kalimpong we were entertained by Dr. Graham and his  charming daughters, who showed us true hospitality and kindness. They  live in a very pretty house embowered in roses on the crest of the hill  and commanding lovely views over the Teesta Valley and up to the snowy  peaks of Kanchenjunga. Higher up on the spur are the homes and the  industrial schools that many years of hard work have brought into  being, thanks to the indefatigable labours of Dr. Graham and the late  Mrs. Graham; these now hold between 600 and 700 pupils, both boys and  girls, who, when they leave these schools, have all been taught some  useful trade and are sent out as useful members of society. They are  given as practical an education as could be wished for anywhere. At the  Grahams' house I met David Macdonald, the British Trade Agent at Yatung,  who was acting temporarily as political agent in Sikkim until Major  Bailey arrived from England. He was an old friend of mine, as I had met  him before in Tibet. He promised us every assistance in his power and  had telegraphed to Yatung and to the Jongpen at Phari to have supplies  and anything we wanted in readiness at those places. He told me that an  old Tibetan Lama, who knew Mount Everest well, had described it as \"Miti  guti cha-phu long-nga,\" \"the mountain visible from all directions, and  where a bird becomes blind if it flies so high.\" Throughout our journey  across Sikkim the weather was very bad, with heavy falls of rain every  day and night. We had had the bad luck to strike the Chota Bursat, or  little monsoon, which usually heralds the coming of the proper monsoon a  fortnight or three weeks later.    The march to Pedong was an easy one of 14 miles with a gentle climb of  3,000 feet followed by a descent of 2,000 feet past gardens beautiful  with their great trees of scarlet hibiscus, daturas and bougainvilleas,  which grew with wonderful luxuriance in this climate where frost is  almost unknown in winter and where in summer the temperature scarcely  ever exceeds 85 deg. Fahrenheit. We passed some of the most wonderful datura  hedges that I have ever seen with trees 15 feet to 20 feet in height and  laden with hundreds of enormous white trumpet-shaped blooms 8 inches in  diameter and fully a foot long. I could only stand and admire. At night  these great white flowers glowed as though with phosphorescence in the  dark and had a strangely sweet smell. I got thoroughly soaked on the  march, for a couple of minutes of these deluges are sufficient to go  through any waterproof.    Our mules were now beginning to give us great trouble. Several had to be  left behind after each march and fresh animals had to be hired locally  to replace those left behind. At Pedong there were more wonderful  daturas, and all along the next march we kept passing grand bushes of  these flowers. It rained all that night and most of the following day,  so that we had a very wet and trying march to Rongli--the distance was  only 12 miles, but this included a very steep descent of over 3,000 feet  to the bottom of a steamy valley, followed by a climb of 3,000 feet  across an intervening ridge and"]]]
