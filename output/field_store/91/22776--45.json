They were not a handsome family;  they were not well dressed; their shoes were far from being waterproof;  their clothes were scanty; and Peter might have known, and very likely  did, the inside of a pawnbroker's. But they were happy, grateful,  pleased with one another, and contented with the time; and when they  faded, and looked happier yet in the bright sprinklings of the Spirit's  torch at parting, Scrooge had his eye upon them, and especially on Tiny  Tim, until the last.    By this time it was getting dark and snowing pretty heavily; and as  Scrooge and the Spirit went along the streets, the brightness of the  roaring fires in kitchens, parlors, and all sorts of rooms, was  wonderful. Here, the flickering of the blaze showed preparations for a  cosy dinner, with hot plates baking through and through before the fire,  and deep red curtains, ready to be drawn to shut out cold and darkness.  There, all the children of the house were running out into the snow to  meet their married sisters, brothers, cousins, uncles, aunts, and be the  first to greet them.    It was a great surprise to Scrooge, as he meditated on these scenes, to  hear a hearty laugh. It was a much greater surprise to Scrooge to  recognize it as his own nephew's, and to find himself in a bright, dry,  gleaming room, with the Spirit standing smiling by his side, and looking  at that same nephew with approving affability!    \"Ha! ha!\" laughed Scrooge's nephew. \"Ha! ha! ha!\"    If you should happen, by any unlikely chance, to know a man more blessed  in a laugh than Scrooge's nephew, all I can say is, I should like to  know him too. Introduce him to me, and I'll cultivate his acquaintance.    It is a fair, even-handed, noble adjustment of things that while there  is infection in disease and sorrow, there is nothing in the world so  irresistibly contagious as laughter and good-humor. When Scrooge's  nephew laughed in this way, holding his sides, rolling his head, and  twisting his face into the most extravagant contortions, Scrooge's  niece, by marriage, laughed as heartily as he. And their assembled  friends being not a bit behindhand, roared out lustily.    \"Ha, ha! Ha, ha, ha, ha!\"    \"He said that Christmas was a humbug, as I live!\" cried Scrooge's  nephew. \"He believed it, too.\"    \"More shame for him, Fred!\" said Scrooge's niece, indignantly. Bless  those women! they never do anything by halves. They are always in  earnest.    She was very pretty; exceedingly pretty. With a dimpled,  surprised-looking, capital face; a ripe little mouth that seemed made to  be kissed--as no doubt it was; all kinds of good little dots about her  chin, that melted into one another when she laughed; and the sunniest  pair of eyes you ever saw in any little creature's head. Altogether she  was what you would have called provoking, you know; but satisfactory,  too. Oh, perfectly satisfactory.    \"He's a comical old fellow,\" said Scrooge's nephew, \"that's the truth:  and not so pleasant as he might be. However, his offences carry their  own punishment, and I have nothing to say against him.\"    \"I have no patience with him,\" observed Scrooge's niece. Scrooge's  niece's sisters, and all the other ladies, expressed the same opinion.    \"Oh, I have!\" said Scrooge's nephew. \"I am sorry for him; I couldn't be  angry with him if I tried. Who suffers by his ill whims! Himself,  always. Here, he takes it into his head to dislike us, and he won't come  and dine with us. What's the consequence? He don't lose much of a  dinner.\"    \"Indeed, I think he loses a very good dinner,\" interrupted Scrooge's  niece. Everybody else said the same, and they must be allowed to have  been competent judges, because they had just had dinner; and with the  dessert upon the table, were clustered round the fire, by lamp-light.    \"Well! I am very glad to hear it,\" said Scrooge's nephew, \"because I  haven't any great faith in these young housekeepers. What do _you_ say,  Topper?\"    Topper had clearly got his eye upon one of Scrooge's niece's sisters,  for he answered that a bachelor was a wretched outcast, who had no right  to express an opinion on the subject. Whereat Scrooge's niece's  sister--the plump one with the lace tucker: not the one with the  roses--blushed.    \"Do go on, Fred,\" said Scrooge's niece, clapping her hands. \"He never  finishes what he begins to say! He is such a ridiculous fellow!\"    \"I was only going to say,\" said Scrooge's nephew, \"that the consequence  of his taking a dislike to us, and not making merry with us, is, as I  think, that he loses some pleasant moments, which could do him no harm.  I am sure he loses pleasanter companions than he can find in his own  thoughts, either in his mouldy old office, or his dusty chambers. I mean  to give him the same chance every year, whether he likes it or not, for  I pity him. He may rail at Christmas till he dies, but he can't help  thinking better of it--I defy him--if he finds me going there, in good  temper, year after year, and saying, 'Uncle Scrooge, how are you?' If it  only puts him in the vein to leave his poor clerk fifty pounds, _that's_  something; and I think I shook him yesterday.\"    It was their turn to laugh now, at the notion of his shaking Scrooge.  But being thoroughly goodnatured, and not much caring what they laughed  at, so that they laughed at any rate, he encouraged them in their  merriment.    After tea they had some music, Scrooge's niece played well; and played  among other tunes a simple little air (a mere nothing: you might learn  to whistle it in two minutes), which had been familiar to the child who  fetched Scrooge from the boarding-school, as he had been reminded by the  Ghost of Christmas Past. When this strain of music sounded, all the  things that the Ghost had shown him, came upon his mind; he softened  more and more; and thought that if he could have listened to it often,  years ago, he might have cultivated the kindnesses of life for his own  happiness with his own hands, without resorting to the sexton's spade  that buried Jacob Marley.    But they didn't devote the whole evening to music. After awhile they  played at forfeits; for it is good to be children sometimes, and never  better than at Christmas, when its mighty founder was a child himself.    Stop! There was first a glorious game at blindman's buff. Of course  there was. And I no more believe Topper was really blind than I believe  he had eyes in his boots. My opinion is, that it was a done thing  between him and Scrooge's nephew; and that the Ghost of Christmas  Present knew it. The way he went after that plump sister in the lace  tucker, was an outrage on the credulity of human nature. Knocking down  the fire-irons, tumbling over the chairs, bumping up against the piano,  smothering himself amongst the curtains, wherever she went, there went  he! He always knew where the plump sister was. He wouldn't catch anybody  else. If you had fallen up against him, (as some of them did) on  purpose, he would have made a feint of endeavoring to seize you, which  would have been an affront to your understanding, and would instantly  have sidled off in the direction of the plump sister. She often cried  out that it wasn't fair; and it really was not. But when at last, he  caught her; when, in spite of all her silken rustlings, and her rapid  flutterings past him, he got her into a corner whence there was no  escape; then his conduct was the most execrable. For his pretending not  to know her; his pretending that it was necessary to touch her  head-dress, and further to assure himself of her identity by pressing a  certain ring upon her finger, and a certain chain about her neck; was  vile, monstrous! No doubt she told him her opinion of it when, another  blind-man being in office, they were so very confidential together,  behind the curtains.    Scrooge's niece was not one of the blind-man's buff party, but was made  comfortable with a large chair and a footstool, in a snug corner where  the Ghost and Scrooge were close behind her. But she joined in the  forfeits, and loved her love to admiration with all the letters of the  alphabet. Likewise at the game of How, When, and Where, she was very  great, and, to the secret joy of Scrooge's nephew, beat her sisters  hollow: though they were sharp girls too, as Topper could have told you.  There might have been twenty people there, young and old, but they all  played, and so did Scrooge; for, wholly forgetting in the interest he  had in what was going on, that his voice made no sound in their ears, he  sometimes came out with his guess quite loud, and very often guessed  right, too; for the sharpest needle, warranted not to cut in the eye,  was not sharper than Scrooge; blunt as he took it in his head to be.    The Ghost was greatly pleased to find him in this mood, and looked upon  him with such favor, that he begged like a boy to be allowed to stay  until the guests departed. But this the Spirit said could not be done.  The whole scene passed off; and he and the Spirit were again upon their  travels.    Much they saw, and far they went, and many homes they visited, but  always with a happy end. The Spirit stood beside sick beds, and they  were cheerful; on foreign lands, and they were close at home; by  struggling men, and they were patient in their greater hope; by poverty,  and it was rich. In almshouse, hospital, and jail, in misery's every  refuge, where vain man in his little brief authority had not made fast  the door, and barred the Spirit out, he left his blessing, and taught  Scrooge his precepts.    It was a long night, if it were only a night; but Scrooge had his doubts  of this, because the Christmas Holidays appeared to be condensed into  the space of time they passed together. It was strange, too, that while  Scrooge remained unaltered in his outward form, the Ghost grew older,  clearly older!    \"Forgive me if I am not justified in what I ask,\" said Scrooge,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28216"],[0,"Respiration Calorimeters for Studying the Respiratory Exchange and Energy (#7)"],[1," however, to make a correction  for the heat developed, amounting usually to not far from 3 calories per  hour.    By means of a hand microphone and receiver, the subject can communicate  with the observers outside at will. A push-button and an electric bell  make it possible for him to call the observers whenever desired.      HEAT-ABSORBING CIRCUIT.    To bring away the heat produced by the subject, it is highly desirable  that a constant flow of water of even temperature be secured. Direct  connection with the city supply is not practicable, owing to the  variations in pressure, and hence in constructing the laboratory  building provision was made to install a large tank on the top floor,  fed with a supply controlled by a ball-and-cock valve. By this  arrangement the level in the tank is maintained constant and the  pressure is therefore regular. As the level of the water in the tank is  approximately 9 meters above the opening in the calorimeter, there is  ample pressure for all purposes.    [Illustration: FIG. 14.--Schematic diagram of water circuit for  heat-absorbers of calorimeter. A, constant-level tank from which water  descends to main pipe supplying heat-absorbers; _a_, valve for  controlling supply from tank A; B, section of piping passing into cold  brine; _b_, valve controlling water direct from large tank A; _c_, valve  controlling amount of water from cooling section B; C, thermometer at  mixer; D, electric heater for ingoing water; E, thermometer for ingoing  water; _d d d_, heat-absorbers inside calorimeter; F, thermometer  indicating temperature of outcoming water; G, can for collecting water  from calorimeter; _f_, valve for emptying G.]    The water descends from this tank in a large 2-inch pipe to the ceiling  of the calorimeter laboratory, where it is subdivided into three 1-inch  pipes, so as to provide for a water-supply for three calorimeters used  simultaneously, if necessary, and eliminate the influence of a variation  in the rate of flow in one calorimeter upon the rate of flow in another.  These pipes are brought down the inner wall of the room adjacent to the  refrigeration room and part of the water circuit is passed through a  brass coil immersed in a cooling-tank in the refrigeration room. By  means of a by-pass, water of any degree of temperature from 2 deg. C. to  20 deg. C. may be obtained. The water is then conducted through a pipe  beneath the floor to the calorimeter chamber, passed through the  absorbers, and is finally measured in the water-meter.    A diagrammatic sketch showing the course of the water-current is given  (fig. 14), in which A is the tank on the top floor controlled by the  ball cock and valve, and _a_ is the main valve which controls this  supply to the cooler B, and by adjusting the valve _b_ and valve _c_  any desired mixture of water can be obtained. A thermometer C gives a  rough idea of the temperature of the water, so as to aid in securing the  proper mixture. The water then passes under the floor of the calorimeter  laboratory and ascends to the apparatus D, which is used for heating it  to the desired temperature before entering the calorimeter. The  temperature of the water as it enters the calorimeter is measured on an  accurately calibrated thermometer E, and it then passes through the  absorber system _d d d_ and leaves the calorimeter, passing the  thermometer F, upon which the final temperature is read. It then passes  through a pipe and falls into a large can G, placed upon scales. When  this can is filled the water is deflected for a few minutes to another  can and by opening valve _f_ the water is conducted to the drain after  having been weighed.    _Brine-tank._--The cooling system for the water-supply consists of a  tank in which there is immersed an iron coil connected by two valves to  the supply and return of the brine mains from the central power-house.  These valves are situated just ahead of the valves controlling the  cooling device in the refrigeration room and permit the passage of brine  through the coil without filling the large coils for the cooling of the  air in the calorimeter laboratory. As the brine passes through this  coil, which is not shown in the figure, it cools the water in which it  is immersed and the water in turn cools the coil through which the  water-supply to the calorimeter passes. The brass coil only is shown in  the figure. The system is very efficient and we have no difficulty in  cooling the water as low as 2 deg. C. As a matter of fact our chief  difficulty is in regulating the supply of brine so as not to freeze the  water-supply.    _Water-mixer._--If the valve _b_ is opened, water flows through this  short length of pipe much more rapidly than through the long coil, owing  to the greater resistance of the cooling coil. In conducting these  experiments the valve c is opened wide and by varying the amount to  which the valve _b_ is opened, the water is evenly and readily mixed.  The thermometer C is in practice immersed in the water-mixer constructed  somewhat after the principle of the mixer inside the chamber described  on page 21. All the piping, including that under the floor, and the  reheater D, are covered with hair-felt and well insulated.    _Rate-valves._--It has been found extremely difficult to secure any form  of valve which, even with a constant pressure of water, will give a  constant rate of flow. In this type of calorimeter it is highly  desirable that the rate of flow be as nearly constant as possible hour  after hour, as this constant rate of flow aids materially in maintaining  the calorimeter at an even temperature. Obviously, fluctuations in the  rate of flow will produce fluctuations in the temperature of the ingoing  water and in the amount of heat brought away. This disturbs greatly the  temperature equilibrium, which is ordinarily maintained fairly constant.  Just before the water enters the reheater D it is caused to pass through  a rate-valve, which at present consists of an ordinary plug-cock. At  present we are experimenting with other types of valves to secure even  greater constancy, if possible.    _Electric reheater._--In order to control absolutely the temperature of  the water entering at E, it is planned to cool the water leaving the  water-mixer at C somewhat below the desired temperature, so that it is  necessary to reheat it to the desired point. This is done by passing a  current of electricity through a coil inserted in the system at the  point D. This electric reheater consists of a standard \"Simplex\" coil,  so placed in the copper can that the water has a maximum circulation  about the heater. The whole device is thoroughly insulated with  hair-felt. By connecting the electric reheater with the rheostat on the  observer's table, control of the quantity of electricity passing through  the coil is readily obtained, and hence it is possible to regulate the  temperature of the ingoing water to within a few hundredths of a degree.    The control of the amount of heat brought away from the chamber is made  either by (1) increasing the rate of flow or (2) by varying the  temperature of the ingoing water. Usually only the second method is  necessary. In the older form of apparatus a third method was possible,  namely, by varying the area of the absorbing surface of the cooling  system inside of the chamber. This last method of regulation, which was  used almost exclusively in earlier experiments, called for an elaborate  system of shields which could be raised or lowered at will by the  operator outside, thus involving an opening through the chamber which  was somewhat difficult to make air-tight and also considerably  complicating the mechanism inside the chamber. The more recent method of  control by regulating the temperature of the ingoing water by the  electric reheater has been much refined and has given excellent service.    _Insulation of water-pipes through the wall._--To insulate the  water-pipes as they pass through the metal walls of the calorimeter and  to prevent any cooling effect not measured by the thermometers presented  great difficulties. The device employed in the Middletown chamber was  relatively simple, but very inaccessible and a source of more or less  trouble, namely, a large-sized glass tube embedded in a large round  wooden plug with the annular space between the glass and wood filled  with wax. An attempt was made in the new calorimeters to secure air  insulation by using a large-sized glass tube, some 15 millimeters  internal diameter, and passing it through a large rubber stopper,  fitting into a brass ferule soldered between the zinc and copper walls.  (See N, fig. 25.) So far as insulation was concerned, this arrangement  was very satisfactory, but unfortunately the glass tubes break readily  and difficulty was constantly experienced. An attempt was next made to  substitute hard-rubber tubing for the glass tube, but this did not prove  to be an efficient insulator. More recently we have used with perfect  success a special form of vacuum-jacketed glass tube, which gives the  most satisfactory insulation. However, this system of insulation is  impracticable when electric-resistance thermometers are used for  recording the water-temperature differences and can be used only when  mercurial thermometers exclusively are employed. The electric-resistance  thermometers are constructed in such a way, however, as to make  negligible any inequalities in the passage of heat through the  hard-rubber casing. This will be seen in the discussion of these  thermometers.    _Measuring the water._--As the water leaves the respiration chamber it  passes through a valve which allows it to be deflected either into the  drain during the preliminary period, or into a small can where the  measurements of the rate of flow can readily be made, or into a large  tank (G, fig. 14) where the water is weighed. The measurement of the  water is made by"]]]
