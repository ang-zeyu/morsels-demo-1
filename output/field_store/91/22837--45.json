She smelled  the picture, tried to wedge in behind the frame, looked at us both with  a glance of questioning and wonder, and returned to her place, where she  disdainfully went to sleep again, refusing to have anything more to do  with the painted individual. Myrza's features will not be lost to  posterity, for there is a fine portrait of her by the Hungarian artist,  Victor Madarasz.    Let me close with the story of Dash. One day a dealer in broken bottles  and glass stopped at my door in quest of such wares. He had in his cart  a puppy, three or four months old, which he had been commissioned to  drown, whereat the worthy fellow grieved much, for the dog kept looking  at him with a tender and beseeching look as if he knew well what was  going to happen. The reason of the severe sentence passed on the puppy  was that he had broken his fore paw. My heart was filled with pity for  him, and I took charge of the condemned creature; called in a vet, and  had Dash's paw set in splints and bandaged. It was impossible, however,  to stop him gnawing at the dressings; the paw could not be cured, and  the bones not having knitted, it hung limp like the sleeve of a man who  has lost an arm. His infirmity, however, did not prevent his being  jolly, lively, and full of fun, and he managed to race along quite fast  on his three legs.    He was an out and out street dog, a rascally little cur that Buffon  himself would have been puzzled to classify. He was ugly, but his  features were uncommonly mobile and sparkled with cleverness. He seemed  to understand what was told him, and his expression would change  according as the words addressed to him, in the same tone of voice, were  flattering or injurious. He rolled his eyes, turned up his lips,  indulged in the wildest of nervous twitchings, or else grinned and  showed his white teeth, obtaining in this way most comical effects of  which he was perfectly conscious. He would often try to talk; laying his  paw on my knee, he would fix on me that earnest gaze of his and begin a  series of murmurs, sighs, and grunts, so varied in intonation that it  was hard not to recognise them as language. Sometimes in the course of a  conversation of this sort, Dash would break out into a bark or a yelp,  and then I would look sternly at him and say: \"That is barking, not  speaking. Is it possible that you are an animal?\" Dash, feeling  humiliated at the suggestion, would go on with his vocalisation, giving  it the most pathetic expression. We used to say then that Dash was  telling his tale of woe.    He was passionately fond of sugar, and at dessert, when coffee was  brought in, he would invariably beg each guest for a piece with such  insistence that he was always successful. He had ended by transforming  this merely benevolent gift into a regular tax which he collected with  unfailing regularity. He was but a little mongrel, yet with the frame of  a Thersites he had the soul of an Achilles. Infirm though he was, he  would attack, with madly heroic courage, dogs ten times his size and  was regularly and terribly thrashed by them. Like Don Quixote, the brave  Knight of La Mancha, he set out triumphantly and returned in most evil  plight. Alas! he was destined to fall a victim to his own courage. Some  months ago he was brought home with a broken back, the work of a  Newfoundland, an amiable brute, which the next day played the same trick  to a small greyhound.    Dash's death was the first of a series of catastrophes: the mistress of  the house where he met with the death-stroke was, a few days later,  burned alive in her bed, and the same fate overtook her husband who was  trying to save her. This was merely a fatal coincidence and by no means  an expiation, for these people were of the kindest and as fond of  animals as is a Brahmin, besides being wholly innocent of our poor  Dash's tragic fate.    It is true that I have still another dog, called Nero, but he is too  recent an inmate of our home to have a story of his own.    (NOTE.--Alas! Nero has been poisoned quite recently, just as if he had  been supping with the Borgias, and his epitaph comes in the very first  chapter of his life.)          V    MY HORSES      Now let not the reader, on seeing this title, hastily accuse me of being  a swell. Horses! That is a pretentious word to be written down by a man  of letters! _Musa pedestris_, says Horace; that is, the Muse goes on  foot, and Parnassus itself has but one horse in its stable, Pegasus.  Besides, he is a winged steed and by no means quiet in harness, if we  may credit what Schiller tells us in his ballad. I am not a sportsman,  alas! and deeply do I regret it, for I am as fond of horses as if I had  five hundred thousand a year, and I am entirely of the opinion of the  Arabs concerning pedestrians. The horse is man's natural pedestal, and  the one complete being is the centaur, whom mythology so ingeniously  invented.    Nevertheless, although I am merely a man of letters, I have owned  horses. In the year 1843 or 1844, I found in the pay-dirt of journalism,  washed out in the wooden pan of the _feuilleton_, a sufficient quantity  of gold dust to justify the hope that I might feed, besides my cats,  dogs, and magpies, a couple of animals of larger size. I first had a  couple of Shetland ponies, the size of big dogs, hairy as bears, all  mane and tail, and who looked at me in such friendly fashion through  their long black hair that I felt more like showing them into the  drawing-room than sending them to the stable. They would take sugar out  of my pockets like trained horses. But they proved to be decidedly too  small; they would have answered as saddle horses for English children  eight years of age, or as coach horses for Tom Thumb, but I was already  in the enjoyment of that athletic and portly frame for which I am famed,  and which has enabled me to bear up, without bending too much under the  burden, under forty consecutive years of supplying of copy. The  difference between the owner and the animals was unquestionably too  striking, even though the little black ponies drew at a very lively gait  the light phaeton to which they were harnessed with the daintiest tan  harness, that looked as if it had been bought in a toy shop.    Comic illustrated papers were not as numerous then as now, but there  were quite enough of them to publish caricatures of me and of my  horses. It goes without saying that, profiting by the latitude allowed  to caricature, I was represented as of elephantine bulk and appearance,  like the god Ganesa, the Hindoo god of wisdom, and that my ponies were  shown as no larger than poodles, rats, or mice. It is also true that I  could readily enough have carried my pair one under each arm, and taken  the carriage on my back. I did for a moment think of having a pony  four-in-hand, but such a Liliputian equipage would have merely attracted  greater attention. So to my great regret, for I had already become fond  of them, I replaced my Shetlands with two dapple-gray cobs of larger  size, with powerful necks, broad chests, stout and well set up, which  were not Mecklenburghers, no doubt, but plainly more capable of dragging  me along. They were both mares, the one called Jane, the other Betsy. So  far as outward looks went, they were as alike as two peas, and never was  there a better matched pair apparently. But Betsy was as lazy as Jane  was willing. While the one drew steadily, the other was satisfied with  trotting along, saving herself and taking good care to do nothing. These  two animals, of the same breed, of the same age, and destined to live in  the same stable, had the liveliest antipathy for each other. They could  not bear one another, fought in the stable, and bit each other as they  reared in harness. It was impossible to reconcile them, which was a  pity, for with their hog manes, like those of the horses on the  Parthenon frieze, their quivering nostrils, and their eyes dilated with  anger, they looked uncommonly handsome as they were driven up or down  the Avenue des Champs-Elysees. A substitute had to be found for Betsy,  and a small mare, somewhat lighter coloured, for it had been impossible  to match her exactly, was brought round. Jane immediately welcomed the  new-comer and did the honours of the stable to her most graciously, and  ere long they became fast friends. Jane would rest her head on Blanche's  neck--she had been so called because her gray coat was rather  whitish--and when they were let loose in the yard after being rubbed  down, they would play together like a pair of dogs of children. If one  was taken out driving, the one left in the stable was plainly wearying  for her, and as soon as she heard in the distance the ring of her  companion's hoofs on the paving-stones, she set up a joyous neigh, like  a trumpet-blast, to which the other did not fail to reply as she  approached.    They would come up to be harnessed with astonishing docility, and took  of themselves their proper place by the pole. Like all animals that are  loved and well treated, Jane and Blanche soon became most familiar and  trusting. They would follow me without bridle or halter like the  best-trained dog, and when I stopped they would stick their noses on my  shoulder in order to be caressed. Jane was fond of bread, and Blanche of  sugar, and both were crazy about melon skin. I could make them do  anything in return for these dainties.    If man were not odiously brutal and ferocious, as he too frequently  shows himself towards animals, they would cling to him most gladly.  Their dim brain is filled with the thought of that being who thinks,  speaks, and does things the meaning of which escapes them; he is a  mystery and a wonder to them.

Above that degree of temperature, its  particles being no longer held together by reciprocal attraction, it  becomes liquid; and, when we raise its temperature above 80 deg., (212  deg.) its particles, giving way to the repulsion caused by the heat,  assume the state of vapour or gas, and the water is changed into an  aeriform fluid.    The same may be affirmed of all bodies in nature: They are either solid  or liquid, or in the state of elastic aeriform vapour, according to the  proportion which takes place between the attractive force inherent in  their particles, and the repulsive power of the heat acting upon these;  or, what amounts to the same thing, in proportion to the degree of heat  to which they are exposed.    It is difficult to comprehend these phenomena, without admitting them as  the effects of a real and material substance, or very subtile fluid,  which, insinuating itself between the particles of bodies, separates  them from each other; and, even allowing the existence of this fluid to  be hypothetical, we shall see in the sequel, that it explains the  phenomena of nature in a very satisfactory manner.    This substance, whatever it is, being the cause of heat, or, in other  words, the sensation which we call _warmth_ being caused by the  accumulation of this substance, we cannot, in strict language,  distinguish it by the term _heat_; because the same name would then very  improperly express both cause and effect. For this reason, in the memoir  which I published in 1777[3], I gave it the names of _igneous fluid_ and  _matter of heat_. And, since that time, in the work[4] published by Mr  de Morveau, Mr Berthollet, Mr de Fourcroy, and myself, upon the  reformation of chemical nomenclature, we thought it necessary to banish  all periphrastic expressions, which both lengthen physical language, and  render it more tedious and less distinct, and which even frequently does  not convey sufficiently just ideas of the subject intended. Wherefore,  we have distinguished the cause of heat, or that exquisitely elastic  fluid which produces it, by the term of _caloric_. Besides, that this  expression fulfils our object in the system which we have adopted, it  possesses this farther advantage, that it accords with every species of  opinion, since, strictly speaking, we are not obliged to suppose this to  be a real substance; it being sufficient, as will more clearly appear in  the sequel of this work, that it be considered as the repulsive cause,  whatever that may be, which separates the particles of matter from each  other; so that we are still at liberty to investigate its effects in an  abstract and mathematical manner.    In the present state of our knowledge, we are unable to determine  whether light be a modification of caloric, or if caloric be, on the  contrary, a modification of light. This, however, is indisputable, that,  in a system where only decided facts are admissible, and where we avoid,  as far as possible, to suppose any thing to be that is not really known  to exist, we ought provisionally to distinguish, by distinct terms, such  things as are known to produce different effects. We therefore  distinguish light from caloric; though we do not therefore deny that  these have certain qualities in common, and that, in certain  circumstances, they combine with other bodies almost in the same manner,  and produce, in part, the same effects.    What I have already said may suffice to determine the idea affixed to  the word _caloric_; but there remains a more difficult attempt, which  is, to give a just conception of the manner in which caloric acts upon  other bodies. Since this subtile matter penetrates through the pores of  all known substances; since there are no vessels through which it cannot  escape, and, consequently, as there are none which are capable of  retaining it, we can only come at the knowledge of its properties by  effects which are fleeting, and difficultly ascertainable. It is in  these things which we neither see nor feel, that it is especially  necessary to guard against the extravagancy of our imagination, which  forever inclines to step beyond the bounds of truth, and is very  difficultly restrained within the narrow line of facts.    We have already seen, that the same body becomes solid, or fluid, or  aeriform, according to the quantity of caloric by which it is  penetrated; or, to speak more strictly, according as the repulsive force  exerted by the caloric is equal to, stronger, or weaker, than the  attraction of the particles of the body it acts upon.    But, if these two powers only existed, bodies would become liquid at an  indivisible degree of the thermometer, and would almost instantaneously  pass from the solid state of aggregation to that of aeriform elasticity.  Thus water, for instance, at the very moment when it ceases to be ice,  would begin to boil, and would be transformed into an aeriform fluid,  having its particles scattered indefinitely through the surrounding  space. That this does not happen, must depend upon the action of some  third power. The pressure of the atmosphere prevents this separation,  and causes the water to remain in the liquid state till it be raised to  80 deg. of temperature (212 deg.) above zero of the French thermometer,  the quantity of caloric which it receives in the lowest temperature being  insufficient to overcome the pressure of the atmosphere.    Whence it appears that, without this atmospheric pressure, we should not  have any permanent liquid, and should only be able to see bodies in that  state of existence in the very instant of melting, as the smallest  additional caloric would instantly separate their particles, and  dissipate them through the surrounding medium. Besides, without this  atmospheric pressure, we should not even have any aeriform fluids,  strictly speaking, because the moment the force of attraction is  overcome by the repulsive power of the caloric, the particles would  separate themselves indefinitely, having nothing to give limits to their  expansion, unless their own gravity might collect them together, so as  to form an atmosphere.    Simple reflection upon the most common experiments is sufficient to  evince the truth of these positions. They are more particularly proved  by the following experiment, which I published in the Memoirs of the  French Academy for 1777, p. 426.    Having filled with sulphuric ether[5] a small narrow glass vessel, A,  (Plate VII. Fig. 17.), standing upon its stalk P, the vessel, which is  from twelve to fifteen lines diameter, is to be covered by a wet  bladder, tied round its neck with several turns of strong thread; for  greater security, fix a second bladder over the first. The vessel should  be filled in such a manner with the ether, as not to leave the smallest  portion of air between the liquor and the bladder. It is now to be  placed under the recipient BCD of an air-pump, of which the upper part B  ought to be fitted with a leathern lid, through which passes a wire EF,  having its point F very sharp; and in the same receiver there ought to  be placed the barometer GH. The whole being thus disposed, let the  recipient be exhausted, and then, by pushing down the wire EF, we make a  hole in the bladder. Immediately the ether begins to boil with great  violence, and is changed into an elastic aeriform fluid, which fills the  receiver. If the quantity of ether be sufficient to leave a few drops in  the phial after the evaporation is finished, the elastic fluid produced  will sustain the mercury in the barometer attached to the air-pump, at  eight or ten inches in winter, and from twenty to twenty-five in  summer[6]. To render this experiment more complete, we may introduce a  small thermometer into the phial A, containing the ether, which will  descend considerably during the evaporation.    The only effect produced in this experiment is, the taking away the  weight of the atmosphere, which, in its ordinary state, presses on the  surface of the ether; and the effects resulting from this removal  evidently prove, that, in the ordinary temperature of the earth, ether  would always exist in an aeriform state, but for the pressure of the  atmosphere, and that the passing of the ether from the liquid to the  aeriform state is accompanied by a considerable lessening of heat;  because, during the evaporation, a part of the caloric, which was before  in a free state, or at least in equilibrio in the surrounding bodies,  combines with the ether, and causes it to assume the aeriform state.    The same experiment succeeds with all evaporable fluids, such as  alkohol, water, and even mercury; with this difference, that the  atmosphere formed in the receiver by alkohol only supports the attached  barometer about one inch in winter, and about four or five inches in  summer; that formed by water, in the same situation, raises the mercury  only a few lines, and that by quicksilver but a few fractions of a line.  There is therefore less fluid evaporated from alkohol than from ether,  less from water than from alkohol, and still less from mercury than from  either; consequently there is less caloric employed, and less cold  produced, which quadrates exactly with the results of these experiments.    Another species of experiment proves very evidently that the aeriform  state is a modification of bodies dependent on the degree of  temperature, and on the pressure which these bodies undergo. In a Memoir  read by Mr de la Place and me to the Academy in 1777, which has not been  printed, we have shown, that, when ether is subjected to a pressure  equal to twenty-eight inches of the barometer, or about the medium  pressure of the atmosphere, it boils at the temperature of about 32 deg.  (104 deg.), or 33 deg. (106.25 deg.), of the thermometer. Mr de Luc, who  has made similar experiments with spirit of wine, finds it boils at 67  deg. (182.75 deg."]]]
