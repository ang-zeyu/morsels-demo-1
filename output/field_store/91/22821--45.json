Yeah, I tried one out too.    #ifdef FLAME  Hasn't anyone told those idiots that you can't get  decent bogon suppression with AFJ filters at today's  net volumes?  #endif /* FLAME */    I guess they figured the price premium for true  frame-based semantic analysis was too high.  Unfortunately, it's also the only workable approach.  I wouldn't recommend purchase of this product unless  you're on a *very* tight budget.    #include <disclaimer.h>  --                   == Frank Foonly (Fubarco Systems)       In the above, the #ifdef/#endif pair is a conditional compilation     syntax from C; here, it implies that the text between (which is a     [127]flame) should be evaluated only if you have turned on (or defined     on) the switch FLAME. The #include at the end is C for \"include     standard disclaimer here\"; the `standard disclaimer' is understood to     read, roughly, \"These are my personal opinions and not to be construed     as the official position of my employer.\"       The top section in the example, with > at the left margin, is an     example of an inclusion convention we'll discuss below.       More recently, following on the huge popularity of the World Wide Web,     pseudo-HTML markup has become popular for similar purposes:  <flame>  Your father was a hamster and your mother smelt of elderberries!  </flame>       You'll even see this with an HTML-style modifier:  <flame intensity=\"100%\">  You seem well-suited for a career in government.  </flame>       Another recent (late 1990s) construction now common on USENET seems to     be borrowed from Perl. It consists of using a dollar sign before an     uppercased form of a word or acronym to suggest any [128]random member     of the class indicated by the word. Thus: `$PHB' means \"any random     member of the class `Pointy-Haired Boss'\".       Hackers also mix letters and numbers more freely than in mainstream     usage. In particular, it is good hackish style to write a digit     sequence where you intend the reader to understand the text string     that names that number in English. So, hackers prefer to write `1970s'     rather than `nineteen-seventies' or `1970's' (the latter looks like a     possessive).       It should also be noted that hackers exhibit much less reluctance to     use multiply-nested parentheses than is normal in English. Part of     this is almost certainly due to influence from LISP (which uses deeply     nested parentheses (like this (see?)) in its syntax a lot), but it has     also been suggested that a more basic hacker trait of enjoying playing     with complexity and pushing systems to their limits is in operation.       Finally, it is worth mentioning that many studies of on-line     communication have shown that electronic links have a de-inhibiting     effect on people. Deprived of the body-language cues through which     emotional state is expressed, people tend to forget everything about     other parties except what is presented over that ASCII link. This has     both good and bad effects. A good one is that it encourages honesty     and tends to break down hierarchical authority relationships; a bad     one is that it may encourage depersonalization and gratuitous     rudeness. Perhaps in response to this, experienced netters often     display a sort of conscious formal politesse in their writing that has     passed out of fashion in other spoken and written media (for example,     the phrase \"Well said, sir!\" is not uncommon).       Many introverted hackers who are next to inarticulate in person     communicate with considerable fluency over the net, perhaps precisely     because they can forget on an unconscious level that they are dealing     with people and thus don't feel stressed and anxious as they would     face to face.       Though it is considered gauche to publicly criticize posters for poor     spelling or grammar, the network places a premium on literacy and     clarity of expression. It may well be that future historians of     literature will see in it a revival of the great tradition of personal     letters as art.       _________________________________________________________________       Node:Email Quotes, Next:[129]Hacker Speech Style, Previous:[130]Hacker     Writing Style, Up:[131]Top    Email Quotes and Inclusion Conventions       One area where conventions for on-line writing are still in some flux     is the marking of included material from earlier messages -- what     would be called `block quotations' in ordinary English. From the usual     typographic convention employed for these (smaller font at an extra     indent), there derived a practice of included text being indented by     one ASCII TAB (0001001) character, which under Unix and many other     environments gives the appearance of an 8-space indent.       Early mail and netnews readers had no facility for including messages     this way, so people had to paste in copy manually. BSD Mail(1) was the     first message agent to support inclusion, and early Usenetters     emulated its style. But the TAB character tended to push included text     too far to the right (especially in multiply nested inclusions),     leading to ugly wraparounds. After a brief period of confusion (during     which an inclusion leader consisting of three or four spaces became     established in EMACS and a few mailers), the use of leading > or >     became standard, perhaps owing to its use in ed(1) to display tabs     (alternatively, it may derive from the > that some early Unix mailers     used to quote lines starting with \"From\" in text, so they wouldn't     look like the beginnings of new message headers). Inclusions within     inclusions keep their > leaders, so the `nesting level' of a quotation     is visually apparent.       The practice of including text from the parent article when posting a     followup helped solve what had been a major nuisance on Usenet: the     fact that articles do not arrive at different sites in the same order.     Careless posters used to post articles that would begin with, or even     consist entirely of, \"No, that's wrong\" or \"I agree\" or the like. It     was hard to see who was responding to what. Consequently, around 1984,     new news-posting software evolved a facility to automatically include     the text of a previous article, marked with \"> \" or whatever the     poster chose. The poster was expected to delete all but the relevant     lines. The result has been that, now, careless posters post articles     containing the entire text of a preceding article, followed only by     \"No, that's wrong\" or \"I agree\".       Many people feel that this cure is worse than the original disease,     and there soon appeared newsreader software designed to let the reader     skip over included text if desired. Today, some posting software     rejects articles containing too high a proportion of lines beginning     with `>' -- but this too has led to undesirable workarounds, such as     the deliberate inclusion of zero-content filler lines which aren't     quoted and thus pull the message below the rejection threshold.       Because the default mailers supplied with Unix and other operating     systems haven't evolved as quickly as human usage, the older     conventions using a leading TAB or three or four spaces are still     alive; however, >-inclusion is now clearly the prevalent form in both     netnews and mail.       Inclusion practice is still evolving, and disputes over the `correct'     inclusion style occasionally lead to [132]holy wars.       Most netters view an inclusion as a promise that comment on it will     immediately follow. The preferred, conversational style looks like     this,       > relevant excerpt 1       response to excerpt       > relevant excerpt 2       response to excerpt       > relevant excerpt 3       response to excerpt       or for short messages like this:       > entire message       response to message       Thanks to poor design of some PC-based mail agents, one will     occasionally see the entire quoted message after the response, like     this       response to message       > entire message       but this practice is strongly deprecated.       Though > remains the standard inclusion leader, | is occasionally used     for extended quotations where original variations in indentation are     being retained (one mailer even combines these and uses |>). One also     sees different styles of quoting a number of authors in the same     message: one (deprecated because it loses information) uses a leader     of >  for everyone, another (the most common) is > > > > , > > > ,     etc. (or >>>> , >>>, etc., depending on line length and nesting depth)     reflecting the original order of messages, and yet another is to use a     different citation leader for each author, say > , : , | , }     (preserving nesting so that the inclusion order of messages is still     apparent, or tagging the inclusions with authors' names). Yet another     style is to use each poster's initials (or login name) as a citation     leader for that poster.       Occasionally one sees a #  leader used for quotations from     authoritative sources such as standards documents; the intended     allusion is to the root prompt (the special Unix command prompt issued     when one is running as the privileged super-user).       _________________________________________________________________       Node:Hacker Speech Style, Next:[133]International Style,     Previous:[134]Email Quotes, Up:[135]Top    Hacker Speech Style       Hackish speech generally features extremely precise diction, careful     word choice, a relatively large working vocabulary, and relatively     little use of contractions or street slang.
