A series of pointed wires projected from the  surface of the belt near the edge immediately adjacent to the needle.  The wires could be placed at regular or irregular distances as required.  The shaft of one of the cylindrical rollers, which supported the  endless clothholder, carried a ratchet wheel advanced by the action of a  pawl connected to the end of the crankshaft by a small crankpin, whose  position or distance from the axis of rotation of the shaft could be  adjusted.    [Illustration: Figure 18.--A MOREY AND JOHNSON sewing machine as  illustrated in _Scientific American_, January 27, 1849. (Smithsonian  photo 45771.)]    By this adjustment the extent of the vertical travel of the impelling  pawl was regulated to control the length of the stitch. A spring catch  kept the ratchet wheel in place at the end of each forward rotation of  the wheel by the pawl. A roller placed over the endless belt at its  middle roller pressed the cloth onto the wire points. A curved piece of  metal was bent over and down upon the top of the belt so that the cloth,  as it was sewed, was carried toward and against the piece by the belt.  The cloth rose upon and over the piece and was separated from the  points. When the machine was in motion the cloth was carried forward,  passed under the needle, was stitched, and finally, passed the separator  and off the belt. A vertically reciprocating, straight, eye-pointed  needle, a horizontal supporting surface, and a yielding cloth presser  were all used, but none were claimed as part of the patent. These were  later specifically claimed in reissues of this patent. Bachelder's one  specific claim, the endless feed belt, was not limited to belt feeding  only. As he explained in the patent, a revolving table or a cylinder  might be substituted.    [Illustration: Figure 19.--BACHELDER'S PATENT MODEL, 1849. (Smithsonian  photo 45572).]    Bachelder did not manufacture machines, but his patent was sold in the  mid-1850s to I. M. Singer.[37] It eventually became one of the most  important patents to be contributed to the \"Sewing-Machine Combination,\"  a patent pool, which is discussed in more detail on pages 41 and 42.    While new ideas and inventors continued to provide the answers to some  of the sewing-machine problems, Elias Howe began a series of patent  suits to sustain the rights that he felt were his. Since his interest  had never been in constructing machines for sale, it was absolutely  essential for Howe to protect his royalty rights in order to realize any  return from his patent. He was reported[38] to have supervised the  construction of 14 sewing machines at a shop[39] on Gold Street in New  York toward the close of 1850. Sworn contemporary testimony indicates  that the machines were of no practical use.[40] Elias stated, in his  application for his patent extension,[41] that he made only one machine  in 1850-51. In 1852 he advertised[42] territorial rights and machines,  but apparently did not realize any financial success until he sold a  half interest in his patent to George Bliss in November 1852.[43] Bliss  later began manufacturing machines that he initially sold as \"Howe's  Patent\"; however, these machines were substantially different from the  basic Howe machine.    [Illustration: Figure 20.--BLODGETT & LEROW SEWING MACHINE, 1850, as  manufactured by A. Bartholf, New York; the serial number of the machine  is 19. At right, an original brass plate from the same type of machine  with needle arm and presser foot and arm, serial number 119; the plate,  however, does not fit the machine correctly. (Smithsonian photo 48440-D;  brass plate: 48440-K.)]    On May 18, 1853, Elias Howe granted his first royalty license to  Wheeler, Wilson & Company. Within a few months licenses were also  granted to Grover & Baker; A. Bartholf; Nichols & Bliss; J. A. Lerow;  Woolridge, Keene, and Moore; and A. B. Howe, the brother of Elias. These  licenses granted the manufacturer the right to use any part of the Howe  patent,[44] but it did not mean that the machines were Elias Howe  machines. When a royalty license was paid, the patent date and sometimes  the name was stamped onto the machine. For this reason, these machines  are sometimes mistakenly thought to be Elias Howe machines. They are  not.    Howe was also prevented from manufacturing a practical machine unless he  paid a royalty to other inventors. Three of the major manufacturers and  Howe resolved their differences by forming the \"Sewing Machine  Combination.\" Although Howe did not enter the manufacturing competition  for many years, he profited substantially from the royalty terms of the  combination. In 1860, he applied for and received a seven-year extension  on his patent.    [Illustration: Figure 21.--BLODGETT & LEROW SEWING MACHINE, 1850,  stamped with the legend \"Goddard, Rice & Co., Makers, Worcester, Mass.\"  and the serial number 37. Below: An original brass plate marked \"No.  38\"; this plate fits the machine perfectly. (Smithsonian photo 48440-E;  brass plate: 48440-J.)]    There were Howe family machines for sale during this period, but these  were the ones that Amasa Howe had been manufacturing since 1853. The  machine was an excellent one and received the highest medal for sewing  machines, together with many flattering testimonials, at the London  International Exhibition in 1862. After the publication of this award  the demand for (Amasa) Howe sewing machines was greatly increased at  home and abroad. Elias took this opportunity to gain entry into the  manufacturing business by persuading Amasa to let him build a factory at  Bridgeport, Connecticut, and manufacture the (Amasa) Howe machines. Two  years passed before the factory was completed, and Amasa's agents were  discouraged. The loss could have been regained, but the machines  produced at Bridgeport were not of the quality of the earlier machines.  Amasa attempted to rebuild the Bridgeport machines, but finally  abandoned them and resumed manufacturing machines in New York under his  own immediate supervision.[45] Elias formed his own company and  continued to manufacture sewing machines. In 1867 he requested a second  extension of his patent, but the request was refused. Elias Howe died in  October of the same year.    Meanwhile, another important sewing machine of a different principle had  also been patented in 1849. This was the machine of Sherburne C.  Blodgett, a tailor by trade, who was supported financially by John A.  Lerow. United States patent 6,766 was issued to both men on October 2,  1849. In the patent, the machine was termed as \"our new 'Rotary Sewing  Machine'.\" The shuttle movement was continuous, revolving in a circle,  rather than reciprocating as in the earlier machines. Automatic tension  was initiated, restraining the slack thread from interference with the  point of the needle.    [Illustration: Figure 22.--WILSON'S PREPATENT MODEL for his  reciprocating-shuttle machine, 1850. (Smithsonian photo 45525-A.)]    The Blodgett and Lerow machine was built by several shops. One of the  earliest was the shop of Orson C. Phelps on Harvard Place in Boston.  Phelps took the Blodgett and Lerow machine to the sixth exhibition of  the Massachusetts Charitable Mechanics Association in September 1850 and  won a silver medal and this praise, \"This machine performed admirably;  it is an exceedingly ingenious and compact machine, able to perform  tailor's sewing beautifully and thoroughly.\"[46] Although Phelps had won  the earliest known premium for a sewing machine, and although the  machine was produced commercially to a considerable extent (figs. 20 and  21), one outstanding flaw in its operation could not be overlooked. As  the shuttle passed around the six-inch circular shuttle race, it put a  twist in the thread (or took one out if the direction was reversed) at  each revolution. This caused a constant breaking of the thread, a  condition that could not be rectified without changing the principle of  operation. Such required changes were later to lead I. M. Singer,  another well-known name, into the work of improving this machine.    Also exhibited at the same 1850 mechanics fair was the machine of Allen  B. Wilson. Wilson's machine received only a bronze medal, but his  inventive genius was to have a far greater effect on the development of  the practical sewing machine than the work of Blodgett and Lerow. A. B.  Wilson[47] was one of the ablest of the early inventors in the field of  mechanical stitching, and probably the most original.    Wilson, a native of Willett, New York, was a young cabinetmaker at  Adrian, Michigan, in 1847 when he first conceived of a machine that  would sew. He was apparently unaware of parallel efforts by inventors in  distant New England. After an illness, he moved to Pittsfield,  Massachusetts, and pursued his idea in earnest. By November 1848 he had  produced the basic drawings for a machine that would make a lockstitch.  The needle, piercing the cloth, left a loop of thread below the seam. A  shuttle carrying a second thread passed through the loop, and as the  tension was adjusted a completed lockstitch was formed (fig. 22).  Wilson's shuttle was pointed on both ends to form a stitch on both its  forward and backward motion, a decided improvement over the shuttles of  Hunt and Howe, which formed stitches in only one direction. After each  stitch the cloth was advanced for the next stitch by a sliding bar  against which the cloth was held by a stationary presser. While the  needle was still in the cloth and holding it, the sliding bar returned  for a fresh grip on the cloth.    Wilson made a second machine, on the same principle, and applied for a  patent. He was approached by the owners of the Bradshaw 1848 patent,  who claimed control of the double-pointed shuttle. Although this claim  was without justification, as can be seen by examining the Bradshaw  patent specifications,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3268"],[0,"The Mysteries of Udolpho (#7)"],[1,"xuriant, and saw here  and there the blue sky trembling between them; the pursuits and events  of his early days crowded fast to his mind, with the figures and  characters of friends--long since gone from the earth; and he now felt  himself to be almost an insulated being, with nobody but his Emily for  his heart to turn to.    He stood lost amid the scenes of years which fancy called up, till the  succession closed with the picture of his dying wife, and he started  away, to forget it, if possible, at the social board.    St. Aubert ordered his carriage at an early hour, and Emily observed,  that he was more than usually silent and dejected on the way home; but  she considered this to be the effect of his visit to a place which spoke  so eloquently of former times, nor suspected that he had a cause of  grief which he concealed from her.    On entering the chateau she felt more depressed than ever, for she more  than ever missed the presence of that dear parent, who, whenever she  had been from home, used to welcome her return with smiles and fondness;  now, all was silent and forsaken.    But what reason and effort may fail to do, time effects. Week after week  passed away, and each, as it passed, stole something from the harshness  of her affliction, till it was mellowed to that tenderness which the  feeling heart cherishes as sacred. St. Aubert, on the contrary, visibly  declined in health; though Emily, who had been so constantly with him,  was almost the last person who observed it. His constitution had never  recovered from the late attack of the fever, and the succeeding shock  it received from Madame St. Aubert's death had produced its present  infirmity. His physician now ordered him to travel; for it was  perceptible that sorrow had seized upon his nerves, weakened as they had  been by the preceding illness; and variety of scene, it was probable,  would, by amusing his mind, restore them to their proper tone.    For some days Emily was occupied in preparations to attend him; and he,  by endeavours to diminish his expences at home during the journey--a  purpose which determined him at length to dismiss his domestics. Emily  seldom opposed her father's wishes by questions or remonstrances, or she  would now have asked why he did not take a servant, and have represented  that his infirm health made one almost necessary. But when, on the eve  of their departure, she found that he had dismissed Jacques, Francis,  and Mary, and detained only Theresa the old housekeeper, she was  extremely surprised, and ventured to ask his reason for having done so.  'To save expences, my dear,' he replied--'we are going on an expensive  excursion.'    The physician had prescribed the air of Languedoc and Provence; and St.  Aubert determined, therefore, to travel leisurely along the shores of  the Mediterranean, towards Provence.    They retired early to their chamber on the night before their departure;  but Emily had a few books and other things to collect, and the clock had  struck twelve before she had finished, or had remembered that some of  her drawing instruments, which she meant to take with her, were in the  parlour below. As she went to fetch these, she passed her father's  room, and, perceiving the door half open, concluded that he was in his  study--for, since the death of Madame St. Aubert, it had been frequently  his custom to rise from his restless bed, and go thither to compose his  mind. When she was below stairs she looked into this room, but without  finding him; and as she returned to her chamber, she tapped at his door,  and receiving no answer, stepped softly in, to be certain whether he was  there.    The room was dark, but a light glimmered through some panes of glass  that were placed in the upper part of a closet-door. Emily believed her  father to be in the closet, and, surprised that he was up at so late  an hour, apprehended he was unwell, and was going to enquire; but,  considering that her sudden appearance at this hour might alarm him,  she removed her light to the stair-case, and then stepped softly to the  closet. On looking through the panes of glass, she saw him seated at a  small table, with papers before him, some of which he was reading with  deep attention and interest, during which he often wept and sobbed  aloud. Emily, who had come to the door to learn whether her father was  ill, was now detained there by a mixture of curiosity and tenderness.  She could not witness his sorrow, without being anxious to know the  subject of; and she therefore continued to observe him in silence,  concluding that those papers were letters of her late mother. Presently  he knelt down, and with a look so solemn as she had seldom seen him  assume, and which was mingled with a certain wild expression, that  partook more of horror than of any other character, he prayed silently  for a considerable time.    When he rose, a ghastly paleness was on his countenance. Emily was  hastily retiring; but she saw him turn again to the papers, and she  stopped. He took from among them a small case, and from thence a  miniature picture. The rays of light fell strongly upon it, and she  perceived it to be that of a lady, but not of her mother.    St. Aubert gazed earnestly and tenderly upon his portrait, put it to his  lips, and then to his heart, and sighed with a convulsive force. Emily  could scarcely believe what she saw to be real. She never knew till now  that he had a picture of any other lady than her mother, much less  that he had one which he evidently valued so highly; but having looked  repeatedly, to be certain that it was not the resemblance of Madame St.  Aubert, she became entirely convinced that it was designed for that of  some other person.    At length St. Aubert returned the picture to its case; and Emily,  recollecting that she was intruding upon his private sorrows, softly  withdrew from the chamber.        CHAPTER III       O how canst thou renounce the boundless store   Of charms which nature to her vot'ry yields!   The warbling woodland, the resounding shore,   The pomp of groves, and garniture of fields;   All that the genial ray of morning gilds,   And all that echoes to the song of even;   All that the mountain's shelt'ring bosom shields,   And all the dread magnificence of heaven;   O how canst thou renounce, and hope to be forgiven!  ..... These charms shall work thy soul's eternal health,   And love, and gentleness, and joy, impart.       THE MINSTREL    St. Aubert, instead of taking the more direct road, that ran along the  feet of the Pyrenees to Languedoc, chose one that, winding over the  heights, afforded more extensive views and greater variety of romantic  scenery. He turned a little out of his way to take leave of M. Barreaux,  whom he found botanizing in the wood near his chateau, and who, when  he was told the purpose of St. Aubert's visit, expressed a degree of  concern, such as his friend had thought it was scarcely possible for him  to feel on any similar occasion. They parted with mutual regret.    'If any thing could have tempted me from my retirement,' said M.  Barreaux, 'it would have been the pleasure of accompanying you on this  little tour. I do not often offer compliments; you may, therefore,  believe me, when I say, that I shall look for your return with  impatience.'    The travellers proceeded on their journey. As they ascended the heights,  St. Aubert often looked back upon the chateau, in the plain below;  tender images crowded to his mind; his melancholy imagination suggested  that he should return no more; and though he checked this wandering  thought, still he continued to look, till the haziness of distance  blended his home with the general landscape, and St. Aubert seemed to     Drag at each remove a lengthening chain.    He and Emily continued sunk in musing silence for some leagues, from  which melancholy reverie Emily first awoke, and her young fancy, struck  with the grandeur of the objects around, gradually yielded to delightful  impressions. The road now descended into glens, confined by stupendous  walls of rock, grey and barren, except where shrubs fringed their  summits, or patches of meagre vegetation tinted their recesses, in which  the wild goat was frequently browsing. And now, the way led to the  lofty cliffs, from whence the landscape was seen extending in all its  magnificence.    Emily could not restrain her transport as she looked over the pine  forests of the mountains upon the vast plains, that, enriched with  woods, towns, blushing vines, and plantations of almonds, palms, and  olives, stretched along, till their various colours melted in distance  into one harmonious hue, that seemed to unite earth with heaven.  Through the whole of this glorious scene the majestic Garonne wandered;  descending from its source among the Pyrenees, and winding its blue  waves towards the Bay of Biscay.    The ruggedness of the unfrequented road often obliged the wanderers to  alight from their little carriage, but they thought themselves amply  repaid for this inconvenience by the grandeur of the scenes; and,  while the muleteer led his animals slowly over the broken ground, the  travellers had leisure to linger amid these solitudes, and to indulge  the sublime reflections, which soften, while they elevate, the heart,  and fill it with the certainty of a present God! Still the enjoyment  of St. Aubert was touched with that pensive melancholy, which gives  to every object a mellower tint, and breathes a sacred charm over all  around.    They had provided against part of the evil to be encountered from a want  of convenient inns, by carrying a stock of provisions in the carriage,  so that they might take refreshment on any pleasant spot, in the open  air, and pass the nights wherever they should happen to meet with a  comfortable cottage. For the mind, also, they had provided, by a work on  botany, written by M. Barreaux, and by several of the Latin"]]]
