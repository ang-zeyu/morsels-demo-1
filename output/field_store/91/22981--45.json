Writers who are fond of squaring facts with pre-conceived theories  maintain that the first inhabitants of Australia came from Eastern Asia or  the Indian Archipelago, and passing Torres Straits gradually overspread  the entire Australian continent. Nay, some even go so far as to maintain  that there exists to this time in the interior of some of the islands of  the Malay Archipelago a race of men identical with the aborigines of  Australia. And it certainly is a remarkable fact, that most of the  Australian war-songs, dances, &c., have been diffused from north to south,  although it does seem venturesome to deduce from this single circumstance  a migration from Eastern Asia. Others again hold (such, namely, as  Prichard, Wappaus, Burdach, &c.), that the aborigines are of the same race  as that inhabiting New Guinea and New Caledonia, and thus make them of the  same stock as the Australasian negro. Lastly, a modern naturalist, Mr.  James Brown, who lived sixteen years amongst the blacks, considers it not  improbable that some Malay crews (for since time immemorial it is known  that the Malays have been acquainted with, and visited the northern  shores of, Australia) had been, by shipwreck or some similar calamity,  cast away on the coast of the mainland, or on some of the islands near  Torres Straits, and had thus become the first involuntary settlers of the  north of Australia. This increasing population gradually spread over the  interior, and when after some centuries this people had traversed the  continent and arrived at the ocean on its further side, they had already  lost all recollection of their Pelagic origin, and were no longer capable  of deriving any advantage from the sea spread before their astonished  gaze. Strange to say, the black populations of Australia seem to be the  sole savage race inhabiting the coast of an ocean, who possess no means of  transport by water, and are unable to swim! Very possibly the recent  expeditions into the interior, undertaken with such ardour and attention  to details, may throw some new light upon these aborigines, but equally,  if not more, probable is it, that the entire race may have disappeared  from the earth before any reliable facts can be ascertained respecting  their origin, their migrations, or their history.    The morning after our arrival at Wulongong, and our first acquaintance  with the natives, we made an excursion, under the tutelage of Mr. White,  to Balgonie Farm, to hunt kangaroo in the forests of the neighbourhood. It  was not, however, the large species (_Macropus Major_) we were to hunt,  which sometimes attains a height of six feet, or even more, but a smaller  kind known as the Wallaby (_Halmaturus ualabatus_). The kangaroo proper  have long since retreated before civilization, and are now only found in  the recesses of the forest, hundreds of miles inland. The various  participators in the hunt were posted at certain distances in one of the  splendid forests, stretching between the Bellambi-Keira and Kemla ranges  of hills, while the blacks who accompanied us set forth to drive the game  towards us, assisted by their Dingoes, a kind of dog usually supposed to  be originally of European race. The blacks use the term \"Dingo\"  promiscuously for every description of dog, whereas the regular wild dog,  or rather the dog that runs wild in Australia, is called in the native  tongue \"Warrigul,\" and is of no particular breed, but seems rather a  mongrel descendant of the sheep dog.    The hunt was not very successful, and of some ten or twelve started by the  \"beaters,\" only two were killed. Although one can discern the Wallaby at  some distance by its plashing tramp, so that it seems but to need a glance  of the eye to bring it down as it flies past on its hind legs, followed  close by the dogs, it yet needs great activity and precision of aim to hit  the nimble animal as it hops swiftly past.    Yet though we were rewarded with such poor sport, our stay among the  splendid woods of the Keira range sufficiently repaid us. The most varied  and luxuriant forms of vegetation, changing at every step, almost  transcend the wanderer's power of description by their marvellous and  enrapturing beauty. Some portions of the forest landscape, where splendid  tree-ferns and gigantic gum trees, enveloped in the folds of the Liana,  from which in its turn depended exquisite parasitic plants, reminded us of  the brilliant profusion of the tropics. Not less peculiar and uncommon  than the vegetation were the sounds that struck our ear from amid the  semi-obscure green covert, without our eyes being able to distinguish the  singers. And so deceptive are some of these, that one almost involuntarily  starts as the loud crack resounds close to his ear of the _Phsophodes  crepitans_, known to colonists as the \"Coachman's whip,\" or the _Myzantha  Garrula_, or bell-bird, sounds its bell-like note.    During our stroll we came upon several farms, plain wooden huts covered  with the glutinous bark of the gum tree, whose impoverished exterior gave  little promise of the comfort to be found within, and pleasantest of all  was the ready and heartfelt hospitality. Hardly had we set our foot within  a hut, ere all the members of the family bestirred themselves to bring  milk and butter, eggs and bread, of which they pressed us to partake. In  each we visited there was no lack of beautiful china, elegantly carved  wine glasses, and Sheffield table cutlery, while the walls were decorated  with elegant engravings and wood-cuts. The bread was usually the national  institution, known as \"Damper,\" which is simply some meal and water well  mixed and heated in warm ashes. It is very palatable, and besides the  simplicity of its preparation, the meal well kneaded being baked for an  hour as aforesaid, it possesses the advantage of continuing for a  considerable time fit for use.    Our return to Sydney was fixed for the following morning. We were desirous  of catching the steamer which plies from Wulongong every second day, as  our Commodore, and several of the scientific staff, had received an  invitation for the evening at Sydney. As the steamer would first of all  start towards noon from Keiama, we employed the hours of morning in a  visit to the coal mines of the Keira, and hunting in the adjoining  forests. Coal is very abundant in these mines, and is wheeled along a  level shaft in small waggons as far as the high road, whence it is  conveyed by regular carts to the city. About 200 of these are brought up  every day.    Unfortunately our plan for returning by the steamer fell through, as a  high wind and heavy sea rendered the entrance of the boat into the harbour  a very problematical business. Accordingly, as the boat had not made her  appearance by 4 P.M., there was nothing for it but to return by coach to  Appin, so as to enable us to reach Sydney in time for our invitation. The  cool of evening began now to be felt among the lofty steep hills, over  which lies the road to the interior. At first all went well, and the early  part of our journey was performed in all comfort and at a rapid pace. But  we soon came to some very steep parts of the road, where our tired horses  gave out, and could not proceed one step further. By this time we had left  the coach, and went on on foot, shooting and collecting as we proceeded,  and admiring the beauty of the landscape around. The coach had stuck fast  half-way up a steep ridge, while the horses took no heed of the servants'  flagellation. The coarse language in which Mr. Croker, the very type in  this respect of an English driver, exhorted Billy and Sam (so were our two  steeds named), and the frequent song of the whip, availed nothing; the  animals would not budge a step; so we had to lend our assistance in  person, and move the vehicle a few paces farther to a less dangerous  position.    Further progress, under the circumstances, was out of the question. It was  resolved to send man and horse back to Wulongong to engage additional  horses, and continue our walk as far as the huts at Bargo, the next  station, 18 miles distant. _En route_, or at Bargo, it was supposed our  coachman would overtake us with fresh horses. As we were by no means sure  of our road, we took the precaution of carrying our most necessary  effects, in the event of our having to pass the night in the bush.    It was 6.30 P.M., and the sun was going down, only the extreme summits of  the trees catching and reflecting his golden beams. On we went, our  excitement stimulated by the prospect of an adventure. Gradually the  darkness of night enveloped the wood. Our path became uncertain. Even the  full splendour of the moon, as she rose in the east, and darted her silver  rays through the gloom of the _Eucalypti_, casting gigantic shadows on the  sandy soil, rather tended to confuse us amid this labyrinth than enable  us to extricate ourselves. We held on however till 1 A.M., and were just  on the eve of camping for the night to await the break of day, when all at  once we saw before us the stately fence which surrounds Bargo. With  quickened steps we made for the lonely little farm, and hammered at its  closed door. A tremendous chorus of barking dogs was the not very  propitious welcome of guests arriving at such an unseasonable hour. After  repeated knocking the door of the hut was opened; an old man appeared in  his night-shirt on the threshold, and gruffly inquired who we were and  what we wanted?

The live spindle should be enlarged at the face plate end, and tapered  at both ends, as indicated in the engraving.    The pulleys, which are of hard wood, are made of three pieces glued  together, bored, and driven on the spindle, secured by a pin passing  through both it and the spindle, and turned off. The bars forming the  shears may be either cold rolled iron or round machinery steel; they  will require no labor except perhaps squaring up at the ends. The  castings having been fitted to the bars, and provided with set screws  for clamping them, the two standards that support the live spindle and  the support for the opposite end of the bars are put in position, when  the bars are made truly parallel, and a little clay or putty is placed  around each bar and over the annular cavity that surrounds it, and is  formed into a spout or lip at the upper side to facilitate the pouring  of Babbitt metal. The metal must be quite hot when poured, so that  it will run sharp and fill the cavity. To guard against a possible  difficulty in removing the castings from the bars it might be well to  cover the side of the bar next the screw with a thin piece of paper.  The pieces of the tail stock and tool rest support are fitted to the  bars by means of Babbitt metal, the metal being poured first in one  half and then in the other. The bolts which clamp the two parts of the  rest support and tail stock together are provided with lever handles.  After fitting the parts to the two bars by means of Babbitt metal, the  tail spindle, which is threaded for half its length, is placed in the  tail stock parallel with the bars and Babbitted. A binding screw is  provided for clamping the tail spindle, and the spindle is drilled at  one end to receive the center, and has at the other end a crank for  operating it. A steel or bronze button is placed in the hole in the  standard that supports the smaller end of the live spindle, and the  spindle is supported in its working position and Babbitted.    The thread on the spindle should be rather coarse, so that wooden or  type metal face plates and chucks may be used.    The table shown in Fig. 1 is simple and inexpensive. It consists of  two pairs of crossed legs halved together and secured to a plank top.  A small rod passes through the rear legs near their lower ends, and  also through a piece of gas pipe placed between the legs. A diagonal  brace is secured to the top near one end, and is fastened to the lower  end of the rear leg at the other end of the table.    A block is secured to each pair of legs for supporting a pair of  ordinary grindstone rollers, which form a bearing for the balance  wheel shaft. This shaft has formed in it two cranks, and it carries  an ordinary balance wheel, to the side of which is secured by means  of hook bolts a grooved wooden rim for receiving the driving belt. The  cranks are connected, by means of hooks of ordinary round iron, with a  treadle that is pivoted on the gas pipe at the rear of the table. The  shaft will work tolerably well, even if it is not turned. The cranks  must have half round grooves filed in them to receive the treadle  hooks. The size of the different diameters of the drive wheel may be  found by turning the larger one first and the smaller ones afterward,  using the belt to determine when the proper size is reached. The  wooden rim may be turned off in position by using a pointed tool.

M.           *       *       *       *       *          MACHINE SHOP ECONOMY.      In times like the present, when even with good management our best  machine shops are enabled to exhibit but small margins of profit, and  shops with indifferent management exhibit margins on the wrong side,  it is a question of paramount importance what kind of economy should  be pursued in order to maintain a successful business. The directors  of long established machinery enterprises differ widely upon some  methods of conducting business, and while one gains success by  pursuing a certain plan, another, with perhaps as much ability, cannot  pursue the same with satisfactory results.    While in the main there are many different plans upon which successful  machinery establishments are conducted, there are some underlying  principles that must be observed to avoid meeting with difficulties.  The rate of wages paid is certainly a large element of shop economy,  but there are so many other elements that should be considered before  wages are reached, that we often find proprietors, who pay their  workmen at a comparatively high rate, doing a more prosperous business  than their competitors who have reduced wages to the lowest possible  scale. Many machine shop owners, not having mastered the various  economies of management, as soon as profits begin to shorten, pounce  directly upon the wages paid to their workmen, and pare them down so  as to make up for the deficiency elsewhere. They don't seem to realize  that there are important elements of economical management other than  closely watching the wages of labor and the cost of material. It is  sometimes necessary to reduce the rate of wages, but what a different  effect it has upon the men in different shops! In one shop you  scarcely hear a murmur--no angry meetings--no threats of a strike--no  growling at the head of the establishment. The intelligent workmen  understand the reasons for the reduction without a wordy explanation,  and accept it, feeling confident that it has not been unjustly made.  In another shop it causes ill feeling, angry protests, and perhaps  a disastrous strike. The owner often charges his trouble to the  character of his workmen. Let him review his course, and see if the  great cause is not in his own management. Mechanics are keen and  observing. If the business is poorly managed they are not slow to  mark it, and when a cut is made in wages can generally cipher out the  cause. It is good economy to keep a systematic record of the cost  of everything. This record will be found very valuable in making  estimates, much more so than guess work. It is not good economy  to keep using worn-out tools when any work of consequence is to be  performed. The extra cost of labor and spoiled pieces would soon pay  for new tools. It is not good economy to keep discharging capable  workmen for petty causes, and employing new hands to take their  places. It is poor economy to use slow-cutting grindstones to  accomplish work that fast cutting emery wheels are suited for. It is  questionable economy to employ lathes, planers, and drills to perform  work of any extent that a milling machine will do better in less time  and at much less expense.    It is decidedly bad economy to employ engines and boilers that waste  fuel and are troublesome to keep in good running condition. It is  mistaken economy to buy inferior tools, machines, and shop supplies,  because they are low priced.    It is very defective economy to fit the parts of machines together by  trial instead of making them by aid of correct drawings and standard  tools for accurate measurement. It is faulty economy to practice  borrowing and lending working tools.    The idea that economy consists in withholding every expense not  absolutely demanded is erroneous. An extra outlay in one or another  direction often assures the saving as well as the making of money.  Wise economy looks to the future as well as the present, and requires  that all work sent out from a shop should be of the best and most  reliable character.--_American Machinist._           *       *       *       *       *          THE REWARD OF INVENTION.      _Capital and Labor_ publishes the substance of a letter from Mr. Henry  Bessemer with reference to the refusal of the English Government, or  of its ambassador in Paris, to allow the Grand Cross of the Legion of  Honor to be accepted by its countrymen, and in his letter Mr. Bessemer  furnishes some autobiographic particulars which cannot fail to be of  interest. He tells us that at the age of eighteen he came to London  from a small country village, knowing no one, and himself unknown; but  his studious habits and his love of invention soon gained for him  a footing, and in two years he was pursuing a method of his own  invention for taking copies from antique and modern bassi-rilievi in  a manner that enabled him to stamp them on a cardboard, thus producing  thousands of embossed copies of the highest works of art, at a small  cost. The facility for making a permanent die, even from a thin paper  original, capable of producing a thousand copies, would have opened  a wide door to successful fraud if the process had been known to  unscrupulous persons; for by its means, Mr. Bessemer states, there is  not a government stamp, or the paper seal of a corporate body, that  every common office clerk could not forge in a few minutes at the  office of his employer or at his own home. The production of a  die from a common paper stamp is the work of only ten minutes; the  materials cost less than one penny. No sort of technical skill is  necessary, and a common copying press or letter stamp yields most  successful copies. There is no need for the would-be forger to  associate himself with a skillful die sinker, capable of making a good  imitation in steel of the original, for the merest tyro could make  an"]]]
