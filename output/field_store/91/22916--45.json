[13] This forest type was not distinguished separately by Spencer and  Pfeifer (1966), so they did not provide availability figures for it.  Thus in this comparison, we did not include the 57 wolf locations that  fell in the type. However in calculating percentage figures for  non-forest areas (towns, farms, dumps), these 57 fixes could validly be  used as representing forest locations.                        Failure of Female No. 11 to Whelp    There was no sign that adult female No. 11 whelped or attempted to  locate or construct a den. The usual gestation period for wolves is  about 63 days (Brown 1936). Because No. 11 was seen coupled in  copulation on February 12 and 16, she should have whelped between April  13 and April 21, if she had conceived. Probably she would have moved  little during the preceding 2 or 3 weeks (Mech 1970). However no such  changes in this animal's movements were noticed. The three wolves stayed  near Kenton between April 15 and April 18 but also killed a deer during  that time. They moved extensively from April 19 to May 7. The only  indirect evidence that the female may have been pregnant was an  observation made by a local citizen on April 5 (Table 6) who saw the  three wolves and stated that the small wolf looked \"fat.\" This would  probably have been No. 11, but a full stomach could easily have been  mistaken for pregnancy.    Unfortunately, neither the reproductive tract collected from No. 11 in  September nor the blood sample taken in early March shed any light on  the cause for the wolf's failure to produce pups. The ovaries did  contain _corpora albicantia_, indicating that at some time the wolf had  ovulated, but it could not be stated with certainty just when (R. D.  Barnes, personal communication). The blood progesterone levels were more  helpful. No. 11 had 3,560 picograms of progesterone per milliliter,  compared to 56 picograms per milliliter for Wolf No. 10, whose  reproductive tract appeared immature. This high progesterone level of  No. 11 indicated that the animal had recently ovulated, but it was  impossible to tell whether she was carrying any fetuses at the time the  sample was taken (U. S. Seal, personal communication).                          Demise of the Translocated Wolves    All four translocated wolves were killed by humans (Table 8). The alpha  male (No. 12) was the first victim. He was found from the air in the  same location on July 6 and 10. A ground check on July 11 showed him  already decomposed. He lay about 60 feet (18.3 m) from paved highway US  141 north of Amasa (Fig. 22). The articular processes on the right side  of his fifth and sixth cervical vertebrae were broken and inverted. Part  of the process of the sixth cervical vertebra was lodged in the neural  canal between the fifth and sixth cervical vertebrae and would have  exerted pressure on his spinal cord. His acrylic radio collar was also  cracked on the right side in three places. We concluded that he had been  struck and killed by an automobile. A scat found beneath the remains  contained deer hair, so apparently the animal had been feeding not long  before his death.    [Illustration: _Fig. 22.--The remains of Wolf No. 12 were found near a  highway, and broken bones indicated he had been hit by a vehicle (Photo  by Richard P. Smith)_]    Wolf No. 13 was killed next. He had been located south of Sagola in  Dickinson County on July 20, the first time he was found since June 27.  He was still there on July 27, so a ground check was made. It revealed  that the wolf had been dead for perhaps 2 or 3 weeks. His flesh had  decomposed, and only hair, bones and the transmitting collar remained  (Fig. 23). His leg bones and ribs were mostly disarticulated, his skull  was separated from the vertebral column, and his mandible had separated.  A small caliber bullet had passed through the ramus of the left mandible  and had entered the base of the cranium. The hole through the mandible  was 0.26 inch x 0.34 inch (6.6 mm. x 8.6 mm.) and that through the  cranium was 0.34 inch x 1.30 inch (8.6 mm. x 33.0 mm.). Three small lead  fragments were removed from the cranium.    [Illustration: _Fig. 23.--Wolf No. 13 had been shot, as the hole in the  jawbone indicates (Photo by Tom Weise)_]    The remains of Wolf No. 13 were sent to the Michigan Department of  Natural Resources Wildlife Research Center at Rose Lake and examined by  staff pathologists Dr. L. D. Fay and Mr. John Stuht. No fractures or  other signs were found that might indicate that he had been trapped.  However, some of the smaller foot bones were missing and a complete  examination was not possible. Notches were found in both shoulder  blades, and one rib was broken, suggesting that the animal had been shot  twice by a small caliber firearm in addition to the head shot. The hole  in the left scapula indicated a deep penetrating wound. The notch in the  right scapula indicated a bullet traveling more parallel to the body.    _Table 8.

The next morning the trapper came upon  the trapped wolf by surprise at a range of 12 feet (3.6 m). She growled  and lunged toward him, and thinking he was in danger, the trapper shot  the wolf in the head. The .22 caliber bullet entered below the right eye  and lodged in the skull. The trapper immediately took the animal to the  Michigan Department of Natural Resources office in Crystal Falls and  reported the incident.    The wolf weighed 56.5 lb. (25.6 kg), 1.5 lb. (0.68 kg) less than when  she was brought to Michigan. Her general condition was good, with some  omental fat, but no subcutaneous fat. She did harbor ten tapeworms  (_Taenia pisiformis_) about 40-50 cm long and a few hookworms  (_Uncinaria stenocephala_), as determined by Mr. John Wenstrom (personal  communication), Biology Department, Northern Michigan University. Both  are common tapeworms of wolves (Mech 1970).    Wolf No. 10 was shot by a deer hunter, probably on the morning of  November 16, the second day of firearms deer season. On November 17 her  signal was heard from near a cabin on the south shore of Van Riper Lake.  The hunters occupying the cabin later said they had removed the collar  from the wolf, which they had found dead on the afternoon of November  16. Before we had learned this, the carcass of Wolf No. 10 was  discovered without the collar by another hunter, about a half mile (0.8  km) south of Van Riper Lake. It had been shot through the right leg,  shattering the radius and ulna, and through the head, the bullet  entering the left frontal bone and exiting below the right eye. In  addition the radio collar had been shattered by a bullet and was  missing, and one ear had been cut off. We identified the wolf from the  tag in the other ear.    The wolf had gained 6 lb. (2.7 kg) since she had been brought to  Michigan, and had heavy internal and subcutaneous fat. She had light  infections of two species of tapeworms (_Echinococcus granulosus_ and  _Taenia pisiformis_), and of one species of hookworm (Uncinaria  stenocephala), as determined by John Wenstrom. _Echinococcus granulosus_  is not uncommon in wolves (Mech 1970). The other two species were  discussed above.                                         DISCUSSION      Wolves No. 11, 12, and 13 undoubtedly were members of the same pack.  This conclusion is based on the fact that they did not fight when placed  together in captivity, that they freely intermixed while penned, that  No. 11 and No. 12 copulated, and that all three wolves generally  traveled as a unit after their release. No. 11 and No. 12 were always  located together from a few days after their release until the death of  No. 12. Temporary splitting, as with No. 13 is a normal occurrence in  wild wolf packs (Mech 1966).    The identity of Wolf No. 10 remains unknown. She was captured 7.5 miles  (12.1 km) away from the other three, and in captivity she behaved  differently from them, remaining more to herself but intermingling with  the others occasionally, with no signs of aggression. The face licking  of No. 10 by No. 11 could be interpreted as a sign of patronizing  intimacy as an adult might treat a subordinate offspring. The teeth of  Wolf No. 10 had very little wear, indicating that"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35062"],[0,"The Woodpeckers (#7)"],[1,"forth, certainly consuming several minutes each.    Then each acorn had to be fitted to its hole. We have already spoken of  the accuracy with which this is done, so that the Carpenter's work is a  standing taunt to the hungry jays and squirrels which would gladly eat  his nuts if they could get them. A careful observer tells us that when  the hole is too small, the woodpecker takes the acorn out and makes the  hole a little larger, working so cautiously, however, that he sometimes  makes several trials before the acorn can be fitted and driven in flush  with the bark. Some of these acorns show cracks down the sides, as if  they had been split either in forcibly pulling them out of a hole not  deep enough for them, or in driving them when green and soft into a hole  too small for them. Of course after each trial the acorn must be hunted  up where it lies on the ground and driven in again, and this takes  considerable time.    As nearly as we can estimate it, not less than half a day must have been  spent in putting these acorns where we find them. With smaller acorns,  stored in pine bark, less time would have been required; but weeks, if  not months, of work are spent in laying up the winter's stores.    How the woodpecker's back and jaws must have ached! Surely he is human  enough to get tired with his work, and it is not play to do what this  bird has done. Some of the acorns measure seven tenths of an inch in  diameter by nine tenths in length, and the bird that carried them is  smaller than a robin. How he must have hurried to reach his tree when  the acorn was extra large! Yet he took time to drive every one in point  foremost. Even those that lie upon their sides must have been forced  into position by tapping the butt. He knows very well which end of an  acorn is which, does our Carpenter.    But what is the use of all this work? Why, if he wants acorns, does he  not eat them as they lie scattered under the oaks, instead of taking  pains to carry them away and put them into holes for the fun of eating  them out of the holes afterward? The absurdity of this has led some  people to surmise that the Carpenter chooses none but weevilly acorns,  and stores them that the grub inside may grow large and fat and  delicious. This would be very interesting, if it were true. There must  of course be more weevilly acorns on the ground than he picks up, so  that he could get as many grubs without taking all this trouble, and  there is no reason why they should not be as large and good as those  hatched out in holes in trees. When I wish to keep nuts sweet, I spread  them out on the attic floor in the sun and air, keeping them where they  will not touch each other. The Carpenter does practically the same  thing. Is it probable that he tries to raise a fine crop of grubs in  this way? If so, one or the other of us is doing just the wrong thing.  But if weevils are what the Carpenter wants, then the nuts in the bark  should be wormy; yet only two of them show any sign of a weevil, and of  these one appears from its dull color and weather-beaten look to be a  nut deposited several years before the others by some other woodpecker.  Every other acorn is as hard, shining, and bright colored as when it  fell from the tree. Evidently the bird picked these nuts up while they  were fresh and good; perhaps he chose them _because_ they were good and  fresh. The possibility becomes almost a certainty when we observe that  naturalists agree that the Carpenter uses no acorns but the  sweet-tasting species. Now there are likely to be as many grubs in one  kind of an acorn as in another, and he would scarcely refuse any kind  that contained them, if grubs were what he wanted. The fact that he  takes sweet acorns, and those only, shows that it is the meat of the nut  that he wants. And all good naturalists agree that it is the kernel  itself that he eats.    Why he stores them is not hard to decide when we remember that the  Californian woodpecker, over a large part of his range, is a mountain  bird. Though we think of California as the land of sunshine, it is not  universal summer there. The mountain ranges have a winter as severe as  that of New England, with a heavy snowfall. When the snow lies several  feet deep among the pines and spruces of the uplands, the Carpenter is  not distressed for food: his pantry is always above the level of the  snow; he need neither scratch a meagre living from the edges of the  snow-banks, nor go fasting. His fall's work has provided him not only  with the necessities, but with the luxuries of life.    But why does he spend so much time in making holes? He might tuck his  nuts into some natural crevice in the oak bark, or drop them into  cavities which all birds know so well where to find. And leave them  where any pilfering jay would be able to pick them out at his ease? Or  put them in the track of every wandering squirrel? Jays and squirrels  are never too honest to refuse to steal, but they find it harder to get  the woodpecker's stores out of his pine-tree pantry than to pick up  honest acorns of their own. So, like the woodpecker, they lay up their  own stores of nuts, and feed on them in winter, or go hungry.    We have had very little aid from anything except the piece of bark we  were studying, yet we have learned that the Californian woodpecker is a  good carpenter; that he works hard at his trade; that he shows  remarkable foresight in collecting his food, much ingenuity in housing  it, good judgment in putting it where his enemies cannot get it, and  wisdom in the plan he has adopted to give him a good supply of fresh  nuts at a season when the autumn's crop is buried under the deep snow.    If I were a Californian boy, I think I should spend my time in trying to  find out more about this wise woodpecker, concerning which much remains  to be discovered.          IX    A RED-HEADED COUSIN      Besides his half-brothers, the narrow-fronted and ant-eating  woodpeckers, the Carpenter has a numerous family of cousins,--the  red-headed, the red-bellied, the golden-fronted, the Gila,[1] and the  Lewis's woodpeckers. These all belong to one genus, and are much alike  in structure, though totally different in color. Most of them are  Western or Southwestern birds, but one is found in nearly all parts of  the United States lying between the Hudson River and the Rocky  Mountains, and is the most abundant woodpecker of the middle West. This  well-known cousin is the red-headed woodpecker, the tricolored beauty  that sits on fence-posts and telegraph poles, and sallies out, a blaze  of white, steel-blue, and scarlet, a gorgeous spectacle, whenever an  insect flits by. He is the one that raps so merrily on your tin roofs  when he feels musical.    [Footnote 1: So named from being found along the Gila River.]    In many ways the red-head, as he is familiarly called, is like his  carpenter cousin. Both indulge in long-continued drumming; both catch  flies expertly on the wing; and both have the curious habit of laying up  stores of food for future use. The Californian woodpecker not only  stores acorns, but insect food as well. But though the Carpenter's  habits have long been known, it is a comparatively short time since the  red-head was first detected laying up winter supplies.    The first to report this habit of the red-head was a gentleman in South  Dakota, who one spring noticed that they were eating _young_  grasshoppers. At that season he supposed that all the insects of the  year previous would be dead or torpid, and certainly full-grown, while  those of the coming summer would be still in the egg. Where could the  bird find half-grown grasshoppers? Being interested to explain this, he  watched the red-heads until he saw that one went frequently to a post,  and appeared to get something out of a crevice in its side. In that post  he found nearly a hundred grasshoppers, still alive, but wedged in so  tightly they could not escape. He also found other hiding-places all  full of grasshoppers, and discovered that the woodpeckers lived upon  these stores nearly all winter.    But it is not grasshoppers only that the red-head hoards, though he  is very fond of them. In some parts of the country it is easier to find  nuts than to find grasshoppers, and they are much less perishable food.  The red-head is very fond of both acorns and beechnuts. Probably he eats  chestnuts also. Who knows how many kinds of nuts the red-head eats? You  might easily determine not only what he will eat, but what he prefers,  if a red-headed woodpecker lives near you. Lay out different kinds of  nuts on different days, putting them on a shed roof, or in some place  where squirrels and blue jays would not be likely to dare to steal them,  and see whether he takes all the kinds you offer. Then lay out mixed  nuts and notice which ones he carries off first. If he takes all of one  kind before he takes any of the others, we may be sure that he has  discovered his favorite nut. Such little experiments furnish just the  information which scientific men are glad to get.    [Illustration]    It is well known that the red-head is very fond of beechnuts. Every  other year we expect a full crop of nuts, and close observation shows  that the red-heads come to the North in much larger numbers and stay  much later on these years of plenty than on the years of scanty crops.  Lately it has been discovered that they not only eat beechnuts all the  fall, but store them up for winter use. This time the observation was  made in Indiana. There, when the nuts were abundant, the red-heads were  seen busily carrying them off. Their accumulations were found in all  sorts of places: cavities in old tree-trunks contained nuts by the  handful; knot-holes, cracks, crevices, seams in the barns were filled  full of nuts. Nuts were tucked into the cracks in fence-posts; they were  driven into railroad ties; they were pounded in between the shingles"]]]
