If  you would foretell the development, either of a bird or of a man, it is  not enough to know his environment, you must know also what there is in  him.    We have possibly made too much of the savanna sparrow's innocent  eccentricity. He fills his place, and fills it well; and who knows but  that he may yet outshine the skylark? There is a promise, I believe, for  those who humble themselves. But what shall be said of species which do  not even try to sing, and that, notwithstanding they have all the  structural peculiarities of singing birds, and must, almost certainly,  have come from ancestors who were singers? We have already mentioned the  house sparrow, whose defect is the more mysterious on account of his  belonging to so highly musical a family. But _he_ was never accused of  not being noisy enough, while we have one bird who, though he is classed  with the oscines, passes his life in almost unbroken silence. Of course  I refer to the waxwing, or cedar-bird, whose faint, sibilant whisper can  scarcely be thought to contradict the foregoing description. By what  strange freak he has lapsed into this ghostly habit, nobody knows. I  make no account of the insinuation that he gave up music because it  hindered his success in cherry-stealing. He likes cherries, it is true;  and who can blame him? But he would need to work hard to steal more than  does that indefatigable songster, the robin. I feel sure he has some  better reason than this for his Quakerish conduct. But, however he came  by his stillness, it is likely that by this time he plumes himself upon  it. Silence is golden, he thinks, the supreme result of the highest  aesthetic culture. Those loud creatures, the thrushes and finches! What a  vulgar set they are, to be sure, the more's the pity! Certainly if he  does not reason in some such way, bird nature is not so human as we have  given it credit for being. Besides, the waxwing has an uncommon  appreciation of the decorous; at least, we must think so if we are able  to credit a story of Nuttall's. He declares that a Boston gentleman,  whose name he gives, saw one of a company of these birds capture an  insect, and offer it to his neighbor; he, however, delicately declined  the dainty bit, and it was offered to the next, who, in turn, was  equally polite; and the morsel actually passed back and forth along the  line, till, finally, one of the flock was persuaded to eat it. I have  never seen anything equal to this; but one day, happening to stop under  a low cedar, I discovered right over my head a waxwing's nest with the  mother-bird sitting upon it, while her mate was perched beside her on  the branch. He was barely out of my reach, but he did not move a muscle;  and although he uttered no sound, his behavior said as plainly as  possible, \"What do you expect to do _here_? Don't you see _I_ am  standing guard over this nest?\" I should be ashamed not to be able to  add that I respected his dignity and courage, and left him and his  castle unmolested.    Observations so discursive as these can hardly be finished; they must  break off abruptly, or else go on forever. Let us make an end,  therefore, with expressing our hope that the cedar-bird, already so  handsome and chivalrous, will yet take to himself a song; one sweet and  original, worthy to go with his soft satin coat, his ornaments of  sealing-wax, and his magnificent top-knot. Let him do that, and he shall  always be made welcome; yes, even though he come in force and in  cherry-time.

CHARACTER IN FEATHERS.        The finger of God hath left an inscription upon all his works, not      graphical or composed of letters, but of their several forms,      constitutions, parts, and operations, which, aptly joined together,      do make one word that doth express their natures. By these letters      God calls the stars by their names; and by this alphabet Adam      assigned to every creature a name peculiar to its nature.                                                        SIR THOMAS BROWNE.                               CHARACTER IN FEATHERS.      In this economically governed world the same thing serves many uses. Who  will take upon himself to enumerate the offices of sunlight, or water,  or indeed of any object whatever? Because we know it to be good for this  or that, it by no means follows that we have discovered what it was made  for. What we have found out is perhaps only something by the way; as if  a man should think the sun were created for his own private convenience.  In some moods it seems doubtful whether we are yet acquainted with the  real value of anything. But, be that as it may, we need not scruple to  admire so much as our ignorance permits us to see of the workings of  this divine frugality. The piece of woodland, for instance, which skirts  the village,--how various are its ministries to the inhabitants, each of  whom, without forethought or question, takes the benefit proper to  himself! The poet saunters there as in a true Holy Land, to have his  heart cooled and stilled. Mr. A. and Mr. B., who hold the deeds of the  \"property,\" walk through it to look at the timber, with an eye to  dollars and cents. The botanist has his errand there, the zoologist his,  and the child his. Oftenest of all, perhaps (for barbarism dies hard,  and even yet the ministers of Christ find it a capital sport to murder  small fishes),--oftenest of all comes the man, poor soul, who thinks of  the forest as of a place to which he may go when he wishes to amuse  himself by killing something. Meanwhile, the rabbits and the squirrels,  the hawks and the owls, look upon all such persons as no better than  intruders (do not the woods belong to those who live in them?); while  nobody remembers the meteorologist, who nevertheless smiles in his  sleeve at all these one-sided notions, and says to himself that he knows  the truth of the matter.    So is it with everything; and with all the rest, so is it with the  birds. The interest they excite is of all grades, from that which looks  upon them as items of millinery, up to that of the makers of  ornithological systems, who ransack the world for specimens, and who  have no doubt that the chief end of a bird is to be named and  catalogued,--the more synonyms the better. Somewhere between these two  extremes comes the person whose interest in birds is friendly rather  than scientific; who has little taste for shooting, and an aversion  from dissecting; who delights in the living creatures themselves, and  counts a bird in the bush worth two in the hand. Such a person, if he is  intelligent, makes good use of the best works on ornithology; he would  not know how to get along without them; but he studies most the birds  themselves, and after a while he begins to associate them on a plan of  his own. Not that he distrusts the approximate correctness of the  received classification, or ceases to find it of daily service; but  though it were as accurate as the multiplication table, it is based (and  rightly, no doubt) on anatomical structure alone; it rates birds as  bodies, and nothing else: while to the person of whom we are speaking  birds are, first of all, souls; his interest in them is, as we say,  personal; and we are none of us in the habit of grouping our friends  according to height, or complexion, or any other physical peculiarity.    But it is not proposed in this paper to attempt a new classification of  any sort, even the most unscientific and fanciful. All I am to do is to  set down at random a few studies in such a method as I have indicated;  in short, a few studies in the temperaments of birds. Nor, in making  this attempt, am I unmindful how elusive of analysis traits of character  are, and how diverse is the impression which the same personality  produces upon different observers. In matters of this kind every  judgment is largely a question of emphasis and proportion; and,  moreover, what we find in our friends depends in great part on what we  have in ourselves. This I do not forget; and therefore I foresee that  others will discover in the birds of whom I write many things that I  miss, and perhaps will miss some things which I have treated as patent  or even conspicuous. It remains only for each to testify what he has  seen, and at the end to confess that a soul, even the soul of a bird, is  after all a mystery.    Let our first example, then, be the common black-capped titmouse, or  chickadee. He is, _par excellence_, the bird of the merry heart. There  is a notion current, to be sure, that all birds are merry; but that is  one of those second-hand opinions which a man who begins to observe for  himself soon finds it necessary to give up. With many birds life is a  hard struggle. Enemies are numerous, and the food supply is too often  scanty. Of some species it is probable that very few die in their beds.  But the chickadee seems to be exempt from all forebodings. His coat is  thick, his heart is brave, and, whatever may happen, something will be  found to eat. \"Take no thought for the morrow\" is his creed, which he  accepts, not \"for substance of doctrine,\" but literally. No matter how  bitter the wind or how deep the snow, you will never find the chickadee,  as the saying is, under the weather.

The Reformation, that great revolution in religious thought, loosened  the grasp of the Church upon woman, and is to be looked upon as one of  the most important steps in this reform. In the reign of Elizabeth,  England was called the Paradise of Women. When Elizabeth ascended the  throne, it was not only as queen, but she succeeded her father as the  head of the newly-formed rebellious Church, and she held firm grasp on  both Church and State during the long years of her reign, bending  alike priest and prelate to her fiery will. The reign of Queen Anne,  called the Golden Age of English Literature, is especially noticeable  on account of Mary Astell and Elizabeth Elstob. The latter, speaking  nine languages, was most famous for her skill in the Saxon tongue. She  also replied to current objections made to woman's learning. Mary  Astell elaborated a plan for a Woman's College, which was favorably  received by Queen Anne, and would have been carried out, but for the  opposition of Bishop Burnett.    During the latter part of the eighteenth century, there were public  discussions by women in England, under the general head of Female  Parliament. These discussions took wide range, touching upon the  entrance of men into those industries usually assigned to women, and  demanding for themselves higher educational advantages, and the right  to vote at elections, and to be returned members of Parliament.    The American Revolution, that great political rebellion of the ages,  was based upon the inherent rights of the individual. Perhaps in none  but English Colonies, by descendants of English parents, could such a  revolution have been consummated. England had never felt the bonds of  feudalism to the extent of many countries; its people had defied its  monarchs and wrested from them many civil rights, rights which  protected women as well as men, and although its common law, warped by  ecclesiasticism, expended its chief rigors upon women, yet at an early  day they enjoyed certain ecclesiastical and political powers unknown  to women elsewhere. Before the Conquest, abbesses sat in councils of  the Church and signed its decrees; while kings were even dependent  upon their consent in granting certain charters. The synod of Whitby,  in the ninth century, was held in the convent of the Abbess Hilda, she  herself presiding over its deliberations. The famous prophetess of  Kent at one period communicated the orders of Heaven to the Pope  himself. Ladies of birth and quality sat in council with the Saxon  Witas--_i.e._, wise men--taking part in the Witenagemot, the great  National Council of our Saxon ancestors in England. In the seventh  century this National Council met at Baghamstead to enact a new code  of laws, the queen, abbesses, and many ladies of quality taking part  and signing the decrees. Passing by other similar instances, we find  in the reign of Henry III, that four women took seats in Parliament,  and in the reign of Edward I. ten ladies were called to Parliament,  while in the thirteenth century, Queen Elinor became keeper of the  Great Seal, sitting as Lord Chancellor in the _Aula Regia_, the  highest court of the Kingdom. Running back two or three centuries  before the Christian era, we find Martia, her seat of power in London,  holding the reins of government so wisely as to receive the surname of  Proba, the Just. She especially devoted herself to the enactment of  just laws for her subjects, the first principles of the common law  tracing back to her; the celebrated laws of Alfred, and of Edward the  Confessor, being in great degree restorations and compilations from  the laws of Martia, which were known as the \"Martian Statutes.\"    When the American colonies began their resistance to English tyranny,  the women--all this inherited tendency to freedom surging in their  veins--were as active, earnest, determined, and self-sacrificing as  the men, and although, as Mrs. Ellet in her \"Women of the Revolution\"  remarks, \"political history says but little, and that vaguely and  incidentally, of the women who bore their part in the revolution,\" yet  that little shows woman to have been endowed with as lofty a  patriotism as man, and to have as fully understood the principles upon  which the struggle was based. Among the women who manifested deep  political insight, were Mercy Otis Warren, Abigail Smith Adams, and  Hannah Lee Corbin; all closely related to the foremost men of the  Revolution. Mrs. Warren was a sister of James Otis, whose fiery words  did so much to arouse and intensify the feelings of the colonists  against British aggression. This brother and sister were united to the  end of their lives in a friendship rendered firm and enduring by the  similarity of their intellects and political views. The home of Mrs.  Warren was the resort of patriotic spirits and the headquarters of the  rebellion. She herself wrote, \"By the Plymouth fireside were many  political plans organized, discussed, and digested.\" Her  correspondence with eminent men of the Revolution was extensive and  belongs to the history of the country. She was the first one who based  the struggle upon \"inherent rights,\" a phrase afterward made the  corner-stone of political authority. Mrs. Warren asserted that  \"'inherent rights' belonged to all mankind, and had been conferred on  all by the God of nations.\" She numbered Jefferson among her  correspondents, and the Declaration of Independence shows the  influence of her mind. Among others who sought her counsel upon  political matters were Samuel and John Adams, Dickinson, that pure  patriot of Pennsylvania, Jefferson, Gerry, and Knox. She was the first  person who counseled separation and pressed those views upon John  Adams, when he sought her advice before the opening of the first  Congress. At that time even Washington had no thought of the final  independence of the colonies, emphatically denying such intention or  desire on their part, and John Adams was shunned in the streets of  Philadelphia for having dared to hint such a possibility. Mrs. Warren  sustained his sinking courage and urged him to bolder steps. Her  advice was not only sought in every emergency, but political parties  found their arguments in her conversation. Mrs. Warren looked not to  the freedom of man alone, but to that of her own sex also.    England itself had at least one woman who watched the struggle of  America with lively interest, and whose writings aided in the  dissemination of republican ideas. This was the celebrated Catharine  Sawbridge Macaulay, one of the greatest minds England has ever  produced--a woman so noted for her republican ideas that after her  death a statue was erected to her as the \"Patroness of Liberty.\"  During the whole of the Revolutionary period, Washington was in  correspondence with Mrs. Macaulay, who did much to sustain him during  those days of trial. She and Mrs. Warren were also correspondents at  that time. She wrote several works of a republican character, for home  influence; among these, in 1775. \"An Address to the people of England,  Scotland, and Ireland, on the present Important Crisis of Affairs,\"  designed to show the justice of the American cause. The gratitude  American's feel toward Edmund Burke for his aid, might well be  extended to Mrs. Macaulay.    Abigail Smith Adams, the wife of John Adams, was an American woman  whose political insight was worthy of remark. She early protested  against the formation of a new government in which woman should be  unrecognized, demanding for her a voice and representation. She was  the first American woman who threatened rebellion unless the rights of  her sex were secured. In March, 1776, she wrote to her husband, then  in the Continental Congress, \"I long to hear you have declared an  independency, and, by the way, in the new code of laws which I suppose  it will be necessary for you to make, I desire you would remember the  ladies, and be more generous and favorable to them than your  ancestors. Do not put such unlimited power into the hands of husbands.  Remember, all men would be tyrants if they could. If particular care  and attention are not paid to the ladies, we are determined to foment  a rebellion, and will not hold ourselves bound to obey any laws in  which we have no voice or representation.\" Again and again did Mrs.  Adams urge the establishment of an independency and the limitation of  man's power over woman, declaring all arbitrary power dangerous and  tending to revolution. Nor was she less mindful of equal advantages  of education. \"If you complain of education in sons, what shall I say  in regard to daughters, who every day experience the want of it?\" She  expressed a strong wish that the new Constitution might be  distinguished for its encouragement of learning and virtue. Nothing  more fully shows the dependent condition of a class than the methods  used to secure their wishes. Mrs. Adams felt herself obliged to appeal  to masculine selfishness in showing the reflex action woman's  education would have upon man. \"If,\" said she, \"we mean to have  heroes, statesmen, and philosophers, we should have learned women.\"  Thus did the Revolutionary Mothers urge the recognition of equal  rights when the Government was in the process of formation. Although  the first plot of ground in the United States for a public school had  been given by a woman (Bridget Graffort), in 1700, her sex were denied  admission. Mrs. Adams, as well as her friend Mrs. Warren, had in their  own persons felt the deprivations of early educational advantages. The  boasted public school system of Massachusetts, created for boys only,  opened at last its doors to girls, merely to secure its share of  public money. The women of the South, too, early demanded political  equality. The counties of"]]]
