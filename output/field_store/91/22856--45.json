Yes, you must give those boys a share        Of golden wine and your own care.      MATROSEN.      Man hört sie nicht?          SAILORS.          They keep so quiet.      STEUERMANN.      Ei, seht doch nur!    Kein Licht! Von der Mannschaft keine Spur.          MATE.          A strange sight!        No sailors on deck and no light!      MAEDCHEN.        He! Seeleut'! He! Wollt Fackeln ihr?    Wo seid ihr doch? Man sieht nicht hier.          GIRLS.          Ho, sailors, ho! shall we bring light,        And make your ship look bright?      MATROSEN.      Weckt sie nicht auf; sie schlafen noch.          SAILORS.          Don't awake them; they are sleeping still.      MAEDCHEN.      He! Seeleut'! He! Antwortet doch!          GIRLS.          Ho! sailors! ho! give answer us!      STEUERMANN UND MATROSEN.      Haha! Wahrhaftig, sie sind todt.    Sie haben Speis' und Trank nicht noth.          MATE AND SAILORS.          Ha! ha! they are dead, indeed.          No meat and drink they will need.      MAEDCHEN.      Wie, Seeleute? Liegt Ihr so faul schon im Nest?    Ist heute für Euch denn nicht auch ein Fest?

Sie liegen fest auf ihrem Platz,    Wie Drachen hüten sie den Schatz.          MATE AND SAILORS.          They watch the treasures in the hold,        They guard the gems and stones and gold.

You've heard of the _Flying Dutchman_, perhaps,        And this must be one of his ugly traps.      MAEDCHEN.      So wecket die Mannschaft ja nicht auf,    Gespenster sind's, wir schwören drauf!          GIRLS.          Then leave them alone, leave them at rest;        'Tis really no time for such jest.

Sie sind schon alt und bleich statt roth;    Ach! ihre Liebsten, die sind todt!          GIRLS.          Ah, well! they have no loved ones on the strand;        Their sweethearts died while they roamed in foreign land.      MATROSEN.      Hei! Seeleute! Spannt Eure Segel doch auf!    Und zeigt uns des fliegenden Holländers Lauf!          SAILORS.          Ho! sailors, ho! hoist the sails, quick, quick!        And show us the _Flying Dutchman's_ trick.      MAEDCHEN.      Sie hören nicht, -- uns graust es hier!    Sie wollen nichts, -- was rufen wir?          GIRLS.          They hear us not, so let them rest;        They might revenge this sport and jest.      MATROSEN.      Ihr Mädel, lasst die Todten ruh'n!    Lasst's uns Lebend'gen glücklich thun!          SAILORS.

Come on board our safely-anchored brig,        And join us dancing a jolly jig.      MAEDCHEN.      Ei, jetzt noch nicht, es ist nicht spät.    Wir kommen bald, jetzt trinkt nur fort.

But the resident male  has a journey to perform, short though it may be; it, too, has a  destination to reach, neither a country nor a locality, but a place  wherein the rearing of offspring can be safely accomplished, and it,  too, arrives in that place in advance of the female.    With these facts at our disposal, we will endeavour to find an  explanation. It is unlikely that specialised behaviour would occur in  generation after generation under such widely divergent conditions,  and, moreover, expose the birds to risk of special dangers, if it were  but an hereditary peculiarity to which no meaning could be attached.  Hence the appearance of the males in their breeding haunts ahead of the  females becomes a fact of some importance, and suggests that the  extensive journey in the one case, and the short journey in the other,  may both have a similar biological end to serve.    Darwin evidently attached importance to this difference between the  males and the females in their times of arrival. In the _Descent of Man_  he referred to it as follows: \"Those males which annually first migrated  in any country, or which in spring were first ready to breed, or were  the most eager, would leave the largest number of offspring; and these  would tend to inherit similar instincts and constitutions. It must be  borne in mind that it would have been impossible to change very  materially the time of sexual maturity in the females without at the  same time interfering with the period of the production of the young--a  period which must be determined by the season of the year.\" Newton  suggested the following explanation[2]: \"It is not difficult to  imagine that, in the course of a journey prolonged through some 50 deg.  or 60 deg. of latitude, the stronger individuals should outstrip the  weaker by a very perceptible distance, and it can hardly be doubted that  in most species the males are stouter, as they are bigger than the  females.\" Granting that the males are the stronger, how can this account  for their outstripping the females by a week, ten days, or even a  fortnight, in a journey of perhaps 1500 miles? To expect the birds to  accomplish such a distance in seven days is surely not estimating their  capabilities too highly, and any slight inequality in the power of  flight or endurance could give the males an advantage of a few hours  only. But this explanation, based upon inequalities in the power of  flight and endurance on the one hand, and the magnitude of the distance  traversed on the other, cannot afford a solution of the behaviour of the  resident males, and is less likely, therefore, to be a true solution of  that of the migrants.    There is another theory, simple enough in its way, which will probably  occur to many. It is based on the assumption that the males reach sexual  maturity before the females; and it is contended that the functioning of  the instincts which contribute towards the biological end of  reproduction depend upon the organic changes which the term \"sexual  maturity\" is held to embrace, and that, inasmuch as the migratory  instinct belongs to the group of such instincts, the males must be the  first to leave their winter quarters.    What is meant by the \"migratory instinct\"? To speak of it as one of the  instincts concerned in reproduction is not enough. Reproduction involves  the actual discharge of the sexual function, which involves the  females; but the first visible manifestation of organic change in the  male is its desertion of the females. Yet this is the behaviour which is  referred to as the \"migratory instinct,\" and which comes into play,  according to this theory, because the bird has reached sexual maturity.  Manifestly we must have some clear understanding as to what these terms  represent. That organic changes determine the functioning of certain  definite instincts at certain specified times there can be no doubt;  that these changes may occur at a somewhat earlier date in the male than  in the female is more than probable, but that this explains the  behaviour in question I do not believe. One wants to know why the  changes should occur earlier in the male, what disposition it is which  first comes into functional activity, and to what such disposition is  related.    It may, however, be urged that, after all, this apparent eagerness to  reach the breeding grounds is but a modification of hereditary procedure  under the guiding hand of experience. What more likely result would  follow from the enjoyment associated with previous success in the  attainment of reproduction than a craving to repeat the experience? What  stronger incentive to a hurried return could be imagined? It must be  admitted that there are certain facts which might be used in support of  an appeal to experience as a reasonable explanation. For example, the  first males to arrive often display that richness of colouring which is  generally supposed to indicate a fuller maturity. Gaetke even speaks of  the \"most handsome old birds being invariably the first to hasten back  to their old homes.\" But if experience is a factor, if some dim  recollection of the past is held to explain the hurried departure of the  male migrant, one wants to know with what such recollection is  associated. Is it associated with the former female, or with the former  breeding place, or with both? I take it that any recollection, no matter  how vague, must be primarily associated with the particular place  wherein reproduction had previously been accomplished; and I grant that  if the first individuals to appear were invariably the older and  experienced birds, their early return might be explained on the basis of  such an association. But if there is reason to believe that a proportion  are young birds on the verge of carrying out their instinctive routine  for the first time, then we cannot appeal to past experience in  explanation of their behaviour.    The age of a bird is difficult to determine. Experience leads me to  believe that some of the males that arrive before the females are birds  born the previous season; one finds, for instance, individuals with  plumage of a duller hue, which denotes immaturity, amongst the first  batch of arrivals. But though plumage may sometimes be a satisfactory  guide, yet to rely upon it alone, or upon a more perfect development of  feather, is to exceed the limits of safety. How, then, can we ascertain  whether all the males that arrive before the females have had some  previous experience of reproduction? Well, we take a particular locality  and note the migrants that visit it year after year, and we find that  the respective numbers of the different species are subject to wide  annual fluctuations. Not every species lends itself to an inquiry of  this kind: some are always plentiful and fluctuation is consequently  difficult to discern; others are scarce and variation is easily  determined. Those which are of local distribution but conspicuous by  their plumage, or easily traced by the beauty or the peculiarity of  their song, afford the more suitable subjects for investigation. For  example, the Grasshopper-Warbler, Marsh-Warbler, Nightingale, Corncrake,  Red-backed Shrike, or Whinchat have each some distinctive peculiarity  which makes them conspicuous, and each one is subject to marked  fluctuation in numbers. The small plantation or wooded bank may hold a  Nightingale one year, but we miss its song there the next; the osier bed  or gorse-covered common which vibrates with the trill of the  Grasshopper-Warbler one April is deserted the following season; the  plantation which is occupied by a host of common migrants this summer  may be enlivened next year by the song of the rarer Marsh-Warbler also;  and so on. The fluctuation is considerable: we observe desertion on the  one hand, appropriation on the other, and yet males appear before  females whether the particular plantation, osier bed, or swamp had been  inhabited or not the previous season. This fact is not without  significance. It shows that similar conditions prevail both amongst the  males that appropriate breeding grounds new to them, and amongst those  that return to some well-established haunt; and on the assumption that  the earlier arrivals are experienced males, the same birds evidently do  not return to the same place year after year. Granting, then, that the  males which appropriate new breeding-grounds are young birds, how can  their earlier arrival be explained in terms of past experience; and  granting that they are old, and therefore experienced, how can it be  explained in terms of association?    Again, it may be urged that if there is some biological end to be  furthered by this hurried return, and if recollection of past experience  is a means towards that end, such recollection need not necessarily be  associated with a definite place, but only in a vague way with the whole  series of events leading up to reproduction--in which series the  migratory journey may even have acquired meaning. Whether there be any  recollection of a previous journey or of a nest with young, I do not  know. But the young bird is capable of performing its journey, of  building its nest, and of rearing its young antecedent to  experience--racial preparation has fitted it thus far; why then exclude  the other event in the series, the earlier departure of the male, from  hereditary equipment? If the journey were a casual affair without any  goal attaching to it, if the males upon arrival wandered about in search  of a mate, there would be some ground for thinking that a vague  recollection of the whole former experience was sufficient"]]]
