Once she threw a glance toward the window, and  caught a glimpse, through its red curtains, of the snow-covered roofs  and the stars glimmering frostily, and all the delicious intensity of  the cold night. The bleak wind rattled the window-panes as if it were  summoning her to come forth. But there stood the snow-child, drooping,  before the hot stove!    But the common-sensible man saw nothing amiss.    \"Come, wife,\" said he, \"let her have a pair of thick stockings and a  woolen shawl or blanket directly; and tell Dora to give her some warm  supper as soon as the milk boils. You, Violet and Peony, amuse your  little friend. She is out of spirits, you see, at finding herself in a  strange place. For my part, I will go around among the neighbours and  find out where she belongs.\"    The mother, meanwhile, had gone in search of the shawl and stockings.  Without heeding the remonstrance of his two children, who still kept  murmuring that their little snow-sister did not love the warmth, good  Mr. Lindsey took his departure, shutting the parlour door carefully  behind him.    Turning up the collar of his sack over his ears, he emerged from the  house, and had barely reached the street-gate, when he was recalled by  the screams of Violet and Peony and the rapping of a thimbled finger  against the parlour window.    \"Husband! husband!\" cried his wife, showing her horror-stricken face  through the window panes. \"There is no need of going for the child's  parents!\"    \"We told you so, father!\" screamed Violet and Peony, as he re-entered  the parlour. \"You would bring her in; and now our poor--dear--beau-ti-ful  little snow-sister is thawed!\"    And their own sweet little faces were already dissolved in tears; so  that their father, seeing what strange things occasionally happen in  this every-day world, felt not a little anxious lest his children  might be going to thaw too. In the utmost perplexity, he demanded an  explanation of his wife. She could only reply that, being summoned to  the parlour by cries of Violet and Peony, she found no trace of the  little white maiden, unless it were the remains of a heap of snow,  which, while she was gazing at it, melted quite away upon the  hearth-rug.    \"And there you see all that is left of it!\" added she, pointing to a  pool of water, in front of the stove.    \"Yes, father,\" said Violet, looking reproachfully at him through her  tears, \"there is all that is left of our dear little snow-sister!\"    \"Naughty father!\" cried Peony, stamping his foot, and--I shudder to  say--shaking his little fist at the common-sensible man. \"We told you  how it would be! What for did you bring her in?\"    And the stove, through the isinglass of its door, seemed to glare at  good Mr. Lindsey, like a red-eyed demon, triumphing in the mischief  which it had done! (_Abridged._)          WINTER WOODS          THE FIRST SNOW-FALL          The snow had begun in the gloaming,        And busily all the night      Had been heaping field and highway        With a silence deep and white.        Every pine and fir and hemlock        Wore ermine too dear for an earl,      And the poorest twig on the elm tree        Was ridged inch deep with pearl.                            James Russell Lowell.          THE VOICE OF THE PINE TREES    (Japanese Legend)          \"And all the while      The voice of the breeze      As it blows through the firs      That grow old together      Will yield us delight.\"    In ancient days there lived a fisherman and his wife, and little  daughter Matsue. There was nothing that Matsue loved to do more than  to sit under the great pine tree. She was particularly fond of the  pine needles that never seemed tired of falling to the ground. With  these she fashioned a beautiful dress and sash, saying, \"I will not  wear these pine clothes until my wedding day.\"    One day while Matsue was sitting under the pine tree, she sang the  following song:        \"No one so callous but he heaves a sigh      When o'er his head the withered cherry flowers      Come fluttering down. Who knows?--the spring's soft showers      May be but tears shed by the sorrowing sky.\"    While thus she sang Teogo stood on the steep shore of Sumiyoshi  watching the flight of a heron. Up, up, it went into the blue sky, and  Teogo saw it fly over the village where the fishfolk and their  daughter lived.    Now Teogo was a youth who dearly loved adventure and he thought it  would be very delightful to swim across the sea and discover the land  over which the heron had flown. So one morning he dived into the sea  and swam so hard and so long that the poor fellow found the waves  spinning and dancing and saw the great sky bend down and try to touch  him. Then he lay unconscious on the water; but the waves were kind to  him after all, for they pressed him on and on till he was washed up at  the very place where Matsue sat under the pine tree.    Matsue carefully dragged Teogo underneath its sheltering branches,  and then set him down upon a couch of pine needles, where he soon  regained consciousness and warmly thanked Matsue for her kindness.    Teogo did not go back to his own country, for, after a few happy  months had gone by, he married Matsue and on her wedding morn she wore  her dress and sash of pine needles.    When Matsue's parents died her loss only seemed to make her love for  Teogo the more. The older they grew the more they loved each other.  Every night when the moon shone, they went hand in hand to the pine  tree and with their little rake they made a couch for the morrow.    One night the great silver face of the moon peered through the  branches of the pine tree and looked in vain for the two sitting  together on a couch of pine needles. Their little rakes lay side by  side and still the moon waited for the slow steps of these pine tree  lovers. But that night they did not come. They had gone home to an  everlasting place on the River of Souls.    They had loved so well and so splendidly, in old age as well as in  youth, that their souls were allowed to come back again and wander  round the pine tree that had listened to their love for so many years.    When the moon is full they whisper and laugh and sing and draw the  pine needles together, while the sea sings softly upon the shore:        \"The dawn is near      And the hoar-frost falls      On the fir tree twigs;      But its leaves dark green      Suffer no change.      Morning and evening      Beneath its shade      The leaves are swept away,      Yet they never fail.      True it is      That these fir trees      Shed not all their leaves;      Their verdure remains fresh      For ages long,      As the Masaka's trailing vine;      Even amongst evergreen trees--      The emblem of unchangeableness--      Exalted is their fame      As a symbol to the end of time.      The fame of the fir trees that      Have grown old together.\"          THE PINE TREE MAIDEN    (Indian Legend)      In an Indian village which stood near the Big Sea Water lived a  beautiful little girl whose name was Leelinau. Her chief delight was  to wander among the pine trees of a sacred grove which bordered the  great waters. Here she passed many hours watching the sunlight dance  on the stems of the tall trees and listening to the soft music of the  wind as it came up from the sea and played in the forest.    The child's desire to spend so much of her time alone in the grove  made her little companions regard her with awe, and they sometimes  whispered together about the meaning of her strange journeys to the  deep woods.    \"Leelinau goes to the forest to play with the Puckwudjinies. She  dances with the fairy folk and talks to them in their own language,\"  said the Indian children when they saw the little girl's figure  hurrying toward the grove of pine trees.    Leelinau's parents took little notice of her strange attraction for  the lonely forest. They thought it was a childish fancy which would  vanish in a few years. But the little girl grew into a beautiful  slender maiden and still she visited her retreat with increasing  delight.    \"When Leelinau goes to the forest the air is filled with the sweetest  perfume and the trees nod their feathery plumes in welcome to her,\"  whispered the youths and maidens of the village. \"Some say she calls  the pine trees by name and they answer her in a strange language which  she understands.\"    One day it happened that an Indian hunter, who was a mighty chief,  passed through the sacred grove. There, leaning against her favourite  tree, a stately pine, he saw Leelinau, a dark-haired maiden  marvellously beautiful. In a few days the chief sought her parents and  laid before them rich gifts, saying that he wished to make the forest  maiden his bride.    To the surprise of all the people in the village Leelinau took no joy  in her approaching marriage to the great chief. To be sure, she made  no complaint, for she was an obedient daughter. But each day, when she  returned from her accustomed journey to the forest, she was sad and  thoughtful. Sometimes she stood before her father's tepee and looked  with wistful eyes toward her beloved grove.    At last the day arrived on which the great chief would claim her for  his bride. The forest maiden dressed herself in her beautiful wedding  robe and took her usual walk into the forest. Her parents were not  surprised that she should wish to take a farewell look at the grove  where she had spent so many happy hours, and which she was about to  leave, for the great chief lived many miles away.    When she reached the forest she hastened to her beautiful pine tree.  Clinging to the trunk she wept bitterly and whispered the story of her  coming marriage to a war chief from whom her heart shrank in fear.  When she had finished there was a soft rustling in the branches  overhead and a voice said: \"Leelinau!

The divinity of the Christ was made          manifest in the humanity of Jesus.                              Individual experience    26:1    While we adore Jesus, and the heart overflows with          gratitude for what he did for mortals, - treading alone  26:3    his loving pathway up to the throne of          glory, in speechless agony exploring the way          for us, - yet Jesus spares us not one individual expe-  26:6    rience, if we follow his commands faithfully; and all          have the cup of sorrowful effort to drink in proportion          to their demonstration of his love, till all are redeemed  26:9    through divine Love.                             Christ's demonstration            The Christ was the Spirit which Jesus implied in his          own statements: \"I am the way, the truth, and the life;\"  26:12   \"I and my Father are one.\" This Christ,          or divinity of the man Jesus, was his divine          nature, the godliness which animated him. Divine Truth,  26:15   Life, and Love gave Jesus authority over sin, sickness,          and death. His mission was to reveal the Science of          celestial being, to prove what God is and what He does  26:18   for man.                                Proof in practice            A musician demonstrates the beauty of the music he          teaches in order to show the learner the way by prac-  26:21   tice as well as precept. Jesus' teaching and          practice of Truth involved such a sacrifice          as makes us admit its Principle to be Love. This was  26:24   the precious import of our Master's sinless career and          of his demonstration of power over death. He proved          by his deeds that Christian Science destroys sickness, sin,  26:27   and death.            Our Master taught no mere theory, doctrine, or belief.          It was the divine Principle of all real being which he  26:30   taught and practised. His proof of Christianity was no          form or system of religion and worship, but Christian          Science, working out the harmony of Life and Love.  27:1    Jesus sent a message to John the Baptist, which was in-          tended to prove beyond a question that the Christ had  27:3    come: \"Go your way, and tell John what things ye have          seen and heard; how that the blind see, the lame walk,          the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised,  27:6    to the poor the gospel is preached.\" In other words:          Tell John what the demonstration of divine power is,          and he will at once perceive that God is the power in  27:9    the Messianic work.                                  Living temple            That Life is God, Jesus proved by his reappearance          after the crucifixion in strict accordance with his scien-  27:12   tific statement: \"Destroy this temple [body],          and in three days I [Spirit] will raise it up.\"          It is as if he had said: The I - the Life, substance,  27:15   and intelligence of the universe - is not in matter to          be destroyed.            Jesus' parables explain Life as never mingling with  27:18   sin and death. He laid the axe of Science at the root          of material knowledge, that it might be ready to cut          down the false doctrine of pantheism, - that God, or  27:21   Life, is in or of matter.                               Recreant disciples            Jesus sent forth seventy students at one time, but only          eleven left a desirable historic record. Tradition credits  27:24   him with two or three hundred other disciples          who have left no name. \"Many are called,          but few are chosen.\" They fell away from grace because  27:27   they never truly understood their Master's instruction.            Why do those who profess to follow Christ reject the          essential religion he came to establish? Jesus' persecu-  27:30   tors made their strongest attack upon this very point.          They endeavored to hold him at the mercy of matter and          to kill him according to certain assumed material laws.                               Help and hindrance    28:1    The Pharisees claimed to know and to teach the di-          vine will, but they only hindered the success of Jesus'  28:3    mission. Even many of his students stood          in his way. If the Master had not taken a          student and taught the unseen verities of God, he would  28:6    not have been crucified. The determination to hold Spirit          in the grasp of matter is the persecutor of Truth and          Love.    28:9    While respecting all that is good in the Church or out          of it, one's consecration to Christ is more on the ground          of demonstration than of profession. In conscience, we  28:12   cannot hold to beliefs outgrown; and by understanding          more of the divine Principle of the deathless Christ, we          are enabled to heal the sick and to triumph over sin.                             Misleading conceptions    28:15   Neither the origin, the character, nor the work of          Jesus was generally understood. Not a single compo-          nent part of his nature did the material  28:18   world measure aright. Even his righteous-          less and purity did not hinder men from saying: He          is a glutton and a friend of the impure, and Beelzebub is  28:21   his patron.                              Persecution prolonged            Remember, thou Christian martyr, it is enough if          thou art found worthy to unloose the sandals of thy  28:24   Master's feet! To suppose that persecution          for righteousness' sake belongs to the past,          and that Christianity to-day is at peace with the world  28:27   because it is honored by sects and societies, is to mis-          take the very nature of religion. Error repeats itself.          The trials encountered by prophet, disciple, and apostle,  28:30   \"of whom the world was not worthy,\" await, in some          form, every pioneer of truth.                                Christian warfare            There is too much animal courage in society and not  29:1    sufficient moral courage. Christians must take up arms          against error at home and abroad. They must grapple  29:3    with sin in themselves and in others, and          continue this warfare until they have finished          their course. If they keep the faith, they will have the  29:6    crown of rejoicing.            Christian experience teaches faith in the right and dis-          belief in the wrong. It bids us work the more earnestly  29:9    in times of persecution, because then our labor is more          needed. Great is the reward of self-sacrifice, though we          may never receive it in this world.                              The Fatherhood of God    29:12   There is a tradition that Publius Lentulus wrote to          the authorities at Rome: \"The disciples of Jesus be-          lieve him the Son of God.\" Those instructed  29:15   in Christian Science have reached the glori-          ous perception that God is the only author of man.          The Virgin-mother conceived this idea of God, and  29:18   gave to her ideal the name of Jesus - that is, Joshua,          or Saviour.                              Spiritual conception            The illumination of Mary's spiritual sense put to  29:21   silence material law and its order of generation, and          brought forth her child by the revelation of          Truth, demonstrating God as the Father of  29:24   men. The Holy Ghost, or divine Spirit, overshadowed          the pure sense of the Virgin-mother with the full recog-          nition that being is Spirit. The Christ dwelt forever  29:27   an idea in the bosom of God, the divine Principle of the          man Jesus, and woman perceived this spiritual idea,          though at first faintly developed.    29:30   Man as the offspring of God, as the idea of Spirit,          is the immortal evidence that Spirit is harmonious and          man eternal. Jesus was the offspring of Mary's self-  30:1    conscious communion with God. Hence he could give          a more spiritual idea of life than other men, and could  30:3    demonstrate the Science of Love - his Father or divine          Principle.                              Jesus the way-shower            Born of a woman, Jesus' advent in the flesh partook  30:6    partly of Mary's earthly condition, although he was en-          dowed with the Christ, the divine Spirit, with-          out measure. This accounts for his struggles  30:9    in Gethsemane and on Calvary, and this enabled him to          be the mediator, or /way-shower/, between God and men.          Had his origin and birth been wholly apart from mortal  30:12   usage, Jesus would not have been appreciable to mortal          mind as \"the way.\"            Rabbi and priest taught the Mosaic law, which said:  30:15   \"An eye for an eye,\" and \"Whoso sheddeth man's blood,          by man shall his blood be shed.\" Not so did Jesus, the          new executor for God, present the divine law of Love,  30:18   which blesses even those that curse it.                                 Rebukes helpful            As the individual ideal of Truth, Christ Jesus came to          rebuke rabbinical error and all sin, sickness, and death,-  30:21   to point out the way of Truth and Life. This          ideal was demonstrated throughout the whole          earthly career of Jesus, showing the difference between  30:24   the offspring of Soul and of material sense, of Truth and          of error.            If we have triumphed sufficiently over the errors of  30:27   material sense to allow Soul to hold the control, we          shall loathe sin and rebuke it under every mask. Only          in this way can we bless our enemies, though they  30:30   may not so construe our words. We cannot choose for"]]]
