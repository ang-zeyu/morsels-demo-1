And many shall  follow their pernicious ways; by reason of whom the way of truth shall  be evil spoken of. And through covetousness shall they with feigned  words make merchandise of you: whose judgment now of a long time  lingereth not, and their damnation slumbereth not.\"--(II Peter 2:1-3.  Read the entire chapter, noting the description of conditions existing  in the world today.)    33. Jude, the brother of James, in his general epistle to the saints,  reminds them of earlier warnings: \"But, beloved, remember ye the words  which were spoken before of the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ; How  that they told you there should be mockers in the last time, who  should walk after their own ungodly lusts.\"--(Jude 17, 18.)    34. John, who is called the Revelator, saw in vision the state of the  world in the days then future. Describing the spirit of  unrighteousness as a hideous beast, and its author, Satan, as the  dragon, he says: \"And they worshiped the dragon which gave power unto  the beast: and they worshiped the beast, saying, Who is like unto the  beast? who is able to make war with him? * * * And he opened his mouth  in blasphemy against God, to blaspheme his name, and his tabernacle,  and them that dwell in heaven. And it was given unto him to make war  with the saints, and to overcome them: and power was given him over  all kindreds, and tongues, and nations. And all that dwell upon the  earth shall worship him, whose names are not written in the book of  life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world. If any man  have an ear, let him hear.\"--(Rev. 13:4,6-9.)    35. Note another prophecy based on the vision of John the Revelator.  Again referring to latter-day conditions he declares: \"And I saw  another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting  gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every  nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people, Saying with a loud voice,  Fear God, and give glory to him; for the hour of his judgment is come:  and worship him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the  fountains of water.\"--(Rev. 14:6, 7.)    36. While it is true that the scripture last quoted does not  specifically predict the apostasy, the breaking up of the Church is  treated as an event actually accomplished. The Revelator looked beyond  the period of disruption and saw the brighter day of the restoration  of the gospel,--a re-establishment of the Church through the ministry  of an angel. It is illogical to assume that the gospel was to be  brought to earth by a heavenly messenger if that gospel was still  extant upon the earth. Equally unreasonable is it to say that a  restoration or re-establishment of the Church of Christ would be  necessary or possible had the Church continued with rightful  succession of priesthood and power. If the gospel had to be brought  again from the heavens, the gospel must have been taken from the  earth. Thus the prophecy of a restoration is proof of an apostasy  general and complete.    **Apostasy on the Western Hemisphere Predicted**.    37. In the preceding chapter it was shown that the Church of Christ  was established by the Risen Lord among the Nephites of the western  world. It was foreseen that the powers of evil would be permitted to  prevail in the west as in the east. Consider the fateful words of the  prophet Alma addressed to his son Helaman: \"Behold, I perceive that  this very people, the Nephites, according to the spirit of revelation  which is in me, in four hundred years from the time that Jesus Christ  shall manifest himself unto them, shall dwindle in unbelief; Yea, and  then shall they see wars and pestilence, yea, famines and bloodshed,  even until the people of Nephi shall become extinct; Yea, and this  because they shall dwindle in unbelief, and fall into the works of  darkness, and lasciviousness, and all manner of iniquities; yea, I say  unto you, that because they shall sin against so great light and  knowledge; yea, I say unto you, that from that day, even the fourth  generation shall not pass away, before this great iniquity shall  come.\"--(Alma 45:10-12.)    38. An earlier prophecy relating to the degradation of the surviving  remnant of Lehi's descendants, was uttered by Nephi, as a result of a  revelation communicated to him through angelic visitation. He thus  describes his vision of the future: \"I beheld and saw that the seed of  my brethren did contend against my seed, according to the word of the  angel; and because of the pride of my seed, and the temptations of the  devil, I beheld that the seed of my brethren did overpower the people  of my seed. And it came to pass that I beheld and saw the people of  the seed of my brethren, that they had overcome my seed; and they went  forth in multitudes upon the face of the land. And I saw them gathered  together in multitudes; and I saw wars and rumors of wars among them;  and in wars and rumors of wars, I saw many generations pass away. And  the angel said unto me, Behold these shall dwindle in unbelief. And it  came to pass that I beheld after they had dwindled in unbelief, they  became a dark, and loathsome, and filthy people, full of idleness and  all manner of abominations.\"--(I Nephi 12:19-23. For other Book of  Mormon predictions of spiritual decline on the western continent, see  II Nephi 27:1; read also II Nephi 26:19-22, and chapter 29.) The  degraded state of the North American Indians,--descendants of a  prophet-father--is a striking realization of this prophetic  declaration.    39. The scriptures cited are sufficient to show that widespread  apostasy from the Church was foreseen; that the corruption of the  Church itself was likewise foreknown; and that on both hemispheres a  general apostasy was foretold.      NOTES.    1. _The Church, Primitive and Restored_. The Church of Jesus Christ of  Latter-day Saints declares by its name a distinction from the  Primitive Church as established by Christ and His early apostles. The  essential designation of the restored Church is the Church of Jesus  Christ; its authorized name is the Church of Jesus Christ of  Latter-day Saints, the final phrase being added to distinguish the  Church as established in the present dispensation from the Church as  organized by the Savior during the period of His earthly ministry.  This distinction is shown in one of our Articles of Faith: \"We (the  Church of today) believe in the same organization that existed in the  Primitive Church.\"    2. _Man's Free Agency_. The teachings of the restored Church  respecting individual freedom of action are thus summarized: \"The  Church holds and teaches as a strictly scriptural doctrine, that man  has inherited among the inalienable rights conferred upon him by his  divine Father, absolute freedom to choose the good or the evil in life  as he may elect. This right cannot be guarded with more jealous care  than is bestowed upon it by God Himself; for in all His dealings with  man, He has left the mortal creature free to choose and to act, with  no semblance of compulsion or restraint, beyond the influences of  paternal counsel and loving direction. True, He has given  commandments, and has established statutes, with promises of blessings  for compliance and dire penalties for infraction; but in the choice of  these, God's children are untrammeled. In this respect, man is no less  free than are the angels and the Gods, except as he has fettered  himself with the bonds of sin, and forfeited his power of will and  force of soul. The individual has a full measure of liberty to violate  the laws of health, the requirements of nature, and the commandments  of God in matters both temporal and spiritual, as he has to obey all  such; in the one case he brings upon himself the sure penalties that  belong to the broken law; as in the other he inherits the specific  blessings and the added freedom that attend a law-abiding life.  Obedience to law is the habit of the free man; 'tis the transgressor  who fears the law, for he brings upon himself deprivation and  restraint, not because of the law, which would have protected him in  his freedom, but because of his rejection of law. The predominant  attribute of justice, recognized as part of Divine nature, forbids the  thought that man should receive promises of reward for righteousness,  and threats of punishment of evil deeds, if he possessed no power of  independent action. It is no more a part of God's plan to compel men  to work righteousness, than it is His purpose to permit evil powers to  force His children into sin. In the days of Eden, the first man had  placed before him commandment and law, with an explanation of the  penalty which would follow a violation of that law. No law could have  been given him in righteousness, had he not been free to act for  himself. 'Nevertheless, thou mayest choose for thyself, for it is  given unto thee; but remember that I forbid it,' said the Lord God to  Adam. Concerning His dealings with the first patriarch of the race,  God has declared in this day, 'Behold I gave unto him that he should  be an agent unto himself.'\" (The Author, \"Articles of Faith,\" Lecture  3:1, 2.)    3. _The Testimony of Prophecy to the Apostasy_. \"What is prophecy but  history reversed? Nothing. Prophecy is a record of things before they  transpire. History is a record of them after they have occurred; and  of the two prophecy is more to be trusted for its accuracy than  history: for the reason that it has for "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35534"],[0,"How to be Happy Though Married: Being a Handbook to Marriage (#7)"],[1,"Burton._      Whether a man shall be made or marred by marriage greatly depends upon  the choice he makes of a wife. Nothing is better than a good woman, nor  anything worse than a bad one. The idea of the great electrician  Edison's marrying was first suggested by an intimate friend, who made  the point that he needed a mistress to preside over his large house,  which was being managed by a housekeeper and several servants. Although  a very shy man, he seemed pleased with the proposition, and timidly  inquired whom he should marry The friend somewhat testily replied, \"Any  one;\" that a man who had so little sentiment in his soul as to ask such  a question ought to be satisfied with anything that wore a petticoat and  was decent.    Woe to the man who follows such careless advice as this, and marries  \"any one,\" for what was said by the fox to the sick lion might be said  with equal truth to Hymen: \"I notice that there are many prints of feet  entering your cave, but I see no trace of any returning.\" Before taking  the irrevocable step choose well, for your choice though brief is yet  endless. And, first, we make the obvious suggestion that it is useless  to seek perfection in a wife, even though you may fancy yourself capable  of giving an adequate return as did the author of the following  advertisement: \"Wanted by a Young Gentleman just beginning Housekeeping,  a Lady between Eighteen and Twenty-five Years of Age, with a good  Education, and a Fortune not less than Five Thousand Pounds; Sound Wind  and Limb, Five Feet Four Inches without her shoes; Not Fat, nor yet too  lean; Good Set of Teeth; No Pride nor Affectation; Not very Talkative,  nor one that is deemed a Scold; but of a Spirit to Resent an Affront; of  a Charitable Disposition; not Over-fond of Dress, though always Decent  and Clean; that will Entertain her Husband's Friends with Affability and  Cheerfulness, and Prefer his Company to Public Diversions and gadding  about; one who can keep his secrets, that he may open his Heart to her  without reserve on all Occasions; that can extend domestic Expenses with  Economy, as Prosperity advances, without Ostentation; and Retrench them  with Cheerfulness, if occasion should require. Any Lady disposed to  Matrimony, answering this Description, is desired to direct for Y. Z.,  at the Baptist's Head Coffee-house, Aldermanbury. _N.B._--The Gentleman  can make adequate Return, and is, in every Respect, deserving a Lady  with the above Qualifications.\"    This reminds us of the old lady who told her steward she wished him to  attend a neighbouring fair in order to buy her a cow. She explained to  him that it must be young, well-bred, fine in the skin, a strawberry in  colour, straight in the back, and not given to breaking through fences  when it smelt clover on the other side; above all, it was not to cost  more than ten pounds. The steward, who was a Scotchman, and a privileged  old servant, bowed his head and replied reverently, \"Then, my lady, I  think ye had better kneel down and pray for her, for ye'll get her nae  other way, I'm thinkin'.\"    While the possession of a little money is by no means a drawback, those  do not well consult their happiness who marry for money alone.      \"In many a marriage made for gold,    The bride is bought--and the bridegroom sold.\"    Though Cupid is said to be blind, he is a better guide than the rules of  arithmetic. We have false ideas of happiness. What will make me  happy--contented? \"Oh, if I were rich, I should be happy!\" A gentleman  who was enjoying the hospitalities of the great millionaire and king of  finance, Rothschild, as he looked at the superb appointments of the  mansion, said to his host, \"You must be a happy man!\" \"Happy!\" said he,  \"happy! I happy--happy!\" \"Aye, happy!\" \"Let us change the subject.\" John  Jacob Astor of America, was also told that he must be a very happy man,  being so rich. \"Why,\" said he, \"would you take care of my property for  your board and clothes? That's all I get for it.\" In taking a dowry with  a wife \"thou losest thy liberty,\" says an old writer: \"she will ride  upon thee, domineer as she list, wear the breeches in her oligarchical  government, and beggar thee besides.\"    Better to have a fortune _in_ your wife than _with_ her. \"My wife has  made my fortune,\" said a gentleman of great possessions, \"by her thrift,  prudence, and cheerfulness, when I was just beginning.\" \"And mine has  lost my fortune,\" answered his companion, bitterly, \"by useless  extravagance, and repining when I was doing well.\" The girl who brings  to her husband a large dowry may also bring habits of luxury learned in  a rich home. She may be almost as incapable of understanding straitened  circumstances as was the lady of the court of Louis XVI., who, on  hearing of people starving, exclaimed, \"Poor creatures! No bread to eat!  Then let them eat cakes!\"    Nor is it wise to marry for beauty alone: as even the finest landscape,  seen daily, becomes monotonous, so does the most beautiful face, unless  a beautiful nature shine through it. The beauty of to-day becomes  commonplace to-morrow; whereas goodness, displayed through the most  ordinary features, is perennially lovely. Moreover, this kind of beauty  improves with age, and time ripens rather than destroys it. No man is so  much to be pitied as the husband of a \"professional beauty.\" Yet beauty,  when it betokens health, or when it is the outward and visible sign of  an inward and spiritual grace, is valuable, and has a great power of  winning affection.    Above all things do not marry a fool who will shame you and reveal your  secrets. For ourselves we do not believe the first part at least of  Archbishop Whately's definition of woman: \"A creature that does not  reason, and that pokes the fire from the top.\" The wife who does not and  cannot make use of reason to overcome the daily difficulties of domestic  life, and who can in no sense be called the companion of her husband, is  a mate who hinders rather than helps. Sooner or later a household must  fall into the hands of its women, and sink or swim according to their  capacities. It is hard enough for a man to be married to a bad woman;  but for a man who marries a foolish woman there is no hope.    \"One must love their friends with all their failings, but it is a great  failing to be ill,\" and therefore unless you are one of those rare men  who would never lose patience with a wife always in pain, when choosing  you should think more of a healthy hue than of a hectic hue, and far  more of good lungs than of a tightly-laced waist \"See that she chews her  food well, and sets her foot down firmly on the ground when she walks,  and you're all right.\"    As regards the marriageable age of women we may quote the following  little conversation: \"No woman is worth looking at after thirty,\" said  young Mrs. A., a bride with all the arrogant youthfulness of twenty-one  summers. \"Quite true, my dear,\" answered Lady D., a very pretty woman  some ten or fifteen years older; \"nor worth listening to before.\"    Please yourself, good sir! only do not marry either a child or an old  woman. Certainly a man should marry to obtain a friend and companion  rather than a cook and housekeeper; but yet that girl is a prize indeed  who has so well prepared herself for the business of wifehood as to be  able to keep not only her husband company, but her house in good order.  \"If that man is to be regarded as a benefactor of his species who makes  two stalks of corn to grow where only one grew before, not less is she  to be regarded as a public benefactor who economizes and turns to the  best practical account the food products of human skill and labour.\"    Formerly a woman's library was limited to the Bible and a cookery-book.  This curriculum has now been considerably extended, and it is everywhere  acknowledged that \"chemistry enough to keep the pot boiling, and  geography enough to know the different rooms in her house,\" is _not_  science enough for women. It is surely not impossible, however, for an  intending husband to find a girl who can make her higher education  compatible with his comforts, who can when necessary bring her  philosophy down to the kitchen. Why should literature unfit women for  the everyday business of life? It is not so with men. You see those of  the most cultivated minds constantly devoting their time and attention  to the most homely objects.    The other day, speaking superficially and uncharitably, a person said of  a woman, whom he knew but slightly, \"She disappoints me utterly. How  could her husband have married her? She is commonplace and stupid.\"  \"Yes,\" said a friend, reflectively, \"it is strange. She is not a  brilliant woman, she is not even an intellectual one; but there is such  a thing as a genius for affection, and she has it. It has been good for  her husband that he married her.\" In the sphere of home the graces of  gentleness, of patience, of generosity, are far more valuable than any  personal attractions or mental gifts and accomplishments. They  contribute more to happiness and are the source of sympathy and  spiritual discernment. For does not the woman who can love see more and  understand more than the most intellectual woman who has no heart?    A vacancy in the floor sweeping department of a public institution  having been advertised, the testimonials to the intellectual and moral  eminence of an old woman were overwhelming; but after the election it  appeared she had only one arm! Not less unfitted to be a wife is the  woman who, with every other qualification, has no genius for affection.    Dress is one of the little things that indicate character. A refined  woman will always look neat; but, on the other hand, she will not  bedizen and bedeck herself with a view to display. Again, there is no  condition of life in which industry in a wife is not necessary to the  happiness of a family. A lazy mistress"]]]
