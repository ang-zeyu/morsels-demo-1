This they would themselves acknowledge. 'Come on and fight! Come on!'  cried a member of the Volksraad when the franchise petition of the  Uitlanders was presented. 'Protest! Protest! What is the good of  protesting?' said Kruger to Mr. W. Y. Campbell; 'you have not got the  guns, I have.' There was always the final court of appeal. Judge Creusot  and Judge Mauser were always behind the President.    Again, the argument of the Boers would be more valid had they received  no benefit from these immigrants. If they had ignored them they might  fairly have stated that they did not desire their presence. But even  while they protested they grew rich at the Uitlander's expense. They  could not have it both ways. It would be consistent to discourage him  and not profit by him, or to make him comfortable and build the State  upon his money; but to ill-treat him and at the same time to grow strong  by his taxation must surely be an injustice.    And again, the whole argument is based upon the narrow racial  supposition that every naturalised citizen not of Boer extraction must  necessarily be unpatriotic. This is not borne out by the examples  of history. The newcomer soon becomes as proud of his country and  as jealous of her liberty as the old. Had President Kruger given the  franchise generously to the Uitlander, his pyramid would have been  firm upon its base and not balanced upon its apex. It is true that the  corrupt oligarchy would have vanished, and the spirit of a broader more  tolerant freedom influenced the counsels of the State. But the republic  would have become stronger and more permanent, with a population who,  if they differed in details, were united in essentials. Whether such a  solution would have been to the advantage of British interests in South  Africa is quite another question. In more ways than one President Kruger  has been a good friend to the empire.    So much upon the general question of the reason why the Uitlander should  agitate and why the Boer was obdurate. The details of the long struggle  between the seekers for the franchise and the refusers of it may be  quickly sketched, but they cannot be entirely ignored by any one who  desires to understand the inception of that great contest which was the  outcome of the dispute.    At the time of the Convention of Pretoria (1881) the rights of  burghership might be obtained by one year's residence. In 1882 it was  raised to five years, the reasonable limit which obtains both in Great  Britain and in the United States. Had it remained so, it is safe to say  that there would never have been either an Uitlander question or a great  Boer war. Grievances would have been righted from the inside without  external interference.    In 1890 the inrush of outsiders alarmed the Boers, and the franchise was  raised so as to be only attainable by those who had lived fourteen years  in the country. The Uitlanders, who were increasing rapidly in numbers  and were suffering from the formidable list of grievances already  enumerated, perceived that their wrongs were so numerous that it was  hopeless to have them set right seriatim, and that only by obtaining the  leverage of the franchise could they hope to move the heavy burden which  weighed them down. In 1893 a petition of 13,000 Uitlanders, couched  in most respectful terms, was submitted to the Raad, but met with  contemptuous neglect. Undeterred, however, by this failure, the National  Reform Union, an association which organised the agitation, came back to  the attack in 1894. They drew up a petition which was signed by 35,000  adult male Uitlanders, a greater number than the total Boer male  population of the country. A small liberal body in the Raad supported  this memorial and endeavoured in vain to obtain some justice for the  newcomers. Mr. Jeppe was the mouthpiece of this select band. 'They own  half the soil, they pay at least three quarters of the taxes,' said he.  'They are men who in capital, energy, and education are at least our  equals.    What will become of us or our children on that day when we may find  ourselves in a minority of one in twenty without a single friend among  the other nineteen, among those who will then tell us that they wished  to be brothers, but that we by our own act have made them strangers to  the republic?' Such reasonable and liberal sentiments were combated by  members who asserted that the signatures could not belong to law-abiding  citizens, since they were actually agitating against the law of the  franchise, and others whose intolerance was expressed by the defiance of  the member already quoted, who challenged the Uitlanders to come out and  fight. The champions of exclusiveness and racial hatred won the day. The  memorial was rejected by sixteen votes to eight, and the franchise law  was, on the initiative of the President, actually made more stringent  than ever, being framed in such a way that during the fourteen years of  probation the applicant should give up his previous nationality, so that  for that period he would really belong to no country at all. No hopes  were held out that any possible attitude upon the part of the Uitlanders  would soften the determination of the President and his burghers. One  who remonstrated was led outside the State buildings by the President,  who pointed up at the national flag. 'You see that flag?' said he. 'If I  grant the franchise, I may as well pull it down.' His animosity against  the immigrants was bitter. 'Burghers, friends, thieves, murderers,  newcomers, and others,' is the conciliatory opening of one of his public  addresses. Though Johannesburg is only thirty-two miles from Pretoria,  and though the State of which he was the head depended for its revenue  upon the gold fields, he paid it only three visits in nine years.    This settled animosity was deplorable, but not unnatural. A man imbued  with the idea of a chosen people, and unread in any book save the one  which cultivates this very idea, could not be expected to have learned  the historical lessons of the advantages which a State reaps from a  liberal policy. To him it was as if the Ammonites and Moabites had  demanded admission into the twelve tribes. He mistook an agitation  against the exclusive policy of the State for one against the existence  of the State itself. A wide franchise would have made his republic  firm-based and permanent. It was a small minority of the Uitlanders who  had any desire to come into the British system. They were a cosmopolitan  crowd, only united by the bond of a common injustice. But when every  other method had failed, and their petition for the rights of freemen  had been flung back at them, it was natural that their eyes should  turn to that flag which waved to the north, the west, and the south of  them--the flag which means purity of government with equal rights and  equal duties for all men. Constitutional agitation was laid aside, arms  were smuggled in, and everything prepared for an organised rising.    The events which followed at the beginning of 1896 have been so thrashed  out that there is, perhaps, nothing left to tell--except the truth. So  far as the Uitlanders themselves are concerned, their action was most  natural and justifiable, and they have no reason to exculpate themselves  for rising against such oppression as no men of our race have ever been  submitted to. Had they trusted only to themselves and the justice of  their cause, their moral and even their material position would have  been infinitely stronger. But unfortunately there were forces behind  them which were more questionable, the nature and extent of which have  never yet, in spite of two commissions of investigation, been properly  revealed. That there should have been any attempt at misleading inquiry,  or suppressing documents in order to shelter individuals, is deplorable,  for the impression left--I believe an entirely false one--must be that  the British Government connived at an expedition which was as immoral as  it was disastrous.    It had been arranged that the town was to rise upon a certain night,  that Pretoria should be attacked, the fort seized, and the rifles and  ammunition used to arm the Uitlanders. It was a feasible device, though  it must seem to us, who have had such an experience of the military  virtues of the burghers, a very desperate one. But it is conceivable  that the rebels might have held Johannesburg until the universal  sympathy which their cause excited throughout South Africa would have  caused Great Britain to intervene. Unfortunately they had complicated  matters by asking for outside help. Mr. Cecil Rhodes was Premier of the  Cape, a man of immense energy, and one who had rendered great services  to the empire. The motives of his action are obscure--certainly, we  may say that they were not sordid, for he has always been a man whose  thoughts were large and whose habits were simple. But whatever they may  have been--whether an ill-regulated desire to consolidate South Africa  under British rule, or a burning sympathy with the Uitlanders in their  fight against injustice--it is certain that he allowed his lieutenant,  Dr. Jameson, to assemble the mounted police of the Chartered Company, of  which Rhodes was founder and director, for the purpose of co-operating  with the rebels at Johannesburg. Moreover, when the revolt at  Johannesburg was postponed, on account of a disagreement as to which  flag they were to rise under, it appears that Jameson (with or without  the orders of Rhodes) forced the hand of the conspirators by invading  the country with a force absurdly inadequate to the work which he had  taken in hand. Five hundred policemen and three field guns made up the  forlorn hope who started from near Mafeking and crossed the Transvaal  border upon December 29th, 1895.

A long hand moved its sinuous fingers to motion them to follow, and  McGuire regarded his companion with a hopeless look and a despondent  shrug of his shoulders.    \"No use putting up a fight,\" he said; \"I guess we'd better be good.\"    He followed where the figure was stepping through a doorway into a  corridor beyond. They moved, silent and depressed, along the dimly  lighted way; the touch of cold metal walls was as chilling to their  spirits as to their flesh.    But the mood could not last: the first ray of light from the outside  world sent shivers of anticipation along their spines. They were  landing, in very fact, upon a new world; their feet were to walk where  never man had stood; their eyes would see what mortal eyes had never  visioned.    Fears were forgotten, and the men clung to each other not for the human  touch but because of an ecstasy of intoxicating, soul-filling joy in the  sheer thrill of adventure.    They were gripping each other's hand, round-eyed as a couple of  children, as they stepped forward into the light.           *       *       *       *       *    Before them was a scene whose blazing beauty of color struck them to  frozen silence; their exclamations of wonder died unspoken on their  lips. They were in a city of the stars, and to their eyes it seemed as  if all the brilliance of the heavens had been gathered for its  building.    The spacious, open court itself stood high in the air among the masses  of masonry, and beyond were countless structures. Some towered skyward;  others were lower; and all were topped with bulbous towers and graceful  minarets that made a forest of gleaming opal light. Opalescence  everywhere!--it flashed in red and gold and delicate blues from every  wall and cornice and roof.    \"Quartz?\" marveled Sykes after one long drawn breath. \"Quartz or  glass?--what are they made of? It is fairyland!\"    A jewelled city! Garish, it might have been, and tawdry, in the full  light of the sun. But on these weirdly unreal structures the sun's rays  never shone; they were illumined only by the soft golden glow that  diffused across this world from the cloud masses far above.    McGuire looked up at that uniform, glowing, golden mass that paled  toward the horizon and faded to the gray of banked clouds. His eyes came  slowly back to the ramp that led downward to the checkered black and  white of the court. Beyond an open portion the pavement was solidly  massed with people.    \"People!--we might as well call them that,\" McGuire had told Sykes;  \"they are people of a sort, I suppose. We'll have to give them credit  for brains: they've beaten us a hundred years in their inventions.\"    He was trying to see everything, understand everything, at once. There  was not time to single out the new impressions that were crowding upon  him. The air--it was warm to the point of discomfort; it explained the  loose, light garments of the people; it came to the two men laden with  strange scents and stranger sounds.    McGuire's eyes held with hungry curiosity upon the dwellers in this  other world; he stared at the gaping throng from which came a bedlam of  shrill cries. Lean colorless hands gesticulated wildly and pointed with  long fingers at the two men.           *       *       *       *       *    The din ceased abruptly at a sharp, whistled order from their captor. He  stood aside with a guard that had followed from the ship, and he  motioned the two before him down the gangway. It was the same scarlet  one who had faced them before, the one whom McGuire had attacked in a  frenzy of furious fighting, only to go down to blackness and defeat  before the slim cylinder of steel and its hissing gas. And the slanting  eyes stared wickedly in cold triumph as he ordered them to go before  him in his march of victory.    McGuire passed down toward the masses of color that were the ones who  waited. There were many in the dull red of the ship's crew; others in  sky-blue, in gold and pink and combinations of brilliance that blended  their loose garments to kaleidoscopic hues. But the figures were similar  in one unvarying respect: they were repulsive and ghastly, and their  faces showed bright blotches of blood vessels and blue markings of veins  through their parchment-gray skins.    The crowd parted to a narrow, living lane, and lean fingers clutched  writhingly to touch them as they passed between the solid ranks.    McGuire had only a vague impression of a great building beyond, of lower  stories decorated in barbaric colors, of towers above in strange forms  of the crystal, colorful beauty they had seen. He walked toward it  unseeing; his thoughts were only of the creatures round about.    \"What damned beasts!\" he said. Then, like his companion, he set his  teeth to restrain all show of feeling as they made their way through the  lane of incredible living things.           *       *       *       *       *    They followed their captor through a doorway into an empty room--empty  save for one blue-clad individual who stood beside an instrument board  let into the wall. Beyond was a long wall, where circular openings  yawned huge and black.    The one at the instrument panel received a curt order: the weird voice  of the man in red repeated a word that stood out above his curious,  wordless tone. \"Torg,\" he said, and again McGuire heard him repeat the  syllable.    The operator touched here and there among his instruments, and tiny  lights flashed; he threw a switch, and from one of the black openings  like a deep cave came a rushing roar of sound. It dropped to silence as  the end of a cylindrical car protruded into the room. A door in the  metal car opened, and their guard hustled them roughly inside. The one  in red followed while behind him the door clanged shut.    Inside the car was light, a diffused radiance from no apparent source,  the whole air was glowing about them. And beneath their feet the car  moved slowly but with a constant acceleration that built up to  tremendous speed. Then that slackened, and Sykes and McGuire clung to  each other for support while the car that had been shot like a  projectile came to rest.    \"Whew!\" breathed the lieutenant; \"that was quick delivery.\" Sykes made  no reply, and McGuire, too, fell silent to study the tremendous room  into which they were led. Here, seemingly, was the stage for their next  experience.    A vast open hall with a floor of glass that was like obsidion, empty but  for carved benches about the walls; there was room here for a mighty  concourse of people. The walls, like those they had seen, were decorated  crudely in glaring colors, and embellished with grotesque designs that  proclaimed loudly the inexpert touch of the draughtsman. Yet, above  them, the ceiling sprang lightly into vaulted, sweeping curves.  McGuire's training had held little of architecture, yet even he felt the  beauty of line and airy gracefulness of treatment in the structure  itself.           *       *       *       *       *    The contrast between the flaunting colors and the finished artistry that  lay beneath must have struck a discordant note to the scientist. He  leaned closer to whisper.    \"It is all wrong some way--the whole world! Beauty and refinement--then  crude vulgarity, as incongruous as the people themselves--they do not  belong here.\"    \"Neither do we,\" was McGuire's reply; \"it looks like a tough spot that  we're in.\"    He was watching toward a high, arched entrance across the room. A  platform before it was raised some six feet above the floor, and on  this were seats--ornate chairs, done in sweeping scrolls of scarlet and  gold. A massive seat in the center was like the fantastic throne of a  child's fairy tale. From the corridor beyond that entrance came a stir  and rustling that rivetted the man's attention.    A trumpet peal, vibrant and peculiar, blared forth from the ceiling  overhead, and the red figures of the guards stood at rigid attention  with lean arms held stiffly before them. The one in scarlet took the  same attitude, then dropped his hands to motion the two men to give the  same salute.    \"You go to hell,\" said Lieutenant McGuire in his gentlest tones. And the  scarlet figure's thin lips were snarling as he turned to whip his arms  up to their position. The first of a procession of figures was entering  through the arch.    Sykes, the scientist, was paying little attention. \"It isn't true,\" he  was muttering aloud; \"it can't be true. Venus! Twenty-six million miles  at inferior conjunction!\"    He seemed lost in silent communion with his own thoughts; then: \"But  I said there was every probability of life; I pointed out the  similarities--\"    \"Hush!\" warned McGuire. The eyes of the scarlet man were sending wicked  looks in their direction. Tall forms were advancing through the arch.  They, too, were robed in scarlet, and behind them others followed.           *       *       *       *       *    The trumpet peal from the dome above held now on a long-drawn, single  note, while the scarlet men strode in silence across the dais and parted  to form two lines. An inverted \"V\" that faced the entrance--they were an  assembly of rigid, blazing statues whose arms were extended like those  on the floor below.    The vibrant tone from on high changed to a crashing blare that shrieked  discordantly to send quivering protest through every nerve of the  waiting men. Those about them were shouting, and again the name of Torg  was heard, as, in the high arch, another character appeared to play his  part in a strange drama.    Thin like his companions, yet even taller than them, he wore the same  brilliant robes and, an additional mark of distinction, a head-dress of  polished gold. He acknowledged the salute with a quick raising of his  own arms, then came swiftly forward and took his place upon the massive  throne.    Not till he was seated did the others on the platform relax their rigid  pose"]]]
