What's going  on?\"    They stared at each other.    \"What's happening?\" Dolores said. \"I received a vidcall that you had  been hurt in a lunar explosion--\"    The wall speaker rasped into life. \"You see, Philip, that problem is  already solved. We don't really need so many people; even a single  couple might do.\"    Kramer nodded slowly. \"I see,\" he murmured thickly. \"Just one couple.  One man and woman.\"    \"They might make it all right, if there were someone to watch and see  that things went as they should. There will be quite a few things I  can help you with, Philip. Quite a few. We'll get along very well, I  think.\"    Kramer grinned wryly. \"You could even help us name the animals,\" he  said. \"I understand that's the first step.\"    \"I'll be glad to,\" the toneless, impersonal voice said. \"As I recall,  my part will be to bring them to you, one by one. Then you can do the  actual naming.\"    \"I don't understand,\" Dolores faltered. \"What does he mean, Phil?  Naming animals. What kind of animals? Where are we going?\"    Kramer walked slowly over to the port and stood staring silently out,  his arms folded. Beyond the ship a myriad fragments of light gleamed,  countless coals glowing in the dark void. Stars, suns, systems.  Endless, without number. A universe of worlds. An infinity of planets,  waiting for them, gleaming and winking from the darkness.    He turned back, away from the port. \"Where are we going?\" He smiled at  his wife, standing nervous and frightened, her large eyes full of  alarm. \"I don't know where we are going,\" he said. \"But somehow that  doesn't seem too important right now.... I'm beginning to see the  Professor's point, it's the result that counts.\"    And for the first time in many months he put his arm around Dolores.  At first she stiffened, the fright and nervousness still in her eyes.  But then suddenly she relaxed against him and there were tears wetting  her cheeks.    \"Phil ... do you really think we can start over again--you and I?\"    He kissed her tenderly, then passionately.

(#7)"],[1,", I thought, that the clan had not been equipped  throughout its membership with ultrophones, but Wilma explained to me,  that not enough of these had been built for distribution as yet,  although general distribution had been contemplated within a couple of  months.    We traveled far before nightfall overtook us, trying only to put as much  distance as possible between ourselves and the valley.    When gathering dusk made jumping too dangerous, we sought a comfortable  spot beneath the trees, and consumed part of our emergency rations. It  was the first time I had tasted the stuff--a highly nutritive synthetic  substance called \"concentro,\" which was, however, a bit bitter and  unpalatable. But as only a mouthful or so was needed, it did not matter.    Neither of us had a cloak, but we were both thoroughly tired and happy,  so we curled up together for warmth. I remember Wilma making some sleepy  remark about our mating, as she cuddled up, as though the matter were  all settled, and my surprise at my own instant acceptance of the idea,  for I had not consciously thought of her that way before. But we both  fell asleep at once.    In the morning we found little time for love making. The practical  problem facing us was too great. Wilma felt that the Wyoming plan must  be to rally in the Susquanna territory, but she had her doubts about the  wisdom of this plan. In my elation at my success in bringing down the  Han ship, and my newly found interest in my charming companion, who was,  from my viewpoint of another century, at once more highly civilized and  yet more primitive than myself, I had forgotten the ominous fact that  the Han ship I had destroyed must have known the exact location of the  Wyoming Works.    This meant, to Wilma's logical mind, either that the Hans had perfected  new instruments as yet unknown to us, or that somewhere, among the  Wyomings or some other nearby gang, there were traitors so degraded as  to commit that unthinkable act of trafficking in information with the  Hans. In either contingency, she argued, other Han raids would follow,  and since the Susquannas had a highly developed organization and more  than usually productive plants, the next raid might be expected to  strike them.    But at any rate it was clearly our business to get in touch with the  other fugitives as quickly as possible, so in spite of muscles that were  sore from the excessive leaping of the day before, we continued on our  way.    We traveled for only a couple of hours when we saw a multi-colored  rocket in the sky, some ten miles ahead of us.    \"Bear to the left, Tony,\" Wilma said, \"and listen for the whistle.\"    \"Why?\" I asked.    \"Haven't they given you the rocket code yet?\" she replied. \"That's what  the green, followed by yellow and purple means; to concentrate five  miles east of the rocket position. You know the rocket position itself  might draw a play of disintegrator beams.\"    It did not take us long to reach the neighborhood of the indicated  rallying, though we were now traveling beneath the trees, with but an  occasional leap to a top branch to see if any more rocket smoke was  floating above. And soon we heard a distant whistle.    We found about half the Gang already there, in a spot where the trees  met high above a little stream. The Big Boss and Raid Bosses were busy  reorganizing the remnants.    We reported to Boss Hart at once. He was silent, but interested, when he  heard our story.    \"You two stick close to me,\" he said, adding grimly, \"I'm going back to  the valley at once with a hundred picked men, and I'll need you.\"          CHAPTER V    Setting the Trap      Inside of fifteen minutes we were on our way. A certain amount of  caution was sacrificed for the sake of speed, and the men leaped away  either across the forest top, or over open spaces of ground, but  concentration was forbidden. The Big Boss named the spot on the hillside  as the rallying point.    \"We'll have to take a chance on being seen, so long as we don't group,\"  he declared, \"at least until within five miles of the rallying spot.  From then on I want every man to disappear from sight and to travel  under cover. And keep your ultrophones open, and tuned on  ten-four-seven-six.\"    Wilma and I had received our battle equipment from the Gear boss. It  consisted of a long-gun, a hand-gun, with a special case of ammunition  constructed of inertron, which made the load weigh but a few ounces, and  a short sword. This gear we strapped over each other's shoulders, on top  of our jumping belts. In addition, we each received an ultrophone, and a  light inertron blanket rolled into a cylinder about six inches long by  two or three in diameter. This fabric was exceedingly thin and light,  but it had considerable warmth, because of the mixture of inertron in  its composition.    [Illustration: The Han raider neared with incredible speed. Its rays  were both slanted astern at a sharp angle, so that it slid forward with  tremendous momentum.... Whenever the disintegrator rays flashed downward  with blinding brilliancy, forest, rocks and ground melted  instantaneously into nothing, where they played upon them.]    \"This looks like business,\" Wilma remarked to me with sparkling eyes.  (And I might mention a curious thing here. The word \"business\" had  survived from the 20th Century American vocabulary, but not with any  meaning of \"industry\" or \"trade,\" for such things being purely community  activities were spoken of as \"work\" and \"clearing.\" Business simply  meant fighting, and that was all.)    \"Did you bring all this equipment from the valley?\" I asked the Gear  Boss.    \"No,\" he said. \"There was no time to gather anything. All this stuff we  cleared from the Susquannas a few hours ago. I was with the Boss on the  way down, and he had me jump on ahead and arrange it. But you two had  better be moving. He's beckoning you now.\"    Hart was about to call us on our phones when we looked up. As soon as we  did so, he leaped away, waving us to follow closely.    He was a powerful man, and he darted ahead in long, swift, low leaps up  the banks of the stream, which followed a fairly straight course at this  point. By extending ourselves, however, Wilma and I were able to catch  up to him.    As we gradually synchronized our leaps with his, he outlined to us,  between the grunts that accompanied each leap, his plan of action.    \"We have to start the big business--unh--sooner or later,\" he said.  \"And if--unh--the Hans have found any way of locating our  positions--unh--it's time to start now, although the Council of  Bosses--unh--had intended waiting a few years until enough rocket ships  have been--unh--built. But no matter what the sacrifice--unh--we can't  afford to let them get us on the run--unh--. We'll set a trap for the  yellow devils in the--unh--valley if they come back for their  wreckage--unh--and if they don't, we'll go rocketing for some of their  liners--unh--on the Nu-yok, Clee-lan, Si-ka-ga course. We can  use--unh--that idea of yours of shooting up the repellor--unh--beams.  Want you to give us a demonstration.\"    With further admonition to follow him closely, he increased his pace,  and Wilma and I were taxed to our utmost to keep up with him. It was  only in ascending the slopes that my tougher muscles overbalanced his  greater skill, and I was able to set the pace for him, as I had for  Wilma.    We slept in greater comfort that night, under our inertron blankets, and  were off with the dawn, leaping cautiously to the top of the ridge  overlooking the valley which Wilma and I had left.    The Boss scanned the sky with his ultroscope, patiently taking some  fifteen minutes to the task, and then swung his phone into use, calling  the roll and giving the men their instructions.    His first order was for us all to slip our ear and chest discs into  permanent position.    These ultrophones were quite different from the one used by Wilma's  companion scout the day I saved her from the vicious attack of the  bandit Gang. That one was contained entirely in a small pocket case.  These, with which we were now equipped, consisted of a pair of ear  discs, each a separate and self-contained receiving set. They slipped  into little pockets over our ears in the fabric helmets we wore, and  shut out virtually all extraneous sounds. The chest discs were likewise  self-contained sending sets, strapped to the chest a few inches below  the neck and actuated by the vibrations from the vocal cords through the  body tissues. The total range of these sets was about eighteen miles.  Reception was remarkably clear, quite free from the static that so  marked the 20th Century radios, and of a strength in direct proportion  to the distance of the speaker.    The Boss' set was triple powered, so that his orders would cut in on any  local conversations, which were indulged in, however, with great  restraint, and only for the purpose of maintaining contacts.    I marveled at the efficiency of this modern method of battle  communication in contrast to the clumsy signaling devices of more  ancient times; and also at other military contrasts in which the 20th  and 25th Century methods were the reverse of each other in efficiency.  These modern Americans, for instance, knew little of hand to hand  fighting, and nothing, naturally, of trench warfare. Of barrages they  were quite ignorant, although they possessed weapons of terrific power.  And until my recent flash of inspiration, no one among them, apparently,  had ever thought of the scheme of shooting a rocket into a repellor beam  and letting the beam itself hurl it upward into the most vital part of  the Han ship.    Hart patiently placed his men, first giving his instructions to the  campmasters, and then remaining silent, while they placed the  individuals.    In the end, the hundred men were ringed about the valley, on the  hillsides and tops, each in a position from which he had a"]]]
