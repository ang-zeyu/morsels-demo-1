Marijuana is the dried leaf of the cannabis or hemp plant  (Cannabis sativa).       Methaqualone is a pharmaceutical depressant, referred to as  mandrax in Southwest Asia and Africa.       Narcotics are drugs that relieve pain, often induce sleep, and  refer to opium, opium derivatives, and synthetic substitutes. Natural  narcotics include opium (paregoric, parepectolin), morphine (MS-Contin,  Roxanol), codeine (Tylenol with codeine, Empirin with codeine,  Robitussan AC), and thebaine.

Imports - partners  This entry provides a rank ordering of trading partners starting with  the most important; it sometimes includes the percent of total dollar  value.    Independence  For most countries, this entry gives the date that sovereignty was  achieved and from which nation, empire, or trusteeship. For the other  countries, the date given may not represent \"independence\" in the  strict sense, but rather some significant nationhood event such as the  traditional founding date or the date of unification, federation,  confederation, establishment, fundamental change in the form of  government, or state succession. Dependent areas include the notation  \"none\" followed by the nature of their dependency status. Also see the  Terminology note.    Industrial production growth rate  This entry gives the annual percentage increase in industrial  production (includes manufacturing, mining, and construction).    Industries  This entry provides a rank ordering of industries starting with the  largest by value of annual output.    Infant mortality rate  This entry gives the number of deaths of infants under one year old in  a given year per 1,000 live births in the same year; included is the  total death rate, and deaths by sex, male and female. This rate is  often used as an indicator of the level of health in a country.    Inflation rate (consumer prices)  This entry furnishes the annual percent change in consumer prices  compared with the previous year's consumer prices.    Internet country code  This entry includes the two-letter codes maintained by the  International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in the ISO 3166  Alpha-2 list and used by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA)  to establish country-coded top-level domains (ccTLDs).    Internet hosts  This entry lists the number of Internet hosts available within a  country. An Internet host is a computer connected directly to the  Internet; normally an Internet Service Provider's (ISP) computer is a  host. Internet users may use either a hard-wired terminal, at an  institution with a mainframe computer connected directly to the  Internet, or may connect remotely by way of a modem via telephone line,  cable, or satellite to the Internet Service Provider's host computer.  The number of hosts is one indicator of the extent of Internet  connectivity.    Internet users  This entry gives the number of users within a country that access the  Internet.  Statistics vary from country to country and may include  users who access the Internet at least several times a week to those  who access it only once within a period of several months.    International disputes  see Disputes - international    International organization participation  This entry lists in alphabetical order by abbreviation those  international organizations in which the subject country is a member or  participates in some other way.    International organizations  This information is presented in Appendix B: International  Organizations and Groups which includes the name, abbreviation, date  established, aim, and members by category.    Introduction  This category includes one entry, Background.    Investment (gross fixed)  This entry records total business spending on fixed assets, such as  factories, machinery, equipment, dwellings, and inventories of raw  materials, which provide the basis for future production. It is  measured gross of depreciation of the assets, i.e., it includes  investment that merely replaces worn-out or scrapped capital.    Irrigated land  This entry gives the number of square kilometers of land area that is  artificially supplied with water.    Judicial branch  This entry contains the name(s) of the highest court(s) and a brief  description of the selection process for members.    Labor force  This entry contains the total labor force figure.    Labor force - by occupation  This entry contains a rank ordering of component parts of the labor  force by occupation.    Land boundaries  This entry contains the total length of all land boundaries and the  individual lengths for each of the contiguous border countries.    Land use  This entry contains the percentage shares of total land area for three  different types of land use: arable land - land cultivated for crops  like wheat, maize, and rice that are replanted after each harvest;  permanent crops - land cultivated for crops like citrus, coffee, and  rubber that are not replanted after each harvest; includes land under  flowering shrubs, fruit trees, nut trees, and vines, but excludes land  under trees grown for wood or timber; other - any land not arable or  under permanent crops; includes permanent meadows and pastures, forests  and woodlands, built-on areas, roads, barren land, etc.    Languages  This entry provides a rank ordering of languages starting with the  largest and sometimes includes the percent of total population speaking  that language.    Legal system  This entry contains a brief description of the legal system's  historical roots, role in government, and acceptance of International  Court of Justice (ICJ) jurisdiction.

Life expectancy at birth  This entry contains the average number of years to be lived by a group  of people born in the same year, if mortality at each age remains  constant in the future. The entry includes total population as well as  the male and female components. Life expectancy at birth is also a  measure of overall quality of life in a country and summarizes the  mortality at all ages. It can also be thought of as indicating the  potential return on investment in human capital and is necessary for  the calculation of various actuarial measures.    Literacy  This entry includes a definition of literacy and Census Bureau  percentages for the total population, males, and females. There are no  universal definitions and standards of literacy. Unless otherwise  specified, all rates are based on the most common definition - the  ability to read and write at a specified age. Detailing the standards  that individual countries use to assess the ability to read and write  is beyond the scope of the Factbook. Information on literacy, while not  a perfect measure of educational results, is probably the most easily  available and valid for international comparisons. Low levels of  literacy, and education in general, can impede the economic development  of a country in the current rapidly changing, technology-driven world.    Location  This entry identifies the country's regional location, neighboring  countries, and adjacent bodies of water.    Map references  This entry includes the name of the Factbook reference map on which a  country may be found. The entry on Geographic coordinates may be  helpful in finding some smaller countries.    Maritime claims  This entry includes the following claims, the definitions of which are  excerpted from the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea  (UNCLOS), which alone contains the full and definitive descriptions:            territorial sea - the sovereignty of a coastal state extends  beyond its land territory and internal waters to an adjacent belt of  sea, described as the territorial sea in the UNCLOS (Part II); this  sovereignty extends to the air space over the territorial sea as well  as its underlying seabed and subsoil; every state has the right to  establish the breadth of its territorial sea up to a limit not  exceeding 12 nautical miles; the normal baseline for measuring the  breadth of the territorial sea is the low-wa"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2756"],[0,"Marquise Brinvillier (#7)"],[1,"hopes. The marquise found Desgrais at the appointed spot: he  gave her his arm then holding her hand in his own, he gave a sign, the  archers appeared, the lover threw off his mask, Desgrais was confessed,  and the marquise was his prisoner. Desgrais left her in the hands of his  men, and hastily made his way to the convent. Then, and not before, he  produced his order from the Sixty, by means of which he opened the  marquise's room. Under her bed he found a box, which he seized and  sealed; then he went back to her, and gave the order to start.    When the marquise saw the box in the hands of Desgrais, she at first  appeared stunned; quickly recovering, she claimed a paper inside it  which contained her confession. Desgrais refused, and as he turned round  for the carriage to come forward, she tried to choke herself by  swallowing a pin. One of the archers, called Claude, Rolla, perceiving  her intention, contrived to get the pin out of her mouth. After this,  Desgrais commanded that she should be doubly watched.    They stopped for supper. An archer called Antoine Barbier was present at  the meal, and watched so that no knife or fork should be put on the  table, or any instrument with which she could wound or kill herself. The  marquise, as she put her glass to her mouth as though to drink, broke a  little bit off with her teeth; but the archer saw it in time, and forced  her to put it out on her plate. Then she promised him, if he would save  her, that she would make his fortune. He asked what he would have to do  for that. She proposed that he should cut Desgrais' throat; but he  refused, saying that he was at her service in any other way. So she  asked him for pen and paper, and wrote this letter:    \"DEAR THERIA,--I am in the hands of Desgrais, who is taking me by road  from Liege to Paris. Come quickly and save me.\"    Antoine Barbier took the letter, promising to deliver it at the right  address; but he gave it to Desgrais instead. The next day, finding that  this letter had not been pressing enough, she wrote him another, saying  that the escort was only eight men, who could be easily overcome by four  or five determined assailants, and she counted on him to strike this  bald stroke. But, uneasy when she got no answer and no result from her  letters, she despatched a third missive to Theria. In this she implored  him by his own salvation, if he were not strong enough to attack her  escort and save her, at least to kill two of the four horses by which  she was conveyed, and to profit by the moment of confusion to seize the  chest and throw it into the fire; otherwise, she declared, she was lost.  Though Theria received none of these letters, which were one by one  handed over by Barbier to Desgrais, he all the same did go to  Maestricht, where the marquise was to pass, of his own accord. There he  tried to bribe the archers, offering much as 10,000 livres, but they  were incorruptible. At Rocroy the cortege met M. Palluau, the  councillor, whom the Parliament had sent after the prisoner, that he  might put questions to her at a time when she least expected them, and  so would not have prepared her answers. Desgrais told him all that had  passed, and specially called his attention to the famous box, the object  of so much anxiety and so many eager instructions. M. de Palluau opened  it, and found among other things a paper headed \"My Confession.\" This  confession was a proof that the guilty feel great need of discovering  their crimes either to mankind or to a merciful God. Sainte-Croix, we  know, had made a confession that was burnt, and here was the marquise  equally imprudent. The confession contained seven articles, and began  thus, \"I confess to God, and to you, my father,\" and was a complete  avowal, of all the crimes she had committed.    In the first article she accused herself of incendiarism;    In the second, of having ceased to be a virgin at seven years of age;    In the third of having poisoned her father;    In the fourth, of having poisoned her two brothers;    In the fifth, that she had tried to poison her sister, a Carmelite nun.    The two other articles were concerned with the description of strange  and unnatural sins. In this woman there was something of Locusta and  something of Messalina as well: antiquity could go no further.      M. de Palluau, fortified by his knowledge of this important document,       began his examination forthwith. We give it verbatim, rejoicing       that we may substitute an official report for our own narrative.    Asked why she fled to Liege, she replied that she left France on account  of some business with her sister-in-law.    Asked if she had any knowledge of the papers found in the box, she  replied that in the box there were several family papers, and among them  a general confession which she desired to make; when she wrote it,  however, her mind was disordered; she knew not what she had said or  done, being distraught at the time, in a foreign country, deserted by  her relatives, forced to borrow every penny.    Asked as to the first article, what house it was she had burnt, she  replied that she had not burnt anything, but when she wrote that she was  out of her senses.    Asked about the six other articles she replied that she had no  recollection of them.    Asked if she had not poisoned her father and brothers, she replied that  she knew nothing at all about it.    Asked if it were not Lachaussee who poisoned her brothers, she replied  that she knew nothing about it.    Asked if she did not know that her sister could not live long, having  been poisoned, she said that she expected her sister to die, because she  suffered in the same way as her brothers; that she had lost all memory  of the time when she wrote this confession; admitted that she left  France by the advice of her relations.    Asked why her relations had advised her thus, she replied that it was in  connection with her brothers' affairs; admitted seeing Sainte-Croix  since his release from the Bastille.    Asked if Sainte-Croix had not persuaded her to get rid of her father,  she replied that she could not remember; neither did she remember if  Sainte-Croix had given her powders or other drugs, nor if Sainte-Croix  had told her he knew how to make her rich.    Eight letters having been produced, asked to whom she had written them,  she replied that she did not remember.    Asked why she had promised to pay 30,000 livres to Sainte-Croix, she  replied that she intended to entrust this sum to his care, so that she  might make use of it when she wanted it, believing him to be her friend;  she had not wished this to be known, by reason of her creditors; that  she had an acknowledgment from Sainte-Croix, but had lost it in her  travels; that her husband knew nothing about it.    Asked if the promise was made before or after the death of her brothers,  she replied that she could not remember, and it made no difference.    Asked if she knew an apothecary called Glazer, she replied that she had  consulted him three times about inflammation.    Asked why she wrote to Theria to get hold of the box, she replied that  she did not understand.    Asked why, in writing to Theria, she had said she was lost unless he got  hold of the box, she replied that she could not remember.    Asked if she had seen during the journey with her father the first  symptoms of his malady, she replied that she had not noticed that her  father was ill on the journey, either going or coming back in 1666.    Asked if she had not done business with Penautier, she replied that  Penautier owed her 30,000 livres.    Asked how this was, she replied that she and her husband had lent  Penautier 10,000 crowns, that he had paid it back, and since then they  had had no dealings with him.    The marquise took refuge, we see, in a complete system of denial:  arrived in Paris, and confined in the Conciergerie, she did the same;  but soon other terrible charges were added, which still further  overwhelmed her.    The sergeant Cluet deposed: that, observing a lackey to M. d'Aubray, the  councillor, to be the man Lachaussee, whom he had seen in the service of  Sainte-Croix, he said to the marquise that if her brother knew that  Lachaussee had been with Sainte-Croix he would not like it, but that  Madame de Brinvilliers exclaimed, \"Dear me, don't tell my brothers; they  would give him a thrashing, no doubt, and he may just as well get his  wages as any body else.\" He said nothing to the d'Aubrays, though he saw  Lachaussee paying daily visits to Sainte-Croix and to the marquise, who  was worrying Sainte-Croix to let her have her box, and wanted her bill  for two or three thousand pistoles. Other wise she would have had him  assassinated. She often said that she was very anxious that no one  should see the contents of the box; that it was a very important matter,  but only concerned herself. After the box was opened, the witness added,  he had told the marquise, that the commissary Picard said to Lachaussee  that there were strange things in it; but the lady blushed, and changed  the subject. He asked her if she were not an accomplice. She said,  \"What! I?\" but then muttered to herself: \"Lachaussee ought to be sent  off to Picardy.\" The witness repeated that she had been after  Sainte-Croix along time about the box, and if she had got it she would  have had his throat cut. The witness further said that when he told  Briancourt that Lachaussee was taken and would doubtless confess all,  Briancourt, speaking of the marquise, remarked, \"She is a lost woman.\"  That d'Aubray's daughter had called Briancourt a rogue, but Briancourt  had replied that she little knew what obligations she was under to him;  that they had wanted to poison both her and the lieutenant's widow, and  he alone had hindered it. He had heard from Briancourt that the marquise  had often said that there are means to get rid of people one dislikes,  and they can"]]]
