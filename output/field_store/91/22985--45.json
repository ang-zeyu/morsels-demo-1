I suppose you have no palaces in America  because your Government is a republic. That is a very good thing. Our  Government is the worst possible. All the loss falls on the poor. All  the gain goes to the rich. But there are few rich in Spain. America is  the richest country of all the world. When America fought us it was as  a rich man, fed and clothed, fighting a poor man weak from famine. And  the rich man took from the poor man all that he had. Spain has nothing  left--nothing.\"    \"Oh, don't say that! Spain has the Alhambra, and beautiful churches,  beautiful pictures.\"    \"Can one eat churches and pictures, my lady?\"    \"And a fertile soil. What country outblooms Andalusia?\"    His half-shod foot kicked the battle-trampled earth of the immortal  hill contemptuously.    \"Soil! Yes. All the world has soil. It serves to be buried in.\"    This budding politician graced us with his company one Sunday  afternoon, when we went down into Granada to see a religious  procession. Our Lady of Lourdes, escorted by a distinguished train of  ecclesiastical and civic dignitaries, with pomp of many shining lights  and sonorous instruments, with peal of church bells and incongruous  popping of fireworks, passed through extended ranks of candle-bearing  worshippers, along thronged streets, where every balcony was hung with  the national red and yellow, to the Church of Mary Magdalene. There  the sacred guest was entertained with a concert, and thence conducted,  with the same processional state, amid the same reverent salutations  of the multitude, back to her own niche. Our youthful guide showed  himself so devout on this occasion, kneeling whenever the image, borne  aloft in a glory of flowers and tapers, passed us, and gazing on every  feature of the pageant with large-eyed adoration, that we asked him,  as we climbed the hill again, if he would like to be a priest. But he  shrugged his shoulders. \"There are better Christians in Spain than the  priests,\" he answered.    The son of the house, Don Pepe, a young man of five and twenty, who  usually attended us on any difficult excursion, was also frankly  outspoken in his disapproval of the clergy. He could hardly hold his  countenance in passing a Franciscan friar. \"There walks the ruin of  Spain,\" he muttered once, with bitter accent, turning to scowl after  the bareheaded, brown-frocked figure so common in Granada streets. We  had, indeed, our own little grudge against the friars, for they were  the only men of the city who forced us off the narrow sidewalks out  into the rough and dirty road. All other Granadines, from dandies to  gypsies, yielded us the strip of pavement with ready courtesy, but the  friars, three or four in Indian file, would press on their way like  graven images and drive us to take refuge among the donkeys.    This escort of ours, formally a Catholic, was no more a lover of State  than of Church. He was eager to get to work in the world and, finding  no foothold, charged up his grievance against the Government. He was  firmly persuaded that Madrid had sold the Santiago and Manila  victories to Washington for sums of money down,--deep down in  official pockets. But his talk, however angry, would always end in  throwing out the hands with a gesture of despair.    \"But what use in revolutions? Spain is tired--tired of tumult, tired  of bloodshed, tired of deceit and disappointment. A new government  would only mean the old dogs with new collars. We, the people, are  always the bone to be gnawed bare. What use in anything? Let it go as  God wills.\"    The Silvela and Polavieja ministry came in during our stay at Granada,  and the Liberal and Republican chorus against what was known as the  Reactionary Government swelled loud. \"It means the yoke of the  Jesuits,\" growled our burly host. Our Alhambra dream suffered frequent  jars from these ignoble confusions of to-day. When we were musing  comfortably on the melancholy fortunes of Boabdil, a cheap newspaper  would be thrust before our eyes with an editorial headed \"Boabdil  Sagasta.\" It is always best to do what one must. Since we could not be  left in peace to the imagination of plumy cavaliers, stars of Moslem  and Christian chivalry, who sowed this mount so thick with glorious  memories, we turned our thoughts to the poor soldiers from Cuba,  especially during the week throughout which they paraded the cities of  Spain in rag-tag companies under rude flags with the ruder motto:  \"_Hungry Repatriados_.\" Their appearance was so woful that it became a  by-word. A child, picking up from a gutter one day a mud-stained,  dog-eared notebook, cried gleefully, \"It's a _repatriado_.\" There was  no glamour here, but the courage and sacrifice, the love and anguish,  held good.    Granada had borne her share in Spain's last war sorrow. So many of her  sons were drafted for the Antilles that her anger against America  waxed hot. A few months before our arrival every star-spangled banner  that could be hunted out in shop or residence was trampled and burned  in the public squares. The Washington Irving Hotel hastened to take  down its sign, and even the driver of its omnibus was sternly warned  by the people to erase those offensive American names from his vehicle  on pain of seeing it transformed into a chariot of fire. A shot,  possibly accidental, whistled through the office of the English  consul, who was given to understand, in more ways than one, that Spain  made little difference between \"the cloaked enemy\" and the foe in the  field. Meanwhile, month after month, the recruits were marched to the  station, and the City Fathers, who came in all municipal dignity to  bid the lads godspeed, were so overwhelmed by the weeping of the women  that they forgot the cream of their speeches.    Among the new tales of Spanish valor told us on the Alhambra hill was  this:--    When lots were drawn for military service, one blithe young scapegrace  found in his hand a fortunate high number, but, walking away in fine  feather over his luck, he met the mother of a friend of his, sobbing  wildly as she went. Her son had been drafted, and the two hundred  dollars of redemption money was as far beyond her reach as those  dazzling crests of the Sierra Nevada are above the lame beggar at the  Alhambra gate. Then the kindly fellow, troubled by her grief and  mindful of the fact that, orphan as he was, his own parting would be  at no such cost of tears, offered to serve in her boy's stead. Her  passion of gratitude could not let his service go all unrecompensed.  Poorest of the poor, she went about among her humble friends, lauding  his deed, until she had collected, _peseta_ by _peseta_, the sum of  sixteen dollars, which she thrust into his hands to buy comforts for  the campaign. But another sobbing mother sought him out. He had saved  her neighbor's son; would he not save hers? Laughing at her logic and  moved by her faith in him, he answered: \"I am only one man, senora. I  cannot go in place of two. But here are sixteen dollars. If you can  find a substitute at such a price, the money is yours.\"    Sixteen dollars is a fortune to hunger and nakedness, and the  substitute was found. As the year wore on those two mothers did not  let the city forget its light-hearted hero, and a great assembly  gathered at the station to honor his return. A remnant of his comrades  descended from the train, but as for him, they said, he had died in  Cuba of the fever months before.    His was no poetic death like that of the Abencerrages. Happy  Abencerrages! They knew the Alhambra in the freshness of her beauty.  Their last uplifted glances looked upon the most exquisite ceilings in  the world. Their blood left immortal stains on the marble base of the  fountain. But this young Spaniard, in his obscure Cuban grave, only  one out of the eighty thousand, will promptly be forgotten. _No  importa._ There must be something better than glory for the man who  does more than his duty.      [Illustration: THE MOSQUE OF CORDOVA]          IV    A FUNCTION IN GRANADA         \"O Love Divine, Celestial Purity,         Pity my cries!       My soul is prone before a clouded throne.         Let thy keen light arise,       Pierce this obscurity         And free my dream-bound eyes!\"                                     --_Ganivet's Last Poem._      The civilization of Spain, streaked as it is with Oriental barbarisms,  belated and discouraged as the end of the nineteenth century finds it,  is still in many respects finer than our own. In everything that  relates to grace and charm of social intercourse, to the dignified  expression of reverence, compassion, and acknowledgment, Spain puts us  to the blush. I was especially touched in Granada by the whole-souled  sympathy and veneration with which the city rendered public honors to  one of its sons, Angel Ganivet, who died in the preceding winter, a  poet hardly thirty.    Although I had glanced over obituary notices of this Spanish writer in  the Paris papers, I had but a vague idea of his work and life, and  sought, before the night of the memorial ceremonies, for further  information. I appealed, first of all, to our table waiter, whose  keen black eyes instantly turned sad and tender.    \"_Pobre! Pobre!_ He threw himself into the river at Riga, in Russia,  where he was consul. It was at the close of the war. And he such a  genius! So young! So true a Spaniard! But all Granada will be at the  theatre. He left his play to Granada, asking that it be seen here  first of all. I have never read his books, but I have met him in the  streets, and lifted my hat to him for a wise _caballero_ who cared  greatly for Spain.\"    My next appeal was to our kind neighbor, the English consul, who  assured me laughingly that he, like myself, was vainly"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38777"],[0,"Lad: A Dog (#7)"],[1,"the inner wooden blinds in search  of the catch.    The blinds parted slowly. Over the window-sill the man threw a  leg. Then he stepped down, noiselessly into the room.    He stood there a second, evidently listening.    And, before he could stir or breathe, something in the darkness hurled  itself upon him.    Without so much as a growl of warning, eighty pounds of muscular,  hairy energy smote the negro full in the chest. A set of hot-breathing  jaws flashed for his jugular vein, missed it by a half-inch, and the  graze left a red-hot searing pain along the negro's throat. In the  merest fraction of a moment, the murderously snapping jaws sank into  the thief's shoulder. It is collie custom to fight with a running  accompaniment of snarling growls. But Lad did not give voice. In  total silence he made his onslaught. In silence, he sought and gained  his hold.    The negro was less considerate of the Mistress' comfort. With a  screech that would have waked every mummy in Egypt, he reeled back,  under that first unseen impact, lost his balance and crashed to the  hardwood floor, overturning a table and a lamp in his fall. Certain  that a devil had attacked him there in the black darkness, the man  gave forth yell after yell of mortal terror. Frantically, he strove to  push away his assailant and his clammy hand encountered a mass of fur.    The negro had heard that all the dogs on The Place had been sent away  because of the Mistress' illness. Hence his attempt at burglary. Hence  also, his panic fear when Lad had sprung on him.    But with the feel of the thick warm fur, the man's superstitious  terror died. He knew he had roused the house; but there was still  time to escape if he could rid himself of this silent, terrible  creature. He staggered to his feet. And, with the knife he still  clutched, he smote viciously at his assailant.    Because Lad was a collie, Lad was not killed then and there. A bulldog  or a bull-terrier, attacking a man, seeks for some convenient  hold. Having secured that hold--be it good or bad--he locks his jaws  and hangs on. You can well-nigh cut his head from his body before he  will let go. Thus, he is at the mercy of any armed man who can keep  cool long enough to kill him.    But a collie has a strain of wolf in his queer brain. He seeks a hold,  it is true. But at an instant's notice, he is ready to shift that hold  for a better. He may bite or slash a dozen times in as many seconds  and in as many parts of the body. He is everywhere at once--he is  nowhere in particular. He is not a pleasant opponent.    Lad did not wait for the negro's knife to find his heart. As the man  lunged, the dog transferred his profitless shoulderhold to a grip on  the stabbing arm. The knife blade plowed an ugly furrow along his  side. And the dog's curved eye-tooth slashed the negro's arm from  elbow to wrist, clean through to the bone.    The knife clattered to the floor. The negro wheeled and made a leap  for the open window; he had not cleared half the space when Lad  bounded for the back of his neck. The dog's upper set of teeth raked  the man's hard skull, carrying away a handful of wool and flesh; and  his weight threw the thief forward on hands and knees again. Twisting,  the man found the dog's furry throat; and with both hands sought to  strangle him; at the same time backing out through the window. But it  is not easy to strangle a collie. The piles of tumbled ruff-hair form  a protection no other breed of dog can boast. Scarcely had the hands  found their grip when one of them was crushed between the dog's  vise-like jaws.    The negro flung off his enemy and turned to clear the veranda at a  single jump. But before he had half made the turn, Lad was at his  throat again, and the two crashed through the vines together and down  onto the driveway below. The entire combat had not lasted for more  than thirty seconds.    The Master, pistol and flashlight in hand, ran down to find the  living-room amuck with blood and with smashed furniture, and one of  the windows open. He flashed the electric ray through the window. On  the ground below, stunned by striking against a stone jardiniere in  his fall, the negro sprawled senseless upon his back. Above him  was Lad, his searching teeth at last having found their coveted  throat-hold. Steadily, the great dog was grinding his way through  toward the jugular.    There was a deal of noise and excitement and light after that. The  negro was trussed up and the local constable was summoned by  telephone. Everybody seemed to be doing much loud talking.    Lad took advantage of the turmoil to slip back into the house and to  his \"cave\" under the piano; where he proceeded to lick solicitously  the flesh wound on his left side.    He was very tired; and he was very unhappy and he was very much  worried. In spite of all his own precautions as to silence, the negro  had made a most ungodly lot of noise. The commandment \"_Quiet!_\" had  been fractured past repair. And, somehow, Lad felt blame for it  all. It was really his fault--and he realized it now--that the man had  made such a racket. Would the Master punish him? Perhaps. Humans have  such odd ideas of Justice. He----    Then it was that the Master found him; and called him forth from his  place of refuge. Head adroop, tail low, Lad crept out to meet his  scolding. He looked very much like a puppy caught tearing a new rug.    But suddenly, the Master and everyone else in the room was patting him  and telling him how splendid he was. And the Master had found the deep  scratch on his side and was dressing it, and stopping every minute or  so, to praise him again. And then, as a crowning reward, he was taken  upstairs for the Mistress to stroke and make much of.    When at last he was sent downstairs again, Lad did not return to  his piano-lair. Instead, he went out-of-doors and away from The  Place. And, when he thought he was far enough from the house, he  solemnly sat down and began to bark.    It was good--_passing_ good--to be able to make a noise again. He had  never before known how needful to canine happiness a bark really  is. He had long and pressing arrears of barks in his system. And  thunderously he proceeded to divest himself of them for nearly half an  hour.    Then, feeling much, _much_ better, he ambled homeward, to take up  normal life again after a whole fortnight of martyrdom.          CHAPTER III    A MIRACLE OF TWO      The connecting points between the inner and outer Lad were a pair of  the wisest and darkest and most sorrowful eyes in all dogdom--eyes  that gave the lie to folk who say no dog has a soul. There are such  dogs once in a human generation.    Lad had but one tyrant in all the world. That was his dainty  gold-and-white collie-mate, Lady; Lady, whose affections he had won in  fair life-and-death battle with a younger and stronger dog; Lady, who  bullied him unmercifully and teased him and did fearful things to his  stately dignity; and to whom he allowed liberties that would have  brought any other aggressor painfully near to death.    Lady was high-strung and capricious; a collie de luxe. Lad and she  were as oddly contrasted a couple, in body and mind, as one could find  in a day's journey through their North Jersey hinterland. To The  Place (at intervals far too few between to suit Lad), came human  guests; people, for the most part, who did not understand dogs and who  either drew away in causeless fear from them or else insisted on  patting or hauling them about.    Lad detested guests. He met their advances with cold courtesy, and, as  soon as possible, got himself out of their way. He knew the Law far  too well to snap or to growl at a guest. But the Law did not compel  him to stay within patting distance of one.    The careless caress of the Mistress or the Master--especially of the  Mistress--was a delight to him. He would sport like an overgrown  puppy with either of these deities; throwing dignity to the four  winds. But to them alone did he unbend--to them and to his adored  tyrant, Lady.    To The Place, of a cold spring morning, came a guest; or two  guests. Lad at first was not certain which. The visible guest was a  woman. And, in her arms she carried a long bundle that might have been  anything at all.    Long as was the bundle, it was ridiculously light. Or, rather,  pathetically light. For its folds contained a child, five years old; a  child that ought to have weighed more than forty pounds and weighed  barely twenty. A child with a wizened little old face, and with a  skeleton body which was powerless from the waist down.    Six months earlier, the Baby had been as vigorous and jolly as a  collie pup. Until an invisible Something prowled through the land,  laying Its finger-tips on thousands of such jolly and vigorous  youngsters, as frost's fingers are laid on autumn flowers--and with  the same hideous effect.    This particular Baby had not died of the plague, as had so many of her  fellows. At least, her brain and the upper half of her body had not  died.    Her mother had been counseled to try mountain air for the hopeless  little invalid. She had written to her distant relative, the Mistress,  asking leave to spend a month at The Place.    Lad viewed the arrival of the adult guest with no interest and with  less pleasure. He stood, aloof, at one side of the veranda, as the  newcomer alighted from the car.    But, when the Master took the long bundle from her arms and carried it  up the steps, Lad waxed curious. Not only because the Master handled  his burden so carefully, but because the collie's uncanny scent-power  told him all at once that it was human.    Lad had never seen a human carried in this manner. It did not make  sense to him. And he stepped, hesitantly, forward to investigate.    The Master laid the bundle tenderly on the veranda hammock-swing, and  loosed the blanket-folds that swathed it. Lad came over to him, and  looked"]]]
