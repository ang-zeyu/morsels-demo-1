Meanwhile his  passion increased with every impediment--yet he gained no assurance of  its being returned, save what his heart whispered to him. In the  _Jardin des Plants_ they were accustomed to meet daily, when the weather  was propitious--so much Emilie yielded to her lover--and spend an hour  together; and if they could not meet in the open air, they repaired to  the house where they first became acquainted. On one occasion Dervilly,  unable to bear suspense any longer, seized her hand, and passionately  pledged himself, his existence, his soul, his all to Emilie de Coigny;  he swore his fate was indissolubly linked with hers, that their destiny  could not be severed, and he demanded from her an avowal of the truth of  what he said. The violence of Dervilly alarmed her; she drew her hand  from his, and looking him steadily in the face, inquired:    \"'What has prompted Monsieur to this sudden show of feeling?'    \"'Do you ask what?' exclaimed Dervilly; 'it is _you_. Are you not  answered? How can I resist what is inevitable? how curb myself when  _all_ hold is lost? Are you then so cruel? _Dieu merci!_ be not so  deadly calm--it means the worst for me--be angry, vexed, any thing, but  look not on me with that glazed look--it maddens me.'    \"'Monsieur Dervilly,' said Emilie, without change of tone or manner,  'what you have said, if it means any thing, means every thing; it means  all a maiden longs to hear from lips that are beloved. To respond, I  must be assured how far your judgment will confirm what now seems to be  a mere passionate ebullition. Excuse me,' she continued, as Dervilly  made an impatient gesture; 'I have heard and read of similar  protestations which had little true significance.'    \"'I accept any conditions,' interrupted the young man, 'and will bless  you from the depths of my soul for naming any, even the hardest; yes,  the hardest--I care not what, so that they are from you.' The girl  regarded Dervilly as if she would search his very nature. 'You are  silent--speak; I can no longer contain myself,' exclaimed he, wildly.    \"'Monsieur,' once more observed Mademoiselle de Coigny, 'you know not to  whom you address yourself; should I tell you, you would retract all  those strong words, and hasten to escape in the least humiliating way  possible.'    \"'Never. Heaven is my witness, never! I care not who you are; I will  never seek to know; when you choose, you shall inform me. You need never  tell me. I say, I care not, so that you are mine.'    \"'And you will be _mine_ for ever?' said the girl, slowly.    \"'For ever.'    \"'I am yours--yours,' and Emilie de Coigny sunk into the arms of her  lover.    \"In one instant the fortunes of Dervilly were changed--from despair he  was raised to a condition of delicious joy. His raptures were so  unnatural, that I cautioned him against such violent indulgence of them.  But he was too excited to listen to me. Indeed, I feared he would lose  his reason. It seemed as if more than ordinary passion had possession of  him, and that it was inspired by something unearthly; and, without ever  having seen the girl, I began to attribute to her a supernatural  influence. Besides, Dervilly confessed he knew as little of his  affianced as before, and that occasionally the same icy look would be  turned on him, as it were quite inadvertently, and hold him spell-bound  with horror, while it still served to increase his frenzy beyond all  bounds. Then, her endearing smiles, her truthful and confiding love, her  absolute reliance, her entire dependence, on Dervilly, made him so  frantic with happiness, that he lost all capacity to reason.    \"The summer passed away, but Dervilly had learned nothing more of the  history of his betrothed; she still avoided the subject, and, when he  alluded to it, she would beg him to desist, and hide her face in his  bosom and weep.    \"Strange thoughts at last found their way into his brain, fearful  surmises began to disturb his peace, and, when absent from Emilie, he  would resolve at their next interview, to insist on knowing all. But  when the time came, and he met, turned on him, the open and innocent  look of the maiden's clear eyes, which expressed so earnestly how  entirely her soul rested on his, all courage failed him, and he could  not go on.....           *       *       *       *       *    \"One evening,\" continued Partridge, after a pause, and with the tone of  a person approaching an unpleasant subject, \"One evening, after  dinner--I think it was the first week in September--when the day had  been excessively sultry, I strolled into the large garden, which you  recollect belonged to our old lodgings in the _Rue d' Enfer_ and after a  while sat down in the summer-house. Presently little Sophie Lecomte came  running out to me, and I remained amusing myself with the child's  prattle till it was dark. The moon shone brightly, and I did not  perceive how late it was, until reminded of the hour by finding that  Sophie was fast asleep in my lap. I rose and carried her into the house,  and went quietly to my room. I seated myself near the window without  lighting the candles, feeling that the glare would not just then  harmonize with my feelings. The truth is, I was thinking of you, and of  that romantic passage across the Apennines, and of the fair stranger,  and so forth. I sat by the window, the moonlight streaming across the  room, over the top of the old chapel, the windows and doors open, and  every thing still except the monotonous chirping of a single cricket,  louder than that of any French cricket I ever heard before, and which  sung the very same song I used to hear when a boy from under the large  kitchen hearthstone at home. I began to feel a little lonely, and so  started up, and stamped with my feet in order to silence the solitary  insect, or arouse the rest of the family, but the old one only sung the  harder, and the others would not wake, and I sat down again, and half  closed my eyes in order to lose myself, if I could, in some pleasant  revery. My eyes _were_ half closed, the perfume from the graperies  filled the room, and had a pleasant effect upon my senses, and thus I  began to forget where I was and what was about me. Presently I heard a  rapid unsteady step along the corridor; it grew more rapid and more  unsteady; I raised my head, and at that instant Dervilly hurried into  the room. 'I knew it--I knew it,' he exclaimed, wildly; 'one of the  sirens sent from hell! I have sold myself, body and soul!--I am  lost--lost. Ah! I knew it--I knew it.' Shocked and surprised as I was by  such an extraordinary scene, I did not forget that Dervilly was of a  most nervous and excitable temperament. I rose, took hold of him kindly,  and asked him what had happened. As I placed my hand on his head, I  perceived that the veins were distended, and that the carotid and  temporal arteries were throbbing violently. I hastened to strike a  light, while he continued to repeat nearly the words I have just  mentioned, in a wild and incoherent manner. I could now see his  countenance, and it seemed as if the destroyer had been ravaging it. His  cap was gone. His hair, which was usually so neatly arranged, was tossed  over his face in twisted locks; his eyes were fixed, and bloodshot, and  sparkling.    \"'My dear friend, you are ill--you are excited--let me bring you to your  bed' (we occupied the large room in common, with a small bedroom for  each, leading from it); with this I took his arm, and gently urged him  to his apartment.    \"'Not there, not there!' he cried vehemently; 'Have I not lain _there_,  night after night, thinking of her?--have I not dreamed there happy  dreams, and seen dear delightful visions? Not there--never--never  again!'    \"'You shall not,' I said, endeavoring to humor him; 'you shall lie in my  bed, and I will watch by you till you are better.'    \"The young man burst into tears. This action evidently relieved him, and  made him more rational, for he took my arm and I assisted him to bed,  and tried to soothe him; but he soon relapsed into an excited fever.  Shortly after, he called me to him, and throwing his arms closely around  me, exclaimed, 'Partridge, we were born in the same land; I implore you,  by that one common tie, not to leave me an instant; I am a doomed  wretch; but save me, save me from the fiend, as long as it is possible.'    \"I now became very much alarmed. My first impulse was to administer an  opiate; but the case seemed so critical that I determined to send at  once for Louis, whose sympathy for the students, you know, is universal.  I called to young Stabb, who occupied the next room, and he set off  immediately. After a few minutes Dervilly dozed a little; and then he  started up, and gazed around, as if attempting to discern some object.    \"'Do you wish for any thing?' I said. He took no notice of my question,  but continued to glance piercingly in every direction.    \"'What do you see?' I asked.    \"'_La Morgue!_' he exclaimed, with a shudder, and pointing into the  other room--'_La Morgue!_'    \"He continued to gaze madly in the same way, still holding his arm  outstretched, while his whole frame seemed convulsed with terror; but I  could gain no clue to the catastrophe which had fallen so terribly on  the ill-fated sufferer.    \"It seemed to me an age--it really was but an hour--before Stabb  returned. He was accompanied by Louis. It was the great Louis whose  skill as a physician, and especially in the treatment of fevers, is  world renowned. I had 'followed' him during the whole of your absence;  had become, as a matter of course, one of his warmest admirers; and was  fortunate enough to secure his friendship. He also knew Dervilly.  Hearing them enter, I stepped into the principal room, to meet him.  '_Mon Dieu! Monsieur Partridge, quel est le mal?_' said Louis, with  great feeling.

But as severity alone was known to be inadequate at once to chastize and  reform, no opportunity was omitted to assure the convicts, that by  their good behaviour and submissive deportment, every claim to present  distinction and future favour was to be earned. That this caution was  not attended with all the good effects which were hoped from it, I have  only to lament; that it operated in some cases is indisputable; nor will  a candid and humane mind fail to consider and allow for the situation  these unfortunate beings so peculiarly stood in. While they were on  board ship, the two sexes had been kept most rigorously apart; but,  when landed, their separation became impracticable, and would have been,  perhaps, wrong. Licentiousness was the unavoidable consequence, and  their old habits of depravity were beginning to recur. What was to be  attempted? To prevent their intercourse was impossible; and to palliate  its evils only remained. Marriage was recommended, and such advantages  held out to those who aimed at reformation, as have greatly contributed  to the tranquillity of the settlement.    On the Sunday after our landing divine service was performed under a  great tree, by the Rev. Mr. Johnson, Chaplain of the Settlement, in the  presence of the troops and convicts, whose behaviour on the occasion  was equally regular and attentive. In the course of our passage this  had been repeated every Sunday, while the ships were in port; and in  addition to it, Mr. Johnson had furnished them with books, at once  tending to promote instruction and piety.    The Indians for a little while after our arrival paid us frequent  visits, but in a few days they were observed to be more shy of our  company. From what cause their distaste: arose we never could trace,  as we had made it our study, on these occasions, to treat them with  kindness, and load them with presents. No quarrel had happened, and we  had flattered ourselves, from Governor Phillip's first reception among  them, that such a connection might be established as would tend to the  interest of both parties. It seems, that on that occasion, they not only  received our people with great cordiality, but so far acknowledged their  authority as to submit, that a boundary, during their first interview,  might be drawn on the sand, which they attempted not to infringe, and  appeared to be satisfied with.          CHAPTER X.        The reading of the Commissions, and taking Possession of the Settlement,  in form. With an Account of the Courts of Law, and Mode of administering  Public Justice in this Country.      Owing to the multiplicity of pressing business necessary to be performed  immediately after landing, it was found impossible to read the public  commissions and take possession of the colony in form, until the 7th of  February. On that day all the officers of guard took post in the marine  battalion, which was drawn up, and marched off the parade with music  playing, and colours flying, to an adjoining ground, which had been  cleared for the occasion, whereon the convicts were assembled to hear  His Majesty's commission read, appointing his Excellency Arthur Phillip,  Esq. Governor and Captain General in and over the territory of New South  Wales, and its dependencies; together with the Act of Parliament for  establishing trials by law within the same; and the patents under the  Great Seal of Great Britain, for holding the civil and criminal courts  of judicature, by which all cases of life and death, as well as matters  of property, were to be decided. When the Judge Advocate had finished  reading, his Excellency addressed himself to the convicts in a pointed  and judicious speech, informing them of his future intentions, which  were, invariably to cherish and render happy those who shewed a  disposition to amendment; and to let the rigour of the law take its  course against such as might dare to transgress the bounds prescribed.  At the close three vollies were fired in honour of the occasion, and the  battalion marched back to their parade, where they were reviewed by the  Governor, who was received with all the honours due to his rank. His  Excellency was afterwards pleased to thank them, in public orders,  for their behaviour from the time of their embarkation; and to ask the  officers to partake of a cold collation at which it is scarce  necessary to observe, that many loyal and public toasts were drank in  commemoration of the day.    In the Governor's commission, the extent of this authority is defined  to reach from the latitude of 43 deg 49 min south, to the latitude of  10 deg 37 min south, being the northern and southern extremities of  the continent of New Holland. It commences again at 135th degree of  longitude east of Greenwich, and, proceeding in an easterly direction,  includes all islands within the limits of the above specified latitudes  in the Pacific Ocean. By this partition it may be fairly presumed, that  every source of future litigation between the Dutch and us will be  for ever cut off, as the discoveries of English navigators alone are  comprized in this territory.    Nor have Government been more backward in arming Mr. Phillip with  plenitude of power, than extent of dominion. No mention is made of a  Council to be appointed, so that he is left to act entirely from his own  judgment. And as no stated time of assembling the Courts of justice is  pointed out, similar to the assizes and gaol deliveries of England,  the duration of imprisonment is altogether in his hands. The power of  summoning General Courts Martial to meet he is also invested with, but  the insertion in the marine mutiny act, of a smaller number of officers  than thirteen being able to compose such a tribunal, has been neglected:  so that a Military court, should detachments be made from headquarters,  or sickness prevail, may not always be found practicable to be obtained,  unless the number of officers, at present in the Settlement, shall be  increased.    Should the Governor see cause, he is enabled to grant pardons to  offenders convicted, \"in all cases whatever, treason and wilful murder  excepted,\" and even in these, has authority to stay the execution of  the law, until the King's pleasure shall be signified. In case of the  Governor's death, the Lieutenant Governor takes his place; and on his  demise, the senior officer on the spot is authorised to assume the reins  of power.    Notwithstanding the promises made on one side, and the forbearance  shewn on the other, joined to the impending rod of justice, it was  with infinite regret that every one saw, in four clays afterwards, the  necessity of assembling a Criminal Court, which was accordingly convened  by warrant from the Governor, and consisted of the judge Advocate, who  presided, three naval, and three marine officers.    As the constitution of this court is altogether new in the British  annals, I hope my reader will not think me prolix in the description  I am about to give of it. The number of members, including the judge  Advocate, is limited, by Act of Parliament, to seven, who are expressly  ordered to be officers, either of His Majesty's sea or land forces. The  court being met, completely arrayed and armed as at a military tribunal,  the Judge Advocate proceeds to administer the usual oaths taken by  jurymen in England to each member; one of whom afterwards swears him  in a like manner. This ceremony being adjusted, the crime laid to the  prisoner's charge is read to him, and the question of Guilty, or Not  guilty, put. No law officer on the side of the crown being appointed,  (for I presume the head of the court ought hardly to consider himself  in that light, notwithstanding the title he bears) to prosecute the  criminal is left entirely to the party, at whose suit he is tried. All  the witnesses are examined on oath, and the decision is directed to  be given according to the laws of England, \"or as nearly as may be,  allowing for the circumstances and situation of the settlement,\" by a  majority of votes, beginning with the youngest member, and ending with  the president of the court. In cases, however, of a capital nature,  no verdict can be given, unless five, at least, of the seven members  present concur therein. The evidence on both sides being finished,  and the prisoner's defence heard, the court is cleared, and, on the  judgement being settled, is thrown open again, and sentence pronounced.  During the time the court sits, the place in which it is assembled is  directed to be surrounded by a guard under arms, and admission to every  one who may choose to enter it, granted. Of late, however, our colonists  are supposed to be in such a train of subordination, as to make the  presence of so large a military force unnecessary; and two centinels, in  addition to the Provost Martial, are considered as sufficient.    It would be as needless, as impertinent, to anticipate the reflections  which will arise in reading the above account, wherein a regard to  accuracy only has been consulted. By comparing it with the mode of  administering justice in the English courts of law, it will be found to  differ in many points very essentially. And if we turn our eyes to  the usage of military tribunals, it no less departs from the customs  observed in them. Let not the novelty of it, however, prejudice any one  so far as to dispute its efficacy, and the necessity of the case which  gave it birth.    The court, whose meeting is already spoken of, proceeded to the trial of  three convicts, one of whom was convicted of having struck a marine with  a cooper's adze, and otherwise behaving in a very riotous and scandalous  manner, for which he was sentenced to receive one hundred and fifty  lashes, being a smaller punishment than a soldier in a like case would  have suffered from the judgement of a court martial.
