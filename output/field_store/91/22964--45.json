With no more  dirty work for him to do, they sent him over to Dublin, to be rid of his  presence.    When fairly settled down in a country which he had always hitherto  affected at least to detest, he began to feel perhaps some genuine  attachment for its people, and on many occasions he exerted himself  vigorously for their advantage; though it is possible that the real  impulse was a desire to vex and embarrass the administration, which had  so galled his self-conceit. Whatever the motive, however, he undoubtedly  worked industriously and with great effect, for the benefit of Ireland.  His style was calculated to be popular: it was simple, transparent, and  though copious, pointed and energetic. His pamphlets, in the midst of  their reasoning, sarcasm, and solemn banter, displayed an extent, a  variety and profundity of knowledge altogether unequaled in the case of  any other writer of that time. But the action of his extraordinary  powers was never guided by a spark of honorable principle. The giant was  as unscrupulous as the puniest and basest demagogue who coined and  scattered lies for our own last election. He would seem to be the model  whom half a dozen of our city editors were striving with weaker wing to  imitate. He never acknowledged any merit in his antagonists, he  scattered his libels right and left without mercy, threw out of sight  all the charities and even decencies of private life, and affirmed the  most monstrous propositions with so cool, calm and solemn an air, that  in nine cases out of ten they were sure to be believed.    Without further observation we proceed with the interesting article of  _The Times_, occasioned by M. Leon de Wailly's curious and very clever  romance of \"Stella and Vanessa.\"      [Illustration: \"VANESSA.\" (MISS VANHOMRIGH.)]    [From the London Times.]    THE AMOURS OF DEAN SWIFT.    Greater men than Dean Swift may have lived. A more remarkable man never  left his impress upon the age immortalized by his genius. To say that  English history supplies no narrative more singular and original than  the career of Jonathan Swift is to assert little. We doubt whether the  histories of the world can furnish, for example and instruction, for  wonder and pity, for admiration and scorn, for approval and  condemnation, a specimen of humanity at once so illustrious and so  small. Before the eyes of his contemporaries Swift stood a living  enigma. To posterity he must continue forever a distressing puzzle. One  hypothesis--and one alone--gathered from a close and candid perusal of  all that has been transmitted to us upon this interesting subject, helps  us to account for a whole life of anomaly, but not to clear up the  mystery in which it is shrouded. From the beginning to the end of his  days Jonathan Swift was more or less MAD.    Intellectually and morally, physically and religiously, Dean Swift was a  mass of contradictions. His career yields ample materials both for the  biographer who would pronounce a panegyric over his tomb and for the  censor whose business it is to improve one generation at the expense of  another. Look at Swift with the light of intelligence shining on his  brow, and you note qualities that might become an angel. Survey him  under the dark cloud, and every feature is distorted into that of a  fiend. If we tell the reader what he was, in the same breath we shall  communicate all that he was not. His virtues were exaggerated into  vices, and his vices were not without the savour of virtue. The  originality of his writings is of a piece with the singularity of his  character. He copied no man who preceded him. He has not been  successfully imitated by any who have followed him. The compositions of  Swift reveal the brilliancy of sharpened wit, yet it is recorded of the  man that he was never known to laugh. His friendships were strong and  his antipathies vehement and unrelenting, yet he illustrated friendship  by roundly abusing his familiars and expressed hatred by bantering his  foes. He was economical and saving to a fault, yet he made sacrifices to  the indigent and poor sternly denied to himself. He could begrudge the  food and wine consumed by a guest, yet throughout his life refuse to  derive the smallest pecuniary advantage from his published works, and at  his death bequeath the whole of his fortune to a charitable institution.  From his youth Swift was a sufferer in body, yet his frame was vigorous,  capable of great endurance, and maintained its power and vitality from  the time of Charles II. until far on in the reign of the second George.  No man hated Ireland more than Swift, yet he was Ireland's first and  greatest patriot, bravely standing up for the rights of that kingdom  when his chivalry might have cost him his head. He was eager for reward,  yet he refused payment with disdain. Impatient of advancement, he  preferred to the highest honors the State could confer the obscurity and  ignominy of the political associates with whom he had affectionately  labored until they fell disgraced. None knew better than he the stinging  force of a successful lampoon, yet such missiles were hurled by hundreds  at his head without in any way disturbing his bodily tranquillity.  Sincerely religious, scrupulously attentive to the duties of his holy  office, vigorously defending the position and privileges of his order,  he positively played into the hands of infidelity by the steps he took,  both in his conduct and writings, to expose the cant and hypocrisy which  he detested as heartily as he admired and practiced unaffected piety. To  say that Swift lacked tenderness would be to forget many passages of his  unaccountable history that overflow with gentleness of spirit and mild  humanity; but to deny that he exhibited inexcusable brutality where the  softness of his nature ought to have been chiefly evoked--where the want  of tenderness, indeed, left him a naked and irreclaimable savage--is  equally impossible. If we decline to pursue the contradictory series  further, it is in pity to the reader, not for want of materials at  command. There is, in truth, no end to such materials.    Swift was born in the year 1667. His father, who was steward to the  Society of the King's Inn, Dublin, died before his birth and left his  widow penniless. The child, named Jonathan after his father, was brought  up on charity. The obligation due to an uncle was one that Swift would  never forget, or remember without inexcusable indignation. Because he  had not been left to starve by his relatives, or because his uncle would  not do more than he could, Swift conceived an eternal dislike to all who  bore his name and a haughty contempt for all who partook of his nature.  He struggled into active life and presented himself to his fellow-men in  the temper of a foe. At the age of fourteen he was admitted into Trinity  College, Dublin, and four years afterward as _a special grace_--for his  acquisitions apparently failed to earn the distinction--the degree of  Bachelor of Arts was conferred upon him. In 1688, the year in which the  war broke out in Ireland, Swift, in his twenty-first year, and without a  sixpence in his pocket, left college. Fortunately for him, the wife of  Sir William Temple was related to his mother, and upon her application  to that statesman the friendless youth was provided with a home. He took  up his abode with Sir William in England, and for the space of two years  labored hard at his own improvement and for the amusement of his patron.  How far Swift succeeded in winning the good opinion of Sir William may  be learnt from the fact that when King William honored Moor Park with  his presence he was permitted to take part in the interviews, and that  when Sir William was unable to visit the King his _protege_ was  commissioned to wait upon His Majesty, and to speak on the patron's  authority and behalf. The lad's future promised better things than his  beginning. He resolved to go into the church, since preferment stared  him in the face. In 1692 he proceeded to Oxford, where he obtained his  Master's degree, and in 1694, quarreling with Sir William Temple, who  coldly offered him a situation worth L100 a year, he quitted his patron  in disgust and went at once to Ireland to take holy orders. He was  ordained, and almost immediately afterward received the living of  Kilroot in the diocese of Connor, the value of the living being about  equal to that of the appointment offered by Sir William Temple.    Swift, miserable in his exile, sighed for the advantages he had  abandoned. Sir William Temple, lonely without his clever and keen-witted  companion, pined for his return. The prebend of Kilroot was speedily  resigned in favor of a poor curate for whom Swift had taken great pains  to procure the presentation; and with L80 in his purse the independent  clergyman proceeded once more to Moor Park. Sir William welcomed him  with open arms. They resided together until 1699, when the great  statesman died, leaving to Swift, in testimony of his regard, the sum of  L100 and his literary remains. The remains were duly published and  humbly dedicated to the King. They might have been inscribed to His  Majesty's cook for any advantage that accrued to the editor. Swift was a  Whig, but his politics suffered severely by the neglect of His Majesty,  who derived no particular advantage from Sir William Temple's \"remains.\"    Weary with long and vain attendance upon Court, Swift finally accepted  at the hands of Lord Berkeley, one of the Lords"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3788"],[0,"Haydn (#7)"],[1," an artist. She used his manuscript scores  for curling papers and underlays for the pastry, and wrote to him when  he was in England for money to buy a \"widow's home.\" He was even driven  to pitifully undignified expedients to protect his hard-earned cash from  her extravagant hands.    There are not many details of Anna Maria's behaviour, for Haydn was  discreetly reticent about his domestic affairs; and only two references  can be found in all his published correspondence to the woman who had  rendered his life miserable. But these anecdotes tell us enough. For a  long time he tried making the best of it; but making the best of it is  a poor affair when it comes to a man and woman living together, and the  day arrived when the composer realized that to live entirely apart was  the only way of ending a union that had proved anything but a foretaste  of heaven. Frau Haydn looked to spend her last years in a \"widow's home\"  provided for her by the generosity of her husband, but she predeceased  him by nine years, dying at Baden, near Vienna, on the 20th of March  1800. With this simple statement of facts we may finally dismiss a  matter that is best left to silence--to where \"beyond these voices there  is peace.\"    Whether Count Morzin would have retained the services of Haydn in spite  of his marriage is uncertain. The question was not put to the test, for  the count fell into financial embarrassments and had to discharge his  musical establishment. A short time before this, Prince Paul Anton  Esterhazy had heard some of Haydn's compositions when on a visit to  Morzin, and, being favourably impressed thereby, he resolved to engage  Haydn should an opportunity ever present itself. The opportunity had  come, and Haydn entered the service of a family who were practically  his life-long patrons, and with whom his name must always be intimately  associated.        CHAPTER III. EISENSTADT--1761-1766    The Esterhazy Family--Haydn's Agreement--An \"Upper Servant\"?--Dependence  in the Order of Nature--Material and Artistic Advantages of the  Esterhazy Appointment--Some Disadvantages--Capellmeister Werner--A  Posthumous Tribute--Esterhazy \"The Magnificent\"--Compositions for  Baryton--A Reproval--Operettas and other Occasional Works--First  Symphonies.    The Esterhazy Family    As Haydn served the Esterhazys uninterruptedly for the long period of  thirty years, a word or two about this distinguished family will not  be out of place. At the present time the Esterhazy estates include  twenty-nine lordships, with twenty-one castles, sixty market towns, and  414 villages in Hungary, besides lordships in Lower Austria and a county  in Bavaria. This alone will give some idea of the power and importance  of the house to which Haydn was attached. The family was divided into  three main branches, but it is with the Frakno or Forchtenstein line  that we are more immediately concerned. Count Paul Esterhazy of Frakno  (1635-1713) served in the Austrian army with such distinction as to gain  a field-marshal's baton at the age of thirty. He was the first prince  of the name, having been ennobled in 1687 for his successes against the  Turks and his support of the House of Hapsburg. He was a musical amateur  and a performer of some ability, and it was to him that the family owed  the existence of the Esterhazy private chapel, with its solo singers,  its chorus, and its orchestra. Indeed, it was this prince who, in 1683,  built the splendid Palace of Eisenstadt, at the foot of the Leitha  mountains, in Hungary, where Haydn was to spend so many and such  momentous years.    When Prince Paul died in 1713, he was succeeded by his son, Joseph  Anton, who acquired \"enormous wealth,\" and raised the Esterhazy family  to \"the height of its glory.\" This nobleman's son, Paul Anton, was the  reigning prince when Haydn was called to Eisenstadt in 1761. He was a  man of fifty, and had already a brilliant career behind him. Twice  in the course of the Seven Years' War he had \"equipped and maintained  during a whole campaign a complete regiment of hussars for the service  of his royal mistress,\" and, like his distinguished ancestor, he had  been elevated to the dignity of field-marshal. He was passionately  devoted to the fine arts, more particularly to music, and played the  violin with eminent skill. Under his reign the musical establishment  at Eisenstadt enjoyed a prosperity unknown at any other period of its  history.    Haydn's Agreement    As there will be something to say about the terms and nature of Haydn's  engagement with Prince Paul Anton, it may be well to quote the text of  the agreement which he was required to sign. It was in these terms:    FORM OF AGREEMENT AND INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE VICE-CAPELLMEISTER    \"This day (according to the date hereto appended) Joseph Heyden  [sic] native of Rohrau, in Austria, is accepted and appointed  Vice-Capellmeister in the service of his Serene Highness, Paul Anton,  Prince of the Holy Roman Empire, of Esterhazy and Galantha, etc., etc.,  with the conditions here following:    \"1st. Seeing that the Capellmeister at Eisenstadt, by name Gregorius  Werner, having devoted many years of true and faithful service to the  princely house, is now, on account of his great age and infirmities,  unfit to perform the duties incumbent on him, therefore the said  Gregorious Werner, in consideration of his long services, shall  retain the post of Capellmeister, and the said Joseph Heyden as  Vice-Capellmeister shall, as far as regards the music of the choir, be  subordinate to the Capellmeister and receive his instructions. But  in everything else relating to musical performances, and in all that  concerns the orchestra, the Vice-Capellmeister shall have the sole  direction.    \"2nd. The said Joseph Heyden shall be considered and treated as a member  of the household. Therefore his Serene Highness is graciously pleased  to place confidence in his conducting himself as becomes an honourable  official of a princely house. He must be temperate, not showing himself  overbearing towards his musicians, but mild and lenient, straightforward  and composed. It is especially to be observed that when the orchestra  shall be summoned to perform before company, the Vice-Capellmeister and  all the musicians shall appear in uniform, and the said Joseph Heyden  shall take care that he and all members of his orchestra do follow  the instructions given, and appear in white stockings, white linen,  powdered, and either with a pig-tail or a tie-wig.    \"3rd. Seeing that the other musicians are referred for directions to  the said Vice-Capellmeister, therefore he should take the more care  to conduct himself in an exemplary manner, abstaining from undue  familiarity, and from vulgarity in eating, drinking and conversation,  not dispensing with the respect due to him, but acting uprightly and  influencing his subordinates to preserve such harmony as is becoming  in them, remembering how displeasing the consequences of any discord or  dispute would be to his Serene Highness.    \"4th. The said Vice-Capellmeister shall be under an obligation to  compose such music as his Serene Highness may command, and neither to  communicate such compositions to any other person, nor to allow them to  be copied, but to retain them for the absolute use of his Highness, and  not to compose anything for any other person without the knowledge and  permission of his Highness.    \"5th. The said Joseph Heyden shall appear in the ante-chamber daily,  before and after mid-day, and inquire whether his Highness is pleased  to order a performance of the orchestra. After receipt of his orders be  shall communicate them to the other musicians and shall take care to  be punctual at the appointed time, and to ensure punctuality in  his subordinates, making a note of those who arrive late or absent  themselves altogether.    \"6th. Should any quarrel or cause of complaint arise, the  Vice-Capellmeister shall endeavour to arrange it, in order that his  Serene Highness may not be incommoded with trifling disputes; but should  any more serious difficulty occur, which the said Joseph Heyden is  unable to set right, his Serene Highness must then be respectfully  called upon to decide the matter.    \"7th. The said Vice-Capellmeister shall take careful charge of all music  and musical instruments, and shall be responsible for any injury that  may occur to them from carelessness or neglect.    \"8th. The said Joseph Heyden shall be obliged to instruct the female  vocalists, in order that they may not forget in the country what they  had been taught with much trouble and expense in Vienna, and, as the  said Vice-Capellmeister is proficient on various instruments, he shall  take care to practice himself on all that he is acquainted with.    \"9th. A copy of this agreement and instructions shall be given to the  said Vice-Capellmeister and to his subordinates, in order that he may be  able to hold them to their obligations therein laid down.    \"10th. It is considered unnecessary to detail the services required of  the said Joseph Heyden more particularly, since his Serene Highness is  pleased to hope that he will of his own free will strictly observe not  only these regulations, but all others that may from time to time be  made by his Highness, and that he will place the orchestra on such a  footing, and in such good order, that he may bring honour upon himself,  and deserve the further favour of the Prince, his master, who thus  confides in his zeal and discretion.    \"11th. A salary of four hundred florins to be received quarterly is  hereby bestowed upon the said Vice-Capellmeister by his Serene Highness.    \"12th. In addition, the said Joseph Heyden shall have board at the  officers' table, or half a gulden a day in lieu thereof.    \"13th. Finally, this agreement shall hold good for at least three years  from May 1st, 1761, with the further condition that if at the conclusion  "]]]
