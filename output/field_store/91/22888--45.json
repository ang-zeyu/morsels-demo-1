B, 17) is a curious genus of coal-black  bees, whose females have bright yellow pollen brushes on their hind legs;  they visit yellow composite flowers and the males often sleep curled up  amongst their rays; they are most active bees, and burrow generally in hard  pathways. I was watching a large colony of one of the species near Chobham  in the end of June--they were burrowing in a gravel path, under which the  soil was of a black sandy nature; the path was scattered all over with  little black {50} hillocks of sand, and seemed alive with bees. It was  showery weather, and occasionally the hillocks were washed nearly flat and  a lot of sand must have entered their burrows--however, as soon as the sun  came out again they cleaned out their holes and returned to their work.  _Panurgus_ is most businesslike in its pollen collecting; it flies in a  rapid headlong way into a flower, and seems to do its best to bury itself,  with a remarkable amount of action as if it was in a great hurry, and often  bustles out of it again almost immediately and goes on to the next. Its  methods suggest that it does more work in five minutes than any other bee  would do in ten.    Another genus, _Anthidium_ (pl. D, 27), this time one of the long-tongued  bees, is peculiar in having the male larger than the female. Both sexes are  black, variegated with yellow markings and spots, but the male is more  ornate in this respect than the female and also has a peculiarly shaped  body, which is unusually flat, curving downwards towards the apex, which is  armed with five teeth, two bent ones on the sixth segment and three on the  seventh. The female collects pollen on the underside of its body and  collects the {51} down off the stems of various plants, especially those of  the dead nettle or \"labiate\" tribe, with which it invests its cells. I  cannot do better than quote the following from F. Smith: \"This is the  social bee which White in his History of Selbourne has so well described in  the following words: 'There is a sort of wild bee frequenting the Garden  Campion for the sake of its tomentum, which probably it turns to some  purpose in the business of nidification. It is very pleasant to see with  what address it strips off the pubes running from the top to the bottom of  a branch and shaving it bare with the dexterity of a hoop shaver; when it  has got a vast bundle, almost as large as itself, it flies away, holding it  secure between its chin and fore legs.'\"           *       *       *       *       *    {52}    LEAF-CUTTING BEES    [Illustration: FIG. 7.]    These are amongst the specially interesting of the bees in their habits.  They are dull-brown coloured creatures rather like a stout hive bee in form  (pl. C, 20). They all collect pollen on the underside of their body. They  burrow either in decayed wood or in the ground, but they make their cells  of pieces of leaves which they cut off from rose bushes or other plants;  these cells when completed are wonderful works of art. Probably some of my  readers may have noticed rose leaves with semicircular pieces cut out of  them, and often with almost circular ones; this is the work of the leaf  cutter (fig. 7).    [Illustration: PLATE C.    20. _Megachile maritima_, _female_. 21. _Coelioxys conoidea_, _male_. 22.  _Coelioxys conoidea_, _female_. 23. _Nest of Megachile willughbiella._    [_face p. 52._ ]    {53} She alights on a leaf, holds on to the edge of the piece she wants to  cut off with her legs, and then cuts it out by means of her jaws, or  mandibles; as soon as it is cut free she uses her wings and so prevents  herself from falling, and goes off with the cut off piece safely held under  her body by her legs. I have frequently seen bees flying home with their  leafy burden, and once or twice I have seen them cutting the pieces out.  They cut round the piece they select with great rapidity--the marvel is  that they can arrange so exactly as not to fall when the last attachment is  removed. The pieces they cut have to be of several shapes in order to build  up the cell they require; some are more or less lozenge shaped, some almost  circular; the cells they make are somewhat thimble-shaped. The  lozenge-shaped pieces are used to build up the sides and lower end of the  cell, and the circular pieces to close it in with at the top; it is all  cemented together with a gluey substance excreted by the bee. The burrows  of the leaf-cutters are made, as stated above, either in the ground or in  rotten wood. I have never had a subterranean nest to examine, but have had  several nests in rotten wood under my notice, one of which is now before me  (pl. C, 23). It is in a piece of very {54} soft willow, almost in a  touchwood condition. So that by carefully cutting away the wood I have been  able to expose the whole series of cells. Two distinct burrows run almost  parallel to each other; both of them are slightly curved and each has  contained six cells; these are about half an inch long, and they fit one  over another in the tube as closely as possible so as to look like two long  thick green worms. Each cell is composed of many pieces of leaf, and the  final plug which closes the cell is often made of several rounds of leaf  one over the other. The amount of labour taken by the mother bee to make  these cells must be enormous. The cells are provisioned like those of any  other solitary bee with pollen, etc., and the egg is laid upon it. Most of  the leaf-cutters have their attendant cuckoos, which are rather smaller  than themselves, of a deep black with white bands on the sides of the body.  The female has a very pointed tail, and the male's body ends in a series of  spine-like projections (pl. C, 21, 22).           *       *       *       *       *    {55}    OSMIA AND ITS HABITS    I have tried as much as possible to avoid scientific names, but the  misfortune is that there are hardly any popular names in use which can be  attached for certain to any particular species, and unless this can be done  it is of no use using vague names like the \"Carpenter Bee\", the \"Mason  Bee\", etc. There are many carpenter bees and many mason bees, and though  their habits may be alike in this one particular they differ among  themselves in the way they use their tools, and it is necessary to know  which one we are talking about. It is a common thing to hear people  inveighing against Latin names, etc., but they forget that there are no  English ones in use, and what is more important, that Greek and Latin names  are common property to all nations, so that we can all know what we are  talking about, whereas if we call an insect by an English name and the  Russians {56} call it by a Russian name, the difficulty of coming to a  mutual understanding is very great. This is only an aside to justify the  use of classical names. I quite feel that for popular use in this country a  good series of English names might be useful, but we have not got one, and  it would require a great deal of care and thought to frame a nomenclature  which would really be useable by the persons who require it.    I have made these remarks here because _Osmia_ is a genus whose members  vary very much in their habits, and some species of which, like sensible  beings, adapt their habits to their surroundings, so that no name such as  carpenter bee, etc., would apply to all the species, or, as a rule, even to  one. _Osmia rufa_ especially adopts several methods of nesting. This little  bee is clothed more or less all over with yellowish hairs; it is compact in  shape like all the other species of _Osmia_, and like them collects its  pollen on the underside of the body. It may sometimes be seen flying up and  down the walls of a house looking for a crevice to build in, but it is not  the least particular as to where to form its cells. In one memorable case  the female selected a flute {57} which had been left in a garden-arbour.  The bee constructed fourteen cells in the tube of the instrument,  commencing its first cell a quarter of an inch below the mouthhole. The  flute is preserved in the Natural History Museum at South Kensington. At  other times this species burrows in the ground, at others it makes its  cells in crevices of old walls; it has been known to build in a lock, and  is said sometimes to inhabit snail shells. Other species of _Osmia_ almost  always burrow in banks, but in no case does a habit seem to be uniformly  adopted by a species. One well known and rare species, _Osmia leucomelana_,  is a regular bramble-stick species, tunnelling down the pith in the centre  of the stalks, but I once found it to my surprise in fair numbers nesting  in a sandy bank. Other species again, as a rule, select snail shells to  build in; they find an old disused shell lying about in some sheltered  place and adapt it to their purposes, commencing their cells singly in the  narrow whorls of the shell and side by side as they approach its mouth,  i.e. if the shell be a wide-mouthed one like the common garden snail  (_Helix aspersa_). F. Smith, who gives a very interesting account of these  {58} creatures in his _Catalogue of British Hymenoptera in the British  Museum_, mentions a case where the bee finding the larger whorls of the  shell too wide constructed two cells across the whorl. Another very  interesting case given by Smith is of a nest of many cells of the rare  _Osmia inermis_ (which in his days was known as _Osmia parietina_). A slab  of stone, 10 inches by 6, was brought to him with 230 cocoons of this  _Osmia_ attached to its under side; when found in the month of November,  1849, about a third of them were empty; in March of the following year a  few males made their appearance and shortly afterwards a few females, and  they continued to come out at "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33914"],[0,"Myology and Serology of the Avian Family Fringillidae: A Taxonomic Study (#7)"],[1,"  The division of the _pars interna_ of the _m. gastrocnemius_ into  anterior and posterior parts has not been reported by previous authors  yet the division is quite distinct in those birds in which it occurs.  Hudson (1937:36) points out that in some non-passerine birds the _pars  interna_ is double, but that in these species the _m. semimembranosus_  inserts between the two parts. This is not the condition in those  species studied by me. Only the ploceids and the cardueline finches in  the present investigation fail to show such a division. The undivided  muscle in these birds resembles, in its origin and position, the  posterior portion of the muscle found in those species showing the  bipartite condition. The greater mass of the bipartite muscle probably  makes possible a stronger extension of the tarsometatarsus.    Thus, the divided or undivided conditions of the _m. obturator  externus_ and the _pars interna_ of the _m. gastrocnemius_ seem to be  correlated with the degrees of strength of certain movements of the  leg. It is conceivable that these differences in structure are  correlated with the manner in which food is obtained, the birds having  the bipartite muscles being those which spend the most time on the  ground searching and scratching for seeds and other sorts of food.  Yet, in _Leucosticte_, a cardueline, and in _Calcarius_, an  emberizine, whose foraging habits are rather similar, the structure is  unlike. _Leucosticte_ does resemble the emberizines and also _Piranga_  and _Spzia_ in the extension of a band of muscle fibers from the _pars  interna_ of the _m. gastrocnemius_ around the front of the knee. A  band of muscle fibers of this sort strengthens the knee joint and  gives still more strength to the _pars interna_. This condition has  been reported in a number of birds by Hudson (1937) and is, in all  probability, an adaptation for greater strength of certain leg  movements. The development of this band in _Leucosticte_ seems to  parallel that in the other birds studied and does not indicate  relationship, since in _Leucosticte_ this band arises from the  undivided muscle which (as stated above) resembles only the posterior  portion of the bipartite muscle described for the other birds. In the  latter, the muscular band arises from the anterior part of the muscle.    Minor differences in muscle pattern, like those already mentioned, are  consistent also between subfamilies, but correlation of these minor  differences with function is difficult. There is the implication,  however, that in all the groups except the carduelines and ploceids,  the emphasis is on greater strength and mobility of the leg. In the  carduelines that were studied the origin of the _m. sartorius_ does  not extend so far craniad as in the other species. In the latter, at  least half of the origin is from the last one or two free dorsal  vertebrae; in the carduelines no more than one third of the origin is  anterior to the ilium. It is conceivable that the more craniad the  origin, the stronger the forward movement of the thigh would be.    In _Passer_, _Estrilda_ and _Poephila_, and in all the cardueline  finches examined, the bellies of the _m. flexor perforans et  perforatus digiti II_ and the _m. flexor perforans et perforatus  digiti III_ are more intimately connected than they are in the other  species studied. Thus, the amount of independent action of these  muscles in _Passer_, in the estrildines, and in the carduelines  probably is reduced.    In _Passer_, the estrildines, and the carduelines the edges of the  sheathlike tendon of insertion of the _m. perforatus digiti III_ are  thickened; as a result the insertion appears superficially to be  double but closer examination reveals that there is a fascia stretched  between the thickened edges. In the other species examined, the  insertion is sheathlike throughout and there are no thick areas. I  cannot explain this on the basis of function. The difference, however,  is obvious and constant.    Aside from the differences noted above, there were variations of  muscle pattern that seem to be significant only in _Vireo olivaceus_.  In this species the central, aponeurotic portion of the _m.  iliotibialis_ is absent. The origin of the _m. adductor longus et  brevis_ is from the dorsal edge of the ischiopubic fenestra and not  from the membrane covering this fenestra. The origin of the _pars  posticus_ of this muscle, furthermore, is fleshy and not tendinous as  it is in the other species. The _m. flexor perforatus digiti II_ is  larger and more deeply situated in _Vireo_ and has, furthermore, no  connection with the _m. flexor hallucis longus_. The latter muscle is  smaller and weaker than in any of the other species and has only one  (the posterior) head of origin. The _m. flexor hallucis brevis_, on  the contrary, is larger than in the other birds, compensating,  probably, for the small _m. flexor hallucis longus_. In those  differences, however, which separate the carduelines and ploceids from  the other birds studied, _Vireo_ resembles, in every instance, the  richmondenines, emberizines, tanagers, warblers, and blackbirds.    On the basis of differences in leg-musculature the species which are  now included in the Family Fringillidae may be separated into two  groups. One group includes the richmondenines and the emberizines; the  other, the carduelines. The muscle patterns of the legs of the birds  of the first group are indistinguishable from those of _Seiurus_,  _Icterus_, _Molothrus_, and _Piranga_, and except for the differences  noted are similar to those in _Vireo_. The carduelines, on the other  hand, are similar in every point of leg-musculature to the ploceids  which were studied. Thus, the heterogeneity of the Family  Fringillidae, as now recognized, is emphasized by differences in the  muscle patterns of the leg.          COMPARATIVE SEROLOGY      General Statement    The application of serological techniques to the problems of animal  relationships has been attempted with varying degrees of success over  a period of approximately fifty years. Few of the earlier studies were  of a quantitative nature, but within the past decade, satisfactory  quantitative serological techniques have been developed whereby  taxonomic relationships may be estimated. The usefulness of  comparative serology in taxonomy has been demonstrated in  investigations of many groups wherein results obtained have, in most  instances, been compatible with the results obtained by more  conventional methods, such as comparative morphology. As Boyden  (1942:141) stated, \"comparative serology ... is no simple guide to  animal relationship.\" However, the objectiveness of its methods, the  fact that it has its basis in the comparisons of biochemical systems  which seem to be relatively slow to change in response to external  environmental influences, and the fact that the results are of  quantitative nature favor, where possible, the inclusion of data from  comparative serology along with that from more conventional sources  when an attempt is made to determine the relationships of groups of  animals.    The application of serological methods in ornithology has not been  extensive. Irwin and Cole (1936) and Cumley and Irwin (1941, 1944)  used two species of doves and their hybrids and demonstrated that a  distinction between the red cells of these birds could be made by use  of immunological methods involving the agglutinin reaction. McGibbon  (1945) was able to distinguish the red cells of interspecific hybrids  in ducks by similar methods. Irwin (1953) used similar techniques in  his study of the evolutionary patterns of some antigenic substances of  the blood cells of birds of the Family Columbidae. Sasaki (1928)  demonstrated the usefulness of the precipitin technique in  distinguishing species of ducks and their hybrids. This technique  was used successfully also by DeFalco (1942) and by Martin and  Leone (1952). Working with groups of known relationships, these  investigators showed that the \"accepted\" systematic positions of  certain birds were confirmed by serological procedures. The precipitin  reaction, however, has never been applied to actual problems in avian  taxonomy prior to the present study.      Preparation of Antigens    Although most previous work in comparative serology in which  precipitin tests were used has involved the use of whole sera as  antigens, Martin and Leone (1952) indicated that tissue extracts are  satisfactory as antigens and that serological differentiation can be  obtained with these extracts and the antisera to them. I decided,  therefore, to use such extracts in these investigations, since the  small sizes of the birds to be tested made it impracticable to obtain  enough whole sera.    Most of the birds used were obtained by shooting, but a few were  trapped and the exotic species were purchased alive from a pet dealer.  When a bird was killed, the entire digestive tract was carefully  removed to prevent the escape of digestive enzymes into the tissues  and to prevent putrefaction by action of intestinal bacteria. As soon  as possible (and within three hours in every instance) the bird was  skinned, the head, wings, and legs were removed, and the body was  frozen. Each specimen, consisting of trunk, heart, lungs, and kidneys,  was wrapped separately and carefully in aluminum foil to prevent  dehydration of the tissues. The specimens were kept frozen until the  time when the extracts were made.    When an extract was to be prepared, the specimen was allowed to thaw  but not to become warm. In the cold room with the temperature of all  equipment and reagents at 2 deg.C., the specimen was placed in a Waring  blender with 0.9 per cent aqueous solution of NaCl buffered with M/150  K_{2}HPO_{4} and M/150 Na_{2}HPO_{4} to a pH of 7.0. The amount of  reagent used was 75 ml. of saline for each gram of tissue to be  extracted. The tissues were"]]]
