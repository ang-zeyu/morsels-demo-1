Mix all as  quick as possible, put it into very small pattipans, and bake in a  tolerable warm oven, under twenty minutes. Or blanch and pound four  ounces of almonds, with a little orange-flower or rose-water; then stir  in the yolks of six and the whites of three eggs well beaten, five  ounces of butter warmed, the peel of a lemon grated, and a little of the  juice, sweetened with fine moist sugar. When well mixed, bake in a  delicate paste, in small pans. Another way is, to press the whey from as  much curd as will make two dozen small cheesecakes. Then put the curd on  the back of a sieve, and with half an ounce of butter rub it through  with the back of a spoon; put to it six yolks and three whites of eggs,  and a few bitter almonds pounded, with as much sugar as will sweeten the  curd. Mix with it the grated rind of a lemon, and a glass of brandy; put  a puff-paste into the pans, and ten minutes will bake them.      ALMOND CREAM. Beat in a mortar four ounces of sweet almonds, and a few  bitter ones, with a tea-spoonful of water to prevent oiling, both having  first been blanched. Put the paste to a quart of cream, and add the  juice of three lemons sweetened; beat it with a whisk to a froth, which  take off on the shallow part of a sieve, and fill the glasses with some  of the liquor and the froth.      ALMOND CUSTARD. Blanch and beat four ounces of almonds fine, with a  spoonful of water. Beat a pint of cream with two spoonfuls of  rose-water, put them to the yolks of four eggs, and as much sugar as  will make it tolerably sweet. Then add the almonds, stir it all over a  slow fire till of a proper thickness, without boiling, and pour it into  cups.      ALMOND JUMBLES. Rub half a pound of butter into a pound of flour, with  half a pound of loaf sugar powdered, a quarter of a pound of almonds  beat fine with rose-water, the yolks of two eggs, and two spoonfuls of  cream. Make them all into a paste, roll it into any shape, and bake on  tins. Ice them with a mixture of fine sugar, rose-water, and the white  of an egg, beat up together, and lay the icing on with a feather, before  the jumbles are put into the oven.      ALMOND PUDDINGS. Beat half a pound of sweet and a few bitter almonds  with a spoonful of water; then mix four ounces of butter, four eggs, two  spoonfuls of cream, warm with the butter, one of brandy, a little nutmeg  and sugar to taste. Butter some cups, half fill them, and bake the  puddings. Serve with butter, wine, and sugar.--For baked almond  puddings, beat a quarter of a pound of sweet and a few bitter almonds  with a little wine, the yolks of six eggs, the peel of two lemons  grated, six ounces of butter, nearly a quart of cream, and the juice of  one lemon. When well mixed, bake it half an hour, with paste round the  dish, and serve it with pudding sauce. Small almond puddings are made of  eight ounces of almonds, and a few bitter ones, pounded with a spoonful  of water. Then mix four ounces of butter warmed, four yolks and two  whites of eggs, sugar to taste, two spoonfuls of cream, and one of  brandy. Mix it together well, and bake in little cups buttered.      ALMONDS BURNT. Add three quarters of a pound of loaf sugar to a pound of  almonds, picked and cleaned, and a few spoonfuls of water. Set them on  the fire, keep them stirring till the sugar is candied, and they are  done.      ALMONDS ICED. Make an iceing similar to that for twelfth-night cakes,  with fine sifted loaf sugar, orange-flower water, and whisked white of  eggs. Having blanched the almonds, roll them well in this iceing, and  dry them in a cool oven.      AMBER PUDDING. Put a pound of butter into a saucepan, with three  quarters of a pound of loaf sugar finely powdered. Melt the butter, and  mix well with it; then add the yolks of fifteen eggs well beaten, and as  much fresh candied orange as will add colour and flavour to it, being  first beaten to a fine paste. Line the dish with paste for turning out;  and when filled with the above, lay a crust over as you would a pie, and  bake it in a slow oven. This makes a fine pudding as good cold as hot.      AMERICAN CAKES, though but little known in this country, form an article  of some importance in domestic economy: they are cheap, easily made, and  very nutritious. Mix a quarter of a pound of butter with a pound of  flour; then, having dissolved and well stirred a quarter of a pound of  sugar in half a pint of milk, and made a solution of about half a  tea-spoonful of crystal of soda, salt of tartar, or any other purified  potash, in half a tea-cupful of cold water, pour them also among the  flour; work up the paste to a good consistence, roll it out, and form it  into cakes or biscuits. The lightness of these cakes depending much on  the expedition with which they are baked, they should be set in a brisk  oven.      AMERICAN SPRUCE. In the spring of the year, this valuable extract is  obtained from the young shoots and tops of the pine or fir trees; and in  autumn, from their cones. These are merely boiled in water, to the  consistence of honey or molasses. The bark and softer part of the tops  and young shoots, being easily dissolved, make the finest essence; while  the cones and bark of larger branches, undergoing only a partial  solution, form an inferior article, after being strained from the dregs.  Both sorts, when decanted clear off, are put up in casks or bottles, and  preserved for making spruce beer.      ANCHOVIES. These delicate fish are preserved in barrels with bay salt,  and no other of the finny tribe has so fine a flavour. Choose those  which look red and mellow, and the bones moist and oily. They should be  high-flavoured, and have a fine smell; but beware of their being mixed  with red paint, to improve their colour and appearance. When the liquor  dries, pour on them some beef brine, and keep the jar close tied down  with paper and leather. Sprats are sometimes sold for anchovies, but by  washing them the imposition may be detected. See SPRATS.      ANCHOVY ESSENCE. Chop two dozen of anchovies, without the bone, add some  of their own liquor strained, and sixteen large spoonfuls of water. Boil  them gently till dissolved, which will be in a few minutes; and when  cold, strain and bottle the liquor. The essence can generally be bought  cheaper than you can make it.      ANCHOVY PASTE. Pound them in a mortar, rub the pulp through a fine  sieve, pot it, cover it with clarified butter, and keep it in a cool  place. The paste may also be made by rubbing the essence with as much  flour as will make a paste; but this is only intended for immediate use,  and will not keep. This is sometimes made stiffer and hotter, by the  addition of a little flour of mustard, a pickled walnut, spice, or  cayenne.      ANCHOVY POWDER. Pound the fish in a mortar, rub them through a sieve,  make them into a paste with dried flour, roll it into thin cakes, and  dry them in a Dutch oven before a slow fire. To this may be added a  small portion of cayenne, grated lemon peel, and citric acid. Pounded to  a fine powder, and put into a well-stopped bottle, it will keep for  years. It is a very savoury relish, sprinkled on bread and butter for a  sandwich.      ANCHOVY SAUCE. Chop one or two anchovies without washing, put them into  a saucepan with flour and butter, and a spoonful of water. Stir it over  the fire till it boils once or twice. When the anchovies are good, they  will soon be dissolved, and distinguished both by their colour and  fragrance.      ANCHOVY TOAST. Bone and skin six or eight anchovies, pound them to a  mass with an ounce of fine butter till the colour is equal, and then  spread it on toast or rusks. Or, cut thin slices of bread, and fry them  in clarified butter. Wash three anchovies split, pound them in a mortar  with a little fresh butter, rub them through a hair sieve, and spread on  the toast when cold. Garnish with parsley or pickles.      ANGELICA TARTS. Take an equal quantity of apples and angelica, pare and  peel them, and cut them separately into small pieces. Boil the apples  gently in a little water, with fine sugar and lemon peel, till they  become a thin syrup: then boil the angelica about ten minutes. Put some  paste at the bottom of the pattipans, with alternate layers of apples  and angelica: pour in some of the syrup, put on the lid, and bake them  carefully.      ANGLING APPARATUS. Fishing rods should be oiled and dried in the sun, to  prevent their being worm eaten, and render them tough; and if the joints  get swelled and set fast, turn the part over the flame of a candle, and  it will soon be set at liberty. Silk or hemp lines dyed in a decoction  of oak bark, will render them more durable and capable of resisting the  wet; and after they have been used they should be well dried before they  are wound up, or they will be liable to rot. To make a cork float, take  a good new cork, and pass a small red-hot iron through the centre of it  lengthways; then round one end of it with a sharp knife, and reduce the  other to a point, resembling a small peg top. The quill which is to pass  through it may be secured at the bottom by putting in a little cotton  wool and sealing wax, and the upper end is to be fitted with a piece of  hazel like a plug, cemented like the other, with a piece of wire on the  top formed into an eye, and two small hoops cut from another quill to  regulate the line which passes through the float. To render it the more  visible, the cork may be coloured with red wax. For fly fishing, either  natural or artificial flies may be used, especially such as are found  under hollow stones by the river's side, on the trunk of an oak or ash,  on hawthorns, and on ant hills. In clear water the angler may use small  flies with slender wings, but in muddy water a large fly is better: in a  clear day the fly should be light coloured, and in dark water the fly  should be dark.

Many plants have a marked umbo on the  top of the cap and the rim of the cap may be slightly turned up.    The gills are always white, wide, ventricose, rounded next to the stem,  and free from it.    The stem is smooth, white unless in cases where the cap is dark, then  the stem of those plants are apt to be of the same color, tapering  upward as in the specimen (Fig. 11); stuffed, then hollow, inclined to  discolor when handled.    The volva of this species is quite variable and more or less buried in  the ground, where careful observation will reveal it.    One need never confound this species with the meadow mushroom, for the  spores of that are always purple-brown, while a spore-print of this will  always reveal white spores. I have seen a slight tint of pink in the  gills of the A. phalloides but the spores were always white. Until one  knows thoroughly both Lepiota naucina and A. phalloides before eating  the former he should always hunt carefully for the remains of a volva  and a bulbous base in the soil.    This plant is quite conspicuous and inviting in all of its various  shades of color. It is found in woods, and along the margin of woods,  and sometimes on lawns. It is from four to eight inches high and the  pileus from three to five inches broad. There is a personality about the  plant that renders it readily recognizable after it has once been  learned. Found from August to October.      _Amanita recutita. Fr._    THE FRESH-SKINNED AMANITA. POISONOUS.    Recutita, having a fresh or new skin. Pileus convex, then expanded, dry,  smooth, often covered with small scales, fragments of the volva; margin  almost even, gray or brownish.    The gills forming lines down the stem.    The stem stuffed, then hollow, attenuated upward, silky, white, ring  distant, edge of volva not free, frequently obliterated.    Rather common where there is much pine woods. August to October.    This species differs from A. porphyria in ring not being brown or  brownish.      _Amanita virosa. Fr._    THE POISONOUS AMANITA.    Virosa, full of poison. The pileus is from four to five inches broad;  the entire plant white, conical, then expanded; viscid when moist;  margin often somewhat lobed, even.    The gills are free, crowded.    The stem is frequently six inches long, stuffed, round, with a bulbous  base, attenuated upward, squamulose, ring near apex, volva large, lax.    The spores are subglobose, 8-10u. This is probably simply a form of A.  phalloides. It is found in damp woods. August to October.      _Amanita muscaria. Linn._    THE FLY AMANITA. POISONOUS.    [Illustration: Figure 13.--Amanita muscaria.--_Linn._ Cap reddish or  orange, showing scales on the cap and at base of stem.]    Muscaria, from musca, a fly. The fly Amanita is a very conspicuous and  handsome plant. It is so called because infusions of it are used to kill  flies. I have frequently seen dead flies on the fully developed caps,  where they had sipped of the dew upon the cap, and, like the  Lotos-eaters of old, had forgotten to move away. It is a very abundant  plant in the woods of Columbiana county, this state. It is also found  frequently in many localities about Chillicothe. It is often a very  handsome and attractive plant, because of the bright colors of the cap  in contrast with the white stem and gills, as well as the white scales  on the surface of the cap. These scales seem to behave somewhat  differently from those of other species of Amanita. Instead of  shrivelling, curling, and falling off they are inclined to adhere firmly  to the smooth skin of the pileus, turning brownish, and in the maturely  expanded plant appear like scattered drops of mud which have dried upon  the pileus, as you will observe in Figure 13.    The pileus is three to five inches broad, globose at first, then  dumb-bell in shape, convex, then expanded, nearly flat in age; margin in  matured plants slightly striate; the surface of the cap is covered with  white floccose scales, fragments of the volva, these scales being easily  removed so that old plants are frequently comparatively smooth. The  color of the young plant is normally red, then orange to pale yellow;  late in the season, or in old plants, it fades to almost white. The  flesh is white, sometimes stained yellow close to the cuticle.    The gills are pure white, very symmetrical, various in length, the  shorter ones terminating under the cap very abruptly, crowded, free, but  reaching the stem, decurrent in the form of lines somewhat broader in  front, sometimes a slight tinge of yellow will be observed in the gills.    The stem is white, often yellowish with age, pithy and often hollow,  becoming rough and shaggy, finally scaly, the scales below appearing to  merge into the form of an obscure cup, the stem four to six inches long.    The veil covers the gills of the young plant and later is seen as a  collar-like ring on the stem, soft, lax, deflexed, in old specimens it  is often destroyed. The spores are white and broadly elliptical.    The history of this plant is as interesting as a novel. Its deadly  properties were known to the Greeks and Romans. The pages of history  record its undoing and its accessory to crime. Pliny says, alluding to  this species, \"very conveniently adapted for poisoning.\" This was  undoubtedly the species that Agrippina, the mother of Nero, used to  poison her husband, the Emperor Claudius; and the same that Nero used in  that famous banquet when all his guests, his tribunes and centurions,  and Agrippina herself, fell victims to its poisonous properties.    However, it is said this mushroom is habitually eaten by certain people  as an intoxicant; indeed, it is used in Kamchatka and Asiatic Russia,  generally, where the Amanita drunkard takes the place of the opium fiend  and the alcohol bibber in other countries. By reading Colonel George  Kennan in his \"Tent-life in Siberia,\" and Cooke's \"Seven Sisters of  Sleep,\" you will find a full description of the toxic employment of this  fungus which will far surpass any possible imagination.    It caused the death of the Czar Alexis of Russia; also Count de Vecchi,  with a number of his friends, in Washington in 1896. He was in search of  the Orange Amanita and found this, and the consequences were serious.    In size, shape, and color of the cap there is similarity, but in other  respects the two are very different. They may be contrasted as follows:    Orange Amanita, edible.--Cap _smooth_, gills _yellow_, stem _yellow_,  wrapper _persistent_, _membranaceous_, _white_.    Fly Amanita, poisonous.--Cap _warty_, gills _white_, stem _white_, or  slightly _yellowish_, wrapper _soon breaking_ into _fragments or  scales_, white or sometimes yellowish brown.    Found along roadsides, wood margins, and in thin woods. It prefers poor  soil, and is more abundant where poplar and hemlock grow. From June to  frost.    [Illustration: Figure 14.--Amanita muscaria.--_Linn._ One-half natural  size, showing development of the plant.]      _Amanita Frostiana. Pk._    FROST'S AMANITA. POISONOUS.    [Illustration: _Photo by C. G. Lloyd._    Figure 15.--Amanita Frostiana.]    Frostiana, named in honor of Charles C. Frost.    The pileus is convex, expanded, bright orange or yellow, warty,  sometimes smooth, striate on the margin, pileus one to three inches  broad.    The gills are free, white, or slightly tinged with yellow.    The stem is white or yellow, stuffed, bearing a slight, sometimes  evanescent, ring, bulbous, at the base, the bulb slightly margined by  the volva. The spores globose, 8-10u in diameter. _Peck._    Great care should be taken to distinguish this species from A. caesarea  because of its often yellow stem and gills. I found some beautiful  specimens on Cemetery Hill and on Ralston's Run. It is very poisonous  and should be carefully avoided, or rather, it should be thoroughly  known that it may be avoided. The striations on the margin of its yellow  tinge might lead one to mistake it for the Orange Amanita. It is found  in shady woods and sometimes in open places where there is underbrush.  June to October.      _Amanita verna. Bull._    THE SPRING AMANITA. POISONOUS.    [Illustration: Figure 16.--Amanita verna. Two-thirds natural size,  showing the volva cup and the ring.]    Verna, pertaining to spring. This species is considered by some only a  white variety of Amanita phalloides. The plant is always a pure white.  It can only be distinguished from the white form of the A. phalloides by  its closer sheathing volva and perhaps a more ovate pileus when young.    The pileus is at first ovate, then expanded, somewhat depressed, viscid  when moist, even, margin naked, smooth. The gills are free.    The stem is stuffed, with advancing age hollow, equal, floccose, white,  ringed, base bulbous, volva closely embracing the stem with its free  margin, ring forming a broad collar, reflexed. The spores are globose,  8u broad.    This species is very abundant on the wooded hills in this section of the  state. Its pure white color makes it an attractive plant, and it should  be carefully learned. I have found it before the middle of June.      _Amanita magnivelaris. Pk._    THE LARGE VEILED AMANITA. POISONOUS.    Magnivelaris is from _magnus_, large; _velum_, a veil.    The pileus is convex, often nearly plane, with even margin, smooth,  slightly viscid when moist, white or yellowish-white.    The gills are free, close, white.    The stem is long, nearly equal, white, smooth, furnished with a large  mebranaceous volva, the bulbous base tapering downward and rooting. The  spores are broadly elliptical.    This species very closely resembles Amanita verna, from which it can be  distinguished by its large, persistent annulus, the elongated  downward-tapering bulb of its stem, and, especially, by its elliptical  spores.    It is found solitary and in the woods. I found several on Ralston's Run  under beech trees. Found"]]]
