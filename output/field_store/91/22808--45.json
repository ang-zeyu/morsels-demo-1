Islamic republic - a particular form of government adopted by some  Muslim states; although such a state is, in theory, a theocracy, it  remains a republic, but its laws are required to be compatible with the  laws of Islam.    Maoism - the theory and practice of Marxism-Leninism developed in China  by Mao Zedong (Mao Tse-tung), which states that a continuous revolution  is necessary if the leaders of a communist state are to keep in touch  with the people.    Marxism - the political, economic, and social principles espoused by  19th century economist Karl Marx; he viewed the struggle of workers as  a progression of historical forces that would proceed from a class  struggle of the proletariat (workers) exploited by capitalists  (business owners), to a socialist \"dictatorship of the proletariat,\"  to, finally, a classless society - Communism.    Marxism-Leninism - an expanded form of communism developed by Lenin  from doctrines of Karl Marx; Lenin saw imperialism as the final stage  of capitalism and shifted the focus of workers' struggle from developed  to underdeveloped countries.    Monarchy - a government in which the supreme power is lodged in the  hands of a monarch who reigns over a state or territory, usually for  life and by hereditary right; the monarch may be either a sole absolute  ruler or a sovereign - such as a king, queen, or prince - with  constitutionally limited authority.    Oligarchy - a government in which control is exercised by a small group  of individuals whose authority generally is based on wealth or power.    Parliamentary democracy - a political system in which the legislature  (parliament) selects the government - a prime minister, premier, or  chancellor along with the cabinet ministers - according to party  strength as expressed in elections; by this system, the government  acquires a dual responsibility: to the people as well as to the  parliament.    Parliamentary government (Cabinet-Parliamentary government) - a  government in which members of an executive branch (the cabinet and its  leader - a prime minister, premier, or chancellor) are nominated to  their positions by a legislature or parliament, and are directly  responsible to it; this type of government can be dissolved at will by  the parliament (legislature) by means of a no confidence vote or the  leader of the cabinet may dissolve the parliament if it can no longer  function.    Parliamentary monarchy - a state headed by a monarch who is not  actively involved in policy formation or implementation (i.e., the  exercise of sovereign powers by a monarch in a ceremonial capacity);  true governmental leadership is carried out by a cabinet and its head -  a prime minister, premier, or chancellor - who are drawn from a  legislature (parliament).    Presidential - a system of government where the executive branch exists  separately from a legislature (to which it is generally not  accountable).    Republic - a representative democracy in which the people's elected  deputies (representatives), not the people themselves, vote on  legislation.    Socialism - a government in which the means of planning, producing, and  distributing goods is controlled by a central government that  theoretically seeks a more just and equitable distribution of property  and labor; in actuality, most socialist governments have ended up being  no more than dictatorships over workers by a ruling elite.    Sultanate - similar to a monarchy, but a government in which the  supreme power is in the hands of a sultan (the head of a Muslim state);  the sultan may be an absolute ruler or a sovereign with  constitutionally limited authority.    Theocracy - a form of government in which a Deity is recognized as the  supreme civil ruler, but the Deity's laws are interpreted by  ecclesiastical authorities (bishops, mullahs, etc.); a government  subject to religious authority.    Totalitarian - a government that seeks to subordinate the individual to  the state by controlling not only all political and economic matters,  but also the attitudes, values, and beliefs of its population.

Household income or consumption by percentage share:  Data on household  income or consumption come from household surveys, the results adjusted  for household size. Nations use different standards and procedures in  collecting and adjusting the data. Surveys based on income will  normally show a more unequal distribution than surveys based on  consumption. The quality of surveys is improving with time, yet caution  is still necessary in making inter-country comparisons.    Hydrographic data codes:  see Data codes    Illicit drugs:  This entry gives information on the five categories of  illicit drugs - narcotics, stimulants, depressants (sedatives),  hallucinogens, and cannabis. These categories include many drugs  legally produced and prescribed by doctors as well as those illegally  produced and sold outside of medical channels.    Cannabis (Cannabis sativa) is the common hemp plant, which provides  hallucinogens with some sedative properties, and includes marijuana  (pot, Acapulco gold, grass, reefer), tetrahydrocannabinol (THC,  Marinol), hashish (hash), and hashish oil (hash oil).    Coca (mostly Erythroxylum coca) is a bush with leaves that contain the  stimulant used to make cocaine. Coca is not to be confused with cocoa,  which comes from cacao seeds and is used in making chocolate, cocoa,  and cocoa butter.    Cocaine is a stimulant derived from the leaves of the coca bush.    Depressants (sedatives) are drugs that reduce tension and anxiety and  include chloral hydrate, barbiturates (Amytal, Nembutal, Seconal,  phenobarbital), benzodiazepines (Librium, Valium), methaqualone  (Quaalude), glutethimide (Doriden), and others (Equanil, Placidyl,  Valmid).    Drugs are any chemical substances that effect a physical, mental,  emotional, or behavioral change in an individual.    Drug abuse is the use of any licit or illicit chemical substance that  results in physical, mental, emotional, or behavioral impairment in an  individual.    Hallucinogens are drugs that affect sensation, thinking, self-  awareness, and emotion. Hallucinogens include LSD (acid, microdot),  mescaline and peyote (mexc, buttons, cactus), amphetamine variants  (PMA, STP, DOB), phencyclidine (PCP, angel dust, hog), phencyclidine  analogues (PCE, PCPy, TCP), and others (psilocybin, psilocyn).    Hashish is the resinous exudate of the cannabis or hemp plant (Cannabis  sativa).    Heroin is a semisynthetic derivative of morphine.    Mandrax is a trade name for methaqualone, a pharmaceutical depressant.    Marijuana is the dried leaf of the cannabis or hemp plant (Cannabis  sativa).    Methaqualone is a pharmaceutical depressant, referred to as mandrax in  Southwest Asia and Africa.    Narcotics are drugs that relieve pain, often induce sleep, and refer to  opium, opium derivatives, and synthetic substitutes. Natural narcotics  include opium (paregoric, parepectolin), morphine (MS-Contin, Roxanol),  codeine (Tylenol with codeine, Empirin with codeine, Robitussin AC),  and thebaine. Semisynthetic narcotics include heroin (horse, smack),  and hydromorphone (Dilaudid). Synthetic narcotics include meperidine or  Pethidine (Demerol, Mepergan), methadone (Dolophine, Methadose), and  others (Darvon, Lomotil).    Opium is the brown, gummy exudate of the incised, unripe seedpod of the  opium poppy.    Opium poppy (Papaver somniferum) is the source for the natural and  semisynthetic narcotics.    Poppy straw is the entire cut and dried opium poppy-plant material,  other than the seeds. Opium is extracted from poppy straw in commercial  operations that produce the drug for medical use.    Qat (kat, khat) is a stimulant from the buds or leaves of Catha edulis  that is chewed or drunk as tea.    Quaaludes is the North American slang term for methaqualone, a  pharmaceutical depressant.    Stimulants are drugs that relieve mild depression, increase energy and  activity, and include cocaine (coke, snow, crack), amphetamines  (Desoxyn, Dexedrine), ephedrine, ecstasy (clarity, essence, doctor,  Adam), phenmetrazine (Preludin), methylphenidate (Ritalin), and others  (Cylert, Sanorex, Tenuate).

Providence took me by the hand,       and--an oddity of dispensation which, I trust, there is no       irreverence in smiling at--has led me, as the newspapers       announce while I am writing, from the old Manse into a Custom       House! As a story-teller, I have often contrived strange       vicissitudes for my imaginary personages, but none like this.       The treasure of intellectual gold which I had hoped to find in       our secluded dwelling, had never come to light. No profound       treatise of ethics--no philosophic history--no novel, even,       that could stand unsupported on its edges--all that I had to       show, as a man of letters, were these few tales and essays,       which had blossomed out like flowers in the calm summer of my       heart and mind.\"    The _Mosses from an Old Manse_ he declared the last offering of their  kind he should ever put forth; \"unless I can do better,\" he wrote in  this Introduction, \"I have done enough in this kind.\" He went to his  place in the Custom House, in his native city, and if President Taylor's  advisers had not been apprehensive that in his devotion to ledgers he  would neglect the more important duties of literature, perhaps we should  have heard no more of him; but those patriotic men, remembering how much  they had enjoyed the reading of the _Twice-Told Tales_ and the _Mosses_,  induced the appointment in his place of a whig, who had no capacity for  making books, and in the spring of last year we had _The Scarlet  Letter_.    Like most of his shorter stories, The Scarlet Letter finds its scene and  time with the earlier Puritans. Its argument involves the analysis and  action of remorse in the heart of a person who, himself unsuspected, is  compelled to assist in the punishment of the partner of his guilt. This  peculiar and powerful fiction at once arrested attention, and claimed  for its author the eminence as a novelist which his previous  performances had secured for him as a writer of tales. Its whole  atmosphere and the qualities of its characters demanded for a creditable  success very unusual capacities. The frivolous costume and brisk action  of the story of fashionable life are easily depicted by the practised  sketcher, but a work like The Scarlet Letter comes slowly upon the  canvas, where passions are commingled and overlaid with the deliberate  and masterly elaboration with which the grandest effects are produced in  pictorial composition and coloring. It is a distinction of such works  that while they are acceptable to the many, they also surprise and  delight the few who appreciate the nicest arrangement and the most high  and careful finish. The Scarlet Letter will challenge consideration in  the name of Art, in the best audience which in any age receives  Cervantes, Le Sage, or Scott.    Following this romance came new editions of _True Stories from History  and Biography_, a volume for youthful readers, and of the _Twice-Told  Tales_. In the preface to the latter, underrating much the reputation he  has acquired by them, he says:         \"The author of _Twice-Told Tales_ has a claim to one       distinction, which, as none of his literary brethren will care       about disputing it with him, he need not be afraid to mention.       He was for a good many years the obscurest man of letters in       America. These stories were published in magazines and annuals,       extending over a period of ten or twelve years, and comprising       the whole of the writer's young manhood, without making (so far       as he has ever been aware) the slightest impression on the       public. One or two among them, the _Rill from the Town Pump_,       in perhaps a greater degree than any other, had a pretty wide       newspaper circulation; as for the rest, he has no grounds for       supposing that on their first appearance they met with the good       or evil fortune to be read by any body. Throughout the time       above specified he had no incitement to literary effort in a       reasonable prospect of reputation or profit; nothing but the       pleasure itself of composition--an enjoyment not at all amiss       in its way, and perhaps essential to the merit of the work in       hand, but which, in the long run, will hardly keep the chill       out of a writer's heart, or the numbness out of his fingers. To       this total lack of sympathy, at the age when his mind would       naturally have been most effervescent, the public owe it (and       it is certainly an effect not to be regretted, on either part),       that the author can show nothing for the thought and industry       of that portion of his life, save the forty sketches, or       thereabouts, included in these volumes. Much more, indeed, he       wrote; and some very small part of it might yet be rummaged out       (but it would not be worth the trouble) among the dingy pages       of fifteen or twenty year old periodicals, or within the shabby       morocco covers of faded Souvenirs. The remainder of the works       alluded to had a very brief existence, but, on the score of       brilliancy, enjoyed a fate vastly superior to that of their       brotherhood, which succeeded in getting through the press. In a       word, the author burned them without mercy or remorse, and,       moreover, without any subsequent regret, and had more than one       occasion to marvel that such very dull stuff as he knew his       condemned manuscripts to be, should yet have possessed       inflammability enough to set the chimney on fire!...         \"As he glances over these long-forgotten pages, and considers       his way of life while composing them, the author can very       clearly discern why all this was so. After so many sober years,       he would have reason to be ashamed if he could not criticise       his own work as fairly as another man's; and, though it is       little his business and perhaps still less his interest, he can       hardly resist a temptation to achieve something of the sort. If       writers were allowed to do so, and would perform the task with       perfect sincerity and unreserve, their opinions of their own       productions would often be more valuable and instructive than       the works themselves. At all events, there can be no harm in       the author's remarking that he rather wonders how the       _Twice-Told Tales_ should have gained what vogue they did, than       that it was so little and so gradual. They have the pale tint       of flowers that blossomed in too retired a shade--the coolness       of a meditative habit, which diffuses itself through the       feeling and observation of every sketch. Instead of passion,       there is sentiment; and, even in what purport to be pictures of       actual life, we have allegory, not always so warmly dressed in       its habiliments of flesh and blood as to be taken into the       reader's mind without a shiver. Whether from lack of power or       an unconquerable reserve, the author's touches have often an       effect of tameness; the merriest man can hardly contrive to       laugh at his broadest humor, the tenderest woman, one would       suppose, will hardly shed warm tears at his deepest pathos. The       book, if you would see any thing in it, requires to be read in       the clear, brown, twilight atmosphere in which it was written;       if opened in the sunshine, it is apt to look exceedingly like a       volume of blank pages....         \"The author would regret to be understood as speaking sourly or       querulously of the slight mark made by his earlier literary       efforts on the public at large. It is so far the contrary, that       he has been moved to write this preface, chiefly as affording       him an opportunity to express how much enjoyment he has owed to       these volumes, both before and since their publication. They       are the memorials of very tranquil, and not unhappy years. They       failed, it is true--nor could it have been otherwise--in       winning an extensive popularity. Occasionally, however, when he       deemed them entirely forgotten, a paragraph or an article, from       a native or foreign critic, would gratify his instincts of       authorship with unexpected praise,--too generous praise,       indeed, and too little alloyed with censure, which, therefore,       he learned the better to inflict upon himself. And, by-the-by,       it is a very suspicious symptom of a deficiency of the popular       element in a book, when it calls forth no harsh criticism. This       has been particularly the fortune of the _Twice-Told Tales_.       They made no enemies, and were so little known and talked       about, that those who read, and chanced to like them, were apt       to conceive the sort of kindness for the book, which a person       naturally feels for a discovery of his own. This kindly feeling       (in some cases, at least) extended to the author, who, on the       internal evidence of his sketches, came to be regarded as a       mild, shy, gentle, melancholic, exceedingly sensitive, and not       very forcible man, hiding his blushes under an assumed name,       the quaintness of which was supposed, somehow or other, to       symbolize his personal and literary traits. He is by no means       certain that some of his subsequent productions have not been       influenced and modified by a natural desire to fill up so       amiable an outline, and to act in consonance with the character       assigned to him; nor, even now, could he forfeit it without a       few tears of tender sensibility. To conclude, however,--these       volumes have opened the way to most agreeable"]]]
