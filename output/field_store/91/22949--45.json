Box 1089   Juneau, Alaska 99802    Dear Mr. Chapman:    This letter responds to your August 4, 1979, request for consultation  pursuant to Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as  amended, relative to the population of the humpback whale in Glacier  Bay, Alaska.    Your problem statement of the same date outlines the basic issue of  human activity in Glacier Bay National Monument that might be  affecting humpback whales. Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act  requires that each federal agency insure that its actions do not  jeopardize the continued existence of any listed species or result in  the destruction or adverse modification of critical habitat of such  species. The consultation process requires our comment and opinion on  the problem.    Within this context, our response addresses those National Park  Service (NPS) actions controlling human activity that may, in turn,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37122"],[0,"Hunting in Many Lands: The Book of the Boone and Crockett Club (#7)"],[1,"me went my friend J. B., the pearl of companions, and we  began the campaign by outfitting at San Diego, with a view to exploring  the resources of the sister republic in the peninsula of Lower  California. Lower California is very different from Southern California.  The latter is--well, a paradise, or something of that kind, if you  believe the inhabitants, of whom I am an humble fraction. The former is  what you may please to think.    At San Diego we got a man, a wagon, four mules and the needed provisions  and kitchen--all hired at reasonable rates, except the provisions and  kitchen, which we bought. Then we tried to get a decent map, but were  foiled. The Mexican explorer will find the maps of that country a source  of curious interest. Many of them are large and elaborately mounted on  cloth, spreading to a great distance when unfolded. The political  divisions are marked with a tropical profusion of bright colors, which  is very fit. A similar sense of fitness and beauty leads the designer to  insert mountain ranges, rivers and towns where they best please the eye,  and I have had occasion to consult a map which showed purely ideal  rivers flowing across a region where nature had put the divide of the  highest range in the State.    My furniture contained a hundred cartridges, a belt I always carry,  given by a friend, with a bear's head on the buckle (a belt which has  held, before I got it, more fatal bullets than any other west of the  Rockies), and my usual rifle. J. B. prepared himself in a similar way,  except the belt.    Starting south from San Diego, we crossed the line at Tia Juana, and  spent an unhappy day waiting on the custom house officials. They,  however, did their duty in a courteous manner, and we, with a bundle of  stamped papers, went on. The only duties we paid were those levied on  our provisions. The team and wagon were entered free under a  prospector's license for thirty days, and an obliging stableman signed  the necessary bond.    The main difficulty in traveling in Lower California lies in the fact  that you can get no feed for your animals. From Tia Juana east to  Tecate, where you find half a dozen hovels, there is hardly a house and  not a spear of grass for thirty miles. At Tecate there is a little  nibbling. Thence south for twenty-five miles we went to the Agua  Hechicera, or witching water; thence east twenty-five miles more to  Juarez, always without grass; thence south to the ranch house of the  Hansen ranch, at El Rayo, twenty-five miles more. There, at last, was a  little grass, but after passing that point we camped at Agua Blanca, and  were again without grass for thirty miles to the Trinidad Valley, which  once had a little grass, now eaten clean. Fortunately we were able to  buy hay at Tia Juana, and took some grain. Fortunately, also, we found  some corn for sale at Juarez. So, with constant graining, a little hay  and a supply of grass, either absent or contemptible, we managed to  pull the stock through.    Besides our four hired mules there was another, belonging to our man,  Oscar, which we towed behind to pack later. The animal was small in  size, but pulled back from 200 pounds to a ton at every step. Its sex  was female, but its name was Lazarus, for the overwhelming necessity of  naming animals of the ass tribe either Lazarus or Balaam tramples on all  distinctions of mere sex. We started, prepared for a possible, though  improbable, season of rain; but we did not count on extreme cold, yet  the first night out the water in our bucket froze, and almost every  night it froze from a mere skin to several inches thick. To give an idea  of the country, I will transcribe from a brief diary a few descriptions.  Starting from Tia Juana, we drove or packed for nearly 200 miles in a  southeasterly direction, until we finally sighted the Gulf and the  mountains of Sonora in the distance. At first our road lay through low  mountains, in valleys abounding in cholla cactus. From Tecate southward,  the country was rolling and clotted with brushwood, until you reach  Juarez. Juarez is an abandoned, or almost abandoned, placer camp. Here,  amid the countless pits of the miners, the pinons begin, and then, after  a short distance, the pine barrens stretch for forty miles. Beyond again  you pass into hills of low brush, and plains covered with sage and  buckweed, until finally you cross a divide into the broad basin of the  Trinidad Valley. This is a depression some twenty miles long and perhaps  five miles wide on the average, with a hot spring and a house at the  southwestern end, walled on the southeast by the grim frowning rampart  of the San Pedro Martir range, and on the other sides by mountains of  lesser height, but equal desolation.    We had intended at first to strike for the Cocopah range, near the mouth  of the Colorado River, and there do our hunting. Several reasons induced  us to change our plan and make for the Hansen ranch, where deer were  said to be plenty and sheep not distant; so we turned from Tecate  southward, made one dry camp and one camp near Juarez, and on the fifth  day of our journeying reached a long meadow, called the Bajio Largo, on  the Hansen ranch. We turned from the road and followed the narrow  park-like opening for four miles, camping in high pines, with water  near, and enough remnants of grass to amuse the animals. This region of  pine barrens occurs at quite an elevation, and the nights were cold. The  granite core of the country crops out all along in low broken hills, the  intervening mesas consisting of granite sand and gravel, and bearing  beside the pines a good deal of brush. Thickets of manzanita twisted  their blood-colored trunks over the ground, and the tawny stems of the  red-shank covered the country for miles. The red-shank is a lovely  shrub, growing about six or eight feet high, with broom-like foliage of  a yellowish green, possessing great fragrance. If you simply smell the  uncrushed shoots, they give a faint perfume, somewhat suggestive of  violets; and if you crush the leaves you get a more pungent odor, sweet  and a little smoky. Also, the gnarled roots of the red-shank make an  excellent cooking fire, if you can wait a few hours to have them burn to  coals. All things considered, the pine barren country is very  attractive, and if there were grass, water and game, it would be a fine  place for a hunter.    From our camp at Bajio Largo, J. B. and I went hunting for deer, which  were said to be plentiful. We hunted from early morning till noon,  seeing only one little fellow, about the size of a jack rabbit, scuttle  off in the brush. Then we decided to go home. This, however, turned out  to be a large business. The lofty trees prevented our getting any  extended view, and the stony gulches resembled each other to an annoying  degree. At last even the water seemed to flow the wrong way. So we gave  up the attempt to identify landmarks, and, following our sense of  direction and taking our course from the sun, we finally came again to  the long meadow, and, traveling down that, we came to camp. Here we  violated all rules by shooting at a mark--our excuse was that we had  decided to leave the vicinity without further hunting; and, at all  events, we spoiled a sardine box, to Oscar's great admiration.    In order to get a fair day's journey out of a fair day, we had to rise  at 4 or 5 o'clock. Oscar once or twice borrowed my watch to wake by, but  the result was only that I had to borrow J. B.'s watch to wake Oscar by;  so I afterwards retained the timepiece, and got up early enough to start  Oscar well on his duties.    The question of fresh meat had now become important. We left Bajio Largo  and drove to Hansen's Laguna, a shallow pond over a mile long, much  haunted by ducks. Here we made a bad mistake, driving six or eight miles  into the mountains, only to reach nowhere and be forced to retrace our  steps. Night, however, found us at El Rayo, the Hansen ranch house, and,  as it turned out, the real base of our hunting campaign. The Hansen  ranch is an extensive tract, named after an old Swede, who brought a few  cattle into the country years ago. The cattle multiplied exceedingly, to  the number, indeed, of several thousand, and can be seen at long range  by the passer-by. They are very wild and gaunt at present, and will  prance off among the rocks at a surprising rate before a man can get  within 200 yards of them. Ex-Governor Ryerson now owns these cattle, and  his major-domo, Don Manuel Murillo, a fine gray-haired veteran, learning  that I had known the Governor, gave me much friendly advice, and sent  his son to guide us well on the road to the Trinidad Valley and the  sheep land. He also provided us with potatoes and fresh meat, so that we  lived fatly thenceforth.    Our track lay past an abandoned saw-mill, built by the International  Company. Thence we were to go to Agua Blanca, the last water to be had  on the road; for the next thirty miles are dry. The saw-mill was built  to supply timber to the mining town of Alamo, some twenty-five miles  south. The camp is now in an expiring state and needs no timber, but is  said to shelter some rough and violent men. The road from the mill was  deep in sand, and our pace was slow. The darkness was coming cold and  fast when we finally drove on to the water and halted to camp.    Two men were there before us, with a saddle-horse each, and no other  apparent equipment. When we arrived, the men were watering their  animals, and at once turned their backs, so as not to be recognized.  Then they retired to the brush. We supped and staked out the mules, and  then sent Oscar to look up our neighbors. Oscar went and shouted, but  got no answer, and could find no men. We thought that our mules were in  some danger, and J. B., who is a yachtsman, proposed to keep anchor  watch. So Oscar remained awake till midnight, when he awoke me and  retired freezing,"]]]
