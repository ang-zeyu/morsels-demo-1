The envelopes are      marked B and C on both envelope and contents and the contents of each      is headed thus: B to be read as Clause 10 of my Will and the other C      to be read as Clause 11 of my Will.        \"13.

And if both Executors should die then      the matter of interpretation and execution of all matters in      connection with this my Last Will shall rest with the Lord Chancellor      of England for the time being or with whomsoever he may appoint for      the purpose.        \"'This my Last Will is given by me on the first day of January in the      year of Our Lord one thousand nine hundred and seven.                                                               \"'ROGER MELTON.        \"We Andrew Rossiter and John Colson here in the presence of each      other and of the Testator have seen the Testator Roger Melton sign      and seal this document.  In witness thereof we hereby set our names        \"'ANDREW ROSSITER clerk of 9 Primrose Avenue London W.C.        \"'JOHN COLSON caretaker of 176 Lincoln's Inn Fields and Verger of St.      Tabitha's Church Clerkenwell London.'\"    When Mr. Trent had finished the reading he put all the papers together,  and tied them up in a bundle again with the red tape.  Holding the bundle  in his hand, he stood up, saying as he did so:    \"That is all, gentlemen, unless any of you wish to ask me any questions;  in which case I shall answer, of course, to the best of my power.  I  shall ask you, Sir Colin, to remain with me, as we have to deal with some  matters, or to arrange a time when we may meet to do so.  And you also,  Mr. Sent Leger, as there is this letter to submit to you.  It is  necessary that you should open it in the presence of the executors, but  there is no necessity that anyone else should be present.\"    The first to speak was my father.  Of course, as a county gentleman of  position and estate, who is sometimes asked to take the chair at  Sessions--of course, when there is not anyone with a title present--he  found himself under the duty of expressing himself first.  Old MacKelpie  has superior rank; but this was a family affair, in which my father is  Head of the House, whilst old MacKelpie is only an outsider brought into  it--and then only to the distaff side, by the wife of a younger brother  of the man who married into our family.  Father spoke with the same look  on his face as when he asks important questions of witnesses at Quarter  Sessions.    \"I should like some points elucidated.\"  The attorney bowed (he gets his  120 thou', any way, so he can afford to be oily--suave, I suppose he  would call it); so father looked at a slip of paper in his hand and  asked:    \"How much is the amount of the whole estate?\"    The attorney answered quickly, and I thought rather rudely.  He was red  in the face, and didn't bow this time; I suppose a man of his class  hasn't more than a very limited stock of manners:    \"That, sir, I am not at liberty to tell you.  And I may say that I would  not if I could.\"    \"Is it a million?\" said father again.  He was angry this time, and even  redder than the old attorney.  The attorney said in answer, very quietly  this time:    \"Ah, that's cross-examining.  Let me say, sir, that no one can know that  until the accountants to be appointed for the purpose have examined the  affairs of the testator up to date.\"    Mr. Rupert St. Leger, who was looking all this time angrier than even the  attorney or my father--though at what he had to be angry about I can't  imagine--struck his fist on the table and rose up as if to speak, but as  he caught sight of both old MacKelpie and the attorney he sat down again.  _Mem._--Those three seem to agree too well.  I must keep a sharp eye on  them.  I didn't think of this part any more at the time, for father asked  another question which interested me much:    \"May I ask why the other matters of the Will are not shown to us?\"  The  attorney wiped his spectacles carefully with a big silk bandanna  handkerchief before he answered:    \"Simply because each of the two letters marked 'B' and 'C' is enclosed  with instructions regarding their opening and the keeping secret of their  contents.  I shall call your attention to the fact that both envelopes  are sealed, and that the testator and both witnesses have signed their  names across the flap of each envelope.  I shall read them.  The letter  marked 'B,' directed to 'Rupert Sent Leger,' is thus endorsed:        \"'This letter is to be given to Rupert Sent Leger by the Trustees and      is to be opened by him in their presence.  He is to take such copy or      make such notes as he may wish and is then to hand the letter with      envelope to the Executors who are at once to read it, each of them      being entitled to make copy or notes if desirous of so doing.  The      letter is then to be replaced in its envelope and letter and envelope      are to be placed in another envelope to be endorsed on outside as to      its contents and to be signed across the flap by both the Executors      and by the said Rupert Sent Leger.                                              \"'(Signed) ROGER MELTON 1/6/'06.    \"The letter marked 'C,' directed to 'Edward Bingham Trent,' is thus  endorsed:        \"'This letter directed to Edward Bingham Trent is to be kept by him      unopened for a term of two years after the reading of my Last Will      unless said period is earlier terminated by either the acceptance or      refusal of Rupert Sent Leger to accept the conditions mentioned in my      letter to him marked 'B' which he is to receive and read in the      presence of my Executors at the same meeting as but subsequent to the      Reading of the clauses (except those to be ultimately numbers ten and      eleven) of my Last Will.  This letter contains instructions as to      what both the Executors and the said Rupert Sent Leger are to do when      such acceptance or refusal of the said Rupert Sent Leger has been      made known, or if he omit or refuse to make any such acceptance or      refusal, at the end of two years next after my decease.        \"'(Signed) ROGER MELTON 1/6/'06.'\"    When the attorney had finished reading the last letter he put it  carefully in his pocket.  Then he took the other letter in his hand, and  stood up.  \"Mr. Rupert Sent Leger,\" he said, \"please to open this letter,  and in such a way that all present may see that the memorandum at top of  the contents is given as--        \"'B.  To be read as clause ten of my Will.'\"    St. Leger rolled up his sleeves and cuffs just as if he was going to  perform some sort of prestidigitation--it was very theatrical and  ridiculous--then, his wrists being quite bare, he opened the envelope and  took out the letter.  We all saw it quite well.  It was folded with the  first page outward, and on the top was written a line just as the  attorney said.  In obedience to a request from the attorney, he laid both  letter and envelope on the table in front of him.  The clerk then rose  up, and, after handing a piece of paper to the attorney, went back to his  seat.  Mr. Trent, having written something on the paper, asked us all who  were present, even the clerk and the shorthand man, to look at the  memorandum on the letter and what was written on the envelope, and to  sign the paper, which ran:    \"We the signatories of this paper hereby declare that we have seen the  sealed letter marked B and enclosed in the Will of Roger Melton opened in  the presence of us all including Mr. Edward Bingham Trent and Sir Colin  Alexander MacKelpie and we declare that the paper therein contained was  headed 'B.  To be read as clause ten of my Will' and that there were no  other contents in the envelope.  In attestation of which we in the  presence of each other append our signatures.\"    The attorney motioned to my father to begin.  Father is a cautious man,  and he asked for a magnifying-glass, which was shortly brought to him by  a clerk for whom the clerk in the room called.  Father examined the  envelope all over very carefully, and also the memorandum at top of the  paper.  Then, without a word, he signed the paper.  Father is a just man.  Then we all signed.  The attorney folded the paper and put it in an  envelope.  Before closing it he passed it round, and we all saw that it  had not been tampered with.  Father took it out and read it, and then put  it back.  Then the attorney asked us all to sign it across the flap,  which we did.  Then he put the sealing-wax on it and asked father to seal  it with his own seal.  He did so.  Then he and MacKelpie sealed it also  with their own seals, Then he put it in another envelope, which he sealed  himself, and he and MacKelpie signed it across the flap.    Then father stood up, and so did I.  So did the two men--the clerk and  the shorthand writer.  Father did not say a word till we got out into the  street.  We walked along, and presently we passed an open gate into the  fields.  He turned back, saying to me:    \"Come in here.  There is no one about, and we can be quiet.  I want to  speak to you.\"  When we sat down on a seat with none other near it,  father said:    \"You are a student of the law.

(Ant. 2)            All-seeing Time hath caught            Guilt, and to justice brought  The son and sire commingled in one bed.            O child of Laius' ill-starred race            Would I had ne'er beheld thy face;  I raise for thee a dirge as o'er the dead.  Yet, sooth to say, through thee I drew new breath,  And now through thee I feel a second death.  [Enter SECOND MESSENGER.]    SECOND MESSENGER  Most grave and reverend senators of Thebes,  What Deeds ye soon must hear, what sights behold  How will ye mourn, if, true-born patriots,  Ye reverence still the race of Labdacus!  Not Ister nor all Phasis' flood, I ween,  Could wash away the blood-stains from this house,  The ills it shrouds or soon will bring to light,  Ills wrought of malice, not unwittingly.  The worst to bear are self-inflicted wounds.    CHORUS  Grievous enough for all our tears and groans  Our past calamities; what canst thou add?    SECOND MESSENGER  My tale is quickly told and quickly heard.  Our sovereign lady queen Jocasta's dead.    CHORUS  Alas, poor queen! how came she by her death?    SECOND MESSENGER  By her own hand.  And all the horror of it,  Not having seen, yet cannot comprehend.  Nathless, as far as my poor memory serves,  I will relate the unhappy lady's woe.  When in her frenzy she had passed inside  The vestibule, she hurried straight to win  The bridal-chamber, clutching at her hair  With both her hands, and, once within the room,  She shut the doors behind her with a crash.  \"Laius,\" she cried, and called her husband dead  Long, long ago; her thought was of that child  By him begot, the son by whom the sire  Was murdered and the mother left to breed  With her own seed, a monstrous progeny.  Then she bewailed the marriage bed whereon  Poor wretch, she had conceived a double brood,  Husband by husband, children by her child.  What happened after that I cannot tell,  Nor how the end befell, for with a shriek  Burst on us Oedipus; all eyes were fixed  On Oedipus, as up and down he strode,  Nor could we mark her agony to the end.  For stalking to and fro \"A sword!\" he cried,  \"Where is the wife, no wife, the teeming womb  That bore a double harvest, me and mine?\"  And in his frenzy some supernal power  (No mortal, surely, none of us who watched him)  Guided his footsteps; with a terrible shriek,  As though one beckoned him, he crashed against  The folding doors, and from their staples forced  The wrenched bolts and hurled himself within.  Then we beheld the woman hanging there,  A running noose entwined about her neck.  But when he saw her, with a maddened roar  He loosed the cord; and when her wretched corpse  Lay stretched on earth, what followed--O 'twas dread!  He tore the golden brooches that upheld  Her queenly robes, upraised them high and smote  Full on his eye-balls, uttering words like these:  \"No more shall ye behold such sights of woe,  Deeds I have suffered and myself have wrought;  Henceforward quenched in darkness shall ye see  Those ye should ne'er have seen; now blind to those  Whom, when I saw, I vainly yearned to know.\"       Such was the burden of his moan, whereto,  Not once but oft, he struck with his hand uplift  His eyes, and at each stroke the ensanguined orbs  Bedewed his beard, not oozing drop by drop,  But one black gory downpour, thick as hail.  Such evils, issuing from the double source,  Have whelmed them both, confounding man and wife.  Till now the storied fortune of this house  Was fortunate indeed; but from this day  Woe, lamentation, ruin, death, disgrace,  All ills that can be named, all, all are theirs.    CHORUS  But hath he still no respite from his pain?    SECOND MESSENGER  He cries, \"Unbar the doors and let all Thebes  Behold the slayer of his sire, his mother's--\"  That shameful word my lips may not repeat.  He vows to fly self-banished from the land,  Nor stay to bring upon his house the curse  Himself had uttered; but he has no strength  Nor one to guide him, and his torture's more  Than man can suffer, as yourselves will see.  For lo, the palace portals are unbarred,  And soon ye shall behold a sight so sad  That he who must abhorred would pity it.  [Enter OEDIPUS blinded.]    CHORUS            Woeful sight! more woeful none            These sad eyes have looked upon.            Whence this madness?  None can tell            Who did cast on thee his spell,            prowling all thy life around,            Leaping with a demon bound.            Hapless wretch! how can I brook            On thy misery to look?            Though to gaze on thee I yearn,            Much to question, much to learn,            Horror-struck away I turn.    OEDIPUS  Ah me! ah woe is me!  Ah whither am I borne!  How like a ghost forlorn  My voice flits from me on the air!  On, on the demon goads.  The end, ah where?    CHORUS  An end too dread to tell, too dark to see.    OEDIPUS  (Str. 1)  Dark, dark!  The horror of darkness, like a shroud,  Wraps me and bears me on through mist and cloud.  Ah me, ah me!  What spasms athwart me shoot,  What pangs of agonizing memory?    CHORUS  No marvel if in such a plight thou feel'st  The double weight of past and present woes.    OEDIPUS  (Ant. 1)  Ah friend, still loyal, constant still and kind,            Thou carest for the blind.  I know thee near, and though bereft of eyes,            Thy voice I recognize.    CHORUS  O doer of dread deeds, how couldst thou mar  Thy vision thus?  What demon goaded thee?    OEDIPUS  (Str. 2)  Apollo, friend, Apollo, he it was            That brought these ills to pass;  But the right hand that dealt the blow            Was mine, none other.  How,  How, could I longer see when sight            Brought no delight?    CHORUS  Alas! 'tis as thou sayest.    OEDIPUS  Say, friends, can any look or voice  Or touch of love henceforth my heart rejoice?            Haste, friends, no fond delay,            Take the twice cursed away                 Far from all ken,  The man abhorred of gods, accursed of men.    CHORUS  O thy despair well suits thy desperate case.  Would I had never looked upon thy face!    OEDIPUS  (Ant. 2)  My curse on him whoe'er unrived  The waif's fell fetters and my life revived!  He meant me well, yet had he left me there,  He had saved my friends and me a world of care.    CHORUS  I too had wished it so.    OEDIPUS  Then had I never come to shed  My father's blood nor climbed my mother's bed;  The monstrous offspring of a womb defiled,  Co-mate of him who gendered me, and child.  Was ever man before afflicted thus,  Like Oedipus.    CHORUS  I cannot say that thou hast counseled well,  For thou wert better dead than living blind.    OEDIPUS  What's done was well done.  Thou canst never shake  My firm belief.  A truce to argument.  For, had I sight, I know not with what eyes  I could have met my father in the shades,  Or my poor mother, since against the twain  I sinned, a sin no gallows could atone.  Aye, but, ye say, the sight of children joys  A parent's eyes.  What, born as mine were born?  No, such a sight could never bring me joy;  Nor this fair city with its battlements,  Its temples and the statues of its gods,  Sights from which I, now wretchedst of all,  Once ranked the foremost Theban in all Thebes,  By my own sentence am cut off, condemned  By my own proclamation 'gainst the wretch,  The miscreant by heaven itself declared  Unclean--and of the race of Laius.  Thus branded as a felon by myself,  How had I dared to look you in the face?  Nay, had I known a way to choke the springs  Of hearing, I had never shrunk to make  A dungeon of this miserable frame,  Cut off from sight and hearing; for 'tis bliss  to bide in regions sorrow cannot reach.  Why didst thou harbor me, Cithaeron, why  Didst thou not take and slay me?  Then I never  Had shown to men the secret of my birth.  O Polybus, O Corinth, O my home,  Home of my ancestors (so wast thou called)  How fair a nursling then I seemed, how foul  The canker that lay festering in the bud!  Now is the blight revealed of root and fruit.  Ye triple high-roads, and thou hidden glen,  Coppice, and pass where meet the three-branched ways,  Ye drank my blood, the life-blood these hands spilt,  My father's; do ye call to mind perchance  Those deeds of mine ye witnessed and the work  I wrought thereafter when I came to Thebes?  O fatal wedlock, thou didst give me birth,  And, having borne me, sowed again my seed,  Mingling the blood of fathers, brothers, children,  Brides, wives and mothers, an incestuous brood,  All horrors that are wrought beneath the sun,  Horrors so foul to name them were unmeet.  O, I adjure you, hide me anywhere  Far from this land, or slay me straight, or cast me  Down to the depths of ocean out of sight.  Come hither, deign to touch an abject wretch;  Draw near and fear not; I myself must bear  The load of guilt that none but I can share.  [Enter CREON.]    CREON  Lo, here is Creon, the one man to grant  Thy prayer by action or advice, for he  Is left the State's sole guardian in thy stead.    OEDIPUS  Ah me! what words to accost him can I find?  What cause has he to trust me?  In the past  I have bee proved his rancorous enemy.    CREON  Not in derision, Oedipus, I come  Nor to upbraid thee with thy past misdeeds.  (To BYSTANDERS)  But shame upon you! if ye feel no sense  Of human decencies, at least revere  The Sun whose light beholds and nurtures all.  Leave not thus nakedly for all to gaze at  A horror neither earth nor rain from heaven  Nor light will suffer.  Lead him straight within,  For it is seemly that a kinsman's woes  Be heard by kin and seen by kin alone.    OEDIPUS  O listen, since thy presence comes to me  A shock of glad surprise--so noble thou,  And I so vile--O grant me one small boon.  I ask it not on my behalf, but thine.    CREON  And what the favor thou wouldst crave of me?    OEDIPUS  Forth from thy borders thrust me with all speed;  Set me within some vasty desert where  No mortal voice shall greet me any "]]]
