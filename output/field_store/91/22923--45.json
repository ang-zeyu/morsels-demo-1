The Angora cat, as its name indicates, comes from Angora, in Western  Asia, a province that is also celebrated for its goats with long hair,  which is of extremely fine quality. It is said that this deteriorates  when the animal leaves that locality. This may be so, but that I have no  means of proving; yet, if so, do the Angora cats also deteriorate in the  silky qualities of their fur? Or does it get shorter? Certain it is that  many of the imported cats have finer and longer hair than those bred in  this country; but when are the latter true bred? Even some a little  cross-bred will often have long hair, but not of the texture as regards  length and silkiness which is to be noted in the pure breed. The Angora  cats, I am told, are great favourites with the Turks and Armenians, and  the best are of high value, a pure white, with blue eyes, being thought  the perfection of cats, all other points being good, and its hearing by  no means defective. The points are a small head, with not too long a  nose, large full eyes of a colour in harmony with that of its fur, ears  rather large than small and pointed, with a tuft of hair at the apex,  the size not showing, as they are deeply set in the long hair on the  forehead, with a very full flowing mane about the head and neck; this  latter should not be short, neither the body, which should be long,  graceful, and elegant, and covered with long, silky hair, with a slight  admixture of woolliness; in this it differs from the Persian, and the  longer the better. In texture it should be as fine as possible, and also  not so woolly as that of the Russian; still it is more inclined to be so  than the Persian. The legs to be of moderate length, and in proportion  to the body; the tail long, and slightly curving upward towards the end.  The hair should be very long at the base, less so toward the tip. When  perfect, it is an extremely beautiful and elegant object, and no wonder  that it has become a pet among the Orientals. The colours are varied;  but the black which should have orange eyes, as should also the slate  colours, and blues, and the white are the most esteemed, though the soft  slates, blues, and the light fawns, deep reds, and mottled grays are  shades of colour that blend well with the Eastern furniture and other  surroundings. There are also light grays, and what is termed smoke  colour; a beauty was shown at Brighton which was white with black tips  to the hair, the white being scarcely visible, unless the hair was  parted; this tinting had a marvellous effect. I have never seen imported  strong-coloured tabbies of this breed, nor do I believe such are true  Angoras. Fine specimens are even now rare in this country, and are  extremely valuable. In manners and temper they are quiet, sociable, and  docile, though given to roaming, especially in the country, where I have  seen them far from their homes, hunting the hedgerows more like dogs  than cats; nor do they appear to possess the keen intelligence of the  short-haired European cat. They are not new to us, being mentioned by  writers nearly a hundred years ago, if not more. I well remember white  specimens of uncommon size on sale in Leadenhall Market, more than forty  years since; the price usually was five guineas, though some of rare  excellence would realise double that sum.    [Illustration: MISS MOORE'S \"DINAH.\"]        [Illustration: MISS SAUNDERS' \"SYLVIE.\"]          THE PERSIAN CAT.      This differs somewhat from the Angora, the tail being generally longer,  more like a table brush in point of form, and is generally slightly  turned upwards, the hair being more full and coarser at the end, while  at the base it is somewhat longer. The head is rather larger, with less  pointed ears, although these should not be devoid of the tuft at the  apex, and also well furnished with long hair within, and of moderate  size. The eyes should be large, full, and round, with a soft expression;  the hair on the forehead is generally rather short in comparison to the  other parts of the body, which ought to be clothed with long silky hair,  very long about the neck, giving the appearance of the mane of the lion.  The legs, feet, and toes should be well clothed with long hair and have  well-developed fringes on the toes, assuming the character of tufts  between them. It is larger in body, and generally broader in the loins,  and apparently stronger made, than the foregoing variety, though yet  slender and elegant, with small bone, and exceedingly graceful in all  its movements, there being a kind of languor observable in its walk,  until roused, when it immediately assumes the quick motion of the  ordinary short-haired cat, though not so alert. The colours vary very  much, and comprise almost every tint obtainable in cats, though the  tortoiseshell is not, nor is the dark marked tabby, in my opinion, a  Persian cat colour, but has been got by crossing with the short-haired  tortoiseshell, and also English tabby, and as generally shows pretty  clearly unmistakable signs of such being the case. For a long time, if  not now, the black was the most sought after and the most difficult to  obtain. A good rich, deep black, with orange-coloured eyes and long  flowing hair, grand in mane, large and with graceful carriage, with a  mild expression, is truly a very beautiful object, and one very rare.  The best I have hitherto seen was one that belonged to Mr. Edward Lloyd,  the great authority on all matters relating to aquariums. It was called  Mimie, and was a very fine specimen, usually carrying off the first  prize wherever shown. It generally wore a handsome collar, on which was  inscribed its name and victories. The collar, as Mr. Lloyd used jocosely  to observe, really belonged to it, as it was bought out of its winnings;  and, according to the accounts kept, was proved also to have paid for  its food for some considerable period. It was, as its owner laughingly  said, \"his friend, and not his dependent,\" and generally used to sit on  the table by his side while he was writing either his letters, articles,  or planning those improvements regarding aquariums, for which he was so  justly celebrated.    [Illustration]    Next in value is the light slate or blue colour. This beautiful tint is  very different in its shades. In some it verges towards a light purplish  or lilac hue, and is very lovely; in others it tends to a much bluer  tone, having a colder and harder appearance, still beautiful by way of  contrast; in all the colour should be pure, even, and bright, not in any  way mottled, which is a defect; and I may here remark that in these  colours the hair is generally of a softer texture, as far as I have  observed, than that of any other colour, not excepting the white, which  is also in much request. Then follow the various shades of light  tabbies, so light in the marking having scarcely a right to be called  tabbies; in fact, tabby is not a Persian colour, nor have I ever seen an  imported cat of that colour--I mean firmly, strongly marked with black  on a brown-blue or gray ground, until they culminate in those of intense  richness and density in the way of deep, harmonious browns and reds, yet  still preserving throughout an extreme delicacy of line and tracery,  never becoming harsh or hard in any of its arrangements or colour; not  as the ordinary short-haired tabby. The eyes should be orange-yellow in  the browns, reds, blues, grays, and blacks.    [Illustration: MR. A. A. CLARKE'S \"TIM.\"]    As far as my experience extends, and I have had numerous opportunities  of noticing, I find this variety less reliable as regards temper than  the short-haired cats, less also in the keen sense of observing, as in  the Angora, and also of turning such observations to account, either as  regards their comfort, their endeavour to help themselves, or in their  efforts to escape from confinement.    In some few cases I have found them to be of almost a savage  disposition, biting and snapping more like a dog than a cat, and using  their claws less for protective purposes. Nor have I found them so  \"cossetty\" in their ways as those of the \"short-coats,\" though I have  known exceptions in both.    They are much given to roam, as indeed are the Russian and Angora,  especially in the country, going considerable distances either for their  own pleasure or in search of food, or when \"on the hunt.\" After mature  consideration, I have come to the conclusion that this breed, and  slightly so the preceding, are decidedly different in their habits to  the short-haired English domestic cat, as it is now generally called.    It may be, however, only a very close observer would notice the several  peculiarities which I consider certainly exist. These cats attach  themselves to places more than persons, and are indifferent to those who  feed and have the care of them. They are beautiful and useful objects  about the house, and generally very pleasant companions, and when kept  with the short-haired varieties form an exceedingly pretty and  interesting contrast; but, as I have stated, they certainly require more  attention to their training, and more caution in their handling, than  the latter. I may here remark, that during the time I have acted as  judge at cat shows, which is now over eighteen years, it has been seldom  there has been any display of temper in the short-haired breeds in  comparison with the long; though some of the former, in some instances,  have not comported themselves with that sweetness and amiability of  disposition that is their usual characteristic. My attendant has been  frequently wounded in our endeavour to examine the fur, dentition, etc.,  of the Angora, Persian, or Russian; and once severely by a \"short-hair.\"  Hitherto I have been so fortunate as to escape all injury, but this I  attribute to my close observation of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35470"],[0,"Key to the Science of Theology (#7)"],[1,"are all these, when measured by thee,      But marks on thy dial, or motes on thy sea!    The idea of a God without \"body, parts, or passions,\" is not more  absurd or inconsistent than that modern popular doctrine, that all  things were created from nonentity, or in other words, that something  originated from nothing.    It is a self-evident truth, which will not admit of argument, that  nothing remains nothing. Nonentity is the negative of all existence.  This negative possesses no property or element upon which the energies  of creative power can operate.    This mysticism must, therefore, share the fate of the other mysteries  of false Theology and philosophy, which have for ages shrouded the  world in the sable curtains of a long and dreary night. It must  evaporate and disappear as a mere creation of fancy, while, in its  place, are introduced the following self-evident and incontrovertible  facts--    First. There has always existed a boundless infinitude of space.    Second. Intermingled with this space there exists all the varieties of  the elements, properties, or things of which intelligence takes  cognizance; which elements or things taken altogether compose what is  called the Universe.    Third. The elements of all these properties or things are eternal,  uncreated, self-existing. Not one particle can be added to them by  creative power. Neither can one particle be diminished or annihilated.    Fourth. These eternal, self-existing elements possess in themselves  certain inherent properties or attributes, in a greater or less  degree; or, in other words, they possess intelligence, adapted to  their several spheres.    These elements have been separated, by philosophers, into two grand  divisions, viz.--                         \"PHYSICAL AND SPIRITUAL.\"    To a mind matured, or quickened with a fulness of intelligence, so as  to be conversant with all the elements of nature, there is no use for  the distinction implied in such terms.    To speak more philosophically, all the elements are spiritual, all are  physical, all are material, tangible realities. Spirit is matter, and  matter is full of spirit. Because all things which do exist are  eternal realities, in their elementary existence.    Who then can define the precise point, in the scale of elementary  existence, which divides between the physical and spiritual kingdoms?  There are eyes which can discern the most refined particles of  elementary existence. There are hands and fingers to whose refined  touch all things are tangible.    In the capacity of mortals, however, some of the elements are  tangible, or visible, and others invisible. Those which are tangible  to our senses, we call physical; those which are more subtle and  refined, we call spiritual.    Spirit is intelligence, or the light of truth, which filleth all  things.    Its several emotions or affections, such as love, joy, &c., are but so  many actions or motions of these elements, as they operate in their  several spheres.    By these actions or emotions the elements manifest their eternal  energies, attributes, or inherent powers.    In contemplating the works of creation, then, the student must not  conceive the idea that space, or time, or element, or intelligence,  was originated, but rather, that these are eternal, and that they  constitute the energies which act, and the things acted upon,  including the place and time of action.    The whole vast structure of universal organized existence, presents  undeniable evidence of three facts, viz.--    First. The eternal existence of the elements of which it is composed.    Second. The eternal existence of the attributes of intelligence, and  wisdom to design.    Third. The eternal existence of power, to operate upon and control  these eternal elements, so as to carry out the plans of the designer.    It will be recollected that the last chapter recognizes a family of  Gods, or, in other words, a species of beings, who have physical  tabernacles of flesh and bones, in the form of man, but so constructed  as to be capable of eternal life; that these tabernacles are  quickened, or animated by a fulness of that holiest of all elements,  which is called the Holy Spirit, which element or spirit, when  organized, in individual form, and clothed upon with flesh and bones  in the highest possible refinement, contains, in itself, a fulness of  the attributes of light, intelligence, wisdom, love, and power; also  that there are vast quantities of this spirit or element not organized  in bodily forms, but widely diffused among the other elements of  space.    A General Assembly, Quorum, or Grand Council of the Gods, with their  President at their head, constitute the designing and creating power.    The motive power, which moves to action this grand creative power, is  wisdom, which discovers a use for all these riches, and inspires the  carrying out of all the designs in an infinite variety of utility and  adaptation.    Wisdom inspires the Gods to multiply their species and to lay the  foundation for all the forms of life, to increase in numbers, and for  each to enjoy himself in the sphere to which he is adapted, and in the  possession and use of that portion of the elements necessary to his  existence and happiness.    In order to multiply organized bodies, composed of spiritual element,  worlds and mansions composed of spiritual element would be necessary  as a home, adapted to their existence and enjoyment. As these  spiritual bodies increased in numbers, other spiritual worlds would be  necessary, on which to transplant them.    Again. In order to enable these organized spirits to take upon them a  fleshly tabernacle, physical worlds, with all their variety and  fulness, would be necessary for their homes, food, clothing, &c., that  they might be begotten, sustained, and born, that they might live,  die, and rise again to receive their inheritances on their respective  earths.    Hence the great work of regeneration of worlds, or the renovation and  adaptation of the elements to the resurrection and eternal state of  man, would also be endless, or eternally progressive.    Through every form of life, and birth, and change, and resurrection,  and every form of progress in knowledge and experience, the candidates  for eternal life must look upon the elements as their home; hence the  elements, upon the principle of adaptation, must keep pace with the  possessors who use them, in all the degrees of progressive refinement.    While room is found in infinite space:    While there are particles of unorganized element in Nature's  storehouse:    While the trees of Paradise yield their fruits, or the Fountain of  Life its river:    While the bosoms of the Gods glow with affection:    While eternal charity endures, or eternity itself rolls its successive  ages, the heavens will multiply, and new worlds and more people be  added to the kingdoms of the Fathers.    Thus, in the progress of events, unnumbered millions of worlds, and of  systems of worlds, will necessarily be called into requisition, and be  filled by man, and beast, and fowl, and tree, and all the vast  varieties of beings, and things which ever budded and blossomed in  Eden, or thronged the hills and valleys of the celestial Paradise.    When, in the endless progression of events, the full time had arrived  for infinite wisdom to organize and people this globe which we  inhabit, the chaotic elements were arranged in order. It appears at  the commencement of this grand work, that the elements, which are now  so beautifully arranged and adapted to vegetable and animal life, were  found in a state of chaos, entirely unadapted to the uses they now  serve.    There was one vast mixture of elements. Earth, water, soil,  atmosphere--in short, the entire elements of which this mass was  composed, seem to have been completely compounded, or mingled into one  vast chaos, and the whole overwhelmed with a darkness so dense as to  obscure the light of heaven.    Let us turn from the contemplation of scenes so sublimely fearful.  Suffice it to say, the mandate came, darkness fled, the veil was  lifted, light pierced the gloom, and chaos was made visible. Oh what a  scene! A world without landscape, without vegetation, without animal  life, without man, or animated beings. No sound broke on the  stillness, save the voice of the moaning winds, and of dashing,  foaming waters. Again, a voice comes booming over the abyss, and  echoing amid the wastes, the mass of matter hears and trembles, and  lo! the sea retires, the muddy shapeless mass lifts its head above the  waters.    Molehills to mountains grow. Huge islands next appear, and continents  at length expand to view, with hill and vale, in one wide dreary  waste, unmeasured and untrodden.    The surface, warmed and dried by the cheering rays of the now  resplendent sun, is prepared for the first seeds of vegetation.    A Royal Planter now descends from yonder world of older date, and  bearing in his hand the choice seeds of the older Paradise, he plants  them in the virgin soil of our new born earth. They grow and flourish  there, and, bearing seed, replant themselves, and thus clothe the  naked earth with scenes of beauty, and the air with fragrant incense.  Ripening fruits and herbs at length abound. When, lo! from yonder  world is transferred every species of animal life. Male and female,  they come, with blessings on their heads; and a voice is heard again,  \"_Be fruitful and multiply_.\"    Earth--its mineral, vegetable and animal wealth--its Paradise,  prepared, down comes from yonder world on high, a son of God, with his  beloved spouse. And thus a colony from heaven, it may be from the sun,  is transplanted on our soil. The blessings of their Father are upon  them, and the first great law of heaven and earth is again repeated,  \"_Be fruitful and multiply_.\"    Hence, the nations which have swarmed our earth.    In after years, "]]]
