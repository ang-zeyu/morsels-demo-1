[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38827"],[0,"Journeys in Persia and Kurdistan, Volume 1 (of 2) (#7)"],[1," in all the variety of their picturesque national  costumes, to which the niggardly clothing of a chance European acts as  an ungraceful foil; Persian dead, usually swaddled, making their last  journey on mule or horseback to the holy ground at Kerbela, and the  occasional march of horse or foot through the thronged bazars, are  among the hourly sights of a city on which European influence is  scarcely if at all perceptible.    Turkish statistics must be received with caution, and the population  of Baghdad may not reach 120,000 souls, but it has obviously recovered  wonderfully from the effects of war, plague, inundation, and famine,  and looks busy and fairly prosperous, so much so indeed that the  account given of its misery and decay in Mr. Baillie Fraser's charming  _Travels in Kurdistan_ reads like a story of the last century. If  nothing remains of the glories of the city of the Caliphs, it is  certainly for Turkey a busy, growing, and passably wealthy  nineteenth-century capital. It is said to have a hundred mosques,  twenty-six minarets, and fifteen domes, but I have not counted them!    Its bazars, which many people regard as the finest in the East outside  of Stamboul, are of enormous extent and very great variety. Many are  of brick, with well-built domed roofs, and sides arcaded both above  and below, and are wide and airy. Some are of wood, all are covered,  and admit light scantily, only from the roof. Those which supply the  poorer classes are apt to be ruinous and squalid--\"_ramshackle_,\" to  say the truth, with an air of decay about them, and their roofs are  merely rough timber, roughly thatched with reeds or date tree fronds.  Of splendour there is none anywhere, and of cleanliness there are few  traces. The old, narrow, and filthy bazars in which the gold and  silversmiths ply their trade are of all the most interesting. The  trades have their separate localities, and the buyer who is in search  of cotton goods, silk stuffs, carpets, cotton yarn, gold and silver  thread, ready-made clothing, weapons, saddlery, rope, fruit, meat,  grain, fish, jewellery, muslins, copper pots, etc., has a whole alley  of contiguous shops devoted to the sale of the same article to choose  from.    At any hour of daylight at this season progress through the bazars is  slow. They are crowded, and almost entirely with men. It is only the  poorer women who market for themselves, and in twos and threes, at  certain hours of the day. In a whole afternoon, among thousands of  men, I saw only five women, tall, shapeless, badly-made-up bundles,  carried mysteriously along, rather by high, loose, canary-yellow  leather boots than by feet. The face is covered with a thick black  gauze mask, or cloth, and the head and remainder of the form with a  dark blue or black sheet, which is clutched by the hand below the  nose. The walk is one of tottering decrepitude. All the business  transacted in the bazars is a matter of bargaining, and as Arabs shout  at the top of their voices, and buyers and sellers are equally keen,  the roar is tremendous.    Great _cafes_, as in Cairo, occur frequently. In the larger ones from  a hundred to two hundred men are seen lounging at one time on the  broad matted seats, shouting, chaffering, drinking coffee or _sharbat_  and smoking _chibouks_ or _kalians_. Negro attendants supply their  wants. These _cafes_ are the clubs of Baghdad. Whatever of public  opinion exists in a country where the recognised use of words is to  \"conceal thought,\" is formed in them. They are centres of business  likewise, and much of the noise is due to bargaining, and they are  also manufactories of rumours, scandals, and fanaticism. The great  caravanserais, such as the magnificent Khan Othman, are also resorts  of merchants for the display and sale of their goods.    Europeans never make purchases in the bazars. They either have the  goods from which they wish to make a choice brought to their houses,  or their servants bargain for them, getting a commission both from  buyer and seller.    The splendour of the East, if it exists at all, is not to be seen in  the bazars. The jewelled daggers, the cloth of silver and gold, the  diaphanous silk tissues, the brocaded silks, the rich embroideries,  the damascened sword blades, the finer carpets, the inlaid armour, the  cunning work in brass and inlaid bronze, and all the articles of  _vertu_ and _bric-a-brac_ of real or spurious value, are carefully  concealed by their owners, and are carried for display, with much  secrecy and mystery, to the houses of their ordinary customers, and to  such European strangers as are reported to be willing to be  victimised.    Trade in Baghdad is regarded by Europeans and large capitalists as  growing annually more depressed and unsatisfactory, but this is not  the view of the small traders, chiefly Jews and Christians, who start  with a capital of L5 or upwards, and by buying some cheap lot in  Bombay,--gay handkerchiefs, perfumery, shoes, socks, buttons, tin  boxes with mirror lids, scissors, pocket-knives, toys, and the  like,--bid fair to make small fortunes. The amount of perfumery and  rubbish piled in these ramshackle shops is wonderful. The trader who  picks up a desert Arab for a customer and sells him a knife, or a  mirror box, or a packet of candles is likely to attract to himself a  large trade, for when once the unmastered pastoral hordes of Al  Jaz[=i]ra, Trak, and Stram[=i]ya see such objects, the desire of  possession is aroused, and the refuse of Manchester and Birmingham  will find its way into every tent in the desert.    The best bazars are the least crowded, though once in them it is  difficult to move, and the strings of asses laden with skins of water  are a great nuisance. The foot-passenger is also liable at any moment  to be ridden down by horsemen, or squeezed into a jelly by the passage  of caravans.    It is in the meat, vegetable, cotton, oil, grain, fruit, and fish  bazars that the throngs are busiest and noisiest, and though  cucumbers, the great joy of the Turkish palate, are over, vegetables  \"of sorts\" are abundant, and the slant, broken sunbeams fall on  pyramids of fruit, and glorify the warm colouring of melons, apples,  and pomegranates.    A melon of 10 lbs. weight can be got for a penny, a sheep for five or  six shillings, and fish for something like a farthing per pound, that  is the \"Fish of Tobias,\" the monster of the Tigris waters, which is  largely eaten by the poor. Poultry and game are also very cheap, and  the absolute necessaries of life, such as broken wheat for porridge,  oil, flour, and cheese, cost little.    Cook-shops abound, but their viands are not tempting, and the bazars  are pervaded by a pungent odour of hot sesamum oil and rancid fat,  frying being a usual mode of cooking in these restaurants. An  impassive Turk, silently smoking, sits cross-legged on a platform at  each Turkish shop door. He shows his goods as if he had no interest in  them, and whether he sells or not seems a matter of indifference, so  that he can return to his pipe. It is not to him that the overpowering  din is owing, but to the agitated eagerness of the other  nationalities.    The charm of the bazars lies in the variety of race and costume and in  the splendid _physique_ of the greater number of the men. The European  looks \"nowhere.\" The natural look of a Moslem is one of _hauteur_, but  no words can describe the scorn and lofty Pharisaism which sit on the  faces of the Seyyids, the descendants of Mohammed, whose hands and  even garments are kissed reverently as they pass through the crowd; or  the wrathful melancholy mixed with pride which gives a fierceness to  the dignified bearing of the magnificent beings who glide through the  streets, their white turbans or shawl head-gear, their gracefully  flowing robes, their richly embroidered under-vests, their Kashmir  girdles, their inlaid pistols, their silver-hilted dirks, and the  predominance of red throughout their clothing aiding the general  effect. Yet most of these grand creatures, with their lofty looks and  regal stride, would be accessible to a bribe, and would not despise  even a perquisite. These are the _mollahs_, the scribes, the traders,  and the merchants of the city.    The Bedouin and the city Arabs dress differently, and are among the  marked features of the streets. The under-dress is a very coarse shirt  of unbleached homespun cotton, rarely clean, over which the Sheikhs  and richer men wear a robe of striped silk or cotton with a Kashmir  girdle of a shawl pattern in red on a white ground. The poor wear  shirts of coarse hair or cotton, without a robe. The invariable  feature of Arab dress is the _abba_--a long cloak, sleeveless, but  with holes through which to pass the arms, and capable of many  adaptations. It conceals all superabundance and deficiency of attire,  and while it has the dignity of the _toga_ by day it has the utility  of a blanket by night. The better-class _abba_ is very hard, being  made of closely-woven worsted, in broad brown and white or black and  white perpendicular stripes. The poorest _abba_ is of coarse brown  worsted, and even of goat's-hair. I saw many men who were destitute of  any clothing but tattered _abbas_ tied round their waists by frayed  hair ropes. The _abba_ is the distinctive national costume of the  Arabs. The head-gear is not the turban but a shawl of very thick silk  woven in irregular stripes of yellow and red, with long cords and  tassels depending, made of the twisted woof. This handsome square is  doubled triangularly, the double end hangs down the back, and the  others over the shoulders. A loosely-twisted rope of camel's-hair is  wound several times round the crown of the head. When the weather is  cold, being like all Orientals very sensitive in their heads, they  bring one side of the shawl over the whole of the face but the eyes,  and tuck it in, in great cold only"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38828"],[0,"Journeys in Persia and Kurdistan, Volume 2 (of 2) (#7)"],[1,"  unusual in the East. I have more than once cautioned my servants on  this point, for any supposed insult to a female relative of a  Bakhtiari would have by custom to be wiped out in blood. This extreme  sensitiveness has its good side, for even in the midst of the tribal  wars and broils which are constantly occurring female honour is always  secure, and a woman can travel safely alone through the wildest  regions; a woman betraying her husband would, however, almost  certainly be put to death. One night the camps were threatened by  robbers, upon whom Aziz Khan fired.    Solitary as is now the general aspect of the surrounding country, it  must have been crowded with workmen and their food providers within  the last two centuries, for in the beginning of the seventeenth  century Shah Abbas the Great, the greatest and most patriotic of  modern Persian kings, in his anxiety to deliver Isfahan once for all  from the risk of famine, formed and partly executed the design of  turning to account the difference in level (about 300 feet) between  the Karun and Zainderud, and by cleaving an intervening mountain spur  to let the waters of the one pass into the other. The work of cleaving  was carried on by his successors, but either the workmen failed to get  through the flint which underlies the free-stone, or the downfall of  the Sufari dynasty made an end of it, and nothing remains of what  should have been a famous engineering enterprise but a huge cleft with  tool marks upon it in the crest of the hill, \"in length 300 yards, in  breadth fifteen, and fifty feet deep.\"[4] Above it are great heaps of  quarried stones and the remains of houses, possibly of overseers, and  below are the remnants of the dam which was to have diverted the Karun  water into the cleft.    On a cool, beautiful evening I came down from this somewhat mournful  height to a very striking scene, where the peacock-blue branch from  the Sar-i-Cheshmeh unites with the peacock-green stream from  Kuh-i-Rang, the dark, high sides of their channels shutting out the  mountains. Both rivers rush tumultuously above their union, but  afterwards glide downwards in a smooth, silent volume of most  exquisite colour, so deep as to be unfordable, and fringed with green  strips of grass and innumerable flowers. On emerging from the ravine  the noble mass of the Zard Kuh was seen rose-coloured in the sunset,  its crests and spires of snow cleaving the blue sky, and the bright  waters and flower-starred grass of the plain gave a smiling welcome  home.    The next march was a very beautiful one, most of the way over the  spurs and deeply-cleft ravines of the grand Kuh-i-Rang by sheep and  goat tracks, and no tracks at all, a lonely and magnificent ride, shut  in among mountains of great height, their spurs green with tamarisk,  salvias, and euphorbias, their ravines noisy with torrents, bright  springs bursting from their sides with lawn-like grass below, and  their slopes patched with acres of deep snow, on whose margin purple  crocuses, yellow ranunculuses, and white tulips were springing. But  the grand feature of the march is not the mighty Kuh-i-Rang on the  right, but the magnificent Zard Kuh on the left, uplifting its  snow-fields and snow-crests into the blue of heaven, on the other side  of an ever-narrowing valley. At the pass of Gal-i-Gav, 11,150 (?) feet  in altitude, where we have halted for two days, the Zard Kuh  approaches the Kuh-i-Rang so closely as to leave only a very deeply  cleft ravine between them. From this pass there is a very grand view,  not only of these ranges, but of a tremendous depression into which  the pass leads, beyond which is the fine definite mountain  Kuh-i-Shahan. This pass is the watershed between the Karun and  Ab-i-Diz, though, be it remembered, the latter eventually unites with  the former at Band-i-Kir. All is treeless.    The Kuh-i-Rang is the only \"real mountain\" seen on the journey  hitherto. It is unlike all others, not only in its huge bulk and  gigantic and far-reaching spurs, but in being _clothed_. Its name  means the \"variegated mountain.\" It has much Devonshire red about it,  but clad as it is now with greenery, its soil and rock ribs cannot be  investigated.    It is a mountain rich in waters, both streams and springs. It is  physically and geographically a centre, a sort of knot nearly uniting  what have been happily termed the \"Outer\" and \"Inner\" ranges of the  Bakhtiari mountains, and it manifestly divides the country into two  regions, which, for convenience' sake, have been felicitously termed  the Bakhtiari country and Upper Elam, the former lying to the  south-east and the latter to the north-west of this most important  group of peaks, only just under 13,000 feet, which passes under the  general name Kuh-i-Rang.    A prominent geographical feature of this region is that from this  point south-eastwards the valleys rim parallel with the great ranges,  and are tolerably wide and level, carrying the drainage easily and  smoothly, with plenty of room for the fairly easy tracks which usually  run on both banks of the rivers.    The reader who has followed the geographical part of my narrative  will, I hope, have perceived that the openings through the Outer and  Inner ranges in the region previously traversed are few and  remarkable, the Tang-i-Ghezi and the Tang-i-Darkash Warkash piercing  the Outer, and the Tang-i-Dupulan the Inner range.    The Kuh-i-Rang is the definite water-parting and the originating cause  of two drainage systems, and it may be seen from the map, as was  beautifully obvious from the summit of one of the peaks over 11,000  feet in height, that it marks a singular change in the \"lie of the  land,\" inasmuch as the main drainage no longer runs parallel to the  main ranges, but cuts them across, breaking up Upper Elam into a wild  and confused sea of mountains, riven and gashed, without any attempt  at uniformity.    This cutting through the ranges at right angles by rivers which  somehow must reach the sea, probably through channels formed by some  tremendous operations of nature, presents serious obstacles to the  traveller, and must effectually prevent commerce flowing in that  direction. The aspect of Upper Elam as seen from the Kuh-i-Rang is of  huge walls of naked rock, occasionally opening out so as to give space  for such a noble mountain as the Kuh-i-Shahan, with tremendous gorges  or canyons among them, with sheer precipices 4000 and 5000 feet high,  below which blue-green torrents, crystalline in their purity, rage and  boom, thundering on their way to join the Ab-i-Diz. The valleys are  short, and elevated from 6000 to 7000 feet, and the tracks dignified  by the name of roads pass along them and at great altitudes on the  sides of the main ranges, but are compelled continually to make dips  and ascents of many thousand feet to reach and emerge from the fords  of the rivers which dash through the magnificent rifts and canyons.    To the south-east of the Kuh-i-Rang the formation is orderly and  intelligible; to the north-west all is confusion and disorder, but a  sublime confusion. Two great passes to the north and south of this  magnificent mountain are the only ways of communication between the  region of Upper Elam and the Bakhtiari country. The northern pass was  ascended from Dima. The Kharba, one of the head-streams of the  Zainderud, rises on it and fertilises a beautiful valley about  fourteen miles in length. That pass, the Gal-i-Bard-i-Jamal (the pass  of Jamal's stone), the stone being a great detached rock near the  summit, and the Gal-i-Gav (the Cattle Pass) on the southern side, are  both over 10,000 feet in altitude. They are seldom traversed by the  natives, and only in well-armed parties, as both are very dangerous.    The Kuh-i-Rang must now be regarded as the true birthplace of the  Zainderud and the Karun, though their sources have hitherto been  placed in the Zard Kuh. A tributary of the Ab-i-Diz, and locally  considered as its head-water, rises also in the Kuh-i-Rang.      [Illustration: AZIZ KHAN.]    Aziz Khan, who had gone to his tents, has returned with a very nice  young servant and another mare, and with him noise and \"go.\" He has  such a definite personality, and is so energetic in his movements,  that the camps are dull without him. He is a fearful beggar. He asks  me for something every day, and for things he can make no possible use  of, simply out of acquisitiveness. He has got from me among many other  things a new embroidered saddle-cloth, a double-bladed knife, an  Indian _kamarband_, many yards of silk, a large pair of scissors,  bracelets for his wife and daughter, and working materials, and now he  has set his heart on a large combination knife, which is invaluable to  me. \"What use is that knife to a woman?\" he asks daily. Now he says  that I have given him many things but I have never given him money,  and he must have a purse of money.    \"Why can you do so much more than our women?\" he often asks. His  astonishment that I can read, and yet more that I can write, is most  amusing. \"Can many women in your country write?\" he asked. \"Can your  Queen read and write? Can she embroider as you do?\" At first he  thought that I only pretended to write, but was convinced when I sent  a letter to the Ilkhani.    He usually appears when a number of sick people come, interprets their  dialect into good Persian for Mirza, and beats and pelts them with  stones when they crowd too closely, but they do not care. Sometimes  when I say that nothing that I have can do a sick person any good he  begs \"for my sake\" that I will try, and when I still decline he goes  away in a tantrum, cursing, and shaking his wide _shulwars_ with an  angry strut, but is soon back again with fresh demands.    He spreads his prayer-carpet and goes through his devotions thrice a  day, but somehow \"Aziz Khan praying\" seems to suggest some ludicrous  idea, even to his co-reli"]]]
