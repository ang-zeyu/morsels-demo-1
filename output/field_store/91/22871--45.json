Our Army being thus possessed of the ground that  the enemy chose to fight upon, stood there all night; the enemy having  withdrawn their Army to the top of the hill for more security to  themselves, where they made great fires all the night long, whilst we in  the meantime drew backe some of our owne Ordnance, which they had once in  their possession, and some of their's which they had left behinde.    The next morning, a little before it was light, we drew back our Army  towards the Town to our other Brigadoe and Artillary and Ammunition that  was come and lodged there, and the enemy drew out their horse in the  morning upon the side of the hill, where staying till towards night,  whil'st the foot were retyring behinde the hill and marching away, at  length a little before night, their horse also marched away; and about an  houre after, our horse also marched towards their Quarters, the Foot and  some horse staying all night in their Quarters, in and before _Keynton_;  and the next day the whole Army both horse and foot marched towards  _Warwicke_ to refresh themselves; instead of which, if they had marched  towards _Banbury_, they would have found more victuals, and had in all  probabilities dispersed all the foot of the King's Army, and taken his  Canon and Carriages and sent his horse farther off to plunder, whereas now  because we did not follow them though they quitted the field to us which  we fought on and left their quarter before us the next day, yet they begin  to question who had the day: It is true, there were Colours and Canon  taken on both sides, without any great difference in the numbers, but for  the number and quality of men slaine and hurt, it is verily believed, they  left foure times as many at the least as we did, and in saying foure times  as many, I am confident I speake much below the truth. There were slaine  on their side the Earl of _Lindsey_ Generall of their Army, the Lord  _Aubigney_, brother to the Duke of _Richmond_, Sir _Edward Verny_  Colonell, _John Monroe_ and divers other gentlemen and Commanders, and  very many hurt. Of our side were slaine the Lord St. John, Colonell  _Charles Essex_, Lieutenant Colonell _Ramsey_ and none other of note,  either killed or dangerously hurt that I can heare of; They acknowledge  that they lost 1200 men, but it is thought they lost 2000: and whereas  they report we lost divers thousands, where one man judgeth that we lost  400, ten men are of opinion that we lost not 200 Souldiers, besides the  poore Waggoners and Carters.    These persons underwritten were all of the Right wing and never stirred  from their Troops but they and their Troops fought till the last minute.

Loving Cousin, I shall make so neare as I can a true, though long relation  of the battell fought betweene the King's Army and our Army, under the  conduct and command of my Lord Generall on Saturday _October_ 22. Our  Forces were quartered very late and did lie remote one from the other, and  my Lord Generall did quarter in a small Village where this Battell was  fought, in a field called Great Kings Field, taking the name from a  Battell there fought by King _John_ as they say: on Sunday the 23 of  _October_ about one of the clocke in the afternoon, the Battell did begin  and it continued untill it was very darke, the field was very great and  large, and the King's Forces came down a great and long hill, he had the  advantage of the ground and wind, and they did give a very brave charge,  and did fight very valiantly: they were 15 Regiments of Foot and 60  Regiments of Horse, our Horse were under 40 Regiments and our Foot 11  Regiments: my Lord Generall did give the first charge, pressing them with  2 pieces of Ordnance which killed many of their men, and then the enemy  did shoote one to us, which fell 20 yards short in a plowed Land, and did  no harme, our Souldiers did many of them run away to wit blew Coats and  Grey Coats, being two Regiments, and there did runne away, 600 horse, I  was quartered five miles from the place, and heard not anything of it,  until one of the clocke in the afternoone. I halted thither with Sergent  Major _Duglis'_ troope, and over-tooke one other troope, and when I was  entiring into the field, I thinke 200 horse came by me with all the speed  they could out from the battell, saying, that the King had the victory,  and that every man cried for God and King Charles. I entreated, prayed and  persuaded them to stay, and draw up in a body with our Troopes, for we saw  them fighting, and the Field was not lost, but no perswasions would serve,  and then I turning to our three troopes, two of them were runne away, and  of my Troope I had not six and thirtie men left, but they were likewise  runne away, I stayed with those men I had, being in a little field, and  there was a way through, and divers of the enemy did runne that way both  horse and foote, I tooke away about tenne or twelve horse, swords, and  armour, I could have killed 40 of the enemy, I let them passe disarming  them, and giving the spoile to my Troopers; the Armies were both in a  confusion, and I could not fall to them with out apparent loss of my selfe  and those which were with me, the powder which the Enemy had was blowne up  in the field, the Enemy ran away as well as our men, God did give the  victory to us, there are but three men of note slain of ours, namely my  Lord Saint _John_, Collonell _Essex_, and one other Captaine, whose name I  have forgot: Captaine Fleming is either slaine or taken prisoner, and his  Cornet, he had not one Officer which was a souldier, his Waggon and money  is lost, and divers of the Captaines money and Waggons are lost, to great  value, our foote and Dragooners were the greatest Pillagers, wee had the  King's Standard one houre and a halfe, and after lost it againe: Wee did  lose not above three hundred men, the enemy killed the Waggoners, women  and little boyes of twelve years of age, we tooke seventeene Colours and  five pieces of Ordnance, I believe there were not lesse than three  thousand of the enemy slaine, for they lay on their own ground, twenty,  and thirty of heapes together, the King did lose Lords, and a very great  many of Gentlemen, but the certaine number of the slaine cannot bee  knowne, we did take my Lord of _Lindsey_, Generall of the Foote, being  shot in the thigh, who dyed the Tuesday morning following, and his body is  sent away to be buryed, the Lo: _Willoughby_ his son was taken,  _Lunsford_, _Vavasour_, and others, being prisoners in Warwick Castle; on  Munday there did runne from the King's Army 3000, foote in 40, 50, and 60  in Companies, wee kept the field all Sunday night, and all Munday, and  then marched to our quarters, and on Munday the enemy would have given us  another charge, but they could not get the foote to fight, notwithstanding  they did beate them like dogs, this last Relation of the enemy I received  from one which was a prisoner and got away.    Banbury is taken by the King, there was 1000 Foote in it, the Captaines  did run away, and the souldiers did deliver the Toune up without  discharging one Musket. It was God's wonderful worke that we had the  victory, we expect to march after the King. The day after the Battell all  our Forces, horse and foote were marched up, and other forces from remote  parts, to the number of 5000, horse and foote more than were at the  Battell, now at my writing, my Lord Generall is at Warwick, upon our next  marching we doe expect another Battell, we here thinke that the King  cannot strengthen himself, for the souldiers did still runne daily from  him, and I believe if we come to fight a great part of them will never  come up to the charge.

Yet if these had not a soul, they would not  be objects of love. To love then, and to be beloved, was sweet to  me; but more, when I obtained to enjoy the person I loved, I defiled,  therefore, the spring of friendship with the filth of concupiscence, and  I beclouded its brightness with the hell of lustfulness; and thus  foul and unseemly, I would fain, through exceeding vanity, be fine  and courtly. I fell headlong then into the love wherein I longed to be  ensnared. My God, my Mercy, with how much gall didst Thou out of Thy  great goodness besprinkle for me that sweetness? For I was both beloved,  and secretly arrived at the bond of enjoying; and was with joy fettered  with sorrow-bringing bonds, that I might be scourged with the iron  burning rods of jealousy, and suspicions, and fears, and angers, and  quarrels.    Stage-plays also carried me away, full of images of my miseries, and of  fuel to my fire. Why is it, that man desires to be made sad, beholding  doleful and tragical things, which yet himself would no means suffer?  yet he desires as a spectator to feel sorrow at them, and this very  sorrow is his pleasure. What is this but a miserable madness? for a man  is the more affected with these actions, the less free he is from such  affections. Howsoever, when he suffers in his own person, it uses to be  styled misery: when he compassionates others, then it is mercy. But what  sort of compassion is this for feigned and scenical passions? for the  auditor is not called on to relieve, but only to grieve: and he applauds  the actor of these fictions the more, the more he grieves. And if the  calamities of those persons (whether of old times, or mere fiction)  be so acted, that the spectator is not moved to tears, he goes away  disgusted and criticising; but if he be moved to passion, he stays  intent, and weeps for joy.    Are griefs then too loved? Verily all desire joy. Or whereas no man  likes to be miserable, is he yet pleased to be merciful? which because  it cannot be without passion, for this reason alone are passions loved?  This also springs from that vein of friendship. But whither goes that  vein? whither flows it? wherefore runs it into that torrent of pitch  bubbling forth those monstrous tides of foul lustfulness, into which it  is wilfully changed and transformed, being of its own will precipitated  and corrupted from its heavenly clearness? Shall compassion then be  put away? by no means. Be griefs then sometimes loved. But beware of  uncleanness, O my soul, under the guardianship of my God, the God of our  fathers, who is to be praised and exalted above all for ever, beware of  uncleanness. For I have not now ceased to pity; but then in the theatres  I rejoiced with lovers when they wickedly enjoyed one another, although  this was imaginary only in the play. And when they lost one another, as  if very compassionate, I sorrowed with them, yet had my delight in both.  But now I much more pity him that rejoiceth in his wickedness, than him  who is thought to suffer hardship, by missing some pernicious pleasure,  and the loss of some miserable felicity. This certainly is the truer  mercy, but in it grief delights not. For though he that grieves for the  miserable, be commended for his office of charity; yet had he, who is  genuinely compassionate, rather there were nothing for him to grieve  for. For if good will be ill willed (which can never be), then may  he, who truly and sincerely commiserates, wish there might be some  miserable, that he might commiserate. Some sorrow may then be allowed,  none loved. For thus dost Thou, O Lord God, who lovest souls far more  purely than we, and hast more incorruptibly pity on them, yet are  wounded with no sorrowfulness. And who is sufficient for these things?    But I, miserable, then loved to grieve, and sought out what to grieve  at, when in another's and that feigned and personated misery, that  acting best pleased me, and attracted me the most vehemently, which  drew tears from me. What marvel that an unhappy sheep, straying from  Thy flock, and impatient of Thy keeping, I became infected with a foul  disease? And hence the love of griefs; not such as should sink deep into  me; for I loved not to suffer, what I loved to look on; but such as upon  hearing their fictions should lightly scratch the surface; upon which,  as on envenomed nails, followed inflamed swelling, impostumes, and a  putrefied sore. My life being such, was it life, O my God?    And Thy faithful mercy hovered over me afar. Upon how grievous  iniquities consumed I myself, pursuing a sacrilegious curiosity, that  having forsaken Thee, it might bring me to the treacherous abyss, and  the beguiling service of devils, to whom I sacrificed my evil actions,  and in all these things Thou didst scourge me! I dared even, while Thy  solemnities were celebrated within the walls of Thy Church, to desire,  and to compass a business deserving death for its fruits, for which Thou  scourgedst me with grievous punishments, though nothing to my fault,  O Thou my exceeding mercy, my God, my refuge from those terrible  destroyers, among whom I wandered with a stiff neck, withdrawing  further from Thee, loving mine own ways, and not Thine; loving a vagrant  liberty.    Those studies also, which were accounted commendable, had a view to  excelling in the courts of litigation; the more bepraised, the craftier.  Such is men's blindness, glorying even in their blindness. And now I  was chief in the rhetoric school, whereat I joyed proudly, and I swelled  with arrogancy, though (Lord, Thou knowest) far quieter and altogether  removed from the subvertings of those \"Subverters\" (for this ill-omened  and devilish name was the very badge of gallantry) among whom I lived,  with a shameless shame that I was not even as they. With them I lived,  and was sometimes delighted with their friendship, whose doings I ever  did abhor--i.e., their \"subvertings,\" wherewith they wantonly persecuted  the modesty of strangers, which they disturbed by a gratuitous jeering,  feeding thereon their malicious birth. Nothing can be liker the very  actions of devils than these. What then could they be more truly called  than \"Subverters\"? themselves subverted and altogether perverted first,  the deceiving spirits secretly deriding and seducing them, wherein  themselves delight to jeer at and deceive others.    Among such as these, in that unsettled age of mine, learned I books  of eloquence, wherein I desired to be eminent, out of a damnable and  vainglorious end, a joy in human vanity. In the ordinary course of  study, I fell upon a certain book of Cicero, whose speech almost all  admire, not so his heart. This book of his contains an exhortation  to philosophy, and is called \"Hortensius.\" But this book altered my  affections, and turned my prayers to Thyself O Lord; and made me have  other purposes and desires. Every vain hope at once became worthless to  me; and I longed with an incredibly burning desire for an immortality of  wisdom, and began now to arise, that I might return to Thee. For not  to sharpen my tongue (which thing I seemed to be purchasing with my  mother's allowances, in that my nineteenth year, my father being dead  two years before), not to sharpen my tongue did I employ that book; nor  did it infuse into me its style, but its matter.    How did I burn then, my God, how did I burn to re-mount from earthly  things to Thee, nor knew I what Thou wouldest do with me? For with Thee  is wisdom. But the love of wisdom is in Greek called \"philosophy,\"  with which that book inflamed me. Some there be that seduce through  philosophy, under a great, and smooth, and honourable name colouring and  disguising their own errors: and almost all who in that and former ages  were such, are in that book censured and set forth: there also is  made plain that wholesome advice of Thy Spirit, by Thy good and devout  servant: Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain  deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world,  and not after Christ. For in Him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead  bodily. And since at that time (Thou, O light of my heart, knowest)  Apostolic Scripture was not known to me, I was delighted with that  exhortation, so far only, that I was thereby strongly roused, and  kindled, and inflamed to love, and seek, and obtain, and hold, and  embrace not this or that sect, but wisdom itself whatever it were; and  this alone checked me thus unkindled, that the name of Christ was not  in it. For this name, according to Thy mercy, O Lord, this name of  my Saviour Thy Son, had my tender heart, even with my mother's milk,  devoutly drunk in and deeply treasured; and whatsoever was without that  name, though never so learned, polished, or true, took not entire hold  of me.    I resolved then to bend my mind to the holy Scriptures, that I might see  what they were. But behold, I see a thing not understood by the proud,  nor laid open to children, lowly in access, in its recesses lofty, and  veiled with mysteries; and I was not such as could enter into it, or  stoop my neck to follow its steps. For not as I now speak, did I feel  when I turned to those Scriptures; but they seemed to me unworthy to be  compared to the stateliness of Tully: for my swelling pride shrunk from  their lowliness, nor could my sharp wit pierce the interior thereof. Yet  were they such as would grow up in a little one. But I disdained to be a  little one; and, swollen with pride, took myself to be a great one.    Therefore I fell among men proudly doting, exceeding carnal and prating,  in whose mouths were the snares of the Devil, limed with the mixture of  the syllables of Thy name, and of our Lord Jesus Christ, and of the Holy  Ghost, the Paraclete, our Comforter. These names departed not out of  their mouth, but so far forth as the sound only and the noise of the  tongue, for"]]]
