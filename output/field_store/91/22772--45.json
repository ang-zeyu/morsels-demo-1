In the mean time we moved to Berlin and this has been our home ever  since, so you see I have seen far more of Germany than of my native  country, Spain. In fact, it seems more natural for me to speak German  than Spanish. At the age of seven it was my good fortune to come under  the instruction of Alberto Jonas, the Spanish virtuoso, who for many  years was at the head of a large music school in America. I can never be  grateful enough to him, for he has taught me without remuneration and  not even a father could be kinder to me. When I left Berlin for my  present tour, tears came to our eyes, because I knew I was leaving my  best friend. Most of my present repertory has been acquired under Jonas  and he has been so, so exacting.    He also saw to it that my training was broad, and not confined to those  composers whose works appealed most to me. The result is that I now  appreciate the works of all the composers for the piano. Beethoven I  found very absorbing. I learned the _Appassionata Sonata_ in one week's  time, and longed for more. My teacher, however, insisted upon my going  slowly, and mastering all the little details.    I have also developed a great fondness for Bach, because I like to find  how he winds his melodies in and out, and makes such beautiful things of  them. I play a great deal of Bach, including the G minor organ Fugue,  which Liszt played the devil with in arranging it for the piano.  Goodness knows, it was difficult enough for the organ in its original  form! I don't see why Liszt wanted to make it more difficult.    Liszt is, of course, considered a great master for the piano, and I play  his works with great delight, especially the _Campanella_ with its  beautiful bell effect, but I cannot look upon Liszt as a pianistic  composer in the same way that one thinks of Chopin as a pianistic  composer. The piano was Chopin's natural tongue. Liszt's tongue, like  that of Beethoven, was the orchestra. He knew no difficulties, according  to the manner in which he wrote his own works. Consequently one must  think of the orchestra in playing Liszt's works, while the works of  Chopin suggest only the piano.      MY DAILY PRACTICE    During most of my life my practice has never exceeded two hours a day.  In this country, while on tour, I never practice more than one and  one-half hours. This is not necessary, because of the concerts  themselves, which keep up my technical work. I never worry about my  fingers. If I can think the pieces right, my fingers will always play  the notes. My mother insists upon my being out in the open air all the  time I am not studying and practicing, and I am out the better part of  the day.    At my practice periods, I devote at least fifteen or twenty minutes to  technical exercises, and strive to play all the scales, in the different  forms, in all the keys, once each day. I then play some of my concert  numbers, continually trying to note if there is any place that requires  attention. If there is, I at once spend a little time trying to improve  the passage.    It is very largely a matter of thinking the musical thought right, and  then saying it in the right way. If you think it right, and your aim at  the keyboard is good, you are not likely to hit the wrong notes, even in  skips such as one finds in the Rubinstein Valse in E flat. I do not ever  remember of hitting the upper note wrong. It all seems so easy to me  that I am sure that if other children in America would look upon other  examples in the same way, they could not find their work so very  difficult. I love to practice Chopin. One cannot be so intimate with  Bach; he is a little cold and unfriendly until one knows him very well.      GENERAL EDUCATION    I have said that we play as we think. The mind must be continually  improved or the fingers will grow dull. In order to see the beauties in  music we must see the beauties in other studies. I have a private  teacher who comes to me in Berlin and teaches me different studies. I  have studied some Latin, French, and the regular school studies.  Electricity interests me more than I can tell you and I like to learn  about it, but my greatest interest is in the study of astronomy. Surely  nothing could be finer than to look at the stars. I have friends among  the astronomers of Berlin who let me look through their telescopes and  tell me all about the different constellations and the worlds that look  like moons when you see them enlarged. It is all so wonderful that it  makes one never cease thinking.    I also like to go to factories and learn how different things are made.  I think that there are so many things that one can learn outside of a  school-room. For instance, I went to a wire factory recently, and I am  sure that I found out a great many things I might never have found out  in books. One also learns by traveling, and when I am on my tours I feel  that I learn more of the different people and the way they live than I  ever could from geographies. Don't you think I am a lucky boy? One must  study geography, however, to learn about maps and the way in which  countries are formed. I have toured in Germany, Russia, and England, and  now in America. America interests me wonderfully. Everything seems so  much alive and I like the climate very much.      THEORETICAL STUDIES    Musical theory bores me now, almost as much as my first technical  studies did. Richard Strauss, the great German composer, has very kindly  offered to teach me. I like him very much and he is so kind, but his  thundering musical effects sometimes seems very noisy to me. I know many  of the rules of harmony, but they are very uncomfortable and  disagreeable to me.    I would far rather write my music as it comes to me. Herr Nikisch says  that when I do it that way, I make very few blunders, but I know I can  never be a composer until I have mastered all the branches of musical  theory. I am now writing a symphony. I played some parts for Herr  Nikisch and he has agreed to produce it. Of course, the orchestral parts  will have to be written for me, but I know what instruments I want to  express certain ideas.    Putting down the notes upon paper is so tiresome. Why can't one think  the musical thoughts and have them preserved without the tedious work of  writing them out! Sometimes before I can get them on paper they are  gone--no one knows where, and the worst of all is that they never come  back. It is far greater fun to play the piano, or play football, or go  rowing.      READING AND STUDY    I love to read, and my favorite of all books is _The Three Musketeers_.  I have also read something of Shakespeare, Goethe, Schiller, and many  other writers. I like parts of the great Spanish novel _Don Quixote_,  but I find it hard to read as a whole. I think that music students ought  to read a great deal. It makes them think, and it gives them poetical  thoughts.    Music is, after all, only another kind of poetry, and if we get poetical  ideas from books we become more poetical, and our music becomes more  beautiful. The student who thinks only of hammering down keys at the  piano cannot play in a manner in which people will take pleasure. Piano  playing is so much more than merely pressing down keys. One has to tell  people things that cannot be told in words--that is what music is.      AT THE CONCERT    I do not know what it is to be nervous at concerts. I have played so  much and I am always so sure of what I am going to play that nervousness  is out of the question. Of course, I am anxious about the way in which  audiences will receive my playing. I want to please them so much and  don't want them to applaud me because I am a boy, but would rather have  them come as real music-lovers to enjoy the music itself. If I cannot  bring pleasure to them in that way I do not deserve to be before the  public.    My concerts are usually about one hour in length, although I sometimes  play encores for some time after the concert. I make it a practice not  to eat for a few hours before the concert, as doctors have told my  mother that my mind will be in better shape. I want to thank the many  friends I have made among the students who have come to my concerts, and  I hope that I may have told them some things which will help them in  their work.

[Illustration: WILHELM BACHAUS]    WILHELM BACHAUS    BIOGRAPHICAL      Wilhelm Bachaus was born at Leipsic, March 24, 1884, two years before  the death of Franz Liszt. Nine years younger than Josef Hofmann and a  trifle more than one-half the age of Paderewski he represents a  different decade from that of other pianists included in this work.  Bachaus studied for nine years with Alois Reckendorf, a Moravian teacher  who was connected with the Leipsic Conservatory for more than thirty  years. Reckendorf had been a student of science and philosophy at the  Vienna and the Heidelberg Universities and was an earnest musician and  teacher with theories of his own. He took an especial interest in  Bachaus and was his only teacher with the exception of one year spent  with d'Albert and \"three lessons with Siloti.\" Although Bachaus  commenced"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28039"],[0,"History of Woman Suffrage, Volume II (#7)"],[1,"  by the pirate cruiser _Retribution_, was the Union brigantine, _J. P.  Ellicott_, of Bucksport, Maine, the wives of the captain and mate  being on board. Her officers and crew were transferred to the pirate  vessel and ironed, while a crew from the latter was put on the  brigantine; the wife of the mate was left on board the brig with the  pirate crew. Having cause to fear bad treatment at the hands of the  prize-master[23] and his mate, this woman formed the bold plan of  capturing the vessel. She succeeded in getting the officers  intoxicated, handcuffed them and took possession of the vessel,  persuading the crew, who were mostly colored men from St. Thomas, to  aid her. Having studied navigation with her husband on the voyage, she  assumed command of the brig, directing its course to St. Thomas, which  she reached in safety, placing the vessel in the hands of the United  States Consul, who transferred the prize-master, mate, and crew to a  United States steamer, as prisoners of war. Her name was not given,  but had this bold feat been accomplished by a man or boy, the country  would have rung with praises of the daring deed, and history would  have borne the echoes down to future generations.    Not alone on the tented field did the war find its patriotic victims.  Many women showed their love of country by sacrifices still greater  than enlistment in the army. Among these, especially notable for her  surroundings and family, was Annie Carter Lee, daughter of Gen. Robert  E. Lee, Commander-in-Chief of the rebel army. Her father and three  brothers fought against the Union which she loved, and to which she  adhered. A young girl, scarcely beyond her teens when the war broke  out, she remained firm in her devotion to the National cause, though  for this adherence she was banished by her father as an outcast from  that elegant home once graced by her presence. She did not live to see  the triumph of the cause she loved so well, dying the third year of  the war, aged twenty-three, at Jones Springs, North Carolina,  homeless, because of her love for the Union, with no relative near  her, dependent for care and consolation in her last hours upon the  kindly services of an old colored woman. In her veins ran pure the  blood of \"Light-Horse Harry\" and that of her great aunt, Hannah Lee  Corbin, who at the time of the Revolution, protested against the  denial of representation to taxpaying women, and whose name does much  to redeem that of Lee from the infamy, of late so justly adhering to  it. When her father, after the war, visited his ancestral home,[24]  then turned into a vast national cemetery, it would seem as though  the spirit of his Union-loving daughter must have floated over him,  whispering of his wrecked hopes, and piercing his heart with a  thousand daggers of remorse as he recalled his blind infatuation, and  the banishment from her home of that bright young life.    Of the three hundred and twenty-eight thousand Union soldiers who lie  buried in national cemeteries, many thousands with headboards marked  \"Unknown,\" hundreds are those of women obliged by army regulations to  fight in disguise. Official records of the military authorities show  that a large number of women recruits were discovered and compelled to  leave the army. A much greater number escaped detection, some of them  passing entirely through the campaigns, while others were made known  by wounds or on being found lifeless upon the battle-field. The  history of the war--which has never yet been truly written--is full of  heroism in which woman is the central figure.    The social and political condition of women was largely changed by our  civil war. Through the withdrawal of so many men from their accustomed  work, new channels of industry were opened to them, the value and  control of money learned, thought upon political questions compelled,  and a desire for their own personal, individual liberty intensified.  It created a revolution in woman herself, as important in its results  as the changed condition of the former slaves, and this silent  influence is still busy. Its work will not have been accomplished  until the chains of ignorance and selfishness are everywhere broken,  and woman shall stand by man's side his recognized equal in rights as  she is now in duties.      CLARA BARTON.    MINISTERING ON THE FIELD OF BATTLE.    Clara Barton was the youngest child of Capt. Stephen Barton, of  Oxford, Mass., a non-commissioned officer under \"Mad Anthony Wayne.\"  Captain Barton, who was a prosperous farmer and leader in public  affairs, gave his children the best opportunities he could secure for  their improvement. Clara's early education was principally at home  under direction of her brothers and sisters. At sixteen, she commenced  teaching, and followed the occupation for several years, during which  time she assisted her oldest brother, Capt. Stephen Barton, Jr., a man  of fine scholarship and business capacity, in equitably arranging and  increasing the salaries of the large village schools of her native  place, at the same time having clerical oversight of her brother's  counting-house. Subsequently, she finished her school education by a  very thorough course of study at Clinton, N. Y. Miss Barton's  remarkable executive ability was manifested in the fact that she  popularized the Public School System in New Jersey, by opening the  first free school in Bordentown, commencing with six pupils, in an old  tumble-down building, and at the close of the year, leaving six  hundred in the fine edifice at present occupied.    At the close of her work in Bordentown, she went to Washington, D. C.,  to recuperate and indulge herself in congenial literary pursuits.  There she was, without solicitation, appointed by Hon. Charles Mason,  Commissioner of Patents, to the first independent clerkship held by a  woman under our Government. Her thoroughness and faithfulness fitted  her eminently for this position of trust, which she retained until  after the election of President Buchanan, when, being suspected of  Republican sentiments, and Judge Mason having resigned, she was  deposed, and a large part of her salary withheld. She returned to  Massachusetts and spent three years in the study of art,  belles-lettres, and languages. Shortly after the election of Abraham  Lincoln, she was recalled to the Patent Office by the same  administration which had removed her. She returned, as she had left,  without question, and taking up her line of duty, awaited  developments.    When the civil war commenced, she refused to draw her salary from a  treasury already overtaxed, resigned her clerkship and devoted herself  to the assistance of suffering soldiers. Her work commencing before  the organization of Commissions, was continued outside and altogether  independent of them, but always with most cordial sympathy. Miss  Barton never engaged in hospital service. Her chosen labors were on  the battle-field from the beginning, until the wounded and dead were  attended to. Her supplies were her own, and were carried by Government  transportation. Nearly four years she endured the exposures and rigors  of soldier life, in action, always side by side with the field  surgeons, and this on the hardest fought fields; such battles as Cedar  Mountain, second Bull Run, Chantilly, Antietam, Falmouth, and old  Fredericksburg, siege of Charleston, on Morris Island, at Wagner,  Wilderness and Spotsylvania, The Mine, Deep Bottom, through sieges of  Petersburg and Richmond, with Butler and Grant; through summer without  shade, and winter without shelter, often weak, but never so far  disabled as to retire from the field; always under fire in severe  battles; her clothing pierced with bullets and torn by shot, exposed  at all times, but never wounded.    Firm in her integrity to the Union, never swerving from her belief in  the justice of the cause for which the North was fighting, on the  battle-field she knew no North, no South; she made her work one of  humanity alone, bestowing her charities and her care indiscriminately  upon the Blue and the Gray, with an impartiality and Spartan firmness  that astonished the foe and perplexed the friend, often falling under  suspicion, or censure of Union officers unacquainted with her motives  and character for her tender care and firm protection of the wounded  captured in battle. Their home-thrusts were met with the same calm  courage as were the bullets of the enemy, and many a Confederate  soldier lives to bless her for care and life, while no Union man will  ever again doubt her loyalty. All unconsciously to herself she was  carrying out to the letter in practice the grand and beautiful  principles of the Red Cross of Geneva (of which she had never heard),  for the entire _neutrality_ of war relief among the nations of the  earth, that great international step toward a world-wide recognized  humanity, of which she has since become the national advocate and  leader in this country.    [Illustration: Clara Barton. \"Very Sincerely Yours Clara Barton.\"]    At the close of the war she met exchanged prisoners at Annapolis.  Accompanied by Dorrence Atwater, she conducted an expedition, sent at  her request by the United States Government to identify and mark the  graves of the 13,000 soldiers who perished at Andersonville. From  Savannah to that point, as theirs were the first trains which had  passed since the destruction of the railroads by Sherman, they were  obliged to repair the bridges and the embankments, straighten bent  rails, and in some places make new roads. The work was completed in  August, 1865, and her report of the expedition was issued in the  winter of 1866.    The anxiety felt by the whole country for the fate of those whom the  exchange of prisoners and the disbanding of troops failed to reveal,  stimulated her to devise the plan of relief, which, sanctioned by  President Lincoln, resulted in the \"search for "]]]
