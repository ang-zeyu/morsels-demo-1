Thus you see my RECOMPENSE OF REWARD is as the  land of Canaan was to the Jews, resting a long while in promise. If the  Nations with whom I have to contend are not as numerous as those opposed  to the Israelites, they are certainly much greater HEATHENS, having  their hearts hardened and their understanding blinded, to make,  propagate and believe all manner of lies.

A  contract had been made with the State of Tennessee which now hangs  SUSPENDED. Two attempts have been made to induce the State of No.  Carolina to RECIND their CONTRACT, neither of which have succeeded. Thus  you see Brother Steb.

They have spent  much time, MONEY and CREDIT, to avoid giving me a small compensation,  for that which to them is worth millions.\"      Meanwhile North Carolina had agreed to buy the rights for the State  on terms that yielded Whitney about thirty thousand dollars, and it is  estimated that he received about ten thousand dollars from Tennessee,  making his receipts in all about ninety thousand dollars, before  deducting costs of litigation and other losses. The cotton gin was not  profitable to its inventor. And yet no invention in history ever so  suddenly transformed an industry and created enormous wealth. Eight  years before Whitney's invention, eight bales of cotton, landed at  Liverpool, were seized on the ground that so large a quantity of cotton  could not have been produced in the United States. The year before that  invention the United States exported less than one hundred and forty  thousand pounds of cotton; the year after it, nearly half a million  pounds; the next year over a million and a half; a year later still,  over six million; by 1800, nearly eighteen million pounds a year. And  by 1845 the United States was producing producing seven-eighths of the  world's cotton. Today the United States produces six to eight billion  pounds of cotton annually, and ninety-nine per cent of this is the  upland or green-seed cotton, which is cleaned on the Whitney type of gin  and was first made commercially available by Whitney's invention.*         * Roe, \"English and American Tool Builders\", pp. 150-51.      More than half of this enormous crop is still exported in spite of the  great demand at home. Cotton became and has continued to be the greatest  single export of the United States. In ordinary years its value is  greater than the combined value of the three next largest exports. It  is on cotton that the United States has depended for the payment of its  trade balance to Europe.    Other momentous results followed on the invention of the cotton gin. In  1793 slavery seemed a dying institution, North and South. Conditions of  soil and climate made slavery unprofitable in the North. On many of  the indigo, rice, and tobacco plantations in the South there were  more slaves than could be profitably employed, and many planters were  thinking of emancipating their slaves, when along came this simple but  wonderful machine and with it the vision of great riches in cotton; for  while slaves could not earn their keep separating the cotton from its  seeds by hand, they could earn enormous profits in the fields, once the  difficulty of extracting the seeds was solved. Slaves were no longer a  liability but an asset. The price of \"field hands\" rose, and continued  to rise. If the worn-out lands of the seaboard no longer afforded  opportunity for profitable employment, the rich new lands of the  Southwest called for laborers, and yet more laborers. Taking slaves with  them, younger sons pushed out into the wilderness, became possessed of  great tracts of fertile land, and built up larger plantations than those  upon which they had been born. Cotton became King of the South.    The supposed economic necessity of slave labor led great men to defend  slavery, and politics in the South became largely the defense of slavery  against the aggression, real or fancied, of the free North. The rift  between the sections became a chasm. Then came the War of Secession.    Though Miller was dead, Whitney carried on the fight for his rights  in Georgia. His difficulties were increased by a patent which the  Government at Philadelphia issued in May, 1796, to Hogden Holmes, a  mechanic of Augusta, for an improvement in the cotton gin. The Holmes  machines were soon in common use, and it was against the users of these  that many of the suits for infringement were brought. Suit after suit  ran its course in the Georgia courts, without a single decision in the  inventor's favor. At length, however, in December, 1806, the validity of  Whitney's patent was finally determined by decision of the United States  Circuit Court in Georgia. Whitney asked for a perpetual injunction  against the Holmes machine, and the court, finding that his invention  was basic, granted him all that he asked.    By this time, however, the life of the patent had nearly run its course.  Whitney applied to Congress for a renewal, but, in spite of all his  arguments and a favorable committee report, the opposition from the  cotton States proved too strong, and his application was denied. Whitney  now had other interests. He was a great manufacturer of firearms, at New  Haven, and as such we shall meet him again in a later chapter.        CHAPTER III. STEAM IN CAPTIVITY    For the beginnings of the enslavement of steam, that mighty giant whose  work has changed the world we live in, we must return to the times of  Benjamin Franklin. James Watt, the accredited father of the modern steam  engine, was a contemporary of Franklin, and his engine was twenty-one  years old when Franklin died. The discovery that steam could be  harnessed and made to work is not, of course, credited to James Watt.  The precise origin of that discovery is unknown. The ancient Greeks had  steam engines of a sort, and steam engines of another sort were pumping  water out of mines in England when James Watt was born. James Watt,  however, invented and applied the first effective means by which steam  came to serve mankind. And so the modern steam engine begins with him.    The story is old, of how this Scottish boy, James Watt, sat on the  hearth in his mother's cottage, intently watching the steam rising  from the mouth of the tea kettle, and of the great role which this boy  afterwards assumed in the mechanical world. It was in 1763, when he was  twenty-eight and had the appointment of mathematical-instrument maker  to the University of Glasgow, that a model of Newcomen's steam pumping  engine was brought into his shop for repairs. One can perhaps imagine  the feelings with which James Watt, interested from his youth in  mechanical and scientific instruments, particularly those which dealt  with steam, regarded this Newcomen engine. Now his interest was  vastly quickened. He set up the model and operated it, noticed how  the alternate heating and cooling of its cylinder wasted power, and  concluded, after some weeks of experiment, that, in order to make the  engine practicable, the cylinder must be kept hot, \"always as hot as the  steam which entered it.\" Yet in order to condense the steam there must  be a cooling of the vessel. The problem was to reconcile these two  conditions.    At length the pregnant idea occurred to him--the idea of the separate  condenser. It came to him on a Sunday afternoon in 1765, as he walked  across Glasgow Green. If the steam were condensed in a vessel separate  from the cylinder, it would be quite possible to keep the condensing  vessel cool and the cylinder hot at the same time. Next morning Watt  began to put his scheme to the test and found it practicable. He  developed other ideas and applied them. So at last was born a steam  engine that would work and multiply man's energies a thousandfold.    After one or two disastrous business experiences, such as fall to the  lot of many great inventors, perhaps to test their perseverance,  Watt associated himself with Matthew Boulton, a man of capital and of  enterprise, owner of the Soho Engineering Works, near Birmingham. The  firm of Boulton and Watt became famous, and James Watt lived till August  19, 1819--lived to see his steam engine the greatest single factor in  the new industrial era that had dawned for English-speaking folk.    Boulton and Watt, however, though they were the pioneers, were by no  means alone in the development of the steam engine. Soon there were  rivals in the field with new types of engines. One of these was Richard  Trevithick in England; another was Oliver Evans of Philadelphia. Both  Trevithick and Evans invented the high-pressure engine. Evans appears to  have applied the high pressure principle before Trevithick, and it has  been said that Trevithick borrowed it from Evans, but Evans himself  never said so, and it is more likely that each of these inventors worked  it out independently. Watt introduced his steam to the cylinder at only  slightly more than atmospheric pressure and clung tenaciously to the  low-pressure theory all his life. Boulton and Watt, indeed, aroused  by Trevithick's experiments in high-pressure engines, sought to have  Parliament pass an act forbidding high pressure on the ground that the  lives of the public were endangered. Watt lived long enough, however, to  see the high-pressure steam engine come into general favor, not only in  America but even in his own "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29031"],[0,"Sir William Herschel: His Life and Works (#7)"],[1,"_Uranus_, or, as HERSCHEL named it, _Georgium Sidus_.  He had found it on the night of Tuesday, March 13, 1781. \"In examining  the small stars in the neighborhood of H _Geminorum_, I perceived one that  appeared visibly larger than the rest; being struck with its uncommon  appearance, I compared it to H _Geminorum_ and the small star in the  quartile between _Auriga_ and _Gemini_, and finding it so much larger  than either of them, I suspected it to be a comet.\" The \"comet\" was  observed over all Europe. Its orbit was computed by various astronomers,  and its distance from the sun was found to be nineteen times that of our  earth. This was no comet, but a new major planet. The discovery of the  amateur astronomer of Bath was the most striking since the invention of  the telescope. It had absolutely no parallel, for every other major  planet had been known from time immemorial.[13]    The effect of the discoveries of GALILEO was felt almost more in the  moral than in the scientific world. The mystic number of the planets was  broken up by the introduction of four satellites to _Jupiter_. That  _Venus_ emulated the phases of our moon, overthrew superstition and  seated the Copernican theory firmly. The discovery of \"an innumerable  multitude of fixed stars\" in the Milky Way confounded the received  ideas. This was the great mission of the telescope in GALILEO'S hands.    The epoch of mere astronomical discovery began with the detection of the  large satellite of _Saturn_ by HUYGHENS, in 1655. Even then superstition  was not dead. HUYGHENS did not search for more moons, because by that  discovery he had raised the number of known satellites to six,[14] and  because these, with the six planets, made \"the perfect number twelve.\"    From 1671 to 1684 CASSINI discovered four more moons revolving about  _Saturn_. Since 1684 no new body had been added to the solar system.  It was thought complete for nearly a century.    In England, the remarkable discoveries of BRADLEY (1727-62) had been in  the field of practical astronomy, and his example had set the key-note  for further researches. France was just about beginning the brilliant  period of her discoveries in mathematical astronomy, and had no  observatory devoted to investigations like HERSCHEL'S, with the possible  exception of DARQUIER'S and FLAUGERGUES'. The observatories of SCHROETER  and VON HAHN, in Germany, were not yet active. The field which HERSCHEL  was created to fill was vacant, the whole world over. It was especially  so in England. The Royal Observatory at Greenwich, under MASKELYNE,  a skilful observer, whose work was mostly confined to meridian  observations, was no rival to a private observatory like HERSCHEL'S. The  private observatories themselves were but small affairs; those of the  king, at Kew, of Dr. WILSON, at Glasgow, of Mr. AUBERT, at Loampit Hill,  of the Count VON BRUHL, in London, being perhaps the most important.  The whole field was open. What was perhaps more remarkable, there was in  England, during HERSCHEL'S lifetime, no astronomer, public or private,  whose talents, even as an observer, lay in the same direction.    It hardly need be said that as a philosopher in his science, he had then  no rival, as he has had none since. His only associates even, were  MICHELL and WILSON.[15]    Without depreciating the abilities of the astronomers of England, his  cotemporaries, we may fairly say that HERSCHEL stood a great man among a  group of small ones.    Let us endeavor to appreciate the change effected in the state of  astronomy not only in England but in the whole world, simply by the  discovery of _Uranus_. Suppose, for example, that the last planet in our  system had been _Saturn_. No doubt HERSCHEL would have gone on. In spite  of one and another difficulty, he would have made his ten-foot, his  twenty-foot telescopes. His forty-foot would never have been built, and  the two satellites which he found with it might not have been  discovered. Certainly _Mimas_ would not have been. His researches on the  construction of the heavens would have been made; those were in his  brain, and must have been ultimated. The mass of observations of  _Saturn_, of _Jupiter_, of _Mars_, of _Venus_, would have been made and  published. The researches on the sun, on the \"invisible rays\" of heat,  on comets and nebulae--all these might have been made, printed, and read.    But these would have gone into the _Philosophical Transactions_ as the  work of an amateur astronomer, \"Mr. HERSCHEL, of Bath.\" They would have  been praised, and they would have been doubted. It would have taken a  whole generation to have appreciated them. They would have been severely  tried, entirely on their merits, and finally they would have stood where  they stand to-day--unrivalled. But through what increased labors these  successes would have been gained! It is not merely that the patronage of  the king, the subsidies for the forty-foot telescope (L4,000), the  comparative ease of HERSCHEL'S life would have been lacking. It is more  than this. It would have been necessary for him to have created the  audience to which he appealed, and to have conquered the most persistent  of enemies--indifference.    Certainly, if HERSCHEL'S mind had been other than it was, the discovery  of _Uranus_, which brought him honors from every scientific society in  the world, and which gave him authority, might have had a hurtful  effect. But, as he was, there was nothing which could have aided his  career more than this startling discovery. It was needed for him. It  completed the solar system far more by affording a free play to a  profoundly philosophical mind, than by occupying the vacant spaces  beyond _Saturn_.    His opportunities would have been profoundly modified, though his  personal worth would have been the same.        \"The Star that from the zenith darts its beams,      Visible though it be to half the earth,      Though half a sphere be conscious of its brightness,      Is yet of no diviner origin,      No purer essence, than the One that burns      Like an untended watchfire, on the ridge      Of some dark mountain; or than those that seem      Humbly to hang, like twinkling winter lamps,      Among the branches of the leafless trees.\"    To show how completely unknown the private astronomer of Bath was at  this time, I transcribe a sentence from BODE'S account of the discovery  of _Uranus_.        \"In the _Gazette Litteraire_ of June, 1781, this worthy man is      called MERSTHEL; in JULIUS' _Journal Encyclopedique_, HERTSCHEL;      in a letter from Mr. MASKELYNE to M. MESSIER, HERTHEL; in another      letter of MASKELYNE'S to Herr MAYER, at Mannheim, HERRSCHELL; M.      DARQUIER calls him HERMSTEL. What may his name be? He must have been      born a _German_.\"[16]    This obscurity did not long continue. The news spread quickly from  fashionable Bath to London. On the 6th of December, 1781, HERSCHEL was  elected a Fellow of the Royal Society, to which he was formally  \"admitted\" May 30, 1782. He was forty-three years old.    He also received the Copley medal in 1781 for his \"discovery of a new  and singular star.\"[17]        . . . \"He was now frequently interrupted by visitors who were      introduced by some of his resident scholars, among whom I remember      Sir HARRY ENGELFIELD, Dr. BLAGDEN, and Dr. MASKELYNE. With the      latter he was engaged in a long conversation, which to me sounded      like quarrelling, and the first words my brother said after he was      gone were: 'That is a devil of a fellow.'. . .        \"I suppose their names were often not known, or were forgotten; for      it was not till the year 1782 or 1783 that a memorandum of the names      of visitors was thought of.\". . . \"My brother now applied himself to      perfect his mirrors, erecting in his garden a stand for his      twenty-foot telescope; many trials were necessary before the      required motions for such an unwieldy machine could be contrived.      Many attempts were made by way of experiment before an intended      thirty-foot telescope could be completed, for which, between whiles      (not interrupting the observations with seven, ten, and twenty-foot,      and writing papers for both the Royal and Bath Philosophical      Societies), gauges, shapes, weight, etc., of the mirror were      calculated, and trials of the composition of the metal were made. In      short, I saw nothing else and heard nothing else talked of but these      things when my brothers were together. ALEX. was always very alert,      assisting when anything new was going forward, but he wanted      perseverance, and never liked to confine himself at home for many      hours together. And so it happened that my brother WILLIAM was      obliged to make trial of my abilities in copying for him catalogues,      tables, etc., and sometimes whole papers which were lent him for his      perusal. Among them was one by Mr. MICHELL and a catalogue of      CHRISTIAN MAYER, in Latin, which kept me employed when my brother      was at the telescope at night. When I found that a hand was      sometimes wanted when any particular measures were to be made with      the lamp micrometer, etc., or a fire to be kept up, or a dish of      coffee necessary during a long night's watching, I undertook with      pleasure what others might have thought a hardship. . . . Since the      discovery of the _Georgium Sidus_ [March 13, 1781], I believe few      men of learning or consequence left Bath before they had seen and      conversed with its discoverer, and thought themselves fortunate in      finding him at home on their repeated visits. Sir WILLIAM WATSON was      almost an intimate, for hardly a day passed but he had something to      communicate from the letters which he received from Sir JOSEPH      BANKS, and other members of the Royal Society, from which it      appeared that my brother was expected in town to receive the gold"]]]
