Perhaps the lack of difference in this case is simply due  to the small number of observations available for captive males (n = 10;  Table 4). Nonetheless, in summer at 35 deg.C, both captive and trapped  males relied less on evaporative cooling than did captive females  (Figure 4).    In winter, males and females had similar rates of evaporative water  loss across the full range of temperatures tested (Figure 5).  Therefore, data for both sexes were combined. The intercept and  coefficients of this equation (Table 4) did not differ from those for  summer females, but they did differ from those in the regression for  trapped males in the X squared (p<0.05) and X cubed (p<0.025) terms. As was  the case for females in summer, rates of water loss for winter animals  increased most rapidly at temperatures above 25 deg.C (Figure 5).

Each point was recorded  during the lowest level of oxygen consumption at each T_{a}. In both  summer and winter, T_{b}'s were lowest during metabolic measurements  at T_{a}'s around T_{lc}. At T_{a}'s below T_{lc}, T_{b}'s increased  (Figure 6), which is an unusual response. Under similar conditions,  other procyonids either maintain a nearly constant T_{b} or allow it  to fall slightly (Mueller and Kulzer, 1977; Chevillard-Hugot et al.,  1980; Mueller and Rost, 1983; Chevalier, 1985). For our raccoons,  confinement in the metabolism chamber at low temperatures must have  stimulated a greater than necessary increase in metabolic rate such  that heat production exceeded heat loss, which caused T_{b} to become  elevated.

Regression equations calculated to describe  oxygen consumption at T_{a}'s below T_{lc} are presented in Table 5.  For three groups of summer animals, slopes of regressions are  identical. This indicates that minimum conductances of these three  groups were equivalent. Intercepts of these equations are different,  which suggests a difference in metabolic cost of thermoregulation  between these groups (Figure 2); captive males had a lower intercept  than either trapped males (p<0.005) or captive females (p<0.05), but  there was no difference in intercepts of captive females and trapped  males. These regression equations, therefore, also were derived using  values of oxygen consumption expressed in terms of metabolic body mass  (Mellen, 1963). Relationships between intercepts of these equations  are different than those for regressions in Table 5. Intercept for  females was intermediate to, and not different from, those of the two  groups of males. However, captive males still had a lower intercept  than trapped males (p<0.025). Thus, in summer, thermoregulatory  metabolism was less expensive for captive than for trapped males, and  in spite of a 5 deg.C difference in their T_{lc}'s (Figure 2), captive  males and females had similar thermoregulatory costs.    Regression lines for three groups of animals in summer extrapolate to  zero metabolism at values equivalent to, or greater than, normal  T_{b}; 38.8 deg.C for trapped males, 37.6 deg.C for captive males, and 41.1 deg.C  for captive females (Table 5). Thus, all three groups had minimized  thermal conductance at T_{a}'s below T_{lc} (Scholander et al., 1950b;  McNab, 1980b). Minimum wet thermal conductance calculated for raccoons  in summer with Eq. 4 (Table 3) is numerically similar to these \"slope\"  values (Table 5), and it was, therefore, considered to be the best  estimate of C_{mw} for _Procyon lotor_ during that season  (0.0256 mL O_{2}.g^{-1}.h^{-1}. deg.C^{-1}).      _Winter_    During winter T_{lc} for both sexes decreased to 11 deg.C (Figure 3).  Regression equations of thermoregulatory metabolism for males and  females in winter are not different from each other in either slope or  intercept. These data, therefore, were combined into a single equation  (Table 5). Slope and intercept of this equation are both lower  (p<0.005 and p<0.05, respectively) than those for summer animals  (Table 5). Identical results were obtained from comparisons using  regressions derived from oxygen consumption expressed in terms of  metabolic body mass (Mellen, 1963). Thermoregulatory costs at any  temperature below 20 deg.C were lower for winter than summer animals  (Figures 2, 3).

Vertical cross-hatched      areas represent civil twilight.]    The regression line for _Procyon lotor_ in winter (Table 5)  extrapolates to zero metabolism at 35.2 deg.C, which is below normal T_{b}  (Figures 6, 7). This suggests that not all raccoons measured in winter  minimized thermoregulatory metabolism or conductances at T_{a}'s below  T_{lc} (Scholander et al., 1950b; McNab, 1980b). To assess this  possibility, data for these animals were divided into three groups:  (A) females with radio transmitters, (B) females without radio  transmitters, and (C) males (Table 6). Regression equations of  metabolism below T_{lc} were derived for each group, and based on  extrapolated T_{b}'s at zero metabolism, only the two females with  implanted radio transmitters (group A) minimized thermoregulatory  metabolism"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/36069"],[0,"Explorers and Travellers (#7)"],[1,"to restrain the savagery of the Indians, and saved  the life of at least one Englishman.    It seems that the successes of the young Canadian had attracted  attention in France, and when in 1691, through the efforts of the  Northern Company, Louis XIV. had decided to recover Port Nelson, Hudson  Bay, from the English, Du Tast came to Quebec with fourteen sail, it was  with express orders that Iberville should be entrusted with a share of  the work and glory. Du Tast objected to such division of honor, and by  plausible objections as to the lateness of the season, although it was  only the 16th of July, succeeded in delaying the departure of the  expedition for that year.    Iberville seemed determined to show the speciousness of the reasons, for  he made a trip to the bay and brought back in 1691 two ships loaded with  furs, much to the consolation of Frontenac. He immediately went to  France to advance the expedition against Port Nelson, which he knew was  much favored at court. Iberville found favor with the king, who gave him  two ships for the reduction of Port Nelson, and orders to guard it after  reduction.    Delays in France and contrary winds on the Atlantic brought Iberville to  Quebec only in October, far too late for the safe navigation of Hudson  Bay. To fill in his time he set forth to take Pemaquid, but did not make  an attack, this being the only instance in his long career where he  failed to show extreme daring, even against desperate odds. The delay of  the vessels was unfortunate for France as far as Hudson Bay was  concerned, for in 1693 three English vessels attacked and captured St.  Anne, with fifty thousand peltries, and again the control of the bay  passed from France.    In September, 1694, Iberville, with two ships, la Poli and la Charante,  the former commanded by his brother, de Serigny, appeared before Port  Nelson, which he was six weeks in approaching owing to the heavy moving  ice, which nearly destroyed his vessel. The fort had a double palisade,  thirty-two cannon and swivels in the main body, and fourteen cannon in  outer works, the whole manned by fifty-three men. Iberville landed  without hesitation, invested the fort with forty Canadians, worked with  his usual energy and skill, and in fourteen days he had his outworks  established, his batteries placed and mortars in position. His final  summons for surrender resulted in the capitulation of the fort, on  condition that personal property should be spared and safe transport be  given the garrison to England the coming year. His success was saddened  for Iberville by the death of the elder Chateauguay, the third of his  brothers to fall in the service of his king, who perished while  gallantly repelling a sortie of the beleaguered garrison. The name of  Port Nelson was changed to Fort Bourbon, and the river was rechristened  St. Therese, because, says Jeremie, in his _Relation de la Baie de  Hudson_, the capitulation was made on October 14th, the day of that holy  saint.    The victory did not prove to be cheap, for scurvy, then the dreaded  scourge of the sailor, broke out during the long, dark, excessively cold  winter, and caused the death of twenty men. Late the next summer, after  waiting to the last moment for the English ships he counted on  capturing, and leaving a garrison of sixty-seven at Fort Bourbon,  Iberville sailed for Quebec; but the winds were so contrary and his crew  so debilitated by scurvy, that he turned his prows to France and  fortunately arrived at Rochelle, October 9, 1695.    His victories in Hudson Bay so commended him to the king that Iberville  was charged with the reduction and destruction of the strong fort which  James II. of England had erected at Pemaquid, Maine. While on this  cruise our Canadian fell in with three English ships near the mouth of  the St. John. He unhesitatingly attacked them, dismasted, fired, and  captured the flag-ship of the squadron, the Newport, a ship of eighty  men and twenty-four guns.    Reinforced by several hundred Indians, as a land and besieging force,  Iberville arrived at Pemaquid, August 13, 1696, and invested the fort  the next day. He summoned the commander, Colonel Chubb, to capitulate,  but that officer replied that, \"if the sea was covered with French  vessels and the land with Indians, he would not surrender until  compelled to do so.\" Iberville promptly landed, and used such expedition  that within the short space of thirteen hours he established his  batteries in position and opened fire, when the garrison surrendered on  honorable terms. Iberville, doubtless mindful of his experiences at  Schenectady, took the wise and humane precaution of quartering his  prisoners under the guns of the royal ships, so as to secure them from  the fury of his bloodthirsty allies, the Indians, who desired to  supplement the entire destruction of the fort by the slaughter of the  garrison.    In withdrawing from the demolished post, while doubling the island at  the mouth of the Penobscot, he had an opportunity of justifying his  reputation as the most skilful officer in the French service; for,  falling in with an English squadron of seven sail, he successfully  evaded them by bold seamanship along the very coast line of that  dangerous and rock-bound shore.    His capacity as a military commander was now to be tested. Charged by  the king to co-operate in the reduction of Newfoundland to French power,  Iberville found himself viewed with jealousy by his colleague,  Brouillan, governor of Placentia, who assumed entire command, interfered  with Iberville's contemplated movements, and declared that his own  troops, the Canadians, should not accompany him on the opening campaign.    Iberville realizing the necessity of zealous and concerted action in an  enterprise of such importance, decided to leave the field free to  Brouillan, and so announced his intention of returning to France.  Immediately the Canadians declared to a man that they were bound to him  alone, that Frontenac's orders recognized Iberville as commander, and  finally, that they would return to Quebec sooner than accept another.  Brouillan recognizing that Iberville was the idol of his Canadian  countrymen, and unable to deny that the king had confided all the  enterprises to be undertaken during the winter to Iberville, made such  concessions as brought about reconciliation; nevertheless the campaign  undertaken against St. John's was marked by dissension. Iberville  displayed his usual energy and gallantry in the advance and subsequent  skirmishes which ultimately resulted in the surrender of St. John's,  which was abandoned and destroyed by fire. The campaign was pursued with  such energy and success that at the end of two months the English had  nothing left in Newfoundland except Bona Vista and Carbonniere Island.  During these operations Iberville displayed marked ability in handling  troops, both in the field and during siege operations. His eagerness to  share every danger, and willingness to undergo every hardship in common  with his troops, endeared him to all and contributed much to the  enthusiasm with which his men followed him or obeyed his orders.    In May, 1697, his brother Serigny arrived at Placentia with four  vessels, destined for the command of Iberville in a proposed attempt to  again reduce Hudson Bay. With these ships--le Pelican, fifty guns; le  Palmier, forty guns; le Profond, le Vespe, and a brigantine--Iberville  entered the mouth of Hudson Strait on August 3d, and was immediately  beset with heavy ice. The floes were driven hither and thither with such  violence by the currents that Iberville directed, as the best means of  safety, that each vessel should moor itself to the largest attainable  iceberg. This expedient saved four of the ships, but an unexpected  movement of two large bergs crushed so completely the brigantine that  she sank instantly, the crew barely escaping with their lives.    After a besetment of twenty-four days, Iberville succeeded in  extricating his vessel from the ice and passed into the bay. He was  alone and in utter ignorance of the fate of his consorts, which had been  hidden from view by the ice for the past seventeen days. Iberville was  not the man to turn back, nor indeed to delay in an expedition which  demanded haste, so he pushed on alone and reached Port Nelson on  September 4th.    The next morning he discovered three ships several leagues to the  leeward, tacking to enter the harbor. He hoped that they were his  consorts, and he at once made signals, which being unanswered showed  that the ships were English. It was indeed an English squadron,  consisting of the Hampshire, fifty-two guns and two hundred and thirty  men; the Hudson Bay, thirty-two guns, and the Deringue, also of  thirty-two guns, against which force Iberville had but one ship of fifty  guns. It was with reason that, as Jeremie says, \"they flattered  themselves with the idea of capturing Iberville, seeing that they were  three to one, and they were amazed at the boldness with which he  attacked them.\"    Indeed, almost any other officer in the French navy would have  considered an attack as simply madness, but such desperate odds only  served to stimulate to the highest degree the known courage and skill of  Iberville. He cleared his decks for action, and instantly quitting the  shelter and supposed advantage of the harbor, attacked the English  squadron in the open sea, where Iberville doubtless counted that his  skill in handling ship would inure to his benefit.    Charlevoix thus describes this desperate fight:    \"The cannonade opened about half-past nine in the morning and was kept  up incessantly till one with great vigor on both sides. Meanwhile the  Pelican had only one man killed and seventeen wounded. Then Iberville,  who had kept the weather-gauge, bore down straight on the two frigates,  pouring in several broadsides at close quarters in order to"]]]
