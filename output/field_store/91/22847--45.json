She had the last word on the subject, for it was time for Sara Ray to  go, and our circle broke up. Sara and Felix departed and we watched  them down the lane in the moonlight--Sara walking demurely in one runner  track, and Felix stalking grimly along in the other. I fear the romantic  beauty of that silver shining night was entirely thrown away on my  mischievous brother.    And it was, as I remember it, a most exquisite night--a white poem, a  frosty, starry lyric of light. It was one of those nights on which one  might fall asleep and dream happy dreams of gardens of mirth and  song, feeling all the while through one's sleep the soft splendour and  radiance of the white moon-world outside, as one hears soft, far-away  music sounding through the thoughts and words that are born of it.    As a matter of fact, however, Cecily dreamed that night that she saw  three full moons in the sky, and wakened up crying with the horror of  it.          CHAPTER V. THE FIRST NUMBER OF \"OUR MAGAZINE\"      The first number of Our Magazine was ready on New Year's Day, and we  read it that evening in the kitchen. All our staff had worked nobly and  we were enormously proud of the result, although Dan still continued  to scoff at a paper that wasn't printed. The Story Girl and I read it  turnabout while the others, except Felix, ate apples. It opened with a  short      EDITORIAL    With this number Our Magazine makes its first bow to the public. All  the editors have done their best and the various departments are full of  valuable information and amusement. The tastefully designed cover is by  a famous artist, Mr. Blair Stanley, who sent it to us all the way from  Europe at the request of his daughter. Mr. Peter Craig, our enterprising  literary editor, contributes a touching love story. (Peter, aside, in  a gratified pig's whisper: \"I never was called 'Mr.' before.\") Miss  Felicity King's essays on Shakespeare is none the worse for being an  old school composition, as it is new to most of our readers. Miss  Cecily King contributes a thrilling article of adventure. The various  departments are ably edited, and we feel that we have reason to be proud  of Our Magazine. But we shall not rest on our oars. \"Excelsior\" shall  ever be our motto. We trust that each succeeding issue will be better  than the one that went before. We are well aware of many defects, but  it is easier to see them than to remedy them. Any suggestion that would  tend to the improvement of Our Magazine will be thankfully received,  but we trust that no criticism will be made that will hurt anyone's  feelings. Let us all work together in harmony, and strive to make Our  Magazine an influence for good and a source of innocent pleasure, and  let us always remember the words of the poet.        \"The heights by great men reached and kept       Were not attained by sudden flight,     But they, while their companions slept,       Were toiling upwards in the night.\"      (Peter, IMPRESSIVELY:--\"I've read many a worse editorial in the  Enterprise.\")      ESSAY ON SHAKESPEARE    Shakespeare's full name was William Shakespeare. He did not always spell  it the same way. He lived in the reign of Queen Elizabeth and wrote a  great many plays. His plays are written in dialogue form. Some people  think they were not written by Shakespeare but by another man of the  same name. I have read some of them because our school teacher says  everybody ought to read them, but I did not care much for them. There  are some things in them I cannot understand. I like the stories of  Valeria H. Montague in the Family Guide ever so much better. They are  more exciting and truer to life. Romeo and Juliet was one of the plays I  read. It was very sad. Juliet dies and I don't like stories where people  die. I like it better when they all get married especially to dukes and  earls. Shakespeare himself was married to Anne Hatheway. They are both  dead now. They have been dead a good while. He was a very famous man.                                         FELICITY KING.      (PETER, MODESTLY: \"I don't know much about Shakespeare myself but I've  got a book of his plays that belonged to my Aunt Jane, and I guess I'll  have to tackle him as soon as I finish with the Bible.\")      THE STORY OF AN ELOPEMENT FROM CHURCH    This is a true story. It happened in Markdale to an uncle of my mothers.  He wanted to marry Miss Jemima Parr. Felicity says Jemima is not a  romantic name for a heroin of a story but I cant help it in this case  because it is a true story and her name realy was Jemima. My mothers  uncle was named Thomas Taylor. He was poor at that time and so the  father of Miss Jemima Parr did not want him for a soninlaw and told him  he was not to come near the house or he would set the dog on him. Miss  Jemima Parr was very pretty and my mothers uncle Thomas was just crazy  about her and she wanted him too. She cried almost every night after  her father forbid him to come to the house except the nights she had to  sleep or she would have died. And she was so frightened he might try to  come for all and get tore up by the dog and it was a bull-dog too that  would never let go. But mothers uncle Thomas was too cute for that. He  waited till one day there was preaching in the Markdale church in the  middle of the week because it was sacrament time and Miss Jemima Parr  and her family all went because her father was an elder. My mothers  uncle Thomas went too and set in the pew just behind Miss Jemima Parrs  family. When they all bowed their heads at prayer time Miss Jemima Parr  didnt but set bolt uprite and my mothers uncle Thomas bent over and  wispered in her ear. I dont know what he said so I cant right it but  Miss Jemima Parr blushed that is turned red and nodded her head. Perhaps  some people may think that my mothers uncle Thomas shouldent of wispered  at prayer time in church but you must remember that Miss Jemima Parrs  father had thretened to set the dog on him and that was hard lines when  he was a respektable young man though not rich. Well when they were  singing the last sam my mothers uncle Thomas got up and went out very  quitely and as soon as church was out Miss Jemima Parr walked out too  real quick. Her family never suspekted anything and they hung round  talking to folks and shaking hands while Miss Jemima Parr and my mothers  uncle Thomas were eloping outside. And what do you suppose they eloped  in. Why in Miss Jemima Parrs fathers slay. And when he went out they  were gone and his slay was gone also his horse. Of course my mothers  uncle Thomas didnt steal the horse. He just borroed it and sent it home  the next day. But before Miss Jemima Parrs father could get another rig  to follow them they were so far away he couldent catch them before they  got married. And they lived happy together forever afterwards. Mothers  uncle Thomas lived to be a very old man. He died very suddent. He felt  quite well when he went to sleep and when he woke up he was dead.                                           PETER CRAIG.      MY MOST EXCITING ADVENTURE    The editor says we must all write up our most exciting adventure for Our  Magazine. My most exciting adventure happened a year ago last November.  I was nearly frightened to death. Dan says he wouldn't of been scared  and Felicity says she would of known what it was but it's easy to talk.    It happened the night I went down to see Kitty Marr. I thought when I  went that Aunt Olivia was visiting there and I could come home with her.  But she wasn't there and I had to come home alone. Kitty came a piece  of the way but she wouldn't come any further than Uncle James Frewen's  gate. She said it was because it was so windy she was afraid she would  get the tooth-ache and not because she was frightened of the ghost of  the dog that haunted the bridge in Uncle James' hollow. I did wish she  hadn't said anything about the dog because I mightn't of thought about  it if she hadn't. I had to go on alone thinking of it. I'd heard the  story often but I'd never believed in it. They said the dog used to  appear at one end of the bridge and walk across it with people and  vanish when he got to the other end. He never tried to bite anyone but  one wouldn't want to meet the ghost of a dog even if one didn't believe  in him. I knew there was no such thing as ghosts and I kept saying a  paraphrase over to myself and the Golden Text of the next Sunday School  lesson but oh, how my heart beat when I got near the hollow! It was so  dark. You could just see things dim-like but you couldn't see what they  were. When I got to the bridge I walked along sideways with my back to  the railing so I couldn't think the dog was behind me. And then just in  the middle of the bridge I met something. It was right before me and  it was big and black, just about the size of a Newfoundland dog, and  I thought I could see a white nose. And it kept jumping about from one  side of the bridge to the other. Oh, I hope none of my readers will ever  be so frightened as I was then. I was too frightened to run back because  I was afraid it would chase me and I couldn't get past it, it moved so  quick, and then it just made one spring right on me and I felt its claws  and I screamed and fell down. It rolled off to one side and laid there  quite quiet but I didn't dare move and I don't know what would have  become of me if Amos Cowan hadn't come along that very minute with a"]]]
