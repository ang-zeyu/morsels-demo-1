Whenever I played for  him he looked immovably at my fingers, and one day he said 'My  God! how I am obliged to torment myself and sweat, and yet  without obtaining applause; and for you, my friend, it is mere  play!' 'Yes,' said I, 'I had to labor once in order not to show  labor now.' \"    (Vienna, April 28, 1784, to his father in Salzburg, whither the  pianist Richter, whom he recommends to his father, is going on a  concert trip.)    65. \"Meissner, as you know, has the bad habit of purposely making  his voice tremble, marking thus entire quarter and eighth notes;  I never could endure it in him. It is indeed despicable and  contrary to all naturalness in song. True the human voice  trembles of itself, but only in a degree that remains beautiful;  it is in the nature of the voice. We imitate it not only on wind  instruments but also on the viols and even on the clavier. But as  soon as you overstep the limit it is no longer beautiful because  it is contrary to nature.\"    (Paris, June 12, 1778, to his father. [The statement that the  tremolo effect could be imitated on the clavier seems to require  an explanation. Mozart obviously had in view, not the pianoforte  which was just coming into use in his day, but the clavichord.  This instrument was sounded by striking the strings with bits of  brass placed in the farther end of the keys which were simple and  direct levers. The tangents, as they were called, had to be held  against the strings as long as it was desired that the tone  should sound, and by gently repeating the pressure on the key a  tremulousness was imparted to the tone which made the clavichord  a more expressive instrument than the harpsichord or the early  pianoforte. The effect was called Bebung in German, and  Balancement in French. H.E.K.])    66. \"Before dinner Herr Vogler dashed through my sonata prima  vista. He played the first movement prestissimo, the andante  allegro and the rondo prestissimo with a vengeance. As a rule,  he played a different bass than the one I had written, and  occasionally he changed the harmony as well as the melody. That  was inevitable, for at such speed the eyes can not follow, nor  the hands grasp, the music. Such playing at sight and...are all  one to me. The hearers (I mean those worthy of the name) can say  nothing more than they have seen music and clavier playing. You  can imagine that it was all the more unendurable because I did  not dare to say to him: 'Much too quick!' Moreover it is much  easier to play rapidly than slowly; you can drop a few notes in  passages without any one noticing it. But is it beautiful? At  such speed you can use the hands indiscriminately; but is that  beautiful?\"    (Mannheim, January 17, 1778, to his father.)    67. \"They hurry the tempo, trill or pile on the adornments  because they can neither study nor sustain a tone.\"    (Recorded by Rochlitz as a criticism by Mozart of Italian singers  in 1789.)    68. \"It is thus, they think, that they can infuse warmth and  ardor into their singing. Ah, if there is no fire in the  composition you will surely never get it in by hurrying it.\"    (According to Rochlitz Mozart used these words while complaining  of the manner in which his compositions were ruined by  exaggerated speed in the tempi.)        EXPRESSIONS CRITICAL        69. \"We wish that it were in our power to introduce the German  taste in minuets in Italy; minuets here last almost as long as  whole symphonies.\"    (Bologna, September 22, 1770, to his mother and sister. Mozart as  a lad was making a tour through Italy with his father. [There  might be a valuable hint here touching the proper tempo for the  minuets in Mozart's symphonies. Of late years the conductors, of  the Wagnerian school more particularly, have acted on the belief  that the symphonic minuets of Mozart and Haydn must be played  with the stately slowness of the old dance. Mozart himself was  plainly of another opinion. H.E.K.])    70. \"Beecke told me (and it is true) that music is now played in  the cabinet of the Emperor (Joseph II) bad enough to set the dogs  a-running. I remarked that unless I quickly escape such music I  get a headache. 'It doesn't hurt me in the least; bad music  leaves my nerves unaffected, but I sometimes get a headache from  good music.' Then I thought to myself: Yes, such a shallow-pate  as you feels a pain as soon as he hears something which he can  not understand.\"    (Mannheim, November 13, 1777, to his father. Beecke was a  conceited pianist.)    71. \"Nothing gives me so much pleasure in the anticipation as the  Concert spirituel in Paris, for I fancy I shall be called on to  compose something. The orchestra is said to be large and good,  and my principal favorites can be well performed there, that is  to say choruses, and I am right glad that the Frenchmen are fond  of them....Heretofore Paris has been used to the choruses of  Gluck. Depend on me; I shall labor with all my powers to do honor  to the name of Mozart.\"    (Mannheim. February 28, 1778, to his father. On March 7 he  writes: \"I have centered all my hopes on Paris, for the German  princes are all niggards.\")    72. \"I do not know whether or not my symphony pleases, and, to  tell you the truth, I don't much care. Whom should it please? I  warrant it will please the few sensible Frenchmen who are here,  and there will be no great misfortune if it fails to please the  stupids. Still I have some hope that the asses too will find  something in it to their liking.\"    (Paris, June 12, 1778, to his father. The symphony is that known  as the \"Parisian\" (Kochel, No. 297). It is characterized by  brevity and wealth of melody.)    73. \"The most of the symphonies are not to the local taste. If I  find time I shall revise a few violin concertos,--shorten them,--  for our taste in Germany is for long things; as a matter of fact,  short and good is better.\"    (Paris, September 11, 1778, to his father, in Salzburg.  In the same letter he says: \"I assure you the journey was  not unprofitable to me--that is to say in the matter of  composition.\")    74. \"If only this damned French language were not so ill adapted  to music! It is abominable; German is divine in comparison. And  then the singers!--men and women--they are unmentionable. They do  not sing; they shriek, they howl with all their might, through  throat, nose and gullet.\"    (Paris, July 9, 1778, to his father. Mozart was thinking of  writing a French opera.)    75. \"Ah, if we too had clarinets! You can't conceive what a  wonderful effect a symphony with flutes, oboes and clarinets  makes. At the first audience with the Archbishop I shall have  much to tell him, and, probably, a few suggestions to make. Alas!  our music might be much better and more beautiful if only the  Archbishop were willing.\"    (Mannheim, December 3, 1778, to his father. Mozart was on his  return to Salzburg where he had received an appointment in the  Archiepiscopal chapel. It seems that wood-wind instruments were  still absent from the symphony orchestra in Salzburg.)    76. \"Others know as well as you and I that tastes are continually  changing, and that the changes extend even into church music;  this should not be, but it accounts for the fact that true church  music is now found only in the attic and almost eaten up by the  worms.\"    (Vienna, April 12, 1783, to his father, who was active as Court  Chapelmaster in Salzburg, and who had been asked by his son in  the same letter, when it grew a little warmer, \"to look in the  attic and send some of your (his) church music.\")    77. \"The themes pleased me most in the symphony; yet it will  be the least effective, for there is too much in it, and a  fragmentary performance of it sounds like an ant hill looks,--  that is as if the devil had been turned loose in it.\"    (In a letter written in 1789 to a nobleman who was a composer and  had submitted a symphony to Mozart for criticism.)    78. \"So far as melody is concerned, yes; for dramatic effect, no.  Moreover the scores which you may see here, outside those of  Gretry, are by Gluck, Piccini and Salieri, and there is nothing  French about them except the words.\"    (A remark made to Joseph Frank, whom Mozart frequently found  occupied with French scores, and who had asked whether the study  of Italian scores were not preferable.)    79. \"The ode is elevated, beautiful, everything you wish, but too  exaggerated and bombastic for my ears. But what would you? The  golden mean, the truth, is no longer recognized or valued. To win  applause one must write stuff so simple that a coachman might  sing it after you, or so incomprehensible that it pleases simply  because no sensible man can comprehend it. But it is not this  that I wanted to discuss with you, but another matter. I have a  strong desire to write a book, a little work on musical criticism  with illustrative examples. N.B., not under my name.\"    (Vienna, December 28, 1782, to his father. \"I was working on a  very difficult task--a Bardic song by Denis on Gibraltar. It is a  secret, for a Hungarian lady wants thus to honor Denis.\" When  Gibraltar was gallantly defended against the Spaniards, Mozart's  father wrote to him calling his attention to the victory. Mozart  replied: \"Yes, I have heard of England's triumph, and, indeed,  with great joy (for you know well that I am an arch-Englishman).\"  The little book of criticism never appeared.)    80. \"The orchestra in Berlin contains the greatest aggregation of  virtuosi in the world; I never heard such quartet playing as  here; but when all the gentlemen are together they might do  better.\"    (To King Frederick William II, in 1789, when asked for an opinion  on the orchestra in Berlin. The king asked Mozart to transfer his  services to the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4060"],[0,"The Renaissance: studies in art and poetry (#7)"],[1,"the differences of ages, of the process  by which our race has been \"educated.\"  In their attempts to  reconcile the religions of the world, they were thus thrown back  upon the quicksand of allegorical interpretation.  The religions of  the world were to be reconciled, not as successive stages in a  regular development of the religious sense, but as subsisting side  by side, and substantially in agreement with one another.  And  here the first necessity was to misrepresent the language, the  conceptions, the sentiments, it was [35] proposed to compare and  reconcile.  Plato and Homer must be made to speak agreeably to  Moses.  Set side by side, the mere surfaces could never unite in  any harmony of design.  Therefore one must go below the  surface, and bring up the supposed secondary, or still more  remote meaning,--that diviner signification held in reserve, in  recessu divinius aliquid, latent in some stray touch of Homer, or  figure of speech in the books of Moses.    And yet as a curiosity of the human mind, a \"madhouse-cell,\" if  you will, into which we may peep for a moment, and see it at  work weaving strange fancies, the allegorical interpretation of the  fifteenth century has its interest.  With its strange web of  imagery, its quaint conceits, its unexpected combinations and  subtle moralising, it is an element in the local colour of a great  age.  It illustrates also the faith of that age in all oracles, its desire  to hear all voices, its generous belief that nothing which had ever  interested the human mind could wholly lose its vitality.  It is the  counterpart, though certainly the feebler counterpart, of that  practical truce and reconciliation of the gods of Greece with the  Christian religion, which is seen in the art of the time.  And it is  for his share in this work, and because his own story is a sort of  analogue or visible equivalent to the expression of this purpose in  his writings, that something of a general interest still belongs to  the name of Pico della Mirandola, [36] whose life, written by his  nephew Francis, seemed worthy, for some touch of sweetness in  it, to be translated out of the original Latin by Sir Thomas More,  that great lover of Italian culture, among whose works the life of  Pico, Earl of Mirandola, and a great lord of Italy, as he calls  him, may still be read, in its quaint, antiquated English.    Marsilio Ficino has told us how Pico came to Florence.  It was  the very day--some day probably in the year 1482--on which  Ficino had finished his famous translation of Plato into Latin, the  work to which he had been dedicated from childhood by Cosmo  de' Medici, in furtherance of his desire to resuscitate the  knowledge of Plato among his fellow-citizens.  Florence indeed,  as M. Renan has pointed out, had always had an affinity for the  mystic and dreamy philosophy of Plato, while the colder and  more practical philosophy of Aristotle had flourished in Padua,  and other cities of the north; and the Florentines, though they  knew perhaps very little about him, had had the name of  the  great idealist often on their lips.  To increase this knowledge,  Cosmo had founded the Platonic academy, with periodical  discussions at the Villa Careggi.  The fall of Constantinople in  1453, and the council in 1438 for the reconciliation of the Greek  and Latin Churches, had brought to Florence many a needy  Greek scholar.  And now the work was completed, the door of the  mystical temple lay open to all who could construe Latin, and the  [37] scholar rested from his labour; when there was introduced  into his study, where a lamp burned continually before the bust of  Plato, as other men burned lamps before their favourite saints, a  young man fresh from a journey, \"of feature and shape seemly  and beauteous, of stature goodly and high, of flesh tender and  soft, his visage lovely and fair, his colour white, intermingled  with comely reds, his eyes grey, and quick of look, his teeth  white and even, his hair yellow and abundant,\" and trimmed with  more than the usual artifice of the time.    It is thus that Sir Thomas More translates the words of the  biographer of Pico, who, even in outward form and appearance,  seems an image of that inward harmony and completeness, of  which he is so perfect an example.  The word mystic has been  usually derived from a Greek word which signifies to shut, as if  one shut one's lips brooding on what cannot be uttered; but the  Platonists themselves derive it rather from the act of shutting the  eyes, that one may see the more, inwardly.  Perhaps the eyes of  the mystic Ficino, now long past the midway of life, had come to  be thus half-closed; but when a young man, not unlike the  archangel Raphael, as the Florentines of that age depicted him in  his wonderful walk with Tobit, or Mercury, as he might have  appeared in a painting by Sandro Botticelli or Piero di Cosimo,  entered his chamber, he seems to have thought there was  something not wholly earthly about [38] him; at least, he ever  afterwards believed that it was not without the co-operation of the  stars that the stranger had arrived on that day.  For it happened  that they fell into a conversation, deeper and more intimate than  men usually fall into at first sight.  During this conversation  Ficino formed the design of devoting his remaining years to the  translation of Plotinus, that new Plato, in whom the mystical  element in the Platonic philosophy had been worked out to the  utmost limit of vision and ecstasy; and it is in dedicating this  translation to Lorenzo de' Medici that Ficino has recorded these  incidents.    It was after many wanderings, wanderings of the intellect as well  as physical journeys, that Pico came to rest at Florence.  Born in  1463, he was then about twenty years old.  He was called  Giovanni at baptism, Pico, like all his ancestors, from Picus,  nephew of the Emperor Constantine, from whom they claimed to  be descended, and Mirandola from the place of his birth, a little  town afterwards part of the duchy of Modena, of which small  territory his family had long been the feudal lords.  Pico was the  youngest of the family, and his mother, delighting in his  wonderful memory, sent him at the age of fourteen to the famous  school of law at Bologna.  From the first, indeed, she seems to  have had some presentiment of his future fame, for, with a faith  in omens characteristic of her time, she believed [39] that a  strange circumstance had happened at the time of Pico's birth--  the appearance of a circular flame which suddenly vanished  away, on the wall of the chamber where she lay.  He remained  two years at Bologna; and then, with an inexhaustible, unrivalled  thirst for knowledge, the strange, confused, uncritical learning of  that age, passed through the principal schools of Italy and France,  penetrating, as he thought, into the secrets of all ancient  philosophies, and many Eastern languages.  And with this flood  of erudition came the generous hope, so often disabused, of  reconciling the philosophers with one another, and all alike with  the Church.  At last he came to Rome.  There, like some knight-  errant of philosophy, he offered to defend nine hundred bold  paradoxes, drawn from the most opposite sources, against all  comers.  But the pontifical court was led to suspect the orthodoxy  of some of these propositions, and even the reading of the book  which contained them was forbidden by the Pope.  It was not  until 1493 that Pico was finally absolved, by a brief of Alexander  the Sixth.  Ten years before that date he had arrived at Florence;  an early instance of those who, after following the vain hope of  an impossible reconciliation from system to system, have at last  fallen back unsatisfied on the simplicities of their childhood's  belief.    The oration which Pico composed for the opening of this  philosophical tournament still [40] remains; its subject is the  dignity of human nature, the greatness of man.  In common with  nearly all medieval speculation, much of Pico's writing has this  for its drift; and in common also with it, Pico's theory of that  dignity is founded on a misconception of the place in nature both  of the earth and of man.  For Pico the earth is the centre of the  universe: and around it, as a fixed and motionless point, the sun  and moon and stars revolve, like diligent servants or ministers.  And in the midst of all is placed man, nodus et vinculum mundi,  the bond or copula of the world, and the \"interpreter of nature\":  that famous expression of Bacon's really belongs to Pico.  Tritum  est in scholis, he says, esse hominem minorem mundum, in quo  mixtum ex elementis corpus et spiritus coelestis et plantarum  anima vegetalis et brutorum sensus et ratio et angelica mens et  Dei similitudo conspicitur:--\"It is a commonplace of the schools  that man is a little world, in which we may discern a body  mingled of earthy elements, and ethereal breath, and the  vegetable life of plants, and the senses of the lower animals, and  reason, and the intelligence of angels, and a likeness to God.\"    A commonplace of the schools!  But perhaps it had some new  significance and authority, when men heard one like Pico  reiterate it; and, false as its basis was, the theory had its use.  For  this high dignity of man, thus bringing the dust under his feet into  sensible communion with the [41] thoughts and affections of the  angels, was supposed to belong to him, not as renewed by a  religious system, but by his own natural right.  The proclamation  of it was a counterpoise to the increasing tendency of medieval  religion to depreciate man's nature, to sacrifice this or that  element in it, to make it ashamed of itself, to keep the degrading  or painful accidents of it always in view.  It helped man onward  to that reassertion of himself, that rehabilitation of human nature,  the body, the senses, the heart, the intelligence, which"]]]
