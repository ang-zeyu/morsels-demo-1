An estimated 13    million tourists visit annually, attracted by Andorra's duty-free    status and by its summer and winter resorts. Andorra's comparative    advantage has recently eroded as the economies of neighboring France    and Spain have been opened up, providing broader availability of    goods and lower tariffs. The banking sector, with its \"tax haven\"    status, also contributes substantially to the economy. Agricultural    production is limited by a scarcity of arable land, and most food    has to be imported. The principal livestock activity is sheep    raising. Manufacturing consists mainly of cigarettes, cigars, and    furniture. Andorra is a member of the EU Customs Union and is    treated as an EU member for trade in manufactured goods (no tariffs)    and as a non-EU member for agricultural products.

Marecs--Maritime European Communications Satellite used in  the Inmarsat system on lease from the European Space Agency.    Marisat--satellites of the Comsat Corporation that  participate in the Inmarsat system.    Medarabtel--the Middle East Telecommunications Project of the  International Telecommunications Union (ITU) providing a  modern telecommunications network, primarily by microwave  radio relay, linking Algeria, Djibouti, Egypt, Jordan,  Libya, Morocco, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Sudan, Syria,  Tunisia, and Yemen; it was initially started in Morocco in  1970 by the Arab Telecommunications Union (ATU) and was  known at that time as the Middle East Mediterranean  Telecommunications Network.    microwave radio relay--transmission of long distance  telephone calls and television programs by highly  directional radio microwaves that are received and sent on  from one booster station to another on an optical path.    NMT--Nordic Mobile Telephone; an analog cellular telephone  system that was developed jointly by the national  telecommunications authorities of the Nordic countries  (Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden).    Orbita--a Russian television service; also the trade name of  a packet--switched digital telephone network.    radiotelephone communications--the two-way transmission and  reception of sounds by broadcast radio on authorized  frequencies using telephone handsets.    satellite communication system--a communication system  consisting of two or more earth stations and at least one  satellite that provides long distance transmission of voice,  data, and television; the system usually serves as a trunk  connection between telephone exchanges; if the earth  stations are in the same country, it is a domestic system.    satellite earth station--a communications facility with a  microwave radio transmitting and receiving antenna and  required receiving and transmitting equipment for  communicating with satellites.    satellite link--a radio connection between a satellite and an  earth station permitting communication between them, either  one-way (down link from satellite to earth  station--television receive-only transmission) or two-way  (telephone channels).    SHF--super-high-frequency; any radio frequency in the 3,000-  to 30,000-MHz range.    shortwave--radio frequencies (from 1.605 to 30 MHz) that fall  above the commercial broadcast band and are used for  communication over long distances.    Solidaridad--geosynchronous satellites in Mexico's system of  international telecommunications in the Western Hemisphere.    Statsionar--Russia's geostationary system for satellite  telecommunications.    submarine cable--a cable designed for service under water.    TAT--Trans-Atlantic Telephone; any of a number of high-  capacity submarine coaxial telephone cables linking Europe  with North America.    telefax--facsimile service between subscriber stations via  the public switched telephone network or the international  Datel network.    telegraph--a telecommunications system designed for  unmodulated electric impulse transmission.    telex--a communication service involving teletypewriters  connected by wire through automatic exchanges.    tropospheric scatter--a form of microwave radio transmission  in which the troposphere is used to scatter and reflect a  fraction of the incident radio waves back to earth;  powerful, highly directional antennas are used to transmit  and receive the microwave signals; reliable over-the-horizon  communications are realized for distances up to 600 miles in  a single hop; additional hops can extend the range of this  system for very long distances.    trunk network--a network of switching centers, connected by  multichannel trunk lines.    UHF-- ultra-high-frequency; any radio frequency in the 300-  to 3,000-MHz range.    VHF--very-high-frequency; any radio frequency in the 30- to  300-MHz range.    Telephones: This entry gives the total number of  subscribers.    Television--broadcast stations: This entry gives the total  number of separate broadcast stations plus any repeater  stations.    Televisions: This entry gives the total number of television  sets.    Terminology: Due to the highly structured nature of the  Factbook database, some collective generic terms have to be  used. For example, the word Country in the Country name  entry refers to a wide variety of dependencies, areas of  special sovereignty, uninhabited islands, and other entities  in addition to the traditional countries or independent  states. Military is also used as an umbrella term for  various civil defense, security, and defense activities in  many entries. The Independence entry includes the usual  colonial independence dates and former ruling states as well  as other significant nationhood dates such as the  traditional founding date or the date of unification,  federation, confederation, establishment, or state  succession that are not strictly independence dates.  Dependent areas have the nature of their dependency status  noted in this same entry.    Terrain: This entry contains a brief description of the  topography.    Total fertility rate: This entry gives a figure for the  average number of children that would be born per woman if  all women lived to the end of their childbearing years and  bore children according to a given fertility rate at each  age. The total fertility rate is a more direct measure of  the level of fertility than the crude birth rate, since it  refers to births per woman. This indicator shows the  potential for population growth in the country. High rates  will also place some limits on the labor force participation  rates for women. Large numbers of children born to women  indicate large family sizes that might limit the ability of  the families to feed and educate their children.    Transnational Issues: This category includes only two  entries at the present time --Disputes--international and  Illicit drugs--that deal with current issues going beyond  national boundaries.    Transportation: This category includes the entries dealing  with the means for movement of people and goods.    Transportation--note: This entry includes miscellaneous  transportation information of significance not included  elsewhere.    Unemployment rate: This entry contains the percent of the  labor force that is without jobs. Substantial  underemployment might be noted.    United Nations System: This information is presented in  Appendix B: United Nations System as a chart, table, or text  (depending on the version of the Factbook) that shows the  organization of the UN in detail.    Waterways: This entry gives the total length and individual  names of navigable rivers, canals, and other inland bodies  of water.    Weights and measures: This information is presented in  Appendix E: Weights and Measures and includes mathematical  notations (mathematical powers and names), metric  interrelationships (prefix; symbol; length, weight, or  capacity; area; volume), and standard conversion factors.    Years: All year references are for the calendar year (CY)  unless indicated as fiscal year (FY). The calendar year is  an accounting period of 12 months from 1 January to 31  December. The fiscal year is an accounting period of 12  months other than 1 January to 31 December. FY93/94 refers  to the fiscal year that began in calendar year 1993 and  ended in calendar year 1994.    Note: Information for the US and US dependencies was  compiled from material in the public domain and does not  represent Intelligence Community estimates. The Handbook of  International Economic Statistics, published annually in  September by the Central Intelligence Agency, contains  detailed economic information for the Organization for  Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries, the  successor nations to the Soviet Union, and selected other  countries. The Handbook can be obtained wherever the  Factbook is available.        =====================================================================        A Brief History of Basic Intelligence and The World Factbook      The Intelligence Cycle is the process by which information is acquired,  converted into intelligence, and made available to policymakers.  Information is raw data from any source, data that may be fragmentary,  contradictory, unreliable, ambiguous, deceptive, or wrong. Intelligence  is information that has been collected, integrated, evaluated,  analyzed, and interpreted. Finished intelligence is the final product  of the Intelligence Cycle ready to be delivered to the policymaker.    The three types of finished intelligence are: basic, current, and  estimative. Basic intelligence provides the fundamental and factual  reference material on a country or issue. Current intelligence reports  on new developments. Estimative intelligence judges probable outcomes.  The three are mutually supportive: basic intelligence is the foundation  on which the other two are constructed; current intelligence  continually updates the inventory of knowledge; and estimative  intelligence revises overall interpretations of country and issue  prospects for guidance of basic and current intelligence. The World  Factbook, The President's Daily Brief, and the National Intelligence  Estimates are examples of the three types of finished intelligence.    The United States has carried on foreign intelligence activities since  the days of George Washington, but only since World War II have they  been coordinated on a governmentwide basis. Three programs have  highlighted the development of coordinated basic intelligence since  that time: (1) the Joint Army Navy"]]]
