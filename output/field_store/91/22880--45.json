Another male made a series of moves over  a period of weeks and finally settled in a house 490 feet from his first  home. One male who stayed in the maternal house all summer, and reached  adult size there, later moved several times, and was last recorded 900  feet away. One young female shifted 110 feet. In several instances  juveniles appeared abruptly in houses known to have been unoccupied  previously, and some of these houses were in poor repair. These young  had wandered from their maternal houses, for unknown reasons. On one  occasion a young woodrat was caught in a mouse trap set in a meadow, a  habitat into which adult woodrats would scarcely be expected to  venture.      _Feeding_    Rainey (1956) has listed 31 food plants that are used by the woodrat in  northeastern Kansas. He has emphasized that each rat usually obtains its  food from plants growing in the immediate vicinity of its house, and  that individuals thus differ greatly in their feeding, according to the  local vegetation. Therefore, with a sufficiently large number of  observations, the list of food plants might be greatly expanded, to  include most of the local flora, with the exception of the relatively  few kinds that have developed strongly repellent properties rendering  them unpalatable to herbivores in general.    At the quarry where one or more woodrats usually lived beneath metal  strips, as described previously (under the heading of \"Commensals\"), the  situation seemed to be especially favorable, despite the fact that the  metal offered no insulation from extremes of heat in summer and cold in  winter. Perhaps the rat had an alternative nest among nearby boulders,  to use when temperature was unendurable beneath the metal.    The rat itself, the stored food, and other details of its home life,  could be observed with a minimum of disturbance by raising one side of  the metal strip momentarily, then carefully lowering it into place. The  following observations made in the summer and autumn of 1948 give some  idea of the range of food plants stored at any one time and the change  as the season progresses.         July 12: Bundles of leaves of carrion-flower (_Smilax       herbacea_); 15 green pods of honey locust (_Gleditsia       triacanthos_) with seeds eaten out; several green fruits of       osage orange (_Maclura pomifera_), and several seeds of       coffee-tree (_Gymnocladus dioica_).         July 24: Bundles of green leaves of osage orange and       carrion-flower; many pods of honey locust.         August 30: Three large clusters of the fruits of pokeberry       (_Phytolacca americana_).         October 20: Many small clusters of grapes (_Vitis vulpina_)       judged to weigh perhaps one pound in all; several old pods       of coffee-tree and a few berries of dogwood (_Cornus       Drummondi_) and of pokeberry; a pile of small acorns of       chinquapin oak (_Quercus prinoides_); dry seed heads of       grass (_Bromus inermis_ and _B. japonicus_).         December 22: Many twigs of bittersweet (_Celastrus       scandens_) with fruits still attached; several seed heads of       sunflower (_Helianthus annuus_); a few acorns of chinquapin       oak; fragments of the fruit of osage orange; cured bundles       of trefoil (_Desmodium glutinosum_), carrion-flower, and       tickle grass (_Panicum capillare_).    Although the eastern woodrat is relatively unspecialized in its feeding  habits, a few species of favored food plants probably make up the  greater part of its diet. In northeastern Kansas, at present, osage  orange probably is by far the most important single species. Despite the  fact that its aromatic leaves and fruits are somewhat repellent to  insects and some other animals, they are well liked by woodrats, and  provide a year-round food supply to those individuals having houses in  or near the trees. Honey locust similarly provides thorny shelter for  house sites, while the foliage, the seeds, and the bark of twigs and  trunks are eaten. In houses that are situated near honey locusts, the  large, heavy seed pods are sometimes stored by the hundreds. Old pods  are often used in substitution for sticks as building material in the  house. Nevertheless, honey locust is used relatively little as compared  with osage orange. Other plants that figure most importantly in the diet  include bittersweet, fox grape, pokeberry and horse nettle (_Solanum  carolinense_).    Rainey (_op. cit._) mentioned that captive woodrats would eat meat, both  cooked and raw, and on one occasion he found remains of a cicada on a  house under circumstances suggesting that this insect had been eaten by  a rat. In the course of trapping for opossums and small carnivores,  woodrats were caught on many occasions by Fitch in traps baited with  animal material exclusively--miscellaneous meat scraps, canned dog-food,  bacon grease, or carcasses of small vertebrates. In fact, such baits  seemed to be even more attractive than the grain, seeds, peanut butter  and raisins that had been used customarily to bait the traps set for  woodrats. However, such meat baits could be used effectively only in  cold weather, because of rapid spoilage and interference by insects at  higher temperatures.    On one occasion an adult pilot black snake found dead on the road, a  recent traffic victim, was brought to the Reservation headquarters for  examination and was left overnight in the garage. On the following  morning the carcass of the snake was found to have been dragged a short  distance and gnawed; a quantity of flesh was eaten at an exposed wound  on the neck. Woodrat tracks were thickly imprinted on the dusty soil  around the snake. The adult male woodrat that lived in the garage had  evidently spent much time moving about the carcass and over it, and  feeding upon it. It seemed remarkable that this individual was not  deterred from feeding on the snake by an instinctive fear of one of its  chief natural enemies.    Although the eastern woodrat's food consists mostly of vegetation, the  strong tendency noted to feed upon flesh when it is available suggests  that these rodents may, occasionally at least, prey upon helpless young  of small vertebrates that are readily available to them. Nestling birds,  either on the ground or in low trees, and young mice in nests that are  accessible, might tempt the rat to indulge in predation.      _Breeding_    Reproductive activity continues to some extent throughout the year  except in late autumn and early winter. Presence of a vaginal orifice  was used as an indication of sexual activity. In most instances the  orifice was not indicative of actual oestrus, as it persisted through  the preceding and following stages of an oestrus cycle. In anoestrus the  orifice is sealed, the genitalia are reduced in size and the skin in the  genital region is white. Immature females, and adults during most of the  winter, are in this quiescent condition. Onset of the breeding season in  late winter is relatively abrupt, and seemingly is a photoperiodic  response. Breeding may begin in late January, and most females are in  breeding condition within the first half of February. In oestrus the  genitalia are enlarged and discolored and the vaginal orifice is  prominent and gaping. By February most females born the previous season  have matured, and breeding involves the entire population, except  possibly for retarded young and individuals suffering from disease,  injury or malnutrition. Rainey (1956) recorded an average of 2.3 young  per litter.    Number of litters normally produced in the course of a season by an  adult female is unknown, but most mature females examined within the  period February to September inclusive were in some stage of the  breeding cycle. It is obvious that the females which are successful in  rearing their litters produce at least two litters annually, and  probably some produce three litters. When entire litters are lost at an  early age, to predation, or other causes, productivity is much  increased, with perhaps only short intervals between pregnancies.    The smallest female having a vaginal orifice weighed 160 grams, but in  most instances somewhat larger size is attained before the onset of  oestrus. Judging from the average growth rate of immature females (Fig.  3), most probably attain sexual maturity at an age of five to six months  unless this age is reached in the winter period of sexual quiescence.  Rainey (_op. cit._) found no clear cut instances of young maturing in  time to breed before their first winter. He concluded, tentatively,  that in most instances sexual maturity is not attained until the spring  of the year following that in which the rat is born. However, the  evidence was inconclusive because few of the young marked survived to  maturity. In late summer and early autumn, the latter third of the  breeding season, newly matured young of the year, born in early spring,  may be the most productive group. Young conceived at the beginning of  the breeding season, and born in early March, would normally reach adult  size and breeding maturity in August. For example, a young female first  caught on June 15, 1951, weighed only 150 grams, but by August 10 she  had gained to 220 grams (probably in pregnancy) and had a vaginal  orifice. Of 35 adult and subadult females examined by Fitch in October,  eleven had a vaginal orifice, the latest on October 18. Of these eleven  showing signs of breeding, four at least had not yet produced litters,  judging from the undeveloped condition of their mammae, and others that  showed evidence of recent lactation probably included young of the year  that had bred in August or September. One female gave birth to a litter  in a trap on the night of October 6, 1950. Of 32 adult and subadult  females recorded by Fitch in November, all were sexually quiescent, with "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33574"],[0,"A Field Study of the Kansas Ant-Eating Frog, Gastrophryne olivacea (#7)"],[1,"quarry in a pitfall that had been one of those most productive of frogs.  The bottom of the pitfall was strewn with the discarded remains (mostly  feet and skins) of perhaps a dozen ant-eating frogs. All had been eaten  during one night and the following morning, as the trap had been checked  on the preceding day. On other occasions shrews caught in pitfalls with  several frogs had killed and eaten some and left others unharmed.      SUMMARY    In northeastern Kansas the ant-eating frog, _Gastrophryne olivacea_, is  one of the more common species of amphibians. This area is near the  northern limits of the species, genus, and family. The species prefers a  dry, rocky upland habitat often in open woods or at woodland edge where  other kinds of salientians do not ordinarily occur. It is, however,  tolerant of a wide variety of habitat conditions, and may occur in river  flood plains or cultivated land. In these situations where surface rocks  are absent, cracks and rodent burrows presumably furnish the  subterranean shelter that it requires.    This frog is secretive and spends most of the time in subterranean  shelter, obtaining its food there rather than in the open. Only on warm  rainy nights is it inclined to venture into the open. Then, it moves  about rapidly and with a scuttling gait, a combination of running and  short hops. However, it may be flushed in daylight from a hiding place  by the vibrations from footsteps of a person or an animal, or it may  move about in the daytime when temperatures at night are too low for  activity. Though not swift of foot, the frogs are elusive because of  their tendency to keep under cover, their slippery dermal secretion, and  the ease with which they find and enter holes, or crevices to escape.    Breeding occurs at any time from late May through August and is  controlled by the distribution of rainfall. Heavy precipitation,  especially rains of two inches or more, stimulates the frogs to migrate  in large numbers to breeding ponds. Even though there are several well  spaced periods of unusually heavy rainfall in the course of a summer,  each one initiates a new cycle of migration, mating and spawning. Heavy  rainfall is a necessity, not only to ensure a water supply in temporary  pools where the frogs breed, but to create the moist conditions they  require for an overland migration. An individual male may migrate to a  pond and breed at least twice in the same season. Whether or not the  females do likewise is unknown. Amplexus and spawning occur mainly  within a day or two after the frogs reach the ponds. The males call  chiefly at night, but there may be daytime choruses when breeding  activity is at its peak. Many males concentrate within a few square  yards in the choruses and float upright usually beside or beneath a stem  or leaf, or other shelter, rendering them extremely inconspicuous. The  call is a bleat of three seconds duration, or a little more. In amplexus  the members of a pair sometimes become glued together by their viscous  dermal secretions. The eggs hatch in approximately 48 hours. The  tadpoles metamorphose in as few as 24 days. Newly metamorphosed frogs  are 15 to 16 mm. in length, or, rarely as small as 14.5 mm. They are  thus much larger than newly metamorphosed _G. carolinensis_, which have  been described as 10-12 mm. or even as small as 8.5 mm. The newly  metamorphosed frogs disperse from the breeding ponds as soon as there is  a heavy rain. The young grow a little more than one mm. in length per  week. Those metamorphosed in early summer may attain minimum adult size  before hibernation which begins in October. It seems that sexual  maturity is most often attained in the second season, at an age of one  to two years.    _Gastrophryne_ belongs to a family that is primarily tropical in  distribution, and frogs of this genus have much higher temperature  thresholds than most other amphibians of northeastern Kansas, with a  correspondingly short season of activity. For more than half the year,  mid-October to early May the frogs are normally in hibernation. Body  temperatures of active frogs ranged from 17.0 deg. C. to 37.6 deg. C.,  but more than two-thirds were within the relatively narrow range, 24.0  deg. to 31 deg.. Near the date of the first autumn frost the frogs  disappear from the soil surface and from their usual shelters near the  surface, presumably having retired into hibernation in deep holes and  crevices.    The natural enemies include young of the copperhead. The bullfrog and  leopard frog probably take heavy toll of both the adults and the newly  metamorphosed young at the breeding ponds. Reproductive success of the  ant-eating frogs was much greater in 1954 when these ranids were  unusually scarce. The short-tailed shrew is an important enemy. On  occasion it took heavy toll of frogs trapped in pitfalls, and many of  the larger adults were scarred or mutilated from bites, probably of the  shrew.    Each of several frogs was found consistently under the same rock for  periods of weeks. The hundreds of other frogs that were marked were  rarely found twice in any one spot. Usually an individual recaptured  after weeks or months was still near the original site. In many  instances the distance involved was only a few yards, but there is some  evidence that home ranges may be as long as 400 feet in greatest  diameter. Of those caught in two or more different years only 15 per  cent were shown to have moved more than 400 feet. These few  exceptionally long movements, up to 2000 feet, involve shifts in home  range or migrations motivated by reproductive urge.      LITERATURE CITED      ANDERSON, P.        1942.
