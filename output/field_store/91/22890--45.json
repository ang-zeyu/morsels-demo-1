Compare these  magnificent housings and accoutrements, these saddles of velvet, stiff  with gold, these reins, and swords and daggers, full of pearls and  jewels, with those clumsy implements of labor, and those uncouth, heavy  utensils of domestic life. Compare the elaborate workmanship of screens,  cabinets, vases, lamps, and tables, with the primitive candles and  suspicious-looking soaps; the magnificence of carriages and palanquins,  luxuriously cushioned, and hung with velvet and gold, in which lazy,  bloated grandees are lounging, laden with jewels and finery, with the  naked, emaciated bearers, human brutes that replace beasts of burden,  and contrast, unfavorably, with average European horses!    In European industry, on the contrary, an ascentional, out-reaching  movement is every where visible. Beauty remains no longer in scornful  isolation, divorced from use, but descending into the domain of  every-day existence, incorporates her divine essence in all the forms of  common life, pervading the lowliest spheres, raising and ennobling the  humblest details, by her purifying and vivifying presence. This  tendency, visible in the industry of all European nations, is still more  clearly evident in the manufactures of France and England, whose  productions, standing at the head of all others, constitute the highest  expression of the industrial spirit of the age. Here the hardest and  heaviest materials, wood, iron, and stone, become plastic under the  workman's hand, assuming the most brilliant polish, the lightest and  most elegant forms; grates, fire-irons, and kitchen-ranges, rival, in  lustre and beauty, the attractions of diamonds, goldsmiths' work, and  flowers. The admirable construction of machinery shares in the  enthusiasm excited by the beautiful fabrics woven by their tireless  fingers; and the \"Golden Marriage\" of use and beauty is every where  celebrated under varying forms.    They who imagine that art has died out of the world, and sigh for the  chisel of Praxiteles, the pencil of Apelles, and the glorious  conceptions of the masters of the middles ages, would do well to visit  the Crystal Palace, and contrast the rudeness which shaped all the  elements of ordinary life in former periods, with the elegance and  beauty which the simplest objects of common use are beginning to assume.  Not, however, that the one necessarily precludes the other, or that we  are fated to produce no more fine statues and paintings, no more  monumental temples and palaces, because we now have, at lower prices  than were paid in ancient times for inferior articles, beautiful  carpets, and fabrics of silk, wool, and cotton, furniture, porcelain,  and glass, in which the thought of the artist and the craft of the  artisan are so admirably blended that they seem to be identical. Art is  not dead; it is throwing out wider and deeper roots, and will bear  richer fruits in the garden of the future, enriched by the mingled  detritus of by-gone ages, than it has ever borne in the primitive  formations of the past.    One of the most interesting features of the present exhibition, the one  which constitutes its distinguishing character, is, undoubtedly, its  universality, and the interest which it excites among all nations, and  all classes. And it was time that the results of human activity in its  various departments, should thus be gathered together from the four  corners of the globe, for the world is cut up into so many small  fractions, and each fraction lives so much within the limits of its own  narrow circle, ignoring, for the most part, all that is going on outside  of it, that it is in the highest degree desirable that people should  begin to see something of what their neighbors are doing.    It is time that nations met elsewhere than on the field of battle, and  measured their strength and dignity by some more rational standard than  the relative force of their cannon; time also that the various classes  of society, so widely separated by the artificial divisions of caste and  fortune, should look, at length, into each other's face and recognize  the band of a common nature and of common needs; that the world's, as  yet, unhonored workers, beholding the glorious fruits of their prolific  energy, should perceive the sublimity of their mission and take fresh  heart and fresh hope; that the rich should learn, from the grand results  of labor, to appreciate more justly its nobleness and worth.    That the exhibition of 1851, successful as it is evidently destined to  be, should fully realize this most desirable end, is hardly to be  expected; but that it will do much toward creating a better  understanding between classes and countries, and thus pave the way for  the bringing in of a future era of universal helpfulness and good-will,  may be very confidently predicted.        STELLA.          FRENCH FEUILLETONISTES UPON LONDON.      The leading Parisian journals have correspondents in London during the  Great Exhibition, and as the _corps_ of Parisian feuilletonistes  comprises much of the richest and rarest talent of the great French  metropolis, there is a piquancy and brilliance in these daguerreotypes  of London life and the impressions of English character, which is very  entertaining. No traveller who remembers dining at any of the recherche  cafes upon the Boulevards with a Frenchman, and chatting with him of  England and London, can forget the cold chill that curled through the  Parisian's conversation, as if he were a Pole, gossipping of Siberia, or  the glances of intense satisfaction and pride which he cast upon the  lively and lovely groups in the street, inly thanking God that he was  not born a child of _perfide Albion_.    But these gentlemen talk not alone of the Exhibition, but of the \"town\"  in general. Their articles wear the air of the journals of heroic  adventurers who have penetrated into barbarous lands. They are clearly  home-sick, these sybarites. We extract the following from a translation  in the London _Literary Gazette_, prefaced with a few editorial remarks.  Speaking of the variety of their topics the reviewer says: \"Thus the  great Jules Janin, in the _Journal des Debats_, notwithstanding the  interest of portions of his article, some of which have been translated  into our journals, makes the infamy of French republicans, and his own  fervent love and devotedness to the royal family of Orleans, the burden  of his lucubrations. M. Blanqui, the historian of political economy, and  translator of Adam Smith, faithful as becomes an economist to his _idee  fixe_, bewails in the _Presse_ the folly of France in rejecting the  doctrines of free trade, and clamors loudly for an immediate reform of  French tariffs. M. Jules de Premary fills column after column in the  _Patrie_ with descriptions of English manners, customs, and  peculiarities; and yet he admits that he knows nothing of our language,  and has only resided amongst us for a few days. Parisian _litterateurs_  pride themselves on being men of imagination, poets, _penseurs  fantasistes_; and it is clear that it would be as reasonable to chain an  eagle to a dog-cart, as to expect _them_ to deal with a plain,  practical, matter-of-fact thing in the methodical business-like way of  the English journalist. Of these, the lines of Miss Fanny Fudge are  strikingly true:                              \"Vain, critics, vain      All your efforts to saddle wit's fire with a chain!!      To blot out the splendor of fancy's young stream,      Or crop in its cradle the newly-fledged beam!!!\"    But though our worthy _confreres_ of the Parisian press have thus let  their wits go a wool-gathering, and left the poor Exhibition in the  lurch, it is but just to state that one and all display on the whole a  most friendly feeling towards the English; and even in quizzing us, as  most of them do, display great good nature. They feel, perhaps, a little  sore at having been outstripped by us in the establishment of the first  great Universal Exhibition; but this was only natural, and they console  themselves by stating that it was in France that the idea was first  conceived, and by solemnly promising that France will some day _prendre  sa revanche_. The most amusing of the _feuilletonistes_ is  unquestionably M. Jules de Premary, of the _Patrie_; and we have thought  it worth while to translate a portion of his last letter, as a specimen  of what an intelligent man of letters feels on visiting us for the first  time, and before he becomes well acquainted with us:         \"One of the principal causes of surprise to me in walking       along the streets of London, has been to see myself all at       once become a curious animal. I did not think that I had any       of the qualities necessary for such a thing, being neither       humpbacked nor club-footed, neither a giant nor a dwarf.       Thus, then, on the day of my arrival I went along Regent       Street, and heard the exclamations and laughter of the crowd       on seeing me, I examined myself from head to foot, to       ascertain the cause of the unhoped-for success which I       obtained in England. I even felt all up my back, thinking       that perhaps some facetious boy might have transformed me       into a walking placard. There was nothing, however; but I       had moustachios and a foreign air! A foreign air! That is       one of the little miseries on which you do not count, O       simple and inexperienced travellers!         \"At home you may have the dignity and nobleness of the       Cid--you may be another Talma: but pass the Channel--show       yourself to the English, and in spite of yourself you will       become as comic as Arnal.

It is this  high fiber content or woody character that makes me dubious about its  silage value, in which opinion Professor Rolfs concurs. When two or  three feet high it is greedily eaten by animals, and so may be a  pasturage possibility. As a green feed crop it could be cut three or  more times each season, when three or four feet high, and I am sure will  prove a very valuable forage for the man with one or two cows. Whether  it is a crop for the stockman is still doubtful.    In 1916 we introduced a very similar species, _Pennisetum merkeri_,  which is perhaps a little superior, though it is hard to tell the two  apart.      Metake.    The name \"Japanese bamboo grass\" leads me to mention a true Japanese  bamboo, the _metake_. This is a bamboo that spreads by rootstocks and  forms dense thickets ten to fifteen feet high, much like cane brake,  and, like our native cane, a valuable winter pasture plant. Mr. P. K.  Yonge has grown it with marked success about twenty miles north of  Pensacola. It seems to me a valuable plant to furnish a supply of  pasturage in winter, when pasturage is practically gone. It is worthy of  careful trial on all well-drained Florida soils.      Tripsacum Laxum.    Last year we secured from Guatemala a new perennial grass which, if it  proves winter hardy, will, I am certain, be of enormous value to South  Florida. This grass grows much like teosinte, but is stouter and very  much more leafy. The stem is tender, sweet and juicy, and all the leaves  remain green. It is an ideal silage plant. So far as I am aware, our  trial at Miami is the first time this grass has ever been cultivated.  The few live stock men who have seen it went into ecstasies. It may  prove valuable, however, only for frostless regions.      Creeping Pasture Grasses.    At the present time we have under trial five creeping pasture grasses,  more or less like Bermuda in a general way. You are, of course, aware  that a pasture grass to be valuable should be able to spread naturally  and must be able to hold the ground. Naturally it takes time to  determine all these facts. The five grasses I refer to are as follows:    Blue Couch (_Digitaria didactyla_). This is much like Bermuda, but  produces abundant good seed. For lawns and pastures it promises to be  about equally as valuable as Bermuda.    Manilla Grass (_Osterdamia matrella_). This is especially adapted to  rather moist sandy lands. It grows very dense, and where it thrives  should be valuable.    Lovi-lovi (_Chrysopogon aciculatus_). This furnishes much pasturage in  India, the Philippines, and South China. The seeds are very abundant,  and each sticks into the clothing like a pin. But about Hongkong it is  used generally as a lawn grass. It is well adapted to dry sandy soils.  If it proves well adapted to Florida we can, I think, chance its  becoming a nuisance, because if it does thrive it will give much  pasture.    Nilghiri Grass (_Andropogon emersus_). This is the only creeping grass  of the genus Andropogon (which includes our broom sedges) that we have  yet found. I secured it in the Nilghiri Hills of South India. It looks  promising.    Kikuyu Grass (_Pennisetum sp._). This is native to the highlands of  Uganda, in British East Africa, and in South Africa has created great  interest. It looks much like St. Augustine grass. At Biloxi, Miss., it  has succeeded well. It looked very fine at Arlington, Va., but could not  stand the winter. This grass is said to be very nutritious, and I  believe that on the better soils of Florida it will prove a real  acquisition.    I mention these new things to give you some idea of what we are doing. I  might mention several others that look good to us, but it will be time  to speak when we have tried them further. In brief, we are scouring the  earth to find grasses and legumes to meet Florida's needs. We have faith  that the grasses and legumes exist, if we only can find them.    Gentlemen, in closing I must say one thing more. Our country is at  war--a war that will tax our energies and resources to the uttermost. No  more dangerous idea can be entertained than to minimize the task, or to  delude ourselves with the prospect of an early peace.    One important factor is food, especially meat and wheat. Only an  unusually favorable season can produce for us as much wheat as last  year. Our meat and forage supplies are low, because in times of food  scarcity, grass crops are necessarily sacrificed. Gentlemen, you can do  much to help increase the meat supply. In developing your ranches to  increase your output, I want to urge as a patriotic duty that you  increase your good pasturage and your winter feed supply as rapidly as  you can. I could not urge this in peace times, because rapid development  is never the most economical. But in this time of stress you cattlemen  can help the nation most by increasing your output to the maximum. There  is no other way for you to give to the nation that will count so much. I  therefore urge that you brush aside all questions as to the economically  best method of increasing pasturage and forage, and to devote all your  capital and all your energy to doing this along any lines that are  sure.          FLORIDA AS SEEN FROM A TEXAS STANDPOINT.         _Address by W. N. Waddell of Fort Worth, Texas, before the       Florida State Live Stock Association, January 9, 1918._      _Mr. Waddell started to working cattle on the Texas ranges in 1875, and  has been in the cattle business for himself since 1881._    _He was chairman of the Live Stock Sanitary Commission of Texas for four  years, and for a number of years has been the Texas representative of  the Live Stock Exchange National Bank of Chicago, and of the Chicago  Cattle Loan Company._    _After spending a week in Florida during August of 1917, Mr. Waddell  returned to the State in November and spent considerable time  investigating the opportunities for raising cattle. This address gives  his views on the advantages Florida possesses as a cattle-producing  state._    In order to understand or to be able to appreciate a proposition of  almost any character it is necessary to approach it by comparison, and  in making comparisons touching Florida I wish to state that I have  traveled over the range of the five northern states of old Mexico; I  have traveled over the southern part of the range belt of Arizona; I  have traveled over about half of the state of New Mexico and virtually  all of Texas, and I find in Florida conditions favorable to the  production of live stock that do not exist in any of the states I have  named, which constitute the great range belt of the Southwest. In Mexico  there is very little water, and water is very hard to get by digging,  the wells averaging from 150 to 1,000 feet deep, and in a great many  instances no water at all. In Mexico they also have a great many animals  that prey on the live stock, such as panthers, lobo wolves, bears, as  well as the common, ordinary coyote. None of these have to be contended  with here.    In Arizona and New Mexico about the same conditions prevail as do in  northern Old Mexico. In Texas we have bears and sundry pests to prey on  our live stock. The prairie dog infests a great many of our ranches,  destroying the grass, digging holes in the ground, and making it  dangerous for the cowboy to ride over in the pursuit of his range  endeavors. We have wolves of all species. In Texas we have also the  screw worms that are a tax on the live stock producer to the extent of  from two to five per cent of the calves born on his ranch, and I am  sorry to say that worst of all we have periodical droughts. None of  these adverse conditions I find prevail in Florida.    Here I find the country covered with a thick, heavy coat of grass,  streams running with plenty of water and I understand where natural  water is not available that it is only about from twenty to one hundred  feet to an abundant supply of water under the ground, making the  proposition of watering the ranches in Florida, where artificial water  is necessary, a very simple matter. The climate in Florida is temperate  and mild, rainfall is regular and abundant, and, so far as the  production of forage for live stock on the range is concerned, your  rainfall and your soils all seem to combine in favor of the producer of  live stock.    I never was more amazed in my life than I was last summer, when, in  company with a committee of other cattle men from Texas, I visited this  state. At that time I was shown over the southern middle part of  Florida; was shown a great domain of country lying out of doors, as it  were and as we term it in Texas, furnishing free range for hundreds of  thousands of cattle. I did not believe my ears when I was told those  conditions existed here, and I can't understand yet why a state as old  as Florida, with as many surface indications of possibilities for the  production of live stock, should remain unfenced, unoccupied, and  non-revenue producing to the men who own the land.    Another surprise that met us when we came to Florida in the summer was  the absolute lack of any improvement in the live stock that we found  here. In fact, it is my judgment that the cattle in Florida today, from  what I have read of the history of Florida, are not as good as they were  thirty years ago, and I am surprised, when I think of the facilities  furnished the cattle men of Florida by the land owners for the grazing  of their cattle, that they haven't taken any more interest in their  cattle than they have and tried to improve them.    Florida today, as never before, is attracting national attention as a  possible beef-producing state. The eyes of the investing public are  turned toward Florida, and it is my judgment that within the next five  years Florida will make greater strides in the development of the live"]]]
