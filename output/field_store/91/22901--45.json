Fowls that were  domesticated and given good care and an abundance of food would usually  grow larger than the wild stock. Thus if any person, or the people  generally in any community, systematically gave their fowls good care, a  variety of unusual size would be developed.    Different colors would also appear in the flocks of fowls, because the  birds of unusual colors would be protected and preserved, instead of  being destroyed as they usually are in the wild state. Other  peculiarities, too, such as large combs, crests, and feathered legs,  would be developed in some lands and neglected in others. This is how it  happened that after thousands of years in domestication the races of  fowls in different parts of the world were quite different in size and  form, but alike in being of many colors.    From a species in this condition modern poultry breeders have made  hundreds of distinct varieties. The easiest method of making a variety  in domestication is to select specimens for breeding as near the desired  type as possible, and to breed only from a few individuals in each  generation which come nearest to the ideal type. In this way a variety  that breeds quite true to the type may be established in from three or  four to eight or ten years, according to the number of characters to be  established as distinctive of the variety. Varieties are also made by  crossing unlike individuals. This process is longer than the other, and  sometimes requires a series of crosses to produce specimens  approximating the ideal sought. After such specimens have been obtained  the method is the same as in the first case. A variety is commonly  considered to be well established when the greater part of the specimens  produced are easily identified as of that variety. But no domestic  variety is ever established in the sense that a species is. All are  artificial, produced by compulsory separation and preserved only as long  as it is continued.    =Classification of domestic varieties of birds.= Domestic varieties of  all kinds of live stock were at first mostly shape-varieties; that is,  the individuals of a variety were alike in shape but of various colors.  This is the case still with some varieties. These shape-varieties are  mostly the common types of certain countries or districts. Thus the  Leghorn fowl is the common fowl of Italy, and the Houdan is a type  common in a small district in France. Such shape-varieties are called  _breeds_. When other types were made by crossing such breeds they also  were called breeds.    When people first began to be interested in the improvement of live  stock, the popular idea of a breed was that it was a domestic species,  and there are still many people who hold this view. This popular  misconception of the nature of a breed is responsible for much of the  inconsistency and confusion in the ordinary classifications of domestic  varieties. To it also is due the use of the term \"variety\" to apply  especially to color-varieties, which are the principal divisions of  breeds.    In the classification of domestic birds a _variety_ is properly a  color-variety of a breed. Thus in the Plymouth Rock breed there are six  color-varieties--barred, white, buff, partridge, silver-penciled, and  ermine (called Columbian); and in Fantail Pigeons there are six  color-varieties--white, blue, black, red, yellow, and silver. Birds of  the same breed (shape) and the same variety (color) may differ in some  other character, as the form of the comb or the presence or absence of  feathers in certain places. In accordance with such differences  varieties are divided into _subvarieties_. Thus, in Leghorn Fowls the  brown, white, and buff varieties have single-combed and rose-combed  subvarieties.    In any breed, variety, or subvariety certain families are sometimes  distinguished for general or special excellence of form or color. Such a  family is called a _strain_.    =Systematic mixtures of breeds and varieties.= Although so many distinct  varieties have been developed from common domestic stocks, the improved  races do not always displace the mongrels. When the old mongrels  disappear their place is often taken by a new mongrel stock produced by  mixtures of the distinct breeds with each other and with the old mongrel  race. The greater part of such stock is so mixed that its relation to  any established breed could not be determined or expressed, but  systematic mixtures are sometimes made, and to describe these the  following terms are used: _Crossbred_--having parents of different,  distinct breeds, varieties, or subvarieties. A Leghorn male mated with a  Cochin female produces offspring each of which is in blood one half  Leghorn and one half Cochin. _Grade_--having more than half of the blood  of a breed.    If the offspring of a cross such as is described in the preceding  paragraph are mated with birds of one of the parent breeds, the  offspring of this mating will have three fourths of the blood of that  breed. If these in turn are mated to birds of the same pure breed, the  offspring will have seven eighths of the blood of that breed. Animals  bred in this way are called _grades_ until the process has been carried  so far that they are practically pure-bred. Mongrel stock is often  graded up in this way. As a rule stock that is seven eighths pure is not  distinguishable from average pure stock of the same breed.    =Pure-bred, thoroughbred, and standard-bred.= A _pure-bred_ animal is,  strictly speaking, one having the blood only of the variety to which it  belongs. From what has been said of the making of breeds and varieties  it is plain that absolute purity of blood is not a universal attribute  of well-bred domestic birds. A _thoroughbred_ animal is one that is  thoroughly bred for some purpose or to some type. A _standard-bred_  animal is one that is bred especially to conform to requirements agreed  upon by breeders and exhibitors.    A great deal of misapprehension and confusion in the use of these terms  has been caused by the attitude of those who maintain that the term  \"thoroughbred,\" having been used as a name for highly bred running  horses, cannot properly apply to any other kind of live stock, and that  \"pure-bred\" should apply to all thoroughly bred races. The noun  \"Thoroughbred\" is the name of a breed of horses. The adjective  \"thoroughbred\" is common property. Writers on aviculture who wish to be  accurate prefer it in many instances to \"pure-bred\" because absolute  purity of blood is rare and is not of the importance in breeding that  novices usually suppose. Not only are many new varieties made by  crossing, but in long-established breeds outcrosses are regularly made  to restore or intensify characters.    To illustrate the use of the three terms in application to a single  breed: A stock of Light Brahmas might be kept pure for half a century,  yet at the end of that period might have changed its type entirely. It  might be so deteriorated that it was worth less than common mongrels;  yet it is pure-bred stock. Another stock of the same variety might be  bred for table qualities, egg-production, and the same principal  color-characteristics of the variety, but without attention to the fine  points of fancy breeding. Such a stock is thoroughbred but not  standard-bred.          CHAPTER IV    FOWLS      [Illustration: Fig. 12. Pet fowls--White Wyandottes and Game Bantams.  (Photograph from Dr. J. C. Paige, Amherst, Massachusetts)]    The most useful of all birds is the common fowl, seen on almost every  farm and in the back yards of many city and village homes. The fowl  takes to the conditions of domestic life better than any other land  bird. It is more cleanly in its habits, more productive, more  intelligent, and more interesting than the duck, which ranks next in  usefulness. Fowls supply nearly all the eggs and the greater part of the  poultry meat that we use. Their feathers are of less value than those of  ducks, geese, and turkeys. In the days when feather beds were common  they were made usually of the body feathers of fowls. Now the feathers  of fowls are used mostly for the cheaper grades of pillows and cushions,  and in the making of feather boas and like articles. The wing and tail  feathers have been much used for decorating ladies' hats, and since the  use of small wild birds in millinery decorations has been prohibited,  the hackle feathers of cocks are quite extensively used in trimming  hats.

The males at  maturity weigh from four to five pounds each, and the females about a  pound less. They are plump, rugged, and very active. If treated well  they are bold, and with a little attention can easily be made very tame.  If neglected and abused, they become shy and wild. The most striking  peculiarities of the fowl are the fleshy comb and wattles which ornament  the head, and the full tail which is usually carried well up and spread  perpendicularly. The head appendages vary much in size and form. They  are sometimes very small, but never entirely wanting. The carriage of  the tail also varies, but except in a few breeds bred especially for low  tails it is noticeably high as compared with that of other poultry.  Fowls are readily distinguished from other birds by the voice. The male  crows, the female cackles. These are their most common calls, but there  are other notes--some common to both sexes, some peculiar to one--which  are the same in all races of fowls. An abrupt, harsh croak warns the  flock that one of their number has discerned a hawk or noticed something  suspicious in the air.

I really didn't think you  knew. But I don't believe you know where your papa keeps his bake-shop,  where he makes all those nice cakes and cookies you eat.\"    Billee began to laugh again.    \"You can't fool me, Mr. Santa Claus,\" he said. \"I know my papa don't  keep a bake-shop just as well as you do. My papa owns a bank.\"    \"Splendid! Made of tin, I suppose, with a nice little hole at the top  to drop pennies into?\" said Santa Claus.    \"No, it ain't, either!\" retorted Little Billee. \"It's made of stone, and  has more than a million windows in it. I went down there with my mama to  papa's office the other day, so I guess I ought to know.\"    \"Well, I should say so,\" said Santa Claus. \"Nobody better. By the way,  Billee, what does your mama call your papa? 'Billee,' like you?\" he  added.    \"Oh, no, indeed,\" returned Little Billee. \"She calls him papa, except  once in a while when he's going away, and then she says, 'Good-by,  Tom.'\"    \"Fine again!\" said Santa Claus, blowing upon his fingers, for, now that  the sun had completely disappeared over in the west, it was getting  very cold. \"Thomas Harrison, banker,\" he muttered to himself. \"What with  the telephone-book and the city directory, I guess we can find our way  home with Little Billee.\"    \"Do you think we can go now, Mr. Santa Claus?\" asked Little Billee, for  the cold was beginning to cut through his little coat, and the sandman  had started to scatter the sleepy-seeds all around.    \"Yes, sirree!\" returned Santa Claus promptly. \"Right away off now  instantly at once! I'm afraid I can't get my reindeer here in time to  take us up to the house, but we can go in the cars--hum! I don't know  whether we can or not, come to think of it. Ah, do you happen to have  ten cents in your pocket?\" Santa added with an embarrassed air. \"You  see, I've left my pocketbook in the sleigh with my toy-pack; and,  besides, mine is only toy-money, and they won't take that on the cars.\"    \"I got twenty-fi' cents,\" said Little Billee proudly, as he dug his way  down into his pocket and brought the shining silver piece to light. \"You  can have it, if you want it.\"    \"Thank you,\" said Santa Claus, taking the proffered coin. \"We'll start  home right away; only come in here first, while I telephone to  Santaville, telling the folks where I am.\"    He led the little fellow into a public telephone station, where he  eagerly scanned the names in the book. At last it was found--\"Thomas  Harrison, seven-six-five-four Plaza.\" And then, in the seclusion of the  telephone-booth, Santa Claus sent the gladdest of all Christmas messages  over the wire to two distracted parents:    \"_I have found your boy wandering in the street. He is safe, and I will  bring him home right away._\"      III    Fifteen minutes later, there might have been seen the strange spectacle  of a foot-sore Santa Claus leading a sleepy little boy up Fifth Avenue  to a cross-street, which shall be nameless. The boy vainly endeavored to  persuade his companion to \"come in and meet mama.\"    \"No, Billee,\" the old man replied sadly, \"I must hurry back. You see,  kiddie, this is my busy day. Besides, I never go into a house except  through the chimney. I wouldn't know how to behave, going in at a front  door.\"    But it was not to be as Santa Claus willed, for Little Billee's papa,  and his mama, and his brothers and sisters, and the butler and the  housemaids, and two or three policemen, were waiting at the front door  when they arrived.    \"Aha!\" said one of the police, seizing Santa Claus roughly by the arm.  \"We've landed you, all right! Where have you been with this boy?\"    \"You let him alone!\" cried Little Billee, with more courage than he had  ever expected to show in the presence of a policeman. \"He's a friend of  mine.\"    \"That's right, officer,\" said Little Billee's father; \"let him alone--I  haven't entered any complaint against this man.\"    \"But you want to look out for these fellers, Mr. Harrison,\" returned  the officer. \"First thing you know they'll be makin' a trade of this  sort of thing.\"    \"I'm no grafter!\" retorted Santa Claus indignantly. \"I found the little  chap wandering along the street, and, as soon as I was able to locate  where he lived, I brought him home. That's all there is to it.\"    \"He knew where I lived all along,\" laughed Little Billee, \"only he  pretended he didn't, just to see if I knew.\"    \"You see, sir,\" said the officer, \"it won't do him any harm to let him  cool his heels--\"    \"It is far better that he should warm them, officer,\" said Mr. Harrison  kindly. \"And he can do that here. Come in, my man,\" he added, turning  to Santa Claus with a grateful smile. \"Just for a minute anyhow. Mrs.  Harrison will wish to thank you for bringing our boy back to us. We have  had a terrible afternoon.\"    \"That's all right, sir,\" said Santa Claus modestly. \"It wasn't anything,  sir. I didn't really find him--it was him as found me, sir. He took me  for the real thing, I guess.\"    Nevertheless, Santa Claus, led by Little Billee's persistent father,  went into the house. Now that the boy could see him in the full glare of  many electric lights, his furs did not seem the most gorgeous things in  the world. When the flapping front of his red jacket flew open, the  child was surprised to see how ragged was the thin gray coat it  covered; and as for the good old saint's comfortable stomach--strange to  say, it was not!    \"I--I wish you all a merry Christmas,\" faltered Santa Claus; \"but I  really must be going, sir--\"    \"Nonsense!\" cried Mr. Harrison. \"Not until you have got rid of this  chill, and--\"    \"I can't stay, sir,\" said Santa. \"I'll lose my job if I do.\"    \"Well, what if you do? I'll give you a better one,\" said the banker.    \"I can't--I can't!\" faltered the man. \"I--I--I've got a Little Billee of  my own at home waitin' for me, sir. If I hadn't,\" he added fiercely, \"do  you suppose I'd be doin' this?\" He pointed at the painted boards, and  shuddered. \"It's him as has kept me from--from the river!\" he muttered  hoarsely; and then this dispenser of happiness to so many millions of  people all the world over sank into a chair, and, covering his face with  his hands, wept like a child.    \"I guess Santa Claus is tired, papa,\" said Little Billee, snuggling up  closely to the old fellow and taking hold of his hand sympathetically.  \"He's been walkin' a lot to-day.\"    \"Yes, my son,\" said Mr. Harrison gravely. \"These are very busy times for  Santa Claus, and I guess that, as he still has a hard night ahead of  him, James had better ring up Henry and tell him to bring the car around  right away, so that we may take him back--to his little boy. We'll have  to lend him a fur coat to keep the wind off, too, for it is a bitter  night.\"    \"Oh,\" said Little Billee, \"I haven't told you about these boards he  wears. He has 'em to keep the wind off, and they're fine, papa!\" Little  Billee pointed to the two sign-boards which Santa Claus had leaned  against the wall. \"He says he uses 'em on cold nights,\" the lad went on.  \"They have writing on 'em, too. Do you know what it says?\"    \"Yes,\" said Mr. Harrison, glancing at the boards. \"It says 'If You Want  a Good Christmas Dinner for a Quarter, Go to Smithers's Cafe.'\"    Little Billee roared with laughter.    \"Papa's trying to fool me, just as you did when you pretended not to  know where I lived, Santa Claus,\" he said, looking up into the old  fellow's face, his own countenance brimming over with mirth. \"You  mustn't think he can't read, though,\" the lad added hastily. \"He's only  joking.\"    \"Oh, no, indeed, I shouldn't have thought that,\" replied Santa Claus,  smiling through his tears.    \"I've been joking, have I?\" said Little Billee's papa. \"Well, then, Mr.  Billiam, suppose you inform me what it says on those boards.\"    \"'Merry Christmas to Everybody,'\" said Little Billee proudly. \"I  couldn't read it myself, but he told me what it said. He has it printed  there so that if he misses saying it to anybody, they'll know he means  it just the same.\"    \"By Jove, Mr. Santa Claus,\" cried Little Billee's papa, grasping the old  man warmly by the hand, \"I owe you ten million apologies! I haven't  believed in you for many a long year; but now, sir, I take it all back.  You do exist, and, by the great horn spoon, you are the real thing!\"      IV    Little Billee had the satisfaction of acting as host to Santa Claus at a  good, luscious dinner, which Santa Claus must have enjoyed very much,  because, when explaining why he was so hungry, it came out that the poor  old chap had been so busy all day that he had not had time to get any  lunch--no, not even one of those good dinners at Smithers's cafe, to  which Little Billee's father had jokingly referred. And after dinner  Henry came with the automobile, and, bidding everybody good night, Santa  Claus and Little Billee's papa went out of the house together.    Christmas morning dawned, and Little Billee awoke from wonderful dreams  of rich gifts, and of extraordinary adventures with his new-found  friend, to find the reality quite as splendid as the dream things.  Later, what was his delight when a small boy, not much older than  himself--a pale, thin, but playful little fellow--arrived at the house  to spend the day with him, bringing with him a letter from Santa Claus  himself! This was what the letter said:        DEAR LITTLE BILLEE:--You must not tell anybody except your papa      and your mama, but the little boy who brings you this letter is      my little boy, and I am going to let you have him for a      playfellow for Christmas Day.
