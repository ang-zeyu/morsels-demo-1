[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3317"],[0,"Now It Can Be Told (#7)"],[1," best-decorated man in the army because he  had presided over a visitors' chateau and entertained Royalties,  Members of Parliament, Mrs. Humphry Ward, miners, Japanese, Russian  revolutionaries, Portuguese ministers, Harry Lauder, Swedes, Danes,  Norwegians, clergymen, Montenegrins, and the Editor of John Bull, at the  government's expense--and I am bound to say he deserved them all, being  a man of infinite tact, many languages, and a devastating sense of  humor. There was always a Charlie Chaplin film between moving pictures  of the battles of the Somme. He brought the actualities of war to the  visitors' chateau by sentry-boxes outside the door, a toy \"tank\" in the  front garden, and a collection of war trophies in the hall. He spoke to  High Personages with less deference than he showed to miners from Durham  and Wales, and was master of them always, ordering them sternly to bed  at ten o'clock (when he sat down to bridge with his junior officers),  and with strict military discipline insisting upon their inspection of  the bakeries at Boulogne, and boot-mending factories at Calais, as part  of the glory of war which they had come out for to see.    So it was that there were brilliant colors in the streets of Montreuil,  and at every doorway a sentry slapped his hand to his rifle, with smart  and untiring iteration, as the \"brains\" of the army, under \"brass hats\"  and red bands, went hither and thither in the town, looking stern, as  soldiers of grave responsibility, answering salutes absent--mindedly,  staring haughtily at young battalion officers who passed through  Montreuil and looked meekly for a chance of a lorry-ride to Boulogne, on  seven days' leave from the lines.    The smart society of G. H. Q. was best seen at the Officers' Club in  Montreuil, at dinner-time. It was as much like musical comedy as any  stage setting of war at the Gaiety. A band played ragtime and light  music while the warriors fed, and all these generals and staff officers,  with their decorations and arm-bands and polished buttons and crossed  swords, were waited upon by little W. A. A. C.'s with the G. H. Q.  colors tied up in bows on their hair, and khaki stockings under  their short skirts and fancy aprons. Such a chatter! Such bursts of  light-hearted laughter! Such whisperings of secrets and intrigues and  scandals in high places! Such careless--hearted courage when British  soldiers were being blown to bits, gassed, blinded, maimed, and  shell-shocked in places that were far--so very far--from G. H. Q.!          XI      There were shrill voices one morning outside the gate of our  quarters--women's voices, excited, angry, passionate. An orderly came  into the mess--we were at breakfast--and explained the meaning of  the clamor, which by some intuition and a quick ear for French he had  gathered from all this confusion of tongues.    \"There's a soldier up the road, drunk or mad. He has been attacking a  girl. The villagers want an officer to arrest him.\"    The colonel sliced off the top of his egg and then rose. \"Tell three  orderlies to follow me.\"    We went into the roadway, and twenty women crowded round us with a  story of attempted violence against an innocent girl. The man had been  drinking last night at the estaminet up there. Then he had followed  the girl, trying to make love to her. She had barricaded herself in the  room, when he tried to climb through the window.    \"If you don't come out I'll get in and kill you,\" he said, according to  the women.    But she had kept him out, though he prowled round all night. Now he was  hiding in an outhouse. The brute! The pig!    When we went up the road the man was standing in the center of it, with  a sullen look.    \"What's the trouble?\" he asked. \"It looks as if all France were out to  grab me.\"    He glanced sideways over the field, as though reckoning his chance of  escape. There was no chance.    The colonel placed him under arrest and he marched back between the  orderlies, with an old soldier of the Contemptibles behind him.    Later in the day he was lined up for identification by the girl, among a  crowd of other men.    The girl looked down the line, and we watched her curiously--a slim  creature with dark hair neatly coiled.    She stretched out her right hand with a pointing finger.    \"Le voila!... c'est l'homme.\"    There was no mistake about it, and the man looked sheepishly at her, not  denying. He was sent off under escort to the military prison in St. Omer  for court-martial.    \"What's the punishment--if guilty?\" I asked.    \"Death,\" said the colonel, resuming his egg.    He was a fine-looking fellow, the prisoner. He had answered the call for  king and country without delay. In the estaminet, after coming down from  the salient for a machine-gun course, he had drunk more beer than was  good for him, and the face of a pretty girl had bewitched him, stirring  up desire. He wanted to kiss her lips... There were no women in the  Ypres salient. Nothing pretty or soft. It was hell up there, and this  girl was a pretty witch, bringing back thoughts of the other side--for  life, womanhood, love, caresses which were good for the souls and bodies  of men. It was a starved life up there in the salient... Why shouldn't  she give him her lips? Wasn't he fighting for France? Wasn't he a  tall and proper lad? Curse the girl for being so sulky to an English  soldier!... And now, if those other women, those old hags, were to swear  against him things he had never said, things he had never done, unless  drink had made him forget--by God! supposing drink had made him forget?  He would be shot against a white wall. Shot dead, disgracefully,  shamefully, by his own comrades! O Christ! and the little mother in a  Sussex cottage!...          XII      Going up to Kemmel one day I had to wait in battalion headquarters  for the officer I had gone to see. He was attending a court martial.  Presently he came into the wooden hut, with a flushed face.    \"Sorry I had to keep you,\" he said. \"Tomorrow there will be one swine  less in the world.\"    \"A death sentence?\"    He nodded.    \"A damned coward. Said he didn't mind rifle-fire, but couldn't stand  shells. Admitted he left his post. He doesn't mind rifle-fire!... Well,  tomorrow morning.\"    The officer laughed grimly, and then listened for a second.    There were some heavy crumps falling over Kemmel Hill, rather close, it  seemed, to our wooden hut.    \"Damn those German gunners\" said the officer. \"Why can't they give us a  little peace?\"    He turned to his papers, but several times while I talked with him he  jerked his head up and listened to a heavy crash.    On the way back I saw a man on foot, walking in front of a mounted man,  past the old hill of the Scherpenberg, toward the village of Locre.  There was something in the way he walked, in his attitude--the head  hunched forward a little, and his arms behind his back--which made me  turn to look at him. He was manacled, and tied by a rope to the mounted  man. I caught one glimpse of his face, and then turned away, cold and  sick. There was doom written on his face, and in his eyes a captured  look. He was walking to his wall.          XIII      There were other men who could not stand shell-fire. It filled them with  an animal terror and took all will-power out of them. One young officer  was like that man who \"did not mind rifle-fire.\" He, by some strange  freak of psychology, was brave under machine-gun fire. He had done  several gallant things, and was bright and cheerful in the trenches  until the enemy barraged them with high explosive. Then he was seen  wandering back to the support trenches in a dazed way. It happened three  times, and he was sentenced to death. Before going out at dawn to face  the firing-squad he was calm. There was a lighted candle on the table,  and he sorted out his personal belongings and made small packages of  them as keepsakes for his family and friends. His hand did not tremble.  When his time came he put out the candle, between thumb and finger,  raised his hand, and said, \"Right O!\"    Another man, shot for cowardice in face of the enemy, was sullen and  silent to one who hoped to comfort him in the last hour. The chaplain  asked him whether he had any message for his relatives. He said, \"I have  no relatives.\" He was asked whether he would like to say any prayers,  and he said, \"I don't believe in them.\" The chaplain talked to him, but  could get no answer--and time was creeping on. There were two guards in  the room, sitting motionless, with loaded rifles between their knees.  Outside it was silent in the courtyard, except for little noises of the  night and the wind. The chaplain suffered, and was torn with pity  for that sullen man whose life was almost at an end. He took out his  hymn--book and said: \"I will sing to you. It will pass the time.\" He  sang a hymn, and once or twice his voice broke a little, but he steadied  it. Then the man said, \"I will sing with you.\" He knew all the hymns,  words and music. It was an unusual, astonishing knowledge, and he went  on singing, hymn after hymn, with the chaplain by his side. It was  the chaplain who tired first. His voice cracked and his throat became  parched. Sweat broke out on his forehead, because of the nervous strain.  But the man who was going to die sang on in a clear, hard voice. A faint  glimmer of coming dawn lightened the cottage window. There were not many  minutes more. The two guards shifted their feet. \"Now,\" said the man,  \"we'll sing 'God Save the King.'\" The two guards rose and stood at  attention, and the chaplain sang the national anthem with the man who  was to be shot for cowardice. Then the tramp of the firing-party came  across the cobblestones in the courtyard. It was dawn.          XIV      Shell-shock was the worst thing to see. There were generals who said:  \"There is no such thing as shell-shock. It is cowardice. I would  court-martial in every"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3327"],[0,"Bulfinch's Mythology: The Age of Fable (#7)"],[1,"of physic, melody, and song.\"    The story of Apollo and Daphne is often alluded to by the poets.  Waller applies it to the case of one whose amatory verses, though  they did not soften the heart of his mistress, yet won for the  poet wide-spread fame.      \"Yet what he sung in his immortal strain,    Though unsuccessful, was not sung in vain.    All but the nymph that should redress his wrong,    Attend his passion and approve his song.    Like Phoebus thus, acquiring unsought praise,    He caught at love and filled his arms with bays.\"    The following stanza from Shelley's Adonais alludes to Byron's  early quarrel with the reviewers:--      \"The herded wolves, bold only to pursue;    The obscene ravens, clamorous o'er the dead;    The vultures, to the conqueror's banner true,    Who feed where Desolation first has fed.    And whose wings rain contagion; how they fled,    When like Apollo, from his golden bow,    The Pythian of the age one arrow sped    And smiled!  The spoilers tempt no second blow;    They fawn on the proud feet that spurn them as they go.\"        PYRAMUS AND THISBE    Pyramus was the handsomest youth, and Thisbe the fairest maiden,  in all Babylonia, where Semiramis reigned.  Their parents  occupied adjoining houses; and neighborhood brought the young  people together, and acquaintance ripened into love.  They would  gladly have married, but their parents forbade.  One thing,  however, they could not forbid   that love should glow with equal  ardor in the bosoms of both.  They conversed by signs and  glances, and the fire burned more intensely for being covered up.  In the wall that parted the two houses there was a crack, caused  by some fault in the structure.  No one had remarked it before,  but the lovers discovered it.  'What will love not discover?  It  afforded a passage to the voice; and tender messages used to pass  backward and forward through the gap.  As they stood, Pyramus on  this side, Thisbe on that, their breaths would mingle.  \"Cruel  wall,\" they said, \"why do you keep two lovers apart?  But we will  not be ungrateful.  We owe you, we confess, the privilege of  transmitting loving words to willing ears.\"  Such words they  uttered on different sides of the wall; and when night came and  they must say farewell, they pressed their lips upon the wall,  she on her side, he on his, as they could come no nearer.    One morning, when Aurora had put out the stars, and the sun had  melted the frost from the grass, they met at the accustomed spot.  Then, after lamenting their hard fate, they agreed that next  night, when all was still, they would slip away from watchful  eyes, leave their dwellings and walk out into the fields; and to  insure a meeting, repair to a well-known edifice, standing  without the city's bounds, called the tomb of Ninus, and that the  one who came first should await the other at the foot of a  certain tree.  It was a white mulberry tree and stood near a cool  spring.  All was agreed on, and they waited impatiently for the  sun to go down beneath the waters and night to rise up from them.  Then cautiously Thisbe stole forth, unobserved by the family, her  head covered with a veil, made her way to the monument and sat  down under the tree.  As she sat alone in the dim light of the  evening she descried a lioness, her jaws reeking with recent  slaughter, approaching the fountain to slake her thirst.  Thisbe  fled at the sight, and sought refuge in the hollow of a rock.  As  she fled she dropped her veil.  The lioness, after drinking at  the spring, turned to retreat to the woods, and seeing the veil  on the ground, tossed and rent it with her bloody mouth.    Pyramus, having been delayed, now approached the place of  meeting.  He saw in the sand the footsteps of the lion, and the  color fled from his cheeks at the sight.  Presently he found the  veil all rent and bloody.  \"Oh, hapless girl,\" said he, \"I have  been the cause of thy death!  Thou, more worthy of life than I,  hast fallen the first victim.  I will follow.  I am the guilty  cause, in tempting thee forth to a place of such peril, and not  being myself on the spot to guard thee.  Come forth, ye lions,  from the rocks, and tear this guilty body with your teeth\" He  took up the veil, carried it with him to the appointed tree, and  covered it with kisses and with tears.  \"My blood also shall  stain your texture,\" said he, and drawing his sword plunged it  into his heart.  The blood spurted from the wound, and tinged the  white mulberries of the tree all red; and sinking into the earth  reached the roots, so that the red color mounted through the  trunk to the fruit.    By this time, Thisbe, still trembling with fear, yet wishing not  to disappoint her lover, stepped cautiously forth, looking  anxiously for the youth, eager to tell him the danger she had  escaped.  When she came to the spot and saw the changed color of  the mulberries she doubted whether it was the same place.  While  she hesitated she saw the form of one struggling in the agonies  of death.  She started back, a shudder ran through her frame as a  ripple on the face of the still water when a sudden breeze sweeps  over it.  But as soon as she recognized her lover, she screamed  and beat her breast; embracing the lifeless body, pouring tears  into its wounds, and imprinting kisses on the cold lips.  \"Oh,  Pyramus,\" she cried, \"what has done this?  Answer me, Pyramus; it  is your own Thisbe that speaks.  Hear me, dearest, and lift that  drooping head!\"  At the name of Thisbe, Pyramus opened his eyes,  then closed them again.  She saw her veil stained with blood and  the scabbard empty of its sword.  \"Thy own hand has slain thee,  and for my sake,\" she said.  \"I too can be brave for once, and my  love is as strong as thine.  I will follow thee in death, for I  have been the cause; and death, which alone could part us, shall  not prevent my joining thee.  And ye, unhappy parents of us both,  deny us not our united request.  As love and death have joined  us, let one tomb contain us.  And thou, tree, retain the marks of  slaughter.  Let thy berries still serve for memorials of our  blood.\"  So saying, she plunged the sword into her breast.  Her  parents acceded to her wish; the gods also ratified it.  The two  bodies were buried in one sepulchre, and the tree ever after  brought forth purple berries, as it does to this day.    Moore, in the Sylph's Ball, speaking of Davy's Safety Lamp, is  reminded of the wall that separated Thisbe and her lover:--      \"O for that lamp's metallic gauze,    That curtain of protecting wire,    Which Davy delicately draws    Around illicit, dangerous fire!      \"The wall he sets 'twixt Flame and Air,    (Like that which barred young Thisbe's bliss),    Through whose small holes this dangerous pair    May see each other, but not kiss.\"    In Mickle's translation of the Lusiad occurs the following  allusion to the story of Pyramus and Thisbe, and the  metamorphosis of the mulberries.  The poet is describing the  Island of Love.      \"here each gift Pomona's hand bestows    In cultured garden, free uncultured flows,    The flavor sweeter and the hue more fair    Than e'er was fostered by the hand of care.    The cherry here in shining crimson glows,    And stained with lover's blood, in pendent rows,    The mulberries o'erload the bending boughs.\"    If any of our young readers can be so hard-hearted as to enjoy a  laugh at the expense of poor Pyramus and Thisbe, they may find an  opportunity by turning to Shakespeare's play of Midsummer Night's  Dream, where it is most amusingly burlesqued.    Here is the description of the play and the characters by the  Prologue.      \"Gentles, perchance you wonder at this show;    But wonder on, till truth makes all things plain.    This man is Pyramus, if you would know;    This lovely lady Thisby is certain.      This man with lime and roughcast, doth present    Wall, that vile Wall, which did these lovers sunder;    And through Wall's chink, poor souls, they are content    To whisper.  At the which let no man wonder.    This man, with lanthorn, dog and bush of thorn,    Presenteth Moonshine; for, if you will know,    By Moonshine did these lovers think no scorn    To meet at Ninus' tomb, there, there to woo.    This grisly beast, which by name Lion hight.    The trusty Thisby, coming first by night,    Did scare away, or rather did affright;    And, as she fled, her mantle she did fall,    Which Lion vile with bloody mouth did stain.      Anon comes Pyramus, sweet youth and tall,    And finds his trusty Thisby's mantle slain;    Whereat with blade, with bloody blameful blade,    He bravely broached his boiling bloody breast;    And, Thisby, tarrying in mulberry shade,    His dagger drew and died.\"    Midsummer Night's Dream, v.1,128, et seq.      CEPHALUS AND PROCRIS    Cephalus was a beautiful youth and fond of manly sports.  He  would rise before the dawn to pursue the chase.  Aurora saw him  when she first looked forth, fell in love with him, and stole him  away.  But Cephalus was just married to a charming wife whom he  loved devotedly.  Her name was Procris.  She was a favorite of  Diana, the goddess of hunting, who had given her a dog which  could outrun every rival, and a javelin which would never fail of  its mark; and Procris gave these presents to her husband.  Cephalus was so happy in his wife that he resisted all the  entreaties of Aurora, and she finally dismissed him in  displeasure, saying, \"Go, ungrateful mortal, keep your wife,  whom, if I am not much mistaken, you will one day be very sorry  you ever saw again.\"    Cephalus returned, and was as happy as ever in his wife and his  woodland sports.  Now it happened some angry deity had sent a  ravenous fox to annoy the country; and the hunters turned out in  great strength to capture it.  Their efforts were all in vain; no  dog could run it down; and at last they came to Cephalus to  borrow his famous"]]]
