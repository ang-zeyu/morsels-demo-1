The ceremonious habits of the age  prevented anything like familiarity on the part of the younger  girls; but Jeanne and Virginie now always greeted him with a smile  when they met, and joined in conversation with him as with their  brothers in the evening.    The marquise, who had formerly protested, if playfully, against  her husband's whim in introducing an English boy into their family  circle, now regarded him with real affection, only refraining from  constant allusions to the debt she considered she owed him because  she saw that he really shrank from the subject.    The marquis shortly after this incident went to Paris for a fortnight  to ascertain from his friends there the exact position of things.  He returned depressed and angry.    The violence of the Assembly had increased from day to day.  The  property of all the convents had been confiscated, and this measure  had been followed by the seizure of the vast estates of the church.  All the privileges of the nobility had been declared at an end,  and in August a decree had been passed abolishing all titles of  nobility. This decree had taken effect in Paris and in the great  towns, and also in some parts of the country where the passions of  the people were most aroused against the nobility; but in Burgundy  it had remained a dead letter. The Marquis de St. Caux was popular  upon his estates, and no one had ever neglected to concede to  him and to the marquise their titles. He himself had regarded the  decree with disdain. \"They may take away my estates by force,\" he  said, \"but no law can deprive me of my title, any more than of the  name which I inherited from my fathers. Such laws as these are mere  outbursts of folly.\"    But the Assembly continued to pass laws of the most sweeping  description, assuming the sovereign power, and using it as no  monarch of France had ever ventured to do. Moderate men were shocked  at the headlong course of events, and numbers of those who at the  commencement of the movement had thrown themselves heart and soul  into it now shrank back in dismay at the strange tyranny which was  called liberty.    \"It seems to me that a general madness has seized all Paris,\" the  marquis said to his wife on his return, \"but at present nothing can  be done to arrest it. I have seen the king and queen. His majesty is  resolved to do nothing; that is, to let events take their course,  and what that will be Heaven only knows. The Assembly has taken  all power into its hands, the king is already a mere cipher, the  violence of the leaders of these men is beyond all bounds; the  queen is by turns hot and cold, at one moment she agrees with her  husband that the only hope lies in conceding  everything; at another  she would go to the army, place herself in its hands, and call on  it to march upon Paris.    \"At anyrate there is nothing to be done at present but to wait.  Already numbers of the deputies, terrified at the aspect of affairs,  have left France, and I am sorry to say many of the nobles have  also gone. This is cowardice and treachery to the king. We cannot  help him if he will not be helped, but it is our duty to remain  here ready to rally round him when he calls us to his side. I am  glad that the Assembly has passed a law confiscating the estates  of all who have emigrated.\"    Although the marquise was much alarmed at the news brought by her  husband she did not think of questioning his decision. It did not  seem to her possible that there could be danger for her and hers  in their quiet country chateau. There might be disturbance and  bloodshed, and even revolution, in Paris; but surely a mere echo  of this would reach them so far away.    \"Whenever you think it is right to go up and take your place by  the king I will go and take mine by the queen,\" she said quietly.  \"The children will be safe here; but of course we must do our duty.\"    The winter passed quietly at the chateau; there was none of the  usual gaiety, for a deep gloom hung over all the noble families  of the province; still at times great hunting parties were got up  for the chase of the wolves among the forests, for, when the snow  was on the ground, these often came down into the villages and  committed great depredations.          CHAPTER III    The Demon Wolf      Upon the first of these occasions Harry and Ernest were in high  spirits, for they were to take part in the chase. It was the first  time that Ernest had done so, for during the previous winter the  marquis had been in attendance on the court. At an early hour the  guests invited to take part in the chase began to assemble at the  chateau.  Many who lived at a distance had come overnight, and  the great court-yard presented a lively aspect with the horses  and attendants of the guests. A collation was spread in the great  hall, and the marquise and her eldest daughter moved about among  the guests saying a few words of welcome to each.    \"Who is that young man who is talking to mademoiselle your sister,  Ernest?\" Harry asked, for since the adventure with the mad dog the  ceremonious title had been dropped, and the boys addressed each  other by their Christian names.    \"That is Monsieur Lebat; he is the son of the Mayor of Dijon.  I  have not see him here before, but I suppose my father thinks it is  well in these times to do the civil thing to the people of Dijon.  He is a good-looking fellow too, but it is easy to see he is not  a man of good family.\"    \"I don't like his looks at all,\" Harry said shortly. \"Look what a  cringing air he puts on as he speaks to madame la marquise. And yet  I fancy he could be insolent when he likes. He may be good-looking,  but it is not a style I admire, with his thick lips and his  half-closed eyes. If I met him at home I should say the fellow was  something between a butcher and a Jew pedlar.\"    \"Well done, monsieur the aristocrat!\" Ernest said laughing.  \"This  is your English equality! Here is a poor fellow who is allowed to  take a place our of his station, thanks to the circumstances of  the time, and you run him down mercilessly!\"    \"I don't run him down because he is not a gentleman,\" Harry said.  \"I run him down because I don't like his face; and if he were the  son of a duke instead of the son of a mayor I should dislike it  just as much. You take my word for it, Ernest, that's a bad fellow.\"    \"Poor Monsieur Lebat!\" Ernest laughed. \"I daresay he is a very  decent fellow in his way.    \"I am sure he is not, Ernest; he has a cruel bad look. I would not  have been that fellow's fag at school for any money.    \"Well, it's fortunate, Harry, that you are not likely to see much  of him, else I should expect to see you flying at his neck and  strangling him as you did the hound.\"    Harry joined in the laugh.    \"I will restrain myself, Ernest; and besides, he would be an awkward  customer; there's plenty of strength in those shoulders of his, and  he looks active and sinewy in spite of that indolent air he puts  on; but there is the horn, it is time for us to mount.\"    In a few minutes some thirty gentlemen were in the saddle, the  marquis, who was grand louvetier of the province, blew his horn,  and the whole cavalcade got into motion, raising their hunting  caps, as they rode off, to the marquise and her daughters, who were  standing on the step of the chateau to see them depart. The dogs  had already been sent forward to the forest, which was some miles  distant.    On arriving there the marquis found several woodmen, who had been  for the last two days marking the places most frequented by the  wolves. They had given their reports and the party were just starting  when a young forester rode up.    \"Monsieur le marquis,\" he said, \"I have good news for you; the demon  wolf is in the forest. I saw him making his way along a glade an  hour since as I was on my way thither. I turned back to follow him,  and tracked him to a ravine in the hills choked with undergrowth.\"    The news created great excitement.    \"The demon wolf!\" the marquis repeated. \"Are you sure?\"    \"Quite sure, monsieur. How could I mistake it! I saw him once four  years ago, and no one who had once done so could mistake any other  wolf for him.\"    \"We are in luck indeed, gentlemen,\" the marquis said. \"We will see  if we can't bring this fellow's career to an end at last. I have  hunted him a score of times myself since my first chase of him,  well-nigh fifteen years ago, but he has  always given us the slip.\"    \"And will again,\" an old forester, who was standing close to Harry,  muttered. \"I do not believe the bullet is cast which will bring  that wolf to earth.\"    \"What is this demon wolf?\" Harry asked Ernest.    \"It is a wolf of extraordinary size and fierceness. For many years  he has been the terror of the mothers of this part of France. He  has been known to go into a village and boldly carry off an infant  in mid-day. Every child who has been killed by wolves for years is  always supposed to have been slain by this wolf. Sometimes he is  seen in one part of the province, and sometimes in another.    \"For months he is not heard of. Then there is slaughter among the  young lambs. A child going to school, or an old woman carrying  home a faggot from the forest is found torn and partly devoured,  and the news spreads that the demon wolf has returned to the  neighbourhood. Great hunts have over and over again been got up  specially to slay him, but he seems to lead a charmed life. He has  been shot at over and over again, but he seems to be bullet-proof.    \"The peasants regard him not as an ordinary wolf but as a demon,  and mothers quiet their children when they cry by saying that if  they are not good the demon wolf will carry them off.  Ah,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37856"],[0,"The Determined Angler and the Brook Trout (#7)"],[1,"without the slightest effort on the part of the Angler.    When the fish is hooked he should not be flaunted in the air, as the  boy fisher yanks his pond perch. The prize should be handled as if he  were but slightly secured, his head should be kept under water, the  line kept gently taut, and the fish softly led out of noisy water and  away from stones, long grass, submerged tree branches or logs.    If the catch is heavy enough to draw the line from the reel it is  allowed to do so, but the line should be kept taut and reeled in the  second he hesitates. There need be no hurry.    After a little while the game's rushes will cease; then it should be  reeled in, care being taken not to arouse it again by the contact of a  weed or stone.    The tip of the rod is now raised over the head and back of the Angler  until the butt points downward; then, if the fish has been reeled in  near enough, it is secured in the landing net, tail first, and  carefully slid into the creel through the little square opening for  this purpose in the lid.    If you, reader mine, should some day get as far as this glorious part  of the play, and the fish should be a small one, be satisfied; the  true Angler is ever of a contented heart; if the fish should be too  small, set it free--the true Angler is always humane and generous; if  it should prove fit to feed upon, do not subject it to unnecessary  suffering--skillfully kill it outright at once; the true Angler is  manly and merciful.    And, and--good luck to you, brother.          CHAPTER V    WALTON'S WAY    \"More than half the intense enjoyment of fly-fishing is derived from  the beautiful surroundings.\"--CHARLES F. ORVIS.      A clause in a recent tariff bill prohibited the importation of some of  the favorite artificial flies of the Angler and likewise prohibited  the importation of the materials used in making these flies,  particularly feathers and skins of the valuable song birds whose  insect-eating prevents the destruction of the trees and other foliage  absolutely necessary to the preservation of the planet upon which man  lives.    This clause was fathered by the wise and welcome bird-protecting  institutions known as the Audubon Societies, and was intended to stop  the infamous traffic in wild birds for millinery purposes, which, if  not reformed, means the utter extermination of the world's feathered  friends.    The feathers and skins imported annually for artificial flies were to  come under the same prohibition as millinery feathers.    England has a law prohibiting the importation of certain plumage, but  specific exception is made for the materials used in fly-making.    There was a foolish opposition to this clause on the part of a few  professional fly tiers, some of the fly dealers, and a lot of  fishermen, and these men and women were loud in their declaration that  the Angler is also opposed to the clause, which, if allowed, they  think would injure the business of the professional fly maker, fly  dealer, _et al._    Now the truth is: No Angler was opposed to the clause, and the claim  that the protection of valuable tree-saving birds would hurt trade of  any sort is absurd. The same sort of foolish objection was made to the  introduction of the sewing-machine--it was said it would prevent a lot  of hand-sewing workmen from making a living. In a few years man will  laugh at this silly and selfish individual cry against bird-protection  with the same ridiculous spirit with which he now laughs at the old  idiotic objection to the sewing-machine.    A writer in the New York _Sun_ says: \"The first effect of prohibiting  the importation of the feathers for flies will be to drive many back  to bait-fishing. An Angler using bait should take ten trout for every  one he could kill with a fly. The Government, the States, and clubs  are spending large sums for the stocking of streams with trout. The  expenditure would scarcely be justified if there is to be bait-fishing  in these streams--they would soon be fished out. Thousands who  formerly used bait have taken up fly-fishing because it is better  sport.\"    What does this writer mean by the word \"many\"--the \"many\" he thinks  that will be driven back to bait fishing as the effect of the  prohibition of the importation of the feathers for flies? Many what?  Not Anglers, by any means, because the Angler would rather merely try  to catch his trout with an artificial fly made from a feather duster  than to be assured of catching the game with a worm or minnow or  salmon egg. The \"many\" refers to fishermen, or professional fly tiers,  not Anglers.    The Angler and the ordinary fisherman are as far separated in  character and nature as the hummingbird and the buzzard are separated  in life and lesson.    The real opposer to bird-protection in this objection to the clause  prohibiting the importation of bird feathers and skins is the  commercial fellow, and there is no commercial side to angling.    The Angler is a student as well as a lover of nature, and he knows  that without the insect-eating birds there can be no trees, that  without trees there can be no waters, that without waters there can be  no fishes, and that without fishes there can be no fishing. The stupid  fisherman can't surmount this, and the commercial fly tier, whose  business alone teaches him enough of the angling art to be able to  figure this natural science, thinks too much of his money creel to  admit it. This pretended ignorance is called good business instinct,  and the Angler doesn't object to men minding their own business, but  when business instinct runs wild and evokes the effrontery to imply  that the Angler, a non-commercial being, is opposed to the prohibition  of earth-valuable bird extermination, business instinct is going a  little too far with its money-mad method.    The Angler does not condemn the use of correct tackle; he's a believer  in it, and just as he is sincere in his advocacy of proper tackle and  in his immaculate use of proper tackle, so is he sincere in his  profound belief in correct methods in fishing.    The fisherman--the fellow who judges his day by the number of fishes  he kills in any manner regardless of season and size--may resort to  dynamite, and he may not be in sympathy with any of the chivalric  means, manners, and methods of any of the worldly matters, but the  Angler is not of this stamp.    Izaak Walton, the father of fishing, never posed for his portrait with  half a hundred dead fishes tied to his body. Ferns, feathered friends,  flowers, fair skies, fine fishing tackle, _and_ fishes embellished his  pictures.    The fish, to the Angler, is only one feature--no doubt the main  feature--of his favorite pastime, and the killing of the fish is not a  pleasant part of his pursuit; the death of the game is, to the Angler,  a sad incident, however happy the fisherman may be over the slaughter  of his greedy mess, and the Angler, therefore, could not possibly  derive the delights of his angling at the sacrifice of the lordly  winged creatures he so repeatedly thanks his Master for.    Who ever read an Angler's story without the song birds in it? The  expression \"gentle art\" is applied to angling and the Angler. Who ever  heard of the gentle art of fishing! And angling is a _gentle_ art; so,  to practice it, one must be gentle.    The Angler will not resort to fishing with live bait if the few  European artificial flies are excluded from his lures, because he can  catch all the fishes his _gentle_ art _entitles_ him to with the flies  of home make.    The artificial flies of England, Scotland, and Ireland are lovely  creations of practical as well as beautiful design, and the Angler  adores them, but, since his _gentle_ creel can be filled without them,  he'll not insist on their importation if it tends in the slightest  manner toward the extermination of the very things that make possible  the gentle art of angling--the birds and the trees, without which the  fishes themselves could not survive.    The world is not composed entirely of fishermen--the earth itself  should not be sacrificed for a few against the multitude--and the  Angler, the fisherman of quality, is wise enough to appreciate this;  his individual pastime is not as important as the general welfare of  the masses, and it will be said that the fisherman, who estimates  quantity over quality, is far less entitled to consideration.    Angling is a pastime of a craft; the birds, the trees, and the waters  are necessities of a planet and its people.    Fishing for the market--a distinct method from that of the Angler and  the common fisherman who fishes for the mere sake of killing and  counting--is not concerned in this argument, and may be dismissed with  a brief word of commendation. Legitimately practiced, discriminately  carried on according to the law of man and nature, it is even more  admirable than angling and far more honorable than the wasteful  pursuit of the vulgar amateur fisherman. Our Saviour sanctioned net  fishing; chose simple fishermen for his disciples--St. Andrew, St.  Peter, St. James, and St. John.    The expression, \"fly fisherman,\" may refer to the fisherman or the  Angler, for there are lots of fly fishermen as well as mere fishermen  who are not Anglers, for the reason that fly-fishing, indulged in by a  greedy hand, can permit of ungentle fish-catching the same as  bait-fishing. Both methods are equally destructive if not followed  with strict rules of angling, and all that need be said to properly  define angling is that it is the poetry--the art and refinement--of  fishing. The common fisherman is simply a fish-basket filler; the  Angler fills his soul, not the creel.          CHAPTER VI    THE WANTON WAY    \"There's an Angler's law, and a court or legal law.
