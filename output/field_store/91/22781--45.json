A few days after her arrival  Gilbert Osmond descended from Florence and remained three weeks, during  which the fact of her being with his old friend Madame Merle, in whose  house she had gone to lodge, made it virtually inevitable that he  should see her every day. When the last of April came she wrote to Mrs.  Touchett that she should now rejoice to accept an invitation given long  before, and went to pay a visit at Palazzo Crescentini, Madame Merle on  this occasion remaining in Rome. She found her aunt alone; her cousin  was still at Corfu. Ralph, however, was expected in Florence from day  to day, and Isabel, who had not seen him for upwards of a year, was  prepared to give him the most affectionate welcome.        CHAPTER XXXII    It was not of him, nevertheless, that she was thinking while she stood  at the window near which we found her a while ago, and it was not of any  of the matters I have rapidly sketched. She was not turned to the past,  but to the immediate, impending hour. She had reason to expect a scene,  and she was not fond of scenes. She was not asking herself what she  should say to her visitor; this question had already been answered. What  he would say to her--that was the interesting issue. It could be nothing  in the least soothing--she had warrant for this, and the conviction  doubtless showed in the cloud on her brow. For the rest, however, all  clearness reigned in her; she had put away her mourning and she walked  in no small shimmering splendour. She only, felt older--ever so much,  and as if she were \"worth more\" for it, like some curious piece in an  antiquary's collection. She was not at any rate left indefinitely to her  apprehensions, for a servant at last stood before her with a card on his  tray. \"Let the gentleman come in,\" she said, and continued to gaze out  of the window after the footman had retired. It was only when she had  heard the door close behind the person who presently entered that she  looked round.    Caspar Goodwood stood there--stood and received a moment, from head to  foot, the bright, dry gaze with which she rather withheld than offered  a greeting. Whether his sense of maturity had kept pace with Isabel's  we shall perhaps presently ascertain; let me say meanwhile that to  her critical glance he showed nothing of the injury of time. Straight,  strong and hard, there was nothing in his appearance that spoke  positively either of youth or of age; if he had neither innocence nor  weakness, so he had no practical philosophy. His jaw showed the same  voluntary cast as in earlier days; but a crisis like the present had in  it of course something grim. He had the air of a man who had travelled  hard; he said nothing at first, as if he had been out of breath. This  gave Isabel time to make a reflexion: \"Poor fellow, what great things  he's capable of, and what a pity he should waste so dreadfully his  splendid force! What a pity too that one can't satisfy everybody!\" It  gave her time to do more to say at the end of a minute: \"I can't tell  you how I hoped you wouldn't come!\"    \"I've no doubt of that.\" And he looked about him for a seat. Not only  had he come, but he meant to settle.    \"You must be very tired,\" said Isabel, seating herself, and generously,  as she thought, to give him his opportunity.    \"No, I'm not at all tired. Did you ever know me to be tired?\"    \"Never; I wish I had! When did you arrive?\"    \"Last night, very late; in a kind of snail-train they call the express.  These Italian trains go at about the rate of an American funeral.\"    \"That's in keeping--you must have felt as if you were coming to bury  me!\" And she forced a smile of encouragement to an easy view of their  situation. She had reasoned the matter well out, making it perfectly  clear that she broke no faith and falsified no contract; but for all  this she was afraid of her visitor. She was ashamed of her fear; but she  was devoutly thankful there was nothing else to be ashamed of. He looked  at her with his stiff insistence, an insistence in which there was such  a want of tact; especially when the dull dark beam in his eye rested on  her as a physical weight.    \"No, I didn't feel that; I couldn't think of you as dead. I wish I  could!\" he candidly declared.    \"I thank you immensely.\"    \"I'd rather think of you as dead than as married to another man.\"    \"That's very selfish of you!\" she returned with the ardour of a real  conviction. \"If you're not happy yourself others have yet a right to  be.\"    \"Very likely it's selfish; but I don't in the least mind your saying so.  I don't mind anything you can say now--I don't feel it. The cruellest  things you could think of would be mere pin-pricks. After what you've  done I shall never feel anything--I mean anything but that. That I shall  feel all my life.\"    Mr. Goodwood made these detached assertions with dry deliberateness,  in his hard, slow American tone, which flung no atmospheric colour over  propositions intrinsically crude. The tone made Isabel angry rather than  touched her; but her anger perhaps was fortunate, inasmuch as it gave  her a further reason for controlling herself. It was under the pressure  of this control that she became, after a little, irrelevant. \"When did  you leave New York?\"    He threw up his head as if calculating. \"Seventeen days ago.\"    \"You must have travelled fast in spite of your slow trains.\"    \"I came as fast as I could. I'd have come five days ago if I had been  able.\"    \"It wouldn't have made any difference, Mr. Goodwood,\" she coldly smiled.    \"Not to you--no. But to me.\"    \"You gain nothing that I see.\"    \"That's for me to judge!\"    \"Of course. To me it seems that you only torment yourself.\" And then, to  change the subject, she asked him if he had seen Henrietta Stackpole.  He looked as if he had not come from Boston to Florence to talk of  Henrietta Stackpole; but he answered, distinctly enough, that this young  lady had been with him just before he left America. \"She came to see  you?\" Isabel then demanded.    \"Yes, she was in Boston, and she called at my office. It was the day I  had got your letter.\"    \"Did you tell her?\" Isabel asked with a certain anxiety.    \"Oh no,\" said Caspar Goodwood simply; \"I didn't want to do that. She'll  hear it quick enough; she hears everything.\"    \"I shall write to her, and then she'll write to me and scold me,\" Isabel  declared, trying to smile again.    Caspar, however, remained sternly grave. \"I guess she'll come right  out,\" he said.    \"On purpose to scold me?\"    \"I don't know. She seemed to think she had not seen Europe thoroughly.\"    \"I'm glad you tell me that,\" Isabel said. \"I must prepare for her.\"    Mr. Goodwood fixed his eyes for a moment on the floor; then at last,  raising them, \"Does she know Mr. Osmond?\" he enquired.    \"A little. And she doesn't like him. But of course I don't marry to  please Henrietta,\" she added. It would have been better for poor Caspar  if she had tried a little more to gratify Miss Stackpole; but he didn't  say so; he only asked, presently, when her marriage would take place. To  which she made answer that she didn't know yet. \"I can only say it will  be soon. I've told no one but yourself and one other person--an old  friend of Mr. Osmond's.\"    \"Is it a marriage your friends won't like?\" he demanded.    \"I really haven't an idea. As I say, I don't marry for my friends.\"    He went on, making no exclamation, no comment, only asking questions,  doing it quite without delicacy. \"Who and what then is Mr. Gilbert  Osmond?\"    \"Who and what? Nobody and nothing but a very good and very honourable  man. He's not in business,\" said Isabel. \"He's not rich; he's not known  for anything in particular.\"    She disliked Mr. Goodwood's questions, but she said to herself that she  owed it to him to satisfy him as far as possible. The satisfaction poor  Caspar exhibited was, however, small; he sat very upright, gazing at  her. \"Where does he come from? Where does he belong?\"    She had never been so little pleased with the way he said \"belawng.\" \"He  comes from nowhere. He has spent most of his life in Italy.\"    \"You said in your letter he was American. Hasn't he a native place?\"    \"Yes, but he has forgotten it. He left it as a small boy.\"    \"Has he never gone back?\"    \"Why should he go back?\" Isabel asked, flushing all defensively. \"He has  no profession.\"    \"He might have gone back for his pleasure. Doesn't he like the United  States?\"    \"He doesn't know them. Then he's very quiet and very simple--he contents  himself with Italy.\"    \"With Italy and with you,\" said Mr. Goodwood with gloomy plainness and  no appearance of trying to make an epigram. \"What has he ever done?\" he  added abruptly.    \"That I should marry him? Nothing at all,\" Isabel replied while her  patience helped itself by turning a little to hardness. \"If he had done  great things would you forgive me any better? Give me up, Mr. Goodwood;  I'm marrying a perfect nonentity. Don't try to take an interest in him.  You can't.\"    \"I can't appreciate him; that's what you mean. And you don't mean in  the least that he's a perfect nonentity. You think he's grand, you think  he's great, though no one else thinks so.\"    Isabel's colour deepened; she felt this really acute of her companion,  and it was certainly a proof of the aid that passion might render  perceptions she had never taken for fine. \"Why do you always come back  to what others think? I can't discuss Mr. Osmond with you.\"    \"Of course not,\" said Caspar reasonably. And he sat there with his air  of stiff helplessness, as if not only this were true, but there were  nothing else that they might discuss.    \"You see how little you gain,\" she accordingly broke out--\"how little  comfort or satisfaction I can give you.\"    \"I didn't expect you to give me much.\"    \"I don't understand then why you came.\"    \"I came because I wanted to see you once"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28346"],[0,"Deathworld (#7)"],[1,"leave the ship when we land. You _should_ be safe enough aboard,  and I'll be flying a cargo out within a few weeks.\"    \"I'll promise nothing of the sort. I'll leave when I want to leave.\"  Jason knew there was logic in her words, but his back was up at her  automatic superiority.    Meta finished the jump settings without another word. There was a  tension in the room that prevented them both from talking.    It was the next shipday before he saw her again, then it was completely  by accident. She was in the astrogation dome when he entered, looking up  at the sparkling immensity of the jump sky. For the first time he saw  her off duty, wearing something other than a shipsuit. This was a loose,  soft robe that accentuated her beauty.    She smiled at him. \"The stars are so wonderful,\" she said. \"Come look.\"  Jason came close to her and with an unthinking, almost automatic  movement, put his arm around her. Neither did she resent it, for she  covered his hand with hers. Then they kissed and it was just the way he  knew it would be.          VI.      After that they were together constantly. When Meta was on duty he  brought her meals to the bridge and they talked. Jason learned little  more about her world since, by unspoken agreement, they didn't discuss  it. He talked of the many planets he had visited and the people he had  known. She was an appreciative listener and the time went quickly by.  They enjoyed each other's company and it was a wonderful trip.    Then it ended.    There were fourteen people aboard the ship, yet Jason had never seen  more than two or three at a time. There was a fixed rotation of duties  that they followed in the ship's operation. When not on duty the Pyrrans  minded their own business in an intense and self-sufficient manner. Only  when the ship came out of jump and the PA barked _assembly_ did they all  get together.    Kerk was giving orders for the landing and questions were snapped back  and forth. It was all technical and Jason didn't bother following it. It  was the attitude of the Pyrrans that drew his attention. Their talk  tended to be faster now as were their motions. They were like soldiers  preparing for battle.    Their sameness struck Jason for the first time. Not that they looked  alike or did the same things. It was the _way_ they moved and reacted  that caused the striking similarity. They were like great, stalking  cats. Walking fast, tense and ready to spring at all times, their eyes  never still for an instant.    Jason tried to talk to Meta after the meeting, but she was almost a  stranger. She answered in monosyllables and her eyes never met his, just  brushed over them and went on. There was nothing he could really say so  she moved to leave. He started to put his hand out to stop her--then  thought better of it. There would be other times to talk.    Kerk was the only one who took any notice of him--and then only to order  him to an acceleration couch.    Meta's landings were infinitely worse than her take-offs. At least when  she landed on Pyrrus. There were sudden acceleration surges in every  direction. At one point there was a free fall that seemed endless. There  were loud thuds against the hull that shook the framework of the ship.  It was more like a battle than a landing, and Jason wondered how much  truth there was in that.    When the ship finally landed Jason didn't even know it. The constant  2 G's felt like deceleration. Only the descending moan of the ship's  engines convinced him they were down. Unbuckling the straps and sitting  up was an effort.    Two G's don't seem that bad--at first. Walking required the same  exertion as would carrying a man of his own weight on his shoulders.  When Jason lifted his arm to unlatch the door it was heavy as two arms.  He shuffled slowly towards the main lock.    [Illustration]    They were all there ahead of him, two of the men rolling transparent  cylinders from a nearby room. From their obvious weight and the way they  clanged when they bumped, Jason knew they were made of transparent  metal. He couldn't conceive any possible use for them. Empty cylinders a  meter in diameter, longer than a man. One end solid, the other hinged  and sealed. It wasn't until Kerk spun the sealing wheel and opened one  of them that their use became apparent.    \"Get in,\" Kerk said. \"When you're locked inside you'll be carried out of  the ship.\"    \"Thank you, no,\" Jason told him. \"I have no particular desire to make a  spectacular landing on your planet sealed up like a packaged sausage.\"    \"Don't be a fool,\" was Kerk's snapped answer. \"We're _all_ going out in  these tubes. We've been away too long to risk the surface without  reorientation.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Jason did feel a little foolish as he saw the others getting into tubes.  He picked the nearest one, slid into it feet first, and pulled the lid  closed. When he tightened the wheel in the center, it squeezed down  against a flexible seal. Within a minute the CO{2} content in the closed  cylinder went up and an air regenerator at the bottom hummed into life.    Kerk was the last one in. He checked the seals on all the other tubes  first, then jabbed the air-lock override release. As it started cycling  he quickly sealed himself in the remaining cylinder. Both inner and  outer locks ground slowly open and dim light filtered in through sheets  of falling rain.    For Jason, the whole thing seemed an anticlimax. All this preparation  for absolutely nothing. Long, impatient minutes passed before a lift  truck appeared driven by a Pyrran. He loaded the cylinders onto his  truck like so much dead cargo. Jason had the misfortune to be buried at  the bottom of the pile so he could see absolutely nothing when they  drove outside.    It wasn't until the man-carrying cylinders had been dumped in a  metal-walled room, that Jason saw his first native Pyrran life.    The lift truck driver was swinging a thick outer door shut when  something flew in through the entrance and struck against the far wall.  Jason's eye was caught by the motion, he looked to see what it was when  it dropped straight down towards his face.    Forgetful of the metal cylinder wall, he flinched away. The creature  struck the transparent metal and clung to it. Jason had the perfect  opportunity to examine it in every detail.    It was almost too horrible to be believable. As though it were a bearer  of death stripped to the very essentials. A mouth that split the head in  two, rows of teeth, serrated and pointed. Leathery, claw-tipped wings,  longer claws on the limbs that tore at the metal wall.    Terror rose up in Jason as he saw that the claws were tearing gouges in  the transparent metal. Wherever the creature's saliva touched the metal  clouded and chipped under the assault of the teeth.    Logic said these were just scratches on the thick tube. They couldn't  matter. But blind, unreasoning fear sent Jason curling away as far as he  could. Shrinking inside himself, seeking escape.    Only when the flying creature began dissolving did he realize the nature  of the room outside. Sprays of steaming liquid came from all sides,  raining down until the cylinders were covered. After one last clash of  its jaws, the Pyrran animal was washed off and carried away. The liquid  drained away through the floor and a second and third shower followed.    While the solutions were being pumped away, Jason fought to bring his  emotions into line. He was surprised at himself. No matter how frightful  the creature had been, he couldn't understand the fear it could generate  through the wall of the sealed tube. His reaction was all out of  proportion to the cause. Even with the creature destroyed and washed out  of sight it took all of his will power to steady his nerves and bring  his breathing back to normal.           *       *       *       *       *    Meta walked by outside and he realized the sterilization process was  finished. He opened his own tube and climbed wearily out. Meta and the  others had gone by this time and only a hawk-faced stranger remained,  waiting for him.    \"I'm Brucco, in charge of the adaptation clinic. Kerk told me who you  were. I'm sorry you're here. Now come along, I want some blood samples.\"    \"Now I feel right at home,\" Jason said. \"The old Pyrran hospitality.\"  Brucco only grunted and stamped out. Jason followed him down a bare  corridor into a sterile lab.    The double gravity was tiring, a constant drag on sore muscles. While  Brucco ran tests on the blood sample, Jason rested. He had almost dozed  off into a painful sleep when Brucco returned with a tray of bottles and  hypodermic needles.    \"Amazing,\" he announced. \"Not an antibody in your serum that would be of  any use on this planet. I have a batch of antigens here that will make  you sick as a beast for at least a day. Take off your shirt.\"    \"Have you done this often?\" Jason asked. \"I mean juice up an outlander  so he can enjoy the pleasures of your world?\"    Brucco jammed in a needle that felt like it grated on the bone. \"Not  often at all. Last time was years ago. A half-dozen researchers from  some institute, willing to pay well for the chance to study the local  life forms. We didn't say no. Always need more galaxy currency.\"    Jason was already beginning to feel light-headed from the shots. \"How  many of them lived?\" he mumbled vaguely.    \"One. We got him off in time. Made them pay in advance of course.\"    At first Jason thought the Pyrran was joking. Then he remembered they  had very little interest in humor of any kind. If one-half of what Meta  and Kerk had told him was true, six to one odds weren't bad at all.    There was a bed in the next room and Brucco helped him to it. Jason felt  drugged and probably was. He fell into a deep sleep and into the dream.    Fear and hatred mixed in equal parts and washed over him red hot. If  this was a dream, he never wanted to sleep"]]]
