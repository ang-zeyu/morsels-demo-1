Wherefore we call it contingent or possible.    Note II.--It clearly follows from what we have said, that  things have been brought into being by God in the highest  perfection, inasmuch as they have necessarily followed from a  most perfect nature.  Nor does this prove any imperfection in  God, for it has compelled us to affirm his perfection.  From its  contrary proposition, we should clearly gather (as I have just  shown), that God is not supremely perfect, for if things had been  brought into being in any other way, we should have to assign to  God a nature different from that, which we are bound to attribute  to him from the consideration of an absolutely perfect being.    I do not doubt, that many will scout this idea as absurd, and  will refuse to give their minds up to contemplating it, simply  because they are accustomed to assign to God a freedom very  different from that which we (Def. vii.) have deduced.  They  assign to him, in short, absolute free will.  However, I am also  convinced that if such persons reflect on the matter, and duly  weigh in their minds our series of propositions, they will reject  such freedom as they now attribute to God, not only as nugatory,  but also as a great impediment to organized knowledge.  There is  no need for me to repeat what I have said in the note to Prop.  xvii.  But, for the sake of my opponents, I will show further,  that although it be granted that will pertains to the essence of  God, it nevertheless follows from his perfection, that things  could not have been by him created other than they are, or in a  different order; this is easily proved, if we reflect on what  our opponents themselves concede, namely, that it depends solely  on the decree and will of God, that each thing is what it is.  If  it were otherwise, God would not be the cause of all things.  Further, that all the decrees of God have been ratified from all  eternity by God himself.  If it were otherwise, God would be  convicted of imperfection or change.  But in eternity there is no  such thing as when, before, or after; hence it follows solely  from the perfection of God, that God never can decree, or never  could have decreed anything but what is; that God did not exist  before his decrees, and would not exist without them.  But, it is  said, supposing that God had made a different universe, or had  ordained other decrees from all eternity concerning nature and  her order, we could not therefore conclude any imperfection in  God.  But persons who say this must admit that God can change his  decrees.  For if God had ordained any decrees concerning nature  and her order, different from those which he has ordained--in  other words, if he had willed and conceived something different  concerning nature--he would perforce have had a different  intellect from that which he has, and also a different will.  But  if it were allowable to assign to God a different intellect and a  different will, without any change in his essence or his  perfection, what would there be to prevent him changing the  decrees which he has made concerning created things, and  nevertheless remaining perfect?  For his intellect and will  concerning things created and their order are the same, in  respect to his essence and perfection, however they be conceived.    Further, all the philosophers whom I have read admit that  God's intellect is entirely actual, and not at all potential; as  they also admit that God's intellect, and God's will, and God's  essence are identical, it follows that, if God had had a  different actual intellect and a different will, his essence  would also have been different; and thus, as I concluded at  first, if things had been brought into being by God in a  different way from that which has obtained, God's intellect and  will, that is (as is admitted) his essence would perforce have  been different, which is absurd.    As these things could not have been brought into being by God  in any but the actual way and order which has obtained; and as  the truth of this proposition follows from the supreme perfection  of God; we can have no sound reason for persuading ourselves to  believe that God did not wish to create all the things which were  in his intellect, and to create them in the same perfection as he  had understood them.    But, it will be said, there is in things no perfection nor  imperfection; that which is in them, and which causes them to be  called perfect or imperfect, good or bad, depends solely on the  will of God.  If God had so willed, he might have brought it  about that what is now perfection should be extreme imperfection,  and vice versa.  What is such an assertion, but an open  declaration that God, who necessarily understands that which he  wishes, might bring it about by his will, that he should  understand things differently from the way in which he does  understand them?  This (as we have just shown) is the height of  absurdity.  Wherefore, I may turn the argument against its  employers, as follows:--All things depend on the power of God.  In order that things should be different from what they are,  God's will would necessarily have to be different.  But God's  will cannot be different (as we have just most clearly  demonstrated) from God's perfection.  Therefore neither can  things be different.  I confess, that the theory which subjects  all things to the will of an indifferent deity, and asserts that  they are all dependent on his fiat, is less far from the truth  than the theory of those, who maintain that God acts in all  things with a view of promoting what is good.  For these latter  persons seem to set up something beyond God, which does not  depend on God, but which God in acting looks to as an exemplar,  or which he aims at as a definite goal.  This is only another  name for subjecting God to the dominion of destiny, an utter  absurdity in respect to God, whom we have shown to be the first  and only free cause of the essence of all things and also of  their existence.  I need, therefore, spend no time in refuting  such wild theories.    PROP. XXXIV.  God's power is identical with his essence.    Proof.--From the sole necessity of the essence of God it  follows that God is the cause of himself (Prop. xi.) and of all  things (Prop. xvi. and Coroll.).  Wherefore the power of God, by  which he and all things are and act, is identical with his  essence.  Q.E.D.    PROP. XXXV.  Whatsoever we conceive to be in the power of God,  necessarily exists.    Proof.--Whatsoever is in God's power, must (by the last Prop.)  be comprehended in his essence in such a manner, that it  necessarily follows therefrom, and therefore necessarily exists.  Q.E.D.    PROP. XXXVI.  There is no cause from whose nature some effect  does not follow.    Proof.--Whatsoever exists expresses God's nature or essence in  a given conditioned manner (by Prop. xxv., Coroll.); that is,  (by Prop. xxxiv.), whatsoever exists, expresses in a given  conditioned manner God's power, which is the cause of all things,  therefore an effect must (by Prop. xvi.) necessarily follow.  Q.E.D.      APPENDIX:    In the foregoing I have explained the nature and properties  of God.  I have shown that he necessarily exists, that he is one:  that he is, and acts solely by the necessity of his own nature;  that he is the free cause of all things, and how he is so;  that all things are in God, and so depend on him, that without  him they could neither exist nor be conceived; lastly, that all  things are predetermined by God, not through his free will or  absolute fiat, but from the very nature of God or infinite power.  I have further, where occasion afforded, taken care to remove the  prejudices, which might impede the comprehension of my  demonstrations.  Yet there still remain misconceptions not a few,  which might and may prove very grave hindrances to the  understanding of the concatenation of things, as I have explained  it above.  I have therefore thought it worth while to bring these  misconceptions before the bar of reason.    All such opinions spring from the notion commonly  entertained, that all things in nature act as men themselves act,  namely, with an end in view.  It is accepted as certain, that God  himself directs all things to a definite goal (for it is said  that God made all things for man, and man that he might worship  him).  I will, therefore, consider this opinion, asking first,  why it obtains general credence, and why all men are naturally so  prone to adopt it? secondly, I will point out its falsity; and,  lastly, I will show how it has given rise to prejudices about  good and bad, right and wrong, praise and blame, order and  confusion, beauty and ugliness, and the like.  However, this is  not the place to deduce these misconceptions from the nature of  the human mind: it will be sufficient here, if I assume as a  starting point, what ought to be universally admitted, namely,  that all men are born ignorant of the causes of things, that all  have the desire to seek for what is useful to them, and that they  are conscious of such desire.  Herefrom it follows, first, that  men think themselves free inasmuch as they are conscious of their  volitions and desires, and never even dream, in their ignorance,  of the causes which have disposed them so to wish and desire.  Secondly, that men do all things for an end, namely, for that  which is useful to them, and which they seek.  Thus it comes to  pass that they only look for a knowledge of the final causes of  events, and when these are learned, they are content, as having  no cause for further doubt.  If they cannot learn such causes  from external sources, they are compelled to turn to considering  themselves,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38003"],[0,"Color Key to North American Birds (#7)"],[1," feathers edged with brown. _Winter._ Wholly different;  above gray; head dark; below white; a nearly complete white nuchal  collar. _Yng._ Similar to winter ad. but blacker above; sprinkled with  blackish below.

SKUAS and JAEGERS. StercorariidA|. 4 species.       Family 2. GULLS and TERNS. LaridA|. 37 species, 1 subspecies.       Family 3. SKIMMERS. RynchopidA|. 1 species.      Skuas and Jaegers are pirates among the birds of the high seas. Bold  and dashing, they pursue the swift flying Terns or much larger Gulls  with equal success, forcing them to drop the fish they have captured  and catching it ere it reaches the water.    Gulls (Subfamily _LarinA|_) are usually considered so characteristic of  the sea that 'Sea Gull' is the name popularly applied to all members  of the subfamily to which they belong. Several species, however, are  equally at home, both in the winter and when nesting, on the larger  bodies of water in the interior, and one species is rarely or never  found on our sea coasts.    Gulls nest on the ground, on drifts of marsh-grass, on cliffs, and one  species, at least, among American Gulls (the Herring Gull) has as a  result of persecution, acquired the habit of nesting in trees.    Gulls feed from the surface of the water, picking up their food with  their strongly curved bills in passing or while hovering, not by  plunging into the water, as do the Terns. They are, in fact, the  scavengers of the water, and perform a service of great value to  mankind by devouring the bodies of various forms of aquatic animals  which, in dying, come to the surface and, if cast ashore, might, in  decaying, prove a source of disease.    For this reason it was especially unfortunate that the plumage of  these birds became fashionable for millinery purposes, with the result  that thousands of them were destroyed for their wings and breasts. In  this country, however, through the efforts of the American  Ornithologists' Union and the Audubon Societies, laws have been passed  prohibiting the killing of these beautiful and useful birds, and  wardens have been placed on their nesting grounds to protect them.    Gulls often rest in great flocks on the water, sitting high up and  riding the waves buoyantly, but the Terns (Subfamily _SterninA|_),  after they have acquired the power of flight, are rarely seen on the  water. They are lighter, more active birds than the Gulls, with longer  wings and tails, and sharper, more pointed bills. They feed largely on  small fish (the species called silversides being a favorite) of no  value to man, which they secure by darting from the air with great  speed and directness. When looking for food, Terns usually fly with  the bill downward, a habit which will aid in distinguishing them from  the Gulls, whose bill is carried in a line with the body.    Terns usually "]]]
