[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3819"],[0,"The Euahlayi Tribe: A Study of Aboriginal Life in Australia (#7)"],[1,"names, we have seen, are Gwaigulleeah, Light blooded, and  Gwaimudthen, Dark blooded.    The origin of this division is said to be the fact that the original  ancestors were, on the one side, a red race coming from the west, the  Gwaigulleeah; on the other, a dark race coming from the east.    A Gwaigulleeah may under no circumstances marry a Gwaigulleeah; he or  she must mate with a Gwaimudthen. This rule has no exception. A child  belongs to the same phratry as its mother.    The next name of connection is local, based on belonging to one country  or hunting-ground; this name a child takes from its mother wherever it  may happen to be born. Any one who is called a Noongahburrah belongs to  the Noongah-Kurrajong country; Ghurreeburrah to the orchid country;  Mirriehburrah, poligonum country; Bibbilah, Bibbil country, and so on.  This division, not of blood relationship, carries no independent  marriage restriction, but keeps up a feeling equivalent to Scotch,  Irish, or English, and is counted by the blacks as 'relationship,' but  not sufficiently so to bar marriage.    The next division is the name in common for all daughters, or all sons  of one family of sisters. The daughters take the name from their  maternal grandmother, the sons from their maternal great-uncle.    Of these divisions, called I Matrimonial Classes, there are four for  each sex, bearing the same names as among the Kamilaroi. The names  are--      Masculine Kumbo     BROTHER AND SISTER    Feminine, Bootha      Masculine Murree    BROTHER AND SISTER    Feminine, Matha      Masculine Hippi     BROTHER AND SISTER    Feminine, Hippitha      Masculine Kubbee    BROTHER AND SISTER    Feminine, Kubbootha      The children of Bootha will be      Masculine Hippi     BROTHER AND SISTER    Feminine, Hippitha      The children of Matha will be      Masculine Kubbee    BROTHER AND SISTER    Feminine, Kubbootha      The children of Hippatha will be      Masculine Kumbo     BROTHER AND SISTER    Feminine, Bootha      The children of Kubbootha will be      Masculine Murree    BROTHER AND SISTER    Feminine, Matha      Thus, you see, they take, if girls, their grandmother's and her  sisters' 'class' names in common; if boys, the 'class' name of their  grandmother's brothers.    Bootha    can only marry Murree,    Matha     can only marry Kumbo,    Hippitha  can only marry Kubbee,    Kubbootha can only marry Hippi.      Both men and women are often addressed by these names when spoken to.    A PROPOS of names, a child is never called at night by the same name as  in the daytime, lest the 'devils' hear it and entice him away.    Names are made for the newly born according to circumstances; a girl  born under a Dheal tree, for example, was called Dheala. Any incident  happening at the time of birth may gain a child a name, such as a  particular lizard passing. Two of my black maids were called after  lizards in that way: Barahgurree and Bogginbinnia.    Nimmaylee is a porcupine with the spines coming; such an one having  been brought to the camp just as a girl was born, she became Nimmaylee.    The mothers, with native politeness, ask you to give their children  English names, but much mote often use in familiar conversation either  the Kumbo Bootha names, or others derived from place of birth, from  some circumstance connected with it, a child's mispronunciation of a  word, some peculiarity noticed in the child, or still more often they  call each other by the name proclaiming the degree of relationship.    For example, a girl calls the daughters of her mother and of her aunts  alike sisters.      Boahdee       SISTER    Wambaneah     FULL BROTHER    Dayadee       HALF BROTHER    Gurrooghee    UNCLE    Wulgundee     UNCLE'S WIFE    Kummean       SISTER'S SISTER    Numbardee     MOTHER    Numbardee     MOTHER'S SISTER    Beealahdee    FATHER    Beealahdee    MOTHER'S SISTERS' HUSBANDS    Gnahgnahdee   GRANDMOTHER ON FATHER'S SIDE    Bargie        GRANDMOTHER ON MOTHER'S SIDE    Dadadee       GRANDFATHER ON MOTHER'S SIAE    Gurroomi      A SON-IN-LAW, OR ONE WHO COULD BE A SON-IN-LAW    Goonooahdee   A DAUGHTER-IN-LAW, OR ONE WHO COULD BE A DAUGHTER-IN-LAW    Gooleerh      HUSBAND OR WIFE, OR ONE WHO MIGHT BE SO.      So relationships are always kept in their memories by being daily used  as names. There are other general names, too, such as--      Mullayerh     A TEMPORARY MATE OR COMPANION    Moothie       A FRIEND OF CHILDHOOD IN AFTER LIFE    Doore-oothai  A LOVER    Dillahga      AN ELDERLY MAN OF THE SAME TOTEM    Tuckandee     A YOUNG MAN OF THE SAME TOTEM, RECKONED AS A SORT OF                    BROTHER.      Another list of names used ordinarily is--      Boothan       LAST POSSIBLE CHILD OF A WOMAN    Mahmee        OLD WOMAN    Beewun        MOTHERLESS GIRL    Gowun         FATHERLESS GIRL    Yumbui        FATHERLESS BOY    Moogul        ONLY CHILD.      Those of the same totem are reckoned as brothers and sisters, so cannot  intermarry. 'Boyjerh' relations, as those on the father's side are  called, are not so important as on the mother's side, but are still  recognised.    Now for the great Dhe, or totem system, by some called Mah, but Dhe, is  the more correct.    Dinewan, or emu, is a totem, and has amongst its multiplex totems' or  'sub-totems'--      Goodoo        OR CODFISH    Gumbarl       SILVER BREAM    Inga          CRAYFISH    Boomool       SHRIMPS    Gowargay      WATER EMU SPIRIT    Moograbah     BIG BLACK-AND-WHITE MAGPIE    Booloorl      LITTLE NIGHT OWL    Byahmul       BLACK SWAN    Eerin         A LITTLE NIGHT OWL    Beerwon       A BIRD LIKE A SWALLOW    Dulloorah     THE MANNA-BRINGING BIRDS    Bunnyal       FLIES    Dheal         SACRED FIRE    Gidya         AN ACACIA    Yaraan        AN EUCALYPTUS    Deenyi        IRONBARK    Guatha        QUANDONG    Goodooroo     RIVER BOX    Mirieh        POLIGONUM    Yarragerh     THE NORTH-EAST WIND    Guie          TREE--OWENIA ACIDULA    Niune         WILD MELON    Binnamayah    BIG SALTBUSH.      Bohrah, the kangaroo, is another totem, and is considered somewhat akin  to Dinewan. For example, in a quarrel between, say, the Bohrah totem  and the Beewee, the Dinewan would take the part of the former rather  than the latter.    Amongst the multiplex totems of Bohrah are--      Goolahwilleel    TOPKNOT PIGEONS    Boogoodoogadah   THE RAIN-BIRD    Gilah            FINK-BREASTED PARROT    Quarrian         YELLOW AND RED BREASTED GREY PARROT    Buln Buln        GREEN PARROT    Gidgerregah      SMALL GREEN PARROT    Cocklerina       A ROSE AND YELLOW CRESTED WHILE COCKATOO    Youayah          FROGS    Guiggahboorool   BIGGEST ANT-BEDS    Dunnia           WATTLE TREE    Mulga            AN ACACIA    Gnoel            SANDALWOOD    Brigalow         AN ACACIA    Yarragerh        NORTH-EAST WIND, SAME AS DINEWAN'S.      All clouds, lightning, thunder, and rain that is not blown up by the  wind of another totem, belong to Bohrah.    Beewee, brown and yellow Iguana, numerically a very powerful totem, has  for multiplex totems--      Gai-gai           CATFISH    Curreequinquin    BUTCHER-BIRD    Gougourgahgah     LAUGHING-JACKASS    Deenbi            DIVERS    Birroo Birroo     SAND BUILDERS    Deegeenboyah      SOLDIER-BIRD    Weedah            BOWER-BIRD    Mooregoo Mooregoo BLACK IBIS    Booloon           WHITE CRANE    Noodulnoodul      WHISTLING DUCKS    Goborrai          STARS    Gulghureer        PINK LIZARD    Goori             PINE    Talingerh         NATIVE FUCHSIA    Guiebet           NATIVE PASSION FRUIT    Boonburr          POISON TREE    Gungooday         STOCKMAN'S WOOD    Guddeeboondoo     BITTER BARK    Boorgoolbean or    Mooloowerh        A SHRUB WITH CREAMY BLOSSOMS    Yarragerh         SPRING WIND    Muddernwurderh    WEST WIND.      Those with whom the Beewee shares the winds he counts as relations. It  is the Beewees of the Gwaimudthen, or dark blood, who own Yarragerh  (spring wind); the light-blooded own Mudderwurderh (west wind).    Another totem is Gouyou, or Bandicoot. The animal has disappeared from  the Narran district, but the totem tribe is still strong, though not so  numerous as either the Beewees or Dinewans.

Next we take Doolungaiyah, or Bilber, commonly known as Bilby, a large  species of rat the size of a small rabbit, like which it burrows;  almost died out now. The totem clan are very few here too, so it is  difficult to learn much as to their multiplex totems, amongst which,  however, are--      Ooboon           BLUE-TONGUED LIZARD    Goomblegubbon    PLAINS TURKEY OR BUSTARD    Boothagullagulla BIRD LIKE SEAGULL    Tekel Barain     LARGE WHITE AMARYLLIS.

Where they may all lie,  I know not.  Far-scattered bones, indeed!  But if the reader cares to  learn how some of them--or some part of some of them--found their way at  length to such honourable sepulture, let him listen to the words of one  who was their comrade in life and their apologist when they were dead.  Some of the insane controversial matter I omit, as well as some  digressions, but leave the rest in Patrick Walker's language and  orthography:--        'The never to be forgotten Mr. _James Renwick_ told me, that he was      Witness to their Public Murder at the _Gallowlee_, between _Leith_      and _Edinburgh_, when he saw the Hangman hash and hagg off all their      Five Heads, with _Patrick Foreman's_ Right Hand: Their Bodies were      all buried at the Gallows Foot; their Heads, with _Patrick's_ Hand,      were brought and put upon five Pikes on the _Pleasaunce-Port_. . . .      Mr. _Renwick_ told me also that it was the first public Action that      his Hand was at, to conveen Friends, and lift their murthered Bodies,      and carried them to the West Churchyard of _Edinburgh_,'--not      Greyfriars, this time,--'and buried them there.  Then they came about      the City . . . . and took down these Five Heads and that Hand; and      Day being come, they went quickly up the _Pleasaunce_; and when they      came to _Lauristoun_ Yards, upon the South-side of the City, they      durst not venture, being so light, to go and bury their Heads with      their Bodies, which they designed; it being present Death, if any of      them had been found.  _Alexander Tweedie_, a Friend, being with them,      who at that Time was Gardner in these Yards, concluded to bury them      in his Yard, being in a Box (wrapped in Linen), where they lay 45      Years except 3 Days, being executed upon the 10th of _October_ 1681,      and found the 7th Day of October 1726.  That Piece of Ground lay for      some Years unlaboured; and trenching it, the Gardner found them,      which affrighted him the Box was consumed.  Mr. _Schaw_, the Owner of      these Yards, caused lift them, and lay them upon a Table in his      Summer-house: Mr. _Schaw's_ mother was so kind, as to cut out a      Linen-cloth, and cover them.  They lay Twelve Days there, where all      had Access to see them.  _Alexander Tweedie_, the foresaid Gardner,      said, when dying, There was a Treasure hid in his Yard, but neither      Gold nor Silver.  _Daniel Tweedie_, his Son, came along with me to      that Yard, and told me that his Father planted a white Rose-bush      above them, and farther down the Yard a red Rose-bush, which were      more fruitful than any other Bush in the Yard. . . . Many came'--to      see the heads--'out of Curiosity; yet I rejoiced to see so many      concerned grave Men and Women favouring the Dust of our Martyrs.      There were Six of us concluded to bury them upon the Nineteenth Day      of _October_ 1726, and every One of us to acquaint Friends of the Day      and Hour, being _Wednesday_, the Day of the Week on which most of      them were executed, and at 4 of the Clock at Night, being the Hour      that most of them went to their resting Graves.  We caused make a      compleat Coffin for them in Black, with four Yards of fine Linen, the      way that our Martyrs Corps were managed. . . . Accordingly we kept      the aforesaid Day and Hour, and doubled the Linen, and laid the Half      of it below them, their nether jaws being parted from their Heads;      but being young Men, their Teeth remained.  All were Witness to the      Holes in each of their Heads, which the Hangman broke with his      Hammer; and according to the Bigness of their Sculls, we laid the      Jaws to them, and drew the other Half of the Linen above them, and      stufft the Coffin with Shavings.  Some prest hard to go thorow the      chief Parts of the City as was done at the Revolution; but this we      refused, considering that it looked airy and frothy, to make such      Show of them, and inconsistent with the solid serious Observing of      such an affecting, surprizing unheard-of Dispensation: But took the      ordinary Way of other Burials from that Place, to wit, we went east      the Back of the Wall, and in at _Bristo-Port_, and down the Way to      the Head of the _Cowgate_, and turned up to the Church-yard, where      they were interred closs to the Martyrs Tomb, with the greatest      Multitude of People Old and Young, Men and Women, Ministers and      others, that ever I saw together.'    And so there they were at last, in 'their resting graves.'  So long as  men do their duty, even if it be greatly in a misapprehension, they will  be leading pattern lives; and whether or not they come to lie beside a  martyrs' monument, we may be sure they will find a safe haven somewhere  in the providence of God.  It is not well to think of death, unless we  temper the thought with that of heroes who despised it.  Upon what  ground, is of small account; if it be only the bishop who was burned for  his faith in the antipodes, his memory lightens the heart and makes us  walk undisturbed among graves.  And so the martyrs' monument is a  wholesome, heartsome spot in the field of the dead; and as we look upon  it, a brave influence comes to us from the land of those who have won  their discharge and, in another phrase of Patrick Walker's, got 'cleanly  off the stage.'          CHAPTER VI. NEW TOWN--TOWN AND COUNTRY.      It is as much a matter of course to decry the New Town as to exalt the  Old; and the most celebrated authorities have picked out this quarter as  the very emblem of what is condemnable in architecture.  Much may be  said, much indeed has been said, upon the text; but to the  unsophisticated, who call anything pleasing if it only pleases them, the  New Town of Edinburgh seems, in itself, not only gay and airy, but highly  picturesque.  An old skipper, invincibly ignorant of all theories of the  sublime and beautiful, once propounded as his most radiant notion for  Paradise: 'The new town of Edinburgh, with the wind a matter of a point  free.'  He has now gone to that sphere where all good tars are promised  pleasant weather in the song, and perhaps his thoughts fly somewhat  higher.  But there are bright and temperate days--with soft air coming  from the inland hills, military music sounding bravely from the hollow of  the gardens, the flags all waving on the palaces of Princes Street--when  I have seen the town through a sort of glory, and shaken hands in  sentiment with the old sailor.  And indeed, for a man who has been much  tumbled round Orcadian skerries, what scene could be more agreeable to  witness?  On such a day, the valley wears a surprising air of festival.  It seems (I do not know how else to put my meaning) as if it were a  trifle too good to be true.  It is what Paris ought to be.  It has the  scenic quality that would best set off a life of unthinking, open-air  diversion.  It was meant by nature for the realisation of the society of  comic operas.  And you can imagine, if the climate were but towardly, how  all the world and his wife would flock into these gardens in the cool of  the evening, to hear cheerful music, to sip pleasant drinks, to see the  moon rise from behind Arthur's Seat and shine upon the spires and  monuments and the green tree-tops in the valley.  Alas! and the next  morning the rain is splashing on the windows, and the passengers flee  along Princes Street before the galloping squalls.                         [Picture: The Royal Institution]    It cannot be denied that the original design was faulty and  short-sighted, and did not fully profit by the capabilities of the  situation.  The architect was essentially a town bird, and he laid out  the modern city with a view to street scenery, and to street scenery  alone.  The country did not enter into his plan; he had never lifted his  eyes to the hills.  If he had so chosen, every street upon the northern  slope might have been a noble terrace and commanded an extensive and  beautiful view.  But the space has been too closely built; many of the  houses front the wrong way, intent, like the Man with the Muck-Rake, on  what is not worth observation, and standing discourteously back-foremost  in the ranks; and, in a word, it is too often only from attic-windows, or  here and there at a crossing, that you can get a look beyond the city  upon its diversified surroundings.  But perhaps it is all the more  surprising, to come suddenly on a corner, and see a perspective of a mile  or more of falling street, and beyond that woods and villas, and a blue  arm of sea, and the hills upon the farther side.    Fergusson, our Edinburgh poet, Burns's model, once saw a butterfly at the  Town Cross; and the sight inspired him with a worthless little ode.  This  painted country man, the dandy of the rose garden, looked far abroad in  such a humming neighbourhood; and you can fancy what moral considerations  a youthful poet would supply.  But the incident, in a fanciful sort of  way, is characteristic of the place.  Into no other city does the sight  of the country enter so far; if you do not meet a butterfly, you shall  certainly catch a glimpse of far-away trees upon your walk; and the place  is full of theatre tricks in the way of scenery.  You peep under an arch,  you descend stairs that look as if they would land you in a cellar, you  turn to the back-window of a grimy tenement in a lane:--and behold! you  are face-to-face with distant and bright prospects.  You turn a corner,  and there is the sun going down into the Highland hills.  You look down  an alley, and see ships tacking for the Baltic.    For the country people to see Edinburgh on her hill-tops, is one thing;  it is another for the citizen, from the thick of his affairs, to overlook  the country.  It should be a genial and ameliorating influence in life;  it should prompt good thoughts and"]]]
