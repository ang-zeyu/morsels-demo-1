[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37206"],[0,"Sea and Sardinia (#7)"],[1," The paint wore  away long ago: and this timber will never see paint any more. Strange to  put one's hand on the old oaken wood, so sea-fibred. Good old  delicate-threaded oak: I swear it grew in England. And everything so  carefully done, so solidly and everlastingly. I look at the lions, with  the perfect-fitting oaken pins through their paws clinching them down,  and their little mouths open. They are as solid as they were in  Victorian days, as immovable. They will never wear away. What a joy in  the careful, thorough, manly, everlasting work put into a ship: at least  into this sixty-year-old vessel. Every bit of this old oak wood so  sound, so beautiful: and the whole welded together with joints and  wooden pins far more beautifully and livingly than iron welds. Rustless,  life-born, living-tissued old wood: rustless as flesh is rustless, and  happy-seeming as iron never can be. She rides so well, she takes the  sea so beautifully, as a matter of course.           *       *       *       *       *    Various members of the crew wander past to look at us. This little  promenade deck is over the first-class quarters, full in the stern. So  we see first one head then another come up the ladder--mostly bare  heads: and one figure after another slouches past, smoking a cigarette.  All crew. At last the q-b stops one of them--it is what they are all  waiting for, an opportunity to talk--and asks if the weird object on the  top of Pellegrino is a ruin. Could there be a more touristy question!  No, it is the semaphore station. Slap in the eye for the q-b! She  doesn't mind, however, and the member of the crew proceeds to converse.  He is a weedy, hollow-cheeked town-product: a Palermitan. He wears faded  blue over-alls and informs us he is the ship's carpenter: happily  unemployed for the rest of his life, apparently, and taking it as rather  less than his dues. The ship once did the Naples-Palermo course--a very  important course--in the old days of the General Navigation Company. The  General Navigation Company sold her for eighty thousand liras years ago,  and now she was worth two million. We pretend to believe: but I make a  poor show. I am thoroughly sick to death of the sound of liras. No man  can overhear ten words of Italian today without two thousand or two  million or ten or twenty or two liras flying like venomous mosquitoes  round his ears. Liras--liras--liras--nothing else. Romantic, poetic,  cypress-and-orange-tree Italy is gone. Remains an Italy smothered in the  filthy smother of innumerable Lira notes: ragged, unsavoury paper money  so thick upon the air that one breathes it like some greasy fog. Behind  this greasy fog some people may still see the Italian sun. I find it  hard work. Through this murk of Liras you peer at Michael Angelo and at  Botticelli and the rest, and see them all as through a glass, darkly.  For heavy around you is Italy's after-the-war atmosphere, darkly  pressing you, squeezing you, milling you into dirty paper notes. King  Harry was lucky that they only wanted to coin him into gold. Italy wants  to mill you into filthy paper Liras.           *       *       *       *       *    Another head--and a black alpaca jacket and a serviette this time--to  tell us coffee is ready. Not before it is time, too. We go down into the  subterranean state-room and sit on the screw-pin chairs, while the ship  does the slide-and-slope trot under us, and we drink a couple of cups of  coffee-and-milk, and eat a piece of bread and butter. At least one of  the innumerable members of the crew gives me one cup, then casts me  off. It is most obviously his intention that I shall get no more:  because of course the innumerable members of the crew could all just do  with another coffee and milk. However, though the ship heaves and the  alpaca coats cluster menacingly in the doorway, I balance my way to the  tin buffet and seize the coffee pot and the milk pot, and am quite  successful in administering to the q-b and myself. Having restored the  said vessels to their tin altar, I resume my spin chair at the long and  desert board. The q-b and I are alone--save that in the distance a very  fat back with gold-braid collar sits sideways and a fat hand disposes of  various papers--he is part of the one-and-only table, of course. The  tall lean alpaca jacket, with a face of yellow stone and a big black  moustache moves from the outer doorway, glowers at our filled cups, and  goes to the tin altar and touches the handles of the two vessels: just  touches them to an arrangement: as one who should say: These are mine.  What dirty foreigner dares help himself!           *       *       *       *       *    As quickly as possible we stagger up from the long dungeon where the  alpaca jackets are swooping like blue-bottles upon the coffee pots, into  the air. There the carpenter is waiting for us, like a spider.    \"Isn't the sea a little quieter?\" says the q-b wistfully. She is growing  paler.    \"No, Signora--how should it be?\" says the gaunt-faced carpenter. \"The  wind is waiting for us behind Cape Gallo. You see that cape?\" he points  to a tall black cliff-front in the sea ahead. \"When we get to that cape  we get the wind and the sea. Here--\" he makes a gesture--\"it is  moderate.\"    \"Ugh!\" says the q-b, turning paler. \"I'm going to lie down.\"    She disappears. The carpenter, finding me stony ground, goes forward,  and I see him melting into the crowd of the innumerable crew, that  hovers on the lower-deck passage by the kitchen and the engines.           *       *       *       *       *    The clouds are flying fast overhead: and sharp and isolated come drops  of rain, so that one thinks it must be spray. But no, it is a handful of  rain. The ship swishes and sinks forward, gives a hollow thudding and  rears slowly backward, along this pinkish lofty coast of Sicily that is  just retreating into a bay. From the open sea comes the rain, come the  long waves.           *       *       *       *       *    No shelter. One must go down. The q-b lies quietly in her bunk. The  state-room is stale like a passage on the underground railway. No  shelter, save near the kitchen and the engines, where there is a bit of  warmth. The cook is busy cleaning fish, making the whiting bite their  tails venomously at a little board just outside his kitchen-hole. A slow  stream of kitchen-filth swilkers back and forth along the ship's side. A  gang of the crew leans near me--a larger gang further down. Heaven knows  what they can all be--but they never do anything but stand in gangs and  talk and eat and smoke cigarettes. They are mostly young--mostly  Palermitan--with a couple of unmistakable Neapolitans, having the  peculiar Neapolitan hang-dog good looks, the chiselled cheek, the little  black moustache, the large eyes. But they chew with their cheeks bulged  out, and laugh with their fine, semi-sarcastic noses. The whole gang  looks continually sideways. Nobody ever commands them--there seems to be  absolutely no control. Only the fat engineer in grey linen looks as  clean and as competent as his own machinery. Queer how machine-control  puts the pride and self-respect into a man.           *       *       *       *       *    The rain over, I go and squat against the canvas that is spread over the  arched sky-lights on the small promenade deck, sitting on the seat that  is fixed to the sky-light sides. The wind is cold: there are snatches of  sun and spits of rain. The big cape has come and is being left behind:  we are heading for a far-off cape like a cloud in the grey air. A  dimness comes over one's mind: a sort of stupefaction owing to the wind  and the relentless slither-and-rearing of the ship. Not a sickness, but  a sort of dim faintness. So much motion, such moving, powerful air. And  withal a constant triumph in the long, slow sea-gallop of the ship.           *       *       *       *       *    A great loud bell: midday and the crew going to eat, rushing to eat.  After some time we are summoned. \"The Signora isn't eating?\" asks the  waiter eagerly: hoping she is not. \"Yes, she is eating,\" say I. I fetch  the q-b from her berth. Rather wanly she comes and gets into her spin  chair. Bash comes a huge plate of thick, oily cabbage soup, very full,  swilkering over the sides. We do what we can with it. So does the third  passenger: a young woman who never wears a hat, thereby admitting  herself simply as one of \"the people,\" but who has an expensive  complicated dress, nigger-coloured thin silk stockings, and suede  high-heeled shoes. She is handsome, sturdy, with large dark eyes and a  robust, frank manner: far too robustly downright for Italy. She is from  Cagliari--and can't do much with the cabbage soup: and tells the waiter  so, in her deep, hail-fellow-well-met voice. In the doorway hovers a  little cloud of alpaca jackets grinning faintly with malignant  anticipation of food, hoping, like blow-flies, we shall be too ill to  eat. Away goes the soup and appears a massive yellow omelette, like some  log of bilious wood. It is hard, and heavy, and cooked in the usual  rank-tasting olive oil. The young woman doesn't have much truck with it:  neither do we. To the triumph of the blow-flies, who see the yellow  monster borne to their altar. After which a long long slab of the  inevitable meat cut into innumerable slices, tasting of dead nothingness  and having a thick sauce of brown neutrality: sufficient for twelve  people at least. This, with masses of strong-tasting greenish  cauliflower liberally weighted with oil, on a ship that was already  heaving its heart out, made up the dinner. Accumulating malevolent  triumph among the blow-flies in the passage. So on to a dessert of  oranges, pears with wooden hearts and thick yellowish wash-leather  flesh, and apples. Then coffee.    And we had sat through it, which is something. The alpaca blue-bottles  buzzed over the masses of food that went back on the dishes "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3721"],[0,"France and England in North America, Part I: Pioneers of France in the New World (#7)"],[1,"ing; the wild  lamentation of the women as they gashed the arms of the young girls  with sharp mussel-shells, and flung the blood into the air with dismal  outcries. A scene of ravenous feasting followed, in which the French,  released from durance, were summoned to share.    After the carousal they returned to Charlesfort, where they were soon  pinched with hunger. The Indians, never niggardly of food, brought them  supplies as long as their own lasted; but the harvest was not yet ripe,  and their means did not match their good-will. They told the French of  two other kings, Ouade and Couexis, who dwelt towards the south, and  were rich beyond belief in maize, beans, and squashes. The mendicant  colonists embarked without delay, and, with an Indian guide, steered  for the wigwams of these potentates, not by the open sea, but by a  perplexing inland navigation, including, as it seems, Calibogue Sound  and neighboring waters. Reaching the friendly villages, on or near the  Savannah, they were feasted to repletion, and their boat was laden with  vegetables and corn. They returned rejoicing; but their joy was short.  Their store-house at Charlesfort, taking fire in the night, burned to  the ground, and with it their newly acquired stock.    Once more they set out for the realms of King Ouade, and once more  returned laden with supplies. Nay, the generous savage assured them  that, so long as his cornfields yielded their harvests, his friends  should not want.    How long this friendship would have lasted may well be doubted. With the  perception that the dependants on their bounty were no demigods, but a  crew of idle and helpless beggars, respect would soon have changed to  contempt, and contempt to ill-will. But it was not to Indian war-clubs  that the infant colony was to owe its ruin. It carried within itself  its own destruction. The ill-assorted band of lands-men and sailors,  surrounded by that influence of the wilderness which wakens the dormant  savage in the breasts of men, soon fell into quarrels. Albert, a  rude soldier, with a thousand leagues of ocean betwixt him and  responsibility, grew harsh, domineering, and violent beyond endurance.  None could question or oppose him without peril of death. He hanged  with his own hands a drummer who had fallen under his displeasure, and  banished a soldier, named La Chore, to a solitary island, three leagues  from the fort, where he left him to starve. For a time his comrades  chafed in smothered fury. The crisis came at length. A few of the  fiercer spirits leagued together, assailed their tyrant, murdered him,  delivered the famished soldier, and called to the command one Nicolas  Barre, a man of merit. Barre took the command, and thenceforth there was  peace.    Peace, such as it was, with famine, homesickness, and disgust. The rough  ramparts and rude buildings of Charlesfort, hatefully familiar to their  weary eyes, the sweltering forest, the glassy river, the eternal silence  of the lifeless wilds around them, oppressed the senses and the spirits.  They dreamed of ease, of home, of pleasures across the sea, of the  evening cup on the bench before the cabaret, and dances with kind  wenches of Dieppe. But how to escape? A continent was their solitary  prison, and the pitiless Atlantic shut them in. Not one of them knew how  to build a ship; but Ribaut had left them a forge, with tools and iron,  and strong desire supplied the place of skill. Trees were hewn down and  the work begun. Had they put forth to maintain themselves at Port Royal  the energy and resource which they exerted to escape from it, they might  have laid the cornerstone of a solid colony.    All, gentle and simple, labored with equal zeal. They calked the seams  with the long moss which hung in profusion from the neighboring trees;  the pines supplied them with pitch; the Indians made for them a kind of  cordage; and for sails they sewed together their shirts and bedding. At  length a brigantine worthy of Robinson Crusoe floated on the waters of  the Chenonceau. They laid in what provision they could, gave all that  remained of their goods to the Indians, embarked, descended the river,  and put to sea. A fair wind filled their patchwork sails and bore them  from the hated coast. Day after day they held their course, till at  length the breeze died away and a breathless calm fell on the waters.  Florida was far behind; France farther yet before.    Floating idly on the glassy waste, the craft lay motionless. Their  supplies gave out. Twelve kernels of maize a day were each man's  portion; then the maize failed, and they ate their shoes and leather  jerkins. The water-barrels were drained, and they tried to slake their  thirst with brine. Several died, and the rest, giddy with exhaustion  and crazed with thirst, were forced to ceaseless labor, bailing out the  water that gushed through every seam. Head-winds set in, increasing to a  gale, and the wretched brigantine, with sails close-reefed, tossed among  the savage billows at the mercy of the storm. A heavy sea rolled down  upon her, and burst the bulwarks on the windward side. The surges broke  over her, and, clinging with desperate grip to spars and cordage, the  drenched voyagers gave up all for lost. At length she righted. The gale  subsided, the wind changed, and the crazy, water-logged vessel again  bore slowly towards France.    Gnawed with famine, they counted the leagues of barren ocean that still  stretched before, and gazed on each other with haggard wolfish eyes,  till a whisper passed from man to man that one, by his death, might  ransom all the rest. The lot was cast, and it fell on La Chore, the same  wretched man whom Albert had doomed to starvation on a lonely island.  They killed him, and with ravenous avidity portioned out his flesh. The  hideous repast sustained them till the land rose in sight, when, it is  said, in a delirium of joy, they could no longer steer their vessel, but  let her drift at the will of the tide. A small English bark bore down  upon them, took them all on board, and, after landing the feeblest,  carried the rest prisoners to Queen Elizabeth. [12]    Thus closed another of those scenes of woe whose lurid clouds are  thickly piled around the stormy dawn of American history. It was the  opening act of a wild and tragic drama.            CHAPTER IV.    1564.    LAUDONNIERE.        ON the twenty-fifth of June, 1564, a French squadron anchored a second  time off the mouth of the River of May. There were three vessels, the  smallest of sixty tons, the largest of one hundred and twenty, all  crowded with men. Rene de Laudonniere held command. He was of a noble  race of Poiton, attached to the house of Chatillon, of which Coligny  was the head; pious, we are told, and an excellent marine officer. An  engraving, purporting to be his likeness, shows us a slender figure,  leaning against the mast, booted to the thigh, with slouched hat and  plume, slashed doublet, and short cloak. His thin oval face, with curled  moustache and close-trimmed beard, wears a somewhat pensive look, as if  already shadowed by the destiny that awaited him.    The intervening year since Ribaut's voyage had been a dark year for  France. From the peaceful solitude of the River of May, that voyager  returned to a land reeking with slaughter. But the carnival of bigotry  and hate had found a pause. The Peace of Amboise had been signed. The  fierce monk choked down his venom; the soldier sheathed his sword, the  assassin his dagger; rival chiefs grasped hands, and masked their rancor  under hollow smiles. The king and the queen-mother, helpless amid the  storm of factions which threatened their destruction, smiled now on  Conde, now on Guise,--gave ear to the Cardinal of Lorraine, or listened  in secret to the emissaries of Theodore Beza. Coligny was again strong  at Court. He used his opportunity, and solicited with success the means  of renewing his enterprise of colonization.    Men were mustered for the work. In name, at least, they were all  Huguenots yet now, as before, the staple of the projected colony was  unsound,--soldiers, paid out of the royal treasury, hired artisans and  tradesmen, with a swarm of volunteers from the young Huguenot nobles,  whose restless swords had rusted in their scabbards since the peace. The  foundation-stone was forgotten. There were no tillers of the soil. Such,  indeed, were rare among the Huegonots; for the dull peasants who guided  the plough clung with blind tenacity to the ancient faith. Adventurous  gentlemen, reckless soldiers, discontented tradesmen, all keen for  novelty and heated with dreams of wealth,--these were they who would  build for their country and their religion an empire beyond the sea.    On Thursday, the twenty-second of June, Laudonniere saw the low  coast-line of Florida, and entered the harbor of St. Augustine, which he  named the River of Dolphins, \"because that at mine arrival I saw there a  great number of Dolphins which were playing in the mouth thereof.\" Then  he bore northward, following the coast till, on the twenty-fifth,  he reached the mouth of the St. John's or River of May. The vessels  anchored, the boats were lowered, and he landed with his principal  followers on the south shore, near the present village of Mayport. It  was the very spot where he had landed with Ribaut two years before.  They were scarcely on shore when they saw an Indian chief, \"which having  espied us cryed very far off, Antipola! Antipola! and being so joyful  that he could not containe himselfe, he came to meet us accompanied with  two of his sonnes, as faire and mightie persons as might be found in  al the world. There was in their trayne a great number of men and women  which stil made very much of us, and by signes made us understand  how glad they were of our arrival.
