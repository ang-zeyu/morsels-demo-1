The use  of a balance pole is advised, but where, for any reason, it cannot be  used, the traps should be fastened to a heavy log. The most common  method for trapping the fisher is by setting a trap in a pen of  stakes or a natural enclosure, the same as recommended for marten,  but the pen should be larger. It should be two feet high, wide at the  top and just wide enough for the trap at the bottom.    The bait should be placed on a stick in the back of the pen and the  trap should be covered with some light material. The pen should be  roofed with evergreen boughs, to protect the trap from the snow. It  is the custom among the Indian trappers to make the trap pen of green  wood, splitting it and placing the stakes so that the split side will  be inward. The object in this is to enable the animal to more easily  locate the bait, for sometimes when the fisher scents the bait but  cannot find it at once, he moves on. If however, the pen presents a  bright interior it attracts the animal's attention and leads to an  investigation. This method is used generally, but should not be  employed when setting for the more wary animals.    The Indians also at times hang the bait by a piece of light wire,  in preference to placing on a stick. This is so that the little  wood-mice can not reach and destroy the bait, and I have found it to  be a very good plan. A small twig should be placed under the pan of  the trap to prevent squirrels and birds from springing it.    For trapping the fisher, I recommend the No. 1 1/2 traps of all  makes, also the No. 2 Victor and Oneida Jump traps. Mr. Charles  Carner, a noted trapper of California, uses the following method.  Find somewhere on the fisher's route of travel, a small bushy  evergreen tree with limbs coming down to the ground, cut away a few  of the limbs, on one side, so as to make a sort of enclosure. The  limbs that are cut away should be stuck in at the sides and back to  make the pen tighter. The bait should be tied to the stem of the tree  and the trap set a short distance in front of the bait, so as to  catch the animal by the fore foot. The trap is fastened securely to  the butt of the tree. Mr. Carner recommends the use of the following  scent. Fish oil, oil of anise, assafoetida and muskrat musk,  thoroughly mixed. He saturates a rabbit with the scent and draws it  from trap to trap, and on the last trap uses the rabbit for bait.  This scent is also used by some other noted trappers.    I have also caught fishers by building a pen on an old log, lying  with one end above the ground. I would make some splits in the log  with my axe, drive in a few stakes and weave evergreen boughs among  the stakes, roofing the pen with boughs. The trap should be set the  same as in the first method and should be stapled to the top of the  log, so that when the animal jumps off on either side, he can not get  his front feet or the trap down to the ground. The above methods are  all very good, but if a particularly shy animal refuses to enter the  pen, try setting in a natural enclosure, and if this fails, try the  following method:    Under some thick evergreen tree, scrape up a cone shaped pile of  snow, making it two feet high and pack the snow solid. Have the trap  fastened to a clog and bury the clog in the snow. In the very top of  the mound, hollow out a place for the trap and line this place with  evergreen tips. Set the trap in this nest, cover it with a piece of  paper, and brush a half inch of snow lightly over the paper. For  bait, use a whole partridge or rabbit and hang it by a string from a  limb of the tree, so that it hangs about two and a half feet above  the trap.    Brush your tracks shut with a bunch of boughs and when looking at the  trap do not go too close. This method is very good for the shy ones  but is too much trouble to use as a regular set, when putting out a  long line of traps. The best places in which to set for fishers is in  the timbered ravines, especially where two ravines join. Other good  places are at the ends of lakes, the points of swamps, and in narrow  strips of timber connecting larger bodies.    The track of the fisher is very similar to that of the marten but is  larger. The length of jump is about three feet and the footprints  from one and a half to two inches in length.      [Illustration: The Otter.]        CHAPTER VII.    THE OTTER.    The otter is a carnivorous animal, somewhat resembling the mink in  appearance. They are found in various parts of the world and will be  met with in most of the wilder parts of North America. The northern  or Canadian otter is the most common, but there are other varieties  known as the Carolina otter, the Florida otter and the Newfoundland  otter. In habits and general appearance they are all similar.    A distinct species is found in the North Pacific, and is known as the  sea otter. This animal is considerably larger than the fresh water  species, and has a shorter tail. The fur is of great value.    The otter is an aquatic animal, living in and near the streams and  lakes, and getting its living from them. It has a long body, short,  stout legs, and webbed feet; the tail is long, thick at the base, and  tapering to a point. The neck is thick, the head comparatively small,  with small ears, set well down on the sides of the head. The fur is  of two kinds, the under fur being fine, soft and wavy, and of a light  silvery color; while the outer fur or guard hairs, are longer,  coarser, and usually straight, the color varying from brown to almost  black. The fur of the tail and under parts is shorter and stiffer  than that on the back, sides and neck; that on the under parts having  a silvery tint. Otters frequently measure three and one-half feet in  length and weigh from fifteen to twenty-five pounds. The skin, when  stretched, will often measure five feet from tip to tip, and  sometimes even more.    The food of the otter consists principally of fish, trout being their  favorite food; but they also feed on muskrats, clams, frogs, and the  smaller animal life, found in the beds of streams and lakes.    They capture muskrats by entering their houses and their holes in the  banks.    Otters usually make burrows in the banks of streams, lining the nest  with leaves and grass. The entrances to these burrows are under the  water and it is my belief that they inhabit them only during the  breeding season. The young are born in April and May and there are  from two to four in a litter.    The otter is a great traveler, following the lakes and water courses,  sometimes going a distance of one hundred miles on a single trip.  Apparently he is always in a great hurry to reach a certain place,  some lake or pond, at which, having reached, he may remain for  several months, and again he may leave immediately after his arrival.    Otters sometimes have slides on the banks of streams, down which they  slide into the water, apparently for pastime. They also have landing  places on the banks of streams and on logs projecting into the water,  where they go to roll in the grass and leaves, or to lie in the sun.  These places are seldom visited in the fall, but in the spring, they  will land at almost every place as they come along.    In traveling, they usually follow the center of the stream, as they  are more at home in the water than on land. In winter they travel  under the ice, wherever the water is deep enough to allow of their  passage. The otter's legs being very short, he has a peculiar method  of traveling on the ice or snow. He throws himself forward, sliding  on his belly, and by repeating the move in rapid succession, is  enabled to get along at a surprising rate of speed.    Wherever there is a sharp bend in the stream, the otter will make a  short cut across the point, and if the stream is traveled much, you  will find a well-defined trail in such a place. Where two streams lie  close together, they sometimes have a trail from one stream to  another. Also wherever a long point of land projects into a lake,  they are likely to have a trail across the point.    The otter appears to be on very friendly terms with the beaver, and  if there are any beavers in the country, the otter is sure to find  them and will spend considerable time in the same pond. When there  are a number of families of beavers in the same locality, the otter  will spend nearly all of its time with the beavers, visiting from one  family to another. Wherever he finds beaver cutting along the stream,  he examines it, and will most likely follow up the stream to find the  beaver. This habit is taken advantage of by the Indian trappers of  the north, as will be explained later.    In the north, the otter becomes prime about the first week in  November, and remains in good condition until about the first of  June. In the south they are seldom prime until the first of December,  and commence to shed from the first to the fifteenth of April. The  fur of the otter is valuable, the dark, straight haired ones being  worth the most. Occasionally an otter is found having a decided curl  to the ends of the hair, the ends being turned forward. These are  called \"curly\" otters and are not near so valuable as the others.    Otters are found in good numbers in the swamps of the southern  states; in Florida, Arkansas, Mississippi, Louisiana and the lowlands  of Texas. They are also quite plentiful in some parts of  Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Vermont and Maine; also in the wilds of  Labrador, Ungava, Quebec, Ontario, Yukon, Mackenzie and Alaska. The  most valuable otters come from the far north, but they are probably  more plentiful in the south, and the southern trapper has the  advantage of having open water all winter.    The best traps for otter are the numbers 2 1/2, 3 and 3 1/2 Newhouse;  the Nos. 3 and 4 Hawley & Norton; and the No. 14 Oneida jump, also  the \"Sem"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/341"],[0,"Myths and Legends of the Sioux (#7)"],[1,"been for  the frogs we would have had no rabbits, as the whole nation would have  drowned themselves and the rabbit race would have been extinct.              HOW THE RABBIT LOST HIS TAIL    Once upon a time there were two brothers, one a great Genie and the  other a rabbit. Like all genie, the older could change himself into any  kind of an animal, bird, fish, cloud, thunder and lightning, or in fact  anything that he desired.    The younger brother (the rabbit) was very mischievous and was  continually getting into all kinds of trouble. His older brother was  kept busy getting Rabbit out of all kinds of scrapes.    When Rabbit had attained his full growth he wanted to travel around and  see something of the world. When he told his brother what he intended to  do, the brother said: \"Now, Rabbit, you are Witkotko (mischievous), so  be very careful, and keep out of trouble as much as possible. In case  you get into any serious trouble, and can't get out by yourself, just  call on me for assistance, and no matter where you are, I will come to  you.\"    Rabbit started out and the first day he came to a very high house,  outside of which stood a very high pine tree. So high was the tree that  Rabbit could hardly see the top. Outside the door, on an enormous stool,  sat a very large giant fast asleep. Rabbit (having his bow and arrows  with him) strung up his bow, and, taking an arrow from his quiver, said:    \"I want to see how big this man is, so I guess I will wake him up.\" So  saying he moved over to one side and took good aim, and shot the giant  upon the nose. This stung like fire and awoke the giant, who jumped up,  crying: \"Who had the audacity to shoot me on the nose?\" \"I did,\" said  Rabbit.    The giant, hearing a voice, looked all around, but saw nothing, until he  looked down at the corner of the house, and there sat a rabbit.    \"I had hiccoughs this morning and thought that I was going to have a  good big meal, and here is nothing but a toothful.\"    \"I guess you won't make a toothful of me,\" said Rabbit, \"I am as strong  as you, though I am little.\" \"We will see,\" said the giant. He went into  the house and came out, bringing a hammer that weighed many tons.    \"Now, Mr. Rabbit, we will see who can throw this hammer over the top of  that tree.\" \"Get something harder to do,\" said Rabbit.    \"Well, we will try this first,\" said the giant. With that he grasped the  hammer in both hands, swung it three times around his head and sent it  spinning thru the air. Up, up, it went, skimming the top of the tree,  and came down, shaking the ground and burying itself deep into the  earth.    \"Now,\" said the giant, \"if you don't accomplish this same feat, I am  going to swallow you at one mouthful.\" Rabbit said, \"I always sing to my  brother before I attempt things like this.\" So he commenced singing and  calling his brother. \"Cinye! Cinye!\" (brother, brother) he sang. The  giant grew nervous, and said: \"Boy, why do you call your brother?\"    Pointing to a small black cloud that was approaching very swiftly,  Rabbit said: \"That is my brother; he can destroy you, your house, and  pine tree in one breath.\"    \"Stop him and you can go free,\" said the giant. Rabbit waved his paws  and the cloud disappeared.    From this place Rabbit continued on his trip towards the west. The next  day, while passing thru a deep forest, he thought he heard some one  moaning, as though in pain. He stopped and listened; soon the wind blew  and the moaning grew louder. Following the direction from whence came  the sound, he soon discovered a man stripped of his clothing, and caught  between two limbs of a tall elm tree. When the wind blew the limbs would  rub together and squeeze the man, who would give forth the mournful  groans.    \"My, you have a fine place up there. Let us change. You can come down  and I will take your place.\" (Now this man had been placed up there for  punishment, by Rabbit's brother, and he could not get down unless some  one came along and proposed to take his place on the tree). \"Very well,\"  said the man. \"Take off your clothes and come up. I will fasten you in  the limbs and you can have all the fun you want.\"    Rabbit disrobed and climbed up. The man placed him between the limbs and  slid down the tree. He hurriedly got into Rabbit's clothes, and just as  he had completed his toilet, the wind blew very hard. Rabbit was nearly  crazy with pain, and screamed and cried. Then he began to cry \"Cinye,  Cinye\" (brother, brother). \"Call your brother as much as you like, he  can never find me.\" So saying the man disappeared in the forest.    Scarcely had he disappeared, when the brother arrived, and seeing Rabbit  in the tree, said: \"Which way did he go?\" Rabbit pointed the direction  taken by the man. The brother flew over the top of the trees, soon found  the man and brought him back, making him take his old place between the  limbs, and causing a heavy wind to blow and continue all afternoon and  night, for punishment to the man for having placed his brother up there.    After Rabbit got his clothes back on, his brother gave him a good  scolding, and wound up by saying: \"I want you to be more careful in the  future. I have plenty of work to keep me as busy as I want to be, and I  can't be stopping every little while to be making trips to get you out  of some foolish scrape. It was only yesterday that I came five hundred  miles to help you from the giant, and today I have had to come a  thousand miles, so be more careful from this on.\"    Several days after this the Rabbit was traveling along the banks of a  small river, when he came to a small clearing in the woods, and in the  center of the clearing stood a nice little log hut. Rabbit was wondering  who could be living here when the door slowly opened and an old man  appeared in the doorway, bearing a tripe water pail in his right hand.  In his left hand he held a string which was fastened to the inside of  the house. He kept hold of the string and came slowly down to the river.  When he got to the water he stooped down and dipped the pail into it and  returned to the house, still holding the string for guidance.    Soon he reappeared holding on to another string, and, following this  one, went to a large pile of wood and returned to the house with it.  Rabbit wanted to see if the old man would come out again, but he came  out no more. Seeing smoke ascending from the mud chimney, he thought  he would go over and see what the old man was doing. He knocked at the  door, and a weak voice bade him enter. He noticed that the old man was  cooking dinner.    \"Hello Tunkasina (grandfather), you must have a nice time, living here  alone. I see that you have everything handy. You can get wood and water,  and that is all you have to do. How do you get your provisions?\"    \"The wolves bring my meat, the mice my rice and ground beans, and the  birds bring me the cherry leaves for my tea. Yet it is a hard life, as I  am all alone most of the time and have no one to talk to, and besides, I  am blind.\"    \"Say, grandfather,\" said Rabbit, \"let us change places. I think I would  like to live here.\"    \"If we exchange clothes,\" said the other, \"you will become old and  blind, while I will assume your youth and good looks.\" (Now, this old  man was placed here for punishment by Rabbit's brother. He had killed  his wife, so the genie made him old and blind, and he would remain so  until some one came who would exchange places with him).    \"I don't care for youth and good looks,\" said Rabbit, \"let us make the  change.\"    They changed clothes, and Rabbit became old and blind, whilst the old  man became young and handsome.    \"Well, I must go,\" said the man. He went out and cutting the strings  close to the door, ran off laughing. \"You will get enough of your living  alone, you crazy boy,\" and saying this he ran into the woods.    Rabbit thought he would like to get some fresh water and try the string  paths so that he would get accustomed to it. He bumped around the room  and finally found the tripe water bucket. He took hold of the string and  started out. When he had gotten a short distance from the door he came  to the end of the string so suddenly, that he lost the end which he  had in his hand, and he wandered about, bumping against the trees, and  tangling himself up in plum bushes and thorns, scratching his face  and hands so badly that the blood ran from them. Then it was that he  commenced again to cry, \"Cinye! Cinye!\" (brother, brother). Soon his  brother arrived, and asked which way the old man had gone.    \"I don't know,\" said Rabbit, \"I couldn't see which path he took, as I  was blind.\"    The genie called the birds, and they came flying from every direction.  As fast as they arrived the brother asked them if they had seen the man  whom he had placed here for punishment, but none had seen him. The owl  came last, and when asked if he had seen the man, he said \"hoo-hoo.\"  \"The man who lived here,\" said the brother. \"Last night I was hunting  mice in the woods south of here and I saw a man sleeping beneath a plum  tree. I thought it was your brother, Rabbit, so I didn't awaken him,\"  said the owl.    \"Good for you, owl,\" said the brother, \"for this good news, you shall  hereafter roam around only at night, and I will fix your eyes, so the  darker the night the better you will be able to see. You will always  have the fine cool nights to hunt your food. You other birds can hunt  your food during the hot daylight.\" (Since then the owl has been the  night bird).    The brother flew to the woods and brought the man back and cut the  strings short, and said to him: \"Now you can get a taste of what you  gave my brother.\"    To Rabbit he said: \"I ought not to have helped you this time. Any one  who is so crazy as to change places with a blind man should be left  without help, so be careful, as I am getting tired of your foolishness,  and will not help you again if you do"]]]
