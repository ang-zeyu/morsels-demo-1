And then, to  apply their figure, man in the brothel, jail, or on gibbets, is in the  way to all that is lovely and true. Such reminds us of the ravings of  lunatics. It is the climax of profanation of the moral government of  God. Let those who fear no God, but have wives and children and property  to lose, reflect upon the propriety of lending their influence to a  system fraught with such consequences. The system positively denies the  distinction between good and evil. It declares that we can not sin;  that we are God, and God can not offend against himself; that sin is all  simply an old lie; that impiety, immorality and vice of frightful mien  are wedded in eternal decrees, and that man can not sever them.    _Pantheism is veiled Atheism._ It is not necessary to argue this  proposition at length. Pantheists often speak of the great being, which,  according to Pantheism, is composed of all the intelligences of the  universe. Can any man conceive of such a being? Can intelligences be  piled one upon another, like brick and mortar, and thus be compounded?  And if my spirit be the highest intelligence in the universe, did it  create itself? Does it govern itself? Did it create the universe? Does  it govern it? Some Pantheists have gone to this length! M. Comte says:  \"At this present time, for minds properly familiarized with true  astronomical philosophy, the heavens display no other glory than that of  Hipparchus, or Kepler, or Newton, and of all who have helped to  establish these laws.\" \"Establish these laws!\" They were laws governing  the planets thousands of years before these astronomers were born.    Pantheists often express very high respect for the Christian religion.  Some of the more vulgar sort, however, speak of it as a superstition.  But the wiser ones have reached the perfection of Jesuitism, that is to  say, they indulge in hypocrisy and deception to effect a purpose. They  grant that the Christian religion is the highest development of humanity  yet attained by a majority of the race. The heathen of every grade of  character, and the Christian, with all others who may not be classified  by us with either, are all, in their scheme, so many successive  developments of humanity. It is a trick of their trade to clothe their  abominations in Bible language by wresting the Scriptures. They speak of  the \"beauty of holiness in the mind, that surmounted every idea of a  personal God;\" and of \"God dwelling in us, and his love perfected in  us,\" when they maintain that he dwells in every creature and thing. They  say they can accept the Bible--that is their phrase--notwithstanding it  pronounces death upon the fools who, \"professing to be wise, change the  truth of God into a lie, and worship and serve the creature more than  the Creator,\" as a mystic revelation of the Pantheism which leaves us to  \"erect everything into a God,\" provided it is none, inasmuch as \"every  product of the human mind is a development of Deity.\" So the Bible, in  the conclusion of their system, is on a level with Thomas Paine's  writings as respects inspiration and origin. The great Pantheistic  divinity is spoken of by Pantheists as the great soul of the universe,  while the more materialistic look upon it as the universe itself, body  and soul. With them the soul is the fountain of all the imponderable  forces, vegetable and animal life, the mesmeric influences, galvanism,  magnetism, electricity, light and heat; and the body the sum of all the  ponderable substances; in one word, \"God is everything, and everything  is God.\" This system is called \"Monotheistic Pantheism.\" It is a vast  generalization of everything into a higher unity, which exalts men and  paving stones, and cats, dogs and reptiles, and monkeys, to the same  level of God-head, or divinity. Man, the soul of men, as the system  would term it, is the greatest manifestation of the divine essence. Yes!  DIVINE ESSENCE! for, with Pantheists, there is no _personal_ hereafter.  This system of Pantheism is an old, worn-out theory; it has putrefied  and rotted with the worshippers of cats, monkeys, and holy cows and  bulls, and pieces of sticks and stones on the Ganges more than two  thousand years ago. It is now dragged up from the dung-hill and  presented as a new discovery of modern philosophy, sufficient to  supplant the Ruler of the universe. How strange it is that men of  ordinary intelligence will embrace the idea, rather than submit to the  dictates of conscience and the Bible! This world of ours is not an  abstraction in philosophy that consists of one simple substance called  matter, nor yet of one substance, for there are many different material  substances, such as oxygen, carbon, hydrogen, sulphur, aluminum and  iron, and more than fifty others already discovered.    Now, let us suppose that all these elements or substances existed as a  cloud of atoms millions of ages in the past; are we, then, any nearer  the solution of the great problem of world making than we were before?  The atoms must be material, for a material world is to be made of them;  and they must have extension; each one of them must have length, breadth  and thickness; and, as inertia is a property of each and every atom, the  Pantheist has only multiplied the difficulty by millions, for matter can  not begin, _of itself_, to move. Did the dead atoms dance about and  jumble themselves together as we now find them? Is the one substance  theory correct? Monotheistic Pantheism _is scientifically false in  fact_. Some of these men who tell us of a world without an intelligence  in the past, who have such implicit confidence in the powers of matter,  tell us, that \"millions of ages\" in the past the world existed as a  great cloud of fire mist, which, after a long time cooled down into  granite; and this, by dint of earthquakes, broke up on the surface, and  washed with rain until, after ages upon ages had passed, clays and soil  were formed, from which plants, of their own accord, sprang up without a  germ; in other words, germs came into being spontaneously and grew up,  as we see them, developed in all their grandeur. This chance life,  somehow, chanced to assume animal form and fashion until, in the  multitude of its changes it reached the fashion of the monkey; and then,  at last, the fashion of man, both male and female. Truly, the Atheists  and Pantheists of our country need not complain of any want of power to  believe while such is their basis of faith upon the subject of world  making. But they, to avoid the difficulty that nothing made something,  tell us \"the fire mist was eternal,\" that it did not make itself. Very  well, let us have it that way; then we must be allowed to ask, how an  eternal red hot mist cooled off? And also what there was to cool it,  when it was all there was, and it was red hot, and always had been? In  other words, how could an eternal red hot cool down without something  else in existence to cool it? Why should it cool at all? And why did it  begin to cool just when it did? The utmost that any scientist can do is  to show that such a change took place, but he can not tell you why it  took place. Change _it did_! But change is an effect, and requires a  cause. And, according to their theory, there could be no cause outside  of the fire mist; for they say there was nothing else in the universe.  Then the cause was inside of the fire mist. But how can red hot cool  when all there is, is red hot? Had this first mist, to say nothing of  organic life, a mind? Did it become sensible and resolve to cool off a  little, and settle itself into orderly worlds? What became of its mind?  Did it divide, and a part go to each planet? Has each planet a great  \"soul of the world,\" as well as our earth? If so, had we not as well  build an altar to each planet and go back to the religion of our  banana-fed ancestors, who burned their children alive in sun worship?    The Christian religion is so fearfully demoralizing (?) that it is a  great pity that these Godless, Christless souls called Pantheists and  Atheists can't get some solution of the great problem of world-making  that would dispense with the Bible. How well they could get along  if--if--if--they only had this great question settled.    \"IN GOD WE TRUST.\"          SUBSTANCE OR SUBSTANCES--WHICH?    OR,    THE ORIGIN OF LIFE AND MIND.      \"_Substance_ is that which is and abides;\" \"that which subsists of or by  itself; that which lies under qualities; that which truly is--or  _essence_.\" \"It is opposed to _accident_.\" \"In its logical and  metaphysical sense it is that nature of a thing which may be conceived  to remain when every other nature is removed or abstracted from it; the  ultimate point in analyzing the complex idea of any object. _Accident_  denotes all those ideas which the analysis excludes as not belonging to  the mere being or nature of the object.\" It is said that our first idea  of _substance_ is, possibly, derived from the consciousness of self, the  conviction that, while our sensations, thought and purposes are  changing, we continue the same. \"We see bodies also remaining the same  as to quantity or extension, while their color and figure, their state  of motion or rest may be changed.\" It has also been said that  _substances_ are either primary, that is singular, individual  _substances_; or secondary, that is genera, and species of _substance_.    Substances have been divided into complete and incomplete, finite and  infinite. But it is to be remembered that these are merely divisions of  being.

The lecturer glanced at the general replacement of the catastrophic  theory of geology by the uniformitarian hypothesis, claimed that many of  the most important breaks in the line of the descent of plants and  animals had been filled, noticed the great advance made in the science  of embryology, and held that the amount of our knowledge respecting the  mammalia of the Tertiary epoch had increased fifty-fold since Darwin's  work appeared, and in some directions even approaches completeness. The  lecture closed with these words: \"Thus when, on the first of October  next, 'The Origin of Species' comes of age, the promise of its youth  will be amply fulfilled and we shall be prepared to congratulate the  venerated author of the book, not only that the greatness of his  achievement and its enduring influence upon the progress of knowledge  have won him a place beside Harvey, but, still more, that, like Harvey,  he has lived long enough to outlast detraction and opposition, and to  see the stone that the builders rejected become the head-stone of the  corner.\"    This is plain and emphatic speaking, but it has not been suffered to  pass unchallenged.    Dr. Charles Elam, a writer who has already more than once measured  swords with the school of naturalists of which Professor Huxley is a  foremost champion, has been moved to respond to this latest utterance.  He has contributed to the _Contemporary Review_ a paper entitled \"The  Gospel of Evolution,\" which, whatever may be its conclusiveness, is one  of the sharpest attacks recently sustained by the opposing party.  Acknowledging at the start Mr. Darwin's pre-eminence as a naturalist,  and Prof. Huxley's equal accomplishments in the department of biology,  he yet ventures to continue his doubt regarding the evidence of their  peculiar doctrines. He first cites Darwin's admissions that it would be  fatal to his theory if any organs existed which could not have been  evolved by minute selective modifications, and his further concession  that \"man, as well as every other animal, presents structures which, as  far as we can judge, are not now of any service to him, nor have been so  during any former part of his existence. Such structures can not be  accounted for by any form of selection or by the inherited effects of  the use and disuse of parts.\"    Having contrasted Darwinism proper with its exaggerations, in the system  of Haeckel, who regards Darwin's admissions of an original creation as  contemptible, and recognizes only one force in the universe--the  mechanical, Dr. Elam compares Huxley's statement in his American  addresses that belief which is not based upon evidence is not only  illogical but immoral, with his last assertion that evolution is a fact,  doubted only by persons \"who have not reached the stage of emergence  from ignorance.\" In 1862 Huxley also said--republishing the statements  as late as 1874:    \"Obviously, if the earliest fossiliferous rocks now known are coeval  with the commencement of life, and if their contents give us any just  conception of the nature and the extent of the earliest fauna and flora,  the insignificant amount of modification which can be demonstrated to  have taken place in any one group of animals or plants is quite  incompatible with the hypothesis that all living forms are the results  of a necessary process of a progressive development, entirely comprised  within the time represented by the fossiliferous rocks.\"    Since this confession was uttered, whatever discoveries may have been  made, there has not been the faintest indication of the development of  any new species by artificial selection, the individuals of which are  fertile among themselves and infertile with the parent stock. It may  properly be alleged that there has not been time enough for such a slow  process, but it yet remains as true as ever that there is no direct  evidence in nature of what the Darwinians call _favorable variation_. It  is the unwritten law of nature that one race must die that another may  live, this other, in its turn, subserving the same end. Without this law  nature would be a chaotic impossibility. If natural selection were a  real agency, we ought to meet with frequent, if not constant, evidences  of transition, and a slow and gradual, but perceptible improvement in  species, especially marked in those whose generations succeed each other  rapidly. But we see nothing of the kind. But did selection really exist,  it would be incompetent to account for a multitude of structures and  functions to which any efficient cause should be applicable, notably to  the earliest rudiments of useful organs. Such organs as the eye and the  internal ear are quite out of reach of any explanation by natural  selection. Since the development of the eyes, due to the simultaneous  growth of parts from within and without, the organ itself would be  absolutely useless until it had attained such a degree of development as  to admit of these separate parts meeting, and so the principle of  preserving any useful variety would be quite inapplicable. The same is  true of the internal ear.    Dr. Elam next passes in review Haeckel's Geneology of Man from the  Lowest Monera to his Present Station as Lord of Creation. What the  Germans call invention of species to fill troublesome gaps is  illustrated in many ways, but we have room only for a single example:    \"The vertebrata must be developed from something, and as yet there has  been no smallest indication of anything like a spine or a rudiment of  anything that could represent or be converted into one. It costs our  author nothing but a stroke of his pen to invent the 'Chordonia,' and  whence did they come? They were developed from the worms by the  formation of a spinal marrow and a _chorda dorsulis_. Nothing more--the  most trifling modification!--and we are at once provided with the root  and stem of the whole vertebrata divisions. It is scarcely any drawback  to this stroke of genius to say that there is no evidence whatever that  such an order of living beings ever existed; that no one has the least  conception of what they were like, or of any of their attributes. Prof.  Huxley's responsibility for this imaginative science is evidenced by his  declaration that the conception of geological time is the only point  upon which he fundamentally and entirely disagrees with Haeckel.\"    It still remains true that all our positive and direct knowledge as to  species contradicts the evolution hypothesis. Its evidence is purely  inferential, and, as Dr. Elam quietly says, \"As a psychological study it  is interesting to observe how many things are deemed impossible to the  infinite wisdom and power (which by the terms of the supposition,  presided over the arrangements of our world) which are perfectly clear  and comprehensible when considered as the result of blind chance and the  operation of mechanical causes only.\" Omitting for lack of space his  keen analysis of Huxley's claim of the evidence of evolution from the  orchippus to the modern horse, we follow our author from his array of  what is not proved to what is actually taught by geology. We quote:    \"THE SUCCESSION OF FORMS OF LIFE ON OUR GLOBE IS DEMONSTRABLY NOT SUCH  AS OUGHT TO BE THE CASE ON THE THEORY OF EVOLUTION.\" It was not the small  and feeble species or most generalized forms that first appeared,  either among mollusks, fish, reptiles or mammalia. We look in vain now  for the representatives of the gigantic fishes of the Old Red Sandstone.  And where are the mighty reptile tyrants of air, earth and water of the  Oolite? * * * These races appeared in the plenitude of their development  and power; and, as their dynasty grew old, it was not that the race was  improved or preserved in consequence, but they dwindled, and were, so to  speak, degraded, as if to make room in the economy of nature for their  successors.    Next follows a closely linked argument that will not bear abridgement,  showing the physical improbability that man, a walking animal, was  descended from a climbing one, and the deplorable consequences which  obliterate free will and necessitate the secularization of morals, as  elaborated by Prof. Huxley's friend, Mr. Herbert Spencer. This part of  the subject has a special interest to Americans, since the work in which  Mr. Spencer's views are inculcated has been introduced as a manual in  one of our oldest colleges, but its reproduction would widely lengthen  our article. It is sufficient to say that Dr. Elam concludes that Mr.  Spencer's doctrine, that \"actions are completely right only when,  besides being conducive to future happiness, they are immediately  pleasurable,\" would justify him in concealing any injury done by him to  a friend's scientific apparatus, provided he could attribute it to the  weather, or the intrusion of a dog.    Such, in brief, are the points of an essay which, as a whole, is one of  the most brilliant responses that the declarations of leading  evolutionists have called forth. Of course, all its points are not new,  but old objections have been skillfully refurbished and new ones brought  into play.          *      *      *      *      *    To mourn for the dead, is to mourn for the lost casket when you still  retain the jewel it held. The memories of the dead one's virtues are the  jewels, and the cold clay but the casket.          AUTHORSHIPS OF THE BOOKS OF THE NEW TESTAMENT.      I have a few questions to put to every man who says Christianity is not  true. They are these: If Christianity is not true, where did it come  from? How came it into the world? What is its origin? These questions  are not trifling ones. Infidels have given as many different answers to  them as there are days in the week. There is no agreement among them  that amounts to a settlement of the questions among themselves. The  Scriptures"]]]
