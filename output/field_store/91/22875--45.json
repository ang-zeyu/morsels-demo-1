This, however, was  of short duration, for though the domination of the Sultan of Delhi  in that tract was completely destroyed, yet three years later, viz,  on Friday the 24th Rabi-al-akhir A.H. 748, according to Firishtah,  a date which corresponds to Friday, August 3, A.D. 1347, Ala-ud-din  Bahmani was crowned sovereign of the Dakhan at Kulbarga, establishing  a new dynasty which lasted for about 140 years.    A few years after this there was a successful invasion of the Carnatic  country by Ala-ud-Din; but though the army returned with some booty  Firishtah does not claim for him a decisive victory. He does, however,  claim that the new Sultan extended his territory as far south as the  river Tungabhadra, \"the vicinity of the fortress of Adoni.\" Ala-ud-din  died at the age of sixty-seven on Sunday, February 2, A.D. 1358,[39]  and was succeeded by Muhammad Shah. The Raya of Vijayanagar had  presented Ala-ud-din with a ruby of inestimable price, and this,  set in a bird of paradise composed of precious stones, the Sultan  placed in the canopy over his throne; but some say that this was done  by Muhammad, and that the ruby was placed above his umbrella of State.    Early in the reign of Muhammad it was discovered that the gold and  silver coins of the Bahrami Sultans were being melted down in large  quantities by the Hindus of Vijayanagar and Warangal, and numbers  of the merchants were put to death. At the same time Bukka I.,  supported by his friend at Warangal, demanded the restoration of  certain territories,[40] and as the Sultan was not ready for war, he  \"during a year and a half kept the ambassadors of the Raies at his  court, and sent his own to Beejanugger to amuse his enemies.\" Finally  he resolved on war, and made extravagant counter-demands on the  Hindus. Bukka joined forces with Warangal, and Muhammad waged war  on the latter state, plundering the country up to the capital, and  retiring only on receipt of a large indemnity. Firishtah does not  relate that any further campaign was at that time initiated, and we  are therefore free to suppose that the Muhammadans were unable to  press their advantage. Warangal was not long left in peace, and it  may be well to glance at its subsequent history before returning to  the events of the reign of Bukka at Vijayanagar.    After an interval, enraged at an insult offered or supposed to have  been offered by the Rajah of Warangal, Muhammad made a rapid advance  to the former's city of \"Vellunputtun,\" as it is spelt by Firishtah,  or \"Filampatan,\" according to the author of the BURHAN-I-MAASIR. He  seized it, slaughtered the inhabitants without mercy, and captured  the unfortunate prince Vinayaka Deva.[41] The Sultan \"commanded a  pile of wood to be lighted before the citadel, and putting Nagdeo in  an engine (catapult), had him shot from the walls into the flames,  in which he was consumed.\" After a few days' rest the Sultan retired,  but was followed and harassed by large bodies of Hindus and completely  routed. Only 1500 men returned to Kulbarga, and the Sultan himself  received a severe wound in his arm.    This was followed by a joint embassy from Bukka of Vijayanagar and  the prince of Warangal to the Sultan of Delhi, in which they offered  to act in conjunction with him should an army be sent southwards  by that monarch in order to regain his lost power in the Dakhan;  \"but Feroze Shah, being too much employed with domestic commotions to  assist them, did not attend to their representations.\" Thus encouraged,  Muhammad assembled fresh forces and despatched them in two divisions  against Warangal and Golkonda. The expedition was successful and the  Rajah submitted, the Sultan receiving Golkonda, an immense treasure,  and a magnificent throne as the price of peace. The throne was set  with precious stones of great value, and being still further enriched  by subsequent sovereigns was at one time valued at four millions  sterling.[42] Warangal finally fell in A.D. 1424, and was annexed  to the Bahmani kingdom, thus bringing the Muhammadans down to the  River Krishna all along its length except in the neighbourhood of  the east coast.    Now for the principal events of Bukka's reign and the affairs of  Vijayanagar. The story deepens in interest from about the year 1365,  and for two centuries we can follow the fortunes of the Hindu kingdom  without much difficulty.    Early in A.D. 1366[43] the Sultan opened his first regular campaign  against Vijayanagar. Originating in an after-dinner jest, it ended  only after such slaughter that Firishtah computes the victims on  the Hindu side alone as numbering no less than half a million. The  story is told us by an eye-witness, one Mullah Daud of Bidar, who  was seal-bearer to Sultan Muhammad.[44]    \"One evening, when the spring of the garden of mirth had infused  the cheek of Mahummud Shaw with the rosy tinge of delight, a band  of musicians sung two verses of Ameer Khoossroo in praise of kings,  festivity, and music. The Sultan was delighted beyond measure,  and commanded Mallek Syef ad Dien Ghoree to give the three hundred  performers a draft for a gratuity on the treasury of the roy of  Beejanuggur. The minister, though he judged the order the effect of  wine, in compliance with the humour of the Sultan wrote it, but did  not despatch it. However, Mahummud Shaw penetrated his thoughts. The  next day he inquired if the draft had been sent to the roy, and  being answered, not, exclaimed, 'Think you a word without meaning  could escape my lips? I did not give the order in intoxication, but  serious design.' Mallek Syef ad Dien upon this, affixed the royal  seal to the draft, and despatched it by express messenger to the  roy of Beejanuggur. The roy, haughty and proud of his independence,  placed the presenter of the draft on an ass's back, and, parading him  through all the quarters of Beejanuggur, sent him back with every  mark of contempt and derision. He also gave immediate orders for  assembling his troops, and prepared to attack the dominions of the  house of Bhamenee. With this intent he marched with thirty thousand  horse, three thousand elephants, and one hundred thousand foot to  the vicinity of the fortress of Oodnee;[45] from whence he sent  detachments to destroy and lay waste the country of the faithful.\"    The Raya, in spite of the season being that of the rains, pressed  forward to Mudkal, an important city in the Raichur Doab, or the  large triangle of country lying west of the junction of the Krishna  and Tungabhadra rivers, a territory which was ever a debatable ground  between the Hindus and Mussulmans, and the scene of constant warfare  for the next 200 years. Mudkal was captured, and all the inhabitants,  men, women, and children, put to the sword. One man only escaped and  carried the news to Kulbarga.    \"Mahummud Shaw, on hearing it, was seized with a transport of grief  and rage, in which he commanded the unfortunate messenger to be  instantly put to death; exclaiming that he could never bear in his  presence a wretch who could survive the sight of the slaughter of so  many brave companions.\"    The same day -- I.E. on a day in A.H. 767, in the month of  Jamad-ul-awwal, which lasted from January to February 13, A.D. 1366 --  the Sultan marched southwards taking a solemn oath --    \"that till he should have put to death one hundred thousand infidels,  as an expiation for the massacre of the faithful, he would never  sheathe the sword of holy war nor refrain from slaughter. When he  reached the banks of the Kistna, he swore by the power who had created  and exalted him to dominion, that eating or sleep should be unlawful  for him till he had crossed that river in face of the enemy, by the  blessing of heaven routed their army, and gladdened the souls of the  martyrs of Mudkul with the blood of their murderers. He then appointed  his son Mujahid Shaw to succeed him, and Mallek Syef ad Dien regent  of his kingdom. He resigned all his elephants, except twenty, to the  prince, gave him his advice, and sent him back to Kulbarga. He then  crossed the river with nine thousand chosen horse without delay. The  roy of Beejanuggur, notwithstanding his vast army, was so alarmed[46]  that he sent off all his treasure, valuable baggage, and elephants  towards his capital, intending to engage the next morning, or retreat,  as he should find it adviseable. The night being stormy and heavy rain  falling, the elephants and other beasts of burden stuck frequently  in the mud,[47] and were not able to advance above four miles from  the camp. Mahummud Shaw heard of the enemy's movement during the  night, and immediately marched towards them, leaving his encampment  standing. Towards the dawn he arrived at the roy's camp, and the alarm  being given, so great was the confusion, that the infidels fled with  the utmost precipitation towards the fortress of Oodnee, leaving  everything behind them. Mahummud Shaw entered the camp of their  market and baggage, putting all to death without any distinction;  and it is said that the slaughter amounted to seventy thousand men,  women, and children.\"    Muhammad passed the hot weather and the season of the early rains that  year near Mudkal, and after being reinforced marched against Adoni --  \"in the plains of which, on the banks of the Tummedra (Tungabhadra),  the roy of Beejanuggur had taken up his station in his own territories,  having given the command of Oodnee to his sister's son. Here he had  collected a great army, and brought elephants and all the splendid  insignia of empire from Beejanuggur.\"[48]    The Sultan had with him a train of artillery[49] and in a short time  crossed the Tungabhadra, \"and entered the domains of Beejanuggur,  which were now for the first time invaded by a Muhammadan sovereign  in person.\" This remark of Firishtah's is"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33129"],[0,"Incidents of Travel in Yucatan, Vol. I. (#7)"],[1," was ornamented with large glass shades, under which candles  were burning, and garlands and wreaths of flowers. This constituted the  whole of the ceremonial part of the procession, and it was followed by  a large concourse of Indians, men and women, dressed in white, all  carrying in their hands long lighted candles.    When the crowd had passed by we strolled to the Alameda. This is the  great place of promenade and paseo in Merida. It consists of a broad  paved avenue, with a line of stone seats on each side, and beyond, on  both sides, are carriage roads, shaded by rows of trees. In full sight,  and giving a picturesque beauty to the scene, rises the Castillo, a  ruined fortress with battlements of dark gray stone, and the spires of  the old Franciscan church rising inside, romantic in its appearance,  and identified with the history of the Spanish conquest. Regularly  every Sunday there is a paseo around the castle and along the Alameda,  and this day, on account of the fete, it was one of the best and gayest  of the year.    The most striking feature, the life and beauty of the paseo, were the  calesas. Except one or two gigs, and a black, square box-wagon, which  occasionally shame the paseo, the calesa is the only wheeled carriage  in Merida. The body is somewhat like that of an oldfashioned gig, only  much larger, and resting on the shaft a little in front of the wheels.  It is painted red, with light and fancifully coloured curtains for the  sun, drawn by one horse, with a boy riding him--simple, fanciful, and  peculiar to Yucatan. Each calesa had two, and sometimes three ladies,  in the latter case the prettiest sitting in the middle and a little in  front, all without hats or veils, but their hair beautifully arranged  and trimmed with flowers. Though exposed to the gaze of thousands, they  had no boldness of manner or appearance, but, on the contrary, an air  of modesty and simplicity, and all had a mild and gentle expression.  Indeed, as they rode alone and unattended through the great mass of  pedestrians, it seemed as if their very gentleness was a protection and  shield from insult. We sat down on one of the stone benches in the  Alameda, with the young, and gay, and beautiful of Merida. Strangers  had not been there to laugh at and break up their good old customs. It  was a little nook almost unknown to the rest of the world, and  independent of it, enjoying what is so rarely found in this equalizing  age, a sort of primitive or Knickerbocker state. The great charm was  the air of contentment that reigned over the whole. If the young ladies  in the calesas had occupied the most brilliant equipages in Hyde Park,  they could not have seemed happier; and in their way, not less  attractive were the great crowds of Mestizas and Indian women, some of  the former being extremely pretty, and all having the same mild and  gentle expression; they wore a picturesque costume of white, with a red  border around the neck and skirt, and of that extraordinary cleanness  which I had remarked as the characteristic of the poorest in Merida.  For an hour, one continued stream of calesas, with ladies, and  Mestizas, and Indian women, passed us without any noise, or confusion,  or tumult, but in all there was such an air of quiet enjoyment that we  felt sad as night came on; and, as the sun sank behind the ruins of the  castillo, we thought that there were few places in the world where it  went down upon a prettier or happier scene.    The crowning ceremonies of the fiesta were a display of fireworks in  the square of the church, followed by a concert and ball. The former  was for the people, the latter for a select few. This, by-the-way,  could hardly be considered very select, as, upon the application of our  landlady, all our household received tickets.    The entertainment was given by an association of young men called _La  Sociedad Philharmonica_. It was the second of a series proposed to be  given on alternate Sundays, and already those who look coldly upon the  efforts of enterprising young men were predicting that it would not  hold out long, which prediction was unfortunately verified. It was  given in a house situated on a street running off from the Plaza, one  of the few in the city that had two stories, and which would be  considered respectable among what are called palazzos in Italy. The  entrance was into an entresol paved with stone, and the ascent by a  broad flight of stone steps. The concert room was the sala. At one end  was a platform, with instruments for the performers and amateurs, and  two rows of chairs were arranged in parallel lines, opposite each  other, the whole length of the room. When we entered, one row was  occupied entirely by ladies, while that opposite was vacant. We  approached it, but, fortunately, before exposing our ignorance of  Merida etiquette, it occurred to us that these also were intended for  ladies, and we moved on to a corner which afforded a longitudinal view  of one line and an oblique view of the other. As different parties  arrived, after leaving shawls, &c., at the door, a gentleman entered,  leading the lady by the hand, which seemed much more graceful and  gallant than our fashion of hitching her on his arm, particularly when  there were two ladies. Leading her to a seat, he left her, and retired  to the corridor, or the embrasure of a window. This continued till the  whole line of chairs was filled up, and we were crowded out of our  corner for our betters, so that the room presented a _coup d'[oe]il_ of  ladies only. Here they sat, not to be touched, handled, or spoken to,  but only to be looked at, which, long before the concert was over, some  were tired of doing, and I think I am safe in saying that the faces of  some of the ladies lighted up when the concert was done, and the  gentlemen were invited to take partners for a waltz.    For the first time in my life, I saw beauty in a waltz. It was not the  furious whirl of the French waltz, stirring up the blood, making men  perspire and young ladies look red, but a slow, gentle, and graceful  movement, apparently inducing a languid, dreaming, and delightful state  of being. The music, too, instead of bursting with a deafening crash,  stole on the ear so gently, that, though every note was heard clearly  and distinctly, it made no noise; and as the feet of the dancers fell  to the gentle cadence, it seemed as if the imagination was only touched  by the sound. Every face wore an expression of pure and refined  enjoyment--an enjoyment derived rather from sentiment than from excited  animal spirits. There were not the show and glitter of the ballroom in  Europe or at home, but there were beauty of personal appearance, taste  in dress, and propriety and simplicity of manners. At eleven o'clock  the ball broke up; and if the loteria was objectionable, and the  bull-fight brutal, the paseo and baglio redeemed them, and left on our  minds a pleasing impression of the fete of San Cristoval.    One fiesta was hardly ended when another began. On Monday was the great  fete of Todos Santos. Grand mass was said in all the churches, and in  every family prayers were offered up for the souls of the dead; and,  besides the usual ceremonies of the Catholic Church throughout the  world, there is one peculiar to Yucatan, derived from the customs of  the Indians, and called Mukbipoyo. On this day every Indian, according  to his means, purchases and burns a certain number of consecrated  candles, in honour of his deceased relatives, and in memory of each  member of his family who has died within the year. Besides this, they  bake in the earth a pie consisting of a paste of Indian corn, stuffed  with pork and fowls, and seasoned with chili, and during the day every  good Yucateco eats nothing but this. In the interior, where the Indians  are less civilized, they religiously place a portion of this  composition out of doors, under a tree, or in some retired place, for  their deceased friends to eat, and they say that the portion thus set  apart is always eaten, which induces the belief that the dead may be  enticed back by appealing to the same appetites which govern when  living; but this is sometimes accounted for by malicious and skeptical  persons, who say that in every neighbourhood there are other Indians,  poorer than those who can afford to regale their deceased relatives,  and these consider it no sin, in a matter of this kind, to step between  the living and the dead.    We have reason to remember this fete from one untoward circumstance. A  friendly neighbour, who, besides visiting us frequently with his wife  and daughter, was in the habit of sending us fruit and dulces more than  we could eat, this day, on the top of a large, undisposed-of present,  sent us a huge piece of mukbipoyo. It was as hard as an oak plank, and  as thick as six of them; and having already overtasked ourselves to  reduce the pile on the table, when this came, in a fit of desperation  we took it out into the courtyard and buried it There it would have  remained till this day but for a malicious dog which accompanied them  on their next visit; he passed into the courtyard, rooted it up, and,  while we were pointing to the empty platters as our acknowledgment of  their kindness, this villanous dog sneaked through the sala and out at  the front door with the pie in his mouth, apparently grown bigger since  it was buried.    The fetes were now ended, and we were not sorry, for now, for the first  time, we had a prospect of having our clothes washed. Ever since our  arrival, our linen, &c., accumulated during the voyage, had stood in  gaping bundles, imploring us to do something for them, but during the  continuance of the fiestas not a lavandera in Merida could be found to  take in washing.
