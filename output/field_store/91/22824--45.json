The official  document creating this order reads:      \"We, James, Prince of Trinidad, have resolved to commemorate our  accession to the throne of Trinidad by the institution of an Order of  Chivalry, destined to reward literature, industry, science, and the  human virtues, and by these presents have established and do institute,  with cross and crown, the Order of the Insignia of the Cross of  Trinidad, of which we and our heirs and successors shall be the  sovereigns.    \"Given in our Chancellery the Eighth of the month of December, one  thousand eight hundred and ninety-three, and of our reign, the First  Year.    \"JAMES.\"    There were four grades: Chevalier, Commander, Grand Officer, and Grand  Cross; and the name of each member of the order was inscribed in  \"The Book of Gold.\" A pension of one thousand francs was given to a  Chevalier, of two thousand francs to a Commander, and of three thousand  francs to a Grand Officer. Those of the grade of Grand Cross were  content with a plaque of eight diamond-studded rays, with, in the  centre, set in red enamel, the arms of Trinidad. The ribbon was red and  yellow.    A rule of the order read: \"The costume shall be identical with that of  the Chamberlains of the Court of Trinidad, save the buttons, which shall  bear the impress of the Crown of the Order.\"    For himself, King James commissioned a firm of jewelers to construct a  royal crown. In design it was similar to the one which surmounted the  cross of Trinidad. It is shown in the photograph of the insignia. Also,  the king issued a set of postage-stamps on which was a picture of  the island. They were of various colors and denominations, and among  stamp-collectors enjoyed a certain sale.    To-day, as I found when I tried to procure one to use in this book, they  are worth many times their face value.    For some time the affairs of the new kingdom progressed favorably. In  San Francisco, King James, in person, engaged four hundred coolies and  fitted out a schooner which he sent to Trinidad, where it made regular  trips between his principality and Brazil; an agent was established  on the island, and the construction of docks, wharves, and houses  was begun, while at the chancellery in West Thirty-sixth Street, the  Minister of Foreign Affairs was ready to furnish would-be settlers with  information.    And then, out of a smiling sky, a sudden and unexpected blow was struck  at the independence of the little kingdom. It was a blow from which it  never recovered.    In July of 1895, while constructing a cable to Brazil, Great Britain  found the Island of Trinidad lying in the direct line she wished to  follow, and, as a cable station, seized it. Objection to this was made  by Brazil, and at Bahia a mob with stones pelted the sign of the English  Consul-General.    By right of Halley's discovery, England claimed the island; as a  derelict from the main land, Brazil also claimed it. Between the rivals,  the world saw a chance for war, and the fact that the island really  belonged to our King James for a moment was forgotten.    But the Minister of Foreign Affairs was at his post. With promptitude  and vigor he acted. He addressed a circular note to all the powers of  Europe, and to our State Department a protest. It read as follows:        \"GRANDE CHANCELLERIE DE LA PRINCIPAUTE DE    TRINIDAD,    27 WEST THIRTY-SIXTH STREET,    NEW YORK CITY, U. S. A.,    \"NEW YORK, _July_ 30, 1895.    _\"To His Excellency Mr. the Secretary of State of the Republic of the  United States of North America, Washington, D. C.:_    \"EXCELLENCY.--I have the honor to recall to your memory:    \"1. That in the course of the month of September, 1893, Baron  Harden-Hickey officially notified all the Powers of his taking  possession of the uninhabited island of Trinidad; and    \"2. That in course of January, 1894, he renewed to all these Powers the  official notification of the said taking of possession, and informed  them at the same time that from that date the land would be known  as 'Principality of Trinidad'; that he took the title of 'Prince of  Trinidad,' and would reign under the name of James I.    \"In consequence of these official notifications several Powers have  recognized the new Principality and its Prince, and at all events none  thought it necessary at that epoch to raise objections or formulate  opposition.    \"The press of the entire world has, on the other hand, often acquainted  readers with these facts, thus giving to them all possible publicity. In  consequence of the accomplishment of these various formalities, and  as the law of nations prescribes that 'derelict' territories belong to  whoever will take possession of them, and as the island of Trinidad,  which has been abandoned for years, certainly belongs to the aforesaid  category, his Serene Highness Prince James I was authorized to regard  his rights on the said island as perfectly valid and indisputable.    \"Nevertheless, your Excellency knows that recently, in spite of all  the legitimate rights of my august sovereign, an English war-ship  has disembarked at Trinidad a detachment of armed troops and taken  possession of the island in the name of England.    \"Following this assumption of territory, the Brazilian Government,  invoking a right of ancient Portuguese occupation (long ago outlawed),  has notified the English Government to surrender the island to Brazil.    \"I beg of your Excellency to ask of the Government of the United  States of North America to recognize the Principality of Trinidad as  an independent State, and to come to an understanding with the other  American Powers in order to guarantee its neutrality.    \"Thus the Government of the United States of North America will once  more accord its powerful assistance to the cause of right and of  justice, misunderstood by England and Brazil, put an end to a situation  which threatens to disturb the peace, re-establish concord between two  great States ready to appeal to arms, and affirm itself, moreover, as  the faithful interpreter of the Monroe Doctrine.    \"In the expectation of your reply please accept, Excellency, the  expression of my elevated consideration.    \"The Grand Chancellor, Secretary for Foreign Affairs,    \"COMTE DE LA BOISSIERE.\"    At that time Richard Olney was Secretary of State, and in his treatment  of the protest, and of the gentleman who wrote it, he fully upheld the  reputation he made while in office of lack of good manners. Saying he  was unable to read the handwriting in which the protest was written,  he disposed of it in a way that would suggest itself naturally to a  statesman and a gentleman. As a \"crank\" letter he turned it over to the  Washington correspondents. You can imagine what they did with it.    The day following the reporters in New York swept down upon the  chancellery and upon the Minister of Foreign Affairs. It was the \"silly  season\" in August, there was no real news in town, and the troubles of  De la Boissiere were allowed much space.    They laughed at him and at his king, at his chancellery, at his broken  English, at his \"grave and courtly manners,\" even at his clothes. But in  spite of the ridicule, between the lines you could read that to the man  himself it all was terribly real.    I had first heard of the island of Trinidad from two men I knew  who spent three months on it searching for the treasure, and when  Harden-Hickey proclaimed himself lord of the island, through the papers  I had carefully followed his fortunes. So, partly out of curiosity and  partly out of sympathy, I called at the chancellery.    I found it in a brownstone house, in a dirty neighborhood just west of  Seventh Avenue, and of where now stands the York Hotel. Three weeks ago  I revisited it and found it unchanged. At the time of my first visit,  on the jamb of the front door was pasted a piece of paper on which  was written in the handwriting of De la Boissiere: \"Chancellerie de la  Principaute de Trinidad.\"    The chancellery was not exactly in its proper setting. On its door-step  children of the tenements were playing dolls with clothes-pins; in the  street a huckster in raucous tones was offering wilted cabbages to women  in wrappers leaning from the fire escapes; the smells and the heat of  New York in midsummer rose from the asphalt. It was a far cry to the  wave-swept island off the coast of Brazil.    De la Boissiere received me with distrust. The morning papers had made  him man-shy; but, after a few \"Your Excellencies\" and a respectful  inquiry regarding \"His Royal Highness,\" his confidence revived. In the  situation he saw nothing humorous, not even in an announcement on the  wall which read: \"Sailings to Trinidad.\" Of these there were _two_; on  March 1, and on October 1. On the table were many copies of the  royal proclamation, the postage-stamps of the new government, the  thousand-franc bonds, and, in pasteboard boxes, the gold and red  enamelled crosses of the Order of Trinidad.    He talked to me frankly and fondly of Prince James. Indeed, I never  met any man who knew Harden-Hickey well who did not speak of him with  aggressive loyalty. If at his eccentricities they smiled, it was with  the smile of affection. It was easy to see De la Boissiere regarded him  not only with the affection of a friend, but with the devotion of a  true subject. In his manner he himself was courteous, gentle, and so  distinguished that I felt as though I were enjoying, on intimate terms,  an audience with one of the prime-ministers of Europe.    And he, on his part, after the ridicule of the morning papers, to have  any one with outward seriousness accept his high office and his king,  was, I believe, not ungrateful.    I told him I wished to visit Trinidad, and in that I was"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30293"],[0,"The Candy Maker's Guide (#7)"],[1,"the thickness of the red, cut in two and place one on  each side of the red, about two inches from it, roll, twist and pull out  the recognized thickness; when cold, snip in lengths.      CINNAMON STICKS.    Clear pink body with four narrow white stripes.      6 lbs. White Sugar.    2 lbs. Glucose.    Cinnamon Flavor.    3 pints water.    Cherry Paste Color.    PROCESS.--Bring the sugar, glucose and water to the crack and pour out;  cut off piece and pull it white: color the body light pink, add the  flavor, prepare the four stripes as before directed, lay them on the  clear sugar, equal distance apart, roll out in lengths and snip off when  cold.      CLOVE STICKS.    Almost transparent with a tinge of red, striped with white and red  stripes alternately.      8 lbs. Sugar.    2 lbs. Glucose.    3 pints water.    Cherry Paste Color.    Oil of Cloves.    PROCESS.--Boil the sugar, glucose and water to 300; pour on the oiled  slab; cut off small portion, divide it into two, color one deep red,  pull both stripes and lay them alternately on the solid sugar, form the  boil into a roll, bring down one end, usually the left end, to a point;  pull out in long lengths and twist; when cold snip with scissors to  size.      RASPBERRY STICKS.    Pulled white centre, cased with red and striped with six narrow white  stripes.      8 lbs. White Sugar    2 lbs. Glucose.    3 pints water.    Cherry Red Paste Color.    Raspberry Essence.    PROCESS.--Boil the sugar, glucose and water to crack 300; pour the batch  on plate; cut in half and color one half red, then flavor both halves  with essence, (raspberry and a little tartaric acid); pull one half over  the hook and cut off one third of it and lay it aside; put the other two  thirds in the centre of the red solid sugar and case it around; now lay  the remaining piece of pulled sugar in six lengths of equal thickness  and distances apart on the top of the cased boil; roll out the ball to  the required thickness, twist and snip off into lengths when cold.      TWISTED BARLEY SUGAR STICKS.    Hand Made.      8 lbs. White Sugar.    2 lbs. Glucose.    3 pints water.    Lemon Flavoring.    Saffron Color.    PROCESS.--Put the sugar and water in a clear, bright pan and bring to a  boil, then add the glucose: put on the lid for five minutes, continue  boiling in the usual way till it reaches crack 300; now add sufficient  coloring to tinge a golden color and pour the boil carefully over the  smooth slab, so that the sheet of sugar will not be more than the eighth  of an inch thick. When the sheet has partly set, cut it into strips one  inch wide and the whole length of the sheet with scissors. Let an  assistant take charge of the strips and twist them by taking hold of an  end in each hand and turn them in opposite directions, forming a spiral  column; when cold snip the required lengths and carefully weigh and  bottle. To make these goods the operators must be very quick in their  movements. The slab must be warm on which the sugar is poured, as the  thin sticks cool so fast and get brittle.      PEPPERMINT BULL'S EYES.    For cornered drops cut at angles, black with white stripes.      8 lbs. Brown Sugar.    2 lbs Glucose.    3 pints water.    Peppermint Flavor.    PROCESS.--The process is exactly the same as for peppermint stick, viz;  boil the sugar water and glucose to weak crack, 300; pour the boil on  oiled plate, flavor with peppermint and work well up; in a smaller pan  have two pounds of white sugar, with the usual proportion of cream of  tartar and water boiled to the same degree; pull this over the hook  until white and porous; remove it to the plate and work it down into  lengths about one inch thick; lay them longways on the solid boil, equal  distances apart; make the whole boil into a thick roll, bringing one end  down to a point; draw off as for one cent sticks, but thicker; then with  scissors snip them off in pieces about an inch long. Hold the scissors  in the right hand, the sugar in the left; every time you make a clip  turn the sugar half way round, so that the corners of each cushion will  be at opposite angles.      BULL'S EYES, (Various.)    The formula given for the different kinds of sugar sticks will answer  for the variety of bull's eyes. The process and ingredients are  precisely alike. The sticks may or may not be drawn out a little  thicker, according to the size of drop required. Cream of tartar may be  substituted for glucose in all recipes given for boiled goods. The sugar  is not boiled quite so high for hand goods or pulled sugar as it is for  machine drops; being a little lower it works better, keeps longer  pliable, and is less brittle when cold.      ROUND BALLS.      8 lbs. Sugar.    2 lbs. Glucose.    Color.    3 pints water.    Flavor.    PROCESS.--Boil the sugar, water and glucose in the usual way to weak  crack, say 300; pour the boil on the slab, color and flavor to taste;  work the batch up until stiffish, then roll the boil round, getting one  end down to a point as directed for sticks, pull it off in lengths of  about three feet and about one inch thick; cut in pieces with \"JACKSON  BALL CUTTER\" and roll round with the hand. An expert assistant is  necessary for this operation, as the balls must be shaped while hot and  kept on the move till cold.    [Illustration: JACKSON BALL CUTTERS.    This cut represents our Improved Ball Cutter, or Press, which cuts only  one size ball; the improvement consists of a finger bar, operated by a  cam, so that each time the handle is raised the fingers throw out the  balls from between the knives.

This Machine has two steel knives, and is regulated by a gauge, so that  it will cut Balls of any size.    Fig. 210 a.    Price, $5 00 ]    This general recipe will apply to all balls. For details of pulling,  striping, casing and variety the reader is referred to the various  processes given for sticks and bulls eyes. They are all made and  finished in this way. For small sizes, pull out the lengths thinner; for  large sizes, thicker.    To make the various striped balls nicely, requires practice and a good  deal of it. No amount of book learning will teach those who are quite  ignorant of sugar boiling; but at the same time if the reader has  mastered the simpler process at the beginning of the book, he is quite  capable of understanding this and working out his own ideas in this way;  but hand-made balls should not be attempted until the learner feels  confident he can manage a boil easily and quickly, because there is no  time to think after the sugar is on the slab. The manipulation must now  have been acquired to an extent so as to enable the operator to proceed  as if by instinct.      ROSE BUDS.      8 lbs. White Sugar.    2 pounds glucose.    5 or 6 drops Otto of Roses.    3 pints water.    Cherry Paste Color.    PROCESS.--Boil the sugar, glucose and water to the degree of crack 300,  pour on oiled slab, cut off about one third for pulling, color the  larger piece a deep red and flavor with otto of roses; pull the smaller  piece over the hook till white; spread out the larger piece, lay the  pulled sugar in the middle, casing carefully round, pass through small  acid drop rollers.    N.B.--Turn the boil on its edge every time you cut a piece for the  machine, in order to keep the pulled sugar as near the centre as  possible.      RIPE PEARS.      8 lbs Sugar.    2 lbs. Glucose.    3 pints water.    1 oz. Tartaric Acid.    Cherry Red.    Yellow Paste Color.    1/4 oz. Essence Pear.    PROCESS.--Melt the sugar in the water, add the glucose and boil to 305;  pour on slab, cut the batch into three equal parts, flavor with essence  of pear, together with a little acid, color one part deep red and one  deep yellow, pull the third portion over the hook and lay it between the  yellow and red pieces so that one side will be yellow and the other  bright red; cut off into convenient sizes and pass through large pear  drop rollers. These goods are sold either plain or crystalized.      BOILED SUGAR TOYS.    See our stock of clear toy moulds, list of which is mailed on  application. They may be had to turn out all kinds of figures, such as  dogs, cats, elephants, etc. They are very popular among the children and  sell well in certain districts, and show a handsome profit. The moulds  are generally made in two parts; they must be well oiled; the sugar  boiled as for drops. Fill the moulds full, and just before the whole  mass sets, pour as much of the sugar out as will run; this will leave  only a thin coating which cling to the sides of the shapes and will  easily come out when the mould is parted, then you have the figures  complete but hollow. Boiled sugar whistles are made exactly the same  way.      TO CRYSTALIZE BOILED SUGAR GOODS.    Several descriptions of boiled sugars are sold crystalized, which look  very pretty and stand exposure to the atmosphere better. The process is  very simple and may be done with little trouble. When the drops have  been made and set, break them up and sift them well in a coarse sieve,  now shake them over a pan which is boiling, so that they get damped by  steam, and throw them in a heap of crystal sugar; mix them well up, so  that the sugar adheres to the drops uniformly: now sift them out of the  sugar again and they will dry in a few minutes and be ready for packing.  Another method is, when the drops have been made and sifted, to have a  thin solution of gum or gelatine and shake it over them and rub them all  together till damp all over; now throw over them sufficient crystal  sugar to coat them and mix them up; when dry sift again and pack.    N.B.---When being crystalized the goods should be warm, not hot, or  they"]]]
