[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28601"],[0,"The Christian Foundation, Or, Scientific and Religious Journal, June, 1880 (#7)"],[1,"   Infidels, who are noted leaders in \"Free Thought,\" as it is termed, are  invariably men whose religious education was in the religious literature  of the old creeds of centuries gone by, or otherwise in the religious  literature of Roman Catholicism. They live in thought upon religious  matters centuries behind the times, but, in scientific thought, are too  well informed to adhere to their religious training. Such is the  philosophy of infidel making. Let a man be trained in the obsolete  religions of an hundred years or more ago, and otherwise well educated,  and he is, at once, an infidel. No man is to blame for setting his face  like a flint against old-fashioned Roman Catholicism, and high-toned  Calvinism, nor for repudiating Papal and clerical authority known in the  Spanish Inquisition with all its horrible, unscriptural and ungodly  barbarities. But why it is that the infidel's religious foot should set  away back yonder in the smoke of the dark ages, and his scientific foot  away down here with the railroad and telegraph, is rather difficult of  solution. It is rather amusing, since all well-educated American Catholics  condemn the Inquisition along with all the abominable cruelties of the  dark ages. And, as for Calvinism, there is not enough left for seed if it  was properly distributed--_it is old and thin._            \"EVEN NOW ARE THERE MANY ANTI-CHRISTS.\"      Col. Ingersoll says: \"He (Paine) knew that every abuse had been embalmed  in scripture, that every outrage was in partnership with some holy text.\"  If such was really true every rascal, scoundrel and villain should carry a  copy of the Bible. Do they? Are they in affinity with the Bible? Are they  even friendly to it? Things that are in affinity with each other are drawn  together. \"A fellow feeling makes us very kind.\" \"By their fruits ye shall  know them.\" \"Birds of a feather flock together.\"    Before the Bible went to the Sandwich Islands Col. Ingersoll would have  been hailed as a very proper object for a sumptuous feast. He would have  acted wisely in making his last will before starting, but now, since that  book has gone there which embalms every crime (?) he would find an asylum  of safety in which to repose his weary limbs. _How is this?_ Is every  outrage in partnership with some holy text? If so, the Bible would be just  one more reason for the continuance of cannibalism. The secret of Mr.  Ingersoll's tirade upon the Bible may be accounted for when we measure the  magnitude of his infidelity. It is no shallow sort of unbelief, but, on  the contrary, it is deep seated, and one with the infidelity of his  excelling predecessors. Ingersoll intends to have no superior in  unbelief--you know he is ambitious. Let us give you a little speech that  was made, by one of his particular friends and co-laborers in this unholy  crusade, at Geneva, in 1868. Here it is:    \"Brethren, I am come to announce unto you a new gospel, which must  penetrate to the very ends of the world. This gospel admits of no half  measures and hesitations. The old world must be destroyed and replaced by  a new one. The Lie must be stamped out and give way to truth.    \"It is our mission to destroy the _Lie_; and to effect this, we must begin  at the very commencement. Now the beginning of all those lies which have  ground down this poor world in slavery is God. For many hundred years  monarchs and priests have inoculated the hearts and minds of mankind with  this notion of a God ruling over the world. They have also invented for  the people the notion of another world, in which their God is to punish  with eternal torture (not a Bible term) those who have refused to obey  their degrading laws here on earth. This God is nothing but the  personification of absolute tyranny, and has been invented with a view of  either frightening or alluring nine-tenths of the human race into  submission to the remaining tenth. If there were really a God, surely he  would use that lightning which he holds in his hand to destroy those  thrones, to the steps of which mankind is chained. He would assuredly use  it to overthrow those altars where the truth is hidden by clouds of lying  incense. Tear out of your hearts the belief in the existence of God; for  as long as an atom of that silly superstition remains in your minds you  will never know what freedom is.\"    This has the genuine _Ingersoll ring_ upon the subject of \"_Liberty of  Man, Woman and Child._\" \"When you have got rid of this belief in this  priest-begotten God, and when, moreover, you are convinced that your  existence, and that of the surrounding world, is due to the  _conglomeration of atoms_, in accordance with the law of gravity and  attraction, then, and then only, you will have accomplished the first  steps toward liberty, and will experience less difficulty in ridding your  minds of that second lie which tyranny has invented.    \"The first lie is _God_. The second lie is _Right_. Might invented the  fiction of Right in order to insure and strengthen her reign; that Right  which she herself does not heed, and which only serves as a barrier  against any attacks which may be made by the trembling and stupid masses  of mankind.    \"_Might_, my friends, forms the sole ground-work of society. Might makes  and unmakes laws, and that might should be in the hands of the majority.  It should be in the possession of those nine-tenths of the human race  whose immense power has been rendered subservient to the remaining tenth  by means of that lying fiction of _Right_, before which you are accustomed  to bow your heads and to drop your arms. Once penetrated with a clear  conviction of _your own might_, you will be able to destroy this _mere  notion of right_.    \"And when you have freed your minds from the fear of a God, and from that  childish respect for _the fiction of Right_, then all the remaining chains  which bind you, and which are called _science, civilization, property,  marriage, morality and justice, will snap asunder like threads_.    \"Let your own happiness be your only law. But in order to get this law  recognized, and to bring about the proper relations which should exist  between the majority and minority of mankind, you must destroy everything  which exists in the shape of state or social organization. So educate  yourselves and your children that, when the great moment for constituting  the new world arrives, your eyes may not be blinded and deceived by the  falsehoods of the tyrants of throne and altar.    \"Our first work must be destruction and annihilation of everything as it  now exists. You must accustom yourselves to destroy everything, the good  with the bad; for if but an atom of this world remains the new will never  be created.    \"According to the priests' fables, in days of old, a deluge destroyed all  mankind, but their God especially saved Noah in order that the seeds of  tyranny and falsehoods might be perpetuated in the new world. When you  once begin your work of destruction, and when the floods of enslaved  masses of the people rise and engulph temples and palaces, then take heed  that no ark be allowed to rescue any atom of this old world which we  consecrate to destruction.\"    _A representative of the kingdom of darkness._    \"Destruction and misery are in their ways, and the way of peace they know  not.\"            WHAT IS TO BE THE RELIGION OF THE FUTURE.      \"Brahmanism has avoided the fatal mistake of Catholic and Protestant  philosophy by assuming an impersonal deity in three modes of  manifestation, while Christian thinkers have played around the logical  contradiction of one personality in three equal persons for fifteen  hundred years. We must utterly break with the idea of a personal God, and  accept that of one impersonal essence behind all phenomena.\" [Hartmann's  future religion.]    Must we do this? Is there any necessity for it? What have we to do with  \"the fatal mistake of Catholic and Protestant philosophy?\" It was a  _mistake_, that's all! \"Christian thinkers have played around the logical  contradiction of one personality in three equal persons for fifteen  hundred years.\" _Have they? 'Tis well!_ Christianity requires no man to  step into logical contradiction and stand there. They have done this \"for  fifteen hundred years.\" Well, it has been about that long since men, in  the prelude of the dark ages, began to speculate foolishly about the  subject of the Divine existence. There was a purer atmosphere in the first  centuries of the Christian era, in which primitive Christians enjoyed  better conceptions of the Divine Being, to which it is the privilege of  Christians to return. Is it the _only alternative_ \"to break with the idea  of a personal God, and accept that of one impersonal essence behind all  phenomena?\" _No!_ We Christians affirm nothing that can necessarily be  construed with the Catholic and Protestant \"mistake\" concerning the  _Trinity_, nor anything that can be construed with ultra Unitarianism,  which treats of our Lord and Savior simply as an extraordinarily inspired  man. Neither are we under any logical necessity to \"break with the idea of  a personal God,\" and form an alliance with Atheistic philosophy through  the adoption of the idea of a Pantheistic \"essence behind all phenomena.\"  Such speculative _nonsense_ may be the best that a mind can do while it is  in its own ignorance upon the subject of what it takes to constitute  personality, and while it is also surrounded with nothing but the darkness  of the dark ages, which has been the legitimate accompaniment of \"the  Catholic and Protestant _fatal mistake_,\" but it is not the best that an  intelligent mind, clothed with the sunlight of the gospel of Christ, and  intelligently educated upon the subject of _personality_ can do. _No!_ The  intelligently informed mind can stand upon the everlasting bed-rock of  truth, which has been raised to the highest mountain top of Christian"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28613"],[0,"Pioneers of Science (#7)"],[1," the moon.         So they ought. Any globe must show phases if it live nearer the sun       than we do and if we go round it, for we shall see varying amounts       of its illuminated half. The only answer that Copernicus could give       to this was that they might be difficult to see without extra       powers of sight, but he ventured to predict that the phases would       be seen if ever our powers of vision should be enhanced.    4. That if the earth moved, or even revolved on its own axis, a stone or  other dropped body ought to be left far behind.         This difficulty is not a real one, like the two last, and it is       based on an ignorance of the laws of mechanics, which had not at       that time been formulated. We know now that a ball dropped from a       high tower, so far from lagging, drops a minute trifle _in front_       of the foot of a perpendicular, because the top of the tower is       moving a trace faster than the bottom, by reason of the diurnal       rotation. But, ignoring this, a stone dropped from the lamp of a       railway carriage drops in the centre of the floor, whether the       carriage be moving steadily or standing still; a slant direction of       fall could only be detected if the carriage were being accelerated       or if the brake were applied. A body dropped from a moving carriage       shares the motion of the carriage, and starts with that as its       initial velocity. A ball dropped from a moving balloon does not       simply drop, but starts off in whatever direction the car was       moving, its motion being immediately modified by gravity, precisely       in the same way as that of a thrown ball is modified. This is,       indeed, the whole philosophy of throwing--to drop a ball from a       moving carriage. The carriage is the hand, and, to throw far, a run       is taken and the body is jerked forward; the arm is also moved as       rapidly as possible on the shoulder as pivot. The fore-arm can be       moved still faster, and the wrist-joint gives yet another motion:       the art of throwing is to bring all these to bear at the same       instant, and then just as they have all attained their maximum       velocity to let the ball go. It starts off with the initial       velocity thus imparted, and is abandoned to gravity. If the vehicle       were able to continue its motion steadily, as a balloon does, the       ball when let go from it would appear to the occupant simply to       drop; and it would strike the ground at a spot vertically under the       moving vehicle, though by no means vertically below the place where       it started. The resistance of the air makes observations of this       kind inaccurate, except when performed inside a carriage so that       the air shares in the motion. Otherwise a person could toss and       catch a ball out of a train window just as well as if he were       stationary; though to a spectator outside he would seem to be using       great skill to throw the ball in the parabola adapted to bring it       back to his hand.         The same circumstance enhances the apparent difficulty of the       circus rider's jumping feats. All he has to do is to jump up and       down on the horse; the forward motion which carries him through       hoops belongs to him by virtue of the motion of the horse, without       effort on his part.         Thus, then, it happens that a stone dropped sixteen feet on the       earth appears to fall straight down, although its real path in       space is a very flat trajectory of nineteen miles base and sixteen       feet height; nineteen miles being the distance traversed by the       earth every second in the course of its annual journey round the       sun.         No wonder that it was thought that bodies must be left behind if       the earth was subject to such terrific speed as this. All that       Copernicus could suggest on this head was that perhaps the       atmosphere might help to carry things forward, and enable them to       keep pace with the earth.    There were thus several outstanding physical difficulties in the way of  the acceptance of the Copernican theory, besides the Biblical  difficulty.    It was quite natural that the idea of the earth's motion should be  repugnant, and take a long time to sink into the minds of men; and as  scientific progress was vastly slower then than it is now, we find not  only all priests but even some astronomers one hundred years afterwards  still imagining the earth to be at rest. And among them was a very  eminent one, Tycho Brahe.    It is interesting to note, moreover, that the argument about the motion  of the earth being contrary to Scripture appealed not only to  ecclesiastics in those days, but to scientific men also; and Tycho  Brahe, being a man of great piety, and highly superstitious also, was so  much influenced by it, that he endeavoured to devise some scheme by  which the chief practical advantages of the Copernican system could be  retained, and yet the earth be kept still at the centre of the whole.  This was done by making all the celestial sphere, with stars and  everything, rotate round the earth once a day, as in the Ptolemaic  scheme; and then besides this making all the planets revolve round the  sun, and this to revolve round the earth. Such is the Tychonic system.    So far as _relative_ motion is concerned it comes to the same thing;  just as when you drop a book you may say either that the earth rises to  meet the book, or that the book falls to meet the earth. Or when a fly  buzzes round your head, you may say that you are revolving round the  fly. But the absurdity of making the whole gigantic system of sun and  planets and stars revolve round our insignificant earth was too great to  be swallowed by other astronomers after they had once had a taste of the  Copernican theory; and accordingly the Tychonic system died a speedy and  an easy death at the same time as its inventor.    Wherein then lay the magnitude of the man?--not in his theories, which  were puerile, but in his observations, which were magnificent. He was  the first observational astronomer, the founder of the splendid system  of practical astronomy which has culminated in the present Greenwich  Observatory.    [Illustration: FIG. 16.--Tychonic system showing the sun with all the  planets revolving round the earth.]    Up to Tycho the only astronomical measurements had been of the rudest  kind. Copernicus even improved upon what had gone before, with measuring  rules made with his own hands. Ptolemy's observations could never be  trusted to half a degree. Tycho introduced accuracy before undreamed of,  and though his measurements, reckoned by modern ideas, are of course  almost ludicrously rough (remember no such thing as a telescope or  microscope was then dreamed of), yet, estimated by the era in which they  were made, they are marvels of accuracy, and not a single mistake due  to carelessness has ever been detected in them. In fact they may be  depended on almost to minutes of arc, _i.e._ to sixtieths of a degree.    For certain purposes connected with the proper motion of stars they are  still appealed to, and they served as the certain and trustworthy data  for succeeding generations of theorists to work upon. It was long,  indeed, after Tycho's death before observations approaching in accuracy  to his were again made.    In every sense, therefore, he was a pioneer: let us proceed to trace his  history.    Born the eldest son of a noble family--\"as noble and ignorant as sixteen  undisputed quarterings could make them,\" as one of his biographers  says--in a period when, even more than at present, killing and hunting  were the only natural aristocratic pursuits, when all study was regarded  as something only fit for monks, and when science was looked at askance  as something unsavoury, useless, and semi-diabolic, there was little in  his introduction to the world urging him in the direction where his  genius lay. Of course he was destined for a soldier; but fortunately his  uncle, George Brahe, a more educated man than his father, having no son  of his own, was anxious to adopt him, and though not permitted to do so  for a time, succeeded in getting his way on the birth of a second son,  Steno--who, by the way, ultimately became Privy Councillor to the King  of Denmark.    Tycho's uncle gave him what he would never have got at home--a good  education; and ultimately put him to study law. At the age of thirteen  he entered the University of Copenhagen, and while there occurred the  determining influence of his life.    An eclipse of the sun in those days was not regarded with the  cold-blooded inquisitiveness or matter-of-fact apathy, according as  there is or is not anything to be learnt from it, with which such an  event is now regarded. Every occurrence in the heavens was then  believed to carry with it the destiny of nations and the fate of  individuals, and accordingly was of surpassing interest. Ever since the  time of Hipparchus it had been possible for some capable man here and  there to predict the occurrence of eclipses pretty closely. The thing is  not difficult. The prediction was not, indeed, to the minute and second,  as it is now; but the day could usually be hit upon pretty accurately  some time ahead, much as we now manage to hit upon the return of a  comet--barring accidents; and the hour could be predicted as the event  approached.    Well, the boy Tycho, among others, watched for this eclipse on August  21st, 1560; and when it appeared at its appointed time, every instinct  for the marvellous, dormant in his strong nature, awoke to strenuous  life, and he determined to understand for himself a science permitting  such wonderful possibilities of prediction. He was sent to Leipzig with  a tutor to go on with his study of law, but he seems to have done as  little law as possible: he spent all his money on books and"]]]
