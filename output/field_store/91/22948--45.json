Experiment 26.--Hold a porcelain dish or a plate in the flame of  a candle, or of a Bunsen burner with the openings at the bottom  closed. After a minute examine the deposit. It is carbon, i.e.  lamp- black or soot, which is a constituent of gas, or of the  candle. Open the valve at the base of the Bunsen burner, and hold  the deposit in the flame. Does the C gradually disappear? If so,  it has been burned to CO2. C + 2 O = CO2. Is C a combustible  element?    Experiment 27.--Ignite a splinter, and observe the combustion and  the smoke, if any. Try to collect some C in the same way as  before.    With plenty of O and high enough temperature, all the C is burned  to CO2, whether in gas, candle, or wood. CO2 is an invisible gas.  The porcelain, when held in the flame, cools the C below the  point at which it burns, called the kindling-point, and hence it  is deposited. The greater part of smoke is unburned carbon.    Experiment 28.--Hold an inverted dry t.t. or receiver over the  flame of a burning candle, and look for any moisture (H2O). What  two elements are shown by these experiments to exist in the  candle? The same two are found in wood and in gas. Experiment  29.--Put into a small Hessian crucible (Fig. 18) some pieces of  wood 2 or 3 cm long, cover with sand, and heat the crucible  strongly. When smoking stops, cool the crucible, remove the  contents, and examine the charcoal. The gases have been driven  off from the wood, and the greater part of what is left is C.    Experiment 30.--Put 1 g. of sugar into a porcelain crucible, and  heat till the sugar is black. C is left. See Experiment 5. Remove  the C with a strong solution of sodium hydrate (page 208).    41. Allotropic Forms.--Carbon is peculiar in that it occurs in at  least three allotropic, i.e. different, forms, all having  different properties. These are diamond, graphite, and amorphous  --not crystalline--carbon. The latter includes charcoal, lamp-  black, bone-black, gas carbon, coke, and mineral coal. All these  forms of C have one property in common; they burn in O at a high  temperature, forming CO2. This proves that each is the element C,  though it is often mixed with some impurities.    Allotropy, or allotropism, is the quality which an element often  has of appearing under various forms, with different properties.  The forms of C are a good illustration.    42. Diamond is the purest C; but even this in burning leaves a  little ash, showing that it is not quite pure. It is a rare  mineral, found in India, South Africa, and Brazil, and is the  hardest and most highly refractive to light of all minerals.  Boron is harder. [Footnote: B, not occurring free, is not a  mineral.] When heated in the electric arc, at very high  temperatures, diamond swells and turns black. 43. Graphite, or  Plumbago, is One of the Softest Minerals.--It is black and  infusible, and oxidizes only at very high temperatures, higher  than the diamond. It contains from 95 to 98 per cent C. Graphite  is found in the oldest rock formations, in the United States and  Siberia. It is artificially formed in the iron furnace. Graphite  is employed for crucibles where great heat is required, for a  lubricant, for making metal castings, and, mixed with clay, for  lead-pencils. It is often called black-lead.    44. Amorphous Carbon comprises the following varieties.    Charcoal is made by heating wood, for a long time, out of contact  with the air. The volatile gases are thus driven off from the  wood; what is left is C, and a small quantity of mineral matter  which remains as ash when the coal is burned.    45. Lamp-black is prepared as in Experiment 26, or by igniting  turpentine (C1OH16), naphtha, and various oils, and collecting  the C of the smoke. It is used for making printers' ink, India  ink, etc. A very pure variety is obtained from natural gas.    Bone-black, or animal charcoal, is obtained by distilling bones,  i.e. by heating them in retorts into which no air is admitted.  The C is the charred residue.    Gas Carbon is formed in the retorts of the gas-house. See page  182. It is used to some extent in electrical work.    46. Coke is the residue left after distilling soft coal. It is  tolerably pure carbon, with some ash and a little volatile  matter. It burns without flame. 47. Mineral Coal is fossilized  wood or other vegetable matter. Millions of years ago trees and  other vegetation covered the earth as they do to-day. In certain  places they slowly sank, together with the land, into the  interior of the earth, were covered with sand, rock, and water,  and heated from the earth's interior. A slow distillation took  place, which drove off some of the gases, and converted vegetable  matter into coal. All the coal dug from the earth represents  vegetable life of a former period. Millions of years were  required for the transformation; but the same change is in  progress now, where peat beds are forming from turf.    Coal is found in all countries, the largest beds being in the  United States. From the nature of its formation, coal varies much  in purity.    Anthracite, or hard coal, is purest in carbon, some varieties  having from 90 to 95 per cent. This represents most complete  distillation in the earth; i.e. the gases have mostly been driven  off. It is much used in New England.    48. Bituminous, or soft coal, crocks the hands, and burns rapidly  with much flame and smoke. The greater part of the coal in the  earth is bituminous. It represents incomplete distillation.  Hence, by artificially distilling it, illuminating gas is made.  See page 180. It is far less pure C than anthracite.    49. Cannel Coal is a variety of bituminous coal which can be  ignited like a candle. This is because so many of the gases are  still left, and it shows cannel to be less pure C than bituminous  coal.    50. Lignite, Peat, Turf, etc., are still less pure varieties of  C. Construct a table of the naturally occurring forms of this  element, in the order of their purity. Carbon forms the basis of  all vegetable and animal life; it is found in many rocks, mineral  oils, asphaltum, natural gas, and in the air as CO2.    51. C a Reducing Agent.    Experiment 31.--Put into a small ignition-tube a mixture of 4 or  5 g. of powdered copper oxide (CuO), with half its bulk of  powdered charcoal. Heat strongly for ten or fifteen minutes.  Examine the contents for metallic copper. With which element of  CuO has C united? The reaction may be written: Cu0 + C = CO + Cu.  Complete and explain.    A Reducing, or Deoxidizing, Agent is a substance which takes away  oxygen from a compound. C is the most common and important  reducing agent, being used for this purpose in smelting iron and  other ores, making water-gas, etc.    An Oxidizing Agent is a substance that gives up its O to a  reducing agent. What oxidizing agent in the above experiment?    52. C a Decolorizer.    Experiment 32.--Put 3 or 4 g. of bone-black into a receiver, and  add 10 or 15 cc.of cochineal solution. Shake this thoroughly,  covering the bottle with the hand. Then pour the whole on a  filter paper, and examine the filtrate. If all the color is not  removed, filter again. What property of C is shown by this  experiment? Any other coloring solution may be tried.    The decolorizing power of charcoal is an important  characteristic. Animal charcoal is used in large quantities for  decolorizing sugar. The coloring matter is taken out mechanically  by the C, there being no chemical action. 53. C a Disinfectant.    Experiment 33.--Repeat the previous experiment, adding a solution  of H2S3 i.e. hydrogen sulphide, in water, instead of cochineal  solution. See page 120. Note whether the bad odor is removed. If  not, repeat.    Charcoal has the property of absorbing large quantities of many  gases. Ill-smelling and noxious gases are condensed in the pores  of the C; O is taken in at the same time from the air, and these  gases are there oxidized and rendered odorless and harmless. For  this reason charcoal is much used in hospitals and sick-rooms, as  a disinfectant. This property of condensing O, as well as other  gases, is shown in the experiment below.    54. C an Absorber of Gases and a Retainer of Heat.    Experiment 34.--Put a piece of phosphorus of the size of a pea,  and well dried, on a thick paper. Cover it well with bone-black,  and look for combustion after a while. O has been condensed from  the air, absorbed by the C, and thus communicated to the P. Burn  all the P at last.    VALENCE.    55. The Symbols NaCl and MgCl2 differ in two ways.--What are  they? Let us see why the atom of Mg unites with two Cl atoms,  while that of Na takes but one. If the atoms of two elements  attract each other, there must be either a general attraction all  over their surfaces, or else some one or more points of  attraction. Suppose the latter to be true, each atom must have  one or more poles or bonds of attraction, like the poles of a  magnet. Different elements differ in their number of bonds. Na  has one, which may be written graphically Na-; Cl has one, -Cl.  When Na unites with Cl, the bonds of each element balance, as  follows: Na-Cl. The element Mg, however, has two such bonds, as  Mg= or -Mg-. When Mg unites with Cl, in order to balance, or  saturate, the bonds, it is evident that two atoms of Cl must be  used, as Cl-Mg-Cl, or MgCl2.    A compound or an element, in order to exist, must have no free  bonds. In organic chemistry the exceptions to this rule are very  numerous, and, in fact, we do not know that atoms have bonds at  all; but we can best explain the phenomena by supposing them, and  for a general statement we may say that there must be no free  bonds. In binaries the bonds of each element must balance.    56.

Now, I do not myself know  whether this does afford a ground or not, but I am willing to suppose  that it does. The question which then arises is: What is the principle  of inference by which we pass from past sunrises to future ones? The  answer given by Mill is that the inference depends upon the law of  causation. Let us suppose this to be true; then what is the reason for  believing in the law of causation? There are broadly three possible  answers: (1) that it is itself known _a priori_; (2) that it is a  postulate; (3) that it is an empirical generalisation from past  instances in which it has been found to hold. The theory that causation  is known _a priori_ cannot be definitely refuted, but it can be rendered  very unplausible by the mere process of formulating the law exactly, and  thereby showing that it is immensely more complicated and less obvious  than is generally supposed. The theory that causation is a postulate,  _i.e._ that it is something which we choose to assert although we know  that it is very likely false, is also incapable of refutation; but it is  plainly also incapable of justifying any use of the law in inference. We  are thus brought to the theory that the law is an empirical  generalisation, which is the view held by Mill.    But if so, how are empirical generalisations to be justified? The  evidence in their favour cannot be empirical, since we wish to argue  from what has been observed to what has not been observed, which can  only be done by means of some known relation of the observed and the  unobserved; but the unobserved, by definition, is not known empirically,  and therefore its relation to the observed, if known at all, must be  known independently of empirical evidence. Let us see what Mill says on  this subject.    According to Mill, the law of causation is proved by an admittedly  fallible process called \"induction by simple enumeration.\" This process,  he says, \"consists in ascribing the nature of general truths to all  propositions which are true in every instance that we happen to know  of.\"[8] As regards its fallibility, he asserts that \"the precariousness  of the method of simple enumeration is in an inverse ratio to the  largeness of the generalisation. The process is delusive and  insufficient, exactly in proportion as the subject-matter of the  observation is special and limited in extent. As the sphere widens, this  unscientific method becomes less and less liable to mislead; and the  most universal class of truths, the law of causation for instance, and  the principles of number and of geometry, are duly and satisfactorily  proved by that method alone, nor are they susceptible of any other  proof.\"[9]      [8] _Logic_, book iii., chapter iii., Sec. 2.      [9] Book iii., chapter xxi., Sec. 3.    In the above statement, there are two obvious lacunae: (1) How is the  method of simple enumeration itself justified? (2) What logical  principle, if any, covers the same ground as this method, without being  liable to its failures? Let us take the second question first.    A method of proof which, when used as directed, gives sometimes truth  and sometimes falsehood--as the method of simple enumeration does--is  obviously not a valid method, for validity demands invariable truth.  Thus, if simple enumeration is to be rendered valid, it must not be  stated as Mill states it. We shall have to say, at most, that the data  render the result _probable_. Causation holds, we shall say, in every  instance we have been able to test; therefore it _probably_ holds in  untested instances. There are terrible difficulties in the notion of  probability, but we may ignore them at present. We thus have what at  least _may_ be a logical principle, since it is without exception. If a  proposition is true in every instance that we happen to know of, and if  the instances are very numerous, then, we shall say, it becomes very  probable, on the data, that it will be true in any further instance.  This is not refuted by the fact that what we declare to be probable does  not always happen, for an event may be probable on the data and yet not  occur. It is, however, obviously capable of further analysis, and of  more exact statement. We shall have to say something like this: that  every instance of a proposition[10] being true increases the probability  of its being true in a fresh instance, and that a sufficient number of  favourable instances will, in the absence of instances to the contrary,  make the probability of the truth of a fresh instance approach  indefinitely near to certainty. Some such principle as this is required  if the method of simple enumeration is to be valid.      [10] Or rather a propositional function.    But this brings us to our other question, namely, how is our principle  known to be true? Obviously, since it is required to justify induction,  it cannot be proved by induction; since it goes beyond the empirical  data, it cannot be proved by them alone; since it is required to justify  all inferences from empirical data to what goes beyond them, it cannot  itself be even rendered in any degree probable by such data. Hence, _if_  it is known, it is not known by experience, but independently of  experience. I do not say that any such principle is known: I only say  that it is required to justify the inferences from experience which  empiricists allow, and that it cannot itself be justified  empirically.[11]      [11] The subject of causality and induction will be discussed again in    Lecture VIII.    A similar conclusion can be proved by similar arguments concerning any  other logical principle. Thus logical knowledge is not derivable from  experience alone, and the empiricist's philosophy can therefore not be  accepted in its entirety, in spite of its excellence in many matters  which lie outside logic.    Hegel and his followers widened the scope of logic in quite a different  way--a way which I believe to be fallacious, but which requires  discussion if only to show how their conception of logic differs from  the conception which I wish to advocate. In their writings, logic is  practically identical with metaphysics. In broad outline, the way this  came about is as follows. Hegel believed that, by means of _a priori_  reasoning, it could be shown that the world _must_ have various  important and interesting characteristics, since any world without these  characteristics would be impossible and self-contradictory. Thus what he  calls \"logic\" is an investigation of the nature of the universe, in so  far as this can be inferred merely from the principle that the universe  must be logically self-consistent. I do not myself believe that from  this principle alone anything of importance can be inferred as regards  the existing universe. But, however that may be, I should not regard  Hegel's reasoning, even if it were valid, as properly belonging to  logic: it would rather be an application of logic to the actual world.  Logic itself would be concerned rather with such questions as what  self-consistency is, which Hegel, so far as I know, does not discuss.  And though he criticises the traditional logic, and professes to replace  it by an improved logic of his own, there is some sense in which the  traditional logic, with all its faults, is uncritically and  unconsciously assumed throughout his reasoning. It is not in the  direction advocated by him, it seems to me, that the reform of logic is  to be sought, but by a more fundamental, more patient, and less  ambitious investigation into the presuppositions which his system shares  with those of most other philosophers.    The way in which, as it seems to me, Hegel's system assumes the ordinary  logic which it subsequently criticises, is exemplified by the general  conception of \"categories\" with which he operates throughout. This  conception is, I think, essentially a product of logical confusion, but  it seems in some way to stand for the conception of \"qualities of  Reality as a whole.\" Mr Bradley has worked out a theory according to  which, in all judgment, we are ascribing a predicate to Reality as a  whole; and this theory is derived from Hegel. Now the traditional logic  holds that every proposition ascribes a predicate to a subject, and from  this it easily follows that there can be only one subject, the Absolute,  for if there were two, the proposition that there were two would not  ascribe a predicate to either. Thus Hegel's doctrine, that philosophical  propositions must be of the form, \"the Absolute is such-and-such,\"  depends upon the traditional belief in the universality of the  subject-predicate form. This belief, being traditional, scarcely  self-conscious, and not supposed to be important, operates underground,  and is assumed in arguments which, like the refutation of relations,  appear at first sight such as to establish its truth. This is the most  important respect in which Hegel uncritically assumes the traditional  logic. Other less important respects--though important enough to be the  source of such essentially Hegelian conceptions as the \"concrete  universal\" and the \"union of identity in difference\"--will be found  where he explicitly deals with formal logic.[12]      [12] See the translation by H. S. Macran, _Hegel's Doctrine of Formal    Logic_, Oxford, 1912. Hegel's argument in this portion of his \"Logic\"    depends throughout upon confusing the \"is\" of predication, as in    \"Socrates is mortal,\" with the \"is\" of identity, as in \"Socrates is    the philosopher who drank the hemlock.\" Owing to this confusion, he    thinks that \"Socrates\" and \"mortal\" must be identical. Seeing that    they are different, he does not infer, as others would, that there is    a mistake somewhere, but that they exhibit \"identity in difference.\"  "]]]
