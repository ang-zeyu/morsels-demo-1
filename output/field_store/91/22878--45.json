The Brioche-stitch is simply--bring the wool forward, slip one; knit two  together.          A light Stitch for a Shawl.      Three-thread fleecy.--No. 10 needles.    Cast on any even number of stitches.--Bring the wool forward, knit two  together, alternately, to the end of the row. Every row is the same.          Star Pattern Shawl, in Two Colours.      Cast on four stitches in blue Zephyr wool, or four-thread fleecy.--No. 6  needles.    _First row_--bring the wool forward, knit one,--(these two stitches form  the increase, and therefore are _not_ to be _repeated_); bring the wool  forward, slip one; knit two, pass the slip-stitch over them.--Repeat the  same to the end of the row.    _Second row_--pearl knitting in claret.    _Third row_--the same as first,--in blue.    _Fourth row_--the same as second,--in claret.    Repeat these rows alternately, in blue and claret, until there are one  hundred and eighty stitches on the needle; cast off, and finish with a  netted fringe.    As the increasing adds an irregular stitch, some rows will have one, and  others two knitted stitches, at their commencement.          Barege Knitting for Shawls.      Commence with any number of stitches that may be divided by three.--No.  4 needles, finest _Lady Betty's_ wool.--Knit one plain row.    _Second row_--bring the wool forward, knit three; bring the wool  forward, knit three together, taking them off at the back.    _Third row_--pearl knitting.    _Fourth row_--bring the wool forward, knit three together, taking them  off at the back; bring the wool forward, knit three.    _Fifth row_--pearl knitting.    Repeat from the second row.    When a pattern, in one or more colours, is to be introduced, break off  the ground colour, and fasten on the colour next to be used, in the  following manner.--Having made a slip knot in the end of the wool, pass  it on the needle in the left hand: twist the end of the coloured wool  and that of the ground, together,--knit, in plain knitting, the  stitches required for the pattern, then fasten off, by making a loop,  and commence again with the ground colour,--fastening on again as above.  Any number of colours may thus be introduced, to form flowers or other  patterns, which, however, are always to be done in plain knitting.          A Shetland Knitted Scarf.      Commence with the pattern for the border, by casting on one hundred  stitches for the width of the scarf.--No. 7 needles, and four-thread  embroidery, or _Lady Betty's_ wool.    _First row_--knit two stitches together, four times; bring the wool  forward, knit one, eight times; knit two stitches together, four times;  pearl one.--Repeat to the end of the row.    _Second row_--pearl knitting.    _Third row_--plain knitting.    _Fourth row_--pearl knitting.    Repeat from the first row, until the pattern be about fourteen inches  deep. Commence the centre as follows:--working one row of pearl  knitting, before the pattern commences.    _First row_--bring the wool forward, slip one; knit one, pass the slip  stitch over it; knit one; pearl one.--Repeat to the end of the row.    _Second and following rows_--repeat the first,--every row being alike.    If the wool be split, it exactly imitates the Shetland wool. In  splitting, the wool will frequently break; but this is not important, as  by laying the ends contrariwise, and twisting them together, a few  stitches may be so knit, that the joins are not perceptible.    Both ends of the scarf are to be made alike, by reversing the knitting  of the border. They may be finished with a tied, knitted, or netted  fringe, of the same wool, without splitting, or of fine German wool.          Shetland Pattern for a Shawl.      This should be worked in _Lady Betty's_ wool, or four-thread embroidery  fleecy, with No. 6 or 8 needles.    Cast on any number of stitches that may be divided by six.    _First row_--bring the wool forward, knit one; bring the wool forward,  knit one;--slip one; knit two together, pass the slip-stitch over them;  knit one.    _Second row_--pearl knitting.    _Third row_--bring the wool forward, knit three; bring the wool forward,  slip one; knit two together, pass the slip-stitch over them.    _Fourth row_--pearl knitting.    _Fifth row_--knit one; slip one; knit two together, pass the slip-stitch  over them; knit one; bring the wool forward, knit one; bring the wool  forward.    _Sixth row_--pearl knitting.    _Seventh row_--slip one; knit two together, pass the slip-stitch over  them; bring the wool forward, knit three; bring the wool forward.    _Eighth row_--pearl knitting.    N.B. There are to be two plain stitches at the beginning and end of each  row, to form an edge.          Other Patterns for Shawls.      With fine Shetland, or _Lady Betty's_ wool, and No. 10 needles, most  beautiful shawls may be knitted from the Leaf and Trellis Pattern (page  36), Point Pattern (page 42), Scotch Pattern (page 44), or Lace Pattern  (page 47).          Double Diamond Stitch for a Quilt.      This is prettiest in stripes of about five inches in width, in any two  colours.    Cast on any number of stitches that can be divided by three, allowing  two over, for a stitch at each end of the row.    _First row_--plain knitting.    _Second row_--slip one;(a) bring the wool forward, slip one; knit two  together.--Repeat from (a).--Plain knit the last stitch.    _Third row_--slip one; knit one; the next stitch is a double stitch  (that is,--a stitch and a loop)--knit the stitch and slip the  loop;--continue to knit the stitch and slip the loop, to the end of the  row.    _Fourth row_--commence again, as at second row.    In every other _second_ row, there will be a double stitch after the  first one,--this is to be knitted without bringing the wool forward. All  the other stitches are to be knitted the same as before.    N.B. The last stitch of every row is to be knitted plain.          A Quilt.      This may be knitted as a Baby's Quilt, or it may be done in small  squares for a large Quilt.--Eight-thread Zephyr fleecy.--No. 6 needles.    Cast on any number of stitches that can be divided by three,--for a  square of six inches, say forty-five; for a Baby's Quilt, two hundred  and thirty-one.    _First row_--slip one; knit two, taken together in the front;(a) turn  the wool round the needle, and bring it again in front; slip one; knit  two together.--Repeat from (a).    Every row is alike.    N.B. The two last stitches at the end of the row are to be--the first  pearled,--the second knitted.          A light and warm Counterpane.      Six-thread fleecy in two colours--say blue and white; or, what is  preferable, German quilt wool--Needles No. 2, pointed at both ends.    Cast on any number of stitches in blue.    _First row_--plain knitting, turning the wool twice round the needle.    _Second row_--join on the white wool, knit one; knit two together,  turning the wool twice round the needle;--continue knitting two  together, and turning the wool twice round the needle, to the end of the  row, but plain knit the last stitch.    _Third row_--commence at the other end of the needle; knit two stitches  taken together in front, twisting the wool twice round the needle.    _Fourth row_--white,--knit one; knit two together, turning the wool  twice round the needle; knit one.    _Fifth row_--commence again as at third row.          Cross Stitch Pattern for a Quilt.      Two colours,--say gold colour and white.--No. 3 needles, pointed at both  ends.--Cast on any number of stitches.    _First row_--white,--knit one plain stitch, turning the wool twice round  the needle.--Repeat to the end of the row.    _Second row_--gold colour,--joining on the colour where the last row of  white commenced;--knit one plain stitch, turning the wool once round the  needle; knit the long stitch and the one that was knitted in the last  row together, turning the wool twice round the needle.--Repeat to the  end of the row,--when one stitch will be left, which is to be knitted  the same as the plain stitch at the beginning of the row.    _Third row_--white,--knit two together, taken in the front, turning the  wool twice round the needle.--Repeat to the end of the row.    _Fourth row_--gold colour,--the same as the third,--knitting one plain  stitch at the commencement of the row, and one plain stitch at the end  of the row, twisting the wool once round the needle.    _Fifth row_--white,--knit two together, twisting the wool twice round  the needle.--Repeat to the end of the row.    _Sixth row_--Commence again, as at second row.    It may be as well to remark, that two rows are knitted at the back, and  two at the front.          Another Quilt.      This should be knitted in stripes of six inches in width.--Cast on any  number of stitches that may be divided by three;--German quilt  wool.--No. 1 needles.    _First row_--bring the wool forward, slip one; knit two, pass the  slip-stitch over them.--Repeat.    _Second row_--pearl knitting.    _Third row_--knit two, before the pattern is commenced, that the holes  may come in a diagonal direction.    _Fourth row_--pearl knitting.    _Fifth row_--same as third.          A Quilt, or Couvre-Pied, in squares.      This may be worked with Zephyr fleecy,--No. 9 needles, each piece being  about three and a half inches square. Every square is worked in two  colours,--as blue and white; lilac and white; gold colour and white;  green and white; etc. These pieces are afterwards to be joined together,  arranging them, according to their several colours. Each square,  however, if preferred, may be worked the same. The following directions  are for a square in green and white:--    _First row_--bring"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33504"],[0,"Opticks (#7)"],[1,"ll, and found that whilst the two Boards and second Prism  remained unmoved, those places by turning the first Prism about its Axis  were changed perpetually. For when the lower part of the Light which  fell upon the second Board _de_ was cast through the hole _g_, it went  to a lower place M on the Wall and when the higher part of that Light  was cast through the same hole _g_, it went to a higher place N on the  Wall, and when any intermediate part of the Light was cast through that  hole, it went to some place on the Wall between M and N. The unchanged  Position of the holes in the Boards, made the Incidence of the Rays upon  the second Prism to be the same in all cases. And yet in that common  Incidence some of the Rays were more refracted, and others less. And  those were more refracted in this Prism, which by a greater Refraction  in the first Prism were more turned out of the way, and therefore for  their Constancy of being more refracted are deservedly called more  refrangible.    [Illustration: FIG. 18.]    [Illustration: FIG. 20.]    _Exper._ 7. At two holes made near one another in my Window-shut I  placed two Prisms, one at each, which might cast upon the opposite Wall  (after the manner of the third Experiment) two oblong coloured Images of  the Sun. And at a little distance from the Wall I placed a long slender  Paper with straight and parallel edges, and ordered the Prisms and Paper  so, that the red Colour of one Image might fall directly upon one half  of the Paper, and the violet Colour of the other Image upon the other  half of the same Paper; so that the Paper appeared of two Colours, red  and violet, much after the manner of the painted Paper in the first and  second Experiments. Then with a black Cloth I covered the Wall behind  the Paper, that no Light might be reflected from it to disturb the  Experiment, and viewing the Paper through a third Prism held parallel  to it, I saw that half of it which was illuminated by the violet Light  to be divided from the other half by a greater Refraction, especially  when I went a good way off from the Paper. For when I viewed it too near  at hand, the two halfs of the Paper did not appear fully divided from  one another, but seemed contiguous at one of their Angles like the  painted Paper in the first Experiment. Which also happened when the  Paper was too broad.    [Illustration: FIG. 19.]    Sometimes instead of the Paper I used a white Thred, and this appeared  through the Prism divided into two parallel Threds as is represented in  the nineteenth Figure, where DG denotes the Thred illuminated with  violet Light from D to E and with red Light from F to G, and _defg_ are  the parts of the Thred seen by Refraction. If one half of the Thred be  constantly illuminated with red, and the other half be illuminated with  all the Colours successively, (which may be done by causing one of the  Prisms to be turned about its Axis whilst the other remains unmoved)  this other half in viewing the Thred through the Prism, will appear in  a continual right Line with the first half when illuminated with red,  and begin to be a little divided from it when illuminated with Orange,  and remove farther from it when illuminated with yellow, and still  farther when with green, and farther when with blue, and go yet farther  off when illuminated with Indigo, and farthest when with deep violet.  Which plainly shews, that the Lights of several Colours are more and  more refrangible one than another, in this Order of their Colours, red,  orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, deep violet; and so proves as well  the first Proposition as the second.    I caused also the coloured Spectrums PT [in _Fig._ 17.] and MN made in a  dark Chamber by the Refractions of two Prisms to lie in a Right Line end  to end, as was described above in the fifth Experiment, and viewing them  through a third Prism held parallel to their Length, they appeared no  longer in a Right Line, but became broken from one another, as they are  represented at _pt_ and _mn_, the violet end _m_ of the Spectrum _mn_  being by a greater Refraction translated farther from its former Place  MT than the red end _t_ of the other Spectrum _pt_.    I farther caused those two Spectrums PT [in _Fig._ 20.] and MN to become  co-incident in an inverted Order of their Colours, the red end of each  falling on the violet end of the other, as they are represented in the  oblong Figure PTMN; and then viewing them through a Prism DH held  parallel to their Length, they appeared not co-incident, as when view'd  with the naked Eye, but in the form of two distinct Spectrums _pt_ and  _mn_ crossing one another in the middle after the manner of the Letter  X. Which shews that the red of the one Spectrum and violet of the other,  which were co-incident at PN and MT, being parted from one another by a  greater Refraction of the violet to _p_ and _m_ than of the red to _n_  and _t_, do differ in degrees of Refrangibility.    I illuminated also a little Circular Piece of white Paper all over with  the Lights of both Prisms intermixed, and when it was illuminated with  the red of one Spectrum, and deep violet of the other, so as by the  Mixture of those Colours to appear all over purple, I viewed the Paper,  first at a less distance, and then at a greater, through a third Prism;  and as I went from the Paper, the refracted Image thereof became more  and more divided by the unequal Refraction of the two mixed Colours, and  at length parted into two distinct Images, a red one and a violet one,  whereof the violet was farthest from the Paper, and therefore suffered  the greatest Refraction. And when that Prism at the Window, which cast  the violet on the Paper was taken away, the violet Image disappeared;  but when the other Prism was taken away the red vanished; which shews,  that these two Images were nothing else than the Lights of the two  Prisms, which had been intermixed on the purple Paper, but were parted  again by their unequal Refractions made in the third Prism, through  which the Paper was view'd. This also was observable, that if one of the  Prisms at the Window, suppose that which cast the violet on the Paper,  was turned about its Axis to make all the Colours in this order,  violet, indigo, blue, green, yellow, orange, red, fall successively on  the Paper from that Prism, the violet Image changed Colour accordingly,  turning successively to indigo, blue, green, yellow and red, and in  changing Colour came nearer and nearer to the red Image made by the  other Prism, until when it was also red both Images became fully  co-incident.    I placed also two Paper Circles very near one another, the one in the  red Light of one Prism, and the other in the violet Light of the other.  The Circles were each of them an Inch in diameter, and behind them the  Wall was dark, that the Experiment might not be disturbed by any Light  coming from thence. These Circles thus illuminated, I viewed through a  Prism, so held, that the Refraction might be made towards the red  Circle, and as I went from them they came nearer and nearer together,  and at length became co-incident; and afterwards when I went still  farther off, they parted again in a contrary Order, the violet by a  greater Refraction being carried beyond the red.    _Exper._ 8. In Summer, when the Sun's Light uses to be strongest, I  placed a Prism at the Hole of the Window-shut, as in the third  Experiment, yet so that its Axis might be parallel to the Axis of the  World, and at the opposite Wall in the Sun's refracted Light, I placed  an open Book. Then going six Feet and two Inches from the Book, I placed  there the above-mentioned Lens, by which the Light reflected from the  Book might be made to converge and meet again at the distance of six  Feet and two Inches behind the Lens, and there paint the Species of the  Book upon a Sheet of white Paper much after the manner of the second  Experiment. The Book and Lens being made fast, I noted the Place where  the Paper was, when the Letters of the Book, illuminated by the fullest  red Light of the Solar Image falling upon it, did cast their Species on  that Paper most distinctly: And then I stay'd till by the Motion of the  Sun, and consequent Motion of his Image on the Book, all the Colours  from that red to the middle of the blue pass'd over those Letters; and  when those Letters were illuminated by that blue, I noted again the  Place of the Paper when they cast their Species most distinctly upon it:  And I found that this last Place of the Paper was nearer to the Lens  than its former Place by about two Inches and an half, or two and three  quarters. So much sooner therefore did the Light in the violet end of  the Image by a greater Refraction converge and meet, than the Light in  the red end. But in trying this, the Chamber was as dark as I could make  it. For, if these Colours be diluted and weakned by the Mixture of any  adventitious Light, the distance between the Places of the Paper will  not be so great. This distance in the second Experiment, where the  Colours of natural Bodies were made use of, was but an Inch and an half,  by reason of the Imperfection of those Colours. Here in the Colours of  the Prism, which are manifestly more full, intense, and lively than  those of natural Bodies, the distance is two Inches and three quarters.  And were the Colours still more full, I question not but that the  distance would be considerably greater. For the coloured Light of the  Prism, by the interfering of the Circles described in the second Figure  of the fifth Experiment, and also by the Light of the very bright Clouds  next the Sun's Body intermixing with these Colours, and by the Light  scattered by the Inequalities in the Polish of the Prism, was so very  much compounded, that the Species which those faint and dark Colours,  the indigo and violet, cast upon the Paper were not distinct enough to  be well observed.    _Exper._ 9.
