Soon afterward good-byes were said, and the girl's anguish increased as  she saw how reluctant her father seemed to bid Adele farewell. To the  young all things are tragic, and this which had befallen seemed nothing  short of a calamity to Bee. At length, however, they were gone, and then  Doctor Raymond turned to his daughter with a smile:    \"Well, Beatrice, we are to have the house to ourselves, it appears. I  presume that you have some studies, or some way by which you can amuse  yourself for a few days. I shall be very busy for a time preparing  reports, and arranging my specimens for the university; after which I  shall be at liberty to make my little girl's acquaintance.\"    William Raymond did not mean to be cruel; but he was a scientist much  absorbed in his work. He did have a great deal before him. Perhaps too  he was not quite at ease with himself for the warmth which he had  discovered toward his niece; perhaps, too, there lurked in his heart a  faint feeling of disappointment that his daughter was not the lovely  girl who had left in place of this silent, sullen appearing maiden who  returned a passive:    \"Very well, father.\"    Poor Bee! She had studied butterflies, her father's specialty, on  purpose to surprise him. She had thought that he would let her be with  him when he unpacked the rare specimens which he had obtained abroad,  and she had pictured the delightful chats they would enjoy together.    The reality was so different from the anticipation that her heart  swelled with the injustice of the thing, and she wept until the fountain  of her tears was dry. The housekeeping which was to have been her  pleasure served now to distract her mind. She threw herself into it with  so much fervor as to extort a remonstrance from Aunt Fannie, the old  colored woman who was the head factotum of the kitchen.    \"You all jest a gwine to kill yerse'f,\" she said reprovingly. \"'Tain't  no mannah ob use to scrub an' scour twel a fly can't stan' up nowhar.  Take hit easy, Miss Bee.\"    \"It's all that I can do for father,\" responded Bee, and the old woman  was silenced.    So the days went by. Every morning she saw her father at breakfast, and  received his formal greeting as gracefully as she could. The meal over,  Doctor Raymond disappeared in his study to be seen no more until  evening. He was never a demonstrative man, and his reserve seemed like  indifference to his daughter. Beatrice pondered upon his unconcern until  she became possessed with the one idea that somehow, some way, she must  do something to attract his attention.    \"It's all because I'm not pretty,\" thought the unhappy child one morning  when this state of things had gone on for a week. \"I must do something  to make him like me; but what?\"    Listlessly she took up her butterfly book and turned the pages idly. All  at once her eye was caught by these words:    \"One of the most singular and interesting facts in the animal kingdom is  what has been styled mimicry. Certain colors and forms are possessed by  animals which adapt them to their surroundings in such wise that they  are in a greater or less degree secured from observation and attack....    \"A good illustration of this fact is found in the Disipsus Butterfly,  which belongs to a group which is not especially protected, but is often  the prey of insect-eating creatures. This butterfly has assumed almost  the exact color and markings of the milkweed butterfly, which is  distasteful to birds, and hence enjoys peculiar freedom from the attacks  of enemies. Because this adaption of one form to another evidently  serves the purpose of defense this phenomenon has been called  'protective mimicry.'\"    \"'Protective mimicry,'\" mused the girl thoughtfully, leaning back in her  chair and clasping her hands above her head. \"That means if an animal  wishes to defend himself from another he just puts on the form of one  that his enemy doesn't like. 'Actor bugs,' Professor Lawrence calls  them. If that can be done why couldn't any creature put on any form he  liked? Wouldn't it be funny if a girl could change her appearance every  morning just like she does her dress? I could get up then looking just  like Adele. Why!--\"    Bee sat up suddenly, startled by the idea which came to her.    \"Beatrice Raymond,\" she cried, \"you can do it. Why it's done every day.  Didn't Emma Drew come back from St. Louis with golden hair when she had  gone away with it black? Wasn't Mrs. Simpson's hair red, and then all at  once wasn't it black? And the girls are always doing things to their  complexions. Why, I can be just like Adele if I wish. Oh, why didn't I  think of it sooner? I've lost a whole week.\" And with that she jumped up  from the chair, went to the mirror, and surveyed herself critically:    \"I could not change my eyes,\" she mused, \"but I don't believe that would  matter. Adele's are sometimes so dark that they seem black. But oh  dear! My complexion is horrid, and my hair is so dark! They would have  to be changed. Now what is the way to do it?\"    At this moment Bee was in need of tender guidance from an older woman.  She was a warm-hearted, loving, undisciplined girl; prone to do things  on the impulse of the moment which she would afterward deeply regret.  She had brooded over the indifference of her father and his apparent  preference for her cousin until the matter had assumed gigantic  proportions. Had it not been for the unfortunate change of photographs,  and her father's consequent mistake, the question of looks would never  have bothered her. As it was, the idea that if she could make herself  like Adele, her father could not help but love her, filled her mind to  the exclusion of anything else, and she thought of nothing save how the  thing could be accomplished. Presently she turned from the glass and  went down stairs to the kitchen.    \"Aunt Fanny,\" she said to the negro woman, \"do you know of anything that  would make my skin white?\"    \"Lawsie, chile! What am de mattah wid yer skin? Hit am good ernuff,\"  answered Aunt Fanny.    \"But do you?\" persisted Bee. \"Because if you do, and will tell me, I  will give you my string of yellow beads. Do you know anything?\"    \"'Cose I does, honey,\" answered the darkey, her eyes glistening at the  mention of the beads. \"Habn't I larn'd all erbout yarbs?\"    \"Then please tell me,\" coaxed the girl.    \"Yer want hit like Miss Adele's?\" questioned the old woman shrewdly.    \"Yes,\" answered Bee eagerly.    \"All yer has ter do, Miss Bee, is to git jim'son--yer know jim'son weed,  honey?\"    \"Yes, yes,\" cried Bee impatiently. \"Go on.\"    \"Yer gits jim'son, an' makes a poultice ob de leabs. War dat ober night  on yer face, an' in de mawnin' yer'll be as fair as de lily ob de  valley. Miss Adele can't hole a candle to yer.\"    \"Are you sure, Aunt Fanny?\" questioned Bee gleefully.    \"'Cose I'se sure. What'd I be tellin' yer fer ef I ain't sure?\"    \"And could you make my hair yellow like Adele's?\"    \"No'm; I cain't do dat. Dere's a worman down in de town kin, but I  cain't. No'm; I kin do mos' anything, I reckon, but dat.\"    \"Do you mean Miss Harris, the hairdresser, Aunt Fanny?\" asked Bee with  sudden enlightenment.    \"Yes'um; she'll make yer hair yaller, er red, er anything yer wants  hit,\" returned Aunt Fanny pompously, proud to be able to give so much  information to her young mistress.    \"Thank you, thank you,\" cried Bee, springing up joyfully. \"I'll get the  beads now, and if everything comes out all right I'll give you something  nice.\"    She ran up to her room, and soon returned with the beads. Walnut Grove  was a few miles farther out on the turnpike than was her Uncle Henry's  place; consequently it was too far from the town to walk. Bee chafed at  the necessity of waiting until Joel could get the buggy ready, so  impatient was she to put her new idea into practice. It was brought  round at length, however, and soon she found herself entering the only  hair dressing shop that the little town afforded.    \"What can I do for you, Miss Raymond?\" asked the proprietress coming  forward.    \"Miss Harris, can you change the color of the hair?\" asked the girl  abruptly.    \"Certainly,\" answered Miss Harris, evidently surprised by the query.  \"Why?\"    \"Because I want you to change the color of mine,\" spoke Bee quickly.    Miss Harris hesitated.    \"Does your father know of it, Miss Raymond?\"    \"Why! he wishes it,\" declared Bee with sincerity.    \"Very well then. What color did you wish?\"    \"I want it sunny and yellow; with gold lights all through it,\" answered  Bee promptly. \"Can you do it?\"    \"Yes, Miss Raymond; but your complexion--\"    \"I know,\" interrupted Bee. \"It should be fair to go with it. Can you  help me about it?\"    \"No; I only do the hair. I don't know of any here who does treat the  skin. It's a small place, you know.\"    \"Yes;\" assented Bee. Silently she watched the deft movements of the  woman as she applied the bleach. It was done finally, and Bee found  herself the possessor of locks as yellow as her cousin's. She eyed the  result doubtfully.    \"I like my own best,\" was her mental comment. \"But if it pleases father  I don't mind.\"    \"You understand,\" said Miss Harris as the girl prepared to depart, \"the  application will have to be renewed as the hair grows. Otherwise it  would be dark at the roots while the ends would be yellow.\"    \"Will it?\" asked Bee in dismay. \"I thought that this was all there was  to it.\"    \"No. It takes time and patience to attain gold even in the hair.\" Miss  Harris laughed at her little joke. \"Whenever it needs touching up, come  in and we'll soon fix you up.\"    \"Thank you,\" said Beatrice as she left.    \"It's going to take every cent of this month's allowance,\" she mused as  she stopped at a milliner's and ordered a white chip hat with purple  pansies for trimming sent home, \"but it costs to be a beauty. One must  dress"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33434"],[0,"The Squirrels and other animals (#7)"],[1,"their lives in battle will tell you,  that this is really the case. In his first trial the young soldier will  perhaps be so terribly frightened that nothing but the certainty of  being disgraced prevents his running away. But after some years spent  amid dangers, the coward becomes by degrees a bold fellow, who can hear  bullets whistle around him, and see bright steel flash before his eyes,  if not with indifference, at least, with perfect coolness and  steadiness.    But what has all this about soldiers to do with the poor prisoners in  the oak tree? There does not appear to be much connexion between the  two subjects, certainly; but I was going to say that our _squirrels_  resembled _soldiers_ in one respect. I mean, that _they_ became rather  more courageous by being accustomed to live in continual danger. For  the first day or two after the chase, they were afraid to venture more  than a few yards from the nest; but they rambled further by degrees,  though, whenever they returned to the oak, they took care to stop in a  tree at a little distance, that they might see if the enemy was not  lying in ambush for them near the hole. In this manner many days  passed, and they were beginning to hope that the wild-cat had quite  left the neighbourhood, when they had a conversation with Leatherwing  about this dreadful animal.    It was really surprising what a vast deal of information this funny  little fellow had picked up; but, perhaps, as he said himself, his  having lived so much in towns and villages, where he could overhear the  conversation of Man, might partly account for his cleverness.    From him the squirrels learned that these terrible wild-cats were  formerly very common in the neighbouring forests,[7] but that for many  years they had been gradually diminishing in numbers, and it was now  almost certain that the fierce beast which had caused them so much  alarm, was the last of her race in that part of the country. Wild-cats  are always much larger than the tame animals, but this creature was one  of the largest that had ever been seen or heard of. She was really a  formidable beast, and since she had taken up her abode in the  neighbourhood, she had done a great deal of mischief to the farmers by  killing their poultry, and even their young lambs. She had often been  chased by the gamekeepers and others, but long experience had made her  so watchful and cunning, that she had always escaped with her life,  though she had sometimes smarted a little from a few shot penetrating  her skin. But her fur was so thick and close that small shot could not  injure her much, unless fired from a very short distance, and she took  care that her enemies should not approach too near.          [7] The wild-cat is now almost, if not quite extinct in England,        except in the northern parts. It is still, however, to be met        with in Scotland, Ireland, and Wales. But the numbers of these        animals that have been killed in different parts of the country        have no doubt been much over-rated, as it is well known that the        domestic cat will sometimes stray into the woods, bringing forth        its young there, living on birds and small quadrupeds, and        becoming a terrible destroyer of game. When, therefore, one of        these half-wild cats happens to resemble the true wild-cat in        colour, (which is an indistinct tabby,) it is at once pronounced        to be a specimen of that animal. But Mr. Bell, (who, however,        differs from almost all other naturalists on this point,)        considers that the native wild-cat of Britain is quite a distinct        species from the domestic cat, and that the latter does not owe        its origin to the wild animal at all, though from what country        the breed has been derived he is at a loss to determine.    Such dreadful tales did Leatherwing relate of the extraordinary cunning  and fierceness of this hideous animal! When he had finished, the  squirrels became so terrified that they ran and hid themselves in their  snug retreat, declaring to each other that they never should be happy  till they were sure that the monster had been killed. They were  particularly uneasy too about their young ones, who were now grown so  strong that they were able to leave the nest; but their parents never  allowed them to go out of their sight, or to ramble beyond the branches  of the oak.    One day Brush said to his partner, \"Well, this is miserable work! I  declare I have no peace night or day, but am always thinking or  dreaming about this horrid wild-cat; I almost wish I had never been  born, or at least, that I had been a water-rat, or, better still, that  curious fellow called a mole, that Leatherwing talked to me about  once.\"    \"And where does this mole live?\" said Mrs. Brush.    \"Why, he spends almost all his life under the ground, and though it  must be very dark and damp there, he is at least safe from being eaten  up by wild beasts. He makes famous long caverns, branching out from  each other and in one place he has a very comfortable nest, lined with  dry grass and leaves, and among the roots of some tree he makes what  Leatherwing called his fortress, because he always goes there when he  is frightened. And all these nice places are safe under the ground. Oh!  I really wish I was a mole! The wild-cat might come as soon as she  pleased, then.\"    \"I think she would scratch the earth up with her great claws, and pull  you out of your fortress, as you call it.\"    \"How could she? Why there are I don't know how many caverns, all  leading from the fortress, and I could easily escape by one or other of  them. Then I could dig through the earth a great deal faster than she  could, if I were a mole; for Leatherwing says, that his fore-feet are  amazingly large and strong. Oh! ten times stronger than mine! Then he  never goes to sleep much more in the winter than in the summer, for  when the ground is frozen hard, all he has to do is to dig down a  little deeper, till he finds the earth soft; so he never cares what  sort of weather it is, and he has no need to trouble himself about  laying up a store of provisions for the winter. Oh! it must be very  nice to be a mole!\"    \"I should be afraid that my eyes would be filled with dust and dirt,  when I was digging under the ground.\"    \"_Your_ great staring eyes would, I dare say, but the mole's are very  different. They are so small, and covered over with fur, that he is  sometimes thought to be quite blind.[8] For, as Leatherwing says,  people _are_ so stupid and ignorant! But I believe the mole's little  eyes are not often of much use to him, for he seldom comes out of his  caverns, and when he does it is at night. I think he would be much  wiser to keep _always_ under ground, and then he would be quite safe. I  asked old Leatherwing how the mole could find out his food, as he  always lives in the dark, and he said that his nose is more useful to  him than his eyes, for he can smell anything at a great distance.\"          [8] That acute observer, Aristotle, has been accused of        inaccuracy, in saying, that the mole is absolutely blind. It        has, however, been ascertained that in the South of Europe there        exists another species of mole, the eyelids of which are _totally        closed_, and it was probably this animal that fell under the        observation of Aristotle. The mole has never been found in any        part of Ireland.    \"And what can he find to eat under ground, I should like to know?\"    \"Horrible! I forgot all about that when I wished to be a mole. His  food, I can hardly bear even to talk about it! He lives almost entirely  on _worms_! Horrid, long, twining worms! Oh! I had rather be hunted by  the wild-cat every day, than eat such disgusting food as that. No, no,  I don't wish to change places with the mole now, I am sure.\"    So as Brush had neither the inclination nor the power to be transformed  into a worm-devourer, he was obliged to be content with his situation  as a _nut-cracker_.          CHAPTER VI.      Time passed rapidly on, and the autumn drew near. The young squirrels  were now become so strong and active, and so fond of scampering about,  that their parents could hardly prevent them from rambling away by  themselves much further than was safe for them. One morning Brush was  almost certain that he had seen their terrible enemy in a distant tree,  and as his children happened to be unusually frolicsome just then, and  determined to have their own way, he thought he would try to keep them  at home, by relating a little story which he had heard at different  times, from Leatherwing.    The old fellow said, that, one evening, as he was flying about in a  garden, he observed a very young lady sitting in a summer-house,  holding in her hand the smallest mouse he had ever seen, fastened by a  string and a leather collar round its neck. So, as the bat was of a  very inquisitive, prying disposition, he hung himself up to the ceiling  of the summer-house, determined to overhear the conversation that was  going on below. It appeared that the mouse was relating his adventures  to his mistress. Now to tell you the truth, this little history has no  connexion with the other parts of my tale; so if you are in a very  great hurry to get to the end of the book, you can skip it altogether,  but I hope you will not behave so rudely to a poor author, who has  really done his best to entertain his readers.    Leatherwing's tale was called--        SOME PASSAGES IN THE LIFE OF THE SMALLEST QUADRUPED IN THE      WORLD.[9]          [9] When this was written, I was not aware that there existed in        other countries a quadruped still more diminutive than our little        harvest-mouse. However, as \"Minimus\" declares that he was much        smaller than others of his species, the title of his history may        still be correct.    \"Don't push and squeeze so Tiney! you"]]]
