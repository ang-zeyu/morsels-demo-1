Now that the facts are set forth, let us, if possible, trace the cause.  In a horizontal tube, gravity no longer acts to determine the direction  which the insect will take. Is it to attack the partition on the right  or that on the left? How shall it decide? The more I look into the  matter, the more do my suspicions fall upon the atmospheric influence  which is felt through the two open ends. Of what does this influence  consist? Is it an effect of pressure, of hygrometry, of electrical  conditions, of properties that escape our coarser physical attunement?  He were a bold man who should undertake to decide. Are not we ourselves,  when the weather is about to alter, subject to subtle impressions,  to sensations which we are unable to explain? And yet this vague  sensitiveness to atmospheric changes would not be of much help to us in  circumstances similar to those of my anchorites. Imagine ourselves in  the darkness and the silence of a prison-cell, preceded and followed  by other similar cells. We possess implements wherewith to pierce the  walls; but where are we to strike to reach the final outlet and to reach  it with the least delay? Atmospheric influence would certainly never  guide us.    And yet it guides the insect. Feeble though it be, through the  multiplicity of partitions, it is exercised on one side more than on the  other, because the obstacles are fewer; and the insect, sensible to the  difference between those two uncertainties, unhesitatingly attacks the  partition which is nearer to the open air. Thus is decided the division  of the column into two converse sections, which accomplish the total  liberation with the least aggregate of work. In short, the Osmia and her  rivals 'feel' the free space. This is yet one more sensory faculty which  evolution might well have left us, for our greater advantage. As it has  not done so, are we then really, as many contend, the highest expression  of the progress accomplished, throughout the ages, by the first atom of  glair expanded into a cell?          CHAPTER 2. THE OSMIAE.    February has its sunny days, heralding spring, to which rude winter will  reluctantly yield place. In snug corners, among the rocks, the great  spurge of our district, the characias of the Greeks, the jusclo of the  Provencals, begins to lift its drooping inflorescence and discreetly  opens a few sombre flowers. Here the first Midges of the year will come  to slake their thirst. By the time that the tip of the stalks reaches  the perpendicular, the worst of the cold weather will be over.    Another eager one, the almond-tree, risking the loss of its fruit,  hastens to echo these preludes to the festival of the sun, preludes  which are too often treacherous. A few days of soft skies and it becomes  a glorious dome of white flowers, each twinkling with a roseate eye.  The country, which still lacks green, seems dotted everywhere with  white-satin pavilions. 'Twould be a callous heart indeed that could  resist the magic of this awakening.    The insect nation is represented at these rites by a few of its more  zealous members. There is first of all the Honey-bee, the sworn enemy  of strikes, who profits by the least lull of winter to find out if some  rosemary is not beginning to open somewhere near the hive. The droning  of the busy swarm fills the flowery vault, while a snow of petals falls  softly to the foot of the tree.    Together with the population of harvesters there mingles another, less  numerous, of mere drinkers, whose nesting-time has not yet begun.  This is the colony of the Osmiae, with their copper-coloured skin and  bright-red fleece. Two species have come hurrying up to take part in the  joys of the almond-tree: first, the Horned Osmia, clad in black velvet  on the head and breast and in red velvet on the abdomen; and, a little  later, the Three-horned Osmia, whose livery must be red and red only.  These are the first delegates despatched by the pollen-gleaners to  ascertain the state of the season and attend the festival of the early  blooms. 'Tis but a moment since they burst their cocoon, the winter  abode: they have left their retreats in the crevices of the old walls;  should the north wind blow and set the almond-tree shivering, they will  hasten to return to them. Hail to you, O my dear Osmiae, who yearly,  from the far end of the harmas (The piece of waste ground in which the  author studied his insects in their natural state. Cf. \"The Life of  the Fly\" by J. Henri Fabre, translated by Alexander Teixeira de Mattos:  chapter 1.--Translator's Note.), opposite snow-capped Ventoux (A  mountain in the Provencal Alps, near Carpentras and Serignan, 6,271  feet.--Translator's Note.), bring me the first tidings of the awakening  of the insect world! I am one of your friends; let us talk about you a  little.    Most of the Osmiae of my region have none of the industry of their  kinswomen of the brambles, that is to say, they do not themselves  prepare the dwelling destined for the laying. They want ready-made  lodgings, such as the old cells and old galleries of Anthophorae and  Chalicodomae. If these favourite haunts are lacking, then a hiding-place  in the wall, a round hole in some bit of wood, the tube of a reed, the  spiral of a dead Snail under a heap of stones are adopted, according to  the tastes of the several species. The retreat selected is divided into  chambers by partition-walls, after which the entrance to the dwelling  receives a massive seal. That is the sum-total of the building done.    For this plasterer's rather than mason's work, the Horned and the  Three-horned Osmia employ soft earth. This material is different from  the Mason-bee's cement, which will withstand wind and weather for many  years on an exposed pebble; it is a sort of dried mud, which turns  to pap on the addition of a drop of water. The Mason-bee gathers her  cementing-dust in the most frequented and driest portions of the road;  she wets it with a saliva which, in drying, gives it the consistency of  stone. The two Osmiae who are the almond-tree's early visitors are  no chemists: they know nothing of the making and mixing of hydraulic  mortar; they limit themselves to gathering natural soaked earth, mud in  short, which they allow to dry without any special preparation on their  part; and so they need deep and well-sheltered retreats, into which the  rain cannot penetrate, or the work would fall to pieces.    While exploiting, in friendly rivalry with the Three-horned Osmia, the  galleries which the Mason-bee of the Sheds good-naturedly surrenders to  both, Latreille's Osmia uses different materials for her partitions and  her doors. She chews the leaves of some mucilaginous plant, some mallow  perhaps, and then prepares a sort of green putty with which she builds  her partitions and finally closes the entrance to the dwelling. When  she settles in the spacious cells of the Masked Anthophora (Anthophora  personata, ILLIG.), the entrance to the gallery, which is wide enough to  admit one's finger, is closed with a voluminous plug of this vegetable  paste. On the earthy banks, hardened by the sun, the home is then  betrayed by the gaudy colour of the lid. It is as though the authorities  had closed the door and affixed to it their great seals of green wax.    So far then as their building-materials are concerned, the Osmiae whom  I have been able to observe are divided into two classes: one building  compartments with mud, the other with a green-tinted vegetable putty.  The first section includes the Horned Osmia and the Three-horned Osmia,  both so remarkable for the horny tubercles on their faces.    The great reed of the south, the Arundo donax, is often used, in the  country, for rough garden-shelters against the mistral or just for  fences. These reeds, the ends of which are chopped off to make them all  the same length, are planted perpendicularly in the earth. I have often  explored them in the hope of finding Osmia-nests. My search has very  seldom succeeded. The failure is easily explained. The partitions and  the closing-plug of the Horned and of the Three-horned Osmia are made,  as we have seen, of a sort of mud which water instantly reduces to pap.  With the upright position of the reeds, the stopper of the opening would  receive the rain and would become diluted; the ceilings of the storeys  would fall in and the family would perish by drowning. Therefore the  Osmia, who knew of these drawbacks before I did, refuses the reeds when  they are placed perpendicularly.    The same reed is used for a second purpose. We make canisses of it,  that is to say, hurdles, which, in spring, serve for the rearing of  silk-worms and, in autumn, for the drying of figs. At the end of April  and during May, which is the time when the Osmiae work, the canisses  are indoors, in the silk-worm nurseries, where the Bee cannot take  possession of them; in autumn, they are outside, exposing their layers  of figs and peeled peaches to the sun; but by that time the Osmiae have  long disappeared. If, however, during the spring, an old, disused hurdle  is left out of doors, in a horizontal position, the Three-horned Osmia  often takes possession of it and makes use of the two ends, where the  reeds lie truncated and open.    There are other quarters that suit the Three-horned Osmia, who is not  particular, it seems to me, and will make shift with any hiding-place,  so long as it has the requisite conditions of diameter, solidity,  sanitation and kindly darkness. The most original dwellings that I know  her to occupy are disused Snail-shells, especially the house of the  Common Snail (Helix aspersa). Let us go to the slope of the hills thick  with olive-trees and inspect the little supporting-walls which are  built of dry stones and face the south.

What is the skin? Parts directly beneath? What is shown?]    1. THE INTEGUMENT.--The skin is the outer covering of the body. The parts  directly beneath it are very sensitive, and require protection. This is  shown whenever by accident the skin is broken, pierced, or torn off, the  bared surface being very tender, and painful to the touch. Nature has  provided the body with a garment that is soft, pliable, close-fitting, and  very thin, and yet sufficiently strong to enable us to come in contact with  the objects that surround us, without inconvenience or suffering.    [Sidenote: 2. Microscopic examination? What is the cutis? The cuticle?  Their union? How separated? What further is said of the cuticle?]    2. THE STRUCTURE OF THE SKIN.--When examined with the aid of the  microscope, the skin is found to be made up of two layers--the outer and  the inner. The inner one is called the _cutis_, or true skin; the outer one  is the _epidermis_, or scarf-skin. The latter is also known as the  _cuticle_. These two layers are closely united, but they may be separated  from each other. This separation takes place whenever, from a burn, or  other cause, a blister is formed; a watery fluid is poured out between the  two layers, and lifts the epidermis from the true skin.    Of the two layers, the cuticle is the thinner in most parts of the body,  and has the appearance of a whitish membrane. It is tough and elastic, is  without feeling, and does {42} not bleed, when cut. Examine it more  closely, and we observe that it is composed of minute flat cells, closely  compacted, and arranged layer upon layer.    [Sidenote: 3. Wearing out of the cuticle? What then? Variety in thickness  of cuticle? How accounted for?]    3. The outer layer is constantly being worn out, and falls from the body in  the form of very fine scales. It is, also, continually forming anew on the  surface of the inner layer. Its thickness varies in different parts of the  body. Where exposed to use, it is thick, hard, and horn-like, as may be  seen on the soles of the feet, or on the palms of the hands, especially of  those who are accustomed to perform much manual labor. This is an admirable  provision for the increased protection of the sensitive parts below the  skin against all extraordinary exposure. Even the _liabilities_ of these  parts to injury, are thus kindly provided for by \"the Hand that made us.\"    [Sidenote: 4. Location and office of the cutis? What further is said of it?  Papillae? Touch?]    4. The cutis, or true skin, lies beneath the epidermis, and is its origin  and support. It is firm, dense, elastic, very sensitive, and is freely  supplied with blood-vessels. It is closely connected with the tissues below  it, but may be separated by means of a sharp instrument. The surface of the  cutis is not smooth, but is covered here and there with minute elevations,  called _papillae_. These are arranged in rows, along fine lines, or ridges,  such as those which mark the palm and fingers; their number is about 80 to  the square line (a line being one-twelfth of an inch). These _papillae_  contain the blood-vessels which carry the supply of blood needed by the  ever-wasting skin. They contain nerves also, and are largely concerned in  the sense of touch; hence they are particularly abundant where the touch is  most delicate, as at the ends of the fingers.    [Sidenote: 5. What are the nails and hair? The growth of the nail? The  rapidity of its growth? Accident to the nail?]    {43} [Illustration: Fig. 14.    _a, b._ THE ROOT OF A HAIR.    1, 2, 3. The skin forming the hair sac. 4. Sebaceous glands. 5. The hair  sac.    _c._ TRANSVERSE SECTION OF A HAIR.]    5. THE NAILS AND HAIR.--These are appendages of the skin, and although very  unlike the cuticle as it appears on the surface of the body, they are, in  reality, modified forms of that layer of the skin. The nail grows from a  fold of the cuticle at the root, and from the under surface. As fast as it  is formed, it is constantly being pushed outward. The rapidity of its  growth can be ascertained by filing a slight groove on its surface, and  noticing how the space between it and the root of the nail increases, in  the course of a few weeks. When the nail is removed by any accident, it  will be replaced by a new one, if the root be not injured.    [Sidenote: 6. How are the hairs produced? Difference in their length?]    6. The hairs are produced in a similar manner; the skin forming  depressions, or hair sacs, from the bottom of which they grow and are  nourished (Fig. 14). They are found, of greater or less length, on almost  all parts of the surface, except the palms of the hands and soles of the  feet. On certain parts of the body, they grow to great length; on other  parts they are so short, that they do not rise beyond the hair sac in which  they originate.    [Sidenote: 7. Root of the hair? Shaft? Firmness and softness of the hair?]    7. The bulb, or root, from which the hair arises, is lodged in a small  pouch, or depression in the skin. The shaft is the part which grows out  beyond the level of the skin. Its growth is altogether in one direction, in  length alone. The outer part of the hair is quite firm, while its {44}  interior is softer, and probably conveys the fluids by which it is  nourished. The hair is more glossy in health than at other times.    [Sidenote: 8. Office of the nail? Of the hair? Give the illustrations.]    8. The nail serves as a protection to the end of the finger, and also  enables us to grasp more firmly, and to pick up small objects. The hair,  too, is a protection to the parts it covers. On the head, it shields the  brain from extremes of heat and cold, and moderates the force of blows upon  the scalp. On the body, it is useful in affording a more extensive surface  for carrying off the perspiration.    [Sidenote: 9. On what does the complexion depend? Light and dark races?  Freckles?]    9. COMPLEXION.--In the deeper cells of the cuticle lies a pigment, or  coloring matter, consisting of minute colored grains. On this pigment  _complexion_ depends; and, according as it is present in less or greater  amount, occasions the difference of hue, that exists between the light and  dark races of men, and between the blonde and brunette of the white races.  Freckles are due to an irregular increase of coloring matter.    [Sidenote: 10. Influence of the sun? How illustrated? Jews?]    10. The sun has a powerful influence over the development of this pigment,  as is shown by the swarthy hue of those of the white race who have  colonized in tropical climates. It is also well illustrated by the fact,  that among the Jews who have settled in northern Europe, there are many who  are fair complexioned, while those residing in India, are as dark as the  Hindoos around them.    [Sidenote: 11. What is an Albino? Where are Albinos found?]    11. An Albino is a person who may be said to have no complexion; that is,  there is an entire absence of coloring matter from the skin, hair, and  _iris_ of the eye. This condition more frequently occurs among the dark  races, and in hot climates, although it has been observed in almost every  race and clime.    [Sidenote: 12. What are sebaceous glands? How do they act? Sebaceous glands  of the face? How do they act?]    12. SEBACEOUS GLANDS.--There are in the skin certain {45} small glands,  which produce an oily substance, called _sebaceous_ matter. These glands  are little rounded sacs, usually connected with the hair-bulbs; and upon  these bulbs, they empty their product of oil, which acts as a natural and  adequate dressing for the hair (4, Fig. 14). A portion of the sebaceous  matter passes out upon the surface, and prevents the cuticle from becoming  dry and hard. The glands situated upon the face and forehead, open directly  upon the skin. In these, the sebaceous matter is liable to collect, and  become too hard to flow off naturally.    [Sidenote: 13. Black points, called worms? Animalcules?
