Pay, pay! the devil! the devil!\" upon  which explosion of wrath, the native owner of the soil thought it  prudent to withdraw his immediate claims.    There was more, however, in the Doctor's action than mere indulgence of  wrath. He understood perfectly that the savage values only what he can  eat and wear, and that as he could not put the stones to either of these  uses, his demand for pay was an impudent one.    Enough has been said to give the reader an insight into Indian  character, to prepare his mind for events which are to follow, to convey  an idea of the influence of the Hudson's Bay Company, and to show on  what it was founded. The American Fur Companies will now be sketched,  and their mode of dealing with the Indians contrasted with that of the  British Company. The comparison will not be favorable; but should any  unfairness be suspected, a reference to Mr. Irving's _Bonneville_, will  show that the worthy Captain was forced to witness against his own  countrymen in his narrative of his hunting and trading adventures in the  Rocky Mountains.           *       *       *       *       *    The dissolution of the Pacific Fur Company, the refusal of the United  States Government to protect Mr. Astor in a second attempt to carry on a  commerce with the Indians west of the Rocky Mountains, and the  occupation of that country by British traders, had the effect to deter  individual enterprise from again attempting to establish commerce on the  Pacific coast. The people waited for the Government to take some steps  toward the encouragement of a trans-continental trade; the Government  beholding the lion (British) in the way, waited for the expiration of  the convention of 1818, in the Micawber-like hope that something would  \"turn up\" to settle the question of territorial sovereignty. The war of  1812 had been begun on the part of Great Britain, to secure the great  western territories to herself for the profits of the fur trade, almost  solely. Failing in this, she had been compelled, by the treaty of Ghent,  to restore to the United States all the places and forts captured during  that war. Yet the forts and trading posts in the west remained  practically in the possession of Great Britain; for her traders and fur  companies still roamed the country, excluding American trade, and  inciting (so the frontiers-men believed), the Indians to acts of blood  and horror.    Congress being importuned by the people of the West, finally, in 1815,  passed an act expelling British traders from American territory east of  the Rocky Mountains. Following the passage of this act the hunters and  trappers of the old North American Company, at the head of which Mr.  Astor still remained, began to range the country about the head waters  of the Mississippi and the upper Missouri. Also a few American traders  had ventured into the northern provinces of Mexico, previous to the  overthrow of the Spanish Government; and after that event, a thriving  trade grew up between St. Louis and Santa Fe.    At length, in 1823, Mr. W.H. Ashley, of St. Louis, a merchant for a long  time engaged in the fur trade on the Missouri and its tributaries,  determined to push a trading party up to or beyond the Rocky Mountains.  Following up the Platte River, Mr. Ashley proceeded at the head of a  large party with horses and merchandise, as far as the northern branch  of the Platte, called the Sweetwater. This he explored to its source,  situated in that remarkable depression in the Rocky Mountains, known as  the South Pass--the same which Fremont _discovered_ twenty years later,  during which twenty years it was annually traveled by trading parties,  and just prior to Fremont's discovery, by missionaries and emigrants  destined to Oregon. To Mr. Ashley also belongs the credit of having  first explored the head-waters of the Colorado, called the Green River,  afterwards a favorite rendezvous of the American Fur Companies. The  country about the South Pass proved to be an entirely new hunting  ground, and very rich in furs, as here many rivers take their rise,  whose head-waters furnished abundant beaver. Here Mr. Ashley spent the  summer, returning to St. Louis in the fall with a valuable collection of  skins.    In 1824, Mr. Ashley repeated the expedition, extending it this time  beyond Green River as far as Great Salt Lake, near which to the south he  discovered another smaller lake, which he named Lake Ashley, after  himself. On the shores of this lake he built a fort for trading with the  Indians, and leaving in it about one hundred men, returned to St. Louis  the second time with a large amount of furs. During the time the fort  was occupied by Mr. Ashley's men, a period of three years, more than one  hundred and eighty thousand dollars worth of furs were collected and  sent to St. Louis. In 1827, the fort, and all Mr. Ashley's interest in  the business, was sold to the Rocky Mountain Fur Company, at the head of  which were Jedediah Smith, William Sublette, and David Jackson, Sublette  being the leading spirit in the Company.    The custom of these enterprising traders, who had been in the mountains  since 1824, was to divide their force, each taking his command to a good  hunting ground, and returning at stated times to rendezvous, generally  appointed on the head-waters of Green River. Frequently the other fur  companies, (for there were other companies formed on the heels of  Ashley's enterprise,) learning of the place appointed for the yearly  rendezvous, brought their goods to the same resort, when an intense  rivalry was exhibited by the several traders as to which company should  soonest dispose of its goods, getting, of course, the largest amount of  furs from the trappers and Indians. So great was the competition in the  years between 1826 and 1829, when there were about six hundred American  trappers in and about the Rocky Mountains, besides those of the Hudson's  Bay Company, that it was death for a man of one company to dispose of  his furs to a rival association. Even a \"free trapper\"--that is, one not  indentured, but hunting upon certain terms of agreement concerning the  price of his furs and the cost of his outfit, only, dared not sell to  any other company than the one he had agreed with.    Jedediah Smith, of the Rocky Mountain Fur Company, during their first  year in the mountains, took a party of five trappers into Oregon, being  the first American, trader or other, to cross into that country since  the breaking up of Mr. Astor's establishment. He trapped on the  head-waters of the Snake River until autumn, when he fell in with a  party of Hudson's Bay trappers, and going with them to their post in the  Flathead country, wintered there.    Again, in 1826, Smith, Sublette, and Jackson, brought out a large number  of men to trap in the Snake River country, and entered into direct  competition with the Hudson's Bay Company, whom they opposed with hardly  a degree more of zeal than they competed with rival American traders:  this one extra degree being inspired by a \"spirit of '76\" toward  anything British.    After the Rocky Mountain Fur Company had extended its business by the  purchase of Mr. Ashley's interest, the partners determined to push their  enterprise to the Pacific coast, regardless of the opposition they were  likely to encounter from the Hudson's Bay traders. Accordingly, in the  spring of 1827, the Company was divided up into three parts, to be led  separately, by different routes, into the Indian Territory, nearer the  ocean.    Smith's route was from the Platte River, southwards to Santa Fe, thence  to the bay of San Francisco, and thence along the coast to the Columbia  River. His party were successful, and had arrived in the autumn of the  following year at the Umpqua River, about two hundred miles south of the  Columbia, in safety. Here one of those sudden reverses to which the  \"mountain-man\" is liable at any moment, overtook him. His party at this  time consisted of thirteen men, with their horses, and a collection of  furs valued at twenty thousand dollars. Arrived at the Umpqua, they  encamped for the night on its southern bank, unaware that the natives in  this vicinity (the Shastas) were more fierce and treacherous than the  indolent tribes of California, for whom, probably, they had a great  contempt. All went well until the following morning, the Indians hanging  about the camp, but apparently friendly. Smith had just breakfasted, and  was occupied in looking for a fording-place for the animals, being on a  raft, and having with him a little Englishman and one Indian. When they  were in the middle of the river the Indian snatched Smith's gun and  jumped into the water. At the same instant a yell from the camp, which  was in sight, proclaimed that it was attacked. Quick as thought Smith  snatched the Englishman's gun, and shot dead the Indian in the river.    To return to the camp was certain death. Already several of his men had  fallen; overpowered by numbers he could not hope that any would escape,  and nothing was left him but flight. He succeeded in getting to the  opposite shore with his raft before he could be intercepted, and fled  with his companion, on foot and with only one gun, and no provisions, to  the mountains that border the river. With great good fortune they were  enabled to pass through the remaining two hundred miles of their journey  without accident, though not without suffering, and reach Fort Vancouver  in a destitute condition, where they were kindly cared for.    Of the men left in camp, only two escaped. One man named Black defended  himself until he saw an opportunity for flight, when he escaped to the  cover of the woods, and finally to a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/39471"],[0,"Zoological Illustrations, Volume 1 (#7)"],[1," largest  however of these, the Great Black Woodpecker, is very rare; and even the  others are less frequently seen than formerly, from the gradual diminution  of our few remaining forests.    The present appears an undescribed species, and was sent from the Spanish  Main to E. Falkner, Esq. of Fairfield. I have since seen the male, which,  like many others of this genus, is distinguished by a patch of red below  the eye.    Total length, eight inches and a half; bill one inch long, blackish; front  and crown cinereous black; the hind head and nape crimson; a dusky whitish  line (beginning at the nostrils) includes the eye and ear-feathers; below  this on each side blackish, with longitudinal whitish dots, which in the  male is mixed near the bill with crimson; chin blackish, speckled with  white. The general plumage above is uniform tawny rufous brown, becoming  more olive on the rump. Under parts olivaceous yellow, crossed with  numerous close bands of blackish brown. Quills with the inner web black,  the margin pale yellow; shafts and outer web tawny; tail the same, the  shafts and outer half black, excepting the last pair, which have yellowish  shafts and dusky tips. Wings inside, pale orange. Legs and claws dusky  green.    Two or three other individuals have since fallen under my observation: the  male I saw at Mr. Leadbeater's, Animal Preserver, in Brewer-street, of  whose liberality and integrity in every way, I can bear the most  unqualified and cheerful testimony.           *       *       *       *       *      Pl. 15    [Illustration]    LICINIA Melite.           *       *       *       *       *    GENERIC CHARACTER.        _Antennae graciles; clava elongata, fusiformi, compressa.

D.           *       *       *       *       *    The remarkable size of the under wings in the male insects of this genus  will distinguish them even to a casual observer as forming a natural group.  They are all natives of South America, where I discovered nine species. The  females differ most strikingly, and have hitherto been mistaken by authors  not only for distinct species, but as belonging to different genera.    Their natural situation will be among the _Pieridae_, with whose general  habit they accord.    The female of this species resembles _Pap. Licinia_ of Cramer, except in  having a short black stigma in the middle of the anterior border of the  fore wings, pointing obliquely to the exterior margin. Cramer's insect,  however, is the female of another undescribed species in my cabinet.    The under side of the posterior wings in both sexes is the same.           *       *       *       *       *      Pl. 16    [Illustration]    ISMENE Oedipodea.           *       *       *       *       *    GENERIC CHARACTER.        _Antennae cylindraceae, juxta medium crassissimae, versus apicem      subulatae, articulis numerosis brevissimis pene detectis.

It is one of the many new and interesting subjects in entomology  discovered in Java by Dr. Horsfield; and by his kindness and liberality I  am enabled to add the figures of the caterpillar and chrysalis, which were  copied out of a fine series of drawings made in Java under his own eye:  they do not appear to differ in their formation from others of this family,  although the perfect insect possesses such striking and peculiar generic  characters; one of the many facts which prove the impossibility of making  the _Larvae_ a primary consideration in forming the genera of Lepidoptera.    This is a rare insect, I have therefore been obliged to leave the generic  character imperfect, as the dissection of the mouth, &c. would destroy the  specimen. The posterior margin in the wings of the male is sinuated; in the  female it is nearly straight; the underside of the wings in both sexes is  the same; the anterior pair reddish-brown, paler in the middle; the tip and  posterior margin whitish: inferior wings reddish-orange towards the inner  margin, with an obsolete central curved band of the same, and a black dot  at the base of the inferior wings. The head, palpi, and thorax are margined  with orange, less conspicuous in the female.    Our knowledge of the genus _Hesperia_ of Latreille (under which the present  insect would come) is little more than what was known of _Scarabaeus_  twenty years ago; nor has Fabricius even noticed one half of the species  figured by Cramer. The larva feeds on    GAERTNERA _Javensis_        _Foliis ovatis, obtuse-acuminatis, caule volubili ramosissimo, ramulis      diffusis, deflexis,_    a new species, discovered in Java by Dr. Horsfield, who has distinguished  it by the above specific character. He informs me the natives give it the  name of _Kakas-rambat_, which last word signifies twining or trailing. In  the inflorescence and fruit it differs not from _G. racemosa_.           *       *       *       *       *      Pl. 17    [Illustration]    BULIMUS zonatus.    _Zoned Bulimus._           *       *       *       *       *    GENERIC CHARACTER.--See Pl. 4.           *       *       *       *       *    SPECIFIC CHARACTER.        _B. testa laevi conica; spirae anfractibus quinque; ultimo aliquantulum      distorto; albis duabus fasciis ferrugineis inaequalibus; anfractu      basali rufo duabus albis fasciis; apertura alba._        Shell smooth, conic, of five volutions, the last somewhat distorted;      white, with two unequal ferrugineous bands; body whirl rufous, with two      white bands.
