I  have often been told that the Norway spruce was short-lived, and that it  became unkempt in age; but now that I have lived for ten years and more  beside a noble specimen, I know that the change from the upreaching push  of youth to the semi-drooping sedateness of maturity is only a taking on  of dignity. There stands on the home grounds of a true tree-lover in  Pennsylvania a Norway spruce that has been untouched by knife or  disaster since its planting many years ago. No pruning has shortened in  its \"leader\" or top, no foolish idea of \"trimming it up\" has been  allowed to deprive it of the very lowest branches, which, in  consequence, now sweep the ground in full perfection, while the  unchecked point of the tree still aspires upward forty feet above. A  beautiful object is this tree--perhaps the most beautiful of all the  conifers in my friend's great \"pinetum,\" with its scores of rare  species. Let me ask, then, those who would set this or any other tree of  evergreen about the home, to see to it that the young tree from the  nursery has all its lower branches intact, and that its top has never  been mutilated. With care, such specimens may be obtained and  successfully transplanted, and will grow in time to a lovely old age of  steady greenness.    The balsam fir is almost indistinguishable from the Norway spruce when  young, but soon grows apart from it in habit, and is hardly as  desirable, even though a native. It is rich in the true balsamic odor;  and this, again, is its destruction; for one \"spruce pillow\" may  destroy a half dozen trees!    [Illustration: Cones of the white spruce]    The white cedar, our common juniper, with its aromatic blue berries or  fruits, is perhaps the most familiar of all the native evergreens. It  comes to us of Pennsylvania all too freely at Christmas time, when the  tree of joy and gifts may mean, in the wholesale, sad forest  destruction. This juniper I have associated particularly with the  dogwood and the red-bud, to the bloom of which it supplies a most  perfect background in the favorite Conewago park, a purely natural  reservation of things beautiful along the Pennsylvania railroad. Its  lead-pencil sister, the red cedar, reaches our literary senses as  closely as does the pulp-making spruce!    I might write much of the rare introduced cypresses from Japan and  China, and of the peculiar variations that have been worked out by the  nurserymen among the native pines and firs; yet this would not be talk  of the trees of the open ground, but rather of the nursery and the park.  Also, if I had but seen them, there would be much to say about the  magnificent conifers of the great West, from the giant red-woods, or  sequoias, of the Mariposa grove in California to the richly varied pines  of the Rockies. But I can only suggest to my readers the intimate  consideration of all this great pine family, so peculiarly valuable to  mankind, and the use of some of the pines and spruces about the home for  the steady cheer of green they so fully provide.          Apples      Well do I remember one of the admonitions of my youth, brought upon me  by an attempt to take apple-blossoms from a tree in bloom because they  were beautiful. I was told that it was wrong to pluck for any purpose  the flowers of fruit trees, because the possible fruitage might thereby  be reduced. That is, feeding the eye was improper, but it was always in  order to conserve all the possibilities for another organ of the body.  In those days we had not learned that nature provides against  contingencies, and that not one-tenth of all the blossoms would be  needed to \"set\" as much fruit as the tree could possibly mature.    The apple, well called the king of fruits, is worthy of all admiration  as a fruit; but I do not see why that need interfere in the least with  its consideration as an object of beauty. On the contrary, such  consideration is all the better for the apple, which is not only most  desirable and pleasing in its relation to the dessert, the truly  celebrated American pie, the luscious dumpling of the housewife, and the  Italian's fruit-stand of our cities, but is at the same time a  benefaction to the eye and the sense of beauty, in tree, in blossom, and  in fruit.    It is of the esthetic value of the apple I would write, leaving its  supreme place in pomology unassailed. Look at the young apple tree in  the \"nursery row,\" where it has been growing a year since it was  \"budded\"--that is, mysteriously changed from the wild and untamed fruit  of nature to the special variety designed by the nurseryman. It is a  straight, shapely wand, in most varieties, though it is curious to find  that some apples, notably the favorite Rhode Island Greening, start in  promptly to be picturesquely crooked and twisty. As it grows and  branches under the cultivation and guidance of the orchardist, it  maintains a lusty, hearty aspect, its yellowish, reddish or brownish  twigs--again according to variety--spreading out to the sun and the air  freely. A decade passes, and the sparse showing of bloom that has  decorated it each spring gradually gives place to a great glory of  flowers. The tree is about to bear, and it assumes the character of  maturity; for while it grows on soberly for many years, there is now a  spreading, a sort of relaxation, very different from the vigorous  upshooting of its early youth. After a crop or two, the tree has become,  to the eye, the familiar orchard member, and it leans a little from the  blasts of winter, twists aside from the perpendicular, spreads  comfortably over a great expanse of ground, and settles down to its  long, useful, and truly beautiful life.    While the young orchard is trim and handsome, I confess to a greater  liking for the rugged old trees that have followed blossom with fruit in  unstinted profusion for a generation. There is a certain character of  sturdy good-will about these substantial stems that the clinging snows  only accentuate in winter. The framework of limb and twig is very  different from that of the other trees, and the twisty lines seem to  mean warmth and cheer, even against a frosty sky. And these old  veterans are house trees, too--they do not suggest the forest or the  broad expanse of nature, but, instead, the proximity of man and the  home, the comfortable summer afternoon under their copious leafage, the  great piles of ruddy-cheeked fruit in autumn.    [Illustration: An apple orchard in winter]    I need hardly say anything of the apple-blossoms, for those who read  these words are almost certain to have long appreciated their delicately  fragrant blush and white loveliness. The apricot and the cherry are the  first of the fruit trees to sing the spring song, and they cover  themselves with white, in advance of any sign of green leaves on their  twigs. The apple has an advantage; coming more deliberately, the little  pink buds are set amidst the soft greens of the opening foliage, and the  leaves and flowers expand together in their symphony of color and  fragrance. The grass has grown lush by this time, the dandelions are  punctuating it with gold, and everything is in the full riot of  exuberant springtime.    But there are apples and apples and apples. Even the plain orchard  gives us a difference in flowers, as well as in tree aspect. Notice the  trees this coming May; mark the flat, white flowers on one tree, the  cup-shaped, pink-veined blooms on another. Follow both through the  fruiting, and see whether the sweeter flower brings the more sugary  fruit. This fact ascertained, perhaps it may be followed up by  observation of the distinctive color of the twigs and young  branches--for there are wide differences in this respect, and the canny  tree-grower knows his pets afar.    Perhaps there is a \"crab\" in the old orchard, ready to give the greatest  burst of bloom--for the crab-apple flower is usually finer and more  fragrant than any other of the cultivated forms. It is an especial  refuge of the birds and the bees, you will find, and it invites them  with its rare fragrance and deeper blush, so that they may work all the  more earnestly at the pollination without which all this richness of  bloom would be ineffective in nature's reproductive scheme.    [Illustration: When the apple trees blossom]    This same crab-apple is soon to be, as its brilliant fruit matures, a  notable object of beauty, for few ornamental trees can vie with its  display of shining color. There was a great old crab right in the flower  garden of my boyhood home, amid quaint box-trees, snowballs and lilacs.  Lilies-of-the-valley flourished in its shadow, the delicate  bleeding-heart mingled with old-fashioned irises and peonies at its  feet. From early spring until mid-August the crab-apple held court of  beauty there--and an always hungry boy often found something in addition  to beauty in the red and yellow fruits that were acid but aromatic.    With a little attention, if one would plant crab-apples for their  loveliness of fruit hue and form, a fine contrast of color may be had;  for some varieties are perfect in clear yellow, against others in  deepest scarlet, bloom-covered with blue haze, and yet others which  carry all the colors from cream to crimson--the latter as the warm sun  paints deeper.    Why do we not plant more fruit trees for beauty? Not one of our familiar  fruits will fail us in this respect, if so considered. The apricot will  often have its white flowers open to match the purity of the last snow,  the cherry will follow with a burst of bloom, the apples and crab-apples  will continue the show, aided by plum and pear and peach, and the  quince--ah, there's a flower in a green enamel setting!--will close the  blooming-time. But the cherry fruits now redden in shining roundness,  the earlier apples throw rich gleams of color to the eye, and there is  chromatic beauty until frost bids the last"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2882"],[0,"The Legends of the Jews — Volume 4 (#7)"],[1,"uttered the complaint: \"Where are all the wondrous works which  God did for our fathers in this night, when he slew the first-born of  the Egyptians, and Israel went forth from slavery with joyous  hearts?\" God appeared unto him, and said: \"Thou who art  courageous enough to champion Israel, thou art worthy that Israel  should be saved for thy sake.\" (96)    An angel appeared, and Gideon begged him for a sign, that he  would achieve the deliverance of Israel. He excused his petition  with the precedent of Moses, the first prophet, who likewise has  asked for a sign. The angel bade him pour water on the rock, and  then gave him the choice of how he would have the water  transformed. Gideon desired to see one-half changed into blood,  and one-half into fire. Thus it happened. The blood and the fire  mingled with each other, yet the blood did not quench the fire, nor  did the fire dry out the blood. Encouraged by this and other signs,  (97) Gideon undertook to carry on the war against the Midianites  with a band of three hundred God-fearing men, and he was  successful. Of the enemy one hundred and twenty thousand  corpses covered the field, and all the rest fled precipitately. (98)    Gideon enjoyed the privilege of bringing salvation to Israel  because he was a good son. His old father feared to thresh his grain  on account of the Midianites, and Gideon once went out to him in  the field and said: \"Father, thou art too old to do this work; go thou  home, and I shall finish thy task for thee. If the Midianites should  surprise me out here, I can run away, which thou canst not do, on  account of thy age.\" (99)    The day on which Gideon gained his great victory was during the  Passover, and the cake of barley bread that turned the camp of the  enemy upside down, of which the Midianite dreamed, was a sign  that God would espouse the cause of His people to reward them  for bringing a cake of barley bread as an 'Omer offering. (100)    After God had favored Israel with great help through him, Gideon  had an ephod made. In the high priest's breastplate, Joseph was  represented among the twelve tribes by Ephraim alone, not by  Manasseh, too. To wipe out this slight upon his own tribe, Gideon  made an ephod bearing the name of Manasseh. He consecrated it  to God, but after his death homage was paid to it as an idol. (101)  In those days the Israelites were so addicted to the worship of  Beelzebub that they constantly carried small images of this god  with them in their pockets, and every now and then they were in  the habit of bringing the image forth and kissing it fervently. (102)  Of such idolaters were the vain and light fellows who helped  Abimelech, the son of Gideon by his concubine from Shechem, to  assassinate the other sons of his father. But God is just. As  Abimelech murdered his brothers upon a stone, so Abimelech  himself met his death through a millstone. It was proper, then, that  Jotham, in his parable, should compare Abimelech to a thorn-bush,  while he characterized his predecessors, Othniel, Deborah, and  Gideon, as an olive-tree, or a fig-tree, or a vine. This Jotham, the  youngest of the sons of Gideon, was more than a teller of parables.  He knew then that long afterward the Samaritans would claim  sanctity for Mount Gerizim, on account of the blessing pronounced  from it upon the tribe. For this reason he chose Gerizim from  which to hurl his curse upon Shechem and it inhabitants. (103)    The successor to Abimelech equalled, if he did not surpass, him in  wickedness. Jair erected an altar unto Baal, and on penalty of  death he forced the people to prostrate themselves before it. Only  seven men remained firm in the true faith, and refused to the last  to commit idolatry. Their names were Deuel, Abit Yisreel,  Jekuthiel, Shalom, Ashur, Jehonadab, and Shemiel. (104) They  said to Jair: \"We are mindful of the lessons given us by our  teachers and our mother Deborah. 'Take ye heed,' they said, 'that  your heart lead you not astray to the right or to the left. Day and  night ye shall devote yourselves to the study of the Torah.' Why,  then, dost thou seek to corrupt the people of the Lord, saying, 'Baal  is God, let us worship him'? If he really is what thou sayest, then  let him speak like a god, and we will pay him worship.\" For the  blasphemy they had uttered against Baal, Jair commanded that the  seven men be burnt. When his servants were about to carry out his  order, God sent the angel Nathaniel, the lord over the fire, and he  extinguished the fire though not before the servants of Jair were  consumed by it. Not only did the seven men escape the danger of  suffering death by fire, but the angel enabled them to flee  unnoticed, by striking all the people present with blindness. Then  the angel approached Jair, and said to him: \"Hear the words of the  Lord ere thou diest. I appointed thee as prince over my people, and  thou didst break My covenant, seduce My people, and seek to burn  My servants with fire, but they were animated and freed by the  living, the heavenly fire. As for thee, thou wilt die, and die by fire,  a fire in which thou wilt abide forever.\"    Thereupon the angel burnt him with a thousand men, whom he had  taken in the act of paying homage to Baal. (105)     JEPHTHAH    The first judge of any importance after Gideon was Jephthah. He,  too, fell short of being the ideal Jewish ruler. His father had  married a woman of another tribe, an unusual occurrence in a time  when a woman who left her tribe was held in contempt.(106)  Jephthah, the offspring of this union, had to bear the consequences  of his mother's irregular conduct. So many annoyances were put  upon him that he was forced to leave his home and settle in a  heathen district. (107)    At first Jephthah refused to accept the rulership which the people  offered him in an assembly at Mizpah, for he had not forgotten the  wrongs to which he had been subjected. In the end, however, he  yielded, and placed himself at the head of the people in the war  against Getal, the king of the Ammonites. At his departure, he  vowed before God to sacrifice to Him whatsoever came forth out  of the doors of his house to meet him when he returned a victor  from the war.    God was angry and said: \"So Jephthah has vowed to offer unto me  the first thing that shall meet him! If a dog were the first to meet  him, would a dog be sacrificed to me? Now shall the vow of  Jephthah be visited on his first-born, on his own offspring, yea, his  prayer shall be visited on his only daughter. But I assuredly shall  deliver my people, not for Jephthah's sake, but for the sake of the  prayers of Israel.\"    The first to meet him after his successful campaign was his  daughter Sheilah. Overwhelmed by anguish, the father cried out:  \"Rightly was the name Sheilah, the one who is demanded, given to  thee, that thou shouldst be offered up as a sacrifice. Who shall set  my heart in the balance and my soul as the weight, that I may stand  and see whether that which happened to me is joy or sorrow? But  because I opened my mouth to the Lord, and uttered a vow, I  cannot take it back.\" Then Sheilah spoke, saying: \"Why dost thou  grieve for my death, since the people was delivered? Dost thou not  remember what happened in the day of our forefathers, when the  father offered his son as a burnt offering, and the son did not  refuse, but consented gladly, and the offerer and the offered were  both full of joy? Therefore, do as thou hast spoken. But before I  die I will ask a favor of thee. Grant me that I may go with my  companions upon the mountains, sojourn among the hills, and  tread upon the rocks to shed my tears and deposit there the grief  for my lost youth. The trees of the field shall weep for me, and the  beasts of the field mourn for me. I do not grieve for my death, nor  because I have to yield up my life, but because when my father  vowed his heedless vow, he did not have me in mind. I fear,  therefore, that I may not be an acceptable sacrifice, and that my  death shall be for nothing.\" Sheilah and her companions went forth  and told her case to the sages of the people, but none of them  could give her any help. Then she went up to Mount Telag, where  the Lord appeared to her at night, saying unto her: \"I have closed  the mouth of the sages of my people in this generation, that they  cannot answer the daughter of Jephthah a word; that my vow be  fulfilled and nothing of what I have thought remain undone. I  know her to be wiser than her father, and all the wise men, and  now her soul shall be accepted at her request, and her death shall  be very precious before My face all the time.\" Sheilah began to  bewail her fate in these words: \"Hearken, ye mountains, to my  lamentations, and ye hills, to the tears of my eyes, and ye rocks,  testify to the weeping of my soul. My words will go up to heaven,  and my tears will be written in the firmament. I have not been  granted the joy of wedding, nor was the wreath of my betrothal  completed. I have not been decked with ornaments, nor have I  been scented with myrrh and with aromatic perfumes. I have not  been anointed with the oil that was prepared for me. Alas, O  mother, it was in vain thou didst give birth to me, the grave was  destined to be my bridal chamber. The oil thou didst prepare for  me will be spilled, and the white garments my mother sewed for  me, the moth will eat them; the bridal wreath my nurse wound for  me will wither, and my garments in blue and purple, the worms  will destroy them, and my companions will all their days lament  over me. And now, ye trees, incline your branches and weep over  my youth; ye beasts of the forest, come and trample upon my  virginity, for my years are cut off, and the days of my life grow old  in darkness.\" (108)    Her lamentations were of as little avail as her arguments with her  father. In vain she sought to prove to him from the Torah that the  law speaks"]]]
