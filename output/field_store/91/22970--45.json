A few examples have, it is true, been  found, but these are only a tithe of those known to have existed; while  of the great animals that strode along the shore, leaving tracks fifteen  inches long and a yard apart pressed deeply into the hard sand, not a  bone remains. The probability is that the strata containing their bones  lie out to sea, whither their bodies were carried by tides and currents,  and that we may never see more than the few fragments that were  scattered along the seaside.    That part of the Valley of the Connecticut wherein the footprints are  found seems to have been a long, narrow estuary running southward from  Turner's Falls, Mass., where the tracks are most abundant and most  clear. The topography was such that this estuary was subject to sudden  and great fluctuations of the water-level, large tracts of shore being  now left dry to bake in the sun, and again covered by turbid water which  deposited on the bottom a layer of mud. Over and over again this  happened, forming layer upon layer of what is now stone, sometimes the  lapse of time between the deposits being so short that the tracks of  the big Dinosaurs extend through several sheets of stone; while again  there was a period of drouth when the shore became so dry and firm as to  retain but a single shallow impression.    [Illustration: Fig. 7.--Footprints of Dinosaurs on the Brownstone of the  Connecticut Valley. _From a slab in the museum of Amherst College._]    Something of the wealth of animal life that roamed about this estuary  may be gathered from the number of different footprints recorded on the  sands, and these are so many and so varied that Professor Hitchcock in  two extensive reports enumerated over 150 species, representing various  groups of animals. One little point must, however, be borne in mind,  that mere size is no sure indication of differences in dealing with  reptiles, for these long-lived creatures grow almost continuously  throughout life, so that one animal even may have left his footprints  over and over in assorted sizes from one end of the valley to the other.    The slab shown in Fig. 7 is a remarkably fine example of these  Connecticut River footprints; it shows in relief forty-eight tracks of  the animal called Brontozoum sillimanium and six of a lesser species.  It was quarried near Middletown, in 1778, and for sixty years did duty  as a flagstone, fortunately with the face downwards. When taken up for  repairs the tracks were discovered, and later on the slab, which  measures three by five feet, was transferred to the museum of Amherst  College.    There is an interesting parallel between the history of footprints in  England and America, for they were noticed at about the same time, 1830,  in both countries; in each case the tracks were in rocks of Triassic  age, and, in both instances, the animals that made them have never been  found. In England, however, the tracks first found were those ascribed  to tortoises, though a little later Dinosaur footprints were discovered  in the same locality. Oddly enough these numerous tracks all run one  way, from west to east, as if the animals were migrating, or were  pursuing some well-known and customary route to their feeding grounds.    For some reason Triassic rocks are particularly rich in footprints; for  from strata of this same age in the Rhine Valley come those curious  examples so like the mark of a stubby hand that Dr. Kaup christened the  beast supposed to have made them _Cheirotherium_, beast with a hand,  suggesting that they had been made by some gigantic opossum. As the  tracks measure five by eight inches, it would have been rather a large  specimen, but the mammals had not then arisen, and it is generally  believed that the impressions were made by huge (for their kind)  salamander-like creatures, known as labyrinthodonts, whose remains are  found in the same strata.    Footprints may aid greatly in determining the attitude assumed by  extinct animals, and in this way they have been of great service in  furnishing proof that many of the Dinosaurs walked erect. The  impressions on the sands of the old Connecticut estuary may be said to  show this very plainly, but in England and Belgium is evidence still  more conclusive, in the shape of tracks ascribed to the Iguanodon. These  were made on soft soil into which the feet sank much more deeply than in  the Connecticut sands, and the casts made in the natural moulds show the  impression of toes very clearly. If the animals had walked flat-footed,  as we do, the prints of the toes would have been followed by a long heel  mark, but such is not the case; there are the sharply defined marks of  the toes and nothing more, showing plainly that the Iguanodons walked,  like birds, on the toes alone. More than this, had these Dinosaurs  dragged their tails there would have been a continuous furrow between  the footprints; but nothing of this sort is to be found; on the  contrary, a fine series of tracks, uncovered at Hastings, England, made  by several individuals and running for seventy-five feet, shows  footprints only. Hence it may be fairly concluded that these great  creatures carried their tails clear of the ground, as shown in the  picture of _Thespesius_, the weight of the tail counterbalancing that of  the body. Where crocodilians or some of the short-limbed Dinosaurs have  crept along there is, as we should expect, a continuous furrow between  the imprints of the feet. This is what footprints tell us when their  message is read aright; when improperly translated they only add to the  enormous bulk of our ignorance.    Some years ago we were treated to accounts of wonderful footprints in  the rock of the prison-yard at Carson City, Nev., which, according to  the papers, not only showed that men existed at a much earlier period  than the scientific supposed, but that they were men of giant stature.  This was clearly demonstrated by the footprints, for they were such as  _might_ have been made by huge moccasined feet, and this was all that  was necessary for the conclusion that they _were_ made by just such  feet. For it is a curious fact that the majority of mankind seem to  prefer any explanation other than the most simple and natural,  particularly in the case of fossils, and are always looking for a  primitive race of gigantic men.    Bones of the Mastodon and Mammoth have again and again been eagerly  accepted as those of giants; a salamander was brought forward as  evidence of the deluge (_homo diluvii testis_); ammonites and their  allies pose as fossil snakes, and the \"petrified man\" flourishes  perennially. However, in this case the prints were recognized by  naturalists as having most probably been made by some great ground  sloth, such as the Mylodon or Morotherium, these animals, though  belonging to a group whose headquarters were in Patagonia, having  extended their range as far north as Oregon. That the tracks seemed to  have been made by a biped, rather than a quadruped, was due to the fact  that the prints of the hind feet fell upon and obliterated the marks of  the fore. Still, a little observation showed that here and there prints  of the fore feet were to be seen, and on one spot were indications of a  struggle between two of the big beasts. The mud, or rather the stone  that had been mud, bears the imprints of opposing feet, one set deeper  at the toes, the other at the heels, as if one animal had pushed and the  other resisted. In the rock, too, are broad depressions bearing the  marks of coarse hair, where one creature had apparently sat on its  haunches in order to use its fore limbs to the best advantage. Other  footprints there are in this prison-yard; the great round \"spoor\" of the  mammoth, the hoofs of a deer, and the paws of a wolf(?), indicating that  hereabout was some pool where all these creatures came to drink. More  than this, we learn that when these prints were made, or shortly after,  a strong wind blew from the southeast, for on that face of the ridges  bounding the margin of each big footprint, we find sand that lodged  against the squeezed-up mud and stuck there to serve as a perpetual  record of the direction of the wind.      _REFERENCES_    _Almost every museum has some specimen of the Connecticut Valley  footprints, but the largest and finest collections are in the museums of  Amherst College, Mass., and Yale University, although, owing to lack of  room, only a few of the Yale specimens are on exhibition. The collection  at Amherst comprises most of the types described by Professor E.  Hitchcock in his \"Ichnology of New England,\" a work in two fully  illustrated quarto volumes. Other footprints are described and figured  by Dr. J. Deane in \"Ichnographs from the Sandstone of the Connecticut  River.\"_    [Illustration: Fig. 8.--The Track of a Three-toed Dinosaur.]          IV    RULERS OF THE ANCIENT SEAS         \"_A time there was when the universe was darkness and water,       wherein certain animals of frightful and compound mien were       generated.

But his efforts were vain; the detective's strength was equal to his  suavity.    \"Don't hurt yourself, young man,\" he said, \"but take my advice, and  quietly give up the letter.\"    \"I have not got it.\"    \"Very well; see, you reduce me to painful extremities. If you persist  in being so obstinate, I shall call two policemen, who will take you by  each arm, and escort you to the commissary of police; and, once there, I  shall be under the painful necessity of searching your pockets, whether  you will or not.\"    Cavaillon was devoted to Prosper, and willing to make any sacrifice  in his behalf; but he clearly saw that it was worse than useless to  struggle any longer, as he would have no time to destroy the note. To  deliver it under force was no betrayal; but he cursed his powerlessness,  and almost wept with rage.    \"I am in your power,\" he said, and then suddenly drew from his  pocket-book the unlucky note, and gave it to the detective.    Fanferlot trembled with pleasure as he unfolded the paper; yet, faithful  to his habits of fastidious politeness, before reading it, he bowed to  Cavaillon, and said:    \"You will permit me, will you not, monsieur?\" Then he read as follows:      \"DEAR NINA--If you love me, follow my instructions instantly, without  a moment's hesitation, without asking any questions. On the receipt of  this note, take everything you have in the house, absolutely everything,  and establish yourself in furnished rooms at the other end of Paris. Do  not appear in public, but conceal yourself as much as possible. My life  may depend on your obedience.    \"I am accused of an immense robbery, and am about to be arrested. Take  with you five hundred francs which you will find in the secretary.    \"Leave your address with Cavaillon, who will explain what I have not  time to tell. Be hopeful, whatever happens. Good-by. PROSPER.\"      Had Cavaillon been less bewildered, he would have seen blank  disappointment depicted on the detective's face after the perusal of the  note.    Fanferlot had cherished the hope that he was about to possess a very  important document, which would clearly prove the guilt or innocence of  Prosper; whereas he had only seized a love-letter written by a man who  was evidently more anxious about the welfare of the woman he loved than  about his own.    Vainly did he puzzle over the letter, hoping to discover some hidden  meaning; twist the words as he would, they proved nothing for or against  the writer.    The two words \"absolutely everything\" were underscored, it is true; but  they could be interpreted in so many ways.    The detective, however, determined not to drop the matter here.    \"This Mme. Nina Gypsy is doubtless a friend of M. Prosper Bertomy?\"    \"She is his particular friend.\"    \"Ah, I understand; and she lives here at No. 39?\"    \"You know it well enough, as you saw me go in there.\"    \"I suspected it to be the house, monsieur; now tell me whether the  apartments she occupies are rented in her name.\"    \"No. Prosper rents them.\"    \"Exactly; and on which floor, if you please?\"    \"On the first.\"    During this colloquy, Fanferlot had folded up the note, and slipped it  into his pocket.    \"A thousand thanks, monsieur, for the information; and, in return, I  will relieve you of the trouble of executing your commission.\"    \"Monsieur!\"    \"Yes: with your permission, I will myself take this note to Mme. Nina  Gypsy.\"    Cavaillon began to remonstrate; but Fanferlot cut him short by saying:    \"I will also venture to give you a piece of advice. Return quietly to  your business, and have nothing more to do with this affair.\"    \"But Prosper is a good friend of mine, and has saved me from ruin more  than once.\"    \"Only the more reason for your keeping quiet. You cannot be of the  slightest assistance to him, and I can tell you that you may be of  great injury. As you are known to be his devoted friend, of course your  absence at this time will be remarked upon. Any steps that you take in  this matter will receive the worst interpretation.\"    \"Prosper is innocent, I am sure.\"    Fanferlot was of the same opinion, but he had no idea of betraying his  private thoughts; and yet for the success of his investigations it was  necessary to impress the importance of prudence and discretion upon the  young man. He would have told him to keep silent concerning what had  passed between them, but he dared not.    \"What you say may be true,\" he said. \"I hope it is, for the sake of M.  Bertomy, and on your own account too; for, if he is guilty, you will  certainly be very much annoyed, and perhaps suspected of complicity, as  you are well known to be intimate with him.\"    Cavaillon was overcome.    \"Now you had best take my advice, monsieur, and return to your business,  and--. Good-morning, monsieur.\"    The poor fellow obeyed. Slowly and with swelling heart he returned  to the Rue Notre Dame de Lorette. He asked himself how he could serve  Prosper, warn Mme. Gypsy, and, above all, have his revenge upon this  odious detective, who had just made him suffer cruel humiliation.    He had no sooner turned the corner of the street, than Fanferlot entered  No. 39, gave his name to the porter as Prosper Bertomy, went upstairs,  and knocked at the first door he came to.    It was opened by a youthful footman, dressed in the most fanciful  livery.    \"Is Mme. Gypsy at home?\"    The groom hesitated; seeing this, Fanferlot showed his note, and said:    \"M. Prosper told me to hand this note to madame, and wait for an  answer.\"    \"Walk in, and I will let madame know you are here.\"    The name of Prosper produced its effect. Fanferlot was ushered into  a little room furnished in blue and gold silk damask. Heavy curtains  darkened the windows, and hung in front of the doors. The floor was  covered with a blue velvet carpet.    \"Our cashier was certainly well lodged,\" murmured the detective.    But he had no time to purse his inventory. One of the door-curtains was  pushed aside, and Mme. Nina Gypsy stood before him.    Mme. Gypsy was quite young, small, and graceful, with a brown or rather  gold-colored quadroon complexion, with the hands and feet of a child.    Long curling silk lashes softened the piercing brilliancy of her large  black eyes; her lips were full, and her teeth were very white.    She had not yet made her toilet, but wore a velvet dressing-wrapper,  which did not conceal the lace ruffles beneath. But she had already been  under the hands of a hairdresser.    Her hair was curled and frizzed high on her forehead, and confined by  narrow bands of red velvet; her back hair was rolled in an immense coil,  and held by a beautiful gold comb.    She was ravishing. Her beauty was so startling that the dazzled  detective was speechless with admiration.    \"Well,\" he said to himself, as he remembered the noble, severe beauty of  Madeleine, whom he had seen a few hours previous, \"our young gentleman  certainly has good taste--very good taste--two perfect beauties!\"    While he thus reflected, perfectly bewildered, and wondering how  he could begin the conversation, Mme. Gypsy eyed him with the most  disdainful surprise; she was waiting for this shabby little man in a  threadbare coat and greasy hat to explain his presence in her dainty  parlor.    She had many creditors, and was recalling them, and wondering which one  had dared send this man to wipe his dusty boots on her velvet carpets.    After scrutinizing him from head to foot with undisguised contempt, she  said, haughtily:    \"What do you want?\"    Anyone but Fanferlot would have been offended at her insolent manner;  but he only noticed it to gain some notion of the young woman's  disposition.    \"She is bad-tempered,\" he thought, \"and is uneducated.\"    While he was speculating upon her merits, Mme. Nina impatiently tapped  her little foot, and waited for an answer; finally she said:    \"Why don't you speak? What do you want here?\"    \"I am charged, my dear madame,\" he answered in his softest tone, \"by M.  Bertomy, to give you this note.\"    \"From Prosper! You know him, then?\"    \"I have that honor, madame; indeed, I may be so bold as to claim him as  a friend.\"    \"Monsieur! _You_ a friend of Prosper!\" exclaimed Mme. Gypsy in a  scornful tone, as if her pride were wounded.    Fanferlot did not condescend to notice this offensive exclamation. He  was ambitious, and contempt failed to irritate him.    \"I said a friend of his, madame, and there are few people who would have  the courage to claim friendship for him now.\"    Mme. Gypsy was struck by the words and manner of Fanferlot.    \"I never could guess riddles,\" she said, tartly: \"will you be kind  enough to explain what you mean?\"    The detective slowly drew Prosper's note from his pocket, and, with a  bow, presented it to Mme. Gypsy.    \"Read, madame,\" he said.    She certainly anticipated no misfortune; although her sight was  excellent, she stopped to fasten a tiny gold eyeglass on her nose, then  carelessly opened the note.    At a glance she read its contents.    She turned very red, then very pale; she trembled as if with a nervous  chill; her limbs seemed to give way, and she tottered so that Fanferlot,  thinking she was about to fall, extended his arms to catch her.    Useless precaution! Mme. Gypsy was one of those women whose inert  listlessness conceals indomitable energy; fragile-looking creatures  whose powers of endurance and resistance are unlimited; cat-like in  their soft grace and delicacy, especially cat-like in their nerves and  muscles of steel.    The dizziness caused by the shock she had received quickly passed off.  She tottered, but did"]]]
