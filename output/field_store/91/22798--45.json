Mr. Hewitt, who has had great  experience in crossing tame cock-pheasants with fowls belonging to five  breeds, gives as the character of all \"extraordinary wildness\" (13/42. 'The  Poultry Book' by Tegetmeier 1866 pages 165, 167.); but I have myself seen one  exception to this rule. Mr. S. J. Salter (13/43. 'Natural History Review' 1863  April page 277.) who raised a large number of hybrids from a bantam-hen by  Gallus sonneratii, states that \"all were exceedingly wild.\" Mr. Waterton  (13/44. 'Essays on Natural History' page 917.) bred some wild ducks from eggs  hatched under a common duck, and the young were allowed to cross freely both  amongst themselves and with the tame ducks; they were \"half wild and half  tame; they came to the windows to be fed, but still they had a wariness about  them quite remarkable.\"    On the other hand, mules from the horse and ass are certainly not in the least  wild, though notorious for obstinacy and vice. Mr. Brent, who has crossed  canary-birds with many kinds of finches, has not observed, as he informs me,  that the hybrids were in any way remarkably wild: but Mr. Jenner Weir who has  had still greater experience, is of a directly opposite opinion. He remarks  that the siskin is the tamest of finches, but its mules are as wild, when  young, as newly caught birds, and are often lost through their continued  efforts to escape. Hybrids are often raised between the common and musk duck,  and I have been assured by three persons, who have kept these crossed birds,  that they were not wild; but Mr. Garnett (13/45. As stated by Mr. Orton in his  'Physiology of Breeding' page 12.) observed that his hybrids were wild, and  exhibited \"migratory propensities\" of which there is not a vestige in the  common or musk duck. No case is known of this latter bird having escaped and  become wild in Europe or Asia, except, according to Pallas, on the Caspian  Sea; and the common domestic duck only occasionally becomes wild in districts  where large lakes and fens abound. Nevertheless, a large number of cases have  been recorded (13/46. M. E. de Selys-Longchamps refers ('Bulletin Acad. Roy.  de Bruxelles' tome 12 No. 10) to more than seven of these hybrids shot in  Switzerland and France. M. Deby asserts ('Zoologist' volume 5 1845-46 page  1254) that several have been shot in various parts of Belgium and Northern  France. Audubon ('Ornitholog. Biography' volume 3 page 168), speaking of these  hybrids, says that, in North America, they \"now and then wander off and become  quite wild.\") of hybrids from these two ducks having been shot in a completely  wild state, although so few are reared in comparison with purely-bred birds of  either species. It is improbable that any of these hybrids could have acquired  their wildness from the musk-duck having paired with a truly wild duck; and  this is known not to be the case in North America; hence we must infer that  they have reacquired, through reversion, their wildness, as well as renewed  powers of flight.    These latter facts remind us of the statements, so frequently made by  travellers in all parts of the world, on the degraded state and savage  disposition of crossed races of man. That many excellent and kind-hearted  mulattos have existed no one will dispute; and a more mild and gentle set of  men could hardly be found than the inhabitants of the island of Chiloe, who  consist of Indians commingled with Spaniards in various proportions. On the  other hand, many years ago, long before I had thought of the present subject,  I was struck with the fact that, in South America, men of complicated descent  between Negroes, Indians, and Spaniards, seldom had, whatever the cause might  be, a good expression. (13/47. 'Journal of Researches' 1845 page 71.)  Livingstone--and a more unimpeachable authority cannot be quoted,--after  speaking of a half-caste man on the Zambesi, described by the Portuguese as a  rare monster of inhumanity, remarks, \"It is unaccountable why half-castes,  such as he, are so much more cruel than the Portuguese, but such is  undoubtedly the case.\" An inhabitant remarked to Livingstone, \"God made white  men, and God made black men, but the Devil made halfcastes.\" (13/48.  'Expedition to the Zambesi' 1865 pages 25, 150.) When two races, both low in  the scale, are crossed the progeny seems to be eminently bad. Thus the noble-  hearted Humboldt, who felt no prejudice against the inferior races, speaks in  strong terms of the bad and savage disposition of Zambos, or half-castes  between Indians and Negroes; and this conclusion has been arrived at by  various observers. (13/49. Dr. P. Broca on 'Hybridity in the Genus Homo'  English translation 1864 page 39.) From these facts we may perhaps infer that  the degraded state of so many half-castes is in part due to reversion to a  primitive and savage condition, induced by the act of crossing, even if mainly  due to the unfavourable moral conditions under which they are generally  reared.    SUMMARY ON THE PROXIMATE CAUSES LEADING TO REVERSION.    When purely-bred animals or plants reassume long-lost characters,--when the  common ass, for instance, is born with striped legs, when a pure race of black  or white pigeons throws a slaty-blue bird, or when a cultivated heartsease  with large and rounded flowers produces a seedling with small and elongated  flowers,--we are quite unable to assign any proximate cause. When animals run  wild, the tendency to reversion, which, though it has been greatly  exaggerated, no doubt exists, is sometimes to a certain extent intelligible.  Thus, with feral pigs, exposure to the weather will probably favour the growth  of the bristles, as is known to be the case with the hair of other  domesticated animals, and through correlation the tusks will tend to be  redeveloped. But the reappearance of coloured longitudinal stripes on young  feral pigs cannot be attributed to the direct action of external conditions.  In this case, and in many others, we can only say that any change in the  habits of life apparently favour a tendency, inherent or latent in the  species, to return to the primitive state.    It will be shown in a future chapter that the position of flowers on the  summit of the axis, and the position of seeds within the capsule, sometimes  determine a tendency towards reversion; and this apparently depends on the  amount of sap or nutriment which the flower-buds and seeds receive. The  position, also, of buds, either on branches or on roots, sometimes determines,  as was formerly shown, the transmission of the character proper to the  variety, or its reversion to a former state.    We have seen in the last section that when two races or species are crossed  there is the strongest tendency to the reappearance in the offspring of long-  lost characters, possessed by neither parent nor immediate progenitor. When  two white, or red, or black pigeons, of well-established breeds, are united,  the offspring are almost sure to inherit the same colours; but when  differently-coloured birds are crossed, the opposed forces of inheritance  apparently counteract each other, and the tendency which is inherent in both  parents to produce slaty-blue offspring becomes predominant. So it is in  several other cases. But when, for instance, the ass is crossed with E.  indicus or with the horse--animals which have not striped legs--and the  hybrids have conspicuous stripes on their legs and even on their faces, all  that can be said is, that an inherent tendency to reversion is evolved through  some disturbance in the organisation caused by the act of crossing.    Another form of reversion is far commoner, indeed is almost universal with the  offspring from a cross, namely, to the characters proper to either pure  parent-form. As a general rule, crossed offspring in the first generation are  nearly intermediate between their parents, but the grandchildren and  succeeding generations continually revert, in a greater or lesser degree, to  one or both of their progenitors. Several authors have maintained that hybrids  and mongrels include all the characters of both parents, not fused together,  but merely mingled in different proportions in different parts of the body;  or, as Naudin (13/50. 'Nouvelles Archives du Museum' tome 1 page 151.) has  expressed it, a hybrid is a living mosaic-work, in which the eye cannot  distinguish the discordant elements, so completely are they intermingled. We  can hardly doubt that, in a certain sense, this is true, as when we behold in  a hybrid the elements of both species segregating themselves into segments in  the same flower or fruit, by a process of self-attraction or self-affinity;  this segregation taking place either by seminal or bud-propagation. Naudin  further believes that the segregation of the two specific elements or essences  is eminently liable to occur in the male and female reproductive matter; and  he thus explains the almost universal tendency to reversion in successive  hybrid generations. For this would be the natural result of the union of  pollen and ovules, in both of which the elements of the same species had been  segregated by self-affinity. If, on the other hand, pollen which included the  elements of one species happened to unite with ovules including the elements  of the other species, the intermediate or hybrid state would still be  retained, and there would be no reversion. But it would, as I suspect, be more  correct to say that the elements of both parent-species exist in every hybrid  in a double state, namely, blended together and completely separate. How this  is possible, and what the term specific essence or element may be supposed to  express, I shall attempt to show in the chapter on the hypothesis of  pangenesis.    But Naudin's view, as propounded by him, is not applicable to the reappearance  of characters lost long ago by variation; and it is hardly applicable to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28752"],[0,"Pleasures of the telescope (#7)"],[1,"scattered by a telescope, even  with the lowest power.    Eastward from Canis Major we find some of the stars of Argo Navis. Sigma  1097, of the sixth magnitude, has two minute companions at 20\" distance,  p. 311 deg. and 312 deg.. The large star is itself double, but the distance,  0.8\", p. 166 deg., places it beyond our reach. According to Burnham, there  is yet a fourth faint star at 31\", p. 40 deg.. Some three degrees and a half  below and to the left of the star just examined is a beautiful star  cluster, No. 1551. Nos. 1564, 1571, and 1630 are other star clusters  well worth examination. A planetary nebula is included in 1564. With  very powerful telescopes this nebula has been seen ring-shaped. Sigma  1146, otherwise known as 5 Navis, is a pretty double, colors pale yellow  and blue, magnitudes five and seven, distance 3.25\", p. 19 deg.. Our  three-inch will suffice for this.    [Illustration: MAP NO. 3.]    North of Canis Major and Argo we find Monoceros and Canis Minor (map No.  3). The stars forming the western end of Monoceros are depicted on map  No. 1. We shall begin with these. The most interesting and beautiful is  11, a fine triple star, magnitudes five, six, and seven, distances 7.4\",  p. 131 deg., and 2.7\", p. 103 deg.. Sir William Herschel regarded this as one of  the most beautiful sights in the heavens. It is a good object to try our  three-inch on, although it should not be difficult for such an aperture.  The star 4 is also a triple, magnitudes six, ten, and eleven, distances  3.4\", p. 178 deg., and 10\", p. 244 deg.. We should glance at the star 5 to  admire its fine orange color. In 8 we find a golden fifth-magnitude  star, combined with a blue or lilac star of the seventh magnitude,  distance 14\", p. 24 deg.. Sigma 938 is a difficult double, magnitudes six  and a half and twelve, distance 10\", p. 210 deg.. Sigma 921 is double,  magnitudes six and a half and eight, distance 16\", p. 4 deg.. At the spot  marked on the map 1424 we find an interesting cluster containing one  star of the sixth magnitude.    The remaining stars of Monoceros will be found on map No. 3. The double  and triple stars to be noted are S, or Sigma 950 (which is also a  variable and involved in a faint nebula), magnitudes six and nine,  distance 2.5\", p. 206 deg.; Sigma 1183, double, magnitudes five and a half  and eight, distance 31\", p. 326 deg.; Sigma 1190, triple, magnitudes five  and a half, ten, and nine, distances 31\", p. 105 deg., and 67\", p. 244 deg..  The clusters are 1465, which has a minute triple star near the center;  1483, one member of whose swarm is red; 1611, very small but rich; and  1637, interesting for the great number of ninth-magnitude stars that it  contains. We should use the five-inch for all of these.    Canis Minor and the Head of Hydra are also contained on map No. 3.  Procyon, alpha of Canis Minor, has several minute stars in the same  field of view. There is, besides, a companion which, although it was  known to exist, no telescope was able to detect until November, 1896. It  must be of immense mass, since its attraction causes perceptible  perturbations in the motion of Procyon. Its magnitude is eight and a  half, distance 4.83\", p. 338 deg.. One of the small stars just referred to,  the second one east of Procyon, distant one third of the moon's  diameter, is an interesting double. Our four-inch may separate it, and  the five-inch is certain to do so. The magnitudes are seven and seven  and a half or eight, distance 1.2\", p. 133 deg.. This star is variously  named Sigma 1126 and 31 Can. Min. Bode. Star No. 14 is a wide triple,  magnitudes six, seven, and eight, distances 75, p. 65 deg., and 115\", p.  154 deg..    PROCYON AND ITS NEIGHBORS.    In the Head of Hydra we find Sigma 1245, a double of the sixth and  seventh magnitudes, distance 10.5\", p. 25 deg.. The larger star shows a fine  yellow. In epsilon we have a beautiful combination of a yellow with a  blue star, magnitudes four and eight, distance 3.4\", p. 198 deg.. Finally,  let us look at theta for a light test with the five-inch. The two stars  composing it are of the fourth and twelfth magnitudes, distance 50\", p.  170 deg..    The brilliant constellations of Gemini and Taurus tempt us next, but  warning clouds are gathering, and we shall do well to house our  telescopes and warm our fingers by the winter fire. There will be other  bright nights, and the stars are lasting.          CHAPTER III    FROM GEMINI TO LEO AND ROUND ABOUT    \"If thou wouldst gaze on starry Charioteer,  And hast heard legends of the wondrous Goat,  Vast looming shalt thou find on the Twins' left,  His form bowed forward.\"--POSTE'S ARATUS.      [Illustration: MAP NO. 4.]    The zodiacal constellations of Gemini, Cancer, and Leo, together with  their neighbors Auriga, the Lynx, Hydra, Sextans, and Coma Berenices,  will furnish an abundance of occupation for our second night at the  telescope. We shall begin, using our three-inch glass, with alpha, the  chief star of Gemini (map No. 4). This is ordinarily known as Castor.  Even an inexperienced eye perceives at once that it is not as bright as  its neighbor Pollux, beta. Whether this fact is to be regarded as  indicating that Castor was brighter than Pollux in 1603, when Bayer  attached their Greek letters, is still an unsettled question. Castor may  or may not be a variable, but it is, at any rate, one of the most  beautiful double stars in the heavens. A power of one hundred is amply  sufficient to separate its components, whose magnitudes are about two  and three, the distance between them being 6\", p. 226 deg.. A slight yet  distinct tinge of green, recalling that of the Orion nebula, gives a  peculiar appearance to this couple. Green is one of the rarest colors  among the stars. Castor belongs to the same general spectroscopic type  in which Sirius is found, but its lines of hydrogen are broader than  those seen in the spectrum of the Dog Star. There is reason for  thinking that it may be surrounded with a more extensive atmosphere of  that gaseous metal called hydrogen than any other bright star possesses.  There seems to be no doubt that the components of Castor are in  revolution around their common center of gravity, although the period is  uncertain, varying in different estimates all the way from two hundred  and fifty to one thousand years; the longer estimate is probably not far  from the truth. There is a tenth-magnitude star, distance 73\", p. 164 deg.,  which may belong to the same system.    From Castor let us turn to Pollux, at the same time exchanging our  three-inch telescope for the four-inch, or, still better, the five-inch.  Pollux has five faint companions, of which we may expect to see three,  as follows: Tenth magnitude, distance 175\", p. 70 deg.; nine and a half  magnitude, distance 206\", p. 90 deg., and ninth magnitude, distance 229\", p.  75 deg.. Burnham has seen a star of thirteen and a half magnitude, distance  43\", p. 275 deg., and has divided the tenth-magnitude star into two  components, only 1.4\" apart, the smaller being of the thirteenth  magnitude, and situated at the angle 128 deg.. A calculation based on Dr.  Elkin's parallax of 0.068\" for Pollux shows that that star may be a  hundredfold more luminous than the sun, while its nearest companion may  be a body smaller than our planet Jupiter, but shining, of course, by  its own light. Its distance from Pollux, however, exceeds that of  Jupiter from the sun in the ratio of about one hundred and thirty to  one.    In the double star pi we shall find a good light test for our three-inch  aperture, the magnitudes being six and eleven, distance 22\", p. 212 deg..  The four-inch will show that kappa is a double, magnitudes four and ten,  distance 6\", p. 232 deg.. The smaller star is of a delicate blue color, and  it has been suspected of variability. That it may be variable is  rendered the more probable by the fact that in the immediate  neighborhood of kappa there are three undoubted variables, S, T, and U,  and there appears to be some mysterious law of association which causes  such stars to group themselves in certain regions. None of the variables  just named ever become visible to the naked eye, although they all  undergo great changes of brightness, sinking from the eighth or ninth  magnitude down to the thirteenth or even lower. The variable R, which  lies considerably farther west, is well worth attention because of the  remarkable change of color which it sometimes exhibits. It has been seen  blue, red, and yellow in succession. It varies from between the sixth  and seventh magnitudes to less than the thirteenth in a period of about  two hundred and forty-two days.    Not far away we find a still more curious variable zeta; this is also an  interesting triple star, its principal component being a little under  the third magnitude, while one of the companions is of the seventh  magnitude, distance 90\", p. 355 deg., and the other is of the eleventh  magnitude or less, distance 65\", p. 85 deg.. We should hardly expect to see  the fainter companion with the three-inch. The principal star varies  from magnitude three and seven tenths down to magnitude four and a half  in a period of a little more than ten days.    [Illustration: WONDERFUL NEBULA IN GEMINI (1532).]    With the four-or five-inch we get a very pretty sight in delta, which  appears split into a yellow and a purple star, magnitudes three and  eight, distance 7\", p. 206 deg..    Near delta, toward the east, lies one of the strangest of all the  nebulae. (See the figures 1532 on the map.) Our telescopes will show it  to us only as a minute star surrounded with a nebulous atmosphere, but  its appearance with instruments of the first magnitude is so  astonishing and at the same time so beautiful that I can not refrain  from giving a brief description of it as I saw it in 1893 with the great  Lick telescope.
