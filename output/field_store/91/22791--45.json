But the monster, the thing you have  described.... Cy, if I didn't know you as I do I would have you locked  up.\"    \"It's true,\" said Thurston, simply. \"It's damnable, but it's true. Now  what does it mean?\"    \"Heaven knows,\" was the response. \"That's where it came from--out of the  heavens.\"    \"Not what we saw,\" Slim Riley broke in. \"That thing came straight out of  Hell.\" And in his voice was no suggestion of levity.    \"You left Los Angeles early yesterday; have you seen the papers?\"    Thurston shook his head.    \"They are back,\" said the Secretary. \"Reported over London--Paris--the  West Coast. Even China has seen them. Shanghai cabled an hour ago.\"    \"Them? How many are there?\"    \"Nobody knows. There were five seen at one time. There are more--unless  the same ones go around the world in a matter of minutes.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Thurston remembered that whirlwind of vapor and a vanishing speck in the  Arizona sky. \"They could,\" he asserted. \"They're faster than anything on  earth. Though what drives them ... that gas--steam--whatever it is....\"    \"Hydrogen,\" stated General Lozier. \"I saw the New York show when poor  Davis got his. He flew into the exhaust; it went off like a million  bombs. Characteristic hydrogen flame trailed the damn thing up out of  sight--a tail of blue fire.\"    \"And cold,\" stated Thurston.    \"Hot as a Bunsen burner,\" the General contradicted. \"Davis' plane almost  melted.\"    \"Before it ignited,\" said the other. He told of the cold in their plane.    \"Ha!\" The General spoke explosively. \"That's expansion. That's a tip on  their motive power. Expansion of gas. That accounts for the cold and  the vapor. Suddenly expanded it would be intensely cold. The moisture of  the air would condense, freeze. But how could they carry it? Or\"--he  frowned for a moment, brows drawn over deep-set gray eyes--\"or generate  it? But that's crazy--that's impossible!\"    \"So is the whole matter,\" the Secretary reminded him. \"With the  information Mr. Thurston and Mr. Riley have given us, the whole affair  is beyond any gage our past experience might supply. We start from the  impossible, and we go--where? What is to be done?\"    \"With your permission, sir, a number of things shall be done. It would  be interesting to see what a squadron of planes might accomplish, diving  on them from above. Or anti-aircraft fire.\"           *       *       *       *       *    \"No,\" said the Secretary of War, \"not yet. They have looked us over,  but they have not attacked. For the present we do not know what they  are. All of us have our suspicions--thoughts of interplanetary  travel--thoughts too wild for serious utterance--but we know nothing.    \"Say nothing to the papers of what you have told me,\" he directed  Thurston. \"Lord knows their surmises are wild enough now. And for you,  General, in the event of any hostile move, you will resist.\"    \"Your order was anticipated, sir.\" The General permitted himself a  slight smile. \"The air force is ready.\"    \"Of course,\" the Secretary of War nodded. \"Meet me here to-night--nine  o'clock.\" He included Thurston and Riley in the command. \"We need to  think ... to think ... and perhaps their mission is friendly.\"    \"Friendly!\" The two flyers exchanged glances as they went to the door.  And each knew what the other was seeing--a viscous ocherous mass that  formed into a head where eyes devilish in their hate stared coldly into  theirs....    \"Think, we need to think,\" repeated Thurston later. \"A creature that is  just one big hideous brain, that can think an arm into existence--think  a head where it wishes! What does a thing like that think of? What  beastly thoughts could that--that _thing_ conceive?\"    \"If I got the sights of a Lewis gun on it,\" said Riley vindictively,  \"I'd make it think.\"    \"And my guess is that is all you would accomplish,\" Thurston told him.  \"I am forming a few theories about our visitors. One is that it would be  quite impossible to find a vital spot in that big homogeneous mass.\"    The pilot dispensed with theories: his was a more literal mind. \"Where  on earth did they come from, do you suppose, Mr. Thurston?\"           *       *       *       *       *    They were walking to their hotel. Thurston raised his eyes to the summer  heavens. Faint stars were beginning to twinkle; there was one that  glowed steadily.    \"Nowhere on earth,\" Thurston stated softly, \"nowhere on earth.\"    \"Maybe so,\" said the pilot, \"maybe so. We've thought about it and talked  about it ... and they've gone ahead and done it.\" He called to a  newsboy; they took the latest editions to their room.    The papers were ablaze with speculation. There were dispatches from all  corners of the earth, interviews with scientists and near scientists.  The machines were a Soviet invention--they were beyond anything  human--they were harmless--they would wipe out civilization--poison  gas--blasts of fire like that which had enveloped the army flyer....    And through it all Thurston read an ill-concealed fear, a reflection of  panic that was gripping the nation--the whole world. These great  machines were sinister. Wherever they appeared came the sense of being  watched, of a menace being calmly withheld. And at thought of the  obscene monsters inside those spheres, Thurston's lips were compressed  and his eyes hardened. He threw the papers aside.    \"They are here,\" he said, \"and that's all that we know. I hope the  Secretary of War gets some good men together. And I hope someone is  inspired with an answer.\"    \"An answer is it?\" said Riley. \"I'm thinkin' that the answer will come,  but not from these swivel-chair fighters. 'Tis the boys in the cockpits  with one hand on the stick and one on the guns that will have the  answer.\"    But Thurston shook his head. \"Their speed,\" he said, \"and the gas!  Remember that cold. How much of it can they lay over a city?\"    The question was unanswered, unless the quick ringing of the phone was a  reply.    \"War Department,\" said a voice. \"Hold the wire.\" The voice of the  Secretary of War came on immediately.    \"Thurston?\" he asked. \"Come over at once on the jump, old man. Hell's  popping.\"           *       *       *       *       *    The windows of the War Department Building were all alight as they  approached. Cars were coming and going; men in uniform, as the Secretary  had said, \"on the jump.\" Soldiers with bayonets stopped them, then  passed Thurston and his companion on. Bells were ringing from all sides.  But in the Secretary's office was perfect quiet.    General Lozier was there, Thurston saw, and an imposing array of  gold-braided men with a sprinkling of those in civilian clothes. One he  recognized: MacGregor from the Bureau of Standards. The Secretary handed  Thurston some papers.    \"Radio,\" he explained. \"They are over the Pacific coast. Hit near  Vancouver; Associated Press says city destroyed. They are working down  the coast. Same story--blast of hydrogen from their funnel shaped base.  Colder than Greenland below them; snow fell in Seattle. No real attack  since Vancouver and little damage done--\" A message was laid before  him.    \"Portland,\" he said. \"Five mystery ships over city. Dart repeatedly  toward earth, deliver blast of gas and then retreat. Doing no damage.  Apparently inviting attack. All commercial planes ordered grounded.  Awaiting instructions.    \"Gentlemen,\" said the Secretary, \"I believe I speak for all present when  I say that, in the absence of first hand information, we are utterly  unable to arrive at any definite conclusion or make a definite plan.  There is a menace in this, undeniably. Mr. Thurston and Mr. Riley have  been good enough to report to me. They have seen one machine at close  range. It was occupied by a monster so incredible that the report would  receive no attention from me did I not know Mr. Thurston personally.    \"Where have they come from? What does it mean--what is their mission?  Only God knows.    \"Gentlemen, I feel that I must see them. I want General Lozier to  accompany me, also Doctor MacGregor, to advise me from the scientific  angle. I am going to the Pacific Coast. They may not wait--that is  true--but they appear to be going slowly south. I will leave to-night  for San Diego. I hope to intercept them. We have strong air-forces  there; the Navy Department is cooperating.\"           *       *       *       *       *    He waited for no comment. \"General,\" he ordered, \"will you kindly  arrange for a plane? Take an escort or not as you think best.    \"Mr. Thurston and Mr. Riley will also accompany us. We want all the  authoritative data we can get. This on my return will be placed before  you, gentlemen, for your consideration.\" He rose from his chair. \"I hope  they wait for us,\" he said.    Time was when a commander called loudly for a horse, but in this day a  Secretary of War is not kept waiting for transportation. Sirening  motorcycles preceded them from the city. Within an hour, motors roaring  wide open, propellers ripping into the summer night, lights slipping  eastward three thousand feet below, the Secretary of War for the United  States was on his way. And on either side from their plane stretched the  arms of a V. Like a flight of gigantic wild geese, fast fighting planes  of the Army air service bored steadily into the night, guarantors of  safe convoy.    \"The Air Service is ready,\" General Lozier had said. And Thurston and  his pilot knew that from East coast to West, swift scout planes, whose  idling engines could roar into action at a moment's notice, stood  waiting; battle planes hidden in hangars would roll forth at the  word--the Navy was cooperating--and at San Diego there were strong naval  units, Army units, and Marine Corps.    \"They don't know what we can do, what we have up our sleeve: "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2865"],[0,"Otto of the Silver Hand (#7)"],[1," from a far away Swiss  castle; Count Rudolph of Hapsburg, a good, honest man with a good,  honest, homely face, but bringing with him a stern sense of justice and  of right, and a determination to put down the lawlessness of the savage  German barons among whom he had come as Emperor.    One day two strangers came galloping up the winding path to the gates  of the Dragon's house. A horn sounded thin and clear, a parley was held  across the chasm in the road between the two strangers and the porter  who appeared at the little wicket. Then a messenger was sent running to  the Baron, who presently came striding across the open court-yard to the  gateway to parley with the strangers.    The two bore with them a folded parchment with a great red seal  hanging from it like a clot of blood; it was a message from the Emperor  demanding that the Baron should come to the Imperial Court to answer  certain charges that had been brought against him, and to give his bond  to maintain the peace of the empire.    One by one those barons who had been carrying on their private wars, or  had been despoiling the burgher folk in their traffic from town to  town, and against whom complaint had been lodged, were summoned to the  Imperial Court, where they were compelled to promise peace and to swear  allegiance to the new order of things. All those who came willingly were  allowed to return home again after giving security for maintaining the  peace; all those who came not willingly were either brought in chains  or rooted out of their strongholds with fire and sword, and their roofs  burned over their heads.    Now it was Baron Conrad's turn to be summoned to the Imperial Court,  for complaint had been lodged against him by his old enemy of  Trutz-Drachen--Baron Henry--the nephew of the old Baron Frederick  who had been slain while kneeling in the dust of the road back of the  Kaiserburg.    No one at Drachenhausen could read but Master Rudolph, the steward,  who was sand blind, and little Otto. So the boy read the summons to his  father, while the grim Baron sat silent with his chin resting upon his  clenched fist and his eyebrows drawn together into a thoughtful frown as  he gazed into the pale face of his son, who sat by the rude oaken table  with the great parchment spread out before him.    Should he answer the summons, or scorn it as he would have done under  the old emperors? Baron Conrad knew not which to do; pride said one  thing and policy another. The Emperor was a man with an iron hand, and  Baron Conrad knew what had happened to those who had refused to obey the  imperial commands. So at last he decided that he would go to the court,  taking with him a suitable escort to support his dignity.    It was with nearly a hundred armed men clattering behind him that Baron  Conrad rode away to court to answer the imperial summons. The castle was  stripped of its fighting men, and only eight remained behind to guard  the great stone fortress and the little simple-witted boy.    It was a sad mistake.    Three days had passed since the Baron had left the castle, and now the  third night had come. The moon was hanging midway in the sky, white and  full, for it was barely past midnight.    The high precipitous banks of the rocky road threw a dense black shadow  into the gully below, and in that crooked inky line that scarred the  white face of the moonlit rocks a band of some thirty men were creeping  slowly and stealthily nearer and nearer to Castle Drachenhausen. At the  head of them was a tall, slender knight clad in light chain armor, his  head covered only by a steel cap or bascinet.    Along the shadow they crept, with only now and then a faint clink or  jingle of armor to break the stillness, for most of those who followed  the armed knight were clad in leathern jerkins; only one or two wearing  even so much as a steel breast-plate by way of armor.    So at last they reached the chasm that yawned beneath the roadway, and  there they stopped, for they had reached the spot toward which they had  been journeying. It was Baron Henry of Trutz-Drachen who had thus come  in the silence of the night time to the Dragon's house, and his visit  boded no good to those within.    The Baron and two or three of his men talked together in low tones, now  and then looking up at the sheer wall that towered above them.    \"Yonder is the place, Lord Baron,\" said one of those who stood with him.  \"I have scanned every foot of the wall at night for a week past. An we  get not in by that way, we get not in at all. A keen eye, a true aim,  and a bold man are all that we need, and the business is done.\" Here  again all looked upward at the gray wall above them, rising up in the  silent night air.    High aloft hung the wooden bartizan or watch-tower, clinging to the face  of the outer wall and looming black against the pale sky above. Three  great beams pierced the wall, and upon them the wooden tower rested. The  middle beam jutted out beyond the rest to the distance of five or six  feet, and the end of it was carved into the rude semblance of a dragon's  head.    \"So, good,\" said the Baron at last; \"then let us see if thy plan holds,  and if Hans Schmidt's aim is true enough to earn the three marks that I  have promised him. Where is the bag?\"    One of those who stood near handed the Baron a leathern pouch, the Baron  opened it and drew out a ball of fine thread, another of twine, a coil  of stout rope, and a great bundle that looked, until it was unrolled,  like a coarse fish-net. It was a rope ladder. While these were being  made ready, Hans Schmidt, a thick-set, low-browed, broad-shouldered  archer, strung his stout bow, and carefully choosing three arrows  from those in his quiver, he stuck them point downward in the earth.  Unwinding the ball of thread, he laid it loosely in large loops upon the  ground so that it might run easily without hitching, then he tied the  end of the thread tightly around one of his arrows. He fitted the arrow  to the bow and drew the feather to his ear. Twang! rang the bowstring,  and the feathered messenger flew whistling upon its errand to the  watch-tower. The very first shaft did the work.    \"Good,\" said Hans Schmidt, the archer, in his heavy voice, \"the three  marks are mine, Lord Baron.\"    The arrow had fallen over and across the jutting beam between the carved  dragon's head and the bartizan, carrying with it the thread, which now  hung from above, glimmering white in the moonlight like a cobweb.    The rest was an easy task enough. First the twine was drawn up to and  over the beam by the thread, then the rope was drawn up by the twine,  and last of all the rope ladder by the rope. There it hung like a thin,  slender black line against the silent gray walls.    \"And now,\" said the Baron, \"who will go first and win fifty marks for  his own, and climb the rope ladder to the tower yonder?\" Those around  hesitated. \"Is there none brave enough to venture?\" said the Baron,  after a pause of silence.    A stout, young fellow, of about eighteen years of age, stepped forward  and flung his flat leathern cap upon the ground. \"I will go, my Lord  Baron,\" said he.    \"Good,\" said the Baron, \"the fifty marks are thine. And now listen, if  thou findest no one in the watch-tower, whistle thus; if the watchman  be at his post, see that thou makest all safe before thou givest the  signal. When all is ready the others will follow thee. And now go and  good luck go with thee.\"    The young fellow spat upon his hands and, seizing the ropes, began  slowly and carefully to mount the flimsy, shaking ladder. Those below  held it as tight as they were able, but nevertheless he swung backward  and forward and round and round as he climbed steadily upward. Once he  stopped upon the way, and those below saw him clutch the ladder close  to him as though dizzied by the height and the motion but he soon began  again, up, up, up like some great black spider. Presently he came out  from the black shadow below and into the white moonlight, and then his  shadow followed him step by step up the gray wall upon his way. At last  he reached the jutting beam, and there again he stopped for a moment  clutching tightly to it. The next he was upon the beam, dragging himself  toward the window of the bartizan just above. Slowly raising himself  upon his narrow foothold he peeped cautiously within. Those watching  him from be low saw him slip his hand softly to his side, and then place  something between his teeth. It was his dagger. Reaching up, he clutched  the window sill above him and, with a silent spring, seated himself  upon it. The next moment he disappeared within. A few seconds of silence  followed, then of sudden a sharp gurgling cry broke the stillness. There  was another pause of silence, then a faint shrill whistle sounded from  above.    \"Who will go next?\" said the Baron. It was Hans Schmidt who stepped  forward. Another followed the arch up the ladder, and another, and  another. Last of all went the Baron Henry himself, and nothing was left  but the rope ladder hanging from above, and swaying back and forth in  the wind.    That night Schwartz Carl had been bousing it over a pot of yellow wine  in the pantry with his old crony, Master Rudolph, the steward; and the  two, chatting and gossiping together, had passed the time away until  long after the rest of the castle had been wrapped in sleep. Then,  perhaps a little unsteady upon his feet, Schwartz Carl betook himself  homeward to the Melchior tower.    He stood for a while in the shadow of the doorway, gazing up into the  pale sky above him at the great, bright, round moon, that hung like a  bubble above the sharp peaks of the roofs standing black as ink against  the sky. But all of a sudden he started up from the post against which  he had been leaning, and with head bent to one side, stood listening  breathlessly, for he too had heard that smothered cry from the  watch-tower."]]]
