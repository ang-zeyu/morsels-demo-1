THE GROUSE      Within the territorial scope of this work there are seven species of  the grouse family, though only four of these are in any way common. As  the wild turkey is confined to the southern extremity of the Pacific  Coast hunting grounds, so are the grouse principally found in the  northern sections. I have met with a few dusky grouse (=Dendragapus  obscurus=) in the mountains of Arizona, but they are by no means  plentiful. There were a few and possibly is yet an occasional sooty  grouse (=Dendragapus obscurus fuliginosus=) in the mountains of  southern California, but grouse in sufficient numbers to furnish any  kind of sport are not found much south of Yosemite valley in the  Sierras, or south of Humboldt county in the Coast range. An occasional  pair or small flock, however, may be met with considerable south of  the points named.    The grouse is a northern bird, extending into far colder regions than  any other subfamily of the gallinaceous group. The ptarmigan, of  course, are grouse.        [Illustration: SOOTY GROUSE (Dendragapus obscurus fuliginosus)]      THE SOOTY GROUSE    (Dendragapus obscurus fuliginosus)    The sooty grouse, commonly called blue grouse by the sportsmen of  California, are reasonably plentiful in the Sierras from the Yosemite  north into Oregon, where they are quite plentiful, and from there  through Washington into Alaska. It is a mountain dweller, being found  at altitudes fully 9000 feet above the sea. In the winter it descends  to lower latitudes, but seldom below 3000 feet. It is naturally a  confiding bird where it has not been hunted much, and for this reason  has been given the name, \"fool hen,\" in many localities. But like  most of the feathered tribe, it soon learns the destructiveness of  man, and after gaining this knowledge it is quite able to take care of  itself. When flushed it flies with a cackling sound, generally taking  refuge in the tall pines, where it is an expert hider. In the nesting  season it produces a drumming sound and struts like a turkey. This  drumming is produced by inflating an air sack on each side of the  neck. Later in the season these sacks dry up and nearly disappear.  It's only migrations are ascending and descending the mountains with  the seasons.    According to a published statement of the Section of Biological Survey  of the United States Department of Agriculture, the food of the sooty  grouse consists of buds, seeds, leaves and insects, of which 68 per cent  is leaves, buds and the tender ends of young twigs; 6.73 per cent  insects and the balance seeds, berries and the like. The flesh is  generally of a fine flavor, though at times it will be found to be  tainted a little strongly with the flavor of the pine.    =Color=--Male--Back of head, back of neck and all upper parts, a sooty  brown; light streak over the eye and a light throat; breast, a dead or  sooty black; the rest of the under parts a slaty gray; tail tipped  with gray.    Female--Generally lighter in color but otherwise resembling the male.    =Nest and Eggs=--The nest is usually nothing more than a depression in  the ground among dried leaves or grass, well concealed from view. The  eggs, which average about a dozen, are of a cream color, spotted with  brown.    =Measurements=--Total length, from 18 to 22 inches; wing, 9 to 9-1/2. The  weight will vary from 2-1/2 to 4 pounds.        [Illustration: OREGON RUFFED GROUSE (Bonasa umbellus sabini)]      THE OREGON RUFFED GROUSE    (Bonasa umbellus sabini)    The Oregon ruffed grouse is the handsomest species of the ruffed  grouse genus, and is truly a beautiful bird with its deep, rich  browns, orange and black. The eastern species of this genus is wrongly  known in the north Atlantic states by the name of partridge, and as  wrongly called pheasant in Virginia and some other of the southern  states. The Pacific Coast species ranges from northern California  along the Coast range through Oregon, Washington and far into British  Columbia. It is a wary bird, full of cunning and gamy qualities. The  male of this genus is, I believe, the only member of the grouse family  that drums all the year; all others confining their drumming to the  nesting season. This drumming is made with the wings and not by the  inflation of an air sack as with other species. The sound, also, is  much different, having more of a rolling reverberation. In the spring  they will take their position on some rock or dead log and strut back  and forth with their heads thrown back and their tails spread out to  show the beautiful hues of the feathers and drum for hours to attract  the hens or challenge the other males to an almost life and death  combat, in which they fight in the same manner as the game cock. They  live among the pines, usually near some little opening where they are  fond of feeding. When startled they take at once to the timber and are  quickly lost to view. For this reason dogs are almost useless in  hunting them. They are never found in numbers greater than a single  brood, even though the brood may be decimated by the gun of the  sportsman or the cunning of the vermin to no more than two or three.    The flesh of the ruffed grouse is white and generally tender and of  fine flavor, although in the late fall or winter when its food  consists almost wholly of fir buds it tastes quite strong of  turpentine. Its food generally is about the same as the sooty grouse  and in about the same percentages.    =Color=--Head, light chestnut, the feathers on the top being long and  capable of erection when excited; a tuft of long, rich brown feathers  will be found on each side of the neck; back, reddish chestnut mottled  with black; rump and tail-coverts, more of a cinnamon color blotched  with dark brown; flanks, lighter and barred with black; tail, rusty  brown barred with deep brown and tipped with two bands of gray,  separated by a streak of black; under tail-coverts, orange, barred  with black and tipped with white; wing feathers, brown with a central  stripe of light yellow.    The female is marked the same but somewhat lighter in coloring.    =Nest and Eggs=--The nest, like that of all the gallinaceous birds, is  made on the ground and hidden away in some thick cluster of brush or  beneath some log. The eggs are of a buff color spotted with dark  brown, and number from ten to fifteen.    =Measurements=--Total length from 16 to 19 inches; wing about 7 or 8  inches. Weight about 2 pounds.      THE CANADIAN RUFFED GROUSE    (Bonasa umbellus togata)    The Canadian ruffed grouse ranges through the eastern side of the  Cascade mountains of Oregon and Washington, but does not pass over to  the Pacific side. It resembles the Oregon ruffed grouse very closely  except that it is much lighter in color, and the female either lacks  the tufts of feathers on the neck entirely, or where present, they are  very small. Like the Oregon species it is a dweller in the heavy  timber, and follow the same habits in most all respects. It is of a  more confiding nature, however, often sitting unconcerned upon a tree  while several of its companions are being shot, making no effort to  get away or save itself from the same fate.    =Color=--The color of this species is more of a grayish brown than the  Oregon species, and lacking that rich chestnut that adds so much to  the beauty of the latter. The brown markings, however, are possibly a  little more conspicuous. The upper tail feathers are more of a blue,  mottled and barred with a blackish brown. A large tuft of feathers on  each side of the neck of a smoky brown, edged with metallic green.  Unlike the Oregon species these feathers are entirely absent or very  small on the female.    =Nest and Eggs=--The nest and eggs are the same as the Oregon grouse.    =Measurements=--In size the two species do not vary to any  considerable extent.      THE SPRUCE GROUSE    (Dendragapus franklini)    The spruce or Franklin grouse of Oregon and Washington is a species of  the Canadian spruce grouse, and ranges diagonally through the  mountains of eastern Oregon and Washington, and thence to the coast of  British Columbia. It confines its habitat to the higher mountains,  being seldom found below an elevation of four to five thousand feet.  This is another of the grouse family that has been given the name of  \"fool hen,\" on account of its naturally tame nature.

The largest British song bird, distinguished from the Song Thrush not  only by its superior size, but by having white under wing-coverts, and  the whole of the under part of the body buffish-white, spotted with  black. It is a generally diffused bird, and is known by various local  names; in the west of England its popular name is Holm Thrush, or Holm  Screech, derived most probably, not, as Yarrell surmises, from its  resorting to the oak in preference to other trees, but from its  feeding on the berries of the holly, or holm; the title 'Screech'  being given to it from its jarring note when angry or alarmed, which  closely resembles the noise made by passing the finger-nail rapidly  along the teeth of a comb. Its French name, 'Draine', and German,  'Schnarre', seem to be descriptive of the same harsh '_churr_'. In  Wales, it has from its quarrelsome habits acquired the name of Penn y  llwyn, or, master of the coppice. Another of its names, Throstle Cock,  expresses its alliance with the Thrushes, and its daring nature; and  another Storm Cock, indicates 'not that it delights in storms more  than in fine weather, but that"]]]
