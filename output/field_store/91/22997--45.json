It is, however, uncertain  whether he had obtained any idea of the last and most perfect style of  Bellini. He had a pupil and successor in his labours at Ravenna in  Francesco da Cotignola, whom Bonoli, in his history of Lugo, and that of  Cotignola, as well as the describer of the Parmese paintings, agree in  surnaming Marchesi, while in the Guide to Ravenna, he is denominated  Zaganelli. Vasari commends him, as a very pleasing colourist; although  inferior to Rondinello in point of design, and still more of composition.  In this he was not happy, if we except his celebrated Resurrection of  Lazarus, which is to be seen at Classe; his extremely beautiful baptism of  Jesus Christ, at Faenza, and a few other histories, where he checks his  ardour, and more carefully disposes his figures, for the most part fine and  well draped; occasionally whimsical, and in proportions less than life. One  of his most extraordinary productions is a large altar-piece at the church  of the Osservanti, in Parma, where he represented the Virgin between  several Saints, enlivened by several portraits in the background. He never,  in my opinion, produced any work more solid in conception, nor more  harmoniously disposed, nor more ingenious in the colonnade, and the other  accessary parts. Here he preserved the most moderate tints, contrary to his  usual practice, which was glowing and highly animated, and distributed more  in the manner of Mantegna, than of any other master. He had a brother named  Bernardino, with whom, in 1504, he painted a very celebrated altar-piece,  representing the Virgin between S. Francesco and the Baptist, placed in the  interior chapel of the Padri Osservanti, in Ravenna; and another to be seen  at Imola, in the church of the Riformati, with the date 1509. Bernardino,  likewise, displayed tolerable ability alone, and among the paintings at  Pavia, there is one at the Carmine, inscribed with his name; a fact that  may correct an error of Crespi, who names the elder brother Francesco  Bernardino, making the two into one artist.    Contemporary with him, Baldassare Carrari was employed at Ravenna along  with his son Matteo, both natives of that state. They painted for San  Domenico the celebrated altar-piece of S. Bartolommeo, with the grado,  containing very elegant histories of the Holy Apostle. Such is its merit,  as hardly to yield to the gracefulness of Luca Longhi, who placed one of  his own pictures near it. It was one of the earliest which was painted in  oil in Ravenna; and it deserved the eulogium bestowed by Pope Julius II.,  who on beholding it, in 1511, declared, that the altars of Rome could boast  no pieces which surpassed it in point of beauty. The painter there left his  portrait in the figure of S. Pietro, and that of Rondinello in the S.  Bartolommeo, somewhat older; an observance shewn in those times by the  pupils towards their masters. Yet I should not here pronounce it such, as  Vasari is not only wholly silent as to his school, but omits even his name.    At Rimini, where the Malatesti spared no expense to attract the best  masters, the art of painting flourished. It was at this time that the  church of San Francesco, one of the wonders of the age, was nobly erected,  and as richly decorated. A number of artists at Rimini had succeeded Giotto  in his school; and it is to them the author of the Guide ascribes the  histories of the B. Michelina, which Vasari conceived were from Giotto's  own hand.[7] At a later period one Bitino, whose name I am happy to rescue  from oblivion, was employed at the same place; an artist not perhaps  excelled in Italy, about the year 1407, when he painted an altar-piece of  the titular saint, for the church of S. Giuliano. Around it he represented  the discovery of his body, and other facts relating to the subject;  extremely pleasing in point of invention, architecture, countenances,  draperies, and colouring.[8] Another noble production is a S. Sigismondo,  at whose feet appears Sigismondo Malatesta, with the inscription,  _Franciscus de Burgo_, _f._ 1446; and by the same hand there is the  Scourging of our Saviour. Both these paintings are seen on the wall of S.  Francesco; abounding in perspectives and _capricci_, with character  approaching so nearly to the taste of Pietro della Francesca, then living,  as to induce me to believe, that they are either by him, and that he has  thus Latinized the name of his house, or by some one of his pupils, whose  name has perished. Not such has been the fate of Benedetto Coda, of  Ferrara, who flourished at Rimini, as well as his son Bartolommeo, where  they left a number of their works. Vasari, in his life of Gio. Bellini,  makes brief mention of them, describing Benedetto as Bellini's pupil,  \"though he derived small advantage from it.\" Yet the altar-piece  representing the Marriage of the Virgin, which he placed in the cathedral,  with the inscription of _Opus Benedicti_, is a very respectable production;  while that of the Rosary, in possession of the Dominicans, is even in  better taste, though not yet modern. This, however, cannot be said of the  son, one of whose pictures I saw at S. Rocco da Pesaro, painted in 1528,  with such excellent method, as almost to remind us of the golden age. It  represents the titular saint of the church along with S. Sebastiano,  standing round the throne of the Virgin, with the addition of playful and  beautiful cherubs. Another pupil of Gio. Bellini is noticed by Ridolfi.  Lattanzio da Rimino, or Lattanzio della Marca, referred by others to the  school of Pietro Perugino, which, perhaps too, produced Gio. da Rimino, one  of whose pictures, bearing his signature, belongs to the grand Ercolani  collection at Bologna.[9]         Footnote 7: To this period belonged that _Joannes Rimerici       Pictor Arimini_, who is pointed out to us in 1386 by Count       Marco Fantuzzi, in his _Monumenti Ravennati_, vol. vi.       edited in the year 1804.         Footnote 8: In the above named volume (vi) we find mention       of the son of this distinguished man: \"_Magister Antonius       Pictor quondam Mag. Bictini Pictoris de Arimino_, 1456.\"         Footnote 9: I made a mistake in my former edition in       supposing him to have been a pupil of Bellino, who died in       1516. Concerning this Gio. who subscribed himself likewise       Gio. Francesco, we observe that Oretti, in his _Memorie_,       _MSS._, points out two pictures with the dates of 1459 and       1461. He adds, that there are accounts of his having been       living in 1470.    Forli, as far as I can learn, boasts no artist earlier than Guglielmo da  Forli, a pupil of Giotto. His paintings in fresco, conducted at the  Francescani, no longer survive, nor in the church of that order could I  meet with any specimen of the thirteenth century, besides a Crucifix by  some unknown hand. From that period, perhaps, a succession of artists  appeared, there being no scarcity of anonymous paintings from which to  conjecture such a fact; but history is silent until the time of Ansovino di  Forli, who has already been included among the pupils of Squarcione. I have  my doubts whether this artist could be the master of Melozzo, a name  venerated by artists, inasmuch as he was the first who applied the art of  foreshortening, the most difficult and the most severe, to the painting of  vaulted ceilings. Considerable progress was made in perspective after the  time of Paolo Uccello, with the aid of Piero della Francesca, a celebrated  geometrician, and of a few Lombards. But the ornamenting of ceilings with  that pleasing art and illusion, which afterwards appeared, was reserved for  Melozzo. It is observed by Scannelli, and followed by Orlandi, that in  order to acquire the art he studied the works of the best ancient artists,  and though born to fortune, he did not refuse to lodge with the masters of  his times, in quality of attendant and compounder of their colours. Some  writers give him as a pupil to Pietro della Francesca. It is at least  probable, that Melozzo was acquainted with him and with Agostino  Bramantino, when they were employed at Rome by Nicholas V., towards the  year 1455. However this may be, Melozzo painted on the ceiling of the great  chapel, at Santi Apostoli, the Ascension of our Lord, where, says Vasari,  \"the figure of Christ is so admirably foreshortened as to appear to pierce  the vault; and in the same manner the angels are seen sweeping through the  field of air in two opposite directions.\" This painting was executed for  Card. Riario, nephew to Pope Sixtus IV. about the year 1472; and when that  edifice required to undergo repairs, it was removed and placed in the  Quirinal palace in 1711; where it is still seen, bearing this inscription:  \"Opus Melotii Foroliviensis, qui summos fornices pingendi artem vel primus  invenit vel illustravit.\" Several heads of the apostles which surrounded  it, and were likewise cut away, were deposited in the Vatican palace. Taken  as a whole, he approaches Mantegna and the Paduan School nearer than any  other in point of taste; finely formed heads, fine colouring, fine  attitudes, and almost all as finely foreshortened. The light is well  disposed and graduated, the shadows are judicious, so that the figures seem  to stand out and act in that apparent space; dignity and grandeur in the  principal figure, and white drapery that encircles it; with delicacy of  hand, diligence and grace in every part. What pity that so rare a genius,  pronounced by his contemporaries \"an incomparable painter, and the  splendour of all Italy,\"[10] should not have had a correct historian to  have described his travels and his pursuits, which must have been both  arduous and interesting, before they raised him to the eminence he  attained, in being commissioned by Card. Riario to execute so great a work.

Come,     the other are considerations, when we come to have gray heads     and weak hams, moist eyes and shrunk members. We'll think on     'em then; and we'll pray and fast.       TRUE: Ay, and destine only that time of age to goodness, which our     want of ability will not let us employ in evil!       CLER: Why, then 'tis time enough.       TRUE: Yes; as if a man should sleep all the term, and think to     effect his business the last day. O, Clerimont, this time, because     it is an incorporeal thing, and not subject to sense, we mock     ourselves the fineliest out of it, with vanity and misery     indeed! not seeking an end of wretchedness, but only changing the     matter still.

CLER: What college?       TRUE: As if you knew not!       CLER: No faith, I came but from court yesterday.       TRUE: Why, is it not arrived there yet, the news? A new foundation,     sir, here in the town, of ladies, that call themselves the     collegiates, an order between courtiers and country-madams,     that live from their husbands; and give entertainment to all the     wits, and braveries of the time, as they call them: cry down, or     up, what they like or dislike in a brain or a fashion, with most     masculine, or rather hermaphroditical authority; and every day     gain to their college some new probationer.

Give me a look, give me a face,     That makes simplicity a grace;     Robes loosely flowing, hair as free:     Such sweet neglect more taketh me,     Then all the adulteries of art;     They strike mine eyes, but not my heart.       TRUE: And I am clearly on the other side: I love a good dressing     before any beauty o' the world. O, a woman is then like a     delicate garden; nor is there one kind of it; she may vary every     hour; take often counsel of her glass, and choose the best. If     she have good ears, shew them; good hair, lay it out; good     legs, wear short clothes; a good hand, discover it often;     practise any art to mend breath, cleanse teeth, repair eye-brows;     paint, and profess it.       CLER: How? publicly?       TRUE: The doing of it, not the manner: that must be private. Many     things that seem foul in the doing, do please done. A lady     should, indeed, study her face, when we think she sleeps; nor,     when the doors are shut, should men be enquiring; all is sacred     within, then.

They must not discover     how little serves, with the help of art, to adorn a great deal.     How long did the canvas hang afore Aldgate? Were the people     suffered to see the city's Love and Charity, while they were rude     stone, before they were painted and burnish'd?

CLER: O prodigy!       TRUE: And the unconscionable knave held her in complement an hour     with that reverst face, when I still look'd when she should talk     from the t'other side.       CLER: Why, thou shouldst have relieved her.       TRUE: No, faith, I let her alone, as we'll let this argument, if you     please, and pass to another. When saw you Dauphine Eugenie?       CLER: Not these three days. Shall we go to him this morning? he is     very melancholy, I hear.       TRUE: Sick of the uncle? is he? I met that stiff piece of     formality, his uncle, yesterday, with a huge turban of night-caps     on his head, buckled over his ears.       CLER: O, that's his custom when he walks abroad. He can endure no     noise, man.       TRUE: So I have heard. But is the disease so ridiculous in him as it     is made? They say he has been upon divers treaties with the     fish-wives and orange-women; and articles propounded between     them: marry, the chimney-sweepers will not be drawn in.       CLER: No, nor the broom-men: they stand out stiffly. He cannot     endure a costard-monger, he swoons if he hear one.       TRUE: Methinks a smith should be ominous.       CLER: Or any hammer-man. A brasier is not suffer'd to dwell in the     parish, nor an armourer. He would have hang'd a pewterer's prentice     once on a Shrove-tuesday's riot, for being of that trade, when the     rest were quit.       TRUE: A trumpet should fright him terribly, or the hautboys.       CLER: Out of his senses. The waights of the city have a pension of     him not to come near that ward. This youth practised on him one     night like the bell-man; and never left till he had brought him     down to the door with a long-sword: and there left him     flourishing with the air.       PAGE: Why, sir, he hath chosen a street to lie in so narrow at both     ends, that it will receive no coaches, nor carts, nor any of these     common noises: and therefore we that love him, devise to bring him     in such as we may, now and then, for his exercise, to breathe him.     He would grow resty else in his ease: his virtue would rust without     action. I entreated a bearward, one day, to come down with the     dogs of some four parishes that way, and I thank him he did;     and cried his games under master Morose's window: till he was     sent crying away, with his head made a most bleeding spectacle to     the multitude. And, another time, a fencer marchng to his prize, had     his drum most tragically run through, for taking that street in his     way at my request.       TRUE: A good wag! How does he for the bells?       CLER: O, in the Queen's time, he was wont to go out of town every     Saturday at ten o'clock, or on holy day eves. But now, by reason of     the sickness, the perpetuity of ringing has made him devise a     room, with double walls, and treble ceilings; the windows close     shut and caulk'd: and there he lives by candlelight. He turn'd away     a man, last week, for having a pair of new shoes that creak'd.     And this fellow waits on him now in tennis-court socks, or slippers     soled with wool: and they talk each to other in a trunk. See, who     comes here!       [ENTER SIR DAUPHINE EUGENIE.]       DAUP: How now! what ail you sirs? dumb?       TRUE: Struck into stone, almost, I am here, with tales o' thine     uncle. There was never such a prodigy heard of.       DAUP: I would you would once lose this subject, my masters, for my     sake. They are such as you are, that have brought me into that     predicament I am with him.       TRUE: How is that?       DAUP: Marry, that he will disinherit me; no more. He thinks, I and     my company are authors of all the ridiculous Acts and Monuments are     told of him.       TRUE: S'lid, I would be the author of more to vex him; that purpose     deserves it: it gives thee law of plaguing him. I will tell thee     what I would do. I would make a false almanack; get it printed:     and then have him drawn out on a coronation day to the Tower-wharf,     and kill him with the noise of the ordnance. Disinherit thee! he     cannot, man. Art not thou next of blood, and his sister's son?       DAUP: Ay, but he will thrust me out of it, he vows, and marry.       TRUE: How! that's a more portent. Can he endure no noise, and will     venture on a wife?       CLER: Yes: why thou art a stranger, it seems, to his best trick,     yet. He has employed a fellow this half year all over England to     hearken him out a dumb woman; be she of any form, or any     quality, so she be able to bear children: her silence is dowry     enough, he says.       TRUE: But I trust to God he has found none.       CLER: No; but he has heard of one that is lodged in the next street     to him, who is exceedingly soft-spoken; thrifty of her speech; that     spends but six words a day. And her he's about now, and shall have     her.       TRUE: Is't possible! who is his agent in the "]]]
