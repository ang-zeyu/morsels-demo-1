Cul._ p. 12.         SEALS, CURLEWS, HERONS, BITTERNS, and the PEACOCK, that noble bird,       \"the food of lovers and the meat of lords,\" were also at this time       in high fashion, when the baronial entertainments were       characterized by a grandeur and pompous ceremonial, approaching       nearly to the magnificence of royalty; there was scarcely any royal       or noble feast without PECOKKES, which were stuffed with spices and       sweet herbs, roasted and served up whole, and covered after       dressing with the skin and feathers; the beak and comb gilt, and       the tail spread, and some, instead of the feathers, covered it with       leaf gold; it was a common dish on grand occasions, and continued       to adorn the English table till the beginning of the seventeenth       century.         In Massinger's play of \"The City Madam,\" Holdfast, exclaiming       against city luxury, says, \"three fat wethers bruised, to make       sauce for a single peacock.\"         This bird is one of those luxuries which were often sought, because       they were seldom found: its scarcity and external appearance are       its only recommendation; the meat of it is tough and tasteless.         Another favourite dish at the tables of our forefathers, was a PIE       of stupendous magnitude, out of which, on its being opened, a flock       of living birds flew forth, to the no small surprise and amusement       of the guests.            \"Four-and-twenty blackbirds baked in a pie;          When the pie was open'd, the birds began to sing--          Oh! what a dainty dish--'t is fit for any king.\"         This was a common joke at an old English feast. These _animated_       pies were often introduced \"to set on,\" as Hamlet says, \"a quantity       of barren spectators to laugh;\" there is an instance of a dwarf       undergoing such an _incrustation_. About the year 1630, king       Charles and his queen were entertained by the duke and dutchess of       Buckingham, at Burleigh on the Hill, on which occasion JEFFERY       HUDSON, _the dwarf_, was served up in a cold pie.--See WALPOLE'S       _Anecdotes of Painting_, vol. ii. p. 14.         The BARON OF BEEF was another favourite and substantial support of       old English hospitality.         Among the most polished nations of the 15th and 16th centuries, the       _powdered_ (salted) _horse_, seems to have been a dish in some       esteem: _Grimalkin_ herself could not escape the undistinguishing       fury of the cook. Don Anthony of Guevera, the chronicler to Charles       V., gives the following account of a feast at which he was present.       \"I will tell you no lye, I sawe such kindes of meates eaten, as are       wont to be sene, but not eaten--_as a_ HORSE _roasted_--a CAT _in       gely_--LYZARDS in hot brothe, FROGGES fried,\" &c.         While we are thus considering the curious dishes of olden times, we       will cursorily mention the _singular diet_ of two or three nations       of antiquity, noticed by _Herodotus_, lib. iv. \"The _Androphagi_       (the cannibals of the ancient world) greedily devoured the       carcasses of their fellow-creatures; while the inoffensive _Cabri_       (a Scythian tribe) found both food and drink in the agreeable nut       of the Pontic tree. The _Lotophagi_ lived entirely on the fruit of       the _Lotus tree_. The savage _Troglodyte_ esteemed a _living       serpent_ the most delicate of all morsels; while the capricious       palate of the _Zyguntini_ preferred the _ape_ to every       thing.\"--Vide WARNER'S _Antiq. Cul._ p. 135.         \"The Romans, in the luxurious period of their empire, took five       meals a day; a breakfast (_jentaculum_;) a dinner, which was a       light meal without any formal preparation (_prandium_); a kind of       _tea_, as we should call it, between dinner and supper (_merenda_);       a supper (_caena_), which was their great meal, and commonly       consisted of two courses; the first of meats, the second, what we       call a dessert; and a posset, or something delicious after supper       (_commissatio_).\"--ADAM'S _Rom.

That the English reader may be enabled to form some idea of the       heterogeneous messes with which the Roman palate was delighted, I       introduce the following receipt from _Apicius_.         \"THICK SAUCE FOR A BOILED CHICKEN.--Put the following ingredients       into a mortar: aniseed, dried mint, and lazar-root (similar to       assafoetida), cover them with vinegar; add dates; pour in       liquamen, oil, and a small quantity of mustard seeds; reduce all to       a proper thickness with port wine warmed; and then pour this same       over your chicken, which should previously be boiled in anise-seed       water.\"         _Liquamen_ and _Garum_ were synonymous terms for the same thing;       the former adopted in the room of the latter, about the age of       _Aurelian_. It was a liquid, and thus prepared: the _guts_ of large       fish, and a variety of small fish, were put into a vessel and well       salted, and exposed to the sun till they became putrid. A liquor       was produced in a short time, which being strained off, was the       _liquamen_.--Vide LISTER _in Apicium_, p. 16, notes.         _Essence of anchovy_, as it is usually made for sale, when it has       been opened about ten days, is not much unlike the Roman       _liquamen_. See No. 433. Some suppose it was the same thing as the       Russian _Caviar_, which is prepared from the roe of the sturgeon.         The BLACK BROTH of _Lacedaemon_ will long continue to excite the       wonder of the philosopher, and the disgust of the epicure. What the       ingredients of this sable composition were, we cannot exactly       ascertain. _Jul. Pollux_ says, the Lacedaemonian black broth was       _blood_, thickened in a certain way: Dr. LISTER (_in Apicium_)       supposes it to have been _hog's blood_; if so, this celebrated       Spartan dish bore no very distant resemblance to the       _black-puddings_ of our days. It could not be a very _alluring_       mess, since a citizen of _Sybaris_ having tasted it, declared it       was no longer a matter of astonishment with him, why the _Spartans_       were so fearless of death, since any one in his senses would much       rather die, than exist on such execrable food.--Vide _Athenaeum_,       lib. iv. c. 3. When Dionysius the tyrant had tasted the _black       broth_, he exclaimed against it as miserable stuff; the cook       replied--\"It was no wonder, for the sauce was wanting.\" \"What       sauce?\" says Dionysius. The answer was,--\"_Labour and exercise,       hunger and thirst, these are the sauces we Lacedaemonians use_,\" and       they make the coarsest fare agreeable.--CICERO, 3 Tuscul.

It's a pretty good business, I calculate, and so we're going in  for it. That is,\" I hastened to add, \"if you fellows don't mind.\"    \"I'll tell you one thing, which ain't two things,\" he replied, \"and  that is you'll have to hump yerself an' get a better boat. We won't  stand to be disgraced by any such box as this. Understand?\"    \"Sure,\" I said. \"Soon as we sell some oysters we'll outfit in style.\"    \"And if you show yerself square an' the right sort,\" he went on, \"why,  you kin run with us. But if you don't\" (here his voice became stern  and menacing), \"why, it'll be the sickest day of yer life.  Understand?\"    \"Sure,\" I said.    After that and more warning and advice of similar nature, the  conversation became general, and we learned that the beds were to be  raided that very night. As they got into their boats, after an hour's  stay, we were invited to join them in the raid with the assurance of  \"the more the merrier.\"    \"Did you notice that short, Mexican-looking chap?\" Nicholas asked,  when they had departed to their various sloops. \"He's Barchi, of the  Sporting Life Gang, and the fellow that came with him is Skilling.  They're both out now on five thousand dollars' bail.\"    I had heard of the Sporting Life Gang before, a crowd of hoodlums and  criminals that terrorized the lower quarters of Oakland, and  two-thirds of which were usually to be found in state's prison for  crimes that ranged from perjury and ballot-box stuffing to murder.    \"They are not regular oyster pirates,\" Nicholas continued. \"They've  just come down for the lark and to make a few dollars. But we'll have  to watch out for them.\"    We sat in the cockpit and discussed the details of our plan till  eleven o'clock had passed, when we heard the rattle of an oar in a  boat from the direction of the _Ghost_. We hauled up our own skiff,  tossed in a few sacks, and rowed over. There we found all the skiffs  assembling, it being the intention to raid the beds in a body.    To my surprise, I found barely a foot of water where we had dropped  anchor in ten feet. It was the big June run-out of the full moon, and  as the ebb had yet an hour and a half to run, I knew that our  anchorage would be dry ground before slack water.    Mr. Taft's beds were three miles away, and for a long time we rowed  silently in the wake of the other boats, once in a while grounding  and our oar blades constantly striking bottom. At last we came upon  soft mud covered with not more than two inches of water--not enough to  float the boats. But the pirates at once were over the side, and by  pushing and pulling on the flat-bottomed skiffs, we moved steadily  along.    The full moon was partly obscured by high-flying clouds, but the  pirates went their way with the familiarity born of long practice.  After half a mile of the mud, we came upon a deep channel, up which we  rowed, with dead oyster shoals looming high and dry on either side. At  last we reached the picking grounds. Two men, on one of the shoals,  hailed us and warned us off. But the Centipede, the Porpoise, Barchi,  and Skilling took the lead, and followed by the rest of us, at least  thirty men in half as many boats, rowed right up to the watchmen.    \"You'd better slide outa this here,\" Barchi said threateningly, \"or  we'll fill you so full of holes you wouldn't float in molasses.\"    The watchmen wisely retreated before so overwhelming a force, and  rowed their boat along the channel toward where the shore should be.  Besides, it was in the plan for them to retreat.    We hauled the noses of the boats up on the shore side of a big shoal,  and all hands, with sacks, spread out and began picking. Every now and  again the clouds thinned before the face of the moon, and we could see  the big oysters quite distinctly. In almost no time sacks were filled  and carried back to the boats, where fresh ones were obtained.  Nicholas and I returned often and anxiously to the boats with our  little loads, but always found some one of the pirates coming or  going.    \"Never mind,\" he said; \"no hurry. As they pick farther and farther  away, it will take too long to carry to the boats. Then they'll stand  the full sacks on end and pick them up when the tide comes in and the  skiffs will float to them.\"    Fully half an hour went by, and the tide had begun to flood, when this  came to pass. Leaving the pirates at their work, we stole back to the  boats. One by one, and noiselessly, we shoved them off and made them  fast in an awkward flotilla. Just as we were shoving off the last  skiff, our own, one of the men came upon us. It was Barchi. His quick  eye took in the situation at a glance, and he sprang for us; but we  went clear with a mighty shove, and he was left floundering in the  water over his head. As soon as he got back to the shoal he raised his  voice and gave the alarm.    We rowed with all our strength, but it was slow going with so many  boats in tow. A pistol cracked from the shoal, a second, and a third;  then a regular fusillade began. The bullets spat and spat all about  us; but thick clouds had covered the moon, and in the dim darkness it  was no more than random firing. It was only by chance that we could be  hit.    \"Wish we had a little steam launch,\" I panted.    \"I'd just as soon the moon stayed hidden,\" Nicholas panted back.    It was slow work, but every stroke carried us farther away from the  shoal and nearer the shore, till at last the shooting died down, and  when the moon did come out we were too far away to be in danger. Not  long afterward we answered a shoreward hail, and two Whitehall boats,  each pulled by three pairs of oars, darted up to us. Charley's welcome  face bent over to us, and he gripped us by the hands while he cried,  \"Oh, you joys! You joys! Both of you!\"    When the flotilla had been landed, Nicholas and I and a watchman rowed  out in one of the Whitehalls, with Charley in the stern-sheets. Two  other Whitehalls followed us, and as the moon now shone brightly, we  easily made out the oyster pirates on their lonely shoal. As we drew  closer, they fired a rattling volley from their revolvers, and we  promptly retreated beyond range.    \"Lot of time,\" Charley said. \"The flood is setting in fast, and by the  time it's up to their necks there won't be any fight left in them.\"    So we lay on our oars and waited for the tide to do its work. This was  the predicament of the pirates: because of the big run-out, the tide  was now rushing back like a mill-race, and it was impossible for the  strongest swimmer in the world to make against it the three miles to  the sloops. Between the pirates and the shore were we, precluding  escape in that direction. On the other hand, the water was rising  rapidly over the shoals, and it was only a question of a few hours  when it would be over their heads.    It was beautifully calm, and in the brilliant white moonlight we  watched them through our night glasses and told Charley of the voyage  of the _Coal Tar Maggie_. One o'clock came, and two o'clock, and the  pirates were clustering on the highest shoal, waist-deep in water.    \"Now this illustrates the value of imagination,\" Charley was saying.  \"Taft has been trying for years to get them, but he went at it with  bull strength and failed. Now we used our heads....\"    Just then I heard a scarcely audible gurgle of water, and holding up  my hand for silence, I turned and pointed to a ripple slowly widening  out in a growing circle. It was not more than fifty feet from us. We  kept perfectly quiet and waited. After a minute the water broke six  feet away, and a black head and white shoulder showed in the  moonlight. With a snort of surprise and of suddenly expelled breath,  the head and shoulder went down.    We pulled ahead several strokes and drifted with the current. Four  pairs of eyes searched the surface of the water, but never another  ripple showed, and never another glimpse did we catch of the black  head and white shoulder.    \"It's the Porpoise,\" Nicholas said. \"It would take broad daylight for  us to catch him.\"    At a quarter to three the pirates gave their first sign of weakening.  We heard cries for help, in the unmistakable voice of the Centipede,  and this time, on rowing closer, we were not fired upon. The Centipede  was in a truly perilous plight. Only the heads and shoulders of his  fellow-marauders showed above the water as they braced themselves  against the current, while his feet were off the bottom and they were  supporting him.    \"Now, lads,\" Charley said briskly, \"we have got you, and you can't get  away. If you cut up rough, we'll have to leave you alone and the water  will finish you. But if you're good, we'll take you aboard, one man  at a time, and you'll all be saved. What do you say?\"    \"Ay,\" they chorused hoarsely between their chattering teeth.    \"Then one man at a time, and the short men first.\"    The Centipede was the first to be pulled aboard, and he came  willingly, though he objected when the constable put the handcuffs on  him. Barchi was next hauled in, quite meek and resigned from his "]]]
