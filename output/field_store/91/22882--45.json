Let the nation stand back at the peril of their chief magistrate!\"    Now the Mystery swung ahead, until she was abreast of the high warship,  any one of whose lowering guns would have gladly shattered her if it had  dared.    When the execrable vessel came to a halt, and breathless and dignified  faces peered upon her decks from above, a sudden bustle was observed.  From below there mounted slowly his excellency the President of the  United States, attended by the first lady of the land. Both looked pale  and anxious, but bore signs of powerful self-restraint. At sight of the  revered couple, the man-of-war's crew could not control themselves, and  set up a mighty cheer. This was caught up from ship to ship, from shore  to height. Flags were hauled aloft. Guns were discharged. A pandemonium  of joy set in. Behind the captured couple two men in black walked, each  with a cocked revolver. The honored pair reclined on steamer chairs in  full view of their people. The world knew now that they were safe and  nearly home. Greetings were exchanged between Cabinet and Chief. Even  war-scarred veterans could not choke down the rising apple in their  throats.    Again there was a hush. A figure now stepped from a forward hatchway on  deck of the _Mary Jane_, walked up to the captured couple, and bowed  low. This salute was succeeded by a courteous recognition of the  impatient crowd above on board the _Washington_. As the unknown raised  his silk hat for the second time, he stood directly in line with the  Secretary of State. The Secretary of State and Col. Oddminton regarded  each other. Bystanders started in surprise. The resemblance between the  two men was deeply suggestive of the success of the plot. The villain  had the same noble brow, the same delicate complexion, the same  incomparable whiskers. But, alas! he was bald on the top of his head.  The Secretary involuntarily stroked his own luxuriant crown with a sigh  of relief.    \"Gentlemen, representatives of these United States,\" said the Colonel  slowly, \"I have faithfully fulfilled my part of the contract. Do you  yours. I will come aboard and inspect the ransom. Then it may be lowered  down, and the President is free. I have not long to stay.\" In the  meanwhile, so intent were all eyes upon the star actors of this scene,  it was not noticed that men were busily engaged at stem and stern of  the unshipshape-looking steamer.    Hands worked deftly at masts and funnel.    After a few minutes, during which the expectant couple sat with as much  comfort as one can before loaded pistols, the ransom was inspected, the  Colonel satisfied. Eighty bags of gold were carefully lowered to the  pirate craft.    As the Colonel descended alone to his own deck he motioned with his  hand. Immediately the pistols were flung into the water. The seamen in  black fell back as a guard of honor. The Colonel, with Southern grace  and British dignity, extended his arm to the distinguished and trembling  hostage. This she did not refuse and he led her to the cream-white  companionway that now reached from the _Washington_ to the _Mary Jane_.  The marines presented arms. The women sobbed. Then came the President.  When his foot touched his own deck there thundered forth a salute of  twenty-one guns from the American navy. Whistles blew, flags and  handkerchiefs fluttered, and mad salvos rent the air from subjects that  any sovereign would gladly call his own.    The President now looked down with sad curiosity upon his former prison.  But there strange things had happened. The caterpillar had cast off its  chrysalis, and the incomparable butterfly appeared. Where was the  smokestack? Where were the masts? Where was the _Mary Jane_? A load  seemed to fall from stem to stern, and there appeared beneath dingy  paint a sheer which a king might long to possess. This was the crowning  surprise. Naval officers now recognized for the first time the nautical  marvel which had deluded the nation. The Colonel stood alone upon the  deck of the transfigured boat. With uncovered head he spoke. His left  hand grasped the wheel.    \"Mr. President--I have guarded you safely, and treated you as well as  circumstances could permit. Your patience in adversity, and that of your  wife, have compelled my reverence. You were but the scapegoat of a  nation. This country can never afford to be careless of its defences and  of the treasures which they protect. People of America! You regard me as  the chief malefactor of your times. The day may come when you will call  me its greatest benefactor. To-day you execrate me. To-morrow you may  bless me. I have taught you a solemn and a costly lesson, but the price  of such wisdom is cheap. Good-morning!\"    There was no opening, but the hawsers were suddenly cut. There was a  rush and billows of foam. As a cat plays here and there in her pretty  antics the \"_Lightning_\" (for a blow of the hammer on the stern had  annihilated the _Mary Jane_) wound in and out at an unequal rate. When  she turned, she careened far over on her side. The water lapped the  Colonel's feet. Who could stop her? Who could overtake her? At the first  shock the gunners stood motionless, then sprang to their guns. The  President, Commander-in-chief of the army and navy, raised his hand and  shook his head.    The faith of the nation was pledged, and the pirate escaped without a  shot. The incredible speed of the _Lightning_ increased. It became  terrific. Nothing like it had ever been witnessed in maritime history.  Spectators stood with held breath.    A lieutenant in his excitement shouted: \"For God's sake, overtake her!\"    The crowd yelled: \"Run them down! See where they go!\"    But the navy of the United States might as well have chased a cannon  ball. The mental pressure became tremendous. Spectators had hardly drawn  a breath when the miracle was hull down. The American love of audacity  and speed struggled mightily for the moment with American patriotism.  The moral sense of the people could not prevent a murmur of admiration  when the _Lightning_, with eight millions of national gold aboard, in  less than nine minutes was but a speck. A bend of the river, and the  mysterious, courtly and successful pirate was gone.          THE LOST CITY.          I.      \"Great guns!\" The ejaculator tipped his straw hat off with his left  hand, let it roll upon the office floor, made a dab for a damp pocket  handkerchief in his right pistol pocket, and stared at the yellow paper  again. \"Whew! I don't believe it!\" he muttered. Then, aware that the  keen eyes of the three-and-a-half-foot messenger boy were upon him, as  if sizing him up for news, he stared at the telegram again, mumbled  \"It's a fake! Great guns!\" and rushed from the room.    The messenger boy looked after the editor's retreating form with a  knowing wink, as if the whole thing had been a special job put up by  himself, whistled \"Annie Rooney,\" took up a tattered copy of \"Famous  Quotations,\" laid it down again with an expression of mingled respect  and scepticism, characteristic of his kind, and then swaggered out of  the editorial sanctum.    \"Well, Swift, what's up now?\"    The editor-in-chief of the _Daily Planet_ (Democratic) lifted his young,  alert face from the evening edition of his own journal to that of his  news editor. Interruptions were the expected thing in that stirring  office.    Swift did not speak, but laid the telegram upon the desk, pulled out a  Victoria Regina, and chewed it nervously. The chief read the message  through once to himself, gave one glance at the face of his subordinate,  and then said:    \"This is a repeat, is it not?\"    \"Yes sir. First news came three hours ago. I didn't believe it. Thought  it a fake. Half think so still. I wouldn't insert it, and wired for an  immediate reply. Here it is. It is too late for the five o'clock  edition. What shall I do?\"    \"Well, this _is_ extraordinary!\" conceded the chief. This admission  meant a great deal in that office, deluged with news from all parts of  the world, where it frequently happened that fourteen columns of  purchased and paid for telegraphic despatches were not considered  important enough to use, and were dropped in the waste-paper basket. The  chief pressed the button in his desk and asked the boy that appeared to  inform Mr. Ticks that he was wanted at once.    Mr. Stalls Ticks answered the summons promptly. He was a sallow, faded,  middle-aged man, dressed in a sere and faded Prince Albert coat, with  sallow and faded boots. In fact, the whole appearance of this invaluable  member of the _Planet_ corps gave one the impression of the last minute  of autumn, when even the trunks of the trees, the stones of the hills,  the soil of the valleys look sere and yellow and faded and ready for a  winter's sleep. Mr. Ticks looked as if he were waiting for the trance  that never overcame him.    \"I wish to know something of Russell, the capital of the new State of  Harrison, Mr. Ticks.\"    Mr. Ticks pulled out a yellow, faded, silk bandanna, wiped his  spectacles sadly, and with an over-aspirated tone asked:    \"Yes, sir?\"    Mr. Swift looked at him with mingled disgust and respect, and tapped his  foot impatiently on the bare floor.    \"Let me see; it is situated?\" proceeded the chief quietly.    \"On the southeast shore of the Great Gopher lake.\" Mr. Ticks finished  the sentence mechanically.    \"Ah! I remember. Its population?\"    \"Twenty-nine thousand five hundred and fifty-two. It increases at the  rate of thirty a day.\"    \"Exactly so! It is--?\"    \"Just two years nine months and twelve days old.\"    \"To be sure. Its property--?\"    \"Is one hundred and sixty-four million dollars, in round numbers.\"    \"Of course. Its industries are--?\"    \"The usual pertaining to Western cities, I suppose. I confess ignorance  to concrete particulars. The reports have been singularly deficient in "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33687"],[0,"Illustrative Anecdotes of the Animal Kingdom (#7)"],[1,"and vivid that it has more the appearance of art than nature. Its body  and limbs are covered with long hairs of the purest white, and of a  shining and silvery brightness: the tail is of a deep chestnut color,  very glistening, and considerably longer than the body. This animal is  somewhat larger than the striated monkey. It is an inhabitant of South  America, and is frequently to be met with on the banks of the Amazon.    The following circumstance, exhibiting the fickleness of the fair  monkey, was communicated to Mr. Bewick by Sir John Trevelyan. \"Pug was  a gentleman of excellent humor, and adored by the crew; and, to make  him perfectly happy, as they imagined, they procured him a wife. For  some weeks he was a devoted husband, and showed her every attention and  respect. He then grew cool, and became jealous of any kind of civility  shown her by the master of the vessel, and began to use her with much  cruelty. His treatment made her wretched and dull; though she bore the  spleen of her husband with that fortitude which is characteristic of  the female sex of the human species. Pug, however, like the lords of  creation, was up to deceit, and practised pretended kindness to his  spouse, to effect a diabolical scheme, which he seemed to premeditate.  One morning, when the sea ran very high, he seduced her aloft, and drew  her observation to an object at some distance from the yard-arm; her  attention being fixed, he all of a sudden applied his paw to her rear,  and canted her into the sea, where she fell a victim to his cruelty.  This seemed to afford him high gratification, for he descended in great  spirits.\"    _A Trick._--In 1818, a vessel that sailed between Whitehaven, in  England, and Jamaica, embarked on her homeward voyage, and, among other  passengers, carried Mrs. B., and an infant five weeks old. One  beautiful afternoon, the captain perceived a distant sail; and, after  he had gratified his curiosity, he politely offered the glass to the  lady, that she might obtain a clear view of the object. She had the  baby in her arms, but now she wrapped her shawl about it, and placed it  on a sofa, upon which she had been sitting.    Scarcely had she applied her eye to the glass, when the helmsman  exclaimed, \"See what the mischievous monkey has done!\" The reader may  judge of the mother's feelings, when, on turning round, she beheld the  animal in the act of transporting her child apparently up to the top of  the mast. The monkey was a very large one, and so strong and active,  that, while it grasped the infant firmly with one arm, it climbed the  shrouds nimbly by the other, totally unembarrassed by the weight of its  burden.    One look was enough for the terrified mother; and had it not been for  the assistance of those around her, she would have fallen prostrate on  the deck, where she was soon afterwards stretched, apparently a  lifeless corpse. The sailors could climb as well as the monkey, but the  latter watched their motions narrowly; and, as it ascended higher up  the mast the moment they attempted to put a foot on the shroud, the  captain became afraid that it would drop the child, and endeavor to  escape by leaping from one mast to another.    In the mean time, the little innocent was heard to cry; and though many  thought it was suffering pain, their fears on this point were speedily  dissipated, when they observed the monkey imitating exactly the motions  of a nurse, by dandling, soothing, and caressing, its charge, and even  endeavoring to hush it to sleep.    From the deck, the lady was conveyed to the cabin, and gradually  restored to her senses. In the mean time, the captain ordered the men  to conceal themselves carefully below, and quietly took his own station  on the cabin stairs, where he could see all that passed, without being  seen. The plan happily succeeded. The monkey, on perceiving that the  coast was clear, cautiously descended from his lofty perch, and  replaced the infant on the sofa, cold, fretful, and perhaps frightened,  but, in every other respect, as free from harm as when he took it up.  The captain had now a most grateful office to perform; the babe was  restored to its mother's arms, amidst tears, and thanks, and blessings.    _A Tragedy in the Woods._--An Englishman travelling in India tells  the following interesting, though painful, story:--    \"I was strolling through a wood, with my gun on my shoulders, my  thoughts all centred in Europe, when I heard a curious noise in a tree  above me. I looked up, and found that the sounds proceeded from a white  monkey, who skipped from branch to branch, chattering with delight at  beholding a 'fellow-creature,' for so he decidedly seemed to consider  me. For a few moments I took no notice of his antics, and walked  quietly along, till suddenly a large branch fell at my feet, narrowly  escaping my head. I again paused, and found that the missile had been  dropped by my talkative friend. Without consideration, I instantly  turned round and fired at him.    \"The report had scarcely sounded, when I heard the most piercing, the  most distressing cry, that ever reached my ears. An agonized shriek,  like that of a young infant, burst from the little creature that I had  wounded. It was within thirty paces of me. I could see the wretched  animal, already stained with blood, point to its wound, and again hear  its dreadful moan.    \"The agony of a hare is harrowing, and I have seen a young sportsman  turn pale on hearing it. The present cry was, however, more  distressing. I turned round, and endeavored to hurry away. This,  however, I found no easy task; for, as I moved forward, the unhappy  creature followed me, springing as well as he could from bough to  bough, uttering a low, wailing moan, and pointing at the same time to  the spot whence the blood trickled. Then, regarding me steadily and  mournfully in the face, it seemed to reproach me with my wanton  cruelty. Again I hastened on, but still it pursued me. Never, in my  life, did I feel so much for a dumb animal: never did I so keenly  repent an act of uncalled-for barbarity.    \"Determined not to allow the poor monkey thus to linger in torture, and  at once to end the annoying scene, I suddenly came to a halt; and,  lowering my gun, which was only single-barrelled, I was about to reload  it for the purpose of despatching the maimed creature, when, springing  from a tree, it ran up to within a dozen paces of me, and began to cry  so piteously, and roll itself in agony, occasionally picking up earth,  with which it attempted to stanch the blood by stuffing it into the  wound, that, in spite of my resolution, when I fired, I was so nervous,  I almost missed my aim, inflicting another wound, which broke the  animal's leg, but nothing more. Again, its piercing shriek rang in my  ears. Horrified beyond endurance, I threw down my gun, and actually  fled.    \"In about half an hour, I returned, for the purpose of getting my gun,  fully expecting that the poor animal had left the spot. What, then, was  my surprise, to find a crowd of monkeys surrounding the wretched  sufferer, and busily employed in tearing open its wounds! A shout drove  them all away, except the dying animal. I advanced. The little creature  was rolling in agony. I took up my gun, which lay beside him, and  fancied he cast one look of supplication on me--one prayer to be  relieved from his misery. I did not hesitate; with one blow of the  butt-end, I dashed out his brains. Then turning round, I slowly  returned to my quarters, more profoundly dispirited than I had felt for  many months.--Take my advice, reader; if you must live in India, never  shoot a monkey.\"    _Miscellaneous Anecdotes._--We are told of a king of Egypt who was so  successful in training monkeys to the art of dancing, that they were  long admired for the dexterity and gracefulness of their movements. On  one occasion, his majesty had a ball, at which a vast number of these  animals \"tripped it on the light, fantastic toe.\" A citizen, who  enjoyed fun, threw a few handfuls of walnuts into the ball-room, while  these picturesque animals were engaged in a high dance, upon which they  forgot all decorum, and sprang to the booty.    A monkey, which was kept on board a British frigate, was the favorite  of all on board but the midshipmen. This animal knew well of a large  store of apples being in a locker in the wardroom, which was kept  constantly secure, in consequence of his propensity for plundering it.  He, however, fell upon ways and means to secure his booty. He procured  a piece of wadding, swung himself from the stern gallery by one hand,  and, with this in the other, broke a pane of glass in the wardroom  window; and, after carefully picking out all the broken pieces of  glass, made his entrance, where he gorged himself so fully, that he was  unable to effect his retreat by the place where he entered. He was  caught in the fact, and soundly flogged.    A singular piece of ingenuity was once practised by a monkey, in  defending himself against fire-arms. This animal belonged to Captain  M----, of the navy, who had also another small monkey, of which he was  very fond, from its lively playfulness. The larger animal was often  exceedingly troublesome, and could not be driven from his cabin,  without _blazing_ at him with a pistol loaded with powder and currant  jelly,--a discharge which produced a painful and alarming effect. The  old monkey was at first astounded at the sight of the weapon, which  stung him so sore, that he at last learned a mode of defence; for,  snatching up the little favorite, he used to interpose him as a shield  between the pistol and his body.    In one of his excursions, Le Vaillant killed a female monkey, which  carried a young one on her back. The latter continued to cling to her  dead parent till they reached their evening quarters; and the  assistance of a negro was even then required to disengage it."]]]
