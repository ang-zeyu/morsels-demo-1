He used, indeed, to  compose with surprising rapidity: but he had none of the carelessness  of a rapid composer; for so delicate was his sense of the beautiful,  that he was never satisfied with any one of his productions until it  had received all the perfection he could give it by the most minute  and elaborate correction. Ever striving after higher and higher  degrees of excellence, and existing only for his art, he scarcely  suffered even the visible approach of death to withdraw him for a  moment from his beloved studies. During the last moments of his life,  though weak in body, he was 'full of the god;' and his application,  though indefatigable, could not keep pace with his invention. 'Il  Flauta [Transcriber's Note: Flauto] Magico,' 'La Clemenza di Tito,'  and a 'Requiem' which he had hardly time to finish, were among his  last efforts. The composition of the 'Requiem,' in the decline of his  bodily powers, and under great mental excitement, hastened his  dissolution. He was seized with repeated fainting-fits, brought on by  his extreme assiduity in writing, in one of which he expired. A few  hours before his death took place, he is reported to have said, 'Now I  begin to see what might be done in music.'\"    [Footnote 5: In the Library of Entertaining Knowledge, vol. iii. p.  76.]    Mozart's compositions number over six hundred, and two hundred of them  had not until quite recently been printed. He composed fifty-three  works for the church, a hundred and eighteen for orchestra, twenty-six  operas and cantatas, a hundred and fifty-four songs, forty-nine  concertos, sixty-two piano-forte pieces, and seventeen pieces for the  organ.    Of Beethoven, Professor F.L. Ritter, in one of his excellent lectures  on music, says, \"Beethoven's compositions appeal to the whole being of  the listener. They captivate the whole soul, and, for the time being,  subdue it to an intense, powerful, poetical influence, impressing it  with melancholy, sorrow, and sadness, elevating it heavenwards in  hopeful joy and inspired happiness.\"    The following description[6] of Beethoven's last hours on earth, as he  was nearing the time         \"When all of genius which can perish dies,\"    although replete with sadness, is yet a tribute so touchingly  beautiful and eloquent as to make it well worthy of insertion here.    [Footnote 6: Anonymously contributed to the Boston Folio for May,  1877.]         \"THE LAST MOMENTS OF BEETHOVEN.         \"He had but one happy moment in his life, and that moment       killed him.         \"He lived in poverty, driven into solitude by the contempt       of the world, and by the natural bent of a disposition       rendered harsh, almost savage, by the injustice of his       contemporaries. But he wrote the sublimest music that ever       man or angel dreamed. He spoke to mankind in his divine       language, and they disdained to listen to him. He spoke to       them as Nature speaks in the celestial harmony of the winds,       the waves, the singing of the birds amid the woods.       Beethoven was a prophet, and his utterance was from God.         \"And yet was his talent so disregarded, that he was destined       more than once to suffer the bitterest agony of the poet,       the artist, the musician. He doubted his own genius.         \"Haydn himself could find for him no better praise than in       saying, 'He was a clever pianist.'         \"Thus was it said of Gericault, 'He blends his colors well;'       and thus of Goethe, 'He has a tolerable style, and he       commits no faults in orthography.'         \"Beethoven had but one friend, and that friend was Hummel.       But poverty and injustice had irritated him, and he was       sometimes unjust himself. He quarrelled with Hummel, and for       a long time they ceased to meet. To crown his misfortunes,       he became completely deaf.         \"Then Beethoven retired to Baden, where he lived, isolated       and sad, in a small house that scarcely sufficed for his       necessities. There his only pleasure was in wandering amid       the green alleys of a beautiful forest in the neighborhood       of the town. Alone with the birds and the wild flowers, he       would then suffer himself to give scope to his genius, to       compose his marvellous symphonies, to approach the gates of       heaven with melodious accents, and to speak aloud to angels       that language which was too beautiful for human ears, and       which human ears had failed to comprehend.         \"But in the midst of his solitary dreaming a letter arrived,       which brought him back, despite himself, to the affairs of       the world, where new griefs awaited him.         \"A nephew whom he had brought up, and to whom he was       attached by the good offices which he had himself performed       for the youth, wrote to implore his uncle's presence at       Vienna. He had become implicated in some disastrous       business, from which his elder relative alone could release       him.         \"Beethoven set off upon his journey, and, compelled by the       necessity of economy, accomplished part of the distance on       foot. One evening he stopped before the gate of a small,       mean-looking house, and solicited shelter. He had already       several leagues to traverse before reaching Vienna, and his       strength would not enable him to continue any longer on the       road.         \"They received him with hospitality: he partook of their       supper, and then was installed in the master's chair by the       fireside.         \"When the table was cleared, the father of the family arose,       and opened an old clavecin. The three sons took each a       violin, and the mother and daughter occupied themselves in       some domestic work.         \"The father gave the key-note, and all four began playing       with that unity and precision, that innate genius, which is       peculiar only to the people of Germany. It seemed that they       were deeply interested in what they played; for their whole       souls were in the instruments. The two women desisted from       their occupation to listen, and their gentle countenances       expressed the emotions of their hearts.         \"To observe all this was the only share that Beethoven could       take in what was passing; for he did not hear a single note.       He could only judge of their performance from the movements       of the executants, and the fire that animated their       features.         \"When they had finished they shook each other's hands       warmly, as if to congratulate themselves on a community of       happiness; and the young girl threw herself weeping into her       mother's arms. Then they appeared to consult together: they       resumed their instruments; they commenced again. This time       their enthusiasm reached its height; their eyes were filled       with tears, and the color mounted to their cheeks.         \"'My friends,' said Beethoven, 'I am very unhappy that I can       take no part in the delight which you experience; for I also       love music: but, as you see, I am so deaf that I cannot hear       any sound. Let me read this music which produces in you such       sweet and lively emotions.'         \"He took the paper in his hand: his eyes grew dim, his       breath came short and fast; then he dropped the music, and       burst into tears.         \"These peasants had been playing the allegretto of       Beethoven's Symphony in A.         \"The whole family surrounded him with signs of curiosity and       surprise.         \"For some moments his convulsive sobs impeded his utterance;       then he raised his head, and said, 'I am Beethoven.'         \"And they uncovered their heads, and bent before him in       respectful silence. Beethoven extended his hands to them,       and they pressed them, kissed, wept over them; for they knew       that they had amongst them a man who was greater than a       king.         \"Beethoven held out his arms, and embraced them all,--the       father, the mother, the young girl, and her three brothers.         \"All at once he rose up, and, sitting down to the clavecin,       signed to the young men to take up their violins, and       himself performed the piano part of his _chef-d'oeuvre_.       The performers were alike inspired: never was music more       divine or better executed. Half the night passed away thus,       and the peasants listened. Those were the last accents of       the swan.         \"The father compelled him to accept his own bed; but, during       the night, Beethoven was restless and fevered. He rose: he       needed air: he went forth with naked feet into the country.       All nature was exhaling a majestic harmony; the winds       sighing through the branches of the trees, and moaning along       the avenues and glades of the wood. He remained some hours       wandering thus amid the cool dews of the early morning; but,       when he returned to the house, he was seized with an icy       chill. They sent to Vienna for a physician. Dropsy on the       chest was found to have declared itself; and in two days,       despite every care and skill, the doctor said Beethoven must       die.         \"And, in truth, life was every instant ebbing fast from him.         \"As he lay upon his bed, pale and suffering, a man entered.       It was Hummel,--Hummel, his old and only friend. He had       heard of the illness of Beethoven, and he came to him with       succor and money. But it was too late: Beethoven was       speechless; and a grateful smile was all that he had to       bestow upon his friend.         \"Hummel bent towards him, and, by the air of an acoustic       instrument, enabled Beethoven to hear a few words of his       compassion and regret.         \"Beethoven seemed re-animate"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28057"],[0,"Highways and Byways in Surrey (#7)"],[1," him sitting through a sunny morning writing gently about the  shortcomings of Mrs. Hooker, how she made her poor husband tend the  sheep and rock the cradle; or setting down the superb last sentences of  the Life, and then taking down his fishing rod and wandering down by the  Wey after trout and chub. Perhaps, indeed, he could get a salmon. Among  the dues collected by the Bailiffs of the Borough early in the  seventeenth century I find the following----        \"Of every fishmonger that selleth ffish at his window in the lent to      paye at good ffriday a good lb. of samon or of the beast ffish they      have then leaft.\"    The salmon, presumably, swam with the other \"beast ffish\" in the Wey.    [Illustration: _Cobbett's Birthplace at Farnham._]    Farnham's greatest man was not an ecclesiastic, but a politician.  William Cobbett, soldier, farmer, Radical, editor of _Peter Porcupine_  and the _Weekly Political Register_, and author of a diary unequalled of  its kind in English writing, was born at Farnham on March 9, 1762. The  house in which he was born, once a farmhouse and now the Jolly Farmer  inn, stands on the outskirts of the town near the Wey, conspicuous with  a white gable. As a boy, he must have been one of the busiest on any  farm in the neighbourhood. His father used to boast that he had four  boys, of whom the eldest was only fifteen years old--William Cobbett was  the third--and yet that they would do as much work as any three men in  Farnham. \"When I first trudged a field,\" you read in the _The Life of  William Cobbett, by Himself_, \"with my satchel swung over my shoulder, I  was hardly able to climb the gates and stiles, and at the close of day,  to reach home was a task of infinite difficulty.\" He was taught the  beginnings of farming at Farnham, and he first ran away from Farnham to  be a gardener. He was employed as a boy in the castle grounds, and there  he met a man who was a gardener at Kew. They talked, and the  eleven-year-old boy was fired to see for himself what gardening could  be. Next day he started off, with sixpence-halfpenny in his pocket, and  walked all day till he came to Richmond. There he should have had  supper; he had threepence left to get it with. But threepence was  exactly the price of a little book, _The Tale of a Tub_, which he spied  in a bookseller's window. He bought it, took it into a field near Kew  Gardens, and sat down to read; read on till it was dark, tumbled to  sleep under a haystack, and woke to ask the head gardener for work. He  was given work, but the gardener persuaded him to return home. Ten years  later he ran away from Farnham again, and for the last time. He was out  on the road to meet some friends on the way to Guildford Fair; the  London coach swung by, he swung up behind, and by nine that night was in  London with half-a-crown in his pocket. He left London for a soldier,  and his Farnham boyhood was over.    Riding by Farnham forty years after, Cobbett showed his son the spot  where he received his education. It was easily come by, but he was of  opinion that if he had not had it, \"if I had been brought up a milksop,  with a nurserymaid everlastingly at my heels, I should have been this  day as great a fool, as inefficient a mortal, as any of those frivolous  idiots that are turned out from Winchester and Westminster School, or  from any of those dens of dunces called Colleges and Universities.\" The  spot is a sandy bank above the Bourne, a little stream, dry in summer,  which runs a mile south of Farnham, from Holt Forest to the Wey. This is  the education, described in _Rural Rides_:--        \"There is a little hop-garden in which I used to work when from      eight to ten years old; from which I have scores of times run to      follow the hounds, leaving the hoe to do the best that it could to      destroy the weeds; but the most interesting thing was a _sand-hill_,      which goes from a part of the heath down to the rivulet. As a due      mixture of pleasure with toil, I, with two brothers, used      occasionally to _disport_ ourselves, as the lawyers call it, at this      sand-hill. Our diversion was this: we used to go to the top of the      hill, which was steeper than the roof of a house; one used to draw      his arms out of the sleeves of his smock-frock, and lay himself down      with his arms by his sides; and then the others, one at head, and      the other at feet, sent him rolling down the hill like a barrel or a      log of wood. By the time he got to the bottom, his hair, eyes, ears,      nose, and mouth were all full of this loose sand; then the others      took their turn, and at every roll there was a monstrous spell of      laughter.\"    [Illustration: _Weydon Mill, Farnham._]    When will _Rural Rides_ be added to the cheap editions? No other book  of the open air and open politics mixes the two with such a breezy grip  as Cobbett's. One rides with the sturdy old man over the road which he  thought the prettiest in England--the four miles between Guildford and  Godalming--or across \"the most villainous spot God ever made,\" which was  Hindhead, and listens to him praising the bean fields and the turnips  here, and the oaks and acacias there, cursing the Wen-devils and  place-men and pensioners, the reptiles, toad-eaters and tax-eaters, and  yet the sheer honesty and affection of the man shine from every page.  There never was such a mixture of execration and the scent of  bean-blossom. But _Rural Rides_ remains a book of the library rather  than the bookshelf.    Farnham has two other authors, one a native and one a friend. Miss Ada  Bayly, known to her readers as Edna Lyall, made Farnham her holiday home  since she was four years old, and set the scenes of two of her novels in  the town. Even better known by his work, if not by his name, is Augustus  Toplady, the author of the hymn, \"Rock of Ages.\" Toplady was born in a  little house in West Street, now pulled down, in 1740. He wrote much  that was bitter; all that is remembered is his hymn.    Every town on the Portsmouth road has its old coaching inn, and  Farnham's is the Bush. It stands modestly aloof; you must walk under an  arch to finds its oldest walls and its wistaria. It was not always the  best inn in Farnham. In 1604, in the account of the Borough, the  receipts of the Bailiffs are thus recorded:--        \"Dewes which hath bene payed accostomly paied to the Baylleffs of      the Borrough and Towne of Farneham, beyond the memory of any man      that now liveth as Aniale rents always as followeth:--        For the 4 Inns                               28s      That to saye of the Georg                     7s          of the Whit Hart                          7s          of the Anteolop                           7s          of the Crown                              7s      Of every alhouse within the Borough           2s      Of every alhouse out of the Borough          12d      Of every alhouse at the chosing of the        Bayleffs, called knowledge money            1d      Of every alhouse as will unlisensed or        licinsed at every ffayr day every        on of them                                  1d.\"    The Bush is not mentioned by name; it was a mere alehouse. Soon it  became a full-grown inn, and the Georg, the Whit Hart and the Anteolop  paled their ineffectual hearths.    [Illustration: _Oasthouses near Farnham._]    Farnham was once the greatest market in England for wheat. Now the chief  industry is hops. Farnham hops are some of the best grown, and have  always fetched long prices. In Cobbett's day, Kentish hops averaged five  pounds a hundredweight, and Hampshire hops were about the same price;  Farnham hops fetched seven pounds. English hops to-day average perhaps  less than five pounds a hundred, and the hopgrower is in distress.  Eighty years ago he was being ruined. Cobbett makes up his accounts,  writing at Chilworth on Sept. 25, 1822:--        \"The crop of hops has been very fine here, as well as every where      else. The crop not only large, but good in quality. They expect to      get _six_ pounds a hundred for them at Weyhill Fair. That is _one_      more than I think they will get. The best Sussex hops were selling      in the Borough of Southwark at three pounds a hundred a few days      before I left London. The Farnham hops _may_ bring double that      price; but that, I think, is as much as they will: and this is ruin      to the hop-planter. The _tax_, with its attendant inconveniences,      amounts to a pound a hundred; the picking, drying, and bagging to      50s. The carrying to market not less than 5s. Here is the sum of L3      10s. of the money. Supposing the crop to be half a ton to the acre,      the bare tillage will be 10s. The poles for an acre cannot cost less      than L2 a year; that is another 4s. to each hundred of hops. This      brings the outgoings to 82s. Then comes the manure, then come the      poor-rates, and road-rates, and county-rates; and if these leave one      single farthing for _rent_ I think it is strange.\"    Hop-buyers and sellers in those days met in the old Market House, and  were doubtless familiar with the queer inscription, still remembered by  middle-aged Farnham farmers. John Clark built the Market House in 1566,  and wrote on it his riddle:--        \"You who don't like me, give money to mend me,      You who do like me, give money to end me.\"    The Local Board of 1866, looking round for some worthy object on which  to spend their money, liked the old house so well that they ended its  existence on the spot.    No parish church is more difficult to drive up to than St. Andrew's at  Farnham. If you know the way you can come to a corner of the churchyard  by a side street, but Farnham goes to church chiefly by alleys and  footpaths. The churchyard is more striking than the church, much of  which is new. The thick turf, shaven and level, runs to the foot of  mossy brick walls; an"]]]
