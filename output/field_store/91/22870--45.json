Reflexes, both superficial and deep  ones, are also completely abolished at this period of the poisoning  process, and the nerves of special sense do not react against any, even  the strongest possible stimulation. The eye stares vacantly into a  glaring light held close before it, and the widely dilated pupil shows  no sign of reaction. The ear also appears deaf to any noise, and strong  ammonia vapour is inhaled through the nose like the purest air, whilst  pricking, beating, and even burning the skin elicit not a quiver of a  muscle.    Feoktistow's experiments with regard to reflexes, more especially their  restoration by strychnine, differ in their results entirely from  Australian observations. Whilst we have no difficulty in restoring them  with the drug on man as well as the domestic animals, his experiments on  frogs were a failure, and merely showed a decided antagonism between the  two poisons. He did not succeed in restoring the reflexes, and, instead  of following up with experiments on the higher animals, he trusted  implicitly to his results on frogs, and thus lost his opportunity.      G. Irregularities in the Action of Snake-poison.    There is in the whole range of toxicology not a single condition known  to us in which the symptoms, both in chronological order and in their  strength and relation to each other, show as much variety as those of  snake-poison. Experienced observers will agree with the writer that it  is but rarely we find two cases of snakebite exactly alike in the  symptoms they present. Some of these puzzling variations have already  been alluded to, but it is necessary to consider them a little more in  detail. Apart from quantitative differences in the poison imparted, they  arise principally from the strange capriciousness with which the poison  concentrates its action on special nerve centres and leaves others  comparatively intact.    The nearest approach to regularity and orderly sequence of the symptoms,  as described in the foregoing pages, we find in Australia after the bite  of the tiger snake (_Hoplocephalus curtus_) and the brown snake  (_Diemenia superciliosa_), more especially that of Queensland. Here we  can trace the action of the poison distinctly from centre to centre,  from the lowest part of the anterior cornua up to the cortex cerebri,  and even throughout the sympathetic ganglia as far as they are patent to  observation. The poison of these snakes is extremely diffusible and  quickly absorbed. It spreads with rapidity and nearly equal force over  all the motor centres, the symptoms following each other so quickly as  almost to appear simultaneous, though, in reality, successive. But even  the poison of these snakes leaves the arms only slightly paretic, when  paralysis in all the other voluntary muscles is well pronounced, and  does not paralyse them until coma has set in. It also touches the  respiratory centre but slightly. Sometimes coma is light and the  patients can be roused for a little while, at other times it is deep and  lasts till death. But even greater variations are observed occasionally.  In one very extraordinary case of tiger snakebite, the patient, a child  of 9 years, remained conscious to the last, and after vomiting blood  freely died under symptoms of heart failure. In rare cases the symptoms  resemble those of cobra poison.    If we turn from these to the black snake (_Pseudechis porphyriacus_) a  different picture presents itself. Its poison does not produce so deep a  coma and often none at all. The patients generally feel drowsy and fall  asleep, but are easily roused and sometimes awake spontaneously. There  is also not the same amount of muscular paralysis. They are frequently  able to walk a few steps with assistance and can move in bed, the arms  especially being almost free from paresis. But the insidious poison none  the less does its work, though its effects are less patent. It  concentrates its action on the vaso-motor centre. The victims from hour  to hour become more anaemic in appearance through increasing engorgement  of the abdominal veins. Anaemia of the nerve-centres hastens the  collapse, and from the combined effects of this and heart failure death  takes place suddenly and quickly as if in a fainting fit. Here then we  have an approach to the effects of viper poison which is also shown in  the greater amount of swelling and effusion around the bite and in the  bitten limb.    This approach is still closer in the poison of the death adder  (_Acantophis antarctica_). There is generally much extravasation of  blood locally. Muscular paralysis is also less pronounced, but sudden  collapse from vaso-motor paralysis not unfrequently takes place, when  the patients fully conscious are still able to sit up. That leading  feature of viper poison, diapedesis with haemorrhage, does not occur with  either.    If we turn from Australian to Indian snakes, the peculiar tendency of  the poison to concentrate its action on special nerve-centres becomes  still more marked. The predilection of the cobra poison for the  respiratory centre has already been dwelt on. More remarkable and  strange is the action of the Indian viper-poison on the minute ganglia  in the vaso-motor nerve ends, which control the capillary circulation,  and by their paralysis bring about extensive haemorrhage through  diapedesis.    It is quite impossible for us with our present scanty knowledge to  account for these peculiarities and irregularities in the action of a  poison, which we know now to accomplish its destruction of animal life  by one uniform design and principle of action. That the protean forms  under which the poison-symptoms present themselves are one and all the  result of reduction and suspension of motor nerve currents may now be  accepted as a well proven and fully established scientific fact. But why  the effects of one and the same cause are so varying in their  appearance, why the poison of different varieties of snakes, and even  that of the same variety under different circumstances, make such a  capricious selection among the various motor nerve-centres we can not  explain and probably never will. Chemical analysis of the dead poison,  no matter how minutely and elaborately it may be effected, will probably  never throw much light on the \"why\" of this strange puzzle, for the  subtle phenomena of life are apt to elude the grasp of the analyst. We  have to do with a poison transferred from one living organism into  another one and modified in its action by the condition of the giver and  the constitution and peculiarities of the recipient quite as much  probably as by slight variations in its chemical composition. Accepting  the \"why\" of these phenomena like that of many other ones, simply as a  fact not to be accounted for at present, we must be content to know  \"how\" they are effected, and, what is of more immediate and paramount  importance to know, that we now have an antidote that will deal  successfully with them all, that the convulsions and haemorrhages of the  Indian viper-poison and the asphyxia of that of the cobra will yield as  readily to strychnine, when properly and boldly applied, as the coma and  general paralysis following the bite of the deadly tiger snake.    [Illustration]          THE ANTIDOTE.      The theory of the action of snake-poison as that of a specific  nerve-poison, depressing and more or less suspending the function of the  motor nerve-centres throughout the body, has in the foregoing pages  received a double proof of its correctness.    In the first place, all the symptoms the snake-poison produces have been  passed in review, and shown to be fully explainable by this theory. On  this ground alone it may be claimed to have been fully established; for  it is an axiom in science that a theory on any subject must be accepted  as correct, if it accounts satisfactorily for all the phenomena  observable in connection with that subject by showing them to result  from the operation of one law. The second inductive proof of the  correctness of the writer's theory has been rendered by the experiments  of Feoktistow on animals.    Science, however, demands that a theory thus established inductively  must also stand the test of practical application or deduction. It says  in the present case:--\"Granting your theory to be correct, it is but a  theory, which, however valuable it may be as a contribution to science,  is of little value to mankind if you cannot apply it practically. If  snake-poison merely acts as a depressant on motor nerve-cells without  interfering with their structure, you must be able to counteract it by  administering some drug or substance which acts as a powerful stimulant  on these cells, if such a substance can be found.\"    It is another illustration of that wise adaptation of means to ends  which, throughout the domain of nature, denotes the presence and rule of  a Supreme Intelligence, that this substance has been provided for us by  nature, though we have been long in finding it. Its discovery in  strychnine, and its successful application as the long and vainly sought  antidote to snake-poison, are glorious triumphs of scientific deduction.    Strychnine is the exact antithesis to snake-poison in its action. Under  its influence every motor nerve-cell throughout the system sends forth  stronger currents of nerve force than it does in its normal state. These  currents run alike from cell to cell, and from cell to peripheral fibre,  and act by means of the latter on all contractile, and especially all  muscular tissue, causing contractions, which, after poisonous doses of  the drug, assume the form of tetanic convulsions, provoked by the  slightest touch or even noise in consequence of highly intensified  reflex action.    Whilst, then, snake-poison, as we have"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32950"],[0,"Camp and Trail (#7)"],[1,"and be lost. It makes no difference how your pockets are constructed,  nor how careful you are, that result is inevitable. Then you will feel  badly--and go back to your old flat two-bladed implement that you simply  cannot lose.    [Sidenote: Sheath Knives]    A butcher knife of good make is one of the best and cheapest of sheath  knives. The common mistake among amateur hunters is that of buying too  heavy a knife with too thick a blade. Unless you expect to indulge in  hand to hand conflicts, or cut brush, such a weapon is excessive. I  myself have carried for the last seven years a rather thin and broad  blade made by the Marble Axe Company on the butcher knife pattern. This  company advertises in its catalogue a knife as used by myself. They are  mistaken. The knife I mean is a longer bladed affair, called a \"kitchen  or camp knife.\" It is a most excellent piece of steel, holds an edge  well, and is useful alike as a camp and hunting knife. The fact that I  have killed some thirty-four wild boars with it shows that it is not to  be despised as a weapon.    [Sidenote: Compasses]    Your compass should be large enough for accuracy, with a jewel movement.  Such an instrument can be purchased for from one to two dollars. It is  sheer extravagance to go in for anything more expensive unless you are a  yachtsman or intend to run survey lines.    [Sidenote: Concerning Guns]    I have hesitated much before deciding to say anything whatever of the  sporting outfit. The subject has been so thoroughly discussed by men so  much more competent than myself; there are so many theories with which I  confess myself not at all conversant, and my own experience has been so  limited in the variety of weapons and tackle, that I hardly felt  qualified to speak. However, I reflected that this whole series of  articles does not pretend to be in any way authoritative, nor does it  claim to present the only or the best equipment in any branch of  wilderness travel, but only to set forth the results of my own twenty  years more or less of pretty steady outdoor life. So likewise it may  interest the reader to hear about the contents of my own gunrack, even  though he himself would have chosen much more wisely.    [Sidenote: My Rifle]    My rifle is a .30-.40 box magazine Winchester, with Lyman sights. This I  have heard is not a particularly accurate gun. Also it is stated that  after a few hundred shots it becomes still more inaccurate because of a  residue which only special process can remove from the rifling. This may  be. I only know that my own rifle to-day, after ten years' service, will  still shoot as closely as I know how to hold it, although it has  sixty-four notches on its stock and has probably been fired first and  last--at big game, small game, and targets--upward of a thousand times.  I use the Lyman aperture sight except in the dusk of evening, when a  folding bar sight takes its place. At the time I bought this rifle the  .33 and .35 had not been issued, and I thought, and still think, the  .30-.30 too light for sure work on any animal larger than a deer. I have  never used the .35, but like the .33 very much. The old low-power guns I  used to shoot a great deal, but have not for some years.    [Sidenote: Pistol a Handy Weapon]    The handiest weapon for a woods trip where small game is plentiful is a  single-shot pistol. Mine is a Smith & Wesson, blued, six-inch barrel,  shooting the .22 caliber long-rifle cartridge. An eight-inch barrel is  commonly offered by the sporting dealers, but the six-inch is  practically as accurate, and less cumbersome to carry. The ammunition is  compact and light. With this little pistol I have killed in plenty  ducks, geese, grouse, and squirrels, so that at times I have gone two or  three months without the necessity of shooting a larger weapon. Such a  pistol takes practice, however, and a certain knack. You must keep at  it until you can get four out of five bullets in a three-inch bull's-eye  at twenty yards before you can even hope to accomplish much in the  field.    [Sidenote: Revolver Experiences]    My six-shooter is a .45 Colt, New Service model. It is fitted with Lyman  revolver sights. Originally it was a self-cocker, but I took out the dog  and converted it to single action. The trigger pull on the double action  is too heavy for me, and when I came to file it down, I found the double  action caused a double jerk disconcerting to steady holding. Now it goes  off smoothly and almost at a touch--the only conditions under which I  can do much with a revolver. It is a very reliable weapon indeed,  balances better than the single-action model, and possesses great  smashing power. I have killed three deer in their tracks with it, and  much smaller game. This summer, however, I had the opportunity of  shooting a good deal with two I like better. One is the Officer's Model  Colt, chambered to shoot interchangeably either the .38 Colt long or  short, or the .38 Smith & Wesson special. In finish it is a beautiful  weapon, its grip fits the hand, its action is smooth, and it is  wonderfully accurate. The other is the special target .44 Russian. The  automatics I do not care for simply because I never learned to shoot  with the heavier trigger pull necessary to their action.    [Sidenote: Shot Guns]    I have two shotguns. One I have shot twenty-one years. It has killed  thousands of game birds, is a hard hitter, throws an excellent pattern,  and is as strong and good as the day it was bought. I use it to-day for  every sort of shooting except ducks, though often I have had it in the  blinds lacking the heavier weapon. It is doubtful if there are in use  to-day many guns with longer service, counting not so much the mere  years of its performance, as the actual amount of hunting it has done.  The time of its construction was before the days of the hammerless. It  was made by W. & C. Scott & Sons, is 16 gauge, and cost $125. My other  is a heavily choked Parker twelve. It I use for wild fowl, and  occasionally at the trap.    The main point with guns, no matter what the kind, is to keep them in  good shape. After shooting, clean them, no matter how tired you may be.  It is no great labor. In the field a string cleaner will do the  business, but at once when you get to permanent camp use a rod and elbow  grease. In a damp country, oil them afresh every day; so they will give  you good service. The barrels of my 16 are as bright as new. The  cleaning rods you can put in your leather fishing-rod case.    [Sidenote: Duffle Bags]    Now all these things of which we have made mention must be transported.  The duffle bag is the usual receptacle for them. It should be of some  heavy material, waterproofed, and should not be too large. A good one is  of pantasote, with double top to tie. One of these went the length of a  rapids, and was fished out without having shipped a drop. On a horseback  trip, however, such a contrivance is at once unnecessary and difficult  to pack. It is too long and stiff to go easily in the kyacks, and does  not agree well with the bedding on top.    This is really no great matter. The heavy kyacks, and the tarpaulin over  everything, furnish all needed protection against wet and abrasion. A  bag of some thinner and more pliable material is quite as good. Brown  denim, unbleached cotton, or even a clean flour sack, are entirely  adequate. You will find it handy to have them built with puckering  strings. The strings so employed will not get lost, and can be used as a  loop to hang the outfit from a branch when in camp.    [Sidenote: Toilet Articles]    A similar but smaller bag is useful to be reserved entirely as a toilet  bag. Tar soap in a square--not round--celluloid case is the most  cleansing. A heavy rubber band will hold the square case together.[2]  The tooth brush should also have its case. Tooth wash comes in glass,  which is taboo; tooth powder is sure sooner or later to leak out. I  like best any tooth soap which is sold in handy flat tin boxes, and  cannot spill. If you are sensible you will not be tenderfoot enough to  go in for the discomfort of a new beard. Razors can be kept from rusting  by wrapping them in a square of surgeon's oiled silk. Have your towel of  brown crash--never of any white material. The latter is so closely woven  that dirt gets into the very fiber of it, and cannot be washed out.  Crash, however, is of looser texture, softens quickly, and does not show  every speck of dust. If you have the room for it, a rough towel, while  not absolutely necessary, is nevertheless a great luxury.    [Sidenote: Medicines]    By way of medicines, stick to the tablet form. A strong compact medicine  case is not expensive. It should contain antiseptics, permanganate for  snake bites, a laxative, cholera remedy, quinine, and morphine. In  addition antiseptic bandages and rubber or surgeon's plaster should be  wrapped in oiled silk and included in the duffle outfit.    The fly problem is serious in some sections of the country and at some  times of year. A head net is sometimes useful about camp or riding in  the open--never when walking in the woods. The ordinary mosquito bar is  too fragile. One of bobbinet that fits ingeniously is very effective.  This and gloves will hold you immune--but you cannot smoke, nor spit on  the bait.    [Sidenote: Fly Dopes]    The two best fly dopes of the many I have tried are a commercial mixture  called \"lollacapop,\" and Nessmuk's formula. The lollacapop comes in tin  boxes, and so is handy to carry, but does not wear quite as well as the  other. Nessmuk's dope is:              Oil pine tar              3 parts            Castor oil                2 parts            Oil pennyroyal            1 part    [Sidenote: Fly Dopes]    It is most effective. A dab on each cheek and one behind each ear will  repel the fly of average voracity, while a full coating will save you in  the worst circumstances. A"]]]
