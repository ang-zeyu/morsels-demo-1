[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/36962"],[0,"My Attainment of the Pole (#7)"],[1,"which the world gives to such an accomplishment as the  discovery of the North Pole, I care very little, but when the very  result of such a victory is used as a whip to inflict cuts that mark my  future destiny, I have a right to call a halt. I have claimed no  national honors, want no medals or money. My feet stepped over the  Polar wastes with a will fired only by a personal ambition to succeed in  a task where all the higher human powers were put to the test of  fitness. That victory was honestly won. All that the achievement ever  meant to me--the lure of it before I achieved it, the only satisfaction  that remains since--is that it is a personal accomplishment of brain and  muscle over hitherto unconquered forces, a thought in which I have  pride. From the tremendous ovations that greeted me when I returned to  civilization I got not a single thrill. I did thrill with the handclasp  of confident, kindly people. I still thrill with the handclasp of my  countrymen.    Insofar as the earthly glory and applause are concerned, I should be  only too glad to share them, with all material accruements, to any  honest, manly rivals--those of the past and those of the future. But  against the unjust charges which have been made against me, against the  aspersions on my personal integrity, against the ignominy with which my  name has been besmirched, I will fight until the public gets a normal  perspective.    I have never hoaxed a mythical achievement. Everything I have ever  claimed was won by hard labor, by tremendous physical fortitude and  endurance, and by such personal sacrifice as only I, and my immediate  family, will ever know.    For this reason, I returned to my country in the latter part of 1910, as  I always intended to do, after a year's rest. By this time I knew that  my enemies would have said all that was possible about me; the  excitement of the controversy would have quieted, and I should have the  advantage of the last word.    In the heat of the controversy, only just returned in a weakened  condition from the North, and mentally bewildered by the unexpected  maelstrom of events, I should not have been able, with justice to  myself, to have met all the charges, criminal and silly, which were made  against me. Even what I did say was misquoted and distorted by a  sensational press which found it profitable to add fuel to the  controversy. Sometimes I feel that no man ever born has been so  variedly, so persistently lied about, misrepresented, made the butt of  such countless untruths as myself. When I consider the lies, great and  small, which for more than a year, throughout the entire world, have  been printed about me, I am filled almost with hopelessness. And  sometimes, when I think how I have been unjustly dubbed as the most  colossal liar of history, I am filled with a sort of sardonic humor.    Returning to my country, determined to state my case freely and frankly,  and making the honest admission that any claim to the definite, actual  attainment of the North Pole--the mathematical pin-point on which the  earth spins--must rest upon assumptions, because of the impossibility of  accuracy in observations, I found that this admission, which every  explorer would have to make, which Mr. Peary was unwillingly forced to  make at the Congressional investigation, was construed throughout the  country and widely heralded as a \"confession,\" that garbled extracts  were lifted from the context of my magazine story and their meaning  distorted. In hundreds of newspapers I was represented as confessing to  a fraudulent claim or as making a plea of insanity. A full answer to the  charges made against me, necessary in order to justly cover my case,  because of the controversial nature of certain statements which  involved Mr. Peary, was prohibited by the contract I found it necessary  to sign in order to get any statement of a comparatively ungarbled sort  before a public which had read Mr. Peary's own account of his journey.    I found the columns of the press of my country closed to the publication  of statements which involved my enemies, because of the unfounded  prejudice created against me during my absence and because of the power  of Mr. Peary's friends. It is almost impossible in any condition for  anyone to secure a refutation for an unfounded attack in the American  papers. With the entire press of the country printing misstatements, I  was almost helpless. The justice, kindliness and generous spirit of fair  dealing of the American people, however, was extended to me--I found the  American people glad--nay, eager--to listen.    It is this spirit which has encouraged me, after the shameful campaign  of opprobrium which well-nigh broke my spirit, to tell the entire and  unalterable truth about myself and an achievement in which I still  believe--in fairness to myself, in order to clear myself, in order that  the truth about the discovery of the North Pole may be known by my  people and in order that history may record its verdict upon a full,  free and frank exposition. I do not address myself to any clique of  geographers or scientists, but to the great public of the world, and  herein, for the first time, shall I give fully whatever proofs there may  be of my conquest. Upon these records must conviction rest.    Did I actually reach the North Pole? When I returned to civilization and  reported that the boreal center had been attained, I believed that I  had reached the spot toward which valiant men had strained for more than  three hundred years. I still believe that I reached the boreal center as  far as it is possible for any human being to ascertain it. If I was  mistaken in approximately placing my feet upon the pin-point about which  this controversy has raged, I maintain that it is the inevitable mistake  any man must make. To touch that spot would be an accident. That any  other man has more accurately determined the Pole I do deny. That Mr.  Peary reached the North Pole--or its environs--with as fair accuracy as  was possible, I have never denied. That Mr. Peary was better fitted to  reach the Pole, and better equipped to locate this mythical spot, I do  not admit. In fact, I believe that, inasmuch as the purely scientific  ascertainment is a comparatively simple matter, I stood a better chance  of more scientifically and more accurately marking the actual spot than  Mr. Peary. I reached my goal when the sun was twelve degrees above the  horizon, and was therefore better able to mark a mathematical position  than Mr. Peary could have with the sun at less than seven degrees. Mr.  Peary's case rests upon three observations of sun altitude so low that,  as proof of a position, they are worthless.    Besides taking observations, which, as I shall explain in due course in  my narrative, cannot be adequate, I also ascertained what I believed to  be my approximate position at the boreal center and en route by  measuring the shadows each hour of the long day. Inasmuch as one's  shadow decreases or increases in length as the sun rises toward the  meridian or descends, at the boreal center, where the sun circles the  entire horizon at practically the same height during the entire day,  one's shadow in this region of mystery is of the same length. In this  observation, which is so simple that a child may understand it, is a  sure and certain means of approximately ascertaining the North Pole. I  took advantage of this method, which does not seem to have occurred to  any other Arctic traveler, and this helped to bring conviction.    I shall in this volume present with detail the story of my Arctic  journey--I shall tell how it was possible for me to reach my goal, why I  believe I attained that goal; and upon this record must the decision of  my people rest. I shall herein tell the story of an unfair and unworthy  plot to ruin the reputation of an innocent man because of an achievement  the full and prior credit of which was desired by a brutally selfish,  brutally unscrupulous rival. I shall tell of a tragedy compared with  which the North Pole and any glory accruing to its discoverer pales into  insignificance--the tragedy of a spirit that was almost broken, of a man  whose honor and pride was cut with knives in unclean hands.    When you have read all this, then, and only then, in fairness to  yourself and in fairness to me, do I ask you to form your opinion. Only  by reading this can you learn the full truth about me, about my claim  and about the plot to discredit me, of the charges made against me, and  the reason for all of my own actions. So persistent, so world-wide has  been the press campaign made by my enemies, and so egregious have the  charges seemed against me, so multitudinous have the lies, fake stories,  fake interviews, fake confessions been, so blatant have rung the  hideous cries of liar, impostor, cheat and fraud, that the task to right  myself, explain myself, and bring the truth into clean relief has seemed  colossal.    To return to my country and face the people in view of all that was  being said, with my enemies exultant, with antagonistic press men  awaiting me as some beast to be devoured, required a determined gritting  of the teeth and a reserve temperament to prevent an undignified battle.    For against such things nature dictates the tactics of the tiger. I  faced my people, I found them fair and kindly. I accused my enemies of  their lies, and they have remained silent. Titanic as is this effort of  forcing fair play where biased abuse has reigned so long, I am confident  of success. I am confident of the honesty and justice of my people; of  their ability spiritually to sense, psychically to appreciate the  earmarks of a clean, true effort--a worthy ambition and a real  attainment.

What has been  said of hunting applies to coursing, and these things sportsmen can  remedy if they wish. There is more unwritten law in connection with  British field-sports than any other pastime; but obviously it might be  added to with advantage. If something is not done the hare will  assuredly become extinct. To prevent this a \"close time\" is, in the  opinion of those best versed in woodcraft, absolutely necessary. The  dates between which the hare would best be protected are the first of  March and the first of August. Then we would gain all round. The recent  relaxation of the law has done something to encourage poaching, and  poachers now find pretexts for being on or about land which before were  of no avail, and to the moucher accurate observation by day is one of  the essentials to success.    Naturalists ought to know best; but there has been more unnatural  history written concerning hares than any other British animal. It is  said to produce two young ones at a birth, but observant poachers know  that from three to five leverets are not unfrequently found: then it is  stated that hares breed twice, or at most thrice, a year. Anyone,  however, who has daily observed their habits, knows that there are but  few months in which leverets are not born. In mild winters young ones  are found in January and February, whilst in March they have become  common. They may be seen right on through summer and autumn, and last  December I saw a brace of leverets a month old. Does shot in October are  sometimes found to be giving milk, and in November old hares are not  unfrequently noticed in the same patch of cover. These facts would seem  to point to the conclusion that the hare propagates its species almost  the whole year round--a startling piece of evidence to the older  naturalists. Add to this that hares pair when a year old, that gestation  lasts only thirty days, and it will be seen what a possibly prolific  animal the hare may be. The young are born covered with fur, and after a  month leave their mother to seek their own subsistence.          [Illustration]    Chapter 6.    PHEASANT POACHING.      Through late summer and autumn the poacher's thoughts go out to the  early weeks of October. Neither the last load of ruddy corn, nor the  actual netting of the partridge gladden his heart as do the first signs  of the dying year. There are certain sections of the Game Laws which he  never breaks, and only some rare circumstance tempts him to take  immature birds. But by the third week of October the yellow and sere of  the year has come. The duns and browns are over the woods, and the  leaves come fitfully flickering down. Everything out of doors testifies  that autumn is waning, and that winter will soon be upon us. The colours  of the few remaining flowers are fading, and nature is beginning to have  a washed-out appearance. The feathery plumes of the ash are everywhere  strewn beneath the trees, for, just as the ash is the first to burst  into leaf, so it is the first to go. The foliage of the oak is already  assuming a bright chestnut, though the leaves will remain throughout the  year. In the oak avenues the acorns are lying in great quantities,  though oak mast is not now the important product it once was, cheap  grain having relegated it almost exclusively to the use of the birds.  And now immense flocks of wood pigeons flutter in the trees or pick up  the food from beneath. The garnering of the grain, the flocking of  migratory birds, the wild clanging of fowl in the night sky--these are  the sights and sounds that set the poacher's thoughts off in the old  grooves.    [Illustration]    Of all species of poaching, that which ensures a good haul of pheasants  is most beset with difficulty. Nevertheless there are silent ways and  means which prove as successful in the end as the squire's guns, and  these without breaking the woodland silence with a sound. The most  successful of these I intend to set down, and only such will be  mentioned as have stood me in good stead in actual night work. Among  southern woods and coverts the pheasant poacher is usually a desperate  character; not so in the north. Here the poachers are more skilled in  woodcraft, and are rarely surprised. If the worst comes to the worst it  is a fair stand-up fight with fists, and is usually bloodless. There is  little greed of gain in the night enterprise, and liberty by flight is  the first thing resorted to.    It is well for the poacher, and well for his methods, that the pheasant  is rather a stupid bird. There is no gainsaying its beauty, however, and  a brace of birds, with all the old excitement thrown in, are well worth  winning, even at considerable risk. In a long life of poaching I have  noticed that the pheasant has one great characteristic. It is fond of  wandering; and this cannot be prevented. Watch the birds: even when fed  daily, and with the daintiest food, they wander off, singly or in pairs,  far from the home coverts. This fact I knew well, and was not slow to  use my knowledge. When October came round they were the very first birds  to which I directed my attention. Every poacher observes, year by year  (even leaving his own predaceous paws out of the question), that it by  no means follows that the man who rears the pheasants will have the  privilege of shooting them. There is a very certain time in the life of  the bird when it disdains the scattered corn of the keeper, and begins  to anticipate the fall of beech and oak mast. In search of this the  pheasants make daily journeys, and consume great quantities. They feed  principally in the morning; dust themselves in the roads or  turnip-fields at mid-day, and ramble through the woods in the afternoon.  And one thing is certain: That when wandered birds find themselves in  outlying copses in the evening they are apt to roost there. As already  stated, these were the birds to which I paid my best attention. When  wholesale pheasant poaching is prosecuted by gangs, it is in winter,  when the trees are bare. Guns, with the barrels filed down, are taken in  sacks, and the pheasants are shot where they roost. Their bulky forms  stand sharply outlined against the sky, and they are invariably on the  lower branches. If the firing does not immediately bring up the keepers,  the game is quickly deposited in bags, and the gang makes off. And it is  generally arranged that a light cart is waiting at some remote lane end,  so that possible pursuers may be quickly outpaced. The great risk  incurred by this method will be seen, when it is stated that pheasants  are generally reared close by the keeper's cottage, and that their  coverts immediately surround it. It is mostly armed mouchers who enter  these, and not the more gifted (save the mark!) country poacher. And  there are reasons for this. Opposition must always be anticipated, for,  speaking for the nonce from the game-keeper's standpoint, the covert  never should be, and rarely is, unwatched. Then there are the certain  results of possible capture to be taken into account. This affected, and  with birds in one's possession, the poacher is liable to be indicted  upon so many concurrent charges, each and all having heavy penalties.  Than this I obtained my game in a different and quieter way. My custom  was to carefully eschew the preserves, and look up all outlying birds. I  never went abroad without a pocketful of corn, and day by day enticed  the wandered birds further and further away. This accomplished,  pheasants may be snared with hair nooses, or taken in spring traps. One  of my commonest and most successful methods with wandered birds was to  light brimstone beneath the trees in which they roosted. The powerful  fumes soon overpowered them, and they came flopping down the trees one  by one. This method has the advantage of silence, and if the night be  dead and still, is rarely detected. Away from the preserves, time was  never taken into account in my plans, and I could work systematically. I  was content with a brace of birds at a time, and usually got most in the  end, with least chance of capture.    [Illustration]    I have already spoken at some length of my education in field and  wood-craft. An important (though at the time unconscious) part of this  was minute observation of the haunts and habits of all kinds of game;  and this knowledge was put to good use in my actual poaching raids.  Here is an instance of what I mean: I had noticed the great pugnacity of  the pheasant, and out of this made capital. After first finding out the  whereabouts of the keeper, I fitted a trained game-cock with artificial  spurs, and then took it to the covert side. The artificial spurs were  fitted to the natural ones, were sharp as needles, and the plucky bird  already knew how to use them. Upon his crowing, one or more cock  pheasants would immediately respond, and advance to meet the adversary.  A single blow usually sufficed to lay low the pride of the pheasant, and  in this way half-a-dozen birds were bagged, whilst my own representative  remained unhurt.    I had another ingenious plan (if I may say so) in connection with  pheasants, and, perhaps, the most successful. I may say at once that  there is nothing sportsmanlike about it; but then that is in keeping  with most of what I have set down. If time and opportunity offer there  is hardly any limit to the depredation which it allows. Here it is: A  number of dried peas are taken and steeped in boiling water; a hole is  then made through the centre, and through this again a stiff bristle is  threaded. The ends are then cut off short, leaving only about a quarter  of an inch of bristle projecting on each side. With these the birds are  fed, and they are greedily eaten. In passing down the gullet, however, a  violent irritation is set up, and the pheasant is finally choked. In a  "]]]
