He was a little thin man, and the watch was immense.  Polly for her life couldn't keep her eyes off from it; if Ben could only  have one so fine!    \"Polly,\" whispered Mrs. Pepper, \"run and get my purse; it's in the top  bureau drawer.\"    \"Yes'm,\" said Polly, taking her eyes off, by a violent wrench, from  the fascinating watch; and she ran quickly and got the little old  stocking-leg, where the hard earnings that staid long enough to be put  anywhere, always found refuge. She put it into her mother's lap, and  watched while Mrs. Pepper counted out slowly one dollar in small pieces.    \"Here sir,\" said Mrs. Pepper, holding them out towards the doctor; \"and  thank you for coming.\"    \"Hey!\" said the little man, spinning round; \"that dollar's the Lord's!\"    Mrs. Pepper looked bewildered, and still sat holding it out. \"And the  Lord has given it to you to take care of these children with; see that  you do it.\" And without another word he was gone.    \"Wasn't he good, mammy?\" asked Polly, after the first surprise was over.    \"I'm sure he was,\" said Mrs. Pepper. \"Well, tie it up again, Polly, tie  it up tight; we shall want it, I'm sure,\" sighing at her little sick  girl.    \"Mayn't I take Phronsie, ma?\" asked Polly.    \"No, no,\" said Phronsie. She had got mammy, and she meant to improve the  privilege.    \"What is 'measles' anyway, mammy?\" asked Polly, sitting down on the  floor at their feet.    \"Oh, 'tis something children always have,\" replied Mrs. Pepper; \"but I'm  sure I hoped it wouldn't come just yet.\"    \"I sha'n't have it,\" said Polly, decisively; \"I know I sha'n't! nor  Ben--nor Joe--nor--nor Davie--I guess,\" she added, hesitatingly, for  Davie was the delicate one of the family; at least not nearly so strong  as the others.    Mrs. Pepper looked at her anxiously; but Polly seemed as bright and  healthy as ever, as she jumped up and ran to put the kettle on the  stove.    \"What'll the boys say, I wonder!\" she thought to herself, feeling  quite important that they really had sickness in the house. As long  as Phronsie wasn't dangerous, it seemed quite like rich folks; and she  forgot the toil, and the grind of poverty. She looked out from time to  time as she passed the window, but no boys came.    \"I'll put her in bed, Polly,\" said Mrs. Pepper, in a whisper, as  Phronsie closed her eyes and breathed regularly.    \"And then will you have your dinner, ma?\"    \"Yes,\" said Mrs. Pepper, \"I don't care--if the boys come.\"    \"The boys'll never come,\" said Polly, impatiently; \"I don't  believe--why! here they are now!\"    \"Oh, dear,\" said Joel, coming in crossly, \"I'm so hungry--oh--butter!  where'd you get it? I thought we never should get here!\"    \"I thought so too,\" said Polly. \"Hush! why, where's Ben?\"    \"He's just back,\" began Joel, commencing to eat, \"and Davie; something  is the matter with Ben--he says he feels funny.\"    \"Something the matter with Ben!\" repeated Polly. She dropped the cup she  held, which broke in a dozen pieces.    \"Oh, whocky!\" cried Joel; \"see what you've done, Polly Pepper!\"    But Polly didn't hear; over the big, flat door-stone she sped, and  met Ben with little David, coming in the gate. His face was just like  Phronsie's! And with a cold, heavy feeling at her heart, Polly realized  that this was no play.    \"Oh, Ben!\" she cried, flinging her arms around his neck, and bursting  into tears; \"don't! please--I wish you wouldn't; Phronsie's got 'em, and  that's enough!\"    \"Got what?\" asked Ben, while Davie's eyes grew to their widest  proportions.    \"Oh, measles!\" cried Polly, bursting out afresh; \"the hate-fullest,  horridest measles! and now you're taken!\"    \"Oh no, I'm not,\" responded Ben, cheerfully, who knew what measles were;  \"wipe up, Polly; I'm all right; only my head aches, and my eyes feel  funny.\"    But Polly, only half-reassured, controlled her sobs; and the sorrowful  trio repaired to mother.    \"Oh, dear!\" ejaculated Mrs. Pepper, sinking in a chair in dismay, at  sight of Ben's red face; \"whatever'll we do now!\"    The prop and stay of her life would be taken away if Ben should be laid  aside. No more stray half or quarter dollars would come to help her out  when she didn't know where to turn.    Polly cleared off the deserted table--for once Joel had all the bread  and butter he wanted. Ben took some of Phronsie's medicine, and  crawled up into the loft, to bed; and quiet settled down on the little  household.    \"Polly,\" whispered Ben, as she tucked him in, \"it'll be hard buckling-to  now, for you, but I guess you'll do it.\"          MORE TROUBLE      \"Oh, dear,\" said Polly to herself, the next morning, trying to get a  breakfast for the sick ones out of the inevitable mush; \"everything's  just as bad as it can be! they can't ever eat this; I wish I had an  ocean of toast!\"    \"Toast some of the bread in the pail, Polly,\" said Mrs. Pepper.    She looked worn and worried; she had been up nearly all night, back and  forth from Ben's bed in the loft to restless, fretful little Phronsie in  the big four-poster in the bedroom; for Phronsie wouldn't get into the  crib. Polly had tried her best to help her, and had rubbed her eyes  diligently to keep awake, but she was wholly unaccustomed to it, and her  healthy, tired little body succumbed--and then when she awoke, shame and  remorse filled her very heart.    \"That isn't nice, ma,\" she said, glancing at the poor old pail, which  she had brought out of the \"Provision Room.\" \"Old brown bread! I want to  fix 'em something nice.\"    \"Well, you can't, you know,\" said Mrs. Pepper, with a sigh; \"but you've  got butter now; that'll be splendid!\"    \"I know it,\" said Polly, running to the corner cupboard where the  precious morsel in the blue bowl remained; \"whatever should we do  without it, mammy?\"    \"Do without it!\" said Mrs. Pepper; \"same's we have done.\"    \"Well, 'twas splendid in Mrs. Henderson to give it to us, anyway,\" said  Polly, longing for just one taste; \"seems as if 'twas a year since I  was there--oh, ma!\" and here Polly took up the thread that had been so  rudely snapped; \"don't you think, she's got ten of the prettiest--yes,  the sweetest little chickens you ever saw! Why can't we have some,  mammy?\"    \"Costs money,\" replied Mrs. Pepper. \"We've got too many in the house to  have any outside.\"    \"Oh, dear,\" said Polly, with a red face that was toasting about as much  as the bread she was holding on the point of an old fork; \"we never have  had anything. There,\" she added at last; \"that's the best I can do; now  I'll put the butter on this little blue plate; ain't that cunning, ma?\"    \"Yes,\" said Mrs. Pepper, approvingly; \"it takes you, Polly.\" So Polly  trotted first to Ben, up the crooked, low stairs to the loft; and while  she regaled him with the brown toast and butter, she kept her tongue  flying on the subject of the little chicks, and all that she saw on the  famous Henderson visit. Poor Ben pretended hard to eat, but ate nothing  really; and Polly saw it all, and it cut her to the heart--so she talked  faster than ever.    \"Now,\" she said, starting to go back to Phronsie; \"Ben Pepper, just as  soon as you get well, we'll have some chickens--so there!\"    \"Guess we sha'n't get 'em very soon,\" said Ben, despondently, \"if I've  got to lie here; and, besides, Polly, you know every bit we can save has  got to go for the new stove.\"    \"Oh, dear,\" said Polly, \"I forgot that; so it has; seems to me  everything's giving out!\"    \"You can't bake any longer in the old thing,\" said Ben, turning over and  looking at her; \"poor girl, I don't see how you've stood it so long.\"    \"And we've been stuffing it,\" cried Polly merrily, \"till 'twon't stuff  any more.\"    \"No,\" said Ben, turning back again, \"that's all worn out.\"    \"Well, you must go to sleep,\" said Polly, \"or mammy'll be up here; and  Phronsie hasn't had her breakfast either.\"    Phronsie was wailing away dismally, sitting up in the middle of the old  bed. Her face pricked, she said, and she was rubbing it vigorously with  both fat little hands, and then crying worse than ever.    \"Oh me! oh my!\" cried Polly; \"how you look, Phronsie!\"    \"I want my mammy!\" cried poor Phronsie.    \"Mammy can't come now, Phronsie dear; she's sewing. See what Polly's got  for you--butter: isn't that splendid!\"    Phronsie stopped for just one moment, and took a mouthful; but the toast  was hard and dry, and she cried harder than before.    \"Now,\" said Polly, curling up on the bed beside her, \"if you'll stop  crying, Phronsie Pepper, I'll tell you about the cunningest, yes, the  very cunningest little chickens you ever saw. One was white, and he  looked just like this,\" said Polly, tumbling over on the bed in a heap;  \"he couldn't stand up straight, he was so fat.\"    \"Did he bite?\" asked Phronsie, full of interest.    \"No, he didn't bite me,\" said Polly; \"but his mother put a bug in his  mouth--just as I'm doing you know,\" and she broke off a small piece of  the toast, put on a generous bit of butter, and held it over Phronsie's  mouth.    \"Did he swallow it?\" asked the child, obediently opening her little red  lips.    \"Oh, snapped it,\" answered Polly, \"quick as ever he could, I tell you;  but 'twasn't good like this, Phronsie.\"    \"Did he have two bugs?\" asked Phronsie, eying suspiciously the second  morsel of dry toast that Polly was conveying to her mouth.    \"Well, he would have had,\" replied Polly, \"if there'd been bugs enough;  but there were nine other chicks, Phronsie.\"    \"Poor chickies,\" said Phronsie, and looked lovingly at the rest of the  toast and butter on the plate; and while Polly fed it to her, listened  with absorbed interest to all the particulars concerning each and every  chick in the Henderson hen-coop.    \"Mother,\" said Polly, towards evening, \"I'm going to sit up "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27713"],[0,"The Elements of Bacteriological Technique (#7)"],[1,"for fifteen minutes.    5. After disinfection, and whilst still hot, take out the instruments,  dry carefully and at once, and return them to their store cases.    _Streaming steam_--i. e., steam at 100 deg. C.--destroys the vegetative  forms of bacteria in from fifteen to twenty minutes, and the sporing  forms in from one to two hours. This method is chiefly used for the  sterilisation of the various nutrient media intended for the cultivation  of bacteria, and is carried out in a steam kettle of special  construction, known as Koch's steam steriliser (Fig. 28) or in one of  its many modifications, the most efficient of which is Arnold's (Fig.  29).    The steam steriliser in its simplest form consists of a tall tinned-iron  or copper cylindrical vessel, divided into two unequal parts by a  movable perforated metal diaphragm, the lower, smaller portion serving  for a water reservoir, and the upper part for the reception of wire  baskets containing the articles to be sterilised. The vessel is closed  by a loose conical lid, provided with handles, and perforated at its  apex by a tubulure; it is mounted on a tripod stand and heated from  below by a Bunsen burner. The more elaborate steriliser is cased with  felt or asbestos board, and provided with a water gauge, also a tap for  emptying the water compartment.      TO USE THE STEAM STERILISER.--    1. Fill the water compartment to the level of the perforated diaphragm,  place the lid in position, and light the Bunsen burner.    2. After the water has boiled, allow sufficient time to elapse for steam  to replace the air in the sterilising compartment, as shown by the steam  issuing in a steady, continuous stream from the tubulure in the lid.    3. Remove the lid, quickly lower the wire basket containing media tubes,  etc., into the sterilising compartment until it rests on the diaphragm,  and replace the lid.    4. After an interval of twenty minutes in the case of fluid media, or  thirty minutes in the case of solid media, take off the lid and remove  the basket with its contents.    5. Now, but not before, extinguish the gas.         NOTE.--After removing tubes, flasks, etc., from the steam       steriliser, they should be at once separated freely in order       to prevent moisture condensing upon the cotton-wool plugs       and soaking through into the interior of the tubes.    This treatment will destroy any vegetative forms of bacteria; during the  hours of cooling any spores present will germinate, and the young  organisms will be destroyed by repeating the process twenty-four hours  later; a third sterilisation after a similar interval makes assurance  doubly sure.    The method of sterilising by exposure to streaming steam at 100 deg. C.  for twenty minutes on each of three consecutive days is termed  _discontinuous_ or _intermittent sterilisation_.    Exposure to steam at 100 deg. C. for a period of one or two hours, or  _continuous sterilisation_, cannot always be depended upon and is  therefore not to be recommended.    _Superheated steam_--i. e., steam under pressure (see  Pressure-temperature table, Appendix, page 500) in sealed vessels at a  temperature of 115 deg. C.--will destroy both the vegetative and the  sporing forms of bacteria within fifteen minutes; if the pressure is  increased, and the temperature raised to 120 deg. C., the same end is  attained in ten minutes. This method was formerly employed for the  sterilisation of media (and indeed is so used in some laboratories  still), but most workers now realise that media subjected to this high  temperature undergo hydrolytic changes which render them unsuitable for  the cultivation of the more delicate micro-organisms. The use of  superheated steam should be restricted almost entirely to the  disinfection of such contaminated articles, old cultivations, etc., as  cannot be dealt with by dry heat or the actual furnace. Sterilisation  by means of superheated steam is carried out in a special  boiler--Chamberland's autoclave (Fig. 30). The autoclave consists of a  stout copper cylinder, provided with a copper or gun-metal lid, which  is secured in place by means of bolts and thumbscrews, the joint between  the cylinder and its lid being hermetically sealed by the interposition  of a rubber washer. The cover is perforated for a branched tube carrying  a vent cock, a manometer, and a safety valve. The copper boiler is  mounted in the upper half of a cylindrical sheet-iron case--two  concentric circular rows of Bunsen burners, each circle having an  independent gas-supply, occupying the lower half. In the interior of the  boiler is a large movable wire basket, mounted on legs, for the reception  of the articles to be sterilised.      TO USE THE AUTOCLAVE.--    1. Pack the articles to be sterilised in the wire basket.    2. Run water into the boiler to the level of the bottom of the basket;  also fill the contained flasks and tubes with water.    3. See that the rubber washer is in position, then replace the cover and  fasten it tightly on to the autoclave by means of the thumbscrews.    4. Open the vent cock and light both rings of burners.    5. When steam is issuing in a steady, continuous stream from the vent  tube, shut off the vent cock and extinguish the outer ring of gas  burners.    6. Wait until the index of the manometer records a temperature of 120 deg.  C., then regulate the gas and the spring safety valve in such a manner  that this temperature is just maintained, and leave it thus for twenty  minutes. In the more expensive patterns of autoclave this regulation of  the safety valve is carried out automatically, the manometer being  fitted with an adjustable pointer which can be set to any required  pressure-temperature and so arranged that when the index of the  manometer coincides with the adjustable hand the safety valve is opened.    7. Extinguish the gas and allow the manometer index to fall to zero.    [Illustration: FIG. 30.--Chamberland's Autoclave.]    8. Now open the vent cock slowly, and allow the internal pressure to  adjust itself to that of the atmosphere.    9. Remove the cover and take out the sterilised contents.    ~Sterilisation Periods.~--An exceedingly useful device for the timing of  sterilisation periods (and indeed for many other operations in the  laboratory) is the      ELECTRIC SIGNAL TIMING CLOCK.    This is a clock of American type in which the face is surrounded by a  metal plate having a series of 60 holes at equal distances apart,  corresponding to the minutes on the dial. This plate is connected with  one of the poles of a dry battery, the other pole of which is connected  to the metal case of the clock for the purpose of actuating an ordinary  magnet alarm bell. In the centre of each of the holes in the plate a  metal rod is fixed, which then passes through an insulating ring and  projects inside the clock face, where it makes contact with the hour  hand. The clock is mounted on a heavy base, with a key-board containing  20 numbered plugs. If one of the plugs is inserted in a hole in the  plate it makes contact with the rod, and when the hour hand of the clock  touches the other end the circuit is completed and the bell starts  ringing. The period of this friction contact is approximately 20  seconds. The clock can therefore be used for electrically noting the  periods of time from one minute by multiples of one minute up to one  hour.    [Illustration: FIG. 31.--Electric signal timing clock.]    ~Filtration.~--(a) _Cotton-wool Filter._--Practically the only method in  use in the laboratory for the sterilisation of air or of a gas is by  filtration through dry cotton-wool or glass-wool, the fibres of which  entangle the micro-organisms and prevent their passage.    Perhaps the best example of such a filter is the cotton-wool plug which  closes the mouth of a culture tube. Not only does ordinary diffusion  take place through it, but if a tube plugged in the usual manner with  cotton-wool is removed from the hot incubator, the temperature of the  contained air rapidly falls to that of the laboratory, and a partial  vacuum is formed; air passes into the tube, through the cotton-wool  plug, to restore the equilibrium, and, so long as the plug remains dry,  in a germ-free condition. If, however, the plug becomes moist, either by  absorption from the atmosphere, or from liquids coming into contact with  it, micro-organisms (especially the mould fungi) commence to multiply,  and the long thread forms rapidly penetrate the substance of the plug,  and gain access to and contaminate the interior of the tube.    [Illustration: FIG. 32.--Cotton-wool air filter.]      METHOD.--    If it is desired to sterilise gases before admission to a vessel  containing a pure cultivation of a micro-organism, as, for instance,  when forcing a current of oxygen over or through a broth cultivation of  the diphtheria bacillus, this can be readily effected as follows:    1. Take a length of glass tubing of, say, 1.5 cm. diameter, in the  centre of which a bulb has been blown, fill the bulb with dry  cotton-wool (Fig. 32), wrap a layer of cotton-wool around each end of  the tube, and secure in position with a turn of thin copper wire or  string; then sterilise the piece of apparatus in the hot-air oven.    2. Prepare the cultivation in a Ruffer or Woodhead flask (Fig. 33) the  inlet tube of which has its free extremity enveloped in a layer of  cotton-wool, secured by thread or wire, whilst the exit tube is plugged  in the usual manner.    [Illustration: FIG. 33.--Ruffer's flask.]    3. Sterilise a short length of rubber tubing by boiling. Transfer it  from the boiling water to a beaker of absolute alcohol.    4. When all is ready remove the rubber tube from the alcohol by means of  a pair of forceps, drain it thoroughly, and pass through the flame of a  Bunsen burner to burn off the last traces of alcohol.    5. Remove the cotton-wool wraps from the entry tube of the flask"]]]
