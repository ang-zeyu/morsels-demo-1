In a case like this, when blood has  begun to flow, there is no stopping it.    Murat knew this fatal truth, and his course of action was rapidly  decided on. Before him he had five hundred armed men, and behind him a  precipice thirty feet high: he sprang from the jagged rock on which he  was standing, and alighting on the sand, jumped up safe and sound.  General Franceschetti and his aide-de-camp Campana were able to  accomplish the jump in the same way, and all three went rapidly down to  the sea through the little wood which lay within a hundred yards of the  shore, and which hid them for a few moments from their enemies.    As they came out of the wood a fresh discharge greeted them, bullets  whistled round them, but no one was hit, and the three fugitives went on  down to the beach.    It was only then that the king perceived that the boat which had brought  them to land had gone off again. The three ships which composed the  fleet, far from remaining to guard his landing, were sailing away at  full speed into the open sea.    The Maltese, Barbara, was going off not only with Murat's fortune, but  with his hopes likewise, his salvation, his very life. They could not  believe in such treachery, and the king took it for some manoeuvre of  seamanship, and seeing a fishing-boat drawn up on the beach on some  nets, he called to his two companions, \"Launch that boat!\"    They all began to push it down to the sea with the energy of despair,  the strength of agony.    No one had dared to leap from the rock in pursuit of them; their  enemies, forced to make a detour, left them a few moments of liberty.    But soon shouts were heard: Giorgio Pellegrino, Trenta Capelli, followed  by the whole population of Pizzo, rushed out about a hundred and fifty  paces from where Murat, Franceschetti, and Campana were straining  themselves to make the boat glide down the sand.    These cries were immediately followed by a volley. Campana fell, with a  bullet through his heart.    The boat, however, was launched. Franceschetti sprang into it, Murat was  about to follow, but he had not observed that the spurs of his  riding-boots had caught in the meshes of the net. The boat, yielding to  the push he gave it, glided away, and the king fell head foremost, with  his feet on land and his face in the water. Before he had time to pick  himself up, the populace had fallen on him: in one instant they had torn  away his epaulettes, his banner, and his coat, and would have torn him  to bits himself, had not Giorgio Pellegrino and Trenta Capelli taken him  under their protection, and giving him an arm on each side, defended him  in their turn against the people. Thus he crossed the square as a  prisoner where an hour before he had walked as a king.    His captors took him to the castle: he was pushed into the common  prison, the door was shut upon him, and the king found himself among  thieves and murderers, who, not knowing him, took him for a companion in  crime, and greeted him with foul language and hoots of derision.    A quarter of an hour later the door of the gaol opened and Commander  Mattei came in: he found Murat standing with head proudly erect and  folded arms. There was an expression of indefinable loftiness in this  half-naked man whose face was stained with blood and bespattered with  mud. Mattei bowed before him.    \"Commander,\" said Murat, recognising his rank by his epaulettes, \"look  round you and tell me whether this is a prison for a king.\"    Then a strange thing happened: the criminals, who, believing Murat their  accomplice, had welcomed him with vociferations and laughter, now bent  before his royal majesty, which had not overawed Pellegrino and Trenta  Capelli, and retired silently to the depths of their dungeon.    Misfortune had invested Murat with a new power.    Commander Mattei murmured some excuse, and invited Murat to follow him  to a room that he had had prepared for him; but before going out, Murat  put his hand in his pocket and pulled out a handful of gold and let it  fall in a shower in the midst of the gaol.    \"See,\" he said, turning towards the prisoners, \"it shall not be said  that you have received a visit from a king, prisoner and crownless as he  is, without having received largesse.\"    \"Long live Joachim!\" cried the prisoners.    Murat smiled bitterly. Those same words repeated by the same number of  voices an hour before in the public square, instead of resounding in the  prison, would have made him King of Naples.    The most important events proceed sometimes from such mere trifles, that  it seems as if God and the devil must throw dice for the life or death  of men, for the rise or fall of empires.    Murat followed Commander Mattei: he led him to a little room which the  porter had put at his disposal. Mattei was going to retire when Murat  called him back.    \"Commander,\" he said, \"I want a scented bath.\"    \"Sire, it will be difficult to obtain.\"    \"Here are fifty ducats; let someone buy all the eau de Cologne that can  be obtained. Ah--and let some tailors be sent to me.\"    \"It will be impossible to find anyone here capable of making anything  but a peasant's clothes.\"    \"Send someone to Monteleone to fetch them from there.\"    The commander bowed and went out.    Murat was in his bath when the Lavaliere Alcala was announced, a General  and Governor of the town. He had sent damask coverlets, curtains, and  arm-chairs. Murat was touched by this attention, and it gave him fresh  composure. At two o'clock the same day General Nunziante arrived from  Santa-Tropea with three thousand men. Murat greeted his old acquaintance  with pleasure; but at the first word the king perceived that he was  before his judge, and that he had not come for the purpose of making a  visit, but to make an official inquiry.    Murat contented himself with stating that he had been on his way from  Corsica to Trieste with a passport from the Emperor of Austria when  stormy weather and lack of provisions had forced him to put into Pizzo.  All other questions Murat met with a stubborn silence; then at least,  wearied by his importunity--    \"General,\" he said, \"can you lend me some clothes after my bath?\"    The general understood that he could expect no more information, and,  bowing to the king, he went out. Ten minutes later, a complete uniform  was brought to Murat; he put it on immediately, asked for a pen and ink,  wrote to the commander-in-chief of the Austrian troops at Naples, to the  English ambassador, and to his wife, to tell them of his detention at  Pizzo. These letters written, he got up and paced his room for some time  in evident agitation; at last, needing fresh air, he opened the window.  There was a view of the very beach where he had been captured.    Two men were digging a hole in the sand at the foot of the little  redoubt. Murat watched them mechanically. When the two men had finished,  they went into a neighbouring house and soon came out, bearing a corpse  in their arms.    The king searched his memory, and indeed it seemed to him that in the  midst of that terrible scene he had seen someone fall, but who it was he  no longer remembered. The corpse was quite without covering, but by the  long black hair and youthful outlines the king recognised Campana, the  aide-decamp he had always loved best.    This scene, watched from a prison window in the twilight, this solitary  burial on the shore, in the sand, moved Murat more deeply than his own  fate. Great tears filled his eyes and fell silently down the leonine  face. At that moment General Nunziante came in and surprised him with  outstretched arms and face bathed with tears. Murat heard him enter and  turned round, and seeing the old soldier's surprise.    \"Yes, general,\" he said, \"I weep; I weep for that boy, just twenty-four,  entrusted to me by his parents, whose death I have brought about. I weep  for that vast, brilliant future which is buried in an unknown grave, in  an enemy's country, on a hostile shore. Oh, Campana! Campana! if ever I  am king again, I will raise you a royal tomb.\"    The general had had dinner served in an adjacent room. Murat followed  him and sat down to table, but he could not eat. The sight which he had  just witnessed had made him heartbroken, and yet without a line on his  brow that man had been through the battles of Aboukir, Eylau, and  Moscow! After dinner, Murat went into his room again, gave his various  letters to General Nunziante, and begged to be left alone. The general  went away.    Murat paced round his room several times, walking with long steps, and  pausing from time to time before the window, but without opening it.    At last he overcame a deep reluctance, put his hand on the bolt and drew  the lattice towards him.    It was a calm, clear night: one could see the whole shore. He looked for  Campana's grave. Two dogs scratching the sand showed him the spot.    The king shut the window violently, and without undressing threw himself  onto his bed. At last, fearing that his agitation would be attributed to  personal alarm, he undressed and went to bed, to sleep, or seem to sleep  all night.    On the morning of the 9th the tailors whom Murat had asked for arrived.  He ordered a great many clothes, taking the trouble to explain all the  details suggested by his fastidious taste. He was thus employed when  General Nunziante came in. He listened sadly to the king's commands. He  had just received telegraphic despatches ordering him to try the King of  Naples by court-martial as a public enemy. But he found the king so  confident, so tranquil, almost cheerful indeed, that he had not the  heart to announce his trial to him, and took upon himself to delay the  opening of operation until he received written instructions.

Maritime claims  This entry includes the following claims, the definitions of which are  excerpted from the Law of the Sea (LOS) Convention, which alone  contains the full and definitive descriptions:       contiguous zone - according to the LOS Convention (Article 33),  this is a zone contiguous to a coastal State's territorial sea, over  which it may exercise the control necessary to:  prevent infringement  of its customs, fiscal, immigration, or sanitary laws and regulations  within its territory or territorial sea; punish infringement of the  above laws and regulations committed within its territory or  territorial sea; the contiguous zone may not extend beyond 24 nautical  miles from the baselines from which the breadth of the territorial sea  is measured (e.g. the US has claimed a 12-mile contiguous zone in  addition to its 12-mile territorial sea)       continental shelf - the LOS Convention (Article 76) defines the  continental shelf of a coastal State as comprising the seabed and  subsoil of the submarine areas that extend beyond its territorial sea  throughout the natural prolongation of its land territory to the outer  edge of the continental margin, or to a distance of 200 nautical miles  from the baselines from which the breadth of the territorial sea is  measured where the outer edge of the continental margin does not extend  up to that distance; the continental margin comprises the submerged  prolongation of the landmass of the coastal State, and consists of the  seabed and subsoil of the shelf, the slope and the rise; it does not  include the deep ocean floor with its oceanic ridges or the subsoil  thereof       exclusive economic zone (EEZ) - the LOS Convention (Part V)  defines the EEZ as a zone beyond and adjacent to the territorial sea in  which a coastal State has: sovereign rights for the purpose of  exploring and exploiting, conserving and managing the natural  resources, whether living or non-living, of the waters superjacent to  the seabed and of the seabed and its subsoil, and with regard to other  activities for the economic exploitation and exploration of the zone,  such as the production of energy from the water, currents, and winds;  jurisdiction with regard to the establishment and use of artificial  islands, installations, and structures; marine scientific research; the  protection and preservation of the marine environment; the outer limit  of the exclusive economic zone shall not exceed 200 nautical miles from  the baselines from which the breadth of the territorial sea is measured       exclusive fishing zone - while this term is not used in the LOS  Convention, some States (e.g. the United Kingdom) have chosen not to  claim an EEZ, but rather to claim jurisdiction over the living  resources off their coast; in such cases, the term exclusive fishing  zone is often used       territorial sea - the sovereignty of a coastal State extends  beyond its land territory and internal waters to an adjacent belt of  sea, described as the territorial sea in the LOS Convention (Part II);  this sovereignty extends to the air space over the territorial sea as  well as its underlying seabed and subsoil; every State has the right to  establish the breadth of its territorial sea up to a limit not  exceeding 12 nautical miles    Median Age  This entry is the age that divides a population into two numerically  equal groups; that is, half the people are younger than this age and  half are older. It is a single index that summarizes the age  distribution of a population. Currently, the median age ranges from a  low of about 15 in Uganda and Gaza Strip to 40 or more in several  European countries and Japan. See the entry for \"Age structure\" for the  importance of a younger versus an older age structure and, by  implication, a lower versus a higher median age.    Merchant marine  Merchant marine may be defined as all ships engaged in the carriage of  goods; or all commercial vessels (as opposed to all nonmilitary ships),  which excludes tugs, fishing vessels, offshore oil rigs, etc.; or a  grouping of merchant ships by nationality or register. This entry  contains information in two subfields - total and ships by type. Total  includes the total number of ships (1,000 GRT or over), total DWT for  those ships, and total GRT for those ships. DWT or dead weight tonnage  is the total weight of cargo, plus bunkers, stores, etc. that a ship  can carry when immersed to the appropriate load line. GRT or gross  register tonnage is a figure obtained by measuring the entire sheltered  volume of the ship available for cargo and passengers and converting it  to tons on the basis of 100 cubic feet per ton; there is no stable  relationship between GRT and DWT. Ships by type includes a listing of  barge carriers, bulk cargo ships, cargo ships, chemical tankers,  combination bulk carriers, combination ore/oil carriers, container  ships, liquefied gas tankers, livestock carriers, multifunctional  large-load carriers, petroleum tankers, passenger ships,  passenger/cargo ships, railcar carriers, refrigerated cargo ships,  roll-on/roll-off cargo ships, short-sea passenger ships, specialized  tankers, and vehicle carriers.        A captive register is a register of ships maintained by a  territory, possession, or colony primarily or exclusively for the use  of ships owned in the parent country; it is also referred to as an  offshore register, the offshore equivalent of an internal register.  Ships on a captive register will fly the same flag as the parent  country, or a local variant of it, but will be subject to the maritime  laws and taxation rules of the offshore territory. Although the nature  of a captive register makes it especially desirable for ships owned in  the parent country, just as in the internal register, the ships may  also be owned abroad. The captive register then acts as a flag of  convenience register, except that it is not the register of an  independent state.       A flag of convenience register is a national register offering  registration to a merchant ship not owned in the flag state. The major  flags of convenience (FOC) attract ships to their registers by virtue  of low fees, low or nonexistent taxation of profits, and liberal  manning requirements. True FOC registers are characterized by having  relatively few of the registered ships actually owned in the flag  state. Thus, while virtually any flag can be used for ships under a  given set of circumstances, an FOC register is one where the majority  of the merchant fleet is owned abroad. It is also referred to as an  open register.       A flag state is the nation in which a ship is registered and which  holds legal jurisdiction over operation of the ship, whether at home or  abroad. Maritime legislation of the flag state determines how a ship is  crewed and taxed and whether a foreign-owned ship may be placed on the  register.       An internal register is a register of ships maintained as a subset  of a national register. Ships on the internal register fly the national  flag and have that nationality but are subject to a separate set of  maritime rules from those on the main national register. These  differences usually include lower taxation of profits, use of foreign  nationals as crewmembers, and, usually, ownership outside the flag  state (when it functions as an FOC register). The Norwegian  International Ship Register and Danish International Ship Register are  the most notable examples of an internal register. Both have been  instrumental in stemming flight from the national flag to flags of  convenience and in attracting foreign-owned ships to the Norwegian and  Danish flags.       A merchant ship is a vessel that carries goods against payment of  freight; it is commonly used to denote any nonmilitary ship but  accurately restricted to commercial vessels only.       A register is the record of a ship's ownership and nationality as  listed with the maritime authorities of a country; also, it is the  compendium of such individual ships' registrations. Registration of a  ship provides it with a nationality and makes it subject to the laws of  the country in which registered (the flag state) regardless of the  nationality of the ship's ultimate owner.    Military  This category includes the entries dealing with a country's military  structure, manpower, and expenditures.    Military branches  This entry lists the names of the ground, naval, air, marine, and other  defense or security forces.    Military expenditures - dollar figure  This entry gives current military expenditures in US dollars; the  figure is calculated by multiplying the estimated defense spending in  percentage terms by the gross domestic product (GDP) calculated on an  exchange rate basis not purchasing power parity (PPP) terms.  Dollar  figures for military expenditures should be treated with caution  because of different price patterns and accounting methods among  nations, as well as wide variations in the strength of their  currencies.    Military expenditures - percent of GDP  This entry gives current military expenditures as an estimated percent  of gross domestic product (GDP).    Military manpower - availability  This entry gives the total numbers of males and females age 15-49 and  assumes that every individual is fit to serve.    Military manpower - fit for military service  This entry gives the number of males and females age 15-49 fit for  military service. This is a more refined measure of potential military  manpower availability which tries to correct for the health situation  in the country and reduces the maximum potential number to a more  realistic estimate of the actual number fit to serve.    Military manpower - military age  This entry gives the minimum age at which an individual may volunteer  for military service or be subject to conscription.    Military"]]]
