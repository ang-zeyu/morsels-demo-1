Reverting to Antonello, we are told by Borghini and Ridolfi, that Gian  Bellini, having assumed the dress and character of a Venetian gentleman,  for the pretended purpose of having his portrait taken, penetrated by  this disguise into the studio of the Messinese; and watching him while  he painted, discovered the whole secret of the new method, which he  speedily applied. But Zanetti conjectures that Antonello was not very  jealous of his secret, by which means it was quickly diffused among the  different professors of the art. And this is clearly shewn by a picture  of Vivarini, coloured in oil, as early as 1473, no less than by others  from different hands in the years following. Argenville even goes  farther; for he asserts that such was the generosity with which  Antonello taught in Venice, that he drew a crowd of pupils, who assisted  in spreading a knowledge of the discovery through all parts. And among  these we find several foreigners, such as Theodore Harlem, Quintinus  Messis, along with several others mentioned in the preface to the third  volume, p. iii. This we are likewise inclined to admit during the period  of his public instructions in the city.    All that now remains before we reach the times of Titian and Giorgione,  is comprised in that last stage of the art which, in every school, has  opened a path to the golden period which ensued. The masters who were to  distinguish the stage alluded to, in Venice, as in almost all other  parts, are found to retain traces of the ancient stiffness of manner,  and sometimes exhibit, like the naturalists, imperfect forms copied from  the life; as, for instance, in those extravagantly long and spare  figures which we noticed in Pisanello. In Venice such forms were in high  repute with Mansueti, Sebastiani, and other of their contemporaries, nor  were they disliked by the Bellini themselves. And, indeed, where they  selected good proportions, they are apt to arrest the attention by that  simplicity, purity, care, and, as it were timidity of design, which  attempts to avoid every approach to exaggeration. Such artists we might  suppose to have been educated by the more ancient Greek sculptors, in  whose works the exhibition of truth attracts the spectator, like that of  grandeur in others. Their heads, more particularly, are correct and  fine; consisting of portraits taken from the life, both among the  populace, and among persons of superior birth, whether distinguished for  learning, or for their military exploits. And to this practice, familiar  also to artists of the thirteenth century, we are indebted for many  likenesses which were copied at the instance of Giovio, for his museum.  Thence they were again multiplied both by painting and engraving, in  different parts of the world. Often also the artist of those times  inserted his own portrait in his composition; a circumstance so  favourable to Vasari's history; but this species of ostentation was  gradually abandoned as real cultivation in Italy advanced. But then, as  in the heroic and still more uncivilized times, such species of boasting  was not esteemed offensive: and surely, if the literati of the  fourteenth century were in the habit of extolling themselves in their  own works; if the typographers were so fond of exalting themselves and  their editions by superb titles, and more vaunting epigrams, even to a  ridiculous degree; the more modest ambition of sometimes handing down  their own features to posterity, may be excused in our painters.    The colours of these artists are likewise simple and natural, though not  always in union, more especially with the ground, nor sufficiently  broken by the chiaroscuro. But above all, they are most remarkable for  the extreme simplicity of the composition of their pieces. It was very  seldom they inserted histories, it being sufficient for the ambition of  those times to give a representation of our Lady upon a throne,  surrounded with a number of saints, such as the devotion of each was  supposed to require. Nor were those drawn in the manner they had before  been, all erect at equal distances, and in the least studied motions;  but their authors attempted to give them some degree of contrast, so  that while one was drawn gazing upon the Virgin, another appeared  reading a book; if this were in a kneeling attitude, that is seen  standing erect. The national genius, always lively and joyous, even then  sought to develop itself in more brilliant colours than those of any  other school. And, perhaps, in order that the figures, of such glowing  tints, might stand in bolder relief, they kept the colour of the airs  most generally pale and languid. They aimed, indeed, as much as lay in  their power, at enlivening their compositions with the most pleasing  images; freely introducing into their sacred pieces, sportive cherubs,  drawn as if vieing with each other in airy grace and agility; some in  the act of singing, some of playing: and not unfrequently bearing little  baskets of fruit and flowers so exquisitely drawn as to appear moist  with recent dew. In the drapery of their figures they were simple and  natural; the most exempt perhaps from that trite and exact folding, as  well as from that manner of bandaging the bodies so common in Mantegna,  and which infected some other schools.    Nor did they lay small stress upon certain accessaries of their art,  such as the thrones, which they composed in the richest and most  ostentatious manner; and the landscapes, which they drew with an  astonishing degree of truth from nature, besides the architecture  frequently constructed in the forms of porticos or tribunes. It may  sometimes be observed, also, that adapting themselves to the workmanship  and to the design of the altar, they feigned a continuation of it within  the painting, so that by the resemblance of colour and of taste, the eye  is deceived, the illusion produced rendering it doubtful where the  exterior ornament[27] terminates, and where the picture begins. We ought  not, therefore, easily to give credit to certain writers who have  undervalued the merits of such masters, pronouncing their labours  mechanical, as those of mere practical artificers, inasmuch as Serlio is  known to have supplied several of them with architectural designs.[28]  We ought rather to subscribe to the opinion of Daniel Barbaro, whose  extensive learning did not prevent him, in his work entitled _Pratica di  Prospettiva_, from expressing his admiration of them, even from the  commencement, as follows: \"In this art they left many fine remnants of  excellent works, in which we behold not only landscapes, mountains,  woods, and edifices, all admirably designed; but even the human form,  and other animals, with lines drawn to the eye, as if to a centre placed  in the most exact perspective. But in what manner, and by what rules  they proceeded, no author of whom I am aware, has left any account to  instruct us.\"    As this progress of style was more greatly promoted by Gian Bellini than  by any other master, with him I shall commence my account, afterwards  proceeding to treat of his contemporaries, and such of his scholars as  more or less resembled him. Nor, I flatter myself, will it be unpleasing  to the reader, to find mention of the imitation of Giorgione and of  Titian, as it were anticipated, inasmuch as it happens with the  professors of the art of painting, as occasionally with those writers  who have flourished on the confines of two ages; that their style to a  certain degree seems to partake of the colour of both. Thus Giovanni  Bellini himself will afford us, in his numerous productions, which  commence before 1464, and continue down to the year 1516, a sort of  regular gradation of his progress, that may be considered, at the same  time, the progress of his school. Even in his earliest pictures, we  trace the ambition of the artist to ennoble and to enlarge the national  manner. The noble house of their Excellencies Corner, which at the time  of the Queen of Cyprus, gave frequent commissions to his hand, possesses  several specimens of his first style, proceeding gradually to others  appearing always to grow more beautiful. Among these last is a San  Francesco drawn amidst a thick wood; a piece that might well excite the  envy of the best landscape masters themselves. Having reached the period  of 1488, in which he produced an altarpiece still preserved in the  sacristy of the Conventuali, we find he extorts the praises of Vasari,  no less as a good mannerist than a fine designer. With still greater  success he executed other works from the examples afforded by Giorgione.  It was then he conceived his subjects more boldly, gave rotundity to his  forms, and warmth to his colours; he passed more naturally from  contrasted tints, his naked figures became more select, his drapery more  imposing; and if he had succeeded in acquiring a more perfect degree of  softness and delicacy in his contours, he might have been held up as one  of the most finished examples of the modern style. Neither Pietro  Perugino, Ghirlandajo, nor Mantegna attained to it in an equal degree.  The lover of art will find various specimens of him, both in Venice and  elsewhere. His altarpiece, painted for San Zaccaria, in 1505, is well  worthy his attention, as well as that of S. Giobbe, of the date of 1510.  To these we may add a Bacchanal, in the villa Aldobrandini, at Rome,  dated 1514, which, on account of the artist's advanced age, was left  imperfect. I have seen other pictures by his hand, without date, but of  striking merit; more especially a Virgin in the cathedral of Bergamo; a  Baptism of our"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3470"],[0,"Such Is Life (#7)"],[1,"a presentiment that something'll happen before to-morrow night.  Just mark my words.\"    A constrained silence fell on the grown-up children, till Willoughby  politely sought to restore ease by contributing his quota  to the evening's feast of reason--    \"There occurs to my mind a capital thing,\" he said; \"a capital thing, indeed,  though apropos of nothing in particular.  A student, returning from a stroll,  encountered a countryman, carrying a hare in his hand.  'Friend,'  said the student quietly, 'is that thine own hare or a wig?'  The joke,  of course, lies in the play on the word 'hare'.\"    Willoughby's courteous effort was worse than wasted,  for the general depression deepened.    \"You're right, Thompson,\" said Cooper, at length.  \"Mostly everybody's got  a curse on them.  I got a curse on me.  I got it through swearin'  and Sabbath-breakin'.  I've tried to knock off swearin' fifty dozen times,  but I might as well try to fly.  Last time I tried to knock it off was when  I left Nyngan for Kenilworth, four months ago; but there happened to be  a two-hundredweight bag o' rice in the bottom o' the load;  an' something tore her, an' she started leakin' through the cracks  in the floor o' the wagon; an' I could n't git at her no road,  for there was seven ton on top of her; an' the blasted stuff  it kep' dribble-dribble till you could 'a' tracked me at a gallop  for over a hundred mile; an' me swearin' at it till I was black in the face;  an' it always stopped dribblin' at night, like as if it was to aggravate a man.  If it had n't been for that rice, I'd 'a' kep' from swearin' that trip;  an' then, comin' down from Kenilworth with Thompson, I'd 'a' kep' from it easy;  for Thompson he never swears.  I give him credit for that much.\"    \"I don't claim any credit,\" remarked Thompson, with the unconscious  spiritual swagger which so often antecedes, and possibly generates, lapse.  \"I never could see that swearing did any good; so I just say to myself,  'You'd like to come out, would you?--well, then, once for all, you won't.'\"    \"You're a happy man, curse and all,\" replied the giant gloomily.  \"For my own part, I was brought up careful, but I've turned out  a (adj.) failure.  Nobody would think, seeing me so brisk an' cheerful,  that I got more worry nor anybody on'y myself could stand.  I got more trouble nor all you fellers put together.\"  He paused,  evidently battling feebly with that impulse which bids us ease  the loaded breast, even when discovery's pain.  His voice was even lower  and sadder as he resumed:    \"My father he was well off, with a comfortable place of his own  on the Hawkesbury; an' there was on'y me an' my sister Molly;  for my mother died of a cold she caught when I was about twelve or fourteen,  and Molly she was hardly so old.  If you was to travel the country,  you wouldn't meet another man like my ole dad.  He was what you might call\"----    \"My farther he was a sojer,\" interposed Dixon.  \"He could whack any man  of his weight in the 40th.  Las' word he says to me:  'Bob,' says he;  'be a man--an' keep Injun ink off o' yer arms, for you never know,' says he,  'what you might do.' \"    \"Not many men like my ole dad,\" pursued Cooper.  \"Fetch up your youngsters  in the natur' an' admiration o' the Lord, an' don't be frightened  to dress the knots off o' them.  That was his idear, an' he went through  with it straight.  'William,' says he to me; 'if I catch a oath  out o' your mouth, I'll welt the (adj.) hide off o' you ;' an' many's the time  he done it.  'Always show respect to an ole man or an ole woman,' says he;  'an' never kick up a row with nobody; an' when you see a row startin',  you strike in an' squash it, for blessed be the peacemakers;  an' never you git drunk, nor yet laugh at a drunk man; an' never take  your Maker's name in vain, or by (sheol) He'll make it hot for you.'  That was my father's style with me.  Same with my sister.  He used to lay  a bit of a buggy-trace on the table, after supper:  'There, Molly,' says he;  'that's for girls as goes gallivantin' about after night ;'  an' many's the dose of it Molly got for flyin' round in the moonlight.  Consequently, as you might say, she growed up to be the best girl,  an' the cleverest, in the district.  The other girls was weeds aside of her;  she stood inches higher nor any o' them, an' she was a picter' to look at.  Strong as whalebone, she was, an' not a lazy bone in her body.  She was different from me in regard o' learnin', for she always liked  to have her nose in a book, an' she went a lot to school.  An' as for singin'  or playin' anything in the shape o' music--why, there was nobody about  could hold a candle to her.  She was fair mad on it; an' my ole dad  he sent her to Sydney for over a year o' purpose to fetch her out.  Peanner, or flute, or fiddle, or the curliest instrument out of a brass band,  it was all one to her; it come sort o' natural to her to fetch music  out of anything.  Pore Molly!\"  Cooper paused awhile before he resumed----    \"She never took up with none o' the fellers.  I knowed fellers try to kiss her;  but her style was to stiffen them with a clip under the ear,  an' they sort o' took the hint, an' never come back.  But by-'n'-by a man  from the Queensland border, he bought the place next ours but one;  an' our two fam'lies got acquainted.  Wonderful clever ole feller he was,  in regard o' findin' out new gases, an' smells, an' cures for snake-bites,  an' stuff that would go off like a cannon if you looked at it.  This cove had got one son an' two daughters, an' his missis was sickly.  Well, the son he was a young chap, about my own age at the time\"----    \"An' how old was you then?\" demanded Mosey.    \"About two-an'-twenty.  He seemed to be a fine, off-handed, straightforrid,  well-edicated young feller; an' me an' him we soon got great cronies;  an' by-'n'-by I seen he was collared on Molly, an' she was collared on him.  Well, thank God! he's got a curse on him that he won't get rid of in a hurry.  Thank God for that much!\"    \"Ruined her?\" queried Mosey briskly.    Cooper passed the question with unconscious dignity, and resumed.  \"Things went on this way for a couple o' year; an' this feller's people  was agreeable; an', to make a long story short, the time was fixed  for two months on ahead.\"    \"Your father was agreeable, of course?\" said Thompson.    \"He was dead,\" replied Cooper reverently.  \"Gone to eternity, I hope.  He deserved to go there if ever any livin' man did.  He died about a year after  these people come to settle near our place.\"    \"What was the young feller's name?\" queried Mosey.    \"Never you mind.  Well, to make a long story short, one day pore Molly  wanted to go somewhere, an' she jumped on-to a horse I'd just left in the yard,  an' she shoved her foot in the stirrup-leather; an' the horse he was  a reg'lar devil; an' he played up with her in the yard; an' her heel  went through the loop o' the leather, an' she come off an' hung by her ankle;  an' the horse he was shod all round, an' he kicked her  in the face\"--Cooper paused.    \"Killed her?\" suggested Mosey.    \"I caught the horse, an' got her clear, an' carried her into the house,  all covered with blood, an' just like a corp; an' I left her there  with the married woman we had, while I went for the doctor.  Well,  there she laid for weeks, half-ways between dead an' alive, an' me  like a feller in a dream, thinkin' an' thinkin', an' not able to rec'lect  anything but the hammerin's I used to give her, an' the things  I used to take off of her, an' set her cryin'.  I would n't go through  that lot agen, not if I got a pension for it.  Well, by-'n'-by  she got her senses complete; an' this young feller he had been hangin' about  the house every day, sayin' nothing to nobody; but when she begun  to come round, he begun to-keep away.  At last she was all right  in regard o' health, but she was disfigured for life; she had to wear  a crape veil down to her mouth.  Then the young feller he used to come  sometimes an' just shake hands with her, but otherways he would n't touch her  with a forty-foot pole.  Then he begun to stop away altogether;  an' by-'n'-by he suddenly got married to a girl out o' the lowest pub. for  ten mile round; an' his father--real decent ole bloke he was--he told him  never to show his face about the place agen.  But there was no end  o' go in him.  He had an uncle in Sydney, middlin' rich,  a ship-chandler, an' this\"--    \"What's a ship-chandler?\" demanded Mosey.    \"A man that supplies candles to ships,\" I replied.    \"This uncle he'd had a saw-mill left on his hands, out somewhere south;  an' he give the saw-mill to the young feller on sort o' time-payment;  an' I believe he got on splendid for a couple or three year;  an' his wife had one picaninny--so we come to hear--an' suddenly  he balled her out with some other feller.  I on'y got hearsay for it,  mind, but I know it's true; for it's just what ought to happen.  Anyhow,  the hand of God was on him, an' he got it hot an' heavy.  Accordin' to accounts, he sold out, an' give her the bulk o' the cash,  an' then he travelled.  Last year, out on the Namoi, a man told me he seen him  bullock drivin' in the Bland country, seven year ago.  It might be him,  or it might n't.  I don't know, an' I don't want to know; for he's done  all the harm he could.  I got to thank him for all my troubles.  On'y for him,  I'd 'a' been livin' comfortable in the ole spot still.  I don't mention  these things not once every three year on a average; but sometimes  when you think I'm pleasant an' cheerful, I'm fair wild with thinkin' about  that blasted cur; an' you chaps fetched him up fresh in my mind to-night.\"    \"And the poor girl--is she still at home?\" asked Thompson.    \"No,\" replied Cooper hoarsely; \"she's somewhere at the bottom  o' the Hawkesbury river; an' there's no more home.  About three or four year  after her accident, I was away in"]]]
