[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3462"],[0,"More Hunting Wasps (#7)"],[1,"species: C. aurata, C.  morio and C. floricola. Most of them belong to the first species. Their  larvae, which are easily recognized by their singular talent for walking  on their backs with their legs in the air, are numbered by the hundred.  Every age is represented, from the new born grub to the podgy larva on  the point of building its shell.    This time the problem of the victuals is solved. When I compare the  larval slough sticking to the Scolia's cocoons with the Cetonia-larvae  or, better, with the skin cast by these larvae, under cover of the  cocoon, at the moment of the nymphal transformation, I establish an  absolute identity. The Two-banded Scolia rations each of her eggs with  a Cetonia-grub. Behold the riddle which my irksome searches in the Bois  des Issards had not enabled me to solve. To-day, at my threshold, the  difficult problem becomes child's play. I can investigate the question  easily to the fullest possible extent; I need not put myself out at all;  at any hour of the day, at any period that seems favourable, I have  the requisite elements before my eyes. Ah, dear village, so poor, so  countrified, how happily inspired was I when I came to ask of you  a hermit's retreat, where I could live in the company of my beloved  insects and, in so doing, set down not too unworthily a few chapters of  their wonderful history!    According to the Italian observer Passerini, the Garden Scolia feeds  her family on the larvae of Oryctes nasicornis, in the heaps of old  tan-waste removed from the hot-houses. I do not despair of seeing  this colossal Wasp coming to establish herself one day in my heaps of  leaf-mould, in which the same Scarabaeid is swarming. Her rarity in  my part of the country is probably the only cause that has hitherto  prevented the realization of my wishes.    I have just shown that the Two-banded Scolia feeds in infancy on  Cetonia-larvae and particularly on those of C. aurata, C. morio and C.  floricola. These three species dwell together in the rubbish-heap just  explored; their larvae differ so little that I should have to examine  them minutely to distinguish the one from the other; and even then I  should not be certain of succeeding. It seems probable that the Scolia  does not choose between them, that she uses all three indiscriminately.  Perhaps she even assails other larvae, inhabitants, like the foregoing,  of heaps of rotting vegetable-matter. I therefore set down the Cetonia  genus generally as forming the prey of the Two-banded Scolia.    Lastly, round about Avignon, the Interrupted Scolia used to prey upon  the larva of the Shaggy Anoxia (A. villosa). At Serignan, which is  surrounded by the same kind of sandy soil, without other vegetation than  a few sparse seed-bearing grasses, I find her rationing her young with  the Morning Anoxia (A. matutinalis). Oryctes, Cetoniae and Anoxiae  in the larval state: here then is the prey of the three Scoliae whose  habits we know. The three Beetles are Lamellicorns, Scarabaeidae. We  shall have occasion later to consider the reason of this very striking  coincidence.    For the moment, the business in hand is to move the heap of leaf-mould  to some other place, with the wheelbarrow. This is Favier's work, while  I myself collect the disturbed population in glass jars, in order to put  them back into the new rubbish-heap with all the consideration which  my plans owe to them. The laying-time has not yet set in, for I find  no eggs, no young Scolia-larvae. September apparently will be the  propitious month. But there are bound to be many injured in the course  of this upheaval; some of the Scoliae have flown away who will perhaps  have a certain difficulty in finding the new site; I have disarranged  everything in the overturned heap. To allow tranquility to be restored  and habit to resume its rounds, to give the population time to increase  and replace the fugitives and the injured, it would be best, I think, to  leave the heap alone this year and not to resume my investigations until  the next. After the thorough confusion due to the removal, I should  jeopardize success by being too precipitate. Let us wait one year more.  I decide accordingly, curb my impatience and resign myself. We will  simply confine ourselves to enlarging the heap, when the leaves begin to  fall, by accumulating the refuse that strews the paddock, so that we may  have a richer field of operations.    In the following August, my visits to the mound of leaf-mould become a  daily habit. By two o'clock in the afternoon, when the sun has cleared  the adjacent pine-trees and is shining on the heap, numbers of male  Scoliae arrive from the neighbouring fields, where they have been  slaking their thirst on the eryngo-heads. Incessantly coming and going  with an indolent flight, they circle round the heap. If some female  rise from the soil, those who have seen her dart forward. A not very  turbulent affray decides which of the suitors shall be the possessor;  and the couple fly away over the wall. This is a repetition of what I  used to see in the Bois des Issards. By the time that August is over.  The males have ceased to show themselves. The mothers do not appear  either: they are busy underground, establishing their families.    On the 2nd of September, I decide upon a search with my son Emile,  who handles the fork and the shovel, while I examine the clods dug up.  Victory! A magnificent result, finer than any that my fondest ambition  would have dared to contemplate! Here is a vast array of Cetonia-larvae,  all flaccid, motionless, lying on their backs, with a Scolia's egg  sticking to the centre of their abdomen; here are young Scolia-larvae  dipping their heads into the entrails of their victims; here are others  farther advanced, munching their last mouthfuls of a prey which is  drained dry and reduced to a skin; here are some laying the foundation  of their cocoons with a reddish silk, which looks as if it had been dyed  in Bullock's blood; here are some whose cocoons are finished. There is  plenty of everything, from the egg to the larva whose period of activity  is over. I mark the 2nd of September as a red-letter day; it has given  me the final key to a riddle which has kept me in suspense for nearly  half a century.    I place my spoils religiously in shallow, wide-mouthed glass jars  containing a layer of finely sifted mould. In this soft bed, which is  identical in character with the natal surroundings, I make some faint  impressions with my fingers, so many cavities, each of which receives  one of my subjects, one only. A pane of glass covers the mouth of the  receptacle. In this way I prevent a too rapid evaporation and keep my  nurselings under my eyes without fear of disturbing them. Now that all  this is in order, let us proceed to record events.    The Cetonia-larvae which I find with a Scolia's egg upon their ventral  surface are distributed in the mould at random, without special  cavities, without any sign of some sort of structure. They are smothered  in the mould, just as are the larvae which have not been injured by the  Wasp. As my excavations in the Bois des Issards told me, the Scolia does  not prepare a lodging for her family; she knows nothing of the art of  cell-building. Her offspring occupies a fortuitous abode, on which the  mother expends no architectural pains. Whereas the other Hunting Wasps  prepare a dwelling to which the provisions are carried, sometimes from  a distance, the Scolia confines herself to digging her bed of leaf-mould  until she comes upon a Cetonia-larva. When she finds a quarry, she stabs  it on the spot, in order to immobilize it; and, again on the spot, she  lays an egg on the ventral surface of the paralysed creature. That is  all. The mother goes in quest of another prey without troubling further  about the egg which has just been laid. There is no effort of carting  or building. At the very spot where the Cetonia-grub is caught and  paralysed, the Scolia-larva hatches, grows and weaves its cocoon. The  establishment of the family is thus reduced to the simplest possible  expression.        CHAPTER 3. A DANGEROUS DIET.    The Scolia's egg is in no way exceptional in shape. It is white,  cylindrical, straight and about four millimetres long by one millimetre  thick. (About.156 x.039 inch.--Translator's Note.) It is fixed, by its  fore-end, upon the median line of the victim's abdomen, well to the rear  of the legs, near the beginning of the brown patch formed by the mass of  food under the skin.    I watch the hatching. The grub, still wearing upon its hinder parts the  delicate pellicle which it has just shed, is fixed to the spot to which  the egg itself adhered by its cephalic extremity. A striking spectacle,  that of the feeble creature, only this moment hatched, boring, for  its first mouthful, into the paunch of its enormous prey, which  lies stretched upon its back. The nascent tooth takes a day over the  difficult task. Next morning the skin has yielded; and I find the  new-born larva with its head plunged into a small, round, bleeding  wound.    In size the grub is the same as the egg, whose dimensions I have  just given. Now the Cetonia-larva, to meet the Scolia's requirements,  averages thirty millimetres in length by nine in thickness (1.17 x.35  inch.--Translator's Note.), whence follows that its bulk is six or seven  hundred times as great as that of the newly-hatched grub of the  Scolia. Here certainly is a quarry which, were it active and capable of  wriggling and biting, would expose the nurseling to terrible attacks.  The danger has been averted by the mother's stiletto; and the fragile  grub attacks the monster's paunch with as little hesitation as though it  were sucking the breast.    Day by day the young Scolia's head penetrates farther into the Cetonia's  belly. To pass through the narrow orifice made in the skin, the  fore-part of the body contracts and lengthens out,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34634"],[0,"A Narrative of the Death of Captain James Cook (#7)"],[1,"t, as trophies of her father's  victory. The queen set a great value upon it, and was not willing to  part with it for any of our iron ware; but happening to cast her eyes  upon a wash-hand bason of mine, it struck her fancy, and she offered to  exchange; I accepted of her proposal, and the bones of the unfortunate  Mahowra (Meheula) came at last into my possession.
