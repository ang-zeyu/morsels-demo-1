Fortunately the helmsman made a grab at me as I  went past, and I managed to scramble on board again. Not that I should  have sunk for I can float like a cork; but there are a good many sharks  cruising about in those waters, and it is safer inside a boat than it is  out. You see, Miss Renshaw, there are advantages in being stout. I  should not wonder if your brother got just my size one day. My figure  was very much like his once.\"    \"Oh, I hope not!\" Marion exclaimed. \"That would be dreadful! No; I don't  mean that,\" she went on hurriedly as Mr. Atherton's face assumed an  expression of shocked surprise. \"I mean that, although of course there  may be many advantages in being stout, there are advantages in being  thin too.\"    \"I admit that,\" Mr. Atherton agreed; \"but look at the disadvantages. A  stout man escapes being sent trotted about on messages. Nobody would  think of asking him to climb a ladder. He is not expected to dance. The  thin man is squeezed into any odd corner; and is not treated with half  the consideration that is given to a fat man. He worries about trifles,  and has none of the quiet contentment that characterizes stout people.  A stout man's food always agrees with him, or else he would not be  stout; while the thin man suffers indigestion, dyspepsia, and perhaps  jaundice. You see, my dear young lady, that almost all the advantages  are on our side. Of course you will say I could not climb a ladder, but  then I do not want to climb a ladder. I could not make the ascent of  Matterhorn; but it is much more pleasant to sit at the bottom and see  fools do it. I could not very well ride a horse unless it were a  dray-horse; but then I have no partiality for horse exercise. Altogether  I think I have every reason to be content. I can travel wherever I like,  see whatever I want to see, and enjoy most of the good things of life.\"    \"And hould your own in a scrimmage,\" Mr. Ryan put in laughing. \"I can  answer for that.\"    \"If I am pushed to it,\" Mr. Atherton said modestly, \"of course I try to  do my best.\"    \"Have you seen Mr. Atherton in a scrimmage?\" Tom Allen asked the mate.    \"I have; and a sharp one it was while it lasted.\"    \"There is no occasion to say anything about it, Ryan,\" Mr. Atherton said  hastily.    \"But no reason in life why I should not,\" the mate replied. \"What do you  say, ladies and gentleman?\"    There was a chorus of \"Go on please, do let us hear about it,\" and he  continued:    \"I don't give Mr. Atherton the credit of saving our ship in the squall,  but it would have gone badly with us if he hadn't taken part in the row  we had. You see, we had a mixed crew on board, for the most part  Chinamen and a few Lascars; for we were three years in the China Seas,  and English sailors cannot well stand the heat out there, and besides  don't like remaining in ships stopping there trading. So when, after we  arrived at Shanghai, we got orders to stop and trade out there, most of  them took their discharge, and we filled up with natives. Coming down  from Japan that voyage there was a row. I forget what their pretext was  now, but I have no doubt it was an arranged thing, and that they  intended to take the ship and run her ashore on some of the islands,  take what they fancied out of her, and make off in boats, or perhaps  take her into one of those nests of pirates that abound among the  islands.    \"They felt so certain of overpowering us, for there were only the three  officers, the boatswain, and two cabin passengers, that instead of  rising by night, when they would no doubt have succeeded, they broke  into mutiny at dinner-time--came aft in a body, clamouring that their  food was unfit to eat. Then suddenly drawing weapons from beneath their  clothes they rushed up the gangways on to the poop; and as none of us  were armed, and had no idea of what was going to take place, they would  have cut us down almost without resistance had it not been for our  friend here. He was standing just at the top of the poop ladder when  they came up, headed by their seraing. Mr. Atherton knocked the  scoundrel down with a blow of his fist, and then, catching him by the  ankles, whirled him round his head like a club and knocked the fellows  down like ninepins as they swarmed up the gangway, armed with knives and  creases.    \"The captain, who was down below, had slammed and fastened the door  opening on to the waist on seeing the fellows coming aft, and handed up  to us through the skylight some loaded muskets, and managed, by standing  on the table and taking our hands, to get up himself. Then we opened  fire upon them, and in a very few minutes drove them down. We shot six  of them. The seraing of course was killed, four of the others had their  skulls fairly broken in by the blows that they had received, and five  were knocked senseless. We chucked them down the hatchway to the others,  had up four or five of the men to work the ship, and kept the rest  fastened below until we got to Singapore and handed them over to the  authorities. They all got long terms of penal servitude. Anyhow, Mr.  Atherton saved our lives and the ship, so I think you will agree with me  that he can hold his own in a scrimmage.\"    \"It was very hot work,\" Mr. Atherton said with a laugh, \"and I did not  get cool again for two or three days afterwards. The idea of using a man  as a club was not my own. Belzoni put down a riot among his Arab  labourers, when he was excavating ruins somewhere out in Syria, I think  it was, by knocking the ringleader down and using him as a club. I had  been reading the book not long before, and it flashed across my mind as  the seraing went down that he might be utilized. Fists are all very  well, but when you have got fellows to deal with armed with knives and  other cutting instruments it is better to keep them at a distance if you  can.\"    \"That was splendid!\" Wilfrid exclaimed. \"How I should like to have seen  it!\"    \"It was good for the eyes,\" the mate said; \"and bate Donnybrook  entirely. Such a yelling and shouting as the yellow reptiles made you  never heard.\"    By this time the meal was finished, and the passengers repaired on deck  to find that the ship was just passing Sheerness.    \"Who would have thought,\" Wilfrid said to his sister as he looked at Mr.  Atherton, who had taken his seat in a great Indian reclining chair he  had brought for his own use, and was placidly smoking a cigar, \"that  that easy, placid, pleasant-looking man could be capable of such a thing  as that! Shouldn't I like to have been there!\"    \"So should I,\" Marion agreed; \"though it must have been terrible to look  at. He doesn't look as if anything would put him out. I expect Samson was  something like him, only not so stout. He seems to have been very  good-tempered except when people wanted to capture him; and was always  ready to forgive that horrid woman who tried to betray him to his  enemies. Well, everything is very nice--much nicer than I expected--and  I feel sure that we shall enjoy the voyage very much.\"          CHAPTER III    THE VOYAGE.      In addition to those already named, the _Flying Scud_ carried some  twenty other cabin passengers. She took no emigrants forward, as she was  full of cargo, and was not, moreover, going direct to New Zealand.  There were therefore only three or four young men in addition to the  Grimstones forward. The fine weather that had favoured the start  accompanied them down the channel and across the bay. Life went on  quietly on board. It was early in May when they started; and the  evenings were still too chilly to permit of any sojourn on deck after  sunset. Each day, however, the weather grew warmer, and by the time the  vessel was off the coast of Portugal the evenings were warm and balmy.    \"This is not at all what I expected,\" Marion Renshaw said, as she sat in  a deck-chair, to Mr. Atherton, who was leaning against the bulwark  smoking a cigar. \"I thought we were going to have storms, and that every  one was going to be sea-sick. That is what it is like in all the books I  have read; and I am sure that I have not felt the least bit ill from the  time we started.\"    \"You have had everything in your favour. There has been just enough  breeze to take us along at a fair rate with all our light canvas set,  and yet not enough to cause more than a ripple on the sea. The ship has  been as steady as if in port; but you must not flatter yourself this is  going to last all the time. I think we shall have a change before long.  The glass has fallen a little, and the wind has shifted its quarter two  or three times during the day. The sky, too, does not look so settled as  it has done. I think we shall have a blow before long.\"    \"What! A storm, Mr. Atherton?\"    \"No, I don't say that; but wind enough to get up a bit of sea, and to  make landsmen feel very uncomfortable.\"    \"But I suppose we should not be ill now even if it were rough, after  being a week at sea?\"    \"I do not think you would be likely to be ill so long as you might have  been had you encountered a gale directly we got out of the river, but I  think that if it comes on rough all those addicted to sea-sickness are  likely to suffer more or less. Some people are ill every time rough  weather comes along, however long the voyage. I suppose you don't know  yet whether you are a good sailor or not?\"    Marion shook her head. \"We have been at the seaside almost every year,  but we have never gone out in boats much there. Papa was always too busy  to go, and I don't think he likes it. Mother gets a bad headache, even  if she isn't ill. So I very seldom went out, and never when it was the  least rough.\"    Mr. Atherton's predictions turned out well founded. The wind got up  during the night and was blowing freshly in the morning, and only two or  three of the lady passengers made their appearance at breakfast; and  several of the gentlemen were also absent.

N, 1-1/2 mi. E Camp Crook, 1.    The white-tailed deer is less abundant in northwestern South Dakota  than is _O. hemionus_, but a number were seen by members of our parties  (in Deer Draw of the Slim Buttes, for example), and local residents  reported many sightings to us. Visher (1914:82) earlier recorded this  species as once \"fairly plentiful in the forest reserves\" in Harding  County, but stated that it had become rare when he made his biological  survey of the area in 1910 and 1912.      ~Antilocapra americana americana~ (Ord, 1815)    Pronghorn      _Specimens examined_ (2).--Sec. 28, R. 8 E, T. 23 N, 1; 12 mi. S, 10 mi.  W Buffalo, 1.    This species is the most conspicuous (and possibly the most abundant)  ungulate in Harding County. It ranges throughout the county on flat and  rolling grasslands where small groups, and occasionally herds of up to  50 individuals, were seen in 1960, 1961, 1963, 1968, and 1970. Visher  (1914:88) reported that the pronghorn was common in the area until about  1900, but that it was near the point of extinction when he visited the  county in 1910 and 1912.      ~Bison bison bison~ (Linnaeus, 1758)    Bison    According to historical accounts (Anonymous, 1959), the bison was rare  or absent in Harding County at the time of settlement in 1876. By the  early 1880's, however, herds were of regular occurrence, and there is  one record (_op. cit._: 95-96) of thousands crossing the Little Missouri  near Camp Crook in November of 1882.    One report has it that the last bison killed in the county was shot in  the summer of 1884 (_op. cit._: 73-74), but Visher (1914:88) reported  that an \"old settler\" had seen \"a small bunch in 1886.\" Visher also  reported finding bison remains, probably in 1910 or 1912, to the  northeast of the North Cave Hills and west of the South Cave Hills.      ~Ovis canadensis auduboni~ Merriam, 1901    Mountain Sheep    According to Visher (1914:88), mountain sheep formerly inhabited all the  areas of buttes in Harding County but were extirpated in the 1890's.  Sheep Mountain, a large butte just below the south end of the Slim  Buttes, was reported to be the last area in which these animals  occurred. Over and Churchill (1945:54) mentioned both the Cave Hills and  Slim Buttes as localities formerly inhabited by _O. c. auduboni_.    Early in 1961, the South Dakota Game Commission introduced 12 animals,  four rams and eight ewes, from Alberta (subspecies _O. c. canadensis_)  on the Slim Buttes, but none is known to have survived to 1968.      SPECIES OF UNVERIFIED OCCURRENCE    The ten species of mammals listed below are not known certainly to occur  in Harding County, but there is a strong likelihood that some will be  found in the area or once occurred there. Three were mentioned by Visher  (1914) as having been seen or taken in the county at the time of, or  prior to, his biological survey of 1910 and 1912, but his accounts were  not supported by adequate documentation. In addition to the kinds  listed, several other mammals, such as Keen's bat (_Myotis keenii  septentrionalis_), the red bat (_Lasiurus borealis borealis_), or the  least weasel (_Mustela nivalis campestris_) are known to occur near  enough to the area that the possibility of their presence cannot be  discounted.    ~Sorex cinereus haydeni~ Baird, 1858.--No shrews presently are known from  Harding County. This species almost certainly will be found in  relatively mesic habitats there, however, as our field parties have  taken specimens in adjacent Bowman County, North Dakota, and only a few  miles to the west of the county in the Long Pines Hills of Montana.    ~Sorex merriami merriami~ Dobson, 1890.--This shrew inhabits somewhat more  xeric areas than most other members of the genus and surely occurs in  northwestern South Dakota. Specimens are on record from western North  Dakota and northwestern Nebraska, and in the summer of 1970 a field  party from The University of Kansas took one but a half mile west of the  Harding County (state) line in Carter County, Montana.    ~Spermophilus richardsonii richardsonii~ (Sabine, 1822).--Visher (1914:88)  reported that he saw individuals of this species \"in the extreme  northwestern corner\" of Harding County. However, the limits of the  presently known range of the species are approximately 150 miles distant  from that area.    ~Sciurus niger rufiventer~ E. Geoffroy St.-Hilaire, 1803.--The fox  squirrel presently is unrecorded from much of the West River part of  South Dakota. Hoffmann _et al._ (1969:589), however, recently have  reported specimens from along the Yellowstone River in eastern Montana  and this squirrel now may occur also along the Little Missouri River. It  was not surprising, therefore, when residents of Camp Crook reported to  us that in recent years they have seen what were believed to be fox  squirrels along the Little Missouri near that town. Specimens now are  needed to verify these reports.    ~Lagurus curtatus pallidus~ (Merriam, 1888).--The sagebrush vole  undoubtedly occurs, albeit probably uncommonly, in areas of sage in  northwestern Harding County, because specimens have been taken recently  a few miles north and west of the county in North Dakota and Montana,  respectively. We trapped unsuccessfully (900 trap nights) for this vole  on sage flats to the north of Camp Crook and west of the Little Missouri  River in the summer of 1970. \"Sign,\" which appeared to be that of  _Lagurus_, was found in this area, but only _Peromyscus maniculatus_ and  _Spermophilus tridecemlineatus_ were trapped there.    ~Rattus norvegicus~ (Berkenhout, 1769).--No records of this introduced  murid are available from northwestern South Dakota, but it seems likely  that the species has reached the area.    ~Vulpes velox~ (Say, 1823).--Visher (1914:90) reported seeing a swift fox  \"along the Little Missouri Valley in North Dakota\" and further noted  that an early settler [Sol Catron] had \"trapped a few\" in Harding  County. Whatever the former status of this fox in northwestern South  Dakota may have been, the species evidently does not occur in the area  today, or is rare, and the subspecific status of _V. velox_ throughout  much of the Northern Great Plains is in question. A specimen obtained  in February of 1970 at a place 9 mi. N and 2 mi. E Scranton, Slope Co.,  North Dakota, is the only swift fox taken north of Nebraska in recent  years (Pfeifer and Hibbard, 1970:835).    ~Urocyon cinereoargenteus ocythous~ Bangs, 1899.--Jones and Henderson  (1963:288) reported a gray fox from Deer Ear Buttes, Butte Co., South  Dakota, approximately 15 miles south of the Harding County line. This  species appears to have dispersed westward in recent years, and its  future occurrence in the county is likely.    ~Gulo gulo luscus~ (Linnaeus, 1758).--The wolverine probably occurred  sparingly in northwestern South Dakota until the time of early  settlement, but we know of no verified records from Harding County or  surrounding areas. A recent report of a specimen taken south of Timber  Lake, Dewey Co., South Dakota (Jones, 1964:283), indicates that it may  again be found in the area.    ~Lynx canadensis canadensis~ Kerr, 1792.--We have no reports of this  species in Harding County save that Visher (1914:90) noted that local  residents claimed specimens had \"been taken recently in the Cave Hills.\"  Hoffmann and Pattie (1968:53) reported that the lynx occurs presently in  eastern Montana and we suspect that individuals may occasionally range  into Harding County.      ZOOGEOGRAPHIC COMMENTS    Of the 53 mammals listed in the foregoing accounts, all but one (_Mus  musculus_) are native North American species. These fall into five  rather well-defined faunal groupings as outlined by Hoffmann and Jones  (1970:364-365). A majority (27) can be characterized as \"widespread  species.\" Most of these have broad distributions over much of North  America; a few do not, but are widely enough distributed that it is  impossible to assign them with certainty to a more circumscribed  assemblage. Mammals from northwestern South Dakota that can be  characterized as widespread are: _Myotis leibii_, _Myotis lucifugus_,  _Eptesicus fuscus_, _Lasionycteris noctivagans_, _Lasiurus cinereus_,  _Castor canadensis_, _Peromyscus maniculatus_, _Ondatra zibethicus_,  _Erethizon dorsatum_, _Canis latrans_, _Canis lupus_, _Vulpes vulpes_,  _Ursus americanus_, _Ursus arctos_, _Procyon lotor_, _Mustela frenata_,  _Mustela vison_, _Taxidea taxus_, _Mephitis mephitis_, _Lutra  canadensis_, _Felis concolor_, _Lynx rufus_, _Cervus elaphus_,  _Odocoileus hemionus_, _Odocoileus virginianus_, _Antilocapra  americana_, and _Bison bison_. The above list is composed mainly of  volant or relatively large and mobile mammals, several of which occur  also in Eurasia or range well into the Neotropics.    A few widespread species deserve special comment. Two, the pronghorn and  bison, are typical inhabitants of the interior grasslands of North  America and might be considered steppe species save for the fact that  each has an extensive distribution beyond that region. Four other  species, _Erethizon dorsatum_, thought of primarily as a mammal of  coniferous forests, and _Ursus arctos_, _Taxidea taxus_, and  _Odocoileus hemionus_, all more or less western taxa, are not so broadly  distributed as are other members of this grouping. Of the five bats,  three are year-round residents, but _Lasiurus cinereus_ and evidently  _Lasionycteris noctivagans_ are migrants.    The remaining 25 kinds of mammals are representative of four regional  faunal groupings as follows: boreomontane species (10), steppe species  (nine), species with Sonoran affinities (four), and species of the  eastern deciduous forest (two).    _Boreomontane species._--"]]]
