The next day was largely sunny, with a light easterly or    southeasterly wind and temperatures of 50° to 68°. There were    comparatively few black flies and fewer mosquitoes. During a    five-hour vigil near the mouth of Little River I noticed only    about 50 Caribou, most of them passing westward by ones, twos,    and intermediate numbers up to 17 (does and fawns) in a band.    Mike Schweder reported a total of about 200 animals seen within    a few miles of camp.      The morning of August 31 was dismal and overcast, with a heavy    shower; in the afternoon the sky cleared; wind brisk, south to    west; temperature, 47° to 74.5°. Several Caribou passed along    the eastern side of Little River, and Fred Schweder, Jr.,    reported about 300 some miles north of camp, moving in a    southwesterly direction.      Clouds and rain ushered in the morning of September 1; the    afternoon was sunny; wind light to strong, west to northwest;    temperature, 48° to 60°. The next day was partly cloudy, with a    mist squall or two; wind light to brisk, northwesterly;    temperature, 38° to 51.5°. No Caribou were reported on either    day.      September 3 was largely cloudy, with some mist squalls; wind    light to moderate, northerly to easterly; temperature, 40° to    51°. There were enough black flies to be slightly troublesome.    Two bucks, two does, and a fawn were noted at Bear Slough.      September 4 was partly cloudy, with drizzling rain; wind light,    east to south and southwest; temperature, 43° to 58°. I saw    about 22 Caribou (largely does and fawns), in several different    groups, at Bear Slough and vicinity, and Fred Schweder, Jr.,    reported about 200 in the same area. Two were noted swimming to    the south side of Windy Bay.      September 5 was marked by a driving, day-long rainstorm; wind    brisk, easterly; temperature, 43° to 50°. A band of about 20    Caribou (mostly does and fawns, with several middle-aged bucks),    besides one or two single animals, were encountered at Bear    Slough.      September 6 was a cloudy, raw day, with several snow flurries;    wind brisk, northerly; temperature, 33° to 35°. Not a fly was    abroad. Two Caribou moved northwest along Little River Ridge;    a band of about 75 (mainly does and fawns, but with a fair    number of big bucks) passed in the same direction along the    Middle Ridge; and about 25 others grazed along the eastern side    of Little River. Later about 15-20 more were seen about the    mouth of Little River and on a near-by island, and eight swam    across Windy Bay to the south side. Fred reported seeing about    300 during the day north and west of camp; they were moving in a    northerly direction.      It was cloudy nearly all day on September 7; wind moderate,    northerly; temperature, 33° to 40°. No black flies were in    evidence. A dozen or more Caribou took to the water from an    island in Windy Bay and made for the north shore. A band of    about 25 passed along Little River Ridge toward the river's    mouth.      September 8 was mostly cloudy; wind moderate to strong,    southeasterly; temperature, 37° to 42°. Fred reported a band of    about 100 Caribou crossing the mouth of Little River toward the    west. A dozen or more swam southward over Windy Bay at the usual    crossing-place. Anoteelik brought in 13 tongues from that many    freshly killed Caribou; he had secured them with a .22 rifle.      A driving gale from the east, with rain and sleet, continued    through the day on September 9; temperature, 36° to 37°. A    solitary buck inspected our camp from the south side of Windy    River, then retreated.      An overcast sky, with some drizzle and sleet, prevailed on    September 10; wind light, east to northeast; temperature, 35.5°    to 42.5°. No flies present for some days past. Fred reported    about 20 Caribou moving westward in the vicinity of Little    River.      On September 11 clouds and mist squalls in the morning gave way    to sunshine in the afternoon; wind light, easterly; temperature,    37° to 45.5°. Caribou were noted as follows: five on the east    side of Little River; two does and a fawn on an island in Windy    Bay; a doe and a fawn swimming northward across this bay; half a    dozen on Josie's Hill. During a flight from Churchill to Nueltin    Lake on this day, Charles Schweder detected no Caribou at all,    and concluded that the bulk of the migrating herds had by this    time passed to the southward of his course. During the latter    part of August, while descending the Thlewiaza River from    Nueltin Lake to Hudson Bay, he had seen thousands of the    animals--as many as 5,000 in a single day, although no more than    500 in a single herd.      Sun, clouds, and rain marked September 12; wind moderate to    light, south to west; temperature, 48° to 60°. Only two Caribou    were reported.      September 13 was cloudy, with intermittent mist squalls and a    little sun; wind light to brisk, northerly; temperature, 34° to    about 44°. Two bands of Caribou (of four and five animals)    appeared near the mouth of Windy River.      It was generally cloudy, with a snow squall, on September 14;    wind brisk to light, northerly; temperature, 33° to 41°. A doe    and a fawn, proceeding northward, and four or five other Caribou    appeared on the near-by ridges.      The weather was clear on the 15th, with a moderate to brisk    north wind and temperatures of 29° to 48°; ice at edge of the    river. Fred reported about 100 Caribou (none of them bucks)    north of camp, and Anoteelik secured 13 east of Little River.      On the morning of the 16th intermittent snow flurries left a    thin cover on the ground, but it was practically dissipated by    the afternoon sun; wind brisk, northerly; temperature, 30° to    39°. Fred reported three old does without fawns, and no bucks.      September 17 was mostly cloudy, with a little sun; wind light,    northwest and west; temperature, 30° to 43°. A single Caribou    was seen on the south side of Windy River.      Clear skies prevailed on September 18; wind brisk, westerly;    temperature, 35° to 53.5°; ice at edge of the river. A solitary    black fly appeared. No Caribou reported.      September 19 was another clear day; wind moderate to brisk,    west-southwest; temperature, 42° to 60°. Anoteelik, camping on    the Barrens about 2 miles to the north of camp for the past    couple of days, reports having killed 20 Caribou (only one of    them a buck).      Light rain, soon changing to sleet, and then frequent snow    squalls, provided the principal weather elements on September    20; wind light to strong, west to north; temperature, 27° to    43.5°. The ground became partly covered with snow. A big buck,    followed several hours later by a doe and a fawn, swam across to    the north side of Windy River at its mouth. Ten more Caribou    were taken by Anoteelik. Charles considered that the retrograde    movement to the north was definitely under way. There had been    indications of it on various days from September 6 on.      Except for a few snow flurries, it was largely sunny on the    21st; wind brisk to moderate, north to northwest; temperature,    26° to 34°. About a quarter of an inch of snow remained in    sheltered places. A doe and a fawn appeared near camp.      There was considerable snowfall on the 22nd; wind light to    moderate, westerly; temperature, 30° to 33°; ice in edge of the    river. A large buck left tracks in the snow along the Windy    River.      September 23 was partly cloudy; wind brisk, north-northwest;    temperature, 21° to 32°; about a quarter of an inch of snow on    the ground, and a tundra pond mostly frozen over. Several small    groups of Caribou (a doe and a fawn; three does and two fawns;    and three others) appeared on the near-by ridges.      September 24 was mostly cloudy; wind moderate to brisk,    northerly; temperature, 26° to 41°; nearly an inch of fresh snow    on the ground. About 15 does and fawns were resting or feeding    quietly on the east side of Little River, and tracks of about    half a dozen were noted on Camp Ridge. Charles Schweder reported    about 50 Caribou, in three slightly separated bands, appearing    during the evening on the south side of Windy River about 2    miles above its mouth, as if contemplating a crossing. He    thought they may have been alarmed by Wolves.      September 25 was a cloudy day; wind moderate to light, northerly    to westerly; temperature, 31° to 36°; open ground largely bare    by afternoon; ice forming on Windy Bay. Some Caribou tracks were    noted on the north side of Windy River.      There were clouds, a sprinkle or two of rain, and a little    sunshine on the 26th; wind brisk to moderate, southwest to west;    temperature, 36° to 47.5°; ground becoming practically bare.    Three Caribou were seen beyond Little River, and a doe and a    fawn on the south side of Windy River.      The 27th was mostly cloudy, with a thick snow flurry; wind    brisk, northwest; temperature, 33° to 40°. Two tundra ponds,    previously frozen, were mostly open. Three bucks, a doe, and a    fawn were noted on the south side of Windy River.      September 28 was mostly cloudy; wind brisk to light,    north-northwest; temperature, 28.5° to 40°; a little snow on the    ground disappearing. Seven large bucks (six in one band, moving    northward) passed over Camp Ridge, and a dozen other Caribou    (including does) were seen beyond Little River.      The 29th was chiefly sunny; wind very light to brisk, west to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33766"],[0,"History of Phosphorus (#7)"],[1,"of hydrogen between  intermediates formed through phosphate-transferring enzymes.  Fermentation proceeds by a cascade of processes, in which phosphate  groups swing back and forth, and equilibria between ATP with ADP play a  major role.    Many of the enzymes are closely related to vitamins. Thus, cocarboxylase  A, which takes part in the separation of carbon dioxide from an  intermediate fermentation product, is the phosphate of vitamin B_{1}.  Others of the B vitamins contain phosphate groups, for example those of  the B_{2} and B_{6} group, and in B_{12}, one lonely phosphate forms a  bridge in the large molecule that contains one atom of cobalt:  C_{63}H_{90}N_{14}O_{14}PCo. The formation of vitamin A from carotine  occurs under the influence of ATP.    The first stages in fermentation are like those in respiration, which  ends with carbon dioxide and water. These two are the materials for the  reverse process in photosynthesis. When light is absorbed by the  chlorophyll of green plants, one of the initial reactions is a transfer  of hydrogen from water to a triphosphopyridine nucleotide, which later  acts to reduce the carbon dioxide. Under the influence of ATP,  phosphoglyceric acid is synthesized and further built up by way of  carbohydrate phosphates to hexose sugars and finally to starch. In many  starchy fruits, a small proportion of phosphate remains attached to the  end product.    The synthesis of proteins is under the control of deoxyribonucleic acid  or ribonucleic acid, abbreviated by the symbols DNA and RNA. The genes  in the nucleus are parts of a giant DNA molecule. RNA is a universal  constituent of all living cells. Where protein synthesis is intense, the  content in RNA is high. Thus, the spinning glands of silkworms are  extraordinarily rich in RNA.[37]    In his research on the radioactive isotope P^32, George de Hevesy gained  some insight into the surprising mobility of phosphates in organisms: \"A  phosphate radical taken up with the food may first participate in the  phosphorylation of glucose in the intestinal mucose, soon afterwards  pass into the circulation as free phosphate, enter a red corpuscle,  become incorporated with an adenosine triphosphoric-acid molecule,  participate in a glycolytic process going on in the corpuscle, return to  circulation, penetrate into the liver cells, participate in the  formation of a phosphatide molecule, after a short interval enter the  circulation in this form, penetrate into the spleen, and leave this  organ after some time as a constituent of a lymphocyte. We may meet the  phosphate radical again as a constituent of the plasma, from which it  may find its way into the skeleton.\"[38] Much has been added in the last  30 years to complete this picture in many details and to extend it to  other biochemical processes, including even the changes of the pigments  in the retina in the visual process, or in the conversion of chemical  energy to light by bacteria and insects.          Medicines and Poisons      In the delicate balance of these processes, disturbances may occur which  can be remedied by specific phosphate-containing medicines. Thus,  adenosine phosphate has been recommended in cases of angina pectoris  and marketed under trade names like sarkolyt, or in compounds named  angiolysine. A considerable number of physiologically active organic  phosphates can be found in the patent literature.[39] Yeast itself is  considered to be a valuable food additive.    On the other hand, there are phosphate compounds that act as poisons.  One group of such compounds was discovered in 1929 by W. Lange, who  wrote: \"Of interest is the strong action of mono-fluorophosphate esters  on the human body--the effect is produced by very small quantities.\"[40]  Diisopropyl fluorophosphate has since become a potential agent for  chemical warfare. It inactivates an enzyme which controls the  transmission of nerve impulses to muscle, acetylcholine esterase.    Organic esters of phosphoric acids are used as insecticides. The  hexa-ethylester of tetraphosphoric acid, prepared by Gerhard Schrader by  heating triethylphosphate with phosphorus oxychloride,[41] actually  contains tetraethylpyrophosphate (TEPP) among others. Bayer's Dipterex,  the dimethyl ester of 2,2,2-trichloro-1-hydroxyethyl-phosphonate, has  been modified to dimethyl-2,2-dichlorovinyl-phosphate and is especially  active against the oriental fruit fly.[42]    [Illustration: Figure 22.--ARTHUR KORNBERG (b. 1918) AND SEVERO OCHOA  (b. 1905) shared the Nobel Prize in Medicine and Physiology in 1959.  Kornberg received it for research on the biological synthesis of  deoxyribonucleic acid. In particular, he found that four triphosphate  components and a small amount of the end product as a \"template\" had to  be present for the enzymatic synthesis. Ochoa received his share of the  prize for research in ribonucleic acid and deoxyribonucleic acid. In  particular, Ochoa synthesized polyribonucleotides and used the  radioactive isotope, P^{32}. The synthetic polyribonucleotides were  found to resemble the natural substances in all essentials.]            Cl H  O          |  | || OCH_{3}          |  | ||/      Cl--C--C--P             Bayer's L 13/59          |  |   \\              (Dipterex)          |  |    OCH_{3}          Cl OH        (CH_{3})_{2}N O     O  N(CH_{3})_{2}                   \\||    ||/                    P--O--P                  Schradan                   /       \\      (CH_{3})_{2}N         N(CH_{3})_{2}             Octamethylpyrophosphoramide    [Illustration: Figure 23.--MELVIN CALVIN (b. 1911) received the Nobel  Prize in Chemistry in 1961 for his research in photosynthesis, in which  he specified the function of phosphoglyceric acid as an intermediate in  the synthesis of carbohydrates from carbon dioxide and water by green  plants.]    The story of phosphorus, which began 300 years ago, has acquired new  importance in this century. Many scientists have contributed to it: 13  of them have received Nobel Prizes for work directly bearing on the  chemical and biological importance of phosphorus compounds. In  chronological order, they are: Eduard Buchner, Albrecht Kossel, Otto  Meyerhof, Arthur Harden, Hans von Euler-Chelpin, George de Hevesy, Carl  F. Cori, Gerty T. Cori, Fritz Lipmann, Lord Alexander Todd, Arthur  Kornberg, Severo Ochoa, and Melvin Calvin. The developers of industrial  production and commercial utilization of phosphate compounds have had  other rewards.
