Not even the first Indian villages  on Buffalo Creek were to be established for half a century to come.    After Father Crespel's return from Detroit, he remained two years longer  at Fort Niagara, caring for the spiritual life of the little garrison,  and learning the Iroquois and Ottawah languages well enough to converse  with the Indians. \"This enabled me,\" he writes, \"to enjoy their company  when I took a walk in the environs of our post.\" The ability to converse  with the Indians afterwards saved his life. When his three years of  residence at Niagara expired he was relieved, according to the custom of  his order, and he passed a season in the convent at Quebec. While he was  undoubtedly immediately succeeded at Niagara by another chaplain, I have  been unable to learn his name or aught of his ministrations. Indeed,  there are but few glimpses of the post to be had from 1733 to 1759, when  it fell into the hands of the English. One of the most interesting of  these is of the visit of the Sulpitian missionary, the Abbe Piquet, who  in 1751 came to Fort Niagara from his successful mission at La  Presentation--now Ogdensburg. It is recorded of him that while here he  exhorted the Senecas to beware of the white man's brandy; his name may  perhaps stand as that of the first avowed temperance worker in the  Niagara region.    But the end of the French _regime_ was at hand. For more than a century  our home region had been claimed by France; for the last thirty-three  years the lily-strewn standard of Louis had flaunted defiance to the  English from the banks of the Niagara. Now on a scorching July day the  little fort found itself surrounded, with Sir Wm. Johnson's cannon  roaring from the wilderness. There was a gallant defense, a baptism of  fire and blood, an honorable capitulation. But in that fierce conflict  at least one of the consecrated soldiers of the cross--Father Claude  Virot--fell before British bullets; and when the triple cross of Britain  floated over Fort Niagara, the last altar raised by the French on the  east bank of the Niagara river had been overthrown.           *       *       *       *       *    On this eventful day in 1759, when seemingly the opportunities for the  Catholic Church to continue its work on the Niagara were at an end,  there was, in the poor parish of Maryborough, county Kildare, Ireland, a  little lad of six whose mission it was to be to bring hither again the  blessed offices of his faith. This was Edmund Burke, afterwards Bishop  of Zion, and first Vicar-Apostolic of Nova Scotia, but whose name shines  not less in the annals of his church because of his zeal as missionary  in Upper Canada. Having come to Quebec in 1786, he was, in 1794,  commissioned Vicar-General for the whole of Upper Canada--the province  having then been established two years. In that year we find him at  Niagara, where he was the first English-speaking priest to hold Catholic  service. True, there was at the post that year a French missionary named  Le Dru, who could speak English; but he had been ordered out of the  province for cause. The field was ripe for a man of Father Burke's  character and energy. His early mission was near Detroit; he was the  first English-speaking priest in Ohio, and it is worthy of note that he  was at Niagara on his way east, July 22, 1796--only three weeks before  the British finally evacuated Fort Niagara and the Americans took  possession. Through his efforts in that year, the Church procured a  large lot at Niagara, Ont., where he proposed a missionary  establishment. There had probably never been a time, since the English  conquest, when there had not been Catholics among the troops quartered  on the Niagara; but under a British and Protestant commandant no  suitable provision for their worship had been made. In 1798--two years  after the British had relinquished the fort on the east side of the  river to the Americans--Father Burke, being at the British garrison on  the Canadian side, wrote to Monseigneur Plessis:         Here I am at Niagara, instead of having carried out my original       design of going on to Detroit, thence returning to Kingston to pass       the winter. The commander of the garrison, annoyed by the continual       complaints of the civic officials against the Catholic soldiers,       who used to frequent the taverns during the hours of service on       Sunday, gave orders that officers and men should attend the       Protestant service. They had attended for three consecutive Sundays       when I represented to the commander the iniquity of this order. He       replied that he would send them to mass if the chaplain was there,       and he thought it very extraordinary that whilst a chaplain was       paid by the king for the battalion, instead of attending to his       duty he should be in charge of a mission, his men were without       religious services, and his sick were dying without the sacraments.       You see, therefore, that I have reason for stopping short at       Niagara; for we must not permit four companies, of whom three       fourths both of officers and men are Catholics, to frequent the       Protestant church.    The name of the priest against whom the charge of neglect appears to  lie, was Duval; but it is not clear that he had ever attended the troops  to the Niagara station. But after Father Burke came Father Desjardines  and an unbroken succession, with the district fully organized in  ecclesiastical jurisdiction.           *       *       *       *       *    And now, although our story of mission work in the Niagara region has  been long--has reviewed the visitations of two centuries--the reader may  have remarked the striking fact that every priest who came into our  territory, up to the opening of the nineteenth century, came from  Canada. This fact is the more remarkable when we recall the  long-continued and vigorous missions of the Jesuits in what is now New  York State, extending west nearly to the Genesee River. But the fact  stands that no priest from those early establishments made his way  westward to the present site of Buffalo. Fathers Lamberville and Milet  had been stationed among the Onondagas and Oneidas before coming into  our region at Fort Niagara; but they came thither from Canada, by way of  Lake Ontario, and not through the wilderness of Western New York. The  westernmost mission among the Iroquois was that of Fathers Carheil and  Garnier at Cayuga, where they were at work ten years before La Salle  built the Griffon on the Niagara. It is interesting to note that this  mission, which was established nearest to our own region, was \"dedicated  to God under the invocation of St. Joseph,\" and that, two hundred years  after, the first Bishop of Buffalo obtained from his Holiness, Pope Pius  IX., permission that St. Joseph should be the principal patron saint of  this diocese.    The earliest episcopal jurisdiction of the territory now embraced in the  city of Buffalo, dating from the first visit of Dallion to the land of  the Neuters, was directly vested in the diocese of Rouen--for it was the  rule that regions new-visited belonged to the government of the bishop  from a port in whose diocese the expedition bearing the missionary had  sailed; and this stood until a local ecclesiastical government was  formed; the first ecclesiastical association of our region, on the New  York side, therefore, is with that grand old city, Rouen, the home of La  Salle, scene of the martyrdom of the Maid of Orleans, and the center,  through many centuries, of mighty impulses affecting the New World. From  1657 to 1670 our region was embraced in the jurisdiction of the Vicar  Apostolic of New France; and from 1670 to the Conquest in the diocese of  Quebec. There are involved here, of course, all the questions which grew  out of the strife for possession of the Niagara region by the French,  English and Dutch. Into these questions we may not enter now further  than to note that from 1684 the English claimed jurisdiction of all the  region on the east bank of the Niagara and the present site of Buffalo.  This claim was in part based on the Treaty of Albany at which the  Senecas had signified their allegiance to King Charles; and by that  acquiescence nominally put the east side of the Niagara under British  rule. The next year, when the Duke of York came to the throne, he  decreed that the Archbishop of Canterbury should hold ecclesiastical  jurisdiction over the whole Colony of New York. It is very doubtful,  however, if the Archbishop of Canterbury had ever heard of the  Niagara--the first English translation of Hennepin did not appear for  fourteen years after this date; and nothing is more unlikely than that  the Senecas who visited the Niagara at this period, or even the Dutch  and English traders who gave them rum for beaver-skins, had ever heard  of the Archbishop of Canterbury, or cared a copper for his  ecclesiastical jurisdiction, either on the Niagara or even in the  settlements on the Hudson. In the New York Colony, and afterward State,  the legal discrimination against Catholics continued down to 1784, when  the law which condemned Catholic priests to imprisonment or even death  was repealed. At the date of its repeal there was not a Catholic  congregation in the State. Those Catholics who were among the pioneer  settlers of Western New York had to go as far east as Albany to perform  their religious duties or get their children baptized. Four years  later--in 1788--our region was included in the newly-formed diocese of  Baltimore. In 1808 we came into the new diocese of New York. Not until  1821 do we find record of the visit of a priest to Buffalo. In 1829 the  Church acquired its first "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37009"],[0,"Butterflies Worth Knowing (#7)"],[1,"color tactics of  the Catocala moths. The under wings of the common Carolina locust--the  species most abundant along the highway--are black, bordered with  yellowish white. The base of the hind wings of a related species  living on the Western plains is bluish, while in the large  coral-winged locust of the Eastern states the hind wings are red,  bordered with black. In nearly all of the species of these locusts  frequenting open localities where they are liable to disturbance by  birds or other animals, the hind wings exhibit contrasting colors in  flight. Most of them also fly in a zigzag line, and alight in a most  erratic manner. Many times I have had difficulty in determining the  exact landfall of one of these peculiar creatures, and I believe Lord  Walsingham's suggestion is well exemplified in them. (_See page 33._)    The most famous example of a combination of this dazzling coloring of  the upper wing surface with a definite protective coloring of the  under wing surface is the Kallima butterfly which is illustrated in  almost every book dealing with animal coloration. The under wing  surface bears a striking resemblance to a leaf and the hind wings  project to form a tail which looks like the petiole of the leaf, and  there is also a mark running across the wings which mimics the midrib.  When the butterfly is flying the brilliant colors of the upper surface  are visible, but when it alights these are instantly replaced by the  sombre tone of the under surface, so that apparently the insect  completely disappears and in its place there is only a leaf attached  to a branch in a most natural position. In Dr. Longstaff's book there  is an illustration of another tropical butterfly, _Eronia cleodora_,  which resembles on its under surface a yellow disease-stricken leaf  but on its upper surface gives a brilliant combination of black and  white. This insect alights upon the leaves which it resembles and is  a striking example of both dazzling and mimicking coloration.    Many of our own butterflies, notably the Angle-wings, are excellent  examples of a similar combination. In flight they reveal conspicuous  colors which are instantly hidden upon alighting and then one only  sees the bark-like or dead leaf-like under surface as may be seen in  the plate opposite pages 160-161. The iridescence upon the upper wing  surface of many butterflies, whose under wing surface is colored in  concealing tones, is doubtless also of great use to the insect in a  similar way. There is a splendid opportunity here for some observer to  study this phase of butterfly activity and to get photographs of the  insects amid their natural surroundings.    In their book upon \"Concealing Coloration\" the Messrs. Thayer have  called attention to many interesting phases of dazzling coloration.  They show that bright marks like the eye-spots or ocelli, which form  so prominent a feature on the wing surfaces of many butterflies,  really helped to conceal the insect amid its natural surroundings, by  drawing the eye away from the outlines of wings and body so that the  latter tend to disappear. Their discussion of this subject opens up  another vast field for outdoor observations of absorbing interest, in  which there is great need for many active workers.

Obviously, were this not true the protective  coloring would avail but little and it is evident that these moths are  able to select a background which is of advantage in helping to  conceal them.    There is much evidence to show that in a similar way the butterflies  are able by means of a well-developed color sense to select the places  where they alight. One of the most notable examples is that of a South  American species, _Peridromia feronia_. This is a silvery gray  butterfly which alights head downward upon the bark of certain palm  trees that have silvery gray stems and remains there with its wings  fully expanded so that it utilizes the background in much the same way  that the Underwing moths do. \"When disturbed they will return to the  same tree again and again.\"    One who will observe the habits of our Angle-wings and other  butterflies which have obliterative coloring of the under wing surface  can easily learn that these insects select rather carefully the places  where they alight. It will be found that as a rule each species  utilizes a background that blends with its own coloring. It is  probable that this habit is much more common in other groups of  butterflies than has been realized. Much evidence of this sort has  been collected regarding the butterflies of Europe and other  countries, as well as near our own borders in America.          WARNING COLORATION AND MIMICRY      The colors of a great many animals, including a considerable  percentage of American butterflies and their larvae, have been  commonly explained by the theory of _warning colors_. According to  this theory animals which were for any reason not edible by birds and  mammals have developed various striking combinations of color such as  black and yellow, red and black, or black and white, in order to  advertise to their foes their inedible qualities. This theory has been  very generally accepted by naturalists and will be found expounded at  length in many books published during the last quarter century.    The whole subject of the validity of warning coloration has recently  been brought up for reconsideration by the illuminating investigations  of Mr. Abbott H. Thayer and discussed at length in the book upon  \"Concealing Coloration\" already mentioned. In an appendix to this book  dated 1908 Mr. Thayer states that he no longer holds the belief that  \"there must somewhere be warning colors.\" He has convincingly shown  that a large proportion of the animals which were supposed to be  examples of this theory are really illustrations of concealing  coloration. But there yet remain various facts which have been  conclusively proven that apparently require the theory of warning  colors to explain them. Here is another field in which there is a real  need for much careful investigation under conditions that are rigidly  scientific.    Along with the theory of warning coloration the theory of _mimicry_  has been propounded. According to this if a butterfly in a given  region shows warning coloration, having developed such coloration  because it is distasteful to birds and mammals, it may be mimicked by  another butterfly in the same region belonging to another group, the  latter butterfly being edible, but benefiting by its resemblance to  the distasteful species, because birds or mammals mistake it for the  latter and do not attempt to catch it. The most notable example of  such mimicry in North America is that of the Monarch butterfly, which  is supposed to be the distasteful species, and the Viceroy butterfly,  which is supposed to mimic it. Several other instances of mimicry are  found among our own butterflies, while in South America, Africa, and  Asia there are numberless examples.          HELIOTROPISM      It has long been known that the green surfaces of plants respond to  the stimulus of the sun's rays in a most remarkable manner. This  response has commonly been called _heliotropism_ and it has been  carefully studied by botanists all over the habitable world. More  recently, the fact has been observed that many animals respond in  certain definite ways to the stimulus of direct sunshine and the same  term has been applied in this case. Very little attention has been  given to the subject of heliotropism until within a few recent years.  But the observations which have been made by Parker, Longstaff, Dixey,  and others open up a most interesting field for further observation.  An admirable summary of our present knowledge of the subject has been  published by Dr. Longstaff in his book \"Butterfly Hunting in Many  Lands.\"    One of the earliest observations upon this subject was that published  in my book \"Nature Biographies\" which appeared in June, 1901,  concerning the habit in the Mourning Cloak: \"On a spring-like day  early in November (the 8th) I came across one of these butterflies  basking in the sunshine upon the ties of a railway track. It rested  with its wings wide open. On being disturbed, it would fly a short  distance and then alight, and I was interested to notice that after  alighting it would always turn about until the hind end of its body  pointed in the direction of the sun, so that the sun's rays struck its  wings and body nearly at right angles. I repeatedly observed this  habit of getting into the position in which the most benefit from the  sunshine was received, and it is "]]]
