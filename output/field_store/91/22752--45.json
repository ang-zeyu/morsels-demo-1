No man could have imagined that the revolting method of  seduction employed could meet with success, and if the commander had  desired to convict her of perfidy he would have come alone and made use  of more persuasive weapons. No, he believed he still had claims on her,  but even if he had, by his manner of enforcing them he had rendered them  void. However, the moment he threatened to seek out a rival whose  identity he designated quite clearly, and reveal to him the secret it  was so necessary to her interests to keep hidden, the poor girl lost her  head. She looked at de Jars with a frightened expression, and said in a  trembling voice--    \"I don't know whom you mean.\"    \"You don't know? Well, I shall commission the king's treasurer, Jeannin  de Castille, to come here to-morrow and tell you, an hour before our  duel.\"    \"Oh no! no! Promise me you will not do that!\" cried she, clasping her  hands.    \"Adieu, madame.\"    \"Do not leave me thus! I cannot let you go till you give me your  promise!\"    She threw herself on her knees and clung with both her hands to de Jars'  cloak, and appealing to Chevalier de Moranges, said--    \"You are young, monsieur; I have never done you any harm; protect me,  have pity on me, help me to soften him!\"    \"Uncle,\" said the chevalier in a pleading tone, \"be generous, and don't  drive this woman to despair.\"    \"Prayers are useless!\" answered the commander.    \"What do you want me to do?\" said Angelique. \"Shall I go into a convent  to atone? I am ready to go. Shall I promise never to see him again? For  God's sake, give me a little time; put off your vengeance for one single  day! To-morrow evening, I swear to you, you will have nothing more to  fear from me. I thought myself forgotten by you and abandoned; and how  should I think otherwise? You left me without a word of farewell, you  stayed away and never sent me a line! And how do you know that I did not  weep when you deserted me, leaving me to pass my days in monotonous  solitude? How do you know that I did not make every effort to find out  why you were so long absent from my side? You say you had left town but  how was I to know that? Oh! promise me, if you love me, to give up this  duel! Promise me not to seek that man out to-morrow!\"    The poor creature hoped to work wonders with her eloquence, her tears,  her pleading glances. On hearing her prayer for a reprieve of  twenty-four hours, swearing that after that she would never see Jeannin  again, the commander and the chevalier were obliged to bite their lips  to keep from laughing outright. But the former soon regained his  self-possession, and while Angelique, still on her knees before him,  pressed his hands to her bosom, he forced her to raise her head, and  looking straight into her eyes, said--    \"To-morrow, madame, if not this evening, he shall know everything, and a  meeting shall take place.\"    Then pushing her away, he strode towards the door.    \"Oh! how unhappy I am!\" exclaimed Angelique.    She tried to rise and rush after him, but whether she was really  overcome by her feelings, or whether she felt the one chance of  prevailing left her was to faint, she uttered a heartrending cry, and  the chevalier had no choice but to support her sinking form.    De Jars, on seeing his nephew staggering under this burden, gave a loud  laugh, and hurried away. Two minutes later he was once more at the  tavern in the rue Saint-Andre-des-Arts.    \"How's this? Alone?\" said Jeannin.    \"Alone.\"    \"What have you done with the chevalier?\"    \"I left him with our charmer, who was unconscious, overcome with grief,  exhausted Ha! ha! ha! She fell fainting into his arms! Ha! ha! ha!\"    \"It's quite possible that the young rogue, being left with her in such a  condition, may cut me out.\"    \"Do you think so?--Ha! ha! ha!\"    And de Jars laughed so heartily and so infectiously that his worthy  friend was obliged to join in, and laughed till he choked.    In the short silence which followed the departure of the commander,  Maitre Quennebert could hear the widow still murmuring something, but he  was less disposed than ever to attend to her.    \"On my word,\" said he, \"the scene now going on is more curious than all  that went before. I don't think that a man has ever found himself in  such a position as mine. Although my interests demand that I remain here  and listen, yet my fingers are itching to box the ears of that Chevalier  de Moranges. If there were only some way of getting at a proof of all  this! Ah! now we shall hear something; the hussy is coming to herself.\"    And indeed Angelique had opened her eyes and was casting wild looks  around her; she put her hand to her brow several times, as if trying to  recall clearly what had happened.    \"Is he gone?\" she exclaimed at last. \"Oh, why did you let him go? You  should not have minded me, but kept him here.\"    \"Be calm,\" answered the chevalier, \"be calm, for heaven's sake. I shall  speak to my uncle and prevent his ruining your prospects. Only don't  weep any more, your tears break my heart. Ah, my God! how cruel it is to  distress you so! I should never be able to withstand your tears; no  matter what reason I had for anger, a look from you would make me  forgive you everything.\"    \"Noble young man!\" said Angelique.    \"Idiot!\" muttered Maitre Quennebert; \"swallow the honey of his words, do  But how the deuce is it going to end? Not Satan himself ever invented  such a situation.\"    \"But then I could never believe you guilty without proof, irrefutable  proof; and even then a word from you would fill my mind with doubt and  uncertainty again. Yes, were the whole world to accuse you and swear to  your guilt, I should still believe your simple word. I am young, madam,  I have never known love as yet--until an instant ago I had no idea that  more quickly than an image can excite the admiration of the eye, a  thought can enter the heart and stir it to its depths, and features that  one may never again behold leave a lifelong memory behind. But even if a  woman of whom I knew absolutely nothing were to appeal to me,  exclaiming, 'I implore your help, your protection!' I should, without  stopping to consider, place my sword and my arm at her disposal, and  devote myself to her service. How much more eagerly would I die for you,  madam, whose beauty has ravished my heart! What do you demand of me?  Tell me what you desire me to do.\"    \"Prevent this duel; don't allow an interview to take place between your  uncle and the man whom he mentioned. Tell me you will do this, and I  shall be safe; for you have never learned to lie; I know.\"    \"Of course he hasn't, you may be sure of that, you simpleton!\" muttered  Maitre Quennebert in his corner. \"If you only knew what a mere novice  you are at that game compared with the chevalier! If you only knew whom  you had before you!\"    \"At your age,\" went on Angelique, \"one cannot feign--the heart is not  yet hardened, and is capable of compassion. But a dreadful idea occurs  to me--a horrible suspicion! Is it all a devilish trick--a snare  arranged in joke? Tell me that it is not all a pretence! A poor woman  encounters so much perfidy. Men amuse themselves by troubling her heart  and confusing her mind; they excite her vanity, they compass her round  with homage, with flattery, with temptation, and when they grow tired of  fooling her, they despise and insult her. Tell me, was this all a  preconcerted plan? This love, this jealousy, were they only acted?\"    \"Oh, madame,\" broke in the chevalier, with an expression of the deepest  indignation, \"how can you for an instant imagine that a human heart  could be so perverted? I am not acquainted with the man whom the  commander accused you of loving, but whoever he may be I feel sure that  he is worthy of your love, and that he would never have consented to  such a dastardly joke. Neither would my uncle; his jealousy mastered him  and drove him mad--    \"But I am not dependent on him; I am my own master, and can do as I  please. I will hinder this duel; I will not allow the illusion and  ignorance of him who loves you and, alas that I must say it, whom you  love, to be dispelled, for it is in them he finds his happiness. Be  happy with him! As for me, I shall never see you again; but the  recollection of this meeting, the joy of having served you, will be my  consolation.\"    Angelique raised her beautiful eyes, and gave the chevalier a long look  which expressed her gratitude more eloquently than words.    \"May I be hanged!\" thought Maitre Quennebert, \"if the baggage isn't  making eyes at him already! But one who is drowning clutches at a  straw.\"    \"Enough, madam,\" said the chevalier; \"I understand all you would say.  You thank me in his name, and ask me to leave you: I obey-yes, madame, I  am going; at the risk of my life I will prevent this meeting, I will  stifle this fatal revelation. But grant me one last prayer-permit me to  look forward to seeing you once more before I leave this city, to which  I wish I had never come. But I shall quit it in a day or two, to-morrow  perhaps--as soon as I know that your happiness is assured. Oh! do not  refuse my last request; let the light of your eyes shine on me for the  last time; after that I shall depart--I shall fly far away for ever. But  if perchance, in spite of every effort, I fail, if the commander's  jealousy should make him impervious to my entreaties--to my tears, if he  whom you love should come and overwhelm you with reproaches and then  abandon you, would you drive me from your presence if I should then say,  'I love you'? Answer me, I beseech you.\"    \"Go!\" said she, \"and prove worthy of my gratitude--or my love.\"    Seizing one of her hands, the chevalier covered"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2750"],[0,"Joan of Naples (#7)"],[1,"n, Joan,\" said Charles, taking his cousin's hand and laying it  upon his heart: \"can you feel that dagger?\"    \"I can,\" said Joan, and she turned pale.    \"One word from you--and--\"    \"Yes?\"    \"To-morrow you will be free.\"    \"A murder!\" cried Joan, recoiling in horror: \"then I was not deceived;  it is a murder that you have proposed.\"    \"It is a necessity,\" said the duke calmly: \"today I advise; later on you  will give your orders.\"    \"Enough, wretch! I cannot tell if you are more cowardly or more rash:  cowardly, because you reveal a criminal plot feeling sure that I shall  never denounce you; rash, because in revealing it to me you cannot tell  what witnesses are near to hear it all.\"    \"In any case, madam, since I have put myself in your hands, you must  perceive that I cannot leave you till I know if I must look upon myself  as your friend or as your enemy.\"    \"Leave me,\" cried Joan, with a disdainful gesture; \"you insult your  queen.\"    \"You forget, my dear cousin, that some day I may very likely have a  claim to your kingdom.\"    \"Do not force me to have you turned out of this room,\" said Joan,  advancing towards the door.    \"Now do not get excited, my fair cousin; I am going: but at least  remember that I offered you my hand and you refused it. Remember what I  say at this solemn moment: to-day I am the guilty man; some day perhaps  I may be the judge.\"    He went away slowly, twice turning his head, repeating in the language  of signs his menacing prophecy. Joan hid her face in her hands, and for  a long time remained plunged in dismal reflections; then anger got the  better of all her other feelings, and she summoned Dona Cancha, bidding  her not to allow anybody to enter, on any pretext whatsoever.    This prohibition was not for the Count of Artois, for the reader will  remember that he was in the adjoining room.          CHAPTER III      Night fell, and from the Molo to the Mergellina, from the Capuano Castle  to the hill of St. Elmo, deep silence had succeeded the myriad sounds  that go up from the noisiest city in the world. Charles of Durazzo,  quickly walking away from the square of the Correggi, first casting one  last look of vengeance at the Castel Nuovo, plunged into the labyrinth  of dark streets that twist and turn, cross and recross one another, in  this ancient city, and after a quarter of an hour's walking, that was  first slow, then very rapid, arrived at his ducal palace near the church  of San Giovanni al Mare. He gave certain instructions in a harsh,  peremptory tone to a page who took his sword and cloak. Then Charles  shut himself into his room, without going up to see his poor mother, who  was weeping, sad and solitary over her son's ingratitude, and like every  other mother taking her revenge by praying God to bless him.    The Duke of Durazzo walked up and down his room several times like a  lion in a cage, counting the minutes in a fever of impatience, and was  on the point of summoning a servant and renewing his commands, when two  dull raps on the door informed him that the person he was waiting for  had arrived. He opened at once, and a man of about fifty, dressed in  black from head to foot, entered, humbly bowing, and carefully shut the  door behind him. Charles threw himself into an easy-chair, and gazing  fixedly at the man who stood before him, his eyes on the ground and his  arms crossed upon his breast in an attitude of the deepest respect and  blind obedience, he said slowly, as though weighing each word--    \"Master Nicholas of Melazzo, have you any remembrance left of the  services I once rendered you?\"    The man to whom these words were addressed trembled in every limb, as if  he heard the voice of Satan come to claim his soul; then lifting a look  of terror to his questioner's face, he asked in a voice of gloom--    \"What have I done, my lord, to deserve this reproach?\"    \"It is not a reproach: I ask a simple question.\"    \"Can my lord doubt for a moment of my eternal gratitude? Can I forget  the favours your Excellency showed me? Even if I could so lose my reason  and my memory, are not my wife and son ever here to remind me that to  you we owe all our life, our honour, and our fortune? I was guilty of an  infamous act,\" said the notary, lowering his voice, \"a crime that would  not only have brought upon my head the penalty of death, but which meant  the confiscation of my goods, the ruin of my family, poverty and shame  for my only son--that very son, sire, for whom I, miserable wretch, had  wished to ensure a brilliant future by means of my frightful crime: you  had in your hands the proofs of this!    \"I have them still.\"    \"And you will not ruin me, my lord,\" resumed the notary, trembling; \"I  am at your feet, your Excellency; take my life and I will die in torment  without a murmur, but save my son since you have been so merciful as to  spare him till now; have pity on his mother; my lord, have pity!\"    \"Be assured,\" said Charles, signing to him to rise; \"it is nothing to do  with your life; that will come later, perhaps. What I wish to ask of you  now is a much simpler, easier matter.\"    \"My lord, I await your command.\"    \"First,\" said the duke, in a voice of playful irony, \"you must draw up a  formal contract of my marriage.\"    \"At once, your Excellency.\"    \"You are to write in the first article that my wife brings me as dowry  the county of Alba, the jurisdiction of Grati and Giordano, with all  castles, fiefs, and lands dependent thereto.\"    \"But, my lord--\" replied the poor notary, greatly embarrassed.    \"Do you find any difficulty, Master Nicholas?\"    \"God forbid, your Excellency, but--\"    \"Well, what is it?\"    \"Because, if my lord will permit, because there is only one person in  Naples who possesses that dowry your Excellency mentions.\"    \"And so?\"    \"And she,\" stammered the notary, embarrassed more and more, \"--she is  the queen's sister.\"    \"And in the contract you will write the name of Marie of Anjou.\"    \"But the young maiden,\" replied Nicholas timidly, \"whom your Excellency  would marry is destined, I thought, under the will of our late king of  blessed memory, to become the wife of the King of Hungary or else of the  grandson of the King of France.\"    \"Ah, I understand your surprise: you may learn from this that an uncle's  intentions are not always the same as his nephew's.\"    \"In that case, sire, if I dared--if my lord would deign to give me  leave--if I had an opinion I might give, I would humbly entreat your  Excellency to reflect that this would mean the abduction of a minor.\"    \"Since when did you learn to be scrupulous, Master Nicholas?\"    These words were uttered with a glance so terrible that the poor notary  was crushed, and had hardly the strength to reply--    \"In an hour the contract will be ready.\"    \"Good: we agree as to the first point,\" continued Charles, resuming his  natural tone of voice. \"You now will hear my second charge. You have  known the Duke of Calabria's valet for the last two years pretty  intimately?\"    \"Tommaso Pace; why, he is my best friend.\"    \"Excellent. Listen, and remember that on your discretion the safety or  ruin of your family depends. A plot will soon be on foot against the  queen's husband; the conspirators no doubt will gain over Andre's valet,  the man you call your best friend; never leave him for an instant, try  to be his shadow; day by day and hour by hour come to me and report the  progress of the plot, the names of the plotters.\"    \"Is this all your Excellency's command?\"    \"All.\"    The notary respectfully bowed, and withdrew to put the orders at once  into execution. Charles spent the rest of that night writing to his  uncle the Cardinal de Perigord, one of the most influential prelates at  the court of Avignon. He begged him before all things to use his  authority so as to prevent Pope Clement from signing the bull that would  sanction Andre's coronation, and he ended his letter by earnestly  entreating his uncle to win the pope's consent to his marriage with the  queen's sister.    \"We shall see, fair cousin,\" he said as he sealed his letter, \"which of  us is best at understanding where our interest lies. You would not have  me as a friend, so you shall have me as an enemy. Sleep on in the arms  of your lover: I will wake you when the time comes. I shall be Duke of  Calabria perhaps some day, and that title, as you well know, belongs to  the heir to the throne.\"    The next day and on the following days a remarkable change took place in  the behaviour of Charles towards Andre: he showed him signs of great  friendliness, cleverly flattering his inclinations, and even persuading  Friar Robert that, far from feeling any hostility in the matter of  Andre's coronation, his most earnest desire was that his uncle's wishes  should be respected; and that, though he might have given the impression  of acting contrary to them, it had only been done with a view to  appeasing the populace, who in their first excitement might have been  stirred up to insurrection against the Hungarians. He declared with much  warmth that he heartily detested the people about the queen, whose  counsels tended to lead her astray, and he promised to join Friar Robert  in the endeavour to get rid of Joan's favourites by all such means as  fortune might put at his disposal. Although the Dominican did not  believe in the least in the sincerity of his ally's protestations, he  yet gladly welcomed the aid which might prove so useful to the prince's  cause, and attributed the sudden change of front to some recent rupture  between Charles and his cousin, promising himself that he would make  capital out of his resentment. Be that as it might, Charles wormed  himself into Andre's heart, and after a few days one of them could  hardly be seen without the other. If Andre went out hunting, his  greatest pleasure in life, Charles was eager to put his pack or his  falcons at his disposal; if Andre "]]]
