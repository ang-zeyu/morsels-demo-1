Its  head is a trifle longer than it is wide and is slightly dilated at the  base; it is pale-red near the mouth and darker about the ocelli.    The labrum forms a segment of a circle; it is reddish, edged with a  small number of very short, stiff hairs. The mandibles are powerful,  red-brown, curved and sharp; when at rest they meet without crossing.  The maxillary palpi are rather long, consisting of two cylindrical  sections of equal length, the outer ending in a very short bristle.  The jaws and the lower lip are not sufficiently visible to lend  themselves to accurate description.    The antennae consist of two cylindrical segments, equal in length, not  very definitely divided; these segments are nearly as long as those of  the palpi; the outer is surmounted by a cirrus whose length is as much  as thrice that of the head and tapers off until it becomes invisible  under a powerful pocket-lens. Behind the base of either antennae are  two ocelli, unequal in size and almost touching.    The thoracic segments are of equal length and increase gradually in  width from front to back. The prothorax is wider than the head, but is  narrower in front than at the base and is slightly rounded at the  sides. The legs are of medium length and fairly robust, ending in a  long, powerful, sharp and very mobile claw. On the haunch and thigh of  each leg is a long cirrus, like that of the antennae, almost as long  as the whole limb and standing at right angles to the plane of  locomotion when the creature moves. There are a few stiff bristles on  the legs.    The abdomen has nine segments, of practically equal length, but  shorter than those of the thorax and diminishing very rapidly in width  toward the last. Fixed below the eighth segment, or rather below the  strip of membrane separating this segment and the last, we see two  spikes, slightly curved, short, but with strong, sharp, hard points,  and placed one to the right and the other to the left of the median  line. These two appendages are able, by means of a mechanism  recalling, on a smaller scale, that of the Snail's horns, to withdraw  into themselves, as a result of the membranous character of their  base. They can also retreat under the eighth segment, borne, as they  are, by the anal segment, when this last, as it contracts, withdraws  into the eighth. Lastly, the ninth or anal segment bears on its hinder  edge two long cirri, like those of the legs and the antennae, curving  backwards from tip to base. At the rear of this segment a fleshy  nipple appears, more or less prominent; this is the anus. I do not  know where the stigmata are placed; they have evaded my  investigations, though these were undertaken with the aid of the  microscope.    When the larva is at rest, the various segments overlap evenly; and  the membranous intervals, corresponding with the articulations, do not  show. But, when the larva walks, all the articulations, especially  those of the abdominal segments, are distended and end by occupying  almost as much space as the horny arches. At the same time the anal  segment emerges from the sheath formed by the eighth; the anus, in  turn, is stretched into a nipple; and the two points of the  penultimate ring rise, at first slowly, and then suddenly stand up  with an abrupt motion similar to that of a spring when released. In  the end, these two points diverge like the horns of a crescent. Once  this complex apparatus is unfolded, the tiny creature is ready to  crawl upon the most slippery surface.    The last segment and its anal button are curved at right angles to the  axis of the body; and the anus comes and presses upon the surface of  locomotion, where it ejects a tiny drop of transparent, treacly fluid,  which glues and holds the little creature firmly in position,  supported on a sort of tripod formed by the anal button and the two  cirri of the last segment. If we are observing the animal's manner of  locomotion on a strip of glass, we can hold the strip in a vertical  position, or even turn it upside down, or shake it lightly, without  causing the larva to become detached and fall, held fast as it is by  the glutinous secretion of the anal button.    If it has to proceed along a surface where there is no danger of a  fall, the microscopic creature employs another method. It crooks its  belly and, when the two spikes of the eighth segment, now fully  outspread, have found a firm support by ploughing, so to speak, the  surface of locomotion, it bears upon that base and pushes forward by  expanding the various abdominal articulations. This forward movement  is also assisted by the action of the legs, which are far from  remaining inactive. This done, it casts anchor with the powerful claws  of its feet; the abdomen contracts; the various segments draw  together; and the anus, pulled forward, obtains a fresh purchase, with  the aid of the two spikes, before beginning the second of these  curious strides.    During these manoeuvres, the cirri of the flanks and thighs drag along  the supporting surface and by their length and elasticity appear  fitted only to impede progress. But let us not be in a hurry to  conclude that we have discovered an inconsistency: the least of  creatures is adapted to the conditions amid which it has to live;  there is reason to believe that these filaments, far from hampering  the pigmy's progress, must, in normal circumstances, be of some  assistance to it.    Even the little that we have just learnt shows us that the young  Sitaris-larva is not called upon to move on an ordinary surface. The  spot, whatever it may be like, where this larva is to live later  exposes it to the risk of many dangerous falls, since, in order to  prevent them, it is not only equipped with strong and extremely mobile  talons and a steel-shod crescent, a sort of ploughshare capable of  biting into the most highly polished substance, but is further  provided with a viscous liquid, sufficiently tenacious and adhesive to  hold it in position without the help of other appliances. In vain I  racked my brains to guess what the substance might be, so shifting, so  uncertain and so perilous, which the young Sitares are destined to  inhabit; and I discovered nothing to explain the necessity for the  structure which I have described. Convinced beforehand, by an  attentive examination of this structure, that I should witness some  peculiar habits, I waited with eager impatience for the return of the  warm weather, never doubting that by dint of persevering observation  the mystery would be disclosed to me next spring. At last this spring,  so fervently desired, arrived; I brought to bear all the patience, all  the imagination, all the insight and discernment that I may possess;  but, to my utter shame and still greater regret, the secret escaped  me. Oh, how painful are those tortures of indecision, when one has to  postpone till the following year an investigation which has led to no  result!    My observations made during the spring of 1856, although purely  negative, nevertheless have an interest of their own, because they  prove the inaccuracy of certain suppositions to which the undeniable  parasitism of the Sitares naturally inclines us. I will therefore  relate them in a few words. At the end of April, the young larvae,  hitherto motionless and concealed in the spongy heap of the egg-skins,  emerge from their immobility, scatter and run about in all directions  through the boxes and jars in which they have passed the winter. By  their hurried gait and their indefatigable evolutions we readily guess  that they are seeking something which they lack. What can this  something be, unless it be food? For remember that these larvae were  hatched at the end of September and that since then, that is to say,  for seven long months, they have taken no nourishment, though they  have spent this period in the full enjoyment of their vitality, as I  was able to assure myself all through the winter by irritating them,  and not in a state of torpor similar to that of the hibernating  animals. From the moment of their hatching they are doomed, although  full of life, to an absolute abstinence of seven months' duration; and  it is natural to suppose, when we see their present excitement, that  an imperious hunger sets them bustling in this fashion.    The desired nourishment could only be the contents of the cells of the  Anthophora, since we afterwards find the Sitares in these cells. Now  these contents are limited to honey or larvae. It just happens that I  have kept some Anthophora-cells occupied by larvae or nymphs. I place  a few of these, some open, some closed, within reach of the young  Sitares, as I had already done directly after the hatching. I even  slip the Sitares into the cells: I place them on the sides of the  larva, a succulent morsel to all appearances; I do all sorts of things  to tempt their appetite; and, after exhausting my ingenuity, which  continues fruitless, I remain convinced that my famished grubs are  seeking neither the larvae nor nymphs of the Anthophora.    Let us now try honey. We must obviously employ honey prepared by the  same species of Anthophora as that at whose cost the Sitares live. But  this Bee is not very common in the neighbourhood of Avignon; and my  engagements at the college[1] do not allow me to absent myself for the  purpose of repairing to Carpentras, where she is so abundant. In  hunting for cells provisioned with honey I thus lose a good part of  the month of May; however, I end by finding some which are newly  sealed and which belong to the right Anthophora. I open these cells  with the feverish impatience of a sorely-tried longing. All goes well:  they are half-full of fluid, dark, nauseating honey, with the Bee's  lately-hatched larva floating on the surface.

Some folks don't; my other master didn't. If we  missed a word, didn't we get raps on the head!\" and Tommy rubbed his own  pate as if it tingled yet with the liberal supply of raps, the memory  of which was the only thing he brought away after a year with his \"other  master.\"    \"I think I could read this,\" said Nat, who had been examining the books.    \"Read a bit, then; I'll help you,\" resumed Tommy, with a patronizing  air.    So Nat did his best, and floundered through a page with may friendly  \"boosts\" from Tommy, who told him he would soon \"go it\" as well as  anybody. Then they sat and talked boy-fashion about all sorts of things,  among others, gardening; for Nat, looking down from his perch, asked  what was planted in the many little patches lying below them on the  other side of the brook.    \"These are our farms,\" said Tommy. \"We each have our own patch, and  raise what we like in it, only have to choose different things, and  can't change till the crop is in, and we must keep it in order all  summer.\"    \"What are you going to raise this year?\"    \"Wal, I cattleated to hev beans, as they are about the easiest crop  a-goin'.\"    Nat could not help laughing, for Tommy had pushed back his hat, put his  hands in his pockets, and drawled out his words in unconscious imitation  of Silas, the man who managed the place for Mr. Bhaer.    \"Come, you needn't laugh; beans are ever so much easier than corn or  potatoes. I tried melons last year, but the bugs were a bother, and the  old things wouldn't get ripe before the frost, so I didn't have but one  good water and two little 'mush mellions,'\" said Tommy, relapsing into a  \"Silasism\" with the last word.    \"Corn looks pretty growing,\" said Nat, politely, to atone for his laugh.    \"Yes, but you have to hoe it over and over again. Now, six weeks' beans  only have to be done once or so, and they get ripe soon. I'm going to  try 'em, for I spoke first. Stuffy wanted 'em, but he's got to take  peas; they only have to be picked, and he ought to do it, he eats such a  lot.\"    \"I wonder if I shall have a garden?\" said Nat, thinking that even  corn-hoeing must be pleasant work.    \"Of course you will,\" said a voice from below, and there was Mr. Bhaer  returned from his walk, and come to find them, for he managed to have  a little talk with every one of the lads some time during the day, and  found that these chats gave them a good start for the coming week.    Sympathy is a sweet thing, and it worked wonders here, for each boy knew  that Father Bhaer was interested in him, and some were readier to open  their hearts to him than to a woman, especially the older ones, who  liked to talk over their hopes and plans, man to man. When sick or in  trouble they instinctively turned to Mrs. Jo, while the little ones made  her their mother-confessor on all occasions.    In descending from their nest, Tommy fell into the brook; being used to  it, he calmly picked himself out and retired to the house to be dried.  This left Nat to Mr. Bhaer, which was just what he wished, and, during  the stroll they took among the garden plots, he won the lad's heart by  giving him a little \"farm,\" and discussing crops with him as gravely as  if the food for the family depended on the harvest. From this pleasant  topic they went to others, and Nat had many new and helpful thoughts put  into a mind that received them as gratefully as the thirsty earth had  received the warm spring rain. All supper time he brooded over them,  often fixing his eyes on Mr. Bhaer with an inquiring look, that seemed  to say, \"I like that, do it again, sir.\" I don't know whether the man  understood the child's mute language or not, but when the boys were all  gathered together in Mrs. Bhaer's parlor for the Sunday evening talk,  he chose a subject which might have been suggested by the walk in the  garden.    As he looked about him Nat thought it seemed more like a great family  than a school, for the lads were sitting in a wide half-circle round the  fire, some on chairs, some on the rug, Daisy and Demi on the knees of  Uncle Fritz, and Rob snugly stowed away in the back of his mother's  easy-chair, where he could nod unseen if the talk got beyond his depth.    Every one looked quite comfortable, and listened attentively, for the  long walk made rest agreeable, and as every boy there knew that he would  be called upon for his views, he kept his wits awake to be ready with an  answer.    \"Once upon a time,\" began Mr. Bhaer, in the dear old-fashioned way,  \"there was a great and wise gardener who had the largest garden ever  seen. A wonderful and lovely place it was, and he watched over it with  the greatest skill and care, and raised all manner of excellent and  useful things. But weeds would grow even in this fine garden; often the  ground was bad and the good seeds sown in it would not spring up. He  had many under gardeners to help him. Some did their duty and earned the  rich wages he gave them; but others neglected their parts and let them  run to waste, which displeased him very much. But he was very patient,  and for thousands and thousands of years he worked and waited for his  great harvest.\"    \"He must have been pretty old,\" said Demi, who was looking straight into  Uncle Fritz's face, as if to catch every word.    \"Hush, Demi, it's a fairy story,\" whispered Daisy.    \"No, I think it's an arrygory,\" said Demi.    \"What is a arrygory?\" called out Tommy, who was of an inquiring turn.    \"Tell him, Demi, if you can, and don't use words unless you are quite  sure you know what they mean,\" said Mr. Bhaer.    \"I do know, Grandpa told me! A fable is a arrygory; it's a story that  means something. My 'Story without an end' is one, because the child in  it means a soul; don't it, Aunty?\" cried Demi, eager to prove himself  right.    \"That's it, dear; and Uncle's story is an allegory, I am quite sure; so  listen and see what it means,\" returned Mrs. Jo, who always took part in  whatever was going on, and enjoyed it as much as any boy among them.    Demi composed himself, and Mr. Bhaer went on in his best English, for he  had improved much in the last five years, and said the boys did it.    \"This great gardener gave a dozen or so of little plots to one of his  servants, and told him to do his best and see what he could raise. Now  this servant was not rich, nor wise, nor very good, but he wanted to  help because the gardener had been very kind to him in many ways. So he  gladly took the little plots and fell to work. They were all sorts of  shapes and sizes, and some were very good soil, some rather stony, and  all of them needed much care, for in the rich soil the weeds grew fast,  and in the poor soil there were many stones.\"    \"What was growing in them besides the weeds, and stones?\" asked Nat; so  interested, he forgot his shyness and spoke before them all.    \"Flowers,\" said Mr. Bhaer, with a kind look. \"Even the roughest, most  neglected little bed had a bit of heart's-ease or a sprig of mignonette  in it. One had roses, sweet peas, and daisies in it,\" here he pinched  the plump cheek of the little girl leaning on his arm. \"Another had all  sorts of curious plants in it, bright pebbles, a vine that went climbing  up like Jack's beanstalk, and many good seeds just beginning to sprout;  for, you see, this bed had been taken fine care of by a wise old man,  who had worked in gardens of this sort all his life.\"    At this part of the \"arrygory,\" Demi put his head on one side like an  inquisitive bird, and fixed his bright eye on his uncle's face, as if he  suspected something and was on the watch. But Mr. Bhaer looked perfectly  innocent, and went on glancing from one young face to another, with a  grave, wistful look, that said much to his wife, who knew how earnestly  he desired to do his duty in these little garden plots.    \"As I tell you, some of these beds were easy to cultivate, that means  to take care of Daisy, and others were very hard. There was one  particularly sunshiny little bed that might have been full of fruits and  vegetables as well as flowers, only it wouldn't take any pains, and when  the man sowed, well, we'll say melons in this bed, they came to nothing,  because the little bed neglected them. The man was sorry, and kept on  trying, though every time the crop failed, all the bed said, was, 'I  forgot.'\"    Here a general laugh broke out, and every one looked at Tommy, who had  pricked up his ears at the word \"melons,\" and hung down his head at the  sound of his favorite excuse.    \"I knew he meant us!\" cried Demi, clapping his hands. \"You are the man,  and we are the little gardens; aren't we, Uncle Fritz?\"    \"You have guessed it. Now each of you tell me what crop I shall try to  sow in you this spring, so that next autumn I may get a good harvest out  of my twelve, no, thirteen, plots,\" said Mr. Bhaer, nodding at Nat as he  corrected himself.    \"You can't sow corn and beans and peas in us. Unless you mean we are to  eat a great many and get fat,\" said Stuffy, with a sudden brightening of  his round, dull face as the pleasing idea occurred to him.    \"He don't mean that kind of seeds. He means things to make us good; and  the weeds are faults,\" cried Demi, who usually took the lead in these  talks, because he was used to this sort of thing, and liked it very  much.    \"Yes, each of you think what you need most, and tell me, and I will help  you to grow it; only you must do your best, or you will turn out like  Tommy's melons, all leaves and no fruit. I will begin with the oldest,  and ask the mother what she will have in her plot, for we are all parts  of the beautiful garden, and may have rich harvests for our Master if we  love Him enough,\" said Father Bhaer.    \"I shall devote the whole of my plot to the largest crop of patience I  can get, for that is what I need most,\" said Mrs. Jo, so soberly that  the lads fell to thinking in good earnest what they should say"]]]
