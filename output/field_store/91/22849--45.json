The soft  wool, used for both warp and woof, is excellent for weaving kindergarten  designs. This should be done with a close warp, which may be extended  each side of the head and foot piece as a fringe. By extending the warp  any length desired beyond the head piece, long strips for slumber robes,  afghans, and such articles can be woven. The warp may be strung with  twine as near the color of the wool as possible, and a plain rug be  made, with colored stripes at each end. A very pretty and easy gift for  a little child to make is a holder for the teapot, as described on page  92. The Germantown knitting yarn, which is more tightly twisted, makes  very pretty rugs and mats. It is sometimes used for Navajo blankets.    [Sidenote: _Darning cotton_]    White dolls'-towels, with red or blue stripes, are made of darning  cotton. Baste a small piece of canvas at one end and cross-stitch Miss  Dolly's initial.    [Sidenote: _Knitting cotton_]    Plain white bedspreads, or white combined with a color in a kindergarten  design, can be made of knitting cotton which is a little coarser than  darning cotton. Knot a fringe on all sides. Lunch cloths and table  covers for Miss Dolly can be made in the same way.    [Sidenote: _Macreme cord_]    Macreme cord is the best material for hammocks. It comes in many  beautiful colors, at a few cents a ball.    [Sidenote: _Leather strips_]    To weave a kindergarten design in two colors of leather strips, have the  leather cut the desired width, and fasten them to a piece of strong  muslin at the top and bottom of the mat or panel. Fit the muslin over  the teeth in head and foot pieces by cutting a small opening.    [Sidenote: _Celluloid strips_]    [Sidenote: _Leather strips_]    Celluloid strips may be treated in the same way. Leather and celluloid  strips can be woven free-hand like the paper strips.    [Sidenote: _Raffia_]    Many beautiful articles can be made of raffia, which is a palm fibre  brought from the island of Madagascar. It can be obtained in the natural  color at most of the department stores, the kindergarten supply houses,  and the florists. The cost is usually 20 cents or 25 cents per pound,  although the florists will sell a few cents' worth. It can be dyed  easily, and with little expense, with Diamond or aniline dyes. It should  first be washed. Care should be taken, in the selection, to obtain long,  smooth pieces which will be at least one-half inch wide when wet, and of  an even color. Some of the raffia is musty and badly spotted. It is well  to wet all of it first, then straighten and allow it to dry. While  weaving, keep the raffia moist by dipping the fingers now and then in a  cup of water. Experience has proved this method to be more satisfactory  than to allow the raffia to remain in water and become thoroughly  soaked, particularly the colored raffia. If one cares to expend money  instead of time and trouble, the raffia can be dyed in very beautiful  colors at the dye houses.    [Sidenote: _Shetland wool_]    Blankets for Miss Dolly can be made of the soft Shetland wool and  Germantown zephyr. For bed blankets, cream color, with stripes of two  or more colors, are very attractive. Carriage blankets made with white  centers and colored borders, or with a tone for the center and a shade  for the border, are a great addition to the carriage, as well as a  source of comfort to the little occupant. Bind the edges with ribbon and  run a narrow one through the beading formed by taking out the extra  rods. This ribbon can be run all around the center part by leaving out a  few woof threads at the top and bottom.    [Sidenote: _Knitting silk_]    By stringing a close warp of knitting silk and extending it the required  length, shawl-straps, suspenders, belts, and garters can be woven. The  rods should be adjusted for the desired width. Finish at each end with  pieces of silk elastic of the same color, and with buckles.    [Sidenote: _Angora wool_]    Angora wool makes pretty Tam O'Shanters. Initials can be woven in any  article.    [Sidenote: _Books of patterns_]    Small books containing cross-stitch designs can be found at the German  and French embroidery stores in large cities--sometimes, but rarely, at  the art counter in department stores. The \"Kindergarten Guides\" can be  obtained at most public libraries, or a kindergartner friend will be  glad to loan one.          Chapter Six    DIRECTIONS FOR DYEING      [Sidenote: _Diamond dyes_]    A few hints with regard to dyeing raffia, cheese cloth, white cord for  hammocks, and other materials, may be found useful. For raffia use the  Diamond dyes which are intended for wool or silk. Wash the raffia first.  The color will be improved by soaking the raffia a day in alum water,  one-half pound to the gallon. Dye once used can be kept in an air-tight  dish and reheated whenever needed.    [Sidenote: _Vegetable dyes_]    Should one be interested in vegetable dyes much information can be  obtained at the public libraries. Dr. Washington Matthews speaks of  Indian dyes in his article on the Navajo weavers mentioned in this book.  \"How to Make and How to Mend\" also contains some good suggestions about  dyes.    [Sidenote: _Mrs. Candace Wheeler's pamphlet_]    In her little pamphlet, _Home Industries and Domestic Weavings_,  published by the Associated Artists, 115 East 23d Street, New York City,  Mrs. Candace Wheeler has an interesting chapter on \"Rag-Carpet Weaving.\"  Her suggestions for dyeing rags apply equally to yarns and to other  materials which may be used on hand looms for children. Through her kind  permission I am allowed to quote the following suggestions:    [Sidenote: _Uses of the indigo tub_]    \"In the early days of this present century a dye tub was as much a  necessity in every house as a spinning-wheel, and the reestablishment of  it in houses where weaving is practiced is almost a necessity; in fact,  it would be of far greater use at present than in the days when it was  only used to dye the wool needed for family knitting and weaving. All  shades of blue, from sky-blue to blue-black, can be dyed in the indigo  tub; and it has the merit of being a cheap as well as an almost  perfectly fast dye. It could be used for dyeing warps as well as  fillings, and I have before spoken of the difficulty, indeed almost  impossibility, of procuring indigo-dyed carpet yarn.    [Sidenote: _Blue universally used_]    [Sidenote: _Green_]    \"Blue is, perhaps, more universally useful than any other color in  rag-rug making, since it is safe for both cotton and wool, and covers a  range from the white rug with blue warp, the blue rug with white warp,  through all varieties of shade to the dark blue, or clouded blue and  green rug, also, upon white warp. It can also be used in connection with  yellow or orange, or with copperas or walnut dye, in different shades  of green; and, in short, unless one has exceptional advantages in buying  rags from woolen mills, I can hardly imagine a profitable industry of  rag-weaving established in any farmhouse without the existence of an  indigo dyeing tub.    [Sidenote: _Red_]    [Sidenote: _Copperas_]    [Sidenote: _Dull green_]    \"The next important color is red. Fortunately, red warps can be bought  which are reasonably fast, but the only way to procure red rags in  quantity is to dye them, and, although the dye is somewhat expensive,  there are two colors, turkey red and cardinal red, which are extremely  good for the purpose. Probably these could be bought at wholesale from  dealers in chemicals and dyestuffs at much cheaper rates than by the  small paper from the druggist or the country store. Copperas gives a  fast nankeen-colored dye, and this is very useful in making a dull green  by an after dip in the indigo tub.    [Sidenote: _Domestic dyes_]    [Sidenote: _Nut stains_]    [Sidenote: _Leaf stains_]    [Sidenote: _Iron rust_]    [Sidenote: _Ink stains_]    \"There are some valuable domestic dyes which are within the reach of  every country dweller, the cheapest and best of which is walnut or  butternut stain. This is made by steeping the bark of the tree or the  shell of the nut until the water is dark with color, and setting it with  alum. It will give various shades of yellow, brown, dark brown, and  green brown, according to the strength of the decoction or the state of  the bark or nut when used. If the bark of the nut is used when green,  the result will be a yellow brown; and this stain is also valuable in  making a green tint when an after dip of blue is added. Leaves and  tree-bark will give a brown with a very green tint, and these different  shades used in different rags woven together give a very agreeably  clouded effect. Walnut stain will itself set or fasten some others; for  instance, pokeberry stain, which is a lovely crimson, can be made  reasonably fast by setting it with walnut juice. Iron rust is the most  indelible of all stains, besides being a most agreeable yellow, and it  is not hard to obtain, as bits of old iron left standing in water will  soon manufacture it. It would be a good use for old tin saucepans, and  various other house utensils which have come to a state of  mischievousness instead of usefulness. Ink gives various shades of gray  according to its strength, but it would be cheaper to purchase it in the  form of logwood than as ink.    [Sidenote: _Vegetable dyes_]    \"There is a strong and well-founded preference among art producers in  favor of vegetable dyes, and yet it is possible to use certain of the  aniline colors, especially in combination, in safe and satisfactory  ways.    [Sidenote: _The variety of shades_]    \"Everyone who undertakes domestic weaving must know how to dye one or  two good colors. Black, of course, and the half-black, or gray, which a  good colorist of my acquaintance calls _a light black_.

Take Griblo along with you and make sure  he has film in his camera this time.\"    \"Yes, sir,\" Tarb said. \"Anything you say, sir.\"    He pretended not to notice her sarcasm. \"I have a list of the questions  you should ask her.\" He fixed her with his eye. \"You stick to them, do  you hear me? I don't want anything controversial.\" He rummaged among the  papers on his desk. \"I know I had it half an hour ago. Sit down, will  you, Tarb? Stop hopping around.\"    \"If I can't have a perch, I want a stool,\" Tarb said. \"This is a private  office and I think it's a gross affectation for you to have those silly,  uncomfortable chairs in it.\"    \"If you would have your wings clipped like Mr. Zarnon's--\" Miss Snow  began before Stet could stop her.    \"Stet, you _didn't_!\"    His crest thrashed back and forth. \"They'll grow back again and it's so  much more convenient this way. After all, I can't use them here and I do  have to associate with Terrestrials and use their equipment. The consul  has had his wings clipped also and so have several of our more prominent  industrialists--\"    \"Oh, _Stet_!\" Tarb wailed. \"I was beginning to think some pretty hard  things about you, but I wouldn't ever have dreamed you'd do anything as  awful as that!\"    \"Why should I have to apologize to you?\" he raged. \"Who do you think you  are, anyway? You're an incompetent little fool. I should have fired you  that first day. I've let you get away with so much only because you have  a pretty face. You've only been on Earth a couple of months; how can you  presume to think you know what's good and what's bad for the Fizbians  here?\"    \"I may not know what's good,\" she retorted, \"but I certainly do know  what's bad. And that's you, Stet--you and everything you stand for. You  not only don't have the courage of your convictions, you don't even have  any convictions. You're ashamed of being a Fizbian, ashamed of anything  that makes Fizbians different from Terrestrials, even if it's something  better, something that most Terrans would like to have. You're a damned  hypocrite, Stet Zarnon, that's what you are--professing to help our  people when actually you're hurting them by trying to force them into  the mold of an alien species.\"    She brushed back her crest. \"I take it I'm fired,\" she said more  quietly. \"Do you want me to interview the consul's wife first or leave  right away?\"    It took Stet a moment to bring his voice under control. \"Interview her  first. We'll talk this over when you get back.\"           *       *       *       *       *    It was pleasant to be away from the office, she thought as the taxi  pulled toward the airfield, and doing wingwork again, even if it proved  to be the first and last time on this planet. Griblo sat hunched in a  corner of the seat, too preoccupied with the camera, which, even after  two years, he hadn't fully mastered, to pay attention to her.    Outside, it was raining, the kind of thin drizzle that, on Fizbus or  Earth, could go on for days. Tarb had brought along the native umbrella  she had purchased in the hotel gift shop--a delightful contraption that  was supposed to keep off the rain and didn't, and was supposed to  collapse and did, but at the wrong moments. She planned to take it back  with her when she returned to Fizbus. Approved souvenir or not, it was  the same beautiful purple as her eyes. And, besides, who had made the  ruling about approved souvenirs? Stet, of course.    \"No reason why we couldn't have autofax brought from Home,\" Griblo  suddenly grumbled.    Tarb pulled herself back from her thoughts. \"I suppose Stet wouldn't let  you,\" she said. \"But now that one scripto's here,\" she went on somewhat  complacently, \"he'll have to--\"    \"Keep this planet charming and unspoiled, he says,\" Griblo interrupted  ungratefully. \"Its spiritual values will be corrupted by too much  contact with a crass advanced technology. And, of course, he's got the  local camera manufacturers solidly behind him. I wonder whether they  advertise in the _Times_ because he helps keep autofax off Terra or  whether he keeps the autofax off Terra because they advertise in the  _Times_.\"    \"But what does he care about advertising? He may talk as if he owned the  _Times_, but he doesn't.\"    Griblo gave a nasty laugh. \"No, he doesn't, but if the Terran edition  didn't show a profit, it'd fold quicker than you can flip your wings and  he'd have to go back to nasty old up-to-date Fizbus as a lowly  sub-editor. And he wouldn't like that one bit. Our Stet, as you may have  noticed, is fond of running things to suit himself.\"    \"But Mr. Grupe told me that the _Times_ isn't interested in money. It's  running this edition of the paper only as a service to--oh, I suppose  all that was a lot of birdseed, too!\"    \"Grupe!\" Griblo snorted. \"The sanctimonious old buzzard! He's a big  stockholder on the paper. Bet you didn't know that, did you? All they're  out for is money. Fizbian money, Terrestrial money--so long as it's  cash.\"    \"Tell me, Griblo,\" Tarb asked, \"what does 'When in Rome, do as the  Romans do' mean?\"    Griblo grinned sourly. \"Stet's favorite motto.\" He moved along the seat  closer to her. \"I'll tell you what it means, chicken. When on Earth,  don't be a Fizbian.\"           *       *       *       *       *    The consul's wife, an old mauve creature, did not seem overpleased to  see Tarb, since the younger, prettier Fizbian definitely took the  spotlight away from her. The press had, of course, seen Tarb before, but  at that time they hadn't been able to communicate directly with her and  they didn't, she now found out, think nearly as much of Stet as he did  of them.    Tarb couldn't attempt to deviate much from Stet's questions, for the  consul's wife was not very cooperative and the consul himself watched  both women narrowly. He was a good friend of Stet's, Tarb knew, and  apparently Stet had taken the other man into his confidence.    When the interviews were over and the consular party had left, Tarb  remained to chat with the Terrestrial journalists. Despite Griblo's  worried objections, she joined them in the Moonfield Restaurant, where  she daringly partook of a cup of coffee and then another and another.    After that, things weren't very clear. She dimly remembered the other  reporters assuring her that she shouldn't disfigure her lovely wings  with a stole ... and then pirouetting in the air over the bar to  prolonged applause ... and then she was in the taxi again with Griblo  shaking her.    \"Wake up, Tarb--we're almost at the office! Stet'll have me plucked for  this!\"    Tarb sat up and pushed her crest out of her eyes. The sky was growing  dark. They must have been gone a long time.    \"I'll never hear the end of this,\" Griblo moaned. \"Why, if only he could  get someone to fill my place, Stet would fire me like a shot! Not that I  wouldn't quit if I could get another job.\"    \"Oh, it'll be mostly me he'll be mad at.\" Tarb pulled out her compact.  Stet had warned her not to polish her eyeballs in public, but the ground  with him! Her head hurt. And her feathers, she saw in the mirror, had  turned almost beige. She looked horrible. She felt horrible. And Stet  would probably think she was horrible.    \"When Stet's mad,\" Griblo prophesied darkly, \"he's mad at _everybody_!\"    And Stet _was_ mad. He was waiting in the newsroom, his emerald-blue  eyes blazing as if he had not only polished but lacquered them.    \"What's the idea of taking six hours to cover a simple story!\" he  shouted as soon as the door began to open. \"Aside from the trivial  matter of a deadline to be met--Griblo, _where's Tarb_? Nothing's  happened to her, has it?\"    \"Naaah,\" Griblo said, unslinging his camera. \"She took a short cut,  only she got held up by a terrace. Snagged her umbrella on it, I  believe. I heard her yelling when I was waiting for the elevator;  I didn't know nice girls knew language like that. She should be up  any minute now.... There she is.\"    He pointed to a window, through which the lissome form of the young  feature writer could be seen, tapping on the glass in order to attract  attention.    [Illustration]    \"Somebody better open it for her,\" the cameraman suggested. \"Probably  not meant to open from the outside. Not many people come in that way, I  guess.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Open-mouthed, the whole newsroom stared at the window. Finally the Copy  Editor got up and let a dripping Tarb in.    \"Nearly thought I wouldn't make it,\" she observed, shaking herself in a  flurry of wet pink feathers. The rest of the staff ducked, most of them  too late. \"Umbrella didn't do much good,\" she continued, closing it. It  left a little puddle on the rug. \"My wings got soaked right away.\" She  tossed her wet crest out of her eyes. \"Golly, but it's good to fly  again. Haven't done it for months, but it seems like years.\" Her eye  caught Miss Snow's. \"You don't know what you're missing!\"    \"Tarb,\" Stet thundered, \"you've been drinking coffee! _Griblo!_\" But the  cameraman had nimbly sought sanctuary in the dark-room.    \"You'd better go home, Tarb.\" When Stet's eye tufts met across his nose,  he was downright ugly, she realized. \"Griblo can give me the dope and  I'll write up the story myself. I can fill it out with canned copy. And  you and I will discuss this situation in the morning.\"    \"Won't go home when there's work to be done. Duty calls me.\" Giving a  brief and quite recognizable imitation of a Terrestrial trumpet, Tarb  stalked down the corridor to her office.    Drosmig looked up from his perch, to which he was still miraculously  clinging at that hour. \"So it got you, too?... Sorry ... nice girl.\"    \"It hasn't got me,\" Tarb replied, picking up a letter marked _Urgent_.  \"I've got it.\" She scanned the letter, then made hastily for Stet's  office.    He sat drumming on his desk with the antique"]]]
