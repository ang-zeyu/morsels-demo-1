They wear black shields,  their bodies are painted black, they choose dark nights for engaging in  battle; and by the very awe and ghastly hue of their army, strike the  enemy with dread, as none can bear this their aspect so surprising and  as it were quite infernal. For, in all battles the eyes are vanquished  first.    Beyond the Lygians dwell the Gothones, under the rule of a King; and  thence held in subjection somewhat stricter than the other German  nations, yet not so strict as to extinguish all their liberty.  Immediately adjoining are the Rugians and Lemovians upon the coast of  the ocean, and of these several nations the characteristics are a round  shield, a short sword and kingly government. Next occur the communities  of the Suiones, situated in the ocean itself; and besides their strength  in men and arms, very powerful at sea. The form of their vessels varies  thus far from ours, that they have prows at each end, so as to be always  ready to row to shore without turning nor are they moved by sails, nor  on their sides have benches of oars placed, but the rowers ply here and  there in all parts of the ship alike, as in some rivers is done, and  change their oars from place to place, just as they shift their course  hither or thither. To wealth also, amongst them, great veneration is  paid, and thence a single ruler governs them, without all restriction of  power, and exacting unlimited obedience. Neither here, as amongst other  nations of Germany, are arms used indifferently by all, but shut up and  warded under the care of a particular keeper, who in truth too is always  a slave: since from all sudden invasions and attacks from their foes,  the ocean protects them: besides that armed bands, when they are not  employed, grow easily debauched and tumultuous. The truth is, it suits  not the interest of an arbitrary Prince, to trust the care and power of  arms either with a nobleman or with a freeman, or indeed with any man  above the condition of a slave.    Beyond the Suiones is another sea, one very heavy and almost void  of agitation; and by it the whole globe is thought to be bounded and  environed, for that the reflection of the sun, after his setting,  continues till his rising, so bright as to darken the stars. To this,  popular opinion has added, that the tumult also of his emerging from  the sea is heard, that forms divine are then seen, as likewise the rays  about his head. Only thus far extend the limits of nature, if what fame  says be true. Upon the right of the Suevian Sea the AEstyan nations  reside, who use the same customs and attire with the Suevians; their  language more resembles that of Britain. They worship the Mother of the  Gods. As the characteristic of their national superstition, they wear  the images of wild boars. This alone serves them for arms, this is the  safeguard of all, and by this every worshipper of the goddess is secured  even amidst his foes. Rare amongst them is the use of weapons of iron,  but frequent that of clubs. In producing of grain and the other fruits  of the earth, they labour with more assiduity and patience than is  suitable to the usual laziness of Germans. Nay, they even search the  deep, and of all the rest are the only people who gather _amber_. They  call it _glasing_, and find it amongst the shallows and upon the very  shore. But, according to the ordinary incuriosity and ignorance of  Barbarians, they have neither learnt, nor do they inquire, what is  its nature, or from what cause it is produced. In truth it lay long  neglected amongst the other gross discharges of the sea; till from our  luxury, it gained a name and value. To themselves it is of no use: they  gather it rough, they expose it in pieces coarse and unpolished, and for  it receive a price with wonder. You would however conceive it to be a  liquor issuing from trees, for that in the transparent substance are  often seen birds and other animals, such as at first stuck in the soft  gum, and by it, as it hardened, became quite enclosed. I am apt to  believe that, as in the recesses of the East are found woods and groves  dropping frankincense and balms, so in the isles and continent of the  West such gums are extracted by the force and proximity of the sun; at  first liquid and flowing into the next sea, then thrown by the winds  and waves upon the opposite shore. If you try the nature of amber by  the application of fire, it kindles like a torch; and feeds a thick and  unctuous flame very high scented, and presently becomes glutinous like  pitch or rosin.    Upon the Suiones, border the people Sitones; and, agreeing with them in  all other things, differ from them in one, that here the sovereignty is  exercised by a woman. So notoriously do they degenerate not only from  a state of liberty, but even below a state of bondage. Here end the  territories of the Suevians.    Whether amongst the Sarmatians or the Germans I ought to account the  Peucinians, the Venedians, and the Fennians, is what I cannot determine;  though the Peucinians, whom some call Basstarnians, speak the same  language with the Germans, use the same attire, build like them, and  live like them, in that dirtiness and sloth so common to all.  Somewhat they are corrupted into the fashion of the Sarmatians by the  inter-marriages of the principal sort with that nation: from whence  the Venedians have derived very many of their customs and a great  resemblance. For they are continually traversing and infesting with  robberies all the forests and mountains lying between the Peucinians  and Fennians. Yet they are rather reckoned amongst the Germans, for  that they have fixed houses, and carry shields, and prefer travelling  on foot, and excel in swiftness. Usages these, all widely differing from  those of the Sarmatians, who live on horseback and dwell in waggons.  In wonderful savageness live the nation of the Fennians, and in beastly  poverty, destitute of arms, of horses, and of homes; their food, the  common herbs; their apparel, skins; their bed, the earth; their only  hope in their arrows, which for want of iron they point with bones.  Their common support they have from the chase, women as well as men;  for with these the former wander up and down, and crave a portion of  the prey. Nor other shelter have they even for their babes, against the  violence of tempests and ravening beasts, than to cover them with the  branches of trees twisted together; this a reception for the old men,  and hither resort the young. Such a condition they judge more happy than  the painful occupation of cultivating the ground, than the labour of  rearing houses, than the agitations of hope and fear attending the  defence of their own property or the seizing that of others. Secure  against the designs of men, secure against the malignity of the Gods,  they have accomplished a thing of infinite difficulty; that to them  nothing remains even to be wished.    What further accounts we have are fabulous: as that the Hellusians and  Oxiones have the countenances and aspect of men, with the bodies and  limbs of savage beasts. This, as a thing about which I have no certain  information, I shall leave untouched."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30000"],[0,"The Bird Book (#7)"],[1,"for the lower portions of the island, although they nest on  the ledges also. Besides man, these Gulls are the greatest enemies that  the Murres have to content against. They are always on the watch and if  a Murre leaves its nest, one of the Gulls is nearly always ready to  pounce upon the egg and carry it away bodily in his bill. The Gulls too  suffer when the eggers come, for their eggs are gathered up with the  Murres for the markets. They make their nests of weeds and grass, and  during May and June lay three eggs showing the usual variations of color  common to the Gulls eggs. Size 2.75 x 1.90.      50. SIBERIAN GULL. _Larus affinis._    This bird does not nest in North America, and has a place on our list,  by its accidental occurrence in Greenland. It is an Old World species  and its nesting habits and eggs are like those of the Herring Gull.      51. HERRING GULL. _Larus argentatus._    Range.--Whole of the Northern Hemisphere, breeding from Maine and  British Columbia northward and wintering south to the Gulf.    This Gull, which formerly was No. 51a, a subspecies of the European  variety, is now regarded as identical with it, and is no longer a  sub-species. It is twenty-four inches in length, has a light gray mantle  and black primaries which are tipped with white. The Herring Gulls nest  in colonies in favorable localities throughout their range, chiefly on  the coasts and islands. A few pairs also nest on islands in some of the  inland bodies of fresh water. Except in places where they are  continually molested, when they will build in trees, they place their  nests on the ground either making no nest on the bare sand, or building  a bulky nest of seaweed in the grass on higher parts of the island. They  lay three eggs of a grayish color marked with brown. In rare cases  unspotted bluish white eggs are found. Size 2.80 x 1.70.    [Illustration 046: Western Gull. Herring Gull.]  [Illustration: Buff.]  [Illustration: left hand margin.]    Page 45    52. VEGA GULL. _Larus vegae._    Range.--Coast of Alaska, south in winter to California.    Similar to the Herring Gull, but with the mantle darker, but not so dark  as in the Western Gull. The nesting habits and eggs are the same as  those of the Herring Gull, except that in a series, the eggs of the Vega  will average a little darker in ground color. It nests during May on the  coasts and islands of Bering Sea, placing its eggs in a hollow on the  ground. Size 2.75 x 1.65.      53. CALIFORNIA GULL. _Larus californicus._    Range.--Western North America, breeding in the interior.    A smaller Gull than the Herring with the primaries grayish instead of  black; length twenty-five inches. This Gull is found in winter on the  coast from British Columbia southward to Lower California, but nests in  the interior from Utah northward. They nest very abundantly around the  Great Salt Lake, placing their nests generally upon the bare ground.  Sometimes there is a scant lining of grasses or weeds and again the  nests will be situated in the midst of a tussock of grass. Three or four  eggs generally constitute a set, but occasionally five are laid. The  usual nesting time is during May. They show the same great variations in  color and markings common to most of the Gulls. Size 2.60 x 1.80.      54. RING-BILLED GULL. _Larus delawarenis._    Range.--Whole of North America, breeding from the United States  northward and wintering south to the Gulf States.    A small Gull, eighteen inches in length, with a light gray mantle, black  primaries with white tips, and always to be distinguished in the  breeding season by the black band around the middle of the greenish  yellow bill. They nest in enormous colonies on islands in the interior  of the country and in smaller colonies on the coasts. Thousands of them  breed on the lakes of the Dakotas and northward. The majority of them  nest on the ground, although on the coast they are often found on the  cliffs. They commonly lay three eggs placing them in a slight hollow in  the ground, generally on the grassy portions of the islands. The color  varies from grayish to brownish, marked with brown and lilac. The height  of the nesting season is in June. Size of eggs, 2.80 x 1.75.    [Illustration 047: Grayish brown.]  [Illustration: Ring-billed Gull. California Gull.]  [Illustration: right hand margin.]    Page 46    55. SHORT-BILLED GULL. _Larus brachyrhynchus._    Range.--Breeds from the interior of British Columbia northward to  Alaska; south in winter to Lower California.    The Short-billed or American Mew Gull is seventeen inches in length, has  a short, stout bill and is otherwise similar to the preceding species.  Nests on islands in the lakes and along the river banks of Alaska. The  nest is made of grass, weeds and moss and is placed on the ground. Early  in June the birds lay their set of three eggs, the ground color of which  is greenish brown marked with dark brown. Size 2.25 x 1.60.  Data.--Mackenzie River, N. W. T., June 18, 1900. Three eggs. Nest made  of seaweed and grass and placed on the ground on an island in the river.      56. MEW GULL. _Larus canus._    This is the European variety of the above species, breeding commonly  both in the British Isles and northern Europe. This species is given a  place in our avifauna because of its accidental appearance in Labrador.      57. HEERMAN'S GULL. _Larus heermanni._    Range.--Pacific Coast of North America from British Columbia south to  Panama, breeding chiefly south of the United States border.    A very handsome species, often called the White-headed Gull, and wholly  unlike any other; length seventeen inches. Adults, in summer, have the  entire head, neck and throat white, this shading quite abruptly into the  slaty upper and under parts; the primaries and tail are black, the  latter and the secondaries being tipped with white. The legs and bill  are vermilion. They are found off the coast of California, but are not  believed to breed there. They are known to breed on some of the islands  off the Mexican coast nesting on the ground the same as the other  species. The three eggs are greenish drab in color and are marked with  different shades of brown and lilac. Size 2.45 x 1.50.    [Illustration: Pale greenish-brown.]  [Illustration: Short-billed Gull. Heerman's Gull.]  [Illustration: Left hand margin.]    Page 47    58. LAUGHING GULL. LARUS ATRICILLA.    Range.--Eastern North America, breeding from the Gulf to Nova Scotia,  chiefly on the coast. A beautiful Gull, 16 inches long, with a dark  slate colored head, gray mantle, black primaries, and white neck,  underparts and tail. Bill and feet red. This bird has its name from its  peculiar laughing cry when alarmed or angry; it is also called the  Black-headed Gull. They nest by thousands on the islands off the Gulf  Coast and along the South Atlantic States. The nest is placed on the  ground and is made of seaweed. Three, four and sometimes five eggs are  laid, of a grayish to greenish brown color, marked with brown and lilac.  Size 2.25 x 1.60. Data.--Timbalin Is., La., June 3, 1896. Three eggs.  Nest of drift grass thrown in a pile about 8 inches high, slightly  hollowed on top, in low marsh back of beach. Collector, E. A. McIlhenny.    [Illustration 049: Pale grayish brown.]  [Illustration: Laughing Gull.]  [Illustration: RING-BILLED GULL--Gray.]  [Illustration: deco.]  [Illustration: right hand margin.]    Page 48    59. FRANKLIN'S GULL. _Larus franklini._    Range.--Interior North America, breeding from middle United States  northward.    Like the last but smaller and with the primaries light. Underparts rosy  in breeding season. Nests very abundantly in the marshes of Minnesota  and northward. Nest made of grasses and placed in the marsh grass barely  above the surface of the water. Eggs same color as the last but the  markings more inclined to zigzag lines. Size 2.10 x 1.40. Data.--Heron  Lake, Minn., May 26, 1885. Nest of wet sedge stalks and rubbish placed  in a bunch of standing sedge in shallow water; at least five thousand  birds in rookery. Collector, J. W. Preston.      60. BONAPARTE'S GULL. _Larus philadelphia._    Range.--Breeds in the northern parts of North America; winters from  Maine and British Columbia to the southern border of the United States.    Smaller than the last; 14 inches long. Plumage similar, but bill slender  and black. They nest in great numbers on the marshes of Manitoba and to  the northward. The nests, of sticks and grass, are placed on the higher  parts of the marsh and the usual complement of three eggs is laid during  the latter part of June. The eggs are grayish to greenish brown, marked  with dark brown and lilac. Size 1.90 x 1.30.    [Illustration 050: Grayish brown.]  [Illustration: Franklin's Gull. Bonaparte's Gull.]  [Illustration: Pale grayish brown.]  [Illustration: left hand margin.]    Page 49    60.1. LITTLE GULL. _Larus minutus._    This Gull is the smallest of the family; it is a European bird, and has  accidentally strayed to our shores but a few times. Its plumage is  similar to that of the Bonaparte Gull but the bill is red. It breeds in  the marshes around the Baltic Sea, placing its nest of dead vegetation  on the highest parts of the marsh. They lay three eggs of a greenish  gray color marked with dark brown and lilac. Size 1.75 x 1.25.      61. ROSES GULL. _Rhodostethia rosea._    Range.--The Arctic regions, south in winter to Alaska, Greenland,  northern Europe and Asia.    This beautiful bird is the most rare of all the Gulls, being very  difficult to obtain because of its extreme northerly distribution. It is  in form and plumage like Bonaparte Gull, with the exceptions that the  head is white, there being a narrow black collar around the neck, the  tail is wedge shaped, and the whole under parts from the chin to the  tail are rosy in the breeding plumage. The nests and eggs remain still  undiscovered, although Nansen, in August 1896,"]]]
