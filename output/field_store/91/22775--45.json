Something must be conceded to  friendship. And yet we must not be entirely careless of our reputation,  nor regard the good opinion of our fellow-citizens as a weapon which we  can afford to despise in conducting the business of our life, however  lowering it may be to tout for it by flattery and smooth words. We must  by no means abjure virtue, which secures us affection.    But to return again to Scipio, the sole author of the discourse on  friendship. He used to complain that there was nothing on which men  bestowed so little pains: that every one could tell exactly how many  goats or sheep he had, but not how many friends; and while they took  pains in procuring the former, they were utterly careless in selecting  friends, and possessed no particular marks, so to speak, or tokens by  which they might judge of their suitability for friendship. Now the  qualities we ought to look out for in making our selection are firmness,  stability, constancy. There is a plentiful lack of men so endowed, and  it is difficult to form a judgment without testing. Now this testing  can only be made during the actual existence of the friendship; for  friendship so often precedes the formation of a judgment, and makes a  previous test impossible. If we are prudent then, we shall rein in our  impulse to affection as we do chariot horses. We make a preliminary  trial of horses. So we should of friendship; and should test our  friends' characters by a kind of tentative friendship. It may often  happen that the untrustworthiness of certain men is completely displayed  in a small money matter; others who are proof against a small sum are  detected if it be large. But even if some are found who think it mean  to prefer money to friendship, where shall we look for those who put  friendship before office, civil or military promotions, and political  power, and who, when the choice lies between these things on the one  side and the claims of friendship on the other, do not give a strong  preference to the former? It is not in human nature to be indifferent  to political power; and if the price men have to pay for it is the  sacrifice of friendship, they think their treason will be thrown into  the shade by the magnitude of the reward. This is why true friendship  is very difficult to find among those who engage in politics and the  contest for office. Where can you find the man to prefer his friend's  advancement to his own? And to say nothing of that, think how grievous  and almost intolerable it is to most men to share political disaster.  You will scarcely find anyone who can bring himself to do that. And  though what Ennius says is quite true,--\" the hour of need shews the  friend indeed,\"--yet it is in these two ways that most people betray  their untrustworthiness and inconstancy, by looking down on friends when  they are themselves prosperous, or deserting them in their distress. A  man, then, who has shewn a firm, unshaken, and unvarying friendship in  both these contingencies we must reckon as one of a class the rarest in  the world, and all but superhuman.    18. Now, what is the quality to look out for as a warrant for the  stability and permanence of friendship? It is loyalty. Nothing that  lacks this can be stable. We should also in making our selection look  out for simplicity, a social disposition, and a sympathetic nature,  moved by what moves us. These all contribute to maintain loyalty.  You can never trust a character which is intricate and tortuous.  Nor, indeed, is it possible for one to be trustworthy and firm who is  unsympathetic by nature and unmoved by what affects ourselves. We may  add, that he must neither take pleasure in bringing accusations against  us himself, nor believe them when they are brought. All these contribute  to form that constancy which I have been endeavouring to describe.  And the result is, what I started by saying, that friendship is only  possible between good men.    Now there are two characteristic features in his treatment of his  friends that a good (which may be regarded as equivalent to a wise) man  will always display. First, he will be entirely without any make-believe  or pretence of feeling; for the open display even of dislike is  more becoming to an ingenuous character than a studied concealment of  sentiment. Secondly, he will not only reject all accusations brought  against his friend by another, but he will not be suspicious himself  either, nor be always thinking that his friend has acted improperly.  Besides this, there should be a certain pleasantness in word and  manner which adds no little flavour to friendship. A gloomy temper and  unvarying gravity may be very impressive; but friendship should be a  little less unbending, more indulgent and gracious, and more inclined to  all kinds of good-fellowship and good-nature.    19. But here arises a question of some little difficulty. Are there any  occasions on which, assuming their worthiness, we should prefer new to  old friends, just as we prefer young to aged horses? The answer admits  of no doubt whatever. For there should be no satiety in friendship, as  there is in other things. The older the sweeter, as in wines that keep  well. And the proverb is a true one, \"You must eat many a peck of salt  with a man to be thorough friends with him.\" Novelty, indeed, has its  advantage, which we must not despise. There is always hope of fruit,  as there is in healthy blades of corn. But age too must have its proper  position; and, in fact, the influence of time and habit is very great.  To recur to the illustration of the horse which I have just now used.  Every one likes _ceteris paribus_ to use the horse to which he has been  accustomed, rather than one that is untried and new. And it is not  only in the case of a living thing that this rule holds good, but  in inanimate things also; for we like places where we have lived the  longest, even though they are mountainous and covered with forest. But  here is another golden rule in friendship: _put yourself on a level with  your friend_. For it often happens that there are certain superiorities,  as for example Scipio's in what I may call our set. Now he never assumed  any airs of superiority over Philus, or Rupilius, or Mummius, or  over friends of a lower rank still. For instance, he always shewed a  deference to his brother Quintus Maximus because he was his senior, who,  though a man no doubt of eminent character, was by no means his equal.  He used also to wish that all his friends should be the better for his  support. This is an example we should all follow. If any of us have any  advantage in personal character, intellect, or fortune, we should be  ready to make our friends sharers and partners in it with ourselves.  For instance, if their parents are in humble circumstances, if their  relations are powerful neither in intellect nor means, we should supply  their deficiencies and promote their rank and dignity. You know the  legends of children brought up as servants in ignorance of their  parentage and family. When they are recognized and discovered to be  the sons of gods or kings, they still retain their affection for the  shepherds whom they have for many years looked upon as their parents.  Much more ought this to be so in the case of real and undoubted parents.  For the advantages of genius and virtue, and in short, of every kind of  superiority, are never realized to their fullest extent until they are  bestowed upon our nearest and dearest.    20. But the converse must also be observed. For in friendship and  relationship, just as those who possess any superiority must put  themselves on an equal footing with those who are less fortunate, so  these latter must not be annoyed at being surpassed in genius, fortune,  or rank. But most people of that sort are forever either grumbling at  something, or harping on their claims; and especially if they consider  that they have services of their own to allege involving zeal and  friendship and some trouble to themselves. People who are always  bringing up their services are a nuisance. The recipient ought to  remember them; the performer should never mention them. In the case of  friends, then, as the superior are bound to descend, so are they bound  in a certain sense to raise those below them. For there are people who  make their friendship disagreeable by imagining themselves undervalued.  This generally happens only to those who think that they deserve to  be so; and they ought to be shewn by deeds as well as by words the  groundlessness of their opinion. Now the measure of your benefits should  be in the first place your own power to bestow, and in the second place  the capacity to bear them on the part of him on whom you are bestowing  affection and help. For, however great your personal prestige may be,  you cannot raise all your friends to the highest offices of the State.  For instance, Scipio was able to make Publius Rupilius consul, but not  his brother Lucius. But granting that you can give anyone anything you  choose, you must have a care that it does not prove to be beyond his  powers. As a general rule, we must wait to make up our mind about  friendships till men's characters and years have arrived at their full  strength and development. People must not, for instance, regard as fast  friends all whom in their youthful enthusiasm for hunting or football  they liked for having the same tastes. By that rule, if it were a mere  question of time, no one would have such claims on our affections as  nurses and slave-tutors. Not that they are to be neglected, but they  stand on a different ground. It is only these mature friendships that  can be permanent. For difference of character leads to difference of  aims, and the result of such diversity is to estrange friends.

It robs  them of their \"long-pig,\" human flesh, as well as their cruel, murderous  habits, and curses them (?) with virtue and the hope of \"HEAVEN.\"            ARE WE SIMPLY ANIMALS?      What is man? The materialist says, \"He is the highest order of the animal  kingdom, or an animal gifted with intelligence.\" If such be true, it may  be said with equal propriety, that animals are men without reason. Are  they? Does manhood consist in mere physical form? Can you find it in  simple physical nature? Man holds many things in his physical nature in  common with the animal; but is he, on this account, to be considered as a  mere animal? There are plants that seem to form a bridge over the chasm  lying between the vegetable and animal kingdoms. Are those plants animals  without sensation? Why not? What is the logical and scientific difference  between saying plants, which make the nearest approach to the animal are  animals without sensation, and saying animals are men without  intelligence? Let it be understood at all times, that if man is simply an  animal endowed with the gift of reason, an animal may be simply a  vegetable endowed with the gift of sensation. \"The bodies of mere animals  are clothed with scales, feathers, fur, wool or bristles, which interpose  between the skin and the elements that surround and affect the living  animal.\" All these insensible protectors \"ally animals more closely to the  nature of vegetables.\"    \"The body of a human being has a beautiful, thin, highly sensitive skin,  which is not covered with an insensitive, lifeless veil.\" Man's body is in  noble contrast with all mere animals. It is so formed that its natural  position is erect. \"The eyes are in front; the ligaments of the neck are  not capable of supporting, for any considerable length of time, the head  when hanging down; the horizontal position would force the blood to the  head so violently that stupor would be the result. The mouth serves the  mind as well as the body itself. According to the most critical  calculation, the muscles of the mouth are so movable that it may pronounce  fifteen hundred letters.\" What a wonderful musical instrument.    The mouth of the mere animal serves only physical purposes.    Man turns his head from right to left, from earth to sky, from the slimy  trail of the crustacean in the ocean's bottom to the contemplation of the  innumerable stars in the heavens. The human body was created for the mind;  its structure is correlated with mind. The animal has a sentient life; man  an intelligent, reasoning nature.    When animals are infuriated and trample beneath their feet everything that  lies in their way, we do not say they are _insane_, but _mad_. \"Man is an  intelligent spirit,\" or mind, \"served by an organism.\" We know that mind  exists by our consciousness of that which passes within us. The propriety  of the sayings of Descartes, \"_I think, therefore I am_,\" rests upon the  consciousness that we are thinking beings. This intelligence is not  obtained by the exercise of any of the senses. It does not depend upon  external surroundings. Its existence is a fact of consciousness, of  certain knowledge, and hence a fact in mental science.    We are continually conscious of the existence of the mind, which makes its  own operations the object of its own thought; that it should have no  existence is a contradiction in language.    Experience teaches us that the materialistic theory of the existence of  the mind is utterly false. In an act of perception I distinguish the pen  in my hand, and the hand itself, from my mind which perceives them. This  distinction is a fact of the faculty of perception--a particular fact of a  particular faculty. But the general fact of a general distinction of which  this is only a special case, is the distinction of the _I_ and _not I_,  which belongs to the consciousness as the general faculty. He who denies  the contrast between mind-knowing and matter-known is dishonest, for it is  a fact of consciousness, and such can not be honestly denied. The facts  given in consciousness itself can not be honestly doubted, much less  denied.    Materialists have claimed that mind is simply the result of the molecular  action of the brain. This theory is as unreal as Banquo's ghost--it will  not bear a moment's investigation. It is simply confounding the action of  the mind upon the brain with the mind itself. Every effect must have a  cause. When I make a special mental effort what is the cause lying behind  the effort? Is it the molecular action of the brain? I _will to_ make the  effort, and do it. Then will power lies behind brain action. But power is  a manifest energy; there is something lying behind it to which it belongs  as an attribute; what is it? Answer, _will_. But, where there is a _will_  there must of a necessity be that which _wills_. What is it that _wills_  to make a special mental effort--that lies away back \"behind the throne\"  and controls the helm? It is evidently the I, _myself_, the \"inner man,\"  _the spirit_. On one occasion, when some of the disciples of the Nazarene  were sleepy, Jesus said to them, \"The spirit indeed is willing, but the  flesh is weak.\" It is the spirit that _wills_ to make a special mental  effort. Here is the \"_font_\" of all our ideas. \"What man knoweth the  things of a man, save the spirit of man which is in him?\" 1 Cor., ii, 11.  _Will_, as an effect, belongs to the spirit of man, as _the cause_ lying  behind. Beyond this no man can trace this subject, short of crossing over  from the spirit of man to the invisible Father of spirits. The spirit of  man is a _wonderful intelligence_! \"The body without the spirit is dead,  being alone.\" When we analyze the physical structure back to the germ and  sperm-cells we are brought face to face with the invisible builder. Call  it what you may, it still remains the same invisible architect, which,  being matter's master, built the organism. We live, and breathe; we die,  and cease breathing. Dead bodies do not breathe. Therefore, life lies  behind breath, and spirit behind life. So life and breath are both  effects, which find their ultimate or cause in _spirit_. This at once sets  aside all that materialists have said in order to show that spirit and  breath are one and the same. The original term, translated by the term  spirit has, in its history, away back in the past, a _physical_ currency.  The old-fashioned materialist or \"soul-sleeper\" finds his fort in this  fact. His entire aim is to get the people back to an old and obsolete  currency of the term \"_pneuma_.\" If we lay aside words which were used in  a physical sense, in times gone by, we will not have many words to express  the ideas embraced in mental science. In ancient times \"_pneuma_\"  signified both mind and wind, or air. In later times it lost its physical  currency, and no longer signifies, in its general currency, breath or air.  The adjective, \"_pneumatikos_,\" is _never used_ in a physical sense. It  came into use too late.    We have many examples of old meanings passing away from words.  \"_Sapientia_,\" in Latin originally meant only the power of tasting. At  present it means _wisdom_, _prudence_, _discretion_, _discernment_, _good  sense_, _knowledge_, _practical wisdom_, _philosophy_, _calmness_,  _patience_. The word \"_sagacitas_,\" originally meant only the faculty of  _scenting_, now it means the power of seeing or perceiving anything  easily. In old literature we may read of the sagacity of dogs; keenness of  scent. But it is now sharpness of wit; keenness of perception, subtilty,  shrewdness, acuteness, penetration, ingenuity. The terms, \"attentio,\"  \"intentio,\" \"comprehensio,\" \"apprehensio,\" \"penetratio,\" and understanding  are all just so many bodily actions transferred to the expression of  _mental energies_. There is just the same reason for giving to all these  terms their old, obsolete, physical currency that there is for giving to  pneuma, or spirit, the old obsolete currency of wind or air. You must ever  remember that it is the business of lexicographers in giving the history  of words, to set before you the first as well as the latest use of terms.  In strict harmony with all this Greenfield gives \"_pneuma_\" _thus_:    1. Wind, air in motion, breathing, breath, expiration, respiration,  spirit, i. e. the human soul, that is, the vital principle in man, life.  Matthew xxvii, 50; Rev. xiii, 15.    2. Of the rational soul, mind, that principle in man which thinks, feels,  desires, and wills. Matthew v, 3, 26, 41.    3. Of the human soul after its departure from the body, a spirit, soul.  Acts xxiii, 8, 9; Hebrews xii, 23.    4. Spc. Spirit, that is, temper, disposition, affections, feelings,  inclination, qualities of mind.    5. Construed with \"_mou_\" and \"_sou_\" (_I_ and _thou_), it forms a  periphrasis for the corresponding personal pronoun. Mark ii, 8; Luke i,  47. A spirit, that is, A SIMPLE, SPIRITUAL, INCORPOREAL, INTELLIGENT  BEING. Spoken of God. John iv, 24. Of angels. Hebrews i, 14. Of evil  spirits, Matthew viii, 16; Mark ix, 20. A divine spirit, spoken of the  spiritual nature of Christ. 1 Corinthians xv, 45; 1 Peter iii, 18. Of the  Holy Spirit. Matthew iii, 16-28; John xv, 26; Acts i, 8; Romans ix, 1.    Robinson, in his Lexicon, sums up the history of its use thus:    1. Pneuma, from pneo, to breathe. A breathing, breath.    1. Of the mouth or nostrils, a breathing, blast. The destroying power of  God. Isaiah xi, 4; Psalm xxxiii, 6. The breath. Revelations xi, 11.  \"Breath of life.\" Genesis vi, 17; vii, 15-22.    2. Breath of air. Air in motion, a breeze, blast, the wind.    3. The spirit of man, that is, the vital spirit, life, soul.    4. The rational spirit, mind, soul (Latin _animus_), generally opposed to  the body or animal (disposition) spirit. 1 Thessalonians v, 23; 1  Corinthians xiv, 14.    5. It implies will, council,"]]]
