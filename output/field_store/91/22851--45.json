Encrusted with dried purple  mud and grime, their clothes deliberately torn by anti-social shrubbery,  their chins--of the males, that is--disfigured by hirsute growths, the  terrestrials made a sorry spectacle. It was hot, boiling hot, and more  humid than ever.    \"Well,\" said Miss Anspacher, letting the Swahili marching song with  which she had been attempting to encourage the company peter out, \"I do  hope we'll reach your city soon, Jrann-Pttt. I must say I could use a  hot bath.\" She added hastily, \"Hot baths are a peculiar cultural trait  of ours.\"    \"I could use one myself,\" Jrann-Pttt said. He brushed his scales  fastidiously.    \"I'm looking forward so to meeting your relatives,\" she said, grabbing  his left arm determinedly. \"I'm not violating a taboo or anything, am  I?\" _It isn't really slimy; it just feels that way._    \"Not one of my people's. But I'm afraid you are violating a terrestrial  taboo, judging from the thoughts I pick up from your captain's mind.\"    \"Oh, him--he's a stupid fool!\"    \"Not at all. Rough, perhaps. Untutored, yes. But with a good deal of  native intelligence, although fearfully primitive.\"    \"Perhaps I was too harsh,\" Miss Anspacher observed thoughtfully. _The  captain ... is good-looking in a brutal sort of way, although not nearly  as handsome or even as spiritual in appearance as Jrann-Pttt. And  sometimes I almost think he_--she blushed to herself--_shows a certain  partiality for my company._    She did not, however, let go of the saurian's arm when the captain  bustled up, prepared to put a stop to this, but tactfully, if possible,  for he had begun to realize that his rude ways did not endear him to  her.    \"Ah--we're making very good progress, aren't we, Pitt?\" he interrupted,  trying to insinuate himself between the two.    \"Excellent.\"    \"How soon do you think we'll be at your city at this rate?\"    Jrann-Pttt shrugged. \"Since I have no way of telling what our rate is or  how far we have gone, how can I tell? As a matter of fact, you might as  well learn now as later--I am not a Venusian. There is no intelligent  life native to Venus.\"    \"Oh, really!\" the vine interposed indignantly. \"Saying a thing like that  right in front of me! What would you call me, then, pray tell?\"    Jrann-Pttt kept his actual thoughts to himself. \"A mutation,\" he said.  \"Probably you are the first intelligent life-form to appear upon this  planet. Scholarly volumes will be written about you.\"    \"Oh?\" The vine seemed to be appeased. \"I accept your apology. Perhaps  I'll learn to write and do the books myself, because I'm the only one  who can understand the real me.\"    \"But how can you show us the way to your city if you're not native to  Venus?\" Bernardi demanded, whirling fretfully upon the saurian. \"What is  this, anyway? Each time you come up with a different story!\"    \"See?\" said the captain. \"Didn't I tell you he was up to no good?\"    \"I should like to lead you to our base,\" Jrann-Pttt replied with quiet  dignity. \"I am telling you the truth now since I feel I should have your  consent before proceeding farther.\"    ??????? Dfar-Lll projected.    \"I hesitated before, because I wasn't sure I could trust you. You  see, the spaceship in which we came to this planet is a prison ship,  with a crew consisting of malefactors--thieves, murderers,  defrauders--dispatched to the remote fastnesses of the Galaxy to fetch  back zoological specimens. Our zoo, I must say, is the finest and most  interesting in the Universe.\"    \"Monster!\" the mosquito-bat squeaked.    \"Shhh,\" Mortland admonished. \"Don't interrupt.\"    \"I was in command of our ill-fated expedition....\"    _Oh_, Dfar-Lll projected. _For a moment there, sir, you had me worried._    \"When we reached Venus, I was, I must admit, careless. I gave the crew a  chance to mutiny and they did. Slew most of the officers. Dfar-Lll and I  were lucky to escape with our lives.\"    \"But you might have told us!\" Mrs. Bernardi's voice held reproach.    \"Until we knew what kind of beings you were, we couldn't let you know  how helpless and unprotected we were.\"    The women seemed moved, but not the men.    \"Leading us on a wild goose chase, were you?\" the captain challenged.    Jrann-Pttt drew a deep breath. \"It was my hope that all of you would  consent to help us get our ship back from these criminals. Then we could  fly to my planet--which is the fifth of the star you know as Alpha  Centauri--where, I assure you, you would be hospitably received.\"    _We aren't really going back home, Jrann-Pttt, are we? I'd sooner stay  here in the swamp than go back to that jail._    _Have confidence in me, r-Lll. As soon as we have disposed of the  commandant and his officers, I can put our ship out of commission. The  terrestrials won't be able to tell what's wrong. They know nothing about  space travel. The fact that they got their crude vessel to operate was  probably sheer luck._    But the younger was not to be diverted. _Will we kill them after we've  disposed of our officers? I should hate to._    _Certainly not. We shall need servants and I don't trust the prisoners  in the ship--all criminals of the lowest type!_ Aloud, he said to the  bewildered terrestrials, \"If you don't want to help us, I shall  understand. No sense your interfering in another species' quarrels,  particularly as we must seem like monsters to you.\"    \"Monster!\" the mosquito-bat agreed. \"Monster, monster, monster!\" No one  tried to stop him. Jrann-Pttt sensed that somehow he had lost a good  deal of his grip on the terrestrials. Finesse, he thought angrily, was  wasted on these barbaric life-forms.    Bernardi sighed. \"I suppose we'll have to help you.\" _No reason why his  ship shouldn't stop off at Earth before it goes to Alpha Centauri. No  reason why it should even go to Alpha Centauri at all, in fact._    \"If you ask me,\" the captain said, \"he's one of the criminals himself.\"    \"But nobody asked you,\" Miss Anspacher retorted, the more acidly because  she had been wondering the same thing. \"Shall we resume our journey?\"    \"Hold on,\" the vine said. \"I don't want to intrude or anything, but it  hasn't been made quite clear to me whether or not I'm included in the  invitation to this Alpha Centauri place, and I wouldn't want to keep  going only on the off-chance that you might ask me. I really think you  should, because you led me astray with your fair promises of glittering  cities.\"    \"The cities of our planet do not glitter,\" Jrann-Pttt replied, wishing  it would wither instantly, \"but certainly you are invited. Glad to have  you.\"    \"Oh, that's awfully decent of you,\" the vine said emotionally. \"I shan't  forget it, I promise you.\"           *       *       *       *       *    They plodded onward, the vine chattering so incessantly that a faint  gurgling which accompanied them went unnoticed. The gurgling grew louder  and louder as they pushed on. Finally, \"I keep hearing water,\" Mortland  remarked. \"We must be approaching a river of some kind.\"    A few minutes later, bursting through a screen of underbrush, they found  themselves confronted by a river whose bubbling violet-blue waters  extended for at least four kilometers from shadowy bank to bank, with  the ridge tapering to a point almost in its exact center.    Apparently, while they had been trekking along the elevation, the  surrounding terrain, concealed from them by the dense and evil-minded  vegetation, had imperceptibly taken off, leaving the ridge to become a  peninsula that jutted out into the river. They seemed to be stranded.  All they could do was retrace their steps and, since they had no idea  how far back the split became part of the mainland again, the return  journey might last almost as long as it had taken them to get there.    \"I know we're heading in the right direction,\" Jrann-Pttt defended  himself. \"I wasn't aware of the river because we must have come by an  overland route.\" Although he was telling the truth, at least insofar as  he knew it himself, no one, not even Dfar-Lll, believed him.    \"But let's rest a bit before we turn back,\" Mortland proposed, flopping  to the ground. \"I'm utterly used up.\"    \"Maybe we don't need to go back,\" the vine said. \"Not all the way,  anyhow.\" Everyone stared. It waved its leaves brightly at them. \"I  notice the captain thoughtfully brought along lots of rope and there  were scads of fallen logs just a bit back. Couldn't you just lash the  logs together with the rope and make a--a thing on which we could float  the rest of the way? On the water, you know.\"    The others continued to look at it open-mouthed.    \"Just a little idea I had,\" it said modestly. \"May not amount to much,  but then you can't tell until you've tried, can you?\"    \"It--he--means a raft, I think,\" Mrs. Bernardi said.    Jrann-Pttt probed the raft concept in her mind, for he found the  vegetable's mental processes curiously obscure. \"What an excellent  idea!\" he exclaimed.    \"It does not seem infeasible,\" Professor Bernardi admitted tightly. By  now, he was suspicious of everyone and everything. _If I had never  broached the idea of space travel to those peasants_, he thought, _I  would be on Earth in the dubious comfort of my own home. That's what  comes of trying to help humanity._           *       *       *       *       *    \"Well,\" observed the captain as the heavy raft hit the water with a  tremendous splash, \"she seems to be riverworthy.\" He rubbed his hands in  anticipation, much of his surliness gone, now that he was about to deal  with something he understood. \"Since she is, in a manner of speaking, a  ship, I suppose I assume command again?\" He waited for "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31751"],[0,"What Bird is That?

It feeds chiefly on small birds.      SPARROW HAWK    _Falco sparverius sparverius. Case 1, Figs. 7, 8; Case 3, Figs. 5, 6_              The male has the tail with only one bar; the            breast unmarked; the abdomen with black spots;            while the female has the tail with several bars,            the underparts streaked with brownish. In both            sexes the bright reddish brown of the upperparts,            black markings about the head, and small size are            gold field characters. L. 10.              _Range._ Sparrow Hawks are found throughout the            greater part of the Western Hemisphere. Our            eastern race inhabits the region east of the            Rockies and is migratory at the northern limit of            its range. Southern Florida specimens are slightly            smaller and darker and are known as the Florida            Sparrow Hawk (_F. s. paulus_).

The Sparrow Hawk is one of our commonest and most familiar Hawks. He is  a handsome little Falcon, and though his prey is chiefly humble  grasshoppers, he captures them in a sportsmanlike manner by \"waiting on\"  or hovering on rapidly beating wings over his game and dropping on it  with deadly aim. His call is a high, rapidly repeated _Killy-killy-killy_.  The three to seven eggs, finely marked with reddish brown, are laid in a  hollow limb or similar situation in April.      AUDUBON'S CARACARA    _Polyborus cheriway cheriway_              A falcon-like Vulture with a bare face, black cap,            white throat, breast and nape; the rest of the            plumage is black, the tail barred with white. L.            22.              _Range._ Mexican border and southward; south            central Florida.    In the eastern United States the Caracara is found only in the Kissimmee  prairie region of southern Florida where its presence, so far from  others of its kind, furnishes one of the problems in distribution which  stimulate the imagination of the faunal naturalist.          OSPREYS. FAMILY PANDIONIDAE      OSPREY    _Pandion haliaetus carolinensis. Case 3, Fig. 14_              The Osprey or Fish Hawk is often miscalled            'Eagle,' but it is a smaller bird with white,            instead of blackish underparts. L. 23.              _Range._ The Osprey is found throughout the            greater part of the world; the American form            occurs in both North and South America and winters            from the southern United States southward,            starting northward in March.

Ohio, rare S.R., Apl.            20-Oct. Glen Ellyn, two records, May and Sept.    The Osprey, or Fish Hawk, feeds on fish and nothing but fish. He is,  therefore, never found far from his fishing grounds, where no one who  has seen him plunge for his prey and rise with it from the water will  doubt his ability to supply his wants. Ospreys usually nest in trees at  varying distances from the ground, but sometimes on cliffs or even on  the ground itself, and return year after year to the same nest. The  Osprey's alarm note is a high, loud, complaining whistle, frequently  repeated. The eggs are laid in late April and early May. They are  usually four in number, buffy white, heavily marked with chocolate.          BARN OWLS. FAMILY ALUCONIDAE      BARN OWL    _Aluco pratincola pratincola. Case 3, Fig. 17_              A light-colored Owl, looking almost white in the            dusk. L. 18.              _Range._ Barn Owls are found throughout the world.            Our species is rare north of New Jersey and Ohio.            It is migratory only at the northern limit of its            range.              Washington, not rare P.R. Ossining, A.V.    This is the 'Monkey-faced Owl' of towers and steeples. Few who hear its  loud, sudden scream or rapidly repeated _crree-crree-crree_ know their  author, who may live for years in the heart of a village a stranger to  its human inhabitants. The mice, however, have tragic evidence of his  presence in the nightly raids he makes upon their ranks. The nest is  made in the diurnal retreat, 5-9 white eggs being laid in April.          HORNED OWLS, HOOT OWLS, ETC. FAMILY STRIGIDAE      LONG-EARED OWL    _Asio wilsonianus. Case 1, Fig. 17_              Distinguished by very long ear-tufts. L. 14-3/4.              _Range._ Temperate North America. Winters south to            Georgia and Louisiana.              Washington, common P.R. Ossining, common P.R.            Cambridge, rare, P.R. but sometimes common in fall            and winter. N. Ohio, uncommon P.R. Glen Ellyn,            rare, fall records only, Nov. 7-Dec. 14.    An Owl of evergreen clumps and dense growths, where its presence is  often betrayed by the litter below of undigested pellets of hair and  bones which Owls eject at the mouth. It is not a \"hoot\" Owl, and even  many ornithologists have not heard its notes, which are described as a  \"soft-toned, slow _wu-hunk, wu-hunk_, and a low twittering, whistling  _dicky, dicky, dicky_.\" It is not a hole-inhabiting Owl and like the  Great Horned nests in an old Hawk, Crow, or Squirrel nest. Three to six  white eggs are laid in April.      SHORT-EARED OWL    _Asio flammeus. Case 1, Fig. 18_              The 'ears' are barely evident, the eyes are            yellow; underparts streaked. L. 15-1/2.              _Range._ Found throughout the greater part of the            world; migrating southward at the northern part of            its North American range.              Washington, common W.V. Ossining, casual.            Cambridge, T.V., Mch. 15-Apl. 15, rare; Oct.-Nov.,            uncommon. N. Ohio, uncommon P.R. Glen Ellyn, rare,            Dec. 11-May 15. SE. Minn., common S.R.    This is a marsh Owl and we are therefore not likely to find it  associated with other members of its family. Its notes are said to  resemble the _ki-yi_ of a small dog. Four to seven white eggs are laid  in an open nest in the grasses in April.      BARRED OWL    _Strix varia varia. Case 1, Fig. 15_              A large Owl with black eyes (the figure is            incorrect) and no 'ears.' L. 20.              _Range._ Eastern North America. Generally a            Permanent Resident. The Florida Barred Owl (_S. v.            alleni_, Case 3, Fig. 16), is somewhat darker than            the northern form and has nearly naked toes. It            inhabits Florida and the coast region from South            Carolina to Texas.              Washington, not common, rare P.R. Ossining, rare            P.R. Cambridge, P.R., sometimes common in Nov. and            Dec. N. Ohio, common P.R. Glen Ellyn, rare and            local P.R. SE. Minn., common P.R.    An Owl of the woods, common in the less thickly settled parts of its  range. Its loud, sonorous notes, _whoo, whoo-whoo who-whoo, to-whoo-ah_,  are often uttered. When two birds come together their united calls  produce some of the most startling sounds to be heard in nature. The  Barred Owl feeds chiefly on mice. It nests in hollow trees in March,  laying 2-4 white eggs.      GREAT GRAY OWL    _Scotiaplex nebulosa nebulosa_              Largest of American Owls, with a general            resemblance to the Barred Owl, but nearly a third            larger and with yellow eyes. L. 27.              _Range._ Northern North America, rarely straggling            to United States in winter.              Cambridge, very rare and irregular W.V. SE. Minn.,            rare W.V.      RICHARDSON'S OWL    _Cryptoglaux funerea richardsoni_              A small Owl about the size of a Screech Owl, but            without ear-tufts. It is grayish brown above and            both head and back are spotted with black; the            underparts are white heavily streaked with grayish            brown.              _Range._ Northern Canada and Alaska, rarely            visiting the eastern United States in winter. We            are not likely to meet this Owl.              Cambridge, very rare W.V.      SAW-WHET OWL    _Cryptoglaux acadica acadica. Case 2, Fig. 41_              Smallest of our Owls; eyes yellow, no ear-tufts.            L. 8.              _Range._ Nests in the northern United States and            northward, south in the Alleghanies to Maryland;            winters rather rarely and irregularly southward to            Virginia.              Washington, rare W.V., Oct.-Mch. Ossining, rather            rare W.V., Oct. 28-Jan. 13. Cambridge, not            uncommon, W.V., Nov.-Mch. N. Ohio, rare P.R. SE.            Minn., uncommon. P.R.    A tame little Owl which sometimes may be caught in one's hand. It passes  the day in dense growth, usually evergreens. Its note resembles the  \"sound made when a large-tooth saw is being filed.\"      SCREECH OWL    _Otus asio asio. Case 1, Figs. 13, 14_              The two sexes are alike, the two color phases            being individual and representing dichromatism.            Among animals, gray and black squirrels furnish a            similar case. The ear-like feather-tufts give the            bird a cat-like appearance, hence the name 'Cat            Owl.'
