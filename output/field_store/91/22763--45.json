While the number of organisms here introduced is at all times large, the  character of the species is of even greater import. Derived primarily  from dirt and fecal matter, it is no wonder that such forms are able to  produce very undesirable fermentative changes.    ~Influence of milker.~ The condition of the milker is not to be ignored in  determining all possible factors of infection, for when clothed in the  dust-laden garments that have been worn all day, a favorable opportunity  for direct contamination is possible. The filthy practice of wetting the  hands with milk just before milking is to be condemned. The milker's  hands should be washed immediately before milking in clean water and  dried. A pinch of vaseline on hands is sometimes used to obtain a firmer  grasp and prevents the ready dislodgment of scales.[25] It must also be  borne in mind that the milker may spread disease through the milk. In  typhoid fever and diphtheria, the germs often remain in the system for  weeks and thus make infection possible. Stocking[26] has shown that the  individual milker exerts a potent influence on the total germ content of  milk, even where the procedure is quite the same. In sanitary dairies  milkers are usually clad in white duck suits.    ~Milking by machinery.~ Several mechanical devices have been invented for  milking, some of which have been tested bacteriologically as to their  efficiency. Harrison[27] has examined the \"Thistle\" machine but found a  much higher germ content than with hand-drawn milk. The recent  introduction of the Burrel-Lawrence-Kennedy machine has led to numerous  tests in which very satisfactory results have been obtained. If the  rubber parts of the milker are thoroughly cleaned and kept in lime water  solution, they remain nearly sterile. When milk is properly handled, the  germ content may be greatly reduced.    ~Reduction in dirt and adherent bacteria.~ No factor of contamination is  so susceptible of improvement as that which relates to the reduction in  filth and dirt which gains access during and immediately subsequent to  the milking. The care which is taken to keep the coat of the animal  clean by grooming lessens very much the grosser portion of such  contamination, but with a dry, hairy coat, fine scales and dust  particles must of necessity be dislodged.[28] Ordinarily the patron  thinks all evidence of such dirt is removed if the milk is strained, but  this process only lessens the difficulty; it does not overcome it.  Various methods are in use, the effectiveness of which is subject to  considerable variation. Some of these look to the elimination of the  bacteria after they are once introduced into the milk; others to the  prevention of infection in the first place.    _1. Straining the milk._ Most of the visible, solid particles of filth,  such as hairs, dirt particles, etc., can be removed by simple straining,  the time-honored process of purification. As ordinarily carried out,  this process often contributes to instead of diminishing the germ life  in milk. The strainer cloths unless washed and thoroughly sterilized by  boiling harbor multitudes of organisms from day to day and may thus  actually add to the organisms present. Various methods have been  suggested for this simple process, but the most practical and efficient  strainer is that made of fine wire gauze to which is added 3-4 layers of  cheese cloth, the whole to set over the storage milk can.    _2. Filtration._ In Europe especially, the system of cleaning milk by  filtration through sand, gravel and other substances has been quite  extensively used. These filters are built in sections and the milk  passes from below upward. The filtering substance is washed in hot water  immediately after use and then steamed and finally baked. While it is  possible to remove the solid impurities in this way, the germ content  cannot be greatly reduced.[29] Cellulose filters have also been  suggested[30] as an improvement over the sand filters. Methods of  filtration of this character have not been used under commercial  conditions here in this country.    _3. Clarification in separator._ Within recent years the custom has  grown of clarifying milk or removing the visible dirt by passing the  milk through a centrifugal separator the cream and skim milk being  remixed after separation. This process naturally removes the solid  impurities as dirt, hairs, epithelial scales and cells, also some of the  casein, making what is known as centrifuge slime. This conglomerate mass  is incomparably rich in germ life and the natural inference would be  that the bacterial content of the milk would be greatly reduced by this  procedure. Eckles and Barnes[31] noted a reduction of 37 to 56 per cent.  of the bacteria but others have failed to observe such reductions.[32]  This condition is explained by the more thorough breaking up of the  bacterial masses in the process, thus apparently not reducing them in  numbers.    It is somewhat surprising that in spite of the elimination of much  organic matter and bacteria, such clarified milk sours as rapidly as the  untreated product.[33]    The mechanical shock of separation ruptures the clusters of fat globules  and so delays creaming and also lessens the consistency of cream derived  from such milk. This practical disadvantage together with the increased  expense of the operation and the failure to materially enhance the  keeping quality of the product outweigh the advantage which might come  from removal of solid impurities which can be largely accomplished on  the farm by efficient straining.    _4. Washing the udder._ If a surface is moist, bacteria adherent to it  cannot be dislodged by ordinary movements. Thus the air over  snow-covered mountains or oceans is relatively devoid of germ life. The  method of moistening the udder is applied with success to the hairy coat  of the animal thus subserving the double purpose of cleaning the animal  and preventing in large measure the continual dislodgment of dust  particles. After these parts have been well carded to remove loose hairs  and dirt particles, the skin should be thoroughly moistened with clean  water and then wiped. It has been urged that this procedure lessens the  yield of milk but Eckles[34] concludes from experiments that when the  animal becomes accustomed to this treatment, no noticeable change in  amount of milk or butter-fat is produced.    The effectiveness of this method in reducing the actual amount of dirt  and filth introduced into the milk as well as the great diminution in  germ life is shown by the instructive experiments of Fraser[35] who  found that the actual amount of dirt dislodged from udders of apparently  clean animals during the milking process was three and one-half times as  much as when the cow's udders were washed. From udders visibly polluted  one ounce of such filth was removed in 275 pounds of milk, while from  cows whose udders had been washed, the same amount of dirt was  distributed through 24,030 pounds.    Fraser observed as a result of 420 examinations that the average germ  content of 4-inch culture dishes under clean but unwashed udders was  578, while under washed animals it was reduced to 192. From numerous  tests made in the writer's laboratory, it is evident that the germ  content of the milk in the pail is increased from 20,000-40,000 bacteria  _per minute_ during the milking period. By far the larger part of this  pollution can be easily prevented by cleaning and dampening the udder.    _5. Diminishing exposed surface of pail._ The entrance of organisms into  the milk can be greatly reduced by lessening the area of the milk pail  directly exposed to the dust shower. A number of so-called sanitary or  hygienic milk pails have been devised for this purpose. In one case the  pail is smaller at the top than bottom, but in most of them the common  form is kept and the exposed area is lessened by means of a cover, the  milk being received through a narrower opening. In some cases, strainers  are also interposed so as to remove more effectually the coarse  particles. It is necessary to have these covers and strainers  constructed in such a way so they can be easily removed and cleaned.    [Illustration: FIG. 10. Sanitary milk pails designed to diminish the  introduction of hairs, scales, dirt, etc., into milk.]    Stocking tested one of these pails (A, Fig. 10) and found that 63 per  cent of the dirt and 29 per cent. of the bacteria were prevented from  passing into the milk. Eckles examined one in which the germ content was  found to be 3200 per cc. as against 43200 per cc. in a common open  pail. This milk did not sour until it was 64 hours old in the first case  while in the latter it curdled in 43 hours.    ~Air in barn.~ The atmosphere of the barn where the milking is done may  frequently contribute considerable infection. Germ life is incapable of  development in the air, but in a dried condition, organisms may retain  their vitality for long periods. Anything which contributes to the  production of dust in the stable and aids in the stirring up of the same  increases the number of organisms to be found in the air (Fig. 11).  Thus, the feeding of dry fodder and the bedding of animals with straw  adds greatly to the germ life floating in the air. Dust may vary much in  its germ content depending upon its origin. Fraser found the dust from  corn meal to contain only about one-sixth to one-eighth as much germ  life as that from hay or bran.[36] In time most of these dust particles  settle to the floor, but where the herd is kept in the barn, the  constant movement of the animals keeps these particles more or less in  motion. Much can be done by forethought to lessen the germ content of  stables. Feeding dry feed should not be done until after milking.[37]"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27785"],[0,"A Book About Lawyers (#7)"],[1,"view of Holborn Fields. Notwithstanding many  gloomy predictions of the evils that would necessarily follow from  over-building, London steadily increased, and enterprising architects  deprived Lincoln's Inn Fields and Great Queen Street of their rural  qualities. Crossing Holborn, the lawyers settled on a virgin plain  beyond the ugly houses which had sprung up on the north of Great Queen  Street, and on the country side of Holborn. Speedily a new quarter  arose, extending from Gray's Inn on the east to Southampton Row on the  West, and lying between Holborn and the line of Ormond Street, Red Lion  Street, Bedford Row, Great Ormond Street, Little Ormond Street, Great  James Street, and Little James Street were amongst its best  thoroughfares; in its centre was Red Lion Square, and in its  northwestern corner lay Queen's Square. Steadily enlarging its  boundaries, it comprised at later dates Guildford Street, John's Street,  Doughty Street, Mecklenburgh Square, Brunswick Square, Bloomsbury  Square, Russell Square, Bedford Square--indeed, all the region lying  between Gray's Inn Lane (on the east), Tottenham Court Road (on the  west), Holborn (on the south), and a line running along the north of the  Foundling Hospital and 'the squares.' Of course this large residential  district was more than the lawyers required for themselves. It became  and long remained a favorite quarter with merchants, physicians,[2] and  surgeons; and until a recent date it comprised the mansions of many  leading members of the aristocracy. But from its first commencement it  was so intimately associated with the legal profession that it was often  called the 'law quarter;' and the writer of this page has often heard  elderly ladies and gentlemen speak of it as the 'old law quarter.'    Although lawyers were the earliest householders in this new quarter, its  chief architect encountered at first strong opposition from a section of  the legal profession. Anxious to preserve the rural character of their  neighborhood, the gentlemen of Gray's Inn were greatly displeased with  the proposal to lay out Holborn Fields in streets and squares. Under  date June 10, 1684, Narcissus Luttrell wrote in his diary--\"Dr.  Barebone, the great builder, having some time since bought the Red Lyon  Fields, near Graie's Inn walks, to build on, and having for that purpose  employed severall workmen to goe on with the same, the gentlemen of  Graie's Inn took notice of it, and, thinking it an injury to them, went  with a considerable body of 100 persons; upon which the workmen  assaulted the gentlemen, and flung bricks at them, and the gentlemen at  them again. So a sharp engagement ensued, but the gentlemen routed them  at last, and brought away one or two of the workmen to Graie's Inn; in  this skirmish one or two of the gentlemen and servants of the house were  hurt, and severall of the workmen.\"    James Ralph's remarks on the principal localities of this district are  interesting. \"Bedford Row,\" he says, \"is one of the most noble streets  that London has to boast of, and yet there is not one house in it which  deserves the least attention.\" He tells us that \"Ormond Street is  another place of pleasure, and that side of it next the Fields is,  beyond question, one of the most charming situations about town.\" This  'place of pleasure' is now given up for the most part to hospitals and  other charitable institutions, and to lodging-houses of an inferior  sort. Passing on to Bloomsbury Square, and speaking of the Duke of  Bedford's residence, which stood on the North side of the square, he  says, \"Then behind it has the advantage of most agreeable gardens, and a  view of the country, which would make a retreat from the town almost  unnecessary, besides the opportunity of exhibiting another prospect of  the building, which would enrich the landscape and challenge new  approbation.\" This was written in 1736. At that time the years of two  generations were appointed to pass away ere the removal of Bedford House  should make way for Lower Bedford Place, leading into Russell Square.    So late as the opening years of George III.'s reign, Queen's Square  enjoyed an unbroken prospect in the direction of Highgate and Hampstead.  'The Foreigner's Guide: or a Necessary and Instructive Companion both to  the Foreigner and Native, in their Tours through the Cities of London  and Westminster' (1763), contains the following passage:--\"Queen's  Square, which is pleasantly situated at the extreme part of the town,  has a fine open view of the country, and is handsomely built, as are  likewise the neighboring streets--viz., Southampton Row, Ormond Street,  &c. In this last is Powis House, so named from the Marquis of Powis, who  built the present stately structure in the year 1713. It is now the town  residence of the Earl of Hardwicke, late Lord Chancellor. The  apartments are noble, and the whole edifice is commendable for its  situation, and the fine prospect of the country. Not far from thence is  Bloomsbury Square. This square is commendable for its situation and  largeness. On the North side is the house of the Duke of Bedford. This  building was erected from a design of Inigo Jones, and is very elegant  and spacious.\" From the duke's house in Bloomsbury Square and his  surrounding property, the political party, of which he was the Chief,  obtained the nickname of the Bloomsbury Gang.    Chief Justice Holt died March 5, 1710, at his house[3] in Bedford Row.  In Red Lion Square Chief Justice Raymond had the town mansion wherein he  died on April 15, 1733; twelve years after Sir John Pratt, Lord Camden's  father, died at his house in Ormond Street. On December 15, 1761, Chief  Justice Willes died at his house in Bloomsbury Square. Chagrin at  missing the seals through his own arrogance, when they had been actually  offered to him, was supposed to be a principal cause of the Chief  Justice's death. His friends represented that he died of a broken heart;  to which assertion flippant enemies responded that no man ever had a  heart after living seventy-four years. Murray for many years inhabited a  handsome house in Lincoln's Inn Fields; but his name is more generally  associated with Bloomsbury Square, where stood the house which was  sacked and burnt by the Gordon rioters. In Bloomsbury Square our  grandfathers used to lounge, watching the house of Edward Law,  subsequently Lord Ellenborough, in the hope of seeing Mrs. Law, as she  watered the flowers of her balcony. Mrs. Law's maiden name was Towry,  and, as a beauty, she remained for years the rage of London. Even at  this date there remain a few aged gentlemen whose eyes sparkle and whose  checks flush when they recall the charms of the lovely creature who  became the wife of ungainly Edward Law, after refusing him on three  separate occasions.    On becoming Lord Ellenborough and Chief Justice, Edward Law moved to a  great mansion in St. James's Square, the size of which he described to a  friend by saying: \"Sir, if you let off a piece of ordnance in the hall,  the report is not heard in the bedrooms.\" In this house the Chief  Justice expired, on December 13, 1818. Speaking of Lord Ellenborough's  residence in St. James's Square, Lord Campbell says: \"This was the first  instance of a common law judge moving to the 'West End.' Hitherto all  the common law judges had lived within a radius of half a mile from  Lincoln's Inn; but they are now spread over the Regent's Park, Hyde Park  Gardens, and Kensington Gore.\"    Lord Harwicke and Lord Thurlow have been more than once mentioned as  inhabitants of Ormond Street.    Eldon's residences may be noticed with advantage in this place. On  leaving Oxford and settling in London, he took a small house for himself  and Mrs. Scott in Cursitor Street, Chancery Lane. About this dwelling he  wrote to his brother Henry:--\"I have got a house barely sufficient to  hold my small family, which (so great is the demand for them here) will,  in rent and taxes, cost me annually six pounds.\" To this house he used  to point in the days of his prosperity, and, in allusion to the poverty  which he never experienced, he would add, \"There was my first perch.  Many a time have I run down from Cursitor Street to Fleet Market and  bought sixpenn'orth of sprats for our supper.\" After leaving Cursitor  Street, he lived in Carey Street, Lincoln's Inn Fields, where also, in  his later years, he believed himself to have endured such want of money  that he and his wife were glad to fill themselves with sprats. When he  fixed this anecdote upon Carey Street, the old Chancellor used to  represent himself as buying the sprats in Clare Market instead of Fleet  Market. After some successful years he moved his household from the  vicinity of Lincoln's Inn, and took a house in the law quarter,  selecting one of the roomy houses (No. 42) of Gower Street, where he  lived when as Attorney General he conducted the futile prosecutions of  Hardy, Horne Tooke, and Thelwall, in 1794.    On quitting Gower Street, Eldon took the house in Bedford Square, which  witnessed so many strange scenes during his tenure of the seals, and  also during his brief exclusion from office. In Bedford Square he played  the part of chivalric protector to the Princess of Wales, and chuckled  over the proof-sheets of that mysterious 'book' by the publication of  which the injured wife and the lawyer hoped to take vengeance on their  common enemy. There the Chancellor, feeling it well to protract his  flirtation with the Princess of Wales, entertained her in the June of  1808, with a grand banquet, from which Lady Eldon was compelled by  indisposition to be absent. And there, four years later, when he was  satisfied that her Royal Highness's good opinion could be of no service  to him, the crafty, self-seeking minister gave a still more splendid  dinner to the husband whose vices he had professed to abhor, whose  meanness of spirit he had "]]]
