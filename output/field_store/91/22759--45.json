Increased secretion of mucus  in the vagina or uterus without venereal desire or venereal infection. It  is distinguished from the fluor albus frigidus by the increased sense of  warmth in the part, and by the greater opacity or spissitude of the  material discharged; as the thinner parts are reabsorbed by the increased  action of the absorbents, along with the saline part, whence no smarting or  excoriation attends it.    M. M. Mucilage, as isinglass, hartshorn jelly, gum arabic. Ten grains of  rhubarb every night. Callico or flannel shift, opium, balsams. See Class I.  2. 3. 7.    12. _Haemorrhois alba._ White piles. An increased discharge of mucus from  the rectum frequently mistaken for matter; is said to continue a few weeks,  and recur like the bleeding piles; and to obey lunar influence. See Class  I. 2. 1. 6.    M. M. Abstinence from vinous spirit. Balsam of copaiva. Spice swallowed in  large fragments, as ten or fifteen black pepper-corns cut in half, and  taken after dinner and supper. Ward's paste, consisting of black pepper and  the powdered root of Helenium Enula.    13. _Serum e vesicatorio._ Discharge from a blister. The excretory ducts of  glands terminate in membranes, and are endued with great irritability, and  many of them with sensibility; the latter perhaps in consequence of their  facility of being excitable into great action; instances of this are the  terminations of the gall-duct in the duodenum, and of the salivary and  lachrymal glands in the mouth and eye; which produce a greater secretion of  their adapted fluids, when the ends of their excretory ducts are  stimulated.    The external skin consists of the excretory ducts of the capillaries, with  the mouths of the absorbents; when these are stimulated by the application  of cantharides, or by a slice of the fresh root of bryonia alba bound on  it, the capillary glands pour an increased quantity of fluid upon the skin  by their increased action; and the absorbent vessels imbibe a greater  quantity of the more fluid and saline part of it; whence a thick mucous or  serous fluid is deposited between the skin and cuticle.    14. _Perspiratio foetida._ Fetid perspiration. The uses of the perspirable  matter are to keep the skin soft and pliant, for the purposes of its easier  flexibility during the activity of our limbs in locomotion, and for the  preservation of the accuracy of the sense of touch, which is diffused under  the whole surface of it to guard us against the injuries of external  bodies; in the same manner as the secretion of tears is designed to  preserve the cornea of the eye moist, and in consequence transparent; yet  has this cutaneous mucus been believed by many to be an excrement; and I  know not how many fanciful theories have been built on its supposed  obstruction. Such as the origin of catarrhs, coughs, inflammations,  erysypelas, and herpes.    To all these it may be sufficient to answer, that the antient Grecians  oiled themselves all over; that some nations have painted themselves all  over, as the Picts of this island; that the Hottentots smear themselves all  over with grease. And lastly, that many of our own heads at this day are  covered with the flour of wheat and the fat of hogs, according to the  tyranny of a filthy and wasteful fashion, and all this without  inconvenience. To this must be added the strict analogy between the use of  the perspirable matter and the mucous fluids, which are poured for similar  purposes upon all the internal membranes of the body; and besides its being  in its natural state inodorous; which is not so with the other excretions  of feces, or of urine.    In some constitutions the perspirable matter of the lungs acquires a  disagreeable odour; in others the axilla, and in others the feet, emit  disgustful effluvia; like the secretions of those glands, which have been  called odoriferae; as those, which contain the castor in the beaver, and  those within the rectum of dogs, the mucus of which has been supposed to  guard them against the great costiveness, which they are liable to in hot  summers; and which has been thought to occasion canine madness, but which,  like their white excrement, is more probably owing to the deficient  secretion of bile. Whether these odoriferous particles attend the  perspirable matter in consequence of the increased action of the capillary  glands, and can properly be called excrementitous; that is, whether any  thing is eliminated, which could be hurtful if retained; or whether they  may only contain some of the essential oil of the animal; like the smell,  which adheres to one's hand on stroking the hides of some dogs; or like the  effluvia, which is left upon the ground, from the feet of men and other  creatures; and is perceptible by the nicer organs of the dogs, which hunt  them, may admit of doubt.    M. M. Wash the parts twice a day with soap and water; with lime water;  cover the feet with oiled silk socks, which must be washed night and  morning. Cover them with charcoal recently made red hot, and beaten into  fine powder and sifted, as soon as cold, and kept well corked in a bottle,  to be warned off and renewed twice a day. Internally rhubarb grains vi. or  viii. every night, so as to procure a stool or two extraordinary every day,  and thus by increasing one evacuation to decrease another. Cool dress,  diluting liquids?    15. _Crines novi._ New hairs. The black points on the faces of some people  consist of mucus, which is become viscid, and which adheres in the  excretory ducts of the glands of the skin; as described in Class I. 2. 2.  9. and which may be pressed out by the fingers, and resembles little worms.  Similar to this would seem the fabrication of silk, and of cobweb by the  silk worm and spider; which is a secreted matter pressed through holes,  which are the excretory ducts of glands. And it is probable, that the  production of hair on many parts of the body, and at different periods of  life, may be effected by a similar process; and more especially as every  hair may be considered as a slender flexible horn, and is an appendage of  the skin. See Sect. XXXIX. 3. 2. Now as there is a sensitive sympathy  between the glands, which secrete the semen, and the throat, as appears in  the mumps; see Hydrophobia, Class IV. 1. 2. 7. and Parotitis, Class IV. 1.  2. 19. The growth of the beard at puberty seems to be caused by the greater  action of the cutaneous glands about the chin and pubes in consequence of  their sympathy with those of the testes. But this does not occur to the  female sex at their time of puberty, because the sensitive sympathy in them  seems to exist between the submaxillary glands, and the pectoral ones;  which secrete the milk, and afford pleasure both by that secretion, and by  the erection of the mamulae, or nipples; and by delivering the milk into  the mouth of the child; this sensitive sympathy of the pectoral and  submaxillary glands in women is also observable in the Parotitis, or mumps,  as above referred to.    When hairs grow on the face or arms so as to be disagreeable, they may be  thus readily removed without pain or any ill consequence. Warm the ends of  a pair of nippers or forceps, and stick on them a little rosin, or burgundy  pitch; by these means each single hair may be taken fast hold of; and if it  be then plucked off slowly, it gives pain; but if plucked off suddenly, it  gives no pain at all; because the vis inertiae of the part of the skin, to  which it adheres, is not overcome; and it is not in consequence separated  from the cellular membrane under it. Some of the hairs may return, which  are thus plucked off, or others may be induced to grow near them; but in a  little time they may be thus safely destroyed; which is much to be  preferred to the methods said to be used in Turkey to eradicate hair; such  as a mixture of orpiment and quick lime; or of liver of sulphur in  solution; which injure the skin, if they are not very nicely managed; and  the hair is liable to grow again as after shaving; or to become white, if  the roots of it have been much inflamed by the causticity of the  application. See Class I. 2. 2. 11. on grey hairs.           *       *       *       *       *    ORDO I.    _Increased Irritation._    GENUS III.    _With increased Actions of the Absorbent System._    These are not attended with so great increase of heat as in the former  genus, because the fluids probably undergo less chemical change in the  glands of the absorbent system; nor are the glands of the absorbent vessels  so numerous or so extensive as those of the secerning ones. Yet that some  heat is produced by the increased action of the absorbents appears from the  greater general warmth of the skin and extremities of feeble patients after  the exhibition of the peruvian bark, and other medicines of the article  Sorbentia.    SPECIES.    1. _Lingua arida._ Dry tongue occurs in those fevers, where the expired air  is warmer than natural; and happens to all those, who sleep with their  mouths open; the currents of air in respiration increasing the evaporation.  There is also a dryness in the mouth from the increased action of the  absorbent vessels, when a sloe or a crab-apple are masticated; and after  the perforation has been much increased by eating salt or spice, or after  other copious secretions; as after drunkenness, cathartics, or fever fits,  the mucus of the mouth becomes viscid, and in small quantity, from the  increased absorption, adhering to the tongue like a white slough. In the  diabaetes, where the thirst is very great, this slough adheres more  pertinaciously, and becomes black or brown, being coloured after a few days  by our aliment or drink.

Military manpower - military age  This entry gives the minimum age at which an individual may volunteer  for military service or be subject to conscription.    Military manpower - reaching military age annually  This entry gives the number of draft-age males and females entering the  military manpower pool in any given year and is a measure of the  availability of draft-age young adults.    Military - note  This entry includes miscellaneous military information of significance  not included elsewhere.    Money figures  All money figures are expressed in contemporaneous US dollars unless  otherwise indicated.    National holiday  This entry gives the primary national day of celebration - usually  independence day.    Nationality  This entry provides the identifying terms for citizens - noun and  adjective.    Natural hazards  This entry lists potential natural disasters.    Natural resources  This entry lists a country's mineral, petroleum, hydropower, and other  resources of commercial importance.    Net migration rate  This entry includes the figure for the difference between the number of  persons entering and leaving a country during the year per 1,000  persons (based on midyear population). An excess of persons entering  the country is referred to as net immigration (e.g., 3.56  migrants/1,000 population); an excess of persons leaving the country as  net emigration (e.g., -9.26 migrants/1,000 population). The net  migration rate indicates the contribution of migration to the overall  level of population change. High levels of migration can cause problems  such as increasing unemployment and potential ethnic strife (if people  are coming in) or a reduction in the labor force, perhaps in certain  key sectors (if people are leaving).    People  This category includes the entries dealing with the characteristics of  the people and their society.    People - note  This entry includes miscellaneous demographic information of  significance not included elsewhere.    Personal Names - Capitalization  The Factbook capitalizes the surname or family name of individuals for  the convenience of our users who are faced with a world of different  cultures and naming conventions. An example would be President SADDAM  Husayn of Iraq. Saddam is his name and Husayn is his father's name. He  may be referred to as President SADDAM Husayn or President SADDAM, but  not President Husayn. The need for capitalization, bold type,  underlining, italics, or some other indicator of the individual's  surname is apparent in the following examples:  MAO Zedong, Fidel  CASTRO Ruz, George W. BUSH, and TUNKU SALAHUDDIN Abdul Aziz Shah ibni  Al-Marhum Sultan Hisammuddin Alam Shah.  By knowing the surname, a  short form without all capital letters can be used with confidence as  in President Saddam, President Castro, Chairman Mao, President Bush, or  Sultan Tunku Salahuddin.  The same system of capitalization is extended  to the names of leaders with surnames that are not commonly used such  as Queen ELIZABETH II.    Personal Names - Spelling  The romanization of personal names in the Factbook normally follows the  same transliteration system used by the US Board on Geographic Names  for spelling place names.  At times, however, a foreign leader  expressly indicates a preference for, or the media or official  documents regularly use, a romanized spelling that differs from the  transliteration derived from the US Government standard.  In such  cases, the Factbook uses the alternative spelling.    Personal Names - Titles  The Factbook capitalizes any valid title (or short form of it)  immediately preceding a person's name.  A title standing alone is  lowercased. Examples:  President PUTIN and President BUSH are chiefs of  state.  In Russia, the president is chief of state and the premier is  the head of the government, while in the US, the president is both  chief of state and head of government.    Pipelines  This entry gives the lengths and types of pipelines for transporting  products like natural gas, crude oil, or petroleum products.    Political parties and leaders  This entry includes a listing of significant political organizations  and their leaders.    Political pressure groups and leaders  This entry includes a listing of organizations with leaders involved in  politics, but not standing for legislative election.    Population  This entry gives an estimate from the US Bureau of the Census based on  statistics from population censuses, vital statistics registration  systems, or sample surveys pertaining to the recent past and on  assumptions about future trends. The total population presents one  overall measure of the potential impact of the country on the world and  within its region. Note:  starting with the 1993 Factbook, demographic  estimates for some countries (mostly African) have explicitly taken  into account the effects of the growing impact of the HIV/AIDS  epidemic.  These countries are currently: The Bahamas, Benin, Botswana,  Brazil, Burkina Faso, Burma, Burundi, Cambodia, Cameroon, Central  African Republic, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Republic of the  Congo, Cote d'Ivoire, Ethiopia, Gabon, Ghana, Guyana, Haiti, Honduras,  Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Nigeria, Rwanda, South  Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania, Thailand, Togo, Uganda, Zambia, and  Zimbabwe.    Population below poverty line  National estimates of the percentage of the population lying below the  poverty line are based on surveys of sub-groups, with the results  weighted by the number of people in each group. Definitions of poverty  vary considerably among nations. For example, rich nations generally  employ more generous standards of poverty than poor nations.    Population growth rate  The average annual percent change in the population, resulting from a  surplus (or deficit) of births over deaths and the balance of migrants  entering and leaving a country. The rate may be positive or negative.  The growth rate is a factor in determining how great a burden would be  imposed on a country by the changing needs of its people for  infrastructure (e.g., schools, hospitals, housing, roads), resources  (e.g., food, water, electricity), and jobs. Rapid population growth can  be seen as threatening by neighboring countries.    Ports and harbors  This entry lists the major ports and harbors selected on the basis of  overall importance to each country.  This is determined by evaluating a  number of factors (e.g., dollar value of goods handled, gross tonnage,  facilities, military significance).    Radio broadcast stations  This entry includes the total number of AM, FM, and shortwave broadcast  stations.    Radios  This entry gives the total number of radio receivers.    Railways  This entry includes the total route length of the railway network and  of its component parts by gauge: broad, dual, narrow, standard, and  other.    Reference maps  This section includes world, regional, and special or current interest  maps.    Religions  This entry includes a rank ordering of religions by adherents starting  with the largest group and sometimes includes the percent of total  population.    Sex ratio  This entry includes the number of males for each female in five age  groups - at birth, under 15 years, 15-64 years, 65 years and over, and  for the total population. Sex ratio at birth has recently emerged as an  indicator of certain kinds of sex discrimination in some countries. For  instance, high sex ratios at birth in some Asian countries are now  attributed to sex-selective abortion and infanticide due to a strong  preference for sons. This will affect future marriage patterns and  fertility patterns. Eventually it could cause unrest among young adult  males who are unable to find partners.    Suffrage  This entry gives the age at enfranchisement and whether the right to  vote is universal or restricted.    Telephone numbers  All telephone numbers in the Factbook consist of the country code in  brackets, the city or area code (where required) in parentheses, and  the local number. The one component that is not presented is the  international access code, which varies from country to country. For  example, an international direct dial telephone call placed from the US  to Madrid, Spain, would be as follows:         011 [34] (1) 577-xxxx, where       011 is the international access code for station-to-station calls;  01 is for calls other than station-to-station calls,       [34] is the country code for Spain,       (1) is the city code for Madrid,       577 is the local exchange, and       xxxx is the local telephone number.    An international direct dial telephone call placed from another country  to the US would be as follows:       international access code + [1] (202) 939-xxxx, where       [1] is the country code for the US,       (202) is the area code for Washington, DC,       939 is the local exchange, and       xxxx is the local telephone number.    Telephone system  This entry includes a brief characterization of the system with details  on the domestic and international components. The following terms and  abbreviations are used throughout the entry:         Africa ONE - a fiber-optic submarine cable link encircling the  continent of Africa.         Arabsat - Arab Satellite Communications Organization (Riyadh,  Saudi Arabia).         Autodin - Automatic Digital Network (US Department of Defense).         CB - citizen's band mobile radio communications.         cellular telephone system - the telephones in this system are  radio transceivers, with each instrument having its own private radio  frequency and sufficient radiated power to reach the booster station in  its area (cell), from which the"]]]
