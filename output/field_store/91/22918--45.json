The mound rises higher than the road, and its length shuts  off the view at either end, that and the line of the road, which curves  away from the lake at the north end, and runs in an almost straight  direction for some distance at the other.\"    \"I see.\" And again for a moment Ferrars consulted the sketch. Then--    \"Did you measure the distance between the target and the spot where the  body was found?\"    \"No. It was the usual distance for practice, I should think.\"    \"It was rather a long range,\" interposed Brierly. \"I am something of a  shot myself and I noticed that.\"    Again the detective pondered over the sketch.    \"By this time I dare say,\" he said presently, \"there will be any number  of curious people in the wood and about that spot.\"    \"I doubt it,\" replied Doctor Barnes. \"I thought of that, and spoke to  Doran. Mr. Brierly was so well liked by all that it only needed a word  to keep the men and boys from doing anything that might hinder a  thorough investigation. Two men are upon the road just below the  school-house to turn back the thoughtless curious ones. It was Doran's  foresight,\" added the honest physician. \"I suppose you will wish to  explore the wood near the mound?\"    Ferrars laid aside the sketch. \"As the coroner,\" he said, \"you can help  me. Of course, you can have no doubt as to the nature of the shooting.  There could be no mistake.\"    \"None. The shot at the back could not have been self-inflicted.\"    \"Then if you can rely upon your constables and this man Doran, let them  make a quiet inquiry up and down the wood road in search of any one who  may have driven over it between the hours of----\"    \"Eight and ten o'clock,\" said Hilda Grant. \"He,\" meaning her late  friend, \"left his boarding place at eight o'clock, or near it, and he  was found shortly before ten.\"    Her speech was low and hesitating, but it did not falter.    \"Thank you,\" said the detective, and turned again to the doctor.    \"Next,\" said he, \"if you can find a trusty man, who will find out for us  if any boat or boats have been seen about the lake shore during those  hours, it will be another step in the right direction. And now, you have  told me that you suspect no one; that there is no clue whatever.\" He  glanced from one to the other. \"Still we are told that very often by  those who should know best, but who were not trained to such searching.  To begin, I must know something, Mr. Brierly, about your brother and his  past. Is he your only brother?\"    \"Yes. We lost a sister ten years ago, a mere child. There were no other  children.\"    \"And--your parents?\"    \"Are both dead.\"    \"Ah! Mr. Brierly, give me, if you please, a sketch of your life and of  your brother's, dating, let us say, from the time of your father's  death.\"    If the request was unexpected or unwelcome to Robert Brierly he made no  sign, but began at once.    \"If I do not go into details sufficiently, Mr. Ferrars,\" he said, by way  of preamble, \"you will, of course, interrogate me.\"    The detective nodded, and Brierly went on.    \"My father was an Episcopalian clergyman, and, at the time of his death,  we were living in one of the wealthy suburbs of Chicago, where he had  held a charge for ten years, and where we remained for six years after  he gave up the pulpit. Being in comfortable circumstances, we found it a  most pleasant place of residence. My sister's death brought us our first  sorrow, and it was soon followed by the loss of our mother. We continued  to live, however, in the old home until my brother and I were ready to  go to college, and then my father shut up the house and went abroad with  a party of congenial friends. My father was not a business man, and the  man to whom he had confided the management of his affairs misarranged  them during his absence, to what extent we never fully knew until after  my father's death, when we found ourselves, after all was settled, with  something like fifteen thousand dollars each, and our educations. My  brother had already begun to prepare for the ministry, and I had decided  early to follow the career of a journalist.\"    \"Are you the elder?\" asked the detective.    \"Yes.\" Brierly paused for further comment, but none came, and he  resumed. \"It had been the intention of my father that my brother and I  should make the tour of the two continents when our studies were at an  end; that is, our school days. He had made this same journey in his  youth, and he had even mapped out routes for us, and told us of certain  strange and little explored places which we must not miss, such as the  rock temples of Kylas in Central India, and various wonders of Egypt. It  was a favourite project of his. 'It will leave you less money, boys,' he  used to say, 'but it will give what can never be taken from you. When a  man knows his own world, he is better fitted for the next.' And so,  after much discussion we determined to make the journey. Indeed, to  Charley it began to seem a pilgrimage, in which love, duty, and pleasure  intermingled.\"    He paused, and Hilda turned away her face as a long sighing breath  escaped his lips.    \"Shortly after our return I took up journalistic work in serious  earnest, and my brother, having been ordained, was about to accept a  charge when he met with an accident which was followed by a long  illness. When he arose from this, his physicians would not hear of his  assuming the labours of a pastor over a large and active suburban  church, and, as my brother could not bear to be altogether idle, and the  country was thought to be the place for him, it ended in his coming  here, to take charge of the little school. He was inordinately fond of  children, and a born instructor, so it seemed to me. He was pleased with  the beauty of the place and the quiet of it, from the first, and he was  not long in finding his greatest happiness here.\"    His voice sank, and he turned a face in which gratitude and sorrow  blended, upon the girl who suddenly covered her own with her trembling  hands.    But the detective, with a new look of intentness upon his face, and  without a moment's pause, asked quickly.    \"Then you have been in this place before, of course?\"    \"No, I have not. For the first three months Charley was very willing to  come to me, in the city. Then came a very busy time for me and he came  twice, somewhat reluctantly, I thought. Six months ago I was sent to  New Mexico to do some special work, and returned to the city on Tuesday  last.\" His voice broke, and he got up and walked to the window farthest  from the group.    While he had been speaking, Ferrars had scribbled aimlessly and a stroke  at a time, as it seemed, upon the margin of the printed side of the card  which bore the sketch made by Doctor Barnes; and now, while Hilda's face  was again turned away, the young man at the window still stood with his  back towards all in the room, he pushed the card from the edge of the  table, and shot a significant glance toward the doctor.    Picking up the card, Doctor Barnes glanced at it carelessly, and then  replaced it upon the table, having read these words--    \"I wish to speak with her alone. Make it a professional necessity.\"    As Brierly turned toward them once more the detective turned to the  young girl. \"I would like to hear something from you, Miss Grant, if you  find yourself equal to it.\"    Hilda set her lips in firm lines, and after a moment said steadily--    \"I am quite at your service.\"    \"One minute.\" The doctor arose and addressed himself to the detective.    \"I feel sure that it will be best for Miss Grant that she talk with you  alone. As her physician, I will caution her against putting too great a  restraint upon herself, upon her feelings. While you talk with her,  Ferrars, Mr. Brierly and I will go back to my quarters, unless you bid  us come back.\"    \"I do not,\" interposed the detective. \"I will join you soon, and if need  be, you can then return, doctor.\"    At first it seemed as if Hilda were about to remonstrate. But she caught  the look of intelligence that flashed from his eyes to hers, and she sat  in silence while Doctor Barnes explained the route to his cottage and  murmured a low good-bye, while Brierly took her hand and bent over her  with a kind adieu.    \"I may see you to-morrow,\" he whispered. \"You will let me come, sister?\"  The last word breathed close to her ear.    Her lips moved soundlessly, but he read her eager consent in her timid  return of his hand clasp and the look in her sad, grey eyes, and  followed the doctor from the room.    When Frank Ferrars had closed the door behind the two men, he wasted no  time in useless words, but, seating himself opposite the girl, and so  close that he could catch, if need be, her faintest whisper, he began,  his own tones low and touched with sympathy--    \"Miss Grant,\" he said, \"I already feel assured that you know how many  things must be considered before we can ever begin such a search as I  foresee before me. Of course it may happen that before the end of the  coroner's inquest some clue or key to the situation may have developed.  But, if I have heard all, or, rather, if there has not been some  important fact or feature overlooked, we must go behind the scenes for  our data, our hints and possible clues. Do you comprehend me?\"    Hilda Grant had drawn herself erect, and was listening intently with her  clear eyes fixed upon his face, and she seemed with her whole soul to be  studying this man, while, with her ears she took in and comprehended his  every word.    \"You mean,\" she answered slowly, \"that there may be something in himself  or some event or fact in his past, or that of his family, which has  brought about this?\" She turned away her face. She could not put the  awful fact into words.    \"I knew you would understand me, and it is not to his past alone that I  must look for help,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3533"],[0,"Sunshine Sketches of a Little Town (#7)"],[1,"leaned forward towards  the customer, and talked to him in a soft confidential monotone, like a  portrait painter, the razor would go slower and slower, and pause and  stop, move and pause again, till the shave died away into the mere  drowse of conversation.    At such hours, the Mariposa barber shop would become a very Palace of  Slumber, and as you waited your turn in one of the wooden arm-chairs  beside the wall, what with the quiet of the hour, and the low drone of  Jeff's conversation, the buzzing of the flies against the window pane  and the measured tick of the clock above the mirror, your head sank  dreaming on your breast, and the Mariposa Newspacket rustled unheeded on  the floor. It makes one drowsy just to think of it!    The conversation, of course, was the real charm of the place. You see,  Jefferson's forte, or specialty, was information. He could tell you more  things within the compass of a half-hour's shave than you get in days  of laborious research in an encyclopaedia. Where he got it all, I  don't know, but I am inclined to think it came more or less out of the  newspapers.    In the city, people never read the newspapers, not really, only little  bits and scraps of them. But in Mariposa it's different. There they read  the whole thing from cover to cover, and they build up on it, in  the course of years, a range of acquirement that would put a college  president to the blush. Anybody who has ever heard Henry Mullins and  Peter Glover talk about the future of China will know just what I mean.    And, of course, the peculiarity of Jeff's conversation was that he could  suit it to his man every time. He had a kind of divination about it.  There was a certain kind of man that Jeff would size up sideways as  he stropped the razor, and in whose ear he would whisper: \"I see where  Saint Louis has took four straight games off Chicago,\"--and so hold him  fascinated to the end.    In the same way he would say to Mr. Smith: \"I see where it says that  this 'Flying Squirl' run a dead heat for the King's Plate.\"    To a humble intellect like mine he would explain in full the relations  of the Keesar to the German Rich Dog.    But first and foremost, Jeff's specialty in the way of conversation  was finance and the money market, the huge fortunes that a man with the  right kind of head could make.    I've known Jefferson to pause in his shaving with the razor suspended  in the air as long as five minutes while he described, with his eye  half closed, exactly the kind of a head a man needed in order to make  a \"haul\" or a \"clean up.\" It was evidently simply a matter of the head,  and as far as one could judge, Jeff's own was the very type required.  I don't know just at what time or how Jefferson first began his  speculative enterprises. It was probably in him from the start. There  is no doubt that the very idea of such things as Traction Stock and  Amalgamated Asbestos went to his head: and whenever he spoke of Mr.  Carnegie and Mr. Rockefeller, the yearning tone of his voice made it as  soft as lathered soap.    I suppose the most rudimentary form of his speculation was the hens.  That was years ago. He kept them out at the back of his house,--which  itself stood up a grass plot behind and beyond the barber shop,--and in  the old days Jeff would say, with a certain note of pride in his voice,  that The Woman had sold as many as two dozen eggs in a day to the summer  visitors.    But what with reading about Amalgamated Asbestos and Consolidated Copper  and all that, the hens began to seem pretty small business, and, in  any case, the idea of two dozen eggs at a cent apiece almost makes one  blush. I suppose a good many of us have felt just as Jeff did about our  poor little earnings. Anyway, I remember Jeff telling me one day that  he could take the whole lot of the hens and sell them off and crack  the money into Chicago wheat on margin and turn it over in twenty-four  hours. He did it too. Only somehow when it was turned over it came  upside down on top of the hens.    After that the hen house stood empty and The Woman had to throw away  chicken feed every day, at a dead loss of perhaps a shave and a half.  But it made no difference to Jeff, for his mind had floated away already  on the possibilities of what he called \"displacement\" mining on the  Yukon.    So you can understand that when the mining boom struck Mariposa,  Jefferson Thorpe was in it right from the very start. Why, no wonder; it  seemed like the finger of Providence. Here was this great silver country  spread out to north of us, where people had thought there was only a  wilderness. And right at our very doors! You could see, as I saw, the  night express going north every evening; for all one knew Rockefeller or  Carnegie or anyone might be on it! Here was the wealth of Calcutta, as  the Mariposa Newspacket put it, poured out at our very feet.    So no wonder the town went wild! All day in the street you could  hear men talking of veins, and smelters and dips and deposits and  faults,--the town hummed with it like a geology class on examination  day. And there were men about the hotels with mining outfits and  theodolites and dunnage bags, and at Smith's bar they would hand chunks  of rock up and down, some of which would run as high as ten drinks to  the pound.    The fever just caught the town and ran through it! Within a fortnight  they put a partition down Robertson's Coal and Wood Office and opened  the Mariposa Mining Exchange, and just about every man on the Main  Street started buying scrip. Then presently young Fizzlechip, who had  been teller in Mullins's Bank and that everybody had thought a worthless  jackass before, came back from the Cobalt country with a fortune, and  loafed round in the Mariposa House in English khaki and a horizontal  hat, drunk all the time, and everybody holding him up as an example of  what it was possible to do if you tried.    They all went in. Jim Eliot mortgaged the inside of the drug store and  jammed it into Twin Tamagami. Pete Glover at the hardware store bought  Nippewa stock at thirteen cents and sold it to his brother at seventeen  and bought it back in less than a week at nineteen. They didn't care!  They took a chance. Judge Pepperleigh put the rest of his wife's money  into Temiskaming Common, and Lawyer Macartney got the fever, too, and  put every cent that his sister possessed into Tulip Preferred.    And even when young Fizzlechip shot himself in the back room of the  Mariposa House, Mr. Gingham buried him in a casket with silver handles  and it was felt that there was a Monte Carlo touch about the whole  thing.    They all went in--or all except Mr. Smith. You see, Mr. Smith had come  down from there, and he knew all about rocks and mining and canoes and  the north country. He knew what it was to eat flour-baked dampers under  the lee side of a canoe propped among the underbrush, and to drink the  last drop of whiskey within fifty miles. Mr. Smith had mighty little use  for the north. But what he did do, was to buy up enough early potatoes  to send fifteen carload lots into Cobalt at a profit of five dollars a  bag.    Mr. Smith, I say, hung back. But Jeff Thorpe was in the mining boom  right from the start. He bought in on the Nippewa mine even before the  interim prospectus was out. He took a \"block\" of 100 shares of  Abbitibbi Development at fourteen cents, and he and Johnson, the livery  stablekeeper next door, formed a syndicate and got a thousand shares  of Metagami Lake at 3 1/4 cents and then \"unloaded\" them on one of the  sausage men at Netley's butcher shop at a clear cent per cent advance.    Jeff would open the little drawer below the mirror in the barber  shop and show you all kinds and sorts of Cobalt country mining  certificates,--blue ones, pink ones, green ones, with outlandish and  fascinating names on them that ran clear from the Mattawa to the Hudson  Bay.    And right from the start he was confident of winning. \"There ain't no  difficulty to it,\" he said, \"there's lots of silver up there in that  country and if you buy some here and some there you can't fail to come  out somewhere. I don't say,\" he used to continue, with the scissors open  and ready to cut, \"that some of the greenhorns won't get bit. But if a  feller knows the country and keeps his head level, he can't lose.\"    Jefferson had looked at so many prospectuses and so many pictures of  mines and pine trees and smelters, that I think he'd forgotten that he'd  never been in the country. Anyway, what's two hundred miles!    To an onlooker it certainly didn't seem so simple. I never knew the  meanness, the trickery, of the mining business, the sheer obstinate  determination of the bigger capitalists not to make money when they  might, till I heard the accounts of Jeff's different mines. Take the  case of Corona Jewel. There was a good mine, simply going to ruin for  lack of common sense.    \"She ain't been developed,\" Jeff would say. \"There's silver enough in  her so you could dig it out with a shovel. She's full of it. But they  won't get at her and work her.\"    Then he'd take a look at the pink and blue certificates of the Corona  Jewel and slam the drawer on them in disgust. Worse than that was  the Silent Pine,--a clear case of stupid incompetence! Utter lack of  engineering skill was all that was keeping the Silent Pine from making a  fortune for its holders.    \"The only trouble with that mine,\" said Jeff, \"is they won't go deep  enough. They followed the vein down to where it kind o' thinned out and  then they quit. If they'd just go right into her good, they'd get it  again. She's down there all right.\"    But perhaps the meanest case of all was the Northern Star. That always  seemed to me, every time I heard of it, a straight case for the criminal  law. The thing was so evidently a conspiracy.    \"I bought her,\" said Jeff, \"at thirty-two, and she stayed right there  tight, like she was"]]]
