K Troop meantime had deployed into the valley  under the fire from the enemy on the ridge.  It had been ordered to  establish communication with General Young's column, and while advancing  and firing on the ridge, Captain Jenkins sent the guidon bearer back to  climb the hill and wave his red and white banner where Young's men could  see it.  The guidon bearer had once run for Congress on the gold ticket  in Arizona, and, as some one said, was naturally the man who should have  been selected for a forlorn hope.  His flag brought him instantly under a  heavy fire, but he continued waving it until the Tenth Cavalry on the  other side of the valley answered, and the two columns were connected by  a skirmish-line composed of K Troop and A, under Captain \"Bucky\" O'Neill.    G Troop meanwhile had hurried over to the left, and passing through the  opening in the wire fence had spread out into open order.  It followed  down after Captain Luna's troop and D and E Troops, which were well  already in advance.  Roosevelt ran forward and took command of the  extreme left of this line.  Wood was walking up and down along it,  leading his horse, which he thought might be of use in case he had to  move quickly to alter his original formation.  His plan, at present, was  to spread out his men so that they would join Young on the right, and on  the left swing around until they flanked the enemy.  K and A Troops had  already succeeded in joining hands with Young's column across the valley,  and as they were capable of taking care of themselves, Wood was bending  his efforts to keep his remaining four companies in a straight line and  revolving them around the enemy's \"end.\"  It was in no way an easy thing  to do.  The men were at times wholly hidden from each other, and from  him; probably at no one time did he see more than two of his troops  together.  It was only by the firing that he could tell where his men  lay, and that they were always advancing.    The advances were made in quick, desperate rushes--sometimes the ground  gained was no more than a man covers in sliding for a base.  At other  times half a troop would rise and race forward and then burrow deep in  the hot grass and fire.  On this side of the line there was an occasional  glimpse of the enemy.  But for a great part of the time the men shot at  the places from where the enemy's fire seemed to come, aiming low and  answering in steady volleys.  The fire discipline was excellent.  The  prophets of evil of the Tampa Bay Hotel had foretold that the cowboys  would shoot as they chose, and, in the field, would act independently of  their officers.  As it turned out, the cowboys were the very men who  waited most patiently for the officers to give the word of command.  At  all times the movement was without rest, breathless and fierce, like a  cane-rush, or a street fight.  After the first three minutes every man  had stripped as though for a wrestling match, throwing off all his  impedimenta but his cartridge-belt and canteen.  Even then the sun  handicapped their strength cruelly.  The enemy was hidden in the shade of  the jungle, while they, for every thicket they gained, had to fight in  the open, crawling through grass which was as hot as a steam bath, and  with their flesh and clothing torn by thorns and the sword-like blade of  the Spanish \"bayonet.\"  The glare of the sun was full in their eyes and  as fierce as a lime-light.    When G Troop passed on across the trail to the left I stopped at the  place where the column had first halted--it had been converted into a  dressing station and the wounded of G Troop were left there in the care  of the hospital stewards.  A tall, gaunt young man with a cross on his  arm was just coming back up the trail.  His head was bent, and by some  surgeon's trick he was carrying a wounded man much heavier than himself  across his shoulders.  As I stepped out of the trail he raised his head,  and smiled and nodded, and left me wondering where I had seen him before,  smiling in the same cheery, confident way and moving in that same  position.  I knew it could not have been under the same conditions, and  yet he was certainly associated with another time of excitement and rush  and heat.  Then I remembered him.  As now he had been covered with blood  and dirt and perspiration, but then he wore a canvas jacket and the man  he carried on his shoulders was trying to hold him back from a  white-washed line.  And I recognized the young doctor, with the blood  bathing his breeches, as \"Bob\" Church, of Princeton.  That was only one  of four badly wounded men he carried that day on his shoulders over a  half-mile of trail that stretched from the firing-line back to the  dressing station and under an unceasing fire. {3}  As the senior surgeon  was absent he had chief responsibility that day for all the wounded, and  that so few of them died is greatly due to this young man who went down  into the firing-line and pulled them from it, and bore them out of  danger.  The comic paragraphers who wrote of the members of the  Knickerbocker Club and the college swells of the Rough Riders and of  their imaginary valets and golf clubs, should, in decency, since the  fight at Guasimas apologize.  For the same spirit that once sent these  men down a white-washed field against their opponents' rush line was the  spirit that sent Church, Channing, Devereux, Ronalds, Wrenn, Cash, Bull,  Lamed, Goodrich, Greenway, Dudley Dean, and a dozen others through the  high hot grass at Guasimas, not shouting, as their friends the cowboys  did, but each with his mouth tightly shut, with his eyes on the ball, and  moving in obedience to the captain's signals.    Judging from the sound, our firing-line now seemed to be half a mile in  advance of the place where the head of the column had first halted.  This  showed that the Spaniards had been driven back at least three hundred  yards from their original position.  It was impossible to see any of our  men in the field, so I ran down the trail with the idea that it would  lead me back to the troop I had left when I had stopped at the dressing  station.  The walk down that trail presented one of the most grewsome  pictures of the war.  It narrowed as it descended; it was for that reason  the enemy had selected that part of it for the attack, and the vines and  bushes interlaced so closely above it that the sun could not come  through.    The rocks on either side were spattered with blood and the rank grass was  matted with it.  Blanket rolls, haversacks, carbines, and canteens had  been abandoned all along its length.  It looked as though a retreating  army had fled along it, rather than that one troop had fought its way  through it to the front.  Except for the clatter of the land-crabs, those  hideous orchid-colored monsters that haunt the places of the dead, and  the whistling of the bullets in the trees, the place was as silent as a  grave.  For the wounded lying along its length were as still as the dead  beside them.  The noise of the loose stones rolling under my feet brought  a hospital steward out of the brush, and he called after me:    \"Lieutenant Thomas is badly wounded in here, and we can't move him.  We  want to carry him out of the sun some place, where there is shade and a  breeze.\"  Thomas was the first lieutenant of Capron's troop.  He is a  young man, large and powerfully built.  He was shot through the leg just  below the trunk, and I found him lying on a blanket half naked and  covered with blood, and with his leg bound in tourniquets made of twigs  and pocket-handkerchiefs.  It gave one a thrill of awe and wonder to see  how these cowboy surgeons, with a stick that one would use to light a  pipe and with the gaudy 'kerchiefs they had taken from their necks, were  holding death at bay.  The young officer was in great pain and tossing  and raving wildly.  When we gathered up the corners of his blanket and  lifted him, he tried to sit upright, and cried out, \"You're taking me to  the front, aren't you?  You said you would.  They've killed my  captain--do you understand?  They've killed Captain Capron.  The ---  Mexicans!  They've killed my captain.\"    The troopers assured him they were carrying him to the firing-line, but  he was not satisfied.  We stumbled over the stones and vines, bumping his  wounded body against the ground and leaving a black streak in the grass  behind us, but it seemed to hurt us more than it did him, for he sat up  again clutching at us imploringly with his bloody hands.    \"For God's sake, take me to the front,\" he begged.  \"Do you hear?  I  order you; damn you, I order--We must give them hell; do you hear? we  must give them hell.  They've killed Capron.  They've killed my captain.\"    The loss of blood at last mercifully silenced him, and when we had  reached the trail he had fainted and I left them kneeling around him,  their grave boyish faces filled with sympathy and concern.    Only fifty feet from him and farther down the trail I passed his captain,  with his body propped against Church's knee and with his head fallen on  the surgeon's shoulder.  Capron was always a handsome, soldierly looking  man--some said that he was the most soldierly looking of any of the young  officers in the army--and as I saw him then death had given him a great  dignity and nobleness.  He was only twenty-eight years old, the age when  life has just begun, but he rested his head on the surgeon's shoulder  like a man who knew he was already through with it and that, though they  might peck and mend at the body, he had received his final orders.  His  breast and shoulders were bare, and as the surgeon cut the tunic from him  the sight of his great chest and the skin, as white as a girl's, and the  black open wound against it made the yellow stripes and the brass  insignia on the tunic,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30541"],[0,"A Treatise on Anatomy, Physiology, and Hygiene (Revised Edition) (#7)"],[1,"the arms from sliding toward the breast.    98. The SCAPULA is situated upon the upper and back part of the chest.  It is flat, thin, and of a triangular form. This bone lies upon and is  retained in its position by muscles. By their contractions it may be  moved in different directions.    99. The HUMERUS is cylindrical, and is joined at the elbow with the  ulna of the fore-arm; at the scapular extremity, it is lodged in the  _glenoid_ cavity, where it is surrounded by a membranous bag, called  the _capsular ligament_.      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=    95-104. _Give the anatomy of the bones of the upper extremities._ 95.

The ULNA articulates with the humerus at the elbow, and forms a  perfect hinge-joint. This bone is situated on the inner side of the  fore-arm.      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=    What is represented by fig. 13? By fig. 14? 100. Describe the ulna.      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=    101. The RADIUS articulates with the bones of the carpus and forms the  wrist-joint. This bone is situated on the outside of the fore-arm,  (the side on which the thumb is placed.) The ulna and radius, at their  extremities, articulate with each other, by which union the hand is  made to rotate, permitting its complicated and varied movements.    102. The CARPUS is composed of eight bones, ranged in two rows, and so  firmly bound together, as to permit only a small amount of movement.    [Illustration: Fig. 15. U, The ulna. R, The radius.

The PHALANGES of the fingers have three ranges of bones, while  the thumb has but two.    _Observation._ The wonderful adaptation of the hand to all the  mechanical offices of life, is one cause of man's superiority over the  rest of creation. This arises from the size and strength of the  thumbs, and the different lengths of the fingers.    105. The LOWER EXTREMITIES contain sixty bones--the _Fe'mur_,  (thigh-bone;) the _Pa-tel'la_, (knee-pan;) the _Tib'i-a_, (shin-bone;)  the _Fib'u-la_, (small bone of the leg;) the _Tar'sus_, (instep;) the  _Met-a-tar'sus_, (middle of the foot;) and the _Pha-lan'ges_, (toes.)    106. The FEMUR is the longest bone in the system. It supports the  weight of the head, trunk, and upper extremities. The large, round  head of this bone is placed in the acetabulum. This articulation is a  perfect specimen of the ball and socket joint.    107. The PATELLA is a small bone connected with the tibia by a strong  ligament. The tendon of the _ex-tens'or_ muscles of the leg is  attached to its upper edge. This bone is placed on the anterior part  of the lower extremity of the femur, and acts like a pulley, in the  extension of the limb.    108. The TIBIA is the largest bone of the leg. It is of a triangular  shape, and enlarged at each extremity.    109. The FIBULA is a smaller bone than the tibia, but of similar  shape. It is firmly bound to the tibia, at each extremity.    110. The TARSUS is formed of seven irregular bones, which are so  firmly bound together as to permit but little movement.      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=    104.

This  structure conduces to the elasticity of the step, and the weight of  the body is transmitted to the ground by the spring of the arch, in a  manner which prevents injury to the numerous organs.      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=    111. Describe the metatarsal bones. Explain fig. 19. What is  represented by fig. 20? What is said of the arrangement of the bones  of the foot?      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=    112. The PHALANGES (fig. 19) are composed of fourteen bones; each of  the small toes has three ranges of bones, while the great toe has but  two.    113. The JOINTS form an interesting part of the body. In their  construction, every thing shows the regard that has been paid to the  security and the facility of motion of the parts thus connected  together. They are composed of the extremities of two or more  bones, _Car'ti-lages_, (gristles,) _Syn-o'vi-al_ membrane, and  _Lig'a-ments_.    [Illustration: Fig. 21 The relative position of the bones, cartilages,  and synovial membrane. 1, 1, The extremities of two bones that concur to  form a joint. 2, 2, The cartilages that cover the end of the bones. 3, 3,  3, 3, The synovial membrane which covers the cartilage of both bones, and  is then doubled back from one to the other; it is represented by the  dotted lines.]    [Illustration: Fig. 22.

CARTILAGE is a smooth, solid, elastic substance, of a pearly  whiteness, softer than bone. It forms upon the articular surfaces of  the bones a thin incrustation, not more than the sixteenth of an inch  in thickness. Upon convex surfaces it is the thickest in the centre,  and thin toward the circumference; while upon concave surfaces, an  opposite arrangement is presented.      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=    112.
