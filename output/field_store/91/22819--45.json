It spreads far and wide in thrifty colonies, reflecting  the vivid color of June skies, until, as Thoreau says, \"the earth  is blued with it.\"    What is the advantage gained in the pea-shaped blossom? As usual,  the insect that fertilizes the flower best knows the answer. The  corolla has five petals, the upper one called the standard,  chiefly a flaunted advertisement; two side wings, or platforms,  to alight on; and a keel like a miniature boat, formed by the two  lower petals, whose edges meet. In this the pistil, stamens, and  nectar are concealed and protected. The pressure of a bee's  weight as he alights on the wings, light as it must be, is  nevertheless sufficient to depress and open the keel, which is  elastically affected by their motion, and so to expose the pollen  just where the long-lipped bee must rub off some against his  underside as he sucks the nectar. He actually seems to pump the  pollen that has fallen into the forward part of the keel upon  himself, as he moves about. As soon as he leaves the flower, the  elastic wings resume their former position, thus closing the keel  to prevent waste of pollen. Take a sweet pea from the garden,  press down its wings with the thumb and forefinger to imitate the  action of the bee on them; note how the keel opens to display its  treasures, and resumes its customary shape when the pressure is  removed.    The lupine is another of those interesting plants which go to  sleep at night. Some members of the genus erect one half of the  leaf and droop the other half until it becomes a vertical instead  of the horizontal star it is by day. Frequently the leaflets  rotate as much as 90 degrees on their own axes. Some lupines fold  their leaflets, not at night only, but during the day also there  is more or less movement in the leaves. Sun dial, a popular name  for the wild lupine, has reference to this peculiarity. The leaf  of our species shuts downward around its stem, umbrella fashion,  or the leaflets are erected to prevent the chilling which comes  to horizontal surfaces by radiation, some scientists think. \"That  the sleep movements of leaves are in some manner of high  importance to the plants which exhibit them,\" says Darwin, \"few  will dispute who have observed how complex they sometimes are.\"      CANADIAN or SHOWY TICK-TREFOIL    (Meibomia Canadensis; Desmodium Canadense of Gray)  Pea family    Flowers - Pinkish or bluish purple, butterfly-shaped, about 1/2  in. long, borne in dense, terminal, elongated racemes. Stem;  Erect, hairy, leafy, 2 to 8 ft. high. Leaves: Compounded of 3  oblong leaflets, the central one largest; upper leaves nearly  seated on stem; bracts, conspicuous before flowering, early  falling off. Fruit: A flat pod, about 1 in. long, jointed, and  covered with minute hooked bristles, the lower edge of pod  scalloped; almost seated in calyx.  Preferred Habitat - Thickets, woods, riverbanks, bogs. Flowering  Season - July-September.  Distribution - New Brunswick to Northwest Territory, south to  North Carolina, westward to Indian Territory and Dakota.    As one travels hundreds or even thousands of miles in a  comfortable railway carriage and sees the same flowers growing  throughout the length and breadth of the area, one cannot but  wonder however the plants manage to make the journey. We know  some creep along the ground, or under it, a tortoise pace, but a  winning one; that some send their offspring flying away from  home, like dandelions and thistles; and many others with wings  and darts are blown by the wind. Berries have their seeds dropped  afar by birds. Aquatic plants and those that grow beside running  water travel by river and flood. European species reach our  shores among the ballast. Darwin raised over sixty wild plants  from seed carried in a pellet of mud taken from the leg of a  partridge. So on and so on. The imagination delights to picture  these floral vagabonds, each with its own clever method of  getting a fresh start in the world. But by none of these methods  just mentioned do the tick-trefoils spread abroad. Theirs is  indeed a by hook or by crook system. The scalloped, jointed pod,  where the seeds lie concealed, has minute crooked bristles, which  catch in the clothing of man or beast, so that every herd of  sheep, every dog, every man, woman, or child who passes through a  patch of trefoils gives them a lift. After a walk through the  woods and lanes of late summer and autumn, one's clothes reveal  scores of tramps that have stolen a ride in the hope of being  picked off and dropped amid better conditions in which to rear a  family.    Only the largest bees can easily \"explode\" the showy  tick-trefoil. A bumblebee alights upon a flower, thrusts his head  under the base of the standard petal, and forces apart the wing  petals with his legs, in order to dislodge them from the  standard. This motion causes the keel, also connected with the  standard, to snap down violently, thus releasing the column  within and sending upward an explosion of pollen on the under  surface of the bee. Here we see the wing petals acting as  triggers to discharge the flower. Depress them and up flies the  fertilizing dust - once. The little gun will not \"go off\" twice.  No nectar rewards the visitor, which usually is a  pollen-collecting bee. The highly intelligent and important  bumblebee has the advantage over his smaller kin in being able to  discharge the pollen from both large and smaller flowers.    The NAKED-FLOWERED TICK-TREFOIL (M. nudiflora; D. nudiflorum of  Gray) lifts narrow, few-flowered panicles of rose-purple blooms  during July and August. The flowers are much smaller than those  of the showy trefoil; however, when seen in masses, they form  conspicuous patches of color in dry woods. Note that there is a  flower stalk which is usually leafless and also a leaf-bearing  stem rising from the base of the plant, the latter with its  leaves all crowded at the top, if you would distinguish this very  common species from its multitudinous kin. The trefoliate leaves  are pale beneath. The two or three jointed pod rises far above  the calyx on its own stalk, as in the next species.    The POINTED-LEAVED TICK-TREFOIL (M. grandifiora; D. acuminatum of  Gray) has for its distinguishing feature a cluster of leaves high  up on the same stem from which rises a stalk bearing a quantity  of purple flowers that are large by comparison only. The leaves  have leaflets from two to six inches long, rounded on the sides,  but acutely pointed, and with scattered hairs above and below.  This trefoil is found blooming in dry or rocky woods, throughout  a wide range, from June to September.    Lying outstretched for two to six feet on the dry ground of open  woods and copses east of the Mississippi, the PROSTRATE  TICK-TREFOIL (M. Michauxii; D. rotundifoliurn of Gray) can  certainly be named by its soft hairiness, the almost perfect  roundness of its trefoliate leaves, its rather loose racemes of  deep purple flowers that spring both from the leaf axils and from  the ends of the sometimes branching stem; and by its three to  five jointed pod, which is deeply scalloped on its lower edge and  somewhat indented above, as well.      BLUE, TUFTED, or COW VETCH or TARE; CAT PEAS; TINEGRASS    (Vicia Cracca)  Pea family    Flowers - Blue, later purple; 1/2 in. long, growing downward in  1-sided spike, 15 to 40 flowered; calyx oblique, small, with  unequal teeth; corolla butterfly-shaped, consisting of standard,  wings, and keel, all oblong; the first clawed, the second  oblique, and adhering to the shorter keel; 10 stamens, 1 detached  from other 9. Stem: Slender, weak, climbing or trailing, downy, 2  to 4 ft. long. Leaves: Tendril bearing, divided into 18 to 24  thin, narrow, oblong leaflets. Fruit: A smooth pod 1 in. long or  less, 5 to 8 seeded.  Preferred Habitat - Dry soil, fields, wastelands.  Flowering Season - June-August.  Distribution - United States from New Jersey, Kentucky, and Iowa  northward and northwestward. Europe and Asia.    Dry fields blued with the bright blossoms of the tufted vetch,  and roadsides and thickets where the angular vine sends forth  vivid patches of color, resound with the music of happy bees.  Although the parts of the flower fit closely together, they are  elastic, and opening with the energetic visitor's weight and  movement give ready access to the nectary. On his departure they  resume their original position, to protect both nectar and pollen  from rain and pilferers whose bodies are not perfectly adapted to  further the flower's cross-fertilization. The common bumblebee  (Bombus terrestris) plays a mean trick, all too frequently, when  he bites a hole at the base of the blossom, not only gaining easy  access to the sweets for himself, but opening the way for others  less intelligent than he, but quite ready to profit by his  mischief, and so defeat nature's plan. Dr. Ogle observed that the  same bee always acts in the same manner, one sucking the nectar  legitimately, another always biting a hole to obtain it  surreptitiously, the natural inference, of course, being that  some bees, like small boys, are naturally depraved.    In cultivated fields and waste places farther south and westward  to the Pacific Coast roams the COMMON or PEBBLE VETCH OR TARE (V.  saliva), another domesticated weed that has come to us from  Europe, where it is extensively grown for fodder.

I called to my       companion: \"Are you dancing?\" The balloon by this time had many       holes burnt in it and using my sponge I cried that we must       descend. My companion however explained that we were over Paris       and must now cross it; therefore raising the fire once more we       turned south till we passed the Luxembourg, when,       extinguishing the flames, the balloon came down spent and       empty.    If poor Pilatre played the part of a rather nervous man in this  narrative he had the nerve still to go on with his aeronautical  experiments to the point of death. In 1785 he essayed the crossing  of the English Channel in a balloon of his own design, in which he  sought to combine the principles of the gas and hot-air balloons. It  appears to have been something like an effort to combine  nitro-glycerine with an electric spark. At any rate the dense crowds  that thronged the coast near Boulogne to see the start of the  \"Charles--Montgolfier\"--as the balloon was named after the  originators of the rival systems--saw it, after half an hour's drift  out to sea, suddenly explode in a burst of flame. De Rozier and a  friend who accompanied him were killed. A monument still recalls  their fate, which however is more picturesquely recorded in the  signs of sundry inns and cafes of the neighbourhood which offer  refreshment in the name of _Les Aviateurs Perdus_.    Thereafter experimenters with balloons multiplied amazingly. The  world thought the solution of the problem of flight had been found  in the gas bag. Within two months a balloon capable of lifting  eighteen tons and carrying seven passengers ascended three thousand  feet at Lyons, and, though sustaining a huge rent in the envelope,  because of the expansion of the gas at that height, returned to  earth in safety. The fever ran from France to England and in 1784,  only a year after the first Montgolfier experiments, Lunardi, an  Italian aeronaut made an ascension from London which was viewed by  King George III. and his ministers, among them William Pitt. But the  early enthusiasm for ballooning quickly died down to mere curiosity.  It became apparent to all that merely to rise into the air, there to  be the helpless plaything of the wind, was but a useless and futile  accomplishment. Pleasure seekers and mountebanks used balloons for  their own purposes, but serious experimenters at once saw that if  the invention of the balloon was to be of the slightest practical  value some method must be devised for controlling and directing its  flight. To this end some of the brightest intellects of the world  directed their efforts, but it is hardly overstating the case to say  that more than a century passed without any considerable progress  toward the development of a dirigible balloon.    [Illustration: Charles's Balloon.]    But even at the earlier time it was evident enough that the Quaker  philosopher, from the American Colonies, not yet the United States,  whose shrewd and inquiring disposition made him intellectually one  of the foremost figures of his day, foresaw clearly the great  possibilities of this new invention. In letters to Sir Joseph Banks,  then President of the Royal Society of London, Franklin gave a  lively account of the first three ascensions, together with some  comments, at once suggestive and humorous, which are worth quoting:         Some think [he wrote of the balloon] Progressive Motion on the       Earth may be advanc'd by it, and that a Running Footman or a       Horse slung and suspended under such a Globe so as to have no       more of Weight pressing the Earth with their Feet than Perhaps       8 or 10 Pounds, might with a fair Wind run in a straight Line       across Countries as fast as that Wind, and over Hedges, Ditches       and even Waters. It has been even fancied that in time People       will keep such Globes anchored in the Air to which by Pullies       they may draw up Game to be preserved in the Cool and Water to       be frozen when Ice is wanted. And that to get Money it will be       contriv'd, by running them up in an Elbow Chair a Mile high for       a guinea, etc., etc.    With his New England lineage Franklin could hardly have failed of  this comparison: \"A few Months since the Idea of Witches riding  through the Air upon a broomstick, and that of Philosophers upon a  Bag of Smoke would have appeared equally impossible and ridiculous.\"    To-day when aircraft are the eyes of the armies in the greatest war  of history, and when it appears that, with the return of peace, the  conquest of the air for the ordinary uses of man will be swiftly  completed, Franklin's good-humoured plea for the fullest  experimentation is worth recalling. And the touch of piety with  which he concludes his argument is a delightful example of the  whimsical fashion in which he often undertook to bolster up a  mundane theory with a reference to things supernatural.    [Illustration: _A French Observation Balloon on Fire._    (C) U. & U.]         I am sorry this Experiment is totally neglected in England, where       mechanic Genius is so strong. I wish I could see the same       Emulation between the two Nations as I see between the two       Parties here. Your Philosophy seems to be too bashful. In this       Country we are not so much afraid of being laught at. If we do a       foolish thing, we are the first to laugh at it ourselves, and are       almost as much pleased with a _Bon Mot_ or a _Chanson_, that       ridicules well the Disappointment of a Project, as we might have       been with its success. It does not seem to me a good reason to       decline prosecuting a new Experiment which apparently increases       the power of Man over Matter, till we can see to what Use that       Power may be applied. When we have learnt to manage it, we may       hope some time or other to find Uses for it, as men have done for       Magnetism and Electricity, of which the first Experiments were       mere Matters of Amusement.         This Experience is by no means a trifling one. It may be attended       with important Consequences that no one can foresee. We should       not suffer Pride to prevent our progress in Science.         Beings of a Rank and Nature far superior to ours have not       disdained to amuse themselves with making and launching Balloons,       otherwise we should never have enjoyed the Light of those       glorious objects that rule our Day & Night, nor have had the       Pleasure of riding round the Sun ourselves upon the Balloon we       now inhabit.                                                    B. FRANKLIN.    The earliest experimenters thought that oars might be employed to  propel and direct a balloon. The immediate failure of all endeavours  of this sort, led them, still pursuing the analogy between a balloon  and a ship at sea, to try to navigate the air with sails. This again  proved futile. It is impossible for a balloon, or airship to \"tack\"  or manoeuvre in any way by sail power. It is in fact a monster sail  itself, needing some other power than the wind to make headway or  steerage way against the wind. The sail device was tested only to be  abandoned. Only when a trail rope dragging along the ground or sea  is employed does the sail offer sufficient resistance to the wind to  sway the balloon's course this way or that. And a trailer is  impracticable when navigating great heights.    [Illustration: Roberts Brothers' Dirigible.]    For these reasons the development of the balloon lagged, until Count  Zeppelin and M. Santos-Dumont consecrated their fortunes, their  inventive minds, and their amazing courage to the task of perfecting  a dirigible. In a book, necessarily packed with information  concerning the rapid development of aircraft which began in the last  decade of the nineteenth century and was enormously stimulated  during the war of all the world, the long series of early  experiments with balloons must be passed over hastily. Though  interesting historically these experiments were futile. Beyond  having discovered what could _not_ be done with a balloon the  practitioners of that form of aeronautics were little further along  in 1898 when Count Zeppelin came along with the first plan for a  rigid dirigible than they were when Blanchard in 1786, seizing a  favourable gale drifted across the English Channel to the French  shore, together with Dr. Jefferies, an American. It was just 124  years later that Bleriot, a Frenchman, made the crossing in an  airplane independently of favouring winds. It had taken a century  and a quarter to attain this independence.    In a vague way the earliest balloonists recognized that power,  independent of wind, was necessary to give balloons steerage way and  direction. Steam was in its infancy during the early days of  ballooning, but the efforts to devise some sort of an engine light  enough to be carried into the air were untiring. Within a year after  the experiments of the Montgolfier brothers, the suggestion was made  that the explosion of small quantities of gun-cotton and the  expulsion of the resulting gases might be utilized in some fashion  to operate propelling machinery. Though the suggestion was not  developed to any useful point it was of interest as forecasting the  fundamental idea of the gas engines of to-day which have made  aviation possible--that is, the creation of power by a series of  explosions within the motor.    In the effort to make balloons dirigible one of the first steps was  to change the form from the spherical or pear-shaped bag to a  cylindrical, or cigar-shape. This device was adopted by the brothers  Robert in France as early as 1784. Their balloon further had a  double skin or envelope, its purpose being partly to save the gas  which percolated through the inner skin, partly to maintain the  rigidity of the structure. As gas escapes from an "]]]
