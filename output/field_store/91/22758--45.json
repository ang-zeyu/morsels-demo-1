At this, all the women would have flung themselves upon the  chevalier; but the marquise, fearing that he would only become more  enraged, and hoping to disarm him, asked, on the contrary, that she  might be left alone with him: all the company, yielding to her desire,  passed into the next room; this was what the chevalier, on his part,  too, asked.    Scarcely were they alone, when the marquise, joining her hands, knelt to  him and said in the gentlest and most appealing voice that it was  possible to use, \"Chevalier, my dear brother, will you not have pity  upon me, who have always had so much affection for you, and who, even  now, would give my blood for your service? You know that the things I am  saying are not merely empty words; and yet how is it you are treating  me, though I have not deserved it? And what will everyone say to such  dealings? Ah, brother, what a great unhappiness is mine, to have been so  cruelly treated by you! And yet--yes, brother--if you will deign to have  pity on me and to save my life, I swear, by my hope of heaven, to keep  no remembrance of what has happened; and to consider you always as my  protector and my friend.\"    All at once the marquise rose with a great cry and clasped her hand to  her right side. While she was speaking, and before she perceived what he  was doing, the chevalier had drawn his sword, which was very short, and  using it as a dagger, had struck her in the breast; this first blow was  followed by a second, which came in contact with the shoulder blade, and  so was prevented from going farther. At these two blows the marquise  rushed towards the door, of the room into which the ladies had retired,  crying, \"Help! He is killing me!\"    But during the time that she took to cross the room the chevalier  stabbed her five times in the back with his sword, and would no doubt  have done more, if at the last blow his sword had not broken; indeed, he  had struck with such force that the fragment remained embedded in her  shoulder, and the marquise fell forward on the floor, in a pool of her  blood, which was flowing all round her and spreading through the room.    The chevalier thought he had killed her, and hearing the women running  to her assistance, he rushed from the room. The abbe was still at the  door, pistol in hand; the chevalier took him by the arm to drag him  away, and as the abbe hesitated to follow, he said:--    \"Let us go, abbe; the business is done.\"    The chevalier and the abbe had taken a few steps in the street when a  window opened and the women who had found the marquise expiring called  out for help: at these cries the abbe stopped short, and holding back  the chevalier by the arm, demanded--    \"What was it you said, chevalier? If they are calling help, is she not  dead, after all?\"    \"'Ma foi', go and see for yourself,\" returned the chevalier. \"I have  done enough for my share; it is your turn now.\"    \"'Pardieu', that is quite my opinion,\" cried the abbe; and rushing back  to the house, he flung himself into the room at the moment when the  women, lifting the marquise with great difficulty, for she was so weak  that she could no longer help herself, were attempting to carry her to  bed. The abbe pushed them away, and arriving at the marquise, put his  pistol to her heart; but Madame Brunel, the same who had previously  given the marquise a box of orvietan, lifted up the barrel with her  hand, so that the shot went off into the air, and the bullet instead of  striking the marquise lodged in the cornice of the ceiling. The abbe  then took the pistol by the barrel and gave Madame Brunet so violent a  blow upon the head with the butt that she staggered and almost fell; he  was about to strike her again, but all the women uniting against him,  pushed him, with thousands of maledictions, out of the room, and locked  the door behind him. The two assassins, taking advantage of the  darkness, fled from Ganges, and reached Aubenas, which is a full league  away, about ten in the evening.    Meanwhile the women were doing all they could for the marquise. Their  first intention, as we have already said, was to put her to bed, but the  broken sword blade made her unable to lie down, and they tried in vain  to pull it out, so deeply had it entered the bone. Then the marquise  herself showed Madame Brunei what method to take: the operating lady was  to sit on the bed, and while the others helped to hold up the marquise,  was to seize the blade with both hands, and pressing her--knees against  the patient's back, to pull violently and with a great jerk. This plan  at last succeeded, and the marquise was able to get to bed; it was nine  in the evening, and this horrible tragedy had been going on for nearly  three hours.    The magistrates of Ganges, being informed of what had happened, and  beginning to believe that it was really a case of murder, came in  person, with a guard, to the marquise. As soon as she saw them come in  she recovered strength, and raising herself in bed, so great was her  fear, clasped her hands and besought their protection; for she always  expected to see one or the other of her murderers return. The  magistrates told her to reassure herself, set armed men to guard all the  approaches to the house, and while physicians and surgeons were,  summoned in hot haste from Montpellier, they on their part sent word to  the Baron de Trissan, provost of Languedoc, of the crime that had just  been committed, and gave him the names and the description of the  murderers. That official at once sent people after them, but it was  already too late: he learned that the abbe and the chevalier had slept  at Aubenas on the night of the murder, that there they had reproached  each other for their unskilfulness, and had come near cutting each  other's throats, that finally they had departed before daylight, and had  taken a boat, near Agde, from a beach called the \"Gras de Palaval.\"    The Marquis de Ganges was at Avignon, where he was prosecuting a servant  of his who had robbed him of two hundred crowns; when he heard news of  the event. He turned horribly pale as he listened to the messenger's  story, then falling into a violent fury against his brothers, he swore  that they should have no executioners other than himself. Nevertheless,  though he was so uneasy about the marquise's condition, he waited until  the next day in the afternoon before setting forth, and during the  interval he saw some of his friends at Avignon without saying anything  to them of the matter. He did not reach Ganges until four days after the  murder, then he went to the house of M. Desprats and asked to see his  wife, whom some kind priests had already prepared for the meeting; and  the marquise, as soon as she heard of his arrival, consented to receive  him. The marquis immediately entered the room, with his eyes full of  tears, tearing his hair, and giving every token of the deepest despair.    The marquise receivers her husband like a forgiving wife and a dying  Christian. She scarcely even uttered some slight reproaches about the  manner in which he had deserted her; moreover, the marquis having  complained to a monk of these reproaches, and the monk having reported  his complaints to the marquise, she called her husband to her bedside,  at a moment when she was surrounded by people, and made him a public  apology, begging him to attribute the words that seemed to have wounded  him to the effect of her sufferings, and not to any failure in her  regard for him. The marquis, left alone with his wife, tried to take  advantage of this reconciliation to induce her to annul the declaration  that she had made before the magistrates of Avignon; for the vice-legate  and his officers, faithful to the promises made to the marquise, had  refused to register the fresh donation which she had made at Ganges,  according to the suggestions of the abbe, and which the latter had sent  off, the very moment it was signed, to his brother. But on this point  the marquise was immovably resolute, declaring that this fortune was  reserved for her children and therefore sacred to her, and that she  could make no alteration in what had been done at Avignon, since it  represented her genuine and final wishes. Notwithstanding this  declaration, the marquis did not cease to--remain beside his wife and to  bestow upon her every care possible to a devoted and attentive husband.    Two days later than the Marquis de Ganges arrived Madame de Rossan great  was her amazement, after all the rumours that were already in  circulation about the marquis, at finding her daughter in the hands of  him whom she regarded as one of her murderers. But the marquise, far  from sharing that opinion, did all she could, not only to make her  mother feel differently, but even to induce her to embrace the marquis  as a son. This blindness on the part of the marquise caused Madame de  Rossan so much grief that notwithstanding her profound affection for her  daughter she would only stay two days, and in spite of the entreaties  that the dying woman made to her, she returned home, not allowing  anything to stop her. This departure was a great grief to the marquise,  and was the reason why she begged with renewed entreaties to be taken to  Montpellier. The very sight of the place where she had been so cruelly  tortured continually brought before her, not only the remembrance of the  murder, but the image of the murderers, who in her brief moments of  sleep so haunted her that she sometimes awoke suddenly, uttering shrieks  and calling for help. Unfortunately, the physician considered her too  weak to bear removal, and declared that no change of place could be made"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2759"],[0,"The Man in the Iron Mask (#7)"],[1,"race, that the brothers excluded from the throne should be always  princes void of courage and honesty, as was your uncle, M. Gaston  d'Orleans, who ten times conspired against his brother Louis XIII.\"    \"What!\" cried the prince, astonished; \"my uncle Gaston 'conspired  against his brother'; conspired to dethrone him?\"    \"Exactly, monseigneur; for no other reason. I tell you the truth.\"    \"And he had friends--devoted friends?\"    \"As much so as I am to you.\"    \"And, after all, what did he do?--Failed!\"    \"He failed, I admit; but always through his own fault; and, for the  sake of purchasing--not his life--for the life of the king's brother is  sacred and inviolable--but his liberty, he sacrificed the lives of all  his friends, one after another. And so, at this day, he is a very  blot on history, the detestation of a hundred noble families in this  kingdom.\"    \"I understand, monsieur; either by weakness or treachery, my uncle slew  his friends.\"    \"By weakness; which, in princes, is always treachery.\"    \"And cannot a man fail, then, from incapacity and ignorance? Do you  really believe it possible that a poor captive such as I, brought up,  not only at a distance from the court, but even from the world--do you  believe it possible that such a one could assist those of his friends  who should attempt to serve him?\" And as Aramis was about to reply, the  young man suddenly cried out, with a violence which betrayed the temper  of his blood, \"We are speaking of friends; but how can _I_ have any  friends--I, whom no one knows; and have neither liberty, money, nor  influence, to gain any?\"    \"I fancy I had the honor to offer myself to your royal highness.\"    \"Oh, do not style me so, monsieur; 'tis either treachery or cruelty. Bid  me not think of aught beyond these prison-walls, which so grimly  confine me; let me again love, or, at least, submit to my slavery and my  obscurity.\"    \"Monseigneur, monseigneur; if you again utter these desperate words--if,  after having received proof of your high birth, you still remain  poor-spirited in body and soul, I will comply with your desire, I will  depart, and renounce forever the service of a master, to whom so eagerly  I came to devote my assistance and my life!\"    \"Monsieur,\" cried the prince, \"would it not have been better for you to  have reflected, before telling me all that you have done, that you have  broken my heart forever?\"    \"And so I desire to do, monseigneur.\"    \"To talk to me about power, grandeur, eye, and to prate of thrones! Is  a prison the fit place? You wish to make me believe in splendor, and we  are lying lost in night; you boast of glory, and we are smothering our  words in the curtains of this miserable bed; you give me glimpses of  power absolute whilst I hear the footsteps of the every-watchful jailer  in the corridor--that step which, after all, makes you tremble more than  it does me. To render me somewhat less incredulous, free me from the  Bastile; let me breathe the fresh air; give me my spurs and trusty  sword, then we shall begin to understand each other.\"    \"It is precisely my intention to give you all this, monseigneur, and  more; only, do you desire it?\"    \"A word more,\" said the prince. \"I know there are guards in every  gallery, bolts to every door, cannon and soldiery at every barrier.  How will you overcome the sentries--spike the guns? How will you break  through the bolts and bars?\"    \"Monseigneur,--how did you get the note which announced my arrival to  you?\"    \"You can bribe a jailer for such a thing as a note.\"    \"If we can corrupt one turnkey, we can corrupt ten.\"    \"Well; I admit that it may be possible to release a poor captive from  the Bastile; possible so to conceal him that the king's people shall  not again ensnare him; possible, in some unknown retreat, to sustain the  unhappy wretch in some suitable manner.\"    \"Monseigneur!\" said Aramis, smiling.    \"I admit that, whoever would do this much for me, would seem more than  mortal in my eyes; but as you tell me I am a prince, brother of the  king, how can you restore me the rank and power which my mother and my  brother have deprived me of? And as, to effect this, I must pass a  life of war and hatred, how can you cause me to prevail in those  combats--render me invulnerable by my enemies? Ah! monsieur, reflect on  all this; place me, to-morrow, in some dark cavern at a mountain's base;  yield me the delight of hearing in freedom sounds of the river, plain  and valley, of beholding in freedom the sun of the blue heavens, or the  stormy sky, and it is enough. Promise me no more than this, for, indeed,  more you cannot give, and it would be a crime to deceive me, since you  call yourself my friend.\"    Aramis waited in silence. \"Monseigneur,\" he resumed, after a moment's  reflection, \"I admire the firm, sound sense which dictates your words; I  am happy to have discovered my monarch's mind.\"    \"Again, again! oh, God! for mercy's sake,\" cried the prince, pressing  his icy hands upon his clammy brow, \"do not play with me! I have no need  to be a king to be the happiest of men.\"    \"But I, monseigneur, wish you to be a king for the good of humanity.\"    \"Ah!\" said the prince, with fresh distrust inspired by the word; \"ah!  with what, then, has humanity to reproach my brother?\"    \"I forgot to say, monseigneur, that if you would allow me to guide you,  and if you consent to become the most powerful monarch in Christendom,  you will have promoted the interests of all the friends whom I devote to  the success of your cause, and these friends are numerous.\"    \"Numerous?\"    \"Less numerous than powerful, monseigneur.\"    \"Explain yourself.\"    \"It is impossible; I will explain, I swear before Heaven, on that day  that I see you sitting on the throne of France.\"    \"But my brother?\"    \"You shall decree his fate. Do you pity him?\"    \"Him, who leaves me to perish in a dungeon? No, no. For him I have no  pity!\"    \"So much the better.\"    \"He might have himself come to this prison, have taken me by the hand,  and have said, 'My brother, Heaven created us to love, not to contend  with one another. I come to you. A barbarous prejudice has condemned you  to pass your days in obscurity, far from mankind, deprived of every joy.  I will make you sit down beside me; I will buckle round your waist our  father's sword. Will you take advantage of this reconciliation to put  down or restrain me? Will you employ that sword to spill my blood?' 'Oh!  never,' I would have replied to him, 'I look on you as my preserver,  I will respect you as my master. You give me far more than Heaven  bestowed; for through you I possess liberty and the privilege of loving  and being loved in this world.'\"    \"And you would have kept your word, monseigneur?\"    \"On my life! While now--now that I have guilty ones to punish--\"    \"In what manner, monseigneur?\"    \"What do you say as to the resemblance that Heaven has given me to my  brother?\"    \"I say that there was in that likeness a providential instruction which  the king ought to have heeded; I say that your mother committed a  crime in rendering those different in happiness and fortune whom nature  created so startlingly alike, of her own flesh, and I conclude that the  object of punishment should be only to restore the equilibrium.\"    \"By which you mean--\"    \"That if I restore you to your place on your brother's throne, he shall  take yours in prison.\"    \"Alas! there's such infinity of suffering in prison, especially it would  be so for one who has drunk so deeply of the cup of enjoyment.\"    \"Your royal highness will always be free to act as you may desire; and  if it seems good to you, after punishment, you will have it in your  power to pardon.\"    \"Good. And now, are you aware of one thing, monsieur?\"    \"Tell me, my prince.\"    \"It is that I will hear nothing further from you till I am clear of the  Bastile.\"    \"I was going to say to your highness that I should only have the  pleasure of seeing you once again.\"    \"And when?\"    \"The day when my prince leaves these gloomy walls.\"    \"Heavens! how will you give me notice of it?\"    \"By myself coming to fetch you.\"    \"Yourself?\"    \"My prince, do not leave this chamber save with me, or if in my absence  you are compelled to do so, remember that I am not concerned in it.\"    \"And so I am not to speak a word of this to any one whatever, save to  you?\"    \"Save only to me.\" Aramis bowed very low. The prince offered his hand.    \"Monsieur,\" he said, in a tone that issued from his heart, \"one word  more, my last. If you have sought me for my destruction; if you are only  a tool in the hands of my enemies; if from our conference, in which  you have sounded the depths of my mind, anything worse than captivity  result, that is to say, if death befall me, still receive my blessing,  for you will have ended my troubles and given me repose from the  tormenting fever that has preyed on me for eight long, weary years.\"    \"Monseigneur, wait the results ere you judge me,\" said Aramis.    \"I say that, in such a case, I bless and forgive you. If, on the other  hand, you are come to restore me to that position in the sunshine of  fortune and glory to which I was destined by Heaven; if by your means I  am enabled to live in the memory of man, and confer luster on my race by  deeds of valor, or by solid benefits bestowed upon my people; if, from  my present depths of sorrow, aided by your generous hand, I raise myself  to the very height of honor, then to you, whom I thank with blessings,  to you will I offer half my power and my glory: though you would still  be but partly recompensed, and your share must always remain incomplete,  since I could not divide with you the happiness received at your hands.\"    \"Monseigneur,\" replied Aramis, moved by the pallor and excitement of  the young man, \"the nobleness of your heart fills me with joy and  admiration. It is not you who will have to thank me, "]]]
