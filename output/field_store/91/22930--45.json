The extension of the upright supporting column is        accomplished by two sliding motions, the lower,        controlled by a set screw only, being intended for        coarser adjustments, the upper, controlled by rack and        pinion, for finer adjustments. A millimeter scale and a        vernier serve to indicate the degrees of the various        motions, so that vertical motion of the microscope tube        to the extent of 1/10 mm may be accomplished.          The microscope tube carries a spirit level and revolves        upon a horizontal disc. The objective, consisting of two        separable doublets, permits three degrees of        magnification of 5, 9 and 48 cm focal distance        respectively. A rack and pinion adjustment serves as        adjustment of the microscope tube. A micrometer, 1 cm        long and divided into 100, in the diaphragm of the        ocular still further increases the availability of the        instrument for making fine and accurate measurements.          The instrument serves as a useful aid in many physical        and physiological investigations.          Price, including objective, ocular and micrometer         =40.--=            =Microscopes for Mineralogical Research.=      We construct two Microscopes for mineralogical investigations. Both are  adapted for determining the axes of elasticity and for the  differentiation of isotropic and anisotropic bodies. Stand I alone is  adapted for determining the optical axes and their angles.    Only such objectives, condensers and oculars are available for  mineralogical examinations as have been shown after careful examination  in polarized light to be free from polarization.    [Illustration: Mineralogical Stand I.]        =Mineralogical Stand I.=      37. This microscope corresponds in its dimensions to        Stand Ia as described on page 31. Coarse adjustment by        rack and pinion, fine adjustment by micrometer-screw,        the milled head of which has 50 divisions, each        representing a motion of the objective of 1/100 mm. The        condenser, iris-diaphragm and polarizer can be raised        and lowered by rack and pinion. A triple condenser        facilitates the observation of the axial lines in the        microscope. It is so arranged as to be easily replaced        by a simple diaphragm-carrier. By means of a collar        attached to the end of the tube the objective is brought        into coincidence with the centre of the revolving stage.        This revolving stage is divided into 360 degrees and        fitted with a vernier and index. Two scales on the        stage, at right angles to each other, permit accurate        location of specimens. The Nicol prism, which serves as        a polarizer, can, after turning the iris-diaphragm        aside, be drawn out from under the latter. The zero        position of the Nicol prism is indicated by a line, as        well as the angles 90, 180, 270 deg. The analyser is        mounted in metal and is firmly fixed above the eye-        piece. The analyser rotates on a disc graduated to 360        deg. The front of the tube has a movable window which        provides access to the inner tube. In the latter is an        opening for the introduction of a Bertrand lens. This        lens serves the purpose of magnifying the interference        figures produced by the converging rays of polarized        light. This lens and the eye-piece can be raised or        lowered by rack and pinion. In the analyzer is a slide        for the insertion of gypsum and quartz plates at an        angle of 45 degrees.          In many investigations it is advisable to employ an        analyzer introduced laterally into the tube, instead of        the one mentioned above.          The following parts are supplied to complete the outfit:          Triple nose-piece.            Eye-piece 0, with Bertrand's quartered quartz plate.            Eye-piece I with cross-lines, Brezina's Calcspath-plate,          cleft perpendicularly to its axis, made to fit over          eye-piece I, Klein's gypsum and quartz plates for          insertion in the opening over the objective.

The base and pillar are in one piece, neatly        japanned black. The coarse adjustment is by rack and        pinion.          The stage is revolving and graduated on the edge into        360 degrees. A pointer indicates its position.          The polarizer has stop at zeropoint and also marks at 90 deg.,        180 deg. and 270 deg. It is held in a spring-sleeve and the        substage can be raised and lowered by lateral screw, or        may be swung to one side. The condenser is mounted in        separate arm above the polarizer and swings out of the        optical axis by means of a lever, if parallel instead of        convergent rays are desired.          The analyzer fits into an opening of the tube above the        objectives and can be instantly thrown in or out of the        optical axis. There is a slot below the analyzer for the        insertion of quartz and gypsum plates.          By means of a collar with two centering screws attached to        the end of the tube, the objective may be brought into the        optical axis.

But if vegetation took the same forms on the Moon as on the Earth, and  passed through the same changes, we should have no difficulty in  perceiving the evidence of its presence. If we were transported to the  Moon and turned our eyes earthward, we should not need the assistance of  any telescope in order to detect terrestrial changes which would be  plainly connected with the seasonal changes of vegetation. The Earth would  present to us a disc four times the apparent diameter of the Moon, and on  that disc Canada would offer as great an area as the whole of the Moon  does to us. We could easily follow with the naked eye the change from the  glittering whiteness of the aspect of Canada when snow-covered in winter,  to the brown, green and gold which would succeed each other during the  brighter months of the year. And this type of change would alternate  between the northern and southern hemispheres, for the winter of Canada is  the summer of the Argentine, and conversely.    We ought, therefore, to have no difficulty in observing seasonal changes  on the Moon, if such take place. But nothing of the kind has ever been  remarked; no changes sufficiently pronounced for us to be sure of them are  ever witnessed. Here and there some slight mutations have been suspected,  nearly all accomplishing their cycle in the course of a lunar day; so that  it is difficult to separate them from changes purely apparent, brought  about by the change in the incidence of the illumination.    The difference in appearance of a given area on the Moon when viewed under  a low Sun and when the Sun is on the meridian is very striking. In the  first case everything is in the boldest relief; the shadows are long and  intensely black; the whole area under examination in the telescope seems  as if it might be handled. Under the high Sun, the contrasts are gone; the  scenery appears flat, many of the large conspicuous markings are only  recognized with difficulty. Thus the terse remark of Maedler, \"The full  Moon knows no Maginus,\" has become a proverb amongst selenographers; yet  Maginus is a fine walled plain some eighty miles in diameter, and its  rampart attains a height in parts of 14,000 feet. Maginus lies near Tycho,  which has been well named \"the lunar metropolis,\" for from it radiates the  principal system of bright streaks conspicuous on the full Moon. These  white streaks appear when the shadows have vanished or are growing short;  they are not seen under a low Sun.    The changes which appear to take place in the lunar formations owing to  the change in their illumination are much more striking and varied than  would be anticipated. But the question arises whether all the changes that  are associated with the progress of the lunar day can be ascribed to this  effect. Thus, Prof. W. H. Pickering writes concerning a well-known pair of  little craters of about nine miles in diameter, \"known as Messier and  Messier A, situated side by side not far from the centre of the Mare  Fecunditatis. When the Sun rises first on them, the eastern one, A, is  triangular and larger than Messier, which latter is somewhat pear-shaped.  About three days after sunrise they both suddenly turn white, Messier  rapidly grows in size, soon surpasses A, and also becomes triangular in  shape. Six days after sunrise the craters are again nearly of the same  size, owing to the diminution of Messier. The shape of A has become  irregular, and differs in different lunations. At nine days after sunrise  the craters are exactly alike in size and shape, both now being  elliptical, with their major axes lying in a nearly N. and S. direction.  Just before sunset A is again the larger, being almost twice the size of  Messier.\"[12]    Some observers explain this cycle of changes as due merely to the peculiar  contour of the two objects, the change in the lighting during the lunar  day altering their apparent figures. Prof. W. H. Pickering, on the other  hand, while recognizing that some portion of the change of shape is  probably due to the contour of the ground, conceives that, in order to  explain the whole phenomenon, it is necessary to suppose that a white  layer of hoar frost is formed periodically round the two craters. It is  also alleged that whereas Maedler described the two craters as being  exactly alike eighty years ago, Messier A is now distinctly the larger;  but it is very doubtful whether Maedler's description can be trusted to  this degree of nicety. If it could, this would establish a permanent  change in the actual structure of the lunar surface at this point.    There are several other cases of the same order of ambiguity. The most  celebrated is Linne, a white spot about six miles in diameter on the Mare  Serentatis. This object appears to change in size during the progress of  the lunar day, and, as with Messier, some selenographers consider that it  has also suffered an actual permanent change in shape within the last  sixty or seventy years. Here again the evidence is not decisive; Neison is  by no means convinced that a change has taken place, yet does not think it  impossible that Linne may once have been a crater with steep walls which  have collapsed into its interior through the force of gravity.    Another type of suspected change is associated with the neighbourhood of  Aristarchus, the brightest formation on the Moon, so bright indeed that  Sir William Herschel, observing it when illuminated by earthshine in the  dark portion of the Moon, thought that he was watching a lunar volcano in  eruption. In 1897, on September 21, the late Major Molesworth noticed that  the crater was at that time under the rays of the setting Sun, and filled  with shadow, and the inner terraces, which should have been invisible,  were seen as faint, knotted, glimmering streaks under both the eastern and  western walls, and the central peak was also dimly discernible. He thought  this unusual lighting up of rocks on which the Sun had already set might  be due either to phosphorescence produced by long exposure to the Sun's  rays, or to inherent heat, or to reflected glare from the western rampart.  Still more important, both Major Molesworth and Mr. Walter Goodacre, each  on more than one occasion, observed what seemed to be a faint bluish mist  on the inner slope of the east wall, soon after sunrise, but this was  visible only for a short time. Other selenographers too, on rare  occasions, have made observations accordant with these, relating to  various regions on the Moon.    These, and a few other similar instances, are all that selenography has to  offer by way of evidence of actual lunar change. Of seeming change there  is abundance, but beyond that we have only cases for controversy, and one  of the most industrious of the present-day observers of the Moon, M.  Philip Fauth, declares that \"as a student of the Moon for the last twenty  years, and as probably one of the few living investigators who have kept  in practical touch with the results of selenography, he is bound to  express his conviction that no eye has ever seen a physical change in the  plastic features of the Moon's surface.\"[13]    In this matter of change, then, the Earth and Moon stand in the greatest  contrast to each other. As we have seen, from the view-point of the Moon,  the appearance of the Earth would change so manifestly with the progress  of the seasons that no one could fail to remark the difference, even  though observing with the naked eye. But from the view-point of the Earth,  the Moon when examined by our most experienced observers, armed with our  most powerful telescopes, offers us only a few doubtful enigmatical  instances of possible change confined to small isolated localities; we see  no evidence that the \"gloom of iron substance\" below is ever concealed by  a veil of changing vegetation, or that \"between the burning light and deep  vacuity\" of the heavens above, the veil of the flying vapour has ever been  spread out. We see the Moon so clearly that we are assured it holds no  water to nourish plant life; we see it so clearly because there is no air  to carry the vapour that might dim our view.    Life is change, and a planet where there is no change, or where that  change is very small, can be no home for life. The \"stability and  insensibility\" are indeed required in the platform upon which life is to  appear, but there must be the presence of \"the passion and the perishing,\"  or life will be unable to find a home.    We infer the absence of water and air from the Moon not only from the  unchanging character of its features and the distinctness with which we  see them; we are able to make direct observations. Galileo, the first man  to observe the Moon to better advantage than with the naked eye, was not  long before he decided that the Moon contained no water, for though  Milton, in a well-known passage, makes Galileo discover      \"Rivers or mountains on her spotty globe,\"    Galileo himself wrote: \"I do not believe that the body of the Moon is  composed of earth and water.\" The name of _maria_ was given to the great  grey plains of the Moon by Hevelius, but this was simply for convenience  of nomenclature, not because he actually believed them to be seas. One  observation is, in itself, sufficient to prove that the maria are not  water surfaces. The Moon's \"terminator,\" that is to say, the line dividing  the part in sunlight from that in darkness, is clearly irregular when it  passes over the great plains; were they actually sea it would be a bright  line and perfectly smooth. The grey plains are therefore not expanses of  water now, nor were they in time past. It is obvious that in some remote  antiquity their surface was in a fluid condition, but it was the fluidity  of molten rock. This is seen by the way in which the maria have invaded,  breached,"]]]
