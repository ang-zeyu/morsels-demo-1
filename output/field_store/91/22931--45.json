The Life and Achievements    OF    DON QUIXOTE DE LA MANCHA.    CHAPTER I.    _The quality and way of living of Don Quixote._      In a certain village in La Mancha, in the kingdom of Arragon, of which  I cannot remember the name, there lived not long ago one of those  old-fashioned gentlemen, who are never without a lance upon a rack, an  old target, a lean horse, and a greyhound. His diet consisted more of  beef than mutton; and, with minced meat on most nights, lentiles on  Fridays, and a pigeon extraordinary on Sundays, he consumed three  quarters of his revenue; the rest was laid out in a plush coat, velvet  breeches, with slippers of the same, for holydays; and a suit of the  very best homespun cloth, which he bestowed on himself for  working-days. His whole family was a housekeeper something turned of  forty, a niece not twenty, and a man that served him in the house and  in the field, and could saddle a horse, and handle the pruning-hook.  The master himself was nigh fifty years of age, of a hale and strong  complexion, lean-bodied and thin-faced, an early riser, and a lover of  hunting. Some say his sirname was Quixada, or Quesada (for authors  differ in this particular); however, we may reasonably conjecture, he  was called Quixada (_i.e._ lantern-jaws), though this concerns us but  little, provided we keep strictly to the truth in every point of this  history.    Be it known, then, that when our gentleman had nothing to do (which  was almost all the year round), he passed his time in reading books of  knight-errantry, which he did with that application and delight, that  at last he in a manner wholly left off his country sports, and even  the care of his estate; nay, he grew so strangely enamoured of these  amusements, that he sold many acres of land to purchase books of that  kind, by which means he collected as many of them as he could; but  none pleased him like the works of the famous Feliciano de Sylva; for  the brilliancy of his prose, and those intricate expressions with  which it is interlaced seemed to him so many pearls of eloquence,  especially when he came to read the love-addresses and challenges;  many of them in this extraordinary style. \"The reason of your  unreasonable usage of my reason, does so enfeeble my reason, that I  have reason to expostulate with your beauty.\" And this, \"The sublime  heavens, which with your divinity divinely fortify you with the stars,  and fix you the deserver of the desert that is deserved by your  grandeur.\" These, and such-like rhapsodies, strangely puzzled the poor  gentleman's understanding, while he was racking his brain to unravel  their meaning, which Aristotle himself could never have found, though  he should have been raised from the dead for that very purpose.    He did not so well like those dreadful wounds which Don Belianis gave  and received; for he considered that all the art of surgery could  never secure his face and body from being strangely disfigured with  scars. However, he highly commended the author for concluding his book  with a promise to finish that unfinishable adventure; and many times  he had a desire to put pen to paper, and faithfully and literally  finish it himself; which he had certainly done, and doubtless with  good success, had not his thoughts been wholly engrossed in much more  important designs.    He would often dispute with the curate of the parish, a man of  learning, that had taken his degrees at Giguenza, as to which was the  better knight, Palmerin of England, or Amadis de Gaul; but Master  Nicholas, the barber of the same town, would say, that none of them  could compare with the Knight of the Sun; and that if any one came  near him, it was certainly Don Galaor, the brother of Amadis de Gaul;  for he was a man of a most commodious temper, neither was he so  finical, nor such a whining lover, as his brother; and as for courage,  he was not a jot behind him.    In fine, he gave himself up so wholly to the reading of romances, that  at night he would pore on until it was day, and would read on all day  until it was night; and thus a world of extraordinary notions, picked  out of his books, crowded into his imagination; now his head was full  of nothing but enchantments, quarrels, battles, challenges, wounds,  complaints, love-passages, torments, and abundance of absurd  impossibilities; insomuch that all the fables and fantastical tales  which he read seemed to him now as true as the most authentic  histories. He would say, that the Cid Ruydiaz was a very brave knight,  but not worthy to stand in competition with the Knight of the Burning  Sword, who, with a single back-stroke had cut in sunder two fierce  and mighty giants. He liked yet better Bernardo del Carpio, who, at  Roncesvalles, deprived of life the enchanted Orlando, having lifted  him from the ground, and choked him in the air, as Hercules did  Antaeus, the son of the Earth.    As for the giant Morgante, he always spoke very civil things of him;  for among that monstrous brood, who were ever intolerably proud and  insolent, he alone behaved himself like a civil and well-bred person.    But of all men in the world he admired Rinaldo of Montalban, and  particularly his carrying away the idol of Mahomet, which was all  massy gold, as the history says; while he so hated that traitor  Galalon, that for the pleasure of kicking him handsomely, he would  have given up his housekeeper, nay and his niece into the bargain.    Having thus confused his understanding, he unluckily stumbled upon the  oddest fancy that ever entered into a madman's brain; for now he  thought it convenient and necessary, as well for the increase of his  own honour, as the service of the public, to turn knight-errant, and  roam through the whole world, armed cap-a-pie, and mounted on his  steed, in quest of adventures; that thus imitating those  knight-errants of whom he had read, and following their course of  life, redressing all manner of grievances, and exposing himself to  danger on all occasions, at last, after a happy conclusion of his  enterprises, he might purchase everlasting honour and renown.    The first thing he did was to scour a suit of armour that had belonged  to his great grandfather, and had lain time out of mind carelessly  rusting in a corner; but when he had cleaned and repaired it as well  as he could, he perceived there was a material piece wanting; for,  instead of a complete helmet, there was only a single head-piece.  However, his industry supplied that defect; for with some pasteboard  he made a kind of half-beaver, or vizor, which, being fitted to the  head-piece, made it look like an entire helmet. Then, to know whether  it were cutlass-proof, he drew his sword, and tried its edge upon the  pasteboard vizor; but with the very first stroke he unluckily undid in  a moment what he had been a whole week in doing. He did not like its  being broke with so much ease, and therefore, to secure it from the  like accident, he made it a-new, and fenced it with thin plates of  iron, which he fixed on the inside of it so artificially, that at last  he had reason to be satisfied with the solidity of the work; and so,  without any farther experiment, he resolved it should pass to all  intents and purposes for a full and sufficient helmet.    The next moment he went to view his horse, whose bones stuck out like  the corners of a Spanish real, being a worse jade than Gonela's, _qui  tantum pellis etossa fuit_; however, his master thought that neither  Alexander's Bucephalus nor the Cid's Babieca could be compared with  him. He was four days considering what name to give him; for, as he  argued with himself, there was no reason that a horse bestrid by so  famous a knight, and withal so excellent in himself, should not be  distinguished by a particular name; so, after many names which he  devised, rejected, changed, liked, disliked, and pitched upon again,  he concluded to call him Rozinante.    Having thus given his horse a name, he thought of choosing one for  himself; and having seriously pondered on the matter eight whole days  more, at last he determined to call himself Don Quixote. Whence the  author of this history draws this inference, that his right name was  Quixada, and not Quesada, as others obstinately pretend. And  observing, that the valiant Amadis, not satisfied with the bare  appellation of Amadis, added to it the name of his country, that it  might grow more famous by his exploits, and so styled himself Amadis  de Gaul; so he, like a true lover of his native soil, resolved to call  himself Don Quixote de la Mancha; which addition, to his"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/360"],[0,"What is Property? An Inquiry into the Principle of Right and of Government (#7)"],[1,"1815, equilibrium  has been the international law of Europe. It remains now, not to destroy  it, but, while maintaining it, to labor peacefully, in every nation  protected by it, for the equilibrium of economical forces. The last line  of the book, evidently written to check imperial ambition, is: \"Humanity  wants no more war.\"    In 1861, after Garibaldi's expedition and the battle of Castelfidardo,  Proudhon immediately saw that the establishment of Italian unity would  be a severe blow to European equilibrium. It was chiefly in order to  maintain this equilibrium that he pronounced so energetically in  favor of Italian federation, even though it should be at first only  a federation of monarchs. In vain was it objected that, in being  established by France, Italian unity would break European equilibrium in  our favor. Proudhon, appealing to history, showed that every State which  breaks the equilibrium in its own favor only causes the other States to  combine against it, and thereby diminishes its influence and power. He  added that, nations being essentially selfish, Italy would not fail,  when opportunity offered, to place her interest above her gratitude.    To maintain European equilibrium by diminishing great States and  multiplying small ones; to unite the latter in organized federations,  not for attack, but for defence; and with these federations, which, if  they were not republican already, would quickly become so, to hold in  check the great military monarchies,--such, in the beginning of 1861,  was the political programme of Proudhon.    The object of the federations, he said, will be to guarantee, as far as  possible, the beneficent reign of peace; and they will have the  further effect of securing in every nation the triumph of liberty over  despotism. Where the largest unitary State is, there liberty is in the  greatest danger; further, if this State be democratic, despotism without  the counterpoise of majorities is to be feared. With the federation, it  is not so. The universal suffrage of the federal State is checked by the  universal suffrage of the federated States; and the latter is offset in  its turn by PROPERTY, the stronghold of liberty, which it tends, not to  destroy, but to balance with the institutions of MUTUALISM.    All these ideas, and many others which were only hinted at in his  work on \"War and Peace,\" were developed by Proudhon in his subsequent  publications, one of which has for its motto, \"Reforms always, Utopias  never.\" The thinker had evidently finished his evolution.    The Council of State of the canton of Vaud having offered prizes for  essays on the question of taxation, previously discussed at a congress  held at Lausanne, Proudhon entered the ranks and carried off the first  prize. His memoir was published in 1861 under the title of \"The Theory  of Taxation.\"    About the same time, he wrote at Brussels, in \"L'Office de Publicite,\"  some remarkable articles on the question of literary property, which  was discussed at a congress held in Belgium, These articles must not be  confounded with \"Literary Majorats,\" a more complete work on the same  subject, which was published in 1863, soon after his return to France.    Arbitrarily excepted from the amnesty in 1859, Proudhon was pardoned two  years later by a special act. He did not wish to take advantage of this  favor, and seemed resolved to remain in Belgium until the 2d of June,  1863, the time when he was to acquire the privilege of prescription,  when an absurd and ridiculous riot, excited in Brussels by an article  published by him on federation and unity in Italy, induced him to hasten  his return to France. Stones were thrown against the house in which  he lived, in the Faubourg d'Ixelles. After having placed his wife and  daughters in safety among his friends at Brussels, he arrived in Paris  in September, 1862, and published there, \"Federation and Italian Unity,\"  a pamphlet which naturally commences with the article which served as a  pretext for the rioters in Brussels.    Among the works begun by Proudhon while in Belgium, which death did not  allow him to finish, we ought to mention a \"History of Poland,\" which  will be published later; and, \"The Theory of Property,\" which appeared  in 1865, before \"The Gospels Annotated,\" and after the volume entitled  \"The Principle of Art and its Social Destiny.\"    The publications of Proudhon, in 1863, were: 1. \"Literary Majorats: An  Examination of a Bill having for its object the Creation of a Perpetual  Monopoly for the Benefit of Authors, Inventors, and Artists;\" 2.  \"The Federative Principle and the Necessity of Re-establishing the  Revolutionary party;\" 3. \"The Sworn Democrats and the Refractories;\" 4.  \"Whether the Treaties of 1815 have ceased to exist? Acts of the Future  Congress.\"    The disease which was destined to kill him grew worse and worse; but  Proudhon labored constantly!... A series of articles, published in 1864  in \"Le Messager de Paris,\" have been collected in a pamphlet under the  title of \"New Observations on Italian Unity.\" He hoped to publish  during the same year his work on \"The Political Capacity of the Working  Classes,\" but was unable to write the last chapter.... He grew weaker  continually. His doctor prescribed rest. In the month of August he went  to Franche-Comte, where he spent a month. Having returned to Paris,  he resumed his labor with difficulty.... From the month of December  onwards, the heart disease made rapid progress; the oppression became  insupportable, his legs were swollen, and he could not sleep....    On the 19th of January, 1865, he died, towards two o'clock in the  morning, in the arms of his wife, his sister-in-law, and the friend who  writes these lines....    The publication of his correspondence, to which his daughter Catherine  is faithfully devoted, will tend, no doubt, to increase his reputation  as a thinker, as a writer, and as an honest man.    J. A. LANGLOIS.          PREFACE.    The following letter served as a preface to the first edition of this  memoir:--      \"To the Members of the Academy of Besancon    \"PARIS, June 30, 1840.      \"GENTLEMEN,--In the course of your debate of the 9th of May, 1833,  in regard to the triennial pension established by Madame Suard, you  expressed the following wish:--    \"'The Academy requests the titulary to present it annually, during the  first fortnight in July, with a succinct and logical statement of the  various studies which he has pursued during the year which has just  expired.'    \"I now propose, gentlemen, to discharge this duty.    \"When I solicited your votes, I boldly avowed my intention to bend my  efforts to the discovery of some means of AMELIORATING THE PHYSICAL,  MORAL, AND INTELLECTUAL CONDITION OF THE MERE NUMEROUS AND POORER  CLASSES. This idea, foreign as it may have seemed to the object of my  candidacy, you received favorably; and, by the precious distinction with  which it has been your pleasure to honor me, you changed this formal  offer into an inviolable and sacred obligation. Thenceforth I understood  with how worthy and honorable a society I had to deal: my regard for  its enlightenment, my recognition of its benefits, my enthusiasm for its  glory, were unbounded.    \"Convinced at once that, in order to break loose from the beaten paths  of opinions and systems, it was necessary to proceed in my study of man  and society by scientific methods, and in a rigorous manner, I devoted  one year to philology and grammar; linguistics, or the natural history  of speech, being, of all the sciences, that which was best suited to  the character of my mind, seemed to bear the closest relation to the  researches which I was about to commence. A treatise, written at  this period upon one of the most interesting questions of comparative  grammar,[2] if it did not reveal the astonishing success, at least bore  witness to the thoroughness, of my labors.    \"Since that time, metaphysics and moral science have been my only  studies; my perception of the fact that these sciences, though badly  defined as to their object and not confined to their sphere, are, like  the natural sciences, susceptible of demonstration and certainty, has  already rewarded my efforts.    \"But, gentlemen, of all the masters whom I have followed, to none do  I owe so much as to you. Your co-operation, your programmes, your  instructions, in agreement with my secret wishes and most cherished  hopes, have at no time failed to enlighten me and to point out my road;  this memoir on property is the child of your thought.    \"In 1838, the Academy of Besancon proposed the following question:  TO WHAT CAUSES MUST WE ATTRIBUTE THE CONTINUALLY INCREASING NUMBER OF  SUICIDES, AND WHAT ARE THE PROPER MEANS FOR ARRESTING THE EFFECTS OF  THIS MORAL CONTAGION?    \"Thereby it asked, in less general terms, what was the cause of the  social evil, and what was its remedy? You admitted that yourselves,  gentlemen when your committee reported that the competitors had  enumerated with exactness the immediate and particular causes of  suicide, as well as the means of preventing each of them; but that  from this enumeration, chronicled with more or less skill, no positive  information had been gained, either as to the primary cause of the evil,  or as to its remedy.    \"In 1839, your programme, always original and varied in its academical  expression, became more exact. The investigations of 1838 had pointed  out, as the causes or rather as the symptoms of the social malady,  the neglect of the principles of religion and morality, the desire for  wealth, the passion for enjoyment, and political disturbances. All these  data were embodied by you in a single proposition: _THE UTILITY OF THE  CELEBRATION OF SUNDAY AS REGARDS HYGIENE, MORALITY, AND SOCIAL AND  POLITICAL RELATION_.    \"In a Christian tongue you asked, gentlemen, what was the true system  of society. A competitor [3] dared to maintain,"]]]
