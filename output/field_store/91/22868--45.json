But Mrs. Murray was in the saddle, and the pony was impatient to be off.    \"We will go by the Camerons' clearing, and then take their wood track.  It is a better road,\" said Ranald, after they had got through the big  gate.    \"Now, Ranald, you think I am afraid of the swamp, and by the Camerons'  is much longer.\"    \"Indeed, I hear them say that you are not afraid of the--of anything,\"  said Ranald, quickly, \"but this road is better for the horses.\"    \"Come on, then, with your colt\"; and the pony darted away on her  quick-springing gallop, followed by the colt going with a long, easy,  loping stride. For a mile they kept side by side till they reached the  Camerons' lane, when Ranald held in the colt and allowed the pony to  lead. As they passed through the Camerons' yard the big black dogs,  famous bear-hunters, came baying at them. The pony regarded them with  indifference, but the colt shied and plunged.    \"Whoa, Liz!\" Liz was Ranald's contraction for Lizette, the name of the  French horse-trainer and breeder, Jules La Rocque, gave to her mother,  who in her day was queen of the ice at L'Original Christmas races.    \"Be quate, Nigger, will you!\" The dogs, who knew Ranald well, ceased  their clamor, but not before the kitchen door opened and Don Cameron  came out.    Don was about a year older than Ranald and was his friend and comrade.    \"It's me, Don--and Mrs. Murray there.\"    Don gazed speechless.    \"And what--\" he began.    \"Father is not well. He is hurted, and Mrs. Murray is going to see him,  and we must go.\"    Ranald hurried through his story, impatient to get on.    \"But are you going up through the bush?\" asked Don.    \"Yes, what else, Don?\" asked Mrs. Murray. \"It is a good road, isn't it?\"    \"Oh, yes, I suppose it is good enough,\" said Don, doubtfully, \"but I  heard--\"    \"We will come out at our own clearing at the back, you know,\" Ranald  hurried to say, giving Don a kick. \"Whist, man! She is set upon going.\"  At that moment away off toward the swamp, which they were avoiding, the  long, heart-chilling cry of a mother wolf quavered on the still night  air. In spite of herself, Mrs. Murray shivered, and the boys looked at  each other.    \"There is only one,\" said Ranald in a low voice to Don, but they both  knew that where the she wolf is there is a pack not far off. \"And we  will be through the bush in five minutes.\"    \"Come, Ranald! Come away, you can talk to Don any time. Good night,  Don.\" And so saying she headed her pony toward the clearing and was off  at a gallop, and Ranald, shaking his head at his friend, ejaculated:    \"Man alive! what do you think of that?\" and was off after the pony.    Together they entered the bush. The road was well beaten and the horses  were keen to go, so that before many minutes were over they were half  through the bush. Ranald's spirits rose and he began to take some  interest in his companion's observations upon the beauty of the lights  and shadows falling across their path.    \"Look at that very dark shadow from the spruce there, Ranald,\" she  cried, pointing to a deep, black turn in the road. For answer there came  from behind them the long, mournful hunting-cry of the wolf. He was on  their track. Immediately it was answered by a chorus of howls from  the bush on the swamp side, but still far away. There was no need of  command; the pony sprang forward with a snort and the colt followed, and  after a few minutes' running, passed her.    \"Whow-oo-oo-oo-ow\" rose the long cry of the pursuer, summoning help, and  drawing nearer.    \"Wow-ee-wow,\" came the shorter, sharper answer from the swamp, but much  nearer than before and more in front. They were trying to head off their  prey.    Ranald tugged at his colt till he got him back with the pony.    \"It is a good road,\" he said, quietly; \"you can let the pony go. I will  follow you.\" He swung in behind the pony, who was now running for dear  life and snorting with terror at every jump.    \"God preserve us!\" said Ranald to himself. He had caught sight of a dark  form as it darted through the gleam of light in front.    \"What did you say, Ranald?\" The voice was quiet and clear.    \"It is a great pony to run whatever,\" said Ranald, ashamed of himself.    \"Is she not?\"    Ranald glanced over his shoulder. Down the road, running with silent,  awful swiftness, he saw the long, low body of the leading wolf flashing  through the bars of moonlight across the road, and the pack following  hard.    \"Let her go, Mrs. Murray,\" cried Ranald. \"Whip her and never stop.\" But  there was no need; the pony was wild with fear, and was doing her best  running.    Ranald meantime was gradually holding in the colt, and the pony drew  away rapidly. But as rapidly the wolves were closing in behind him.  They were not more than a hundred yards away, and gaining every second.  Ranald, remembering the suspicious nature of the brutes, loosened his  coat and dropped it on the road; with a chorus of yelps they paused,  then threw themselves upon it, and in another minute took up the chase.    But now the clearing was in sight. The pony was far ahead, and Ranald  shook out his colt with a yell. He was none too soon, for the pursuing  pack, now uttering short, shrill yelps, were close at the colt's heels.  Lizette, fleet as the wind, could not shake them off. Closer and ever  closer they came, snapping and snarling. Ranald could see them over his  shoulder. A hundred yards more and he would reach his own back lane. The  leader of the pack seemed to feel that his chances were slipping swiftly  away. With a spurt he gained upon Lizette, reached the saddle-girths,  gathered himself in two short jumps, and sprang for the colt's throat.  Instinctively Ranald stood up in his stirrups, and kicking his foot  free, caught the wolf under the jaw. The brute fell with a howl under  the colt's feet, and next moment they were in the lane and safe.    The savage brutes, discouraged by their leader's fall, slowed down  their fierce pursuit, and hearing the deep bay of the Macdonalds' great  deerhound, Bugle, up at the house, they paused, sniffed the air a  few minutes, then turned and swiftly and silently slid into the dark  shadows. Ranald, knowing that they would hardly dare enter the lane,  checked the colt, and wheeling, watched them disappear.    \"I'll have some of your hides some day,\" he cried, shaking his fist  after them. He hated to be made to run.    He had hardly set the colt's face homeward when he heard something  tearing down the lane to meet him. The colt snorted, swerved, and then  dropping his ears, stood still. It was Bugle, and after him came Mrs.  Murray on the pony.    \"Oh, Ranald!\" she panted, \"thank God you are safe. I was afraid  you--you--\" Her voice broke in sobs. Her hood had fallen back from her  white face, and her eyes were shining like two stars. She laid her hand  on Ranald's arm, and her voice grew steady as she said: \"Thank God, my  boy, and thank you with all my heart. You risked your life for mine. You  are a brave fellow! I can never forget this!\"    \"Oh, pshaw!\" said Ranald, awkwardly. \"You are better stuff than I am.  You came back with Bugle. And I knew Liz could beat the pony whatever.\"  Then they walked their horses quietly to the stable, and nothing more  was said by either of them; but from that hour Ranald had a friend ready  to offer life for him, though he did not know it then nor till years  afterward.        CHAPTER V    FORGIVE US OUR DEBTS      Macdonald Dubh's farm lay about three miles north and west from the  manse, and the house stood far back from the cross-road in a small  clearing encircled by thick bush. It was a hard farm to clear, the  timber was heavy, the land lay low, and Macdonald Dubh did not make as  much progress as his neighbors in his conflict with the forest. Not but  that he was a hard worker and a good man with the ax, but somehow he did  not succeed as a farmer. It may have been that his heart was more in the  forest than in the farm. He was a famous hunter, and in the deer season  was never to be found at home, but was ever ranging the woods with his  rifle and his great deerhound, Bugle.    He made money at the shanties, but money would not stick to his fingers,  and by the time the summer was over most of his money would be gone,  with the government mortgage on his farm still unlifted. His habits  of life wrought a kind of wildness in him which set him apart from the  thrifty, steady-going people among whom he lived. True, the shanty-men  were his stanch friends and admirers, but then the shanty-men, though  well-doing, could hardly be called steady, except the boss of the  Macdonald gang, Macdonald Bhain, who was a regular attendant and stanch  supporter of the church, and indeed had been spoken of for an elder. But  from the church Macdonald Dubh held aloof. He belonged distinctly to the  \"careless,\" though he could not be called irreligious. He had all the  reverence for \"the Word of God, and the Sabbath day, and the church\"  that characterized his people. All these held a high place in his  esteem; and though he would not presume to \"take the books,\" not being a  member of the church, yet on the Sabbath day when he was at home it was  the custom of the household to gather for the reading of the Word before  breakfast. He would never take his rifle with him through the woods on  the Sabbath, and even when absent from home on a hunting expedition,  when the Sabbath day came round, he religiously kept camp. It is true,  he did not often go to church, and when the minister spoke to him about  this, he always agreed that it was a good thing to go to church. When he  had no better excuse, he would apologize for his absence upon the ground  \"that he had not the clothes.\" The greater part of the trouble was  that he was shy "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3289"],[0,"The Valley of Fear (#7)"],[1,"give my results at my own time--complete rather  than in stages.\"    \"I am sure we are honoured by your presence and to show you all we  know,\" said White Mason cordially. \"Come along, Dr. Watson, and when the  time comes we'll all hope for a place in your book.\"    We walked down the quaint village street with a row of pollarded elms  on each side of it. Just beyond were two ancient stone pillars,  weather-stained and lichen-blotched, bearing upon their summits a  shapeless something which had once been the rampant lion of Capus of  Birlstone. A short walk along the winding drive with such sward and oaks  around it as one only sees in rural England, then a sudden turn, and the  long, low Jacobean house of dingy, liver-coloured brick lay before  us, with an old-fashioned garden of cut yews on each side of it. As we  approached it, there was the wooden drawbridge and the beautiful broad  moat as still and luminous as quicksilver in the cold, winter sunshine.    Three centuries had flowed past the old Manor House, centuries of  births and of homecomings, of country dances and of the meetings of fox  hunters. Strange that now in its old age this dark business should have  cast its shadow upon the venerable walls! And yet those strange, peaked  roofs and quaint, overhung gables were a fitting covering to grim and  terrible intrigue. As I looked at the deep-set windows and the long  sweep of the dull-coloured, water-lapped front, I felt that no more  fitting scene could be set for such a tragedy.    \"That's the window,\" said White Mason, \"that one on the immediate right  of the drawbridge. It's open just as it was found last night.\"    \"It looks rather narrow for a man to pass.\"    \"Well, it wasn't a fat man, anyhow. We don't need your deductions, Mr.  Holmes, to tell us that. But you or I could squeeze through all right.\"    Holmes walked to the edge of the moat and looked across. Then he  examined the stone ledge and the grass border beyond it.    \"I've had a good look, Mr. Holmes,\" said White Mason. \"There is nothing  there, no sign that anyone has landed--but why should he leave any  sign?\"    \"Exactly. Why should he? Is the water always turbid?\"    \"Generally about this colour. The stream brings down the clay.\"    \"How deep is it?\"    \"About two feet at each side and three in the middle.\"    \"So we can put aside all idea of the man having been drowned in  crossing.\"    \"No, a child could not be drowned in it.\"    We walked across the drawbridge, and were admitted by a quaint, gnarled,  dried-up person, who was the butler, Ames. The poor old fellow was white  and quivering from the shock. The village sergeant, a tall, formal,  melancholy man, still held his vigil in the room of Fate. The doctor had  departed.    \"Anything fresh, Sergeant Wilson?\" asked White Mason.    \"No, sir.\"    \"Then you can go home. You've had enough. We can send for you if we  want you. The butler had better wait outside. Tell him to warn Mr. Cecil  Barker, Mrs. Douglas, and the housekeeper that we may want a word with  them presently. Now, gentlemen, perhaps you will allow me to give you  the views I have formed first, and then you will be able to arrive at  your own.\"    He impressed me, this country specialist. He had a solid grip of fact  and a cool, clear, common-sense brain, which should take him some way  in his profession. Holmes listened to him intently, with no sign of that  impatience which the official exponent too often produced.    \"Is it suicide, or is it murder--that's our first question, gentlemen,  is it not? If it were suicide, then we have to believe that this man  began by taking off his wedding ring and concealing it; that he then  came down here in his dressing gown, trampled mud into a corner behind  the curtain in order to give the idea someone had waited for him, opened  the window, put blood on the--\"    \"We can surely dismiss that,\" said MacDonald.    \"So I think. Suicide is out of the question. Then a murder has been  done. What we have to determine is, whether it was done by someone  outside or inside the house.\"    \"Well, let's hear the argument.\"    \"There are considerable difficulties both ways, and yet one or the other  it must be. We will suppose first that some person or persons inside  the house did the crime. They got this man down here at a time when  everything was still and yet no one was asleep. They then did the  deed with the queerest and noisiest weapon in the world so as to tell  everyone what had happened--a weapon that was never seen in the house  before. That does not seem a very likely start, does it?\"    \"No, it does not.\"    \"Well, then, everyone is agreed that after the alarm was given only a  minute at the most had passed before the whole household--not Mr. Cecil  Barker alone, though he claims to have been the first, but Ames and all  of them were on the spot. Do you tell me that in that time the guilty  person managed to make footmarks in the corner, open the window, mark  the sill with blood, take the wedding ring off the dead man's finger,  and all the rest of it? It's impossible!\"    \"You put it very clearly,\" said Holmes. \"I am inclined to agree with  you.\"    \"Well, then, we are driven back to the theory that it was done by  someone from outside. We are still faced with some big difficulties;  but anyhow they have ceased to be impossibilities. The man got into the  house between four-thirty and six; that is to say, between dusk and the  time when the bridge was raised. There had been some visitors, and the  door was open; so there was nothing to prevent him. He may have been  a common burglar, or he may have had some private grudge against Mr.  Douglas. Since Mr. Douglas has spent most of his life in America, and  this shotgun seems to be an American weapon, it would seem that the  private grudge is the more likely theory. He slipped into this room  because it was the first he came to, and he hid behind the curtain.  There he remained until past eleven at night. At that time Mr. Douglas  entered the room. It was a short interview, if there were any interview  at all; for Mrs. Douglas declares that her husband had not left her more  than a few minutes when she heard the shot.\"    \"The candle shows that,\" said Holmes.    \"Exactly. The candle, which was a new one, is not burned more than half  an inch. He must have placed it on the table before he was attacked;  otherwise, of course, it would have fallen when he fell. This shows  that he was not attacked the instant that he entered the room. When Mr.  Barker arrived the candle was lit and the lamp was out.\"    \"That's all clear enough.\"    \"Well, now, we can reconstruct things on those lines. Mr. Douglas  enters the room. He puts down the candle. A man appears from behind the  curtain. He is armed with this gun. He demands the wedding ring--Heaven  only knows why, but so it must have been. Mr. Douglas gave it up. Then  either in cold blood or in the course of a struggle--Douglas may have  gripped the hammer that was found upon the mat--he shot Douglas in  this horrible way. He dropped his gun and also it would seem this queer  card--V.V. 341, whatever that may mean--and he made his escape through  the window and across the moat at the very moment when Cecil Barker was  discovering the crime. How's that, Mr. Holmes?\"    \"Very interesting, but just a little unconvincing.\"    \"Man, it would be absolute nonsense if it wasn't that anything else is  even worse!\" cried MacDonald. \"Somebody killed the man, and whoever it  was I could clearly prove to you that he should have done it some other  way. What does he mean by allowing his retreat to be cut off like that?  What does he mean by using a shotgun when silence was his one chance of  escape? Come, Mr. Holmes, it's up to you to give us a lead, since you  say Mr. White Mason's theory is unconvincing.\"    Holmes had sat intently observant during this long discussion, missing  no word that was said, with his keen eyes darting to right and to left,  and his forehead wrinkled with speculation.    \"I should like a few more facts before I get so far as a theory, Mr.  Mac,\" said he, kneeling down beside the body. \"Dear me! these injuries  are really appalling. Can we have the butler in for a moment?... Ames,  I understand that you have often seen this very unusual mark--a branded  triangle inside a circle--upon Mr. Douglas's forearm?\"    \"Frequently, sir.\"    \"You never heard any speculation as to what it meant?\"    \"No, sir.\"    \"It must have caused great pain when it was inflicted. It is undoubtedly  a burn. Now, I observe, Ames, that there is a small piece of plaster at  the angle of Mr. Douglas's jaw. Did you observe that in life?\"    \"Yes, sir, he cut himself in shaving yesterday morning.\"    \"Did you ever know him to cut himself in shaving before?\"    \"Not for a very long time, sir.\"    \"Suggestive!\" said Holmes. \"It may, of course, be a mere coincidence, or  it may point to some nervousness which would indicate that he had reason  to apprehend danger. Had you noticed anything unusual in his conduct,  yesterday, Ames?\"    \"It struck me that he was a little restless and excited, sir.\"    \"Ha! The attack may not have been entirely unexpected. We do seem to  make a little progress, do we not? Perhaps you would rather do the  questioning, Mr. Mac?\"    \"No, Mr. Holmes, it's in better hands than mine.\"    \"Well, then, we will pass to this card--V.V. 341. It is rough cardboard.  Have you any of the sort in the house?\"    \"I don't think so.\"    Holmes walked across to the desk and dabbed a little ink from each  bottle on to the blotting paper. \"It was not printed in this room,\" he  said; \"this is black ink and the other purplish. It was done by a thick  pen, and these are fine. No, it was done elsewhere, I should say. Can  you make anything of the inscription, Ames?\"    \"No, sir, nothing.\"    \"What do you think, Mr. Mac?\"    \"It gives me the impression of a secret society of some sort; the"]]]
