[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33830"],[0,"Fur Farming (#7)"],[1,"in the extreme northern portions of Canada and Alaska, where  it gives place to the Arctic fox, also they are not found in the far  western states nor on the Pacific coast, being replaced here by the  gray. They are perhaps most abundant in the New England States,  Newfoundland and the eastern provinces of Canada, but are also found in  good numbers in parts of New York, Pennsylvania, Virginia, West Virginia  and the mountainous and hilly sections of the South.    The silver and black foxes are found but rarely in the most northern  tier of states and are probably found in the greatest numbers in  Newfoundland, Labrador, northern Quebec and northern Ontario, but an odd  specimen is occasionally met with in all parts of Canada. They appear  also to be quite plentiful in the interior of Alaska and the Yukon  Province of Canada. The range of the cross fox is the same as that of  the silver and black except that it probably extends somewhat farther  southward into the United States.    Of the gray foxes, several varieties are recognized, all however, being  very much alike. They are found throughout the Southern and South  Central States--in the east being found as far north as Connecticut and  on the Pacific Coast are found in California and Oregon.    The Arctic fox, also known as the blue fox and the white fox, is found  only in northern Canada and Alaska. In the most northern parts of their  range they are a bluish color in summer, changing to white in winter,  but in the lower latitudes they retain the blue color throughout the  year.    There is an immense difference in the value of the various varieties of  foxes. While the fur of the gray variety is seldom worth more than a  dollar or a dollar and a half, that of the fine silver and black foxes  will range from several hundred to a thousand dollars, and more if the  skin is an exceptionally fine one. The Arctic fox comes next in value to  the silver, while the cross is as a rule of less value, depending mostly  on color, and the red variety sells for from three to five dollars each  and upwards for prime skins.    [Illustration: Northwestern Fox Skins--Silver, Cross and Red.]    The various members of the red fox family are practically the same as  regards habits, being influenced to a certain extent by environments,  differences in climate and food, etc., but on the whole very much alike.  They are all of a cunning, wary and suspicious nature and it is owing to  this fact alone that they have been enabled to live and thrive in the  face of the persistent hunting and trapping. They are hardy animals and  while they generally have a den somewhere on the side of a gravelly or  sandy hill, they spend comparatively little of their time in the dens  and prefer to spend the day in a bunch of grass or weeds, a clump of  brush, or, curled up on top of a stump.    In their search for food they sometimes start out quite early in the  evening, but are probably most active in the early morning when all  animal life is on the move. Then it is that the rabbits and other  nocturnal animals are seeking their places of rest and the birds, etc.,  are commencing to move about and the fox stands a better chance of  securing some article of food.    Their food consists principally of small animals and birds, such as  rabbits, partridge, quail, chipmunks and mice, but they also eat fruit,  such as apples, wild grapes and nuts. However, they are more strictly  carnivorous than the gray fox. They are fond of eggs and often rob the  nests of ground building birds, of eggs and young, and in the settled  sections have acquired a decided liking for poultry of all kinds.    The food of the gray fox is practically the same as that of the red  variety but they are more given to eating fruit and feed extensively on  grapes, apples, etc., and in some sections they feed on green corn. All  foxes will eat fish with a relish when they can get them and will refuse  scarcely anything in the line of flesh, being especially fond of  muskrat, skunk and opossum. In captivity they take very kindly to a  vegetable diet.    The Arctic foxes live chiefly on lemmings, small animals which are found  quite plentifully in the far north, but in captivity they thrive on fish  and cooked corn meal.    The mating season of the red fox comes mainly in February and the  beginning of March and the young, from five to eight or nine, are born  in April or early in May. The young of the gray fox are born in May, the  mating season of this species being somewhat later than that of the red  fox. The breeding dens of the fox are usually located on some gravelly  hillside but in places where the country is broken and rocky. They use  natural dens in the rocks. It is only during the breeding season and  while the young foxes are still quite small that these dens are  regularly inhabited. At other times they may spend an occasional day  there or seek safety in the dens when hard pressed by hounds, but for  the most part they prefer to rest out of doors.    Foxes prefer the rough hilly countries and are usually found in good  numbers in the hilly farming sections where there are old pastures and  an occasional patch of woodland. The gray fox is most at home in the  wooded districts but the red species, including the silver, cross and  black prefer the more open stretches of country. In the north they will  be found most plentiful in the barrens and sections where second-growth  timber prevails.    The two species do not appear to be on very friendly terms and not given  to mixing one with the other. In some sections where red foxes were once  numerous and the gray variety were unknown, the grays now predominate,  having driven out the red variety. In other parts the reds have  supplanted the grays. This, however, is only in the central and southern  districts, as the gray fox is never found far north.    FOX FARMING.--Fox farming has been attempted by various parties from  time to time and those who have given the business considerable study  and have persevered have generally been successful. Many of the parties,  however, were men who have had practically no knowledge of nature,  having gone into the business too deeply in the start and being  ignorant of the nature and habits of the animals when found in a wild  state, have as a consequence, failed. Very few of those who have made a  success of breeding the valuable silver foxes have gone into this  business in the start, but have first experimented with the less  valuable red fox, and as the silver and red foxes are of the same  variety their nature and habits are also the same, and the knowledge of  their habits gained by experimenting with one is of equal value as  applied to the other.    The Arctic foxes are being raised successfully on many of the islands  off the coast of Alaska. As the seas never freeze over there, no  enclosures are necessary and the business has proved comparatively easy  from the start. Such islands are not within the reach of the average fox  farmer and other means must be resorted to. The breeding of silver foxes  has, thus far, been carried on mainly in the Canadian Maritime Provinces  and the state of Maine, but it has also been undertaken to some extent  in Michigan, Alaska, Labrador and Newfoundland.    We are certain that if one will give the matter sufficient study, learn  the habits and nature of the animals thoroughly and act accordingly,  success is sure to follow and that the red, cross and silver foxes may  be bred and raised successfully. Experiments should be conducted on a  small scale, for otherwise failure would mean a great loss. We would  advise that the amateur conduct his experiments with red foxes, learning  their habits thoroughly before attempting the breeding of the valuable  silver-gray.    FAVORABLE LOCALITIES.--It is a well known fact that the finest furs are  produced in northern localities and fox farming should not be attempted  in the far south. The accompanying map, which is taken from the bulletin  of the U. S. Department of Agriculture, will show the area most suitable  for silver fox farming. The plainly lined portions show the most  suitable country, and conditions in those parts are most excellent and  the cross-hatched parts show the area where silver fox raising is  possible and conditions favorable. The red fox will do well somewhat  farther south, but as before stated, the warm climate of the south is  detrimental to fine furs, and it will be wise to not locate too far  south of the shaded portions shown on the map.    [Illustration: Map of life zones in which fox farming is feasible in the  United States, showing the Canadian zone where conditions are excellent,  and the Transition zone, in parts of which conditions are favorable.]    Having decided on a favorable section of country the next step is to  find a suitable location. It is not necessary or even advisable to have  a large enclosure. For the beginner a half-acre to an acre will be  sufficient, and a space of four or five acres is ample for extensive  operations. If the enclosure is too large the animals will be wild and  unmanageable, and on the other hand if too small they will become  nervous and restless and will not breed well, and it is advised also  that the foxes be not disturbed by visitors and be allowed to live as  quietly as possible. A sandy soil is recommended, and there should be  some trees for shade, but a thick woods is not desirable.    ENCLOSURES.--Fences should be made of galvanized woven wire of two-inch  mesh,--number 14 or 16 wire being best. The fence should be ten feet in  height and should be sunk in the ground two feet and turned in two feet  at the top. The overhang at the top is easily adjusted by means of cross  strips on the top of the posts. Care in making the fences is essential,  and if there is much snow in winter the drifts must not be allowed to  become high enough to allow the animals to leap"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33852"],[0,"British Butterflies: Figures and Descriptions of Every Native Species (#7)"],[1,"ERFLY.    This is a question often less difficult to answer in words than in action,  for many of our butterflies are gifted not only with strong prejudices  against the inside of a net, but with very strong powers of escaping from  that unpleasant situation. Still, by aid of proper apparatus, a sure eye  and hand, and often, of a good pair of legs, there is no butterfly, however  fleet and wary, that we may not feel ourselves a tolerable match for.    Firstly, then, as to the out-door apparatus required.    This is simple enough, a _net_ and _pocket-boxes_, with a few _pins_, being  the only essentials.[6]    {40}    Variously constructed nets are used, according to fancy, but the choice may  lie between two chief forms: the _Clap-net_ and the _Ring-net_.    [Illustration]    The former certainly gives more power in a fair chase, but the latter has  the advantage of being the {41} lighter, more portable, and less  conspicuous of the two. Both of these instruments are shown in the  accompanying figures.    The clap-net (fig. 1) usually has the sticks that compose the framework  made each in three separate pieces, joined by ferrules--a couple of light  fishing-rods will do excellently, a piece of bent cane being substituted  for the top joint. The manner in which the gauze is extended between, and  fitted on, these rods will be sufficiently obvious on looking at the cut,  which represents the net half open. In taking an insect, one handle is held  in each hand, the net opened wide, and thrown over, or made to intercept  the insect, when, by suddenly closing the handles together, a closed bag is  made, and the little prisoner is secured.    [Illustration]    The ring-net (fig. 2), which is the implement most generally in vogue, may  be constructed in several ways. The cheapest, and at the same time a highly  serviceable one, is made by getting from a tinman a tin \"socket\" of this  form, the larger end fitting on to the end of a straight stick, and the two  smaller tubes receiving the ends of a hoop of cane, which carries the net,  it being passed through a loose hem round the top of the latter. The cane,  taken out of the socket, can be rolled up closely with the net and carried  in the pocket to the scene of action, while the handle may be a strong  common walking-stick, a {42} most useful auxiliary in getting across  country, and thus this net becomes really no incumbrance to the tourist,  who may have other matters in hand besides butterfly hunting--perhaps  sketching and botanizing--when the larger clap-net becomes quite  embarrassing.    Another form of this net has the ring made of _metal_, and _jointed_ in  several places, so as to fold within a small pocketable compass, and  arranged to screw into a brass socket on the top of the stick. This is a  very commendable net--not so easily home-made as the last, certainly, but  it can be readily procured complete from the London dealers (or  \"naturalists,\" as they style themselves).    A net that has been a good deal used of late opens and shuts on the  umbrella principle, and with the same celerity, forming a ring-net when  open--when shut going into a case like that of an umbrella.    Some entomologists, nervously sensitive to public opinion, are, however,  somewhat shy of sporting these umbrella nets, for should rain perchance  come down while he is on the road, the villagers may be astonished at the  insane spectacle of a man scuttling along through the torrent and getting  drenched through, while he carries a good-looking umbrella carefully under  his arm for fear it should get wet; and if, on the other hand, the weather  be fine, the carrying such a protective would seem an equally eccentric  whim. But only the _very_ thin-skinned would be driven from the use of a  good weapon by such a harmless contingency as I have here supposed. {43}    Other necessary equipments for the fly-catcher are two or three _light  wooden boxes_, as large as can conveniently be carried in the pockets, and  having either the bottom, or, if deep enough, both bottom and top lined  with a layer of _cork_, about one-eighth of an inch in thickness.    A pin-cushion, well furnished with _entomological pins_, should also be  carried, and will be found to be most accessible when suspended by a loop  and button (or otherwise) inside the breast of the coat.    The pins here mentioned, which are an important item among  butterfly-collecting requisites, are of a peculiar manufacture--very  small-headed, long and thin, but strong. Any good London dealer will supply  them on application, or send them by post into the country.    Armed with the above simple _paraphernalia_, viz. net to catch, boxes and  pins to contain and detain, the insect hunter may sally forth on any fine  summer's day, with a pretty sure prospect of sport, and the chance, at  least, of a prize. Much depends, however, on the choice of a day, and the  nature of the locality that is to form the hunting ground.    As to weather, it must be remembered that winged insects have a great  objection to face a north, or north-east wind, during the prevalence of  which you will probably find hardly one stirring, however prolific the  locality may at other times be.    Butterflies, as a rule, do not appear to be at all {44} influenced by an  eye for the picturesque and romantic in the choice of their favourite  haunts. Often have I been disappointed in this way, finding a delicious  spot, basking in sunshine, and bedight with all manner of flowers such as a  butterfly loves, yet with scarcely a stray butterfly to enliven it; while,  on the other hand, a piece of the most unpromising flat waste land will be  all alive with insect beauty. Those, for example, who would see those  splendid creatures, the Swallow-tail butterfly and the large Copper (if  this exists with us at all now), must go to the dreary fen districts that  form their almost exclusive haunts.    It is, in fact, very hard to say what influences bring a swarm of  butterflies together, to populate one particular spot, to the utter neglect  of others close at hand, and, to all appearance, just as eligible.    Some species are most remarkable for their excessive _localness_ (as it is  called), or, limiting their range to an exceedingly small circumscribed  space; so much so, that some rare species have been known to haunt just one  corner of one particular field, year after year, while not a single  specimen could be found in all the neighbouring fields, though precisely  similar, to all appearance. This phenomenon is quite inexplicable with  regard to insects endowed so pre-eminently with locomotive powers as  butterflies are.    The local nature of his game should, however, induce the collector to leave  no nook or corner unexplored when he is \"working\" a district; as the  passing over (or rather, neglecting to _pass over_) a single field may lose  him the very species it would joy him most to find.    [Illustration: VII.]    {45}    I would also advise the beginner--and, indeed, all but the very experienced  hands--to catch, not necessarily for slaughter, but for inspection, every  attainable individual whose species he cannot positively declare to when on  the wing, lest he pass by some rarities unawares. Thus the valued Queen of  Spain, and the much-disputed _Dia_ Fritillaries, the _Melitaeas_, the Brown  Hair-streak, and (on the mountains) the rare _Erebias_, perhaps some new to  this country,--any of these might be mistaken by a novice for some of the  commoner brown species. Among the \"Whites,\" too, the Black-veined White,  that great prize, the Bath White, and the white varieties of the Clouded  Yellow and Clouded Sulphur, might share the same fate, or fortune rather,  of being reckoned as \"Cabbage Whites.\"    Then, with the \"Blues.\" Who is there that could at once distinguish with  certainty the very rare Mazarine Blue (_P. Acis_) from the common Blues  when on the wing? Perhaps it would turn out to be less rare than supposed,  if all the Blues in a fresh locality were netted as they came near, and set  at liberty after passing muster.    Why, only last season a very curious Blue,[7] never before observed in this  country, was captured near {46} Brighton by a collector, who, at the  moment, thought it was only a Common Blue, so precisely similar did it look  when flying.    As to the manipulation of the net, it will be better to leave the young  collector to find that out for himself, which, if he has the use of his  hands, he will quickly do when he gets into the field. He will soon  perceive that with most of the swifter butterflies, it is of no use to make  a rush at them. A surprise answers better than a charge; for they easily  take alarm at open violence, and then go off straight ahead at a pace that  renders pursuit, over bad ground especially, most trying, if not hopeless  work. So the \"_suaviter in modo_\" principle is best here as  elsewhere:--gently follow up and watch your butterfly till he pauses over  or settles upon a flower, or whatever it may be; then, with caution, you  can generally come within striking distance without giving alarm, and one  vigorous, well-aimed stroke usually settles the matter; if, after that, he  is outside of your net instead of in, you will find it a difficult matter  to get another chance, at least, with most of the larger and strong-flying  kinds. But there is much diversity of disposition among these creatures,  and some are unscared by repeated attacks. These points of character the  collector will soon learn when he has been among these lively little people  for a season.    The different species have also their own favourite positions, on which  they delight to perch.    Thus the Clouded Yellow loves the low flowers of {47} the railway-bank and  the down; often seen toying with a breeze-rocked flower as yellow-coated as  himself, as though he had mistaken it, in its fluttering, for one of his  mates.
