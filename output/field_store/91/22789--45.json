Each of these  stars, or suns, besides, may be the centre of a system similar to what  we call our solar system, comprising planets and satellites, comets and  meteors;--or perchance indeed some further variety of attendant bodies  of which we have no example in our tiny corner of space. But as to  whether one is right in a conjecture of this kind, there is up to the  present no proof whatever. No telescope has yet shown a planet in  attendance upon one of these distant suns; for such bodies, even if they  do exist, are entirely out of the range of our mightiest instruments. On  what then can we ground such an assumption? Merely upon analogy; upon  the common-sense deduction that as the stars have characteristics  similar to our particular star, the sun, it would seem unlikely that  ours should be the only such body in the whole of space which is  attended by a planetary system.    \"The Stars,\" using that expression in its most general sense, do not lie  at one fixed distance from us, set here and there upon a background of  sky. There is in fact no background at all. The brilliant orbs are all  around us in space, at different distances from us and from each other;  and we can gaze between them out into the blackness of the void which,  perhaps, continues to extend unceasingly long after the very outposts of  the stellar universe has been left behind. Shall we then start our  imaginary express train once more, and send it out towards the nearest  of the stars? This would, however, be a useless experiment. Our  express-train method of gauging space would fail miserably in the  attempt to bring home to us the mighty gulf by which we are now faced.  Let us therefore halt for a moment and look back upon the orders of  distance with which we have been dealing. First of all we dealt with  thousands of miles. Next we saw how they shrank into insignificance when  we embarked upon millions. We found, indeed, that our sixty-mile-an-hour  train, rushing along without ceasing, would consume nearly the whole of  historical time in a journey from the sun to Neptune.    In the spaces beyond the solar system we are faced, however, by a new  order of distance. From sun to planets is measured in millions of miles,  but from sun to sun is measured in billions. But does the mere stating  of this fact convey anything? I fear not. For the word \"billion\" runs as  glibly off the tongue as \"million,\" and both are so wholly unrealisable  by us that the actual difference between them might easily pass  unnoticed.    Let us, however, make a careful comparison. What is a million? It is a  thousand thousands. But what is a billion? It is a million millions.  Consider for a moment! A million of millions. That means a million, each  unit of which is again a million. In fact every separate \"1\" in this  million is itself a million. Here is a way of trying to realise this  gigantic number. A million seconds make only eleven and a half days and  nights. But a billion seconds will make actually more than thirty  thousand years!    Having accepted this, let us try and probe with our express train even a  little of the new gulf which now lies before us. At our old rate of  going it took almost two years to cover a million miles. To cover a  billion miles--that is to say, a million times this distance--would thus  take of course nearly two million years. Alpha Centauri, the nearest  star to our earth, is some twenty-five billions of miles away. Our  express train would thus take about fifty millions of years to reach it!    This shows how useless our illustration, appropriate though it seemed  for interplanetary space, becomes when applied to the interstellar  spaces. It merely gives us millions in return for billions; and so the  mind, driven in upon itself, whirls round and round like a squirrel in  its revolving cage. There is, however, a useful illustration still left  us, and it is the one which astronomers usually employ in dealing with  the distances of the stars. The illustration in question is taken from  the velocity of light.    Light travels at the tremendous speed of about 186,000 miles a second.  It therefore takes only about a second and a quarter to come to us from  the moon. It traverses the 93,000,000 of miles which separate us from  the sun in about eight minutes. It travels from the sun out to Neptune  in about four hours, which means that it would cross the solar system  from end to end in eight. To pass, however, across the distance which  separates us from Alpha Centauri it would take so long as about four  and a quarter years!    Astronomers, therefore, agree in estimating the distances of the stars  from the point of view of the time which light would take to pass from  them to our earth. They speak of that distance which light takes a year  to traverse as a \"light year.\" According to this notation, Alpha  Centauri is spoken of as being about four and a quarter light years  distant from us.    Now as the rays of light coming from Alpha Centauri to us are chasing  one another incessantly across the gulf of space, and as each ray left  that star some four years before it reaches us, our view of the star  itself must therefore be always some four years old. Were then this star  to be suddenly removed from the universe at any moment, we should  continue to see it still in its place in the sky for some four years  more, after which it would suddenly disappear. The rays which had  already started upon their journey towards our earth must indeed  continue travelling, and reaching us in their turn until the last one  had arrived; after which no more would come.    We have drawn attention to Alpha Centauri as the nearest of the stars.  The majority of the others indeed are ever so much farther. We can only  hazard a guess at the time it takes for the rays from many of them to  reach our globe. Suppose, for instance, we see a sudden change in the  light of any of these remote stars, we are inclined to ask ourselves  when that change did actually occur. Was it in the days of Queen  Elizabeth, or at the time of the Norman Conquest; or was it when Rome  was at the height of her glory, or perhaps ages before that when the  Pyramids of Egypt were being built? Even the last of these suppositions  cannot be treated lightly. We have indeed no real knowledge of the  distance from us of those stars which our giant telescopes have brought  into view out of the depths of the celestial spaces.          CHAPTER VI    CELESTIAL MEASUREMENT      Had the telescope never been invented our knowledge of astronomy would  be trifling indeed.    Prior to the year 1610, when Galileo first turned the new instrument  upon the sky, all that men knew of the starry realms was gathered from  observation with their own eyes unaided by any artificial means. In such  researches they had been very much at a disadvantage. The sun and moon,  in their opinion, were no doubt the largest bodies in the heavens, for  the mere reason that they looked so! The mighty solar disturbances,  which are now such common-places to us, were then quite undreamed of.  The moon displayed a patchy surface, and that was all; her craters and  ring-mountains were surprises as yet in store for men. Nothing of course  was known about the surfaces of the planets. These objects had indeed no  particular characteristics to distinguish them from the great host of  the stars, except that they continually changed their positions in the  sky while the rest did not. The stars themselves were considered as  fixed inalterably upon the vault of heaven. The sun, moon, and planets  apparently moved about in the intermediate space, supported in their  courses by strange and fanciful devices. The idea of satellites was as  yet unknown. Comets were regarded as celestial portents, and meteors as  small conflagrations taking place in the upper air.    In the entire absence of any knowledge with regard to the actual sizes  and distances of the various celestial bodies, men naturally considered  them as small; and, concluding that they were comparatively near,  assigned to them in consequence a permanent connection with terrestrial  affairs. Thus arose the quaint and erroneous beliefs of astrology,  according to which the events which took place upon our earth were  considered to depend upon the various positions in which the planets,  for instance, found themselves from time to time.    It must, however, be acknowledged that the study of astrology,  fallacious though its conclusions were, indirectly performed a great  service to astronomy by reason of the accurate observations and diligent  study of the stars which it entailed.    We will now inquire into the means by which the distances and sizes of  the celestial orbs have been ascertained, and see how it was that the  ancients were so entirely in the dark in this matter.    There are two distinct methods of finding out the distance at which any  object happens to be situated from us.    One method is by actual measurement.    The other is by moving oneself a little to the right or left, and  observing whether the distant object appears in any degree altered in  position by our own change of place.    One of the best illustrations of this relative change of position which  objects undergo as a result of our own change of place, is to observe  the landscape from the window of a moving railway carriage. As we are  borne rapidly along we notice that the telegraph posts which are set  close to the line appear to fly past us in the contrary direction; the  trees, houses, and other things beyond go by too, but not so fast;  objects a good way off displace slowly; while some spire, or tall  landmark, in the far distance appears to remain unmoved during a  comparatively long time.    Actual change of position on our own part is found indeed to be  invariably accompanied by an apparent displacement of the objects about  us, such"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28572"],[0,"Letters on an Elk Hunt (#7)"],[1," once began planning our work. Daniel helped with the dishes and  as soon as they were done brought out his cloth. He had a heap of  it,--a bolt of checked gingham, enough blue chambray for half a dozen  bonnets, and a great many remnants which he said he had bought from  peddlers from time to time. Mrs. O'Shaughnessy selected what she said  we would begin on, and dampened it so as to shrink it by morning. We  then spread our beds and made ready for an early start next day.    Next morning we ate breakfast by the light of the lamp that smoked for  the sake of companionship, and then started to cut out our work.  Daniel and Mr. Stewart went fishing, and we packed their lunch so as  to have them out of the way all day. I undertook the making of the  bonnet, because I knew how, and because I can remember the kind my  mother wore; I reckoned Daniel's mother would have worn about the  same style. Mrs. O'Shaughnessy and Elizabeth can both cross-stitch, so  they went out to Daniel's granary and ripped up some grain-bags, in  order to get the thread with which they were sewed, to work one apron  in cross-stitch.    But when we were ready to sew we were dismayed, for there was no  machine. Mrs. O'Shaughnessy, however, was of the opinion that _some  one_ in the country must have a sewing machine, so she saddled a horse  and went out, she said, to \"beat the brush.\"    She was hardly out of sight before a man rode up and said there had  been a telephone message saying that Mrs. Holt had arrived in Rock  Springs, and was on her way as far as Newfork in an automobile. That  threw Elizabeth and myself into a panic. We posted the messenger off  on a hunt for Daniel. Elizabeth soon got over her flurry and went at  her cross-stitching. I hardly knew what to do, but acting from force  of habit, I reckon, I began cleaning. A powerfully good way to reason  out things sometimes is to work; and just then I had to work. I began  on the storeroom, which was well lighted and which was also used as a  pantry. As soon as I began straightening up I began to wonder where  the mother would sleep. By arranging things in the storeroom a little  differently, I was able to make room for a bed and a trunk. I decided  on putting Daniel there; so then I began work in earnest. Elizabeth  laid down her work and helped me. We tacked white cheesecloth over the  wall, and although the floor was clean, we scrubbed it to freshen it.  We polished the window until it sparkled. We were right in the middle  of our work when Mrs. O'Shaughnessy came, and Daniel with her.    They were all excitement, but Mrs. O'Shaughnessy is a real general  and soon marshaled her forces. Daniel had to go to Newfork after his  mother; that would take three days. Mrs. O'Shaughnessy pointed out  to him the need of a few pieces of furniture; so he took a wagon and  team, which he got a neighbor to drive, while he took another team  and a buggy for his mother. Newfork is a day's drive beyond Pinedale,  and the necessary furniture could be had in Pinedale; so the neighbor  went along and brought back a new bed, a rocker, and some rugs. But  of course he had to stay overnight. I was for keeping right on  house-cleaning; but as Mrs. O'Shaughnessy had arranged for us all to  come and sew that afternoon at a near-by house, we took our sewing and  clambered into the buckboard and set out.    We found Mrs. Bonham a pleasant little woman whose husband had earned  her pretty new machine by chewing tobacco. I reckon you think that is  a mighty funny method of earning anything, but some tobacco has tags  which are redeemable, and the machine was one of the premiums. Mrs.  Bonham just beamed with pride as she rolled out her machine. \"I never  had a machine before,\" she explained. \"I just went to the neighbors'  when I had to sew. So of course I wanted a machine awfully bad. So  Frank jest chawed and chawed, and I saved every tag till we got  enough, and last year we got the machine. Frank is chawin' out a clock  now; but that won't take him so long as the machine did.\"    Well, the \"chawed-out\" machine did splendidly, and we turned out  some good work that afternoon. I completed the blue bonnet which was  to be used as \"best,\" and made a \"splint\" bonnet. Mrs. O'Shaughnessy  and Elizabeth did well on their aprons. We took turns about at the  machine and not a minute was wasted. Mrs. Bonham showed us some crochet  lace which she said she hoped to sell; and right at once Mrs.  O'Shaughnessy's fertile mind begin to hatch plans. She would make Mrs.  Holt a \"Sunday apron,\" she said, and she bought the lace to trim it  with. I thought Mrs. Holt must be an old-fashioned lady who liked  pillow-shams. Mrs. Bonham had a pretty pair she was willing to sell.  On one was worked, \"Good Morning\"; on the other, \"Good Night\"; it was  done with red cotton. The shams had a dainty edge of homemade lace.  Elizabeth would not be outdone; she purchased a star quilt pieced in  red and white. At sundown we went home. We were all tired, but as soon  as supper was over we went to work again. We took down the bed and set  it up in Dan's new quarters, and we made such headway on what had been  his bedroom that we knew we could finish in a little while next day.    The next morning, as soon as we had breakfasted, Mrs. O'Shaughnessy  and Elizabeth went back to sew, taking with them a lot of white  cheesecloth for lining for the bedroom we were preparing for Mrs.  Holt. Mr. Stewart had had fine luck fishing, but he said he felt plumb  left out with so much bustling about and he not helping. He is very  handy with a saw and hammer, and he contrived what we called a \"chist  of drawers,\" for Daniel's room. The \"chist\" had only one drawer; into  that we put all the gloves, ties, handkerchiefs, and suspenders, and  on the shelves below we put his shoes and boots. Then I made a blue  curtain for the \"chist\" and one for the window, and the room looked  plumb nice, I can tell you. I liked the \"chist\" so well that I asked  Mr. Stewart to make something of the kind for Mrs. Holt's room. He  said there wouldn't be time, but he went to work on it.    Promptly at noon Mrs. O'Shaughnessy and Elizabeth came with the lining  for the room. We worked like beavers, and had the room sweet and ready  by mid-afternoon, when the man came from Pinedale with the new  furniture. In just a little while we had the room in perfect order:  the bed nicely made with soft, new blankets for sheets; the pretty  star quilt on, and the nice, clean pillows protected by the shams.  They could buy no rugs, but a weaver of rag carpets in Pinedale had  some pieces of carpet which Daniel sent back to us. They were really  better and greatly more in keeping. We were very proud of the pretty  white and red room when we were through. Only the kitchen was left,  but we decided we could clean that early next day; so we sat down to  sew and to plan the next day's dinner. We could hear Mr. Stewart out  in the barn hammering and sawing on the \"chist.\"    While we were debating whether to have fried chicken or trout for  dinner, two little girls, both on one horse, rode up. They entered  shyly, and after carefully explaining to us that they had heard that a  wagon-load of women were buying everything they could see, had run Mr.  Holt off, and were living in his house, they told us they had come to  sell us some blueing. When they got two dollars' worth sold, the  blueing company would send them a big doll; so, please, would we buy a  lot?    We didn't think we could use any blueing, but we hated to disappoint  the little things. We talked along, and presently they told us of  their mother's flowers. Daniel had told us his mother _always_ had a  red flower in her kitchen window. When the little girls assured us  their mother had a red geranium in bloom, Mrs. O'Shaughnessy set out  to get it; and about dark she returned with a beautiful plant just  beginning to bloom. We were all as happy as children; we had all  worked very hard, too. Mr. Stewart said we deserved no sympathy  because we cleaned a perfectly clean house; but, anyway, we felt much  better for having gone over it.    The \"chist\" was finished early next morning. It would have looked  better, perhaps, if it had had a little paint, but as we had no paint  and were short of time, we persuaded ourselves it looked beautiful  with only its clean, pretty curtain. We didn't make many changes in  the kitchen. All we did was to take down the mirror and turn it  lengthways above the mantel-shelf over the fireplace. We put the new  rocker in the bright, sunny corner, where it would be easier for dim  old eyes to see to read or sew. We set the geranium on the broad clean  sill of the window, and I think you would have agreed with us that it  was a cozy, cheerful home to come to after fifteen years of lonely  homelessness. We couldn't get the dinner question settled, so we  \"dished in dirty-face\"; each cooked what she thought best. Like  Samantha Ann Allen, we had \"everything good and plenty of it.\"    Elizabeth took a real interest and worked well. She is the _dearest_  girl and would be a precious daughter to some mother. She has not yet  told us anything about herself. All we know is, she taught school  somewhere in the East. She was a little surprised at the way we took  possession of a stranger's home, but she enjoyed it as much as we. \"It  is so nice to be doing something for some one again, something real  homey and family-like,\" she remarked as she laid the table for dinner.    We had dinner almost ready when we heard the wheels crossing the mossy  log bridge. We raced to let down the bars. Beside Daniel sat a dear  dumpy little woman, her head very much bundled up with a lot of old  black veils. Daniel drove through the corral, into the yard, and  right up to the door. He helped her out _so_ gently. She kept  admonishing him, \"Careful, Danyul, careful.\" He handed out her crutch  and helped her into the kitchen, where"]]]
