Annealing is carried out by  subjecting the article to a temperature just below the softening point  of the glass, maintaining that temperature until the whole article has  become heated through the thicker part, and then reducing the  temperature very gradually; thus avoiding any marked cooling of the  thinner and outer parts first.    For thin glass apparatus of the lamp-blown or blowpipe-made variety in  which there are no marked difference of thickness, such as joins on  tubes, ordinary seals, bulbs, etc., there is little need for annealing;  and even those having rather marked changes of thickness, such as  filter pumps, can be annealed sufficiently by taking care that the last  step in making is heating to just below visible redness in the blowpipe  flame and then rotating in a sooty gas flame until covered with a  deposit of carbon. The article should then be allowed to cool in a place  free from draughts and where the hot glass will not come in contact with  anything.    A few of the blowpipe-made articles, such, for example, as glass  stopcocks, need more careful annealing, and for this purpose a small  sheet-iron oven which can be heated to dull redness over a collection of  gas burners will serve. Better still, a small clay muffle can be used.  In either case, the article to be annealed should be laid on a clean,  smooth, fireclay surface, the temperature should be maintained at a very  dull red for two or three hours and then reduced steadily until the oven  is cold. This cooling should take anything from three to twelve hours,  according to the nature of the article to be annealed. A thick article,  or one having great irregularities in thickness will need much longer  annealing than one thinner or more regular. As a rule, soda-glass will  need more annealing than lead-glass.    _Drilling Glass._--Small holes may be drilled in glass by means of a rod  of hard steel which has been broken off, thus giving a more or less  irregular and crystalline end.    There are several conditions necessary to enable the drilling of small  holes to be carried out successfully:--the first of these is that the  \"drill\" should be driven at a high speed. This may be done by means of a  geared hand-drill such as the American pattern drill, although a  somewhat higher speed than this will give is even more satisfactory. The  second condition is that the pressure on the drill is neither too light  nor too heavy; this is conveniently regulated by hand. The third  condition is that the drill be prevented from \"straying\" over the  surface of the glass; for this purpose a small metal guide is useful.  The fourth condition is that a suitable lubricant be used; a strong  solution of camphor in oil of turpentine is perhaps the most suitable.  For commercial work, a diamond drill is often used, but this is scarcely  necessary for the occasional work of a laboratory.    _Larger Holes in Glass._--The method of drilling with a hard steel rod  is not highly satisfactory for anything but small holes. When a larger  hole, say one of an eighth of an inch or more, is needed it is better to  use a copper or brass tube. This tube may be held in an American  hand-drill, but a mixture of carborundum or emery and water is supplied  to the rotating end. Tube or drill must be lifted at frequent intervals  in order to allow a fresh supply of the grinding material to reach the  end. In this case, also, a guide is quite essential in the early stages  of drilling; otherwise the end of the tube will stray. The speed of  cutting may be increased slightly by making a number of radial slots in  the end of the tube; these serve to hold a supply of the grinding  material.    _Grinding Lenses._--This is scarcely within the scope of a book on  glass-blowing for laboratory purposes, but it may be said that the lens  may be ground by means of a permutating mould of hard lead or  type-metal. The rough shaping is done with coarse carborundum or emery,  and successive stages are carried on with finer and finer material. The  last polishing is by the use of jewellers' rouge on the mould, now  lined with a fine textile.    _Filing Glass._--If a new file, thoroughly lubricated with a solution of  camphor in oil of turpentine, is used, there is but little difficulty in  filing the softer glasses. A slow movement of the file, without  excessive pressure but without allowing the file to slip, is desirable.  After a time the cutting edges of the file teeth will wear down and it  will be necessary to replace the file by another.    _Grinding Stoppers._--This is, perhaps, the most common form of grinding  that the laboratory worker will need to perform, and for that reason,  rather full details of the procedure are desirable.    A very crude form of ground-in stopper may be made by drawing out the  neck and the mass of glass which is intended to form the stopper to  approximately corresponding angles, wetting the surfaces with a mixture  of the abrasive material and water, and grinding the stopper in by hand.  Frequent lifting of the stopper is necessary during grinding, in order  to allow fresh supplies of abrasive material to reach the contacts. When  an approximate fit is obtained, the coarse abrasive should be washed  off, care being taken that the washing is complete, and a finer abrasive  substituted. After a while, this is replaced in its turn by a still  finer grinding material.    Such a method of grinding may give a satisfactory stoppering if the  angles of the plug and socket correspond very closely before grinding is  commenced; but if there is a wide difference in the original angles,  then no amount of grinding by this method will produce a good result.  The reason for this is that the plug will become so worn in the  preliminary grinding as to assume the form of a highly truncated cone;  the socket will assume a reverse form, and the end result will be a  loose-fitting plug and socket.    Satisfactory grinding may be carried out by the use of copper or  type-metal cones for the preliminary shaping. Such cones should be  mounted on a mandrel which will fit into the chuck of the American  hand-drill and turned on the lathe to the desirable angle for  stoppering. A number of these cones will be necessary. A number of  similar moulds, that is to say blocks of type-metal or hard lead in  which is a hole corresponding in size and angle to the plug desired,  should be made also. These must be rotated, either in the lathe or by  other means, and are used for the preliminary shaping of the plug. If  but few plugs are to be ground it is unnecessary to provide a means of  rotating the moulds, as the plug may be held in the hand and ground into  the mould in a manner similar to that used in the first method of  stoppering.    [Illustration: Fig. 14]    When the socket and plug have been ground, by the successive use of  cones and moulds, to the desired angle, so that they correspond almost  exactly, the plug is given its final fitting into the socket by  grinding-in with a fine abrasive, in the manner first described.    _Stopcocks._--Although it would be more strictly in keeping with the  form of this book to divide the making of stopcocks into two parts;  shaping by heat and grinding, we will consider the whole operation here,  and take for our example a simple stopcock such as that illustrated by  Fig. 14.    The \"blank,\" _f_, that is the socket before grinding, is made by drawing  out a piece of fairly thick-walled tubing into the form shown by _a_.  Two zones on this tube are then heated by means of a small, pointed  flame, and the tube is compressed along its axis, thus producing two  raised rings as shown by _b_. Two zones, slightly towards the outer  sides of these two raised rings are heated and the tube is drawn while  air pressure is maintained within. This produces two thin-walled bulbs  or extensions similar to those shown by _c_. One of these extensions is  now broken off by means of a sharp blow with the edge of a file or  other piece of metal, and the edges of the broken glass are rounded in  the flame. The other extension is left to serve as a handle. We have now  a piece of glass like that shown by _d_. Now heat a spot on the side of  this, medially between the raised rings, until the glass is on the point  of becoming deformed, and bring the intensely heated end of a smaller  tube in contact with the heated spot. Without disturbing the relative  positions of the two tubes, press the smaller tube down on a thin steel  wire, so that the wire passes along the tube and enters the soft glass;  thus forming a projection inside the sockets as shown by _e_. The wire  must be withdrawn, again immediately. When the wire has been withdrawn,  heat the place where it entered to dull redness, in order to relieve any  strain; break off the thin extension, which up to the present has served  as a handle, round off the broken edges in the flame, and join on and  indent a similar piece of small tubing to the opposite side of the  socket; the socket at this stage being shown by _f_. The \"blank\" for the  socket is now completed, but it must be heated to dull redness in order  to relieve strain and be placed in an annealing oven, where it should  be annealed for some hours.    The \"blank\" for the plug offers no special difficulty; it is made by  heating a glass rod and compressing it axially until a mass having the  form shown by _g_, Fig. 14, is produced; the end of this is heated  intensely and brought in contact with the rather less heated side of a  glass tube which has been drawn to the shape desired for the handle;  when contact is made a slight air pressure is maintained in the glass  tube, thus producing a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32974"],[0,"The Elements of Blowpipe Analysis (#7)"],[1,", subadamantine.
