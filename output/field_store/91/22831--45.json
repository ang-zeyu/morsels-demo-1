[Music: THE TRUE LOVERS' FAREWELL    Old English]    The pattern of this song, in the Aeolian mode, is A, A, A, B. Unity is  secured by the three-fold appearance of the first phrase; and a  certain balance, by having the second phrase B twice as long (four  measures) as A.    [Music: THE SHIP IN DISTRESS    Old English]    The formula of this characteristic song in the Dorian mode is A, A, B,  A; merely an extension, through repetition, of the simple type A, B, A  which, in turn, is the basis of the fundamental structure known as the  three-part form. This will later be studied in detail. It is evident  to the musical sense how complete a feeling of coherence is gained by  the return to A after the intervening contrast of the phrase B;  evident, also, that this song is a perfect example of the principle of  unity combined with variety.    We further cite a few examples from Scottish, Irish, French, Hungarian  and Russian sources. They all illustrate quaint melodic intervals and  an instinct for balance and symmetry.    [Music: WANDERING WILLIE        Here awa', there awa', Wanderin' Willie,      Here awa', there awa', haud awa' hame.      Come to my bosom, my ain only dearie,      O tell me thou bring'st me my Willie the same.]    This song[28] expresses that note of pathos often found in Scottish  folk-music and is noteworthy also because the lyric poet, Robert  Burns, wrote for it words of which we give the first stanza.    [Footnote 28: The example quoted, together with others equally  beautiful, may be found in the collection edited by the Scottish  composer, Hamish MacCunn. See, as well, the _Cycle of Old Scotch  Melodies_ arranged for four solo voices with pianoforte accompaniment  by Arthur Whiting.]    [Music: WOULD GOD I WERE THE TENDER APPLE BLOSSOM]    This Irish tune[29] is certainly one of the most perfect that can be  imagined, remarkable alike for its organic unity, gained by the  frequent use of the first ascending motive, and for the manner in  which the successive crises are reached. Note in particular the  intensity of the final climax, in measure 13, attained by a repetition  of the preceding phrase.    [Footnote 29: For Irish folk-songs the best collections are the one by  Villiers Stanford and a _Cycle_ by Arthur Whiting, prepared in the  same way as that just cited on Scottish melodies.]    [Music: EN PASSANT PAR LA LORRAINE AVEC MES SABOTS]    This charming song[30] from Lorraine exemplifies that rhythmic  vivacity and lightness of touch so characteristic of the French.    [Footnote 30: Taken from an excellent collection of _Chansons  Populaires_ edited by Julien Tiersot.]    Observe the piquant effect, in the final phrase, produced by the  elision of a measure; there being in the whole song 31 measures  instead of the normal 32 (16 + 16).    [Music: Old Hungarian Folk-song]    Hungarian folk-music[31] is noted for its syncopated rhythm and its  peculiar metric groupings. It is also often highly embroidered with  chromatic notes; the Hungarian scale, with _two_ augmented intervals,  being an intensification of our minor mode, _e.g._    [Music]    [Footnote 31: The best popular collection of Hungarian melodies is  that by Francis Korbay, the texts for which were translated and  arranged by the American novelist, J.S. of Dale. It is well known what  artistic use has been made of Hungarian melodies and rhythms by  Schubert, Liszt and Brahms.]    Russia is fortunate in her musical inheritance; for not only has she a  wealth of folk-songs, but her famous composers, Balakireff, Borodin  and Rimsky-Korsakoff--who are men of letters as well--have published  remarkable editions of these national melodies. The Russian folk-songs  express, in general, a mood of sombreness or even depression--typical  of the vast, bleak expanses of that country, and of its downtrodden  people. These songs are usually in the minor mode--often with sudden  changes of rhythm--and based on the old ecclesiastical modes, the  Russian liturgy being very ancient and having an historical connection  with that of the Greek church. The folk-music of no nation is more  endowed with individuality and depth of emotion. Five characteristic  examples are herewith cited:    [Music: I]    [Music: II]    [Music: III Harmonized by RIMSKY-KORSAKOFF]    [Music: IV]    [Music: V]    This last melody is of particular significance, because Tchaikowsky  has used it so prominently in the Finale of his Fourth Symphony.    The growing interest in folk-music in America is a tendency concerning  which the progressive student should inform himself. For a national  basis of creative work, our country has always been at a disadvantage  in comparison with nations which, as their birthright, have much music  in their blood. Moreover, with the exception of the tunes of the  aboriginal Indians and the plantation melodies of the Negroes, it has  been asserted that America could boast no folk-songs. Recent  investigations have shown, however, that this is not entirely true.  Cecil Sharp, Henry Gilbert, Arthur Farwell and other musical scholars  have proved that there are several regions of our country, settled by  colonists from England, Ireland and Scotland, where folk-songs exist  practically in the condition in which they were first brought over.  One of the best collections of such material is the set of so-called  _Lonesome Tunes from the Kentucky Mountains_, taken down by Miss  Lorraine Wyman and Mr. Howard Brockway directly from the mountaineers  and other dwellers in that region. These melodies have great  individuality, directness and no little poetic charm. It is certainly  encouraging to feel that, in this industrial age, there are still  places where people express their emotions and ideals in song; for a  nation that has not learned to sing--or has forgotten how--can never  create music that endures.          CHAPTER III    POLYPHONIC MUSIC; SEBASTIAN BACH      We have traced, in the preceding chapter, some of the fundamental  principles of design in musical expression, as they were manifested in  the Folk-music of the different nations. All music of this type was  homophonic, _i.e._, a single melodic line, either entirely  unaccompanied or with a slight amount of instrumental support. Hence  however perfect in itself, it was necessarily limited in scope and in  opportunity for organic development. Before music could become an  independent art, set free from reliance on poetry, and could attain to  a breadth of expression commensurate with the growth in other fields  of art, there had to be established some principle of development, far  more extensive than could be found in Folk-music. This principle[32]  of \"Thematic Development\"--the chief idiom of instrumental music--by  which a motive or a theme is expanded into a large symphonic movement,  was worked out in that type of music known as the Polyphonic or  many-voiced; and Polyphonic music became, in turn, the point of  departure for our modern system of harmony, with its methods of key  relationship and of modulation. As we have stated in Chapter I, the  principle of systematic repetition or imitation--first discovered and  partially applied by the musicians[33] of the early French School and  by the Netherland masters--finally culminated in the celebrated vocal  works (a capella or unaccompanied) composed by Palestrina and his  contemporaries for the Roman Catholic Liturgy. Up to this point the  whole texture of music had been conceived in connection with voices;  but with the development of the organ, so admirably suited for  polyphonic style, and the perfection of the family of stringed  instruments, the principles of polyphony were carried over and applied  to instrumental treatment. The composer who, through his constructive  genius, most fully embodied these principles[34] was John Sebastian  Bach (1685-1750). We are now prepared to explain the characteristics  of polyphonic music and then to analyze some typical examples from  Bach and other polyphonic composers. The essential difference between  homophonic and polyphonic style is implied by the terms themselves.  When there is but one melody, the skill of the composer and the  attention of the listener are concentrated upon this single melodic  line; and even if there be an accompaniment, it is so planned that the  chief melody stands out in relief against it. The pre-eminence of this  chief melody is seldom usurped, although the accompaniment often has  interesting features of its own. As soon as we have more than one  melody (whether there be two, three or still others) all these  voice-parts may be of coequal importance, and the musical fabric  becomes an interwoven texture of a number of strands. The genius and  skill of the composer is now expended on securing life and interest  for each of these voices--soprano, alto, tenor, bass--which seem to be  braided together; and thus a much more comprehensive attention is  required of the listener. For instead of the single melody in the  soprano, or upper voice, of the Folk-song, we now must listen  consciously to the bass and to both of the inner voices.[35] Too much  emphasis cannot be laid upon the recommendation that, in appreciating  music, the first task is to train the ear to a wide range of  listening. These differences in style are often apparent just as a  pattern of design--to be seen from the following examples:    [Music: Homophonic Style. Irish Folk-Song]    [Music: Polyphonic Style. BACH: Fugue in C Minor]    [Footnote 32: The statement might be qualified by saying that, since  Beethoven, instrumental style has become a happy mixture of homophony  for the chief melodies and polyphony for the supporting harmonic  basis. Stress is laid in the above text on the polyphonic aspect  merely to emphasize the matter under discussion.]    [Footnote 33: Notable"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30576"],[0,"Slave Narratives: A Folk History of Slavery in the United States from Interviews (#7)"],[1,"all up.

JOHN BARCLAY (nee Sarah Sanders) Brownwood, Texas was born in       Komo, Mississippi, September 1, 1853. She was born a slave at the       North Slades' place. Mr. and Mrs. North Slade were the only owners       she ever had. She served as nurse-maid for her marster's children       and did general housework. She, with her mother and father and       family stayed with the Slades until the end of the year after the       Civil War. They then moved to themselves, hiring out to \"White       Folks.\"      \"My marster and mistress was good to all de slaves dat worked for dem.  But our over-seer, Jimmy Shearer, was sho' mean. One day he done git mad  at me for some little somethin' and when I take de ashes to de garden he  catches me and churns me up and down on de groun'. One day he got mad  at my brother and kicked him end over end, jes' like a stick of wood. He  would whip us 'til we was raw and then put pepper and salt in de sores.  If he thought we was too slow in doin' anything he would kick us off de  groun' and churn us up and down. Our punishment depended on de mood of  de over-seer. I never did see no slaves sold. When we was sick dey give  us medicine out of drug stores. De over-seer would git some coarse  cotton cloth to make our work clothes out of and den he would make dem  so narrow we couldn' hardly' walk.    \"There was 1800 acres in Marster Slade's plantation, we got up at 5:00  o'clock in de mornin' and de field workers would quit after sun-down.

Song I 'member most is 'The  Day is Past and Gone.'    \"One time marster found out the over-seer was so mean to me, so he  discharged him and released me from duty for awhile.    \"We never did wear shoes through de week but on Sunday we would dress up  in our white cotton dresses and put on shoes.    \"We wasn't taught to read or write.
