She seemed not to care  about retreating, and he had got close up to the spot where she stood,  when all at once the buffalo charged furiously towards him, and was only  stopped by receiving a second bullet from the roer that hit right in the  centre of the forehead.  One more plunge forward and the animal dropped  on her knees, and died after the manner of buffaloes, with legs spread  and back uppermost, instead of falling over on its side.  Another shot  finished the calf, which was crying pitifully by the side of its mother.    Congo now came up, and, while examining the calf, discovered that one of  its legs had been already broken.  This accounted for the cow not having  attempted to save herself by flight.  She knew that her offspring was  disabled, and stayed by it from an instinct of maternal solicitude.    While Willem was engaged reloading his gun, he heard a loud rustling  among the parasitical plants that loaded the pandanus-tree under which  he and Congo were standing.  Some large body was stirring among the  branches.  What could it be?    \"Stand clear,\" shouted Willem, as he swerved off from the tree, at the  same time setting the cap upon his gun.    At the distance of ten or twelve paces he faced round, and stood ready  to meet the moving object, whatever it might be.  Just then he saw  standing before him a tall man who had dropped down from among the  leaves, while Willem's back had been turned towards the tree.    The dress and general appearance of this individual proclaimed him to be  a native African, but not one of those inferior varieties of the human  race which that country produces.  He was a man of about forty years of  age, tall and muscular, with features well formed, and that expressed  both intelligence and courage.  His complexion was tawny brown, not  black; and his hair was more like that of a European than an African.    These observations were made by the young hunter in six seconds; for the  person who had thus suddenly appeared before him allowed no more time to  elapse before setting off from the spot, and in such haste that the  hunter thought he must be retreating in affright.  And yet there was no  sign of fear accompanying the act.  Some other motive must have urged  him to that precipitate departure.    There was; and Congo was the first to discover it.  The man had gone in  the direction of the river.    \"Water, water!\" exclaimed the Kaffir; \"he want water.\"    The truth of this remark was soon made evident; for, on following the  stranger with their eyes, they saw him rush into the stream, plunge his  head under water and commence filling himself in the same manner as he  would have done, had his body been a bottle!    Hendrik and Arend, having heard the reports of the roer, feared that  something might have gone wrong, and galloped forward, leaving Hans and  Swartboy to bring up the pack-horses.    They reached the scene just as the African, after having quenched his  thirst, had returned to the tree where the young hunter and Congo had  remained.    Without taking the slightest notice of either of the others, the man  walked up to Groot Willem, and, with an air of dignity, natural to most  semi-barbarous people, began making a speech.  Grateful for having been  relieved from his imprisonment, he evidently believed that duty required  him to say something, whether it might be understood or not.    \"Can _you_ understand him, Congo?\" asked Willem.    \"Yaas, a little I can,\" answered the Kaffir; and in his own peculiar  manner he interpreted what the African had to say.    It was simply that he owed his life to Groot Willem, and that the latter  had only to ask for whatever he required, and it should be given him.    \"That is certainly promising a good deal,\" said the sarcastic Hendrik,  \"and I hope that Willem will not be too greedy in his request, but will  leave something for the rest of mankind.\"    Hans and Swartboy at this moment came up with the pack-horses; and,  selecting a spot near the place where the cow had been killed, the party  encamped for the night.    For some time, all hands were busy in gathering firewood and making  other preparations for their bivouac,--among which were the skinning and  cooking of the buffalo calf, duties that were assigned to the Bushman.  During his performance of them, the others, assisted by Congo as  interpreter, were extracting from the tall stranger a full account of  the adventure to which they were indebted for his presence in the camp;  and a strange story it was.        CHAPTER TEN.    MACORA.    In the manner of the African there was a certain hauteur which had not  escaped the observation of his hearers.    This was explained on their learning who and what he was; for his story  began by his giving a true and particular account of himself.    His name was Macora, and his rank that of a chief.  His tribe belonged  to the great nation of the Makololo, though living apart, in a \"kraal\"  by themselves.  The village, so-called, was at no great distance from  the spot where the hunters were now encamped.    The day before, he had come up the river in a canoe, accompanied by  three of his subjects.  Their object was to procure a plant which grew  in that place,--from which the poison for arrows and spears is obtained.  In passing a shallow place in the river, they had attempted to kill a  hippopotamus which they saw walking about on the bottom of the stream,  like a buffalo browsing upon a plain.  Rising suddenly to the surface,  the monster had capsized the canoe, and Macora was compelled to swim  ashore with the loss of a gun which once cost him eight elephant's  tusks.    He had seen nothing of his three companions, since parting with them in  the water.    On reaching the shore, and a few yards from the bank, he encountered a  herd of buffaloes, cows and young calves, on their way to the river.  These turned suddenly to avoid him, when a calf was knocked down by one  of the old ones, and so severely injured that it could not accompany the  rest in their flight.  The mother, seeing her offspring left behind,  turned back and selected Macora as the object of her resentment.  The  chief retreated towards the nearest tree, hotly pursued by the animal  eager to revenge the injury done to her young.    He was just in time to ascend among the branches as the cow came up.  The calf, with much difficulty, succeeded in reaching the tree.  Once  there, it could not move away, and the mother would not leave it.  This  accounted for Macora's having been found among the branches of the  pandanus.  He went on to say, that, during the time he had been detained  in the tree, he had made several attempts to get down and steal off, but  on each occasion had found the buffalo waiting to receive him upon her  horns.  He was suffering terribly with thirst when he heard the first  shot fired by Groot Willem, and perceived that assistance was near.    The chief concluded his narrative by inviting the hunters to accompany  him the next morning to his kraal; where he promised to show them such  hospitality as was in his power.  On learning that his home was down the  river, and at no great distance from it, the invitation was at once  accepted.    \"One thing this man has told us,\" remarked Willem, \"which pleases me  very much.  We have learnt that there is or has been a hippopotamus near  our camping-ground, and perhaps we shall not have far to travel before  commencing our premeditated war against them.\"    \"Question him about sea-cows, Cong,\" said Hendrik.  \"Ascertain if there  are many of them about here.\"    In answer to the Kaffir's inquiries, the chief stated that hippopotami  were not often seen in that part of the river; but that, a day's journey  farther down, there was a large lagoon, through which the stream ran;  there, sea-cows were as plentiful as the stars in the sky.    \"That is just the place we have been looking for,\" said Willem; \"and  now, Congo, question him about camelopards.\"    Macora could hold out but little hopes of their meeting giraffes  anywhere on that part of the Limpopo.  He had heard of one or two having  been occasionally seen; but it was not a giraffe country, and they were  stray animals.    \"Ask him if he knows where there is such a country,\" demanded Willem,  who seemed more interested in learning something about giraffes than  either of his companions.    Macora could not or would not answer this question without taking his  own time and way of doing it.  He stated that the native country of  himself and his tribe was far to the north and west; that they had been  driven from their home by the tyranny of the great Zooloo King,  Moselekatse, who claimed the land and levied tribute upon all the petty  chiefs around him.    Macora further stated that, having in some mysterious manner lost the  good opinion of Sekeletu and other great chiefs of the Makololo,--his  own people,--they would no longer protect him, and that he and his tribe  were compelled to leave their homes, and migrate to the place where he  was now about to conduct his new acquaintances.    \"But that is not what I wish to know,\" said Groot Willem, who never  troubled himself with the political affairs of his own country, and  therefore cared little about those of an African petty chief.    On being brought back to the question, Macora stated that he was only  giving them positive proof of his familiarity with the camelopards,  since nowhere were these more abundant than in the country from which he  had been expatriated by the tyranny of the Zooloo chief.  It was his  native land, where he had hunted the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27933"],[0,"Forest Neighbors: Life Stories of Wild Animals (#7)"],[1,"right, beady eyes, and a dark  little thread of a backbone that was always curled up like a horseshoe  because there wasn't room for it to lie straight. But along the outside  of the curve of each spinal column a set of the tiniest and daintiest  muscles was getting ready for a long pull, and a strong pull, and a pull  all together. And one day, late in the winter, when the woods were just  beginning to think about spring, the muscles in one particular egg  tugged with all their little might, the backbone straightened with a  great effort, the shell was ripped open, and the tail of a brand-new  brook trout thrust itself out into the water and wiggled pathetically.    But his head and shoulders were still inside, and for a while it looked  as if he would never get them free. His tail was shaped somewhat like a  paddle set on edge, for a long, narrow fin ran from the middle of his  back clear around the end of it and forward again on the under side of  his body, and with this for an oar he struggled and writhed and  squirmed, and went bumping blindly about among the pebbles like a kitten  with its head in the cream pitcher. And at last, with the most vigorous  squirm and wriggle of all, he backed clear of the shell in which he had  lain for so many weeks and months, and, weak and weary from his  exertions, lay down on a stone to rest.    He had to lie on his side, for attached to his breast was a large,  round, transparent sac which looked very much like the egg out of which  he had just come. In fact it really was the egg, or at least a portion  of it, for it held a large part of what had been the yolk. If you could  have examined him with a microscope you would have seen a most strange  and beautiful thing. His little body was so delicate and transparent  that one could see the arteries pulsing and throbbing in time with the  beating of his heart, and some of those arteries found their way into  the food-sac, where they kept branching and dividing, and growing  smaller and more numerous. And in the very smallest of the tiny tubes a  wonderful process was going on--as wonderful as the way in which the  oxygen fed the embryos through the shell. Somehow, by life's marvellous  alchemy, the blood was laying hold of the material of the yolk, turning  it into more blood, and carrying it away to be used in building up bone  and muscle everywhere from the tip of his nose to the end of his tail.  You might not have detected the actual transformation, but you could  have seen the beating of the engine, and the throbbing rush of the  little red rivers, all toiling with might and main to make a big, strong  trout out of this weak and diminutive baby. And you could have seen the  corpuscles hurrying along so thick and fast that at times they blocked  up the passages, and the current was checked till the heart could bring  enough pressure to bear to burst the dam and send them rushing on again.  For the corpuscles of a trout's blood are considerably larger than those  of most fishes, and they sometimes get \"hung up,\" like a drive of logs  sent down a stream hardly large enough to float it.    With a full haversack to be drawn upon in such a convenient manner the  Troutlet was not obliged to take food through his mouth or to think  about hustling around in search of a living. This was very fortunate,  for the stream was full of hungry beasts of prey who would be very  likely to gobble him up quick the first time he went abroad; and,  besides, his frail little body was still so weak and delicate that he  could not bear the light of day. So, instead of swimming away to seek  his fortune, he simply dived down deeper into the gravel, and stayed  there. For some weeks he led a very quiet life among the pebbles, and  the only mishap that befell him during that time was the direct result  of his retiring disposition. In his anxiety to get as far away from the  world as possible he one day wedged himself into a cranny so narrow that  he couldn't get out again. He couldn't even breathe, for his gill-covers  were squeezed down against the sides of his head as if he were in a  vise. A trout's method of respiration is to open his mouth and fill it  with water, and then to close it again and force the water out through  his gills, between his cheeks and his shoulders, about where his neck  would be if he had one. It's very simple when you once know how, but you  can't do it with your gill-covers clamped down. His tail wiggled more  pathetically than ever, and did its level best to pull him out, but  without success. He was wedged in so tightly that he couldn't move, and  he was fast smothering, like a baby that has rolled over on its face  upon the pillow. But at the last moment, when his struggles had grown  feebler and feebler until they had almost ceased, something stirred up  the gravel around him and set him free. He never knew what did it.  Perhaps a deer or a bear waded through the stream; or a saw-log may have  grounded for a moment in the shallow; or possibly it was only the  current, for by this time most of the snow had melted, and the little  river was working night and day to carry the water out of the woods. But  whatever it was, he was saved.    He stayed in the gravel nearly a month, but his yolk-sac was gradually  shrinking, and after a time it drew itself up into a little cleft in his  breast and almost disappeared. There was nothing left of it but a little  amber-colored bead, and it could no longer supply food enough for his  growing body. There were times when he felt decidedly hungry. And other  changes had come while he lay and waited in the gravel. The embryonic  fin which had made his tail so like a paddle was gone, the true dorsal  and caudal and anal fins had taken their proper shape, and he looked a  little less like a tadpole and a little more like a fish. He was  stronger than he had been at first, and he was losing his dread of the  sunlight; and so at last he left the gravel-bed, to seek his rightful  place in the world of moving, murmuring waters.    He was rather weak and listless at first, and quite given to resting in  the shallows and back water, and taking things as easily as possible.  But that was to be expected for a time, and he was much better off than  some of the other trout babies. He saw one that had two heads and only  one body, and another with two heads and two bodies joined together at  the tail. Still others there were who had never been strong enough to  straighten their backbones, and who had lain in the egg till the shell  wore thin and let them out head first, which is not at all the proper  way for a trout to hatch. Even now they still retained the horseshoe  curve, and could never swim straight ahead, but only spin round and  round like whirligigs. These cripples and weaklings seemed to have got  on pretty well as long as their food-sacs lasted, but now that they had  to make their own living they were at a serious disadvantage. They all  disappeared after a day or two, and our friend never saw them again.  They couldn't stand the real struggle of life.    Many a strong, healthy baby disappeared at the same time, and if there  had not been so many of them it is not likely that any would have  survived the first few days and weeks. Even as it was, I doubt if more  than one fish out of each thousand eggs ever lived to grow up. It is not  difficult to guess where they went. Our Trout had hardly emerged from  his hiding-place in the gravel when a queer, ugly, big-headed little  fish darted at him from under a stone, with his jaws open and an awful  cavity yawning behind them. The Troutlet dodged between a couple of  pebbles and escaped, but another youngster just beyond him was caught  and swallowed alive. That was his first meeting with the star-gazer, who  kills more babies than ever Herod did. Then there were minnows, and  herrings, and lizards, and frogs, and weasels, and water-snakes, and  other butchers of all sorts and sizes, too numerous to mention. And  perhaps the worst of all were the older trout, who never seemed to have  the least compunction about eating their small relations, and who were  so nimble and lively that it was almost impossible to keep out of their  way. Our friend spent most of his time in the shallow water near the  banks, where larger fishes were not so likely to follow him, but even  there he had many narrow escapes and was obliged to keep himself hidden  as much as possible under chips and dead leaves, and behind stones.    Often he found himself in great peril when he least suspected it. Once  he lay for some time in the edge of a dark forest of water-weeds, only  an inch from a lumpish, stupid-looking creature, half covered with mud,  that was clinging to one of the stems. The animal appeared so dull and  unintelligent that the young Trout paid little attention to him until  another baby came up and approached a trifle closer. Then, quick as a  flash, the creature shot out an arm nearly three-quarters of an inch  long, bearing on its end two horrible things which were not exactly  claws, nor fingers, nor teeth, but which partook of the nature of all  three, and which came together on the infant's soft, helpless little  body like a pair of tongs or the jaws of a steel trap, and drew him in  to where the real jaws were waiting to make mince-meat of him. Our  friend fled so precipitately that he did not see the end of the tragedy,  but neither did he ever see that baby again. Before the summer had  passed, the dull, lumpish-looking creature had become a magnificent  insect, with long, gauzy wings, clad in glittering mail, and known to  everybody as a dragon-fly, but I doubt if any of his performances in the  upper air were ever half as dragon-like as the deeds of darkness that he  did when he was an ugly, shapeless larva down under the water.    Fortunately, not all the larvae in the stream were thus to be feared.  Many were so small that the Troutlet"]]]
