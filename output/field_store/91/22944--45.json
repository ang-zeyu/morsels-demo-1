[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3689"],[0,"Letters of Franz Liszt -- Volume 1 (#7)"],[1," perhaps the one regret of my  winter. I should so immensely have liked to be there to admire  you, to applaud you. Several people who had the honor of being  present at these choice evenings have spoken to me about them  with enthusiasm.    What a contrast to the tiresome musical soliloquies (I do not  know what other name to give to this invention of mine) with  which I contrived to gratify the Romans, and which I am quite  capable of importing to Paris, so unbounded does my impudence  become! Imagine that, wearied with warfare, not being able to  compose a programme which would have common sense, I have  ventured to give a series of concerts all by myself, affecting  the Louis XIV. style, and saying cavalierly to the public, \"The  concert is--myself.\" For the curiosity of the thing I copy one of  the programmes of the soliloquies for you:--    1. Overture to William Tell, performed by M. L.    2. Reminiscences of the Puritani. Fantaisie composed and  performed by the above-mentioned!    3. Etudes and fragments by the same to the same!    4. Improvisation on themes given--still by the same. And that was  all; neither more nor less, except lively conversation during the  intervals, and enthusiasm if there was room for it.    A propos of enthusiasm, I ought at least to talk to you of St.  Peter's. That is the proper thing to do when one writes from  Rome. But, in the first place, I am writing to you from Albano,  whence I can only discern the dome, and, secondly, this poor St.  Peter's has been so disguised, so embellished by papier-mache  wreaths, horrid curtains at alcoves, etc., etc., all in honor of  the five or six last saints whom His Holiness has canonised, that  I try to put away the recollection of it. Happily there have not  been any workers of miracles to glorify at the Coliseum and the  Campo Vaccino, otherwise it would have been impossible to live in  Rome.    If nothing occurs to prevent it, I expect to pass the end of next  winter (March and April) in Paris. Will you permit me then to  fill up all the gaps in my correspondence from the Rue d'Anjou?  [Here the Princess lived.] I count always upon your friendly and  indulgent kindness. But shall you extend this so far as to give  me a sign of life before the close of my stay in Italy? I do not  know. In any case, letters addressed poste restante, Florence,  will reach me till the 1st of next September.    I beg you, Madame la Princesse, to accept the expression of my  profound and most devoted respect.    F. Liszt    Albano, June 4th, 1839    Will you be good enough to remember me affectionately to (Madame)  your sister and to Mr. d'Aragon?        19. To Robert Schumann    [From a copy from the Royal Library in Berlin.]    Albano, June 5th, 1839    My dear Monsieur Schumann,    At the risk of appearing very monotonous, I must again tell you  that the last pieces you were so kind as to send me to Rome  appear to me admirable both in inspiration and composition. The  \"Fantaisie\" dedicated to me is a work of the highest kind--and I  am really proud of the honor you have done me in dedicating to me  so grand a composition.    Op. 17, C dur. With the motto:--    \"Durch alle Tone tonet  Im bunten Erdentraum  Ein leiser Ton gezogen  Fur den, der heimlich lauschet.\"    (\"Through all the sounds of nature,  In earth's fair dream of joy,  An under-current soundeth  For him whose ears can hear.\"]    I mean, therefore, to work at it and penetrate it through and  through, so as to make the utmost possible effect with it.    As to the \"Kinderscenen,\" I owe to them one of the greatest  pleasures of my life. You know, or you don't know, that I have a  little girl of three years old, whom everybody agrees in  considering angelic (did you ever hear such a commonplace?). Her  name is Blandine-Rachel, and her surname Moucheron. [Pet name;  literally, \"little fly.\"] It goes without saying that she has a  complexion of roses and milk, and that her fair golden hair  reaches to her feet just like a savage. She is, however, the most  silent child, the most sweetly grave, the most philosophically  gay in the world. I have every reason to hope also that she will  not be a musician, from which may Heaven preserve her!    Well, my dear Monsieur Schumann, two or three times a week (on  fine and good days!) I play your \"Kinderscenen\" to her in the  evening; this enchants her, and me still more, as you may  imagine, so that often I go over the first repeat twenty times  without going any further. Really I think you would be satisfied  with this success if you could be a witness of it!    I think I have already expressed to you, in one of my former  letters, the desire I felt to see you write some ensemble pieces,  Trios, Quintets, or Septets. Will you pardon me for pressing this  point again? It seems to me that you would be more capable of  doing it than any one else nowadays. And I am convinced that  success, even commercial success, would not be wanting.    If between now and next winter you could complete some ensemble  work, it would be a real pleasure to me to make it known in  Paris, where that sort of composition, when well played, has more  chance of success than you perhaps think. I would even gladly  undertake to find a publisher for it, if you liked, which would  moreover in no wise prevent you from disposing of it for Germany.    In the interim I mean to play in public your \"Carnaval,\" and some  of the \"Davidsbundlertanze\" and of the \"Kinderscenen.\" The  \"Kreisleriana,\" and the \"Fantaisie\" which is dedicated to me, are  more difficult of digestion for the public. I shall reserve them  till later.    Up to the present time I only know the following works of  yours:--    Impromptus on a theme by Clara Wieck.  Pianoforte Sonata, dedicated to Clara.  Concerto without orchestra.  \"Etudes Symphoniques\"  \"Davidsbundlertanze\"  \"Kreisleriana.\"  \"Carnaval.\"  \"Kinderscenen\" and my \"Fantaisie.\"    If you would have the kindness to complete your works to me it  would be a great pleasure to me; I should like to have them bound  all together in three or four volumes. Haslinger, on his side,  will send you my Etudes and my other publications as they come  out.    What you tell me of your private life has interested and touched  me deeply. If I could, I know not how, be in the least pleasant  or useful to you in these circumstances, dispose of me as you  will. Whatever happens, count on my absolute discretion and  sincere devotion. If I am not asking too much, tell me if it is  Clara of whom you speak. But if this question should seem to you  misplaced, do not answer it.    Have you met at Leipzig Mr. Frank, [Dr. Hermann Frank edited  Brockhaus' Allgemeine Zeitung for a year.] at the present moment  editor of the Leipzig Allgemeine Zeitung? From the little I know  of him (for he has been much more intimate with Chopin and Hiller  than with me) I think he is capable of understanding you. He has  left a charming impression behind him in Rome. If you see him,  give him my affectionate regards.    My plans remain the same. I still intend to be in Vienna at the  beginning of December, and in Paris at the end of February. I  shall be capable of coming to look you up in Leipzig if you will  let me make the journey from Paris with you. Try! Adieu, my dear  Monsieur Schumann; write soon (address care of Ricordi, Florence:  I shall be in the neighborhood of Lucca till the middle of  September), and depend always on my sincere esteem and lively  affection.    Yours in all friendship,    F. Liszt        20. To Breitkopf and Hartel    [Milan, June, 1839]    Gentleman,    About three weeks ago I gave to Mr. Ricordi (who was on his way  to Rome) the proofs of the two Symphonies you addressed to me. I  hope they have reached you by now. Forgive me for having kept  them so long, and also for having corrected them with so much  care. But, firstly, they did not reach me till about the 20th of  February, and then I did not know how to send them to you direct,  for the diligences in this happy country are so insecure. I am  therefore of necessity (though very unwillingly) behindhand.    Allow me to ask you for a second proof (for it is of great  consequence to me that the edition should be as correct as  possible), and this time I will beg you to send me three proofs  of each Symphony, so that I may forward one to Paris and the  other to London. Probably there will not be any more corrections  to make in this second proof, and in that case I will let you  know in two words (without returning your proof), telling you at  the same time the date of publication.    My intention being to visit Vienna, Munich, and perhaps Leipzig  at the beginning of next year (before going to England in the  month of April), I shall take advantage of this opportunity to  let the Symphonies be heard at my concerts, so as to give them a  certain publicity.    I have looked through the Lieder you have been good enough to  send me. I shall certainly do the \"Adelaide,\" however difficult  it may seem to me to transcribe simply and elegantly. As regards  the others, I am afraid I cannot find the necessary time.  Moreover, that good Haslinger overwhelms me with Schubert. I have  just sent him twenty-four more new songs (\"Schwanengesang\" and  \"Winterreise\"), and for the moment I am rather tired with this  work.    Would you be so kind as to send me, at the same time with the  proofs of the Beethoven Symphonies, Mr. Mendelssohn's \"Preludes  and Fugues\"? It is an extremely remarkable work, and it has been  impossible to get it in Italy. I shall be greatly obliged if you  will send it me.    When you see Mr. Schumann please remember me very kindly to him.  I have received the \"Fantaisie\" which he has done me the honor to  dedicate to me, and the \"Kinderscenen.\" Don't you think you ought  to publish a book of Studies by him? I should be extremely  curious to make acquaintance with them. All his works interest me  in a high degree. It"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/36903"],[0,"Marvels of Pond-life (#7)"],[1,"obtained from the opticians, and cemented  with varnish or marine glue to an ordinary glass slide. After an object  has been placed in one of them, a little water is taken up in the  dipping-tube, and the cell filled until the fluid stands in a convex  heap above its brim. We then select around glass cover, and press it  gently on the walls of our cell. A few drops of superfluous water  escape, and we have the cell quite full, and the cover held tight by  force of the capillary attraction between the water and the glass.    [Illustration: _Hydra viridis_ with developed young one, and bud  beginning to sprout.]    The polyp deposited in one of these water cages is then transferred to  the stage of the microscope, and its proceedings watched. At first it  looks like a shapeless mass of apple-green jelly. Soon, however, the  tail end of the creature is fixed to the glass, the body elongates, and  the tentacles (in this case eight) expand something after the manner of  the leaves of a graceful palm.    By accident two small Water Fleas were imprisoned with the polyp, and  one (a shrimp-like looking creature, carrying behind her a great bag of  eggs) came into contact with the tentacles, and seemed paralysed for a  time. The hydra made no attempt to convey the captive to its mouth, but  held it tight until another Water Flea, a round merry little fellow  (_Chydorus sphaericus_), came to the rescue, and assisted _Canthocamptus_  to escape by tugging at her tail. This friendly action may not have been  prompted by the intelligence which seemed to suggest it, but those who  have kept tame soldier-crabs and prawns in an aquarium, will not be  indisposed to attribute to the crustaceans more brains than they have  usually credit for. It must, however, be confessed that the subsequent  conduct of Mrs. Canthocamptus did not indicate the possession of much  prudence, for she learnt no lesson from experience, but repeatedly swam  against her enemy's tentacles, suffered many captures, and only escaped  being devoured through the indifference, or want of appetite, which the  polyp evinced.    [Illustration: A, _Canthocamptus minutus_; B, _Chydorus sphaericus_; C  and D, Capsules and poison-thread of polyp; E, _Tricodina pediculus_,  side view and under view; F, _Kerona polyporum.--Microg. Dict._]    On the body of the _Canthocamptus_ were some small transparent vases or  bottles, containing living objects, which sprang up and down. These  were members of the _Vorticella_ family, called _Cothurnia_, and will  be hereafter described.    [Illustration: _Hydra viridis_, in various shapes.]    Watching the hydra it was curious to note the changes of form which  these creatures are able to assume. Now the tentacles were short and  thick, and the body squat; now the body was elongated, like the stem of  a palm tree, and the tentacles hung gracefully from the top. From some  of the polyps little round buds were growing, while other buds were  already developed into miniature copies of the parent, and only attached  by a slender stalk. In a few days many of these left the maternal side,  fixed their own little tails to the glass, and commenced housekeeping on  their own account.    Polyps may be obtained at all times of the year by bringing home  duckweed, conferva, and other water-plants from the ponds. Some hauls  may be unsuccessful, but if one pond is not propitious others should be  tried. The plants should be put in a capacious vessel of water, and  placed in the light, where, if polyps be present, they will show  themselves within twenty-four hours, either attached to the sides of the  glass, or hanging from the plants, or suspended head downwards from the  upper film of the water. They are elegant objects, and may be kept  without difficulty for some weeks. After being confined in a small  quantity of water for purposes of examination, they should be carefully  replaced in the larger vessel, and may thus be used again and again  without suffering any injury. A low power--a three or two-inch glass--or  a one-inch, reduced by employing the erector--is the most convenient for  examining the whole creature, but higher powers are necessary to make  out its minute structure. They should be viewed with direct and oblique  light, as transparent and also as opaque objects. In the latter case the  \"Lieberkuhn,\" or polished silver speculum, is convenient, and if the  microscope is not furnished with Lister's dark wells, a small piece of  black paper may be stuck behind the object, by simply wetting it with  the tongue.[4]    [4] The side silver reflector is useful for illuminating such objects.    Although the polyps are remarkable for the simplicity of their  organization, they do not the less exhibit the wonderful nature of  animal life. Their bodies are composed of the substance, called  _sarcode_, in which is imbedded a colouring matter resembling that in  the leaves of plants; every part possesses irritability and  contractility, and they are very sensitive to the stimulus of light. The  outer layer of their bodies is harder than the inner layer. These  layers are severally called _ectoderm_ and _endoderm_. They may be cut  and grafted like trees, and if turned inside out, the new inside digests  and assimilates as well as the old. Whether any form of consciousness  can belong to creatures which have no distinct nervous system is open to  doubt, but it would seem probable from their movements that food and  light afford them something like a pleasurable sensation in a very  humble degree. If we were sufficiently acquainted with the secrets of  molecular combination we might discover that the various functions of  these simple organisms were discharged by different _particles_,  although it is only in higher creatures that muscular particles are  aggregated into muscles, or nerve particles into nerves.    Having examined the general appearance and proceedings of the hydra, let  us cut off a tentacle, or take a small specimen and gently crush it by  pressing down the cover of the live box, and place the object so  prepared under a power of about three hundred linear. If we then  illuminate it with a moderate quantity of oblique light, we shall  discover round the edge of the tentacle a number of small cells or  capsules, from some of which a very slender wire or thread will be  emitted.[5] These are the stinging organs of the polyp, and resemble  those which Mr. Gosse has so ably elucidated in the sea anemones. Some  writers have endeavoured to show that they are not stinging organs at  all, but so large an amount of evidence to the contrary is accumulated  in Mr. Gosse's 'Actinologia Britannica,' that no reasonable doubt  remains. The stinging capsules of the polyp are shown in the annexed  sketch, and also the way in which they are employed, for it fortunately  happened that on exposing one of the hydras to pressure in the live box,  a small worm (_Anguillula_) escaped, which had been pierced with the  minute weapons which are supposed to convey a poison into the wound. The  authors of the 'Micrographic Dictionary' think that the prongs of the  forks, which will be seen to point upwards in the sketch,[6] are  springs, and occupy a reversed position in the capsule cells, and that  their function is to throw out the threads. However this may be, the  polyps, and similarly endowed creatures, have the power of darting out  their poison threads with considerable force, and Mr. Gosse found that  the anemone was able to pierce a thick piece of human skin.    [5] See page 34, C and D.    [6] See page 38.    [Illustration: Anguillula pierced by stinging organs of the _Hydra  viridis_.]    The same excellent observer attributes the emission of the anemone  poison threads, which he considers hollow, to the injection of a fluid.  In their quiescent state, he thinks they are drawn in, like the finger  of a glove, and are forced out as the liquid enters their slender tubes.  Possibly the polyp stinging organs may have the same structure.    Notwithstanding their dangerous weapons, polyps are often infested with  a parasite, the _Trichodina pediculus_, as shown in Fig. E, page 49, and  it must happen that either this visitation is not disagreeable, or that  the Trichodina is not influenced by the poison.    As the plants in the bottles decayed, some of the animalcules died off  and others appeared. In one bottle, containing decaying chara,  _Paramecia_ abounded. The _Paramecia_, of which there are various  species, have always been favourite objects with microscopists. The  Germans call them \"slipper animalcules,\" and they vary in size from  1--96\"[7] to 1--1150\". They are flat rounded-oblong creatures, with a  distinct integument or skin, \"through which numerous vibratile cilia  pass in regular rows.\"[8] They are furnished with a distinct mouth, and  adult specimens exhibit star-shaped contractile vesicles in great  perfection.    [7] The usual mode of giving dimensions is by fractions thus expressed:  1--96\" means one ninety-sixth of an inch.    [8] 'Micrographic Dictionary.'    The swarm of specimens before us belong to one species, _Paramecium  aurelia_, the _Chrysalis animalcule_, and they crowd every portion of  the little water-drop we have taken up, and examined with a power of  about one hundred linear. When they are sufficiently quiet a power of  about four hundred may be used with advantage, and Pritchard recommends  adding a little indigo and carmine to the water, in order to see the  cilia more clearly, or rather to render their action more plain. The  cilia are disposed lengthwise, and Ehrenberg counted in some rows sixty  or seventy of them, making an aggregate of three thousand six hundred  and forty organs of motion in one small animated speck. This number  seems large, but although we have never performed the feat of counting  them, we should have expected it to prove much greater. Unlike most  animalcules they are susceptible "]]]
