Area six; pin-point four seven three dash six  oh five.    \"Got it.\" He repeated the figures.    But neither of the Atlanteans was \"scragged\", and at six P.M. an  allegedly honeymooning couple parked their big roadster in the garage at  Norgrad Field and went through the gates. Their papers, tickets  included, were in perfect order; they were as inconspicuous and as  undemonstrative as newlyweds are wont to be. No more so, and no less.    Strolling idly, gazing eagerly at each new thing, they made their  circuitous way toward a certain small hangar. As the girl had said, this  field boasted hundreds of super-sonic fighters, so many that servicing  was a round-the-clock routine. In that hangar was a sharp-nosed,  stubby-V'd flyer, one of Norheim's fastest. It was serviced and ready.    It was too much to hope, of course, that the visitors could actually get  into the building unchallenged. Nor did they.    \"Back, you!\" A guard waved them away. \"Get back to the Concourse, where  you belong--no visitors allowed out here!\"    F-f-t! F-f-t! Phryges' air-gun broke into soft but deadly coughing.  Kinnexa whirled--hands flashing down, skirt flying up-and ran. Guards  tried to head her off; tried to bring their own weapons to bear.  Tried--failed--died.    Phryges, too, ran; ran backward. His blaster was out now and flaming,  for no living enemy remained within needle range. A rifle bullet  w-h-i-n-g-e-d past his head, making him duck involuntarily and  uselessly. Rifles were bad; but their hazard, too, had been considered  and had been accepted.    Kinnexa reached the fighter's port, opened it, sprang in. He jumped. She  fell against him. He tossed her clear, slammed and dogged the door. He  looked at her then, and swore bitterly. A small, round hole marred the  bridge of her nose: the back of her head was gone.    He leaped to the controls and the fleet little ship screamed skyward. He  cut in transmitter and receiver, keyed and twiddled briefly. No soap. He  had been afraid of that. They were already blanketing every frequency he  could employ; using power through which he could not drive even a tight  beam a hundred miles.    But he could still crash that missile in its tube. Or--could he? He was  not afraid of other Norheiman fighters; he had a long lead and he rode  one of their very fastest. But since they were already so suspicious,  wouldn't they launch the bomb _before_ seven o'clock? He tried vainly to  coax another knot out of his wide-open engines.    With all his speed, he neared the pin-point just in time to see a trail  of super-heated vapor extending up into and disappearing beyond the  stratosphere. He nosed his flyer upward, locked the missile into his  sights, and leveled off. Although his ship did not have the giant  rocket's acceleration, he could catch it before it got to Atlantis,  since he did not need its altitude and since most of its journey would  be made without power. What he could do about it after he caught it he  did not know, but he'd do _something_.    He caught it; and, by a feat of piloting to be appreciated only by those  who have handled planes at super-sonic speeds, he matched its course and  velocity. Then, from a distance of barely a hundred feet, he poured his  heaviest shells into the missile's war-head. He _couldn't_ be missing!  It was worse than shooting sitting ducks--it was like dynamiting fish in  a bucket! Nevertheless, nothing happened. The thing wasn't fuzed for  impact, then, but for time; and the activating mechanism would be  shell-and shock-proof.    But there was still a way. He didn't need to call Artomenes now, even if  he could get through the interference which the fast-approaching  pursuers were still sending out. Atlantean observers would have lined  this stuff up long since; the Officer would know exactly what was going  on.    Driving ahead and downward, at maximum power, Phryges swung his ship  slowly into a right-angle collision course. The fighter's needle nose  struck the war-head within a foot of the Atlantean's point of aim, and  as he died Phryges knew that he had accomplished his mission. Norheim's  missile would not strike Atlantis, but would fall at least ten miles  short, and the water there was very deep. Very, _very_ deep. Atlantis  would not be harmed.    It might have been better, however, if Phryges had died with Kinnexa on  Norgrad Field; in which case the continent would probably have endured.  As it was, while that one missile did not reach the city, its frightful  atomic charge exploded under six hundred fathoms of water, ten scant  miles from Atlantis' harbor, and very close to an ancient geological  fault.    Artomenes, as Phryges had surmised, had had time in which to act, and he  knew much more than Phryges did about what was coming toward Atlantis.  Too late, he knew that not one missile, but seven, had been launched  from Norheim, and at least five from Uighar. The retaliatory rockets  which were to wipe out Norgrad, Uigharstoy, and thousands of square  miles of environs were on their way long before either bomb or  earthquake destroyed all of the Atlantean launching ramps.    But when equilibrium was at last restored, the ocean rolled serenely  where a minor continent had been.          CHAPTER 3    THE FALL OF ROME    1. EDDORE      Like two high executives of a Tellurian corporation discussing business  affairs during a chance meeting at one of their clubs, Eddore's All  Highest and Gharlane, his second in command, were having the Eddorian  equivalent of an after-business-hours chat.    \"You did a nice job on Tellus,\" the All-Highest commended. \"On the other  three, too, of course, but Tellus was so far and away the worst of the  lot that the excellence of the work stands out. When the Atlantean  nations destroyed each other so thoroughly I thought that this thing  called 'democracy' was done away with forever, but it seems to be mighty  hard to kill. However, I take it that you have this Rome situation  entirely under control?\"    \"Definitely. Mithradates of Pontus was mine. So were both Sulla and  Marius. Through them and others I killed practically all of the brains  and ability of Rome, and reduced that so-called 'democracy' to a  howling, aimless mob. My Nero will end it. Rome will go on by  momentum--outwardly, will even appear to grow--for a few generations,  but what Nero will do can never be undone.\"    \"Good. A difficult task, truly.\"    \"Not difficult, exactly ... but it's so damned _steady_.\" Gharlane's  thought was bitter. \"But that's the hell of working with such  short-lived races. Since each creature lives only a minute or so, they  change so fast that a man can't take his mind off of them for a second.  I've been wanting to take a little vacation trip back to our old  time-space, but it doesn't look as though I'll be able to do it until  after they get some age and settle down.\"    \"That won't be too long. Life-spans lengthen, you know, as races  approach their norms.\"    \"Yes. But none of the others is having half the trouble that I am. Most  of them, in fact, have things coming along just about the way they want  them. My four planets are raising more hell than all the rest of both  galaxies put together, and I know that it isn't me--next to you, I'm the  most efficient operator we've got. What I'm wondering about is why I  happen to be the goat.\"    \"Precisely because you _are_ our most efficient operator.\" If an  Eddorian can be said to smile, the All-Highest smiled. \"You know, as  well as I do, the findings of the Integrator.\"    \"Yes, but I am wondering more and more as to whether to believe them  unreservedly or not. Spores from an extinct life-form--suitable  environments--operation of the laws of chance--Tommyrot! I am beginning  to suspect that chance is being strained beyond its elastic limit, for  my particular benefit, and as soon as I can find out who is doing that  straining there will be one empty place in the Innermost Circle.\"    \"Have a care, Gharlane!\" All levity, all casualness disappeared. \"Whom  do you suspect? Whom do you accuse?\"    \"Nobody, as yet. The true angle never occurred to me until just now,  while I have been discussing the thing with you. Nor shall I either  suspect or accuse, ever. I shall determine, then I shall act.\"    \"In defiance of _me_? Of _my_ orders?\" the All-Highest demanded, his  short temper flaring.    \"Say, rather, in support,\" the lieutenant shot back, unabashed. \"If some  one is working on me through my job, what position are you probably  already in, without knowing it? Assume that I am right, that these four  planets of mine got the way they are because of monkey business inside  the Circle. Who would be next? And how sure are you that there isn't  something similar, but not so far advanced, already aimed at you? It  seems to me that serious thought is in order.\"    \"Perhaps so.... You may be right.... There have been a few  nonconformable items. Taken separately, they did not seem to be of any  importance; but together, and considered in this new light....\"    Thus was borne out the conclusion of the Arisian Elders that the  Eddorians would not at that time deduce Arisia; and thus Eddore lost its  chance to begin in time the forging of a weapon with which to oppose  effectively Arisia's--Civilization's--Galactic Patrol, so soon to come  into being.    If either of the two had been less suspicious, less jealous, less  arrogant and domineering--in other words, had not been Eddorians--this  History of Civilization might never have been written; or written very  differently and by another hand.    Both were, however, Eddorians.      2. ARISIA    In the brief interval between the fall of Atlantis and the rise of Rome  to the summit of her power, Eukonidor of Arisia had aged scarcely at  all. He was still a youth. He was, and would be for many centuries to  come, a Watchman.

Any one who saw the grateful avidity with which they took the money,  and the warmth with which they pledged themselves to serve me faithfully  through all dangers and difficulties, would, had he had no dealings with  such men before, have thought that I had a first-rate set of followers.  I lastly gave Sheikh Said a double-barrelled rifle by Blissett, and  distributed fifty carbines among the seniors of the expedition, with the  condition that they would forfeit them to others more worthy if they did  not behave well, but would retain possession of them for ever if they  carried them through the journey to my satisfaction.    On the 21st, as everything was ready on the island, I sent Sheikh Said  and all the men, along with the Hottentots, mules, and baggage, off in  dhows to Bagamoyo, on the opposite mainland. Colonel Rigby, with Captain  Grant and myself, then called on the Sultan, to bid him adieu, when  he graciously offered me, as a guard of honour to escort me through  Uzaramo, one jemadar and twenty-five Beluch soldiers. These I accepted,  more as a government security in that country against the tricks of the  natives, than for any accession they made to our strength. His highness  then places his 22-gun corvette, \"Secundra Shah,\" at our disposal, and  we went all three over to Bagamoyo, arriving on the 25th. Immediately on  landing, Ladha and Sheikh Said showed us into a hut prepared for us, and  all things looked pretty well. Ladha's hundred loads of beads, cloths,  and brass wire were all tied up for the march, and seventy-five pagazis  (porters from the Moon country) had received their hire to carry these  loads to Kaze in the land of the Moon. Competition, I found, had raised  these men's wages, for I had to pay, to go even as far as Kaze, nine and  a quarter dollars a-head!--as Masudi and some other merchants were bound  on the same line as myself, and all were equally in a hurry to be off  and avoid as much as possible the famine we knew we should have to fight  through at this late season. Little troubles, of course, must always be  expected, else these blacks would not be true negroes. Sheikh Said now  reported it quite impossible to buy anything at a moderate rate; for, as  I was a \"big man,\" I ought to \"pay a big price;\" and my men had all been  obliged to fight in the bazaar before they could get even tobacco at the  same rate as other men, because they were the servants of the big man,  who could afford to give higher wages than any one else. The Hottentots,  too, began to fall sick, which my Wanguana laughingly attributed to want  of grog to keep their spirits up, as these little creatures, the \"Tots,\"  had frequently at Zanzibar, after heavy potations, boasted to the more  sober free men, that they \"were strong, because they could stand plenty  drink.\" The first step now taken was to pitch camp under large shady  mango-trees, and to instruct every man in his particular duty. At the  same time, the Wanguana, who had carbines, were obliged to be drilled  in their use and formed into companies, with captains of ten, headed by  General Baraka, who was made commander-in-chief.    On the 30th September, as things were looking more orderly, I sent  forward half of the property, and all the men I had then collected, to  Ugeni, a shamba, or garden, two miles off; and on the 2nd October, after  settling with Ladha for my \"African money,\" as my pagazis were completed  to a hundred and one, we wished Rigby adieu, and all assembled together  at Ugeni, which resembles the richest parts of Bengal.              Chapter II. Uzaramo    The Nature of the Country--The Order of March--The Beginning of  our Taxation--Sultan Lion's Claw, and Sultan Monkey's Tail--The  Kingani--Jealousies and Difficulties in the Camp--The Murderer of M.  Maizan.    We were now in U-za-Ramo, which may mean the country of Ramo, though I  have never found any natives who could enlighten me on the derivation of  this obviously triple word. The extent of the country, roughly speaking,  stretches from the coast to the junction or bifurcation of the Kingani  and its upper branch the Mgeta river, westwards; and from the Kingani,  north, to the Lufigi river, south; though in the southern portions  several subtribes have encroached upon the lands. There are no hills in  Uzaramo; but the land in the central line, formed like a ridge between  the two rivers, furrow fashion, consists of slightly elevated flats and  terraces, which, in the rainy season, throw off their surplus waters  to the north and south by nullahs into these rivers. The country is  uniformly well covered with trees and large grasses, which, in the rainy  season, are too thick, tall, and green to be pleasant; though in the  dry season, after the grasses have been burnt, it is agreeable enough,  though not pretty, owing to the flatness of the land. The villages  are not large or numerous, but widely spread, consisting generally  of conical grass huts, while others are gable-ended, after the  coast-fashion--a small collection of ten or twenty comprising one  village. Over these villages certain headmen, titled Phanze, hold  jurisdiction, who take black-mail from travellers with high presumption  when they can. Generally speaking, they live upon the coast, and call  themselves Diwans, headsmen, and subjects of the Sultan Majid; but  they no sooner hear of the march of a caravan than they transpose their  position, become sultans in their own right, and levy taxes accordingly.    The Wazaramo are strictly agriculturists; they have no cows, and but few  goats. They are of low stature and thick set and their nature tends to  the boisterous. Expert slavehunters, they mostly clothe themselves by  the sale of their victims on the coast, though they do business by the  sale of goats and grain as well. Nowhere in the interior are natives so  well clad as these creatures. In dressing up their hair, and otherwise  smearing their bodies with ochreish clay, they are great dandies. They  always keep their bows and arrows, which form their national arm, in  excellent order, the latter well poisoned, and carried in quivers nicely  carved. To intimidate a caravan and extort a hongo or tax, I have seen  them drawn out in line as if prepared for battle; but a few soft words  were found sufficient to make them all withdraw and settle the matter at  issue by arbitration in some appointed place. A few men without property  can cross their lands fearlessly, though a single individual with  property would stand no chance, for they are insatiable thieves. But  little is seen of these people on the journey, as the chiefs take their  taxes by deputy, partly out of pride, and partly because they think they  can extort more by keeping in the mysterious distance. At the same  time, the caravan prefers camping in the jungles beyond the villages  to mingling with the inhabitants, where rows might be engendered.  We sometimes noticed Albinos, with greyish-blue eyes and light  straw-coloured hair. Not unfrequently we would pass on the track side  small heaps of white ashes, with a calcined bone or two among them.  These, we were told, were the relics of burnt witches. The caravan  track we had now to travel on leads along the right bank of the Kingani  valley, overlooking Uzegura, which, corresponding with Uzaramo, only on  the other side of the Kigani, extends northwards to the Pangani river,  and is intersected in the centre by the Wami river, of which more  hereafter.    Starting on a march with a large mixed caravan, consisting of 1 corporal  and 9 privates, Hottentots--1 jemadar and 25 privates, Beluchs--1 Arab  Cafila Bashi and 75 freed slaves--1 Kirangozi, or leader, and 100 negro  porters--12 mules untrained, 3 donkeys, and 22 goats--one could hardly  expect to find everybody in his place at the proper time for breaking  ground; but, at the same time, it could hardly be expected that ten men,  who had actually received their bounty-money, and had sworn fidelity,  should give one the slip the very first day. Such, however, was the  case. Ten out of the thirty-six given by the Sultan ran away, because  they feared that the white men, whom they believed to be cannibals, were  only taking them into the interior to eat them; and one pagazi, more  honest than the freed men, deposited his pay upon the ground, and ran  away too. Go we must, however; for one desertion is sure to lead to  more; and go we did. Our procession was in this fashion: The Kirangozi,  with a load on his shoulder, led the way, flag in hand, followed by the  pagazis carrying spears of bows and arrows in their hands, and bearing  their share of the baggage in the shape either of bolster-shaped loads  of cloth and beads covered with matting, each tied into the fork of a  three-pronged stick, or else coils of brass or copper wire tied in even  weights to each end of sticks which they laid on the shoulder; then  helter-skelter came the Wanguana, carrying carbines in their hands, and  boxes, bundles, tents, cooking-pots--all the miscellaneous property--on  their heads; next the Hottentots, dragging the refractory mules laden  with ammunition-boxes, but very lightly, to save the animals for the  future; and, finally, Sheikh Said and the Beluch escort; while the  goats, sick women, and stragglers, brought up the rear. From first to  last, some of the sick Hottentots rode the hospital donkeys, allowing  the negroes to tug their animals; for the smallest ailment threw them  broadcast on their backs. In a little while we cleared from the rich  gardens, mango clumps, and cocoa-but trees, which characterise the  fertile coast-line. After traversing fields of grass well clothed with  green trees, we arrived at the little settlement of Bomani, where camp  was formed, and"]]]
