There are two classes of White Nile traders, the one possessing  capital, the other being penniless adventurers; the same system of  operations is pursued by both, but that of the former will be evident  from the description of the latter.    A man without means forms an expedition, and borrows money for this  purpose at 100 percent after this fashion. He agrees to repay the lender  in ivory at one-half its market value. Having obtained the required sum,  he hires several vessels and engages from 100 to 300 men, composed of  Arabs and runaway villains from distant countries, who have found an  asylum from justice in the obscurity of Khartoum. He purchases guns and  large quantities of ammunition for his men, together with a few hundred  pounds of glass beads. The piratical expedition being complete, he pays  his men five months' wages in advance, at the rate of forty-five  piastres (nine shillings) per month, and he agrees to give them eighty  piastres per month for any period exceeding the five months advanced.  His men receive their advance partly in cash and partly in cotton stuffs  for clothes at an exorbitant price. Every man has a strip of paper, upon  which is written by the clerk of the expedition the amount he has  received both in goods and money, and this paper he must produce at the  final settlement.    The vessels sail about December, and on arrival at the desired locality,  the party disembark and proceed into the interior, until they arrive at  the village of some negro chief, with whom they establish an intimacy.  Charmed with his new friends, the power of whose weapons he  acknowledges, the negro chief does not neglect the opportunity of  seeking their alliance to attack a hostile neighbour. Marching  throughout the night, guided by their negro hosts, they bivouac within  an hour's march of the unsuspecting village doomed to an attack about  half an hour before break of day. The time arrives, and, quietly  surrounding the village while its occupants are still sleeping, they  fire the grass huts in all directions, and pour volleys of musketry  through the flaming thatch. Panic-stricken, the unfortunate victims rush  from their burning dwellings, and the men are shot down like pheasants  in a battue, while the women and children, bewildered in the danger and  confusion, are kidnapped and secured. The herds of cattle, still within  their kraal or \"zareeba,\" are easily disposed of, and are driven off  with great rejoicing, as the prize of victory. The women and children  are then fastened together, the former secured in an instrument called a  sheba, made of a forked pole, the neck of the prisoner fitting into the  fork, secured by a cross piece lashed behind; while the wrists, brought  together in advance of the body, are tied to the pole. The children are  then fastened by their necks with a rope attached to the women, and thus  form a living chain, in which order they are marched to the headquarters  in company with the captured herds.    This is the commencement of business: should there be ivory in any of  the huts not destroyed by the fire, it is appropriated; a general  plunder takes place. The trader's party dig up the floors of the huts to  search for iron hoes, which are generally thus concealed, as the  greatest treasure of the negroes; the granaries are overturned and  wantonly destroyed, and the hands are cut off the bodies of the slain,  the more easily to detach the copper or iron bracelets that are usually  worn. With this booty the traders return to their negro ally: they have  thrashed and discomfited his enemy, which delights him; they present him  with thirty or forty head of cattle, which intoxicates him with joy, and  a present of a pretty little captive girl of about fourteen completes  his happiness.    But business only commenced. The negro covets cattle, and the trader has  now captured perhaps 2,000 head. They are to be had for ivory, and  shortly the tusks appear. Ivory is daily brought into camp in exchange  for cattle, a tusk for a cow, according to size--a profitable business,  as the cows have cost nothing. The trade proves brisk; but still there  remain some little customs to be observed--some slight formalities, well  understood by the White Nile trade. The slaves and two-thirds of the  captured cattle belong to the trader, but his men claim as their  perquisite one-third of the stolen animals. These having been divided,  the slaves are put up to public auction among the men, who purchase such  as they require; the amount being entered on the papers (serki) of the  purchasers, to be reckoned against their wages. To avoid the exposure,  should the document fall into the hands of the Government or European  consuls, the amount is not entered as for the purchase of a slave, but  is divided for fictitious supplies--thus, should a slave be purchased  for 1,000 piastres, that amount would appear on the document somewhat as  follows:        Soap . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 50 Piastres.      Tarboash(cap) . . . . . . . . . 100      Araki . . . . . . . . . . . . . 500      Shoes . . . . . . . . . . . . . 200      Cotton Cloth . . . . . . . . .  150      Total                         1,000    The slaves sold to the men are constantly being changed and resold among  themselves; but should the relatives of the kidnapped women and children  wish to ransom them, the trader takes them from his men, cancels the  amount of purchase, and restores them to their relations for a certain  number of elephants' tusks, as may be agreed upon. Should any slave  attempt to escape, she is punished either by brutal flogging, or shot or  hanged, as a warning to others.    An attack or razzia, such as described, generally leads to a quarrel  with the negro ally, who in his turn is murdered and plundered by the  trader--his women and children naturally becoming slaves.    A good season for a party of a hundred and fifty men should produce  about two hundred cantars (20,000 lbs.) of ivory, valued at Khartoum at  4,000 pounds. The men being paid in slaves, the wages should be nil, and  there should be a surplus of four or five hundred slaves for the  trader's own profit--worth on an average five to six pounds each.    The boats are accordingly packed with a human cargo, and a portion of  the trader's men accompany them to the Soudan, while the remainder of  the party form a camp or settlement in the country they have adopted,  and industriously plunder, massacre, and enslave, until their master's  return with the boats from Khartoum in the following season, by which  time they are supposed to have a cargo of slaves and ivory ready for  shipment. The business thus thoroughly established, the slaves are  landed at various points within a few days' journey of Khartoum, at  which places are agents, or purchasers; waiting to receive them with  dollars prepared for cash payments. The purchasers and dealers are, for  the most part, Arabs. The slaves are then marched across the country to  different places; many to Sennaar, where they are sold to other dealers,  who sell them to the Arabs and to the Turks. Others are taken immense  distances to ports on the Red Sea, Souakim, and Masowa, there to be  shipped for Arabia and Persia. Many are sent to Cairo, and in fact they  are disseminated throughout the slave-dealing East, the White Nile being  the great nursery for the supply.    The amiable trader returns from the White Nile to Khartoum; hands over  to his creditor sufficient ivory to liquidate the original loan of  1,000 pounds, and, already a man of capital, he commences as an  independent trader.    Such was the White Nile trade when I prepared to start from Khartoum on  my expedition to the Nile sources. Every one in Khartoum, with the  exception of a few Europeans, was in favor of the slave trade, and  looked with jealous eyes upon a stranger venturing within the precincts  of their holy land; a land sacred to slavery and to every abomination  and villany that man can commit.    The Turkish officials pretended to discountenance slavery: at the same  time every house in Khartoum was full of slaves, and the Egyptian  officers had been in the habit of receiving a portion of their pay in  slaves, precisely as the men employed on the White Nile were paid by  their employers. The Egyptian authorities looked upon the exploration of  the White Nile by a European traveller as an infringement of their slave  territory that resulted from espionage, and every obstacle was thrown in  my way.    Foreseeing many difficulties, I had been supplied, before leaving Egypt,  with a firman from H. E. Said Pasha the Viceroy, by the request of H. B.  M. agent, Sir R. Colquhoun; but this document was ignored by the  Governor-general of the Soudan, Moosa Pasha, under the miserable  prevarication that the firman was for the Pasha's dominions and for the  Nile; whereas the White Nile was not accepted as the Nile, but was known  as the White River. I was thus refused boats, and in fact all  assistance.    To organize an enterprise so difficult that it had hitherto defeated the  whole world required a careful selection of attendants, and I looked  with despair at the prospect before me. The only men procurable for  escort were the miserable cutthroats of Khartoum, accustomed to murder  and pillage. in the White Nile trade, and excited not by the love of  adventure but by the desire for plunder: to start with such men appeared  mere insanity. There was a still greater difficulty in connection with  the White Nile. For years the infernal traffic in slaves and its  attendant horrors had existed like a pestilence in the negro countries,  and had so exasperated the tribes, that people who in former times were  friendly had become hostile to all comers. An exploration to the Nile  sources was thus a march"]]]
