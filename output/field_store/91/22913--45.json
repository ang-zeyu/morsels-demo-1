They will not believe with him that all beauty and harmony  in the world are but symbolic, and that behind these stand unseen  sustaining forces and powers which are conscious and eternal; and though  by instinct they willingly personify Nature they do not know the secret  of why they do so: for them the outer is reality, the inner  non-existent.    From the Age of Stone to the civilized era of to-day, the Isle of Man  has been, in succession, the home of every known race and people who  have flourished in Western Europe; and though subject, in turn, to the  Irish Gael and to the Welsh Brython, to Northmen and to Danes, to Scots  and to English, and the scene of sweeping transformations in religion,  as pagan cults succeeded one another, to give way to the teaching of St.  Patrick and his disciples St. German and St. Maughold, and this finally  to the Protestant form of Christianity, the island alone of Celtic lands  has been strangely empowered to maintain in almost primitive purity its  ancient constitution and freedom, and though geographically at the very  centre of the United Kingdom, is not a part of it. The archaeologist may  still read in mysterious symbols of stone and earth, as they lie strewn  over the island's surface, the history of this age-long panoramic  procession of human evolution; while through these same symbols the Manx  seer reads a deeper meaning; and sometimes in the superhuman realm of  radiant light, to which since long ago they have oft come and oft  returned, he meets face to face the gods and heroes whose early tombs  stand solitary on the wind-swept mountain-top and moorland, or hidden  away in the embrace of wild flowers and verdure amid valleys; and in the  darker mid-world he sees innumerable ghosts of many of these races which  have perished.      IN WALES    Less can be said of Wales than of Ireland, or of Scotland as a whole. It  has, it is true, its own peculiar psychic atmosphere, different, no  doubt, because its people are Brythonic Celts rather than Gaelic Celts.  But Wales, with conditions more modernized than is the case in Ireland  or in the Western Hebrides of Scotland, does not now exhibit in a  vigorous or flourishing state those Celtic influences which, when they  were active, did so much to create the precious Romances of Arthur and  his Brotherhood, and to lay the foundations for the Welsh belief in the  _Tylwyth Teg_, a fairy race still surviving in a few favoured  localities.    Wales, like all Celtic countries, is a land of long sea-coasts, though  there seems to be, save in the mountains of the north, less of mist and  darkness and cloud effects than in Ireland and Scotland. In the south,  perhaps the most curious influences are to be felt at St. David's Head,  and in St. David's itself--once the goal for thousands of pilgrims from  many countries of mediaeval Europe, and, probably, in pagan times the  seat of an oracle. And a place of like character is the peninsula of  Gower, south of Swansea. Caerphilly Castle, where the Green Lady reigns  now amid its ruined acres, is a strange place; and so is the hill near  Carmarthen, where Merlin is asleep in a cave with the fairy-woman  Vivian. But in none of these places to-day is there a strong living  faith in fairies as there is, for example, in West Ireland. The one  region where I found a real Celtic atmosphere--and it is a region where  everybody speaks Welsh--is a mountainous country rarely visited by  travellers, save archaeologists, a few miles from Newport; and its  centre is the Pentre Evan Cromlech, the finest cromlech in Wales if not  in Britain. By this prehistoric monument and in the country round the  old Nevern Church, three miles away, there is an active belief in the  'fair-folk', in ghosts, in death-warnings, in death-candles and  phantom-funerals, and in witchcraft and black magic. Thence on to  Newcastle-Emlyn and its valley, where many of the Mabinogion stories  took form, or at least from where they drew rich material in the way of  folk-lore,[7] are environments purely Welsh and as yet little disturbed  by the commercial materialism of the age.    There remain now to be mentioned three other places in Wales to me very  impressive psychically. These are: ancient Harlech, so famous in  recorded Welsh fairy-romance--Harlech with its strange stone-circles,  and old castle from which the Snowdon Range is seen to loom majestically  and clear, and with its sun-kissed bay; Mount Snowdon, with its memories  of Arthur and Welsh heroes; and sacred Anglesey or Mona, strewn with  tumuli, and dolmens, and pillar-stones--Mona, where the Druids made  their last stand against the Roman eagles--and its little island called  Holyhead, facing Ireland.    However, when all is said, modern Wales is poorer in its fairy  atmosphere than modern Ireland or modern Brittany. Certainly there is a  good deal of this fairy atmosphere yet, though it has become less vital  than the similar fairy atmosphere in the great centres of Erin and  Armorica. But the purely social environment under which the Fairy-Faith  of Wales survives is a potent force which promises to preserve  underneath the surface of Welsh national life, where the commercialism  of the age has compelled it to retire in a state of temporary latency,  the ancestral idealism of the ancient Brythonic race. In Wales, as in  Lower Brittany and in parts of Ireland and the Hebrides, one may still  hear in common daily use a language which has been continuously spoken  since unknown centuries before the rise of the Roman empire. And the  strong hold which the Druidic _Eisteddfod_ (an annual national congress  of bards and literati) continues to have upon the Welsh people, in spite  of their commercialism, is, again, a sign that their hearts remain  uncorrupted, that when the more favourable hour strikes they will sweep  aside the deadening influences which now hold them in spiritual bondage,  and become, as they were in the past, true children of Arthur.      IN CORNWALL    Strikingly like Brittany in physical aspects, Southern and Western  Cornwall is a land of the sea, of rolling plains and moorlands rather  than of high hills and mountains, a land of golden-yellow furze-bloom,  where noisy crowds of black crows and white sea-gulls mingle together  over the freshly-turned or new-sown fields, and where in the spring-time  the call of the cuckoo is heard with the song of the skylark. Like the  Isle of Man, from the earliest ages Cornwall has been a meeting-place  and a battle-ground for contending races. The primitive dark Iberian  peoples gave way before Aryan-Celtic invaders, and these to Roman and  then to Germanic invaders.    Nature has been kind to the whole of Cornwall, but chiefly upon the  peninsula whose ancient capital is Penzance (which possibly means 'the  Holy Headland'), and upon the land immediately eastward and northward of  it, she has bestowed her rarest gifts. Holding this territory embosomed  in the pure waters of Ocean, and breathing over it the pure air of the  Atlantic in spring and in summer calm, when the warm vapours from the  Gulf Stream sweep over it freely, and make it a land of flowers and of  singing-birds, Nature preserves eternally its beauty and its sanctity.  There are there ruined British villages whose builders are long  forgotten, strange prehistoric circular sun-temples like fortresses  crowning the hill-tops, mysterious underground passage-ways, and crosses  probably pre-Christian. Everywhere are the records of the mighty past of  this thrice-holy Druid land of sunset. There are weird legends of the  lost kingdom of Fair Lyonesse, which seers sometimes see beneath the  clear salt waves, with all its ancient towns and flowery fields; legends  of Phoenicians and Oriental merchants who came for tin; legends of gods  and of giants, of pixies and of fairies, of King Arthur in his castle at  Tintagel, of angels and of saints, of witches and of wizards.    On _Dinsul_, 'Hill dedicated to the Sun,' pagan priests and priestesses  kept kindled the Eternal Fire, and daily watched eastward for the rising  of the God of Light and Life, to greet his coming with paeans of  thanksgiving and praise. Then after the sixth century the new religion  had come proclaiming a more mystic Light of the World in the Son of God,  and to the pious half-pagan monks who succeeded the Druids the Archangel  St. Michael appeared in vision on the Sacred Mount.[8] And before St.  Augustine came to Britain the Celts of Cornwall had already combined in  their own mystical way the spiritual message of primitive Christianity  with the pure nature-worship of their ancestors; and their land was  then, as it most likely had been in pagan days, a centre of pilgrimages  for their Celtic kinsmen from Ireland, from Wales, from England, and  from Brittany. When in later times new theological doctrines were  superimposed on this mysticism of Celtic Christianity, the Sacred Fires  were buried in ashes, and the Light and Beauty of the pagan world  obscured with sackcloth.    But there in that most southern and western corner of the Isle of  Britain, the Sacred Fires themselves still burn on the divine hill-tops,  though smothered in the hearts of its children. The Cornishman's vision  is no longer clear. He looks upon cromlech and dolmen, upon ancient  caves of initiation, and upon the graves of his prehistoric ancestors,  and vaguely feels, but does not know, why his land is so holy, is so  permeated by an indefinable magic; for he has lost his ancestral mystic  touch with the unseen--he is 'educated' and 'civilized'. The hand of the  conqueror has fallen more heavily upon the people of Cornwall than upon  any other Celtic people, and now for a time, but let us hope happily  only for this dark period of transition, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34856"],[0,"My Own Story (#7)"],[1,"college--and now the corporations had full control  of both elementary and secondary education.    The law did indeed provide that the corporations should co-opt at least  one woman on their education boards. Manchester co-opted four women, and  at the strong recommendation of the Labour Party, I was one of the  women chosen. At their urgent solicitation I was appointed to the  Committee on Technical Instruction, the one woman admitted to this  committee. I learned that the Manchester Technical College, called the  second best in Europe, spending thousands of pounds annually for  technical training, had practically no provision for training women.  Even in classes where they might easily have been admitted, bakery and  confectionery classes and the like, the girls were kept out because the  men's trades unions objected to their being educated for such skilled  work. It was rapidly becoming clear to my mind that men regarded women  as a servant class in the community, and that women were going to remain  in the servant class until they lifted themselves out of it. I asked  myself many times in those days what was to be done. I had joined the  Labour Party, thinking that through its councils something vital might  come, some such demand for the women's enfranchisement that the  politicians could not possibly ignore. Nothing came.    All these years my daughters had been growing up. All their lives they  had been interested in women's suffrage. Christabel and Sylvia, as  little girls, had cried to be taken to meetings. They had helped in our  drawing-room meetings in every way that children can help. As they grew  older we used to talk together about the suffrage, and I was sometimes  rather frightened by their youthful confidence in the prospect, which  they considered certain, of the success of the movement. One day  Christabel startled me with the remark: \"How long you women have been  trying for the vote. For my part, I mean to get it.\"    Was there, I reflected, any difference between trying for the vote and  getting it? There is an old French proverb, \"If youth could know; if age  could do.\" It occurred to me that if the older suffrage workers could in  some way join hands with the young, unwearied and resourceful  suffragists, the movement might wake up to new life and new  possibilities. After that I and my daughters together sought a way to  bring about that union of young and old which would find new methods,  blaze new trails. At length we thought we had found a way.          CHAPTER III      In the summer of 1902--I think it was 1902--Susan B. Anthony paid a  visit to Manchester, and that visit was one of the contributory causes  that led to the founding of our militant suffrage organisation, the  Women's Social and Political Union. During Miss Anthony's visit my  daughter Christabel, who was very deeply impressed, wrote an article for  the Manchester papers on the life and works of the venerable reformer.  After her departure Christabel spoke often of her, and always with  sorrow and indignation that such a splendid worker for humanity was  destined to die without seeing the hopes of her lifetime realised. \"It  is unendurable,\" declared my daughter, \"to think of another generation  of women wasting their lives begging for the vote. We must not lose any  more time. We must act.\"    By this time the Labour Party, of which I was still a member, had  returned Mr. Keir Hardie to Parliament, and we decided that the first  step in a campaign of action was to make the Labour Party responsible  for a new suffrage bill. At a recent annual conference of the party I  had moved a resolution calling upon the members to instruct their own  member of Parliament to introduce a bill for the enfranchisement of  women. The resolution was passed, and we determined to organise a  society of women to demand immediate enfranchisement, not by means of  any outworn missionary methods, but through political action.    It was in October, 1903, that I invited a number of women to my house in  Nelson street, Manchester, for purposes of organisation. We voted to  call our new society the Women's Social and Political Union, partly to  emphasise its democracy, and partly to define its object as political  rather than propagandist. We resolved to limit our membership  exclusively to women, to keep ourselves absolutely free from any party  affiliation, and to be satisfied with nothing but action on our  question. Deeds, not words, was to be our permanent motto.    To such a pass had the women's suffrage cause come in my country that  the old leaders, who had done such fine educational work in the past,  were now seemingly content with expressions of sympathy and regret on  the part of hypocritical politicians. This fact was thrust upon me anew  by an incident that occurred almost at the moment of the founding of the  Women's Social and Political Union. In our Parliament no bill has a  chance of becoming a law unless it is made a Government measure. Private  members are at liberty to introduce measures of their own, but these  rarely reach the second reading, or debatable stage. So much time is  given to discussion of Government measures that very little time can be  given to any private bills. About one day in a week is given over to  consideration of private measures, to which, as we say, the Government  give facilities; and since there are a limited number of weeks in a  session, the members, on the opening days of Parliament, meet and draw  lots to determine who shall have a place in the debates. Only these  successful men have a chance to speak to their bills, and only those who  have drawn early chances have any prospect of getting much discussion on  their measures.    Now, the old suffragists had long since given up hope of obtaining a  Government suffrage bill, but they clung to a hope that a private  member's bill would some time obtain consideration. Every year, on the  opening day of Parliament, the association sent a deputation of women to  the House of Commons, to meet so-called friendly members and consider  the position of the women's suffrage cause. The ceremony was of a most  conventional, not to say farcical character. The ladies made their  speeches and the members made theirs. The ladies thanked the friendly  members for their sympathy, and the members renewed their assurances  that they believed in women's suffrage and would vote for it when they  had an opportunity to do so. Then the deputation, a trifle sad but  entirely tranquil, took its departure, and the members resumed the real  business of life, which was support of their party's policies.    Such a ceremony as this I attended soon after the founding of the  W. S. P. U. Sir Charles M'Laren was the friendly member who presided  over the gathering, and he did his full duty in the matter of formally  endorsing the cause of women's suffrage. He assured the delegation of  his deep regret, as well as the regret of numbers of his colleagues,  that women so intelligent, so devoted, etc., should remain  unenfranchised. Other members did likewise. The ceremonies drew to a  close, but I, who had not been asked to speak, determined to add  something to the occasion.    \"Sir Charles M'Laren,\" I began abruptly, \"has told us that numbers of  his colleagues desire the success of the women's suffrage cause. Now  every one of us knows that at this moment the members of the House of  Commons are balloting for a place in the debates. Will Sir Charles  M'Laren tell us if any member is preparing to introduce a bill for  women's suffrage? Will he tell us what he and the other members will  pledge themselves to _do_ for the reform they so warmly endorse?\"    Of course, the embarrassed Sir Charles was not prepared to tell us  anything of the kind, and the deputation departed in confusion and  wrath. I was told that I was an interloper, an impertinent intruder. Who  asked me to say anything? And what right had I to step in and ruin the  good impression they had made? No one could tell how many friendly  members I had alienated by my unfortunate remarks.    I went back to Manchester and with renewed energy continued the work of  organising for the W. S. P. U.    In the spring of 1904 I went to the annual conference of the Independent  Labour Party, determined if possible to induce the members to prepare a  suffrage bill to be laid before Parliament in the approaching session.  Although I was a member of the National Administrative Council and  presumably a person holding some influence in the party, I knew that my  plan would be bitterly opposed by a strong minority, who held that the  Labour Party should direct all its efforts toward securing universal  adult suffrage for both men and women. Theoretically, of course, a  Labour party could not be satisfied with anything less than universal  adult suffrage, but it was clear that no such sweeping reform could be  effected at that time, unless indeed the Government made it one of their  measures. Besides, while a large majority of members of the House of  Commons were pledged to support a bill giving women equal franchise  rights with men, it was doubtful whether a majority could be relied upon  to support a bill giving adult suffrage, even to men. Such a bill, even  if it were a Government measure, would probably be difficult of passage.    After considerable discussion, the National Council decided to adopt the  original Women's Enfranchisement Bill, drafted by Dr. Pankhurst, and  advanced in 1870 to its second reading in the House of Commons. The  Council's decision was approved by an overwhelming majority of the  conference.    The new session of Parliament, so eagerly looked forward to, met on  February 13, 1905. I went down from Manchester, and with my daughter  Sylvia, then a student at the Royal College of Art, South Kensington,  spent eight days in the Strangers' Lobby of the House of Commons,  working for the suffrage"]]]
