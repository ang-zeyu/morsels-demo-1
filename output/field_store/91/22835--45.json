Cattle \"on the road\" are unaccountable animals; one cannot  say for certain what they will do. In this respect they differ from  sheep, whose movements can be predicted with absolute certainty.    All the cussedness of the bovine race is centred in the cow. In  Australia the most opprobious epithet one can apply to a man or other  object is \"cow\". In the whole range of a bullock-driver's vocabulary  there is no word that expresses his blistering scorn so well as \"cow\".  To an exaggerated feminine perversity the cow adds a fiendish ingenuity  in making trouble.    A quiet milking-cow will \"plant\" her calf with such skill that ten  stockmen cannot find him in a one-mile paddock. While the search goes on  she grazes unconcernedly, as if she never had a calf in her life. If  by chance he be discovered, then one notices a curious thing. The very  youngest calf, the merest staggering-Bob two days old, will not move  till the old lady gives him orders to do so. One may pull him about  without getting a move out of him. If sufficiently persecuted he will  at last sing out for help, and then his mother will arrive full-gallop,  charge men and horses indiscriminately, and clear out with him to the  thickest timber in the most rugged part of the creek-bed, defying man to  get her to the yard.    While in his mother's company he seconds her efforts with great  judgment. But, if he be separated from her, he will follow a horse and  rider up to the yard thinking he is following his mother, though  she bellow instructions to him from the rear. Then the guileless  agriculturist, having penned him up, sets a dog on him, and his cries  soon fetch the old cow full-run to his assistance. Once in the yard  she is roped, hauled into the bail, propped up to prevent her throwing  herself down, and milked by sheer brute-force. After a while she  steadies down and will walk into the bail, knowing her turn and behaving  like a respectable female.    Cows and calves have no idea of sound or distance. If a cow is on the  opposite side of the fence, and wishes to communicate with her calf, she  will put her head through the fence, place her mouth against his ear as  if she were going to whisper, and then utter a roar that can be heard  two miles off. It would stun a human being; but the calf thinks it over  for a moment, and then answers with a prolonged yell in the old cow's  ear. So the dialogue goes on for hours without either party dropping  dead.    There is an element of danger in dealing with cattle that makes men  smart and self-reliant and independent. Men who deal with sheep get  gloomy and morbid, and are for ever going on strike. Nobody ever heard  of a stockman's strike. The true stockrider thinks himself just as good  a man as his boss, and inasmuch as \"the boss\" never makes any money,  while the stockman gets his wages, the stockman may be considered as  having the better position of the two.    Sheepmen like to think that they know all about cattle, and could work  them if they chose. A Queensland drover once took a big mob from the  Gulf right down through New South Wales, selling various lots as he  went. He had to deliver some to a small sheep-man, near Braidwood, who  was buying a few hundred cattle as a spec. By the time they arrived, the  cattle had been on the road eight months, and were quiet as milkers. But  the sheep-man and his satellites came out, riding stable-fed horses  and brandishing twenty-foot whips, all determined to sell their lives  dearly. They galloped round the astonished cattle and spurred their  horses and cracked their whips, till they roused the weary mob. Then  they started to cut out the beasts they wanted. The horses rushed and  pulled, and the whips maddened the cattle, and all was turmoil and  confusion.    The Queensland drovers looked on amazed, sitting their patient leg-weary  horses they had ridden almost continuously for eight months. At last,  seeing the hash the sheep-men were making of it, the drovers set to  work, and in a little while, without a shout, or crack of a whip, had  cut out the required number. These the head drover delivered to the  buyer, simply remarking, \"Many's the time _you_ never cut-out cattle.\"    As I write, there rises a vision of a cattle-camp on an open plain,  the blue sky overhead, the long grass rustling below, the great mob of  parti-coloured cattle eddying restlessly about, thrusting at each other  with their horns; and in among the sullen half-savage animals go the  light, wiry stock-riders, horse and man working together, watchful,  quick, and resolute.    A white steer is wanted that is right in the throng. Way!--make way! and  horse and rider edge into the restless sea of cattle, the man with his  eye fixed on the selected animal, the horse, glancing eagerly about him,  trying to discover which is the wanted one. The press divides and the  white steer scuttles along the edge of the mob trying to force his way  in again. Suddenly he and two or three others are momentarily eddied out  to the outskirts of the mob, and in that second the stockman dashes his  horse between them and the main body. The lumbering beasts rush hither  and thither in a vain attempt to return to their comrades. Those not  wanted are allowed to return, but the white steer finds, to his  dismay, that wherever he turns that horse and man and dreaded whip are  confronting him. He doubles and dodges and makes feints to charge,  but the horse anticipates every movement and wheels quicker than the  bullock. At last the white steer sees the outlying mob he is required to  join, and trots off to them quite happy, while horse and rider return to  cut out another.    It is a pretty exhibition of skill and intelligence, doubly pleasant to  watch because of the undoubted interest that the horses take in it. Big,  stupid creatures that they are, cursed with highly-strung nerves, and  blessed with little sense, they are pathetically anxious to do such  work as they can understand. So they go into the cutting-out camp with a  zest, and toil all day edging lumbering bullocks out of the mob, but as  soon as a bad rider gets on them and begins to haul their mouths about,  their nerves overcome them, and they get awkward and frightened. A horse  that is a crack camp-horse in one man's hands may be a hopeless brute in  the hands of another.          WHITE-WHEN-HE'S-WANTED      Buckalong was a big freehold of some 80,000 acres, belonging to an  absentee syndicate, and therefore run in most niggardly style. There was  a manager on 200 pounds a year, Sandy M'Gregor to wit--a hard-headed old  Scotchman known as \"four-eyed M'Gregor\", because he wore spectacles.  For assistants, he had half-a-dozen of us--jackaroos and  colonial-experiencers--who got nothing a year, and earned it.    We had, in most instances, paid premiums to learn the noble art of  squatting--which now appears to me hardly worth studying, for so much  depends on luck that a man with a head as long as a horse's has little  better chance than the fool just imported. Besides the manager and the  jackaroos, there were a few boundary riders to prowl round the fences of  the vast paddocks. This constituted the whole station staff.    Buckalong was on one of the main routes by which stock were taken to  market, or from the plains to the tablelands, and vice versa. Great mobs  of travelling sheep constantly passed through the run, eating up the  grass and vexing the soul of the manager. By law, sheep must travel six  miles per day, and they must be kept to within half-a-mile of the road.  Of course we kept all the grass near the road eaten bare, to discourage  travellers from coming that way.    Such hapless wretches as did venture through Buckalong used to try hard  to stray from the road and pick up a feed, but old Sandy was always  ready for them, and would have them dogged right through the run. This  bred feuds, and bad language, and personal combats between us and the  drovers, whom we looked upon as natural enemies.    The men who came through with mobs of cattle used to pull down the  paddock fences at night, and slip the cattle in for refreshments, but  old Sandy often turned out at 2 or 3 a.m. to catch a mob of bullocks  in the horse-paddock, and then off they went to Buckalong pound. The  drovers, as in duty bound, attributed the trespass to accident--broken  rails, and so on--and sometimes they tried to rescue the cattle, which  again bred strife and police-court summonses.    Besides having a particular aversion to drovers, old M'Gregor had  a general \"down\" on the young Australians whom he comprehensively  described as a \"feckless, horrse-dealin', horrse-stealin', crawlin' lot  o' wretches.\" According to him, a native-born would sooner work a horse  to death than work for a living any day. He hated any man who wanted to  sell him a horse.    \"As aw walk the street,\" he used to say, \"the fouk disna stawp me to buy  claes nor shoon, an' wheerfore should they stawp me to buy horrses? It's  'Mister M'Gregor, will ye purrchase a horrse?' Let them wait till I ask  them to come wi' their horrses.\"    Such being his views on horseflesh and drovers, we felt no little  excitement when one Sunday, at dinner, the cook came in to say there  was \"a drover-chap outside wanted the boss to come and have a look at  a horse.\" M'Gregor simmered a while, and muttered something about the  \"Sawbath day\"; but at last he went out, and we filed after him to see  the fun.    The drover stood by the side of his horse, beneath the acacia trees  in the yard. He had a big scar on his face, apparently the result  of collision with a fence; he looked thin and sickly and seemed  poverty-stricken enough to disarm hostility. Obviously, he was down on  his luck. Had it not been for that indefinable self-reliant look which  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30754"],[0,"The Stones of Venice, Volume 1 (of 3) (#7)"],[1," buildings of the world, the Pisan-Romanesque, Tuscan (Giottesque)  Gothic, and Veronese Gothic, are those of the Lombard schools  themselves, under its close and direct influence; the various Gothics of  the North are the original forms of the architecture which the Lombards  brought into Italy, changing under the less direct influence of the  Arab.    Sec. XXX. Understanding thus much of the formation of the great European  styles, we shall have no difficulty in tracing the succession of  architectures in Venice herself. From what I said of the central  character of Venetian art, the reader is not, of course, to conclude  that the Roman, Northern, and Arabian elements met together and  contended for the mastery at the same period. The earliest element was  the pure Christian Roman; but few, if any, remains of this art exist at  Venice; for the present city was in the earliest times only one of many  settlements formed on the chain of marshy islands which extend from the  mouths of the Isonzo to those of the Adige, and it was not until the  beginning of the ninth century that it became the seat of government;  while the cathedral of Torcello, though Christian Roman in general form,  was rebuilt in the eleventh century, and shows evidence of Byzantine  workmanship in many of its details. This cathedral, however, with the  church of Santa Fosca at Torcello, San Giacomo di Rialto at Venice, and  the crypt of St. Mark's, forms a distinct group of buildings, in which  the Byzantine influence is exceedingly slight; and which is probably  very sufficiently representative of the earliest architecture on the  islands.    Sec. XXXI. The Ducal residence was removed to Venice in 809, and the  body of St. Mark was brought from Alexandria twenty years later. The  first church of St. Mark's was, doubtless, built in imitation of that  destroyed at Alexandria, and from which the relics of the saint had been  obtained. During the ninth, tenth, and eleventh centuries, the  architecture of Venice seems to have been formed on the same model, and  is almost identical with that of Cairo under the caliphs,[22] it being  quite immaterial whether the reader chooses to call both Byzantine or  both Arabic; the workmen being certainly Byzantine, but forced to the  invention of new forms by their Arabian masters, and bringing these  forms into use in whatever other parts of the world they were employed.    To this first manner of Venetian architecture, together with vestiges as  remain of the Christian Roman, I shall devote the first division of the  following inquiry. The examples remaining of it consist of three noble  churches (those of Torcello, Murano, and the greater part of St.  Mark's), and about ten or twelve fragments of palaces.    Sec. XXXII. To this style succeeds a transitional one, of a character  much more distinctly Arabian: the shafts become more slender, and the  arches consistently pointed, instead of round; certain other changes,  not to be enumerated in a sentence, taking place in the capitals and  mouldings. This style is almost exclusively secular. It was natural  for the Venetians to imitate the beautiful details of the Arabian  dwelling-house, while they would with reluctance adopt those of the  mosque for Christian churches.    I have not succeeded in fixing limiting dates for this style. It appears  in part contemporary with the Byzantine manner, but outlives it. Its  position is, however, fixed by the central date, 1180, that of the  elevation of the granite shafts of the Piazetta, whose capitals are the  two most important pieces of detail in this transitional style in  Venice. Examples of its application to domestic buildings exist in  almost every street of the city, and will form the subject of the second  division of the following essay.    Sec. XXXIII. The Venetians were always ready to receive lessons in art  from their enemies (else had there been no Arab work in Venice). But their  especial dread and hatred of the Lombards appears to have long prevented  them from receiving the influence of the art which that people had  introduced on the mainland of Italy. Nevertheless, during the practice  of the two styles above distinguished, a peculiar and very primitive  condition of pointed Gothic had arisen in ecclesiastical architecture.  It appears to be a feeble reflection of the Lombard-Arab forms, which  were attaining perfection upon the continent, and would probably, if  left to itself, have been soon merged in the Venetian-Arab school, with  which it had from the first so close a fellowship, that it will be found  difficult to distinguish the Arabian ogives from those which seem to  have been built under this early Gothic influence. The churches of San  Giacopo dell'Orio, San Giovanni in Bragora, the Carmine, and one or two  more, furnish the only important examples of it. But, in the thirteenth  century, the Franciscans and Dominicans introduced from the continent  their morality and their architecture, already a distinct Gothic,  curiously developed from Lombardic and Northern (German?) forms; and the  influence of the principles exhibited in the vast churches of St. Paul  and the Frari began rapidly to affect the Venetian-Arab school. Still  the two systems never became united; the Venetian policy repressed the  power of the church, and the Venetian artists resisted its example; and  thenceforward the architecture of the city becomes divided into  ecclesiastical and civil: the one an ungraceful yet powerful form of the  Western Gothic, common to the whole peninsula, and only showing Venetian  sympathies in the adoption of certain characteristic mouldings; the  other a rich, luxuriant, and entirely original Gothic, formed from the  Venetian-Arab by the influence of the Dominican and Franciscan  architecture, and especially by the engrafting upon the Arab forms of  the most novel feature of the Franciscan work, its traceries. These  various forms of Gothic, the _distinctive_ architecture of Venice,  chiefly represented by the churches of St. John and Paul, the Frari, and  San Stefano, on the ecclesiastical side, and by the Ducal palace, and  the other principal Gothic palaces, on the secular side, will be the  subject of the third division of the essay.    Sec. XXXIV. Now observe. The transitional (or especially Arabic) style  of the Venetian work is centralised by the date 1180, and is transformed  gradually into the Gothic, which extends in its purity from the middle  of the thirteenth to the beginning of the fifteenth century; that is to  say, over the precise period which I have described as the central epoch  of the life of Venice. I dated her decline from the year 1418; Foscari  became doge five years later, and in his reign the first marked signs  appear in architecture of that mighty change which Philippe de Commynes  notices as above, the change to which London owes St. Paul's, Rome St.  Peter's, Venice and Vicenza the edifices commonly supposed to be their  noblest, and Europe in general the degradation of every art she has  since practised.    Sec. XXXV. This change appears first in a loss of truth and vitality in  existing architecture all over the world. (Compare \"Seven Lamps,\" chap.  ii.) All the Gothics in existence, southern or northern, were corrupted  at once: the German and French lost themselves in every species of  extravagance; the English Gothic was confined, in its insanity, by a  strait-waistcoat of perpendicular lines; the Italian effloresced on the  mainland into the meaningless ornamentation of the Certosa of Pavia and  the Cathedral of Como (a style sometimes ignorantly called Italian  Gothic), and at Venice into the insipid confusion of the Porta della  Carta and wild crockets of St. Mark's. This corruption of all  architecture, especially ecclesiastical, corresponded with, and marked  the state of religion over all Europe,--the peculiar degradation of the  Romanist superstition, and of public morality in consequence, which  brought about the Reformation.    Sec. XXXVI. Against the corrupted papacy arose two great divisions of  adversaries, Protestants in Germany and England, Rationalists in France  and Italy; the one requiring the purification of religion, the other its  destruction. The Protestant kept the religion, but cast aside the  heresies of Rome, and with them her arts, by which last rejection he  injured his own character, cramped his intellect in refusing to it one  of its noblest exercises, and materially diminished his influence. It  may be a serious question how far the Pausing of the Reformation has  been a consequence of this error.    The Rationalist kept the arts and cast aside the religion. This  rationalistic art is the art commonly called Renaissance, marked by a  return to pagan systems, not to adopt them and hallow them for  Christianity, but to rank itself under them as an imitator and pupil. In  Painting it is headed by Giulio Romano and Nicolo Poussin; in  Architecture by Sansovino and Palladio.    Sec. XXXVII. Instant degradation followed in every direction,--a flood of  folly and hypocrisy. Mythologies ill understood at first, then perverted  into feeble sensualities, take the place of the representations of  Christian subjects, which had become blasphemous under the treatment of  men like the Caracci. Gods without power, satyrs without rusticity,  nymphs without innocence, men without humanity, gather into idiot groups  upon the polluted canvas, and scenic affectations encumber the streets  with preposterous marble. Lower and lower declines the level of abused  intellect; the base school of landscape[23] gradually usurps the place  of the historical painting, which had sunk into prurient pedantry,--the  Alsatian sublimities of Salvator, the confectionery idealities of  Claude, the dull manufacture of Gaspar and Canaletto, south of the Alps,  and on the north the patient devotion of besotted lives to delineation  of bricks and fogs, fat"]]]
