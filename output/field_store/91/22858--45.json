[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32032"],[0,"Second Variety (#7)"],[1,"   Klaus considered. \"I don't know. Get them to come up to the surface.  So you can see.\"    Hendricks brought his transmitter from his belt, raising the antenna.  \"Let's get started.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Klaus signalled to Tasso. She crawled expertly up the side of the rise  to where they were sitting.    \"He's going down alone,\" Klaus said. \"We'll cover him from here. As  soon as you see him start back, fire past him at once. They come  quick.\"    \"You're not very optimistic,\" Tasso said.    \"No, I'm not.\"    Hendricks opened the breech of his gun, checking it carefully. \"Maybe  things are all right.\"    \"You didn't see them. Hundreds of them. All the same. Pouring out like  ants.\"    \"I should be able to find out without going down all the way.\"  Hendricks locked his gun, gripping it in one hand, the transmitter in  the other. \"Well, wish me luck.\"    Klaus put out his hand. \"Don't go down until you're sure. Talk to them  from up here. Make them show themselves.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Hendricks stood up. He stepped down the side of the rise.    A moment later he was walking slowly toward the pile of bricks and  debris beside the dead tree stump. Toward the entrance of the forward  command bunker.    Nothing stirred. He raised the transmitter, clicking it on. \"Scott?  Can you hear me?\"    Silence.    \"Scott! This is Hendricks. Can you hear me? I'm standing outside the  bunker. You should be able to see me in the view sight.\"    He listened, the transmitter gripped tightly. No sound. Only static.  He walked forward. A claw burrowed out of the ash and raced toward  him. It halted a few feet away and then slunk off. A second claw  appeared, one of the big ones with feelers. It moved toward him,  studied him intently, and then fell in behind him, dogging  respectfully after him, a few paces away. A moment later a second big  claw joined it. Silently, the claws trailed him, as he walked slowly  toward the bunker.    Hendricks stopped, and behind him, the claws came to a halt. He was  close, now. Almost to the bunker steps.    \"Scott! Can you hear me? I'm standing right above you. Outside. On the  surface. Are you picking me up?\"           *       *       *       *       *    He waited, holding his gun against his side, the transmitter tightly  to his ear. Time passed. He strained to hear, but there was only  silence. Silence, and faint static.    Then, distantly, metallically--    \"This is Scott.\"    The voice was neutral. Cold. He could not identify it. But the  earphone was minute.    \"Scott! Listen. I'm standing right above you. I'm on the surface,  looking down into the bunker entrance.\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Can you see me?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Through the view sight? You have the sight trained on me?\"    \"Yes.\"    Hendricks pondered. A circle of claws waited quietly around him,  gray-metal bodies on all sides of him. \"Is everything all right in the  bunker? Nothing unusual has happened?\"    \"Everything is all right.\"    \"Will you come up to the surface? I want to see you for a moment.\"  Hendricks took a deep breath. \"Come up here with me. I want to talk to  you.\"    \"Come down.\"    \"I'm giving you an order.\"    Silence.    \"Are you coming?\" Hendricks listened. There was no response. \"I order  you to come to the surface.\"    \"Come down.\"    Hendricks set his jaw. \"Let me talk to Leone.\"    There was a long pause. He listened to the static. Then a voice came,  hard, thin, metallic. The same as the other. \"This is Leone.\"    \"Hendricks. I'm on the surface. At the bunker entrance. I want one of  you to come up here.\"    \"Come down.\"    \"Why come down? I'm giving you an order!\"    Silence. Hendricks lowered the transmitter. He looked carefully around  him. The entrance was just ahead. Almost at his feet. He lowered the  antenna and fastened the transmitter to his belt. Carefully, he  gripped his gun with both hands. He moved forward, a step at a time.  If they could see him they knew he was starting toward the entrance.  He closed his eyes a moment.    Then he put his foot on the first step that led downward.    Two Davids came up at him, their faces identical and expressionless.  He blasted them into particles. More came rushing silently up, a whole  pack of them. All exactly the same.    Hendricks turned and raced back, away from the bunker, back toward the  rise.    At the top of the rise Tasso and Klaus were firing down. The small  claws were already streaking up toward them, shining metal spheres  going fast, racing frantically through the ash. But he had no time to  think about that. He knelt down, aiming at the bunker entrance, gun  against his cheek. The Davids were coming out in groups, clutching  their teddy bears, their thin knobby legs pumping as they ran up the  steps to the surface. Hendricks fired into the main body of them. They  burst apart, wheels and springs flying in all directions. He fired  again through the mist of particles.    A giant lumbering figure rose up in the bunker entrance, tall and  swaying. Hendricks paused, amazed. A man, a soldier. With one leg,  supporting himself with a crutch.    \"Major!\" Tasso's voice came. More firing. The huge figure moved  forward, Davids swarming around it. Hendricks broke out of his freeze.  The First Variety. The Wounded Soldier.    He aimed and fired. The soldier burst into bits, parts and relays  flying. Now many Davids were out on the flat ground, away from the  bunker. He fired again and again, moving slowly back, half-crouching  and aiming.    From the rise, Klaus fired down. The side of the rise was alive with  claws making their way up. Hendricks retreated toward the rise,  running and crouching. Tasso had left Klaus and was circling slowly to  the right, moving away from the rise.    A David slipped up toward him, its small white face expressionless,  brown hair hanging down in its eyes. It bent over suddenly, opening  its arms. Its teddy bear hurtled down and leaped across the ground,  bounding toward him. Hendricks fired. The bear and the David both  dissolved. He grinned, blinking. It was like a dream.    \"Up here!\" Tasso's voice. Hendricks made his way toward her. She was  over by some columns of concrete, walls of a ruined building. She was  firing past him, with the hand pistol Klaus had given her.    \"Thanks.\" He joined her, grasping for breath. She pulled him back,  behind the concrete, fumbling at her belt.    \"Close your eyes!\" She unfastened a globe from her waist. Rapidly, she  unscrewed the cap, locking it into place. \"Close your eyes and get  down.\"           *       *       *       *       *    She threw the bomb. It sailed in an arc, an expert, rolling and  bouncing to the entrance of the bunker. Two Wounded Soldiers stood  uncertainly by the brick pile. More Davids poured from behind them,  out onto the plain. One of the Wounded Soldiers moved toward the bomb,  stooping awkwardly down to pick it up.    The bomb went off. The concussion whirled Hendricks around, throwing  him on his face. A hot wind rolled over him. Dimly he saw Tasso  standing behind the columns, firing slowly and methodically at the  Davids coming out of the raging clouds of white fire.    Back along the rise Klaus struggled with a ring of claws circling  around him. He retreated, blasting at them and moving back, trying to  break through the ring.    Hendricks struggled to his feet. His head ached. He could hardly see.  Everything was licking at him, raging and whirling. His right arm  would not move.    Tasso pulled back toward him. \"Come on. Let's go.\"    \"Klaus--He's still up there.\"    \"Come on!\" Tasso dragged Hendricks back, away from the columns.  Hendricks shook his head, trying to clear it. Tasso led him rapidly  away, her eyes intense and bright, watching for claws that had escaped  the blast.    One David came out of the rolling clouds of flame. Tasso blasted it.  No more appeared.    \"But Klaus. What about him?\" Hendricks stopped, standing unsteadily.  \"He--\"    \"Come on!\"           *       *       *       *       *    They retreated, moving farther and farther away from the bunker. A few  small claws followed them for a little while and then gave up, turning  back and going off.    At last Tasso stopped. \"We can stop here and get our breaths.\"    Hendricks sat down on some heaps of debris. He wiped his neck,  gasping. \"We left Klaus back there.\"    Tasso said nothing. She opened her gun, sliding a fresh round of blast  cartridges into place.    Hendricks stared at her, dazed. \"You left him back there on purpose.\"    Tasso snapped the gun together. She studied the heaps of rubble around  them, her face expressionless. As if she were watching for something.    \"What is it?\" Hendricks demanded. \"What are you looking for? Is  something coming?\" He shook his head, trying to understand. What was  she doing? What was she waiting for? He could see nothing. Ash lay all  around them, ash and ruins. Occasional stark tree trunks, without  leaves or branches. \"What--\"    Tasso cut him off. \"Be still.\" Her eyes narrowed. Suddenly her gun  came up. Hendricks turned, following her gaze.           *       *       *       *       *    Back the way they had come a figure appeared. The figure walked  unsteadily toward them. Its clothes were torn. It limped as it made  its way along, going very slowly and carefully. Stopping now and then,  resting and getting its strength. Once it almost fell. It stood for a  moment, trying to steady itself. Then it came on.    Klaus.    Hendricks stood up. \"Klaus!\" He started toward him. \"How the hell did  you--\"    Tasso fired. Hendricks swung back. She fired again, the blast passing  him, a searing line of heat. The beam caught Klaus in the chest. He  exploded, gears and wheels flying. For a moment he continued to walk.  Then he swayed back and forth. He crashed to the ground, his arms  flung out. A few more wheels rolled away.    Silence.    Tasso turned to Hendricks. \"Now you understand "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3226"],[0,"Records of Journeys to Venice and the Low Countries (#7)"],[1," for the meal, and extra for drink, but my  wife and the maid can cook and eat up here.    I gave the Portuguese factor a statuette of a child: besides  that, I gave him an \"Adam and Eve,\" a \"Jerome in his Cell,\"  a \"Hercules,\" a \"Eustace,\" a \"Melancholy,\" and a \"Nemesis;\"  then of the half-sheets, three new \"Virgins,\" the  \"Veronica,\" the \"Anthony,\" \"The Nativity,\" and \"The  Crucifixion,\" also the best of the quarter-sheets, eight  pieces, and then the three books of the \"Life of the  Virgin,\" \"The Apocalypse,\" and the \"Great Passion,\" also the  \"Little Passion\" and the \"Passion\" on copper, all together,  5 florins' worth. The same quantity I gave to Signor  Rodrigo, the other Portuguese. Rodrigo has given my wife a  small green parrot.        VISIT TO BRUSSELS    On the Sunday after St. Bartholomew's, I traveled with Herr  Tomasin from Antwerp to Mechlin, where we lay for the night;  there I invited Master Conrad and a painter with him to  supper, and this Master Conrad is the good carver in Lady  Margaret's service. From Mechlin we traveled through the  small town of Vilvorde and came to Brussels on Monday at  midday; I gave the messenger 3 stivers; I dined with my  lords at Brussels; also once with Herr Bannisis, and I gave  him a \"Passion\" on copper. I gave the Margrave Hansen of  Brussels the letter of recommendation which my lord of  Bamberg wrote for me, and I made him a present of a  \"Passion,\" engraved on copper for a remembrance.    I have also dined once more with my lords of Nuremberg. I  saw in the town hall at Brussels, in the golden chamber,  four paintings which the great Master Rogier did; and behind  the King's palace in Brussels, the fountains, labyrinth,  zoological garden. Anything more beautiful and pleasing to  me, more like a paradise, I have never seen.    Erasmus is the name of the little man [Editor's note: not  Erasmus of Rotterdam, but a clerk of Bannisis] who wrote out  my supplication at Jacob Bannisis' house. At Brussels there  is a very splendid town hall, large and covered with  beautiful stonework, with a noble open tower. I have made a  portrait of Master Conrad of Brussels by candlelight; he is  my host. At the same time I drew Doctor Lamparter's son in  charcoal, and also the hostess.    Also I have seen the things which they have brought to the  King out of the new land of gold: a sun all of gold, a whole  fathom broad, and a moon, too, of silver, of the same size,  also two rooms full of armour, and the people there with all  manner of wondrous weapons, harness, darts, wonderful  shields, extraordinary clothing, beds, and all kinds of  wonderful things for human use, much finer to look at than  prodigies. These things are all so precious that they are  valued at 100,000 gulden, and all the days of my life I have  seen nothing that reaches my heart so much as these, for  among them I have seen wonderfully artistic things and have  admired the subtle ingenuity of men in foreign lands;  indeed, I don't know how to express what I there found.    I also saw many other beautiful things at Brussels, and  especially a great fish bone there, as vast as if it had  been built up of square stones; it was a fathom long, very  thick, weighs up to 1 cwt. (15 centner), and it has the form  as is here drawn; it stood behind on the fish's head.    I have also been in the Lord of Nassau's house, which is so  magnificently built and so beautifully decorated. I have  again dined twice with my lords. Lady Margaret sent after me  to Brussels and promised that she would speak in my behalf  to King Charles, and has shown herself quite exceptionally  kind to me: I sent her my engraved \"Passion\" and such  another to her treasurer, Jan Marnix by name, and I made his  portrait in charcoal. I paid 2 stivers for a buffalo ring,  and also 2 stivers for opening St. Luke's picture.  When I  was in Herr von Nassau's house I saw in the chapel the fine  painting that Master Hugo has made, and I also saw two large  beautiful halls, and all the treasures in various parts of  the house, and the large bed in which fifty men can lie. And  I also saw the great stone which the storm cast down in the  field close to Herr von Nassau. This house lies high, and  there is a most beautiful view at which one cannot but  wonder. And I think that in all German lands there is not  the like of it.    Master Bernhard, the painter, invited me to dinner, and had  prepared a meal so costly that I do not think 10 florins  will pay for it. Three friends invited themselves to it to  give me good company, to wit, Lady Margaret's treasurer,  whose portrait I made, and the King's steward, de Metenye,  and the town treasurer, Van Busleyden; I gave him a  \"Passion\" engraved on copper, and he gave me in return a  black Spanish bag worth 3 florins. And I also gave a  \"Passion\" engraved on copper to Erasmus of Rotterdam;  likewise one to Erasmus, the secretary of Bannisis. The man  at Antwerp who gave me the \"Child's Head\" is called Lorenz  Sterk. I took the portrait in charcoal of Master Bernhard,  Lady Margaret's painter. I have taken Erasmus of Rotterdam's  portrait once more. I gave Lorenz Sterk a sitting \"St.  Jerome\" and the \"Melancholy,\" and I made a portrait of my  hostess's godmother. Six people whose portraits I painted at  Brussels gave me nothing. I paid 3 stivers for two buffalo  horns and 1 stiver for two Eulenspiegels.    So then on the Sunday after St. Giles', I traveled with Herr  Tomasin to Mechlin and took leave of Herr Hans Ebner, and he  would take nothing for my expenses while I was with him  seven days; I paid 1 stiver on behalf of Hans Geuder; I gave  1 stiver as a tip to the host's servant; and at Mechlin I  took supper with the Lady Nieuwekerke; and early on Monday I  traveled from Mechlin to Antwerp.    AT ANTWERP (September 3 - October 4, 1520)    I breakfasted with the Portuguese factor, who gave me three  porcelain dishes, and Rodrigo gave me some Calicut feathers.  I spent 1 florin and paid my messenger 2 stivers. I bought  Susanna a mantle for 2 florins, 10 stivers. My wife paid 4  florins Rhenish for a washtub, a bellows, a basin, a pair of  slippers, wood for cooking, stockings, a cage for the  parrot, 2 jugs, and for tips; she spent, moreover, for  eating, drinking, and various necessaries, 21 stivers.    Now on Monday after St. Giles' I am back again at Jobst  Planckfelter's, and have dined with him as many times as are  drawn here-IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII.  I gave Nicolas, Tomasin's  man, 1 stiver; I paid 5 stivers for the little frame, and 1  stiver more. My host gave me an Indian cocoanut and an old  Turkish whip; then I have dined IIIIIIIIIIIII more with  Tomasin. The two lords of Rogendorf have invited me; I have  dined once with them and made a large drawing of their coat  of arms on wood, for engraving. I gave away 1 stiver; my  wife changed a florin for 24 stivers; I gave 2 stivers as a  tip. I have dined once in Focker's house with the young  Jacob Rehlinger, and I have also dined once more with him.  My wife has changed a florin for 24 stivers for expenses. I  gave to Wilhelm Hauenhut, the servant of my lord Duke  Frederick, the Platzgraf, an engraved \"Jerome,\" and the two  new half-sheets, the \"Mary\" and the \"Anthony.\" I gave Herr  Jacob Bannisis a good painting of a \"Veronica\" face, a  \"Eustace,\" a \"Melancholy,\" and a sitting \"Jerome,\" a \"St.  Anthony,\" the two new \"Marys,\" and the new \"Peasants.\" And I  have given his secretary, Erasmus, who wrote my  supplication, a sitting \"Jerome,\" a \"Melancholy,\" an  \"Anthony,\" the two new \"Marys,\" and the \"Peasants,\" and I  have given him also two small \"Marys,\" and all together what  I have given is worth 7 florins, and I have given Master  Marc, the goldsmith, a \"Passion\" on copper, and he gave me 3  florins in payment; besides this I have received 3 florins,  20 stivers, for prints. To the glazier Honigen, I have given  four little engravings. I have dined with Herr Bannisis III.  I paid 4 stivers for carbon and black chalk; I have given 1  florin, 8 stivers for wood, and spent 3 stivers more. I have  dined with the lords of Nuremberg IIIIIIIIII. Master  Dietrich, the glass painter, sent me the red colour which is  found in the new bricks at Antwerp. I made charcoal portrait  of Jacob von Lubeck; he gave my wife a Philip's florin. I  have again changed a Philip's florin for expenses.    I presented to Lady Margaret a seated \"Jerome\" engraved on  copper. I sold a woodcut \"Passion\" for 12 stivers, besides  an \"Adam and Eve\" for 4 stivers. Felix, the captain and lute-  player, bought a whole set of copper-engravings and a  woodcut \"Passion\" and an engraved \"Passion,\" two half-sheets  and two quarter-sheets, for 8 gold florins; so I gave him  another set of engravings. I have taken Herr Bannisis's  portrait in charcoal. Rodrigo gave me another parrot, and I  gave his boy 2 stivers for a tip. I gave Johann von den  Winckel, the trumpeter, a small woodcut \"Passion,\" \"St.  Jerome in his Cell,\" and a \"Melancholy.\" I paid 6 stivers  for a pair of gloves. I paid 3 stivers for a bamboo rod, and  George Schlaudersbath gave me another which cost 6 stivers.    I have dined once with Wolff Haller, who is employed by the  Fuggers, when he had invited my lords of Nuremberg. I have  received for works of art, 2 Philip's florins, and 6  stivers. I have again dined once with my wife; I gave 1  stiver to Hans Denes' boy for a tip. I have taken 100  stivers for works of art.    I made a charcoal portrait of Master Jacob, Lord Rogendorf's  painter, and I have drawn for Lord Rogendorf his arms on  wood, for which he gave me seven ells of velvet.    I dined once more with the Portuguese; I took the portrait  of Master John Prost of Bruges, and he gave me 1 florin; it  was done in charcoal; 23 stivers for a fur coat of rabbit-  skin. I sent Hans Schwarz 2 golden florins for my picture in  a letter sent through the Antwerp Fuggers to Augsburg, I  gave 31 stivers for a red woolen"]]]
