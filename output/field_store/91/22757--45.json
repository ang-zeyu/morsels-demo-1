Opium is the brown, gummy exudate of the incised, unripe seedpod of the  opium poppy.  Opium poppy (Papaver somniferum) is the source for the natural and  semisynthetic narcotics.  Poppy straw is the entire cut and dried opium poppy-plant material,  other than the seeds. Opium is extracted from poppy straw in commercial  operations that produce the drug for medical use.  Qat (kat, khat) is a stimulant from the buds or leaves of Catha edulis  that is chewed or drunk as tea.  Quaaludes is the North American slang term for methaqualone, a  pharmaceutical depressant.

Imports  This entry provides the total US dollar amount of merchandise imports  on a c.i.f. (cost, insurance, and freight) or f.o.b. (free on board)  basis. These figures are calculated on an exchange rate basis, i.e.,  not in purchasing power parity (PPP) terms.    Imports - commodities  This entry provides a rank ordering of imported products starting with  the most important; it sometimes includes the percent of total dollar  value.    Imports - partners  This entry provides a rank ordering of trading partners starting with  the most important; it sometimes includes the percent of total dollar  value.    Independence  For most countries, this entry gives the date that sovereignty was  achieved and from which nation, empire, or trusteeship. For the other  countries, the date given may not represent \"independence\" in the  strict sense, but rather some significant nationhood event such as the  traditional founding date or the date of unification, federation,  confederation, establishment, fundamental change in the form of  government, or state succession. Dependent areas include the notation  \"none\" followed by the nature of their dependency status. Also see the  Terminology note.    Industrial production growth rate  This entry gives the annual percentage increase in industrial  production (includes manufacturing, mining, and construction).    Industries  This entry provides a rank ordering of industries starting with the  largest by value of annual output.    Infant mortality rate  This entry gives the number of deaths of infants under one year old in  a given year per 1,000 live births in the same year; included is the  total death rate, and deaths by sex, male and female. This rate is  often used as an indicator of the level of health in a country.    Inflation rate (consumer prices)  This entry furnishes the annual percent change in consumer prices  compared with the previous year's consumer prices.    International disputes  see Disputes - international    International organization participation  This entry lists in alphabetical order by abbreviation those  international organizations in which the subject country is a member or  participates in some other way.    International organizations  This information is presented in Appendix B: International  Organizations and Groups which includes the name, abbreviation, date  established, aim, and members by category.    Internet country code  This entry includes the two-letter codes maintained by the  International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in the ISO 3166  Alpha-2 list and used by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA)  to establish country-coded top-level domains (ccTLDs).    Internet hosts  This entry lists the number of Internet hosts available within a  country. An Internet host is a computer connected directly to the  Internet; normally an Internet Service Provider's (ISP) computer is a  host. Internet users may use either a hard-wired terminal, at an  institution with a mainframe computer connected directly to the  Internet, or may connect remotely by way of a modem via telephone line,  cable, or satellite to the Internet Service Provider's host computer.  The number of hosts is one indicator of the extent of Internet  connectivity.    Internet users  This entry gives the number of users within a country that access the  Internet. Statistics vary from country to country and may include users  who access the Internet at least several times a week to those who  access it only once within a period of several months.    Introduction  This category includes one entry, Background.    Investment (gross fixed)  This entry records total business spending on fixed assets, such as  factories, machinery, equipment, dwellings, and inventories of raw  materials, which provide the basis for future production. It is  measured gross of the depreciation of the assets, i.e., it includes  invesment that merely replaces worn-out or scrapped capital.    Irrigated land  This entry gives the number of square kilometers of land area that is  artificially supplied with water.    Judicial branch  This entry contains the name(s) of the highest court(s) and a brief  description of the selection process for members.    Labor force  This entry contains the total labor force figure.    Labor force - by occupation  This entry lists the percentage distribution of the labor force by  occupation. The distribution will total less than 100 percent if the  data are incomplete.    Land boundaries  This entry contains the total length of all land boundaries and the  individual lengths for each of the contiguous border countries.    Land use  This entry contains the percentage shares of total land area for three  different types of land use: arable land - land cultivated for crops  like wheat, maize, and rice that are replanted after each harvest;  permanent crops - land cultivated for crops like citrus, coffee, and  rubber that are not replanted after each harvest; includes land under  flowering shrubs, fruit trees, nut trees, and vines, but excludes land  under trees grown for wood or timber; other - any land not arable or  under permanent crops; includes permanent meadows and pastures, forests  and woodlands, built-on areas, roads, barren land, etc.    Languages  This entry provides a rank ordering of languages starting with the  largest and sometimes includes the percent of total population speaking  that language.    Legal system  This entry contains a brief description of the legal system's  historical roots, role in government, and acceptance of International  Court of Justice (ICJ) jurisdiction.    Legislative branch  This entry contains information on the structure (unicameral,  bicameral, tricameral), formal name, number of seats, and term of  office. Elections includes the nature of election process or accession  to power, date of the last election, and date of the next election.  Election results includes the percent of vote and/or number of seats  held by each party in the last election.    Life expectancy at birth  This entry contains the average number of years to be lived by a group  of people born in the same year, if mortality at each age remains  constant in the future. The entry includes total population as well as  the male and female components. Life expectancy at birth is also a  measure of overall quality of life in a country and summarizes the  mortality at all ages. It can also be thought of as indicating the  potential return on investment in human capital and is necessary for  the calculation of various actuarial measures.    Literacy  This entry includes a definition of literacy and Census Bureau  percentages for the total population, males, and females. There are no  universal definitions and standards of literacy. Unless otherwise  specified, all rates are based on the most common definition - the  ability to read and write at a specified age. Detailing the standards  that individual countries use to assess the ability to read and write  is beyond the scope of the Factbook. Information on literacy, while not  a perfect measure of educational results, is probably the most easily  available and valid for international comparisons. Low levels of  literacy, and education in general, can impede the economic development  of a country in the current rapidly changing, technology-driven world.    Location  This entry identifies the country's regional location, neighboring  countries, and adjacent bodies of water.    Major infectious diseases  This entry lists major infectious diseases likely to be encountered in  countries where the risk of such diseases is assessed to be very high  as compared to the United States. These infectious diseases represent  risks to US government personnel traveling to the specified country for  a period of less than three years. The degree of risk is assessed by  considering the foreign nature of these infectious diseases, their  severity, and the probability of being affected by the diseases  present. The diseases listed do not necessarily represent the total  disease burden experienced by the local population.  The risk to an individual traveler varies considerably by the specific  location, visit duration, type of activities, type of accommodations,  time of year, and other factors. Consultation with a travel medicine  physician is needed to evaluate individual risk and recommend  appropriate preventive measures such as vaccines.  Diseases are organized into the following six exposure categories shown  in italics and listed in typical descending order of risk. Note - The  sequence of exposure categories listed in individual country entries  may vary according to local conditions.  food or waterborne diseases acquired through eating or drinking on the  local economy:  Hepatitis A - viral disease that"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2757"],[0,"Vaninka (#7)"],[1," lastly, you must not ask me,  whatever happens, to help you in any other way than with my good  wishes.\"    \"Whatever you please. I will do everything you wish me to do. Do you not  grant me a thousand times more than I dared hope, and if your father  refuses me, do I not know myself that you are sharing my grief?\" cried  Foedor.    \"Yes; but that will not happen, I hope,\" said Vaninka, holding out her  hand to the young officer, who kissed it passionately.    \"Now be hopeful and take courage;\" and Vaninka retired, leaving the  young man a hundred times more agitated and moved than she was herself,  woman though she was.    The same day Foedor asked for an interview with the general. The general  received his aide-de-camp as usual with a genial and smiling  countenance, but with the first words Foedor uttered his face darkened.  However, when he heard the young man's description of the love, so true,  constant, and passionate, that he felt for Vaninka, and when he heard  that this passion had been the motive power of those glorious deeds he  had praised so often, he held out his hand to Foedor, almost as moved as  the young soldier.    And then the general told him, that while he had been away, and ignorant  of his love for Vaninka, in whom he had observed no trace of its being  reciprocated, he had, at the emperor's desire, promised her hand to the  son of a privy councillor. The only stipulation that the general had  made was, that he should not be separated from his daughter until she  had attained the age of eighteen. Vaninka had only five months more to  spend under her father's roof. Nothing more could be said: in Russia the  emperor's wish is an order, and from the moment that it is expressed, no  subject would oppose it, even in thought. However, the refusal had  imprinted such despair on the young man's face, that the general,  touched by his silent and resigned sorrow, held out his arms to him.  Foedor flung himself into them with loud sobs.    Then the general questioned him about his daughter, and Foedor answered,  as he had promised, that Vaninka was ignorant of everything, and that  the proposal came from him alone, without her knowledge. This assurance  calmed the general: he had feared that he was making two people  wretched.    At dinner-time Vaninka came downstairs and found her father alone.  Foedor had not enough courage to be present at the meal and to meet her  again, just when he had lost all hope: he had taken a sleigh, and driven  out to the outskirts of the city.    During the whole time dinner lasted Vaninka and the general hardly  exchanged a word, but although this silence was so expressive, Vaninka  controlled her face with her usual power, and the general alone appeared  sad and dejected.    That evening, just when Vaninka was going downstairs, tea was brought to  her room, with the message that the general was fatigued and had  retired. Vaninka asked some questions about the nature of his  indisposition, and finding that it was not serious, she told the servant  who had brought her the message to ask her father to send for her if he  wanted anything. The general sent to say that he thanked her, but he  only required quiet and rest. Vaninka announced that she would retire  also, and the servant withdrew.    Hardly had he left the room when Vaninka ordered Annouschka, her  foster-sister, who acted as her maid, to be on the watch for Foedor's  return, and to let her know as soon as he came in.    At eleven o'clock the gate of the mansion opened: Foedor got out of his  sleigh, and immediately went up to his room. He threw himself upon a  sofa, overwhelmed by his thoughts. About midnight he heard someone  tapping at the door: much astonished, he got up and opened it. It was  Annouschka, who came with a message from her mistress, that Vaninka  wished to see him immediately. Although he was astonished at this  message, which he was far from expecting, Foedor obeyed.    He found Vaninka seated, dressed in a white robe, and as she was paler  than usual he stopped at the door, for it seemed to him that he was  gazing at a marble statue.    \"Come in,\" said Vaninka calmly.    Foedor approached, drawn by her voice like steel to a magnet. Annouschka  shut the door behind him.    \"Well, and what did my father say?\" said Vaninka.    Foedor told her all that had happened. The young girl listened to his  story with an unmoved countenance, but her lips, the only part of her  face which seemed to have any colour, became as white as the  dressing-gown she was wearing. Foedor, on the contrary, was consumed by  a fever, and appeared nearly out of his senses.    \"Now, what do you intend to do?\" said Vaninka in the same cold tone in  which she had asked the other questions.    \"You ask me what I intend to do, Vaninka? What do you wish me to do?  What can I do, but flee from St. Petersburg, and seek death in the first  corner of Russia where war may break out, in order not to repay my  patron's kindness by some infamous baseness?\"    \"You are a fool,\" said Vaninka, with a mixed smile of triumph and  contempt; for from that moment she felt her superiority over Foedor, and  saw that she would rule him like a queen for the rest of her life.    \"Then order me--am I not your slave?\" cried the young soldier.    \"You must stay here,\" said Vaninka.    \"Stay here?\"    \"Yes; only women and children will thus confess themselves beaten at the  first blow: a man, if he be worthy of the name, fights.\"    \"Fight!--against whom?--against your father? Never!\"    \"Who suggested that you should contend against my father? It is against  events that you must strive; for the generality of men do not govern  events, but are carried away by them. Appear to my father as though you  were fighting against your love, and he will think that you have  mastered yourself. As I am supposed to be ignorant of your proposal, I  shall not be suspected. I will demand two years' more freedom, and I  shall obtain them. Who knows what may happen in the course of two years?  The emperor may die, my betrothed may die, my father--may God protect  him!--my father himself may die--!\"    \"But if they force you to marry?\"    \"Force me!\" interrupted Vaninka, and a deep flush rose to her cheek and  immediately disappeared again. \"And who will force me to do anything?  Father? He loves me too well. The emperor? He has enough worries in his  own family, without introducing them into another's. Besides, there is  always a last resource when every other expedient fails: the Neva only  flows a few paces from here, and its waters are deep.\"    Foedor uttered a cry, for in the young girl's knit brows and tightly  compressed lips there was so much resolution that he understood that  they might break this child but that they would not bend her. But  Foedor's heart was too much in harmony with the plan Vaninka had  proposed; his objections once removed, he did not seek fresh ones.  Besides, had he had the courage to do so; Vaninka's promise to make up  in secret to him for the dissimulation she was obliged to practise in  public would have conquered his last scruples.    Vaninka, whose determined character had been accentuated by her  education, had an unbounded influence over all who came in contact with  her; even the general, without knowing why, obeyed her. Foedor submitted  like a child to everything she wished, and the young girl's love was  increased by the wishes she opposed and by a feeling of gratified pride.    It was some days after this nocturnal decision that the knouting had  taken place at which our readers have assisted. It was for some slight  fault, and Gregory had been the victim; Vaninka having complained to her  father about him. Foedor, who as aide-de-camp had been obliged to  preside over Gregory's punishment, had paid no more attention to the  threats the serf had uttered on retiring.    Ivan, the coachman, who after having been executioner had become  surgeon, had applied compresses of salt and water to heal up the scarred  shoulders of his victim. Gregory had remained three days in the  infirmary, and during this time he had turned over in his mind every  possible means of vengeance. Then at the end of three days, being  healed, he had returned to his duty, and soon everyone except he had  forgotten the punishment. If Gregory had been a real Russian, he would  soon have forgotten it all; for this punishment is too familiar to the  rough Muscovite for him to remember it long and with rancour. Gregory,  as we have said, had Greek blood in his veins; he dissembled and  remembered. Although Gregory was a serf, his duties had little by little  brought him into greater familiarity with the general than any of the  other servants. Besides, in every country in the world barbers have  great licence with those they shave; this is perhaps due to the fact  that a man is instinctively more gracious to another who for ten minutes  every day holds his life in his hands. Gregory rejoiced in the immunity  of his profession, and it nearly always happened that the barber's daily  operation on the general's chin passed in conversation, of which he bore  the chief part.    One day the general had to attend a review: he sent for Gregory before  daybreak, and as the barber was passing the razor as gently as possible  over his master's cheek, the conversation fell, or more likely was led,  on Foedor. The barber praised him highly, and this naturally caused his  master to ask him, remembering the correction the young aide-decamp had  superintended, if he could not find some fault in this model of  perfection that might counterbalance so many good qualities. Gregory  replied that with the exception of pride he thought Foedor  irreproachable.    \"Pride?\" asked the astonished general. \"That is a failing from which I  should have thought him most free.\"    \"Perhaps I should have said ambition,\" replied Gregory.    \"Ambition!\" said the general. \"It does not seem"]]]
