For thy Lord is the most Beneficent,    Who hath taught the use of the pen;    Hath taught Man that which he knoweth not.    Nay, verily,4 Man is insolent,    Because he seeth himself possessed of riches.    Verily, to thy Lord is the return of all.    What thinkest thou of him that holdeth back    A servant5 of God when he prayeth?    What thinkest thou?6 Hath he followed the true Guidance, or enjoined Piety?    What thinkest thou? Hath he treated the truth as a lie and turned his back?    What! doth he not know how that God seeth?    Nay, verily, if he desist not, We shall seize him by the forelock,    The lying sinful forelock!    Then let him summon his associates;7    We too will summon the guards of Hell:    Nay! obey him not; but adore, and draw nigh to God.8      _______________________    1 The word Sura occurs nine times in the Koran, viz. Sur. ix. 65, 87, 125,  128; xxiv. 1; xlvii. 22 (twice); ii. 21; x. 39; but it is not easy to  determine whether it means a whole chapter, or part only of a chapter, or is  used in the sense of \"revelation.\" See Weil's Mohammed der Prophet, pp. 361-  363. It is understood by the Muhammadan commentators to have a primary  reference to the succession of subjects or parts, like the rows of bricks in  a wall. The titles of the Suras are generally taken from some word occurring  in each, which is printed in large type throughout, where practicable.    2 This formulaBismillahi 'rrahmani 'rrahimis of Jewish origin. It was in  the first instance taught to the Koreisch by Omayah of Taief, the poet, who  was a contemporary with, but somewhat older than, Muhammad; and who, during  his mercantile journeys into Arabia Petra and Syria, had made himself  acquainted with the sacred books and doctrines of Jews and Christians. (Kitab  al-Aghâni, 16. Delhi.) Muhammad adopted and constantly used it, and it is  prefixed to each Sura except the ninth. The former of the two epithets  implies that the mercy of God is exercised as occasions arise, towards all  his creatures; the latter that the quality of mercy is inherent in God and  permanent, so that there is only a shade of difference between the two words.  Maracci well renders, In Nomine Dei Miseratoris, Misericordis. The rendering  I have adopted is that of Mr. Lane in his extracts from the Koran. See also  Freytag's Lex. ii. p. 133. Perhaps, In the name of Allah, the God of Mercy,  the Merciful, would more fully express the original Arabic. The first five  verses of this Sura are, in the opinion of nearly all commentators, ancient  and modern, the earliest revelations made to Muhammad, in the 40th year of  his life, and the starting point of El-Islam. (See the authorities quoted in  detail in Nöldeke's Geschichte des Qorâns, p. 62, n.)    3 The usual rendering is read. But the word qaraa, which is the root of the  word Koran, analogous to the Rabbinic mikra, rather means to address, recite;  and with regard to its etymology and use in the kindred dialects to call, cry  aloud, proclaim. Compare Isai. lviii. 1; 1 Kings xviii. 37; and Gesen.  Thesaur. on the Hebrew root. I understand this passage to mean, \"Preach to  thy fellow men what thou believest to be true of thy Lord who has created man  from the meanest materials, and can in like manner prosper the truth which  thou proclaimest. He has taught man the art of writing (recently introduced  at Mecca) and in this thou wilt find a powerful help for propagating the  knowledge of the divine Unity.\" The speaker in this, as in all the Suras, is  Gabriel, of whom Muhammad had, as he believed, a vision on the mountain Hirâ,  near Mecca. See note 1 on the next page. The details of the vision are quite  unhistorical.    4 This, and the following verses, may have been added at a later period,  though previous to the Flight, and with special reference, if we are to  believe the commentators Beidhawi, etc., to the opposition which Muhammad  experienced at the hands of his opponent, Abu Jahl, who had threatened to set  his foot on the Prophet's neck when prostrate in prayer. But the whole  passage admits of application to mankind in general.    5 That is Muhammad. Nöldeke, however, proposes to render \"a slave.\" And it is  certain that the doctrines of Islam were in the first instance embraced by  slaves, many of whom had been carried away from Christian homes, or born of  Christian parents at Mecca. \"Men of this description,\" says Dr. Sprenger  (Life of Mohammad. Allahabad. p. 159), \"no doubt prepared the way for the  Islam by inculcating purer notions respecting God upon their masters and  their brethren. These men saw in Mohammad their liberator; and being  superstitious enough to consider his fits as the consequence of an  inspiration, they were among the first who acknowledged him as a prophet.  Many of them suffered torture for their faith in him, and two of them died as  martyrs. The excitement among the slaves when Mohammad first assumed his  office was so great, that Abd Allah bin Jod'an, who had one hundred of these  sufferers, found it necessary to remove them from Makkah, lest they should  all turn converts.\" See Sura xvi. 105, 111; ii. 220.    6 Lit. hast thou seen if he be upon the guidance.    7 The principal men of the Koreisch who adhered to Abu Jahl.    8 During a period variously estimated from six months to three years from the  revelation of this Sura, or of its earliest verses, the prophetic inspiration  and the revelation of fresh Suras is said to have been suspended. This  interval is called the Fatrah or intermission; and the Meccan Suras delivered  at its close show that at or during this period Muhammad had gained an  increasing and more intimate acquaintance with the Jewish and Christian  Scriptures. \"The accounts, however,\" says Mr. Muir (vol. ii. 86) \"are  throughout confused, if not contradictory; and we can only gather with  certainty that there was a time during which his mind hung in suspense, and  doubted the divine mission.\" The idea of any supernatural influence is of  course to be entirely excluded; although there is no doubt that Muhammad  himself had a full belief in the personality and influence of Satans and  Djinn. Profound meditation, the struggles of an earnest mind anxious to  attain to truth, the morbid excitability of an epileptic subject, visions  seen in epileptic swoons, disgust at Meccan idolatry, and a desire to teach  his countrymen the divine Unity will sufficiently account for the period of  indecision termed the Fatrah, and for the determination which led Muhammad,  in all sincerity, but still self-deceived, to take upon himself the office  and work of a Messenger from God. We may perhaps infer from such passages as  Sura ii. 123, what had ever been the leading idea in Muhammad's mind.

Thy raimentpurify it!    The abominationflee it!    And bestow not favours that thou mayest receive again with increase;    And for thy Lord wait thou patiently.    For when there shall be a trump on the trumpet,2    That shall be a distressful day,    A day, to the Infidels, devoid of ease.    Leave me alone to deal with him3 whom I have created,    And on whom I have bestowed vast riches,    And sons dwelling before him,    And for whom I have smoothed all things smoothly down;    Yet desireth he that I should add more!    But no!  because to our signs he is a foe    I will lay grievous woes upon him.    For he plotted and he planned!    May he be cursed!  How he planned!    Again, may he be cursed!  How he planned!    Then looked he around him,    Then frowned and scowled,    Then turned his back and swelled with disdain,    And said, This is merely magic that will be wrought;    It is merely the word of a mortal.    We will surely cast him into Hell-fire.    And who shall teach thee what Hell-fire is?    It leaveth nought, it spareth nought,    Blackening the skin.    Over it are nineteen angels.    None but angels have we made guardians of the fire:4 nor have we made this to  be their number but to perplex the unbelievers, and that they who possess the  Scriptures may be certain of the truth of the Koran, and that they who  believe may increase their faith;    And that they to whom the Scriptures have been given, and the believers, may  not doubt;    And that the infirm of heart and the unbelievers may say, What meaneth God by  this parable?    Thus God misleadeth whom He will, and whom He will doth He guide aright: and  none knoweth the armies of thy Lord but Himself: and this is no other than a  warning to mankind.    Nay, by the Moon!    By the Night when it retreateth!    By the Morn when it brighteneth!

Annotated List of Species      #Juniperus virginiana.#--Red cedar, the only native gymnosperm of  northeastern Kansas, occurs in nearly all woodlands of the region,  although individual trees are widely scattered. It has increased  remarkably in the past few years. No mature cedar trees grow anywhere  on the Reservation, but young trees, probably several dozen in all,  are widely scattered in a variety of situations on the area. Probably  in every instance the seeds have reached the area in droppings of  birds. Approximately 15 miles south and a little east of the  Reservation is a stand of cedars some of which are 100 to 300 years  old. Near the southwest corner of the section, at the site of a former  farm house there is a small grove of these trees, probably planted.  These may have been the source for some of the young trees on the  Reservation.    On several occasions cardinals (_Richmondena cardinalis_) were  observed to have nested in the young cedars, whose thick foliage  provided well sheltered nesting sites. This shelter was utilized  especially in early nestings when foliage had only begun to appear on  other trees and shrubs. However, two such nests in cedars, that were  checked repeatedly, were eventually destroyed by predators.      #Salix nigra.#--Black willow is localized in the vicinity of the one  small pond on the Reservation. The pond was made in 1936; at the  upper end of a small valley a dirt bank 100 yards long was built  across a ravine through which an intermittent creek drained. Hilltop  fields draining into this ravine were then under cultivation. In the  next few years heavy erosion occurred in the upland fields, and the  soil carried downstream was deposited in the pond. Most of the pond  was filled up with a silt flat about an acre in area. On the higher  part of this silt flat a dense thicket of saplings of elm, honey  locust and osage orange sprang up. On the lower, wetter part of the  silt bar a willow grove grew up, dominated by _S. nigra_, with _S.  eriocephala_, _S. interior_ and _S. amygdaloides_ in smaller numbers.  By 1955 some of these trees had attained a trunk diameter of eight  inches and a height of thirty feet. Elsewhere on the Reservation,  willow is represented only by a few scattered trees and bushes along  the two intermittent creeks. The silty soil preferred by the willow is  scarce as both streams are actively eroding their channels.    The moist, silty soil beneath the willow grove is covered with a dense  mat of low vegetation including giant ragweed, carpenter's square,  dayflower, and rice cutgrass. Short-tailed shrews, house mice (_Mus  musculus_), harvest mice and cotton rats thrive in this habitat.  Red-winged blackbirds (_Agelaius phoeniceus_), yellow-billed cuckoos  (_Coccyzus americanus_), red-eyed vireos (_Vireo olivaceus_), catbirds  (_Dumetella carolinensis_) and Kentucky warblers (_Oporornis  formosus_) use it for nesting. The high humidity and dense vegetation  in this grove render it favorable habitat for recently metamorphosed  frogs and toads, especially the tree frog, which is sometimes  extremely abundant there in summer.      #Populus deltoides.#--Cottonwood is one of the less common trees on  the area, but it attains a larger size than any of the other kinds.  The larger of the two creeks on the Reservation is lined with mature  cottonwoods along the lower part of its course. Along the smaller  creek large cottonwoods are also present but they are more widely  spaced. A few cottonwoods are present at well scattered points on  slopes and hilltops, usually in forest edge situations or in woodland  where other trees are sparse. By far the largest tree on the  Reservation is a cottonwood of 15-foot circumference (Plate 1),  growing on a hilltop near the south boundary of the Reservation, at  the edge of woodland adjacent to a cultivated field.    The heavy rainfall of 1951 resulted in the establishment of hundreds  of cottonwood seedlings, mostly in places remote from the mature  trees. So far as observed, all these were in recent silt deposits.  Many of them have survived the drought of 1952-1954.    Because of their great height, towering above the level of the  surrounding tree-tops, cottonwoods are preferred look-out perches  of certain of the larger birds, notably red-tailed hawks (_Buteo  jamaicensis_), barred owls (_Strix varia_), and crows (_Corvus  brachyrhynchos_). Flocks of robins (_Turdus migratorius_) and of rusty  blackbirds (_Euphagus carolinus_) preparing to roost have been noted  habitually to gather in the tops of tall cottonwoods. In spring,  large wandering flocks of goldfinches (_Spinus tristis_) have been  seen feeding on the leaf buds of cottonwoods. Baltimore orioles  (_Icterus galbula_) and yellow-billed cuckoos often forage in  cottonwoods. Red-bellied woodpeckers (_Centurus carolinus_) spend a  disproportionately large amount of their time in cottonwoods. These  woodpeckers have been observed nesting in the hollow branches on several  occasions. Downy woodpeckers (_Dendrocopos pubescens_) also have been  noticed foraging in cottonwoods on many occasions. Certain large  isolated cottonwoods along creeks were favorite stopping places of blue  jays (_Cyanocitta cristata_) which, on trips from one wooded hillside to  another, usually perched briefly in the tops of these tall trees.  Calling and looking about, the jays seemed to maintain contact with  distant mates or members of the flocks by using these high perches.  Often after a brief pause in the top of the cottonwood they flew off in  a new direction.    Both woodrats and opossums have been known to utilize hollow  cottonwoods as dens. Fox squirrels have been seen climbing in  cottonwoods occasionally.      #Juglans nigra.#--Black walnut is one of the more prominent hardwoods.  Under original conditions, evidently many of the larger trees were of  this species. Being the most valuable timber species of the area,  walnut has been subjected to heavy cutting over the past 85 years.  Most of the walnut trees still present are small or medium-sized, but  the species is still abundant over much of the area. Along certain  hilltop edges there are groves of walnuts, growing in nearly pure  stands, with an occasional elm, ash, coffee-tree or honey locust.  Elsewhere walnut trees are more scattered, but are distributed  throughout the woodland. Although the walnut trees growing in woods  are of various sizes from those of mature size down to saplings,  seedlings are to be found mainly in fields near the woodland edge. In  these situations it is one of the more prominent of the woody species  invading open lands. The seeds evidently are transported mainly by  rodents, especially fox squirrels.    In autumn every walnut tree that is bearing nuts becomes a focal  point of activity for squirrels. Over a period of weeks the squirrels  concentrate their attention on the walnut crop, continuing until  virtually every nut has been harvested. Walnut seems to be the one  most important food source, for both the fox squirrel and the gray  squirrel. Most of the nuts are stored for future use. Many buried  separately and never retrieved by the squirrels, grow into new trees.    White-footed mice often store the nuts in their nests, in burrows,  beneath rocks or in crevices. In summer, groves and isolated trees of  walnuts are favorite haunts of the yellow-billed cuckoo, which finds  concealment in the thick foliage, and probably feeds upon the tent  caterpillars that commonly infest these trees.      #Carya ovata.#--Shagbark hickory is one of the more important  hardwoods of the area. The trees are relatively small compared with  the larger oaks, elms, ashes and hackberry. However, on several parts  of the area this hickory is dominant. It grows mainly on north slopes  and hilltops. The trees most frequently associated with it are black  oak, American elm and chestnut oak. Scattered through the woodlands  are occasional mature hickories of DBH 18 inches or more. However,  many of the trees are six inches or less DBH and a large proportion of  these have originated as stump sprouts from trees cut in the early  thirties or before.    Shagbark is especially tolerant of shading. Numerous young trees and  seedlings noted all were growing in dense woods of larger hickories,  oaks, or mature elms. None has been found in open fields or even in  edge situations. This hickory is resistant to drought; relatively few  died during the drought of 1952-1954, and these were mostly small  trees in crowded stands.    In parts of the woodland dominated by shagbark hickory the trees are  mostly 5 to 6 inches or even smaller in trunk diameter and 20 to 30  feet high, sometimes growing in nearly pure stands, and with a leaf  canopy so dense that shrubs and herbaceous vegetation are sparse.    The mast crop produced by shagbark is an important food source for  both fox squirrels and gray squirrels. Both kinds of squirrels often  use these hickories as sites for their stick nests. White-footed mice  also store the nuts as a winter food source.    Birds which are most often seen in groves of shagbark include the  yellow-bi"]]]
