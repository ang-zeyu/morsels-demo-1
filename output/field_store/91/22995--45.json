(Female.)           *       *       *       *       *    This is the only species among those I have united under the genus  _Licinia_, which has any shade of red mixed in the colouring, all the  others being variegated only with white, yellow, and black. It is a native  of Brazil, and according to Godart of Guyana and the Antilles: though not  common, it is sometimes frequent in local situations, preferring the  borders of deep forests, and flying very slowly. I had the means of fully  ascertaining the two sexes, of which the two upper figures are of the male,  and the lower one the female. There can be no doubt the latter is the  _Pieris Amphione_, so admirably described by M. Godart, who, however, makes  no mention of the black marginal spots on the under side of the posterior  wings, represented in Cramer's figure, which may therefore be a variety.  More difficulty, however, exists in ascertaining if the male is distinct  from _P. Laia_, of Godart: the figures of Cramer, in general, are so  inaccurate, as always to excite a doubt in cases of nice discrimination;  Godart's description, nevertheless, perfectly agrees with Cramer's figure:  if it was, therefore, drawn up from the insect itself, there can be little  doubt that _Laia_ is distinct from _Amphione_; if, on the other hand, M.  Godart made his description only from Cramer's figure, the question remains  in its original uncertainty.    The club of the antennae is white, tipt with pale brown. The under side of  the female very closely resembles the upper, excepting that the black  stripe on the lower wings is broken; and there are irregular blotches of  white at the tips of both wings, but no marginal spots, as represented by  Cramer.    It will be found that _Licinia_ is the connecting genus between those of  _Danais_ and _Pieris_, of Latreille, and that the transition between the  last of these and _Colias_ is strongly marked by that of Terias, (_Zool.  Ill. pl._ 22).    What with the inaccuracy of figures, and the almost universal neglect with  which the most eminent entomologists have passed over this beautiful order,  the natural arrangement and affinities of the _Lepidoptera_ still remain in  the greatest obscurity; and it is recommended to those who may object to  the additional generic distinctions I have made, to examine, in the first  instance, the relative validity they bear in essential character to the  innumerable genera that are continually created in the _Coleoptera_,  _Hymenoptera_, and _Diptera_.           *       *       *       *       *      Pl. 92    [Illustration]    PAPILIO,    _Butterfly_           *       *       *       *       *    GENERIC CHARACTER.        _Antennae graciles, clavis elongatis, obtusis, sub-arcuatis, raro      compressis.

It has been interwoven in one of their most beautiful  allegories, and has been consecrated in our own days by several poets,  though by none with such exquisite taste and moral feeling, as by the  venerable Historian of the Medici.    So few of those insects, generally called Butterflies, were known to  Linnaeus, that he included them all in one genus, dividing them, for the  most part, into natural groups. Fabricius continued this arrangement, with  little variation, and has left us the description of near 1,150 species!  Yet before his death, this laborious naturalist saw the absolute necessity  of dividing this immense genus into many others, and left among his MSS. a  sketch of his proposed arrangement, published afterwards by Illiger, and  partially adopted (we venture to think also very imperfectly) by M.  Latreille.    The insects which are therefore now left under the old genus _Papilio_, are  principally found out of Europe, and are remarkable for their richness of  colouring and immense size. M. M. Latreille and Godart have described, with  great precision, 146 species: it is, however, to be regretted, that they  have adopted no sections or divisions to assist the student in his search  after any particular species, among this extensive number. The great  disadvantage of this is very obvious, and it has induced me to attempt  something like a natural distribution of those insects, which, with every  care to avoid an unnatural separation of kindred groups, I am fully aware,  in some cases, is very artificial, and it is only offered until a greater  knowledge of the larvae, &c. will enable us to fix on more substantial  characters than those I have adopted. This, however, will be a work of  time; and until then, I think some guide to the ready knowledge of the  species, however objectionable, is better than none.    Much might be said on the affinities which connect this with several other  genera. Among the most striking is that existing between them and the  _Noctuae_ (_N. Patroclus_ Fab.) by means of _Pap. Leilus_ Lin. which thus  stands between the night and the day-flying Lepidoptera. Many of the  insects placed in our division of _Graeci caudati_, are allied to _Danaus_  Lat. by the larva of both having retractile hornshaped processes, and the  two genera seem still further connected by _Papilio similis_ and  _dissimilis_ in one group, and by _P. Priamus_ in the other; while the  clear winged species from New Holland seem to indicate an affinity with the  _Heliconiae_.    The laborious and important investigations of M. Savigny into the structure  of the mouth of these insects are too well known, to require a more  particular notice in this slight sketch of the subject.           *       *       *       *       *    PAPILIO Polymetus.           *       *       *       *       *    SPECIFIC CHARACTER.        _P.

While the party thus mused and speculated, we had come out into the open  country, south-west of town, and were now approaching Webster's Mound, a  cone-shaped hill from which we afterward obtained some excellent views.  For the trip we had been supplied with two dogs, one a setter, belonging  to the private secretary of the Governor, and the other a pointer, the  property of a real estate dealer. The former was an ancient and  venerable animal. The rheumatism was seized of his backbone and held  high revel upon the juices which should have lubricated the joints. Even  his tail wagged with a jerk, inclining the body to whichever side it had  last swung. He was so full of rheumatism that whenever he scented a  chicken the pain evoked by the excitement caused him to howl with  anguish. The pointer, per contra, was hale and swift, but had lost one  eye; and a shot from the same charge which destroyed that organ,  rattled also on his left ear-drum, and that membrane no longer responded  to the shouts of the hunter. On one side he could see, and not hear--on  the other, hear, but not see. Nevertheless, with gestures for the left  view, and shouts on the right, fair work might still be obtained. Both  dogs rejoiced in the uncommon name of Rover, and both possessed that  most excellent of all points in such animals, a steady point.    If any of my readers are fond of field-sports, and have not yet shot  prairie-chickens over a dog, let them take their guns and hie to the  West, and taste for themselves of this rare sport. With the wide prairie  around him, keeping the bird in full view during its passage through the  air, one can choose his distance for firing and witness the full effect  of his shot. I think the brief instant when the flight of the bird is  checked and it drops head-foremost to earth, is the sweetest moment of  all to the hunter.          CHAPTER IV.         CHICKEN-SHOOTING CONTINUED--A SCIENTIFIC PARTY TAKE THE BIRDS ON       THE WING--EVILS OF FAST FIRING--AN OLD-FASHIONED \"SLOW SHOT\"--THE       HABITS OF THE PRAIRIE-CHICKEN--ITS PROSPECTIVE EXTINCTION--MODE OF       HUNTING IT--THE GOPHER SCALP LAW.      We had left the road and were now driving over the fine prairie skirting  Webster's Mound, the grass being about a foot high and affording  excellent cover. Taking advantage of its being matted so closely from  the early frosts, the old cocks hid under the thick tufts and called for  close work on the part of our dogs.    Back and forth across our path these intelligent animals ranged, the one  fifty yards or so to our right, the other as many to our left, crossing  and re-crossing, with open mouths drinking in eagerly the tainted  breeze. This latter was in our favor, and both dogs suddenly joined  company and worked up into it, with outstretched noses pointing to game  that was evidently close ahead.    The pointer crawled cautiously, like a tiger, his spotted belly sweeping  the earth, and his tail, which had been lashing rapidly an instant  before, gradually stiffening. He would open his mouth suddenly, drink in  a quick, deep draught of air, and, closing the jaws again, hold it until  obliged to take another respiration. He seemed as loath to let the  scent of the chicken pass from his nostrils as a hungry newsboy is to  quit the savory precincts of Delmonico's kitchen window. The setter's  old bones appeared to renew their youth under the excitement, and he was  as active as a retired war-horse suddenly plunged into battle.    Both dogs came simultaneously to a point--tails curved up and rigid,  each body motionless as if cut in marble and one forepaw lifted. No  wonder so many men are wild with a passion for hunting. Kind Providence  smiles upon the legitimate sport from conception to close, and gives us  a _pose_ to start with fascinating to any lover of the beautiful,  whether hunter or not. But one must not pause to moralize while dogs are  on the point, or he will have more philosophy than chickens.    All the party had got safely to ground and were behind the dogs, with  guns ready and eyes eagerly fastened on the thick grass which concealed  its treasure as completely as if it had been a thousand miles below its  roots, or on the opposite side of this mundane sphere in China. Not a  thing was visible within fifty yards of our noses save two dogs standing  motionless, with stiffened tails and eyes fixed on, and nozzles pointed  toward, a spot in the sea of brown, withered grass, not ten feet away.    The Professor took out his lens, Mr. Colon let down the hammers of his  gun and cocked them again, to be sure all was right, while Sachem wore a  puzzled expression as if undecided whether the attitude of the dogs  indicated any thing particular or not. The grass nodded and rustled in  the light wind, but not a blade moved to indicate the presence of any  living thing beneath it, while the dogs remained as if petrified.    The Professor said it was very remarkable, and wondered what had better  be done next. Mr. Colon thought that the dogs were tired, and we might  as well get into the wagon. Another suggested at random that we should  set the dogs on, and Muggs, who had probably heard the expression  somewhere, cried, \"Hi, boys, on bloods!\" At the words the dogs made a  few quick steps forward, and on the instant the grass seemed alive with  feathered forms, popping into air like bobs in shuttlecock. Such a  fluttering and flying I have never seen since, when a boy, I ventured  into a dove cote, and was knocked over by the rush of the alarmed  inmates. From under our very feet, almost brushing our faces, the  beautiful pinnated grouse of the prairies left their cover, and us also.    Every gun had gone off on the instant, and we doubt if one was raised an  inch higher than it happened to be when the covey started. The Professor  afterward extracted some stray shot from the legs of his boots, and the  setter, which was next to Muggs, gave a cry of pain for which there was  evidently other cause than rheumatism, as was demonstrated by his  retirement to the rear, from which he refused to budge until we all got  into the wagon, and to which he invariably retreated whenever we got  out.    [Illustration: _BUREAU OF ILLUSTRATION BUFFALO. N. Y._    OUR FIRST BIRD-SHOOTING.]    From the midst of the birds which were soaring away, one was seen to  rise suddenly a few feet above his comrades, and then fall straight  as a plummet, and head first, to earth. It had caught some stray shot  from the bombardment--Muggs claimed from his gun, but this statement the  setter, could he have spoken, would certainly have disputed.    Semi-Colon brought in the game, which proved to be a fine male, with  whiskers and full plumage, which must have made sad havoc among the  hearts of the hens, when the old fellow was on annual dress parade in  the spring. At that season of the year the cocks seek some knoll of the  prairie, where the grass has been burnt or cut off, and strut up and  down with ruffled feathers, uttering meanwhile a booming sound, which  can be heard in a clear morning for miles. The flabby pink skin that at  other seasons hangs in loose folds on his neck is then distended like a  bagpipe, and he is a very different bird from the same individual in his  Quaker gray and respectable summer and fall habits.    Ensconced again in the wagon, our party moved forward, the dogs, as  before, examining the prairie. The professor was comparing the birds of  the present and the past ages, when Muggs suddenly blasted his eyes and  declared the beasts were at it again. And so they were, the setter  making a good stand at some game in the grass, and the other dog, a  short distance off, pointing his companion. During the remainder of the  day we found many large flocks of birds, and fired away until two or  three swelled noses testified how dirty our guns were.    \"Fast shooting,\" said the professor, as we were on our way home, \"is as  bad as that too slow. Although I am no sportsman from practice, I love  and have studied the principles of it. In my father's day the rule was,  when a bird rose, for a hunter to take out his snuff-box, take snuff,  replace the box, aim, and fire. You may find the advice yet in some  works. The shot then has distance in which to spread. With close  shooting they are all together, and you might as well fire a bullet.  When you have given the bird time, act quickly. The first sight is the  best. Again, the first moment of flight, with most birds, is very  irregular, as it is upward, instead of from you.\"    Dobeen begged leave to inform our \"honors\" that in Ireland, after a bird  rose, the rule was, instead of taking snuff, to take off the boots  before firing. The professor thought that such a habit related to  outrunning the gamekeeper, and was intended to procure distance for the  poacher rather than the bird.    Sachem stated that he had known a slow hunter once. He was a  revolutionary veteran, used a revolutionary musket, and believed in  revolutionary powder. He refused to do any thing different from what his  fathers did, and abhorred double-barreled shotguns and percussion-caps  as inventions of the devil. It was constantly, \"General Washington did  this,\" and \"Our army did that,\" and his old head shook sadly at the  innovations Young America was making. His ghost, with the revolutionary  musket on its shoulder, had since been known to chase hunters, with  breech-loaders, who were caught on his favorite ground after dark. \"Old  1776\" was great on wing-shooting, and could be seen at almost any time  hobbling over the moor, firing away at snipe and water-fowl. He was one  of those slow, deliberate cases, always taking snuff after the bird  rose. There would be a glitter of fluttering wings as the game shot into  air. Down would come the long musket, out would come the snuff-box, and  the old soldier would go through the present, make"]]]
