The ships were furnished with \"castles,\" fore and aft; they carried gay  pennons and were richly stored. The artillery comprised sixty-two  culverins and smaller ordnance. Five thousand or more pounds of powder  were shut up in the magazines, and a large provision was made for  trading with the natives--looking glasses for women, velvets, knives,  and ivory ornaments, and twenty thousand bells.    Magellan's ship bore a lantern, swung high in the air amid the thickly  corded rigging, which the other ships were to keep in view in the night.  What a history had this lantern! It gleamed out on the night track of a  new world, a pillar of fire that encompassed the earth as in the orbit  of a star.    The fleet had fifteen days of good weather and passed Cape Verde  Islands, running along the African coast.    But the fleet carried with it disloyal hearts. The Portuguese prejudice  against Magellan sailed with it. The Spanish sailors distrusted the  loyalty of Magellan to Spain.    The commander was a man of great heart, chivalrous, and noble, but he  could be firm when there arose an occasion for it.    After leaving Teneriffe Magellan altered his course.    Juan de Carthagena, captain of the San Antonio, \"the inspector\" and a  spy, demanded of Magellan why he had done so.    \"Sir,\" said Magellan, \"you are to follow my flag by day and my lantern  by night, and to ask me no further questions.\"    Carthagena demanded that Magellan should report his plans to him.  Finding that the Admiral was bent on conducting his own expedition, he  began to act sullenly, and to disobey orders.    Again the captain of the San Antonio demanded of Magellan that he should  communicate his orders in regard to the course of steerage to him. He  did this by virtue of his office as inspector. He showed a very haughty  and disloyal spirit, and if this were not to be checked, the success of  the expedition would be imperilled. He was abetted by Pedro Sanches, a  priest. Magellan saw treason already brewing, and he determined to stamp  it out at once.    He went to Carthagena, and laid his hands on him.    \"Captain, you are my prisoner.\"    The astonished captain cried out to his men:    \"Unhand me--seize Magellan!\"    Carthagena had been a priest, and he had great personal influence, but  the men did not obey him.    \"Lead him to the stocks and secure him there,\" ordered Magellan.    The order was obeyed. The fallen inspector was committed to the charge  of the Captain of the Victoria, and another officer was given charge of  the San Antonio.    \"When we reach land Juan de Carthagena shall be marooned,\" was the  sentence imposed upon the inspector. A like sentence was imposed upon  Sanches.    It touched the hearts of the crews to hear this sentence. What would  become of the two priests, were it to be executed? Would they fall prey  to the natives, or perhaps win the hearts of the people and be made  chiefs among them?    There was a pilot on board the ship who sympathized with the mutineers,  but who had close lips, Esteban Gormez, of whom we have spoken. Were the  two mutineers to be marooned he would be glad to rescue them.    [Illustration: Night after night the ships followed Magellan's  lantern.]    He had been discontented since the day that his own plans for an  expedition had been superseded by those of Magellan.    His discontentment had grown. He became critical as the fleet sailed on.  Every day reminded him of what he might have done, if he could have only  secured the opportunity.    A disloyal heart in any enterprise is a very perilous influence. A  wooden horse in Troy is more dangerous than an army outside.    Magellan in Gormez had a subtle foe, and that foe was his own  countryman.    This man probably could not brook to see his rival add the domains of  the sea to the crowns of Juana and of Charles, though he himself had  sought to do the same thing. Magnanimous he could not be. Discovery for  the sake of discovery had little meaning for him, but only discovery for  his own advancement and glory.    He became jealous of Mesquita, Magellan's cousin, now master of the  Antonio, who is thought to have advised severe measures to suppress  conspiracy.    Night after night he sat down under the moon and stars, and brooded over  his fancied neglect, and dreamed. Night after night the ships followed  the lantern of Magellan, and the wonders of the sea grew; but to him it  were better that no discoveries should be made than that such  achievements were to go to the glory of Spain through the pilotage of  Magellan.    Discontent grows; jealousy grows as one broods over fancied wrongs, and  sees the prospects of a rival's success. So it was with Gormez. In his  heart he did not wish the expedition to succeed. He was ambitious to  lead such an enterprise himself, which he also did, at last, sailing  along Massachusetts Bay and giving it its first name.    When Gormez had heard that the two disloyal men were to be marooned, his  feelings rose against Magellan. That they deserved their sentence he  well knew, but they were opposed to Magellan, as was his own heart. He  would have been glad to have saved them from the execution of their  sentence, but he did not know how to do it.    \"I will rescue them if ever I can,\" he thought. \"This expedition is not  for the glory of Portugal.\"    The ships sailed on, bearing the two conspirators to some place where  they could be marooned.    Let us turn from this dark scene to one of a more hopeful spirit.    One day, as we may picture the scene, the sea lay unruffled like a  mirror. The ships drifted near each other, and night came on after a  sudden twilight, and the stars seemed like liquid lights shot forth or  let down from some ethereal fountain. The Southern Cross shone so  clearly as to uplift the eyes of the sailors. The ships were becalmed.    Boats began to ply between the ships, and the officers of the Trinity,  Santiago, Victoria, and Concepcion assembled under the awning of the San  Antonio, Mesquita's ship, of one hundred and twenty tons.    Mesquita, as we have said, was a cousin of Magellan, and so the Antonio  seemed a friendly ship.    Magellan sat down by his cousin. The lantern was going out; its force  was spent.    \"We must get a new kind of lantern,\" said Magellan to his cousin, \"and a  code of signal lights. We need a lantern that is something more steady  and durable than a faggot of wood.\"    \"I have here a new farol,\" he continued, the men listening with intent  ears. \"Here it is, and I wonder, my sailors, how far your eyes will  follow it.\"    \"All loyal hearts will follow it,\" said Mesquita, \"wherever it may go.\"    Gormez frowned. His heart was bitter.    There rose up an officer named Del Cano, and stood hat in hand. All eyes  were fixed upon him.    \"May it please you, Admiral,\" he said, \"to receive a word from me. I  will follow the new farol wherever it may lead me. I have ceased to  count my own life in this cause.\"    Gormez frowned again.    \"Del Cano,\" said the Admiral, \"I believe in you. You have a true heart.  If I should fall see that this farol goes back to Spain!\"    Del Cano bowed.    [Illustration: Arms granted to Sebastian Del Cano, Captain of the  Victoria, the first vessel that circumnavigated the globe.]    Magellan showed the new lantern to the officers. It was made of beaten  reeds that had been soaked in water, and dried in the sun. It would hold  light long, and carry it strongly and steadily.    \"All the ships must have these new farols,\" said he, \"and I must teach  you how to signal by them.\"    He stood up. The moon was rising, and the dusky, purple air became  luminous.    He held the farol in his hand.    \"Two lights,\" he said, \"shall mean for the ship to tack.    \"Three lights that the sails shall be lowered. Four, that they shall  stop.    \"Five lights, or more, that we have discovered land, when the flagship  shall discharge a bombard. Follow my lantern always; you can trust it  wherever it may fare. My farol shall be my star!\"    The men sat there long. There sprung up a breeze at last, and the sea  began to ripple in the moon.    Most expeditions that have made successful achievements have carried men  of great hope. Such a man was Del Cano. He was loyal to the heart of  Magellan; and happy is any leader who has such a companion, whose steel  rings true.    Magellan hung out the farol. The sails were spread, and the fleet passed  on over the solitary ocean.    Whither?          CHAPTER VIII.    \"THE WONDERS OF NEW LANDS.\"--PIGAFETTA'S TALES OF HIS ADVENTURES WITH  MAGELLAN.--THE STORY OF \"THE FOUNTAIN TREE.\"--\"ST. ELMO'S FIRE.\"      The ships moved on, bearing the hopeful Del Cano, the frowning Gormez,  the two prisoners, and the happy Italian Pigafetta.    Our next chapters will be a series of wonder tales which reveal the  South Temperate Zone and its inhabitants as they appeared to the young  and susceptible Italian, Pigafetta, nearly four hundred years ago.    Pigafetta, as we have shown, desired to accompany Magellan that he might  \"see the wonders of the new lands.\" He saw them indeed, and he painted  them with his pen so vividly that they will always live. We get our  first views of the strange inhabitants of the Southern regions of the  New World from him. We are to follow his narratives, as printed for the  Hakluyt Society, London, making some omissions, and changing its form in  part, hoping thereby to render the text more clear. We closely follow  the spirit of events. Pigafetta addresses his narrative \"To the very  illustrious and very excellent Lord Philip de Villiers Lisleaden, Grand  Master of Rhodes,\" of whom we have spoken.    [Illustration: Interior of the Alcazar of Seville.]    He says, by way of introduction:    \"Finding myself in Spain in the year of the nativity of our Lord, 1519,  at the court of the most serene King of the Romans (Char"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37823"],[0,"Neotropical Hylid Frogs, Genus Smilisca (#7)"],[1,"Ixtla, CNHM 102400, UIMNH 30832;  Tequesquitengo, AMNH 52036-9.    =Nayarit=: 3 km.
