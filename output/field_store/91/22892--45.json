I put in three or four days looking  after other traps, thinking but little about the bear that had, so  far, been beyond my skill.    After three or four days, I again went to the deadfall, wondering and  imagining all kinds of things. When I came to the steel traps the  bait was still undisturbed and I was now sure that that particular  bear was not for me, but when I stepped into the thicket so that I  could see the deadfall, there was Bruin, good and dead. When I looked  at the bear I found that he had three toes gone from one foot and  this I thought to be the cause of his being so over-shy of the steel  traps.    I learned a lesson that has since served me more than one good turn.    * * *    In later years it was customary for many of my friends to come to my  camp and spend a few days with me. It was of one of these occasions  that I will relate. Two young men, named Benson and Hill, had sent me  word that they were coming out to my camp and hunt a few days; also  to go with me to my bear traps but added that they did not suppose  that I would get a bear while they were in camp, even if they would  stay all winter.    It had been drizzling sort of a rain for several days and every old  bear hunter knows that dark, lowery weather is the sort bears like to  do their traveling in. I had set the time to go out on a stream known  as the Sunken Branch, to look after some fox traps and also two bear  traps that I had in that section the day I got word from Benson and  Hill that they would be over to camp the next day. I thought I would  put off going to look after the traps in that locality until the boys  came over and should I have the luck to find a bear in one of the  traps it would come very acceptable to have the help to get the bear  to camp for it was some four or five miles to the farthest trap.    The boys came as they said but the next morning after they got there  it was raining very hard and they did not want to go out and did not  want me to go until it slacked up. Well, the next morning it was  raining hard and the boys were in no better mood to go out than the  day before. It had been several days since I had been to the traps,  in that direction, and there were some chestnuts in that locality  where the bear traps were set. The storm had knocked the chestnuts  out and it was probable that bears would be in that locality. I told  the boys I did not like to let the traps go any longer without  looking after them and they could stay in camp and I would go to the  traps. When I was about ready to start, Hill said that he would go  with me, notwithstanding the rain, though Benson tried to persuade us  not to go, stating that no bear was fool enough to travel in such a  rain and that all we would get would be a good thorough soaking.    I was determined to delay no longer looking at the traps and started  off when Hill said, \"Well, I'm with you.\" So we took the nearest cut  possible to reach the traps. Hill was continually wishing we would  find a bear in one of the traps and that he could shoot it so that he  could joke with Benson.    Our route took us along the top of a ridge for about three miles when  we dropped off to the first trap. When we were still half way up the  side of the ridge I saw that Hill had got his wish for I could see a  bear rolling and tumbling about down in the hollow and knew that it  was fast in the trap. I tried to point it out to Hill but he could  not get his eye on it, so we went farther down the hill when Jim  (that was Hill's given name) could see the bear. He said there was no  need of going closer, that he could shoot it from where we were, but  I said we must go closer as I did not like to make holes in the body  of the skin unnecessarily. We had only taken a few steps farther when  Jim said we were plenty close, that he could, shoot it from where we  were and that if we should go closer the bear might break out of the  trap and escape.    With all my urging I could not get Hill closer so I told him to be  sure that he shot the bear in the head and not in the body. I  discovered that Hill was very nervous and told him to take all the  time necessary to make a sure shot. When the gun cracked I saw a twig  fall that the gun had cut off fully three feet above the bear's head.  I urged Hill a few yards closer when he tried again with no better  results than the first shot. After making the third shot Hill said he  guessed that I had better shoot the bear as he thought something had  gone wrong with the sights on his gun. It was raining hard so I  killed the bear and took the entrails out, set the trap again and  left the bear lying on the ground. As it was a small bear we  concluded to take the bear to camp whole.    We hurried on to the next trap which was about a mile farther down  the stream. When we got to where the trap was set it was gone, but  the way things were torn up we could see that we had a bear this time  that was no small one.    The bear had worked down the stream, first climbing the hill on one  side of the stream until it became entangled in a jam of brush or old  logs, then back down the hill and up on the other side until it  became discouraged, when it would try the other side again. The bear  was continuously getting the clog fast under the roots of trees or  against old logs when it would gnaw the brush and tear them out by  the roots. It was also noticed where he would rake the bark on the  trees in trying to climb them, in hopes of escaping the drag that was  following him. The bear would gnaw and tear old logs to pieces  whenever the clog became fast against them.    This was all very interesting and exciting to Hill and he said he  would give Benson the laugh when we got to camp. Hill had made me  promise not to tell Benson how he had shot three times at the bear's  head and missed it.    The bear had worked his way down the stream nearly a mile from where  the trap was set, when we came upon him and shot him at once. Hill  declaring that it was getting too near night and raining too hard for  him to practice on shooting bear any more that day.    We skinned the bear, hung up the meat, took the trap and skin and  went back up the creek and set the trap in the same place again.  Taking the bear skin we started back to where we left the other bear.  After carrying the whole bear and bear skin until it was dark, we  hung the bear skin up in the crotch of a tree, taking the bear and  hurrying to camp at as lively a gait as we were able to make.    Hill said that while we had had a pretty rough day of it he would  make it all up in getting the joke on Benson if I would not give him  away on shooting the bears, as Hill was to tell Benson all about how  he did it.    Before we came to camp I said to Hill that if he cared to we would  play a joke on Benson. He wished to know what the plan was. I said  that we would fix the bear up in the path that led from the shack to  the spring and get Benson to go after a pail of water and run onto  the bear. So we planned to have Benson think that we got no bear and  after supper was over I was to take the pail and start to the spring  after a pail of fresh water when Hill was to interfere and insist  that Benson should go for the water as he had been in camp all day  and needed exercise.    It was about a hundred feet from the shack to the spring and down  quite a steep bank and about half way from the shack to the spring  was a beech log across the path. When we got near camp we made no  noise and when we came to the spring we washed our hands carefully to  remove any blood that might be on them. Then we took the bear to the  log that was across the path and placed the forepaws and shoulders up  over the log leaving the hind parts on the ground, then with a small  crotched stick placed under the bear's throat to hold up its head we  had it fixed up to look as natural as we were able to in the dark.    We went into the shack looking as downcast as a motherless colt. It  was unnecessary to deny getting any bear for Benson told us almost  before we were inside that we should have known that we would get no  bear in any such weather as we were having and none but simpletons  would have gone out in such rain.    We ate our supper which Benson had waiting for us. We had little to  say farther than to talk of what a fearful rain we were having. After  supper was over I took the water pail, though it was nearly full of  water, and threw the water out the door before Benson had time to  object, saying that I would get a pail of fresh water. Hill said that  we should let Benson go after the water as he had not been out of the  shanty all day and needed some fresh air. Benson consented to go  after another pail of water although he said that he had brought the  water that we had thrown out just before we came. I told Benson that  I would hold the light at the door so he could see but Benson replied  that I need not bother, all that was necessary was to leave the door  of the shack open so that he could see his way back.    About the time that Benson reached the log he gave a terrible howl  and we heard the water pail go rattling through the brush and when we  got to the door Benson was coming on all fours, scrambling as fast as  he could and yelling \"Bah--bah--bear--bear!\"    Hill nor I could not keep from roaring with laughter, and finally  Hill managed to say, \"Oh, you didn't see any bear.\"    Benson made no reply but was as white as a sheet and shook as though  he had the ague. We could not conceal our feelings and when Benson  found his speech he said, \"You think you are mighty cunning; if you  got a bear why didn't you say so and not act like two dumb idiots.\"    We had laughed so hard that Benson caught on and the game was up.    Well, after Benson was onto our joke, nothing would do but we"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3407"],[0,"The Spell of Egypt (#7)"],[1,"achievement. In these columns, in the putting up of them, dead men  sought to climb to sun and stars, limitless in desire, limitless in  industry, limitless in will. And at the tops of the columns blooms the  lotus, the symbol of rising. What a triumph in stone this hall was once,  what a triumph in stone its ruin is to-day! Perhaps, among temples, it  is the most wondrous thing in all Egypt, as it was, no doubt, the most  wondrous temple in the world; among temples I say, for the Sphinx is  of all the marvels of Egypt by far the most marvellous. The grandeur  of this hall almost moves one to tears, like the marching past of  conquerors, stirs the heart with leaping thrills at the capacities of  men. Through the thicket of columns, tall as forest trees, the intense  blue of the African sky stares down, and their great shadows lie along  the warm and sunlit ground. Listen! There are voices chanting. Men are  working here--working as men worked how many thousands of years ago. But  these are calling upon the Mohammedan's god as they slowly drag to  the appointed places the mighty blocks of stone. And it is to-day a  Frenchman who oversees them.         \"Help! Help! Allah give us help!       Help! Help! Allah give us help!\"    The dust flies up about their naked feet. Triumph and work; work  succeeded by the triumph all can see. I like to hear the workmen's  voices within the hall of Seti. I like to see the dust stirred by their  tramping feet.    And then I like to go once more to the little temple, to enter through  its defaced gateway, to stand alone in its silence between the rows of  statues with their arms folded upon their quiet breasts, to gaze into  the tender darkness beyond--the darkness that looks consecrated--to feel  that peace is more wonderful than triumph, that the end of things is  peace.    Triumph and deathless peace, the bugle-call and silence--these are the  notes of Karnak.          VIII    LUXOR    Upon the wall of the great court of Amenhotep III. in the temple of  Luxor there is a delicious dancing procession in honor of Rameses II. It  is very funny and very happy; full of the joy of life--a sort of radiant  cake-walk of old Egyptian days. How supple are these dancers! They seem  to have no bones. One after another they come in line upon the mighty  wall, and each one bends backward to the knees of the one who follows.  As I stood and looked at them for the first time, almost I heard  the twitter of flutes, the rustic wail of the African hautboy, the  monotonous boom of the derabukkeh, cries of a far-off gaiety such as one  often hears from the Nile by night. But these cries came down the long  avenues of the centuries; this gaiety was distant in the vasty halls  of the long-dead years. Never can I think of Luxor without thinking of  those happy dancers, without thinking of the life that goes in the sun  on dancing feet.    There are a few places in the world that one associates with happiness,  that one remembers always with a smile, a little thrill at the heart  that whispers \"There joy is.\" Of these few places Luxor is one--Luxor  the home of sunshine, the suave abode of light, of warmth, of the sweet  days of gold and sheeny, golden sunsets, of silver, shimmering nights  through which the songs of the boatmen of the Nile go floating to the  courts and the tombs of Thebes. The roses bloom in Luxor under the  mighty palms. Always surely beneath the palms there are the roses. And  the lateen-sails come up the Nile, looking like white-winged promises of  future golden days. And at dawn one wakes with hope and hears the songs  of the dawn; and at noon one dreams of the happiness to come; and at  sunset one is swept away on the gold into the heart of the golden world;  and at night one looks at the stars, and each star is a twinkling hope.  Soft are the airs of Luxor; there is no harshness in the wind that stirs  the leaves of the palms. And the land is steeped in light. From Luxor  one goes with regret. One returns to it with joy on dancing feet.    One day I sat in the temple, in the huge court with the great double row  of columns that stands on the banks of the Nile and looks so splendid  from it. The pale brown of the stone became almost yellow in the  sunshine. From the river, hidden from me stole up the songs of the  boatmen. Nearer at hand I heard pigeons cooing, cooing in the sun, as  if almost too glad, and seeking to manifest their gladness. Behind me,  through the columns, peeped some houses of the village: the white home  of Ibrahim Ayyad, the perfect dragoman, grandson of Mustapha Aga, who  entertained me years ago, and whose house stood actually within the  precincts of the temple; houses of other fortunate dwellers in Luxor  whose names I do not know. For the village of Luxor crowds boldly about  the temple, and the children play in the dust almost at the foot of  the obelisks and statues. High on a brown hump of earth a buffalo stood  alone, languishing serenely in the sun, gazing at me through the columns  with light eyes that were full of a sort of folly of contentment. Some  goats tripped by, brown against the brown stone--the dark brown earth of  the native houses. Intimate life was here, striking the note of coziness  of Luxor. Here was none of the sadness and the majesty of Denderah.  Grand are the ruins of Luxor, noble is the line of columns that boldly  fronts the Nile, but Time has given them naked to the air and to the  sun, to children and to animals. Instead of bats, the pigeons fly about  them. There is no dreadful darkness in their sanctuaries. Before them  the life of the river, behind them the life of the village flows and  stirs. Upon them looks down the Minaret of Abu Haggag; and as I sat in  the sunshine, the warmth of which began to lessen, I saw upon its lofty  circular balcony the figure of the muezzin. He leaned over, bending  toward the temple and the statues of Rameses II. and the happy dancers  on the wall. He opened his lips and cried to them:    \"God is great. God is great . . . I bear witness that there is no god  but God. . . . I bear witness that Mohammed is the Apostle of God. . . .  Come to prayer! Come to prayer! . . . God is great. God is great. There  is no god but God.\"    He circled round the minaret. He cried to the Nile. He cried to the  Colossi sitting in their plain, and to the yellow precipices of the  mountains of Libya. He cried to Egypt:    \"Come to prayer! Come to prayer! There is no god but God. There is no  god but God.\"    The days of the gods were dead, and their ruined temple echoed with the  proclamation of the one god of the Moslem world. \"Come to prayer! Come  to prayer!\" The sun began to sink.    \"Sunset and evening star, and one clear call for me.\"    The voice of the muezzin died away. There was a silence; and then, as if  in answer to the cry from the minaret, I heard the chime of the angelus  bell from the Catholic church of Luxor.    \"Twilight and evening bell, and after that the dark.\"    I sat very still. The light was fading; all the yellow was fading, too,  from the columns and the temple walls. I stayed till it was dark; and  with the dark the old gods seemed to resume their interrupted sway. And  surely they, too, called to prayer. For do not these ruins of old Egypt,  like the muezzin upon the minaret, like the angelus bell in the church  tower, call one to prayer in the night? So wonderful are they under  stars and moon that they stir the fleshly and the worldly desires that  lie like drifted leaves about the reverence and the aspiration that are  the hidden core of the heart. And it is released from its burden; and it  awakes and prays.    Amun-Ra, Mut, and Khuns, the king of the gods, his wife, mother of gods,  and the moon god, were the Theban triad to whom the holy buildings of  Thebes on the two banks of the Nile were dedicated; and this temple  of Luxor, the \"House of Amun in the Southern Apt,\" was built fifteen  hundred years before Christ by Amenhotep III. Rameses II., that vehement  builder, added to it immensely. One walks among his traces when one  walks in Luxor. And here, as at Denderah, Christians have let loose the  fury that should have had no place in their religion. Churches for their  worship they made in different parts of the temple, and when they were  not praying, they broke in pieces statues, defaced bas-reliefs, and  smashed up shrines with a vigor quite as great as that displayed in  preservation by Christians of to-day. Now time has called a truce.  Safe are the statues that are left. And day by day two great religions,  almost as if in happy brotherly love, send forth their summons by the  temple walls. And just beyond those walls, upon the hill, there is a  Coptic church. Peace reigns in happy Luxor. The lion lies down with the  lamb, and the child, if it will, may harmlessly put its hand into the  cockatrice's den.    Perhaps because it is so surrounded, so haunted by life and familiar  things, because the pigeons fly about it, the buffalo stares into it,  the goats stir up the dust beside its columns, the twittering voices of  women make a music near its courts, many people pay little heed to this  great temple, gain but a small impression from it. It decorates the  bank of the Nile. You can see it from the dahabiyehs. For many that is  enough. Yet the temple is a noble one, and, for me, it gains a definite  attraction all its own from the busy life about it, the cheerful hum and  stir. And if you want fully to realize its dignity, you can always visit  it by night. Then the cries from the village are hushed. The houses  show no lights. Only the voices from the Nile steal up to the obelisk of  Rameses, to the pylon from which the flags of Thebes once flew on festal  days, to the shrine of Alexander the Great, with its vultures and its  stars, and to the red granite statues of Rameses and his wives.    These last are as expressive as and of course more definite than my"]]]
