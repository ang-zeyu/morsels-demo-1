Thanksgiving was there before its time. The hard rules relaxed. One day  more, and the quarantine was at an end. The north-bound train halted  below the camp, and all together, President and agent, tall doctor and  happy nurses, took places on it, the first for headquarters at  Washington, the last for New Orleans, and home for Thanksgiving morning,  full of the joys of a duty well done, rich in well-paid labor, in the  love of those they had befriended, and the approval of a whole people,  South and North, when once their work should be known to them.    To the last, they clung to their little home-made Red Crosses as if they  had been gold and diamonds; and when at length the tracks diverged and  the parting must be made, it was with few words, low and softly spoken,  but meaning much, with a finger touch upon the little cross, \"When you  want us, we are there.\"    The supplies forwarded by us were estimated at ten thousand dollars. The  money received was $6,281.58. Out of this sum we paid our twenty nurses  three dollars a day, for seventy-nine days--their cost of living, and  their transportation when needed. We paid our doctor in charge twenty  dollars a day, the customary price, for the same period. We paid our  office rent, assistants, telegraphing, drayage for supplies sent on by  us (railroad transportation free), and all incidentals for a relief work  of over three months' duration. This ran our debit column over on the  other side over one thousand dollars. Our little part of the relief of  that misfortune was estimated at fifteen thousand dollars, and only  those relieved were more grateful than we.          IV    THE JOHNSTOWN FLOOD      On Sunday afternoon, May 31, 1889, with the waters of the Potomac two  feet deep on Pennsylvania Avenue, a half dozen of us left Washington for  Johnstown, over washed-out ties and broken tracks, with every little  gully swollen to a raging torrent. After forty-eight hours of this, we  reached the scene, which no one need or could describe, but if ever a  people needed help it was these.    Scarcely a house standing that was safe to enter, the wrecks piled in  rubbish thirty feet in height, four thousand dead in the river beds,  twenty thousand foodless but for Pittsburg bread rations, and a cold  rain which continued unbroken by sunshine for forty days.    It was at the moment of supreme affliction when we arrived at Johnstown.  The waters had subsided, and those of the inhabitants who had escaped  the fate of their fellows were gazing over the scene of destruction and  trying to arouse themselves from the lethargy that had taken hold of  them when they were stunned by the realization of all the woe that had  been visited upon them. How nobly they responded to the call of duty!  How much of the heroic there is in our people when it is needed! No idle  murmurings of fate, but true to the god-like instincts of manhood and  fraternal love, they quickly banded together to do the best that the  wisest among them could suggest.    For five weary months it was our portion to live amid the scenes of  destruction, desolation, poverty, want and woe; sometimes in tents,  sometimes without; and so much rain and mud, and such a lack of the  commonest comforts for a time, until we could build houses to shelter  ourselves and those around us. Without a safe and with a dry-goods box  for a desk, we conducted financial affairs in money and material to the  extent of nearly half a million dollars.    I shall never lose the memory of my first walk on the first day--the  wading in mud, the climbing over broken engines, cars, heaps of iron  rollers, broken timbers, wrecks of houses; bent railway tracks tangled  with piles of iron wire; bands of workmen, squads of military, and  getting around the bodies of dead animals, and often people being borne  away; the smouldering fires and drizzling rain--all for the purpose of  officially announcing to the commanding general (for the place was under  martial law) that the Red Cross had arrived in the field. I could not  have puzzled General Hastings more if I had addressed him in Chinese;  and if ours had been truly an Oriental mission, the gallant soldier  could not have been more courteous and kind. He immediately set about  devising means for making as comfortable as possible a \"poor, lone  woman,\" helpless, of course, upon such a field. It was with considerable  difficulty that I could convince him that the Red Cross had a way of  taking care of itself at least, and was not likely to suffer from  neglect.    Not a business house or bank left, the safes all in the bottom of the  river; our little pocketbook was useless, there was nothing to buy, and  it would not bring back the dead. With the shelter of the tents of the  Philadelphia Red Cross, that joined us en route with supplies, when we  could find a cleared place to spread, or soil to hold them, with a  dry-goods box for a desk, our stenographer commenced to rescue the first  dispatches of any description that entered that desolate city. The  disturbed rivers lapped wearily back and forth, the people, dazed and  dumb, dug in the muddy banks for their dead. Hastings with his little  army of militia kept order.    Soon supplies commenced to pour in from everywhere, to be received,  sheltered as best they could be from the incessant rain, and distributed  by human hands, for it was three weeks before even a cart could pass the  streets.    But I am not here to describe Johnstown--the noble help that came to it,  nor the still more noble people that received it--but simply to say that  the little untried and unskilled Red Cross played its minor tune of a  single fife among the grand chorus of relief of the whole country, that  rose like an anthem, till over four millions in money, contributed to  its main body of relief, with the faithful Kreamer at its head, had  modestly taken the place of the twelve millions destroyed. But after all  it was largely the supplies that saved the people at first, as it always  is, and the distribution of which largely consumed the money that was  contributed later.    From one mammoth tent which served as a warehouse, food and clothing  were given out to the waiting people through the hands of such volunteer  agents, both women and men, as I scarcely dare hope to ever see gathered  together in one work again. The great cry which had gone out had aroused  the entire country, and our old-time helpers, full of rich experience  and still richer love for the work, faithful to the cross of humanity as  the devotee to the cross of the Master, came up from every point--the  floods, the cyclones, the battle-fields--and kneeling before the shrine,  pledged heart and service anew to the work. Fair hands laying aside  their diamonds, and business men their cares, left homes of elegance and  luxury to open rough boxes and barrels, handle second-hand clothing, eat  coarse food at rough-board tables, sleep on cots under a dripping canvas  tent, all for the love of humanity symbolized in the little flag that  floated above them.    Clergymen left their pulpits and laymen their charge to tramp over the  hillsides from house to house, to find who needed and suffered, and to  carry to them from our tents on their shoulders, like beasts of burden,  the huge bundles of relief, where no beast of burden could reach.    We had been early requested by official resolution of the Finance  Committee of the City of Johnstown to aid them in the erection of  houses. We accepted the invitation, and at the same time proposed to aid  in furnishing the nucleus of a household for the home which should in  any way be made up. This aid seemed imperative, as nothing was left for  them to commence living with, neither beds, chairs, tables, nor cooking  utensils of any kind; and there were few if any stores open, and no  furniture in town.    Of this labor we had our share. Six buildings of one hundred feet by  fifty, later known as \"Red Cross Hotels,\" were quickly put up to shelter  the people, furnished, supplied, and kept like hotels, free of all cost  to them, while others were built by the general committee. Three  thousand of the latter were erected, and the Red Cross furnished every  one with substantial, newly purchased furniture, ready for occupancy.  The books of the \"Titusville Manufacturing Company\" will show one cash  order of ten thousand dollars for furniture. The three thousand houses  thus furnished each accommodated two families.    A ponderous book of nearly two feet square shows the name, sex, and  number of persons of each family, and a list of every article received  by them. To-day one looks in wonder at such a display of clerical labor  and accuracy, under even favorable conditions.    This was only accomplished by the hard, unpaid labor of every officer,  and the large amount of volunteer friendly aid that came to us.    The great manufacturers of the country, and the heavy contributing  agents, on learning our intentions, sent, without a hint from us, many  of their articles, as, for instance, New Bedford, Mass., sent mattresses  and bedding; Sheboygan, Wis., sent furniture and enameled ironware;  Titusville, Pa., with a population of ten thousand, sent ten thousand  dollars' worth of its well-made bedsteads, springs, extension-tables,  chairs, stands and rockers; and the well-known New York newspaper, The  Mail and Express, sent a large lot of mattresses, feather pillows,  bedclothing, sheets, and pillow-slips by the thousand and cooking  utensils by the ten thousands. Six large teams were in constant service  delivering these goods.    When the contributions slackened or ceased, and more material was  needed, we purchased of the same firms which had contributed, keeping  our stock good until all applications were filled. The record on our  books showed that over"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30249"],[0,"Ways of Nature (#7)"],[1," seems  to spring from more intense excitement and self-abandonment than the  ordinary song delivered from the perch. When its joy reaches the point  of rapture, the bird is literally carried off its feet, and up it goes  into the air, pouring out its song as a rocket pours out its sparks.  The skylark and the bobolink habitually do this, while a few others of  our birds do it only on occasions. One summer, up in the Catskills, I  added another name to my list of ecstatic singers--that of the vesper  sparrow. Several times I heard a new song in the air, and caught a  glimpse of the bird as it dropped back to the earth. My attention  would be attracted by a succession of hurried, chirping notes,  followed by a brief burst of song, then by the vanishing form of the  bird. One day I was lucky enough to see the bird as it was rising to  its climax in the air, and to identify it as the vesper sparrow. The  burst of song that crowned the upward flight of seventy-five or one  hundred feet was brief; but it was brilliant and striking, and  entirely unlike the leisurely chant of the bird while upon the ground.  It suggested a lark, but was less buzzing or humming. The preliminary  chirping notes, uttered faster and faster as the bird mounted in the  air, were like the trail of sparks which a rocket emits before its  grand burst of color at the top of its flight.    It is interesting to note that this bird is quite lark-like in its  color and markings, having the two lateral white quills in the tail,  and it has the habit of elevating the feathers on the top of the head  so as to suggest a crest. The solitary skylark that I discovered  several years ago in a field near me was seen on several occasions  paying his addresses to one of these birds, but the vesper-bird was  shy, and eluded all his advances.    Probably the perch-songster among our ordinary birds that is most  regularly seized with the fit of ecstasy that results in this lyric  burst in the air, as I described in my first book, \"Wake Robin,\" over  thirty years ago, is the oven-bird, or wood-accentor--the  golden-crowned thrush of the old ornithologists. Every loiterer about  the woods knows this pretty, speckled-breasted, olive-backed little  bird, which walks along over the dry leaves a few yards from him,  moving its head as it walks, like a miniature domestic fowl. Most  birds are very stiff-necked, like the robin, and as they run or hop  upon the ground, carry the head as if it were riveted to the body. Not  so the oven-bird, or the other birds that walk, as the cow-bunting, or  the quail, or the crow. They move the head forward with the movement  of the feet. The sharp, reiterated, almost screeching song of the  oven-bird, as it perches on a limb a few feet from the ground, like  the words, \"preacher, preacher, preacher,\" or \"teacher, teacher,  teacher,\" uttered louder and louder, and repeated six or seven times,  is also familiar to most ears; but its wild, ringing, rapturous burst  of song in the air high above the tree-tops is not so well known. From  a very prosy, tiresome, unmelodious singer, it is suddenly transformed  for a brief moment into a lyric poet of great power. It is a great  surprise. The bird undergoes a complete transformation. Ordinarily it  is a very quiet, demure sort of bird. It walks about over the leaves,  moving its head like a little hen; then perches on a limb a few feet  from the ground and sends forth its shrill, rather prosy, unmusical  chant. Surely it is an ordinary, common-place bird. But wait till the  inspiration of its flight-song is upon it. What a change! Up it goes  through the branches of the trees, leaping from limb to limb, faster  and faster, till it shoots from the tree-tops fifty or more feet into  the air above them, and bursts into an ecstasy of song, rapid,  ringing, lyrical; no more like its habitual performance than a match  is like a rocket; brief but thrilling; emphatic but musical. Having  reached its climax of flight and song, the bird closes its wings and  drops nearly perpendicularly downward like the skylark. If its song  were more prolonged, it would rival the song of that famous bird. The  bird does this many times a day during early June, but oftenest at  twilight. The song in quality and general cast is like that of its  congener, the water-accentor, which, however, I believe is never  delivered on the wing. From its habit of singing at twilight, and from  the swift, darting motions of the bird, I am inclined to think that in  it we have solved the mystery of Thoreau's \"night-warbler,\" that  puzzled and eluded him for years. Emerson told him he must beware of  finding and booking it, lest life should have nothing more to show  him. The older ornithologists must have heard this song many times,  but they never seem to have suspected the identity of the singer.    Other birds that sing on the wing are the meadowlark, goldfinch,  purple finch, indigo-bird, Maryland yellow-throat, and woodcock. The  flight-song of the woodcock I have heard but twice in my life. The  first time was in the evening twilight about the middle of April. The  bird was calling in the dusk \"yeap, yeap,\" or \"seap, seap,\" from the  ground,--a peculiar reedy call. Then, by and by, it started upward on  an easy slant, that peculiar whistling of its wings alone heard; then,  at an altitude of one hundred feet or more, it began to float about in  wide circles and broke out in an ecstatic chipper, almost a warble at  times, with a peculiar smacking musical quality; then, in a minute or  so, it dropped back to the ground again, not straight down like the  lark, but more spirally, and continued its call as before. In less  than five minutes it was up again. The next time, a few years later,  I heard the song in company with a friend, Dr. Clara Barrus. Let me  give the woman's impression of the song as she afterward wrote it up  for a popular journal.    \"The sunset light was flooding all this May loveliness of field and  farm and distant wood; song sparrows were blithely pouring out  happiness by the throatful; peepers were piping and toads trilling,  and we thought it no hardship to wait in such a place till the dusk  should gather, and the wary woodcock announce his presence. But hark!  while yet 'tis light, only a few rods distant, I hear that welcome  'seap ... seap,' and lo! a chipper and a chirr, and past us he  flies,--a direct, slanting upward flight, somewhat labored,--his bill  showing long against the reddened sky. 'He has something in his  mouth,' I start to say, when I bethink me what a long bill he has.  Around, above us he flies in wide, ambitious circles, the while we are  enveloped, as it were, in that hurried chippering sound--fine,  elusive, now near, now distant. How rapid is the flight! Now it sounds  faster and faster, 'like a whiplash flashed through the air,' said my  friend; up, up he soars, till he becomes lost to sight at the instant  that his song ends in that last mad ecstasy that just precedes his  alighting.\"    The meadowlark sings in a level flight, half hovering in the air,  giving voice to a rapid medley of lark-like notes. The goldfinch also  sings in a level flight, beating the air slowly with its wings broadly  open, and pouring out its jubilant, ecstatic strain I think it  indulges in this wing-song only in the early season. After the mother  bird has begun sitting, the male circles about within earshot of her,  in that curious undulating flight, uttering his \"per-chic-o-pee,  per-chic-o-pee,\" while the female calls back to him in the tenderest  tones, \"Yes, lovie; I hear you.\" The indigo-bird and the purple finch,  when their happiness becomes too full and buoyant for them longer to  control it, launch into the air, and sing briefly, ecstatically, in a  tremulous, hovering flight. The air-song of these birds does not  differ essentially from the song delivered from the perch, except that  it betrays more excitement, and hence is a more complete lyrical  rapture.    The purple finch is our finest songster among the finches. Its strain  is so soft and melodious, and touched with such a childlike gayety and  plaintiveness, that I think it might sound well even in a cage inside  a room, if the bird would only sing with the same joyous abandonment,  which, of course, it would not do.    It is not generally known that individual birds of the same species  show different degrees of musical ability. This is often noticed in  caged birds, among which the principle of variation seems more active;  but an attentive observer notes the same fact in wild birds.  Occasionally he hears one that in powers of song surpasses all its  fellows. I have heard a sparrow, an oriole, and a wood thrush, each  of which had a song of its own that far exceeded any other. I stood  one day by a trout-stream, and suspended my fishing for several  minutes to watch a song sparrow that was singing on a dry limb before  me. He had five distinct songs, each as markedly different from the  others as any human songs, which he repeated one after the other. He  may have had a sixth or a seventh, but he bethought himself of some  business in the next field, and flew away before he had exhausted his  repertory. I once had a letter from Robert Louis Stevenson, who said  he had read an account I had written of the song of the English  blackbird. He said I might as well talk of the song of man; that every  blackbird had its own song; and then he told me of a remarkable singer  he used to hear somewhere amid the Scottish hills. But his singer was,  of course, an exception; twenty-four blackbirds out of every  twenty-five probably sing the same song, with no appreciable  variations: but the twenty-fifth may show extraordinary powers. I told  Stevenson that his famous singer had probably been to school to some  nightingale on the Continent or in southern England. I might have told  him of the robin I once heard here that sang with great"]]]
