Black bullhead occurred in all habitats, but were less commonly  taken in the Big Blue and Little Blue rivers than in other streams.    =Ictalurus natalis= (LeSueur), yellow bullhead. Stations 7-G, 9-G,  10-G, 11-G, 17-G, 18-G, 19-G, 34-M, 35-M, 36-M, 37-M, 40-M, 47-M,  48-M, 53-S, and 55-M.    The yellow bullhead inhabited the muddy-bottomed streams and the  upland, gravelly creeks, usually occurring in the headwaters. I  obtained only one _I. natalis_ in the sandy Big Blue River.    =Ictalurus punctatus= (Rafinesque), channel catfish: Cragin  (1885:107); Meek (1895:135); Evermann and Cox (1896:386); and  Canfield and Wiebe (1931:6-7, 10) as \"channel catfish.\" Stations  1-S, 2-S, 3-S, 4-S, 5-G, 6-S, 7-G, 8-S, 9-G, 11-G, 14-S, 15-S, 16-G,  18-G, 25-S, 27-G, 30-M, 35-M, 38-S, 39-S, 41-S, 42-S, 43-S, 44-S,  46-M, 50-S, 51-M, 52-S, 53-S, and 56-S.    Channel catfish were most common in the larger, sandy streams, but  occurred in other kinds of streams. The ages and calculated total  lengths at the last annulus for 40 channel catfish were: I, no fish;  II, 7.3 (16); III, 10.6 (5); IV, 12.3 (5); V, 13.3 (6); VI, 15.5  (4); VII, 18.0 (3); and VIII, 21.9 (1). These lengths are slightly  lower than averages reported by Finnell and Jenkins (1954:5) in  Oklahoma impoundments.    The length-frequency distribution of 438 channel catfish, collected  by rotenone on August 5 and 7, 1958, indicated that two age-groups  were represented. Without examination of spines, I assigned 265 fish  to age-group O (1.3 to 2.9 inches, average 2.5) and 173 fish to  age-group I (3.1 to 5.8 inches, average 4.5). The average total  length of age group I (4.5 inches) is only slightly higher than the  total length at the first annulus reported as average for Oklahoma  (4.0 inches, Finnell and Jenkins, _loc. cit._). It seems unlikely  that my yearling fish taken in August, 1958, would have reached the  length at the second annulus recorded in my study of spines (7.3  inches) by the end of the 1958 growing season.    From 1952 to 1956, severe drought was prevalent in Kansas, probably  causing streams to flow less than at any previously recorded time  (Minckley and Cross, in press). This drought must have resulted in  reduced populations of fishes in the streams. The channel catfish  hatched in 1956 were therefore subjected to low competition for  food and space when normal flow was resumed in 1957, and grew  rapidly, reaching an average total length of 7.3 inches at the  second annulus, while channel catfish that were members of the large  1957 and 1958 hatches suffered more competition and grew more  slowly.    =Noturus flavus= Rafinesque, stonecat: Jennings (1942:365). Stations  3-S, 4-S, 6-S, 16-G, 25-S, 28-G, 38-S, 41-S, 42-S, 43-S, 52-S, 53-S,  and 56-S.    _Noturus flavus_ frequented riffles and swift currents along  sandbars in the Big Blue and Little Blue rivers. Cross (1954:311)  reported that \"the shale-strewn riffles of the South Fork [of the  Cottonwood River, Kansas] provide ideal habitat for the stonecat.\"  In my study-area, this species was found not only on rubble-bottomed  riffles, but occurred along both stationary and shifting sandbars  where no cover was apparent.    =Pylodictis olivaris= (Rafinesque), flathead catfish: Canfield and  Wiebe (1931:7) as \"yellow catfish.\" Stations 3-S, 4-S, 6-S, 8-S,  15-S, 25-S, 38-S, 41-S, 43-S, 44-S, 53-S, and 56-S.    Flathead catfish were found only in the larger rivers. The species  was taken rarely by seine, but was readily obtained by electric  shocker. Data on the age and growth and food-habits of this species  are to be the subject of another paper.    =Anguilla bostoniensis= (LeSueur), American eel: Jennings  (1942:365).    American eels are now rare in Kansas, and none was taken in my  survey. The specimen reported by Jennings (_loc. cit._) is at Kansas  State College (KSC 2916), and was taken by I. D. Graham from the Big  Blue River, Riley County, 1885.    =Fundulus kansae= Garman, plains killifish. Station 42-S.    The plains killifish was collected by me only at Station 42-S.  Specimens were collected from my Station 4-S by the Kansas State  College class in fisheries management in 1954 (KSC 4985). My  specimens were 11 to 13 mm. in total length.    =Roccus chrysops= (Rafinesque), white bass. Station 3-S.    That the white bass is indigenous to Kansas is evidenced by records  of Graham (1885:77) and Cragin (1885:111); however, since that time,  and prior to the introduction of this species into reservoirs in the  State, _R. chrysops_ has rarely been recorded in Kansas. I collected  young white bass at Station 3-S in both 1957 and 1958, and I  collected them also in an oxbow of the Kansas River four miles west  of Manhattan, Riley County, Kansas, in the mouth of McDowell's  Creek, Riley County, and in Deep Creek, Wabaunsee County, and I saw  other specimens from an oxbow of the Kansas River on the Fort Riley  Military Reservation, Riley County, Kansas. The apparent increase in  abundance of white bass in the Kansas River Basin must be  attributable to introductions in reservoirs, with subsequent escape  and establishment in the streams.    =Micropterus salmoides salmoides= (Lacepede), largemouth bass.  Stations 6-S, 11-G, 43-S, and 45-M.    Four largemouth bass were taken. This species has been widely  stocked in farm-ponds and other impoundments in Kansas.    =Lepomis cyanellus= Rafinesque, green sunfish: Breukelman  (1940:382); and Canfield and Wiebe (1931:5, 7-8, 10) as \"green  sunfish.\" All stations excepting 1-S, 2-S, 4-S, 8-S, 9-G, 15-S,  22-G, 25-S, 30-M, 32-G, 34-M, 38-S, 39-S, 41-S, 42-S, 43-S, 44-S,  45-M, 46-M, 47-M, 50-S, and 52-S.    Green sunfish occurred primarily in the muddy streams. The ages and  total lengths at the last annulus for 25 specimens are as follows:  I, 1.1 (9); II, 2.2 (4); III, 3.1 (7); IV, 5.4 (4); and V, 6.0 (1).  Male green sunfish were seen on nests on June 29, July 1, and July  9, 1958.    =Lepomis humilis= (Girard), orangespotted sunfish: Meek (1895:137);  Evermann and Cox (1896:418); Canfield and Wiebe (1931:6) as \"orange  spots\"; and Breukelman (1940:382). All stations excepting 1-S, 9-G,  13-G, 15-G, 17-G, 21-G, 26-G, 34-M, 36-M, 38-M, 43-M, 44-S, 47-M,  50-S, and 52-S.    _Lepomis humilis_ was most common over sand-silt bottoms. Only two  age-groups were found; their calculated total lengths were I, 1.7  (15); and II, 2.4 (10). Orangespotted sunfish were seen nesting on  the same dates as _Lepomis cyanellus_.    =Lepomis macrochirus= Rafinesque, bluegill. Stations 7-G, 13-G,  16-G, 24-G, and 59-G.    This species has been widely stocked in Kansas. Only  young-of-the-year and sub-adults were taken, and these were rare.    =Pomoxis annularis= Rafinesque, white crappie: Canfield and Wiebe  (1931:5-8, 10) as \"white crappie.\" Stations 3-S, 6-S, 8-S, 12-G,  42-S, and 53-S.    White crappie were rare, except in a borrow-pit at Station 6-S. Ages  and calculated total lengths at the last annulus for 50 specimens  from 6-S are as follows: I, 3.6 (22); II, 5.0 (14); III, 7.1 (5);  IV, 8.3 (7); and V, 10.7 (2).    =Pomoxis nigromaculatus= (LeSueur), black crappie. Station 6-S.    One black crappie (KU 4174) was taken. Canfield and Wiebe (1931:10)  noted: \"The Black Crappie has been planted here [Big Blue River  Basin in Nebraska] by the State, but, apparently, is not propagating  itself.\"    =Stizostedion canadense= (Smith), sauger. Station 56-S.    Mr. Larry Stallbaumer, of Marysville, Kansas, obtained a sauger (KU  4179) while angling on May 25, 1958.    =Stizostedion vitreum= (Mitchill), walleye.    Though I failed to obtain the walleye in my survey, Dr. Raymond E.  Johnson (personal communication) reported that the species occurred  in the Nebraskan portion of the Big Blue River in recent years.  Canfield and Wiebe (1931:6, 10) reported that \"yellow pike are taken  at Crete [Nebraska],\" but may have referred to either the walleye or  the sauger.    =Perca flavescens= (Mitchill), yellow perch: Canfield and Wiebe  (1931:5-6, 10) as \"ring perch\" and \"yellow perch.\"    This fish was not taken in my survey. Canfield and Wiebe (_loc.  cit_.) reported that the yellow perch \"had been planted by the State  [Nebraska].\"    =Etheostoma nigrum nigrum= Rafinesque, johnny darter: Jennings  (1942:365) as _Boleosoma nigrum nigrum_ (Rafinesque). Stations 10-G,  11-G, 12-G, 13-G, 16-G, 29-G, 40-M, 53-S, and 54-G.    The larger pools of gravelly streams were preferred by johnny  darters, but one specimen was taken from the main stream of the Big  Blue River, and the species was abundant in one stream over hard,  sand-silt bottom.    =Etheostoma spectabile pulchellum= (Girard), orangethroat darter:  Jennings (1942:365) as _Poecilichthys spectabilis pulchellus_  (Girard). Stations 5-G, 7-G, 10-G, 11-G, 12-G, 13-G, 16-G, 17-G,  18-G, 21-G, 23-G, 27-G, 28-G, 29-G, 33-M, 40-M, 49-M, 53-S, 54-G,  and 59-G.    The orangethroat darter was less restricted in habitat than the  johnny darter, occurring in all stream-types, but most often in the  riffles of gravelly streams. Most specimens from muddy or sandy  streams were small.    =Aplodinotus grunniens= Rafinesque, freshwater drum. Stations 3-S,  4-S, 6-S, 7-G, 8-S, 15-S, 38-S, 39-S, 53-S, and 56-S.    The ages and calculated total lengths at the last annulus for 42  freshwater drum from the Big Blue River were: I, 3.0 (10); II, 5.7  (6); III, 9.4 (7); IV, 12.1 (13); V, 14.0 (3); VI, 15.1 (2); and  VII, 16.3 (1).          HYBRID COMBINATIONS      I obtained two hybrid fishes in my study-area. One specimen of  _Notropis cornutus frontalis_ x _Chrosomus erythrogaster_ was taken  at Station 29-G. This combination was recorded by Trautman  (1957:114) in Ohio. The other hybrid was _Lepomis cyanellus_ x  _Lepomis humilis_, captured at Station 24-G."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3775"],[0,"Napoleon Bonaparte (#7)"],[1,"the  commencement of the campaign, entered the cabinet at the Tuileries,  and found an immense map of Italy, unrolled upon the carpet, and  Napoleon stretched upon it. With pins, whose heads were tipped with  red and black sealing-wax, to represent the French and Austrian  forces, Napoleon was studying all the possible combinations and  evolutions of the two hostile armies. Bourrienne, in silence, but  with deep interest, watched the progress of this pin campaign.  Napoleon, having arranged the pins with red heads, where he intended  to conduct the French troops, and with the black pins designating  the point which he supposed the Austrians would occupy, looked up  to his secretary, and said:    \"Do you think that I shall beat Melas?\"    \"Why, how can I tell!\" Bourrienne answered.    \"Why, you simpleton,\" said Napoleon, playfully; \"just look here.  Melas is at Alexandria, where he has his head-quarters. He will remain  there until Genoa surrenders. He has in Alexandria his magazines,  his hospitals, his artillery, his reserves. Passing the Alps here,\"  sticking a pin into the Great St. Bernard, \"I fall upon Melas in  his rear; I cut off his communications with Austria. I meet him  here in the valley of the Bormida.\" So saying, he stuck a red pin  into the plain of Marengo.    Bourrienne regarded this maneuvering of pins as mere pastime. His  countenance expressed his perfect incredulity. Napoleon, perceiving  this, addressed to him some of his usual apostrophes, in which he  was accustomed playfully to indulge in moments of relaxation, such  as, You ninny, You goose; and rolled up the map. Ten weeks passed  away, and Bourrienne found himself upon the banks of the Bormida,  writing, at Napoleon's dictation, an account of the battle of  Marengo. Astonished to find Napoleon's anticipations thus minutely  fulfilled, he frankly avowed his admiration of the military  sagacity thus displayed. Napoleon himself smiled at the justice of  his foresight.    Two days before the news of the battle of Marengo arrived in Vienna,  England effected a new treaty with Austria, for the more vigorous  prosecution of the war. By this convention it was provided that  England should loan Austria ten millions of dollars, to bear no  interest during the continuance of the conflict. And the Austrian  cabinet bound itself not to make peace with France, without  the consent of the Court of St. James. The Emperor of Austria was  now sadly embarrassed. His sense of honor would not allow him to  violate his pledge to the King of England, and to make peace. On  the other hand, he trembled at the thought of seeing the armies  of the invincible Napoleon again marching upon his capital. He,  therefore, resolved to temporize, and, in order to gain time, sent  an embassador to Paris. The plenipotentiary presented to Napoleon  a letter, in which the Emperor stated, \"You will give credit to  every thing which Count Julien shall say on my part. I will ratify  whatever he shall do.\" Napoleon, prompt in action, and uniformed  of the new treaty between Ferdinand and George III., immediately  caused the preliminaries of peace to be drawn up, which were signed  by the French and Austrian ministers. The cabinet in Vienna, angry  with their embassador for not protracting the discussion, refused  to ratify the treaty, recalled Count Julien, sent him into exile,  informed the First Consul of the treat which bound Austria not to  make peace without the concurrence of Great Britain, assured France  of the readiness of the English Cabinet to enter into negotiations,  and urged the immediate opening of a Congress at Luneville, to  which plenipotentiaries should be sent from each of the three great  contending powers. Napoleon was highly indignant in view of this  duplicity and perfidy. Yet, controlling his anger, he consented to  treat with England, and with that view proposed a naval armistice  , with the mistress of the seas. To this proposition England  peremptorily refused to accede, as it would enable France to throw  supplies into Egypt and Malta, which island England was besieging.  The naval armistice would have been undeniably for the interests  of France. But the continental armistice was as undeniably adverse  to her interests, enabling Austria to recover from her defeats, and  to strengthen her armies. Napoleon, fully convinced that England,  in he[r inaccessible position, did not wish for peace, and that her  only object, in endeavoring to obtain admittance to the Congress,  was that she might throw obstacles in the way of reconciliation  with Austria, offered to renounce all armistice with England, and  to treat with her separately. This England also refused.    It was now September. Two months had passed in these vexations and  sterile negotiations. Napoleon had taken every step in his power to  secure peace. He sincerely desired it. He had already won all the  laurels he could wish to win on the field of battle. The reconstruction  of society in France, and the consolidation of his power, demanded  all his energies. The consolidation of his power! That was just what  the government of England dreaded. The consolidation of democratic  power in France was dangerous to king and to noble. William Pits,  the soul of the aristocratic government of England, determined still  to prosecute the war. France could not harm England. But England,  with her invincible fleet, could sweep the commerce of France from  the seas. Fox and his coadjutors with great eloquence and energy  opposed the war. Their efforts were, however, unavailing. The  people of England, notwithstanding all the efforts of the government  to defame the character of the First Consul, still cherished the  conviction that, after all, Napoleon was their friend. Napoleon,  in subsequent years, while reviewing these scenes of his early  conflicts, with characteristic eloquence and magnanimity, gave  utterance to the following sentiments which, it is as certain as  destiny, that the verdict of the world will yet confirm.    \"Pitt was the master of European policy. He held in his hands the  moral fate of nations. But he made an ill use of his power. He  kindled the fire of discord throughout the universe; and his name,  like that of Erostratus, will be inscribed in history, amidst  flames, lamentations, and tears. Twenty-five years of universal  conflagration; the numerous coalitions that added fuel to the  flame; the revolution and devastation of Europe; the bloodshed of  nations; the frightful debt of England, by which all these horrors  were maintained; the pestilential system of loans, by which the  people of Europe are oppressed; the general discontent that now  prevails--all must be attributed to Pitt. Posterity will brand him  as a scourge. The man so lauded in his own time, will hereafter be  regarded as the genius of evil. Not that I consider him to have  been willfully atrocious, or doubt his having entertained the  conviction that he was acting right. But St. Bartholomew had also  its conscientious advocates. The Pope and cardinals celebrated it  by a Te Deum ; and we have no reason to doubt their having done  so in perfect sincerity. Such is the weakness of human reason and  judgment! But that for which posterity will, above all, execrate  the memory of Pitt, is the hateful school, which he has left behind  him; its insolent Machiavelism, its profound immorality, its cold  egotism, and its utter disregard of justice and human happiness.  Whether it be the effect of admiration and gratitude, or the result  of mere instinct and sympathy, Pitt is, and will continue to be,  the idol of the European aristocracy. There was, indeed, a touch of  the Sylla in his character. His system has kept the popular cause  in check, and brought about the triumph of the patricians. As for  Fox, one must not look for his model among the ancients. He is  himself a model, and his principles will sooner or later rule the  world. The death of Fox was one of the fatalities of my career. Had  his life been prolonged, affairs would taken a totally different  turn. The cause of the people would have triumphed, and we should  have established a new order of things in Europe.\"    Austria really desired peace. The march of Napoleon's armies upon  Vienna was an evil more to be dreaded than even the consolidation  of Napoleon's power in France. But Austria was, by loans and  treaties, so entangled with England, that she could make not peace  without the consent of the Court of St. James. Napoleon found that  he was but triffled with. Interminable difficulties were thrown  in the way of negotiation. Austria was taking advantage of the  cessation of hostilities, merely to recruit her defeated armies,  that, soon as the approaching winter had passed away, she might  fall, with renovated energies, upon France. The month of November  had now arrived, and the mountains, whitened with snow, were swept  by the bleak winds of winter. The period of the armistice had expired.  Austria applied for its prolongation. Napoleon was no longer thus  to be duped. He consented, however, to a continued suspension  of hostilities, on condition that the treaty of peace were signed  within forty-eight hours. Austria, believing that no sane man  would march an army into Germany in the dead of winter, and that  she should have abundant time to prepare for a spring campaign,  refused. The armies of France were immediately on the move. The  Emperor of Austria had improved every moment of this transient  interval of peace, in recruiting his forces. In person he had visited  the army to inspire his troops with enthusiasm. The command of the  imperial forces was intrusted to his second brother, the Archduke  John. Napoleon moved with his accustomed vigor. The political  necessities of Paris and of France rendered it impossible for him  to leave the metropolis. He ordered one powerful army, under General  Brune, to attack the Austrians in Italy, on"]]]
