In  the main, everything is worked by floats and strings or by hydraulic or  pneumatic forces, as in Heros devices. The automata are very elaborate,  with figures of men, monkeys, peacocks, etc., symbolizing the passage of  hours.      MEDIEVAL EUROPE    Echoes from nearly all the developments already noted from other parts  of the world are found to occur in medieval Europe, often coming  through channels of communication more precisely determinable than  those hitherto mentioned. Before the influx of Islamic learning at the  time of transmission of the Toledo Tables (12th century) and the  Alfonsine Tables (which reached Paris _ca._ 1292), there are occasional  references to the most primitive mechanized \"visual aids\" in astronomy.    The most famous of these occurs in an historical account by Richer of  Rheims about his teacher Gerbert (born 946, later Pope Sylvester II,  990-1003). Several instruments made by Gerbert are described in detail;  he includes a fine celestial globe made of wood covered with horsehide  and having the stars and lines painted in color, and an armillary sphere  having sighting tubes similar to those always found on Chinese  instruments but never on the Ptolemaic variety. Lastly, he cites \"the  construction of a sphere, most suitable for recognizing the planets,\"  but unfortunately it is not clear from the description whether or not  the model planets were actually to be animated mechanically. The text  runs:[27]      Within this oblique circle (the zodiac on the ecliptic of    the globe) he hung the circles of the wandering stars (the    planets) with marvellous ingenuity, whose orbits, heights    and even the distance from each other he demonstrated to    his pupils most effectually. Just how he accomplished this    it is unsuitable to enter into here because of its extent    lest we should appear to be wandering from our main theme.    Thus, although there is a hint of mechanical complexity, there is really  no justification for such an assumption; the description might well  imply only a zodiac band on which the orbits of the planets were  painted. On the other hand it is not inconceivable that Gerbert could  have learned something of Islamic and other extra-European traditions  during his period of study with the Bishop of Barcelona--a traveling  scholarship that seems to have had many repercussions on the whole field  of European scholarship.    Once the floodgates of Arabic learning were opened, a stream of  mechanized astronomical models poured into Europe. Astrolabes and  equatoria rapidly became very popular, mainly through the reason for  which they had been first devised, the avoidance of tedious written  computation. Many medieval astrolabes have survived, and at least three  medieval equatoria are known. Chaucer is well known for his treatise on  the astrolabe; a manuscript in Cambridge, containing a companion  treatise on the equatorium, has been tentatively suggested by the  present author as also being the work of Chaucer and the only piece  written in his own hand.    The geared astrolabe of al-Biruni is another type of protoclock to have  been transmitted. A specimen in the Science Museum, London,[28] though  unfortunately now incomplete, has a very sophistocated arrangement of  gears for moving pointers to indicate the correct relative positions and  movements of the sun and moon (see figs. 17 and 18). Like the earlier  Muslim example it contains wheels with odd numbers of gear teeth (14,  27, 39); however, the teeth are no longer equilateral in shape, but  approximate a more modern slightly rounded form. This example is French  and appears to date from _ca._ 1300. Another Gothic astrolabe with a  similar gear ring on the rete, said to date from _ca._ 1400 (it could  well be much earlier) is now in the Billmeier collection (London).[29]    Turning from the mechanized astrolabe to the mechanized equatorium, we  find the work of Richard of Wallingford (1292?-1336) of the greatest  interest as providing an immediate precursor to that of de Dondi. He  was the son of an ingenious blacksmith, making his way to Merton  College, Oxford, then the most active and original school of astronomy  in Europe, and winning later distinction as Abbot of St. Albans. A text  by him, dated 1326-27, described in detail the construction of a great  equatorium, more exact and much more elaborate than any that had gone  before.[30] Nevertheless it is evidently a normal manually operated  device like all the others. In addition to this instrument, Richard is  said to have constructed _ca._ 1320, a fine planetary clock for his  Abbey.[31] Bale, who seems to have seen it, regarded it as without rival  in Europe, and the greatest curiosity of his time. Unfortunately, the  issue was confused by Leland, who identified it as the Albion (_i.e._,  all-by one), the name Richard gives to his manual equatorium. This clock  was indeed so complex that Edward III censured the Abbot for spending so  much money on it, but Richard replied that after his death nobody would  be able to make such a thing again. He is said to have left a text  describing the construction of this clock, but the absence of such a  work has led many modern writers to support Leland's identification and  suppose that the device was not a mechanical clock.    [Illustration: Figure 17.--FRENCH GEARED ASTROLABE OF TREFOIL GOTHIC  DESIGN, _ca._ A.D. 1300. The gearing on the pointer is, from the  center: (32)/14-45+27-39, the last meshing with a concave annular gear  of 180 teeth around the rim of the rete of the astrolabe. A second  pointer, geared to this so as to follow the Moon, seems to be lacking.  (_Photo courtesy of Science Museum. London._)]    [Illustration: Figure 18.--GEAR TRAIN OF POINTER in figure 17. (_Photo  courtesy of Science Museum, London._)]    A corrective for this view is to be had from a St. Albans manuscript  (now at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge) that described the  methods for setting out toothed wheels for an astronomical horologium  designed to show the motions of the planets. Although the manuscript  copy is to be dated _ca._ 1340, it clearly indicates that a geared  planetary device was known in St. Albans at an early date, and it is  reasonable to suppose that this was in fact the machine made by Richard  of Wallingford. Unfortunately the text does not appear to give any  relevant information about the presence of an escapement or any other  regulatory device, nor does it mention the source of power.[32] Now a  geared version of the Albion would appear to correspond very closely  indeed to the dial-work which forms the greater part of the de Dondi  clock, and for this reason we suggest now that the two clocks were very  closely related in other ways too. This, circumstantial though it be, is  evidence for thinking that the weight drive and some form of escapement  were known to Richard of Wallingford, _ca._ 1320. It would narrow the  gap between the clock and the protoclocks to less than half a century,  perhaps a single generation, in the interval _ca._ 1285-1320. In this  connection it may be of interest that Richard of Wallingford knew only  the Toledo tables corpus, that of the Alfonsine school did not arrive in  England until after his death.    There are, of course, many literary references to the water-clocks in  medieval literature. In fact most of these are from quotations which  have often been produced erroneously in the history of the mechanical  clock, thereby providing many misleading starts for that history, as  noted previously in the discussion of the horologium. There are however  enough mentions to make it certain that water clocks of some sort were  in use, especially for ecclesiastic purposes, from the end of the 12th  century onwards. Thus, Jocelin of Brakelond tells of a fire in the Abbey  Church of Bury St. Edmunds in the year 1198.[33] The relics would have  been destroyed during the night, but just at the crucial moment the  clock bell sounded for matins and the master of the vestry sounded the  alarm. On this \"the young men amongst us ran to get water, some to the  well and others to the clock\"--probably the sole occasion on which a  clock served as a fire hydrant.    It seems probable that some of these water clocks could have been simple  drip clepsydras, with perhaps a striking arrangement added. A most  fortunate discovery by Drover has now brought to light a manuscript  illumination that shows that these water clocks, at least by _ca,_ 1285,  had become more complex and were rather similar in appearance to the  Alfonsine mercury drum.[34] The illustration (fig. 19) is from a  moralized Bible written in northern France, and accompanies the passage  where King Hezekiah is given a sign by the Lord, the sun being moved  back ten steps of the clock. The picture clearly shows the central water  wheel and below it a dog's head spout gushing water into a bucket  supported by chains, with a (weight?) cord running behind. Above the  wheel is a carillon of bells, and to one side a rosette which might be a  fly or a model sun. The wheel appears to have 15 compartments, each with  a central hole (perhaps similar to that in the Alfonsine clock) and it  is supported on a square axle by a bracket, the axle being wedged in the  traditional fashion. The projections at the edge of the wheel might be  gear teeth, but more likely they are used only for tripping the striking  mechanism. If it were not for the running water spout it would be very  close to the Alfonsine model; but with this evidence it seems impossible  to arrive at a clear mechanical interpretation.    From the adjacent region there is another account of a striking water  clock, the evidence being inscriptions on slates, discovered in Villers  Abbey near Brussels;[35] these may be closely dated as 1267 or 1268 and  provide the remains of a memorandum for the sacrist and his assistants  in charge of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30003"],[0,"Law and Laughter (#7)"],[1," said to have  been so indignant that he either wrote or dictated a pamphlet in which  the new creation was ridiculed, and to which was appended the  significant motto, \"The offence is rank.\"    The common feeling with regard to Sir James Scarlett's (Lord Abinger)  success in gaining verdicts led to the composition of the following  pleasantry, attributed to Lord Campbell. \"Whereas Scarlett had contrived  a machine, by using which, while he argued, he could make the judges'  heads nod with pleasure, Brougham in course of time got hold of it; but  not knowing how to manage it when he argued, the judges, instead of  nodding, shook their heads.\"    And it is Lord Campbell who has preserved the following specimen of a  judge's concluding remarks to a prisoner convicted of uttering a forged  one-pound note. After having pointed out to him the enormity of the  offence, and exhorted him to prepare for another world, added: \"And I  trust that through the merits and the mediation of our Blessed Redeemer,  you may there experience that mercy which a due regard to the _credit  of the paper currency_ of the country forbids you to hope for here.\"    Campbell married Miss Scarlett, a daughter of Lord Abinger, and was  absent from Court when a case in which he was to appear was called  before Mr. Justice Abbot. \"I thought, Mr. Brougham,\" said his lordship,  \"that Mr. Campbell was in this case?\"--\"Yes, my lord,\" replied Mr.  Brougham, with that sarcastic look peculiarly his own. \"He was, my lord,  but I understand he is ill.\"--\"I am sorry to hear that, Mr. Brougham,\"  said the judge. \"My lord,\" replied Mr. Brougham, \"it is whispered here  that the cause of my learned friend's absence is scarlet fever.\"           *       *       *       *       *    [Illustration: JOHN CAMPBELL, BARON CAMPBELL, LORD CHANCELLOR.]    In his native town of Cupar, Fife, Lord Chancellor Campbell's abilities  and position were not so much appreciated as they were elsewhere. This  was a sore point with his father, who was parish minister, and when the  son was not selected by the town authorities to conduct their legal  business in London the future Lord Chancellor also felt affronted. On  the publication of the _Lives of the Chancellors_ some of his townsmen  wrote asking him to present a copy to the local library of his native  town, which gave Campbell an opportunity to square accounts with them  for their past neglect of him, for he curtly replied to their request  that \"they could purchase the book from any bookseller.\" An old lady of  the town relating some gossip about the Campbell family said, \"They  meant John for the Church, but he went to London _and got on very  well_.\" Such was the good lady's idea of the relative positions of  minister of a Scottish parish and Lord Chancellor of England.    The difference in the pronunciation of a word led to an amiable contest  between Lord Campbell and a learned Q.C. In an action to recover damages  to a carriage the counsel called the vehicle a \"brougham,\" pronouncing  both syllables of the word. Lord Campbell pompously observed, \"Broom is  the usual pronunciation--a carriage of the kind you mean is not  incorrectly called a 'Broom'--that pronunciation is open to no grave  objection, and it has the advantage of saving the time consumed by  uttering an extra syllable.\" Later in the trial Lord Campbell alluding  to a similar case referred to the carriage which had been injured as an  \"Omnibus.\"--\"Pardon me, my lord,\" interposed the Q.C., \"a carriage of  the kind to which you draw attention is usually termed a 'bus'; that  pronunciation is open to no grave objection, and it has the great  advantage of saving the time consumed by uttering _two_ extra  syllables.\"           *       *       *       *       *    [Illustration: SIR SAMUEL MARTIN, BARON OF EXCHEQUER.]    Mr. Martin (afterwards Baron Martin), when at the Bar, was addressing  the Court in an insurance case, when he was interrupted by Baron  Alderson, who said, \"Mr. Martin, do you think any office would insure  your life?\"--\"Certainly, my lord,\" replied Mr. Martin, \"mine is a very  good life.\"--\"You should remember, Mr. Martin, that yours is brief  existence.\"    This judge's reason for releasing a juryman from duty was equally smart.  The juryman in question confessed that he was deaf in one ear. \"Then  leave the box before the trial begins,\" observed his lordship; \"it is  necessary that the jurymen should hear _both_ sides.\"    Baron Martin was one of the good-natured judges who from the following  story seem to stretch that amiable quality to its fullest extent. In  sentencing a man convicted of a petty theft he said: \"Look, I hardly  know what to do with you, but you can take six months.\"--\"I can't take  that, my lord,\" said the prisoner; \"it's too much. I can't take it; your  lordship sees I did not steal very much after all.\" The Baron indulged  in one of his characteristic chuckling laughs, and said: \"Well that's  vera true; ye didn't steal _much_. Well then, ye can tak' _four_. Will  that do--four months?\"--\"No, my lord, but I can't take that  neither.\"--\"Then take _three_.\"--\"That's nearer the mark, my lord,\"  replied the prisoner, \"but I'd rather you'd make it _two_, if you'll be  so kind.\"--\"Very well then, tak' two,\" said the judge; \"and don't come  again. If you do, I'll give you--well, it'll all depend.\"           *       *       *       *       *    [Illustration: FREDERICK THESIGER, BARON CHELMSFORD, LORD CHANCELLOR.]    Lord Erskine's punning upon legal terms has already been noticed, but no  better quip is recorded than that of Lord Chelmsford, when as Sir  Frederick Thesiger, and a leader at the Bar, he took exception to the  irregular examination of a witness by a learned serjeant. \"I have a  right,\" maintained the serjeant, \"to deal with my witness as I  please.\"--\"To that I offer no objection,\" retorted Sir Frederick. \"You  may _deal_ as you like, but you shan't _lead_.\"    On all occasions Samuel Warren, the author of _Ten Thousand a Year_, was  given to boasting, at the Bar mess, of his intimacy with members of the  peerage. One day he was saying that, while dining lately at the Duke of  Leeds, he was surprised at finding no fish of any kind was served. \"That  is easily accounted for,\" said Thesiger; \"they had probably eaten it all  _upstairs_.\"    Walking down St. James's Street one day, Lord Chelmsford was accosted by  a stranger, who exclaimed, \"Mr. Birch, I believe.\"--\"If you believe  that, sir, you'll believe anything,\" replied his lordship as he passed  on.           *       *       *       *       *    [Illustration: SIR ALEXANDER COCKBURN, BART., LORD CHIEF JUSTICE.]    In the recently published _Cockburn Family Records_ the following is  told of the Chief Justice's ready wit:    \"At a certain trial an extremely pretty girl was called as a witness.  The Lord Chief Justice was very particular about her giving her full  name and address. Of course he took note. So did the sheriff's officer!  That evening they both arrived at the young lady's door simultaneously,  whereupon Sir Alexander tapped the officer on the shoulder, remarking,  'No, no, no, Mr. Sheriff's Officer, judgment first, execution  afterwards!'\"    There never was a barrister whose rise at the Bar was more rapid or  remarkable than that of Sir Alexander Cockburn, and along with him was  his friend and close associate as a brother lawyer of the Crown and  Bencher of the same Inn, Sir Richard Bethel, who became Lord Chancellor  a few years after Sir Alexander was made Chief Justice. Sir Richard once  said to his colleague, \"My dear fellow, equity will swallow up your  common law.\"--\"I don't know about that,\" said Sir Alexander, \"but you'll  find it rather hard of digestion.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Although the wit of Lord Justice Knight Bruce was somewhat sarcastic it  was rarely so severe as that of Lord Westbury. There was always a tone  of good humour about it. He had indeed a kind of grave judicial waggery,  which is well exemplified in the following judgment in a separation suit  between an attorney and his wife. \"The Court has been now for several  days occupied in the matrimonial quarrels of a solicitor and his wife.  He was a man not unaccustomed to the ways of the softer sex, for he  already had nine children by three successive wives. She,  however--herself a widow--was well informed of these antecedents; and it  appears did not consider them any objection to their union; and they  were married. No sooner were they united, however, than they were  unhappily disunited by unhappy disputes as to her property. These  disputes disturbed even the period usually dedicated to the softer  delights of matrimony, and the honeymoon was occupied by endeavours to  induce her to exercise a testamentary power of appointment in his  favour. She, however, refused, and so we find that in due course, at the  end of the month, he brought home with some disgust his still intestate  bride. The disputes continued, until at last they exchanged the  irregular quarrels of domestic strife for the more disciplined warfare  of Lincoln's Inn and Doctors Commons.\"    Of this judge the story is told that a Chancery counsel in a long and  dry argument quoted the legal maxim--_expressio unius est exclusio  alterius_--pronouncing the \"i\" in _unius_ as short as possible. This  roused his lordship from the drowsiness into which he had been lulled.  \"Unyus! Mr. ----? We always pronounced that _unius_ at school.\"--\"Oh  yes, my lord,\" replied the counsel; \"but some of the poets use it short  for the sake of the metre.\"--\"You forget, Mr. ----,\" rejoined the  judge, \"that we are prosing here.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Mr. Justice Willes was a judge of kindly disposition, and when he had to  convey a rebuke he did so in some delicate and refined way like this.
