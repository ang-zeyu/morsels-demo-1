Her voice rang with authority. Under her  steady glance the Chinaman's furtive eyes bushed themselves in his  customary pose of irreproachable meekness.    \"You are the eyes and ears of Ah Sing in Bulungan,\" Koyala reaffirmed,  speaking deliberately and with emphasis. \"You know that there is a  covenant between your master, your master in Batavia, and the council of  the _orang kayas_ of the sea Dyaks of Bulungan, whereby the children of  the sea sail in the proas of Ah Sing when the _Hanu Token_ come to  Koyala on the night winds and tell her to bid them go.\"    The Chinaman glanced anxiously about the jungle, fearful that a swaying  cluster of cane might reveal the presence of an eavesdropper.    \"S-ss-st,\" he hissed.    Koyala's voice hardened. \"Tell your master this,\" she said. \"The spirits  of the highlands speak no more through the mouth of the Bintang Burung  till the eyes and ears of Ah Sing become her eyes and ears, too.\"    There was a significant pause. Cho Seng's face shifted and he looked at  her slantwise to see how seriously he should take the declaration. What  he saw undoubtedly impressed him with the need of promptly placating  her, for he announced:    \"Cho Seng tellee Mynheer Muller Koyala go hide in bush--big _baas_ in  Batavia say muchee damn-damn, give muchee gold for Koyala.\"    The displeasure in Koyala's flushed face mounted to anger.    \"No, you cannot take credit for that, Cho Seng,\" she exclaimed sharply.  \"Word came to Mynheer Muller from the governor direct that a price of  many guilders was put on my head.\"    Her chin tilted scornfully. \"Did you think Koyala was so blind that she  did not see the gun-boat in Bulungan harbor a week ago to-day?\"    Cho Seng met her heat with Oriental calm.    \"Bang-bang boat, him come six-seven day ago,\" he declared. \"Cho Seng,  him speakee Mynheer Muller Koyala go hide in bush eight-nine day.\"    \"The gun-boat was in the harbor the morning Mynheer Muller told me,\"  Koyala retorted, and stopped in sudden recollection. A tiny flash of  triumph lit the Chinaman's otherwise impassive face as he put her  unspoken thought into words:    \"_Kapitein_ him bang-bang boat come see Mynheer Muller _namiddag_,\"  (afternoon) he said, indicating the sun's position an hour before  sunset. \"Mynheer Muller tellee Koyala _voormiddag_\" (forenoon). He  pointed to the sun's morning position in the eastern sky.    \"That is true,\" Koyala assented thoughtfully, and paused. \"How did you  hear of it?\"    Cho Seng tucked his hands inside his sleeves and folded them over his  paunch. His neck was bent forward and his eyes lowered humbly. Koyala  knew what the pose portended; it was the Chinaman's refuge in a silence  that neither plea nor threat could break. She rapidly recalled the  events of that week.    \"There was a junk from Macassar in Bulungan harbor two weeks--no, eleven  days ago,\" she exclaimed. \"Did that bring a message from Ah Sing?\"    A startled lift of the Chinaman's chin assured her that her guess was  correct. Another thought followed swift on the heels of the first.    \"The same junk is in the harbor to-day--came here just before sundown  last night,\" she exclaimed. \"What message did it bring, Cho Seng?\"    The Chinaman's face was like a mask. His lips were compressed  tightly--it was as though he defied her to wedge them open and to force  him to reveal his secret. An angry sparkle lit Koyala's eyes for a  moment, she stepped a pace toward him and her hand dropped to the hilt  of the jeweled kris, then she stopped short. A fleeting look of cunning  replaced the angry gleam; a half-smile came and vanished on her lips  almost in the same instant.    Her face lifted suddenly toward the leafy canopy. Her arms were flung  upward in a supplicating gesture. The Chinaman, watching her from  beneath his lowered brow, looked up in startled surprise. Koyala's form  became rigid, a Galatea turned back to marble. Her breath seemed to  cease, as though she was in a trance. The color left her face, left even  her lips. Strangely enough, her very paleness made the Dyak umber in her  cheeks more pronounced.    Her lips parted. A low crooning came forth. The Chinaman's knees quaked  and gave way as he heard the sound. His body bent from the waist till  his head almost touched the ground.    The crooning gradually took the form of words. It was the Malay tongue  she spoke--a language Cho Seng knew. The rhythmic beating of his head  against his knees ceased and he listened eagerly, with face half-lifted.    \"_Hanu Token, Hanu Token_, spirits of the highlands, whither are you  taking me?\" Koyala cried. She paused, and a deathlike silence followed.  Suddenly she began speaking again, her figure swaying like a tall lily  stalk in a spring breeze, her voice low-pitched and musically mystic  like the voice of one speaking from a far distance.    \"I see the jungle, the jungle where the mother of rivers gushes out of  the great smoking mountain. I see the pit of serpents in the jungle--\"    A trembling seized Cho Seng.    \"The serpents are hungry, they have not been fed, they clamor for the  blood of a man. I see him whose foot is over the edge of the pit, he  slips, he falls, he tries to catch himself, but the bamboo slips out of  his clutching fingers--I see his face--it is the face of him whose  tongue speaks double, it is the face of--\"    A horrible groan burst from the Chinaman. He staggered to his feet.    \"_Neen, neen, neen, neen_,\" he cried hoarsely in an agonized negative.  \"Cho Seng tellee Bintang Burung--\"    A tremulous sigh escaped from Koyala's lips. Her body shook as though  swayed by the wind. Her eyes opened slowly, vacantly, as though she was  awakening from a deep sleep. She looked at Cho Seng with an absent  stare, seeming to wonder why he was there, why she was where she was.  The Chinaman, made voluble through fear, chattered:    \"Him junk say big _baas gouverneur_ speakee muchee damn-damn; no gambir,  no rice, no copra, no coffee from Bulungan one-two year; sendee new  resident bimeby belly quick.\"    Koyala's face paled.    \"Send a new resident?\" she asked incredulously. \"What of Mynheer  Muller?\"    The look of fear left Cho Seng's face. Involuntarily his neck bent and  his fingers sought each other inside the sleeves. There was cunning  mingled with malice in his eyes as he looked up furtively and feasted on  her manifest distress.    \"Him chop-chop,\" he announced laconically.    \"They will kill him?\" Koyala cried.    The Chinaman had said his word. None knew better than he the value of  silence. He stood before her in all humbleness and calmly awaited her  next word. All the while his eyes played on her in quick, cleverly  concealed glances.    Koyala fingered the handle of the kris as she considered what the news  portended. Her face slowly hardened--there was a look in it of the  tigress brought to bay.    \"Koyala bimeby mally him--Mynheer Muller, go hide in bush?\" Cho Seng  ventured. The question was asked with such an air of simple innocence  and friendly interest that none could take offense.    Koyala flushed hotly. Then her nose and chin rose high with pride.    \"The Bintang Burung will wed no man, Cho Seng,\" she declared haughtily.  \"The blood of Chawatangi dies in me, but not till Bulungan is purged of  the _orang blanda_\" (white race). She whipped the jeweled kris out of  its silken scabbard. \"When the last white man spills his heart on the  coral shore and the wrongs done Chawatangi's daughter, my mother, have  been avenged, then Koyala will go to join the _Hanu Token_ that call  her, call her--\"    She thrust the point of the kris against her breast and looked upward  toward the far-distant hills and the smoking mountain. A look of longing  came into her eyes, the light of great desire, almost it seemed as if  she would drive the blade home and join the spirits she invoked.    With a sigh she lowered the point of the kris and slipped it back into  its sheath.    \"No, Cho Seng,\" she said, \"Mynheer Muller is nothing to me. No man will  ever be anything to me. But your master has been a kind elder brother to  Koyala. And like me, he has had to endure the shame of an unhappy  birth.\" Her voice sank to a whisper. \"For his mother, Cho Seng, as you  know, was a woman of Celebes.\"    She turned swiftly away that he might not see her face. After a moment  she said in a voice warm with womanly kindness and sympathy:    \"Therefore you and I must take care of him, Cho Seng. He is weak, he is  untruthful, he has made a wicked bargain with your master, Ah Sing,  which the spirits of the hills tell me he shall suffer for, but he is  only what his white father made him, and the _orang blanda_ must pay!\"  Her lips contracted grimly. \"Ay, pay to the last drop of blood! You will  be true to him, Cho Seng?\"    The Chinaman cast a furtive glance upward and found her mellow  dark-brown eyes looking at him earnestly. The eyes seemed to search his  very soul.    \"_Ja, ja_,\" he pledged.    \"Then go, tell the captain of the junk to sail quickly to Macassar and  send word by a swift messenger to Ah Sing that he must let me know the  moment a new resident is appointed. There is no wind and the sun is  high; therefore the junk will still be in the harbor. Hurry, Cho Seng!\"    Without a word the Chinaman wheeled and shuffled down the woodland path  that led from the clearing toward the main highway. Koyala looked after  him fixedly.    \"If his skin were white he could not be more false,\" she observed  bitterly. \"But he is Ah Sing's slave, and Ah Sing needs me, so I need  not fear him--yet.\"    She followed lightly after Cho Seng until she could see the prim top of  the residency building gleaming white through the trees.

Clovis  afterwards conquered all the other Frankish chiefs and made himself  king of all the Franks.    III    Not very long after Clovis became king he heard of a beautiful  young girl, the niece of Gon'de-baud, king of Burgundy, and he  thought he would like to marry her. Her name was Clo-tilde', and  she was an orphan, for her wicked uncle Gondebaud had killed her  father and mother. Clovis sent one of his nobles to Gondebaud to  ask her for his wife. At first Gondebaud thought of refusing to  let the girl go. He feared that she might have him punished for  the murder of her parents if she became the wife of so powerful  a man as Clovis. But he was also afraid that by refusing he would  provoke the anger of Clovis; so he permitted the girl to be taken  to the court of the king of the Franks. Clovis was delighted when  he saw her; and they were immediately married.    Clotilde was a devout Christian, and she wished very much to convert  her husband, who, like most of his people, was a worshiper of the  heathen gods. But Clovis was not willing to give up his own religion.  Nevertheless Clotilde continued to do every thing she could to  persuade him to become a Christian.    [Illustration: CROSSING THE RHINE]    Soon after his marriage Clovis had a war with a tribe called the  Alemanni. This tribe had crossed the Rhine from Germany and taken  possession of some of the eastern provinces of Gaul. Clovis speedily  got his warriors together and marched against them. A battle was  fought at a place called Tolbiac, not far from the present city  of Cologne. In this battle the Franks were nearly beaten, for the  Alemanni were fierce and brave men and skillful fighters. When  Clovis saw his soldiers driven back several times he began to lose  hope, but at that moment he thought of his pious wife and of the  powerful God of whom she had so often spoken. Then he raised his  hands to heaven and earnestly prayed to that God.    \"O God of Clotilde,\" he cried, \"help me in this my hour of need.  If thou wilt give me victory now I will believe in thee.\"    Almost immediately the course of the battle began to change in  favor of the Franks. Clovis led his warriors forward once more,  and this time the Alemanni fled before them in terror. The Franks  gained a great victory, and they believed it was in answer to the  prayer of their king.    When Clovis returned home he did not forget his promise. He told  Clotilde how he had prayed to her God for help and how his prayer  had been heard, and he said he was now ready to become a Christian.  Clotilde was very happy on hearing this, and she arranged that her  husband should be baptized in the church of Rheims on the following  Christmas day.    Meanwhile Clovis issued a proclamation to his people declaring  that he was a believer in Christ, and giving orders that all the  images and temples of the heathen gods should be destroyed. This  was immediately done, and many of the people followed his example  and became Christians.    [Illustration: THE BAPTISM OF CLOVIS]    Clovis was a very earnest and fervent convert. One day the bishop  of Rheims, while instructing him in the doctrines of Christianity,  described the death of Christ. As the bishop proceeded Clovis became  much excited, and at last jumped up from his seat and exclaimed:    \"Had I been there with my brave Franks I would have avenged His  wrongs.\"    On Christmas day a great multitude assembled in the church at Rheims  to witness the baptism of the king. A large number of his fierce  warriors were baptized at the same time. The service was performed  with great ceremony by the bishop of Rheims, and the title of \"Most  Christian King\" was conferred on Clovis by the Pope. This title  was ever afterwards borne by the kings of France.    Like most of the kings and chiefs of those rude and barbarous times,  Clovis often did cruel and wicked things. When Rheims was captured,  before he became a Christian, a golden vase was taken by some soldiers  from the church. The bishop asked Clovis to have it returned, and  Clovis bade him wait until the division of spoils. All the valuable  things taken by soldiers in war were divided among the whole army,  each man getting his share according to rank. Such things were  called spoils.    [Illustration: CLOVIS FINDS FAULT WITH THE SOLDIER]    When the next time came for dividing spoils Clovis asked that he  might have the vase over and above his regular share, his intention  being to return it to the bishop. But one of the soldiers objected,  saying that the king should have no more than his fair share, and  at the same time shattered the vase with his ax. Clovis was very  angry, but at the time said nothing. Soon afterwards, however,  there was the usual examination of the arms of the soldiers to  see that they were in proper condition for active service. Clovis  himself took part in the examination, and when he came to the soldier  who had broken the vase he found fault with the condition of his  weapons and with one blow of his battle-ax struck the man dead.    IV    The next war that Clovis engaged in was with some tribes of the  Goths who occupied the country called Aquitaine lying south of the  River Loire. He defeated them and added Aquitaine to the kingdom  of the Franks.    Clovis afterwards made war upon other people of Gaul and defeated  them. At last all the provinces from the lower Rhine to the Pyrenees  Mountains were compelled to acknowledge him as king. He then went  to reside at the city of Paris, which he made the capital of his  kingdom. He died there A.D. 511.    The dynasty or family of kings to which he belonged is known in  history as the Merovingian dynasty. It was so called from Me-ro-vae'us,  the father of Childeric and grandfather of Clovis.          JUSTINIAN THE GREAT    EMPEROR FROM 527-565 A.D.    I    In the time of Clovis the country now called Bulgaria was inhabited  by Goths. One day a poor shepherd boy, about sixteen years of age,  left his mountain home in that country to go to the city of  Constantinople, which was many miles away. The boy had no money  to pay the expenses of the journey, but he was determined to go,  even though he should have to walk every step of the road and live  on fruits that he could gather by the way. He was a bright, clever  boy who had spent his life hitherto in a village, but was now eager  to go out into the world to seek his fortune.    Some years before, this boy's uncle, who was named Justin, had  gone to Constantinople and joined the Roman army. He was so brave  and so good a soldier that he soon came to be commander of the  imperial guard which attended the emperor.    The poor shepherd boy had heard of the success of his uncle, and  this was the reason why he resolved to set off for the big city. So  he started down the mountain and trudged along the valley in high  hope, feeling certain that he would reach the end of his journey  in safety. It was a difficult and dangerous journey, and it took  him several weeks, for he had to go through dark forests and to  cross rivers and high hills; but at last one afternoon in midsummer  he walked through the main gate of Constantinople, proud and happy  that he had accomplished his purpose.    He had no trouble in finding his Uncle Justin; for everybody in  Constantinople knew the commander of the emperor's guards. And  when the boy appeared at the great man's house and told who he  was, his uncle received him with much kindness. He took him into  his own family, and gave him the best education that could be had  in the city.    As the boy was very talented and eager for knowledge he soon became  an excellent scholar. He grew up a tall, good-looking man, with  black eyes and curly hair, and he was always richly dressed. He was  well liked at the emperor's court, and was respected by everybody  on account of his learning.    II    One day a great change came for both uncle and nephew. The emperor  died; and the people chose Justin to succeed him. He took the title  of Jus-ti'nus I, and so the young scholar, who had once been a  poor shepherd boy, was now nephew of an emperor.    [Illustration: THE COURT OF JUSTINIAN THE GREAT]    After some years Justinus was advised by his nobles to take the  young man, who had adopted the name of Justinian, to help him in  ruling the empire. Justinus agreed to this proposal, for he was  now old and in feeble health, and not able himself to attend to  the important affairs of government. He therefore called the great  lords of his court together and in their presence he placed a crown  on the head of his nephew, who thus became joint emperor with his  uncle. The uncle died only a few months after, and then Justinian  was declared emperor. This was in the year 527. Justinian reigned  for nearly forty years and did so many important things that he  was afterwards called Justinian the Great.    He had many wars during his reign, but he himself did not take  part in them. He was not experienced as a soldier, for he had spent  most of his time in study. He was fortunate enough, however, to  have two great generals to lead his armies. One of them was named  Belisarius and the other Narses.    Belisarius was one of the greatest soldiers that ever lived. He  gained wonderful victories for Justinian, and conquered some of  the old Roman provinces that had been lost for many years.    The victories of these two generals largely helped to make the  reign of Justinian remarkable in history. Many years before he  ascended the throne the Vandals, as you have read, conquered the  northern part of Africa and established a kingdom there with Carthage  as its capital. The Vandal king in the time of Justinian was named  Gel'i-mer, and he lived in Carthage.    Justinian resolved to make war on this king in order to recover  Northern Africa and make it again a part of the Empire. So Belisarius  was sent to Africa with an army of thirty-five "]]]
