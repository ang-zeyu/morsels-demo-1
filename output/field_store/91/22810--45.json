Midsummer came, and the shallows were almost choked with weeds. The  countryside experienced a phenomenal period of drought, and for weeks  the river seemed impure and almost fetid. Night after night, and  steadily travelling westward, Lutra took short cuts across country from  pool to pool. Late in July she reached the estuary of the river; and for  the remaining months of summer fished in the bay, finding there a  pleasant change in her surroundings. Once she was chased by some men in  a boat, who shot at her as she appeared for an instant to breathe. Quick  and watchful, she dived at the flash, and the pellets fell harmlessly  overhead. Again she rose, and again she dived just in time to avoid the  leaden hail. Then she doubled back towards the estuary, and the baffled  sportsmen sailed away across the bay. As autumn came once more she  returned to the river, and fed chiefly on the migrating eels that  swarmed in the hollows near the bank. Presently, by many a nightly  journey, she gained the upper reaches, where she lived, till the  following spring, close to her old home.    The winter was long and severe. In January, the fields were buried in  snow, the roads were as smooth and hard as glass, and the  well-remembered pool beneath the pines was almost covered with a great  sheet of ice. At this time another young dog-otter began to show Lutra  considerable attention. The village children often saw the pairing  otters, for the animals, hard pressed, had perforce to fish by day  instead of by night. All night the trout lay dormant under the stones in  the bed of the river, and only at noon did they rise to the surface on  the lookout for hardy ephemerals that, in a short half hour of warmth,  were hatched at the margin of the stream. Lutra and her companion  followed the fish, and afforded a rare, unexpected sight as, bold with  hunger, they ascended to breathe between the sheets of ice in the pool  by the village gardens. At night the otters wandered over the snow, and  sometimes visited the hillside farms. There, among rotting refuse-heaps,  they discovered worms and insects sheltering in genial warmth. When  exceptionally hungry, Lutra and her mate would dig into the chambers of  the mole and the field-vole in the meadows, and search ravenously for  the inmates. Among the roots of the spreading oaks, the otters found,  also, such tit-bits as the larvae of moths and beetles. A starved pigeon  fallen from the pine-boughs; an occasional moorhen weak and almost  defenceless; a wild duck that Lutra had captured by darting from beneath  a root while the indiscreet bird was feeding, head downwards, at the  river's brink--these were among the varied items of the hungry otters'  food. Life was indeed hard to maintain. And, to crown the misfortunes of  the ice-bound winter, Lutra's matrimonial affairs were once more cruelly  disturbed: her mate was caught in a steel trap that Ned the blacksmith  had baited and laid in the meadows near the village bridge. He had  marked the otters' wanderings by their footprints in the snow, and had  then matured his plans.    The calamity occurred one morning, just before daybreak, as the otters  were returning to the river from a visit to a hen-coop, where they had  found an open door and a solitary chicken. The trap was placed on the  grass by the verge of the stream. A light fall of snow had covered it,  but had left exposed the entrails of a chicken which, by coincidence,  formed the tempting bait. Distressed and perplexed, Lutra stayed by the  dog-otter, trying in vain to release him from his sufferings. The  trapped creature, beside himself with rage and fear and pain, attempted  to gnaw through his crunched and almost severed foot; but as the dawn  lightened the east, and before the limb could be freed, Ned the  blacksmith was to be seen hurrying to the spot. Lutra dived out of  sight, and, unable to interpose, watched, for a second time, a riverside  tragedy. Her attachment, however, had not been of so ardent a nature  that bereavement left her disconsolate. Before April she forgot her  trapped friend, and was mated again.    Lutra's new spouse had his home in the tributary stream of a  neighbouring valley. So, when the snows had melted and the rime no  longer touched with fairy fingerprints the tracery of the leafless  boughs, and when Olwen the White-footed had come once more into the  valley called after her name, Lutra forsook the broad river in which she  had spent her early life, and, with her companion and a promising  family, lived contented under the frowning Rock of Gwion, secure in  peace and solitude, at least for a season, from the shaggy  otter-hounds.          THE WATER-VOLE.    I.    OUR VILLAGE HOUNDS.      Not many years ago the pleasures of life among my neighbours here in the  country were simpler and truer than they are to-day. Perhaps in that  bygone time money was more easily made, or daily need was met with  smaller expenditure. It may be, too, that family cares were then less  pressing, or that a prolonged period of general prosperity had been the  privilege of rich and poor alike in this green river-valley around my  home. In those days, to which I often look back with regretful yearning,  everybody seemed to have leisure; the ties of friendship were not  severed by malicious gossip; old and young seemed to realise how good it  was to have pleasant acquaintanceships and to be in the sunshine and the  open air. Fathers played with their children in the street: one winter  morning, when, after a heavy fall of snow and a subsequent frost, the  ground was as slippery as glass, I watched a white-haired shopkeeper,  lying prone on a home-made toboggan, with his feet sprawling behind for  rudder, steer a load of merry youngsters full tilt down a steep lane  behind his house. The sight was so exhilarating that I also forgot I was  not a child; and on the second journey I joined the sportive party, and  came to grief because the shopkeeper kicked too quickly at a turn in the  course and sent me with a double somersault into the ditch.    It happened in those days that in the miscellaneous pack of mongrels our  village sportsmen gathered together when they went rabbit-shooting among  the dense coverts of the hillsides were two exceptionally clever dogs--a  big, shaggy, bobtail kind of animal, and a little, smooth-coated beast  resembling a black-and-tan terrier.    The big dog, Joker, lived at a farm in the village, and, during the  leisure of summer, when rabbiting did not engage his attention, took to  wandering by the river, joining the bathers in their sport and poking  his nose inquisitively under the alder-roots along the bank. While, one  sultry noon, the fun in the bathing pool was at its height, Joker routed  an otter from a hiding place near which the bathers were swimming with  the current, and a terrific fight took place in the shallows before the  _dwrgu_ made good his escape. The dog was found to have been severely  worsted in the fray, and was taken home to be nursed till his wounds  were healed. Meanwhile, Joker's fame as an otter-hound was firmly  established in the village, and he was regarded as a hero.    The little dog, Bob, lived at the inn, and for years his droll ways  endeared him to every villager, as well as to every angler who came to  \"the house\" for salmon-fishing. He loved nothing better than a  friendship with some unsuspecting fisherman whom he might afterwards use  to further his own ends. The sight of a rod placed by the door in the  early morning was sufficient promise of a day's continuous enjoyment;  the terrier assumed possession of the rod at once, and kept all other  curs at a distance. On the appearance of the sportsman, he manifested  such unmistakable delight, and pleaded so hard for permission to  follow, that, unless the sportsman happened to be one whose experiences  led him to dislike the presence of a fussy dog by the riverside, the  flattery rarely failed of its object. Once past the rustic swing-bridge  at the lower boundary of the waters belonging to the inn, Bob left the  sportsman to his own devices, and stole off into the woods to hunt  rabbits. Unfailingly, however, he rejoined his friend at lunch.    On Sundays, knowing that the report of a gun was not likely then to  resound among the woods, and depressed by the quietness and disappointed  by the nervous manner with which everybody well dressed for church  resented his familiarities, he lingered about the street corners--as the  unemployed usually do, even in our village--till the delicious smells of  Sunday dinners pervaded the street. The savoury odours in no way  sharpened his appetite, for at the inn his fare was always of the best;  but they indicated that the time was approaching when the watchmaker and  the lawyer set out together for their long weekly ramble through the  woods. Bob knew what such a ramble meant for him. The watchmaker's dog,  Tip, was Bob's respected sire, and Tip's brother, Charlie, dwelt at a  house in \"The Square.\" Bob, scenting the Sunday dinners, went at once to  call for Charlie, and in his company adjourned to the lane behind the  village gardens, till the watchmaker and the lawyer, with Tip, were  ready for their customary walk.    When the water was low and anglers seldom visited the inn, Bob, during  the summer week-days, followed Joker's course of action, and attached  himself to a bathing party frequenting a pool below the ruined garden on  the outskirts of the village. There, like Joker, he searched beneath the  alder-roots, but without success as far as an otter was concerned.  However, he vastly enjoyed himself digging out the brown rats from their  holes along the bank not far from a rick-yard belonging to the inn, and  then hunting them about the pool with as much noise and bustle as if he  were close at the tail of a rabbit in the furze."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29362"],[0,"The Goat-gland Transplantation (#7)"],[1,"in the tiny  village of Milford. If freedom from observation is the wish it is  certainly gratified there. Agreeing, therefore, on the whole, with the  reticence of the public man in this matter, we yet feel a certain  satisfaction in the robust avowals of Mr. Ernst. Follows his letter of  January, 1921:    \"I am 77 years old, employed as commercial salesman by one of the  largest manufacturing companies of its kind in the world, and command a  good salary and the confidence of my employers. Since my operation at  Dr. Brinkley's hospital I am now their free lance salesman, opening up  new territory and making good money. Any doubting Thomas may send me a  self-addressed envelope if he questions the genuineness of what I say  here about myself, and I will take time to answer him. First, the  operation is absolutely painless. For a number of years I was a martyr  to Sciatica and Muscular Rheumatism. I used every Patent Medicine I  could hear of, besides Osteopathy and Chiropractic, and innumerable  prescriptions from physicians, and received no benefit at all. The  sciatic trouble was bad enough, but to this you must add loss of memory,  hydrocele, kidney trouble, constipation, no appetite, and insomnia. Most  nights two hours sleep was the most I could get, for the pains were  incessant. I read in ... the +Kansas City Post+ last Spring about Dr.  Brinkley's Goat-Gland operation, and decided to try it right away. I was  in such misery I would have tried +anything+. Now I want to tell you, in  the fewest words, that the amazing truth is that I have not had a twinge  of pain of any kind at all since the operation, and have only a memory  of my former suffering. This is a marvelous thing. I have the feeling of  a youth. Whenever you want to hear from me I will write again and tell  you what changes have taken place in me as the result of this operation.  If I was asked to put a cash value upon the operation in my own case I  could not do it, but I can say that all I possess in cash would be a  poor equivalent for the difference the operation has made in my life.  What is the difference in cash value between a life that is worth living  and one that is constant misery? I don't know how you would fix that  value, but that is the difference the operation has made in me.      S. H. ERNST.\"    Dr. Brinkley has kept in close touch with Mr. Ernst, and received other  letters, not for publication, in which the old gentleman went frankly  into details of the change that had been wrought in him by the operation  in the matter of astonishing sexual vigor. For obvious reasons such  details, while of the greatest scientific interest, cannot be more than  hinted at in a book, and we must content ourselves with the acceptance  of the fact as a fact of interest to science, to Dr. Brinkley, to the  world of aged men at our doors, and to Mr. Ernst particularly, rejoicing  in his new-found vigor.    Apart from the genuinely happy tone of his letters to Dr. Brinkley, the  phenomenon of the darkening of the hair strikes most sharply on the  attention. Perhaps our satisfaction in this particular piece of evidence  of rejuvenation is due to the fact that it is an objective proof;  something visible to the eye, tangible; something for which we are not  required to take anybody's opinion, but can trust our eyesight for the  fact of it. It is something in which the psychic factor, the feelings,  the imagination, the auto-suggestion, does not enter at all, and that is  why it is exceedingly well worthy of note. Looking back over the years,  and casting up in your minds all the people of sixty and seventy years  of age whom you have known, can you put your finger on a single one  whose hair turned in color from white to dark and at the same time from  thin to thick? You probably cannot. Nor can the writer. It is reasonable  to conclude, therefore, that the goat-glands alone have done this thing  in the case of Mr. Ernst.          CHAPTER VI    THE STORY OF CHANCELLOR TOBIAS      We must go to the pages of +The Chicago Evening American+ of date August  18, 1920, for the story of Chancellor Tobias, written by Lloyd Lehrbas,  of the American staff, with a brief introductory note, as follows:    (Here is one of the most remarkable news stories ever published in any  Chicago newspaper. So startling is its detail that +The Chicago Evening  American+ in the interest of absolute accuracy submitted it to the  person most concerned for his approval, so there can be no question  concerning the facts, scientific or otherwise. Other men and women  involved are not mentioned because the facts being established in the  most important case, it is not considered necessary.)    Goat interstitial gland operations have been successfully performed on  J. J. Tobias, Chancellor of the Chicago Law School, and thirty-five  other Chicago men and women by Dr. J. R. Brinkley, of Milford, Kansas,  who has been in Chicago for the past six weeks, performing the  operations every day.    [Illustration: THE BRINKLEY HOSPITAL, MILFORD, KANSAS, U.S.A.]    An alderman, a well-known political figure, living on the Gold Coast,  a judge, a prominent real estate man, a newspaper man, three women, one  of whom is well known on the North Shore, and other Chicagoans, have  found the lost Fountain of Youth as a result of the miracle-surgeon's  transplanting the revivifying interstitial glands of a goat into their  human bodies.    The story of Dr. Brinkley's knife magic is the story of a surgeon's  study and experimenting for nine years, ending with the successful  accomplishment of the gland operation performed on thirty-six  Chicagoans, who are alive and healthy today.    The complete story, with laboratory data, the name of one of the  prominent patients, and an authorized interview with Dr. Brinkley is  told for the first time in +The Evening American+ today.    +Successful on Women.+ Proof that the operation has been successful on  women as well as men makes the story of increased interest. Until now it  has been the general conception that the operation was successful on men  only. A Chicago woman is now supremely happy because, after years of  hoping, the operation has made it possible for her to become a mother.    Five months ago, Chancellor Tobias was, in his own words, played out.  His years of teaching in the Chicago Law School had reduced his  vitality.    Chancellor Tobias went to Dr. Brinkley's hospital and submitted to the  operation in order to relieve arterial congestion in the brain, caused  by two attacks of influenza, a year apart. So serious had become his  condition and so severe the attacks of vertigo and high blood pressure,  that his attending physician informed him he was in imminent danger of  death. The planting of the interstitial glands in Chancellor Tobias'  body relieved the congestion and fully eliminated the cause.    +Purged of All Ills.+ Today he has dropped the years from his shoulders,  purged his body and brain of ills, and stands revivified.    \"I feel like a youth again,\" the aged chancellor said today. \"I'm a new  man.\"    The stories of the other Chicagoans who have been benefited by the  operation read like fiction. They were ill, they were old, they  apparently were beyond the skill of the surgeon's knife, or spiritual  hope. Now from their own lips come paeans of glorification for restored  vitality and youth, all due to the humble goat and the surgical skill of  a country surgeon.    +Tobias' Own Story.+ Today I called at the law school in the Monadnock  Building to see Chancellor Tobias and get the story from his own lips.  The reports seemed too rosy. The facts seemed overstated. The results  appeared to me unduly magnified. But here was a prominent lawyer who had  the operation performed. Here was assurance there would be no buncombe  from him.    An alert, peppy, gray-haired man sprang up to greet me, his eyes, the  eyes of youth, his step firm and sprightly, his handclasp steady and  strong. And yet he was 71 years old!    \"Do you really feel younger?\"    +Twenty-five Years Younger.+ Chancellor Tobias threw out his chest,  squared his shoulders,--and smiled. \"I feel twenty-five years younger.  I'm a new man, strong, and good for twenty years of work,\" he replied.  \"I was ill, old, and played out, but the operation has completely  revivified me.\"    \"How does it feel to have been old, and then become young again?\"    \"Glorious!\"    +Was \"Played Out.\"+ And here is Chancellor Tobias' story of the fountain  of youth.    \"After teaching for twenty-five years in the Chicago Law School,\" he  said. \"I was played out. I suffered intense headaches. My eyesight began  failing. There was a constant ringing in my ears. Dizziness came with  increasing regularity. Mentally and physically I was an old man. Then I  heard of Dr. Brinkley.\"    Chancellor Tobias went to Milford, Kansas, as a last hope in March of  this year.    On March 26 Dr. Brinkley selected a two months' old goat and removed the  interstitial glands. They were placed in a solution at body heat and  taken to the operating room. Dr. Tobias was given an anesthetic. Dr.  Brinkley leaned over the operating table, made a quick, accurate  incision, planted the goat gland, and fifteen minutes later the  operation was over.    +Eyesight Improves.+ \"Four days after the operation,\" the Chancellor  continued, \"the headaches had disappeared, and my eyesight was greatly  improved. And seven days afterwards, I left the hospital a new man.\"    One month after the operation Chancellor Tobias wrote to Dr. Brinkley:  \"I really feel twenty years younger. My health has improved wonderfully.  I have regained my lost vigor and vitality. I'm a recreated youth.\"    And today even Chancellor Tobias' fellow faculty members, many of them  nationally famous attorneys, admit that Dr. Tobias has improved 100 per  cent.    +\"Almost Unbelievable.\"+ \"I hesitate to speak of this,\" Chancellor  Tobias said. \"I"]]]
