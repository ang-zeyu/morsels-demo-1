QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS.      [Page 31.]    _What do you consider to be mental malpractice? [1]_    Mental malpractice is a bland denial of Truth,  and is the antipode of Christian Science. To  mentally argue in a manner that can disastrously  affect the happiness of a fellow-being--harm him [5]  morally, physically, or spiritually--breaks the Golden  Rule and subverts the scientific laws of being. This,  therefore, is not the use but the abuse of mental treat-  ment, and is mental malpractice. It is needless to  say that such a subversion of right is not scientific. Its [10]  claim to power is in proportion to the faith in evil, and  consequently to the lack of faith in good. Such false  faith finds no place in, and receives no aid from, the  Principle or the rules of Christian Science; for it denies  the grand verity of this Science, namely, that God, good, [15]  has _all_ power.    This leaves the individual no alternative but to re-  linquish his faith in evil, or to argue against his own  convictions of good and so destroy his power to be or  to do good, because he has no faith in the _omnipotence_ [20]  of God, good. He parts with his understanding of good,  in order to retain his faith in evil and so succeed with his    [Page 32.]    wrong argument,--if indeed he desires success in this [1]  broad road to destruction.    _How shall we demean ourselves towards the students_  _of disloyal students? And what about that clergyman's_  _remarks on __\"__Christ and Christmas__\"__?_ [5]    From this question, I infer that some of my students  seem not to know in what manner they should act towards  the students of false teachers, or such as have strayed  from the rules and divine Principle of Christian Science.  The query is abnormal, when \"precept upon precept; [10]  line upon line\" are to be found in the Scriptures, and in  my books, on this very subject.    In Mark, ninth chapter, commencing at the thirty-  third verse, you will find my views on this subject; love  alone is admissible towards friend and foe. My sym- [15]  pathies extend to the above-named class of students more  than to many others. If I had the time to talk with all  students of Christian Science, and correspond with them,  I would gladly do my best towards helping those un-  fortunate seekers after Truth whose teacher is straying [20]  from the straight and narrow path. But I have not mo-  ments enough in which to give to my own flock all the  time and attention that they need,--and charity must  begin at home.    Distinct denominational and social organizations and [25]  societies are at present necessary for the individual,  and for our Cause. But all people can and should be  just, merciful; they should never envy, elbow, slander,  hate, or try to injure, but always should try to bless their  fellow-mortals. [30]    To the query in regard to some clergyman's com-    [Page 33.]    ments on my illustrated poem, I will say: It is the righteous [1]  prayer that avails with God. Whatever is wrong will  receive its own reward. The high priests of old caused  the crucifixion of even the great Master; and thereby  they lost, and he won, heaven. I love all ministers and [5]  ministries of Christ, Truth.    All clergymen may not understand the illustrations  in \"Christ and Christmas;\" or that these refer not to  personality, but present the type and shadow of Truth's  appearing in the womanhood as well as in the manhood [10]  of God, our divine Father and Mother.    _Must I have faith in Christian Science in order to be_  _healed by it?_    This is a question that is being asked every day. It  has not proved impossible to heal those who, when they [15]  began treatment, had no faith whatever in the Science,  --other than to place themselves under my care, and  follow the directions given. Patients naturally gain con-  fidence in Christian Science as they recognize the help  they derive therefrom. [20]    _What are the advantages of your system of healing, over_  _the ordinary methods of healing disease?_    Healing by Christian Science has the following advantages:--    _First_: It does away with all material medicines, and [25]  recognizes the fact that, as mortal mind is the cause of  all \"the ills that flesh is heir to,\" the antidote for sickness,  as well as for sin, may and must be found in mortal mind's  opposite,--the divine Mind.    _Second_: It is more effectual than drugs; curing where [30]    [Page 34.]    these fail, and leaving none of the harmful \"after effects\" [1]  of these in the system; thus proving that metaphysics  is above physics.    _Third:_ One who has been healed by Christian Sci-  ence is not only healed of the disease, but is improved [5]  morally. The body is governed by mind; and mortal  mind must be improved, before the body is renewed  and harmonious,--since the physique is simply thought  made manifest.    _Is spiritualism or mesmerism included in Christian_ [10]  _Science?_    They are wholly apart from it. Christian Science is  based on divine Principle; whereas spiritualism, so far  as I understand it, is a mere speculative opinion and  human belief. If the departed were to communicate [15]  with us, we should see them as they were before death,  and have them with us; after death, they can no more  come to those they have left, than we, in our present state  of existence, can go to the departed or the adult can re-  turn to his boyhood. We may pass on to their state [20]  of existence, but they cannot return to ours. Man is  _im_-mortal, and there is not a moment when he ceases to  exist. All that are called \"communications from spirits,\"  lie within the realm of mortal thought on this present plane  of existence, and are the antipodes of Christian Science; [25]  the immortal and mortal are as direct opposites as light  and darkness.    _Who is the Founder of mental healing?_    The author of \"Science and Health with Key to the  Scriptures,\" who discovered the Science of healing em- [30]    [Page 35.]    bodied in her works. Years of practical proof, through [1]  homoeopathy, revealed to her the fact that Mind, in-  stead of matter, is the Principle of pathology; and  subsequently her recovery, through the supremacy of  Mind over matter, from a severe casualty pronounced [5]  by the physicians incurable, sealed that proof with the  signet of Christian Science. In 1883, a million of peo-  ple acknowledge and attest the blessings of this mental  system of treating disease. Perhaps the following  words of her husband, the late Dr. Asa G. Eddy, [10]  afford the most concise, yet complete, summary of the  matter:--    \"Mrs, Eddy's works are the outgrowths of her life.  I never knew so unselfish an individual.\"    _Will the book Science and Health, that you offer for sale_ [15]  _at three dollars, teach its readers to heal the sick,--or is_  _one obliged to become a student under your personal in-_  _struction? And if one is obliged to study under you, of_  _what benefit is your book?_    Why do we read the Bible, and then go to church to [20]  hear it expounded? Only because both are important.  Why do we read moral science, and then study it at  college?    You are benefited by reading Science and Health, but  it is greatly to your advantage to be taught its Science [25]  by the author of that work, who explains it in detail.    _What is immortal Mind?_    In reply, we refer you to \"Science and Health with  Key to the Scriptures,\"(2) Vol. I. page 14: \"That which    [Page 36.]    is erring, sinful, sick, and dying, termed material or [1]  mortal man, is neither God's man nor Mind; but to be  understood, we shall classify evil and error as mortal  mind, in contradistinction to good and Truth, or the  Mind which is immortal.\" [5]    _Do animals and beasts have a mind?_    Beasts, as well as men, express Mind as their origin;  but they manifest less of Mind. The first and only  cause is the eternal Mind, which is God, and there is  but one God. The ferocious mind seen in the beast is [10]  mortal mind, which is harmful and proceeds not from  God; for His beast is the lion that lieth down with  the lamb. Appetites, passions, anger, revenge, subtlety,  are the animal qualities of sinning mortals; and the  beasts that have these propensities express the lower [15]  qualities of the so-called animal man; in other words,  the nature and quality of mortal mind,--not immortal  Mind.    _What is the distinction between mortal mind and immortal_  _Mind?_ [20]    Mortal mind includes all evil, disease, and death;  also, all beliefs relative to the so-called material laws,  and all material objects, and the law of sin and death.    The Scripture says, \"The carnal mind [in other words,  mortal mind] is enmity against God; for it is not sub- [25]  ject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.\" Mortal  mind is an illusion; as much in our waking moments  as in the dreams of sleep. The belief that intelligence,  Truth, and Love, are in matter and separate from God,  is an error; for there is no intelligent evil, and no power [30]    [Page 37.]    besides God, good. God would not be omnipotent if [1]  there were in reality another mind creating or governing  man or the universe.    Immortal Mind is God; and this Mind is made  manifest in all thoughts and desires that draw man- [5]  kind toward purity, health, holiness, and the spiritual  facts of being.    Jesus recognized this relation so clearly that he said,  \"I and my Father are one.\" In proportion as we oppose  the belief in material sense, in sickness, sin, and death, [10]  and recognize ourselves under the control of God,  spiritual and immortal Mind, shall we go on to leave the  animal for the spiritual, and learn the meaning of those  words of Jesus, \"Go ye into all the world ... heal the  sick.\" [15]    _Can your Science cure intemperance?_    Christian Science lays the axe at the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31469"],[0,"The Shunned House (#7)"],[1,"gas-mask, and six carboys of sulfuric acid, all to  be delivered the next morning at the cellar door of the shunned house in  Benefit Street. After that I tried to sleep; and failing, passed the  hours in reading and in the composition of inane verses to counteract my  mood.    At eleven a. m. the next day I commenced digging. It was sunny weather,  and I was glad of that. I was still alone, for as much as I feared the  unknown horror I sought, there was more fear in the thought of telling  anybody. Later I told Harris only through sheer necessity, and because  he had heard odd tales from old people which disposed him ever so little  toward belief. As I turned up the stinking black earth in front of the  fireplace, my spade causing a viscous yellow ichor to ooze from the  white fungi which it severed, I trembled at the dubious thoughts of what  I might uncover. Some secrets of inner earth are not good for mankind,  and this seemed to me one of them.    My hand shook perceptibly, but still I delved; after a while standing in  the large hole I had made. With the deepening of the hole, which was  about six feet square, the evil smell increased; and I lost all doubt of  my imminent contact with the hellish thing whose emanations had cursed  the house for over a century and a half. I wondered what it would look  like--what its form and substance would be, and how big it might have  waxed through long ages of life-sucking. At length I climbed out of the  hole and dispersed the heaped-up dirt, then arranging the great carboys  of acid around and near two sides, so that when necessary I might empty  them all down the aperture in quick succession. After that I dumped  earth only along the other two sides; working more slowly and donning my  gas-mask as the smell grew. I was nearly unnerved at my proximity to a  nameless thing at the bottom of a pit.    Suddenly my spade struck something softer than earth. I shuddered, and  made a motion as if to climb out of the hole, which was now as deep as  my neck. Then courage returned, and I scraped away more dirt in the  light of the electric torch I had provided. The surface I uncovered was  fishy and glassy--a kind of semi-putrid congealed jelly with suggestions  of translucency. I scraped further, and saw that it had form. There was  a rift where a part of the substance was folded over. The exposed area  was huge and roughly cylindrical; like a mammoth soft blue-white  stovepipe doubled in two, its largest part some two feet in diameter.  Still more I scraped, and then abruptly I leaped out of the hole and  away from the filthy thing; frantically unstopping and tilting the heavy  carboys, and precipitating their corrosive contents one after another  down that charnel gulf and upon the unthinkable abnormality whose titan  _elbow_ I had seen.           *       *       *       *       *    The blinding maelstrom of greenish-yellow vapor which surged  tempestuously up from that hole as the floods of acid descended, will  never leave my memory. All along the hill people tell of the yellow day,  when virulent and horrible fumes arose from the factory waste dumped in  the Providence River, but I know how mistaken they are as to the source.  They tell, too, of the hideous roar which at the same time came from  some disordered water-pipe or gas main underground--but again I could  correct them if I dared. It was unspeakably shocking, and I do not see  how I lived through it. I did faint after emptying the fourth carboy,  which I had to handle after the fumes had begun to penetrate my mask;  but when I recovered I saw that the hole was emitting no fresh vapors.    The two remaining carboys I emptied down without particular result, and  after a time I felt it safe to shovel the earth back into the pit. It  was twilight before I was done, but fear had gone out of the place. The  dampness was less fetid, and all the strange fungi had withered to a  kind of harmless grayish powder which blew ash-like along the floor. One  of earth's nethermost terrors had perished for ever; and if there be a  hell, it had received at last the demon soul of an unhallowed thing. And  as I patted down the last spadeful of mold, I shed the first of the many  tears with which I have paid unaffected tribute to my beloved uncle's  memory.    The next spring no more pale grass and strange weeds came up in the  shunned house's terraced garden, and shortly afterward Carrington Harris  rented the place. It is still spectral, but its strangeness fascinates  me, and I shall find mixed with my relief a queer regret when it is torn  down to make way for a tawdry shop or vulgar apartment building. The  barren old trees in the yard have begun to bear small, sweet apples, and  last year the birds nested in their gnarled boughs.
