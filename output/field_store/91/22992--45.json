Volume 1 (#7)"],[1," that in the presence of a powerful steam-frigate with heavy  guns, or an 11,000-ton ironclad, she would be literally nowhere. She was  one of the last specimens, and a very perfect specimen, too, of the  _wooden_ age. This is the age of iron and steam. One of the largest  vessels of her day, she is now excelled by hundreds employed in ordinary  commerce. The Royal Navy to-day possesses frigates nearly three times her  tonnage, while we have ironclads of five times the same. The monster  _Great Eastern_, which has proved a monstrous mistake, is 22,500 tons.    But size is by no means the only consideration in constructing vessels of  war, and, indeed, there are good reasons to believe that, in the end,  vessels of moderate dimensions will be preferred for most purposes of  actual warfare. Of the advantages of steam-power there can, of course, be  only one opinion; but as regards iron _versus_ oak, there are many points  which may be urged in favour of either, with a preponderance in favour of  the former. A strong iron ship, strange as it may appear, is not more than  half the weight of a wooden vessel of the same size and class. It will, to  the unthinking, seem absurd to say that an iron ship is more buoyant than  one of oak, but the fact is that the proportion of actual weight in iron  and wooden vessels of ordinary construction is about six to twenty. The  iron ship, therefore, stands high out of the water, and to sink it to the  same line will require a greater weight on board. From this fact, and the  actual _thinness_ of its walls, its carrying capacity and stowage are so  much the greater. This, which is a great point in vessels destined for  commerce, would be equally important in war. But these remarks do not  apply to the modern armoured vessel. We have ironclads with plates  eighteen inches and upwards in thickness. What is the consequence? Their  actual weight, with that of the necessary engines and monster guns  employed, is so great that a vast deal of room on board has to be  unemployed. Day by day we hear of fresh experiments in gunnery, which keep  pace with the increased strength of the vessels. The invulnerable of  to-day is the vulnerable of to-morrow, and there are many leading  authorities who believe in a return to a smaller and weaker class of  vessel--provided, however, with all the appliances for great speed and  offensive warfare _at a distance_. Nelson's preference for small,  easily-worked frigates over the great ships of the line is well known, and  were he alive to-day we can well believe that he would prefer a  medium-sized vessel of strong construction, to steam with great speed, and  carrying heavy, but, perhaps, not the heaviest guns, to one of those  modern unwieldy masses of iron, which have had, so far, a most disastrous  history. The former might, so to speak, act while the latter was making up  her mind. Even a Nelson might hesitate to risk a vessel representing six  or seven hundred thousand pounds of the nation's money, in anything short  of an assured success. We have, however, yet to learn the full value and  power of our ironclad fleet. Of its cost there is not a doubt. Some time  ago our leading newspaper estimated the expense of construction and  maintenance of our existing ironclads at L18,000,000. Mr. Reed states that  they have cost the country a million sterling per annum since the first  organisation of the fleet. Warfare will soon become a luxury only for the  richest nations, and, regarding it in this light, perhaps the very men who  are racking their powers of invention to discover terrible engines of war  are the greatest peacemakers, after all. They may succeed in making it an  impossibility.    \"Hereafter, naval powers prepared with the necessary fleet will be able to  transport the base of operations to any point on the enemy's coast, turn  the strongest positions, and baffle the best-arranged combinations. Thanks  to steam, the sea has become a means of communication more certain and  more simple than the land; and fleets will be able to act the part of  movable bases of operations, rendering them very formidable to powers  which, possessing coasts, will not have any navy sufficiently powerful to  cause their being respected.\"(9) So far as navy to navy is concerned, this  is undoubtedly true; yet there is another side to the question. A fort is  sometimes able to inflict far greater damage upon its naval assailants  than the latter can inflict upon it. A single shot may send a ship to the  bottom, whilst the fire from the ship during action is more or less  inaccurate. At Sebastopol, a whole French fleet, firing at ranges of 1,600  to 1,800 yards, failed to make any great impression on a fort close to the  water's edge; while a wretched earthen battery, mounting only five guns,  inflicted terrible losses and injury on four powerful English men-of-war,  actually disabling two of them, without itself losing one man or having a  gun dismounted; while, as has been often calculated, the cost of a single  sloop of war with its equipment will construct a fine fort which will last  almost for ever, while that of two or three line-of-battle ships would  raise a considerable fortress. Whilst the monster ironclad with heavy guns  would deal out death and destruction when surrounded by an enemy's fleet  of lighter iron vessels or wooden ones as strong as was the _Victory_, she  would herself run great risk in approaching closely-fortified harbours and  coasts, where a single shot from a gun heavy enough to pierce her armour  might sink her. Her safety would consist in firing at long ranges and in  steaming backwards and forwards.    The lessons of the Crimean war, as regards the navy, were few, but of the  gravest importance, and they have led to results of which we cannot yet  determine the end. The war opened by a Russian attack on a Turkish  squadron at Sinope, November 20th, 1853.(10) That determined the fact that  a whole fleet might be annihilated in an hour or so by the use of large  shells. No more necessity for grappling and close quarters; the iron age  was full in view, and wooden walls had outlived their usefulness, and must  perish.    But the lesson had to be again impressed, and that upon a large English  and French fleet. Yet, in fairness to our navy, it must be remembered that  the Russians had spent every attention to rendering Sebastopol nearly  impregnable on the sea-side, while a distinguished writer,(11) who was  present throughout the siege, assures us that until the preceding spring  they had been quite indifferent in regard to the strength of the  fortifications on the land-side. And the presence of the allied fleets was  the undeniable cause of one Russian fleet being sunk in the harbour of  Sebastopol, while another dared not venture out, season after season, from  behind stone fortresses in the shallow waters of Cronstadt.(12) A great  naval authority thinks that, while England was, at the time, almost  totally deficient in the class of vessels essential to attacking the  fleets and fortifications of Russia, the fact that the former never dared  \"to accept the challenge of any British squadron, however small, is one  the record of which we certainly may read without shame.\" But of that  period it would be more pleasant to write exultingly than apologetically.    When the Allies had decided to commence the bombardment of Sebastopol, on  October 17th, 1854, it was understood that the fleet should co-operate,  and that the attack should be made by the line-of-battle ships in a  semicircle. They were ready at one p.m. to commence the bombardment. Lyons  brought the _Agamemnon_, followed by half a dozen other vessels, to within  700 yards of Fort Constantine, the others staying at the safer distances  of 1,800 to 2,200 yards. The whole fleet opened with a tremendous roar of  artillery, to which the Russians replied almost as heavily. Fort  Constantine was several times silenced, and greatly damaged; but, on the  other hand, the Russians managed to kill forty-seven and wound 234 men in  the English fleet, and a slightly smaller number in the French. They had  an unpleasant knack of firing red-hot shot in profusion, and of hitting  the vessels even at the distance at which they lay. Several were set on  fire, and two for a time had to retire from the action. These were  practical shots at our wooden walls. This naval attack has been  characterised as \"even a greater failure than that by land\"--meaning, of  course, the first attack.    Here we may for a moment be allowed to digress and remind the reader of  the important part played by red-hot shot at that greatest of all great  sieges--Gibraltar. As each accession to the enemy's force arrived, General  Elliott calmly built more furnaces and more grates for heating his most  effective means of defence. Just as one of their wooden batteries was on  the point of completion, he gave it what was termed at the time a dose of  \"cayenne pepper;\" in other words, with red-hot shot and shells he set it  on fire. When the ordnance portable furnaces for heating shot proved  insufficient to supply the demands of the artillery, he ordered large  bonfires to be kindled, on which the cannon-balls were thrown; and these  supplies were termed by the soldiers \"hot potatoes\" for the enemy. But the  great triumph of red-hot shot was on that memorable 13th of September,  1782, when forty-six sail of the line, and a countless fleet of gun and  mortar boats attacked the fortress. With all these appliances of warfare,  the great confidence of the enemy--or rather, combined enemies--was in their  floating batteries, planned by D'Arcon, an eminent French engineer, and  which had cost a good half million sterling. They were supposed to be  impervious to shells or red-hot shot. After persistently firing at the  fleet, Elliott started the admiral's ship and one of the batteries  commanded by the Prince of Nassau.

Most of the specimens examined were caught in steel traps baited with  remains of small animals (mostly mammals and birds, but one trap was  baited with the head of a black bass). At Villa Mainero five  individuals were caught in one night in five of seven traps scented  with spilogale musk. These traps were set in runways along a thick  thorn-brush fence, which separated a cornfield from thorn-brush desert.  Along the Rio Purificacion 36 kilometers north and 10 kilometers west  of Victoria an opossum was eaten in a trap by a small carnivore,  probably a felid judging from tracks around the trap.    A female with 14 pouch young was taken in June in the Sierra de  Tamaulipas and weighed 1350 grams; a March-taken female with nine small  young in her pouch, from Soto la Marina, weighed 1800 grams. A male  from the Sierra de Tamaulipas also weighed 1800 grams.      =Didelphis marsupialis californica= Bennett         1833. _Didelphis Californica_ Bennett, Proc. Zool. Soc.       London, p. 40, May 17, type locality restricted to Sonora by       Hershkovitz (_infra_).         1951. _Didelphis marsupialis californica_, Hershkovitz       Fieldiana-Zool., Chicago Nat. Hist. Mus., 31(47):548, July       10.         _Distribution in Tamaulipas._--Southeastern part of state,       north at least to Soto la Marina.    In studying Tamaulipan specimens, I was mindful that Hershkovitz  (1951:550) regarded all opossums of this species in Mexico as a single  subspecies, even though J. A. Allen (1901) recognized two subspecies in  the northeastern part of the Republic. According to Allen (p. 172), _D.  m. texensis_ (to which he ascribed a distribution in Texas and  adjoining Tamaulipas) was described as: \"Similar in coloration to _D.  marsupialis_ (_typica_) [_D. m. californica_], but with a relatively  longer tail, longer nasals, usually terminating posteriorly in an acute  angle, instead of being rounded or more or less abruptly truncated on  the posterior border.\" The available material from Tamaulipas can be  divided into two groups on the basis of shape and proportion of the  nasals. In opossums from the southeast the nasals are truncate  posteriorly and average 47.0 (45.1-48.4) per cent of the condylobasal  length, whereas in specimens from elsewhere the nasals are acute  posteriorly and average 50.7 (49.7-51.8) per cent of the condylobasal  length. Tentatively, therefore, I follow Allen in recognizing two  subspecies in northeastern Mexico.    I note no especial difference in length of tail between _texensis_ and  _californica_. Hooper (1951:3) followed Hershkovitz in reporting as  _californica_ a specimen from Rancho del Cielo; to me, specimens from  this area are referable to _texensis_.
