The manners of the rabbit, one would imagine, must be  exceedingly \"upsetting\" to birds of so timorous a disposition. He has  a way, after a quiet interval, of leaping into activity with startling  suddenness, darting violently away as if scared out of his senses; but  his eccentric movements do not in the least alarm his feathered  companions. One evening early in the month of March I witnessed an  amusing scene near Ockley, in Surrey. I was walking towards the  village about half an hour after sunset, when, hearing the loud call  of a partridge, I turned my eyes in the direction of the sound and saw  five birds on a slight eminence nearly in the centre of a small green  field, surrounded by a low thorn hedge. They had come to that spot to  roost; the calling bird was standing erect, and for some time he  continued to call at intervals after the others had settled down at a  distance of one or two yards apart. All at once, while I stood  watching the birds there was a rustling sound in the hedge, and out of  it burst two buck rabbits engaged in a frantic running fight. For some  time they kept near the hedge, but fighting rabbits seldom continue  long on one spot; they are incessantly on the move, although their  movements are chiefly round and round now one way--flight and  pursuit--then, like lightning, the foremost rabbit doubles back and  there is a collision, bitings, and rolling over and over together, and  in an instant they are up again, wide apart, racing like mad.  Gradually they went farther and farther from the hedge; and at length  chance took them to the very spot on which the partridges had settled,  and there for three or four minutes the duel went on. But the birds  refused to be turned out of their quarters. The bird that had called  still remained standing, expectant, with raised head, as if watching  for the appearance of some loiterer, while the others all kept their  places. Their quietude in the midst of that whirlwind of battle was  wonderful to see. Their only movement was when one of the birds was in  a direct line with a flying rabbit, when, if it stayed still, in  another moment it would be struck and perhaps killed by the shock;  then it would leap a few inches aside and immediately settle down  again. In this way every one of the birds had been forced to move  several times before the battle passed on towards the opposite side of  the field and left the covey in peace.    Social animals, Herbert Spencer truly says, \"take pleasure in the  consciousness of one another's company;\" but he appears to limit the  feeling to those of the same herd, or flock, or species. Speaking of  the mental processes of the cow, he tells us just how that large  mammal is impressed by the sight of birds that come near it and pass  across its field of vision; they are regarded in a vague way as mere  shadows, or shadowy objects, flitting or blown about hither and  thither over the grass or through the air. He didn't know a cow's  mind. My conviction is that all animals distinctly see in those of  other species, living, sentient, intelligent beings like themselves;  and that, when birds and mammals meet together, they take pleasure in  the consciousness of one another's presence, in spite of the enormous  difference in size, voice, habits, etc. I believe that this sympathy  exists and is just as strong between a cow and its small volatile  companion, the wagtail, as between a bird and mammal that more nearly  resemble each other in size; for instance, the partridge, or pheasant,  and rabbit.    The only bird with us that appears to have some such feeling of  pleasure in the company of man is the robin. It is not universal, not  even very common, and Macgillivray, in speaking of the confidence in  men of that bird during severe weather, very truly says, \"In ordinary  times he is not perfectly disposed to trust in man.\" Any person can  prove this for himself by going into a garden or shrubbery and  approaching a robin. We see, too, that the bird shows intense anxiety  when its nest is approached by a man; this point, however, need not be  made much of, since all visitors, even its best friends, are unwelcome  to the breeding bird. Still, there is no doubt that the robin is less  distrustful of man than other species, but not surely because this  bird is regarded by most persons with kindly feelings. The curious  point is that the young birds find something in man to attract them.  This is usually seen at the end of summer, when the old birds have  gone into hiding, and it is then surprising to find how many of the  young robins left in possession of the ground appear to take pleasure  in the company of human beings. Often before a person has been many  minutes in a garden strolling about, he will discover that the quiet  little spotted bird is with him, hopping and flying from twig to twig  and occasionally alighting on the ground, keeping company with him,  sometimes sitting quite still a yard from his hand. The gardener is  usually attended by a friendly robin, and when he turns up the soil  the bird will come down close to his feet to pick up the small grubs  and worms. Is it not probable that the tameness of the tame young  robin so frequently met with is, like that of the robin who keeps  company with the gardener or woodman, an acquired habit; that the  young bird has made the discovery that when a person is moving about  among the plants, picking fruit perhaps, lurking insects are disturbed  at the roots and small spiders and caterpillars shaken from the  leaves? We are to the robin what the cow is to the wagtail and the  sheep to the starling--a food finder.    Among the birds of the homestead the swallow is another somewhat  exceptional species in his way of regarding man. He is too much a  creature of the air to take any pleasure in the company of heavy  animals, bound to earth; the distance is too great for sympathy to  exist. When we consider how closely he is bound and how much he is to  us, it is hard to believe that he is wholly unconscious of our  benefits, that when he returns in spring, overflowing with gladness,  to twitter his delightful airy music round the house, he is not  singing to us, glad to see us again after a long absence, to be once  more our welcome guest as in past years. But so it is. When there were  no houses in the land he built his nest in some rocky cavern, where a  she-wolf had her lair, and his life and music were just as joyous as  they are now, and the wolf suckling her cubs on the stony floor  beneath was nothing to him. But if by chance she climbed a little way  up or put her nose too near his nest, his lively twittering quickly  changed to shrill cries of alarm and anger. And we are no more than  the vanished wolf to the swallow, and so long as we refrain from  peeping into his nest and handling his eggs or young, he does not know  us, and is hardly conscious of our existence. All the social feelings  and sympathy of the swallow are for creatures as aerial and  swift-winged as itself--its playmates in the wide fields of air.    Swallows hawking after flies in a village street, where people are  walking about, is a familiar sight, Swifts are just as confident. A  short time ago, while standing in the churchyard at Farnham, in  Surrey, watching a bunch of ten or twelve swifts racing through the  air, I noticed that on each return to the church they followed the  same line, doubling round the tower on the same side, then sweeping  down close to the surface, and mounting again. Going to the spot I put  myself directly in their way--on their race-course as it were, at that  point where it touched the earth; but they did not on that account  vary their route; each time they came back they streamed screaming  past my head so near as almost to brush my face with their wings. But  I was never more struck by the unconcern at the presence of man shown  by these birds--swallows, martins, and swifts--as on one occasion at  Frensham, when the birds were very numerous. This was in the month of  May, about five weeks after I had witnessed the fight between two  rabbits, and the wonderful composure exhibited by a covey of  partridges through it all. It was on a close hot morning, after a  night of rain, when, walking down to Frensham Great Pond, I saw the  birds hawking about near the water. The may-flies were just out, and  in some mysterious way the news had been swiftly carried all over the  surrounding country. So great was the number of birds that the entire  population of swallows, house- and sand-martins, and swifts, must have  been gathered at that spot from the villages, farms, and sand-banks  for several miles around. At the side of the pond I was approaching  there is a green strip about a hundred and twenty or a hundred and  thirty yards in length and forty or fifty yards wide, and over this  ground from end to end the birds were smoothly and swiftly gliding  backwards and forwards. The whole place seemed alive with them.  Hurrying to the spot I met with a little adventure which it may not be  inapt to relate. Walking on through some scattered furze-bushes,  gazing intently ahead at the swallows, I almost knocked my foot  against a hen pheasant covering her young chicks on the bare ground  beside a dwarf bush. Catching sight of her just in time I started  back; then, with my feet about a yard from the bird, I stood and  regarded her for some time. Not the slightest movement did she make;  she was like a bird carved out of some beautifully variegated and  highly-polished stone, but her bright round eyes had a wonderfully  alert and wild expression. With all her stillness the poor bird must  have been in an agony of terror and suspense, and I wondered how long  she would endure the tension. She stood it for about fifty seconds,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37809"],[0,"A Taxonomic Revision of the Leptodactylid Frog Genus Syrrhophus Cope (#7)"],[1,"co, 250 m., collected on March 13,  1949, by Paul S.

The variation in proportions is summarized in Table 5.    _Remarks._--Martin (1958) expressed some doubt that this series of 26  specimens was identical with \"_S. latodactylus_.\" My study indicates  that the specimens from El Pachon represent a distinctive but allied  species. Males of the two species can be readily separated by the  relative sizes of the tympani, presence or absence of vocal slits, and  color pattern. Females of the two species can be separated by color  pattern. Within the type-series, the pattern varies from weakly to  strongly vermiculate but is always recognizable as vermiculate rather  than spotted as in _S. longipes_ (= _S. latodactylus_ of Taylor and  Martin).

Gorham, 1966:165.    _Diagnosis._--Large frogs, males 22.1-33.2 mm. snout-vent, females  26.8-39.6 mm. snout-vent length; vocal slits lacking in males; digital  tips greatly expanded (more than twice the width of digit); first finger  shorter than second; skin of dorsum pustular, that of venter smooth;  diameter of tympanum in males 61.1-87.2 per cent that of eye, 49.5-72.1  per cent in females; dorsum tan with large or small spots and blotches;  limbs banded; interorbital bar or triangle present.    _Remarks._--I have applied Baird's _Batrachyla longipes_ to the frog  Taylor (1940d) called _Syrrhophus latodactylus_ because the color  pattern (Fig. 13) predominant in the southern part of the range agrees  with that described (figured) for _Batrachyla longipes_.    The color pattern of individuals in the southern part of the range of  this species consists of large spots or blotches, whereas in the  northwestern part the pattern is made up of smaller spots. In the  northeastern part of the range, the pattern is more reduced and tends to  consist of heavy flecking. The interorbital bar is narrower in specimens  from Nuevo Leon and Tamaulipas and is triangular in specimens from  Hidalgo and Queretaro.    The status of the name _Batrachyla longipes_ is currently that of a  _nomen dubium_ (Lynch, 1963). At that time, I was unaware of the  geographic variation in color pattern in _Syrrhophus latodactylus_.    The exact type-locality of _Batrachyla longipes_ is not known. If it is  40 Leagues north of Mexico City, the locality would be in an area where  the species has a blotched instead of a flecked or spotted pattern. No  justifiable evidence was presented to place _Batrachyla longipes_ in  _Eleutherodactylus_ instead of _Syrrhophus_. Barbour (1923) and Kellogg  (1932) associated another species (_E. batrachylus_) with _longipes_.  Taylor (1940a) noted this as a case of misidentification and corrected  the error but left _longipes_ in the genus _Eleutherodactylus_. Lynch  (1963) noted several points of morphological agreement between  _Syrrhophus_ and _B. longipes_ but did not place _longipes_ in  _Syrrhophus_.    Baird's (1859) figures of the holotype do not illustrate prevomerine  teeth, but according to Cope (1866) they were present in the holotype.  The digital tips of the frog in the figure are somewhat narrower than  those typically seen in _S. latodactylus_. If the specimen was slightly  desiccated, as possibly was the case, the digits would appear narrower.  There is no evidence contrary to placing _Syrrhophus latodactylus_ in  the synonymy of _Batrachyla longipes_.        [Illustration: FIG. 13: Dorsal views of _Syrrhophus longipes_         illustrating geographic variation in pattern (left, TCWC 12179,         x1.5; right, KU 92572, x1.8); side of head (TCWC 10966, x6).]    Application of Baird's name _Batrachyla longipes_ to the species of frog  heretofore called _Syrrhophus latodactylus_ poses one serious problem.  _Batrachyla longipes_ is the type-species (by original designation) of  the genus _Epirhexis_ Cope, 1866, which has priority over _Syrrhophus_  Cope, 1878. If _Batrachyla longipes_ is left in the status of a _nomen  dubium_, _Epirhexis_ can be forgotten, for the two names are tied  together. However, since it seems almost certain that _Batrachyla  longipes_ and _Syrrhophus latodactylus_ are conspecific, the former name  should not be left as a _nomen dubium_. _Epirhexis_ never came into  general usage (Cope cited the name four times, but no one else has used  it), whereas _Syrrhophus_ is well established in the zoological  literature. It would serve only to confuse the literature to adhere  strictly to the Law of Priority and replace _Syrrhophus_ with  _Epirhexis_. Therefore, _Syrrhophus_ is used in this paper, even though  _Epirhexis_ has priority. A request for the suppression of _Epirhexis_  Cope, 1866, has been submitted to the International Commission of  Zoological Nomenclature (Lynch, 1967).    _Etymology._--Latin, meaning long-footed; Taylor's _latodactylus_ refers  to the wide digital pads.
