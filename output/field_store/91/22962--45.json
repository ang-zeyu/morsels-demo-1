Soon after our return to headquarters, the survey party arrived  from the interior of the hills, and after a few days' rest, departed  for their summer quarters. Captain Butler then started for England,  and Mr. Needham came in to Samagudting.    Thus left in charge for a considerable period, I felt justified  in doing more than I should have done, had my stay only been of  a temporary nature, and I went most thoroughly into all questions  connected with the hills and their administration. My long experience  in charge of a native state full of wild hill tribes, and my personal  knowledge of many of the Naga and other wild tribes of Assam (a  knowledge that went back as far as 1860), were a great help to me,  as I was consequently not new to the work. The eastern frontier had  always been to my mind the most interesting field of work in India,  and now it was for me to learn all I could.                CHAPTER III.        Historical events connected with Manipur and the Naga      Hills--Different tribes--Their religion--Food and customs.      Shortly after my arrival at Samagudting, I received a cheering letter,  just when I most needed it, from my old friend Wynne, then Acting  Foreign Secretary, saying, \"Don't be too disappointed at not receiving  a better appointment than the Naga Hills. You will have plenty of  good work to do, and you will increase your already very extensive  knowledge of wild tribes.\" It was the last letter I ever received  from him, as cholera quickly carried him off, and I lost in him one  of the kindest friends I ever had, one who had constantly interested  himself in my work, and given me advice. Such a friend would have been  invaluable now. Our position in the Naga Hills was an anxious one, and  can only be properly realised by knowing the course of previous events.    Our first acquaintance with the Nagas practically began in 1832, when  Captain Jenkins and Lieutenant Pemberton escorted by Rajah Ghumbeer  Singh's Manipur troops, forced a passage through the hills with a view  to ascertaining if there were a practicable route into Assam. They  came via Paptongmai and Samagudting to Mohong Deejood. There is every  reason to believe that the Manipuris in former days did penetrate  into the Naga Hills, and exacted tribute when they felt strong enough  to do so. All the villages have Manipur names in addition to their  own. But during the period of her decadence, just before and during  the Burmese War of 1819-25, any influence Manipur may have possessed  fell into abeyance. At that time it was re-asserted, and Ghumbeer Singh  reduced several villages to submission, including the largest of all,  Kohima, at which place he stood upon a stone and had his footprints  sculptured on it, in token of conquest. This was set up in a prominent  position, together with an upright stone bearing carved figures and  an inscription.    The Nagas greatly respected this stone and cleaned it from time to  time. They opened a large trade with Manipur, and whenever a Manipuri  visited a Naga village he was treated as an honoured guest, at a time  when a British subject could not venture into the interior without  risk of being murdered.    Even up to the Naga Hills campaign of 1879-80, the Nagas regarded  Manipur as the greater power of the two, because her conduct was  consistent; if she threatened, she acted. One British subject after  another might be murdered with impunity, but woe betide the village  that murdered a subject of Manipur. A force of Manipuris was instantly  despatched, the village was attacked, destroyed, and ample compensation  exacted. The system answered well for Manipur; many of the Nagas began  to speak Manipuri, and several villages paid an annual tribute. Still,  up to 1851, we considered that we had some shadowy claim to the hills,  though we never openly asserted it.    I may as well give a short account of the different tribes inhabiting  the Naga Hills district when I took charge. The oldest were--        CACHAREES.    Their origin is obscure. They are first met with in the north-east  portion of the Assam Valley between the Muttuk country and Sudya. Round  the last in the vast forests, there are numerous ruins ascribed by the  people to the Cacharee Rajahs, built of substantial brickwork. I have  not seen any sculptured stonework, but it may exist. The traditions  give no clue to their original home, which was probably in Thibet. From  the neighbourhood of Sudya they penetrated down the valley, leaving  buildings and remnants of their tribes here and there, notably in  the Durrung district. The main body were, for a time settled in the  neighbourhood of Dimapur, and the country lying between it and Doboka,  the Cachar district, but when they arrived or how long they stayed we  have no means of ascertaining. They occupied the first two or three  ranges of the Burrails and stoutly contested possession with the  Naga invaders, and after they had been dispossessed made a gallant  attempt to retrieve their affairs by an attack on Sephema. They  entered the hills by the Diphoo gorge and constructed a paved road  up to the neighbourhood of Sephema where they would probably have  succeeded in their operations, but that the Sephema Nagas, skilful  then as now, in the use of poison, poisoned the waters and destroyed  a large portion of the invaders; the rest retreated to Dimapur, and  eventually left the neighbourhood and settled in Cachar, to which they  gave their name. There are still a good many Cacharees on the banks  of the Kopiti, in the neighbourhood of Mohung-dee-jood. They are a  fine hardy race, and in my time the Naga Hills police was largely  recruited from them. Under Captain Butler they did good service,  and would have gone anywhere when led by him. [10] The Cacharees were  governed formerly by a race of despotic chiefs.        KUKIS.    The Kukis are a wandering race consisting of several tribes who  have long been working up from the South. They were first heard  of as Kukis, in Manipur, between 1830 and 1840; though tribes of  the same race had long been subject to the Rajah of Manipur. The  new immigrants began to cause anxiety about the year 1845, and  soon poured into the hill tracts of Manipur in such numbers, as to  drive away many of the older inhabitants. Fortunately, the political  agent (at this time Lieutenant afterwards Colonel McCulloch) [11]  was a man well able to cope with the situation. Cool and resolute,  he at once realised and faced the difficulty. Manipur in those days,  owing to intestine quarrels, could have done nothing, and the Rajah  Nur Singh gladly handed over the management of the new arrivals to him.    Seeing that the Kukis had been driven north by kindred but more  powerful tribes, and that their first object was to secure land for  cultivation; McCulloch, as they arrived, settled them down, allotting  to them lands in different places according to their numbers, and where  their presence would be useful on exposed frontiers. He advanced them  large sums from his own pocket, assigning different duties to each  chief's followers. Some were made into irregular troops, others were  told off to carry loads according to the customs of the state. Thus  in time many thousands of fierce Kukis were settled down as peaceful  subjects of Manipur, and Colonel McCulloch retained supreme control  over them to the last. So great was his influence, that he had only  to send round his silver mounted dao (Burmese sword) as a kind of  fiery cross, when all able-bodied men at once assembled at his summons.    Colonel McCulloch's policy of planting Kuki settlements on exposed  frontiers, induced the Government of Bengal to try a similar  experiment, and a large colony of Kukis were settled in 1855 in  the neighbourhood of Langting, to act as a barrier for North Cachar  against the raids of the Angami Nagas. The experiment answered well  to a certain extent, and would have answered better, had we been  a little less timid. The Kukis are strictly monarchical, and their  chiefs are absolutely despotic, and may murder or sell their subjects  into slavery without a murmur of dissent. Their original home cannot  be correctly ascertained, but there seem to be traces of them as  far south as the Malay peninsula. They are readily distinguishable  from the Nagas, and are braver men. Their women are often very fair,  and wear their hair in a long thick plait down the back. The men are  mostly copper coloured, and have often good features.        KUTCHA NAGAS.    The tribe we call Kutcha Nagas, very much resemble the Angamis,  though of inferior physique. They are closely allied to the Nagas  in Manipur, as well as to the Angamis, and probably were pushed in  front of the latter from the Northern North-East, as the Kukis were  forced in by the pressure of stronger tribes to their South. They  have always been less warlike than their powerful neighbours, though  they could be troublesome at times.        ANGAMI NAGAS.    A strong built, hardy, active race, the men averaging 5 feet 8 inches  to 6 feet in height, and the women tall in proportion. In colour they  vary from a rich brown to a yellowish or light brown. They have a  manly independent bearing, and are bred up to war from their earliest  years. While the Kukis are monarchists, the Nagas are republicans,  and their Peumahs, or chiefs, are elected, and though they often  have great influence, they are in theory, only primus inter pares,  and are liable at any time to be displaced. Practically they often  remain in office for years, and are greatly respected.    Where the Angamis came from must be uncertain till the languages  of our Eastern frontier are scientifically analysed. The late  Mr. Damant, a man of great talent and powers of research, had  a valuable"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37842"],[0,"Small Horses in Warfare (#7)"],[1," The author deplores the altered conditions of  the Royal Plates and the feebleness of the horses bred only for speed,  on the ground that the change was producing ill effects upon all  saddle-horses.    The author puts the whole case for a changed method of breeding in a  nutshell when he writes that \"we want a class of horses bred under a  system which holds the balance even between speed, stoutness and  structural power.\" As proving that the balance can be struck, he points  to the uniformity of speed and stoutness which distinguishes a good pack  of foxhounds. None are markedly faster than the others; the aim is to  get the hounds as even in all respects as possible, and there are  numerous packs which prove to us that this aim can be achieved with  wonderful completeness. It goes without saying, however, that it is  infinitely easier to build up a level pack of hounds than it would be to  develop a given number of horses all of which shall be alike!    It is exceedingly interesting to find that sixty-four years ago this  author, with the improvement of horses in view, should advocate adoption  of the step which has been urged in the chapter (p. 36 and _seq._) on  \"Breeding Small Horses.\" He is in favour of a National Establishment or  breeding stud, but that is a detail; he explains that his only reason  for making it a Government department is to secure that continuity of  policy which is otherwise unattainable. The nucleus of his scheme is to  \"obtain from the East a considerable number of well selected ponies. The  better portion would be found to possess much natural speed, stoutness  under severe exertion, with limbs and feet peculiarly adapted for moving  rapidly on a hard surface.\" The persons commissioned to buy these ponies         \"Would search in vain for these properties which are acquired       under a system of continued selection. Looking only for natural       qualities, they should select animals as nearly in a state of       nature as they could find them; having good symmetry, a full       amount of muscle and whatever natural speed the best animals of       the best race are found to possess.\"    He would have these horses tested for speed when brought home, the  standard being a natural degree of speed and not that of the Turf.         \"The offspring of these small horses should be tried in each       succeeding generation; and we should be satisfied for a few       years to see the natural speed of the race gradually augment,       retaining only for breeding such as went through their trials       satisfactorily.\"    On a later page he suggests the propriety of crossing these Eastern  sires with our Forest and Moorland ponies. He cannot doubt that the  immediate offspring of the first cross will prove suitable for the  saddle:         \"The best saddle horses we possess being now occasionally       produced by crossing the race horse with a pony mare. This       experiment often succeeding with one of the parents so ill       fitted for taking part in it as the modern racer, there is       every reason to conclude that, with parents properly       constituted on both sides, the breeding of the best class of       saddle horses might be accompanied with little uncertainty.\"    Thus far we find that the suggestions for breeding small horses set out  on pp. 36-43 were anticipated over sixty years ago. We must, before  taking leave of the author, glance at his plan for \"renovating\" our half  wild breeds of ponies. If it were practicable to carry out the  experiment he outlines, the results would be of undoubted interest.         \"To experiment properly in this matter it is necessary that a       public establishment should appropriate some extensive district       of unreclaimed and bad pasturage to the maintenance of a large       body of ponies. These should be interfered with only to the       extent of severe selection, founded on annual trials; taking       the animals for this purpose from their pasturage for a few       days during the summer, and tying them to pickets. Here they       should be closely inspected, and after the best formed had       been selected from the rest, they should be taken ten or twenty       at a time by rough riders of light weight, and submitted to a       trial of some hours' duration. The animals which went through       this satisfactorily should be divided into two portions: one       should be returned to their old pasturage to remain at their       then stature; while the other portion should be made to occupy       a somewhat better pasturage in order that their offspring might       acquire greater stature, the rest to be drafted and sold. When       old enough the enlarged stock should be tried, and such as went       through it well should be kept, and turned out into a little       better pasturage than that in which they had been reared, while       those rejected should be drafted and sold. It is only in this       very gradual manner that the stature of a race can be increased       to the point required. Ponies of a pure race being so vigorous       as to be wholly unfitted for rich pasturage, they become upon       it balls of fat. None of our native ponies under the plan now       proposed would be enlarged or withdrawn from their miserable       pasturage unless their form and action were good; the only       change then effected would be a pasturage a little better. Any       further enlargement would be made to depend upon the manner in       which they had been found to bear the preceding one.\"    His plan has at all events the great merit that it proposes to seek the  limit of enlargement in the half-wild ponies without risking loss of  hardiness and other valuable qualities by pampering.
