On the other hand, the larvae of certain beetles  feed on leaves, like the caterpillars of Lepidoptera; thus that of  _Crioceris Asparagi_ (Fig. 8)--which, as its name denotes, feeds on the  asparagus--closely resembles the larvae of certain Lepidoptera, as for  instance of _Thecla spini_. From this point of view the transformations  of the genus _Sitaris_ (Pl. III., Fig. 4), which have been very carefully  investigated by M. Fabre, are peculiarly interesting.[12]    [Illustration: FIG. 9, Larva of _Sitaris numeralis_ (Fabre, Ann. des Sci.  Nat., ser. 4, tome vii.). 10, Larva of _Sitaris humeralis_, in the second  stage. 11, Larva of _Sitaris humeralis_, in the third stage. 12, Larva of  _Sitaris humeralis_, in the fourth stage. 13, Pupa of _Sitaris_.]    The genus _Sitaris_ (a small beetle allied to Cantharis, the blister-fly,  and to _Meloe_, the oil-beetle) is parasitic on a kind of Bee  (Anthophora), which excavates subterranean galleries, each leading to a  cell. The eggs of the _Sitaris_, which are deposited at the entrance of  these galleries, are hatched at the end of September or beginning of  October; and M. Fabre not unnaturally expected that the young larvae,  which are active little creatures with six serviceable legs (Fig. 9),  would at once eat their way into the cells of the Anthophora. No such  thing: till the month of April following they remain without leaving  their birthplace, and consequently without food; nor do they in this  long time change either in form or size. M. Fabre ascertained this, not  only by examining the burrows of the _Anthophoras_, but also by direct  observation of some young larvae kept in captivity. In April, however,  his captives at last awoke from their long lethargy, and hurried  anxiously about their prisons. Naturally inferring that they were in  search of food, M. Fabre supposed that this would consist either of the  larvae or pupae of the Anthophora, or of the honey with which it stores  its cell. All three were tried without success. The first two were  neglected, and the larvae, when placed on the latter, either hurried  away, or perished in the attempt, being evidently unable to deal with  the sticky substance. M. Fabre was in despair: \"Jamais experience,\" he  says, \"n'a eprouve pareille deconfiture. Larves, nymphes, cellules,  miel, je vous ai tous offert; que voulez-vous donc, bestioles maudites?\"  The first ray of light came to him from our countryman, Newport, who  ascertained that a small parasite found by Leon Dufour on one of the  wild bees, and named by him Triungulinus, was, in fact, the larva of  _Meloe_. The larvae of _Sitaris_ much resembled Dufour's Triungulinus;  and acting on this hint, M. Fabre examined many specimens of Anthophora,  and found on them at last the larvae of his _Sitaris_. The males of  Anthophora emerge from the pupae sooner than the females, and M. Fabre  ascertained that, as they come out of their galleries, the little  _Sitaris_ larvae fasten upon them. Not, however, for long: instinct  teaches them that they are not yet in the straight path of development;  and, watching their opportunity, they pass from the male to the female  bee. Guided by these indications, M. Fabre examined several cells of the  Anthophora: in some, the egg of the Anthophora floated by itself on the  surface of the honey; in others, on the egg, as on a raft, sat the still  more minute larva of the _Sitaris_. The mystery was solved. At the  moment when the egg is laid the _Sitaris_ larva springs upon it. Even  while the poor mother is carefully fastening up her cell, her mortal  enemy is beginning to devour her offspring: for the egg of the  Anthophora serves not only as a raft, but as a repast. The honey which  is enough for either, would be too little for both; and the _Sitaris_,  therefore, at its first meal, relieves itself from its only rival. After  eight days the egg is consumed, and on the empty shell the _Sitaris_  undergoes its first transformation, and makes its appearance in a very  different form, as shown in Fig. 10.    The honey which was fatal before is now necessary; the activity which  before was necessary is now useless; consequently, with the change of  skin, the active, slim larva changes into a white, fleshy grub, so  organized as to float on the surface of the honey, with the mouth  beneath, and the spiracles above the surface: \"grace a l'embonpoint du  ventre,\" says M. Fabre, \"la larve est a l'abri de l'asphyxie.\" In this  state it remains until the honey is consumed; then the animal  contracts, and detaches itself from its skin, within which the further  transformations take place. In the next stage, which M. Fabre calls the  pseudo-chrysalis (Fig. 11), the larva has a solid corneous envelope and  an oval shape; and in its colour, consistency, and immobility reminds  one of a Dipterous pupa. The time passed in this condition varies much.  When it has elapsed, the animal moults again, again changes its form,  and assumes that shown in Fig. 12; after this it becomes a pupa (Fig.  13) without any remarkable peculiarities. Finally, after these wonderful  changes and adventures, in the month of August the perfect _Sitaris_ (Pl.  III., Fig. 4) makes its appearance.    On the other hand, there are cases in which larvae diverge remarkably  from the ordinary type of the group to which they belong, without, as it  seems in our present imperfect state of information, any sufficient  reason.    Thus the ordinary type of Hymenopterous larva, as we have already seen,  is a fleshy apod grub; although those of the leaf-eating and wood-boring  groups, Tenthredinidae and Siricidae (Fig. 14), are caterpillars, more or  less closely resembling those of Lepidoptera. There is, however, a group  of minute Hymenoptera, the larvae of which reside within the eggs or  larvae of other insects. It is difficult to understand why these larvae  should differ from those of Ichneumons, which are also parasitic  Hymenoptera, and should be, as will be seen by the accompanying figures,  of such remarkable and grotesque forms. The first known of these curious  larvae was observed by De Filippi,[13] who, having collected some of the  transparent eggs of a small Beetle (_Rhynchites betuleti_), to his great  surprise found more than half of them attacked by a parasite, which  proved to be the larva of a minute Hymenopterous insect belonging to the  Pteromalidae. Fig. 15 shows the egg of the Beetle, with the parasitic  larva, which is represented on a larger scale in Fig. 16.    [Illustration: FIG. 14, Larva of _Sirex_ (Westwood, loc. cit.). 15, Egg of  _Rhynchites_, showing the parasitic Larva in the interior. 16, the  parasitic Larva more magnified.]    More recently this group has been studied by M. Ganin,[14] who thus  describes the development of _Platygaster_. The egg, as in allied  Hymenopterous families, for instance in _Cynips_, is elongated and  club-shaped (Fig. 17). After a while a large nucleated cell appears in  the centre (Fig. 18). This nucleated cell divides (Fig. 19) and  subdivides. The outermost cells continue the same process, thus forming  an outer investing layer. The central, on the contrary, enlarges  considerably, and develops within itself a number of daughter cells  (Figs. 20 and 21), which gradually form a mulberry-like mass, thus  giving rise to the embryo (Fig. 22).    [Illustration: FIG. 17, Egg of _Platygaster_ (after Ganin). 18, Egg of  _Platygaster_ showing the central cell. 19, Egg of _Platygaster_ after the  division of the central wall. 20, Egg of Platygaster more advanced. 21,  Egg of _Platygaster_ more advanced. 22, Egg of Platygaster showing the  rudiment of the embryo.]    Ganin met with the larvae of _Platygaster_ in those of a small gnat,  _Cecidomyia_. Sometimes as many as fifteen parasites occurred in one gnat,  but as a rule only one of these attained maturity. The three species of  _Platygaster _differ considerably in form, as shown in Figs. 23-25. They  creep about within the larva of _Cecidomyia_ by means of the strong hooked  feet, _kf_, somewhat aided by movements of the tail. They possess a  mouth, stomach, and muscles, but the nervous, vascular, and respiratory  systems do not make their appearance until later. After some time the  larva (Fig. 23) changes its skin, assuming the form represented in Fig.  26. In this moult the last abdominal segment of the first larva is  entirely thrown off: not merely the outer skin, as in the case of the  other segments, but also the hypodermis and the muscles. This larva, as  will be seen by the figure, resembles a barrel or egg in form, and is  .870 mm. in length, the external appendages having disappeared, and the  segments being indicated only by the arrangement of the muscles. _slkf_  is the oesophagus leading into a wide stomach which occupies nearly  the whole body, _gsae_ is the rudiment of the supra-oesophageal  ganglia, _bsm_ the ventral nervous cords. The ventral nervous mass has  the form of a broad band, with straight sides; it consists of embryonal  cells, and remains in this undeveloped condition during the whole larval  state.

If you make good use of  your sharp eyes, you will be able to tell many birds by their flight  alone, long before you can see the colour of their feathers. The  passive cuckoo has no speckles on his light breast, and the  yellow-billed cuckoo, at least, has white thumb-nail spots on his  well-behaved tail, which he never thrashes, twitches, and balances as  the active, suspicious thrasher does his. Moreover the cuckoo's notes  sound like a tree-toad's rattle, while the thrasher's song--a merry  peal of music--entrances every listener. He seems rather proud of it,  to tell the truth, for although at {44} other times he may keep  himself concealed among the shrubbery, when about to sing, he chooses  a conspicuous perch as if to attract attention to his truly brilliant  performance.    The thrasher has been called a ground \"thrush\" because it so often  chooses to place its nest at the roots of tall weeds in an open field;  but a low bush frequently suits it quite as well. Its bulky nest is  not a very choice piece of architecture. Twigs, leaves, vine tendrils,  and bits of bark form its walls, and the speckled, greenish blue eggs  within are usually laid upon a lining of fine black rootlets.      THE CATBIRD    Slim, lithe, elegant, dainty, the catbird, as he runs lightly over the  lawn or hunts among the shrubbery, appears to be a fine gentleman  among his kind--a sort of Beau Brummel in smooth, gray feathers who  has preened and prinked until his toilet is quite faultless. You would  not be surprised to hear that he slept on rose petals and manicured  his claws. He is among the first to discover the bathing dish or  drinking pan that you have set up in your garden, for he is not too  squeamish, in spite of his fine appearance, to drink from his bath.  With well-poised, black-capped head erect, and {45} tail up too, wren  fashion, he stands at attention on the rim of the dish, alert,  listening, tense--the neatest, trimmest figure in birddom.    After he has flown off to the nearest thicket, what a change suddenly  comes over him! Can it be the same bird? With puffed out, ruffled  feathers, hanging head, and drooping tail, he now suggests a fat,  tousled schoolboy, just tumbled out of bed. Was ever a bird more  contradictory? One minute, from the depths of the bushy undergrowth  where he loves to hide, he delights you with the sweetest of songs,  not loud like the brown thrasher's, but similar; only it is more  exquisitely finished, and rippling. _\"Prut! Prut! coquillicot!\"_ he  begins. _\"Really, really, coquillicot! Hey, coquillicot! Hey,  victory!\"_ his inimitable song goes on like a rollicking recitative.  The next minute you would gladly stop your ears when he utters the  disagreeable cat-call that has given him his name. _\"Zeay,  Zeay\"_--whines the petulant cry. Now you see him on the ground calmly  looking for grasshoppers, or daintily helping himself to a morsel from  the dog's plate at the kitchen door. Suddenly, with a jerk and a jump,  he has sprung into the air to seize a passing moth. There is always  the pleasure of variety and the unexpected about the catbird.    He is very intelligent and friendly, like his cousin, the mockingbird.  One catbird that {46} comes to visit me at least ten times every day,  can scarcely wait for the milk to be poured into the dog's bowl before  he has flown to the brim for the first drink. Once, in his eagerness,  he alighted on the pitcher in my hand. He has a pretty trick of flying  to the sun dial as if he wished to learn the time of day. From this  point of vantage, he will sail off suddenly, like a flycatcher, to  seize an insect on the wing. He has a keen appetite for so many pests  of the garden and orchard--moths, grasshoppers, beetles, caterpillars,  spiders, flies and other insects--that his friendship, you see, is  well worth cultivating. Five catbirds, whose diet was carefully  watched by scientific men in Washington, ate thirty grasshoppers each  for one meal.    Yet how many people ignorantly abuse the catbird! Because he has the  good taste to like strawberries and cherries as well as we do, is he  to be condemned on that account? If he kills insects for us every  waking hour from April to October, don't you think he is entitled to a  little fruit in June? The ox that treadeth out the corn is not to be  muzzled, so that he cannot have a taste of it, you remember. A good  way to protect our strawberry patches and cherry trees from catbirds,  mockingbirds, and robins, is to provide fruit that they like much  better--the red mulberry. Nothing attracts so many birds to a place.  A mulberry tree in the chicken {47} yard provides a very popular  restaurant, not only for the song birds among the branches, but for  the scratchers on the ground floor.    Like the yellow-breasted chat, the catbird likes to hide its nest in a  tangle of cat brier along the roadside undergrowth and in bushy,  woodland thickets. Last winter, when that vicious vine had lost every  leaf, I counted in it eighteen catbird nests within a quarter of a  mile along a country lane. Long before the first snowstorm, the  inmates of those nests were enjoying summer weather again from the  Gulf States to Panama. If one nest should be disturbed in May or June,  when the birds are raising their families, all the catbird neighbours  join in the outcry of mews and cat-calls. Should a disaster happen to  the parents, the orphans will receive food and care from some devoted  foster-mother until they are able to fly. You see catbirds are  something far better than intelligent, musical dandies.      THE MOCKINGBIRD    What child is there who does not know the mockingbird, caged or free?  In the North you very rarely see one now-a-days behind prison bars,  for, happily, several enlightened states have made laws to punish  people who keep our wild birds in cages or offer them for sale, dead  or {48} alive. When all the states make and enforce similar laws,  there will be an end to the barbaric slaughter of many birds for no  more worthy end than the trimming of hats for thoughtless girls and  women. Birds of bright plumage have suffered most, of course, but the  mocking-birds' nests have been robbed for so many generations to  furnish caged fledglings for both American and European bird dealers,  that shot guns could have done no work more deadly. Where the people  are too ignorant to understand what mockingbirds are doing for them  every day in the year by eating insects in their gardens, fields,  parks, and public squares, they are shot in great numbers for the sole  offence of helping themselves to a small fraction of the very fruit  they have helped to preserve. Even the birds ought to have a \"square  deal\" in free America: don't you think so?    Although not afflicted with \"the fatal gift of beauty,\" at least not  the gaudy kind, like the cardinal's and scarlet tanager's, the  mocking-bird's wonderful voice has brought upon him an equal quantity  of troubles. Keenly intelligent though he is, he does not know enough  to mope and refuse to sing in a cage, but whiles away the tedious  hours of his captivity by all manner of amusing and delightful sounds.  Indeed it has been found that the household pet is apt to be a better  mocker than the wild bird--a {49} most unfortunate discovery. Not only  does he imitate the notes of birds about him, but he invents all  manner of quips and vocal jugglery.    His love song is entrancing. \"Oft in the stilly night,\" when the  moonlight sheds a silvery radiance about every sleeping creature, the  mockingbird sings to his mate such delicious music as only the  European nightingale can rival. Perhaps the stillness of the hour, the  beauty and fragrance of the place where the singer is hidden among the  orange blossoms or magnolia, increase the magic of his almost  pathetically sweet voice; but surely there is no lovelier sound in  nature on this side of the sea. Our poet Lanier declared that this  \"heavenly bird\" will be hailed as \"Brother\" by Beethoven and Keats  when he enters the choir invisible in the spirit world.    Ever alert, on the _qui vive_, the mockingbird can no more suppress  the music within him, night or day, than he can keep his nervous,  high-strung body at rest. From his restlessness alone you might know  he is the cousin of the catbird and brown thrasher and is closely  related to the wrens. Flitting from perch to perch (fluttering is one  of his chief amusements even in a cage), taking short flights from  tree to tree, and so displaying the white signals on his wings and  tail, hopping lightly, swiftly, gracefully over the ground, bounding  into the air, {50} or the next minute shooting his ashy gray body far  across the garden and leaving a wake of music behind as he flies, he  seems to be perpetually in motion. If you live in the South you can  encourage no more delightful neighbour than this star performer in the  group of lively singers.
