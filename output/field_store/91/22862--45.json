Dear child! How she started,--\"At midnight there is a cry made, Behold,  the bridegroom cometh,\"--\"Why, Tom! Oh! my dearest, is it you?\"           *       *       *       *       *    \"Have I been asleep on duty?\" This was her first word when she came  fairly to herself.    \"Guess not,\" said old Mipples, \"both lanterns was burning when I come  in. 'Most time to put 'em out, Major! 'Keepers must be diligent to save  oil by all reasonable prevision.'\"    \"Is the north light burning?\" said poor Laura. And she looked guiltily  at her tell-tale clock.    \"Darling,\" said Tom, reverently, \"if it were not burning, we should not  be here.\"    And Laura took her husband to see the babies, not willing to let his  hand leave hers, nor he, indeed, to let hers leave his. Old Mipples  thought himself one too many, and went away, wiping his eyes, to the  other light. \"Time to extinguish it,\" he said.    But before Tom and Laura had known he was gone, say in half an hour,  that is, he was back again, hailing them from below.    \"Major! Major! Major! An English steamer is at anchor in the cove, and  is sending her boat ashore.\"    Tom and Laura rushed to the window; the snow was all over now, and they  could see the monster lying within half a mile. \"Where would they be,  Miss Cutts, if somebody had not wound up the lamps at midnight? Guess  they said 'Merry Christmas' when they see 'em.\" And Laura held her  breath when she thought what might have been. Tom and Mipples ran down  to the beach to hail them, and direct the landing. Tom and Mipples shook  the hand of each man as he came ashore, and then Laura could see them  hurrying to the house together. Steps on the landing; steps on the  stairway,--the door is open, and,--not Tom this time,--but her dear lost  brother Jem, in the flesh, and in a heavy pea-coat.    \"Merry Christmas! Laura!\"           *       *       *       *       *    \"Laura,\" said Jem, as they sat at their Christmas dinner, \"what do you  think I thought of first, when I heard the cable run out so like blazes;  when I rushed up and saw your yellow lanterns there?\"    \"How should I know, Jem?\"    \"'They that dwell in the shadow of death, upon them the light hath  shined.'\"    \"But I did not think it was you, Laura.\"          CHRISTMAS WAITS IN BOSTON.      I.    I always give myself a Christmas present. And on this particular year  the present was a Carol party,--which is about as good fun, all things  consenting kindly, as a man can have.    Many things must consent, as will appear. First of all there must be  good sleighing,--and second, a fine night for Christmas eve. Ours are  not the carollings of your poor shivering little East Angles or South  Mercians, where they have to plod round afoot in countries where they do  not know what a sleigh-ride is.    I had asked Harry to have sixteen of the best voices in the chapel  school to be trained to eight or ten good Carols without knowing why. We  did not care to disappoint them if a February thaw setting in on the  24th of December should break up the spree before it began. Then I had  told Howland that he must reserve for me a span of good horses, and a  sleigh that I could pack sixteen small children into, tight-stowed.  Howland is always good about such things, knew what the sleigh was for,  having done the same in other years, and doubled the span of horses of  his own accord, because the children would like it better, and \"it would  be no difference to him.\" Sunday night as the weather nymphs ordered,  the wind hauled round to the northwest and everything froze hard. Monday  night, things moderated and the snow began to fall steadily,--so  steadily;--and so Tuesday night the Metropolitan people gave up their  unequal contest, all good men and angels rejoicing at their  discomfiture, and only a few of the people in the very lowest _Bolgie_,  being ill-natured enough to grieve. And thus it was, that by Thursday  evening was one hard compact roadway from Copp's Hill to the  Bone-burner's Gehenna, fit for good men and angels to ride over, without  jar, without noise and without fatigue to horse or man. So it was that  when I came down with Lycidas to the chapel at seven o'clock, I found  Harry had gathered there his eight pretty girls and his eight jolly  boys, and had them practising for the last time,        \"Carol, carol, Christians,      Carol joyfully;      Carol for the coming      Of Christ's nativity.\"    I think the children had got inkling of what was coming, or perhaps  Harry had hinted it to their mothers. Certainly they were warmly  dressed, and when, fifteen minutes afterwards, Howland came round  himself with the sleigh, he had put in as many rugs and bear-skins as if  he thought the children were to be taken new born from their respective  cradles. Great was the rejoicing as the bells of the horses rang beneath  the chapel windows, and Harry did not get his last _da capo_ for his  last carol. Not much matter indeed, for they were perfect enough in it  before midnight.    Lycidas and I tumbled in on the back seat, each with a child in his lap  to keep us warm; I was flanked by Sam Perry, and he by John Rich, both  of the mercurial age, and therefore good to do errands. Harry was in  front somewhere flanked in likewise, and the twelve other children lay  in miscellaneously between, like sardines when you have first opened  the box. I had invited Lycidas, because, besides being my best friend,  he is the best fellow in the world, and so deserves the best Christmas  eve can give him. Under the full moon, on the snow still white, with  sixteen children at the happiest, and with the blessed memories of the  best the world has ever had, there can be nothing better than two or  three such hours.    \"First, driver, out on Commonwealth Avenue. That will tone down the  horses. Stop on the left after you have passed Fairfield Street.\" So we  dashed up to the front of Haliburton's palace, where he was keeping his  first Christmas tide. And the children, whom Harry had hushed down for a  square or two, broke forth with good full voice under his strong lead in        \"Shepherd of tender sheep,\"    singing with all that unconscious pathos with which children do sing,  and starting the tears in your eyes in the midst of your gladness. The  instant the horses' bells stopped, their voices began. In an instant  more we saw Haliburton and Anna run to the window and pull up the  shades, and, in a minute more, faces at all the windows. And so the  children sung through Clement's old hymn. Little did Clement think of  bells and snow, as he taught it in his Sunday school there in  Alexandria. But perhaps to-day, as they pin up the laurels and the palm  in the chapel at Alexandria, they are humming the words, not thinking of  Clement more than he thought of us. As the children closed with        \"Swell the triumphant song      To Christ, our King,\"    Haliburton came running out, and begged me to bring them in. But I told  him, \"No,\" as soon as I could hush their shouts of \"Merry Christmas;\"  that we had a long journey before us, and must not alight by the way.  And the children broke out with        \"Hail to the night,      Hail to the day,\"    rather a favorite,--quicker and more to the childish taste perhaps than  the other,--and with another \"Merry Christmas\" we were off again.    Off, the length of Commonwealth Avenue, to where it crosses the  Brookline branch of the Mill-Dam,--dashing along with the gayest of the  sleighing-parties as we came back into town, up Chestnut Street, through  Louisburg Square,--we ran the sleigh into a bank on the slope of  Pinckney Street in front of Walter's house,--and, before they suspected  there that any one had come, the children were singing        \"Carol, carol, Christians,      Carol joyfully.\"    Kisses flung from the window; kisses flung back from the street. \"Merry  Christmas\" again with a good-will, and then one of the girls began        \"When Anna took the baby,      And pressed his lips to hers\"--    and all of them fell in so cheerily. O dear me! it is a scrap of old  Ephrem the Syrian, if they did but know it! And when, after this, Harry  would fain have driven on, because two carols at one house was the rule,  how the little witches begged that they might sing just one song more  there, because Mrs. Alexander had been so kind to them, when she showed  them about the German stitches. And then up the hill and over to the  North End, and as far as we could get the horses up into Moon Court,  that they might sing to the Italian image-man who gave Lucy the boy and  dog in plaster, when she was sick in the spring. For the children had,  you know, the choice of where they would go; and they select their best  friends, and will be more apt to remember the Italian image-man than  Chrysostom himself, though Chrysostom should have \"made a few remarks\"  to them seventeen times in the chapel. Then the Italian image-man heard  for the first time in his life        \"Now is the time of Christmas come,\"    and        \"Jesus in his babes abiding.\"    And then we came up Hanover Street and stopped under Mr. Gerry's chapel,  where they were dressing the walls with their evergreens, and gave them        \"Hail to the night,      Hail to the day\";    and so down State Street and stopped at the Advertiser office, because,  when the boys gave their \"Literary Entertainment,\" Mr. Hale put in their  advertisement for nothing, and up in the old"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32472"],[0,"Food in War Time (#7)"],[1,"of, 13      economic production of, 19, 20      food value, 8, 13, 14      in pellagra, 10      Mineral salts, 8, 23, 25      Muscle work, 25, 30      and carbohydrates, 40      and diet, 17      and fasting, 17      and protein, 18      and undernutrition, 38, 39        Occupation and metabolism, carrying a load, 31      climbing, 32      industrial, 33      posture, 30      running, 30-32      walking, 30      Oleomargarine, 12      Olive oil, 8      Overfat people, 38      Oxidation of food-stuffs, 24        Peanut butter, 12      Pellagra, 9      Pork, economic production of, 19, 20, 21      Potato diet, 15        Rules of saving and safety, 43        Substitution of foods, 43      historical, 11      Summary, 43      Surface area and heat production, 26        Undernutrition, 38      and labor, 38        Vegetable oils, use of, 12      Vegetarianism, 16      Vitamins, 8, 23        Weight, reduction of, 39      Women, metabolism of,"]]]
