At the present  time it is said to be still in use in Bulgaria and among the Bosnian  Turks. A woman will take a boy whom she intends to adopt and push or  pull him through her clothes; ever afterwards he is regarded as her  very son, and inherits the whole property of his adoptive parents.  Among the Berawans of Sarawak, when a woman desires to adopt a  grownup man or woman, a great many people assemble and have a feast.  The adopting mother, seated in public on a raised and covered seat,  allows the adopted person to crawl from behind between her legs. As  soon as he appears in front he is stroked with the sweet-scented  blossoms of the areca palm and tied to a woman. Then the adopting  mother and the adopted son or daughter, thus bound together, waddle  to the end of the house and back again in front of all the  spectators. The tie established between the two by this graphic  imitation of childbirth is very strict; an offence committed against  an adopted child is reckoned more heinous than one committed against  a real child. In ancient Greece any man who had been supposed  erroneously to be dead, and for whom in his absence funeral rites  had been performed, was treated as dead to society till he had gone  through the form of being born again. He was passed through a  woman's lap, then washed, dressed in swaddling-clothes, and put out  to nurse. Not until this ceremony had been punctually performed  might he mix freely with living folk. In ancient India, under  similar circumstances, the supposed dead man had to pass the first  night after his return in a tub filled with a mixture of fat and  water; there he sat with doubled-up fists and without uttering a  syllable, like a child in the womb, while over him were performed  all the sacraments that were wont to be celebrated over a pregnant  woman. Next morning he got out of the tub and went through once more  all the other sacraments he had formerly partaken of from his youth  up; in particular, he married a wife or espoused his old one over  again with due solemnity.    Another beneficent use of homoeopathic magic is to heal or prevent  sickness. The ancient Hindoos performed an elaborate ceremony, based  on homoeopathic magic, for the cure of jaundice. Its main drift was  to banish the yellow colour to yellow creatures and yellow things,  such as the sun, to which it properly belongs, and to procure for  the patient a healthy red colour from a living, vigorous source,  namely, a red bull. With this intention, a priest recited the  following spell: \"Up to the sun shall go thy heart-ache and thy  jaundice: in the colour of the red bull do we envelop thee! We  envelop thee in red tints, unto long life. May this person go  unscathed and be free of yellow colour! The cows whose divinity is  Rohini, they who, moreover, are themselves red (_rohinih_)--in their  every form and every strength we do envelop thee. Into the parrots,  into the thrush, do we put thy jaundice, and, furthermore, into the  yellow wagtail do we put thy jaundice.\" While he uttered these  words, the priest, in order to infuse the rosy hue of health into  the sallow patient, gave him water to sip which was mixed with the  hair of a red bull; he poured water over the animal's back and made  the sick man drink it; he seated him on the skin of a red bull and  tied a piece of the skin to him. Then in order to improve his colour  by thoroughly eradicating the yellow taint, he proceeded thus. He  first daubed him from head to foot with a yellow porridge made of  tumeric or curcuma (a yellow plant), set him on a bed, tied three  yellow birds, to wit, a parrot, a thrush, and a yellow wagtail, by  means of a yellow string to the foot of the bed; then pouring water  over the patient, he washed off the yellow porridge, and with it no  doubt the jaundice, from him to the birds. After that, by way of  giving a final bloom to his complexion, he took some hairs of a red  bull, wrapt them in gold leaf, and glued them to the patient's skin.  The ancients held that if a person suffering from jaundice looked  sharply at a stone-curlew, and the bird looked steadily at him, he  was cured of the disease. \"Such is the nature,\" says Plutarch, \"and  such the temperament of the creature that it draws out and receives  the malady which issues, like a stream, through the eyesight.\" So  well recognised among birdfanciers was this valuable property of the  stone-curlew that when they had one of these birds for sale they  kept it carefully covered, lest a jaundiced person should look at it  and be cured for nothing. The virtue of the bird lay not in its  colour but in its large golden eye, which naturally drew out the  yellow jaundice. Pliny tells of another, or perhaps the same, bird,  to which the Greeks gave their name for jaundice, because if a  jaundiced man saw it, the disease left him and slew the bird. He  mentions also a stone which was supposed to cure jaundice because  its hue resembled that of a jaundiced skin.    One of the great merits of homoeopathic magic is that it enables the  cure to be performed on the person of the doctor instead of on that  of his victim, who is thus relieved of all trouble and inconvenience,  while he sees his medical man writhe in anguish before him. For  example, the peasants of Perche, in France, labour under the  impression that a prolonged fit of vomiting is brought about by the  patient's stomach becoming unhooked, as they call it, and so falling  down. Accordingly, a practitioner is called in to restore the organ  to its proper place. After hearing the symptoms he at once throws  himself into the most horrible contortions, for the purpose of  unhooking his own stomach. Having succeeded in the effort, he next  hooks it up again in another series of contortions and grimaces,  while the patient experiences a corresponding relief. Fee five  francs. In like manner a Dyak medicine-man, who has been fetched in  a case of illness, will lie down and pretend to be dead. He is  accordingly treated like a corpse, is bound up in mats, taken out of  the house, and deposited on the ground. After about an hour the  other medicine-men loose the pretended dead man and bring him to  life; and as he recovers, the sick person is supposed to recover  too. A cure for a tumour, based on the principle of homoeopathic  magic, is prescribed by Marcellus of Bordeaux, court physician to  Theodosius the First, in his curious work on medicine. It is as  follows. Take a root of vervain, cut it across, and hang one end of  it round the patient's neck, and the other in the smoke of the fire.  As the vervain dries up in the smoke, so the tumour will also dry up  and disappear. If the patient should afterwards prove ungrateful to  the good physician, the man of skill can avenge himself very easily  by throwing the vervain into water; for as the root absorbs the  moisture once more, the tumour will return. The same sapient writer  recommends you, if you are troubled with pimples, to watch for a  falling star, and then instantly, while the star is still shooting  from the sky, to wipe the pimples with a cloth or anything that  comes to hand. Just as the star falls from the sky, so the pimples  will fall from your body; only you must be very careful not to wipe  them with your bare hand, or the pimples will be transferred to it.    Further, homoeopathic and in general sympathetic magic plays a great  part in the measures taken by the rude hunter or fisherman to secure  an abundant supply of food. On the principle that like produces  like, many things are done by him and his friends in deliberate  imitation of the result which he seeks to attain; and, on the other  hand, many things are scrupulously avoided because they bear some  more or less fanciful resemblance to others which would really be  disastrous.    Nowhere is the theory of sympathetic magic more systematically  carried into practice for the maintenance of the food supply than in  the barren regions of Central Australia. Here the tribes are divided  into a number of totem clans, each of which is charged with the duty  of multiplying their totem for the good of the community by means of  magical ceremonies. Most of the totems are edible animals and  plants, and the general result supposed to be accomplished by these  ceremonies is that of supplying the tribe with food and other  necessaries. Often the rites consist of an imitation of the effect  which the people desire to produce; in other words, their magic is  homoeopathic or imitative. Thus among the Warramunga the headman of  the white cockatoo totem seeks to multiply white cockatoos by  holding an effigy of the bird and mimicking its harsh cry. Among the  Arunta the men of the witchetty grub totem perform ceremonies for  multiplying the grub which the other members of the tribe use as  food. One of the ceremonies is a pantomime representing the  fully-developed insect in the act of emerging from the chrysalis. A  long narrow structure of branches is set up to imitate the chrysalis  case of the grub. In this structure a number of men, who have the  grub for their totem, sit and sing of the creature in its various  stages. Then they shuffle out of it in a squatting posture, and as  they do so they sing of the insect emerging from the chrysalis. This  is supposed to multiply the numbers of the grubs. Again, in order to  multiply emus, which are an important article of food, the men of  the emu totem paint on the ground the sacred design of their totem,  especially the parts of the emu which they like best to eat, namely,  the fat and the eggs.

These are the signatures of the councilors and of the members of the  community who gave their consent, namely ...\"         Alfred invented a graduated candle with spaces indicating one hour of  burning, which could be used as a clock. He used a ventilated cow's horn  to put around the top of the candle to prevent its blowing out, and then  devised a wooden lantern with a horn window. He described the world as  like a yolk in the middle of an egg whose shell moves around it. This  agreed with the position of Ptolemy Claudius of Alexandria, who showed  the curvature of the earth from north to south by observing that the  Polar Star was higher in the north and lower in the south. That it was  curved from east to west followed from the observation that two clocks  placed one west and one east would record a different time for the same  eclipse of the moon.         Alfred wrote poems on the worthiness of wisdom and knowledge in  preference to material pleasures, pride, and fame, in dealing with  life's sorrow and strife. His observations on human nature and his  proverbs include:        1.  As one sows, so will he mow.    2.  Every man's doom [judgment] returns to his door.    3.  He who will not learn while young, will repent of it when old.    4.  Weal [prosperity] without wisdom is worthless.    5.  Though a man had 70 acres sown with red gold, and the gold grew like  grass, yet he is not a whit the worthier unless he gain friends for  himself.    6.  Gold is but a stone unless a wise man has it.    7.  It's hard to row against the sea flood; so it is against misfortune.      8.  He who toils in his youth to win wealth, so that he may enjoy ease  in his old age, has well bestowed his toil.    9.  Many a man loses his soul through silver.    10. Wealth may pass away, but wisdom will remain, and no man may perish  who has it for his comrade.    11. Don't choose a wife for her beauty nor for wealth, but study her  disposition.    12. Many an apple is bright without and bitter within.    13. Don't believe the man of many words.    14. With a few words a wise man can compass much.    15. Make friends at market, and at church, with poor and with rich.    16. Though one man wielded all the world, and all the joy that dwells  therein, he could not therewith keep his life.    17. Don't chide with a fool.    18. A fool's bolt is soon shot.    19. If you have a child, teach it men's manners while it is little. If  you let him have his own will, he will cause you much sorrow when he  comes of age.    20. He who spares the rod and lets a young child rule, shall rue it when  the child grows old.    21. Either drinking or not drinking is, with wisdom, good.    22. Relatives often quarrel together.    23. The barkless dog bites ill.    24. Be wise of word and wary of speech, then all shall love you.    25. We may outride, but not outwit, the old man.    26. Be not so mad as to tell your friend all your thoughts.    27. If you and your friend fall out, then your enemy will know what your  friend knew before.    28. Don't choose a deceitful man as a friend, for he will do you harm.    29. The false one will betray you when you least expect it.    30. Don't choose a scornful false friend, for he will steal your goods  and deny the theft.    31. Take to yourself a steadfast man who is wise in word and deed; he  will prove a true friend in need.         To restore education and religion, Alfred disseminated the Anglo- Saxon  Chronicles; the Venerable Bede's Ecclesiastical History of the English  Nation; the \"Consolidation of Philosophy\" by Roman philosopher Boethius,  which related the use of adversity to develop the soul, and described  the goodness of God and how the highest happiness comes from spiritual  values and the soul, which are eternal, rather than from material or  earthly pursuits, which are temporal; and Pope Gregory's Pastoral Care,  which he had translated into English and was the fundamental book on the  duty of a bishop, which included a duty to teach laymen; and Orosius'  History of the World, which he had translated into English. Alfred's  advice to pastors was to live as they had been taught from books and to  teach this manner of life to others. To be avoided was pride, the mind's  deception of seeking glory in the name of doing good works, and the  corruption of high office. Bede was England's first scholar, first  theologian, and first historian. He wrote poetry, theological books,  homilies, and textbooks on grammar, rhetoric [public speaking and  debating], arithmetic, and astronomy. He adhered to the doctrine that  death entered the world by the sin of Adam, the first man. He began the  practice of dating years from the birth of Christ and believed that the  earth was round. Over the earth was a fiery spherical firmament. Above  this were the waters of the heavens. Above this were the upper heavens,  which contained the angels and was tempered with ice. He declared that  comets portend downfalls of kingdoms, pestilence, war, winds, or heat.  This reflected the church's view that a comet was a ball of fire flung  from the right hand of an angry God as a warning to mankind, usually for  disbelief. Storms were begun by the devil.         A famous poem, the oral legend of Beowulf, a hero who led his men into  adventures and performed great feats and fought monsters and dragons,  was put into writing with a Christian theme. In it, loyalty to one's  lord is a paramount virtue. Also available in writing was the story of  King Arthur's twelve victorious battles against the pagan Saxons,  authored by Nennius.         There were professional story tellers attached to great men. Others  wandered from court to court, receiving gifts for their story telling.  Men usually told oral legends of their own feats and those of their  ancestors after supper.         Alfred had monasteries rebuilt with learned and moral men heading them.  He built a nunnery which was headed by his daughter as prioress. He  built a strong wall with four gates around London, which he had taken  into his control. He appointed his son-in-law, who was one of his  eorldormen, to be alderman [older man] to govern London and to be the  shire's earl. A later king built a palace in London, although Winchester  was still the royal capital town. When the king traveled, he and his  retinue were fed by the local people at their expense.         After Alfred's death, his daughter Aethelflared ruled the country for  seven years. She had more fortified burhs built and led soldiers to  victories.         Under the royalty were the nobles. An earl headed each shire as  representative of the King. The term \"earl\" came to denote an office  instead of a nobleman. He led the array of his shire to do battle if the  shire was attacked. He executed all royal commands. An earl received  grants of land and could claim hospitality and maintenance for himself,  his officers, and his servants. He presided over the shire court. He  received one-third of the fines from the profits of justice and  collected as well a third of the revenues derived from tolls and duties  levied in the boroughs of his shire. The office tended to be hereditary.  Royal representatives called \"reeves\" started to assist them. The reeve  took security from every person for the maintenance of the public peace.  He also tracked cattle thieves, brought suspects to court, gave  judgments according to the doom books, and delivered offenders to  punishment.         Under the earls were the thegns. By service to the King, it was  possible for a coerl to rise to become a thegn and to be given land by  the King. Other thegns performed functions of magistrates. A thegn was  later identified as a person with five hides of land, a kitchen, a  church, a bell house, a judicial place at the burhgemote [a right of  magistracy], and an appointment in the King's hall. He was bound to  service in war by virtue of his landholding instead of by his  relationship to the king. Nobility was now a territorial attribute,  rather than one of birth. The wergeld of a thegn was 1200s. when that of  a ceorl or ordinary freeman was 200s. The wergeld of an earl or bishop  was four times that of a thegn: 5800s. The wergeld of a king or  archbishop was six times that of a thegn: 7200s. The higher a man's  wergeld, the higher was his legal status in the scale of punishment,  giving credible evidence, and participation in legal proceedings. The  sokemen were freemen who had inherited their own land, chose their own  lord, and attended and were subject to their lord's court. That is,  their lord has soke [soc] jurisdiction over them. A ceorl typically had  a single hide of land. A smallholder rented land of about 30 acres from  a landlord, which he paid by doing work on the lord's demesne [household  or messuage] land, paying money rent, or paying a food rent such as in  eggs or chickens. Smallholders made up about two fifths of the  population. A cottager had one to five acres of land and depended on  others for his living. Among these were shepherds, ploughmen,  swineherds, and blacksmiths. They also participated in the agricultural  work, especially at harvest time.         It was possible for a thegn to become an earl, probably by the  possession of forty hides. He might even acquire enough land to qualify  him for the witan. Women could be present at the witanagemot and  shiregemote [meeting of the people of the shire]. They could sue and be  sued in the courts. They could independently inherit, possess, and  dispose of property. A wife's inheritance was her own and under no  control of her husband.         Marriage required the consent of the lady and her friends. The man also  had to arrange for the foster lean, that is, remuneration for rearing  and support of expected children. He also declared the amount of money  or"]]]
