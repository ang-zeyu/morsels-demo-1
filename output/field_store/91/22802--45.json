Alas! will Roger e'er his sleep forgo,       Afore larks sing, or early cocks 'gin Crow,       As I've for thee, ungrateful maiden, done,       To help thee milking, e'er day wark begun?       And when thy well-stripp'd kye(1) would yield no more,       Still on my head the reeking kit(2) I bore.       And, Oh! bethink thee, then, what lovesome talk       We've held together, ganging down the balk,       Maund'ring(3) at time which would na for us stay,       But now, I ween, maes(4) no such hast away.       Yet, O! return eftsoon and ease my woe,       And to some distant parish let us go,       And there again them leetsome days restore,       Where, unassail'd by meety(5) folk in power,       Our cattle yet may feed, tho' Snaith Marsh be no more.

Many annuals      come true: thus I purchased German seeds of thirty-four named      sub-varieties of one _race_ of ten-week stocks (_Matthiola annua_), and      raised a hundred and forty plants, all of which, with the exception of      a single plant, came true. In saying this, however, it must be      understood that I could distinguish only twenty kinds out of the      thirty-four named sub-varieties; nor did the colour of the flower      always correspond with the name affixed to the packet; but I say that      they came true, because in each of the thirty-six short rows every      plant was absolutely alike, with the one single exception. Again, I      procured packets of German seed of twenty-five named varieties of      common and quilled asters, and raised a hundred and twenty-four plants;      of these, all except ten were true in the above limited sense; and I      considered even a wrong shade of colour as false.        It is a singular circumstance that white varieties generally transmit      their colour much more truly than any other variety. This fact probably      stands in close relation with one observed by Verlot,[52] namely, that      flowers which are normally white rarely vary into any other colour. I      have found that the white varieties of _Delphinium consolida_ and of      the Stock are the truest. It is, indeed, sufficient to look through a      nurseryman's seed-list, to see the large number of white varieties      which can be propagated by seed. The several coloured varieties of the      sweet-pea (_Lathyrus odoratus_) are very true; but I hear from Mr.      Masters, of Canterbury, who has particularly attended to this plant,      that the white variety is the truest. The hyacinth, when propagated by      seed, is extremely inconstant in colour, but \"white hyacinths almost      always give by seed white-flowered plants;\"[53] and Mr. Masters informs      me that the yellow varieties also reproduce their colour, but of      different shades. On the other hand, pink and blue varieties, the      latter being the natural colour, are not nearly so true: hence, as Mr.      Masters has remarked to me, \"we see that a garden variety may acquire a      more permanent habit than a natural species;\" but it should have been      added, that this occurs under cultivation, and therefore under changed      conditions.        With many flowers, especially perennials, nothing can be more      fluctuating than the colour of the seedlings, as is notoriously the      case with verbenas, carnations, dahlias, cinerarias, and others.[54] I      sowed seed of twelve {21} named varieties of Snapdragon (_Antirrhinum      majus_), and utter confusion was the result. In most cases the      extremely fluctuating colour of seedling plants is probably in chief      part due to crosses between differently-coloured varieties during      previous generations. It is almost certain that this is the case with      the polyanthus and coloured primrose (_Primula veris_ and _vulgaris_),      from their reciprocally dimorphic structure;[55] and these are plants      which florists speak of as never come true by seed: but if care be      taken to prevent crossing, neither species is by any means very      inconstant in colour; thus I raised twenty-three plants from a purple      primrose, fertilised by Mr. J. Scott with its own pollen, and eighteen      came up purple of different shades, and only five reverted to the      ordinary yellow colour: again, I raised twenty plants from a bright-red      cowslip, similarly treated by Mr. Scott, and every one perfectly      resembled its parent in colour, as likewise did, with the exception of      a single plant, 73 grandchildren. Even with the most variable flowers,      it is probable that each delicate shade of colour might be permanently      fixed so as to be transmitted by seed, by cultivation in the same soil,      by long-continued selection, and especially by the prevention of      crosses. I infer this from certain annual larkspurs (_Delphinium      consolida_ and _ajacis_), of which common seedlings present a greater      diversity of colour than any other plant known to me; yet on procuring      seed of five named German varieties of _D. consolida_, only nine plants      out of ninety-four were false; and the seedlings of six varieties of      _D. ajacis_ were true in the same manner and degree as with the stocks      above described. A distinguished botanist maintains that the annual      species of Delphinium are always self-fertilised; therefore I may      mention that thirty-two flowers on a branch of _D. consolida_, enclosed      in a net, yielded twenty-seven capsules, with an average of 17.2 seed      in each; whilst five flowers, under the same net, which were      artificially fertilised, in the same manner as must be effected by bees      during their incessant visits, yielded five capsules with an average of      35.2 fine seed; and this shows that the agency of insects is necessary      for the full fertility of this plant. Analogous facts could be given      with respect to the crossing of many other flowers, such as carnations,      &c., of which the varieties fluctuate much in colour.        As with flowers, so with our domesticated animals, no character is more      variable than colour, and probably in no animal more so than with the      horse. Yet with a little care in breeding, it appears that races of any      colour might soon be formed. Hofacker gives the result of matching two      hundred and sixteen mares of four different colours with like-coloured      stallions, without regard to the colour of their ancestors; and of the      two hundred and sixteen colts born, eleven alone failed to inherit the      colour of their parents: Autenrieth and Ammon assert that, after two      generations, colts of a uniform colour are produced with certainty.[56]    In a few rare cases peculiarities fail to be inherited, apparently from the  force of inheritance being too strong. I have been assured by breeders of  the canary-bird that to get a good {22} jonquil-coloured bird it does not  answer to pair two jonquils, as the colour then comes out too strong, or is  even brown. So again, if two crested canaries are paired, the young birds  rarely inherit this character:[57] for in crested birds a narrow space of  bare skin is left on the back of the head, where the feathers are up-turned  to form the crest, and, when both parents are thus characterised, the  bareness becomes excessive, and the crest itself fails to be developed. Mr.  Hewitt, speaking of Laced Sebright Bantams, says[58] that, \"why this should  be so, I know not, but I am confident that those that are best laced  frequently produce offspring very far from perfect in their markings,  whilst those exhibited by myself, which have so often proved successful,  were bred from the union of heavily-laced birds with those that were  scarcely sufficiently laced.\"    It is a singular fact that, although several deaf-mutes often occur in the  same family, and though their cousins and other relations are often in the  same condition, yet their parents are very rarely deaf-mutes. To give a  single instance: not one scholar out of 148, who were at the same time in  the London Institution, was the child of parents similarly afflicted. So  again, when a male or a female deaf-mute marries a sound person, their  children are most rarely affected: in Ireland out of 203 children thus  produced one alone was mute. Even when both parents have been deaf-mutes,  as in the case of forty-one marriages in the United States and of six in  Ireland, only two deaf and dumb children were produced. Mr. Sedgwick,[59]  in commenting on this remarkable and fortunate failure in the power of  transmission in the direct line, remarks that it may possibly be owing to  \"excess having reversed the action of some natural law in development.\" But  it is safer in the present state of our knowledge to look at the whole case  as simply unintelligible.           *       *       *       *       *    With respect to the inheritance of structures mutilated by injuries or  altered by disease it is difficult to come to any {23} definite conclusion.  In some cases mutilations have been practised for a vast number of  generations without any inherited result. Godron has remarked[60] that  different races of man have from time immemorial knocked out their upper  incisors, cut off joints of their fingers, made holes of immense size  through the lobes of their ears or through their nostrils, made deep gashes  in various parts of their bodies, and there is no reason whatever to  suppose that these mutilations have ever been inherited. Adhesions due to  inflammation and pits from the small-pox (and formerly many consecutive  generations must have been thus pitted) are not inherited. With respect to  Jews, I have been assured by three medical men of the Jewish faith that  circumcision, which has been practised for so many ages, has produced no  inherited effect; Blumenbach, on the other hand, asserts[61] that in  Germany Jews are often born in a condition rendering circumcision  difficult, so that a name is here applied to them signifying \"born  circumcised.\" The oak and other trees must have borne galls from primeval  times, yet they do not produce inherited excrescences; many other such  facts could be adduced.    On the other hand, various cases have been recorded of cats, dogs, and  horses, which have had their tails, legs, &c., amputated or injured,  producing offspring with the same parts ill-formed; but as it is not at all  rare for similar malformations to appear spontaneously, all such cases may  be due to mere coincidence. Nevertheless, Dr. Prosper Lucas has given, on  good authorities, such a long list of inherited injuries, that it is  difficult not to believe in them. Thus, a cow that "]]]
