As soon as symptoms of death  appeared, the poisoner fled, aided by the emissaries of All, with whom  the court of Berat was packed, and presented himself at Janina to  receive the reward of his crime. Ali thanked him for his zeal, commended  his skill, and referred him to the treasurer. But the instant the wretch  left the seraglio in order to receive his recompense, he was seized by  the executioners and hurried to the gallows. In thus punishing the  assassin, Ali at one blow discharged the debt he owed him, disposed of  the single witness to be dreaded, and displayed his own friendship for  the victim! Not content with this, he endeavoured to again throw  suspicion on the wife of Ibrahim Pacha, whom he accused of being jealous  of the influence which Sepher Pacha had exercised in the family. This he  mentioned regularly in conversation, writing in the same style to his  agents at Constantinople, and everywhere where there was any profit in  slandering a family whose ruin he desired for the sake of their  possessions. Before long he made a pretext out of the scandal started by  himself, and prepared to take up arms in order, he said, to avenge his  friend Sepher Bey, when he was anticipated by Ibrahim Pacha, who roused  against him the allied Christians of Thesprotia, foremost among whom  ranked the Suliots famed through Albania for their courage and their  love of independence.    After several battles, in which his enemies had the a vantage, Ali began  negotiations with Ibrahim, and finally concluded a treaty offensive and  defensive. This fresh alliance was, like the first, to be cemented by a  marriage. The virtuous Emineh, seeing her son Veli united to the second  daughter of Ibrahim, trusted that the feud between the two families was  now quenched, and thought herself at the summit of happiness. But her  joy was not of long duration; the death-groan was again to be heard  amidst the songs of the marriage-feast.    The daughter of Chainitza, by her first husband, Ali, had married a  certain Murad, the Bey of Clerisoura. This nobleman, attached to Ibrahim  Pacha by both blood and affection, since the death of Sepher Bey, had,  become the special object of Ali's hatred, caused by the devotion of  Murad to his patron, over whom he had great influence, and from whom  nothing could detach him. Skilful in concealing truth under special  pretexts, Ali gave out that the cause of his known dislike to this young  man was that the latter, although his nephew by marriage, had several  times fought in hostile ranks against him. Therefore the amiable Ibrahim  made use of the marriage treaty to arrange an honourable reconciliation  between Murad Bey and his uncle, and appointed the former \"Ruler a the  Marriage Feast,\" in which capacity he was charged to conduct the bride  to Janina and deliver her to her husband, the young Veli Bey. He had  accomplished his mission satisfactorily, and was received by Ali with  all apparent hospitality. The festival began on his arrival towards the  end of November 1791, and had already continued several days, when  suddenly it was announced that a shot had been fired upon Ali, who had  only escaped by a miracle, and that the assassin was still at large.  This news spread terror through the city and the palace, and everyone  dreaded being seized as the guilty person. Spies were everywhere  employed, but they declared search was useless, and that there must bean  extensive conspiracy against Ali's life. The latter complained of being  surrounded by enemies, and announced that henceforth he would receive  only one person at a time, who should lay down his arms before entering  the hall now set apart for public audience. It was a chamber built over  a vault, and entered by a sort of trap-door, only reached by a ladder.    After having for several days received his couriers in this sort of  dovecot, Ali summoned his nephew in order to entrust with him the  wedding gifts. Murad took this as a sign of favour, and joyfully  acknowledged the congratulations of his friends. He presented himself at  the time arranged, the guards at the foot of the ladder demanded his  arms, which he gave up readily, and ascended the ladder full of hope.  Scarcely had the trap-door closed behind him when a pistol ball, fired  from a dark corner, broke his shoulder blade, and he fell, but sprang up  and attempted to fly. Ali issued from his hiding place and sprang upon  him, but notwithstanding his wound the young bey defended himself  vigorously, uttering terrible cries. The pacha, eager to finish, and  finding his hands insufficient, caught a burning log from the hearth,  struck his nephew in the face with it, felled him to the ground, and  completed his bloody task. This accomplished, Ali called for help with  loud cries, and when his guards entered he showed the bruises he had  received and the blood with which he was covered, declaring that he had  killed in self-defence a villain who endeavoured to assassinate him. He  ordered the body to be searched, and a letter was found in a pocket  which Ali had himself just placed there, which purported to give the  details of the pretended conspiracy.    As Murad's brother was seriously compromised by this letter, he also was  immediately seized, and strangled without any pretence of trial. The  whole palace rejoiced, thanks were rendered to Heaven by one of those  sacrifices of animals still occasionally made in the East to celebrate  an escape from great danger, and Ali released some prisoners in order to  show his gratitude to Providence for having protected him from so  horrible a crime. He received congratulatory visits, and composed an  apology attested by a judicial declaration by the cadi, in which the  memory of Murad and his brother was declared accursed. Finally,  commissioners, escorted by a strong body of soldiers, were sent to seize  the property of the two brothers, because, said the decree, it was just  that the injured should inherit the possessions of his would-be  assassins.    Thus was exterminated the only family capable of opposing the Pacha of  Janina, or which could counterbalance his influence over the weak  Ibrahim of Berat. The latter, abandoned by his brave defenders, and  finding himself at the mercy of his enemy, was compelled to submit to  what he could not prevent, and protested only by tears against these  crimes, which seemed to herald a terrible future for himself.    As for Emineh, it is said that from the date of this catastrophe she  separated herself almost entirely from her blood-stained husband, and  spent her life in the recesses of the harem, praying as a Christian both  for the murderer and his victims. It is a relief, in the midst of this  atrocious saturnalia to encounter this noble and gentle character, which  like a desert oasis, affords a rest to eyes wearied with the  contemplation of so much wickedness and treachery.    Ali lost in her the guardian angel who alone could in any way restrain  his violent passions. Grieved at first by the withdrawal of the wife  whom hitherto he had loved exclusively, he endeavoured in vain to regain  her affection; and then sought in new vices compensation for the  happiness he had lost, and gave himself up to sensuality. Ardent in  everything, he carried debauchery to a monstrous extent, and as if his  palaces were not large enough for his desires, he assumed various  disguises; sometimes in order to traverse the streets by night in search  of the lowest pleasures; sometimes penetrating by day into churches and  private houses seeking for young men and maidens remarkable for their  beauty, who were then carried off to his harem.    His sons, following in his footsteps, kept also scandalous households,  and seemed to dispute preeminence in evil with their father, each in his  own manner. Drunkenness was the speciality of the eldest, Mouktar, who  was without rival among the hard drinkers of Albania, and who was  reputed to have emptied a whole wine-skin in one evening after a  plentiful meal. Gifted with the hereditary violence of his family, he  had, in his drunken fury, slain several persons, among others his  sword-bearer, the companion of his childhood and confidential friend of  his whole life. Veli chose a different course. Realising the Marquis de  Sade as his father had realised Macchiavelli, he delighted in mingling  together debauchery and cruelty, and his amusement consisted in biting  the lips he had kissed, and tearing with his nails the forms he had  caressed. The people of Janina saw with horror more than one woman in  their midst whose nose and ears he had caused to be cut off, and had  then turned into the streets.    It was indeed a reign of terror; neither fortune, life, honour, nor  family were safe. Mothers cursed their fruitfulness, and women their  beauty. Fear soon engenders corruption, and subjects are speedily  tainted by the depravity of their masters. Ali, considering a  demoralised race as easier to govern, looked on with satisfaction.    While he strengthened by every means his authority from within, he  missed no opportunity of extending his rule without. In 1803 he declared  war against the Suliots, whose independence he had frequently  endeavoured either to purchase or to overthrow. The army sent against  them, although ten thousand strong, was at first beaten everywhere. Ali  then, as usual, brought treason to his aid, and regained the advantage.  It became evident that, sooner or later, the unhappy Suliots must  succumb.    Foreseeing the horrors which their defeat would entail, Emineh, touched  with compassion, issued from her seclusion and cast herself at Ali's  feet. He raised her, seated her beside him, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2754"],[0,"The Countess of Saint Geran (#7)"],[1,"victim.    Baulieu swaddled the child immediately, put it in a basket, hid it under  his cloak, and went with his prey to find the marquis; they conferred  together for some time, after which the house steward passed by a  postern gate into the moat, thence to a terrace by which he reached a  bridge leading into the park. This park had twelve gates, and he had the  keys of all. He mounted a blood horse which he had left waiting behind a  wall, and started off at full gallop. The same day he passed through the  village of Escherolles, a league distant from Saint-Geran, where he  stopped at the house of a nurse, wife of a glove-maker named Claude.  This peasant woman gave her breast to the child; but the steward, not  daring to stay in a village so near Saint-Geran, crossed the river  Allier at the port de la Chaise, and calling at the house of a man named  Boucaud, the good wife suckled the child for the second time; he then  continued his journey in the direction of Auvergne.    The heat was excessive, his horse was done up, the child seemed uneasy.  A carrier's cart passed him going to Riom; it was owned by a certain  Paul Boithion of the town of Aigueperce, a common carrier on the road.  Baulieu went alongside to put the child in the cart, which he entered  himself, carrying the infant on his knees. The horse followed, fastened  by the bridle to the back of the cart.    In the conversation which he held with this man, Baulieu said that he  should not take so much care of the child did it not belong to the most  noble house in the Bourbonnais. They reached the village of Che at  midday. The mistress of the house where he put up, who was nursing an  infant, consented to give some of her milk to the child. The poor  creature was covered with blood; she warmed some water, stripped off its  swaddling linen, washed it from head to foot, and swathed it up again  more neatly.    The carrier then took them to Riom. When they got there, Baulieu got rid  of him by giving a false meeting-place for their departure; left in the  direction of the abbey of Lavoine, and reached the village of  Descoutoux, in the mountains, between Lavoine and Thiers. The  Marchioness de Bouille had a chateau there where she occasionally spent  some time.    The child was nursed at Descoutoux by Gabrielle Moini, who was paid a  month in advance; but she only kept it a week or so, because they  refused to tell her the father and mother and to refer her to a place  where she might send reports of her charge. This woman having made these  reasons public, no nurse could be found to take charge of the child,  which was removed from the village of Descoutoux. The persons who  removed it took the highroad to Burgundy, crossing a densely wooded  country, and here they lost their way.    The above particulars were subsequently proved by the nurses, the  carrier, and others who made legal depositions. They are stated at  length here, as they proved very important in the great lawsuit. The  compilers of the case, into which we search for information, have  however omitted to tell us how the absence of the major-domo was  accounted for at the castle; probably the far-sighted marquis had got an  excuse ready.    The countess's state of drowsiness continued till daybreak. She woke  bathed in blood, completely exhausted, but yet with a sensation of  comfort which convinced her that she had been delivered from her burden.  Her first words were about her child; she wished to see it, kiss it; she  asked where it was. The midwife coolly told her, whilst the girls who  were by were filled with amazement at her audacity, that she had not  been confined at all. The countess maintained the contrary, and as she  grew very excited, the midwife strove to calm her, assuring her that in  any case her delivery could not be long protracted, and that, judging  from all the indications of the night, she would give birth to a boy.  This promise comforted the count and the countess dowager, but failed to  satisfy the countess, who insisted that a child had been born.    The same day a scullery-maid met a woman going to the water's edge in  the castle moat, with a parcel in her arms. She recognised the midwife,  and asked what she was carrying and where she was going so early. The  latter replied that she was very inquisitive, and that it was nothing at  all; but the girl, laughingly pretending to be angry at this answer,  pulled open one of the ends of the parcel before the midwife had time to  stop her, and exposed to view some linen soaked in blood.    \"Madame has been confined, then?\" she said to the matron.    \"No,\" replied she briskly, \"she has not.\"    The girl was unconvinced, and said, \"How do you mean that she has not,  when madame the marchioness, who was there, says she has?\" The matron in  great confusion replied, \"She must have a very long tongue, if she said  so.\"    The girl's evidence was later found most important.    The countess's uneasiness made her worse the next day. She implored with  sighs and tears at least to be told what had become of her child,  steadily maintaining that she was not mistaken when she assured them  that she had given birth to one. The midwife with great effrontery told  her that the new moon was unfavourable to childbirth, and that she must  wait for the wane, when it would be easier as matters were already  prepared.    Invalids' fancies do not obtain much credence; still, the persistence of  the countess would have convinced everyone in the long run, had not the  dowager said that she remembered at the end of the ninth month of one of  her own pregnancies she had all the premonitory symptoms of lying in,  but they proved false, and in fact the accouchement took place three  months later.    This piece of news inspired great confidence. The marquis and Madame de  Bouille did all in their power to confirm it, but the countess  obstinately refused to listen to it, and her passionate transports of  grief gave rise to the greatest anxiety. The midwife, who knew not how  to gain time, and was losing all hope in face of the countess's  persistence, was almost frightened out of her wits; she entered into  medical details, and finally said that some violent exercise must be  taken to induce labour. The countess, still unconvinced, refused to obey  this order; but the count, the dowager, and all the family entreated her  so earnestly that she gave way.    They put her in a close carriage, and drove her a whole day over  ploughed fields, by the roughest and hardest roads. She was so shaken  that she lost the power of breathing; it required all the strength of  her constitution to support this barbarous treatment in the delicate  condition of a lady so recently confined. They put her to bed again  after this cruel drive, and seeing that nobody took her view, she threw  herself into the arms of Providence, and consoled herself by religion;  the midwife administered violent remedies to deprive her of milk; she  got over all these attempts to murder her, and slowly got better.    Time, which heals the deepest affliction, gradually soothed that of the  countess; her grief nevertheless burst out periodically on the slightest  cause; but eventually it died out, till the following events rekindled  it.    There had been in Paris a fencing-master who used to boast that he had a  brother in the service of a great house. This fencing-master had married  a certain Marie Pigoreau, daughter of an actor. He had recently died in  poor circumstances, leaving her a widow with two children. This woman  Pigoreau did not enjoy the best of characters, and no one knew how she  made a living, when all at once, after some short absences from home and  visit from a man who came in the evening, his face muffled in his cloak,  she launched out into a more expensive style of living; the neighbours  saw in her house costly clothes, fine swaddling-clothes, and at last it  became known that she was nursing a strange child.    About the same time it also transpired that she had a deposit of two  thousand livres in the hands of a grocer in the quarter, named Raguenet;  some days later, as the child's baptism had doubtless been put off for  fear of betraying his origin, Pigoreau had him christened at St. Jean en  Greve. She did not invite any of the neighbours to the function, and  gave parents' names of her own choosing at the church. For godfather she  selected the parish sexton, named Paul Marmiou, who gave the child the  name of Bernard. La Pigoreau remained in a confessional during the  ceremony, and gave the man ten sou. The godmother was Jeanne Chevalier,  a poor woman of the parish.    The entry in the register was as follows:        \"On the seventh day of March one thousand six hundred and       forty-two was baptized Bernard, son of .  .  .  and .  .  .  his       godfather being Paul Marmiou, day labourer and servant of this       parish, and his godmother Jeanne Chevalier, widow of Pierre       Thibou.\"    A few days afterwards la Pigoreau put out the child to nurse in the  village of Torcy en Brie, with a woman who had been her godmother, whose  husband was called Paillard. She gave out that it was a child of quality  which had been entrusted to her, and that she should not hesitate, if  such a thing were necessary, to save its life by the loss of one of her  own children. The nurse did not keep it long, because she fell ill; la  Pigoreau went to fetch the child away, lamenting this accident, and  further saying that she regretted it all the more, as the nurse would  have earned enough to make her comfortable for the rest of her life. She  put the infant out again in the same village, with the widow of a  peasant named Marc Peguin. The monthly wage was regularly paid, and the  child brought up as one of rank. La Pigoreau further told the woman that  it was the son of a great nobleman, and would later make the fortunes of  those who served him. An elderly man, "]]]
