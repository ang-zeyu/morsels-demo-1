That  belief is what we call rational, and even elevated. The myths, on the  other hand, are what we call irrational and debasing. We regard low  savages as very irrational and debased characters, consequently the  nature of their myths does not surprise us. Their religious conception,  however, of a \"Father\" or \"Master of Life\" seems out of keeping with  the nature of the savage mind as we understand it. Still, there the  religious conception actually is, and it seems to follow that we do not  wholly understand the savage mind, or its unknown antecedents. In  any case, there the facts are, as shall be demonstrated. However the  ancestors of Australians, or Andamanese, or Hurons arrived at their  highest religious conception, they decidedly possess it.(1) The  development of their mythical conceptions is accounted for by those  qualities of their minds which we do understand, and shall illustrate at  length. For the present, we can only say that the religious conception  uprises from the human intellect in one mood, that of earnest  contemplation and submission: while the mythical ideas uprise from  another mood, that of playful and erratic fancy. These two moods are  conspicuous even in Christianity. The former, that of earnest and  submissive contemplation, declares itself in prayers, hymns, and \"the  dim religious light\" of cathedrals. The second mood, that of playful  and erratic fancy, is conspicuous in the buffoonery of Miracle Plays, in  Marchen, these burlesque popular tales about our Lord and the Apostles,  and in the hideous and grotesque sculptures on sacred edifices. The two  moods are present, and in conflict, through the whole religious history  of the human race. They stand as near each other, and as far apart, as  Love and Lust.      (1) The hypothesis that the conception was borrowed from European  creeds will be discussed later. See, too, \"Are Savage Gods borrowed from  Missionaries?\" Nineteenth Century, January, 1899.      It will later be shown that even some of the most backward savages make  a perhaps half-conscious distinction between their mythology and their  religion. As to the former, they are communicative; as to the latter,  they jealously guard their secret in sacred mysteries. It is improbable  that reflective \"black fellows\" have been morally shocked by the  flagrant contradictions between their religious conceptions and their  mythical stories of the divine beings. But human thought could not come  into explicit clearness of consciousness without producing the sense of  shock and surprise at these contradictions between the Religion and the  Myth of the same god. Of this we proceed to give examples.    In Greece, as early as the sixth century B. C., we are all familiar with  Xenophanes' poem(1) complaining that the gods were credited with the  worst crimes of mortals--in fact, with abominations only known in the  orgies of Nero and Elagabalus. We hear Pindar refusing to repeat the  tale which told him the blessed were cannibals.(2) In India we read the  pious Brahmanic attempts to expound decently the myths which made Indra  the slayer of a Brahman; the sinner, that is, of the unpardonable sin.  In Egypt, too, we study the priestly or philosophic systems by which the  clergy strove to strip the burden of absurdity and sacrilege from their  own deities. From all these efforts of civilised and pious believers to  explain away the stories about their own gods we may infer one fact--the  most important to the student of mythology--the fact that myths were not  evolved in times of clear civilised thought. It is when Greece is just  beginning to free her thought from the bondage of too concrete language,  when she is striving to coin abstract terms, that her philosophers and  poets first find the myths of Greece a stumbling-block.      (1) Ritter and Preller, Hist. Philos., Gothae, 1869, p. 82.    (2) Olympic Odes, i., Myers's translation: \"To me it is impossible to  call one of the blessed gods a cannibal.... Meet it is for a man that  concerning the gods he speak honourably, for the reproach is less. Of  thee, son of Tantalus, I will speak contrariwise to them who have gone  before me.\" In avoiding the story of the cannibal god, however, Pindar  tells a tale even more offensive to our morality.      All early attempts at an interpretation of mythology are so many efforts  to explain the myths on some principle which shall seem not unreasonable  to men living at the time of the explanation. Therefore the pious  remonstrances and the forced constructions of early thinkers like  Xenophanes, of poets like Pindar, of all ancient Homeric scholars and  Pagan apologists, from Theagenes of Rhegium (525 B. C.), the early  Homeric commentator, to Porphyry, almost the last of the heathen  philosophers, are so many proofs that to Greece, as soon as she had  a reflective literature, the myths of Greece seemed impious and  IRRATIONAL. The essays of the native commentators on the Veda, in the  same way, are endeavours to put into myths felt to be irrational and  impious a meaning which does not offend either piety or reason. We may  therefore conclude that it was not men in an early stage of philosophic  thought (as philosophy is now understood)--not men like Empedocles and  Heraclitus, nor reasonably devout men like Eumaeus, the pious swineherd  of the Odyssey--who evolved the blasphemous myths of Greece, of Egypt  and of India. We must look elsewhere for an explanation. We must try to  discover some actual and demonstrable and widely prevalent condition  of the human mind, in which tales that even to remote and rudimentary  civilisations appeared irrational and unnatural would seem natural and  rational. To discover this intellectual condition has been the aim of  all mythologists who did not believe that myth is a divine tradition  depraved by human weakness, or a distorted version of historical events.    Before going further, it is desirable to set forth what our aim is, and  to what extent we are seeking an interpretation of mythology. It is not  our purpose to explain every detail of every ancient legend, either as a  distorted historical fact or as the result of this or that confusion of  thought caused by forgetfulness of the meanings of language, or in any  other way; nay, we must constantly protest against the excursions of  too venturesome ingenuity. Myth is so ancient, so complex, so full of  elements, that it is vain labour to seek a cause for every phenomenon.  We are chiefly occupied with the quest for an historical condition of  the human intellect to which the element in myths, regarded by us as  irrational, shall seem rational enough. If we can prove that such a  state of mind widely exists among men, and has existed, that state of  mind may be provisionally considered as the fount and ORIGIN of the  myths which have always perplexed men in a reasonable modern mental  condition. Again, if it can be shown that this mental stage was one  through which all civilised races have passed, the universality of the  mythopoeic mental condition will to some extent explain the universal  DIFFUSION of the stories.    Now, in all mythologies, whether savage or civilised, and in all  religions where myths intrude, there exist two factors--the factor  which we now regard as rational, and that which we moderns regard as  irrational. The former element needs little explanation; the latter  has demanded explanation ever since human thought became comparatively  instructed and abstract.    To take an example; even in the myths of savages there is much that  still seems rational and transparent. If savages tell us that some wise  being taught them all the simple arts of life, the use of fire, of the  bow and arrow, the barbing of hooks, and so forth, we understand them  at once. Nothing can be more natural than that man should believe in an  original inventor of the arts, and should tell tales about the imaginary  discoverers if the real heroes be forgotten. So far all is plain  sailing. But when the savage goes on to say that he who taught the use  of fire or who gave the first marriage laws was a rabbit or a crow, or a  dog, or a beaver, or a spider, then we are at once face to face with the  element in myths which seems to us IRRATIONAL. Again, among civilised  peoples we read of the pure all-seeing Varuna in the Vedas, to whom  sin is an offence. We read of Indra, the Lord of Thunder, borne in his  chariot, the giver of victory, the giver of wealth to the pious; here  once more all seems natural and plain. The notion of a deity who guides  the whirlwind and directs the storm, a god of battles, a god who blesses  righteousness, is familiar to us and intelligible; but when we read how  Indra drank himself drunk and committed adulteries with Asura women, and  got himself born from the same womb as a bull, and changed himself into  a quail or a ram, and suffered from the most abject physical terror, and  so forth, then we are among myths no longer readily intelligible; here,  we feel, are IRRATIONAL stories, of which the original ideas, in their  natural sense, can hardly have been conceived by men in a pure and  rational early civilisation. Again, in the religions of even the  lowest races, such myths as these are in contradiction with the ethical  elements of the faith.    If we look at Greek religious tradition, we observe the coexistence of  the RATIONAL and the apparently IRRATIONAL elements. The RATIONAL myths  are those which represent the gods as beautiful and wise beings. The  Artemis of the Odyssey \"taking her pastime in the chase of boars and  swift deer, while with her the wild wood-nymphs disport them, and high  over them all she rears her brow, and is easily to be known where all  are fair,\"(1) is a perfectly RATIONAL mythic representation of a divine  being. We feel, even now, that the conception of a \"queen and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2833"],[0,"The Portrait of a Lady — Volume 1 (#7)"],[1,"hesitation, she stooped and caught him in her hands,  holding him face to face while he continued his quick chatter. His  master now had had time to follow and to see that Bunchie's new friend  was a tall girl in a black dress, who at first sight looked pretty.  She was bareheaded, as if she were staying in the house--a fact which  conveyed perplexity to the son of its master, conscious of that immunity  from visitors which had for some time been rendered necessary by the  latter's ill-health. Meantime the two other gentlemen had also taken  note of the new-comer.    \"Dear me, who's that strange woman?\" Mr. Touchett had asked.    \"Perhaps it's Mrs. Touchett's niece--the independent young lady,\" Lord  Warburton suggested. \"I think she must be, from the way she handles the  dog.\"    The collie, too, had now allowed his attention to be diverted, and he  trotted toward the young lady in the doorway, slowly setting his tail in  motion as he went.    \"But where's my wife then?\" murmured the old man.    \"I suppose the young lady has left her somewhere: that's a part of the  independence.\"    The girl spoke to Ralph, smiling, while she still held up the terrier.  \"Is this your little dog, sir?\"    \"He was mine a moment ago; but you've suddenly acquired a remarkable air  of property in him.\"    \"Couldn't we share him?\" asked the girl. \"He's such a perfect little  darling.\"    Ralph looked at her a moment; she was unexpectedly pretty. \"You may have  him altogether,\" he then replied.    The young lady seemed to have a great deal of confidence, both in  herself and in others; but this abrupt generosity made her blush. \"I  ought to tell you that I'm probably your cousin,\" she brought out,  putting down the dog. \"And here's another!\" she added quickly, as the  collie came up.    \"Probably?\" the young man exclaimed, laughing. \"I supposed it was quite  settled! Have you arrived with my mother?\"    \"Yes, half an hour ago.\"    \"And has she deposited you and departed again?\"    \"No, she went straight to her room, and she told me that, if I should  see you, I was to say to you that you must come to her there at a  quarter to seven.\"    The young man looked at his watch. \"Thank you very much; I shall be  punctual.\" And then he looked at his cousin. \"You're very welcome here.  I'm delighted to see you.\"    She was looking at everything, with an eye that denoted clear  perception--at her companion, at the two dogs, at the two gentlemen  under the trees, at the beautiful scene that surrounded her. \"I've never  seen anything so lovely as this place. I've been all over the house;  it's too enchanting.\"    \"I'm sorry you should have been here so long without our knowing it.\"    \"Your mother told me that in England people arrived very quietly; so I  thought it was all right. Is one of those gentlemen your father?\"    \"Yes, the elder one--the one sitting down,\" said Ralph.    The girl gave a laugh. \"I don't suppose it's the other. Who's the  other?\"    \"He's a friend of ours--Lord Warburton.\"    \"Oh, I hoped there would be a lord; it's just like a novel!\" And then,  \"Oh you adorable creature!\" she suddenly cried, stooping down and  picking up the small dog again.    She remained standing where they had met, making no offer to advance or  to speak to Mr. Touchett, and while she lingered so near the threshold,  slim and charming, her interlocutor wondered if she expected the old man  to come and pay her his respects. American girls were used to a great  deal of deference, and it had been intimated that this one had a high  spirit. Indeed Ralph could see that in her face.    \"Won't you come and make acquaintance with my father?\" he nevertheless  ventured to ask. \"He's old and infirm--he doesn't leave his chair.\"    \"Ah, poor man, I'm very sorry!\" the girl exclaimed, immediately moving  forward. \"I got the impression from your mother that he was rather  intensely active.\"    Ralph Touchett was silent a moment. \"She hasn't seen him for a year.\"    \"Well, he has a lovely place to sit. Come along, little hound.\"    \"It's a dear old place,\" said the young man, looking sidewise at his  neighbour.    \"What's his name?\" she asked, her attention having again reverted to the  terrier.    \"My father's name?\"    \"Yes,\" said the young lady with amusement; \"but don't tell him I asked  you.\"    They had come by this time to where old Mr. Touchett was sitting, and he  slowly got up from his chair to introduce himself.    \"My mother has arrived,\" said Ralph, \"and this is Miss Archer.\"    The old man placed his two hands on her shoulders, looked at her a  moment with extreme benevolence and then gallantly kissed her. \"It's  a great pleasure to me to see you here; but I wish you had given us a  chance to receive you.\"    \"Oh, we were received,\" said the girl. \"There were about a dozen  servants in the hall. And there was an old woman curtseying at the  gate.\"    \"We can do better than that--if we have notice!\" And the old man stood  there smiling, rubbing his hands and slowly shaking his head at her.  \"But Mrs. Touchett doesn't like receptions.\"    \"She went straight to her room.\"    \"Yes--and locked herself in. She always does that. Well, I suppose I  shall see her next week.\" And Mrs. Touchett's husband slowly resumed his  former posture.    \"Before that,\" said Miss Archer. \"She's coming down to dinner--at eight  o'clock. Don't you forget a quarter to seven,\" she added, turning with a  smile to Ralph.    \"What's to happen at a quarter to seven?\"    \"I'm to see my mother,\" said Ralph.    \"Ah, happy boy!\" the old man commented. \"You must sit down--you must  have some tea,\" he observed to his wife's niece.    \"They gave me some tea in my room the moment I got there,\" this young  lady answered. \"I'm sorry you're out of health,\" she added, resting her  eyes upon her venerable host.    \"Oh, I'm an old man, my dear; it's time for me to be old. But I shall be  the better for having you here.\"    She had been looking all round her again--at the lawn, the great trees,  the reedy, silvery Thames, the beautiful old house; and while engaged  in this survey she had made room in it for her companions; a  comprehensiveness of observation easily conceivable on the part of a  young woman who was evidently both intelligent and excited. She had  seated herself and had put away the little dog; her white hands, in  her lap, were folded upon her black dress; her head was erect, her eye  lighted, her flexible figure turned itself easily this way and that, in  sympathy with the alertness with which she evidently caught impressions.  Her impressions were numerous, and they were all reflected in a clear,  still smile. \"I've never seen anything so beautiful as this.\"    \"It's looking very well,\" said Mr. Touchett. \"I know the way it strikes  you. I've been through all that. But you're very beautiful yourself,\" he  added with a politeness by no means crudely jocular and with the happy  consciousness that his advanced age gave him the privilege of saying  such things--even to young persons who might possibly take alarm at  them.    What degree of alarm this young person took need not be exactly  measured; she instantly rose, however, with a blush which was not a  refutation. \"Oh yes, of course I'm lovely!\" she returned with a quick  laugh. \"How old is your house? Is it Elizabethan?\"    \"It's early Tudor,\" said Ralph Touchett.    She turned toward him, watching his face. \"Early Tudor? How very  delightful! And I suppose there are a great many others.\"    \"There are many much better ones.\"    \"Don't say that, my son!\" the old man protested. \"There's nothing better  than this.\"    \"I've got a very good one; I think in some respects it's rather better,\"  said Lord Warburton, who as yet had not spoken, but who had kept an  attentive eye upon Miss Archer. He slightly inclined himself, smiling;  he had an excellent manner with women. The girl appreciated it in an  instant; she had not forgotten that this was Lord Warburton. \"I should  like very much to show it to you,\" he added.    \"Don't believe him,\" cried the old man; \"don't look at it! It's a  wretched old barrack--not to be compared with this.\"    \"I don't know--I can't judge,\" said the girl, smiling at Lord Warburton.    In this discussion Ralph Touchett took no interest whatever; he stood  with his hands in his pockets, looking greatly as if he should like to  renew his conversation with his new-found cousin.    \"Are you very fond of dogs?\" he enquired by way of beginning. He seemed  to recognise that it was an awkward beginning for a clever man.    \"Very fond of them indeed.\"    \"You must keep the terrier, you know,\" he went on, still awkwardly.    \"I'll keep him while I'm here, with pleasure.\"    \"That will be for a long time, I hope.\"    \"You're very kind. I hardly know. My aunt must settle that.\"    \"I'll settle it with her--at a quarter to seven.\" And Ralph looked at  his watch again.    \"I'm glad to be here at all,\" said the girl.    \"I don't believe you allow things to be settled for you.\"    \"Oh yes; if they're settled as I like them.\"    \"I shall settle this as I like it,\" said Ralph. \"It's most unaccountable  that we should never have known you.\"    \"I was there--you had only to come and see me.\"    \"There? Where do you mean?\"    \"In the United States: in New York and Albany and other American  places.\"    \"I've been there--all over, but I never saw you. I can't make it out.\"    Miss Archer just hesitated. \"It was because there had been some  disagreement between your mother and my father, after my mother's death,  which took place when I was a child. In consequence of it we never  expected to see you.\"    \"Ah, but I don't embrace all my mother's quarrels--heaven forbid!\"  the young man cried. \"You've lately lost your father?\" he went on more  gravely.    \"Yes; more than a year ago. After that my aunt was very kind to me; she  came to see me and proposed that I should come with her to Europe.\"    \"I see,\" said Ralph. \"She "]]]
