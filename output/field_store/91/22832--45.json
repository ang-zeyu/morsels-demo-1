Not only does each have  the typical triangular form which would naturally arise from tetrahedral  shrinking of the globe, but there are four other cardinal points of  resemblance. First, in the northeast each possesses an area of extremely  ancient rocks, the Laurentian highlands of Quebec and Labrador in North  America and the highlands of Guiana in South America. Second, in the  southeast lie highlands of old but not the most ancient rocks stretching  from northeast to southwest in the Appalachian region of North America,  and in the Brazilian mountains of the southern continent. Third, along  the western side of each continent recent crustal movements supplemented  by volcanic action on a magnificent scale have given rise to a complex  series of younger mountains, the two great cordilleras. Finally, the  spaces between the three mountain masses are occupied by a series of  vast confluent plains which in each case extend from the northern ocean  to the southern and bend around the southeastern highlands. These plains  are the newest part of America, for many of them have emerged from the  sea only in recent geological times. Taken as a whole the resemblance  between the two continents is striking.    If these four physiographic provinces of North and South America lay in  similar latitudes in the respective continents we might expect each pair  to have a closely similar effect on life. In fauna, flora, and even in  human history they would present broad and important resemblances. As a  matter of fact, however, they are as different as can well be imagined.  Where North America, is bathed by icy waters full of seals and floating  ice South America is bathed by warm seas full of flying-fish and coral  reefs. The northern continent is broadest in the cool latitudes that are  most favorable for human activity. The southern expands most widely in  latitudes whose debilitating monotony of heat and moisture is the  worst of handicaps to human progress. The great rivers of the northern  continent correspond very closely to those of the southern. The  Mackenzie, however, is bound in the rigid bands of winter for eight  months each year, while the Orinoco, the corresponding South American  river, lies sweltering under a tropical sun which burns its grassy  plains to bitter dust even as the sharp cold reduced the Mackenzie  region to barren tundra. The St. Lawrence flows through fertile grain  fields and the homes of an active people of the temperate zone, but the  Amazon winds its slow way amid the malarious languor of vast tropical  forests in which the trees shut out the sky and the few natives are  apathetic with the eternal inertia of the hot, damp tropics.    Only when we come to the Mississippi in the northern continent and  the Rio de la Plata in the southern do we find a pair of rivers which  correspond to any degree in the character of the life surrounding them,  as well as in their physiographic character. Yet even here there is a  vast difference, especially in the upper courses of the river. Each at  its mouth flows through a rich, fertile plain occupied by a progressive,  prosperous people. But the Rio de la Plata takes its rise in one of the  world's most backward plains, the home of uncivilized Indians,  heartless rubber adventurers, and the most rapacious of officials. Not  infrequently, the degenerate white men of these regions, yielding to  the subtle and insidious influence of the tropics, inflict the most  outrageous abuses upon the natives, and even kill them on slight  provocation. The natives in turn hate their oppressors, and when the  chance comes betray them or leave them to perish in sickness and misery.  The upper Mississippi, on the other hand, comes from a plain where  agriculture is carried on with more labor-saving devices than are found  anywhere else in the world. There States like Wisconsin and Minnesota  stand in the forefront of educational and social progress. The contrasts  between the corresponding rivers of the two Americas are typical of the  contrasts in the history of the two continents.        CHAPTER III. THE GEOGRAPHIC PROVINCES OF NORTH AMERICA    The four great physical divisions of North America--the Laurentian  highland, the Appalachian highland, the plains, and the western  cordillera--are strikingly different in form and structure. The  Laurentian highland presents a monotonous waste of rough hills,  irregular valleys, picturesque lakes, and crooked rivers. Most of it  is thinly clothed with pine trees and bushes such as the blueberry  and huckleberry. Yet everywhere the ancient rock crops out. No one can  travel there without becoming tiresomely familiar with fine-grained,  shattered schists, coarse granites, and their curiously banded  relatives, the gneisses. This rocky highland stretches from a little  north of the St. Lawrence River to Hudson Bay, around which it laps in  the form of a V, and so is known as the Archaean V or shield.    Everywhere this oldest part of the Western Hemisphere presents  unmistakable signs of great age. The schists by their fine crumpling and  scaly flakes of mineral show that they were formed deep in the bowels  of the earth, for only there could they be subjected to the enormous  pressure needed to transform their minerals into sheets as thin as  paper. The coarse granites and gneisses proclaim still more clearly that  they must have originated far down in the depths of the earth; their  huge crystals of mica, quartz, hornblende, feldspar, and other minerals  could never have been formed except under a blanket of rock which almost  prevented the original magmas from cooling. The thousands or tens of  thousands of feet of rock which once overlay the schists and still more  the granites and gneisses must have been slowly removed by erosion, for  there was no other way to get rid of them. This process must have  taken tens of millions of years, and yet the whole work must have been  practically completed a hundred or perhaps several hundred million years  ago. We know this because the selfsame ancient eroded surface which  is exposed in the Laurentian highland is found dipping down under the  oldest known fossiliferous rocks. Traces of that primitive land surface  are found over a large part of the American continent. Elsewhere they  are usually buried under later strata laid down when the continent  sank in part below sea-level. Only in Laurentia has the land remained  steadily above the reach of the ocean throughout the millions of years.    Today this old, old land might be as rich as many others if climate  had been kind to it. Its soil, to be sure, would in many parts be sandy  because of the large amount of quartz in the rocks. That would be a  small handicap, however, provided the soil were scores of feet deep like  the red soil of the corresponding highland in the Guiana region of  South America. But today the North American Laurentia has no soil worth  mentioning. For some reason not yet understood this was the part  of America where snow accumulated most deeply and where the largest  glaciers were formed during the last great glacial period. Not once but  many times its granite surface was shrouded for tens of thousands of  years in ice a mile or more thick. As the ice spread outward in almost  every direction, it scraped away the soil and gouged innumerable hollows  in the softer parts of the underlying rock. It left the Laurentian  highland a land of rocky ribs rising between clear lakes that fill the  hollows. The lakes are drained by rapid rivers which wind this way  and that in hopeless confusion as they strive to move seaward over the  strangely uneven surface left by the ice. Such a land is good for the  hunter and trapper. It is also good for the summer pleasure-seeker who  would fain grow strong by paddling a canoe. For the man who would make  a permanent home it is a rough, inscrutable region where one has need of  more than most men's share of courage and persistence. Not only did  the climate of the past cause the ice to scrape away the soil, but  the climate of the present is so cold that even where new soil has  accumulated the farmer can scarcely make a living.    Around the borders of the Laurentian highland the ice accomplished a  work quite different from the devastation of the interior. One of its  chief activities was the scouring of a series of vast hollows which  now hold the world's largest series of lakes. Even the lakes of Central  Africa cannot compare with our own Great Lakes and the other smaller  lakes which belong to the same series. These additional lakes begin  in the far north with Great Bear Lake and continue through Great Slave  Lake, Lake Athabasca, and Lake Winnipeg to the Lake of the Woods, which  drains into Lake Superior. All these lakes lie on the edge of the great  Laurentian shield, where the ice, crowding down from the highland to  the north and east, was compressed into certain already existent hollows  which it widened, deepened, and left as vast bowls ready to be filled  with lakes.    South and southwest of the Laurentian highland the great ice sheet  proved beneficial to man. There, instead of leaving the rock naked,  as in the Laurentian region, it merely smoothed off many of the  irregularities of the surface and covered large areas with the most  fertile soil.    In doing this, to be sure, the ice-cap scoured some hollows and left a  vastly larger number of basins surrounded in whole or in part by glacial  debris. These have given rise to the innumerable lakes, large and small,  whose beauty so enhances the charms of Canada, New England, New York,  Minnesota, and other States. They serve as reservoirs for the water  supply of towns and power plants and as sources of ice and fish. Though  they take land from agriculture, they probably add to the life of  the community as much in other ways as they detract in this. Moreover  glaciation diverted countless"]]]
