The victor is invariably satisfied with this, and does not seek to  dispatch him with his beak.    It was very usual to see a little group of cocks gathered together in  the middle of one of the knolls squabbling noisily. Sometimes half a  dozen would be lifting their raucous voices at one particular bird, then  they would separate into pairs, squaring up to one another and  emphasizing their remarks from time to time by a few quick blows from  their flippers. It seemed that each was indignant with the others for  coming and spoiling his chances with a coveted hen, and trying to get  them to depart before he went to her.    It was useless for either to attempt overtures whilst the others were  there, for the instant he did so, he would be set upon and a desperate  fight begin. Usually, as in the case I described above, one of the  little crowd would suddenly \"see red\" and sail into an opponent with  desperate energy, invariably driving him in the first rush down the side  of the knoll to the open space surrounding it, where the fight would be  fought out, the victor returning to the others, until by his prowess and  force of character, he would rid himself of them all. Then came his  overtures to the hen. He would, as a rule, pick up a stone and lay it in  front of her if she were sitting in her \"scoop,\" or if she were standing  by it he might himself squat in it. She might take to him kindly, or, as  often happened, peck him furiously. To this he would submit tamely,  hunching up his feathers and shutting his eyes while she pecked him  cruelly. Generally after a little of this she would become appeased. He  would rise to his feet, and in the prettiest manner edge up to her,  gracefully arch his neck, and with soft guttural sounds pacify her and  make love to her.      [Illustration: Fig. 24. \"Hard at it\" (See page 39)]      [Illustration: Fig. 25. The End of the Battle (Page 39)]    Both perhaps would then assume the \"ecstatic\" attitude, rocking their  necks from side to side as they faced one another (Fig. 26), and after  this a perfect understanding would seem to grow up between them, and the  solemn compact was made.    It is difficult to convey in words the daintiness of this pretty little  scene. I saw it enacted many dozens of times, and it was wonderful to  watch one of these hardy little cocks pacifying a fractious hen by the  perfect grace of his manners.    Fig. 21 is particularly instructive. In the centre of the picture a  group of cocks are quarrelling, and on the left-hand side three unmated  hens can be seen sitting in their scoops, whilst two of them (the two in  front) are receiving overtures from two of the cocks who are making the  most of their time whilst the others are fighting. On the right-hand  side another cock is seen proposing himself to a fourth hen who seems to  be meeting his overtures with the usual show of reluctance.    Although for the later arrivals a good deal of fighting was necessary  before a mate could be secured, it seemed that some got the matter fixed  up without any difficulty at all, especially during the earlier days  when only a few birds were scattered widely over the rookery. Later, the  cocks seemed to watch one another jealously, and to hunt in little  batches in consequence. (Figs. 27, 28, and 29.)    From the particulars I have just given it is also evident that a wife  and home once obtained could only be kept by dint of further battling  and constant vigilance during the first stages of domesticity, when  thousands of lusty cocks were pouring into the rookery, and it was not  unusual to see a strange cock paying court to a mated hen in the absence  of her husband until he returned to drive away the interloper, but I do  not think that this ever occurred after the eggs had come and the  regular family life begun, couples after this being perfectly faithful  to one another.    The instance I have given of a newly arrived cock by dumb show  pretending to take a stone and place it before a mated hen, is typical  of the sort of first overture one sees, though more frequently an actual  stone was tendered. While on this subject I had better mention a most  interesting thing which occurred to one of my companions. One day as he  was sitting quietly on some shingle near the ice-foot, a penguin  approached him, and after eyeing him for a little, walked right up to  him and nibbled gently at one of the legs of his wind-proof trousers.  Then it walked away, picked up a pebble, and came back with it, dropping  it on the ground by his side. The only explanation of this occurrence  seems to be that the tendering of the stone was meant as an overture of  friendship.      [Illustration: Fig. 26. THE PROPOSAL. (NOTE THE HEN IN HER SCOOP)    (Pages 35 and 43)]    On October 26 there was no abatement in the stream of arrivals. The  cock-fighting continued, and many of them, temporarily disabled, were to  be seen moping about the rookery, smeared with blood and guano. Often a  hen would join in when two cocks were fighting, occasionally going first  for one and then the other, but I never to my knowledge saw a cock  retaliate on a hen.    Once I saw two cocks fighting, and a hen taking the part of one of the  cocks, the pair of them gave the other a fearful hammering, the hen  using her bill savagely as well as her flippers. Completely knocked out  and gasping for breath he got away at last, only to meet another cock  who fought him and easily beat him. When this one had gone a third came,  and the poor victim with a courage truly noble was squaring himself up  with his last spark of energy, when I interfered and drove away his  enemy.    The nests on most of the knolls soon became so crowded that their  occupants, by stretching out their necks, could reach their neighbours  without getting up. As every hen appeared to hate her neighbour they  would peck-peck at one another hour after hour, in the manner seen in my  photograph,(3) till their mouths and heads became terribly sore.  Occasionally they would desist, shake their heads apparently from pain,  then at it again.      (3) Fig. 12.    In various places through the course of these pages, reference is made  to the \"ecstatic\" attitude of the penguins. This antic is gone through  by both sexes and at various times, though much more frequently during  the actual breeding season. The bird rears its body upward and  stretching up its neck in a perpendicular line, discharges a volley of  guttural sounds straight at the unresponding heavens. At the same time  the clonic movements of its syrinx or \"sound box\" distinctly can be seen  going on in its throat. Why it does this I have never been able to make  out, but it appears to be thrown into this ecstasy when it is pleased;  in fact, the zoologist of the \"Pourquoi Pas\" expedition termed it the  \"Chant de satisfaction.\" I suppose it may be likened to the crowing of a  cock or the braying of an ass. When one bird of a pair starts to perform  in this way, the other usually starts at once to pacify it. Very many  times I saw this scene enacted when nesting was in progress. The two  might be squatting by the nest when one would arise to assume the  \"ecstatic\" attitude and make the guttural sounds in its syrinx.  Immediately the other would get close up to it and make the following  noise in a soft soothing tone:      [Illustration: A-ah]    Always and immediately this caused the musician to subside and settle  itself down again.      [Illustration: Fig. 27. Cocks fighting for Hens]      [Illustration: Fig. 28. Cocks fighting for Hens (Page 44)]    The King penguin at the Zoological Gardens, whose sex is unknown, throws  itself into the ecstatic attitude and sings a sort of song when its  keeper strokes its neck. The blackfooted penguins never do it, though  they breed several times a year. Figs. 26 and 32 show Adelies in  ecstatic attitude.    To-day about a dozen skua gulls (_Megalestris Makormiki_) appeared for  the first time. They did not start to nest, but sat on the sea-ice with  a group of penguins, in apparent amity. A few occasionally flew about  over the rookery.    On October 27 though the stream of arrivals continued there were wide  gaps in it. It appeared to be thinning. For an hour in the forenoon it  stopped altogether, and at the end of this time a storm of wind from the  south struck us and continued for another hour with thick drift.  Probably clear of Cape Adare the wind had been blowing before it reached  us, and had stopped the birds' progress across the ice.    During the storm the rookery was completely silenced, most of the birds  lying with their heads to the wind. A good many skuas arrived that day.  Some chips of white, glistening quartz had been thrown down by our hut  door recently, and later I found two of these chips in a nest about  thirty yards away, showing up brightly against the black basalt of which  all the pebbles on the rookery were composed.    As a rule the penguins were careful to select rounded stones for their  nests, but these fragments of quartz were jagged and uncomfortable, and  most unsuitable for nest building. Thus it was evidently the brightness  of the stones which attracted them. Whilst I looked on, the owners of  the pieces of quartz were wrangling with their neighbours, and a penguin  in a nest behind shot out its beak and stole one of the pieces, placing  it in its own nest. I had brought Campbell out to show him the pieces of  quartz, and he witnessed the last incident with me.      [Illustration: Fig. 29. Cocks fighting for Hens (Page 44)]      [Illustration: Fig. 30. Penguin on Nest]    I may here mention an experiment I tried some days later. I painted some  pebbles a bright red and had others covered with bright green cotton  material as I had no other coloured paint.

The tales of Amerigo Vespucci have a place in the history of  geographical discovery, and require, although they do not deserve,  serious consideration; the more so as they have, in recent years, been  treated seriously by a learned and accomplished writer such as Varnhagen,  who has been followed by one or two eminent and well-known men of letters.  It is, therefore, proper that translations of the letters should be  printed by the Hakluyt Society, and that their merits should be fully  discussed.    In addition to the two letters of Vespucci, the present volume contains  the evidence taken in the Columbus lawsuit bearing on the subject, the  chapters in the history of Las Casas in which the veracity of Vespucci is  discussed, the narrative of the voyage of Hojeda from Navarrete, and some  other documents throwing light on the career of the Florentine adventurer.      [Illustration]          LETTER OF AMERIGO VESPUCCI    ON THE ISLANDS NEWLY DISCOVERED IN HIS FOUR VOYAGES.      FIRST VOYAGE OF AMERIGO VESPUCCI.[57]      [Illustration]    Magnificent Lord.[58] I submit humble reverence to you and offer due  recommendations. It may be that your Magnificence will be astonished  at my temerity that I should dare so absurdly to write the present  long letter to your Magnificence, knowing that your Magnificence is  constantly occupied in the high councils and affairs touching the lofty  Republic. And I may be considered not only presumptuous but also idle  in writing things not convenient to your condition nor agreeable, and  written in a barbarous style. But as I have confidence in your virtues  and in the merit of my writing, which is touching things never before  written upon either by ancient or modern writers, as will be seen, I  may be excused by your Magnificence. The principal thing that moved me  to write to you was the request of the bearer, who is named Benvenuto  Benvenuti, our Florentine, who is very much the servant of your  Magnificence, as he tells me, and a great friend of mine. He, finding  himself here in this city of Lisbon, requested me to give an account  to your Magnificence of the things by me seen in different parts of the  world, during the four voyages that I have made to discover new lands; two  by order of the Catholic King Ferdinand, by the Great Gulf of the Ocean  Sea towards the west, the other two by order of the powerful King Manoel  of Portugal, towards the south. He assured me that you will be pleased,  and that in this I might hope to serve you. It was this that disposed me  to do it, being assured that your Magnificence would include me in the  number of your servants, remembering how, in the time of our youth, I was  your friend, and now your servant, going together to hear the principles  of grammar under the good life and doctrine of the venerable religious  friar of St. Mark, Friar Giorgio Antonio Vespucci, whose counsels and  doctrine, if it had pleased God that I had followed, I should have been  another man from what I am, as Petrarch says. _Quomodocunque sit_, I am  not ashamed, because I have always taken delight in virtuous things. Yet  if these my frivolities are not acceptable to your virtue, I will reflect  on what Pliny said to Maecenas, \"Formerly my witticisms used to entertain  you.\" It may be that, though your Magnificence is continually occupied  with public affairs, you may find an hour of leisure, during which you  can pass a little time in frivolous or amusing things, and so, as a  change from so many occupations, you may read this my letter. For you  may well turn for a brief space from constant care and assiduous thought  concerning public affairs.    Your Magnificence must know that the motive of my coming into this  kingdom of Spain was to engage in mercantile pursuits, and that I was  occupied in such business for nearly four years, during which I saw  and knew various changes of fortune. As these affairs of commerce are  uncertain, a man being at one time at the top of the well, and at another  fallen and subject to losses, and as the continual labour that a man is  exposed to who would succeed, became evident to me, as well as exposure  to dangers and failures, I decided upon leaving the mercantile career,  and upon entering on one that would be more stable and praiseworthy. I  was disposed to see some part of the world and its wonders.    Time and opportunity offered themselves very conveniently. The King Don  Fernando of Castille,[59] having ordered four ships to be dispatched for  the discovery of new lands towards the west, I was chosen by his Highness  to go in this fleet to help in the discovery. I left the port of Cadiz on  the 10th of May[60] 1497, and we took our way for the Great Gulf of the  Ocean Sea, on which voyage I was engaged for eighteen months, discovering  a great extent of mainland, and an infinite number of islands, most of  them inhabited, of which no mention had been made by ancient writers, I  believe because they had not any clear information. If I remember rightly,  I have read somewhere that this Ocean Sea was without inhabitants. Our  poet Dante was of this opinion, in the 26th chapter of the _Inferno_,  where he treats of the death of Ulysses.[61] In this voyage I saw many  wonderful things, as your Magnificence will understand. As I said before,  we left the port of Cadiz in four ships, and began our navigation to the  Fortunate Islands, which are now called the Grand Canaria, situated in  the Ocean Sea, on the confines of the inhabited west, within the third  climate.[62] Over which place the Pole rises from the north, above the  horizon 27 deg. and a half, and it is distant from this city of Lisbon 280  leagues,[63] between south and south-west. Here we staid for eight days,  providing ourselves with wood, water, and other necessaries. From thence,  having offered our prayers, we weighed, and spread our sails to the  wind, shaping our course to the west, with a point to south-west.[64]  Our progress was such that at the end of thirty-seven days[65] we reached  land which we judged to be the mainland, being distant from the island of  Canaria, more to the west, nearly 1,000 leagues,[66] outside that which  is inhabited in the Torrid Zone. For we found the North Pole was above  its horizon 16 deg.; and more to the westward than the island of Canaria,  according to the observations with our instruments 70 deg.[67]    We anchored with our ships at a distance of a league and a half from the  shore. We got out the boats, and, filled with armed men, we pulled them  to the shore. Before we arrived we had seen many men walking along the  beach, at which we were much pleased; and we found that they were naked,  and they showed fear of us, I believe because we were dressed and of  a different stature. They all fled to a hill, and, in spite of all the  signs of peace and friendship that we made, they would not come to have  intercourse with us. As night was coming on, and the ship was anchored  in a dangerous place, off an open unsheltered coast, we arranged to get  under weigh the next day, and to go in search of some port or bay where  we could make our ships secure. We sailed along the coast to the north,  always in sight of land, and the people went along the beach. After  two days of navigation we found a very secure place for the ships,  and we anchored at a distance of half a league from the land, where we  saw very many people. We went on shore in the boats on the same day,  and forty men in good order landed. The natives were still shy of us,  and we could not give them sufficient confidence to induce them to come  and speak with us. That day we worked so hard with this object by giving  them our things, such as bells, looking-glasses, and other trifles, that  some of them took courage and came to treat with us. Having established  a friendly understanding, as the night was approaching we took leave of  them, and returned on board. Next day, at dawn, we saw that there were  an immense number of people on the beach, and that they had their women  and children with them. We went on shore, and found that they all came  laden with their food supplies, which are such as will be described in  their place. Before we arrived on shore, many of them swam out to receive  us at a cross-bow shot's distance; for they are great swimmers, and they  showed as much confidence as if we had been having intercourse with them  for a long time; and we were pleased at seeing their feelings of security.    What we knew of their life and customs was that they all go naked, as well  the men as the women, without covering anything, no otherwise than as they  come out of their mothers' wombs. They are of medium stature, and very  well proportioned. The colour of their skins inclines to red, like the  skin of a lion, and I believe that, if they were properly clothed, they  would be white like ourselves. They have no hair whatever on their bodies,  but they have very long black hair, especially the women, which beautifies  them. They have not very beautiful faces, because they have long eyelids,  which make them look like Tartars. They do not allow any hairs to grow on  their eyebrows, nor eyelashes, nor in any other part except on the head,  where it is rough and dishevelled. They are very agile in their persons,  both in walking and running, as well the men as the women; and think  nothing of running a league or two, as we often witnessed; and in this  they have a very great advantage over us Christians. They swim wonderfully  well, and the women better than the men; for we have found and seen them  many times two leagues at sea, without any help whatever in swimming.    Their arms are bows and arrows, well made, except that they have no iron,  nor any other kind of hard metal. Instead of iron they use teeth of  animals or of fish, or a bit of wood well burnt at the point. They are  sure shots, and where they aim"]]]
