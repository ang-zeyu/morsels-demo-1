[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/308"],[0,"Three Men in a Boat (To Say Nothing of the Dog) (#7)"],[1," it was a plot to deprive him of his living by waking up the  corpses.    My friend got rid of them, at last, by taking them down to a sea-side  town, and burying them on the beach.  It gained the place quite a  reputation.  Visitors said they had never noticed before how strong the  air was, and weak-chested and consumptive people used to throng there for  years afterwards.    Fond as I am of cheese, therefore, I hold that George was right in  declining to take any.    \"We shan't want any tea,\" said George (Harris's face fell at this); \"but  we'll have a good round, square, slap-up meal at seven--dinner, tea, and  supper combined.\"    Harris grew more cheerful.  George suggested meat and fruit pies, cold  meat, tomatoes, fruit, and green stuff.  For drink, we took some  wonderful sticky concoction of Harris's, which you mixed with water and  called lemonade, plenty of tea, and a bottle of whisky, in case, as  George said, we got upset.    It seemed to me that George harped too much on the getting-upset idea.  It seemed to me the wrong spirit to go about the trip in.    But I'm glad we took the whisky.    We didn't take beer or wine.  They are a mistake up the river.  They make  you feel sleepy and heavy.  A glass in the evening when you are doing a  mouch round the town and looking at the girls is all right enough; but  don't drink when the sun is blazing down on your head, and you've got  hard work to do.    We made a list of the things to be taken, and a pretty lengthy one it  was, before we parted that evening.  The next day, which was Friday, we  got them all together, and met in the evening to pack.  We got a big  Gladstone for the clothes, and a couple of hampers for the victuals and  the cooking utensils.  We moved the table up against the window, piled  everything in a heap in the middle of the floor, and sat round and looked  at it.    I said I'd pack.    I rather pride myself on my packing.  Packing is one of those many things  that I feel I know more about than any other person living.  (It  surprises me myself, sometimes, how many of these subjects there are.)  I  impressed the fact upon George and Harris, and told them that they had  better leave the whole matter entirely to me.  They fell into the  suggestion with a readiness that had something uncanny about it.  George  put on a pipe and spread himself over the easy-chair, and Harris cocked  his legs on the table and lit a cigar.    This was hardly what I intended.  What I had meant, of course, was, that  I should boss the job, and that Harris and George should potter about  under my directions, I pushing them aside every now and then with, \"Oh,  you--!\"  \"Here, let me do it.\"  \"There you are, simple enough!\"--really  teaching them, as you might say.  Their taking it in the way they did  irritated me.  There is nothing does irritate me more than seeing other  people sitting about doing nothing when I'm working.    I lived with a man once who used to make me mad that way.  He would loll  on the sofa and watch me doing things by the hour together, following me  round the room with his eyes, wherever I went.  He said it did him real  good to look on at me, messing about.  He said it made him feel that life  was not an idle dream to be gaped and yawned through, but a noble task,  full of duty and stern work.  He said he often wondered now how he could  have gone on before he met me, never having anybody to look at while they  worked.    Now, I'm not like that.  I can't sit still and see another man slaving  and working.  I want to get up and superintend, and walk round with my  hands in my pockets, and tell him what to do.  It is my energetic nature.  I can't help it.    However, I did not say anything, but started the packing.  It seemed a  longer job than I had thought it was going to be; but I got the bag  finished at last, and I sat on it and strapped it.    \"Ain't you going to put the boots in?\" said Harris.    And I looked round, and found I had forgotten them.  That's just like  Harris.  He couldn't have said a word until I'd got the bag shut and  strapped, of course.  And George laughed--one of those irritating,  senseless, chuckle-headed, crack-jawed laughs of his.  They do make me so  wild.    I opened the bag and packed the boots in; and then, just as I was going  to close it, a horrible idea occurred to me.  Had I packed my  tooth-brush?  I don't know how it is, but I never do know whether I've  packed my tooth-brush.    My tooth-brush is a thing that haunts me when I'm travelling, and makes  my life a misery.  I dream that I haven't packed it, and wake up in a  cold perspiration, and get out of bed and hunt for it.  And, in the  morning, I pack it before I have used it, and have to unpack again to get  it, and it is always the last thing I turn out of the bag; and then I  repack and forget it, and have to rush upstairs for it at the last moment  and carry it to the railway station, wrapped up in my  pocket-handkerchief.    [Picture: Boot] Of course I had to turn every mortal thing out now, and,  of course, I could not find it.  I rummaged the things up into much the  same state that they must have been before the world was created, and  when chaos reigned.  Of course, I found George's and Harris's eighteen  times over, but I couldn't find my own.  I put the things back one by  one, and held everything up and shook it.  Then I found it inside a boot.  I repacked once more.    When I had finished, George asked if the soap was in.  I said I didn't  care a hang whether the soap was in or whether it wasn't; and I slammed  the bag to and strapped it, and found that I had packed my tobacco-pouch  in it, and had to re-open it.  It got shut up finally at 10.5 p.m., and  then there remained the hampers to do.  Harris said that we should be  wanting to start in less than twelve hours' time, and thought that he and  George had better do the rest; and I agreed and sat down, and they had a  go.    They began in a light-hearted spirit, evidently intending to show me how  to do it.  I made no comment; I only waited.  When George is hanged,  Harris will be the worst packer in this world; and I looked at the piles  of plates and cups, and kettles, and bottles and jars, and pies, and  stoves, and cakes, and tomatoes, &c., and felt that the thing would soon  become exciting.    It did.  They started with breaking a cup.  That was the first thing they  did.  They did that just to show you what they _could_ do, and to get you  interested.    Then Harris packed the strawberry jam on top of a tomato and squashed it,  and they had to pick out the tomato with a teaspoon.    And then it was George's turn, and he trod on the butter.  I didn't say  anything, but I came over and sat on the edge of the table and watched  them.  It irritated them more than anything I could have said.  I felt  that.  It made them nervous and excited, and they stepped on things, and  put things behind them, and then couldn't find them when they wanted  them; and they packed the pies at the bottom, and put heavy things on  top, and smashed the pies in.    They upset salt over everything, and as for the butter!  I never saw two  men do more with one-and-twopence worth of butter in my whole life than  they did.  After George had got it off his slipper, they tried to put it  in the kettle.  It wouldn't go in, and what _was_ in wouldn't come out.  They did scrape it out at last, and put it down on a chair, and Harris  sat on it, and it stuck to him, and they went looking for it all over the  room.    \"I'll take my oath I put it down on that chair,\" said George, staring at  the empty seat.    \"I saw you do it myself, not a minute ago,\" said Harris.    Then they started round the room again looking for it; and then they met  again in the centre, and stared at one another.    \"Most extraordinary thing I ever heard of,\" said George.    \"So mysterious!\" said Harris.    Then George got round at the back of Harris and saw it.    \"Why, here it is all the time,\" he exclaimed, indignantly.    \"Where?\" cried Harris, spinning round.    \"Stand still, can't you!\" roared George, flying after him.    And they got it off, and packed it in the teapot.    Montmorency was in it all, of course.  Montmorency's ambition in life, is  to get in the way and be sworn at.  If he can squirm in anywhere where he  particularly is not wanted, and be a perfect nuisance, and make people  mad, and have things thrown at his head, then he feels his day has not  been wasted.    To get somebody to stumble over him, and curse him steadily for an hour,  is his highest aim and object; and, when he has succeeded in  accomplishing this, his conceit becomes quite unbearable.    He came and sat down on things, just when they were wanted to be packed;  and he laboured under the fixed belief that, whenever Harris or George  reached out their hand for anything, it was his cold, damp nose that they  wanted.  He put his leg into the jam, and he worried the teaspoons, and  he pretended that the lemons were rats, and got into the hamper and  killed three of them before Harris could land him with the frying-pan.    Harris said I encouraged him.  I didn't encourage him.  A dog like that  don't want any encouragement.  It's the natural, original sin that is  born in him that makes him do things like that.    The packing was done at 12.50; and Harris sat on the big hamper, and said  he hoped nothing would be found broken.  George said that if anything was  broken it was broken, which reflection seemed to comfort him.  He also  said he was ready for bed.  We were all ready for bed.  Harris was to  sleep with us that night, and we went upstairs.    We tossed for beds, and Harris had to sleep with me.  He said:    \"Do you prefer the inside or the outside, J.?\"    I said I generally preferred to sleep _inside_ a bed.    Harris said it was old.    George said:    \"What time shall I wake you fellows?\"    Harris said:    \"Seven.\"    I said:    \"No--six"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30802"],[0,"Commentaries on the Laws of England, Book the First (#7)"],[1,"choice. Neither need  they apprehend too long an avocation hereby from their private  concerns and amusements, or (what is a more noble object) the service  of their friends and their country. This study will go hand in hand  with their other pursuits: it will obstruct none of them; it will  ornament and assist them all.    BUT if, upon the whole, there are any still wedded to monastic  prejudice, that can entertain a doubt how far this study is properly  and regularly _academical_, such persons I am afraid either have not  considered the constitution and design of an university, or else think  very meanly of it. It must be a deplorable narrowness of mind, that  would confine these seats of instruction to the limited views of one  or two learned professions. To the praise of this age be it spoken, a  more open and generous way of thinking begins now universally to  prevail. The attainment of liberal and genteel accomplishments, though  not of the intellectual sort, has been thought by our wisest and most  affectionate patrons[c], and very lately by the whole university[d],  no small improvement of our antient plan of education; and therefore I  may safely affirm that nothing (how _unusual_ soever) is, under due  regulations, improper to be _taught_ in this place, which is proper  for a gentleman to _learn_. But that a science, which distinguishes  the criterions of right and wrong; which teaches to establish the one,  and prevent, punish, or redress the other; which employs in it's  theory the noblest faculties of the soul, and exerts in it's practice  the cardinal virtues of the heart; a science, which is universal in  it's use and extent, accommodated to each individual, yet  comprehending the whole community; that a science like this should  have ever been deemed unnecessary to be studied in an university, is  matter of astonishment and concern. Surely, if it were not before an  object of academical knowlege, it was high time to make it one; and to  those who can doubt the propriety of it's reception among us (if any  such there be) we may return an answer in their own way; that ethics  are confessedly a branch of academical learning, and Aristotle  _himself has said_, speaking of the laws of his own country, that  jurisprudence or the knowlege of those laws is the principal and  most[e] perfect branch of ethics.    [Footnote c: Lord chancellor Clarendon, in his dialogue of education,  among his tracts, p. 325. appears to have been very solicitous, that  it might be made \"a part of the ornament of our learned academies to  teach the qualities of riding, dancing, and fencing, at those hours  when more serious exercises should be intermitted.\"]    [Footnote d: By accepting in full convocation the remainder of lord  Clarendon's history from his noble descendants, on condition to apply  the profits arising from it's publication to the establishment of a  _manage_ in the university.]    [Footnote e: [Greek: Teleia malista arete, hoti tes teleias aretes  chresis esti.] _Ethic. ad Nicomach._ _l._ 5. _c._ 3.]    FROM a thorough conviction of this truth, our munificent benefactor Mr  VINER, having employed above half a century in amassing materials for  new modelling and rendering more commodious the rude study of the laws  of the land, consigned both the plan and execution of these his  public-spirited designs to the wisdom of his parent university.  Resolving to dedicate his learned labours \"to the benefit of posterity  and the perpetual service of his country[f],\" he was sensible he could  not perform his resolutions in a better and more effectual manner,  than by extending to the youth of this place those assistances, of  which he so well remembered and so heartily regretted the want. And  the sense, which the university has entertained of this ample and most  useful benefaction, must appear beyond a doubt from their gratitude in  receiving it with all possible marks of esteem[g]; from their alacrity  and unexampled dispatch in carrying it into execution[h]; and, above  all, from the laws and constitutions by which they have effectually  guarded it from the neglect and abuse to which such institutions are  liable[i]. We have seen an universal emulation, who best should  understand, or most faithfully pursue, the designs of our generous  patron: and with pleasure we recollect, that those who are most  distinguished by their quality, their fortune, their station, their  learning, or their experience, have appeared the most zealous to  promote the success of Mr Viner's establishment.    [Footnote f: See the preface to the eighteenth volume of his  abridgment.]    [Footnote g: Mr Viner is enrolled among the public benefactors of the  university by decree of convocation.]    [Footnote h: Mr Viner died June 5, 1756. His effects were collected  and settled, near a volume of his work printed, almost the whole  disposed of, and the accounts made up, in a year and a half from his  decease, by the very diligent and worthy administrators with the will  annexed, (Dr West and Dr Good of Magdalene, Dr Whalley of Oriel, Mr  Buckler of All Souls, and Mr Betts of University college) to whom that  care was consigned by the university. Another half year was employed  in considering and settling a plan of the proposed institution, and in  framing the statutes thereupon, which were finally confirmed by  convocation on the 3d of July, 1758. The professor was elected on  the 20th of October following, and two scholars on the succeeding  day. And, lastly, it was agreed at the annual audit in 1761, to  establish a fellowship; and a fellow was accordingly elected in  January following.--The residue of this fund, arising from the sale of  Mr Viner's abridgment, will probably be sufficient hereafter to found  another fellowship and scholarship, or three more scholarships, as  shall be thought most expedient.]    [Footnote i: The statutes are in substance as follows:    1. THAT the accounts of this benefaction be separately kept, and  annually audited by the delegates of accounts and professor, and  afterwards reported to convocation.    2. THAT a professorship of the laws of England be established, with a  salary of two hundred pounds _per annum_; the professor to be elected  by convocation, and to be at the time of his election at least a  master of arts or bachelor of civil law in the university of Oxford,  of ten years standing from his matriculation; and also a barrister at  law of four years standing at the bar.    3. THAT such professor (by himself, or by deputy to be previously  approved by convocation) do read one solemn public lecture on the laws  of England, and in the English language, in every academical term, at  certain stated times previous to the commencement of the common law  term; or forfeit twenty pounds for every omission to Mr Viner's  general fund: and also (by himself, or by deputy to be approved, if  occasional, by the vice-chancellor and proctors; or, if permanent,  both the cause and the deputy to be annually approved by convocation)  do yearly read one complete course of lectures on the laws of England,  and in the English language, consisting of sixty lectures at the  least, to be read during the university term time, with such proper  intervals that not more than four lectures may fall within any single  week: that the professor do give a month's notice of the time when the  course is to begin, and do read _gratis_ to the scholars of Mr Viner's  foundation; but may demand of other auditors such gratuity as shall be  settled from time to time by decree of convocation: and that, for  every of the said sixty lectures omitted, the professor, on complaint  made to the vice-chancellor within the year, do forfeit forty  shillings to Mr Viner's general fund; the proof of having performed  his duty to lie upon the said professor.    4. THAT every professor do continue in his office during life, unless  in case of such misbehaviour as shall amount to bannition by the  university statutes; or unless he deserts the profession of the law by  betaking himself to another profession; or unless, after one  admonition by the vice-chancellor and proctors for notorious neglect,  he is guilty of another flagrant omission: in any of which cases he be  deprived by the vice-chancellor, with consent of the house of  convocation.    5. THAT such a number of fellowships with a stipend of fifty pounds  _per annum_, and scholarships with a stipend of thirty pounds be  established, as the convocation shall from time to time ordain,  according to the state of Mr Viner's revenues.    6. THAT every fellow be elected by convocation, and at the time of  election be unmarried, and at least a master of arts or bachelor of  civil law, and a member of some college or hall in the university of  Oxford; the scholars of this foundation or such as have been scholars  (if qualified and approved of by convocation) to have the preference:  that, if not a barrister when chosen, he be called to the bar within  one year after his election; but do reside in the university two  months in every year, or in case of non-residence do forfeit the  stipend of that year to Mr Viner's general fund.    7. THAT every scholar be elected by convocation, and at the time of  election be unmarried, and a member of some college or hall in the  university of Oxford, who shall have been matriculated twenty four  calendar months at the least: that he do take the degree of bachelor  of civil law with all convenient speed; (either proceeding in arts or  otherwise) and previous to his taking the same, between the second and  eighth year from his matriculation, be bound to attend two courses of  the professor's lectures, to be certified under the professor's hand;  and within one year after taking the same be called to the bar: that  he do annually reside six months till he is of four years standing,  and four months from that time till he is master of arts or bachelor  of civil "]]]
