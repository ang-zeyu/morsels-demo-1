The low rasping went past close at hand, then to the right, then back,  and seemed going away. Rag felt he knew what he was about; he wasn't  a baby; it was his duty to learn what it was. He slowly raised his  rolypoly body on his short fluffy legs, lifted his little round head  above the covering of his nest and peeped out into the woods. The sound  had ceased as soon as he moved. He saw nothing, so took one step forward  to a clear view, and instantly found himself face to face with an  enormous Black Serpent.    \"Mammy,\" he screamed in mortal terror as the monster darted at him. With  all the strength of his tiny limbs he tried to run. But in a flash the  Snake had him by one ear and whipped around him with his coils to gloat  over the helpless little baby bunny he had secured for dinner.    \"Mam-my--Mam-my,\" gasped poor little Raggylug as the cruel monster began  slowly choking him to death. Very soon the little one's cry would have  ceased, but bounding through the woods straight as an arrow came Mammy.  No longer a shy, helpless little Molly Cottontail, ready to fly from  a shadow: the mother's love was strong in her. The cry of her baby had  filled her with the courage of a hero, and--hop, she went over that  horrible reptile. Whack, she struck down at him with her sharp hind  claws as she passed, giving him such a stinging blow that he squirmed  with pain and hissed with anger.    \"M-a-m-my,\" came feebly from the little one. And Mammy came leaping  again and again and struck harder and fiercer until the loathsome  reptile let go the little one's ear and tried to bite the old one as  she leaped over. But all he got was a mouthful of wool each time, and  Molly's fierce blows began to tell, as long bloody rips were torn in the  Black Snake's scaly armor.    Things were now looking bad for the Snake; and bracing himself for the  next charge, he lost his tight hold on Baby Bunny, who at once wriggled  out of the coils and away into the underbrush, breathless and terribly  frightened, but unhurt save that his left ear was much torn by the teeth  of that dreadful Serpent.    Molly now had gained all she wanted. She had no notion of fighting  for glory or revenge. Away she went into the woods and the little one  followed the shining beacon of her snow-white tail until she led him to  a safe corner of the Swamp.    II    Old Olifant's Swamp was a rough, brambly tract of second-growth woods,  with a marshy pond and a stream through the middle. A few ragged  remnants of the old forest still stood in it and a few of the still  older trunks were lying about as dead logs in the brushwood. The land  about the pond was of that willow-grown sedgy kind that cats and horses  avoid, but that cattle do not fear. The drier zones were overgrown with  briars and young trees. The outermost belt of all, that next the fields,  was of thrifty, gummy-trunked young pines whose living needles in air  and dead ones on earth offer so delicious an odor to the nostrils of the  passer-by, and so deadly a breath to those seedlings that would compete  with them for the worthless waste they grow on.    All around for a long way were smooth fields, and the only wild tracks  that ever crossed these fields were those of a thoroughly bad and  unscrupulous fox that lived only too near.    The chief indwellers of the swamp were Molly and Rag. Their nearest  neighbors were far away, and their nearest kin were dead. This was their  home, and here they lived together, and here Rag received the training  that made his success in life.    Molly was a good little mother and gave him a careful bringing up. The  first thing he learned was to lie low and say nothing. His adventure  with the snake taught him the wisdom of this. Rag never forgot that  lesson; afterward he did as he was told, and it made the other things  come more easily.    The second lesson he learned was 'freeze.' It grows out of the first,  and Rag was taught it as soon as he could run.    'Freezing' is simply doing nothing, turning into a statue. As soon as he  finds a foe near, no matter what he is doing, a well-trained Cottontail  keeps just as he is and stops all movement, for the creatures of the  woods are of the same color as the things in the woods and catch the eye  only while moving. So when enemies chance together, the one who first  sees the other can keep himself unseen by 'freezing' and thus have all  the advantage of choosing the time for attack or escape. Only those who  live in the woods know the importance of this; every wild creature and  every hunter must learn it; all learn to do it well, but not one of them  can beat Molly Cottontail in the doing. Rag's mother taught him this  trick by example. When the white cotton cushion that she always carried  to sit on went bobbing away through the woods, of course Rag ran his  hardest to keep up. But when Molly stopped and 'froze,' the natural wish  to copy made him do the same.    But the best lesson of all that Rag learned from his mother was the  secret of the Brierbrush. It is a very old secret now, and to make it  plain you must first hear why the Brierbrush quarrelled with the beasts.    Long ago the Roses used to grow on bushes that had no thorns. But the  Squirrels and Mice used to climb after them, the Cattle used to knock  them off with their horns, the Possum would twitch them off with his  long tail, and the Deer, with his sharp hoofs, would break them down.  So the Brierbrush armed itself with spikes to protect its roses and  declared eternal war on all creatures that climbed trees, or had horns,  or hoofs, or long tails. This left the Brierbrush at peace with none but  Molly Cottontail, who could not climb, was hornless, hoofless, and had  scarcely any tail at all.    In truth the Cottontail had never harmed a Brierrose, and having now so  many enemies the Rose took the Rabbit into especial friendship, and when  dangers are threatening poor Bunny he flies to the nearest Brierbrush,  certain that it is ready with a million keen and poisoned daggers to  defend him.    So the secret that Rag learned from his mother was, \"The Brierbrush is  your best friend.\"    Much of the time that season was spent in learning the lay of the land,  and the bramble and brier mazes. And Rag learned them so well that he  could go all around the swamp by two different ways and never leave the  friendly briers at any place for more than five hops.    It is not long since the foes of the Cottontails were disgusted to find  that man had brought a new kind of bramble and planted it in long lines  throughout the country. It was so strong that no creatures could break  it down, and so sharp that the toughest skin was torn by it. Each year  there was more of it and each year it became a more serious matter to  the wild creatures. But Molly Cottontail had no fear of it. She was not  brought up in the briers for nothing. Dogs and foxes, cattle and sheep,  and even man himself might be torn by those fearful spikes: but Molly  understands it and lives and thrives under it. And the further it  spreads the more safe country there is for the Cottontail. And the name  of this new and dreaded bramble is--the barbed-wire fence.     III    Molly had no other children to look after now, so Rag had all her  care. He was unusually quick and bright as well as strong, and he had  uncommonly good chances; so he got on remarkably well.    All the season she kept him busy learning the tricks of the trail, and  what to eat and drink and what not to touch. Day by day she worked  to train him; little by little she taught him, putting into his mind  hundreds of ideas that her own life or early training had stored in  hers, and so equipped him with the knowledge that makes life possible to  their kind.    Close by her side in the clover-field or the thicket he would sit and  copy her when she wobbled her nose 'to keep her smeller clear,' and pull  the bite from her mouth or taste her lips to make sure he was getting  the same kind of fodder. Still copying her, he learned to comb his ears  with his claws and to dress his coat and to bite the burrs out of his  vest and socks. He learned, too, that nothing but clear dewdrops from  the briers were fit for a rabbit to drink, as water which has once  touched the earth must surely bear some taint. Thus he began the study  of woodcraft, the oldest of all sciences.    As soon as Rag was big enough to go out alone, his mother taught him the  signal code. Rabbits telegraph each other by thumping on the ground with  their hind feet. Along the ground sound carries far; a thump that at six  feet from the earth is not heard at twenty yards will, near the ground,  be heard at least one hundred yards. Rabbits have very keen hearing, and  so might hear this same thump at two hundred yards, and that would reach  from end to end of Olifant's Swamp. A single thump means 'look out'  or 'freeze.' A slow thump thump means 'come.' A fast thump thump means  'danger'; and a very fast thump thump thump means 'run for dear life.'    At another time, when the weather was fine and the bluejays were  quarrelling among themselves, a sure sign that no dangerous foe was  about, Rag began a new study. Molly, by flattening her ears, gave  the sign to squat. Then she ran far away in the thicket and gave the  thumping signal for 'come.' Rag set out at a run to the place but could  not find Molly. He thumped, but got no reply. Setting carefully about  his search he found her foot-scent and, following this strange guide,  that the beasts all know so well and man does not know at all, he worked  out the trail and found her where she was hidden. Thus he got his first  lesson in trailing, and thus it was that the games of hide and seek they  played became the schooling for the serious chase of which there was so  much in his after life.    Before that first season of schooling was over he had"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30310"],[0,"Special Report on Diseases of Cattle (#7)"],[1,"ter. It is also advantageous in such cases to give two  heaped teaspoonsfuls of wood charcoal, mixed with the animal's feed three  times a day. The animal should also go out during the day, as want of  exercise favors the continuance of this form of indigestion. If the dung is  hard, the constipation should be overcome by feeding a little flaxseed  twice daily or by giving a handful of Glauber's salt in the feed once or  twice daily, as may be necessary. Roots, silage, and other succulent feeds  are useful in this connection. If tuberculosis is suspected as the cause of  chronic bloating, a skilled veterinarian should make a diagnosis, using the  tuberculin test if necessary. Until it is settled that the cow has not  tuberculosis, she should be kept apart from the other members of the herd.      DISTENTION OF RUMEN OR PAUNCH WITH FEED.    This form of indigestion is caused by the animal gorging itself with feed,  and arises more from the animal's voracious appetite than from any defect  in the quality of the feed supplied to it. The condition is, however, more  severe if the feed consumed is especially concentrated or difficult of  digestion. In cases of this kind there is comparatively no great formation  of gas, and the gas which is formed is diffused through the stomach instead  of accumulating in a layer in its upper part. On pressing the flank with  the closed fist the indent of the hand remains for a short time in the  flank, as if the rumen were filled with a soft, doughy mass.    This form of indigestion should be treated by stimulants, such as aromatic  spirits of ammonia.    If the formation of gas is not great and the distention with solid material  is somewhat limited, the animal may be drenched through a piece of ordinary  garden hose, one end inserted in the mouth, and the other end fitted with a  funnel, giving 1-1/2 pounds of Epsom salt or Glauber's salt dissolved in 2  gallons of water, at a single dose. Immediately after this treatment the  left side of the animal, extending below the median line of the abdomen,  should be powerfully kneaded with the fist, so that the impacted food mass  will be broken, allowing the water to separate it into small portions which  can be carried downward for the process of digestion. But if the treatment  fails and the impacted or overloaded condition of the rumen continues, it  may become necessary to make an incision with a sharp, long-bladed knife in  the left flank, commencing at the point where it is usual to puncture the  stomach of an ox, and prolong the incision in a downward direction until it  is long enough to admit the hand. When the point of the knife is thrust  into the flank and the blade cuts downward, the wall of the stomach, the  muscle, and the skin should all be cut through at the same time. Two  assistants should hold the edges of the wound together so as to prevent any  food from slipping between the flank and the wall of the stomach, and then  the operator should remove two-third [sic] of the contents of the rumen.  This having been done, the edges of the wound should be sponged with a  little carbolized warm water, and, the lips of the wound in the rumen being  turned inward, they should be brought together with catgut stitches. The  wound penetrating the muscle and the skin may then be brought together by  silk stitches, which should pass through the entire thickness of the muscle  and should be about 1 inch apart. The wound should afterwards be dressed  once a day with a lotion and the animal covered with a tight linen sheet,  to protect the wound from insects and dirt. The lotion to be used in such  case is made up as follows: Sulphate of zinc, 1 dram; carbolic acid, 2  drams; glycerin, 2 ounces; water, 14 ounces; mix. It is clear that this  operation requires special skill and it should be attempted only by those  who are competent.      IMAGINARY DISEASES (HOLLOW HORN; LOSS OF CUD; WOLF IN THE TAIL).    It would appear quite in place here, in connection with the diseases of the  stomach and bowels of cattle, to consider the three old fallacies or  superstitions known by the above names, since these names, whenever and  wherever used, seem to be invariably applied to some form of digestive  derangement or disease having its origin in the stomach and bowels.    HOLLOW HORN.--In the first place it should be noted that the horns of all  animals of the ox tribe are hollow. The horn cores are elongations of the  frontal bones of the skull, and the frontal sinuses, which are the larger  of the air spaces of the head, are prolonged into the horn cores. When a  cow is sick, if the horns are hot it is an evidence of fever; if they are  cold it indicates impaired circulation of the blood; but these  manifestations of sickness are to be regarded as symptoms of some  constitutional disorder and do not in themselves require treatment. The  treatment should be applied to the disease which causes the abnormal  temperature of the horns. The usual treatment for the supposed hollow horn,  which consists in boring the horns with a gimlet and pouring turpentine  into the openings thus made, is not only useless and cruel, but is liable  to set up an acute inflammation and result in an abscess of the sinus.    LOSS OF CUD.--The so-called loss of cud is simply a cessation of  rumination, frequently one of the first indications of some form of  disease, since ruminants stop chewing the cud when they feel sick. Loss of  cud is a symptom of a great many diseases, and when it is detected it  should lead the observer to try to discover other symptoms upon which to  base a correct opinion as to the nature of the disease from which the  animal suffers. No local treatment is required.    WOLF IN THE TAIL.--This term also seems to be vaguely applied to various  disturbances of the digestive function, or to some disease which is in  reality in the stomach or bowels.      VOMITING.    Vomiting is not to be confounded with rumination, though some writers have  advanced the opinion that it is merely a disordered and irregular  rumination. It is not of common occurrence in cattle.    _Symptoms._--Animals which vomit are frequently in poor condition. After  having eaten tranquilly for some time the animal suddenly becomes uneasy,  arches the back, stretches the neck and head, and then suddenly ejects 10  to 12 pounds of the contents of the rumen. After having done this the  uneasiness subsides and in a short time the animal resumes eating as if  nothing had happened.    _Cause._--The cause of this disordered state of the digestive system in  cattle is usually obscure, but has in some cases been traced to a partial  closure of the opening into the second stomach or to a distention of the  esophagus. It has been found to occur when there was cancerous disease of  the fourth stomach, and experimentally it has been shown that a suspension  of digestion or great derangement of this stomach produces considerable  nervous disorder of the rumen and sometimes vomiting or attempts to vomit.    TREATMENT.--Easily digested feed and plenty of water should be given. Fear  and excitement, chasing, or hurrying animals after they have eaten heartily  are liable to bring on this result. In order to overcome irritation which  may produce vomiting the following draft should be given: Hydrate of  chloral, half an ounce; water, 1 pint. The dose must be repeated when the  condition of the animal seems to require it. As a rule, treatment is not  successful.      DEPRAVED APPETITE (PICA).    Cattle suffering from this disease have a capricious and variable appetite  as regards their ordinary feed but evince a strong desire to lick and eat  substances for which healthy cattle show no inclination. Alkaline and  saline-tasting substances are especially attractive to cattle having a  depraved appetite and they frequently lick lime, earth, coal, gravel, and  even the dung of other cattle. Cows in calf and young cattle are especially  liable to develop these symptoms. Animals affected in this way lose  condition, their coat is staring, gait slow, and small vesicles containing  yellow liquid form under the tongue; the milk given by such cows is thin  and watery. Such animals become restless and uneasy, as is indicated by  frequent bellowing. The disease may last for months, the animal ultimately  dying emaciated and exhausted. Depraved appetite frequently precedes the  condition in which the bones of cattle become brittle and fracture easily,  which is known as osteomalacia.    _Cause._--From the fact that this disease is largely one of regions, it is  generally believed that some condition of the soil and water and of the  local vegetation is responsible for it. It is more prevalent some years  than others, and is most common in old countries, where the soil is more or  less depleted. Cattle pastured on low, swampy land become predisposed to  it. It occasionally happens, however, that one individual in a herd suffers  though all are fed alike; in such cases the disease must arise from the  affected animal's imperfect assimilation of the nutritive elements of the  feed which is supplied to it.    _Treatment._--The aim in such cases must be to improve the process of  digestion and to supply the animal with a sufficiency of sound and  wholesome feed. The following should be given to the cow three times a day,  a heaping tablespoonful constituting a dose: Carbonate of iron, 4 ounces;  finely ground bone or \"bone flour,\" 1 pound; powdered gentian, 4 ounces;  common salt, 8 ounces; powdered fenugreek, 4 ounces; mix. In addition to  this, 3 tablespoonfuls of powdered charcoal may be mixed with the feed  three times a day, and a piece of rock salt should be placed where the  animal can lick it at will. German veterinarians have had brilliant results  from the treatment of this disease with subcutaneous injections of  apomorphin in doses of 1-1/2 to 5 grains for three or four days.
