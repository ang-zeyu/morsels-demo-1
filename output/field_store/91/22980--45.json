The reason the wheel looks so strikingly beautiful in _Brachionus_ is  owing to the long cilia which is longer in this genus than in other  genera of this great family.    The foot of _Brachionus_ is more curious than that of the Skeleton. It  is telescopic, and the little animal has the most perfect control over  it. He can draw it within the body so that it looks like a ball, and  again quickly thrust it out and whisk it around in all directions like a  tail. It has two short toes at the end which can be separated or brought  together at pleasure. And he can firmly anchor himself by the toes and  stretch forward, showing you the great length of the foot. Now he rolls  from side to side without letting go his hold and performs other strange  feats, and all the while the wheels are rapidly revolving, he has  stopped his headlong career through the water and has settled down to  get his supper.    _Fig. 3_ represents one of the largest rotifers with which I am  acquainted. I have never been able to find a description or engraving  of it in any work on microscopy. But it is probably well known to  microscopists, for it has a wide range. I have found it in New  Hampshire, New Jersey and Florida.    You cannot get a true idea of its graceful beauty from the drawing, as  it is represented as it was seen in the live box with sufficient  pressure upon it to keep it from moving, while serving as a model. And  no engraving, however perfect, can give you any idea of its brilliant  transparency and delicate coloring.    The play of the muscles and internal organs are plainly visible, and you  can always tell what he has chosen for dinner. Diatoms and desmids form  a portion of his diet. His mouth is below the wheel. When he is hungry  he anchors himself by his forked tail and sets his wheel in rapid  motion, which makes a powerful current sufficient to bring quite large  objects to his head, frequently too large to admit into the mouth. He  will often repeatedly try to take a desmid entirely too large for his  mouth, and his manoeuvres are quite comical as he whirls it round and  round, nipping it on all sides. You will see by looking at the figure  that everything has to be swallowed or taken within the body before it  reaches the mouth. While the desmid is within the body the rotifer has  control over it sufficient to take it into the mouth if it is of the  right size, but if it is too large he soon becomes disgusted and ejects  it with a sudden movement which sends it whirling rapidly away. And now  he takes a smaller one and his jaws work vigorously a moment or two,  when he swallows it almost entire, and we can plainly see the pretty  markings and brilliant green color after it has passed into the stomach.    This large rotifer is plainly visible to the naked eye, and you will  find it in both shallow and deep ponds, wherever water plants grow,  during the months of July and August.      XI.--ON THE BEACH.    Many of our young people spend the month of August at the seaside, and  if those who wish to learn something of the curious microscopic animals  will stroll along the beach when the tide has receded, until they come  to rocky places and little pools filled with salt water and various  marine plants, they will find a form of animal life quite different from  that in fresh water ponds. These little pools along the rocky coast are  the homes of countless numbers of zoophytes--animals which have a  stronger resemblance to plants and flowers than any we have found in  fresh water.    Look for specimens for microscopic work on the surface of the rocks, on  dead sea shells, and on the sea-weeds. On the sea-weeds you will often  find a white filmy network which to the unassisted eye looks like simple  white threads running and spreading in every direction, and at every  angle of the network a tiny stem shoots up, branching out like a tree  and making a miniature forest.    Now if you apply a low power of the microscope, you will find the little  forest is made up of a strange animal called _Laomeda geniculata_.  (_Fig. 1._) Each branch of this compound animal terminates and expands  into a lovely vase and is the home of a polype. The polype is not a  separate individual any more than the end of a growing branch is  separate from the tree on which it grows.      [Illustration: LAOMEDA.]    When the creature is hungry he sends out from the margin of the vase  from fifteen to twenty tentacles, ranged around the rim like the petals  of a flower. _Figure 1_ shows one of these expanded polypes as seen  through the microscope.    The tentacles or feelers are fishing rods to bring game to the fleshy  mouth which is protruded from the centre of the vase. A great many such  mouths surrounded with their tentacles are necessary to feed this  singular compound creature.    All that I can tell you of these microscopic animals will be nothing  compared to a study of them with your own eyes, so I will only give you  hints of what you may expect, thereby hoping to create sufficient  interest to induce you to stroll to out-of-the-way places, where you may  find many of Nature's marvellous works. We want more field workers in  every department of Natural History, and especially in microscopy where  unexplored fields are awaiting you.    When the tide has receded, various objects of interest will meet your  eye at every step. Look at that old dead sea shell covered with a rough,  shaggy nap. Ah, as we approach, the shell is moving off! What can it  mean? Why, it means that a hermit crab has set up housekeeping in the  old shell, and he, no doubt, thinks us suspicious characters and wants  none of our company. But we are after microscopic objects now, and this  hermit, interesting as he is, is not to claim our attention to-day. The  rough coat on the outside of the shell is of more interest.    With the aid of a pocket lens you will find it another zoophyte. You  can see the polypes, as thick as they can well stand, rising erect and  straight from the shaggy coat like a miniature field of wheat. With a  higher power you will see that each mouth is surrounded with tentacles  like those of _Laomeda_, but yet it is quite a different looking  creature. If we touch one of these polypes ever so lightly, the great  army immediately close their tentacles, for the same life pervades the  entire colony, and those on the extreme outer edge feel the contact as  quickly as the one we touched.      [Illustration: LARES.]    One of the most comical and amusing creatures of all the zoophyte tribe,  is figured and described by Mr. Gosse under the name of _Lar  Sabellarum_. He was the first observer of this curious creature; he  found it inhabiting the outer edge of the tube of a worm--the Sabella.  So when you are looking for microscopic objects do not overlook any tube  that you may see standing above the surface of sand and mud, as it may  be surrounded by this singular zoophyte. The tubes usually extend an  inch or two above the surface, and about as far below. I have found the  tubes surrounded with the creatures, but not in as good condition for  investigation as those Mr. Gosse mentions. Mine were too thick and  crowded to distinguish clearly. But as Mr. Gosse describes them, they  have a most close resemblance to the human figure as they stand erect  around the mouth of the tube of Sabella.    A loose network surrounds the top of the tube and the strange forms  spring from the angles of the meshes. The creatures are furnished with  heads, and immediately below the head are two arms. (_Fig. 2._) The head  moves to and fro on the neck, while the arms are tossed wildly about as  if gesticulating in the most earnest manner. Or, as in the wild and  disorderly dances of savages the body sways back and forth while the  arms are thrown upward and downward in a frantic way.    One summer I found a colony standing so thickly together that they did  not show off to very good advantage. Apparently they were like a packed  army of Liliputians, striking out with their arms and struggling with  one another. But when I came to observe them more carefully, I found  they were not interfering with one another at all, but each was intent  on his own business of obtaining a livelihood.      [Illustration: HAND OF BARNACLE.]    The Sabella which inhabits the tube, is of itself a most attractive  object. Most elegant fringed filaments proceed from the head, and wave  back and forth like a fan, and near the ends of these delicate slender  filaments are little black balls, supposed to be eyes. If they are eyes,  the Sabella has no lack of vision, and this may account for his seeming  watchfulness. He is always on the alert and drops down into his house at  any approach. Only with the utmost caution will you have an opportunity  to leisurely look at his rare beauty.    When for the first time I saw this elegant, beautiful creature rising  out of the tube, and waving its fringed fan-like filaments, I did not  wonder at Mr. Gosse's enthusiasm. Neither was I surprised that he should  be reminded of the old Roman mythology and call the zoophytes which  surround the tube, \"Lares,\" for the rare beauty of Sabella would suggest  the protection of guardian spirits. He says:    \"These curious creatures have afforded much entertainment, not only to  myself, but to those scientific friends to whom I have had opportunities  of exhibiting them. When I see them surrounding the mansion of the  Sabella, gazing, as it were, after him as he retreats into his castle,  flinging their wild arms over its entrance, and keeping watch with  untiring vigilance until he reappears, it seems to require no very vivid  fancy to imagine them so many guardian demons; and the Lares of the old  Roman mythology occurring to memory, I described the form under the  scientific appellation of _Lar Sabellarum_.

SPECIES THAT OCCUR ON THE PACIFIC AND GULF LOWLANDS. This group  includes 19 species, or 53 per cent of the total amphibian fauna. Of  these, nine species (25 per cent of the entire amphibian fauna) are  widespread throughout the lowlands of Mexico and Central America; these  are:         _Gymnopis mexicanus_       _Rhinophrynus dorsalis_       _Bufo marinus_       _Engystomops pustulosus_       _Leptodactylus labialis_       _Leptodactylus melanonotus_       _Hyla baudini_       _Hyla staufferi_       _Rana pipiens_    Four species occur on the Gulf lowlands to the east and to the west of  the isthmus, but on the Pacific lowlands they occur only to the east;  this group includes _Bufo valliceps_, _Eleutherodactylus rhodopis_,  _Phrynohyas modesta_, and _Phrynohyas spilomma_. Three species live to  the east and to the west of the isthmus on the Pacific lowlands, but  only to the west on the Gulf lowlands; these include _Eleutherodactylus  rugulosus_, _Microbatrachylus pygmaeus_, and _Gastrophryne usta_.    Six species that cross the isthmus live on the humid Gulf lowlands and  on the humid lowlands of Chiapas and Guatemala, but not on the  semi-arid Plains of Tehuantepec; these include _Bolitoglossa  occidentalis_, _Eleutherodactylus rhodopis_, _Microbatrachylus  pygmaeus_, _Phrynohyas modesta_, _Phrynohyas spilomma_, and _Rana  palmipes_. Of these, _Microbatrachylus pygmaeus_ also occurs in  scattered humid environments to the west of the isthmus on the Pacific  lowlands.    Two species are endemic to the isthmian region. _Bolitoglossa  veracrucis_ is known only from the humid northern slopes of the  isthmus. _Hylella sumichrasti_ occurs on the Pacific slopes of the  isthmus and extends to the east into western Chiapas.    In analyzing the distribution of the amphibians with respect to those  that are restricted to either the Pacific or Gulf lowlands or those  that cross the continental divide in the isthmus, we find that 25 per  cent of the species are restricted to the Gulf lowlands, 17 per cent  are restricted to the Pacific lowlands, and 53 per cent cross the  isthmus. In analyzing the distribution patterns with respect to those  that extend across the isthmus of Tehuantepec from east to west, we  find that 14 per cent of the species do not extend east of the isthmus  into Central America and that 19 per cent do not range west of the  isthmus into Mexico proper; 61 per cent of the species range to the  east and to the west of the isthmus. Of the 36 species of amphibians  inhabiting the isthmus only nine species (25 per cent) range across the  isthmus, that is, occur on the Gulf and Pacific lowlands, and also  range to the east and to the west of the isthmus. To these wide-ranging  species the diversified environments of the isthmus do not present a  barrier to distribution. The other 27 species (75 per cent) either do  not cross the isthmus from east to west or from north to south; thus,  probably in one way or another the isthmus presents a barrier to their  distribution.          THE AMPHIBIAN FAUNA OF THE FOOTHILLS AND ADJACENT HIGHLANDS      To amphibians inhabiting the foothills and mountains of southern Mexico  and northern Central America, the isthmus presents a great barrier to  dispersal. For example, salamanders of the genus _Thorius_, the  _mexicanus_ and _augusti_ groups of the genus _Eleutherodactylus_, the  _bistincta_ group of the genus _Hyla_, and the genus _Tomodactylus_  occur on the Mexican Plateau and southward into the mountains of  Oaxaca. Nevertheless, no members of these groups are present in the  Guatemalan-Chiapan Highlands. The genera _Chiropterotriton_,  _Magnadigita_, _Pseudoeurycea_, and _Ptychohyla_, as well as the  _eximia_ group of _Hyla_ are represented by different species in the  Guatemalan-Chiapan Highlands than in the mountains of Mexico on the  other side of the isthmus. Several species of _Plectrohyla_ occur in  the Guatemalan-Chiapan Highlands, but none is known from the Mexican  Highlands, although one species occurs in the Tuxtlas.    Living in the humid forests of the foothills are salamanders of the  genus _Lineatriton_, frogs of the _spatulatus_ group of  _Eleutherodactylus_, _Anotheca coronata_, _Hyla miotympanum_, and  _Phyllomedusa moreleti_. All of these occur in the foothills of the  Sierra Madre Oriental in eastern Mexico and in Los Tuxtlas.  _Lineatriton_, _Hyla miotympanum_, and the _spatulatus_ group of  _Eleutherodactylus_ do not occur in the foothills of the  Guatemalan-Chiapan Highlands; those amphibians reach the end of their  ranges at the isthmus. _Phyllomedusa moreleti_ and _Anotheca coronata_  are found in the northern foothills of the Guatemalan-Chiapan  Highlands, and _Phyllomedusa moreleti_ is found in the foothills on the  Pacific slopes of the Chiapan Highlands.    Although the above analysis is not so detailed as that of the lowland  inhabitants, it does show that all of the genera and species of  amphibians known to inhabit the foothills and highlands adjacent to the  isthmus, only two species of amphibians cross the isthmus from one  highland mass to the other. Thus, it is evident that the Isthmus of  Tehuantepec presents a great barrier to dispersal of these groups of  amphibians.          ESTABLISHMENT OF PRESENT PATTERNS OF DISTRIBUTION      From the foregoing analysis of geographical and ecological distribution  in the Isthmus of Tehuantepec we may strive for an interpretation of  the events that led to the establishment of patterns of distribution  displayed not only by the amphibians, but other terrestrial vertebrates  as well. The thesis that I am proposing below is based on the premise  that in southern Mexico and northern Central America climatic  fluctuation during the Pleistocene was of sufficient magnitude to cause  vegetational shifts, both vertically and latitudinally, resulting in  the establishment of alternating continuous and discontinuous lowland  and highland environments, although this climatic fluctuation was not  so great as to eliminate tropical lowland environments from the region.  I feel that the present patterns of distribution of the amphibians in  the Isthmus of Tehuantepec may be explained on this premise.    Many authors dealing with the herpetofauna of Middle America have  followed Schuchert's (1935) suggestion of a seaway in the isthmus  during the Cenozoic. Thus, Burt (1931), Duellman (1956, 1958a), Gloyd  (1940), Oliver (1948), Smith and Laufe (1946), and Stuart (1941)  employed the presence of a seaway to explain distribution and  speciation in various genera. Durham, Arellano, and Peck (1952), Olson  and McGrew (1941), and Stirton (1954) have provided geological evidence  that there probably was no Cenozoic seaway in the Isthmus of  Tehuantepec. Even if there were a seaway in the Pliocene or Miocene  (the dating of this possible seaway is open to question), its presence  is not necessary to explain the present patterns of distribution in the  isthmus.    In recent years the study of natural biotic environments, palynology,  and Pleistocene chronology in Middle America has produced a wealth of  data, which although still fragmentary begins to form a picture of past  climatic events in that part of the world. Sedimentary studies by  Hutchinson, Patrick, and Deevey (1956) and Sears, Foreman, and Clisby  (1955) have provided evidence of drastic climatic shifts in Mexico  during the Pleistocene. Further evidence of bioclimatic fluctuation is  provided by Martin and Harrell (1957) and Martin (1958); the latter has  suggested that there was a displacement of the tropical zones in  southern Mexico and northern Central America by as much as 3000 feet  during the glacial maximum. Much of the evidence of such drastic  vertical shifts in environments is based on the presence of  Pleistocene montane glaciers on Mexican volcanoes (White, 1956) and  Chirripo in Costa Rica (Weyl, 1955). Dorf (1959) supports this idea of  drastic climatic change.    In his studies of the avifauna of Mexico and Guatemala Griscom (1932  and 1950) made an important issue of the continuity of the bird fauna  in what he called the Subtropical Life-zone, which essentially consists  of cloud forest, a widespread, but discontinuous, habitat on the Gulf  (windward) slopes of the Mexican and Central American highlands at  elevations between 1000 and 2000 meters. To account for this apparent  uniformity in the avifauna Griscom hypothesized a continuity of cloud  forest environment in the Pleistocene; this would result in the  depression of cloud forests to the coastal lowlands and the  displacement of tropical lowland environments far to the south in  Central America. Stuart (1951) objected to this displacement of lowland  tropical rainforest; he stated that a descent to sea level of a  subtropical zone would have brought about either widespread  extermination of the tropical fauna or acclimatization of that fauna to  subtropical conditions.    Although palynological studies and some faunal studies of subtropical  and temperate animals suggest a drastic climatic fluctuation that might  have eliminated tropical environments in southern Mexico and northern  Central America, there is much biological evidence indicating the  existence of tropical environments in this region even during the  glacial maximum. Especially significant is the diversity of species  inhabiting the present tropical environments; many of these have  differentiated from related taxa to the south.    In the Pleistocene, climate fluctuated and vegetation shifted  correspondingly in southern Mexico and northern Central America. Most  of the palynological studies and many studies of Pleistocene chronology  deal with montane regions, either the Mexican Plateau or the mountains  rising from the plateau. No such studies have been made in lowland  tropical environments. During glacial advances the tropical lowland  environments in "]]]
