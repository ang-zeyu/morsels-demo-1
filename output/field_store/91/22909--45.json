We have  already referred to the disastrous influences of the mysticism and  fanaticism which, in addition to other corruptions of the true faith, had  appeared about, and after, the period of the birth of Arndt. For instance,  the Swiss physician, Paracelsus (who died as a Roman Catholic in 1541),  had published various fantastic and mystical writings, in which he  professed that he understood both mundane and supermundane mysteries. Now  a certain Lutheran pastor in Saxony, named Weigel, who died in 1588, and  who had been confessedly a man of an upright walk and conversation, had  yielded to a tendency to the mysticism and theosophy of Paracelsus. He was  thus led theoretically to undervalue the doctrines of the church, and to  represent them as merely allegorical forms, involving truths not known to  ordinary men. The natural results of his theory, if its folly had not been  exposed, would unquestionably have seriously affected the authority of the  written Word. Before his writings were published, a friend had  communicated to Arndt a short extract from them, which contained none of  his errors; the author's name had been withheld. Arndt, in his innocence,  inserted the passage in his book, and was thus burdened with the odium of  all the Weigelian errors; but he was subsequently released from all  censure, and his freedom from anything like the mysticism of Weigel was  generally conceded.    ยง 29. Another ground of the charge of mysticism which his opponents  advanced, was found in his repeated references in the \"True Christianity\"  to Tauler. Here, too, Arndt made a brilliant defence, by quoting the great  Luther as his authority. The latter had obtained possession of a  manuscript without a title or an author's name, which deeply interested  him. It dwelt entirely on the communion of the soul with God, and on  kindred topics. Luther, whose godliness was healthy and sound, was so much  charmed with the work, that he published a part of it at Wittenberg in  1516, and prefixed the title: \"A spiritual, noble little work, explaining  the distinction between the old and the new man; showing, also, who are  the children of Adam and the children of God, and how Adam must die in us,  and Christ live in us.\" During the course of the next year he published  the whole work, with an extended Preface of his own, and adopted the  title: \"A German Theology\"; this general title it has since retained. It  was received with unbounded favor, and circulated rapidly throughout  Europe, for instance, in three English, seven Latin, four French, etc.,  translations, besides numerous editions of the original German. It was  supposed to have been written by Tauler, a very devout man, who was born  in the year 1290. His religious tendencies led him, like Luther, to enter  a monastery. The sermons and other writings which he left behind, while  their general character assign to him a place among those who are  denominated \"Mystics,\" nevertheless abound in holy and devout aspirations,  and were dictated by a spirit that sought and found peace in the grace of  God alone.--Arndt entertained the opinion that the \"German Theology\" was a  production of his pen, and so represents the case in his \"True  Christianity.\" It is now, however, generally conceded, in consequence of  an allusion in the work itself to Tauler as a religious teacher of an  earlier day, that another person, belonging to a later period, was the  writer; his name is still involved in impenetrable darkness.--So, too, it  is by no means certain that Thomas a Kempis (born in 1380), was the author  of the popular book \"On the Imitation of Christ,\" of which more than two  thousand editions in the original language, more than one thousand in  French, besides innumerable others in German, English, etc., have been  published. The historical arguments, adduced chiefly by French writers,  intended to support the claims of the eminent Gerson (born in 1363), as  the author, although not entirely conclusive, are still possessed of great  weight.--Arndt incidentally remarks in a brief statement respecting the  \"German Theology,\" that his copy, printed at Wittenberg in 1520, contained  simply the remark that the book had been written by a devout priest of the  city of Frankfort, for devotional purposes, but the author's name was  withheld. If Luther sanctioned the publication of the \"German Theology,\"  Arndt could calmly listen to those who censured him for adopting a similar  course. Those extracts at least, which he furnishes in the \"True  Christianity,\" are, unquestionably, evangelical and truly edifying.    ยง 30. It will, perhaps, gratify the reader to observe the skill with which  Wildenhahn, to whom we have already referred, illustrates the childlike  simplicity of Arndt's character, by combining fiction with truth. During  his Brunswick pastorate, the City Council of Halberstadt sent him an  urgent call to become the successor of the deceased Rev. D. Sachse, as  pastor of the church of St. Martin in that city. After he had consulted  with his intelligent wife, who, like himself, was anxious to withdraw to  any spot where peace could be found, he resolved to accept the call; and,  in accordance with custom and law, applied to the Brunswick City Council  for letters of honorable dismission. When the question was to be decided,  Arndt appeared in the presence of the burgomaster, Kale, the syndic, Dr.  Roerhand, and other members of the Council, and renewed his request. These  details are historically true. Wildenhahn now subjoins the following:  \"Tell me honestly,\" said the syndic to him, \"have you really, as you  allege, taken no steps whatever, in order to obtain this call from  Halberstadt?\" \"Not a single step,\" said Arndt, in a solemn manner, with  his right hand on his heart, \"the whole is altogether and exclusively a  work of God.\" But at the moment when he pronounced this solemn  declaration, it became evident to those who were present, that a sudden  thought had startled him; he changed color; he began to tremble; he  suddenly covered his eyes with his left hand. Then, with a voice betraying  deep emotion, he added: \"Gentlemen, I have borne false witness! I really  did do something to obtain this call.\" \"Ah!\" said Kale quickly, delighted,  as it seemed, to find an opportunity for displaying his official dignity,  \"You did? Pray, tell us what it was.\" \"I prayed to the blessed Lord with  tears, that he would assign to me some other spot in his vineyard, no  matter how insignificant, if I could only there preach his word in peace.\"  \"And was _that_ all?\" inquired the burgomaster, much surprised, and  speaking in more gentle tones. \"That was all,\" replied Arndt, \"and this is  true, as God lives! But, doubtless, I erred here, in impatiently  attempting to dictate to God, etc.\" Such simplicity of character, such  perfect ingenuousness, such a wonderful freedom from artifice and  disguise, completely disarmed the members of the Council. They now  understood better than previously the artlessness and spirituality of the  man before them, and, after that scene, they accorded to him entire esteem  and confidence.    ยง 31. The great work of Arndt--the \"True Christianity,\" has probably never  had its equal as a popular book of devotion. Tholuck relates the following  anecdote as an illustration of the manner in which even Papists could  appreciate the merits of the work. When Prof. Anton, of Halle, visited  Madrid in 1687, he examined the library of the Jesuits, and incidentally  inquired of the librarian respecting the ascetic writer whom they esteemed  more than other authors of devotional works. The latter exhibited a Latin  book, the title-page and last leaves of which were wanting, and declared  that it was the most edifying work which they possessed. When Anton  examined it, he discovered that it was a translation of Arndt's \"_True  Christianity_\"! It is only common justice to allow the author to state the  objects which he had in view, in preparing the work. The following passage  occurs in a letter which he addressed in the last year of his life to Duke  Augustus the Younger, of Brunswick: \"In the first place, I wished to  withdraw the minds of students and preachers from an inordinate  controversial and polemic theology, which has well-nigh assumed the form  of an earlier scholastic theology. Secondly, I purposed to conduct  Christian believers from lifeless thoughts to such as might bring forth  fruit. Thirdly, I wished to guide them onward from mere science and  theory, to the actual practice of faith and godliness; and, fourthly, to  show them wherein a truly Christian life consists, which accords with the  true faith, as well as to explain the apostle's meaning when he says: 'I  live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me,' etc.\" (Gal. 2:20.)    ยง 32. The Rev. Dr. Seiss, the author of \"Ecclesia Lutherana, etc.,\" to  whose endeavors the religious public is mainly indebted for the appearance  of the present edition, remarks in a recent notice of the work: \"This is  one of the very greatest and most useful practical books produced by  Protestantism. Though written more than two hundred and fifty years ago,  it is still unsurpassed in its department. It stands out with marked and  superior distinction in the modern ages. Next to the Bible and Luther's  Small Catechism, it has been more frequently printed, more widely read,  and more influential for good, than any other book, perhaps, that has ever  been written. Boehm has not exaggerated, when he says that its effects, in  the conversion of souls, has been such, that an account of them would make  a history in itself. Nor can any one candidly read it, without finding on  every page, scintillations of the sunlike splendors of a mind bathed in  the purity, wisdom, and love of heaven.\" Mr. Boehm, in the Preface to his  translation (which is the basis both of the revision of Mr."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34781"],[0,"An Australian Bird Book: A Pocket Book for Field Use (#7)"],[1,"  helpless on land. Such a wide distribution of a creature possessing  poor means of locomotion indicates that the animal must have existed  for a long time, so that it has been able to gradually extend its  range. Thus we conclude it is an ancient form.    ====      [Page 24]      [Illustration: [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34]]        ORDER VI.--PODICIPEDIDIFORMES.        F. 24.

As so much  has been said about Penguins by Lieutenant Shackleton's party, they  have caught the popular fancy, and people are much interested in them.  Many Australians do not know that three Penguins are found on their  own coast. It was one of the sights of the 1910 Summer School at  Portsea to sit on the balcony and watch the Penguins chasing their  prey in the clear waters in front. Their wings are paddles, being  flattened and devoid of quills. The wings are not folded, but are  carried hanging awkwardly at the side.    During the interest aroused by Peary's expedition to the North Pole,  an illustrated weekly paper published a cartoon, which showed the  American Eagle sitting on the North Pole and reading a proclamation to  an audience of Penguins. One thing is unfortunate about this--Penguins  are unknown in the Northern Hemisphere. Indeed, they support the  geographer in his contention that, while the Pacific Ocean is very  ancient, the Atlantic Ocean has been formed much more recently, for  Penguins are found up the Pacific even to the Galapagos Is. on the  Equator, but have not spread into the Atlantic Ocean beyond Tristan da  Cunha, at the extreme South.    ====      [Page 25b]        ORDER VII.--SPHENISCIFORMES.

Indeed, many of them do not go near  land except to breed. Then they usually repair to small lonely islands  often with bold precipitous shores.    Ocean birds are readily divisible into four families. The first  is made up of the 25 Storm-Petrels; the second of the 75 Petrels,  Shearwaters, Fulmars, and Dove-Petrels; the third family comprises  only the three small southern Diving-Petrels; while the fourth  contains the nineteen noble Albatrosses.    Though Storm-Petrels and Petrels of various kinds may be seen in the  Northern Hemisphere, yet the Southern Hemisphere, with its enormous  expanse of water, is the headquarters of these birds.    The dainty, tiny Storm-Petrels, fearlessly tripping over the mountain  billows in times of great danger to the sailor, were considered birds  of ill-omen. Their peculiar flight possibly helped this idea. Gould  closely studied them and other ocean birds during his voyages on  sailing ships. He describes them as \"fluttering over the glassy  surface of the ocean during calms with an easy butterfly-like motion  of the wings, and buffeting and breasting with equal vigor the crests  of the loftiest waves of the storm; at one moment descending into  their deep troughs, and, at the next, rising with the utmost alertness  to their highest point, apparently from an impulse communicated as  much by striking the surface of the water with its webbed feet as by  the action of the wings.\"    This habit of \"walking\" on the sea is said to be responsible for the  name \"Petrel,\" which is associated with Saint Peter, who, of old,  walked on the waters. Sailors call them Mother Carey's Chickens.    The largest Australian Storm-Petrel is the Whitefaced Storm-Petrel,  whose scientific name, _Pelagodroma_, means \"open sea wanderer.\"  It has been recorded even from the North Atlantic and Britain. Many  thousands of these birds still nest on Mud Island, a sandbank just  inside Port Phillip Heads. The presence there of a true ocean wanderer  is a valuable piece of evidence to support the geographer in his claim  that Port Phillip Bay once had a wide opening, which has been almost  closed by the drift of sand across its mouth. The Storm-Petrels have  probably nested there for many, many centuries. Long may they continue  to do so! They hurt no one, and they are a feature of interest to all  interested in the flora and fauna of Australia, and to natural history  students and Nature-lovers in general.    The Shackleton expedition met the Wilson (Yellow-webbed) Storm-Petrel,  in considerable numbers, far south. Two specimens were presented by  Lieutenant Shackleton to the National Museum, Melbourne. However,  recently our Museum received, through the agency of two schoolboys,  a specimen that is valued even more highly, for it is Australian.    The boys, on their way to the Marshaltown State School (Mr. H. B.  Williamson, H.T.), found a bird near a fence about nine miles inland.  It had evidently been killed by flying into the fence in the dark.  Using the _Bird-List_, the boys discovered that it was a Yellow-webbed  Storm-Petrel, a truly pelagic bird, as its name, _Oceanites oceanicus_  indicates. Mr. Williamson, to show that the _List_ was of assistance,  even to boys, in identifying birds they had never heard of before,  left the bird at the Continuation School, Geelong. Here it was  recognized as a valuable specimen, and was at once sent to Mr.  Kershaw, curator of the National Museum. It is now in the Australian  collection.    The true Petrels are very numerous in kinds and individuals. Darwin  thought that the most numerous of birds was a Petrel. One of great  interest is the \"Mutton-Bird,\" or Short-tailed Petrel. This romantic  bird breeds by the million on Cape Woolamai and other places about  Bass Strait.    Just as the mallee farmer is dependent on his annual wheat harvest,  so the remarkable colony of people living on Cape Barren Island is  entirely dependent on the annual Mutton-Bird harvest. They claim  to take about a million and a half birds each year. The number is  probably much exaggerated, for Littler, in his valuable _Birds of  Tasmania_, gives the number as 555,000 for 1909, valued at about  L4000. Bass and Flinders were glad to replenish their stores with  young Mutton-Birds. Flinders calculated that one flock of these birds  he met in Bass Strait contained 132,000,000 birds. They lay but one  egg, so one would expect the Petrel to be long-lived. We found a  closely-similar bird nesting on Mast Head Island, Capricorn Group.    The three southern Diving Petrels, forming the next family, are much  smaller than the common Petrels. They are expert divers, and are  found mainly in the far South.    The mighty Albatross, with its enormous wing-span of possibly up to  14 feet, is also largely a southern bird. That this bird has spread to  the North Pacific Ocean, but has not yet penetrated any distance into  the Atlantic, is another piece of evidence as to the age of these two  oceans. The Pacific Ocean is a very ancient depression, while the  Atlantic is much younger, and has been formed since the lands which  border its shores. The Black-browed Albatross, however, was once seen  in England. Probably this bird might have been carried north on board  ship, and then set free again. Fossil bones of Albatrosses have been  found in France and England. Their remarkable power of wheeling round  and round a vessel, with no perceptible movement of the wing, has  excited much interest and controversy.    Mr. Froude, in his _Oceana_, has given a vivid description of this  flight. The Albatross \"wheels in circles round and round and for ever  round the ship--now far behind, now sweeping past in a long, rapid  curve, like a perfect skater on an untouched field of ice. There is no  effort; watch as closely as you will, you rarely or never see a stroke  of the mighty pinion. The flight is generally near the water, often  close to it. You lose sight of the bird as"]]]
