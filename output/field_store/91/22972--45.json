Brock and I were out \"pot-hunting,\" and hearing some guinea-fowl  cackling among the bushes, I made a circuit half round them so that  Brock, on getting in his shot, should drive them over in my direction.  I eventually got into position on the edge of a deep ravine and knelt  on one knee, crouching down among the ferns. There I had scarcely time  to load when over flew a bird, which I missed badly; and I did not have  another chance, for Brock had got to work, and being a first-rate shot  had quickly bagged a brace. Meanwhile I felt the ground very hard under  my knee, and on examination found that the bank of the ravine was  formed of stone, which extended for some distance, and which was  exactly the kind of material for which I had long been fruitlessly  searching. I was greatly delighted with my unexpected discovery, though  at first I had grave misgivings about the distance to be traversed and  the difficulty of transporting the stone across the intervening  country. Indeed, I found in the end that the only way of getting the  material to the place where it was wanted was by laying down a tram  line right along the ravine, throwing a temporary bridge across the  Tsavo, following the stream down and re-crossing it again close to the  site of the permanent bridge. Accordingly, I set men to work at once to  cut down the jungle and prepare a road on which to lay the double  trolley line. One morning when they were thus engaged, a little paa--a  kind of very small antelope--sprang out and found itself suddenly in  the midst of a gang of coolies. Terrified and confused by the shouting  of the men, it ran straight at Shere Shah, the jemadar, who promptly  dropped a basket over it and held it fast. I happened to arrive just in  time to save the graceful little animal's life, and took it home to my  camp, where it very soon became a great pet. Indeed, it grew so tame  that it would jump upon my table at meal times and eat from my hand.    When the road for the trolley line was cleared, the next piece of work  was the building of the two temporary bridges over the river. These we  made in the roughest fashion out of palm trees and logs felled at the  crossing places, and had a flood come down they would, of course, have  both been swept away; fortunately, however, this did not occur until  the permanent work was completed. The whole of this feeding line was  finished in a very short time, and trollies were soon plying backwards  and forwards with loads of stone and sand, as we also discovered the  latter in abundance and of good quality in the bed of the ravine. An  amusing incident occurred one day when I was taking a photograph of an  enormous block of stone which was being hauled across one of these  temporary bridges. As the trolley with its heavy load required very  careful manipulation, my head mason, Heera Singh, stood on the top of  the stone to direct operations, while the overseer, Purshotam Hurjee,  superintended the gangs of men who hauled the ropes at either end in  order to steady it up and down the inclines. But we did not know that  the stream had succeeded in washing away the foundations of one of the  log supports; and as the weight of the trolley with the stone came on  the undermined pier, the rails tilted up and over went the whole thing  into the river, just as I snapped the picture. Heera Singh made a wild  spring into the water to get clear of the falling stone, while  Purshotam and the rest fled as if for their lives to the bank. It was  altogether a most comical sight, and an extraordinary chance that at  the very moment of the accident I should be taking a photograph of the  operation. Fortunately, no one was injured in the slightest, and the  stone was recovered undamaged with but little trouble.    Not long after this occurrence my own labours were one day nearly  brought to a sudden and unpleasant end. I was travelling along in an  empty trolley which, pushed by two sturdy Pathans, was returning to the  quarry for sand. Presently we came to the sharp incline which led to  the log bridge over the river. Here it was the custom of the men,  instead of running beside the trolley, to step on to it and to let its  own momentum take it down the slope, moderating its speed when  necessary by a brake in the shape of a pole, which one of them carried  and by which the wheels could be locked. On this occasion, however, the  pole was by some accident dropped overboard, and down the hill we flew  without brake of any kind. Near the bridge there was a sharp curve in  the line, where I was afraid the trolley would jump the rails; still, I  thought it was better to stick to it than to risk leaping off. A moment  afterwards I felt myself flying head first over the edge of the bridge,  just missing by a hair's breadth a projecting beam; but luckily I  landed on a sand bank at the side of the river, the heavy trolley  falling clear of me with a dull thud close by. This accident, also, was  happily unattended by injury to anyone.          CHAPTER V    TROUBLES WITH THE WORKMEN      It seemed fated that the building of the Tsavo Bridge should never be  allowed to proceed in peace for any length of time. I have already  described our troubles with the lions; and no sooner did the beasts of  prey appear to have deserted us, for the time being at any rate, than  other troubles, no less serious, arose with the workmen themselves.  After I had discovered the stone for the bridge, I sent down to the  coast for gangs of masons to work and dress it. The men who were sent  me for this purpose were mostly Pathans and were supposed to be expert  workmen; but I soon found that many of them had not the faintest notion  of stone-cutting, and were simply ordinary coolies who had posed as  masons in order to draw forty-five instead of twelve rupees a month. On  discovering this fact, I immediately instituted a system of piecework,  and drew up a scale of pay which would enable the genuine mason to earn  his forty-five rupees a month--and a little more if he felt  inclined--and would cut down the impostors to about their proper pay as  coolies. Now, as is often the case in this world, the impostors were  greatly in the majority; and accordingly they attempted to intimidate  the remainder into coming down to their own standard as regards output  of work, in the hope of thereby inducing me to abandon the piece-work  system of payment. This, however, I had no intention of doing, as I  knew that I had demanded only a perfectly fair amount of work from each  man.    These masons were continually having quarrels and fights amongst  themselves, and I had frequently to go down to their camp to quell  disturbances and to separate the Hindus from the Mohammedans. One  particularly serious disturbance of this sort had a rather amusing  sequel. I was sitting after dusk one evening at the door of my hut,  when I heard a great commotion in the masons' camp, which lay only a  few hundred yards away. Presently a jemadar came rushing up to me to  say that the men were all fighting and murdering each other with sticks  and stones. I ran back with him at once and succeeded in restoring  order, but found seven badly injured men lying stretched out on the  ground. These I had carried up to my own boma on charpoys (native  beds); and Brock being away, I had to play the doctor myself as best I  could, stitching one and bandaging another and generally doing what was  possible. There was one man, however, who groaned loudly and held a  cloth over his face as if he were dying. On lifting this covering, I  found him to be a certain mason called Karim Bux, who was well known to  me as a prime mischief-maker among the men. I examined him carefully,  but as I could discover nothing amiss, I concluded that he must have  received some internal injury, and accordingly told him that I would  send him to the hospital at Voi (about thirty miles down the line) to  be attended to properly. He was then carried back to his camp, groaning  grievously all the time.    Scarcely had he been removed, when the head jemadar came and informed  me that the man was not hurt at all, and that as a matter of fact he  was the sole cause of the disturbance. He was now pretending to be  badly injured, in order to escape the punishment which he knew he would  receive if I discovered that he was the instigator of the trouble. On  hearing this, I gave instructions that he was not to go to Voi in the  special train with the others; but I had not heard the last of him yet.  About eleven o'clock that night I was called up and asked to go down to  the masons' camp to see a man who was supposed to be dying. I at once  pulled on my boots, got some brandy and ran down to the camp, where to  my surprise and amusement I found that it was my friend Karim Bux who  was at death's door. It was perfectly evident to me that he was only  \"foxing,\" but when he asked for dawa (medicine), I told him gravely  that I would give him some very good dawa in the morning.    Next day at noon--when it was my custom to have evil-doers brought up  for judgment--I asked for Karim Bux, but was told that he was too ill  to walk. I accordingly ordered him to be carried to my boma, and in a  few moments he arrived in his charpoy, which was shouldered by four  coolies who, I could see, knew quite well that he was only shamming.  There were also a score or so of his friends hanging around, doubtless  waiting in the expectation of seeing the \"Sahib\" hoodwinked. When the  bed was placed on the ground near me, I lifted the blanket with which  he had covered himself and thoroughly examined him, at the same time  feeling him to make sure that he had no fever. He pretended to be  desperately ill and again asked for dawa; but having"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38189"],[0,"A Treatise on Sheep: (#7)"],[1,"on our progenitors has been a current coin, an important material, on  which has been employed the skill and industry of almost every tribe,  and been the means of raising many a petty people to the hard-won  dignity of a nation. Man, at first placed in a comfortable  temperature, needed little as a defence against the weather; while  fashion, then unthought of, or only as a sport, failed to interest the  simple-minded races in the cut or texture of the coverings they wore.  That the first dresses of mankind were formed from vegetable  materials, we have the highest authority for believing; and even at  present, the garb of the natives of some of our lately discovered  islands, consists of a simple girdle formed from rough-cut reeds. But  as the dawn of knowledge smiled upon the savage, and animal sacrifice  tutored him in the uncouth rudiments of a coarse anatomy, the superior  comfort, even of the untanned hide would be remarked, and the clumsy  mantle of the Caffre hordes welcomed as a change. Time would not long  elapse till roving dispositions, and the encounter of unstable  climates, would show the wanderer the necessity of a fabric better  adjusted by shape and pliancy, to the nature of his wants; while the  clinging of lock to lock of woolly fibre would plainly tell the  superfluous nature of the supporting skin, and point the way to make  an ill-closed cloth.    (38.) _Invention of Weaving._--Weaving is not absolutely necessary for  the manufacture of cloth, since wool will felt, though far from  evenly, without the preliminary process of being laid in threads, so  that cloth may have been almost coeval with mankind without our being  required to assign much mechanical ingenuity to its inventors. But we  have tolerably clear evidence in the inspired writings, that weaving  was known in the earliest ages, and that it was trusted principally to  the women:--Thus Delilah wove Samson's hair when he slept in her lap;  and a short time after, it is written, that the mother of Samuel \"made  him a little coat, and brought it to him from year to year.\" At a  later period, Solomon thus describes a good wife:--\"She seeketh wool  and flax, and worketh willingly with her hands.\"[5] That garments were  in those early ages made of several pieces, joined by needle work, is  evident on a perusal of Genesis, xxxvii. 3; Judges, v. 30; and 2  Samuel, xiii. 13; and this plan is allowed to be even more ancient  than the weaving of flax. Job, who flourished, or is supposed to have  flourished, before the Israelites left Egypt, shows clearly by his  words that flannel clothing was then in vogue: \"Let me be condemned if  I have seen any perish for want of clothing, or any poor without  covering; if his loins have not blessed me, and if he were not warmed  with the fleece of my sheep;\" and that the cloth was woven, and not  produced by beating, is evident from his saying, when complaining of  his sad estate, \"My days are swifter than a weaver's shuttle.\"            [5] The art of weaving was first practised at Arach in          Babylonia, and spread thence to neighbouring cities, and          in process of time to the most remote parts of the          world.--_Bryant's Ancient Mythology_, Vol. v. p. 173.    (39.) _The early progress of the Wool Trade_ is veiled in much  obscurity, and only to be discovered by seeking for it in a mass of  fable, which in many instances enabled the old writers to string  together the dry details of history, in a manner suited to the taste  and habit of their time. The following may be taken as a specimen.  Phryxus, the son of Athamas king of Thebes, fleeing with his sister,  Helle, from their stepmother, and riding upon (carrying with him) a  ram which had a golden (valuable) fleece, sought to cross the  Dardanelles, when Helle was drowned, and the sea was ever after called  the Hellespont: but Phryxus arrived safely at Colchis, between the  Black and Caspian seas, and having sacrificed the ram to Mars, hung  the fleece in a temple dedicated to that god. By this the ancients no  doubt meant to intimate, either that Boeotia, the birth-place of so  many talented Greeks, furnished the people of Colchis with sheep, or  that they sent them sums of money in exchange for the wool of  Caucasus. That the latter is the more probable, is apparent from  Ovid's account of the Argonautic expedition, in which he shows the  hardships which Jason encountered in his successful endeavours (B.C.  1225) to bring the golden fleece from Colchis back to Greece--implying  the value of the article, and leading us to believe, that the  Colchians had, by the aid of severe penalties, long monopolized the  growth of wool. Moreover, Mount Caucasus and its neighbourhood form  the favoured nursery whence the improved fleece-bearing animals have  gradually spread over the world; and as such would be looked upon, at  the time I speak of, by adjacent tribes with jealousy and hatred; for  where is the nation that can calmly behold a compeer engrossing a  hoard of wealth, without struggling to lower their prices by a market  of their own?    Thus one country after another became impressed with the advantages to  be derived from the husbandry of sheep. Nation after nation improved  its agriculture, by the introduction of the animal, till at last the  Romans became pre-eminent for their attention to its culture, and to  the manufactures of which it is the fruitful source. Generous even to  an enemy, and attacking only to enrich the countries they subdued,  England may bless the hour which saw the legions of the world's  mistress planting the Imperial Eagle on her shores.    Instead of following the progress of the wool trade among foreign  nations in later times, the limits of the present work compel me to  confine myself to an outline of the British trade from its origin, at  the time of the invasion by the Romans, to the present period.    (40.) _Introduction of Weaving into Britain._--It is evident from  ancient history, that the first inhabitants of all the countries of  Europe were either naked, or nearly so, owing to their ignorance of  the clothing art. Such, in particular, was the uncomfortable condition  of the inhabitants of this island, who are supposed to have used the  bark of trees, and to have smeared themselves with unctuous matter,  after the manner of other savages, to protect themselves from cold.  Some writers are of opinion, that the inner bark of trees alone was  employed, and that not till woven into a kind of cloth, such as the  South Sea islanders at present make. They continued the abominable  practice of anointing their bodies, long after the people of France,  Spain, and Germany, were decently clothed, so differently were they  situated in regard to intercourse with strangers, and opportunities of  acquiring the useful arts. It is impossible to discover with certainty  when, or by whom, the custom of wearing clothes was introduced into  Britain. Some suppose that the Greeks, and after them the Phoenicians,  who visited the Scilly islands, and sometimes the continent of  Britain, for trading purposes, first awakened in the breasts of our  savage ancestors a desire for comfortable coverings, as both these  nations were celebrated for elaborate attention to their attire.    \"The Britons,\" says Caesar, \"in the interior parts of the country are  clothed in skins.\" These are supposed not to have been sewed together,  but to have been cast over the shoulders as a mantle. Their stiffness,  however, rendered them aught but pleasant, as we may guess from their  endeavours to make them soft and pliable, by steeping in water,  beating them with stones and sticks, and rubbing them with fat. The  people of the southern parts are supposed to have been well acquainted  with the dressing, spinning, and weaving, both of flax and wool,  having been instructed by a Belgic colony, long before the invasion by  the Romans. Two kinds of cloth, which they manufactured at this  period, were much esteemed by their invaders; the one a thick harsh  cloth, worn in cold climates as a sort of mantle, and agreeing in many  respects with our Lowland plaids; the other made of fine wool, dyed of  different colours, woven into chequered cloth, and corresponding to  our Highland tartan. They are also believed to have made felts of  wool, without either spinning or weaving, and to have stuffed  mattresses with the portions shorn from it in dressing. The Britons  must have been well acquainted with the dyeing of wool, as the Gauls  were then celebrated, according to Pliny, for the invention of a  \"method of dyeing purple, scarlet, and all other colours, only with  certain herbs.\" The plant, which they chiefly used for the purpose,  was the glastum or woad, and they seem to have been led to the  discovery of its value in dyeing cloth, from their former use of it in  staining their bodies. A deep blue having been the colour they stained  their skins, it long continued a favourite; particularly, with the  Caledonians, as a tint for all their dresses. Though the most  civilized of the ancient Britons were tolerably versed in the most  essential branches of the woollen manufacture, yet that useful art was  not diffused over our island till the landing of the Romans, whose  soldiers, being almost all drawn from the plough, were well adapted,  when settled in the country, to foster the arts of peace. In order to  benefit themselves and the island, their emperors were at great pains  to discover and procure the best artificers of every description,  particularly the best manufacturers of woollen and linen cloths, whom  they formed into colleges, or corporations, endowed with various  privileges, and governed by a procurator, who was under the direction  of that great officer of their empire, the Count of the Sacred  Largesses. In this manner it appears that the first woollen  manufactory was established at Venta Belgarum, now Winchester, a"]]]
