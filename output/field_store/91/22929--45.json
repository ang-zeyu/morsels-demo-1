[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35829"],[0,"The 2009 CIA World Factbook (#7)"],[1," official exchange rate is  market-determined, market exchange rates are frequently established  by a relatively small set of goods and services (the ones the  country trades) and may not capture the value of the larger set of  goods the country produces. Furthermore, OER-converted GDP is not  well suited to comparing domestic GDP over time, since  appreciation/depreciation from one year to the next will make the  OER GDP value rise/fall regardless of whether  home-currency-denominated GDP changed.    GDP (purchasing power parity)    This entry gives the gross domestic product (GDP) or value of all  final goods and services produced within a nation in a given year. A  nation's GDP at purchasing power parity (PPP) exchange rates is the  sum value of all goods and services produced in the country valued  at prices prevailing in the United States. This is the measure most  economists prefer when looking at per-capita welfare and when  comparing living conditions or use of resources across countries.  The measure is difficult to compute, as a US dollar value has to be  assigned to all goods and services in the country regardless of  whether these goods and services have a direct equivalent in the  United States (for example, the value of an ox-cart or non-US  military equipment); as a result, PPP estimates for some countries  are based on a small and sometimes different set of goods and  services. In addition, many countries do not formally participate in  the World Bank's PPP project that calculates these measures, so the  resulting GDP estimates for these countries may lack precision. For  many developing countries, PPP-based GDP measures are multiples of  the official exchange rate (OER) measure. The differences between  the OER- and PPP-denominated GDP values for most of the wealthy  industrialized countries are generally much smaller.    GDP - composition by sector    This entry gives the percentage contribution of agriculture,  industry, and services to total GDP. The distribution will total  less than 100 percent if the data are incomplete.    GDP - per capita (PPP)    This entry shows GDP on a purchasing power parity basis divided by  population as of 1 July for the same year.    GDP - real growth rate    This entry gives GDP growth on an annual basis adjusted for  inflation and expressed as a percent.      GDP methodology    In the Economy category, GDP dollar estimates for countries are  reported both on an official exchange rate (OER) and a purchasing  power parity (PPP) basis. Both measures contain information that is  useful to the reader. The PPP method involves the use of  standardized international dollar price weights, which are applied  to the quantities of final goods and services produced in a given  economy. The data derived from the PPP method probably provide the  best available starting point for comparisons of economic strength  and well-being between countries. In contrast, the currency exchange  rate method involves a variety of international and domestic  financial forces that may not capture the value of domestic output.  Whereas PPP estimates for OECD countries are quite reliable, PPP  estimates for developing countries are often rough approximations.  In developing countries with weak currencies, the exchange rate  estimate of GDP in dollars is typically one-fourth to one-half the  PPP estimate. Most of the GDP estimates for developing countries are  based on extrapolation of PPP numbers published by the UN  International Comparison Program (UNICP) and by Professors Robert  Summers and Alan Heston of the University of Pennsylvania and their  colleagues. GDP derived using the OER method should be used for the  purpose of calculating the share of items such as exports, imports,  military expenditures, external debt, or the current account  balance, because the dollar values presented in the Factbook for  these items have been converted at official exchange rates, not at  PPP. One should use the OER GDP figure to calculate the proportion  of, say, Chinese defense expenditures in GDP, because that share  will be the same as one calculated in local currency units.  Comparison of OER GDP with PPP GDP may also indicate whether a  currency is over- or under-valued. If OER GDP is smaller than PPP  GDP, the official exchange rate may be undervalued, and vice versa.  However, there is no strong historical evidence that market exchange  rates move in the direction implied by the PPP rate, at least not in  the short- or medium-term. Note: the numbers for GDP and other  economic data should not be chained together from successive volumes  of the Factbook because of changes in the US dollar measuring rod,  revisions of data by statistical agencies, use of new or different  sources of information, and changes in national statistical methods  and practices.      GNP    Gross national product (GNP) is the value of all final goods and  services produced within a nation in a given year, plus income  earned by its citizens abroad, minus income earned by foreigners  from domestic production. The Factbook, following current practice,  uses GDP rather than GNP to measure national production. However,  the user must realize that in certain countries net remittances from  citizens working abroad may be important to national well-being.      GWP    This entry gives the gross world product (GWP) or aggregate value of  all final goods and services produced worldwide in a given year.    Geographic coordinates    This entry includes rounded latitude and longitude figures for the  purpose of finding the approximate geographic center of an entity  and is based on the locations provided in the Geographic Names  Server (GNS), maintained by the National Geospatial-Intelligence  Agency on behalf of the US Board on Geographic Names.      Geographic names    This information is presented in This information is presented in <a  href = \"../appendix/appendix-f.html\"Appendix F: Cross Reference List  of Geographic Names. It includes a listing of various alternate  names, former names, local names, and regional names referenced to  one or more related Factbook entries. Spellings are normally, but  not always, those approved by the US Board on Geographic Names  (BGN). Alternate names and additional information are included in  parentheses.      Geography    This category includes the entries dealing with the natural  environment and the effects of human activity.    Geography - note    This entry includes miscellaneous geographic information of  significance not included elsewhere.      Gini index    See entry for Distribution of family income - Gini index      Government    This category includes the entries dealing with the system for the  adoption and administration of public policy.    Government - note    This entry includes miscellaneous government information of  significance not included elsewhere.    Government type    This entry gives the basic form of government. Definitions of the  major governmental terms are as follows. (Note that for some  countries more than one definition applies.):  Absolute monarchy - a form of government where the monarch rules  unhindered, i.e., without any laws, constitution, or legally  organized opposition.  Anarchy - a condition of lawlessness or political disorder brought  about by the absence of governmental authority.  Authoritarian - a form of government in which state authority is  imposed onto many aspects of citizens' lives.  Commonwealth - a nation, state, or other political entity founded on  law and united by a compact of the people for the common good.  Communist - a system of government in which the state plans and  controls the economy and a single - often authoritarian - party  holds power; state controls are imposed with the elimination of  private ownership of property or capital while claiming to make  progress toward a higher social order in which all goods are equally  shared by the people (i.e., a classless society).  Confederacy (Confederation) - a union by compact or treaty between  states, provinces, or territories, that creates a central government  with limited powers; the constituent entities retain supreme  authority over all matters except those delegated to the central  government.  Constitutional - a government by or operating under an authoritative  document (constitution) that sets forth the system of fundamental  laws and principles that determines the nature, functions, and  limits of that government.  Constitutional democracy - a form of government in which the  sovereign power of the people is spelled out in a governing  constitution.  Constitutional monarchy - a system of government in which a monarch  is guided by a constitution whereby his/her rights, duties, and  responsibilities are spelled out in written law or by custom.  Democracy - a form of government in which the supreme power is  retained by the people, but which is usually exercised indirectly  through a system of representation and delegated authority  periodically renewed.  Democratic republic - a state in which the supreme power rests in  the body of citizens entitled to vote for officers and  representatives responsible to them.  Dictatorship - a form of government in which a ruler or small clique  wield absolute power (not restricted by a constitution or laws).  Ecclesiastical - a government administrated by a church.  Emirate - similar to a monarchy or sultanate, but a government in  which the supreme power is in the hands of an emir (the ruler of a  Muslim state); the emir may be an absolute overlord or a sovereign  with constitutionally limited authority.  Federal (Federation) - a form of government in which sovereign power  is formally divided - usually by means of a constitution - between a  central authority and a number of constituent regions (states,  colonies, or provinces) so that each region retains some management  of its internal affairs; differs from a confederacy in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35830"],[0,"The 2010 CIA World Factbook (#7)"],[1,"species (by-catch) by its effect of \"sweeping  the ocean clean.\"  Ecosystems - ecological units comprised of complex communities of  organisms and their specific environments.  Effluents - waste materials, such as smoke, sewage, or industrial  waste which are released into the environment, subsequently  polluting it.  Endangered species - a species that is threatened with extinction  either by direct hunting or habitat destruction.  Freshwater - water with very low soluble mineral content; sources  include lakes, streams, rivers, glaciers, and underground aquifers.  Greenhouse gas - a gas that \"traps\" infrared radiation in the lower  atmosphere causing surface warming; water vapor, carbon dioxide,  nitrous oxide, methane, hydrofluorocarbons, and ozone are the  primary greenhouse gases in the Earth's atmosphere.  Groundwater - water sources found below the surface of the earth  often in naturally occurring reservoirs in permeable rock strata;  the source for wells and natural springs.  Highlands Water Project - a series of dams constructed jointly by  Lesotho and South Africa to redirect Lesotho's abundant water supply  into a rapidly growing area in South Africa; while it is the largest  infrastructure project in southern Africa, it is also the most  costly and controversial; objections to the project include claims  that it forces people from their homes, submerges farmlands, and  squanders economic resources.  Inuit Circumpolar Conference (ICC) - represents the roughly 150,000  Inuits of Alaska, Canada, Greenland, and Russia in international  environmental issues; a General Assembly convenes every three years  to determine the focus of the ICC; the most current concerns are  long-range transport of pollutants, sustainable development, and  climate change.  Metallurgical plants - industries which specialize in the science,  technology, and processing of metals; these plants produce highly  concentrated and toxic wastes which can contribute to pollution of  ground water and air when not properly disposed.  Noxious substances - injurious, very harmful to living beings.  Overgrazing - the grazing of animals on plant material faster than  it can naturally regrow leading to the permanent loss of plant  cover, a common effect of too many animals grazing limited range  land.  Ozone shield - a layer of the atmosphere composed of ozone gas (O3)  that resides approximately 25 miles above the Earth's surface and  absorbs solar ultraviolet radiation that can be harmful to living  organisms.  Poaching - the illegal killing of animals or fish, a great concern  with respect to endangered or threatened species.  Pollution - the contamination of a healthy environment by man-made  waste.  Potable water - water that is drinkable, safe to be consumed.  Salination - the process through which fresh (drinkable) water  becomes salt (undrinkable) water; hence, desalination is the reverse  process; also involves the accumulation of salts in topsoil caused  by evaporation of excessive irrigation water, a process that can  eventually render soil incapable of supporting crops.  Siltation - occurs when water channels and reservoirs become clotted  with silt and mud, a side effect of deforestation and soil erosion.  Slash-and-burn agriculture - a rotating cultivation technique in  which trees are cut down and burned in order to clear land for  temporary agriculture; the land is used until its productivity  declines at which point a new plot is selected and the process  repeats; this practice is sustainable while population levels are  low and time is permitted for regrowth of natural vegetation;  conversely, where these conditions do not exist, the practice can  have disastrous consequences for the environment.  Soil degradation - damage to the land's productive capacity because  of poor agricultural practices such as the excessive use of  pesticides or fertilizers, soil compaction from heavy equipment, or  erosion of topsoil, eventually resulting in reduced ability to  produce agricultural products.  Soil erosion - the removal of soil by the action of water or wind,  compounded by poor agricultural practices, deforestation,  overgrazing, and desertification.  Ultraviolet (UV) radiation - a portion of the electromagnetic energy  emitted by the sun and naturally filtered in the upper atmosphere by  the ozone layer; UV radiation can be harmful to living organisms and  has been linked to increasing rates of skin cancer in humans.  Waterborne diseases - those in which bacteria survive in, and are  transmitted through, water; always a serious threat in areas with an  untreated water supply.        Environment - international agreements      This entry separates country participation in international  environmental agreements into two levels - party to and signed, but  not ratified. Agreements are listed in alphabetical order by the  abbreviated form of the full name.    Environmental agreements      This information is presented in This information is presented in <a  href = \"../appendix/appendix-c.html\"Appendix C: Selected  International Environmental Agreements, which includes the name,  abbreviation, date opened for signature, date entered into force,  objective, and parties by category.        Ethnic groups      This entry provides an ordered listing of ethnic groups starting  with the largest and normally includes the percent of total  population.        Exchange rates      This entry provides the official value of a country's monetary unit  at a given date or over a given period of time, as expressed in  units of local currency per US dollar and as determined by  international market forces or official fiat. The International  Organization for Standardization (ISO) 4217 alphabetic currency code  for the national medium of exchange is presented in parenthesis.        Executive branch      This entry includes several subfields. Chief of state includes the  name and title of the titular leader of the country who represents  the state at official and ceremonial functions but may not be  involved with the day-to-day activities of the government. Head of  government includes the name and title of the top administrative  leader who is designated to manage the day-to-day activities of the  government. For example, in the UK, the monarch is the chief of  state, and the prime minister is the head of government. In the US,  the president is both the chief of state and the head of government.  Cabinet includes the official name for this body of high-ranking  advisers and the method for selection of members. Elections includes  the nature of election process or accession to power, date of the  last election, and date of the next election. Election results  includes the percent of vote for each candidate in the last election.        Exports      This entry provides the total US dollar amount of merchandise  exports on an f.o.b. (free on board) basis. These figures are  calculated on an exchange rate basis, i.e., not in purchasing power  parity (PPP) terms.        Exports - commodities      This entry provides a listing of the highest-valued exported  products; it sometimes includes the percent of total dollar value.        Exports - partners      This entry provides a rank ordering of trading partners starting  with the most important; it sometimes includes the percent of total  dollar value.        F          Flag description      This entry provides a written flag description produced from actual  flags or the best information available at the time the entry was  written. The flags of independent states are used by their  dependencies unless there is an officially recognized local flag.  Some disputed and other areas do not have flags.    Flag graphic      Most versions of the Factbook include a color flag at the beginning  of the country profile. The flag graphics were produced from actual  flags or the best information available at the time of preparation.  The flags of independent states are used by their dependencies  unless there is an officially recognized local flag. Some disputed  and other areas do not have flags.        Freshwater withdrawal (domestic/industrial/agricultural)      This entry provides the annual quantity of water in cubic kilometers  removed from available sources for use in any purpose. Water  drawn-off is not necessarily entirely consumed and some portion may  be returned for further use downstream. Domestic sector use refers  to water supplied by public distribution systems. Note that some of  this total may be used for small industrial and/or limited  agricultural purposes. Industrial sector use is the quantity of  water used by self-supplied industries not connected to a public  distribution system. Agricultural sector use includes water used for  irrigation and livestock watering, and does not account for  agriculture directly dependent on rainfall. Included are figures for  total annual water withdrawal and per capita water withdrawal.        G          GDP (official exchange rate)      This entry gives the gross domestic product (GDP) or value of all  final goods and services produced within a nation in a given year. A  nation's GDP at official exchange rates (OER) is the  home-currency-denominated annual GDP figure divided by the bilateral  average US exchange rate with that country in that year. The measure  is simple to compute and gives a precise measure of the value of  output. Many economists prefer this measure when gauging the  economic power an economy maintains vis-a-vis its neighbors, judging  that an exchange rate captures the purchasing power a nation enjoys  in the international marketplace. Official exchange rates, however,  can be artificially fixed and/or subject to manipulation - resulting  in claims of the country having an under- or over-valued currency -  and are not necessarily the equivalent of a market-determined  exchange rate. Moreover, even if the official exchange rate is  market-de"]]]
