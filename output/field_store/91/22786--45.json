Yet did not he perform any of the  conditions he had agreed to; for Aristobulus's party would not so much  as admit Gabinius into the city, who was sent to receive the money that  he had promised.              CHAPTER 7.           How Pompey Had The City Of Jerusalem Delivered Up To Him But       Took The Temple By Force. How He Went Into The Holy Of       Holies; As Also What Were His Other Exploits In Judea.    1. At this treatment Pompey was very angry, and took Aristobulus into  custody. And when he was come to the city, he looked about where he  might make his attack; for he saw the walls were so firm, that it would  be hard to overcome them; and that the valley before the walls was  terrible; and that the temple, which was within that valley, was itself  encompassed with a very strong wall, insomuch that if the city were  taken, that temple would be a second place of refuge for the enemy to  retire to.    2. Now as he was long in deliberating about this matter, a sedition  arose among the people within the city; Aristobulus's party being  willing to fight, and to set their king at liberty, while the party of  Hyrcanus were for opening the gates to Pompey; and the dread people were  in occasioned these last to be a very numerous party, when they looked  upon the excellent order the Roman soldiers were in. So Aristobulus's  party was worsted, and retired into the temple, and cut off the  communication between the temple and the city, by breaking down the  bridge that joined them together, and prepared to make an opposition to  the utmost; but as the others had received the Romans into the city, and  had delivered up the palace to him, Pompey sent Piso, one of his great  officers, into that palace with an army, who distributed a garrison  about the city, because he could not persuade any one of those that had  fled to the temple to come to terms of accommodation; he then disposed  all things that were round about them so as might favor their attacks,  as having Hyrcanus's party very ready to afford them both counsel and  assistance.    3. But Pompey himself filled up the ditch that was on the north side of  the temple, and the entire valley also, the army itself being obliged to  carry the materials for that purpose. And indeed it was a hard thing to  fill up that valley, by reason of its immense depth, especially as  the Jews used all the means possible to repel them from their superior  situation; nor had the Romans succeeded in their endeavors, had not  Pompey taken notice of the seventh days, on which the Jews abstain  from all sorts of work on a religious account, and raised his bank, but  restrained his soldiers from fighting on those days; for the Jews only  acted defensively on sabbath days. But as soon as Pompey had filled  up the valley, he erected high towers upon the bank, and brought those  engines which they had fetched from Tyre near to the wall, and tried  to batter it down; and the slingers of stones beat off those that stood  above them, and drove them away; but the towers on this side of the  city made very great resistance, and were indeed extraordinary both for  largeness and magnificence.    4. Now here it was that, upon the many hardships which the Romans  underwent, Pompey could not but admire not only at the other instances  of the Jews' fortitude, but especially that they did not at all intermit  their religious services, even when they were encompassed with darts  on all sides; for, as if the city were in full peace, their daily  sacrifices and purifications, and every branch of their religious  worship, was still performed to God with the utmost exactness. Nor  indeed when the temple was actually taken, and they were every day  slain about the altar, did they leave off the instances of their Divine  worship that were appointed by their law; for it was in the third  month of the siege before the Romans could even with great difficulty  overthrow one of the towers, and get into the temple. Now he that first  of all ventured to get over the wall, was Faustus Cornelius the son of  Sylla; and next after him were two centurions, Furius and Fabius; and  every one of these was followed by a cohort of his own, who encompassed  the Jews on all sides, and slew them, some of them as they were running  for shelter to the temple, and others as they, for a while, fought in  their own defense.    5. And now did many of the priests, even when they saw their enemies  assailing them with swords in their hands, without any disturbance, go  on with their Divine worship, and were slain while they were offering  their drink-offerings, and burning their incense, as preferring the  duties about their worship to God before their own preservation. The  greatest part of them were slain by their own countrymen, of the adverse  faction, and an innumerable multitude threw themselves down precipices;  nay, some there were who were so distracted among the insuperable  difficulties they were under, that they set fire to the buildings that  were near to the wall, and were burnt together with them. Now of the  Jews were slain twelve thousand; but of the Romans very few were slain,  but a greater number was wounded.    6. But there was nothing that affected the nation so much, in the  calamities they were then under, as that their holy place, which had  been hitherto seen by none, should be laid open to strangers; for  Pompey, and those that were about him, went into the temple itself 8  whither it was not lawful for any to enter but the high priest, and  saw what was reposited therein, the candlestick with its lamps, and the  table, and the pouring vessels, and the censers, all made entirely  of gold, as also a great quantity of spices heaped together, with two  thousand talents of sacred money. Yet did not he touch that money, nor  any thing else that was there reposited; but he commanded the ministers  about the temple, the very next day after he had taken it, to cleanse  it, and to perform their accustomed sacrifices. Moreover, he made  Hyrcanus high priest, as one that not only in other respects had showed  great alacrity, on his side, during the siege, but as he had been the  means of hindering the multitude that was in the country from fighting  for Aristobulus, which they were otherwise very ready to have done;  by which means he acted the part of a good general, and reconciled  the people to him more by benevolence than by terror. Now, among the  Captives, Aristobulus's father-in-law was taken, who was also his uncle:  so those that were the most guilty he punished with decollation; but  rewarded Faustus, and those with him that had fought so bravely,  with glorious presents, and laid a tribute upon the country, and upon  Jerusalem itself.    7. He also took away from the nation all those cities that they had  formerly taken, and that belonged to Celesyria, and made them subject to  him that was at that time appointed to be the Roman president there; and  reduced Judea within its proper bounds. He also rebuilt Gadara, 9 that  had been demolished by the Jews, in order to gratify one Demetrius,  who was of Gadara, and was one of his own freed-men. He also made other  cities free from their dominion, that lay in the midst of the country,  such, I mean, as they had not demolished before that time; Hippos, and  Scythopolis, as also Pella, and Samaria, and Marissa; and besides these  Ashdod, and Jamnia, and Arethusa; and in like manner dealt he with the  maritime cities, Gaza, and Joppa, and Dora, and that which was  anciently called Strato's Tower, but was afterward rebuilt with the  most magnificent edifices, and had its name changed to Cesarea, by king  Herod. All which he restored to their own citizens, and put them under  the province of Syria; which province, together with Judea, and the  countries as far as Egypt and Euphrates, he committed to Scaurus as  their governor, and gave him two legions to support him; while he made  all the haste he could himself to go through Cilicia, in his way  to Rome, having Aristobulus and his children along with him as his  captives. They were two daughters and two sons; the one of which sons,  Alexander, ran away as he was going; but the younger, Antigonus, with  his sisters, were carried to Rome.              CHAPTER 8.           Alexander, The Son Of Aristobulus, Who Ran Away From Pompey,       Makes An Expedition Against Hyrcanus; But Being Overcome By       Gabinius He Delivers Up The Fortresses To Him. After This       Aristobulus Escapes From Rome And Gathers An Army Together;       But Being Beaten By The Romans, He Is Brought Back To Rome;       With Other Things Relating To Gabinius, Crassus And Cassius.    1. In the mean time, Scaurus made an expedition into Arabia, but was  stopped by the difficulty of the places about Petra. However, he laid  waste the country about Pella, though even there he was under great  hardship; for his army was afflicted with famine. In order to supply  which want, Hyrcanus afforded him some assistance, and sent him  provisions by the means of Antipater; whom also Scaurus sent to Aretas,  as one well acquainted with him, to induce him to pay him money to buy  his peace. The king of Arabia complied with the proposal, and gave him  three hundred talents; upon which Scaurus drew his army out of Arabia 10    2. But as for Alexander, that son of Aristobulus who ran away from  Pompey, in some time he got a considerable band of men together, and lay  heavy upon Hyrcanus, and overran Judea, and was likely to overturn  him quickly; and indeed he had come to Jerusalem, and had ventured to  rebuild its wall that was thrown down by Pompey, had not Gabinius, who  was sent as successor to Scaurus into Syria, showed his bravery, as in  many other points, so in making an expedition against Alexander; who, as  he was afraid that he would attack him, so he got together a large army,  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2853"],[0,"Quo Vadis: A Narrative of the Time of Nero (#7)"],[1," the maiden, and what  he had heard years before from Atelius Hister about the Lygian people  who lived in the gloom of the North.    The three outside had finished playing ball, and for some time had  been walking along the sand of the garden, appearing against the dark  background of myrtles and cypresses like three white statues. Lygia held  little Aulus by the hand. After they had walked a while they sat on a  bench near the fish-pond, which occupied the middle of the garden. After  a time Aulus sprang up to frighten the fish in the transparent water,  but Vinicius continued the conversation begun during the walk.    \"Yes,\" said he, in a low, quivering voice, scarcely audible; \"barely had  I cast aside the pretexta, when I was sent to the legions in Asia. I  had not become acquainted with the city, nor with life, nor with love.  I know a small bit of Anacreon by heart, and Horace; but I cannot like  Petronius quote verses, when reason is dumb from admiration and unable  to find its own words. While a youth I went to school to Musonius,  who told me that happiness consists in wishing what the gods wish, and  therefore depends on our will. I think, however, that it is something  else,--something greater and more precious, which depends not on  the will, for love only can give it. The gods themselves seek that  happiness; hence I too, O Lygia, who have not known love thus  far, follow in their footsteps. I also seek her who would give me  happiness--\"    He was silent--and for a time there was nothing to be heard save the  light plash of the water into which little Aulus was throwing pebbles  to frighten the fish; but after a while Vinicius began again in a voice  still softer and lower,--\"But thou knowest of Vespasian's son Titus?  They say that he had scarcely ceased to be a youth when he so loved  Berenice that grief almost drew the life out of him. So could I too  love, O Lygia! Riches, glory, power are mere smoke, vanity! The rich  man will find a richer than himself; the greater glory of another  will eclipse a man who is famous; a strong man will be conquered by a  stronger. But can Caesar himself, can any god even, experience greater  delight or be happier than a simple mortal at the moment when at his  breast there is breathing another dear breast, or when he kisses beloved  lips? Hence love makes us equal to the gods, O Lygia.\"    And she listened with alarm, with astonishment, and at the same time as  if she were listening to the sound of a Grecian flute or a cithara. It  seemed to her at moments that Vinicius was singing a kind of wonderful  song, which was instilling itself into her ears, moving the blood in  her, and penetrating her heart with a faintness, a fear, and a kind  of uncomprehended delight. It seemed to her also that he was telling  something which was in her before, but of which she could not give  account to herself. She felt that he was rousing in her something which  had been sleeping hitherto, and that in that moment a hazy dream  was changing into a form more and more definite, more pleasing, more  beautiful.    Meanwhile the sun had passed the Tiber long since, and had sunk low over  the Janiculum. On the motionless cypresses ruddy light was falling, and  the whole atmosphere was filled with it. Lygia raised on Vinicius her  blue eyes as if roused from sleep; and he, bending over her with a  prayer quivering in his eyes, seemed on a sudden, in the reflections  of evening, more beautiful than all men, than all Greek and Roman gods  whose statues she had seen on the facades of temples. And with  his fingers he clasped her arm lightly just above the wrist and  asked,--\"Dost thou not divine what I say to thee, Lygia?\"    \"No,\" whispered she as answer, in a voice so low that Vinicius barely  heard it.    But he did not believe her, and, drawing her hand toward him more  vigorously, he would have drawn it to his heart, which, under the  influence of desire roused by the marvellous maiden, was beating like a  hammer, and would have addressed burning words to her directly had not  old Aulus appeared on a path set in a frame of myrtles, who said,  while approaching them,--\"The sun is setting; so beware of the evening  coolness, and do not trifle with Libitina.\"    \"No,\" answered Vinicius; \"I have not put on my toga yet, and I do not  feel the cold.\"    \"But see, barely half the sun's shield is looking from behind the hill.  That is a sweet climate of Sicily, where people gather on the square  before sunset and take farewell of disappearing Phoebus with a choral  song.\"    And, forgetting that a moment earlier he had warned them against  Libitina, he began to tell about Sicily, where he had estates and large  cultivated fields which he loved. He stated also that it had come to his  mind more than once to remove to Sicily, and live out his life there in  quietness. \"He whose head winters have whitened has bad enough of hoar  frost. Leaves are not falling from the trees yet, and the sky smiles on  the city lovingly; but when the grapevines grow yellow-leaved, when snow  falls on the Alban hills, and the gods visit the Campania with piercing  wind, who knows but I may remove with my entire household to my quiet  country-seat?\"    \"Wouldst thou leave Rome?\" inquired Vinicius, with sudden alarm.    \"I have wished to do so this long time, for it is quieter in Sicily and  safer.\"    And again he fell to praising his gardens, his herds, his house hidden  in green, and the hills grown over with thyme and savory, among which  were swarms of buzzing bees. But Vinicius paid no heed to that bucolic  note; and from thinking only of this, that he might lose Lygia, he  looked toward Petronius as if expecting salvation from him alone.    Meanwhile Petronius, sitting near Pomponia, was admiring the view of  the setting sun, the garden, and the people standing near the fish-pond.  Their white garments on the dark background of the myrtles gleamed like  gold from the evening rays. On the sky the evening light had begun to  assume purple and violet hues, and to change like an opal. A strip of  the sky became lily-colored. The dark silhouettes of the cypresses grew  still more pronounced than during bright daylight. In the people, in the  trees, in the whole garden there reigned an evening calm.    That calm struck Petronius, and it struck him especially in the people.  In the faces of Pomponia, old Aulus, their son, and Lygia there was  something such as he did not see in the faces which surrounded him every  day, or rather every night. There was a certain light, a certain repose,  a certain serenity, flowing directly from the life which all lived  there. And with a species of astonishment he thought that a beauty and  sweetness might exist which he, who chased after beauty and sweetness  continually, had not known. He could not hide the thought in himself,  and said, turning to Pomponia,--\"I am considering in my soul how  different this world of yours is from the world which our Nero rules.\"    She raised her delicate face toward the evening light, and said with  simplicity,--\"Not Nero, but God, rules the world.\"    A moment of silence followed. Near the triclinium were heard in the  alley, the steps of the old general, Vinicius, Lygia, and little Aulus;  but before they arrived, Petronius had put another question--\"But  believest thou in the gods, then, Pomponia?\"    \"I believe in God, who is one, just, and all-powerful,\" answered the  wife of Aulus Plautius.          Chapter III      \"SHE believes in God who is one, all-powerful, and just,\" said  Petronius, when he found himself again in the litter with Vinicius. \"If  her God is all-powerful, He controls life and death; and if He is  just, He sends death justly. Why, then, does Pomponia wear mourning for  Julius? In mourning for Julius she blames her God. I must repeat this  reasoning to our Bronzebeard, the monkey, since I consider that in  dialectics I am the equal of Socrates. As to women, I agree that each  has three or four souls, but none of them a reasoning one. Let Pomponia  meditate with Seneca or Cornutus over the question of what their great  Logos is. Let them summon at once the shades of Xenophanes, Parmenides,  Zeno, and Plato, who are as much wearied there in Cimmerian regions as  a finch in a cage. I wished to talk with her and with Plautius about  something else. By the holy stomach of the Egyptian Isis! If I had told  them right out directly why we came, I suppose that their virtue would  have made as much noise as a bronze shield under the blow of a club.  And I did not dare to tell! Wilt thou believe, Vinicius, I did not dare!  Peacocks are beautiful birds, but they have too shrill a cry. I feared  an outburst. But I must praise thy choice. A real 'rosy-fingered  Aurora.' And knowest thou what she reminded me of too?--Spring! not our  spring in Italy, where an apple-tree merely puts forth a blossom here  and there, and olive groves grow gray, just as they were gray before,  but the spring which I saw once in Helvetia,--young, fresh, bright  green. By that pale moon, I do not wonder at thee, Marcus; but know that  thou art loving Diana, because Aulus and Pomponia are ready to tear thee  to pieces, as the dogs once tore Actaeon.\"    Vinicius was silent a time without raising his head; then he began to  speak with a voice broken by passion,--\"I desired her before, but now I  desire her still more. When I caught her arm, flame embraced me. I  must have her. Were I Zeus, I would surround her with a cloud, as he  surrounded Io, or I would fall on her in rain, as he fell on Danae; I  would kiss her lips till it pained! I would hear her scream in my arms.  I would kill Aulus and Pomponia, and bear her home in my arms. I will  not sleep to-night. I will give command to flog one of my slaves, and  listen to his groans--\"    \"Calm thyself,\" said Petronius. \"Thou hast the longing of a carpenter  from the Subura.\"    \"All one to me what thou"]]]
