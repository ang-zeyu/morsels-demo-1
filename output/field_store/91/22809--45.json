On that day the army was mobilized at Aldershot.    On August 5, 1914, Lord Kitchener was recalled at the outset from a  journey to Egypt, and appointed Minister of War. No more fortunate  selection than this could have been made. Above all else, Lord  Kitchener's reputation had been won as an able transport officer. In the  emergency, as Minister of War, the responsibility for the transport of a  British army oversea rested in his hands. On August 5, 1914, the House  of Commons voted a credit of $100,000,000, and an increase of 500,000  men to the regular forces. Upon the same day preparations went forward  for the dispatch of an expeditionary army to France.    The decision to send the army to France, instead of direct to a landing  in Belgium, would seem to have been in response to an urgent French  entreaty that Great Britain mark visibly on French soil her unity with  that nation at the supreme crisis. For some days previously British  reluctance to enter the war while a gleam of hope remained to confine,  if not prevent, the European conflagration, had created a feeling of  disappointment in France.    The British expeditionary army consisted at first--that is previous to  the Battle of the Marne--of two and a half army corps, or five  divisions, thus distributed: First Corps, Sir Douglas Haig; Second  Corps, General Smith-Dorrien; Fourth Division of the Third Corps,  General Pulteney. The Sixth Division of the Third Corps and the Fourth  Corps under General Rawlinson were not sent to France till after the end  of September, 1914. It contained besides about one division and a half  of cavalry under General Allenby. A British division varies from 12,000  to 15,000 men (three infantry brigades of four regiments each; three  groups of artillery, each having three batteries of six pieces; two  companies of sappers, and one regiment of cavalry). The force totaled  some 75,000 men, with 259 guns. The whole was placed under the command  of Field Marshal Sir John French, with Lieutenant General Sir Archibald  Murray, Chief of Staff.    Field Marshal French was sixty-two and was two years younger than Lord  Kitchener. His responsibilities were great, how great no one at the  beginning of the war realized his capabilities for the developing scope  of the task untried, but as a serious and courageous officer he fully  merited the honors he had already won.    By August 7, 1914, Admiral Jellicoe was able to guarantee a safe passage  for the British army across the English Channel. A fortunate  mobilization of the British Grand Fleet in the North Sea for maneuvers  shut off the German Grand Fleet from raiding the Channel. There was  nothing to criticize in the manner in which the Expeditionary Army was  thrown into France. Its equipment was ready and in all details fully  worthy of German military organization. From arms to boots--the latter  not long since a scandal of shoddy workmanship--only the best material  and skill had been accepted. Its transport proved the genius of Lord  Kitchener in that brand of military service. The railways leading to the  ports of embarkation, together with passenger steamships--some of them  familiar in American ports--were commandeered as early as the 4th of  August.    During the night of August 7, 1914, train after train filled with troops  steamed toward Southampton, and some other south-coast ports.  Complements were also embarked at Dublin, Avonmouth, and the Bristol  Channel. In the middle of the night citizens of small towns along the  route were awakened by the unceasing rumble of trains. They had no  conception of its import. They did not even realize that war had  actually burst upon the serenity of their peaceful lives. Each transport  vessel was placed in command of a naval officer, and guarded in its  passage across the channel by light cruisers and torpedo destroyers. The  transport of the whole Expeditionary Army was completed within ten days,  without the loss of a man and with a precision worthy of all military  commendation. But such secrecy was maintained that the British public  remained in ignorance of its passage until successfully accomplished.  American correspondents, however, were not yet strictly censored, so  that their papers published news of it on August 9.    On Sunday, August 9, 1914, two British transports were observed making  for the harbor of Boulogne. The weather was all that could be wished,  the crossing resembled a bank-holiday excursion. For some days  previously the French had taken a gloomy view of British support. But  French fishermen returning from Scotland and English ports maintained  confidence, for had not British fishermen told them the French would  never be abandoned to fall a prey to the enemy.    When the two advance British transports steamed into view, \"Les  Anglais,\" at last everyone cried. At once a hugely joyful reversion of  feeling. The landing of the British soldiers was made a popular ovation.  Their appearance, soldierly bearing, their gentleness toward women and  children, their care of the horses were showered with heartfelt French  compliments. Especially the Scotch Highlanders, after their cautious  fashion, wondered at the exuberance of their welcome. For the brave  Irish, was not Marshal MacMahon of near-Irish descent and the first  president of the Third Republic? The Irish alone would save that  republic. Women begged for the regimental badges to pin on their  breasts. In turn they offered delicacies of all kinds to the soldiers.  For the first time in a hundred years the British uniform was seen on  French soil. Then it represented an enemy, now a comrade in arms. The  bond of union was sealed at a midnight military mass, celebrated by  English-speaking priests, for British and French Catholic soldiers at  Camp Malbrouch round the Colonne de la Grande Armee. The two names  recalled the greatest of British and French victories--Blenheim,  Ramillies, and Oudenarde, Ulm, Austerlitz, and Jena.    Meanwhile, officers of the French General Staff had journeyed to London  to confer with the British General Staff regarding the camping and  alignment of the British troops. Meanwhile, also, the British reserves  and territorials were called to the colors. The latter comprised the  militia, infantry and artillery, and the volunteer yeomanry cavalry,  infantry and artillery. The militia was the oldest British military  force, officered to a great extent by retired regular army men, its  permanent staffs of noncommissioned officers were from the regular army,  and it was under the direct control of the Secretary of State for War.  The volunteer infantry, artillery, and yeomanry cavalry were on a  somewhat different basis, more nearly resembling the American militia,  but the British militia were linked with regular-line battalions. The  reserves, militia and volunteers, added approximately 350,000  well-trained men for immediate home defense.    On Sunday, August 17, 1914, it was officially announced that the whole  of the British Expeditionary Army had landed in France. Conferences  between the British and French General Staffs resulted in the British  army being concentrated first at Amiens. From that point it was to  advance into position as the left wing of the united French and British  armies, though controlled by their separate commanders.    The French Fifth Army had already moved to hold the line of the River  Sambre, with its right in touch with Namur. Cavalry patrols had been  thrown forward to Ligny and Gembloux, where they skirmished with uhlans.  Charleroi was made French headquarters. It was the center of extensive  coal-mining and steel industry. Pit shafts and blast furnaces dominated  the landscape. Historically it was the ground over which Bluecher's  Fourth Army Corps marched to the support of the British at Waterloo. Now  the British were supporting the French upon it against their former  ally.    On Thursday, August 20, 1914, the British took up their position on the  French left. Their line ran from Binche to Mons, then within the French  frontier stretched westward to Conde. From Mons to Conde it followed the  line of the canal, thus occupying an already constructed barrier.  Formerly Conde was regarded as a fortress of formidable strength, but  its position was not held to be of value in modern strategy. Its forts,  therefore, had been dismantled of guns, and its works permitted to fall  into disuse. But the fortress of Maubeuge lay immediately in rear of the  British line. In rear again General Sordet held a French cavalry corps  for flank actions. In front, across the Belgian frontier, General  d'Amade lay with a French brigade at Tournai as an outpost.    Before proceeding to British headquarters, General French held a  conference with General Joffre, Commander in Chief of all the French  armies. Until the outbreak of the war, General Joffre was practically  unknown to the French people. He was no popular military idol, no  boulevard dashing figure. But he had seen active service with credit,  and had climbed, step by step, with persevering study of military  science into the council of the French General Staff. As a strategist  his qualities came to be recognized as paramount in that body. A few  years previously he had been intrusted with the reorganization of the  French army, and his plans accepted. Therefore, when war with Germany  became a certainty, it was natural the supreme command of the French  army should fall to General Joffre.          CHAPTER VI    CAMPAIGNS IN ALSACE AND LORRAINE      The French staff apparently had designed a campaign in Upper Alsace and  the Vosges, but the throwing of a brigade from Belfort across the  frontier on the extreme right of their line on August 6"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29329"],[0,"Sandwiches (#7)"],[1,"and serve at once.      Ginger Sandwiches    Put four or five pieces of ginger through your meat chopper. Stir this  paste into a half cupful of orange marmalade. Put between slices of  buttered bread, press them together, trim the crusts and cut into  fingers. These are nice for afternoon teas. Ginger and carrot marmalade  are also very nice.          CANAPÉS      These are slices of bread cut into fancy shapes, toasted or quickly  fried in hot oil, or they may be spread with butter and browned in a  quick oven. One slice only is used for each canapé. The mixture is  spread on top, the top garnished, and the canapé used at once.      Anchovy Canapés    Cover a round or square of toast with anchovies that have been mashed  and seasoned with a little tomato catsup. Put a little chopped celery  around the edge as a garnish and send at once to the table.      Caviar Canapés    Season the caviar with onion and a very little lemon juice; spread over  a round or square canapé, put chopped onion around the edge, garnish the  top with a hard-boiled egg; place on paper mats and send at once to the  table. These are used as first course at lunch or dinner.      Swedish Canapés    Cut thick slices of whole wheat or Graham bread, trim the crusts and  hollow out the centers, being careful not to make a hole all the way  through. Pound or mash the hard boiled yolks of three eggs with a  tablespoonful of anchovy paste or two anchovies, two tablespoonfuls of  butter and a dash of lemon juice. Cut a dill pickle lengthwise into  slices an eighth of an inch thick, then cut these slices into long  strips a half inch wide. Cut large pickled beets into strips of the same  width. Cut a dozen pimolas into halves. Butter the bread, fill with the  paste, put over the strips of dill pickle, leaving one inch between each  strip. Cross these with strips of pickled beets, put half of a pimola  into each square. Dish on paper mats. Serve as an appetizer before soup.      Chopped Tongue Canapés    Chop cold, cooked tongue very fine; season it with two tablespoonfuls  of olive oil and a dusting of pepper; spread it over the top of a round  of toasted bread; garnish the edge with the small leaves of cress, put a  little grated hard-boiled egg in the center and send at once to the  table.      Sardine Canapés    Remove the skin and pound the sardines to a paste; put a thick layer of  this paste over the top of a round of toasted bread. Cut one gherkin  into very thin slices, arrange them overlapping around the edge; put a  little finely chopped hard-boiled egg in the center, and they are ready  to serve.      Fish Canapés    Pound a quarter of a pound of cooked fish to a paste; season it with a  few drops of onion juice, a saltspoonful of salt, and a dash of black  pepper. Stir into it two tablespoonfuls of sauce tartare; spread this on  six or eight rounds of buttered bread browned in the oven; garnish the  tops with grated cucumber and send to the table.      Deviled Oyster Canapés    Cut slices of bread into squares, toast and remove the crusts. Remove  the hard part from a pint of pickled oysters, place oysters over bread,  close together and in rotation, dust thickly with red pepper; put over  as a thin covering a highly seasoned sauce mayonnaise, and serve. Do not  put over a second piece of bread.      Pâté de Foie Gras Canapés    For twenty-four sandwiches take one tureen of foie gras. Remove the  fat, and mash the foie gras to a perfectly smooth paste, adding  gradually four tablespoonfuls of soft, not melted, butter; add a dash of  cayenne and a half teaspoonful of salt and about ten drops of onion  juice, and press the whole through a sieve. Cut slices of bread into  fancy shapes and toast; crescents are very pretty. Cover each slice  thickly with this paste; garnish with hard-boiled white of egg, cut into  diamonds or tiny crescents, and olives cut into rings. Arrange neatly,  and they are ready to serve.      Hot Canapés    A canapé is the half of a sandwich, as it were. Minced meats of various  kinds are served on one slice of bread. In many books they are called  \"uncovered sandwiches.\" The cold canapés are placed always among the  appetizers and served before the soup. They are made of such materials  as caviar, sardines, anchovies, pickled oysters, pickled lobster,  deviled shrimps, or a mixture of one or two of these materials.    A hot canapé, however, is served in the place of fish or as an entrée.  If they are dressed with either fish or shell-fish they will take the  place of that course. When made from chicken, sweetbreads or game,  should be served as an entrée, following the fish.      Fish Canapés    Pick apart sufficient cold cooked fish to make a half pint. Rub  together two level tablespoonfuls of butter and two of flour, add a half  pint of milk, stir until boiling, add a half teaspoonful of salt, a  teaspoonful of soy, a dash of red pepper and a half saltspoonful of  black pepper. When this is hot add the fish and four or five nice sliced  mushrooms; stand over hot water, without stirring, until the fish is  thoroughly heated. While this is heating, trim the crusts from six  slices of bread; toast the one side carefully. Have ready in your pastry  bag with a star tube a pint of light mashed potatoes; press in a  rope-like form, or in small rosettes, around the edge of the bread on  the untoasted side. Brush the bread with a little melted butter, put  them in the oven until the potatoes and bread are a golden brown. Dish  these on square paper mats on individual plates, fill the centers with  the creamed fish and send at once to the table.    Canned salmon may be used in the place of fresh boiled fish.      Lobster Canapés      1 three-pound lobster      The yolks of two eggs    2 level tablespoonfuls of butter    2 level tablespoonfuls of flour    ½ pint of milk    1 tablespoonful of chopped parsley    1 level teaspoonful of salt    1 saltspoonful of white pepper    1 pint of mashed potatoes    6 slices of bread    Toast the bread and arrange the potatoes according to the preceding  recipe. Rub the butter and flour together, add the milk; when boiling  add the seasoning and the lobster. When very hot stir in carefully the  well-beaten yolks of the eggs. Stir this until it is smoking hot, but be  careful not to boil, or it will curdle. Fill this on top of the toast  that has been garnished with potatoes, dust with chopped parsley and  send to the table.    Shrimps may be substituted for lobster.      Sweetbread Canapés      1 pair calf's sweetbreads    ½ can of mushrooms    2 level tablespoonfuls of butter    2 level tablespoonfuls of flour    ½ pint of milk    ½ teaspoonful of salt    1 saltspoonful of pepper    Boil the sweetbreads carefully for three-quarters of an hour; throw  them into cold water; pick them apart, rejecting the membrane. Chop the  mushrooms very fine, add them to the sweetbreads. Rub the butter and  flour together, add the milk; when boiling add the salt, pepper,  sweetbreads and mushrooms; cover and stand over hot water ten to fifteen  minutes. Serve them on slices of bread, garnished with mashed potatoes  pressed through a star tube.      Canapés à la Trinidad        Half the white meat from one boiled chicken    1 pair of sweetbreads    6 large fresh mushrooms    2 level tablespoonfuls of butter    2 level tablespoonfuls of flour    ½ pint of milk    2 yolks of hard-boiled eggs    1 level teaspoonful of salt    1 saltspoonful of pepper    Cut twelve slices of bread; trim the crusts so the slices will be of  even size. Cut out the centers from one-half the slices, leaving a wall  of one inch. Toast the solid slices. Brush the untoasted edge of the  bread with a little white of egg, lay on the rims and put them in the  oven to toast on the upper side. Pick the sweetbreads apart, after they  are carefully cooked, rejecting the membrane. Slice the mushrooms. Cut  the chicken into dice. Put the butter into a saucepan, add the  mushrooms, toss for a minute until the mushrooms are slightly softened,  then add the flour, mix, and add the milk, salt and pepper. Cover this  on the back part of the stove for ten or fifteen minutes until the  mushrooms are cooked; then add the meat. Stand this over hot water ten  or fifteen minutes. The toast should now be done and crisp. Arrange each  canapé on a square of lace paper on an individual heated dish, put the  mixture in the center, garnish with the yolk of the eggs pressed through  a sieve. Garnish the very top with a little chopped truffle or a little  chopped parsley. These are the handsomest of all hot canapés, and while  they are usually served following the soup at dinner, they may be used  for the main course at a ladies' luncheon, or at a supper.      Game Canapés    Cut any pieces of left-over game into dice. Put two tablespoonfuls of  butter and two of flour in a saucepan, add a half pint of stock. When  boiling add a half can of very fine mushrooms, a tablespoonful of  chopped ham, a tablespoonful of chopped parsley, a level teaspoonful of  salt and a saltspoonful of pepper. Bring this to a boil, add the game;  stand over hot water for fifteen or twenty minutes until the game has  absorbed part of the sauce, then add two tablespoonfuls of sherry or  Madeira, and fill into the square canapés made the same as in preceding  recipe.      Lamb Canapés      2 cans, or one quart of cooked peas    1 blade of mace    2 level tablespoonfuls of butter    2 level tablespoonfuls of flour    ½ pint of stock    1 teaspoonful of kitchen bouquet    ½ teaspoonful of salt    1 tablespoonful of chopped onion    2 tablespoonfuls of claret    1 saltspoonful of pepper    Put the butter and onion in a saucepan, shake it over the fire, then  add the cold boiled lamb, cut into blocks; you should have one pint.  When this is boiling add all the seasoning and stand the mixture over  hot water on the back of the stove while you make the canapés. Press the  peas"]]]
