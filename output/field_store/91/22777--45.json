Sed quoniam JG assumi potest minor  longitudine quavis assignata, fieri potest ut ratio AG ad Ag minus differat  a ratione æqualitatis quam pro differentia quavis assignata, adeoq; ut  ratio AB quad. ad Ab quad. minus differat a ratione BD ad bd quam pro  differentia quavis assignata. Est ergo, per Lemma I, ratio ultima AB quad.  ad Ab quad. æqualis rationi ultimæ BD ad bd.   _Q. E.

Capi enim potest DB ut AD^3: quo in casu circulus nullus per  punctum A inter tangentem AD & curvam AB duci potest, proindeq; angulus  contactus erit infinite minor circularibus. Et simili argumento si fiat DB  successive ut AD^4, AD^5, AD^6, AD^7, &c. habebitur series angulorum  contactus pergens in infinitum, quorum quilibet posterior est infinite  minor priore. Et si fiat DB successive ut AD^2, AD^{3/2}, AD^{4/3},  AD^{5/4}, AD^{6/5}, AD^{7/6}, &c. habebitur alia series infinita angulorum  contactus, quorum primus est ejusdem generis cum circularibus, secundus  infinite major, & quilibet posterior infinite major priore. Sed & inter  duos quosvis ex his angulis potest series utrinq; in infinitum pergens  angulorum intermediorum inseri, quorum quilibet posterior erit infinite  major priore. Ut si inter terminos AD^2 & AD^3 inseratur series AD^{13/6},  AD^{11/5}, AD^{9/4}, AD^{7/3}, AD^{5/2}, AD^{8/3}, AD^{11/4}, AD^{14/5},  AD^{17/6}, &c. Et rursus inter binos quosvis angulos hujus seriei inseri  potest series nova angulorum intermediorum ab invicem infinitis intervallis  differentium. Neq; novit natura limitem.    Quæ de curvis lineis deq; superficiebus comprehensis demonstrata sunt,  facile applicantur ad solidorum superficies curvas & contenta. Præmisi vero  hæc Lemmata ut effugerem tædium deducendi perplexas demonstrationes, more  veterum Geometrarum, ad absurdum. Contractiores enim redduntur  demonstrationes per methodum indivisibilium. Sed quoniam durior est  indivisibilium Hypothesis; & propterea Methodus illa minus Geometrica  censetur, malui demonstrationes rerum sequentium ad ultimas quantitatum  evanescentium summas & rationes, primasq; nascentium, id est, ad limites  summarum & rationum deducere, & propterea limitum illorum demonstrationes  qua potui breuitate præmittere. His enim idem præstatur quod per methodum  indivisibilium, & principiis demonstratis jam tutius utemur. Proinde in  sequentibus, siquando quantitates tanquam ex particulis constantes  consideravero, vel si pro rectis usurpavero lineolas curvas, nolim  indivisibilia sed evanescentia divisibilia, non summas & rationes partium  determinatarum, sed summarum & rationum limites semper intelligi, vimq;  talium demonstrationum ad methodum præcedentium Lemmatum semper revocari.    Objectio est, quod quantitatum evanescentium nulla sit ultima proportio;  quippe quæ, antequam evanuerunt, non est ultima, ubi evanuerunt, nulla est.  Sed & eodem argumento æque contendi posset nullam esse corporis ad certum  locum pergentis velocitatem ultimam. Hanc enim, antequam corpus attingit  locum, non esse ultimam, ubi attigit, nullam esse. Et responsio facilis  est. Per velocitatem ultimam intelligi eam, qua corpus movetur neq;  antequam attingit locum ultimum & motus cessat, neq; postea, sed tunc cum  attingit, id est illam ipsam velocitatem quacum corpus attingit locum  ultimum & quacum motus cessat. Et similiter per ultimam rationem  quantitatum evanescentium intelligendam esse rationem quantitatum non  antequam evanescunt, non postea, sed quacum evanescunt. Pariter & ratio  prima nascentium est ratio quacum nascuntur. Et summa prima & ultima est  quacum esse (vel augeri & minui) incipiunt & cessant. Extat limes quem  velocitas in fine motus attingere potest, non autem transgredi.

Its advantages were not lost upon Herschel. His attempt to assign  definite distances to the nearest stars was no isolated effort, but part  of the settled plan upon which his observations were conducted. He  proposed to sound the heavens, and the first requisite was a knowledge  of the length of his sounding-line. Thus it came about that his special  attention was early directed to double stars.    \"I resolved,\" he writes,[26] \"to examine every star in the heavens with  the utmost attention and a very high power, that I might collect such  materials for this research as would enable me to fix my observations  upon those that would best answer my end. The subject has already proved  so extensive, and still promises so rich a harvest to those who are  inclined to be diligent in the pursuit, that I cannot help inviting  every lover of astronomy to join with me in observations that must  inevitably lead to new discoveries.\"    The first result of these inquiries was a classed catalogue of 269  double stars presented to the Royal Society in 1782, followed, after  three years, by an additional list of 434. In both these collections the  distances separating the individuals of each pair were carefully  measured, and (with a few exceptions) the angles made with the  hour-circle by the lines joining their centres (technically called  \"angles of position\") were determined with the aid of a \"revolving-wire  micrometer,\" specially devised for the purpose. Moreover, an important  novelty was introduced by the observation of the various colours visible  in the star-couples, the singular and vivid contrasts of which were now  for the first time described.    Double stars were at that time supposed to be a purely optical  phenomenon. Their components, it was thought, while in reality  indefinitely remote from each other, were brought into fortuitous  contiguity by the chance of lying nearly in the same line of sight from  the earth. Yet Bradley had noticed a change of 30 deg., between 1718 and  1759, in the position-angle of the two stars forming Castor, and was  thus within a hair's breadth of the discovery of their physical  connection.[27] While the Rev. John Michell, arguing by the doctrine of  probabilities, wrote as follows in 1767:--\"It is highly probable in  particular, and next to a certainty in general, that such double stars  as appear to consist of two or more stars placed very near together, do  really consist of stars placed near together, and under the influence of  some general law.\"[28] And in 1784:[29] \"It is not improbable that a few  years may inform us that some of the great number of double, triple  stars, etc., which have been observed by Mr. Herschel, are systems of  bodies revolving about each other.\"    This remarkable speculative anticipation had a practical counterpart in  Germany. Father Christian Mayer, a Jesuit astronomer at Mannheim, set  himself, in January 1776, to collect examples of stellar pairs, and  shortly after published the supposed discovery of \"satellites\" to many  of the principal stars.[30] But his observations were neither exact nor  prolonged enough to lead to useful results in such an inquiry. His  disclosures were derided; his planet-stars treated as results of  hallucination. _On n'a point cru a des choses aussi extraordinaires_,  wrote Lalande[31] within one year of a better-grounded announcement to  the same effect.    Herschel at first shared the general opinion as to the merely optical  connection of double stars. Of this the purpose for which he made his  collection is in itself sufficient evidence, since what may be called  the _differential_ method of parallaxes depends, as we have seen, for  its efficacy upon disparity of distance. It was \"much too soon,\" he  declared in 1782,[32] \"to form any theories of small stars revolving  round large ones;\" while in the year following,[33] he remarked that the  identical proper motions of the two stars forming, to the naked eye, the  single bright orb of Castor could only be explained as both equally due  to the \"systematic parallax\" caused by the sun's movement in space.  Plainly showing that the notion of a physical tie, compelling the two  bodies to travel together, had not as yet entered into his speculations.  But he was eminently open to conviction, and had, moreover, by  observations unparalleled in amount as well as in kind, prepared ample  materials for convincing himself and others. In 1802 he was able to  announce the fact of his discovery, and in the two ensuing years, to lay  in detail before the Royal Society proofs, gathered from the labours of  a quarter of a century, of orbital revolution in the case of as many as  fifty double stars, henceforth, he declared, to be held as real binary  combinations, \"intimately held together by the bond of mutual  attraction.\"[34] The fortunate preservation in Dr. Maskelyne's note-book  of a remark made by Bradley about 1759, to the effect that the line  joining the components of Castor was an exact prolongation of that  joining Castor with Pollux, added eighteen years to the time during  which the pair were under scrutiny, and confirmed the evidence of change  afforded by more recent observations. Approximate periods were fixed for  many of the revolving suns--for Castor 342 years; for Gamma Leonis,  1200, Delta Serpentis, 375, Eta Bootis, 1681 years; Eta Lyrae  was noted as a \"double-double-star,\" a change of relative  situation having been detected in each of the two pairs composing the  group; and the occultation was described of one star by another in the  course of their mutual revolutions, as exemplified in 1795 by the  rapidly circulating system of Zeta Herculis.    Thus, by the sagacity and perseverance of a single observer, a firm  basis was at last provided upon which to raise the edifice of sidereal  science. The analogy long presumed to exist between the mighty star of  our system and the bright points of light spangling the firmament was  shown to be no fiction of the imagination, but a physical reality; the  fundamental quality of attractive power was proved to be common to  matter so far as the telescope was capable of exploring, and law,  subordination, and regularity to give testimony of supreme and  intelligent design no less in those limitless regions of space than in  our narrow terrestrial home. The discovery was emphatically (in Arago's  phrase) \"one with a future,\" since it introduced the element of precise  knowledge where more or less probable conjecture had previously held  almost undivided sway; and precise knowledge tends to propagate itself  and advance from point to point.    We have now to speak of Herschel's pioneering work in the skies. To  explore with line and plummet the shining zone of the Milky Way, to  delineate its form, measure its dimensions, and search out the  intricacies of its construction, was the primary task of his life, which  he never lost sight of, and to which all his other investigations were  subordinate. He was absolutely alone in this bold endeavour. Unaided, he  had to devise methods, accumulate materials, and sift out results. Yet  it may safely be asserted that all the knowledge we possess on this  sublime subject was prepared, and the greater part of it anticipated, by  him.    The ingenious method of \"star-gauging,\" and its issue in the delineation  of the sidereal system as an irregular stratum of evenly-scattered suns,  is the best-known part of his work. But it was, in truth, only a first  rude approximation, the principle of which maintained its credit in the  literature of astronomy a full half-century after its abandonment by its  author. This principle was the general equality of star distribution. If  equal portions of space really held equal numbers of stars, it is  obvious that the number of stars visible in any particular direction  would be strictly proportional to the range of the system in that  direction, apparent accumulation being produced by real extent. The  process of \"gauging the heavens,\" accordingly, consisted in counting the  stars in successive telescopic fields, and calculating thence the depths  of space necessary to contain them. The result of 3,400 such operations  was the plan of the Galaxy familiar to every reader of an astronomical  text-book. Widely-varying evidence was, as might have been expected,  derived from an examination of different portions of the sky. Some  fields of view were almost blank, while others (in or near the Milky  Way) blazed with the radiance of many hundred stars compressed into an  area about one-fourth that of the full-moon. In the most crowded parts  116,000 were stated to have been passed in review within a quarter of an  hour. Here the \"length of his sounding-line\" was estimated by Herschel  at about 497 times the distance of Sirius--in other words, the bounding  orb, or farthest sun of the system in that direction, so far as could be  seen with the 20-foot reflector, was thus inconceivably remote. But  since the distance of Sirius, no less than of every other fixed star,  was as yet an unknown quantity, the dimensions inferred for the Galaxy  were of course purely relative; a knowledge of its form and structure  might (admitting the truth of the fundamental hypothesis) be obtained,  but its real or absolute size remained altogether undetermined.    Even as early as 1785, however, Herschel perceived traces of a tendency  which completely invalidated the supposition of any approach to an  average uniformity of distribution. This was the action of what he  called a \"clustering power\" in the Milky Way. \"Many gathering  clusters\"[35] were already discernible to him even while he endeavoured  to obtain a \"true _mean_ result\" on the assumption that each star in  space was separated from its"]]]
