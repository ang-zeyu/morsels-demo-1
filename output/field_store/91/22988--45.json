In all cases, there were no demonstrable differences in the  distance traveled between captures.    One of the more striking journeys between captures was that of number  59, a juvenal male of _P. maniculatus_, which traveled 1,070 feet  between captures on July 16 and 17, 1963. The route between the two  capture sites was over the most rugged part of the trapping grid. This  datum was excluded from further calculations. The only other animal that  approached this distance was a young female _P. truei_ that traveled 750  feet between captures.    Figure 3 shows the distribution of distances traveled by mice of each  species between successive captures. Since there were no demonstrable  differences between age groups or sexes in the distances traveled, these  data represent a composite of the ages and sexes of each species. They  show 101-125 feet to be the most prevalent of the distances traveled by  both species, and 51-75 feet to have a higher percentage of occurrence  among _P. maniculatus_. These distances indicate that if an animal was  trapped on successive nights, it tended to be trapped within the same  unit of the grid. It would have been necessary for an animal to travel  200 feet or more in order to be caught in traps in an adjoining unit of  the grid.    The distance between captures also was calculated by the more customary  method of averaging the distances between sites of capture, regardless  of the time intervening between captures.    Only data from mice caught four or more times were used because these  individuals probably had home ranges in the study area, whereas those  caught fewer than four times may have been migrants.    The mean distance between captures (n = 95) for 15 males and five  females of _P. maniculatus_ was 161 feet. Sixteen males and 22 females  of _P. truei_ traveled an average of 143 feet between captures (n =  248). For purposes of comparison, these average distances between  captures could be considered as radii of the estimated home ranges. When  the range for each species is calculated by considering average distance  between captures as the radius of the estimated home range, the average  range of _P. truei_ is 64,210 square feet, and that of _P. maniculatus_  is 81,392 square feet. Both of these estimations are larger than those  made by the inclusive and exclusive boundary-strip method (Table 3), and  smaller than those calculated by using adjusted length of range as the  radius.    Since it is known that ranges of some animals tend to be longer than  wide (Mohr and Stumpf, 1966), calculations of estimated range based on  average distance between captures probably are more accurate than those  based on adjusted length of range.    Usually the estimated home ranges were not symmetrical, and did not  resemble oblongs or circles in outline. Rather, the ranges tended to  follow parts of vegetational zones. Since trapping grids are geometrical  in form, there is a tendency among investigators to consider home ranges  of animals as conforming to geometrical design. This may or may not be  the true situation; telemetric studies on larger animals indicate that  home ranges do not conform to geometrical design. At present there is a  poverty of knowledge concerning methods for determining the precise home  ranges of small mammals. Telemetry appears to offer an unlimited  potential for studies of this kind.        [Illustration: FIG. 3: Graphs showing the distribution of distances         between stations at which mice were captured on successive nights         in Mesa Verde National Park. Graphs for each species represent         records of both males and females.]    Individuals of _P. truei_ and _P. maniculatus_ usually do not have  mutually exclusive home ranges. When the home ranges for all females or  males of one species are drawn on a single map of the trapping grid,  almost every one of their ranges overlaps with the range of at least one  other mouse. In some instances, the home range of an individual overlaps  ranges of several other individuals. In extreme cases an animal's range  lies completely within the estimated boundaries of another individual's  range. Such an enclosed range was always that of a juvenile or of a  young animal. However, an adult may have more than half of its range  overlapping with that of another adult of the same sex and of the same,  or different, species.    In general, the two species tended to be restricted to certain areas of  the trapping grid where the respective habitats were more favorable for  their needs. Figure 4 shows the parts of the trapping grid utilized by  each species. Of course there is overlap in the areas utilized by each  species; a few individuals of _P. maniculatus_ may be found in what  appears to be _P. truei_ habitat, and _vice versa_. In such cases, an  inspection of the vegetation usually reveals an intermediate type of  habitat--for example, an open sagebrush area in pinyon-juniper  woodland--that is habitable for either or both species.    The ranges of _P. truei_ tend to be clustered in the western half of the  trapping grid, whereas the ranges of _P. maniculatus_ are clustered in  the eastern half of the grid (Fig. 4). The vegetation of the grid and  the preferred habitats of each species are discussed in following  chapters.    On the basis of the sizes of estimated home ranges, it is possible to  compute the approximate number of individuals of each species that occur  in each acre of appropriate habitat.        [Illustration: FIG. 4: Diagram of trapping grid south of Far View         Ruins, showing the preferred habitats of _P. truei_ and         _P. maniculatus_.]    On the basis of an average home range of 30,206 +- 25,545 square feet  (one standard deviation) for both male and female individuals of _P.  truei_, there should be approximately 0.781 to 9.345 individuals of this  species per acre of pinyon-juniper woodland. An average home range of  29,400 +- 24,570 square feet for males and females of _P. maniculatus_  indicates that the density of this species is between 0.807 and 9.018  animals per acre in mixed shrub or shrub and sagebrush types of  vegetation.    Figure 4 shows that approximately 10 of the 16 units of the trapping  grid are suitable habitat for _P. truei_; the remaining six units are  habitat of _P. maniculatus_. From the preceding calculations of density  one could expect to find between seven and 90 individuals of _P. truei_,  and between five and 54 individuals of _P. maniculatus_ as residents  within the 22.95 acres of the trapping grid. The higher estimates of  density appear to be large enough to compensate for any overlapping of  home ranges.    The calculation of density of each species within the trapping grid is  dependent upon the precision with which the home ranges of individuals  can be estimated. At this time, home ranges of small rodents can not be  measured with great precision, therefore any such calculations are, at  best, only approximations. This does not imply that estimations of home  range are of little value; however, calculations of density, using home  ranges as a basis, tend to amplify the variance inherent in the data.  This amplification is reflected in the wide range between low and high  limits of the densities for each species within the trapping grid.    In order to check on the accuracy of the above calculations, an estimate  of density was made for each species on the basis of trapping data.  Trapping records kept for each animal were checked for the year 1963.  More data on home ranges were obtained in that year due to higher  population densities than in 1964. If an animal was caught four or more  times in 1963, it was considered to be a resident; animals caught in  both 1963 and 1964 were considered to be residents even if caught fewer  than four times. Mice caught three times, with at least a month elapsing  between the first and third captures, were considered to be probable  residents. Other animals caught three or fewer times were considered to  be migrants.    In 1963, 15 individuals of _P. truei_ were caught four or more times, or  in both years, and considered to be residents; six other mice were  classed as probable residents. Of _P. maniculatus_, 18 individuals were  classed as residents, and two as probable residents. Thus the trapping  data for 1963 indicate that 21 individuals of _P. truei_ and 20 of _P.  maniculatus_ were residents of the trapping grid. These estimates lie  well within the estimated limits of density of each species, as  calculated from data on home range while taking into account the  relative proportions of available habitat for each species within the  trapping grid. Analyses of trapping data indicate that the density of  each species probably is overestimated by calculations of density based  on home range data.    Males and females of both species of _Peromyscus_ appeared to be highly  individualistic in the amount of area they utilized. Some adult males of  _P. truei_ covered large areas, whereas others were relatively  sedentary. The same was true of young males of _P. truei_, although the  younger males tended to have smaller ranges than adult males. Most  pregnant or lactating females, of both species, tended to use smaller  areas for their daily activities than did non-pregnant or non-lactating  females. There were notable exceptions to this generality, for some  lactating females had exceptionally large home ranges.    Size of home range apparently was not influenced by the location of an  animal's range within the grid. Far more data would be needed to  correlate minor differences in vegetational associations with sizes of  ranges in different parts of the grid.    It is surprising that adults of _P. truei_ do not have larger home  ranges than adults of _P. maniculatus_. _P. truei_ is the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38961"],[0,"Narrative of the surveying voyages of His Majesty's ships Adventure and Beagle, (#7)"],[1,"foot, and others were got ready to  lay out, for the depth alongside had decreased from eleven to seven  fathoms, and was still falling. Fortunately we had brought up to leeward of  the bank, and suffered no inconvenience; the flood made, and as soon as  possible the ship was shifted to another position, about half a mile to the  S.E., in a situation very favourable for our next attempt to pass the  Narrow. This night the tide fell thirty-six feet, and the stream ran six  knots.    The ensuing morning we made another attempt to get through the Narrow, and,  from having anchored so close to its entrance, by which the full benefit of  the strength, as well as the whole duration of the tide was obtained, we  succeeded in clearing it in two hours, although the distance was more than  twenty miles, and the wind directly against us, the sea, as before,  breaking repeatedly over the ship.    After emerging from the Narrow we had to pass through a heavy 'race' before  we 'reached' out of the influence of the stream that runs between the First  and Second Narrow, but the tide lasted long enough to carry us to a quiet  anchorage. In the evening we weighed again, and reached Gregory Bay, where  the Beagle joined us the next morning.    Since entering the Strait, we had not had any communication {16} with the  Beagle on account of the weather, and the strength of the tide; this  opportunity was therefore taken to supply her with water, of which she had  only enough left for two days.    The greater part of this day was spent on shore, examining the country and  making observations. Large smokes[15] were noticed to the westward. The  shore was strewed with traces of men and horses, and other animals. Foxes  and ostriches were seen; and bones of guanacoes were lying about the  ground.    The country in the vicinity of this anchorage seemed open, low, and covered  with good pasturage. It extends five or six miles, with a gradual ascent,  to the base of a range of flat-topped land, whose summit is about fifteen  hundred feet above the level of the sea. Not a tree was seen; a few  bushes[16] alone interrupted the uniformity of the view. The grass appeared  to have been cropped by horses or guanacoes, and was much interspersed with  cranberry plants, bearing a ripe and juicy, though very insipid fruit.    Next day the wind was too strong and adverse to permit us to proceed. In  the early part of the morning an American sealing vessel, returning from  the Madre de Dios Archipelago on her way to the Falkland Islands, anchored  near us. Mr. Cutler, her master, came on board the Adventure, passed the  day and night with us, and gave me much useful information respecting the  nature of the navigation, and anchorages in the Strait. He told me there  was an Englishman in his vessel who was a pilot for the strait, and willing  to join the ship. I gladly accepted the offer of his services.    In the evening an Indian was observed on horseback riding to and fro upon  the beach, but the weather prevented my sending a boat until the next  morning, when Lieutenant Cooke went on shore to communicate with him and  other Indians who appeared, soon after dawn, upon the beach. On landing, he  was received by them without the least distrust. They were eight or ten in  number, consisting of an old man and his wife, three young men, and the  rest children, all mounted on {17} good horses. The woman, who appeared to  be about fifty years of age, was seated astride upon a pile of skins, hung  round with joints of fresh guanaco meat and dried horse-flesh. They were  all wrapped in mantles, made chiefly of the skins of guanacoes, sewed  together with the sinews of the same animal. These mantles were large  enough to cover the whole body. Some were made of skins of the 'zorillo,'  or skunk, an animal like a pole-cat, but ten times more offensive; and  others, of skins of the puma.    The tallest of the Indians, excepting the old man, who did not dismount,  was rather less than six feet in height. All were robust in appearance, and  with respect to the head, length of body, and breadth of shoulders, of  gigantic size; therefore, when on horseback, or seated in a boat, they  appeared to be tall, as well as large men. In proportion to the parts  above-mentioned, their extremities were very small and short, so that when  standing they seemed but of a moderate size, and their want of proportion  was concealed by the mantle, which enveloped the body entirely, the head  and feet being the only parts exposed.    When Mr. Cooke landed, he presented some medals[17] to the oldest man, and  the woman; and suspended them round their necks. A friendly feeling being  established, the natives dismounted, and even permitted our men to ride  their horses, without evincing the least displeasure, at the free advantage  taken of their good-nature. Mr. Cooke rode to the heights, whence he had a  distinct view of the Second Narrow, and Elizabeth Island, whither, he  explained to the Indians who accompanied him, we were going.    Mr. Cooke returned to the ship with three natives, whom he had induced to  go with us to Elizabeth Island; the others were to meet them, and provide  us with guanaco meat, to which arrangement the elders of the family had,  after {18} much persuasion, assented. At first they objected to their  companions embarking with us, unless we left hostages for their safety; but  as this was refused, they did not press the point, and the three young men  embarked. They went on board singing; in high glee.    While the ship was getting under way, I went ashore to a larger number of  Indians who were waiting on the beach. When my boat landed they were  mounted, and collected in one place. I was surprised to hear the woman  accost me in Spanish, of which, however, she knew but a few words. Having  presented medals to each of the party, they dismounted (excepting the  elders), and in a few minutes became quite familiar. By this time Captain  Stokes had landed, with several of his officers, who increased our party to  nearly double the number of theirs: notwithstanding which they evinced  neither fear nor uneasiness. The woman, whose name was Maria, wished to be  very communicative; she told me that the man was her husband, and that she  had five children. One of the young men, whom we afterwards found to be a  son of Maria, who was a principal person of the tribe, was mounted upon a  very fine horse, well groomed, and equipped with a bridle and saddle that  would have done credit to a respectable horseman of Buenos Ayres or Monte  Video. The young man wore heavy brass spurs, like those of the Guachos of  Buenos Ayres. The juvenile and feminine appearance of this youth made us  think he was Maria's daughter, nor was it until a subsequent visit that our  mistake was discovered. The absence of whiskers and beard gives all the  younger men a very effeminate look, and many cannot be distinguished, in  appearance, from the women, but by the mode in which they wrap their  mantles around them, and by their hair, which is turned up and confined by  a fillet of worsted yarn. The women cross their mantle over the breast like  a shawl, and fasten it together with two iron pins or skewers, round which  are twisted strings of beads and other ornaments. They also wear their hair  divided, and gathered into long tresses or tails, which hang one before  each ear; and those who have short hair, wear false tails made of  horse-hair. Under {19} their mantle the women wear a sort of petticoat, and  the men a triangular piece of hide instead of breeches. Both sexes sit  astride, but the women upon a heap of skins and mantles, when riding. The  saddles and stirrups used by the men are similar to those of Buenos Ayres.  The bits, also, are generally of steel; but those who cannot procure steel  bits have a sort of snaffle, of wood, which must, of course, be frequently  renewed. Both sexes wear boots, made of the skins of horses' hind legs, of  which the parts about the hock joints serve for the heels. For spurs, they  use pieces of wood, pointed with iron, projecting backwards two or three  inches on each side of the heel, connected behind by a broad strap of hide,  and fastened under the foot and over the instep by another strap.    The only weapons which we observed with these people were the 'bolas,' or  balls, precisely similar to those used by the Pampas Indians; but they are  fitter for hunting than for offence or defence. Some are furnished with  three balls, but in general there are only two. These balls are made of  small bags or purses of hide, moistened, filled with iron pyrites, or some  other heavy substance, and then dried. They are about the size of a hen's  egg, and attached to the extremities of a thong, three or four yards in  length. To use them, one ball is held in the hand, and the other swung  several times around the head until both are thrown at the object, which  they rarely miss. They wind round it violently, and if it be an animal,  throw it down. The bolas, with three balls, similarly connected together,  are thrown in the same manner.    As more time could not be spared we went on board, reminding the natives,  on leaving them, of their promise to bring us some guanaco meat. Aided by  the tide, the ships worked to windward through the Second Narrow, and  reached an anchorage out of the strength of tide, but in an exposed  situation. The wind having been very strong and against the tide, the ship  had much motion, which made our Patagonian passengers very sick, and  heartily sorry for trusting themselves afloat. One of them, with tears in  his eyes, begged to be landed, but was soon convinced of the difficulty of  compliance, {20} and satisfied with our promise of sending him ashore on  the morrow.    After we anchored, the wind increased to a gale, in which the ship pitched  so violently as to injure our windlass. Its construction was bad  originally, and "]]]
