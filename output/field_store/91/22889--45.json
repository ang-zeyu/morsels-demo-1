S Fort Nelson, 1.    _Remarks._--Of three specimens obtained at the Unahini River, two  males resemble each other closely, while the third, an old adult  represented by an unsexed skull with broken cranium, is markedly  different, the skull being noticeably shorter with shorter rostrum and  lower jaw and other distinctive features. It closely resembles the  skull of an adult male taken at the Aishihik River. Furthermore, the  first two animals show close relationships with an unsexed skull which  Alcorn obtained at the Buckinghorse River in British Columbia.    Two males taken at the Unahini River in the Yukon Territory have the  following external measurements: Total length, 1933, 1812; tail, 150,  96; hind foot, 262, 260; ear from notch, 129, 131. Other specimens,  skulls only, obtained from native hunters, are partly broken. Alcorn  writes that the local hunters always shoot a grizzly in the head to be  certain that it is dead.

It continued and went out of sight. I waited about two  minutes and then started a series of loud squeaks. To our surprise we  soon saw what we judged was the same mink. In company with this mink  were five others.... These mink were much interested in the squeaking  noise and some came within 10 feet of me. They stayed on land most of  the time but some of them made short swims a few feet out into the  lake. One had a white chin, another had a white spot on its chest.

When making a bend like that in Fig. 7, to secure that the arms of the  tube _C_ and _D_, and the curve at _B_, shall be in one plane, the tube  should be held in a position perpendicular to the body, and brought into  the position shown in the figure during bending, by which means it will  be found easy to secure a good result. Lead glass tubes must be removed  from the flame before they become hot enough to undergo reduction. If  they should become blackened, however, the stain may be removed by  re-heating in the oxidising flame (see p. 18).    When a very sharp bend is to be made, it is sometimes best to heat a  narrow zone of the glass rather highly in the blow-pipe flame, and to  blow the bend into shape at the moment of bending it, as previously  described, one end having been closed for that purpose beforehand. Lead  glass should be heated for this purpose in the oxidising flame (pp. 17  to 22).    The processes of bending large tubes, making U-tubes and spiral tubes,  are more difficult operations, and will be explained in Chap. IV.      =Rounding and Bordering the Ends of Tubes.=--After cutting a piece of  glass tube in two pieces, the sharp edges left at its ends should be  rounded by holding them in a flame for a few moments till the glass  begins to melt. The oxidising point of a pointed flame may be used for  both kinds of glass. The flame will be coloured yellow by soda glass at  the moment of melting. This indication of the condition of soda glass  should be noted, for it serves as a criterion of the condition of the  glass. The ends of soda glass tubes may also be rounded in the flame of  a common Bunsen's burner.    When the end of a tube is to be closed with a cork or stopper, its  mouth should be expanded a little, or =bordered=. To do this, heat the  end of the tube by rotating it in the flame till it softens, then remove  it from the flame, at once introduce the charcoal cone (Fig. 5, p. 11),  and rotate it with gentle pressure against the softened glass till the  desired effect is produced. In doing this it is very important that the  end of the tube shall be uniformly heated, in order that the enlargement  shall be of regular form. If the tube cannot be sufficiently expanded at  one operation, it should be re-heated and the process repeated.    Borders, such as are seen on test-tubes, are made by pressing the  softened edge of the tube against a small iron rod. The end of the rod  should project over the softened edge of the tube at a slight angle, and  be pressed against it, passing the rod round the tube, or rotating the  tube under the rod.    =Sealing=, that is closing the ends of tubes, or other openings, in  glass apparatus.    In performing this and all the other operations of glass blowing, the  following points must be constantly kept in mind:--    (_a._) That it is rarely safe to blow glass whilst it is still in the  flame, except in certain special cases that will be mentioned  subsequently. Therefore always remove apparatus from the flame before  blowing.    (_b._) That when heating glass tubes, unless it is specially desired to  heat one portion only, the tube must be constantly rotated in the flame  to ensure that it shall be uniformly heated, and to prevent the tube or  mass of glass from assuming an irregular form.    (_c._) Always blow gently at first, and slowly increase the force  applied till you feel or see the glass giving way. It is a good plan to  force the air forward in successive short blasts rather than in one  continued stream.    (_d._) When it is necessary to force air into tubes of fine bore, such  as thermometer tubes, the mouth must not be used, for moisture is  thereby introduced into the tube, which it is very difficult to remove  again in many cases. All tubes of very small bore should be blown with  the aid of an india-rubber blowing-bottle, such as are used for  spray-producers, Galton's whistles, etc. The tube to be blown must be  securely fixed to the neck of the bottle, which is then held in one  hand, and air is forced from it into the tube as it is required. These  bottles are frequently of service to the glass-blower--_e.g._, when  tubes of very fine bore have to be united, it is necessary to maintain  an internal pressure slightly exceeding that of the air throughout the  operation, in order to prevent the viscous glass from running together  and closing the tube. An india-rubber blowing-ball is very convenient  for this purpose.    To seal the end of a glass tube (Fig. 8), adjust the flame so that it  will heat a zone of glass about as broad as the diameter of the tube to  be sealed (see _A_, Fig. 8). Hold the tube on each side of the point  where it is to be sealed in the manner described in the description of  bending glass tubes (p. 28). Bring the tube gradually into the flame,  and heat it with constant rotation, till the glass softens (for lead  glass the oxidising flame must be used, as has been already  explained).[6] When the glass begins to thicken, gently pull asunder the  two ends, taking care not to pull out the softened glass too much, but  to allow the sides to fall together, as shown at _A_. When this has  occurred, heat the glass at the narrow part till it melts, and pull  asunder the two ends. The closed end should present the appearance  shown at _D_. If the glass be drawn out too quickly its thickness will  be unduly reduced, and it will present the appearance shown at _B_. In  that case apply a pointed flame at _b_, and repeat the previous  operation so as to contract the tube as at _c_, taking care not to allow  the glass to become much increased nor decreased in thickness.    [6] Remember that when the lead glass is heated to the proper  temperature it will present an appearance which may be described as a  greenish phosphorescence. At higher temperatures it assumes an  orange-red appearance. If it loses its transparency and assumes a dull  appearance, it must be moved further into the oxidising parts of the  flame.    If a considerable mass of glass be left at _d_, it may be removed by  heating it to redness, touching it with the pointed end of a cold glass  tube, to which it will adhere, and by which it may be pulled away.    [Illustration: FIG. 8.]    When the end of the tube presents the appearance shown in the diagram  _D_, and the mass of glass at _d_ is small, the small lump that remains  must be removed by heating it till it softens, and _gently_ blowing with  the mouth, so as to round the end and distribute the glass more  regularly, as shown in _E_. The whole end, from the dotted line _e_,  must then be heated with constant rotation in the flame. If this final  heating of the end _e_ be done skilfully, the glass will probably  collapse and flatten, as at _F_. The end must then be gently blown into  the form shown at _G_.    If a flat end to the tube be desired, the tube may be left in the  condition shown by _F_, or a thin rounded end may be flattened by  pressure on a plate of iron.    If a concave end be wished for, it is only necessary to gently suck air  from the tube before the flattened end has become solid.    In each case, _immediately_ after the tube is completed, it must be  closely wrapped in cotton wool and left to cool. With good lead glass  this last process, though advantageous, is not absolutely necessary; and  as glass cools slowly when enveloped in cotton wool, this precaution may  frequently be neglected in the case of apparatus made from lead glass.    [Illustration: FIG. 9.]    In order to draw out tubes for sealing, close to one end, and thus to  avoid waste of material, it is a good plan to heat simultaneously the  end of the glass tube _A_ which is to be sealed, and one end of a piece  of waste tube _E_ of about the same diameter, and when they are fused to  bring them together as at _DD_ (Fig. 9). _E_ will then serve as a handle  in the subsequent operations on _A_. Such a rough joint as that at _D_  must not be allowed to cool too much during the work in hand, or _E_ and  _A_ may separate at an inconvenient moment. Or the glass at the end of  the tube may be pressed together to close the tube, and the mass of  glass may be seized with a pair of tongs and drawn away.      =Choking, or Contracting the Bore of a Glass Tube.=--If it be not  desired to maintain the uniformity of external dimensions of the tube  whilst decreasing the diameter of the bore, the tube may be heated and  drawn out as described in the description of sealing tubes on pp. 32-35.  This may be done as shown at _A_ or _B_ in Fig. 8, according to the use  to which the contracted tube is to be put.    [Illustration: FIG. 10.]    Greater strength and elegance will be secured by preserving the external  diameter of the tube unchanged throughout, as shown in Fig. 10. For this  purpose heat the tube with the pointed flame, if it be small, or in the  brush flame if it be of large size, constantly rotating it till the  glass softens and the sides show an inclination to fall together, when  this occurs, push the two ends gently towards _A_. If the tube should  become too much thickened at _A_, the fault may be corrected by removing  it from the flame and gently pulling the two ends apart till it is of  the proper size. If the bore at the contracted part of the tube should  become too much reduced, it may be enlarged by closing one end of the  tube with a small cork, and blowing gently into the open end after  sufficiently heating the contracted part. The tube should be rotated  during blowing or the enlargement produced may be irregular.    When the external diameter of the tube is to be increased as well as its  bore diminished, press together the ends of a tube heated at the part to  be contracted, as already described, and regulate the size of the bore  by blowing into the tube if at any time it threatens to become too much"]]]
