And they ask more of religionists  than they are willing to give. Dr. Lionel Beale, an English physiologist  has written a volume of three hundred and eighty pages to prove that the  phenomena of life, instinct and intellect, are not referable to the  blind forces of nature. He avows his belief that mind governs matter;  that a \"never-changing, all-seeing, power-directing and matter-guiding  Omnipotence\" presides over all things. He also avows faith in the  miracles underlying Christianity. But Prof. Huxley says, there is  overwhelming and crushing evidence that no event has ever occurred on  this earth which was not the effect of natural causes, meaning thereby  physical causes. The factor of a divine intelligence he sets aside as of  no consequence. His words are, \"the doctrine that belief in a personal  God is necessary to any religion, worthy of the name, is a mere matter  of opinion.\"    Tyndall, Carpenter and Henry Thompson teach that \"prayer is  superstitious absurdity.\" Herbert Spencer is regarded by infidels as the  \"great philosopher,\" and he labors to prove that there can not be a  personal God, or human spirit or self; that moral laws are simply  \"generalizations of utility,\" or, as Carl Vogt would have us believe,  that self-respect, and not the will of God, is the basis and law of  moral obligation. And Mr. Haeckel would have us believe that a few  \"monistic materialists\" are the only men entitled to a hearing upon the  question of \"Evolution.\" So he excludes all true and intelligent  Christians, for they are not and can not be \"monistic materialists.\"    His words are, \"It is only a select few, therefore, of learned and  philosophical monistic materialists who are entitled to be heard on  questions of the highest moment to every individual man, and to human  society.\" But just what the man means by the \"_highest moment_\" we are  anxious to know, as he is the most blank negative of religion that we  can conceive. When he attempts to answer the religious objections to  evolution, or, as he terms it, the descendence theory, he  unceremoniously dismisses them as beneath his notice, giving his only  argument, viz.: \"All faith is superstition.\" He disposes of the  objections drawn from first, or intuitive truths, by a simple denial of  their existence, asserting that all our knowledge is from our senses.  The objection that so many noted naturalists reject evolution, as it is  advocated by himself and others, he considers at some length. He says,  first, \"Many have grown old in another way of thinking and can not be  expected to change.\" Second, \"Many are collectors of facts, without  studying their relations, or, they are destitute of the genius for  generalization, and so, can not rear the building. Others, again, are  specialists.\" He says \"It is not enough that a man should be versed in  one department, he must be at home in all, in Botany, Zoology,  Comparative Anatomy, Biology, Geology and Paleontology. He must be able  to survey the whole field.\" His next, and mainly, is the statement that  naturalists are generally _lamentably deficient_ in philosophical  culture and spirit. He says \"The immovable edifice of the true monistic  science, or what is the same thing, natural science, can only arise  through the most intimate interaction and mutual interpretation of  philosophy and observation.\" (See Philosophie and Empirie, pp. 638-641.)    This statement alone should stir up all Deists to a consideration of  their teaching touching the sufficiency of the \"Book of Nature;\" for if  it be true, then we must expect some other revelation, or be left to the  conclusion that the Great Father has left his creatures in a great  measure in a state of helplessness, unless Mr. Haeckel, or some other  man like himself, can show us that the \"Great Spirit\" intended that he,  and others like him, should do our thinking for us, seeing that we are  incapable through mental deficiency, of raising the edifice, and seeing  that, Mr. Huxley advises us poor (?) theologians to \"let it alone.\" And  Mr. Haeckel himself would not allow that any man is entitled to a  hearing until he comprehends Biology, Botany, Comparative Anatomy,  Zoology, Geology and Paleontology. Ho! evolutionists, ninety-nine out of  every hundred of you, get out! You have no right to speak on the  subject; otherwise, Haeckel is one of the foolish men, and talks  without understanding himself. You must be at home in all those  sciences, and emancipate yourselves from all religious beliefs before  you have a right to be heard upon the grave question of evolution from  an ancestral moneron; for you are incapable of comprehending your own  _monistic_--_materialistic origin_. For, according to Haeckel, before a  man is entitled to be heard he must renounce all faith in God, in the  Bible, in the human spirit, and in the future life. Mr. Haeckel knows a  great deal? Well, there are some very weighty men in this world? But,  when they are in the east, our planet does not tip up in the west? We  Christians have no right to be heard? Mr. Huxley advises us to keep our  mouths shut (?). Well, that is grand? It correllates so beautifully with  \"_free thought_\" and \"free speech.\"    One evolutionist is all the time spreading himself about the preachers  of religion knowing nothing in science, and another is saying to them,  let science alone, and another says you can't rear the building if you  try; you don't know enough. What a grand harmony there is just here? We  theologians would advise \"natural selection to be present with such  instructors as thus advise us, and continue with them long enough, at  least, to reject the worst from the school and give us a blessing in the  survival of the fittest, for we would like to know our duty.\" _So much  for liberalism and broad principles._    \"Monistic materialism,\" according to Haeckel, finds its primeval parent  in a moneron, a creature of one substance, and that a semi-albuminous  fluid. Now, it would be very interesting to know just how all the  different substances, in all the creatures of this earth, got in, in  order to get out, for involution lies behind evolution. But then, we  theologians \"have no right to be heard?\" \"are not entitled to be heard?\"  and, besides this, Mr. Haeckel has set aside intuitive, or first truths,  and, as all axiomatic truths are of this class, perhaps it is wrong for  us to bother you with our logic? Nevertheless we can't refrain from  speaking our piece; we are advocates of free thought and free speech.    It must be conceded that there was a time when life and organisms began  to exist upon our planet. From whence did they come, and how? The  \"high-priest\" of Germany, who claims to be entitled to a hearing, says,  by \"spontaneous generation\" they first appeared in the \"monera.\" His  words are these, \"Only such homogeneous organizations as are yet not  differentiated and are similar to the inorganic crystals in being  homogeneously composed of one single substance, could arise by  spontaneous generation, and could become the primeval parents of all  other organisms.\" Such is Haeckel's germ of life.    Did it always exist? Is a moneron an eternal life germ? No. Neither  Haeckel or Darwin advocates such a foolish idea; nor yet the idea of  life-germs always existing. Life-germs are material organisms, and they  may be alive or dead; for we know there is no period in the history of a  living organism when it is not liable to die.    Spontaneous generation does not correlate with the idea that \"life-germs  always existed.\" And it is also opposed to the Christian idea that all  life is from God, the eternal, ever-living spirit. So we Christians say,  there is no life without antecedent life. If men prefer to deify  life-germs, of course that is their business, but we have no disposition  to accept a distinction without a difference, excepting the sacrifice of  our common sense. It is more rational to believe in an ever-living  intelligence as the source of all life, intelligence and moral nature.  Did an eternal life-germ evolve all the forms of organic life known upon  our earth? The eternal life-germ idea of materialistic philosophy  represents no evolutionists of any note whatever. I know of one  gentlemen only, at the present writing, that it represents. Haeckel  says, We can, therefore, from these general outlines of the inorganic  history of the earth's crust deduce the important fact, that at a  certain definite time life had its beginning on our earth, and that  terrestrial organisms did not exist from eternity, but at a certain  period came into existence for the first time.    The _godless advocates_ of spontaneous generation thus allow that life  in its first appearance was without antecedent life; and so more was  produced by the blind forces than was in nature to be evolved. Tell me  how that was done, and I will tell you how to create something out of  nothing. Haeckel says, \"All the different forms of organisms which  people are usually inclined to look upon as the products of creative  power acting for a definite purpose, we, according to the theory of  selection, can conceive as the necessary productions of natural  selection, working without a purpose.\"--_History of Creation, Vol. 1,  pp. 176-327._ He says, \"We have before this become acquainted with the  simplest of all species of organisms in the _monera_, whose entire  bodies when completely developed consist of nothing but a semi-fluid  albuminous lump; they are organisms which are of the utmost importance  for the theory of the first origin of life.\"--_History of Creation, Vol.  1, p. 330._    Here we part with our friends of the Haeckel school. They maintain that  there was life without antecedent life, and so get more out of dead  atoms than was in them, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28673"],[0,"The Christian Foundation, Or, Scientific and Religious Journal, Volume I, No. (#7)"],[1,"baptized before the end of the first  year of his reign, and immediately published an edict in support of the  doctrine of the Trinity, branding all who did not hold it as heretics.  His council was presided over by St. Gregory Nazianzen. The chief work  of this council was to anathematise the Council of Rimini, which was  composed of six hundred bishops and a multitude of priests. This work  was done, and so one hundred and fifty bishops curse and denounce as  heretical and false six hundred bishops and a multitude of priests; so  the voice of the many is not always the voice of God, nor yet the voice  of a council the voice of a Pope; neither is the infallibility of a Pope  always found in a council, nor is the infallibility of one Pope always  found in the voice of another.    Theodosius II. convened a council in 431. Nestorius, bishop of  Constantinople, seems to have been the cause of this convocation, having  persecuted all who were not of his opinions; now undergoes persecution  for having plead that the Holy Virgin Mary was not the mother of God. He  plead that Jesus Christ being the word, _consubstantial_ with the  Father, Mary could not, at the same time, be the mother of God the  Father and of God the Son. To settle this quarrel Nestorius demands a  council and obtains it. This council condemned Nestorius, and one of its  committees displaced Cyril. The Emperor, Theodosius II., reversed all  that was done, and then permitted it to reassemble. The deputies from  Rome, John, Patriarch of Antioch, with twenty-six suffragans, arrived  five days after the transaction, and it is on record that his arrival  was followed by one of the most distinguished cursing matches of  antiquity. The Roman bishops on occasions of this character always had  recourse to cursing, and they scarcely ever failed to ease themselves up  with an overflow of anathemas and execrations. Cyril and Nestorius  exchanged mutual imprecations, even before the sitting of the council.  The saint, it is said, had launched twelve anathemas at the heretic in  an Alexandrian synod in the year 430, and the heretic Nestorius thanked  the saint by returning the same number of inverted blessings. This has  been a heavy business among Popes for many centuries. John and Cyril  engaged in the same kind of warfare immediately after John's arrival at  Ephesus. John and his party congratulated Cyril, Memnon, and their  accomplices by deposing and excommunicating them, and now the parties  continue, for some time, to give vent to their feelings in mutual  anathemas. These benedictions were the only articles of mutual exchange,  current and of legal tender value between the parties. At last the  Emperor had Nestorius and Cyril arrested, and ordered all the bishops to  return each to his church, and so no conclusion was reached. The Greeks  called the second assembly at Ephesus a gang of felons, but the first,  it is said, excelled it in all the arts of villainy. The contest was  finally ended, not by the church, but by the state. The Emperor  reinstated Cyril and banished Nestorius, and the western diocese was in  the end reduced to submission and the church to unity, not by  ecclesiastical authority, but by imperial power. (See Evagrius 1, 5;  Liberatus c. 6; Godeau 3, 310.) The Council of Chalcedon met in the year  451. St. Leo, bishop of Rome, took the advantage of the troubles which  the quarrel about the two natures occasioned in the empire, and presided  at the council by his legates, which was a new feature in councils. But  the fathers of the council apprehending that the church of the west  would, from this precedent, pretend to the superiority over the eastern  church, decided, by their twenty-eighth canon, that the see of  Constantinople and the see of Rome should enjoy alike the same  advantages and privileges. This was the origin of the long enmity which  prevailed and still prevails between the two churches, the eastern and  the western. This council endorsed and established the \"two natures in  one person.\" The twenty-eighth canon of this council has been rejected  and condemned by the Latins, yet Pelagius, Gregory, Pascal and Boniface  acknowledged this council, thereby placing the seal of infallibility  upon it as much as they ever did upon other councils.    In 553 Justinian assembled a council at Constantinople to discuss the  three chapters, as they were designated, composed by Ibas, Theodoret and  Theodorus. Vigilius, bishop of Rome, with bishops and deacons from  Italy, Africa and the east, was in Constantinople during the entire  sittings of this council, and refused to attend although invited. But  the council went on, all the same. His infallibility, supported by his  clique, opposed the emperor and his council, but in vain. He formed his  bishops and deacons into a separate council, published a constitution  defending, in _modified terms_, the three chapters, and interdicting all  further discussion upon the subject by the authority of the Apostolic  See; pronounced anathemas against the persons and defenders of the  authors of the three chapters. Having now made himself a partisan of the  authors, who were condemned by the emperor's council, he was cursed for  promoting heresy, and banished in dishonor. This served to bring him to  his senses upon several matters, and so he turned about and approved  what he had before condemned. And so heresy was converted into orthodoxy  by the magical power of an emperor at the expense of the infallibility  of Vigilius. The Italians, Tuscans, Ligurians, Istrians, French,  Illyrians and Africans, who took a stand against the emperor, were like  the pope, the \"vicar general of God,\" converted by the sword of  Justinian. The Italian clergy who resisted were banished.    \"In 681 there was a council at Constantinople, convoked by Constantine,  _the bearded_. This council was called by the Latins '_in trullo_,'  because it was held in an apartment of the imperial palace. The emperor  himself presided. The bishops of Constantinople and Antioch were on his  right hand, and the deputies from Jerusalem and Rome were on his left.  In this council it was decided that Jesus Christ had two wills.\" Here  \"Pope Honorius I. was condemned as a monothelite, that is, as wishing  Jesus Christ to have but one will.\" O, shame! What will come next? Well,  we are out at sea in the very darkest periods of the dark ages, and  there is no telling how much our senses may be shocked. We find next  what is known as the Second Council of Nice. It was assembled by a  woman, Mrs. Irene, in the name of her son, whose eyes she had caused to  be put out. Her husband, Leo, had abolished the worship of images as  leading to idolatry. This woman re-established this worship. During  Constantine's minority she executed the imperial power. She was a bold  defender and patron of emblematic or image worship. It is said that she  had the ambition of Lucifer and the malignity of a demon. She is accused  of being connected with the murder of her husband. \"She put out the eyes  of Nicephorus, and amputated the tongues of Christopher, Nicetas,  Athenius and Eudoxas, Constantine's sons, for _suspicion_ of conspiracy.  She destroyed the eyes of her own son.\" \"No woman,\" says Bruys, \"was  ever less worthy of life than this princess.\" Her ambition, says Godeau,  made her violate all the laws of God and man. Now listen, but first  prepare to experience all that the opposite extreme can possibly  produce. Is there any place in your nature where life and death, or  heaven and hell, can meet in festive joys? No. Then bear with my story  the best you can, for it must be told. Here it is: Theodorus and  Theophanes extol that vile woman for her VIRTUE AND EXCELLENCE(?). The  Greeks placed her among the saints in their menology, and in holy  festivity celebrate her anniversary. Hartman and Binius, in more modern  times, flatter her prudence and piety(?). Alexander lauds her religion  and faith as worthy of immortal honor(?), though the blinding of her  son, he admits, exposed her to reprehension. Baronius justifies the  assassination of her son. He commends the inhumanity which arose from  zeal for religion. Here let the curtain drop till my next on councils  makes its appearance.          INFIDELS IN EVIDENCE IN FAVOR OF CHRISTIANITY.      We should not be surprised when wicked men of every grade of character  assail our religion, for its great Author erected a standard of duty too  perfect to suit their unruly passions and lusts. Opposition to  Christianity is the natural correllate of an unregenerated heart. This  fact was the cause of all the sufferings of the primitive Christians,  not the only cause, but the _first_ and _leading_ cause. One striking  circumstance is worthy of notice, which is, that they have censured  Christians for their zeal with an unsparing tongue, and, at the same  time, they have shown as much if not more vehemence and obstinacy in  their own good-for-nothing opposition. Every kind of opposition has been  manifested which the ingenuity of man could dictate. Indeed, there is  little urged against Christianity in our day that is original. Almost  every cavil and argument may be traced to Voltaire, Porphyry, Celsus and  Julian, the old enemies of the Christ. Infidels, who dislike (will you  hear it?) the labor and trouble of investigating the question of the  claims of the Christian religion upon their intelligence, seize with  avidity upon the labors of others and parade them before the public  mind. Just now there is no question put so often by men who feign to be  unbelievers as, \"What do you think of Colonel Ingersoll?\" \"He stirs you  up.\" The little city of Logansport was favored not a great while in the  past with a visit and lecture from the Colonel. After the lecture was  over some half a dozen gentlemen were taking a lunch at an eating  restaurant, and there was one very talkative creature in the group who  had"]]]
