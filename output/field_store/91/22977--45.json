In  whatever series we study them, we can readily find the relationship of  the different parts; it is very easy to recognise the same bones in the  upper limbs of the human being, the wings of the bat (Fig. 8) and of  birds (Fig. 21), and in the anterior paddles of the seal (Fig. 9) and of  the dolphin.    [Illustration: FIG. 8.--ANTERIOR LIMB OF THE BAT: LEFT SIDE, ANTERIOR  SURFACE.    1, Clavicle; 2, scapula; 3, humerus; 4, radius; 5, cubitus; 6, carpus;  7, thumb; 8, metacarpus; 9, phalanges.]    In quadrupeds, the shoulder and arm are hidden, the latter more or less  completely, in the muscular mass which binds it to the lateral wall of  the trunk; so that the anterior limbs only present; free from the trunk:  the elbow, forearm, and hand.      The Shoulder    In some vertebrates, the shoulder is formed of two bones--the scapula  and clavicle; in others of only one bone--the scapula; the clavicle in  this case does not exist.    =The Scapula or Omoplate.=--The scapula is situated on the lateral  surface of the thorax, and is directed obliquely, from above downwards  and from behind forwards.    We must first recall, so as to be able to make a comparison, that in man  this bone is placed at the posterior surface of the thoracic cage; so  that if we look at the human thorax on one of its lateral aspects we see  chiefly the external border of the scapula; it is the external surface  (homologous to the posterior surface of the human scapula) which we see  in its full extent when we look on the same surface of the thorax in  quadrupeds.    [Illustration: FIG. 9.--ANTERIOR LIMB OF THE SEAL: LEFT SIDE, EXTERNAL  SURFACE.    1, Scapula; 2, humerus; 3, radius; 4, ulna; 5, carpus; 6, metacarpus; 7,  phalanges of the fingers.]    To sum up, if we fancy the human being in the position of the quadruped,  the scapula will have its surfaces almost parallel to the ground (Fig.  10); while in quadrupeds, the surfaces are situated in a plane which is  almost perpendicular to the ground (Fig. 11). This position of the  scapula in an almost vertical plane is designed to give the necessary  point of support to the osseous columns that form the skeleton of the  other portions of the anterior limbs.    Because of this position of the scapula (Figs. 12 and 13), the spinal  border is superior, the cervical, anterior, and the axillary, posterior.  In direct contrast to what obtains in the human scapula, the spinal  border is the shortest of the three; except in the bat, and the  majority of the cetaceans.    [Illustration: FIG. 10.--SITUATION AND DIRECTION OF THE SCAPULA IN THE  HUMAN BEING, THE TRUNK BEING HORIZONTAL, AS IN QUADRUPEDS. VERTICAL AND  TRANSVERSE SECTION OF THE THORAX (DIAGRAMMATIC FIGURE).    1, Contour of the thorax; 2, 2, the scapula.]    [Illustration: FIG. 11.--POSITION AND DIRECTION OF THE SCAPULA IN  QUADRUPEDS. VERTICAL AND TRANSVERSE SECTION OF THE THORAX (DIAGRAMMATIC  FIGURE).    1, Contour of the thorax; 2, 2, the scapula.]    In certain animals (in the ungulates [_hoofed_[6]]--pigs, oxen, sheep,  horses) the superior, or spinal, border of the scapula is surmounted by  a cartilage called _the cartilage of prolongation_.      [6] For the definition of the word _hoofed_, see p. 37.    This is the cause why the border to which it is fixed is so slightly  noticeable under the skin in these animals; indeed, in the upper part,  the bone and cartilage are not distinguishable in the contour of the  corresponding region of the back; being applied to the lateral surfaces  of the spinous processes, the prominence formed by the extremities of  which is directly continuous with the plane of the scapula (Fig. 16).    [Illustration: FIG. 12.--LEFT SCAPULA OF THE HUMAN BEING, POSTERIOR  SURFACE, PLACED IN THE POSITION WHICH IT WOULD OCCUPY IN THE SKELETON OF  A QUADRUPED.    1, Cervical border; 2, spinal border; 3, axillary border; 4,  supraspinous fossa; 5, subspinous fossa; 6, scapular spine; 7, glenoid  cavity; 8, coracoid process; 9, acromion process.]    [Illustration: FIG. 13.--LEFT SCAPULA OF A HORSE: EXTERNAL SURFACE.    1, Cervical border; 2, spinal border--the scapula here represented,  being from a hoofed animal, has a cartilage of extension attached to its  spinal border; 3, axillary border; 4, supraspinous fossa; 5, subspinous  fossa; 6, spine of the scapula; 7, glenoid cavity; 8, coracoid process.  The scapula of the horse has no acromion process, but it is easy, if we  compare the human scapula, to judge of the position which this process  would occupy if it were present.]    In quadrupeds whose scapula, on the contrary, is wanting in the  cartilage of prolongation (in the _clawed_,[7] such as the cat and dog),  the superior border of the scapula is visible, especially when the  animal is resting on its fore-limbs, particularly when it crouches; at  such a time the skin is markedly raised by that border; and the spinous  processes of the vertebrae, beyond which it projects, occupy the bottom  of a fossa (Fig. 15). The internal surface of the scapula is turned  towards the ribs; it is known, as in man (in whom this surface is  anterior), as the subscapular fossa.      [7] For the definition of this word, see p. 37.    [Illustration: FIG. 14.--VERTICAL AND TRANSVERSE SECTION, AT THE SITE OF  THE SHOULDERS, OF THE THORAX OF THE HORSE (DIAGRAMMATIC FIGURE).    1, Outline of the thorax at the level of the third dorsal vertebra; 2,  2, scapula; 3, spinal border of the scapula; 4, cartilage of  prolongation; 5, contour of the skin.]    [Illustration: FIG. 15.--VERTICAL AND TRANSVERSE SECTION, AT THE PLANE  OF THE SHOULDERS, OF THE THORAX OF A DOG (DIAGRAMMATIC FIGURE).    1, Outline of the thorax at the level of the third dorsal vertebra; 2,  2, scapula; 3, spinal border of the scapula; 4, contour of the skin.]    Its external surface is divided into two parts by the spine of the  scapula; which, in some animals, terminates inferiorly in a flat and  clearly distinct process, the homologue of the acromion process of the  human scapula. The two regions separated by the spine are known as the  supraspinous fossa and the infraspinous fossa. The supraspinous fossa is  anterior to the spine, and the infraspinous is posterior to it. The  surfaces of the scapula are, in quadrupeds, flatter than in the human  being, and in particular the subscapular fossa, which is also less  concave. Some authors attribute this to the lesser curvature of the ribs  in quadrupeds. A few words will suffice to prove that there must be  another reason. The scapula is not in immediate contact with the ribs;  the subscapular fossa is not moulded on them. Besides, the form of the  scapula is, as in other parts of the skeleton, dependent on the  disposition of muscles, and the development of these latter is  correlated to the extent and energy of the movements which the  individual is able or required to execute. But the movements which  those muscles produce (more especially the rotation of the humerus) are,  in quadrupeds, less extensive than in the human being; and,  consequently, the muscles which produce them are, proportionally, less  strongly developed. The inferior angle (superior and external in man),  situated at the junction of the cervical and axillary borders, presents  the glenoid cavity, which, looking downwards, receives the articular  surface of the superior extremity of the bone of the arm--that is to  say, the head of the humerus. Above this cavity, on the lower part of  the cervical border, is situated a tubercle which reminds us of the  coracoid process of the human scapula. The region occupied by the  glenoid cavity is separated from the body of the bone by a  constriction--the neck of the scapula.    In birds the scapula is elongated in a direction parallel to the  vertebral column, and very narrow in the opposite (Fig. 18): it is also  flat, and has no spine. Its coracoid process is represented by a  peculiar bone--the coracoidean or coracoid bone--which we shall describe  later on when we come to the study of the clavicle and of the anterior  region of the shoulder (see p. 26).    =The Clavicle.=--The clavicle is found only in the human being, and in  animals whose anterior limbs, possessing great freedom of movement in  all directions, require that the scapula should possess a point of  support which, while affording this, can be displaced with it, or draw  it in certain directions. Now, this point of support is furnished by the  clavicle.    In animals possessed of hoofs (ungulates), such as the sheep, ox, and  horse, the clavicle does not exist. Indeed, in them the freedom of  movement of the anterior limbs is limited; they move by projection in  the forward and backward directions only; they merely fulfil the  functions of giving support to and carrying about the body. The clavicle  is rudimentary in the cat and the dog; in the cat it is a small,  elongated bone (Fig. 16), 2 centimetres in length, thin and curved,  connected with the sternum and the scapula by ligamentous bundles. In  the dog it is represented by a small osseous plate only (Fig. 17),  which is not connected with any of the neighbouring bones.    It is on the deep surface of a muscle which passes from the head and  neck to the humerus (mastoido-humeral, a muscle common to the arm, neck,  and head) in which this rudimentary bone is found to be developed.    The clavicle exists in perfect state in mammals which use their limbs  for digging, grasping, or flying; the insectivora (hedgehog, mole) and  some rodents (squirrel, woodchuck) are provided with it.    The cheiroptera (bats) possess an extremely well-developed clavicle, on  account of the varied movements which their thoracic limbs execute.

Then he turned homewards in haste, to tell the black fellows that  he had solved the fate of their friends, which had so long been a  mystery. When he was some distance from the Weedah's camp, he heard the  sound of a thunder clap. But it was not thunder it was the bursting of  the back of Weedah's head, which had burst with a bang as of a thunder  clap. And as it burst, out from his remains had risen a bird, Weedah,  the mocking bird; which bird to this day has a hole at the back of his  head, just in the same place as Weedah the black fellow's head had  burst, and whence the bird came forth.    To this day the Weedah makes grass playgrounds, through which he runs,  imitating, as he plays, in quick succession, any voices he has ever  heard, from the crying of a child to the laughing of a woman; from the  mewing of a cat to the barking of a dog, and hence his name Weedah, the  mocking bird.          9.  THE GWINEEBOOS THE REDBREASTS      Gwineeboo and Goomai, the water rat, were down at the creek one day,  getting mussels for food, when, to their astonishment, a kangaroo  hopped right into the water beside them. Well they knew that he must be  escaping from hunters, who were probably pressing him close. So  Gwineeboo quickly seized her yam stick, and knocked the kangaroo on the  head; he was caught fast in the weeds in the creek, so could not  escape. When the two old women had killed the kangaroo they hid its  body under the weeds in the creek, fearing to take it out and cook it  straight away, lest the hunters should come up and claim it. The little  son of Gwineeboo watched them from the bank. After having hidden the  kangaroo, the women picked up their mussels and started for their camp,  when up came the hunters, Quarrian and Gidgereegah, who had tracked the  kangaroo right to the creek.    Seeing the women they said: \"Did you see a kangaroo?\"    The women answered: \"No. We saw no kangaroo.\"    \"That is strange, for we have tracked it right up to here.\"    \"We have seen no kangaroo. See, we have been digging out mussels for  food. Come to our camp, and we will give you some when they are  cooked.\"    The young men, puzzled in their minds, followed the women to their  camp, and when the mussels were cooked the hunters joined the old women  at their dinner. The little boy would not eat the mussels; he kept  crying to his mother, \"Gwineeboo, Gwineeboo. I want kangaroo. I want  kangaroo. Gwineeboo. Gwineeboo.\"    \"There,\" said Quarrian. \"Your little boy has seen the kangaroo, and  wants some; it must be here somewhere.\"    \"Oh, no. He cries for anything he thinks of, some days for kangaroo; he  is only a little boy, and does not know what he wants,\" said old  Gwineeboo. But still the child kept saying, \"Gwineeboo. Gwinceboo. I  want kangaroo. I want kangaroo.\" Goomai was so angry with little  Gwineeboo for keeping on asking for kangaroo, and thereby making the  young men suspicious, that she hit him so hard on the mouth to keep him  quiet, that the blood came, and trickled down his breast, staining it  red. When she saw this, old Gwineeboo grew angry in her turn, and hit  old Goomai, who returned the blow, and so a fight began, more words  than blows, so the noise was great, the women fighting, little  Gwineeboo crying, not quite knowing whether he was crying because  Goomai had hit him, because his mother was fighting, or because he  still wanted kangaroo.    Quarrian said to Gidgereegah. \"They have the kangaroo somewhere hidden;  let us slip away now in the confusion. We will only hide, then come  back in a little while, and surprise them.\"    They went quietly away, and as soon as the two women noticed they had  gone, they ceased fighting, and determined to cook the kangaroo. They  watched the two young men out of sight, and waited some time so as to  be sure that they were safe. Then down they hurried to get the  kangaroo. They dragged it out, and were just making a big fire on which  to cook it, when up came Quarrian and Gidgereegah, saying:    \"Ah! we thought so. You had our kangaroo all the time; little Gwinceboo  was right.\"    \"But we killed it,\" said the women.    \"But we hunted it here,\" said the men, and so saying caught hold of the  kangaroo and dragged it away to some distance, where they made a fire  and cooked it. Goomai, Gwineeboo, and her little boy went over to  Quarrian and Gidgereegah, and begged for some of the meat, but the  young men would give them none, though little Gwineeboo cried piteously  for some. But no; they said they would rather throw what they did not  want to the hawks than give it to the women or child. At last, seeing  that there was no hope of their getting any, the women went away. They  built a big dardurr for themselves, shutting themselves and the little  boy up in it. Then they began singing a song which was to invoke a  storm to destroy their enemies, for so now they considered Quarrian and  Gidgereegah. For some time they chanted:      \"Moogaray, Moogaray, May, May,    Eehu, Eehu, Doongarah.\"    First they would begin very slowly and softly, gradually getting  quicker and louder, until at length they almost shrieked it out. The  words they said meant, \"Come hailstones; come wind; come rain; come  lightning.\"    While they were chanting, little Gwineeboo kept crying, and would not  be comforted. Soon came a few big drops of rain, then a big wind, and  as that lulled, more rain. Then came thunder and lightning, the air  grew bitterly cold, and there came a pitiless hailstorm, hailstones  bigger than a duck's egg fell, cutting the leaves from the trees and  bruising their bark. Gidgereegah and Quarrian came running over to the  dardurr and begged the women to let them in.    \"No,\" shrieked Gwineeboo above the storm, \"there was no kangaroo meat  for us: there is no dardurr shelter for you. Ask shelter of the hawks  whom ye fed.\" The men begged to be let in, said they would hunt again  and get kangaroo for the women, not one but many. \"No,\" again shrieked  the women. \"You would not even listen to the crying of a little child;  it is better such as you should perish.\" And fiercer raged the storm  and louder sang the women:      \"Moogaray, Moogaray, May, May,    Eehu, Eehu, Doongarah.\"    So long and so fierce was the storm that the young men must have  perished had they not been changed into birds. First they were changed  into birds and afterwards into stars in the sky, where they now are,  Gidgereegah and Ouarrian with the kangaroo between them, still bearing  the names that they bore on the earth.          10.  MEAMEI THE SEVEN SISTERS      Wurrunnah had had a long day's hunting, and he came back to the camp  tired and hungry. He asked his old mother for durrie, but she said  there was none left. Then he asked some of the other blacks to give him  some doonburr seeds that he might make durrie for himself, But no one  would give him anything. He flew into a rage and he said, \"I will go to  a far country and live with strangers; my own people would starve me.\"  And while he was yet hot and angry, he went. Gathering up his weapons,  he strode forth to find a new people in a new country. After he had  gone some distance, he saw, a long way off, an old man chopping out  bees' nests. The old man turned his face towards Wurrunnah, and watched  him coming, but when Wurrunnah came close to him he saw that the old  man had no eyes, though he had seemed to be watching him long before he  could have heard him. It frightened Wurrunnah to see a stranger having  no eyes, yet turning his face towards him as if seeing him all the  time. But he determined not to show his fear, but go straight on  towards him, which he did. When he came up to him, the stranger told  him that his name was Mooroonumildah, and that his tribe were so-called  because they had no eyes, but saw through their noses. Wurrunnah  thought it very strange and still felt rather frightened, though  Mooroonumildah seemed hospitable and kind, for, he gave Wurrunnah, whom  he said looked hungry, a bark wirree filled with honey, told him where  his camp was, and gave him leave to go there and stay with him.  Wurrunnah took the honey and turned as if to go to the camp, but when  he got out of sight he thought it wiser to turn in another direction.  He journeyed on for some time, until he came to a large lagoon, where  he decided to camp. He took a long drink of water, and then lay down to  sleep. When he woke in the morning, he looked towards the lagoon, but  saw only a big plain. He thought he must be dreaming; he rubbed his  eyes and looked again.    \"This is a strange country,\" he said. \"First I meet a man who has no  eyes and yet can see. Then at night I see a large lagoon full of water,  I wake in the morning and see none. The water was surely there, for I  drank some, and yet now there is no water.\" As he was wondering how the  water could have disappeared so quickly, he saw a big storm coming up;  he hurried to get into the thick bush for shelter. When he had gone a  little way into the bush, he saw a quantity of cut bark lying on the  ground.    \"Now I am right,\" he said. \"I shall get some poles and with them and  this bark make a dardurr in which to shelter myself from the storm I  see coming.\"    He quickly cut the poles he wanted, stuck them up as a framework for  his dardurr. Then he went to lift up the bark. As he lifted up a sheet  of it he saw a strange-looking object of no tribe that he had ever seen  before.    This strange object cried out: \"I am Bulgahnunnoo,\" in such a  terrifying tone that Wurrunnah dropped the bark, picked up his weapons  and ran away as hard as he could, quite forgetting the storm. His one  idea was to get as far as he"]]]
