Its  place is not essentially different from that which it held  in the systems of Kant and Schiller.  As the objective  possibility for the bridge between sense and reason, as the  vindication of freedom in the phenomenal world, and as  vindication of the possible unity of the real and the ideal,  or nature and self, the world-elements, its philosophical  significance is nearly the same.    With Hegel Beauty loses little of its commanding position.  The universe is in its nature rational; Thought and Being  are one.  The world-process is a logical process; and nature  and history, in which spirit of the world realizes itself,  are but applied logic.  The completely fulfilled or expressed  Truth is then the concrete world-system; at the same time the  life or self of the universe; the Absolute.  This Hegel calls  the Idea, and he defines Beauty as the expression of the Idea  to sense.    This definition would seem to be as to the letter in accord  with the general tendency as have already outlined.  It might  be said that it is but another phrasing of Schelling's thought  of the Absolute as presented to the Ego in Beauty.  But not  so.  For Schelling, the aesthetic is a schema or form,--that  is, the form of balance, equilibrium, reconciliation of the  rational ideal,--not a content.  But Hegel's Beauty expresses  the Idea by the way of information or association.  That this  is true any one of his traditional examples makes evident.  Correggio's Madonna of the St. Sebastian is found by him  inferior to the Sistine Madonna.  Why?  \"In the first picture  we have the dearest and loveliest of human relations consecrated  by contrast with what is Divine.  In the second picture we have  the Divine relation itself, showing itself under the limitations  of the human.\"<1>  Dutch painting, he tells us, ought not to  be despised; \"for it is this fresh and wakeful freedom and  vitality of mind in apprehension and presentation that forms  the highest aspect of these pictures.\"  And a commentator adds,  \"The spontaneous joy of the perfect life is figured to this  lower sphere.\"  His whole treatment of Art as a symbol confirms  this view, as do all his criticisms.  Art or Beauty shall  reveal to our understanding the eternal Ideal.    <1> Kedney's Hegel's _Aesthetics_, 1892, p. 158.    On comparing this with what we have won from Kant, Schiller,  and Schelling, the divergence becomes apparent.  I have tried  to show that there is no essential difference between these  three either in their general view of the aesthetic experience,  or in the degree of objectivity of their doctrine of Beauty.  They do not contradict one another.  They merely emphasize  now the unity, now the reconciliation of opposites, in the  aesthetic experience.  The experience of the beautiful  constitutes a reconciliation of the warring elements of  experience, in a world in which the demands of Reason seem  to conflict with the logic of events, and the beautiful object  is such that it constitutes the permanent possibility for this  reconciliation.    But the attempt to include Hegel within this circle reveals  at once the need of further delimitation.  The beautiful is  to reveal, and to vindicate in revealing, the union of the  world-elements, that is, the spirit of the world.  On Hegel's  own principles, the Idea should be \"expressed to sense.\"  Now  if this expression is not, after all, directly to sense, but  the sense gives merely the occasion for passing over to the  thought of the Divine, it would seem that the Beauty is not  after all in the work of art, but out of it.  The Infinite,  or the Idea, or the fusion of real and ideal, must be shown  to sense.    Is there any way in which this is conceivable?  We cannot  completely express to sense Niagara Falls or the Jungfrau,  for they are infinitely beyond the possibilities of imitation.  Yet the particular contour of the Jungfrau is never mistaken  in the smallest picture. In making a model of Niagara we  should have to reproduce the relation between body of water,  width of stream, and height of fall, and we might succeed in  getting the peculiar effect of voluminousness which marks  that wonder of Nature.  The soaring of a lark is not like  the pointing upward of a slender Gothic spire, yet there is  a likeness in the attitudes with which we follow them.  All  these cases have certain form-qualities in common, by virtue  of which they resemble each other.  Now it is these very  form-qualities which Kant is using when he takes the aesthetic  judgment as representative of reason in the world of sense  because it shows the qualities of the ideas of reason,--that  is, unconditional totality or freedom.  And we might, indeed,  hope to \"express the Idea to sense\" if we could find for it  a form-quality, or subjectively, in the phrase of Kant, a  form of reflection.    What is the form of reflection for the Absolute, the Idea?  It would appear to be a combination of Unity and Totality--  self-completeness.  An object, then, which should be self-  complete from all possible points of view, to which could  be applied the \"form of reflection\" for the Absolute, would,  therefore, alone truly express it, and so alone fulfill the  end of Beauty.  The Idea would be there in its form; it  would be shown to sense, and so first full expressed.    With this important modification of Hegel's definition of  Beauty, which brings it into line with the point of view  already won, I believe the way is at last opened from the  traditional philosophy of aesthetics to a healthy and concrete  psychological theory.    But must every self-complete object give rise to the aesthetic  experience?  An object is absolutely self-complete only for  the perceiving subject; it is so, in other words, only when  it produces a self-complete experience for that subject.  If  reconciliation of the warring elements of the universe is the  end of Beauty it must take place not for, but in, the human  personality; it must not be understood, but immediately,  completely experienced; it should be realized in the subject  of the aesthetic experience, the lover of beauty.  The  beautiful object would be not that which should show in  outline form, or remind of, this Unity of the World, but  which should create for the subject the moment of self-  completeness; which should inform the aesthetic subject with  that unity and self-completeness which are the \"forms of  reflection\" of the Infinite.  The subject should be not a  mirror of perfection, but a state of perfection.  Only in  this sense does the concept of reconciliation come to its  full meaning.  Not because I see freedom, but because I am  free; not because I think of God, or the Infinite, or the  one, but because I am for the moment complete, at the  highest point of energy and unity, does the aesthetic  experience constitute such a reconciliation.    Not because I behold the Infinite, but because I have, myself,  a moment of perfection.  Herein it is that our theory constitutes  a complete contradiction to all \"expression\" or \"significant\"  theories of the Beautiful, and does away with the necessity those  theories are under of reading sermons into stones.  The yellow  primrose needs not to remind us of the harmony of the universe,  or to have ulterior significance whatever, if it gives by its  own direct simple stimulation a moment of Unity and Self-  completeness.  That immediate experience indeed contains in  itself the \"form of reflection\" of the Absolute, and it is  through this that we so often pass, in the enjoyment of Beauty,  to the thought of the divine.  But that thought is a corollary,  a secondary effect, not an essential part of the aesthetic  moment.  There is a wonderful bit of unconscious aesthetics in  the following passage from Senancour, touching the \"secret of  relation\" we have just analyzed.    \"It was dark and rather cold.  I was gloomy, and walked because  I had nothing to do.  I passed by some flowers placed breast-  high upon a wall.  A jonquil in bloom was there.  It is the  strongest expression of desire:  it was the first perfume of  the year.  I felt all the happiness destined for man.  This  unutterable harmony of souls, the phantom of the ideal world,  arose in me complete.  I never felt anything so great or so  instantaneous.  I know not what shape, what analogy, what  secret of relation it was that made me see in this flower a  limitless beauty.... I shall never inclose in a conception this  power, this immensity that nothing will express; this form that  nothing will contain; this ideal of a better world which one  feels, but which it would seem that nature has not made.\"<1>    <1> Translation by Carleton Noyes:  _The Enjoyment of Art_, 1903,  p. 65.    Our philosophical definition of Beauty has thus taken final  shape.  The beautiful object possesses those qualities which  bring the personality into a state of unity and self-completeness.  Lightly to case aside such a definition as abstract, vague,  Empty, is no less short sighted than to treat the idea of the  Absolute Will, of the Transcendental Reason, of the Eternal  Love, as mere intellectual factors in the aesthetic experience.  It should not be criticised as giving \"no objective account of  the nature and origin of Beauty.\"  The nature of Beauty is  indicated in the definition; the origin of Beauty may be studied  in its historical development; its reason for being is simply  the desire of the human heart for the perfect moment.    Beauty is to bring unity and self-completeness into the  personality.  By what means?  What causes can bring about this  effect?  When we enter the realm of causes and effects, however,  we have already left the ground of philosophy, and it is fitting  that the concepts which we have to use should be adapted to the  empirical point of view.  The personality, as dealt with in  psychology, is but the psychophysical organism; and we need to  know"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37512"],[0,"A Revision of Snakes of the Genus Conophis (Family Colubridae, from Middle (#7)"],[1,"    _Specimens examined._--Total of 48, as follows: BRITISH HONDURAS:  _Belize District_: 13.0 mi.

Type locality:  Rio Poas de Aserri (a few miles south of San Jose), Costa Rica.    _Diagnosis._--Head and body dark brown or black above with two or four  white stripes along body; usually two white lines on head immediately  above eye passing from canthus rosetralis posteriorly to connect with  white stripe on 6th row of dorsal scales; eight supralabials with  black margins above.    _Variation._--Six specimens have 173 to 183 (176.5 +- 4.00) ventrals.  Five of these snakes having complete tails have 71 to 89 (80.6 +- 7.15)  subcaudals; the number of ventrals plus subcaudals varies from 250 to  263 (257.0). In the six specimens the reduction from 19 to 17 dorsal  scales takes place between ventrals 84 and 97 (93.2 +- 4.71). Sexual  dimorphism is evident in the number of subcaudals; two females have 71  and 76 (73.5), and three males have 82 to 89 (85.3) subcaudals. The  longest specimen (ANSP 22424) is a female from San Jose, Costa Rica,  having a body length of 660 mm., a tail length of 168 mm. and a total  length of 828 mm.    The dorsal coloration (fig. 1, E) varies from a black ground-color  with two or four narrow white stripes to a dark brown ground-color  with a series of black stripes and four white stripes. In the black  specimens there are no dark stripes. The darkest specimen (NMW  16838:1) has only two white stripes; these more or less continuous  stripes are on the ventral third of the 2nd row of scales and  occasionally on the dorsalmost part of the first scale-row. The venter  is immaculate white except for black on the tips of the ventral  scales. The dorsum above the 2nd scale-row is uniform black. There are  no white stripes on the head.    The palest specimen (NMW 16838:2) has four dorsal white stripes; the  lateral pair of these stripes is on the ventral half of the 2nd and  the dorsal third of the 1st scale-rows; the dorsolateral pair is on  the dorsal two-thirds of the 6th and the ventral third of the 7th rows  of scales. This latter stripe is the posterior continuation of the  white stripe on the head, which originates immediately posterior to  the rostral scale and passes posteriorly along the canthus rostralis  and along the lateral margin of the supraocular scale to the nape.  Posterior to the place of scale reduction, the dorsolateral white  stripe is displaced ventrally one scale-row. Except for black flecks  or spots on the lateral margins of the ventrals, the venter is  immaculate white. The dorsum above the lateral white stripes is brown  and black; there is a pair of dorsolateral white stripes. The dorsal  half of the 2nd, most of the 3rd, 4th and 5th rows of scales are  black; the dorsal margin of the 3rd, both margins of the 4th, and the  ventral margin of the 5th rows are paler brown. The dorsal two-thirds  of the 7th, all but the dorsal most part of the 8th, and the middle  two-thirds of the 10th scale-rows are black; the areas between are a  medium brown.    Only six specimens are available on which to base a description of the  variation in this species. Furthermore, there are no juveniles, notes  on the colors of living individuals, or photographs of this species.       [Illustration: FIG. 4. Selected locality records for _Conophis        pulcher_ and _Conophis nevermanni_.]    _Remarks._--Taylor (1955:563-565) hesitantly referred a specimen (KU  35630) from 32 kilometers north of Barranca, Puntarenas Province,  Costa Rica, to _Conophis lineatus nevermanni_. This specimen, a  female, has 169 ventrals and ventral scale-reduction taking place  opposite the 109th ventral; both of these characters are well out of  the range of _C. nevermanni_. Furthermore, the ventral margins of the  supralabials are brown, and the pale dorsal stripes are tan and too  wide for _C. nevermanni_ (compare figs. 1, C and E). The specimen  definitely is _C. lineatus dunni_, and corresponds well with another  specimen from Costa Rica (ANSP 12232).    The dark brown or black dorsum with two or four white stripes and the  presence of eight supralabials having dark brown dorsal margins, in  combination with the characters of the genus, serve to distinguish  _Conophis nevermanni_ from other Central American snakes.    _Distribution._--Pacific coastal plain of northwestern Costa Rica and  the Meseta Central of central Costa Rica (fig. 4).    _Specimens examined._--Total of six, as follows: COSTA RICA:  _Guanacaste_: Bebedero, Rio Tenorio, NMW 16838(5). \"_San Jose_,\" ANSP  22424.      =Conophis pulcher= Cope      _Tomodon lineatus_ (in part), Salvin, Proc.

There is much doubt about localities for many  of Hague's specimens collected in the 1860's (Stuart, 1948:10). Since  _Conophis pulcher_ is found predominantly in semi-arid environments,  the types might have come from the semi-arid Cahabon, Negro, or Salama  river basins--all places near the sugar plantation that Hague managed  at San Jeronimo, Baja Verapaz. Possibly the types were obtained from  as far away as the Motagua Valley or the southeastern highlands of  Guatemala, both of which areas Hague is known to have visited.    _Diagnosis._--Paravertebral stripes present at least posteriorly (fig.  1, F); eight or ten stripes at mid-body; lateral dark stripe passing  through eye anteriorly and including at least upper one-half of second  scale-row from neck region posteriorly to place of scale reduction  near mid-body; eight supralabials immaculate or having dark ventral  margins.    _Variation._--Twenty-six specimens have 161 to 182 (169.5 +- 5.31)  ventrals. Eighteen of these snakes with complete tails have 65 to 79  (70.6 +- 3.93) subcaudals; the number of ventrals plus subcaudals  varies from 231 to 251 (239.3). In 26 specimens the reduction from 19  to 17 dorsal scales takes place between ventrals 94 and 119 (104.6 +-  4.90). Sexual dimorphism is evident in the number of subcaudals;  eleven females have 65 to 71 (68.2), and seven males have 70 to 79  (74.3) subcaudals. The longest specimen (AMNH 58364) is a female from  El"]]]
