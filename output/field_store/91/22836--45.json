The decay of the city of Venice is, in many respects, like that  of an outwearied and aged human frame; the cause of its decrepitude is  indeed at the heart, but the outward appearances of it are first at the  extremities. In the centre of the city there are still places where some  evidence of vitality remains, and where, with kind closing of the eyes  to signs, too manifest even there, of distress and declining fortune,  the stranger may succeed in imagining, for a little while, what must  have been the aspect of Venice in her prime. But this lingering  pulsation has not force enough any more to penetrate into the suburbs  and outskirts of the city; the frost of death has there seized upon it  irrevocably, and the grasp of mortal disease is marked daily by the  increasing breadth of its belt of ruin. Nowhere is this seen more  grievously than along the great north-eastern boundary, once occupied by  the smaller palaces of the Venetians, built for pleasure or repose; the  nobler piles along the grand canal being reserved for the pomp and  business of daily life. To such smaller palaces some garden ground was  commonly attached, opening to the water-side; and, in front of these  villas and gardens, the lagoon was wont to be covered in the evening by  gondolas: the space of it between this part of the city and the island  group of Murano being to Venice, in her time of power, what its parks  are to London; only gondolas were used instead of carriages, and the  crowd of the population did not come out till towards sunset, and  prolonged their pleasures far into the night, company answering to  company with alternate singing.    Sec. II. If, knowing this custom of the Venetians, and with a vision in  his mind of summer palaces lining the shore, and myrtle gardens sloping  to the sea, the traveller now seeks this suburb of Venice, he will be  strangely and sadly surprised to find a new but perfectly desolate quay,  about a mile in length, extending from the arsenal to the Sacca della  Misericordia, in front of a line of miserable houses built in the course  of the last sixty or eighty years, yet already tottering to their ruin;  and not less to find that the principal object in the view which these  houses (built partly in front and partly on the ruins of the ancient  palaces) now command is a dead brick wall, about a quarter of a mile  across the water, interrupted only by a kind of white lodge, the  cheerfulness of which prospect is not enhanced by his finding that this  wall encloses the principal public cemetery of Venice. He may, perhaps,  marvel for a few moments at the singular taste of the old Venetians in  taking their pleasure under a churchyard wall: but, on further inquiry,  he will find that the building on the island, like those on the shore,  is recent, that it stands on the ruins of the Church of St. Cristoforo  della Pace; and that with a singular, because unintended, moral, the  modern Venetians have replaced the Peace of the Christ-bearer by the  Peace of Death, and where they once went, as the sun set daily, to their  pleasure, now go, as the sun sets to each of them for ever, to their  graves.    Sec. III. Yet the power of Nature cannot be shortened by the folly, nor  her beauty altogether saddened by the misery, of man. The broad tides  still ebb and flow brightly about the island of the dead, and the linked  conclave of the Alps know no decline from their old pre-eminence, nor  stoop from their golden thrones in the circle of the horizon. So lovely  is the scene still, in spite of all its injuries, that we shall find  ourselves drawn there again and again at evening out of the narrow  canals and streets of the city, to watch the wreaths of the sea-mists  weaving themselves like mourning veils around the mountains far away,  and listen to the green waves as they fret and sigh along the cemetery  shore.    Sec. IV. But it is morning now: we have a hard day's work to do at Murano,  and our boat shoots swiftly from beneath the last bridge of Venice, and  brings us out into the open sea and sky.    The pure cumuli of cloud lie crowded and leaning against one another,  rank beyond rank, far over the shining water, each cut away at its  foundation by a level line, trenchant and clear, till they sink to the  horizon like a flight of marble steps, except where the mountains meet  them, and are lost in them, barred across by the grey terraces of those  cloud foundations, and reduced into one crestless bank of blue, spotted  here and there with strange flakes of wan, aerial, greenish light,  strewed upon them like snow. And underneath is the long dark line of the  mainland, fringed with low trees; and then the wide-waving surface of  the burnished lagoon trembling slowly, and shaking out into forked bands  of lengthening light the images of the towers of cloud above. To the  north, there is first the great cemetery wall, then the long stray  buildings of Murano, and the island villages beyond, glittering in  intense crystalline vermilion, like so much jewellery scattered on a  mirror, their towers poised apparently in the air a little above the  horizon, and their reflections, as sharp and vivid and substantial as  themselves, thrown on the vacancy between them and the sea. And thus the  villages seem standing on the air; and, to the east, there is a cluster  of ships that seem sailing on the land; for the sandy line of the Lido  stretches itself between us and them, and we can see the tall white  sails moving beyond it, but not the sea, only there is a sense of the  great sea being indeed there, and a solemn strength of gleaming light in  sky above.    Sec. V. The most discordant feature in the whole scene is the cloud which  hovers above the glass furnaces of Murano; but this we may not regret,  as it is one of the last signs left of human exertion among the ruinous  villages which surround us. The silent gliding of the gondola brings it  nearer to us every moment; we pass the cemetery, and a deep sea-channel  which separates it from Murano, and finally enter a narrow water-street,  with a paved footpath on each side, raised three or four feet above the  canal, and forming a kind of quay between the water and the doors of the  houses. These latter are, for the most part, low, but built with massy  doors and windows of marble or Istrian stone, square-set and barred with  iron; buildings evidently once of no mean order, though now inhabited  only by the poor. Here and there an ogee window of the fourteenth  century, or a doorway deeply enriched with cable mouldings, shows itself  in the midst of more ordinary features; and several houses, consisting  of one story only carried on square pillars, forming a short arcade  along the quay, have windows sustained on shafts of red Verona marble,  of singular grace and delicacy. All now in vain: little care is there  for their delicacy or grace among the rough fishermen sauntering on the  quay with their jackets hanging loose from their shoulders, jacket and  cap and hair all of the same dark-greenish sea-grey. But there is some  life in the scene, more than is usual in Venice: the women are sitting  at their doors knitting busily, and various workmen of the glass-houses  sifting glass dust upon the pavement, and strange cries coming from one  side of the canal to the other, and ringing far along the crowded water,  from venders of figs and grapes, and gourds and shell-fish; cries partly  descriptive of the eatables in question, but interspersed with others of  a character unintelligible in proportion to their violence, and  fortunately so if we may judge by a sentence which is stencilled in  black, within a garland, on the whitewashed walls of nearly every other  house in the street, but which, how often soever written, no one seems  to regard: \"Bestemme non piu. Lodate Gesu.\"    Sec. VI. We push our way on between large barges laden with fresh water  from Fusina, in round white tubs seven feet across, and complicated  boats full of all manner of nets that look as if they could never be  disentangled, hanging from their masts and over their sides; and  presently pass under a bridge with the lion of St. Mark on its  archivolt, and another on a pillar at the end of the parapet, a small  red lion with much of the puppy in his face, looking vacantly up into  the air (in passing we may note that, instead of feathers, his wings are  covered with hair, and in several other points the manner of his  sculpture is not uninteresting)."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30756"],[0,"The Stones of Venice, Volume 3 (of 3) (#7)"],[1,"pointing  it out as intended for the service of man. Not altogether a common rock,  it is yet rare enough to command a certain degree of interest and  attention wherever it is found; but not so rare as to preclude its use  for any purpose to which it is fitted. It is exactly of the consistence  which is best adapted for sculpture: that is to say, neither hard nor  brittle, nor flaky nor splintery, but uniform, and delicately, yet not  ignobly, soft,--exactly soft enough to allow the sculptor to work it  without force, and trace on it the finest lines of finished form; and  yet so hard as never to betray the touch or moulder away beneath the  steel; and so admirably crystallized, and of such permanent elements,  that no rains dissolve it, no time changes it, no atmosphere decomposes  it: once shaped, it is shaped for ever, unless subjected to actual  violence or attrition. This rock, then, is prepared by Nature for the  sculptor and architect, just as paper is prepared by the manufacturer  for the artist, with as great--nay, with greater--care, and more perfect  adaptation of the material to the requirements. And of this marble  paper, some is white and some colored; but more is colored than white,  because the white is evidently meant for sculpture, and the colored for  the covering of large surfaces.    Sec. XLII. Now, if we would take Nature at her word, and use this precious  paper which she has taken so much care to provide for us (it is a long  process, the making of that paper; the pulp of it needing the subtlest  possible solution, and the pressing of it--for it is all  hot-pressed--having to be done under the saw, or under something at  least as heavy); if, I say, we use it as Nature would have us, consider  what advantages would follow. The colors of marble are mingled for us  just as if on a prepared palette. They are of all shades and hues  (except bad ones), some being united and even, some broken, mixed, and  interrupted, in order to supply, as far as possible, the want of the  painter's power of breaking and mingling the color with the brush. But  there is more in the colors than this delicacy of adaptation. There is  history in them. By the manner in which they are arranged in every piece  of marble, they record the means by which that marble has been produced,  and the successive changes through which it has passed. And in all their  veins and zones, and flame-like stainings, or broken and disconnected  lines, they write various legends, never untrue, of the former political  state of the mountain kingdom to which they belonged, of its infirmities  and fortitudes, convulsions and consolidations, from the beginning of  time.    Now, if we were never in the habit of seeing anything but real marbles,  this language of theirs would soon begin to be understood; that is to  say, even the least observant of us would recognize such and such stones  as forming a peculiar class, and would begin to inquire where they came  from, and, at last, take some feeble interest in the main question, Why  they were only to be found in that or the other place, and how they  came to make a part of this mountain, and not of that? And in a little  while, it would not be possible to stand for a moment at a shop door,  leaning against the pillars of it, without remembering or questioning of  something well worth the memory or the inquiry, touching the hills of  Italy, or Greece, or Africa, or Spain; and we should be led on from  knowledge to knowledge, until even the unsculptured walls of our streets  became to us volumes as precious as those of our libraries.    Sec. XLIII. But the moment we admit imitation of marble, this source of  knowledge is destroyed. None of us can be at the pains to go through the  work of verification. If we knew that every colored stone we saw was  natural, certain questions, conclusions, interests, would force  themselves upon us without any effort of our own; but we have none of us  time to stop in the midst of our daily business, to touch and pore over,  and decide with painful minuteness of investigation, whether such and  such a pillar be stucco or stone. And the whole field of this knowledge,  which Nature intended us to possess when we were children, is hopelessly  shut out from us. Worse than shut out, for the mass of coarse imitations  confuses our knowledge acquired from other sources; and our memory of  the marbles we have perhaps once or twice carefully examined, is  disturbed and distorted by the inaccuracy of the imitations which are  brought before us continually.    Sec. XLIV. But it will be said, that it is too expensive to employ real  marbles in ordinary cases. It may be so: yet not always more expensive  than the fitting windows with enormous plate glass, and decorating them  with elaborate stucco mouldings and other useless sources of expenditure  in modern building; nay, not always in the end more expensive than the  frequent repainting of the dingy pillars, which a little water dashed  against them would refresh from day to day, if they were of true stone.  But, granting that it be so, in that very costliness, checking their  common use in certain localities, is part of the interest of marbles,  considered as history. Where they are not found, Nature has supplied  other materials,--clay for brick, or forest for timber,--in the working  of which she intends other characters of the human mind to be developed,  and by the proper use of which certain local advantages will assuredly  be attained, while the delightfulness and meaning of the precious  marbles will be felt more forcibly in the districts where they occur, or  on the occasions when they may be procured.    Sec. XLV. It can hardly be necessary to add, that, as the imitation of  marbles interferes with and checks the knowledge of geography and  geology, so the imitation of wood interferes with that of botany; and  that our acquaintance with the nature, uses, and manner of growth of the  timber trees of our own and of foreign countries, would probably, in the  majority of cases, become accurate and extensive, without any labor or  sacrifice of time, were not all inquiry checked, and all observation  betrayed, by the wretched labors of the \"Grainer.\"    Sec. XLVI. But this is not all. As the practice of imitation retards  knowledge, so also it retards art.    There is not a meaner occupation for the human mind than the imitation  of the stains and striae of marble and wood. When engaged in any easy and  simple mechanical occupation, there is still some liberty for the mind  to leave the literal work; and the clash of the loom or the activity of  the fingers will not always prevent the thoughts from some happy  expatiation in their own domains. But the grainer must think of what he  is doing; and veritable attention and care, and occasionally  considerable skill, are consumed in the doing of a more absolute nothing  than I can name in any other department of painful idleness. I know not  anything so humiliating as to see a human being, with arms and limbs  complete, and apparently a head, and assuredly a soul, yet into the  hands of which when you have put a brush and pallet, it cannot do  anything with them but imitate a piece of wood. It cannot color, it has  no ideas of color; it cannot draw, it has no ideas of form; it cannot  caricature, it has no ideas of humor. It is incapable of anything beyond  knots. All its achievement, the entire result of the daily application  of its imagination and immortality, is to be such a piece of texture as  the sun and dew are sucking up out of the muddy ground, and weaving  together, far more finely, in millions of millions of growing branches,  over every rood of waste woodland and shady hill.    Sec. XLVII. But what is to be done, the reader asks, with men who are  capable of nothing else than this? Nay, they may be capable of  everything else, for all we know, and what we are to do with them I will  try to say in the next chapter; but meanwhile one word more touching the  higher principles of action in this matter, from which we have descended  to those of expediency. I trust that some day the language of Types will  be more read and understood by us than it has been for centuries; and  when this language, a better one than either Greek or Latin, is again  recognized amongst us, we shall find, or remember, that as the other  visible elements of the universe--its air, its water, and its flame--set  forth, in their pure energies, the life-giving, purifying, and  sanctifying influences of the Deity upon His creatures, so the earth, in  its purity, sets forth His eternity and His TRUTH. I have dwelt above on  the historical language of stones; let us not forget this, which is  their theological language; and, as we would not wantonly pollute the  fresh waters when they issue forth in their clear glory from the rock,  nor stay the mountain winds into pestilential stagnancy, nor mock the  sunbeams with artificial and ineffective light; so let us not by our own  base and barren falsehoods, replace the crystalline strength and burning  color of the earth from which we were born, and to which we must return;  the earth which, like our own bodies, though dust in its degradation, is  full of splendor when God's hand gathers its atoms; and which was for  ever sanctified by Him, as the symbol no less of His love than of His  truth, when He bade the high priest bear the names of the Children of  Israel on the clear stones of the Breastplate of Judgment.      FOOTNOTES:      [1] There is a curious instance of this in the modern imitations of      the Gothic capitals of the Casa d' Oro, employed in its      restorations.
