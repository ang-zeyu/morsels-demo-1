Then the soldiers came to bed their horses, and Josh went back to the  stove. His big driving coat hung with the little sawed-off rifle in the  long pocket. He waited till the soldiers one by one went up the ladder  to the general bunk-room. He rose again, got the lantern, lighted it,  carried it out behind the lonely stable. The horses were grinding their  hay, the stars were faintly lighting the snow. There was no one about as  he hung the lantern under the eaves outside so that it could be seen  from the open valley, but not from the house.    [Illustration]    A faint _Yap-yah_, of a Fox was heard on the piney hillside, as he lay  down on the hay in the loft, but there were no signs of life on the  snow. He had come to wait all night if need be, and waited. The lantern  might allure, it might scare, but it was needed in this gloom, and it  tinged the snow with faint yellow light below him. An hour went by, then  a big-tailed form came near and made a little bark at the lantern. It  looked very dark, but it had a paler patch on the throat. This waiting  was freezing work; Josh's teeth were chattering in spite of his  overcoat. Another gray form came, then a much larger black one shaped  itself on the white. It dashed at the first, which fled, and the second  one followed but a little, and then sat down on the snow, gazing at that  bright light. When you are sure, you are _so_ sure--Josh knew him now,  he was facing the Silver Fox. But the light was dim. Josh's hand  trembled as he bared it to lay the back on his lips and suck so as to  make a mousey squeak. The effect on the Fox was instant. He glided  forward intent as a hunting cat. Again he stood in, oh! such a wonderful  pose, still as a statue, frozen like a hiding partridge, unbudging as a  lone kid Antelope in May. And Josh raised--yes, he had come for that--he  raised that fatal gun. The lantern blazed in the Fox's face at twenty  yards; the light was flung back doubled by its shining eyes; it looked  perfectly clear. Josh lined the gun, but, strange to tell, the sights so  plain were lost at once, and the gun was shaking like a sorghum stalk  while the Gopher gnaws its root.    [Illustration]    He laid the weapon down with a groan, cursed his own poor trembling  hand, and in an instant the wonder Fox was gone.    Poor Josh! He wasn't bad-tongued, but now he used all the evil words he  had ever heard, and he was Western bred. Then he reacted on himself.  \"The Fox might come back!\" Suddenly he remembered something. He got out  a common sulphur match. He wet it on his lips and rubbed it on the  muzzle sight: Then on each side of the notch on the breech sight. He  lined it for a tree. Yes! surely! What had been a blur of blackness had  now a visible form.    A faint bark on a far hillside might mean a coming or a going Fox. Josh  waited five minutes, then again he squeaked on his bare hand. The effect  was a surprise when from the shelter of the stable wall ten feet below  there leaped the great dark Fox. At fifteen feet it paused. Those yellow  orbs were fiery in the light and the rifle sights with the specks of  fire were lined. There was a sharp report and the black-robed fur was  still and limp in the snow.    Who can tell the crack of a small rifle among the louder cracks of green  logs splitting with the fierce frost of a Yellowstone winter's night?  Why should travel-worn, storm-worn travellers wake at each slight,  usual sound? Who knows? Who cares?           *       *       *       *       *    And afar in Livingston what did the fur dealer care? It was a great  prize--or the banker? he got his five hundred, and mother found it easy  to accept the Indians' creed: \"Who owns wild beasts? The man who kills  them.\"    \"I did not know how it would come,\" she said; \"I only knew it would  come, for I prayed and believed.\"    We know that it came when it meant the most. The house was saved. It was  the turn in their fortune's tide, and the crucial moment of the change  was when those three bright sulphur spots were lined with the living  lamps in the head of the Silver Fox. Yes! Josh was a poacher. Just once.    [Illustration]      THE VILLAIN IN VELVET--THE MARTEN    This beautiful animal, the Sable of America, with its rich brown fur and  its golden throat, comes naturally after the Silver Fox, for such is the  relative value of their respective coats.    The Fox is a small wild dog; the Marten is a large tree Weasel. It is a  creature of amazing agility, so much so that it commonly runs down the  Red-squirrel among the tree tops.    Its food consists mainly of mice and Squirrels, but it kills Rabbits and  Grouse when it can find them, and sometimes even feasts on game of a far  more noble size.    Tom Newcomb, my old guide, has given me an interesting note on the  Marten, made while he was acting as hunting guide in the Shoshoni  Mountains.    In October, 1911, he was out with Baron D' Epsen and his party, hunting  on Miller Creek east of Yellowstone Park. They shot at a Deer. It ran  off as though unharmed, but turned to run down hill, and soon the snow  showed that it was spurting blood on both sides. They followed for three  or four hundred yards, and then the Deer track was joined by the tracks  of five Marten. In a few minutes they found the Deer down and the five  Marten, a family probably, darting about in the near trees, making their  peculiar soft purr as though in anticipation of the feast, which was  delayed only by the coming of the hunters. These attempts to share with  the killers of big game are often seen.    [Illustration]      THE INDUSTRIOUS BEAVER    In some respects the Beaver is the most notable animal in the West. It  was the search for Beaver skins that led adventurers to explore the  Rocky Mountains, and to open up the whole northwest of the United  States and Canada. It is the Beaver to-day that is the chief incentive  to poachers in the Park, but above all the Beaver is the animal that  most manifests its intelligence by its works, forestalls man in much of  his best construction, and amazes us by the well-considered labour of  its hands.    [Illustration: VII. Beaver: (a) Pond and house; (b) Stumps of tree cut  and removed by Beaver, near Yancey's, 1897  _Photos by E. T. Seton_]    [Illustration: VIII. Mule-deer  _Photo by E. T. Seton_]    [Illustration]    There was a time when the Beaver's works and wisdom were so new and  astounding that super-human intelligence was ascribed to this fur-clad  engineer. Then the scoffers came and reduced him to the low level of his  near kin, and explained the accounts of his works as mere fairy tales.  Now we have got back to the middle of the road. We find him a creature  of intelligence far above that of his near kinsmen, and endowed with  some extraordinary instincts that guide him in making dams, houses,  etc., that are unparalleled in the animal world. Here are the principal  deliberate constructions of the Beaver: First the lodge. The Beaver was  the original inventor of reinforced concrete. He has used it for a  million years, in the form of mud mixed with sticks and stones, for  building his lodge and dam. The lodge is the home of the family; that  is, it shelters usually one old male, one old female and sundry  offspring. It is commonly fifteen to twenty feet across outside, and  three to five feet high. Within is a chamber about two feet high and six  feet across, well above water and provided with a ventilator through the  roof, also two entering passages under water, one winding for ordinary  traffic, and one straight for carrying in wood, whose bark is a staple  food. This house is kept perfectly tidy, and when the branch is stripped  of all eatable parts, it is taken out and worked into the dam, which is  a crooked bank of mud and sticks across the running stream. It holds the  water so as to moat the Beaver Castle.    [Illustration]    But the canal is one of this animal's most interesting undertakings. It  is strictly a freight canal for bringing in food-logs, and is dug out  across level ground toward the standing timber.    Canals are commonly three or four hundred feet long, about three feet  wide and two feet deep. There was a small but good example at Yancey's  in 1897; it was only seventy feet long. The longest I ever saw was in  the Adirondacks, N. Y.; it was six hundred and fifty-four feet in length  following the curves, two or three feet wide and about two feet deep.    Three other Beaver structures should be noticed. One, the dock or plunge  hole, which is a deep place by a sharply raised bank, both made with  careful manual labour. Next, the sunning place, generally an ant-hill  on which the Beaver lies to enjoy a sun-bath, while the ants pick the  creepers out of his fur. Third, the mud-pie. This is a little patty of  mud mixed with a squeeze of the castor or body-scent glands. It answers  the purpose of a register, letting all who call know that so and so has  recently been here.    The chief food of the Beaver, at least its favourite food, is aspen,  also called quaking asp or poplar; where there are no poplars there are  no Beavers.      THE DAM    Usually the Beavers start a dam on some stream, right opposite a good  grove of poplars. When these are all cut down and the bark used for  food, the Beaver makes a second dam on the same stream, always with a  view to having deep water for safety, close by poplars for food. In this  way I found the Beavers at Yancey's in 1897 had constructed thirteen  dams in succession. But when I examined the ground again in 1912, the  dams were broken, the ponds all dry. Why? The answer is very simple. The  Beavers had used up all the food. Instead of the little aspen groves  there were now nothing but stumps, and the Beavers had moved elsewhere.

In Germany, a mixture of German and Hebrew had come into use among the  Jews as the medium of daily intercourse. In this peculiar patois, called  _Judendeutsch_, a large literature had developed. Before Luther's time,  it possessed two fine translations of the Bible, besides numerous  writings of an ethical, poetical, and historical character, among which  particular mention should be made of those on the German legend-cycles  of the middle ages. At the same time, the Talmud receives its due of  time, effort, and talent. New life comes only with the era of  emancipation and enlightenment.    Only a few names shall be mentioned, the rest would be bound soon to  escape the memory of the casual reader: there is an historian, David  Gans; a bibliographer, Sabbatai Bassista, and the Talmudists Abigedor  Kara, Jacob Joshua, Jacob Emden, Jonathan Eibeschuetz, and Ezekiel  Landau. It is delight to be able once again to chronicle the interest  taken in long neglected Jewish literature by such Christian scholars as  the two Buxtorfs, Bartolocci, Wolff, Surrenhuys, and De Rossi.  Unfortunately, the interest dies out with them, and it is significant  that to this day most eminent theologians, decidedly to their own  disadvantage, \"content themselves with unreliable secondary sources,\"  instead of drinking from the fountain itself.    We have arrived at the sixth and last period, our own, not yet  completed, whose fruits will be judged by a future generation. It is the  period of the rejuvenescence of Jewish literature. Changes in character,  tenor, form, and language take place. Germany for the first time is in  the van, and Mendelssohn, its most attractive figure, stands at the  beginning of the period, surrounded by his disciples Wessely, Homberg,  Euchel, Friedlaender, and others, in conjunction with whom he gives Jews  a new, pure German Bible translation. Poetry and philology are zealously  pursued, and soon Jewish science, through its votaries Leopold Zunz and  S. J. Rappaport, celebrates a brilliant renascence, such as the poet  describes: \"In the distant East the dawn is breaking,--The olden times  are growing young again.\"    _Die Gottesdienstlichen Vortraege der Juden_, by Zunz, published in 1832,  was the pioneer work of the new Jewish science, whose present  development, despite its wide range, has not yet exhausted the  suggestions made, by the author. Other equally important works from the  same pen followed, and then came the researches of Rappaport, Z.  Frankel, I. M. Jost, M. Sachs, S. D. Luzzatto, S. Munk, A. Geiger, L.  Herzfeld, H. Graetz, J. Fuerst, L. Dukes, M. Steinschneider, D. Cassel,  S. Holdheim, and a host of minor investigators and teachers. Their  loving devotion roused Jewish science and literature from their secular  sleep to vigorous, intellectual life, reacting beneficently on the  spiritual development of Judaism itself. The moulders of the new  literature are such men as the celebrated preachers Adolf Jellinek,  Salomon, Kley, Mannheimer; the able thinkers Steinheim, Hirsch,  Krochmal; the illustrious scholars M. Lazarus, H. Steinthal; and the  versatile journalists G. Riesser and L. Philipson.    Poetry has not been neglected in the general revival. The first Jewish  poet to write in German was M. E. Kuh, whose tragic fate has been  pathetically told by Berthold Auerbach in his _Dichter und Kaufmann_.  The burden of this modern Jewish poetry is, of course, the glorification  of the loyalty and fortitude that preserved the race during a calamitous  past. Such poets as Steinheim, Wihl, L. A. Frankl, M. Beer, K. Beck, Th.  Creizenach, M. Hartmann, S. H. Mosenthal, Henriette Ottenheimer, Moritz  Rappaport, and L. Stein, sing the songs of Zion in the tongue of the  German. And can Heine be forgotten, he who in his _Romanzero_ has so  melodiously, yet so touchingly given word to the hoary sorrow of the  Jew?    In an essay of this scope no more can be done than give the barest  outline of the modern movement. A detailed description of the work of  German-Jewish lyrists belongs to the history of German literature, and,  in fact, on its pages can be found a due appreciation of their worth by  unprejudiced critics, who give particularly high praise to the new  species of tales, the Jewish village, or Ghetto, tales, with which  Jewish and German literatures have latterly been enriched. Their object  is to depict the religious customs in vogue among Jews of past  generations, their home-life, and the conflicts that arose when the old  Judaism came into contact with modern views of life. The master in the  art of telling these Ghetto tales is Leopold Kompert. Of his  disciples--for all coming after him may be considered such--A. Bernstein  described the Jews of Posen; K. E. Franzos and L. Herzberg-Fraenkel,  those of Poland; E. Kulke, the Moravian Jews; M. Goldschmied, the Dutch;  S. H. Mosenthal, the Hessian, and M. Lehmann, the South German. To  Berthold Auerbach's pioneer work this whole class of literature owes its  existence; and Heinrich Heine's fragment, _Rabbi von Bacharach_, a model  of its kind, puts him into this category of writers, too.    And so Judaism and Jewish literature are stepping into a new arena, on  which potent forces that may radically affect both are struggling with  each other. Is Jewish poetry on the point of dying out, or is it  destined to enjoy a resurrection? Who would be rash enough to prophesy  aught of a race whose entire past is a riddle, whose literature is a  question-mark? Of a race which for more than a thousand years has, like  its progenitor, been wrestling victoriously with gods and men?    To recapitulate: We have followed out the course of a literary  development, beginning in grey antiquity with biblical narratives,  assimilating Persian doctrines, Greek wisdom, and Roman law; later,  Arabic poetry and philosophy, and, finally, the whole of European  science in all its ramifications. The literature we have described has  contributed its share to every spiritual result achieved by humanity,  and is a still unexplored treasury of poetry and philosophy, of  experience and knowledge.    \"All the rivers run into the sea; yet the sea is never full,\" saith the  Preacher; so all spiritual currents flow together into the vast ocean of  a world-literature, never full, never complete, rejoicing in every  accession, reaching the climax of its might and majesty on that day  when, according to the prophet, \"the earth shall be full of the  knowledge of the Lord, as the waters cover the sea.\"          THE TALMUD      In the whole range of the world's literatures there are few books with  so checkered a career, so curious a fate, as the Talmud has had. The  name is simple enough, it glides glibly from the tongue, yet how  difficult to explain its import to the uninitiated! From the Dominican  Henricus Seynensis, who took \"Talmud\" to be the name of a rabbi--he  introduces a quotation with _Ut narrat rabbinus Talmud_, \"As Rabbi  Talmud relates\"--down to the church historians and university professors  of our day, the oddest misconceptions on the nature of the Talmud have  prevailed even among learned men. It is not astonishing, then, that the  general reader has no notion of what it is.    Only within recent years the Talmud has been made the subject of  scientific study, and now it is consulted by philologists, cited by  jurists, drawn upon by historians, the general public is beginning to be  interested in it, and of late the old Talmud has repeatedly been  summoned to appear in courts of law to give evidence. Under these  circumstances it is natural to ask, What is the Talmud? Futile to seek  an answer by comparing this gigantic monument of the human intellect  with any other book; it is _sui generis_. In the form in which it issued  from the Jewish academies of Babylonia and Palestine, it is a great  national work, a scientific document of first importance, the archives  of ten centuries, in which are preserved the thoughts and opinions, the  views and verdicts, the errors, transgressions, hopes, disappointments,  customs, ideals, convictions, and sorrows of Israel--a work produced by  the zeal and patience of thirty generations, laboring with a self-denial  unparalleled in the history of literature. A work of this character  assuredly deserves to be known. Unfortunately, the path to its  understanding is blocked by peculiar linguistic and historical  difficulties. Above all, explanations by comparison must be avoided. It  has been likened to a legal code, to a journal, to the transactions of  learned bodies; but these comparisons are both inadequate and  misleading. To make it approximately clear a lengthy explanation must be  entered upon, for, in truth, the Talmud, like the Bible, is a world in  miniature, embracing every possible phase of life.    The origin of the Talmud was simultaneous with Israel's return from the  Babylonian exile, during which a wonderful change had taken place in the  captive people. An idolatrous, rebellious nation had turned into a pious  congregation of the Lord, possessed with zeal for the study of the Law.  By degrees there grew up out of this study a science of wide scope,  whose beginnings are hidden in the last book of the Bible, in the word  _Midrash_, translated by \"story\" in the Authorized Version. Its true  meaning is indicated by that of its root, _darash_, to study, to  expound. Four different methods of explaining the sacred Scriptures were  current: the first aimed to reach the simple understanding of words as  they stood; the second availed itself of suggestions offered by  apparently superfluous letters and signs in the text to arrive at its  meaning; the third was \"a homiletic application of that which had been  to that which was and"]]]
