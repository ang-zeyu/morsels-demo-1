It is said that the female would shrink from the too persistent gaze of  a spectator, and throw herself into the arms of the male, hiding her  face in his bosom.      The Maternal Instinct.    In his \"Marvels and Mysteries of Instinct,\" Mr. Garrett gives the  following instance of maternal affection. \"A gentleman was out with a  party of men in Sumatra, when in some trees removed from a dense forest  a female orang-utan, with a young one in its arms, was discovered, and  the pursuit commenced. In the ardour of the moment, and excited by the  hope of possessing an animal so rare, the gentleman forgot everything  but the prize before him, and urged on his men by the promise of a  reward, should their exertions be successful. Thus stimulated they  followed up the chase; the animal, encumbered by her young one, making  prodigious efforts to gain the dense and intricate recesses of the wood,  springing from tree to tree, and endeavouring by every means to elude  her pursuers. Several shots were fired, and at length one took fatal  effect, the ball penetrating the right side of the chest. Feeling  herself mortally wounded, and with the blood gushing from her mouth, she  from that moment took no care of herself, but with a mother's feelings  summoned up all her dying energies to save her young one. She threw it  onwards over the tops of the trees, and from one branch to another,  taking the most desperate leaps after it herself, and again facilitating  its progress until, the intricacy of the forest being nearly gained, its  chances of success were sure. All this time the blood was flowing: but  her efforts had been unabated, and it was only when her young one was  on the point of attaining to a place of safety that she rested on one of  the topmost branches of a gigantic tree. True to her ruling passion,  even in death, she turned for a moment to gaze after her young one,  reeled, and fell head foremost to the ground. The sight was so touching  that it called forth the sympathy of the whole party. The eagerness of  the chase subsided; and so deep an impression did the maternal  tenderness and unexpected self-devotion of the poor orang make on the  gentleman alluded to, whose heart was indeed formed in 'nature's  gentlest mould,' that he expressed the utmost remorse and pity,  declaring that he would not go through the same scene again for all the  world; nor did the tragical death of the animal cease to haunt his mind  for many weeks, and he never afterwards recurred to it but with feelings  of emotion. The preserved skin is now in the Museum of the Zoological  Society.\"      Gibbons or Long Armed Apes.    The gibbons belong to the genus Hylobates, of which there are several  species. They are characterised by the ability to walk almost erect,  hence the name Hylobates. They live in the tops of trees, in large  companies and possess marvellous powers of locomotion, swinging  themselves from tree to tree with such rapidity as to baffle all  pursuit. When on the ground they balance themselves in walking by  holding their hands above their heads. The adult gibbon is about three  feet in height and has a reach of arms of about six feet. The gibbon is  tractable and capable of strong affection towards those who show it  kindness. One of the Hoolock species petted by Dr. Burrough, became  companionable and would sit at his master's breakfast-table, eat eggs  and chicken, and drink tea and coffee with great propriety. Fruit was  his favourite food, but insects were especially palatable to him and he  was an expert in catching flies. The siamang differs from the other  species of long-armed apes in the formation of its feet and in several  other characteristics. It is, however, similar to the Hoolock in its  amenity to kindness and its affection for its master, when brought under  the influence of kindly treatment. The gibbons have great strength in  their lower limbs, whereby they are enabled to leap surprising  distances. M. Duvaneel said he once saw one of these animals clear a  space of forty feet, from the branch of a tree. Mr. George Bennet, in  his \"Wanderings,\" describes the action of a siamang that belonged to  him, which having managed to free himself of his tether, proceeded to  embrace the legs of the Malays whom he came across, until he discovered  his former master, whereupon he climbed into the Malay's arms and hugged  him with the tenderest affection.      Monkeys.    Monkeys differ from the apes we have dealt with in the important  characteristic, among others, of possessing tails. These vary in length  from inches to feet, in some cases being considerably longer than the  body and in others little more than stumps. They vary also in form, some  being completely covered with hair, and others only partially so; some  apparently useful only as ornaments, others being prehensile, that is  capable of grasp, and giving their owners almost the advantage of a  fifth limb.      The Sacred Monkeys.    The Sacred Monkeys (_SemnopithecidA|_) include two genera and a large  number of species. Among these are the species which bear the name of  HanumAin, a Hindoo divinity, and are worshipped in his honour. The  protection these monkeys receive on account of the superstitions  prevalent concerning them, leads to their large increase in numbers and  to many inconveniences arising therefrom. It is said that if a traveller  should be unfortunate enough to offend one of these animals he is likely  enough to be followed by the whole party howling in a most hideous and  discordant manner, and pelting him with any missiles upon which they can  lay their hands. There are eighteen species of the Semnopithecus, all of  which are found in the East. Of these the Entellus is one of the best  known species. It is very susceptible to cold, and cannot live long in  Europe.      The Long-nosed Monkey.    The Long-nosed Monkey (_Semnopithecus Larvatus_) belongs to this family  and is distinguished, as its name implies, by the length of its  proboscis. This animal is described by Wallace as about the size of a  child of three years of age, while possessing a nose considerably longer  than that of any human adult. From the head to the tip of the tail the  proboscis monkey measures about four feet and a half. It is sometimes  called the Kahau from its cry which resembles the sound of that word. It  is said to hold its nose when leaping to protect it from being injured  by the branches of trees. The second genus of this family, of which  there are numerous species, belongs to Africa.      Cheek-pouched Monkeys.    The Cheek-pouched Monkeys form the third family of the quadrumana. They  include seven genera, and sixty or seventy species, of which five genera  belong to Africa and two to Asia and to the Malay Islands. Among the  better known of these species is the Talapoin of West Africa; the Diana  monkey and the Mona (Africa); the little White-nosed monkey (Guinea);  the Grivet (Nubia and Abyssinia); the Green monkey (Cape de Verds); the  Patas (Senegal); the Malbrouck monkey; and the Vervet monkey (South  Africa). The Green monkey and the Vervet monkey are those most commonly  seen in England. One of the best known members of this family is the  Baboon.      The Baboon.    The baboon is found in many parts of Africa, and one of its species in  Arabia. It is of the genus _cynocephalus_, and some of its species  attain to considerable size; the head and face of one species resembling  those of a dog, it is sometimes called the dog-faced baboon. The baboon  herds in large numbers, and is said to make apparently organized attacks  upon villages during the absence of the peasants in harvest time,  placing sentinels on the look out, to apprise them of danger, while they  visit the houses and take possession of all the food they can find. They  are cunning and powerful, and formidable in combat, but, greedy in  habit, they eat to excess, and when gorged to satiety fall an easy prey  to their enemies. In their wild state they feed on berries and bulbous  roots, but when proximity to civilisation gives them wider opportunity,  they show their appreciation of a more varied menu. Among the more  familiar species of the baboon are the _Chackma_, the _Drill_, the  _Mandrill_, the _Anubis_, the _Babouin_, and the _Sphinx_, all of which  belong to the West of Africa.      The Arabian Baboon.    The Arabian baboon is an animal with a history. It was worshipped by the  Egyptians, who embalmed its body after death and set apart portions of  their cemeteries for its use. Sacred to Thoth, the Egyptian Hermes, the  God of letters, the baboon sometimes represents that deity in Egyptian  sculptures, where it is usually figured in a sitting posture, the  attitude in which its body was generally embalmed. The baboon was also  held as emblematic of the Moon, and honoured symbolically in other  connections. It is commonly represented in judgment scenes of the dead  with a pair of scales in front of it, Thoth being supposed to exercise  important duties in the final judgment of men. The baboon was held  especially sacred at Hermopolis. According to Sir J. G. Wilkinson the  Egyptians trained baboons to useful offices, making them torch-bearers  at their feasts and festivals.      The Imitative Faculty of the Baboon.    Like others of the monkey tribes the baboon shows an extraordinary  faculty for imitation. Captain Browne in his \"Characteristics of  Animals\" says: \"The following circumstance is truly characteristic of  the imitative powers of the baboon:--The army of Alexander the Great  marched in complete battle-array into a country inhabited by great  numbers of baboons, and encamped there for the night. The next morning,  when the army was about to proceed on its march, the soldiers saw, at  some distance, an enormous number of baboons, drawn up in rank and file,  like a small army, with such"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3796"],[0,"Rilla of Ingleside (#7)"],[1,"lingered for a moment  in the glow of the lanterns at the entrance looking at the dancers. A  momentary break in the whirling throng gave her a glimpse of Kenneth  Ford standing at the other side.    Rilla's heart skipped a beat--or, if that be a physiological  impossibility, she thought it did. So he was here, after all. She had  concluded he was not coming--not that it mattered in the least. Would  he see her? Would he take any notice of her? Of course, he wouldn't ask  her to dance--that couldn't be hoped for. He thought her just a mere  child. He had called her \"Spider\" not three weeks ago when he had been  at Ingleside one evening. She had cried about it upstairs afterwards  and hated him. But her heart skipped a beat when she saw that he was  edging his way round the side of the pavilion towards her. Was he  coming to her--was he?--was he?--yes, he was! He was looking for  her--he was here beside her--he was gazing down at her with something  in his dark grey eyes that Rilla had never seen in them. Oh, it was  almost too much to bear! and everything was going on as before--the  dancers were spinning round, the boys who couldn't get partners were  hanging about the pavilion, canoodling couples were sitting out on the  rocks--nobody seemed to realize what a stupendous thing had happened.    Kenneth was a tall lad, very good looking, with a certain careless  grace of bearing that somehow made all the other boys seem stiff and  awkward by contrast. He was reported to be awesomely clever, with the  glamour of a far-away city and a big university hanging around him. He  had also the reputation of being a bit of a lady-killer. But that  probably accrued to him from his possession of a laughing, velvety  voice which no girl could hear without a heartbeat, and a dangerous way  of listening as if she were saying something that he had longed all his  life to hear.    \"Is this Rilla-my-Rilla?\" he asked in a low tone.    \"Yeth,\" said Rilla, and immediately wished she could throw herself  headlong down the lighthouse rock or otherwise vanish from a jeering  world.    Rilla had lisped in early childhood; but she had grown out of it. Only  on occasions of stress and strain did the tendency re-assert itself.  She hadn't lisped for a year; and now at this very moment, when she was  so especially desirous of appearing grown up and sophisticated, she  must go and lisp like a baby! It was too mortifying; she felt as if  tears were going to come into her eyes; the next minute she would  be--blubbering--yes, just blubbering--she wished Kenneth would go  away--she wished he had never come. The party was spoiled. Everything  had turned to dust and ashes.    And he had called her \"Rilla-my-Rilla\"--not \"Spider\" or \"Kid\" or  \"Puss,\" as he had been used to call her when he took any notice  whatever of her. She did not at all resent his using Walter's pet name  for her; it sounded beautifully in his low caressing tones, with just  the faintest suggestion of emphasis on the \"my.\" It would have been so  nice if she had not made a fool of herself. She dared not look up lest  she should see laughter in his eyes. So she looked down; and as her  lashes were very long and dark and her lids very thick and creamy, the  effect was quite charming and provocative, and Kenneth reflected that  Rilla Blythe was going to be the beauty of the Ingleside girls after  all. He wanted to make her look up--to catch again that little, demure,  questioning glance. She was the prettiest thing at the party, there was  no doubt of that.    What was he saying? Rilla could hardly believe her ears.    \"Can we have a dance?\"    \"Yes,\" said Rilla. She said it with such a fierce determination not to  lisp that she fairly blurted the word out. Then she writhed in spirit  again. It sounded so bold--so eager--as if she were fairly jumping at  him! What would he think of her? Oh, why did dreadful things like this  happen, just when a girl wanted to appear at her best?    Kenneth drew her in among the dancers.    \"I think this game ankle of mine is good for one hop around, at least,\"  he said.    \"How is your ankle?\" said Rilla. Oh, why couldn't she think of  something else to say? She knew he was sick of inquiries about his  ankle. She had heard him say so at Ingleside--heard him tell Di he was  going to wear a placard on his breast announcing to all and sundry that  the ankle was improving, etc. And now she must go and ask this stale  question again.    Kenneth was tired of inquiries about his ankle. But then he had not  often been asked about it by lips with such an adorable kissable dent  just above them. Perhaps that was why he answered very patiently that  it was getting on well and didn't trouble him much, if he didn't walk  or stand too long at a time.    \"They tell me it will be as strong as ever in time, but I'll have to  cut football out this fall.\"    They danced together and Rilla knew every girl in sight envied her.  After the dance they went down the rock steps and Kenneth found a  little flat and they rowed across the moonlit channel to the  sand-shore; they walked on the sand till Kenneth's ankle made protest  and then they sat down among the dunes. Kenneth talked to her as he had  talked to Nan and Di. Rilla, overcome with a shyness she did not  understand, could not talk much, and thought he would think her  frightfully stupid; but in spite of this it was all very wonderful--the  exquisite moonlit night, the shining sea, the tiny little wavelets  swishing on the sand, the cool and freakish wind of night crooning in  the stiff grasses on the crest of the dunes, the music sounding faintly  and sweetly over the channel.    \"'A merry lilt o' moonlight for mermaiden revelry,'\" quoted Kenneth  softly from one of Walter's poems.    And just he and she alone together in the glamour of sound and sight!  If only her slippers didn't bite so! and if only she could talk  cleverly like Miss Oliver--nay, if she could only talk as she did  herself to other boys! But words would not come, she could only listen  and murmur little commonplace sentences now and again. But perhaps her  dreamy eyes and her dented lip and her slender throat talked eloquently  for her. At any rate Kenneth seemed in no hurry to suggest going back  and when they did go back supper was in progress. He found a seat for  her near the window of the lighthouse kitchen and sat on the sill  beside her while she ate her ices and cake. Rilla looked about her and  thought how lovely her first party had been. She would never forget it.  The room re-echoed to laughter and jest. Beautiful young eyes sparkled  and shone. From the pavilion outside came the lilt of the fiddle and  the rhythmic steps of the dancers.    There was a little disturbance among a group of boys crowded about the  door; a young fellow pushed through and halted on the threshold,  looking about him rather sombrely. It was Jack Elliott from  over-harbour--a McGill medical student, a quiet chap not much addicted  to social doings. He had been invited to the party but had not been  expected to come since he had to go to Charlottetown that day and could  not be back until late. Yet here he was--and he carried a folded paper  in his hand.    Gertrude Oliver looked at him from her corner and shivered again. She  had enjoyed the party herself, after all, for she had foregathered with  a Charlottetown acquaintance who, being a stranger and much older than  most of the guests, felt himself rather out of it, and had been glad to  fall in with this clever girl who could talk of world doings and  outside events with the zest and vigour of a man. In the pleasure of  his society she had forgotten some of her misgivings of the day. Now  they suddenly returned to her. What news did Jack Elliott bring? Lines  from an old poem flashed unbidden into her mind--\"there was a sound of  revelry by night\"--\"Hush! Hark! A deep sound strikes like a rising  knell\"--why should she think of that now? Why didn't Jack Elliott  speak--if he had anything to tell? Why did he just stand there,  glowering importantly?    \"Ask him--ask him,\" she said feverishly to Allan Daly. But somebody  else had already asked him. The room grew very silent all at once.  Outside the fiddler had stopped for a rest and there was silence there  too. Afar off they heard the low moan of the gulf--the presage of a  storm already on its way up the Atlantic. A girl's laugh drifted up  from the rocks and died away as if frightened out of existence by the  sudden stillness.    \"England declared war on Germany today,\" said Jack Elliott slowly. \"The  news came by wire just as I left town.\"    \"God help us,\" whispered Gertrude Oliver under her breath. \"My  dream--my dream! The first wave has broken.\" She looked at Allan Daly  and tried to smile.    \"Is this Armageddon?\" she asked.    \"I am afraid so,\" he said gravely.    A chorus of exclamations had arisen round them--light surprise and idle  interest for the most part. Few there realized the import of the  message--fewer still realized that it meant anything to them. Before  long the dancing was on again and the hum of pleasure was as loud as  ever. Gertrude and Allan Daly talked the news over in low, troubled  tones. Walter Blythe had turned pale and left the room. Outside he met  Jem, hurrying up the rock steps.    \"Have you heard the news, Jem?\"    \"Yes. The Piper has come. Hurrah! I knew England wouldn't leave France  in the lurch. I've been trying to get Captain Josiah to hoist the flag  but he says it isn't the proper caper till sunrise. Jack says they'll  be calling for volunteers tomorrow.\"    \"What a fuss to make over nothing,\" said Mary Vance disdainfully as Jem  dashed off. She was sitting out with Miller Douglas on a lobster trap  which was not only an unromantic but an uncomfortable seat. But Mary  and Miller were both supremely happy on it. Miller Douglas was a big,  strapping, uncouth lad, who thought Mary Vance's tongue uncommonly "]]]
