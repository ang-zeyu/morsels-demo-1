Porcupines  were suspected of killing ponderosa pine, which occurred in only a few  places, and which was thought to be necessary for wild turkeys.  Porcupines were recorded as follows: one found dead on the road at the  North Rim on March 16; one killed in oak brush along the North Rim; one  killed between April 15 and May 15; oak brush damaged by porcupines in  Soda Canyon below the well; one seen on July 4 on the Poole Canyon  Trail; one seen at the foot of the Mesa on June 26; one seen by Lloyd  White in Moccasin Canyon on June 27; and one seen by Mrs. Sharon Spencer  on July 1 in Prater Canyon. After four months on the Mesa Verde,  Quaintance concluded that there were not so many porcupines as had been  expected and that there were more ponderosa pines than had been  expected.    In 1946, Donald A. Spencer began a study of porcupines on the Mesa Verde  and in 1958 deposited, in the University of Colorado Library, his  results in manuscript form as a dissertation in partial fulfillment of  the requirements for a higher degree (\"Porcupine population fluctuations  in past centuries revealed by dendrochronology,\" 108 numbered and 13  unnumbered pages, 39 figures, and 13 tables). Dendrochronology, or the  dating of trees by studying their rings, is a technique widely used in  the southwest by archeologists, climatologists, and others. Spencer  found that porcupines damage trees in a characteristic manner, and that  damage to a pinyon pine was evident as long as the tree lived. By dating  approximately 2000 scars and plotting the year for each scar, Spencer  observed three peaks since 1865; these were in about 1885, 1905, and  1935. The increase and decrease each time were at about the same rate.  The study did not yield precise population estimates. Some porcupines  were destroyed but Spencer is of the opinion that the decline that came  in following years was independent of the control measures. Spencer  thinks that activities of porcupines on the Mesa Verde are a major  factor in maintaining a forest cover of relatively young trees, and also  in preventing invasion of trees into areas of brush.    The general policy in regard to porcupines from 1930 to 1946 was to kill  them because they eat parts of trees. In at least the following years  porcupines were killed: 1930, 1933, 1935, 1940, 1943, 1944, and 1946.  The largest number reported killed in one year is 71 in 1933 when a crew  of men was employed for this purpose. The amount of effort devoted to  killing porcupines varied from year to year. The most frequently voiced  alarm was that the scenic value of the areas along the entrance highway  and near certain ruins was being impaired. The direst prediction was  that all pine trees on the Mesa Verde were doomed to extinction in the  near future. The last prediction has not come to pass, nor has this  extinction occurred in the past thousand years and more during which  pine trees and porcupines have existed together on the Mesa Verde.    In 1946 the studies of Spencer, Wade, and Fitch began. Much effort was  expended in obtaining and dating scars for analysis, and the interesting  results mentioned above were the reward. Also many porcupines were  captured alive and marked with ear-tags so that they could be recognized  later. For example, in the winter of 1946 and 1947, 117 were marked in  Soda Canyon. A decline in numbers in recent years reduced the impetus  for continuation of the study by reducing the results obtained for each  day spent searching for porcupines. Information obtained on movements of  porcupines relative to season and weather conditions in these studies  may be summarized and published later. Data regarding ratio of young to  adult animals from year to year are also of interest.    The effect of a porcupine on a single tree is often easy to assess. The  effect of a fluctuating population of porcupines on a mixed forest is  not so easy to assess, but is of more intrinsic interest. It is  desirable that studies designed to evaluate the latter effect continue  while the population remains low and also when the next cyclic increase  begins. Publication of Spencer's results would be a major step forward.    Cahalane (1948:253) mentions the difficulty that has been experienced in  protecting aesthetically desirable trees around cliff dwellings. Perhaps  in a local area removal of porcupines is sometimes warranted, but  control of the porcupine seems undesirable to me, as a general policy,  because one purpose of a National Park is to preserve natural conditions  and that implies naturally occurring changes.    What is needed is continued careful study of the ecological  relationships of animals and of plants. National parks provide, to the  extent that they are not disturbed or \"controlled,\" especially favorable  places for studies of this sort.      Mus musculus subsp. House Mouse         _Specimens examined._--Total, 7: North end Mesa Verde National       Park, 7000 ft, 76290; west bank Mancos River northeast side Mesa       Verde National Park, 76291-76296.

E Waters Cabin, 6400 ft., August 29, 1956, probably       killed by man; ad. [Male], 76298, taken by J.R. Alcorn, November       10, 1957, on the top of the Mesa at Square Tower House; and skin       and skull, MV 7858/507, without data.    Tracks or scats of the coyote were seen in all parts of the Park  visited. Coyotes range throughout the area. On September 3, 1956, 35  coyote scats were found on the dirt roads in Prater and Morfield canyons  above 7300 feet elevation and on the road crossing the divide between  these canyons. Probably none of these scats was more than a month old.  Coyote tracks were seen at some of the fresher scats. Scats associated  with fox tracks and scats of small size were not picked up.  Nevertheless, a few of the scats studied may have been those of foxes.  Judging from the contents of scats that were certainly from foxes, the  effect of inadvertent inclusion of fox scats would be to elevate the  percentage of scats containing berries (but not more than five  percentage points). Each scat was broken up and the percentage of scats  containing each of the following items was noted (figures are to the  nearest per cent). Remains of deer occurred in 48 per cent of scats,  gooseberries (_Ribes_) in 34 per cent, porcupines in 29 per cent,  insects in 11 per cent, birds in 11 per cent, unidentified hair in 9 per  cent, and unidentified material in 6 per cent. One scat (3 per cent)  contained an appreciable amount of plant debris, one contained  _Microtus_ along with other items, and one contained only _Sylvilagus_;  14 scats had material of more than one category. The percentage in each  category of the volume of each scat was estimated. Data on volume  warrant no conclusion other than one that can be drawn from the  percentages of occurrence, namely that the major food sources used in  August, 1956, by coyotes in these canyons were deer, berries, and  porcupines and that other sources, though used, were relatively  unimportant. Deer were common in the area. It is fortunate that coyotes  remain to help regulate the deer population. Wolves, _Canis lupus_,  which at one time occurred in the Park, are now gone. The coyote and  mountain lion are the only sizeable predators that remain.      Vulpes vulpes macroura Baird Red Fox    D. Watson (in letter of January 16, 1957) reported that red foxes have  been seen on the Mesa by several employees of the Park. These persons  know the gray fox, which often is seen in winter feeding at their back  doors, and Mr. Watson considers the reports reliable. In the early  morning of October 24, 1943, a reddish-yellow fox having a white-tipped  tail was observed by three men, one of whom was Chief Ranger Wade, at  Park Point. In 1948, 1950, and 1953 black foxes have been reported.      Urocyon cinereoargenteus scottii Mearns Gray Fox         _Specimens examined._--Total, 3: [Male], MV 7867/507, 2 mi. N of       Headquarters, 7400 ft., September 24, 1935, H.P. Pratt; [Male],       76299, November 9, and [Female], 76300, trapped on November 12,       1957, by J.R. Alcorn at Square Tower House.    The gray fox is common on the Mesa.      Ursus americanus amblyceps Baird Black Bear    From 1929 through 1959 at least 151 observations of bears were recorded.  Observations were unrecorded in only five years--1952, 1953, 1954, 1956,  and 1958. Most observations were in the 1940's and the peak was in 1944  (18 observations) and 1945 (21 observations). Cubs have been recorded in  10 different years. If dated reports are tabulated by months the  following figures are obtained for the 12 months beginning with January:  0, 0, 0, 4, 15, 19, 19, 9, 10, 9, 3, 0. The peak in the summer months  and the absence of observations in the winter months are significant.  Individual bears probably enter and leave the Park in the course of  their normal wanderings; however bears probably hibernate, breed, and  bear young within the Park and should not be regarded as merely  occasionally wandering into the Park.      Procyon lotor pallidus Merriam Raccoon    In December, 1959, three raccoons were seen on Prater Grade and later  three were seen in Morfield Canyon near the tunnel. I saw a dead raccoon  at the side of the highway 3 mi. WSW of Mancos, 6700 feet, on August 8,  1956. This locality is outside of the Park and not on the Mesa, but is  mentioned because it indicates that the raccoon probably occurs along  the Mancos River, which forms the eastern boundary of the Park. The  raccoon is rare in the area. Some local persons were surprised to hear  of its presence; other persons told me that raccoons were present, but"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31078"],[0,"Curiosities of Literature, Vol. 3 (#7)"],[1,"oke, as being a thing entirely     needless and unprofitable.       Give me leave further to observe, that you are in no ways _concerned_     in the matter, as you seem to be apprehensive you are. Suppose some     MSS. have been taken out of your library, who will say you ought to     bear the guilt of it? What man in his senses, who has the honour to     know you, will say you gave your consent to such thing--that you was     privy to it? How can you then take upon yourself an action to which     you was neither privy and consenting? Do not such things happen every     day, and do the losers think themselves injured or _abused_ when they     are talked of? Is it impossible to be betrayed by a person we     confided in?       You call what I told you was a report, a surmise; you call it, I say,     an _information_, and speak of _informers_ as if there was a plot     laid wherein I received the information: I thought I had the honour     to be better known to you. Mr. Collins loved me and esteemed me for     my integrity and sincerity, of which he had several proofs; how I     have been drawn in to injure him, to forfeit the good opinion he had     of me, and which, were he now alive, would deservedly expose me to     his utmost contempt, is a grief which I shall carry to the grave. It     would be a sort of comfort to me, if those who have consented I     should be drawn in were in some measure sensible of the guilt towards     so good, kind, and generous a man.      Thus we find that, _seven years_ after Des Maizeaux had inconsiderately  betrayed his sacred trust, his remorse was still awake; and the  sincerity of his grief is attested by the affecting style which  describes it: the spirit of his departed friend seemed to be hovering  about him, and, in his imagination, would haunt him to the grave.    The nature of these manuscripts; the cause of the earnest desire of  retaining them by the widow; the evident unfriendliness of her conduct  to Des Maizeaux; and whether these manuscripts, consisting of eight  octavo volumes with their transcripts, were destroyed, or are still  existing, are all circumstances which my researches have hitherto not  ascertained.      FOOTNOTES:      [14] _Van Effen_ was a Dutch writer of some merit, and one of a      literary knot of ingenious men, consisting of Sallengre, St.      Hyacinthe, Prosper Marchand, &c., who carried on a smart review for      those days, published at the Hague under the title of \"Journal      Litteraire.\" They all composed in French; and Van Effen gave the      first translations of our \"Guardian,\" \"Robinson Crusoe,\" and the      \"Tale of a Tub,\" &c. He did something more, but not better; he      attempted to imitate the \"Spectator,\" in his \"Le Misanthrope,\" 1726,      which exhibits a picture of the uninteresting manners of a nation      whom he could not make very lively.        _De Limiers_ has had his name slipped into our biographical      dictionaries. An author cannot escape the fatality of the alphabet;      his numerous misdeeds are registered. It is said, that if he had not      been so hungry, he would have given proofs of possessing some      talent.      [15] I find that the nominal pension was 3_s._ 6_d._ per diem on the      Irish civil list, which amounts to above 63_l._ per annum. If a      pension be granted for reward, it seems a mockery that the income      should be so grievously reduced, which cruel custom still prevails.      [16] This letter, or petition, was written in 1732. In 1743 he      procured his pension to be placed on his wife's life, and he died in      1745.        He was sworn in as gentleman of his majesty's privy chamber in      1722--_Sloane MSS._ 4289.      [17] There is a printed catalogue of his library.      [18] This information is from a note found among Des Maizeaux's      papers; but its truth I have no means to ascertain.          HISTORY OF NEW WORDS.      Neology, or the novelty of words and phrases, is an innovation, which,  with the opulence of our present language, the English philologer is  most jealous to allow; but we have puritans or precisians of English,  superstitiously nice! The fantastic coinage of affectation or caprice  will cease to circulate from its own alloy; but shall we reject the ore  of fine workmanship and solid weight? There is no government mint of  words, and it is no statutable offence to invent a felicitous or daring  expression unauthorised by Mr. Todd! When a man of genius, in the heat  of his pursuits or his feelings, has thrown out a peculiar word, it  probably conveyed more precision or energy than any other established  word, otherwise he is but an ignorant pretender!    Julius Caesar, who, unlike other great captains, is authority on words as  well as about blows, wrote a large treatise on \"Analogy,\" in which that  fine genius counselled to \"avoid every unusual word as a rock!\"[19] The  cautious Quintilian, as might be expected, opposes all innovation in  language. \"If the new word is well received, small is the glory; if  rejected, it raises laughter.\"[20] This only marks the penury of his  feelings in this species of adventure. The great legislator of words,  who lived when his own language was at its acme, seems undecided, yet  pleaded for this liberty. \"Shall that which the Romans allowed to  Caecilius and to Plautus be refused to Virgil and Varius?\" The answer to  the question might not be favourable to the inquirer. While a language  is forming, writers are applauded for extending its limits; when  established, for restricting themselves to them. But this is to imagine  that a perfect language can exist! The good sense and observation of  Horace perceived that there may be occasions where necessity must become  the mother of invented words:--                   ----Si forte necesse est    Indiciis monstrare recentibus abdita rerum.      If you write of things abstruse or new,    Some of your own inventing may be used,    So it be seldom and discreetly done.        ROSCOMMON.    But Horace's canon for deciding on the legality of the new invention, or  the standard by which it is to be tried, will not serve to assist the  inventor of words:--                    ----licuit, semperque licebit,    Signatum praesente nota procudere nummum.[21]    This _praesens nota_, or public stamp, can never be affixed to any new  coinage of words: for many received at a season have perished with  it.[22] The privilege of stamping words is reserved for their greatest  enemy--Time itself! and the inventor of a new word must never flatter  himself that he has secured the public adoption, for he must lie in his  grave before he can enter the dictionary.    In Willes' address to the reader, prefixed to the collection of Voyages  published in 1577, he finds fault with Eden's translation from Peter  Martyr, for using words that \"smelt too much of the Latine.\" We should  scarcely have expected to find among them _ponderouse_, _portentouse_,  _despicable_, _obsequious_, _homicide_, _imbibed_, _destructive_,  _prodigious_. The only words he quotes, not thoroughly naturalised, are  _dominators_, _ditionaries_, (subjects), _solicitute_ (careful).    The Tatler, No. 230, introduces several polysyllables introduced by  military narrations, \"which (he says), if they attack us too frequently,  we shall certainly put them to flight, and cut off the rear;\" every one  of them still keep their ground.    Half the French words used affectedly by Melantha, in Dryden's _Marriage  a-la-Mode_, as innovations in our language, are now in common use,  _naivete_, _foible_, _chagrin_, _grimace_, _embarras_, _double  entendre_, _equivoque_, _eclaircissement_, _ridicule_, all these words,  which she learns by heart to use occasionally, are now in common use. A  Dr. Russel called Psalm-singers _Ballad-singers_, having found the Song  of Solomon in an old translation, the _Ballad of Ballads_, for which he  is reproached by his antagonist for not knowing that the signification  of words alters with time; should I call him _knave_, he ought not to be  concerned at it, for the Apostle Paul is also called a _knave of Jesus  Christ_.[23]    Unquestionably, NEOLOGY opens a wide door to innovation; scarcely has a  century passed since our language was patched up with Gallic idioms, as  in the preceding century it was piebald with Spanish, and with Italian,  and even with Dutch. The political intercourse of islanders with their  neighbours has ever influenced their language. In Elizabeth's reign  Italian phrases[24] and Netherland words were imported; in James and  Charles the Spanish framed the style of courtesy; in Charles the Second  the nation and the language were equally Frenchified. Yet such are the  sources from whence we have often derived some of the wealth of our  language!    There are three foul corruptors of a language: caprice, affectation, and  ignorance! Such fashionable cant terms as \"theatricals,\" and \"musicals,\"  invented by the flippant Topham, still survive among his confraternity  of frivolity. A lady eminent for the elegance of her taste, and of whom  one of the best judges, the celebrated Miss Edgeworth, observed to me,  that she spoke the purest and most idiomatic English she had ever heard,  threw out an observation which might be extended to a great deal of our  present fashionable vocabulary. She is now old enough, she said, to have  lived to hear the vulgarisms of her youth adopted in drawing-room  circles.[25] To _lunch_, now so familiar from the fairest lips, in her  youth was only known in the servants' hall. An expression very rife of  late among our young ladies, _a nice man_, whatever it may mean, whether  that the man resemble a pudding or something more nice, conveys the  offensive notion that they are ready to eat him up! When I was a boy, it  was an age of _bon ton_; this _good tone_ mysteriously conveyed a  sublime idea of fashion; the term, imported late in the eighteenth"]]]
