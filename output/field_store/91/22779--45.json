After a short parley, however, she       carries him to a woody island, where she leads him into a sort of       silvan mansion, rudely constructed, and hung round with trophies of       war and the chase. An elderly lady is introduced at supper; and the       stranger, after disclosing himself to be 'James Fitz-James, the       knight of Snowdoun,' tries in vain to discover the name and history       of the ladies.         \"The second canto opens with a picture of the aged harper,       Allan-bane, sitting on the island beach with the damsel, watching       the skiff which carries the stranger back to land. A conversation       ensues, from which the reader gathers that the lady is a daughter       of the Douglas, who, being exiled by royal displeasure from court,       had accepted this asylum from Sir Roderick Dhu, a Highland       chieftain long outlawed for deeds of blood; that this dark chief is       in love with his fair _protegee_, but that her affections are       engaged to Malcolm Graeme, a younger and more amiable mountaineer.       The sound of distant music is heard on the lake; and the barges of       Sir Roderick are discovered, proceeding in triumph to the island.       Ellen, hearing her father's horn at that instant on the opposite       shore, flies to meet him and Malcolm Graeme, who is received with       cold and stately civility by the lord of the isle. Sir Roderick       informs the Douglas that his retreat has been discovered, and that       the King (James V), under pretence of hunting, has assembled a       large force in the neighborhood. He then proposes impetuously that       they should unite their fortunes by his marriage with Ellen, and       rouse the whole Western Highlands. The Douglas, intimating that his       daughter has repugnances which she cannot overcome, declares that       he will retire to a cave in the neighboring mountains until the       issue of the King's threat is seen. The heart of Roderick is wrung       with agony at this rejection; and when Malcolm advances to Ellen,       he pushes him violently back--and a scuffle ensues, which is with       difficulty appeased by the giant arm of Douglas. Malcolm then       withdraws in proud resentment, plunges into the water, and swims       over by moonlight to the mainland.         \"The third canto opens with an account of the ceremonies employed       in summoning the clan. This is accomplished by the consecration of       a small wooden cross, which, with its points scorched and dipped in       blood, is carried with incredible celerity through the whole       territory of the chieftain. The eager fidelity with which this       fatal signal is carried on, is represented with great spirit. A       youth starts from the side of his father's coffin, to bear it       forward, and, having run his stage, delivers it to a young       bridegroom returning from church, who instantly binds his plaid       around him, and rushes onward. In the meantime Douglas and his       daughter have taken refuge in the mountain cave; and Sir Roderick,       passing near their retreat on his way to the muster, hears Ellen's       voice singing her evening hymn to the Virgin. He does not obtrude       on her devotions, but hurries to the place of rendezvous.         \"The fourth canto begins with some ceremonies by a wild hermit of       the clan, to ascertain the issue of the impending war; and this       oracle is obtained--that the party shall prevail which first sheds       the blood of its adversary. The scene then shifts to the retreat of       the Douglas, where the minstrel is trying to soothe Ellen in her       alarm at the disappearance of her father by singing a fairy ballad       to her. As the song ends, the knight of Snowdoun suddenly appears       before her, declares his love, and urges her to put herself under       his protection. Ellen throws herself on his generosity, confesses       her attachment to Graeme, and prevails on him to seek his own       safety by a speedy retreat from the territory of Roderick Dhu.       Before he goes, the stranger presents her with a ring, which he       says he has received from King James, with a promise to grant any       boon asked by the person producing it. As he retreats, his       suspicions are excited by the conduct of his guide, and confirmed       by the warnings of a mad woman whom they encounter. His false guide       discharges an arrow at him, which kills the maniac. The knight       slays the murderer; and learning from the expiring victim that her       brain had been turned by the cruelty of Sir Roderick Dhu, he vows       vengeance. When chilled with the midnight cold and exhausted with       fatigue, he suddenly comes upon a chief reposing by a lonely       watch-fire; and being challenged in the name of Roderick Dhu,       boldly avows himself his enemy. The clansman, however, disdains to       take advantage of a worn-out wanderer; and pledges him safe escort       out of Sir Roderick's territory, when he must answer his defiance       with his sword. The stranger accepts these chivalrous terms; and       the warriors sup and sleep together. This ends the fourth canto.         \"At dawn, the knight and the mountaineer proceed toward the Lowland       frontier. A dispute arises concerning the character of Roderick       Dhu, and the knight expresses his desire to meet in person and do       vengeance upon the predatory chief. 'Have then thy wish!' answers       his guide; and gives a loud whistle. A whole legion of armed men       start up from their mountain ambush in the heath; while the chief       turns proudly and says, 'I am Roderick Dhu!' Sir Roderick then by a       signal dismisses his men to their concealment. Arrived at his       frontier, the chief forces the knight to stand upon his defense.       Roderick, after a hard combat is laid wounded on the ground;       Fitz-James, sounding his bugle, brings four squires to his side;       and, after giving the wounded chief into their charge, gallops       rapidly on towards Stirling. As he ascends the hill to the castle,       he descries approaching the same place the giant form of Douglas,       who has come to deliver himself up to the King, in order to save       Malcolm Graeme and Sir Roderick from the impending danger. Before       entering the castle, Douglas is seized with the whim to engage in       the holiday sports which are going forward outside; he wins prize       after prize, and receives his reward from the hand of the prince,       who, however does not condescend to recognize his former favorite.       Roused at last by an insult from one of the royal grooms, Douglas       proclaims himself, and is ordered into custody by the King. At this       instant a messenger arrives with tidings of an approaching battle       between the clan of Roderick and the King's lieutenant, the Earl of       Mar; and is ordered back to prevent the conflict, by announcing       that both Sir Roderick and Lord Douglas are in the hands of their       sovereign.         \"The last canto opens in the guard room of the royal castle at       Stirling, at dawn. While the mercenaries are quarreling and singing       at the close of a night of debauch, the sentinels introduce Ellen       and the minstrel Allan-bane--who are come in search of Douglas.       Ellen awes the ruffian soldiery by her grace and liberality, and is       at length conducted to a more seemly waiting place, until she may       obtain audience with the King. While Allan-bane, in the cell of Sir       Roderick, sings to the dying chieftain of the glorious battle which       has just been waged by his clansmen against the forces of the Earl       of Mar, Ellen, in another part of the palace, hears the voice of       Malcolm Graeme lamenting his captivity from an adjoining turret.       Before she recovers from her agitation she is startled by the       appearance of Fitz-James, who comes to inform her that the court is       assembled, and the King at leisure to receive her suit. He conducts       her to the hall of presence, round which Ellen casts a timid and       eager glance for the monarch. But all the glittering figures are       uncovered, and James Fitz-James alone wears his cap and plume. The       Knight of Snowdoun is the King of Scotland! Struck with awe and       terror, Ellen falls speechless at his feet, pointing to the ring       which he has put upon her finger. The prince raises her with eager       kindness, declares that her father is forgiven, and bids her ask       for a boon for some other person. The name of Graeme trembles on       her lips, but she cannot trust herself to utter it. The King, in       playful vengeance, condemns Malcolm Graeme to fetters, takes a       chain of gold from his own neck, and throwing it over that of the       young chief, puts the clasp in the hand of Ellen.\"    From this outline, it will be evident that Scott had gained greatly in  narrative power since the production of _The Lay of the Last Minstrel_.  Not only are the elements of the \"fable\" (to use the word in its  old-fashioned sense) harmonious and probable, but the various incidents  grow out of each other in a natural and necessary way. The _Lay_ was at  best a skillful bit of carpentering whereof the several parts were  nicely juxtaposed; _The Lady of the Lake_ is an organism, and its  several members partake of a common life. A few weaknesses may, it is  true, be pointed out in it. The warning of Fitz-James by the mad woman's  song makes too large a draft upon our romantic credulity. Her appearance  is at once so accidental and so opportune that it resembles those  supernatural interventions employed by ancient tragedy to cut the knot  of a difficult situation, which have given rise to the phrase _deus ex  machina_. The improbability of the episode is"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28297"],[0,"The Christian Foundation, Or, Scientific and Religious Journal, May, 1880 (#7)"],[1,"man's nature which are generally at war with each  other, leading to different and antagonistic results. During the dark  ages, which were ushered in through the repudiation of intelligence and  the predominance of passion, the emotional reigned, and men were governed  by their passions in religious as well as state affairs. The shadows of  those ages still linger with some communities, and with many persons in  almost all communities. Our fathers had a long and hard struggle in  getting away from an emotional to an intellectual state, both in civil as  well as religious affairs. To-day, if we consider this matter in  connection with our people as a nation, we may safely say that we are in  an intellectual period--mind predominates. This is an age of investigation.  The time was, in the history of our fathers, when a man was fined fifty  pounds of tobacco if he refused to have his innocent child christened.  _See the_ \"_old Blue Laws._\" The time was when innocent persons were  tried, condemned, and put to death for being, in the estimation of men,  clothed with disgraceful ignorance, _witches_. Who has not heard of the  \"Salem witchcraft?\"    The emotional nature of man, as a ruling sovereign, is losing its  \"legal-tender value\" daily. The time was when it brought a premium in the  most of the churches in our country. An aged father, who is now \"across  the river,\" once said to me, \"I was bewildered, and mentally lost for  thirty years of my life.\" I asked him for the facts. He, answering, said:  \"During all that period of time I was a church member, and, like some  others, I was a quiet, still kind of a soul; I paid my honest debts; told  the truth about my neighbors, and lived a moral life to the very best of  my abilities. There were others of the same character. The preachers  frequently called us Quakers--the Quakers were a very still people in those  days. There were others who were reckless; would not always tell the  truth, and would not always pay their honest debts, but they were,  nevertheless, very noisy in the church, and the preacher always made most  of those noisy fellows. Now,\" said the aged father, \"I never could  understand that.\" The old man lived to learn the secret, and changed his  religious relations and began a new life in religion.    The scenes of the \"Cane Ridge revival,\" down in Kentucky, have not been  repeated in all our country for more than twenty years, and it is probable  that they never will be. There are many things in the past history of  religion in our country that will never be repeated. Did you ever witness  a panic in a large congregation of people? If you have, you may go with me  to \"Cane Ridge.\" Before we start I wish to remind you of the fact that  some of the most fearful panics known to men took place where, and when,  there was no reason for them outside of existing ignorance. Fright or  fear, coupled with ignorance, produced them. Now let us go to \"Cane  Ridge.\" There we find the people in the emotional period in the history of  religion. They are laboring under the conviction that Jehovah has  concentrated all the powers of His Spirit at Cane Ridge--it is the common  conviction. The people all over the country believe that God is there. The  excitement runs high, and yet higher; it becomes contagious--a religious  epidemic--the ruling element being the thought of the presence of the  Divine Majesty, and the emotional nature of man the field of its  operations. All the ignorance of a genuine panic is there. There were no  well-informed unbelievers there to tear off the veil, nor better-informed  Christians to remove it, not even so much as a Wesley to exonerate God by  saying, \"I am constrained to believe that it is the devil tearing them as  they are coming to Christ.\" No! There is one conviction at Cane Ridge--it  is this: _Jehovah is here._ It was a wonderful panic--a wonderful time.  Persons going on to the ground immediately fell down like dead men; got up  with the jerks; barked like dogs. Women went backwards and forwards,  making singular gestures; their heads were bobbing with the jerks, and  their long hair cracking like whips. The scene was beyond description. The  whole country flocked to the place, and all were confounded with amazement  and astonishment.    If such operations were religion, our country has been without it for a  long time. Then our old-fashioned camp-meetings--where are they? They are  things of the past. I recollect leaving a camp-ground at a late hour of  the night, just as the congregation divided up into groups, and the groups  went out into the woods in different directions to engage in secret  prayer. We heard them when we were three miles away--_strange secret  prayer_! Do you know anything of that kind of secret prayer at the present  time?    The common pulpit teaching of those times was wonderful(?), but it was the  best they had. It was common for preachers to make war upon education.  They often boasted of their ignorance. They claimed that education was not  necessary to qualify a man for the pulpit. The best school teachers in our  country received twelve and fifteen dollars per month for teaching, and  boarded themselves. Teachers who now pay five dollars per week for board,  can't see how those old teachers got along upon such wages. In those times  it was very common for teachers to get their board for seventy-five cents  per week. The farmers claimed that it was unnecessary to educate their  daughters, and only necessary to educate their sons sufficiently well to  enable them to keep their accounts. Beyond this it was often claimed that  an education was of no value--that it only made rascals. I recollect a very  zealous old man who preached for the German Baptists; he is now \"across  the waves.\" Once, in my presence, he disposed of a grammatical argument  that was put against him, by saying, \"It is the wisdom of the world, and  it is sensual and devilish.\" It was common forty years ago for preachers  to say, \"I don't know what I shall say, but just as the Lord gives it to  me I will hand it to you.\" As a general thing those men knew no better,  and the masses of the people knew no better. The people were living in an  Emotional period, with the exception of a few brave thinkers, and they  were governed by their emotions.    Prosperity grew with the growth of our country, and the standard of  education was elevated. The free-school system took the place of the  old-fashioned subscription schools, which were worth twelve dollars per  month to the whole community, and the brave thinkers continued stirring up  thought in religion, and giving the fathers and mothers trouble about this  thing of confounding religion with passion, and our country is now fairly  at sea in an Intellectual period. Religion is now a thing to be learned  and lived--_to be done_. Those brave men who advocated an intelligent  religion forty years ago, were denounced, from almost every pulpit in our  country, as a set of \"whitewashed infidels,\" having no religion, and  \"without God in the world.\"    But that day is past, and we are in a period in which mind generally  predominates. The language of the emotional is seldom heard. In that  period it was common to hear men ask: \"How did you get religion?\" \"where  did you get religion?\" \"where did you get religion?\" \"describe it;\" \"O I  can't, it is better felt than expressed.\" Such language was in keeping  with a very common idea which was held sacred in those days. It was this,  the Lord made general provision for the salvation of men, but He makes a  special application to the sinner. Of course, all to whom salvation was  not especially applied, were, in the estimation of those people, _lost_.  There are a few communities yet that are away back in the emotional  period. There are men and women in every community who are yet governed by  their emotional nature in matters of religion. Those persons have no use  for an intelligent, argumentative preacher. They want a preacher who will  say smoothe things; and there is now and then a preacher who has no  strength outside of the emotional.    We have an emotional nature. I am glad that we have. I would not be an  intellectual wooden-man if I could. But if you say, the Almighty Father  intended that we should be intellectually subordinated to our emotional  nature, and therefore governed by our passions, or feelings, I shall deny  it. He never intended that we should be governed by our passions. To-day  there are strong intellects in unbelief flooding our country with their  literature. How shall they be met? Mr. Moody says, \"Show them that you are  full of Jesus Christ and the Holy Ghost.\" Very well. Can you do that  without the truth? can you do that without word or wisdom? can you do it  without \"contending earnestly for the faith once delivered unto the  saints?\" In the days of Christ and His apostles the men who were full of  the Holy Spirit had a mouth and wisdom which none of their adversaries  were able to resist or gainsay. The antichrists of our day can not be met  successfully without reason, without argument, without meeting the  intellectual demands of the times.    There are intellectual men and women in almost every community throughout  our country--men and women with whom intelligence governs--who want the whys  and wherefores upon every subject. This class is on the increase at a  rapid rate. It does no good to set ourselves against reason, and oppose  the current of thought with our emotional nature. In that way we may  succeed with those who are governed by their emotional nature, but the  work, when it is done, is a work upon the passions, and will soon pass  away, unless the intellect was at the same time enlisted. The men who stir  the world with thought, and give intellectual cast to the age in which we  live, are to be met with thought, met with reason, met with truths tried  in the crucible.    Christianity has nothing"]]]
