But  you know the whole outside was spoiled centuries ago: as to the inside,  that remains in its beauty after the great clearance, which took place  over a hundred years ago, of the beastly monuments to fools and knaves,  which once blocked it up, as great-grandfather says.\"    We went on a little further, and I looked to the right again, and said,  in rather a doubtful tone of voice, \"Why, there are the Houses of  Parliament!  Do you still use them?\"    He burst out laughing, and was some time before he could control himself;  then he clapped me on the back and said:    \"I take you, neighbour; you may well wonder at our keeping them standing,  and I know something about that, and my old kinsman has given me books to  read about the strange game that they played there.  Use them!  Well,  yes, they are used for a sort of subsidiary market, and a storage place  for manure, and they are handy for that, being on the waterside.  I  believe it was intended to pull them down quite at the beginning of our  days; but there was, I am told, a queer antiquarian society, which had  done some service in past times, and which straightway set up its pipe  against their destruction, as it has done with many other buildings,  which most people looked upon as worthless, and public nuisances; and it  was so energetic, and had such good reasons to give, that it generally  gained its point; and I must say that when all is said I am glad of it:  because you know at the worst these silly old buildings serve as a kind  of foil to the beautiful ones which we build now.  You will see several  others in these parts; the place my great-grandfather lives in, for  instance, and a big building called St. Paul's.  And you see, in this  matter we need not grudge a few poorish buildings standing, because we  can always build elsewhere; nor need we be anxious as to the breeding of  pleasant work in such matters, for there is always room for more and more  work in a new building, even without making it pretentious.  For  instance, elbow-room _within_ doors is to me so delightful that if I were  driven to it I would most sacrifice outdoor space to it.  Then, of  course, there is the ornament, which, as we must all allow, may easily be  overdone in mere living houses, but can hardly be in mote-halls and  markets, and so forth.  I must tell you, though, that my  great-grandfather sometimes tells me I am a little cracked on this  subject of fine building; and indeed I _do_ think that the energies of  mankind are chiefly of use to them for such work; for in that direction I  can see no end to the work, while in many others a limit does seem  possible.\"          CHAPTER VI: A LITTLE SHOPPING      As he spoke, we came suddenly out of the woodland into a short street of  handsomely built houses, which my companion named to me at once as  Piccadilly: the lower part of these I should have called shops, if it had  not been that, as far as I could see, the people were ignorant of the  arts of buying and selling.  Wares were displayed in their finely  designed fronts, as if to tempt people in, and people stood and looked at  them, or went in and came out with parcels under their arms, just like  the real thing.  On each side of the street ran an elegant arcade to  protect foot-passengers, as in some of the old Italian cities.  About  halfway down, a huge building of the kind I was now prepared to expect  told me that this also was a centre of some kind, and had its special  public buildings.    Said Dick: \"Here, you see, is another market on a different plan from  most others: the upper stories of these houses are used for guest-houses;  for people from all about the country are apt to drift up hither from  time to time, as folk are very thick upon the ground, which you will see  evidence of presently, and there are people who are fond of crowds,  though I can't say that I am.\"    I couldn't help smiling to see how long a tradition would last.  Here was  the ghost of London still asserting itself as a centre,--an intellectual  centre, for aught I knew.  However, I said nothing, except that I asked  him to drive very slowly, as the things in the booths looked exceedingly  pretty.    \"Yes,\" said he, \"this is a very good market for pretty things, and is  mostly kept for the handsomer goods, as the Houses-of-Parliament market,  where they set out cabbages and turnips and such like things, along with  beer and the rougher kind of wine, is so near.\"    Then he looked at me curiously, and said, \"Perhaps you would like to do a  little shopping, as 'tis called.\"    I looked at what I could see of my rough blue duds, which I had plenty of  opportunity of contrasting with the gay attire of the citizens we had  come across; and I thought that if, as seemed likely, I should presently  be shown about as a curiosity for the amusement of this most  unbusinesslike people, I should like to look a little less like a  discharged ship's purser.  But in spite of all that had happened, my hand  went down into my pocket again, where to my dismay it met nothing  metallic except two rusty old keys, and I remembered that amidst our talk  in the guest-hall at Hammersmith I had taken the cash out of my pocket to  show to the pretty Annie, and had left it lying there.  My face fell  fifty per cent., and Dick, beholding me, said rather sharply--    \"Hilloa, Guest! what's the matter now?  Is it a wasp?\"    \"No,\" said I, \"but I've left it behind.\"    \"Well,\" said he, \"whatever you have left behind, you can get in this  market again, so don't trouble yourself about it.\"    I had come to my senses by this time, and remembering the astounding  customs of this country, had no mind for another lecture on social  economy and the Edwardian coinage; so I said only--    \"My clothes--Couldn't I?  You see--What do think could be done about  them?\"    He didn't seem in the least inclined to laugh, but said quite gravely:    \"O don't get new clothes yet.  You see, my great-grandfather is an  antiquarian, and he will want to see you just as you are.  And, you know,  I mustn't preach to you, but surely it wouldn't be right for you to take  away people's pleasure of studying your attire, by just going and making  yourself like everybody else.  You feel that, don't you?\" said he,  earnestly.    I did _not_ feel it my duty to set myself up for a scarecrow amidst this  beauty-loving people, but I saw I had got across some ineradicable  prejudice, and that it wouldn't do to quarrel with my new friend.  So I  merely said, \"O certainly, certainly.\"    \"Well,\" said he, pleasantly, \"you may as well see what the inside of  these booths is like: think of something you want.\"    Said I: \"Could I get some tobacco and a pipe?\"    \"Of course,\" said he; \"what was I thinking of, not asking you before?  Well, Bob is always telling me that we non-smokers are a selfish lot, and  I'm afraid he is right.  But come along; here is a place just handy.\"    Therewith he drew rein and jumped down, and I followed.  A very handsome  woman, splendidly clad in figured silk, was slowly passing by, looking  into the windows as she went.  To her quoth Dick: \"Maiden, would you  kindly hold our horse while we go in for a little?\"  She nodded to us  with a kind smile, and fell to patting the horse with her pretty hand.    \"What a beautiful creature!\" said I to Dick as we entered.    \"What, old Greylocks?\" said he, with a sly grin.    \"No, no,\" said I; \"Goldylocks,--the lady.\"    \"Well, so she is,\" said he.  \"'Tis a good job there are so many of them  that every Jack may have his Jill: else I fear that we should get  fighting for them.  Indeed,\" said he, becoming very grave, \"I don't say  that it does not happen even now, sometimes.  For you know love is not a  very reasonable thing, and perversity and self-will are commoner than  some of our moralists think.\"  He added, in a still more sombre tone:  \"Yes, only a month ago there was a mishap down by us, that in the end  cost the lives of two men and a woman, and, as it were, put out the  sunlight for us for a while.  Don't ask me about it just now; I may tell  you about it later on.\"    By this time we were within the shop or booth, which had a counter, and  shelves on the walls, all very neat, though without any pretence of  showiness, but otherwise not very different to what I had been used to.  Within were a couple of children--a brown-skinned boy of about twelve,  who sat reading a book, and a pretty little girl of about a year older,  who was sitting also reading behind the counter; they were obviously  brother and sister.    \"Good morning, little neighbours,\" said Dick.  \"My friend here wants  tobacco and a pipe; can you help him?\"    \"O yes, certainly,\" said the girl with a sort of demure alertness which  was somewhat amusing.  The boy looked up, and fell to staring at my  outlandish attire, but presently reddened and turned his head, as if he  knew that he was not behaving prettily.    \"Dear neighbour,\" said the girl, with the most solemn countenance of a  child playing at keeping shop, \"what tobacco is it you would like?\"    \"Latakia,\" quoth I, feeling as if I were assisting at a child's game, and  wondering whether I should get anything but make-believe.    But the girl took a dainty little basket from a shelf beside her, went to  a jar, and took out a lot of tobacco and put the filled basket down on  the counter before me, where I could both smell and see that it was  excellent Latakia.    \"But you haven't weighed it,\" said I, \"and--and how much am I to take?\"    \"Why,\" she said, \"I advise you to cram your bag, because you may be going  where you can't get Latakia.  Where is your "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32664"],[0,"Black Amazon of Mars (#7)"],[1,"\" Balin said, and again they waited.    The westering stars moved toward the horizon, and at length in the east  a dim pallor crept across the sky.    The plain was still shrouded in night, but now Stark could make out the  high towers of the King City of Kushat, ghostly and indistinct--the  ancient, proud high towers of the rulers and their nobles, set above the  crowded Quarters of merchants and artisans and thieves. He wondered who  would be king in Kushat by the time this unrisen sun had set.    \"You were wrong,\" said Balin, peering. \"There is nothing on the plain.\"    Stark said, \"Wait.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Swiftly now, in the thin air of Mars, the dawn came with a rush and a  leap, flooding the world with harsh light. It flashed in cruel  brilliance from sword-blades, from spearheads, from helmets and  burnished mail, from the war-harness of beasts, glistened on bare russet  heads and coats of leather, set the banners of the clans to burning,  crimson and gold and green, bright against the snow.    There was no sound, not a whisper, in all the land.    Somewhere a hunting horn sent forth one deep cry to split the morning.  Then burst out the wild skirling of the mountain pipes and the broken  thunder of drums, and a wordless scream of exultation that rang back  from the Wall of Kushat like the very voice of battle. The men of Mekh  began to move.    Raggedly, slowly at first, then more swiftly as the press of warriors  broke and flowed, the barbarians swept toward the city as water sweeps  over a broken dam.    Knots and clumps of men, tall men running like deer, leaping, shouting,  swinging their great brands. Riders, spurring their mounts until they  fled belly down. Spears, axes, sword-blades tossing, a sea of men and  beasts, rushing, trampling, shaking the ground with the thunder of their  going.    And ahead of them all came a solitary figure in black mail, riding a  raking beast trapped all in black, and bearing a sable axe.    Kushat came to life. There was a swarming and a yelling in the streets,  and soldiers began to pour up onto the Wall. A thin company, Stark  thought, and shook his head. Mobs of citizens choked the alleys, and  every rooftop was full. A troop of nobles went by, brave in their bright  mail, to take up their post in the square by the great gate.    Balin said nothing, and Stark did not disturb his thoughts. From the  look of him, they were dark indeed.    Soldiers came and ordered them off the Wall. They went back to their  own roof, where they were joined by Thanis. She was in a high state of  excitement, but unafraid.    \"Let them attack!\" she said. \"Let them break their spears against the  Wall. They will crawl away again.\"    Stark began to grow restless. Up in their high emplacements, the big  ballistas creaked and thrummed. The muted song of the bows became a  wailing hum. Men fell, and were kicked off the ledges by their fellows.  The blood-howl of the clans rang unceasing on the frosty air, and Stark  heard the rap of scaling ladders against stone.    Thanis said abruptly, \"What is that--that sound like thunder?\"    \"Rams,\" he answered. \"They are battering the gate.\"    She listened, and Stark saw in her face the beginning of fear.    It was a long fight. Stark watched it hungrily from the roof all that  morning. The soldiers of Kushat did bravely and well, but they were as  folded sheep against the tall killers of the mountains. By noon the  officers were beating the Quarters for men to replace the slain.    Stark and Balin went up again, onto the Wall.    The clans had suffered. Their dead lay in windrows under the Wall, amid  the broken ladders. But Stark knew his barbarians. They had sat restless  and chafing in the valley for many days, and now the battle-madness was  on them and they were not going to be stopped.    Wave after wave of them rolled up, and was cast back, and came on again  relentlessly. The intermittent thunder boomed still from the gates,  where sweating giants swung the rams under cover of their own bowmen.  And everywhere, up and down through the forefront of the fighting, rode  the man in black armor, and wild cheering followed him.    Balin said heavily, \"It is the end of Kushat.\"           *       *       *       *       *    A ladder banged against the stones a few feet away. Men swarmed up the  rungs, fierce-eyed clansmen with laughter in their mouths. Stark was  first at the head.    They had given him a spear. He spitted two men through with it and lost  it, and a third man came leaping over the parapet. Stark received him  into his arms.    Balin watched. He saw the warrior go crashing back, sweeping his fellows  off the ladder. He saw Stark's face. He heard the sounds and smelled the  blood and sweat of war, and he was sick to the marrow of his bones, and  his hatred of the barbarians was a terrible thing.    Stark caught up a dead man's blade, and within ten minutes his arm was  as red as a butcher's. And ever he watched the winged helm that went  back and forth below, a standard to the clans.    By mid-afternoon the barbarians had gained the Wall in three places.  They spread inward along the ledges, pouring up in a resistless tide,  and the defenders broke. The rout became a panic.    \"It's all over now,\" Stark said. \"Find Thanis, and hide her.\"    Balin let fall his sword. \"Give me the talisman,\" he whispered, and  Stark saw that he was weeping. \"Give it me, and I will go beyond the  Gates of Death and rouse Ban Cruach from his sleep. And if he has  forgotten Kushat, I will take his power into my own hands. I will fling  wide the Gates of Death and loose destruction on the men of Mekh--or if  the legends are all lies, then I will die.\"    He was like a man crazed. \"Give me the talisman!\"    Stark slapped him, carefully and without heat, across the face. \"Get  your sister, Balin. Hide her, unless you would be uncle to a red-haired  brat.\"    He went then, like a man who has been stunned. Screaming women with  their children clogged the ways that led inward from the Wall, and there  was bloody work afoot on the rooftops and in the narrow alleys.    The gate was holding, still.           *       *       *       *       *    Stark forced his way toward the square. The booths of the hucksters were  overthrown, the wine-jars broken and the red wine spilled. Beasts  squealed and stamped, tired of their chafing harness, driven wild by the  shouting and the smell of blood. The dead were heaped high where they  had fallen from above.    They were all soldiers here, clinging grimly to their last foothold. The  deep song of the rams shook the very stones. The iron-sheathed timbers  of the gate gave back an answering scream, and toward the end all other  sounds grew hushed. The nobles came down slowly from the Wall and  mounted, and sat waiting.    There were fewer of them now. Their bright armor was dented and stained,  and their faces had a pallor on them.    One last hammer-stroke of the rams.    With a bitter shriek the weakened bolts tore out, and the great gate was  broken through.    The nobles of Kushat made their first, and final charge.    As soldiers they went up against the riders of Mekh, and as soldiers  they held them until they died. Those that were left were borne back  into the square, caught as in the crest of an avalanche. And first  through the gates came the winged battle-mask of the Lord Ciaran, and  the sable axe that drank men's lives where it hewed.    There was a beast with no rider to claim it, tugging at its headrope.  Stark swung onto the saddle pad and cut it free. Where the press was  thickest, a welter of struggling brutes and men fighting knee to knee,  there was the man in black armor, riding like a god, magnificent, born  to war. Stark's eyes shone with a strange, cold light. He struck his  heels hard into the scaly flanks. The beast plunged forward.    In and over and through, making the long sword sing. The beast was  strong, and frightened beyond fear. It bit and trampled, and Stark cut a  path for them, and presently he shouted above the din,    \"Ho, there! _Ciaran!_\"    The black mask turned toward him, and the remembered voice spoke from  behind the barred slot, joyously.    \"The wanderer. The wild man!\"    Their two mounts shocked together. The axe came down in a whistling  curve, and a red sword-blade flashed to meet it. Swift, swift, a ringing  clash of steel, and the blade was shattered and the axe fallen to the  ground.    Stark pressed in.    Ciaran reached for his sword, but his hand was numbed by the force of  that blow and he was slow, a split second. The hilt of Stark's weapon,  still clutched in his own numbed grip, fetched him a stunning blow on  the helm, so that the metal rang like a flawed bell.    The Lord Ciaran reeled back, only for a moment, but long enough. Stark  grasped the war-mask and ripped it off, and got his hands around the  naked throat.    He did not break that neck, as he had planned. And the Clansmen who had  started in to save their leader stopped and did not move.    Stark knew now why the Lord Ciaran had never shown his face.    The throat he held was white and strong, and his hands around it were  buried in a mane of red-gold hair that fell down over the shirt of mail.  A red mouth passionate with fury, wonderful curving bone under  sculptured flesh, eyes fierce and proud and tameless as the eyes of a  young eagle, fire-blue, defying him, hating him....    \"By the gods,\" said Stark, very softly. \"By the eternal gods!\"          VI    A woman! And in that moment of amazement, she was quicker than he.    There was nothing to warn him, no least flicker of expression. Her two  fists came up together between his outstretched arms and caught him  under the jaw with a force that nearly snapped his neck. He went over  backward, clean out of the saddle, and lay sprawled on the bloody  stones, half stunned, the wind knocked out of him.    The woman"]]]
