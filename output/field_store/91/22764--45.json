Kindly lead me into the water  once again and I'll practice that side-stroke which you say is so easy.'  And so Stickly-Prickly practiced, and Slow-Solid swam alongside.    'Excellent!' said Slow-and-Solid. 'A little more practice will make you  a regular whale. Now, if I may trouble you to unlace my back and front  plates two holes more, I'll try that fascinating bend that you say is so  easy. Won't Painted Jaguar be surprised!'    'Excellent!' said Stickly-Prickly, all wet from the turbid Amazon. 'I  declare, I shouldn't know you from one of my own family. Two holes, I  think, you said? A little more expression, please, and don't grunt quite  so much, or Painted Jaguar may hear us. When you've finished, I want  to try that long dive which you say is so easy. Won't Painted Jaguar be  surprised!'    And so Stickly-Prickly dived, and Slow-and-Solid dived alongside.    'Excellent!' said Slow-and-Solid. 'A leetle more attention to holding  your breath and you will be able to keep house at the bottom of the  turbid Amazon. Now I'll try that exercise of putting my hind legs round  my ears which you say is so peculiarly comfortable. Won't Painted Jaguar  be surprised!'    'Excellent!' said Stickly-Prickly. 'But it's straining your back-plates  a little. They are all overlapping now, instead of lying side by side.'    'Oh, that's the result of exercise,' said Slow-and-Solid. 'I've noticed  that your prickles seem to be melting into one another, and that  you're growing to look rather more like a pinecone, and less like a  chestnut-burr, than you used to.'    'Am I?' said Stickly-Prickly. 'That comes from my soaking in the water.  Oh, won't Painted Jaguar be surprised!'    They went on with their exercises, each helping the other, till morning  came; and when the sun was high they rested and dried themselves. Then  they saw that they were both of them quite different from what they had  been.    'Stickly-Prickly,' said Tortoise after breakfast, 'I am not what I was  yesterday; but I think that I may yet amuse Painted Jaguar.    'That was the very thing I was thinking just now,' said Stickly-Prickly.  'I think scales are a tremendous improvement on prickles--to say nothing  of being able to swim. Oh, won't Painted Jaguar be surprised! Let's go  and find him.'    By and by they found Painted Jaguar, still nursing his paddy-paw that  had been hurt the night before. He was so astonished that he fell three  times backward over his own painted tail without stopping.    'Good morning!' said Stickly-Prickly. 'And how is your dear gracious  Mummy this morning?'    'She is quite well, thank you,' said Painted Jaguar; 'but you must  forgive me if I do not at this precise moment recall your name.'    'That's unkind of you,' said Stickly-Prickly, 'seeing that this time  yesterday you tried to scoop me out of my shell with your paw.'    'But you hadn't any shell. It was all prickles,' said Painted Jaguar. 'I  know it was. Just look at my paw!'    'You told me to drop into the turbid Amazon and be drowned,' said  Slow-Solid. 'Why are you so rude and forgetful to-day?'    'Don't you remember what your mother told you?' said Stickly-Prickly,--      'Can't curl, but can swim--    Stickly-Prickly, that's him!    Curls up, but can't swim--    Slow-Solid, that's him!'    Then they both curled themselves up and rolled round and round Painted  Jaguar till his eyes turned truly cart-wheels in his head.    Then he went to fetch his mother.    'Mother,' he said, 'there are two new animals in the woods to-day, and  the one that you said couldn't swim, swims, and the one that you said  couldn't curl up, curls; and they've gone shares in their prickles, I  think, because both of them are scaly all over, instead of one being  smooth and the other very prickly; and, besides that, they are rolling  round and round in circles, and I don't feel comfy.'    'Son, son!' said Mother Jaguar ever so many times, graciously waving her  tail, 'a Hedgehog is a Hedgehog, and can't be anything but a Hedgehog;  and a Tortoise is a Tortoise, and can never be anything else.'    'But it isn't a Hedgehog, and it isn't a Tortoise. It's a little bit of  both, and I don't know its proper name.'    'Nonsense!' said Mother Jaguar. 'Everything has its proper name. I  should call it \"Armadillo\" till I found out the real one. And I should  leave it alone.'    So Painted Jaguar did as he was told, especially about leaving them  alone; but the curious thing is that from that day to this, O Best  Beloved, no one on the banks of the turbid Amazon has ever called  Stickly-Prickly and Slow-Solid anything except Armadillo. There are  Hedgehogs and Tortoises in other places, of course (there are some in  my garden); but the real old and clever kind, with their scales lying  lippety-lappety one over the other, like pine-cone scales, that lived on  the banks of the turbid Amazon in the High and Far-Off Days, are always  called Armadillos, because they were so clever.    So that; all right, Best Beloved. Do you see?         I'VE never sailed the Amazon,         I've never reached Brazil;       But the Don and Magdelana,         They can go there when they will!                 Yes, weekly from Southampton,               Great steamers, white and gold,               Go rolling down to Rio               (Roll down--roll down to Rio!)               And I'd like to roll to Rio               Some day before I'm old!         I've never seen a Jaguar,         Nor yet an Armadill       O dilloing in his armour,         And I s'pose I never will,                 Unless I go to Rio               These wonders to behold--               Roll down--roll down to Rio--               Roll really down to Rio!               Oh, I'd love to roll to Rio               Some day before I'm old!          HOW THE FIRST LETTER WAS WRITTEN    ONCE upon a most early time was a Neolithic man. He was not a Jute or an  Angle, or even a Dravidian, which he might well have been, Best Beloved,  but never mind why. He was a Primitive, and he lived cavily in a Cave,  and he wore very few clothes, and he couldn't read and he couldn't write  and he didn't want to, and except when he was hungry he was  quite happy. His name was Tegumai Bopsulai, and that means,  'Man-who-does-not-put-his-foot-forward-in-a-hurry'; but we, O Best  Beloved, will call him Tegumai, for short. And his wife's name  was Teshumai Tewindrow, and that means,  'Lady-who-asks-a-very-many-questions'; but we, O Best Beloved, will  call her Teshumai, for short. And his little girl-daughter's name  was Taffimai Metallumai, and that means,  'Small-person-without-any-manners-who-ought-to-be-spanked'; but I'm  going to call her Taffy. And she was Tegumai Bopsulai's Best Beloved and  her own Mummy's Best Beloved, and she was not spanked half as much as  was good for her; and they were all three very happy. As soon as  Taffy could run about she went everywhere with her Daddy Tegumai, and  sometimes they would not come home to the Cave till they were hungry,  and then Teshumai Tewindrow would say, 'Where in the world have you two  been to, to get so shocking dirty? Really, my Tegumai, you're no better  than my Taffy.'    Now attend and listen!    One day Tegumai Bopsulai went down through the beaver-swamp to the Wagai  river to spear carp-fish for dinner, and Taffy went too. Tegumai's spear  was made of wood with shark's teeth at the end, and before he had caught  any fish at all he accidentally broke it clean across by jabbing it down  too hard on the bottom of the river. They were miles and miles from home  (of course they had their lunch with them in a little bag), and Tegumai  had forgotten to bring any extra spears.    'Here's a pretty kettle of fish!' said Tegumai. 'It will take me half  the day to mend this.'    'There's your big black spear at home,' said Taffy. 'Let me run back to  the Cave and ask Mummy to give it me.'    'It's too far for your little fat legs,' said Tegumai. 'Besides, you  might fall into the beaver-swamp and be drowned. We must make the best  of a bad job.' He sat down and took out a little leather mendy-bag, full  of reindeer-sinews and strips of leather, and lumps of bee's-wax and  resin, and began to mend the spear.    Taffy sat down too, with her toes in the water and her chin in her  hand, and thought very hard. Then she said--'I say, Daddy, it's an awful  nuisance that you and I don't know how to write, isn't it? If we did we  could send a message for the new spear.'    'Taffy,' said Tegumai, 'how often have I told you not to use slang?  \"Awful\" isn't a pretty word, but it could be a convenience, now you  mention it, if we could write home.'    Just then a Stranger-man came along the river, but he belonged to a  far tribe, the Tewaras, and he did not understand one word of Tegumai's  language. He stood on the bank and smiled at Taffy, because he had  a little girl-daughter Of his own at home. Tegumai drew a hank of  deer-sinews from his mendy-bag and began to mend his spear.    'Come here, said Taffy. 'Do you know where my Mummy lives?' And the  Stranger-man said 'Um!' being, as you know, a Tewara.    'Silly!' said Taffy, and she stamped her foot, because she saw a shoal  of very big carp going up the river just when her Daddy couldn't use his  spear.    'Don't bother grown-ups,' said Tegumai, so busy with his spear-mending  that he did not turn round.    'I aren't, said Taffy. 'I only want him to do what I want him to do, and  he won't understand.'    'Then don't bother me, said Tegumai, and he went on pulling and  straining at the deer-sinews with his mouth full of loose ends. The  Stranger-man--a genuine Tewara he was--sat down on the grass, and Taffy  showed him what her Daddy was doing. The Stranger-man thought, this is a  very wonderful child. She stamps her foot at me and she makes faces. She  must be the daughter of that noble Chief who is so great "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27827"],[0,"The Kama Sutra of Vatsyayana (#7)"],[1,"    his wives.    Or thus:--         (_j_). By the help of this woman I shall kill an enemy of the king,                who has taken shelter with her, and whom I am ordered by                the king to destroy.    Or thus:         (_k_). The woman whom I love is under the control of this woman. I                shall, through the influence of the latter, be able to get                at the former.    Or thus:--         (_l_). This woman will bring to me a maid, who possesses wealth and                beauty, but who is hard to get at, and under the control                of another.    Or, lastly, thus:--         (_m_). My enemy is a friend of this woman's husband, I shall                therefore cause her to join him, and will thus create an                enmity between her husband and him.    For these and similar other reasons the wives of other men may be  resorted to, but it must be distinctly understood that is only allowed  for special reasons, and not for mere carnal desire.    Charayana thinks that under these circumstances there is also a fifth  kind of Nayika, viz., a woman who is kept by a minister, and who repairs  to him occasionally; or a widow who accomplishes the purpose of a man  with the person to whom she resorts.    Suvarnanabha adds that a woman who passes the life of an ascetic and in  the condition of a widow may be considered as a sixth kind of Nayika.    Ghotakamukha says that the daughter of a public woman, and a female  servant, who are still virgins, form a seventh kind of Nayika.    Gonardiya puts forth his doctrine that any woman born of good family,  after she has come of age, is an eighth kind of Nayika.    But these four latter kinds of Nayikas do not differ much from the first  four kinds of them, as there is no separate object in resorting to  them. Therefore Vatsyayana is of opinion that there are only four kinds  of Nayikas, _i.e._, the maid, the twice married woman, the public woman,  and the woman resorted to for a special purpose.    The following women are not to be enjoyed:--    A leper.    A lunatic.    A woman turned out of caste.    A woman who reveals secrets.    A woman who publicly expresses desire for sexual intercourse.    A woman who is extremely white.    A woman who is extremely black.    A bad-smelling woman.    A woman who is a near relation.    A woman who is a female friend.    A woman who leads the life of an ascetic.    And, lastly, the wife of a relation, of a friend, of a learned Brahman,  and of the king.    The followers of Babhravya say that any woman who has been enjoyed by  five men is a fit and proper person to be enjoyed. But Gonikaputra is of  opinion that even when this is the case, the wives of a relation, of a  learned Brahman and of a king should be excepted.    The following are the kind of friends:--    One who has played with you in the dust, _i.e._, in childhood.    One who is bound by an obligation.    One who is of the same disposition and fond of the same things.    One who is a fellow student.    One who is acquainted with your secrets and faults, and whose faults and  secrets are also known to you.    One who is a child of your nurse.    One who is brought up with you.    One who is an hereditary friend.    These friends should possess the following qualities:--    They should tell the truth.    They should not be changed by time.    They should be favourable to your designs.    They should be firm.    They should be free from covetousness.    They should not be capable of being gained over by others.    They should not reveal your secrets.    Charayana says that citizens form friendship with washermen, barbers,  cowherds, florists, druggists, betel-leaf sellers, tavern keepers,  beggars, Pithamardas, Vitas and Vidushekas, as also with the wives of  all these people.    A messenger should possess the following qualities:--    Skilfulness.    Boldness.    Knowledge of the intention of men by their outward signs.    Absence of confusion, _i.e._, no shyness.    Knowledge of the exact meaning of what others do or say.    Good manners.    Knowledge of appropriate times and places for doing different things.    Ingenuity in business.    Quick comprehension.    Quick application of remedies, _i.e._, quick and ready resources.    And this part ends with a verse:--    The man who is ingenious and wise, who is accompanied by a friend, and  who knows the intentions of others, as also the proper time and place  for doing everything, can gain over, very easily, even a woman who is  very hard to be obtained.    FOOTNOTES:    [Footnote 31: This term does not apply to a widow, but to a woman who  had probably left her husband, and is living with some other person as a  married woman, maritalement, as they say in France.]    [Footnote 32: Any woman fit to be enjoyed without sin. The object of the  enjoyment of women is twofold, viz., pleasure and progeny. Any woman who  can be enjoyed without sin for the purpose of accomplishing either the  one or the other of these two objects is a Nayika. The fourth kind of  Nayika which Vatsya admits further on is neither enjoyed for pleasure or  for progeny, but merely for accomplishing some special purpose in hand.  The word Nayika is retained as a technical term throughout.]    =END OF PART I.=          PART II.    OF SEXUAL UNION.          CHAPTER I.    KINDS OF SEXUAL UNION ACCORDING TO         (_a_) DIMENSIONS.       (_b_) FORCE OF DESIRE OR PASSION.       (_c_) TIME.    _Kinds of Union._    Man is divided into three classes, viz., the hare man, the bull man, and  the horse man, according to the size of his lingam.    Woman also, according to the depth of her yoni, is either a female deer,  a mare, or a female elephant.    There are thus three equal unions between persons of corresponding  dimensions, and there are six unequal unions, when the dimensions do not  correspond, or nine in all, as the following table shows:       +--------------------+--------------------+     |      EQUAL.        |      UNEQUAL.      |     +--------------------+--------------------+     |  MEN.  |   WOMEN.  |  MEN.  | WOMEN.    |     +--------+-----------+--------|-----------+     |        |           |        |           |     | Hare.  | Deer.     | Hare.  | Mare.     |     | Bull.  | Mare.     | Hare.  | Elephant. |     | Horse. | Elephant. | Bull.  | Deer.     |     |        |           | Bull.  | Elephant. |     |        |           | Horse. | Deer.     |     |        |           | Horse. | Mare.     |     +--------+-----------+--------+-----------+    In these unequal unions, when the male exceeds the female in point of  size, his union with a woman who is immediately next to him in size is  called high union, and is of two kinds; while his union with the woman  most remote from him in size is called the highest union, and is of one  kind only. On the other hand when the female exceeds the male in point  of size, her union with a man immediately next to her in size is called  low union, and is of two kinds; while her union with a man most remote  from her in size is called the lowest union, and is of one kind only.    In other words, the horse and mare, the bull and deer, form the high  union, while the horse and deer form the highest union. On the female  side, the elephant and bull, the mare and hare, form low unions, while  the elephant and the hare make the lowest unions.    There are then, nine kinds of union according to dimensions. Amongst all  these, equal unions are the best, those of a superlative degree, _i.e._,  the highest and the lowest, are the worst, and the rest are middling,  and with them the high[33] are better than the low.    There are also nine kinds of union according to the force of passion or  carnal desire, as follows:       +-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+     |    MEN.   |   WOMEN.  |    MEN.   |   WOMEN.  |     +-----------+-----------+-----------|-----------+     |           |           |           |           |     | Small.    | Small.    | Small.    | Middling. |     | Middling. | Middling. | Small.    | Intense.  |     | Intense.  | Intense.  | Middling. | Small.    |     |           |           | Middling. | Intense.  |     |           |           | Intense.  | Small.    |     |           |           | Intense.  | Middling. |     +-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+    A man is called a man of small passion whose desire at the time of  sexual union is not great, whose semen is scanty, and who cannot bear  the warm embraces of the female.    Those who differ from this temperament are called men of middling  passion, while those of intense passion are full of desire.    In the same way, women are supposed to have the three degrees of feeling  as specified above.    Lastly, according to time there are three kinds of men and women, viz.,  the short-timed, the moderate-timed, and the long-timed, and of these as  in the previous statements, there are nine kinds of union.    But on this last head there is a difference of opinion about the female,  which should be stated.    Auddalika says, \"Females do not emit as males do. The males simply  remove their desire, while the females, from their consciousness of  desire, feel a certain kind of pleasure, which gives them satisfaction,  but it is impossible for them to tell you what kind of pleasure they  feel. The fact from which this becomes evident is, that males, when  engaged in coition, cease of themselves after emission, and are  satisfied, but it is not so with females.\"    This opinion is, however, objected to on the grounds that if a male be a  long-timed, the female loves him the more, but if he be short-timed, she  is dissatisfied with him. And this circumstance, some say, would prove  that the female emits also.    But this opinion does not hold good, for if it takes a long time to  allay a woman's desire, and during this time she is enjoying great  pleasure, it is quite natural then that she should "]]]
