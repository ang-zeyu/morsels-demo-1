Coming out of the Red Sea by Babelmendel, which is in the straits,  as has been said, towards the open sea, further on the coast there  are several towns of Moors, which all belong to the kingdom of Aden,  and having passed these villages you arrive at the town of Aden,  which belongs to the Moors, and has a king over it. It is a very  handsome city, with very large and fine houses, and a place of much  trade, with good streets, and surrounded with a strong wall in their  fashion. This city is on a point between a mountain and the sea; and  this mountain ridge on the side of the main land is a precipitous  rock, in such manner that on that side it has no more than one  entrance, and on the top of this ridge, where the town is, there are  many small towers, which look very pretty from the sea. Inside the  city there is no water at all, and outside of the gate towards the  main land there is a building to which they make water come in pipes  from another mountain at some little distance from there, and  between one ridge and the other ridge there was a great plain. In  this city there are great Moorish merchants, and many Jews.[53] They  are white men, a few of them black, they dress in cloth of cotton,  silk, scarlet wool, and camelots. Their clothes are long robes, and  they wear caps on their heads, and with low shoes on their feet.  Their victuals are plenty of meat, wheaten bread, and rice which  comes from India: there is plenty of fruit as in our parts, and  there are in this place many horses and camels. The king is always  in the interior of the country, and he maintains his governor in  this city. Many ships, great and small, come there from many parts;  that is to say, from Jiddah, whence they bring them much copper and  quicksilver, and vermillion, coral, cloths of wool and silk. And  they take from here in return spices, drugs, cotton cloths, and  other things from Cambay, with provisions and other goods. Many  ships also touch there from Zeyla and Berbera with provisions and  other goods, and carry away from there stuffs from Cambay,  alaquequas,[54] and large and small beads perforated for stringing,  with which they trade in Arabia Felix, and in the country of Prester  John. Some ships from Ormuz likewise touch there to trade, and also  from Cambay, whence they bring much cotton stuff, spices, drugs,  jewels and pearls, alaquequas, spun cotton, and unspun; and they  take from these madder, opium, raisins, copper, quicksilver,  vermillion, rose-water which they make there, woollen and silk  stuffs, coloured stuffs from Mecca, and gold in ingots or coined,  and thread and camelots. And these ships of Cambay are so many and  so large, and with so much merchandise, that it is a terrible thing  to think of so great an expenditure of cotton stuffs as they bring.  There come likewise to this port of Aden many ships from Chaul and  Dabul, and from Bengal and the country of Calicut; they used to come  there with the before-mentioned goods and with a large quantity of  rice and sugar, and cocoa-nuts which grow on the palm trees, and  which are like nuts in flavour, and with the kernels[55] they make  drinking cups. There also arrive there ships from Bengal, Samatra,  and Malaca, which bring much spices and drugs, silks, benzoin,  alacar,[56] sandal-wood, aloes-wood, rhubarb, musk, and much cotton  stuffs from Bengal and Mangala,[57] so that it is a place of as much  trade as there can be in the world, and of the richest merchandise.  The fleet and armament of the King of Portugal came to this city,  and took and burned in its harbour several ships laden with much  merchandise, and several empty ships, and it made an assault to  enter the town, and mounted the walls with scaling ladders, which  broke with the weight of the many people on them; so that the  Portuguese went out again, and abandoned the town: and at this entry  the Moors defended themselves very vigorously, and many of them  died, and some of the Christians.      KINGDOM OF FARTACH.    Having passed the said kingdom of Aden, going out of the strait  towards the East, there is another kingdom of the Moors about  twenty-five leagues off, near the sea, it has three or four towns on  the coast, and they are called Xebech, Diufar,[58] and Fartach.[59]  These Moors have got a king over them and are very good fighting  men: they have got horses which they make use of in war, and good  arms with short blades; the said king is subject to the King of Aden  and is his servant.      CAPE FARTACH AND THE ISLAND OF SACOTORA.    In this country and kingdom there is a cape which is called Cape  Fartach, where the coast turns and makes a bend towards the said sea  between north-east and east,[60] and between this cape and that of  Guardafun, is the mouth of the strait of Mecca, which runs  north-west and south-east,[61] and it is xl leagues in width, where  all the ships pass for those voyages and to the Red Sea. Above Cape  Guardafun, to the north-east by east, twenty-seven leagues off, is  an island called Sacotora, with very high mountains, it is inhabited  by dusky people, who are said to be Christians; but they are  deficient in the teaching of the Christian law and baptism, and have  got only the name of Christians: they have in their chapels crosses,  +.[62] It was in former times a country of Christians, and the  Christian doctrine was lost there on account of Christian navigation  having ceased there; and the Moors say that this was an island of  Amazons, who later in the course of time mixed with men, and  something of this appears to be the case, since there the women  administer property and manage it, without the husbands having a  voice in the matter. These people have a language of their own; they  go without clothes, and only cover their nakedness with cotton  cloths and skins: they have many cows and sheep, and date palms.  Their victuals are meat, milk, and dates. In this island there is  much dragon's blood[63] and aloes of Socotra. And the Moors of  Fartach built in it a fortress, to subjugate them, and turn them  Moors; and some of those that lived around the fortress were Moors,  and served the Moors of the fort like their slaves, both in their  persons and property. A fleet of the King of Portugal arrived at  this island, and took this fortress by force of arms from the Moors  of Fartach, fighting with them: and they defended themselves much  more vigorously than any men of these parts; so that they never  would give themselves up, and all died in the fight, for none of  them escaped; so that they are very good and daring fighting men.  The Captain of this fleet left troops and artillery in this fortress  in order to keep it in the name of the King of Portugal. And quite  near to this island of Sacotora there are two other islands  inhabited by coloured people and blacks, like the people of the  Canary Islands, without law or knowledge, and they have no dealings  with any other people. In these two islands much amber and of good  quality is found, and many shells of the valuable and precious kind  in the mine, and much dragon's blood and aloes of Socotra; and there  are large flocks of sheep and oxen.      DIUFAR.    Leaving Cape Fartach towards the coast of the open sea to the  north-east by east, going along the coast L leagues off is a town of  the Moors and seaport called Diufar,[64] a city of the kingdom of  Fartach, in which the Moors of Cambay trade in cotton stuffs, rice,  and other goods.      XEHER.[65]    Further on from this place, in the direction of the same wind, at xx  leagues off, along the same coast, is another town of the Moors,  called Xeher; it also belongs to the kingdom of Fartach, and is very  large; it has a large trade in the stuffs, which the Moors of  Cambay, Chaul, Dabul, and Baticala, and the country of Malabar,  bring in their ships to this port and town of Xeher; these are  coarse and fine cotton stuffs, with which they clothe themselves;  granates on strings and several other jewels of small value, much  rice, sugar, and spice of all kinds, cocoa-nuts, and other goods,  which they sell there to the merchants of the country, who carry  them from there to Aden and all this part of Arabia. And the  importers afterwards employ the money in horses for India: these are  very large and very good, and each one of them in India is worth  five or six hundred ducats. And they also take from there much  wormwood,[66] which grows in that country. And in the interior of  the country all the people are Beduins: in this country there is  much wheat and plenty of meat and dates, grapes, and all other  fruits which are in our parts. And all the ships which sail from  India for the Red Sea, and having been delayed cannot arrive in good  time[67] with their merchandise at the place of their destination,  remain to sell them in this port of Xeher, and from there they go to  India along the coast to Cambay. And so this port is large and of  much trade at all times. This King of Fartach is, with the whole of  his kingdom, in obedience to the King of Aden, because he holds a  brother of his a prisoner. The wormwood which grows in this country  of Xeher is carried from here to all the world, and the ships of  this place load[68] the said wormwood, which is there worth a  hundred and fifty maravedis the hundred weight.      FASALHAD.    Having passed this town of Xeher, along the coast there are other  small towns, and Beduins in the interior of the country. This coast  lasts as far as Cape Fasalhat, which is xxv leagues from Xeher,  between north-east and east, where the kingdom and rule of the King  of Ormuz begins. At this cape there is a fortress which the King of  Ormuz holds there which is called Cor: and from there the coast  begins to bend inwards towards Ormuz.      KINGDOM OF ORMUZ.    After passing this Cape of Fasalhat along the coast to the  north-east, there are many towns and castles of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3829"],[0,"Love Among the Chickens (#7)"],[1,"life. Stop the first man you meet in the street and ask him which  he'd sooner lose, his egg or his wife, and see what he says! We're on  to a good thing, Garny, my boy. Pass the whisky!\"    The upshot of it was that the firms mentioned supplied us with a  quantity of goods, agreeing to receive phantom eggs in exchange. This  satisfied Ukridge. He had a faith in the laying power of his hens which  would have flattered them if they could have known it. It might also  have stimulated their efforts in that direction, which up to date were  feeble.    It was now, as I have said, Thursday, the twenty-second of July,--a  glorious, sunny morning, of the kind which Providence sends  occasionally, simply in order to allow the honest smoker to take his  after-breakfast pipe under ideal conditions. These are the pipes to  which a man looks back in after years with a feeling of wistful  reverence, pipes smoked in perfect tranquillity, mind and body alike at  rest. It is over pipes like these that we dream our dreams, and fashion  our masterpieces.    My pipe was behaving like the ideal pipe; and, as I strolled spaciously  about the lawn, my novel was growing nobly. I had neglected my literary  work for the past week, owing to the insistent claims of the fowls. I  am not one of those men whose minds work in placid independence of the  conditions of life. But I was making up for lost time now. With each  blue cloud that left my lips and hung in the still air above me,  striking scenes and freshets of sparkling dialogue rushed through my  brain. Another uninterrupted half hour, and I have no doubt that I  should have completed the framework of a novel which would have placed  me in that select band of authors who have no christian names. Another  half hour, and posterity would have known me as \"Garnet.\"    But it was not to be.    \"Stop her! Catch her, Garny, old horse!\"    I had wandered into the paddock at the moment. I looked up. Coming  towards me at her best pace was a small hen. I recognised her  immediately. It was the disagreeable, sardonic-looking bird which  Ukridge, on the strength of an alleged similarity of profile to his  wife's nearest relative, had christened Aunt Elizabeth. A Bolshevist  hen, always at the bottom of any disturbance in the fowl-run, a bird  which ate its head off daily at our expense and bit the hands which fed  it by resolutely declining to lay a single egg. Behind this fowl ran  Bob, doing, as usual, the thing that he ought not to have done. Bob's  wrong-headedness in the matter of our hens was a constant source of  inconvenience. From the first, he had seemed to regard the laying-in of  our stock purely in the nature of a tribute to his sporting tastes. He  had a fixed idea that he was a hunting dog and that, recognising this,  we had very decently provided him with the material for the chase.    Behind Bob came Ukridge. But a glance was enough to tell me that he was  a negligible factor in the pursuit. He was not built for speed. Already  the pace had proved too much for him, and he had appointed me his  deputy, with full powers to act.    \"After her, Garny, old horse! Valuable bird! Mustn't be lost!\"    When not in a catalepsy of literary composition, I am essentially the  man of action. I laid aside my novel for future reference, and we  passed out of the paddock in the following order. First, Aunt  Elizabeth, as fresh as paint, going well. Next, Bob, panting and  obviously doubtful of his powers of staying the distance. Lastly,  myself, determined, but wishing I were five years younger.    After the first field Bob, like the dilettante and unstable dog he was,  gave it up, and sauntered off to scratch at a rabbit-hole with an  insufferable air of suggesting that that was what he had come out for  all the time. I continued to pound along doggedly. I was grimly  resolute. I had caught Aunt Elizabeth's eye as she passed me, and the  contempt in it had cut me to the quick. This bird despised me. I am not  a violent or a quick-tempered man, but I have my self-respect. I will  not be sneered at by hens. All the abstract desire for Fame which had  filled my mind five minutes before was concentrated now on the task of  capturing this supercilious bird.    We had been travelling down hill all this time, but at this point we  crossed a road and the ground began to rise. I was in that painful  condition which occurs when one has lost one's first wind and has not  yet got one's second. I was hotter than I had ever been in my life.    Whether Aunt Elizabeth, too, was beginning to feel the effects of her  run, or whether she did it out of the pure effrontery of her warped and  unpleasant nature, I do not know; but she now slowed down to walk, and  even began to peck in a tentative manner at the grass. Her behaviour  infuriated me. I felt that I was being treated as a cipher. I vowed  that this bird should realise yet, even if, as seemed probable, I burst  in the process, that it was no light matter to be pursued by J. Garnet,  author of \"The Manoeuvres of Arthur,\" etc., a man of whose work so  capable a judge as the Peebles _Advertiser_ had said \"Shows promise.\"    A judicious increase of pace brought me within a yard or two of my  quarry. But Aunt Elizabeth, apparently distrait, had the situation well  in hand. She darted from me with an amused chuckle, and moved off  rapidly again up the hill.    I followed, but there was that within me that told me I had shot my  bolt. The sun blazed down, concentrating its rays on my back to the  exclusion of the surrounding scenery. It seemed to follow me about like  a limelight.    We had reached level ground. Aunt Elizabeth had again slowed to a walk,  and I was capable of no better pace. Very gradually I closed in. There  was a high boxwood hedge in front of us; and, just as I came close  enough once more to stake my all on a single grab, Aunt Elizabeth, with  another of her sardonic chuckles, dived in head-foremost and struggled  through in the mysterious way in which birds do get through hedges. The  sound of her faint spinster-like snigger came to me as I stood panting,  and roused me like a bugle. The next moment I too had plunged into the  hedge.    I was in the middle of it, very hot, tired, and dirty, when from the  other side I heard a sudden shout of \"Mark over! Bird to the right!\"  and the next moment I found myself emerging with a black face and  tottering knees on the gravel path of a private garden. Beyond the path  was a croquet lawn, and on this lawn I perceived, as through a glass  darkly, three figures. The mist cleared from my eyes, and I recognised  two of them.    One was the middle-aged Irishman who had travelled down with us in the  train. The other was his blue-eyed daughter.    The third member of the party was a man, a stranger to me. By some  miracle of adroitness he had captured Aunt Elizabeth, and was holding  her in spite of her protests in a workmanlike manner behind the wings.        CHAPTER VII    THE ENTENTE CORDIALE IS SEALED    There are moments and moments. The present one belonged to the more  painful variety.    Even to my exhausted mind it was plain that there was a need here for  explanations. An Irishman's croquet-lawn is his castle, and strangers  cannot plunge in through hedges without inviting comment.    Unfortunately, speech was beyond me. I could have emptied a water-butt,  laid down and gone to sleep, or melted ice with a touch of the finger,  but I could not speak. The conversation was opened by the other man, in  whose restraining hand Aunt Elizabeth now lay, outwardly resigned but  inwardly, as I, who knew her haughty spirit, could guess, boiling with  baffled resentment. I could see her looking out of the corner of her  eye, trying to estimate the chances of getting in one good hard peck  with her aquiline beak.    \"Come right in,\" said the man pleasantly. \"Don't knock.\"    I stood there, gasping. I was only too well aware that I presented a  quaint appearance. I had removed my hat before entering the hedge, and  my hair was full of twigs and other foreign substances. My face was  moist and grimy. My mouth hung open. My legs felt as if they had ceased  to belong to me.    \"I must apol-- ...\" I began, and ended the sentence with gulps.    The elderly gentleman looked at me with what seemed to be indignant  surprise. His daughter appeared to my guilty conscience to be looking  through me. Aunt Elizabeth sneered. The only friendly face was the  man's. He regarded me with a kindly smile, as if I were some old friend  who had dropped in unexpectedly.    \"Take a long breath,\" he advised.    I took several, and felt better.    \"I must apologise for this intrusion,\" I said successfully.  \"Unwarrantable\" would have rounded off the sentence neatly, but I would  not risk it. It would have been mere bravado to attempt unnecessary  words of five syllables. I took in more breath. \"The fact is, I  did--didn't know there was a private garden beyond the hedge. If you  will give me my hen ...\"    I stopped. Aunt Elizabeth was looking away, as if endeavouring to  create an impression of having nothing to do with me. I am told by one  who knows that hens cannot raise their eyebrows, not having any; but I  am prepared to swear that at this moment Aunt Elizabeth raised hers. I  will go further. She sniffed.    \"Here you are,\" said the man. \"Though it's hard to say good-bye.\"    He held out the hen to me, and at this point a hitch occurred. He did  his part, the letting go, all right. It was in my department, the  taking hold, that the thing was bungled. Aunt Elizabeth slipped from my  grasp like an eel, stood for a moment eyeing me satirically with her  head on one side, then fled and entrenched herself in some bushes at  the end of the lawn.    There are times when the most resolute man feels that he can battle no  longer with fate; when everything seems against him and the only course  is a dignified retreat. But there is"]]]
