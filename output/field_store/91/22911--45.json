On the Hesiodic poems generally the ordinary Histories of Greek  Literature may be consulted, but especially the \"Hist. de la Litterature  Grecque\" I pp. 459 ff. of MM. Croiset. The summary account in Prof.  Murray's \"Anc. Gk. Lit.\" is written with a strong sceptical bias. Very  valuable is the appendix to Mair's translation (Oxford, 1908) on \"The  Farmer's Year in Hesiod\". Recent work on the Hesiodic poems is reviewed  in full by Rzach in Bursian's \"Jahresberichte\" vols. 100 (1899) and 152  (1911).    For the \"Fragments\" of Hesiodic poems the work of Markscheffel, \"Hesiodi  Fragmenta\" (Leipzig, 1840), is most valuable: important also is Kinkel's  \"Epicorum Graecorum Fragmenta\" I (Leipzig, 1877) and the editions of  Rzach noticed above. For recently discovered papyrus fragments see  Wilamowitz, \"Neue Bruchstucke d. Hesiod Katalog\" (Sitzungsb. der k.  preuss. Akad. fur Wissenschaft, 1900, pp. 839-851).

The Homeric Hymns:--The text of the Homeric hymns is distinctly bad in  condition, a fact which may be attributed to the general neglect under  which they seem to have laboured at all periods previously to the  Revival of Learning. Very many defects have been corrected by the  various editions of the Hymns, but a considerable number still defy all  efforts; and especially an abnormal number of undoubted lacuna disfigure  the text. Unfortunately no papyrus fragment of the Hymns has yet  emerged, though one such fragment (\"Berl. Klassikertexte\" v.1. pp. 7  ff.) contains a paraphrase of a poem very closely parallel to the \"Hymn  to Demeter\".    The mediaeval MSS. [1202] are thus enumerated by Dr. T.W. Allen:--         A    Paris, Bibl. Nat. 2763.       At   Athos, Vatopedi 587.       B    Paris, Bibl. Nat. 2765.       C    Paris, Bibl. Nat. 2833.       {Gamma}   Brussels, Bibl.

Aldine Edition, Venice, 1504.       Juntine Edition, 1537.       Stephanus, Paris, 1566 and 1588.         More modern editions or critical works of value are:         Martin (Variarum Lectionum libb. iv), Paris, 1605.       Barnes, Cambridge, 1711.       Ruhnken, Leyden, 1782 (Epist.

Ludwich (\"Battle of the Frogs and Mice\"), 1896.       Allen and Sikes, London, 1904.       Allen (Homeri Opera v), Oxford, 1912.    Of these editions that of Messrs Allen and Sikes is by far the best:  not only is the text purged of the load of conjectures for which the  frequent obscurities of the Hymns offer a special opening, but the  Introduction and the Notes throughout are of the highest value. For a  full discussion of the MSS. and textual problems, reference must be made  to this edition, as also to Dr. T.W. Allen's series of articles in the  \"Journal of Hellenic Studies\" vols. xv ff. Among translations those of  J. Edgar (Edinburgh), 1891) and of Andrew Lang (London, 1899) may be  mentioned.      The Epic Cycle:--    The fragments of the Epic Cycle, being drawn from a variety of authors,  no list of MSS. can be given. The following collections and editions may  be mentioned:--          Muller, Leipzig, 1829.        Dindorff (Didot edition of Homer), Paris, 1837-56.        Kinkel (Epicorum Graecorum Fragmenta i), Leipzig, 1877.        Allen (Homeri Opera v), Oxford, 1912.    The fullest discussion of the problems and fragments of the epic cycle  is F.G. Welcker's \"der epische Cyclus\" (Bonn, vol. i, 1835: vol. ii,  1849: vol. i, 2nd edition, 1865). The Appendix to Monro's \"Homer's  Odyssey\" xii-xxiv (pp. 340 ff.) deals with the Cyclic poets in relation  to Homer, and a clear and reasonable discussion of the subject is to be  found in Croiset's \"Hist. de la Litterature Grecque\", vol. i.      On Hesiod, the Hesiodic poems and the problems which these offer  see Rzach's most important article \"Hesiodos\" in Pauly-Wissowa,  \"Real-Encyclopadie\" xv (1912).    A discussion of the evidence for the date of Hesiod is to be found in  \"Journ. Hell. Stud.\" xxxv, 85 ff. (T.W. Allen).    Of translations of Hesiod the following may be noticed:--\"The Georgicks  of Hesiod\", by George Chapman, London, 1618; \"The Works of Hesiod  translated from the Greek\", by Thomas Coocke, London, 1728; \"The Remains  of Hesiod translated from the Greek into English Verse\", by Charles  Abraham Elton; \"The Works of Hesiod, Callimachus, and Theognis\", by the  Rev. J. Banks, M.A.; \"Hesiod\", by Prof. James Mair, Oxford, 1908 [1203].          THE WORKS OF HESIOD      WORKS AND DAYS (832 lines)    (ll. 1-10) Muses of Pieria who give glory through song, come hither,  tell of Zeus your father and chant his praise. Through him mortal men  are famed or un-famed, sung or unsung alike, as great Zeus wills. For  easily he makes strong, and easily he brings the strong man low; easily  he humbles the proud and raises the obscure, and easily he straightens  the crooked and blasts the proud,--Zeus who thunders aloft and has his  dwelling most high.    Attend thou with eye and ear, and make judgements straight with  righteousness. And I, Perses, would tell of true things.    (ll. 11-24) So, after all, there was not one kind of Strife alone, but  all over the earth there are two. As for the one, a man would praise her  when he came to understand her; but the other is blameworthy: and they  are wholly different in nature. For one fosters evil war and battle,  being cruel: her no man loves; but perforce, through the will of the  deathless gods, men pay harsh Strife her honour due. But the other is  the elder daughter of dark Night, and the son of Cronos who sits above  and dwells in the aether, set her in the roots of the earth: and she is  far kinder to men. She stirs up even the shiftless to toil; for a man  grows eager to work when he considers his neighbour, a rich man who  hastens to plough and plant and put his house in good order; and  neighbour vies with his neighbour as he hurries after wealth. This  Strife is wholesome for men. And potter is angry with potter, and  craftsman with craftsman, and beggar is jealous of beggar, and minstrel  of minstrel.    (ll. 25-41) Perses, lay up these things in your heart, and do not let  that Strife who delights in mischief hold your heart back from work,  while you peep and peer and listen to the wrangles of the court-house.

His body was girt with things like great serpents,      made with gold and precious stones, and in one hand he held a      bow, and arrows in the other. And another little idol who stood      by him, and, as they said, was his page, carried a short lance      for him, and a very rich shield of gold and jewels. And      Huichilobos had his neck hung round with faces of Indians, and      what seemed to be the hearts of these same Indians, made of      gold, or some of them of silver, covered with blue gems; and      there stood some brasiers there, containing incense made with      copal and the hearts of three Indians who had been slain that      same day; and they were burning, and with the smoke and incense      they had made that sacrifice to him; and all the walls of this      oratory were so bathed and blackened with cakes of blood, as was      the very ground itself, that the whole exhaled a very foul      odour.        \"Carrying our eyes to the left we perceived another great mass,      as high as Huichilobos. Its face was like a bear's, and its      shining eyes were made of mirrors called Tezcat. Its body was      covered with rich gems like that of Huichilobos, for they said      that they were brothers. And this Tescatepuca\" (the mutilated      form under which Bernal Diaz presents Tezcatlipoca) \"was the god      of hell\" (this is another mistake, for Tezcatlipoca was a      celestial deity).... \"His body was surrounded with figures like      little imps, with tails like serpents; and the walls were so      caked and the ground so saturated with blood, that the      slaughterhouses of Castile do not exhale such a stench; and      indeed we saw the hearts of five victims who had been      slaughtered that same day.... And since everything smelt of the      shambles, we were impatient to escape from the foul odour and      yet fouler sight.\"      II.    Such was the impression made upon a Spanish soldier and a good Catholic  by the sight of the two chief deities of the Mexican people. To him  they were simply two abominable inventions of Satan. Let us try to go a  little further below the surface.    Uitzilopochtli signifies _Humming-bird to the left_, from _Uizilin_  (Humming-bird), and _opochtli_ (to the left). The latter part of the  name is probably due to the position we have just seen noticed to the  left of the other great deity, Tezcatlipoca. But why Humming-bird? What  can there be in common between this graceful little creature and the  monstrous idol of the Aztecs? The answer is given by the American  mythology, in which the Humming-bird is a divine being, the messenger of  the Sun. In the Aztec language it is often called the \"sunbeam\" or the  \"sun's hair.\" This charming little bird, with the purple, gold and topaz  sheen of its lovely plumage, as it flits amongst the flowers like a  butterfly, darts out its long tongue before it to extract their juices,  with a burring of its wings like the humming of bees, whence it derives  its English name. Moreover, it is extremely courageous, and will engage  with far larger birds than itself in defence of its nest. In the  northern regions of Mexico, the humming-bird is the messenger of  spring, as the swallow is with us. At the beginning of May, after a cold  and dry season that has parched the soil and blighted all verdure, the  atmosphere becomes pregnant with rain, the sun regains his power, and a  marvellous transformation sets in. The land arrays itself, before the  very eyes, with verdure and flowers, the air is filled with perfumes,  the maize comes to a head, and hosts of humming-birds appear, as if to  announce that the fair season has returned. We may lay it down as  certain that the humming-bird was the object of a religious cultus  amongst the earliest Aztecs, as the divine messenger of the Spring, like  the wren amongst our own peasantry, the plover amongst the Latins, and  the crow amongst many tribes of the Red-skins. It was the emissary of  the Sun.    It was in this capacity, and under the law of anthropomorphism to which  all the Mexican deities were subject, that the divine humming-bird, as a  revealing god, the protector of the Aztec nation, took the human form  more and more completely in the religious consciousness of his  worshippers. And indeed the Mexican mythology gives form to this idea  that the divine humming-bird (of which those on earth were but the  relatives or little brothers) was a celestial man like an Aztec of the  first rank, in the following legend of his incarnation.    Near to Coatepec, that is to say the Mountain of Serpents,[10] lived the  pious widow _Coatlicue_ or _Coatlantona_ (the ultimate meaning of which  is \"female serpent\"). One day, as she was going to the temple to worship  the Sun, she saw a little tuft of brilliantly coloured feathers fall at  her feet. She picked it up and placed it in her bosom to present as an  offering to the Sun. But when she was about to draw it forth, she knew  not what had come upon her. Soon afterwards she perceived that she was  about to become a mother. Her children were so enraged that they  determined to kill her, but a voice from her womb cried out to her,  \"Mother, have no fear, for I will save thee, to thy great honour and my  own great glory.\" And in fact Coatlicue's children failed in their  murderous attempt. In due time Uitzilopochtli was born, grasping his  shield and lance, with a plume of feathers shaped like a bird's beak on  his head, with humming-birds' feathers on his left leg, and his face,  arms and legs barred with blue. Endowed from his birth with  extraordinary strength, while still an infant he put to death those who  had attempted to slay his mother, together with all who had taken their  part. He gave her everything he could take from them; and after  accomplishing mighty feats on behalf of the Aztecs, whom he had taken  under his protection, he re-ascended to heaven, bearing his mother with  him, and making her henceforth the goddess of flowers.[11]    You will be struck by the analogy between this myth and more than one  Greek counterpart. There is the same method of reducing to the  conditions of human life, and concentrating at a single point of time  and space, a permanent or regularly recurrent and periodic natural  phenomenon. Uitzilopochtli, the humming-bird, has come from the Sun with  the purpose of making himself man, and he has therefore taken flesh in  an Aztec woman, Coatlicue, the serpent, who is no other than the spring  florescence, and therefore the Mexican Flora. It is not only amongst the  Mexicans that the creeping progress of the spring vegetation, stretching  along the ground towards the North, has suggested the idea of a divine  serpent crawling over the earth. The Athenian myth of Erichthonius is a  conception of the same order. The celestial humming-bird, then,  offspring of the Sun, valiant and warlike from the day of his birth,  champion of his mother, plundering and ever victorious, is the symbol  instinctively seized on by the Aztec people; for it, too, had sprung  from humble beginnings, had been despised and menaced by its neighbours,  and had grown so marvellously in power and in wealth as to have become  the invincible lord of Anahuac. Uitzilopochtli had grown with the Aztec  people. He bears, amongst other surnames, that of Mextli, the warrior,  whence the name of Mexico. He protects his people and ever extends the  boundaries of its empire. And thus, in spite of his bearing the name of  a little bird, his statue as an incarnate deity had become colossal. Yet  the Aztecs did not lose the memory of his original minuteness of  stature. Did you observe, in the account given by Bernal Diaz, that  there stood at the feet of the huge idol another quite small one, that  served, according to the Spanish Captain, as his page? This was the  _Uitziton_, or \"little humming-bird,\" called also the _Paynalton_, or  the \"little quick one,\" whose image was borne by a priest at the head of  the soldiers as they charged the enemy. On the day of his festival, too,  he was borne at full speed along the streets of the city. He was,  therefore, the diminutive Uitzilopochtli, or, more correctly speaking,  the Uitzilopochtli of the early days, the portable idol of the still  wandering tribe; and in fidelity to those memories, as well as to  preserve the warlike rite to the efficacy of which they attached so much  value, the Aztecs had kept the small statue by the side of the great  one.    To sum up: Uitzilopochtli was a derivative form or determination of the  Sun, and specifically of the Sun of the fair season. He had three great  annual festivals. The first fell in May, at the moment of the return of  the flowering vegetation. The second was celebrated in August, when the  favourable season unfolded all its beauty. The third coincided with our  month of December. It was the beginning of the cold and dry season. On  the day of this third festival they made a statue in Uitzilopochtli's  likeness, out of dough concocted with the blood of sacrificed infants,  and, after all kinds of ceremonies, a priest pierced the statue with an  arrow. Uitzilopochtli would die with the verdure, the flowers and all  the beauteous adornments of spring and summer. But, like Adonis, like  Osiris, like Atys, and so many other solar deities, he only died to live  and to return again.[12]    It was now his brother Tezcatlipoca who took the direction of the world.  His name signifies \"Shining Mirror.\" As the Sun of the cold and sterile  season, he turned his impassive glance upon "]]]
