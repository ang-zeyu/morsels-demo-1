Let stand a week longer, then  drain well, wipe with a damp cloth, rub over outside with a mixture of  salt, moist sugar, and ground black pepper, and hang in a cool, airy  place where the hams can be lightly smoked for a fortnight.  Winter-curing, or late fall, alone is possible to the average  householder. After smoking, wrap in waxed paper, and canvas the same as  other hams.    Cook the same as venison, which mutton thus cured much resembles. Slice  and broil, serving with butter and very sour jelly, else boil whole in  very little water until tender, glazing with tart jelly, and crisping in  the oven after draining and cooling. Or soak two hours in cold water,  then cover completely with an inch-thick crust of flour and water mixed  stiff, and bake in a slow oven four to five hours. Serve always with  very piquant sauce, and sharp pickle, or highly spiced catsups. Make  jelly from wild grapes, wild plums, green grapes, green gooseberries or  crab apples, using half the usual amount of sugar, especially for such  meat.    Melt half a glass of such jelly with a tablespoon of boiling water. Add  black pepper, paprika, a dash of tabasco, and the strained juice of a  lemon, add gradually a teaspoon of dry mustard. Cook over hot water  until well mixed and smooth, and keep hot until served.    Beef hams are troublesome--but worth the trouble. Take them from small  but well fatted animals, cut off the shank, also part of the top round.  Rub over very scantly with powdered saltpeter, mixed well through moist  sugar, then lay down in salt for a fortnight, else cover with brine made  thus. Pint pickling salt to the gallon of cold water, teaspoon sugar,  and pinch of whole cloves. Boil and skim. Pour cold over the hams in a  clean barrel. Let stand a fortnight, take out, drain and wipe, rub over  with dry salt, and hang high in cold air. Smoke lightly after three  days. Keep smoking, but not too much, for a month. Cover all over with  ground black pepper, mixed to a paste with molasses, canvas and leave  hanging.    Slice and broil, else chip and serve raw. Frizzling is possible but a  waste of God's good mercies. Properly cured meat is salt but not too  salt, of a deep blackish-red, and when sliced thin, partly translucent,  also of an indescribable savoriness. Cut as nearly as possible, across  the grain. Do not undertake to make beef hams save in the late fall, so  there may be cold weather for the curing. The meat must be chilled  through before salt touches it, but freezing is very detrimental. Frozen  meat does not absorb the salt, sugar, etc., essential to proper curing.  By time it thaws so absorption becomes possible, there may have been  changes such as take place in cold storage, unfitting it for food. If  the beef ham is thick it may need to lie a month in salt or in brine.  Here as elsewhere, the element of judgment comes into play.    If rabbits are very plenty and very fat, put down a jar of hindquarters  in marinade for three days, then wipe, and hang in a cold, dry place. A  rabbit ought to be dressed before it is cold--thus it escapes the strong  flavor which makes market rabbits often unendurable. Chill but do not  freeze after dressing. A light smoking does not hurt the quarters, which  should be left double, with the thick loin between. Soak two hours  before cooking, and smother with plenty of butter, black and red pepper  and a dash of pepper vinegar. An excellent breakfast or luncheon relish.    To cook a fresh ham properly, choose one weighing ten pounds or less,  scrape and wash clean, score the skin, all over, then season well with  salt, sugar, black and red pepper, and dot with tabasco on top. Set on a  rack in a deep pan, pour boiling water underneath to barely touch the  meat, cover close, and bake in a hot oven for two hours, filling up the  water in the pan as it bakes away. Uncover, and cook for half an hour  longer, slacking heat one half, and basting the meat with the liquor in  the pan. If approved add a cup of cider or sound claret to the basting  liquor. Leave unbasted for ten minutes before taking up, so the skin may  be properly crisp.          [Illustration: _For Thirsty Souls_]      _Grandmother's Cherry Bounce_: Rinse a clean, empty whiskey barrel well  with cold water, drain, and fill with very ripe Morello cherries, mixed  with black wild cherries. One gallon wild cherries to five of Morellos  is about the proper proportion. Strew scantly through the cherries,  blade mace, whole cloves, allspice, a very little bruised ginger, and  grated nutmeg. Add to a full barrel of fruit twenty pounds of sugar--or  in the proportion of half a pound to the gallon of fruit. Cover the  fruit an inch deep with good corn whiskey, the older and milder the  better. Leave out the bung but cover the opening with lawn. Let stand  six months undisturbed in a dry, airy place, rather warm. Rack off into  a clean barrel, let stand six months longer, then bottle or put in  demijohns. This improves greatly with age up to the fifth year--after  that the change is unappreciable.    _Grape Cider_: Fill a clean, tight, well-scalded barrel with ripe wild  grapes picked from their stems. Add spices if you like, but they can be  left out. Fill the vessel with new cider, the sweeter the better. There  should be room left to ferment. Cover the bung-hole with thin cloth and  let stand in dry air four to six months. Rack off and bottle. This also  improves with age. It is a drink to be used with caution--mild as May in  the mouth, but heady, and overcoming, especially to those unused to its  seductions.    _Persimmon Beer_: The poor relation of champagne--with the advantage  that nobody is ever the worse for drinking it. To make it, take  full-ripe persimmons, the juicier the better, free them of stalks and  calyxes, then mash thoroughly, and add enough wheat bran or middlings  to make a stiffish dough. Form the dough into thin, flat cakes, which  bake crisp in a slow oven. When cold break them up in a clean barrel,  and fill it with filtered rainwater. A bushel of persimmons before  mashing will make a barrel of beer. Set the barrel upright, covered with  a thin cloth, in a warm, dry place, free of taints. Let stand until the  beer works--the persimmon cakes will rise and stand in a foamy mass on  top. After three to four weeks, either move the barrel to a cold place,  or rack off the beer into bottles or demijohns, tieing down the corks,  and keeping the bottled stuff very cool. The more meaty and flavorous  the persimmons, the richer will be the beer. Beware of putting in fruit  that has not felt the touch of frost, so retains a rough tang. A very  little of it will spoil a whole brewing of beer. If the beer is left  standing in the barrel a wooden cover should be laid over the cloth,  after it is done working. Fermentation can be hastened by putting in  with the persimmon cakes a slice of toast dipped in quick yeast. But if  the temperature is right, the beer will ferment itself.    _Egg Nogg_: Have all ingredients, eggs, sugar, brandy, and whiskey,  thoroughly chilled before beginning, and work very, very quickly. Beat  the yolks of eighteen eggs very light with six cups of granulated sugar,  added a cup at a time. When frothy and pale yellow, beat in gradually  and alternately a glassful at a time, a quart of mellow old whiskey, and  a quart of real French brandy. Whip hard, then add the whites of the  eggs beaten till they stick to the dish. Grate nutmeg over the top, and  rub the rims of the serving glasses with lemon or orange rind cut into  the fruit. The glasses should be ice-cold, also the spoons. Fill  carefully so as not to slop the sides, and serve at once.    If wanted for an early morning Christmas celebration, beat up yolks and  sugar the night before, stand on ice along with the liquor, and keep the  unbeaten whites likewise very cold. At morning freshen the yolks a  little, then add the liquor, and at last the whites newly frothed. This  is the only simon-pure Christmas egg nogg. Those who put into it milk,  cream, what not, especially rum, defile one of the finest among  Christmas delights.    _White Egg Nogg_: For invalids, especially fever patients. Whip the  white of a new laid egg as stiff as possible with the least suspicion of  salt. Add to it three heaping spoonfuls of sterilized cream whipped  light, beat in two tablespoonfuls of powdered sugar, then add a gill of  the best French brandy. A variant is to omit the sugar and mix with the  frothed egg and cream more than a gill of vermouth, using French or  Italian, according to taste.    _Apple Toddy_: Wash and core, but do not peel, six large, fair apples,  bake, covered, until tender through and through, put into an earthen  bowl and strew with cloves, mace, and bruised ginger, also six lumps of  Domino sugar for each apple. Pour over a quart of full-boiling water,  let stand covered fifteen minutes in a warm place. Then add a quart of  mellow whiskey, leave standing ten minutes longer, and keep warm. Serve  in big deep goblets, putting an apple or half of one in the bottom of  each, and filling with the liquor. Grate nutmeg on top just at the  minute of serving.    _Hail Storm_: Mix equal quantities of clear ice, broken small, and the  best lump sugar. Cover the mixture fully with good brandy, put in a  shaker, shake hard five minutes, then pour into glasses, and serve with  a fresh mint leaf floating on top.    _Mint Julep_: This requires the best of everything if you would have it  in perfection. Especially the mint and the whiskey or brandy. Choose  tender, quick-grown mint, leafy, not long-stalked and coarse, wash it  very clean, taking care not to bruise it in the least, and lay in a  clean cloth upon ice. Chill the spirits likewise. Put the sugar and  water in a clean "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28497"],[0,"Myths of the Norsemen: From the Eddas and Sagas (#7)"],[1,"and girls,      With rosy cheeks and flaxen curls,      And sparkling eyes and teeth like pearls,      Tripping and skipping, ran merrily after      The wonderful music with shouting and laughter.\"                Robert Browning.      The burghers were powerless to prevent the tragedy, and as they  stood spellbound the piper led the children out of the town to the  Koppelberg, a hill on the confines of the town, which miraculously  opened to receive the procession, and only closed again when the last  child had passed out of sight. This legend probably originated the  adage \"to pay the piper.\" The children were never seen in Hamelin  again, and in commemoration of this public calamity all official  decrees have since been dated so many years after the Pied Piper's  visit.          \"They made a decree that lawyers never        Should think their records dated duly      If, after the day of the month and year,      These words did not as well appear,      'And so long after what happened here        On the Twenty-second of July,      Thirteen hundred and seventy-six:'      And the better in memory to fix      The place of the children's last retreat,      They called it the Pied Piper Street--      Where any one playing on pipe or tabor      Was sure for the future to lose his labour.\"                Robert Browning.      In this myth Odin is the piper, the shrill tones of the flute are  emblematic of the whistling wind, the rats represent the souls of  the dead, which cheerfully follow him, and the hollow mountain into  which he leads the children is typical of the grave.        Bishop Hatto    Another German legend which owes its existence to this belief is  the story of Bishop Hatto, the miserly prelate, who, annoyed by the  clamours of the poor during a time of famine, had them burned alive  in a deserted barn, like the rats whom he declared they resembled,  rather than give them some of the precious grain which he had laid  up for himself.          \"'I' faith, 'tis an excellent bonfire!' quoth he,      'And the country is greatly obliged to me      For ridding it in these times forlorn      Of rats that only consume the corn.'\"                Robert Southey.      Soon after this terrible crime had been accomplished the bishop's  retainers reported the approach of a vast swarm of rats. These, it  appears, were the souls of the murdered peasants, which had assumed the  forms of the rats to which the bishop had likened them. His efforts  to escape were vain, and the rats pursued him even into the middle  of the Rhine, to a stone tower in which he took refuge from their  fangs. They swam to the tower, gnawed their way through the stone  walls, and, pouring in on all sides at once, they found the bishop  and devoured him alive.          \"And in at the windows, and in at the door,      And through the walls, helter-skelter they pour,      And down from the ceiling, and up through the floor,      From the right and the left, from behind and before,      From within and without, from above and below,      And all at once to the Bishop they go.      They have whetted their teeth against the stones;      And now they pick the Bishop's bones;      They gnaw'd the flesh from every limb,      For they were sent to do judgment on him!\"                Robert Southey.      The red glow of the sunset above the Rat Tower near Bingen on the  Rhine is supposed to be the reflection of the hell fire in which the  wicked bishop is slowly roasting in punishment for his heinous crime.        Irmin    In some parts of Germany Odin was considered to be identical with  the Saxon god Irmin, whose statue, the Irminsul, near Paderborn, was  destroyed by Charlemagne in 772. Irmin was said to possess a ponderous  brazen chariot, in which he rode across the sky along the path which  we know as the Milky Way, but which the ancient Germans designated  as Irmin's Way. This chariot, whose rumbling sound occasionally  became perceptible to mortal ears as thunder, never left the sky,  where it can still be seen in the constellation of the Great Bear,  which is also known in the North as Odin's, or Charles's, Wain.              \"The Wain, who wheels on high      His circling course, and on Orion waits;      Sole star that never bathes in the Ocean wave.\"                Homer's Iliad (Derby's tr.).        Mimir's Well    To obtain the great wisdom for which he is so famous, Odin, in the  morn of time, visited Mimir's (Memor, memory) spring, \"the fountain  of all wit and wisdom,\" in whose liquid depths even the future was  clearly mirrored, and besought the old man who guarded it to let him  have a draught. But Mimir, who well knew the value of such a favour  (for his spring was considered the source or headwater of memory),  refused the boon unless Odin would consent to give one of his eyes  in exchange.    The god did not hesitate, so highly did he prize the draught, but  immediately plucked out one of his eyes, which Mimir kept in pledge,  sinking it deep down into his fountain, where it shone with mild  lustre, leaving Odin with but one eye, which is considered emblematic  of the sun.          \"Through our whole lives we strive towards the sun;      That burning forehead is the eye of Odin.      His second eye, the moon, shines not so bright;      It has he placed in pledge in Mimer's fountain,      That he may fetch the healing waters thence,      Each morning, for the strengthening of this eye.\"                Oehlenschlaeger (Howitt's tr.).      Drinking deeply of Mimir's fount, Odin gained the knowledge he  coveted, and he never regretted the sacrifice he had made, but as  further memorial of that day broke off a branch of the sacred tree  Yggdrasil, which overshadowed the spring, and fashioned from it his  beloved spear Gungnir.          \"A dauntless god      Drew for drink to its gleam,      Where he left in endless      Payment the light of an eye.      From the world-ash      Ere Wotan went he broke a bough;      For a spear the staff      He split with strength from the stem.\"                Dusk of the Gods, Wagner (Forman's tr.).      But although Odin was now all-wise, he was sad and oppressed, for  he had gained an insight into futurity, and had become aware of the  transitory nature of all things, and even of the fate of the gods,  who were doomed to pass away. This knowledge so affected his spirits  that he ever after wore a melancholy and contemplative expression.    To test the value of the wisdom he had thus obtained, Odin went to  visit the most learned of all the giants, Vafthrudnir, and entered  with him into a contest of wit, in which the stake was nothing less  than the loser's head.          \"Odin rose with speed, and went      To contend in runic lore      With the wise and crafty Jute.      To Vafthrudni's royal hall      Came the mighty king of spells.\"                Vafthrudni's-mal (W. Taylor's tr.).        Odin and Vafthrudnir    On this occasion Odin had disguised himself as a Wanderer, by Frigga's  advice, and when asked his name declared it was Gangrad. The contest of  wit immediately began, Vafthrudnir questioning his guest concerning  the horses which carried Day and Night across the sky, the river  Ifing separating Joetun-heim from Asgard, and also about Vigrid,  the field where the last battle was to be fought.    All these questions were minutely answered by Odin, who, when  Vafthrudnir had ended, began the interrogatory in his turn, and  received equally explicit answers about the origin of heaven and  earth, the creation of the gods, their quarrel with the Vanas, the  occupations of the heroes in Valhalla, the offices of the Norns, and  the rulers who were to replace the AEsir when they had all perished  with the world they had created. But when, in conclusion, Odin bent  near the giant and softly inquired what words Allfather whispered  to his dead son Balder as he lay upon his funeral pyre, Vafthrudnir  suddenly recognised his divine visitor. Starting back in dismay, he  declared that no one but Odin himself could answer that question,  and that it was now quite plain to him that he had madly striven  in a contest of wisdom and wit with the king of the gods, and fully  deserved the penalty of failure, the loss of his head.          \"Not the man of mortal race      Knows the words which thou hast spoken      To thy son in days of yore.      I hear the coming tread of death;      He soon shall raze the runic lore,      And knowledge of the rise of gods,      From his ill-fated soul who strove      With Odin's self the strife of wit,      Wisest of the wise that breathe:      Our stake was life, and thou hast won.\"                Vafthrudni's-mal (W. Taylor's tr.).      As is the case with so many of the Northern myths, which are often  fragmentary and obscure, this one ends here, and none of the scalds  informs us whether Odin really slew his rival, nor what was the answer  to his last question; but mythologists have hazarded the suggestion  that the word whispered by Odin in Balder's ear, to console him for  his untimely death, must have been \"resurrection.\"        Invention of Runes    Besides being god of wisdom, Odin was god and inventor of runes,  the earliest alphabet used by Northern nations, which characters,  signifying mystery, were at first used for divination, although in  later times they served for inscriptions and records. Just as wisdom  could only be obtained at the cost of sacrifice, Odin himself relates  that he hung nine days and nights from the sacred tree Yggdrasil,  gazing down into the immeasurable depths of Nifl-heim, plunged in deep  thought, and self-wounded with his spear, ere he won the knowledge  he sought.          \"I know that I hung      On a wind-rocked tree      Nine whole nights,      With a spear wounded,      And to Odin offered      Myself to myself;      On that tree      Of which no one knows      From what root it springs.\"                Odin's Rune-Song (Tho"]]]
