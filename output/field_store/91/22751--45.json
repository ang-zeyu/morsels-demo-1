[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2747"],[0,"Nisida (#7)"],[1,"day, before we were born,  a fine lady, richly dressed, landed in our island from a splendid boat;  she asked to see my mother, who was as young and beautiful as my Nisida  is to-day. She could not cease from admiring her; she blamed the  blindness of fate which had buried this lovely jewel in the bosom of an  obscure island; she showered praises, caresses, and gifts upon my  mother, and after many indirect speeches, finally asked her parents for  her, that she might make her her lady-in-waiting. The poor people,  foreseeing in the protection of so great a lady a brilliant future for  their daughter, were weak enough to yield. That lady was your mother;  and do you know why she came thus to seek that poor innocent maiden?  Because your mother had a lover, and because she wished to make sure, in  this infamous manner, of the prince's indulgence.\"    \"Silence, wretch!\"    \"Oh, your excellency will hear me out. At the beginning, my poor mother  found herself surrounded by the tenderest care: the princess could not  be parted from her for a moment; the most flattering words, the finest  clothes, the richest ornaments were hers; the servants paid her as much  respect as though she were a daughter of the house. When her parents  went to see her and to inquire whether she did not at all regret having  left them, they found her so lovely and so happy, that they blessed the  princess as a good angel sent them from God. Then the prince conceived a  remarkable affection for my mother; little by little his manners became  more familiar and affectionate. At last the princess went away for a few  days, regretting that she could not take with her her dear child, as she  called her. Then the prince's brutality knew no further barriers; he no  longer concealed his shameful plans of seduction; he spread before the  poor girl's eyes pearl necklaces and caskets of diamonds; he passed from  the most glowing passion to the blackest fury, from the humblest prayers  to the most horrible threats. The poor child was shut up in a cellar  where there was hardly a gleam of daylight, and every morning a  frightful gaoler came and threw her a bit of black bread, repeating with  oaths that it only depended upon herself to alter all this by becoming  the prince's mistress. This cruelty continued for two years. The  princess had gone on a long journey, and my mother's poor parents  believed that their daughter was still happy with her protectress. On  her return, having; no doubt fresh sins for which she needed  forgiveness, she took my mother from her dungeon, assumed the liveliest  indignation at this horrible treatment, about which she appeared to have  known nothing, wiped her tears, and by an abominable refinement of  perfidy received the thanks of the victim whom she was about to  sacrifice.    \"One evening--I have just finished, my lord--the princess chose to sup  alone with her lady-in-waiting: the rarest fruits, the most exquisite  dishes, and the most delicate wines were served to my poor mother, whose  prolonged privations had injured her health and weakened her reason; she  gave way to a morbid gaiety. Diabolical philtres were poured into her  cup; that is another tradition in your family. My mother felt uplifted,  her eyes shone with feverish brilliance, her cheeks were on fire. Then  the prince came in--oh! your excellency will see that God protects the  poor. My darling mother, like a frightened dove, sheltered herself in  the bosom of the princess, who pushed her away, laughing. The poor  distraught girl, trembling, weeping, knelt down in the midst of that  infamous room. It was St. Anne's Day; all at once the house shook, the  walls cracked, cries of distress rang out in the streets. My mother was  saved. It was the earthquake that destroyed half Naples. You know all  about it, my lord, since your old palace is no longer habitable.\"    \"What are you driving at?\" cried Brancaleone in terrible agitation.    \"Oh, I merely wish to persuade you that you must fight with me,\"  answered the fisherman coldly, as he offered him a cartridge. \"And now,\"  he added, in an excited tone, \"say your prayers, my lord; for I warn  you, you will die by my hand; justice must be done.\"    The prince carefully examined the powder and shot, made sure that his  rifle was in good condition; loaded it, and, eager to make an end, took  aim at the fisherman; but, either because he had been so much disturbed  by his opponent's terrible tale, or, because the grass was wet from the  storm, at the moment when he put forward his left foot to steady his  shot, he slipped, lost his balance and fell on one knee. He fired into  the air.    \"That does not count, my lord,\" cried Gabriel instantly, and handed him  a second charge.    At the noise of the report Solomon had appeared at the window, and,  understanding what was going on, had lifted his hands to heaven, in  order to address to God a dumb and fervent prayer. Eligi uttered a  frightful inprecation, and hastily reloaded his rifle; but, struck by  the calm confidence of the young man, who stood motionless before him,  and by the old man, who, impassive and undisturbed, seemed to be  conjuring God in the name of a father's authority, disconcerted by his  fall, his knees shaking and his arm jarred, he felt the chills of death  running in his veins. Attempting, nevertheless, to master his emotion,  he took aim a second time; the bullet whistled by the fisherman's ear  and buried itself in the stem of a poplar.    The prince, with the energy of despair, seized the barrel of his weapon  in both hands; but Gabriel was coming forward with his axe, a terrible  foe, and his first stroke carried away the butt of the rifle. He was  still hesitating, however, to kill a defenceless man, when two armed  servants appeared at the end of the pathway. Gabriel did not see them  coming; but at the moment when they would have seized him by the  shoulders, Solomon uttered a cry and rushed to his son's assistance.    \"Help, Numa! help, Bonaroux! Death to the ruffians! They want to murder  me.\"    \"You lie, Prince of Brancaleone!\" cried Gabriel, and with one blow of  the axe he cleft his skull.    The two bravoes who were coming to their master's assistance, when they  saw him fall, took flight; Solomon and his son went up to Nisida's room.  The young girl had just shaken off her heavy slumber; a slight  perspiration moistened her brow, and she opened her eyes slowly to the  dawning day.    \"Why are you looking at me in that way, father?\" she said, her mind  still wandering a littler and she passed her hand over her forehead.    The old man embraced her tenderly.    \"You have just passed through a great danger, my poor Nisida,\" said he;  \"arise, and let us give thanks to the Madonna.\"    Then all three, kneeling before the sacred image of the Virgin, began to  recite litanies. But at that very instant a noise of arms sounded in the  enclosure, the house was surrounded by soldiers, and a lieutenant of  gendarmes, seizing Gabriel, said in a loud voice, \"In the name of the  law, I arrest you for the murder that you have just committed upon the  person of his excellency and illustrious lordship, the Prince of  Brancaleone.\"    Nisida, struck by these words, remained pale and motionless like a  marble statue kneeling on a tomb; Gabriel was already preparing to make  an unreasoning resistance, when a gesture from his father stopped him.    \"Signor tenente,\" said the old man, addressing himself to the officer,  \"my son killed the prince in lawful defence, for the latter had scaled  our house and made his way in at night and with arms in his hand. The  proofs are before your eyes. Here is a ladder set up against the window;  and here,\" he proceeded, picking up the two pieces of the broken blade,  \"is a dagger with the Brancaleone arms. However, we do not refuse to  follow you.\"    The last words of the fisherman were drowned by cries of \"Down with the  sbirri! down with the gendarmes!\" which were repeated in every  direction. The whole island was up in arms, and the fisher-folk would  have suffered themselves to be cut up to the last man before allowing a  single hair of Solomon or of his son to be touched; but the old man  appeared upon his threshold, and, stretching out his arm with a calm and  grave movement that quieted the anger of the crowd, he said, \"Thanks, my  children; the law must be respected. I shall be able, alone, to defend  the innocence of my son before the judges.\"    Hardly three months have elapsed since the day upon which we first  beheld the old fisherman of Nisida sitting before the door of his  dwelling, irradiated by all the happiness that he had succeeded in  creating around him, reigning like a king, on his throne of rock, and  blessing his two children, the most beautiful creatures in the island.  Now the whole existence of this man, who was once so happy and so much  envied, is changed. The smiling cottage, that hung over the gulf like a  swan over a transparent lake, is sad and desolate; the little enclosure,  with its hedges of lilac and hawthorn, where joyous groups used to come  and sit at the close of day, is silent and deserted. No human sound  dares to trouble the mourning of this saddened solitude. Only towards  evening the waves of the sea, compassionating such great misfortunes,  come to murmur plaintive notes upon the beach.    Gabriel has been condemned. The news of the high-born Prince of  Brancaleone's death, so young, so handsome, and so universally adored,  not only fluttered the aristocracy of Naples, but excited profound  indignation in all classes of people. He was mourned by everybody, and a  unanimous cry for vengeance was raised against the murderer.    The authorities opened the inquiry with alarming promptness. The  magistrates whom their office called to judge this deplorable affair  displayed, however, the most irreproachable integrity. No consideration  outside their duty, no"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2748"],[0,"Derues (#7)"],[1,"ers, Madame M.  Fr. C. D. V., etc. etc.    \"(Signed)      A. F. DERUES, Senior.\"    But all this dignity did not exclude the sheriff's officers, whom, as  befitted so great a man, he treated with the utmost insolence,  overwhelming them with abuse when they came to enforce an execution.  Such scandals had several times aroused the curiosity of his neighbours,  and did not redound to his credit. His landlord, wearied of all this  clamour, and most especially weary of never getting any rent without a  fight for it, gave him notice to quit. Derues removed to the rue  Beaubourg, where he continued to act as commission agent under the name  of Cyrano Derues de Bury.    And now we will concern ourselves no more with the unravelling of this  tissue of imposition; we will wander no longer in this labyrinth of  fraud, of low and vile intrigue, of dark crime of which the clue  disappears in the night, and of which the trace is lost in a doubtful  mixture of blood and mire; we will listen no longer to the cry of the  widow and her four children reduced to beggary, to the groans of obscure  victims, to the cries of terror and the death-groan which echoed one  night through the vaults of a country house near Beauvais. Behold other  victims whose cries are yet louder, behold yet other crimes and a  punishment which equals them in terror! Let these nameless ghosts, these  silent spectres, lose themselves in the clear daylight which now  appears, and make room for other phantoms which rend their shrouds and  issue from the tomb demanding vengeance.    Derues was now soon to have a chance of obtaining immortality. Hitherto  his blows had been struck by chance, henceforth he uses all the  resources of his infernal imagination; he concentrates all his strength  on one point--conceives and executes his crowning piece of wickedness.  He employs for two years all his science as cheat, forger, and poisoner  in extending the net which was to entangle a whole family; and, taken in  his own snare, he struggles in vain; in vain does he seek to gnaw  through the meshes which confine him. The foot placed on the last rung  of this ladder of crime, stands also on the first step by which he  mounts the scaffold.    About a mile from Villeneuve-le-Roi-les-Sens, there stood in 1775 a  handsome house, overlooking the windings of the Yonne on one side, and  on the other a garden and park belonging to the estate of Buisson-Souef.  It was a large property, admirably situated, and containing productive  fields, wood, and water; but not everywhere kept in good order, and  showing something of the embarrassed fortune of its owner. During some  years the only repairs had been those necessary in the house itself and  its immediate vicinity. Here and there pieces of dilapidated wall  threatened to fall altogether, and enormous stems of ivy had invaded and  stifled vigorous trees; in the remoter portions of the park briers  barred the road and made walking almost impossible. This disorder was  not destitute of charm, and at an epoch when landscape gardening  consisted chiefly in straight alleys, and in giving to nature a cold and  monotonous symmetry, one's eye rested with pleasure on these neglected  clumps, on these waters which had taken a different course to that which  art had assigned to them, on these unexpected and picturesque scenes.    A wide terrace, overlooking the winding river, extended along the front  of the house. Three men were walking on it-two priests, and the owner of  Buisson-Souef, Monsieur de Saint-Faust de Lamotte. One priest was the  cure of Villeneuve-le-Roi-lez-Sens, the other was a Camaldulian monk,  who had come to see the cure about a clerical matter, and who was  spending some days at the presbytery. The conversation did not appear to  be lively. Every now and then Monsieur de Lamotte stood still, and,  shading his eyes with his hand from the brilliant sunlight which flooded  the plain, and was strongly reflected from the water, endeavoured to see  if some new object had not appeared on the horizon, then slowly resumed  his walk with a movement of uneasy impatience. The tower clock struck  with a noisy resonance.    \"Six o'clock already!\" he exclaimed. \"They will assuredly not arrive  to-day.\"    \"Why despair?\" said the cure. \"Your servant has gone to meet them; we  might see their boat any moment.\"    \"But, my father,\" returned Monsieur de Lamotte, \"the long days are  already past. In another hour the mist will rise, and then they would  not venture on the river.\"    \"Well, if that happens, we shall have to be patient; they will stay all  night at some little distance, and you will see them to-morrow morning.\"    \"My brother is right,\" said the other priest. \"Come, monsieur; do not be  anxious.\"    \"You both speak with the indifference of persons to whom family troubles  are unknown.\"    \"What!\" said the cure, \"do you really think that because our sacred  profession condemns us both to celibacy, we are therefore unable to  comprehend an affection such as yours, on which I myself pronounced the  hallowing benediction of the Church--if you remember--nearly fifteen  years ago?\"    \"Is it perhaps intentionally, my father, that you recall the date of my  marriage? I readily admit that the love of one's neighbour may enlighten  you as to another love to which you have yourself been a stranger. I  daresay it seems odd to you that a man of my age should be anxious about  so little, as though he were a love-sick youth; but for some time past I  have had presentiments of evil, and I am really becoming superstitious!\"    He again stood still, gazing up the river, and, seeing nothing, resumed  his place between the two priests, who had continued their walk.    \"Yes,\" he continued, \"I have presentiments which refuse to be shaken  off. I am not so old that age can have weakened my powers and reduced me  to childishness, I cannot even say what I am afraid of, but separation  is painful and causes an involuntary terror. Strange, is it not?  Formerly, I used to leave my wife for months together, when she was  young and my son only, an infant; I loved her passionately, yet I could  go with pleasure. Why, I wonder, is it so different now? Why should a  journey to Paris on business, and a few hours' delay, make, me so  terribly uneasy? Do you remember, my father,\" he resumed, after a pause,  turning to the cure, \"do you remember how lovely Marie looked on our  wedding-day? Do you remember her dazzling complexion and the innocent  candour of her expression?--the sure token of the most truthful and  purest of minds! That is why I love her so much now; we do not now sigh  for one another, but the second love is stronger than the first, for it  is founded on recollection, and is tranquil and confident in friendship  . . . . It is strange that they have not returned; something must have  happened! If they do not return this evening, and I do not now think it  possible, I shall go to Paris myself to-morrow.\"    \"I think;\" said the other priest, \"that at twenty you must indeed have  been excitable, a veritable tinder-box, to have retained so much energy!  Come, monsieur, try to calm yourself and have patience: you yourself  admit it can only be a few hours' delay.\"    \"But my son accompanied his mother, and he is our only one, and so  delicate! He alone remains of our three children, and you do not realise  how the affection of parents who feel age approaching is concentrated on  an only child! If I lost Edouard I should die!\"    \"I suppose, then, as you let him go, his presence at Paris was  necessary?\"    \"No; his mother went to obtain a loan which is needed for the  improvements required on the estate.\"    \"Why, then, did you let him go?\"    \"I would willingly have kept him here, but his mother wished to take  him. A separation is as trying to her as to me, and we all but  quarrelled over it. I gave way.\"    \"There was one way of satisfying all three--you might have gone also.\"    \"Yes, but Monsieur le cure will tell you that a fortnight ago I was  chained to my arm-chair, swearing under my breath like a pagan, and  cursing the follies of my youth!--Forgive me, my father; I mean that I  had the gout, and I forgot that I am not the only sufferer, and that it  racks the old age of the philosopher quite as much as that of the  courtier.\"    The fresh wind which often rises just at sunset was already rustling in  the leaves; long shadows darkened the course of the Yonne and stretched  across the plain; the water, slightly troubled, reflected a confused  outline of its banks and the clouded blue of the sky. The three  gentlemen stopped at the end of the terrace and gazed into the already  fading distance. A black spot, which they had just observed in the  middle of the river, caught a gleam of light in passing a low meadow  between two hills, and for a moment took shape as a barge, then was lost  again, and could not be distinguished from the water. Another moment,  and it reappeared more distinctly; it was indeed a barge, and now the  horse could be seen towing it against the current. Again it was lost at  a bend of the river shaded by willows, and they had to resign themselves  to incertitude for several minutes. Then a white handkerchief was waved  on the prow of the boat, and Monsieur de Lamotte uttered a joyful  exclamation.    \"It is indeed they!\" he cried. \"Do you see them, Monsieur le cure? I see  my boy; he is waving the handkerchief, and his mother is with him. But I  think there is a third person--yes, there is a man, is there not? Look  well.\"    \"Indeed,\" said the cure, \"if my bad sight does not deceive me, I should  say there was someone seated near the rudder; but it looks like a  child.\"    \"Probably someone from the neighbourhood, who has profited by the chance  of a lift home.\"    The boat was advancing rapidly; they could now hear the cracking of the  whip with which the servant urged on the tow-horse. And now it stopped,  at an"]]]
