It was expected also that the Northern planters who came South in large  numbers in 1865-66 might, by controlling the Negro labor and by the  use of more efficient methods, aid in the economic upbuilding of the  country. But they were ignorant of agricultural matters and incapable of  wisely controlling the blacks; and they failed because at one time they  placed too much trust in the Negroes and at another treated them too  harshly and expected too much of them.    The question of Negro suffrage was not a live issue in the South until  the middle of 1866. There was almost no talk about it among the Negroes;  they did not know what it was. President Lincoln in 1864 and President  Johnson in 1865 had merely mentioned the subject, though Chief Justice  Chase and prominent radical members of Congress, as well as numerous  abolitionists, had framed a Negro suffrage platform. But the Southern  whites, considering the matter an impossibility, gave it little  consideration. There was, however, both North and South, a tendency to  see a connection between the freedom of the Negroes and their political  rights and thus to confuse civil equality with political and social  privileges. But the great masses of the whites were solidly opposed  to the recognition of Negro equality in any form. The poorer whites,  especially the \"Unionists\" who hoped to develop an opposition party,  were angered by any discussion of the subject. An Alabama \"Unionist,\"  M. J. Saffold, later prominent as a radical politician, declared to the  Joint Committee on Reconstruction: \"If you compel us to carry through  universal suffrage of colored, men... it will prove quite an *incubus  upon us in the organization of a national union party of white men;  it will furnish our opponents with a very effective weapon of offense  against us.\"    There were, however, some Southern leaders of ability and standing who,  by 1866, were willing to consider Negro suffrage. These men, among them  General Wade Hampton of South Carolina and Governor Robert Patton of  Alabama, were of the slaveholding class, and they fully counted on being  able to control the Negro's vote by methods similar to those actually  put in force a quarter of a century later. The Negroes were not as yet  politically organized were not even interested in politics, and the  master class might reasonably hope to regain control of them. Whitelaw  Reid published an interview with one of the Hamptons which describes the  situation exactly:    \"A brother of General Wade Hampton, the South Carolina Hotspur, was on  board. He saw no great objection to Negro suffrage, so far as the whites  were concerned; and for himself, South Carolinian and secessionist  though he was, he was quite willing to accept it. He only dreaded its  effect on the blacks themselves. Hitherto they had in the main, been  modest and respectful, and mere freedom was not likely to spoil them.  But the deference to them likely to be shown by partisans eager for  their votes would have a tendency to uplift them and unbalance them.  Beyond this, no harm would be done the South by Negro suffrage. The old  owners would cast the votes of their people almost as absolutely and  securely as they cast their own. If Northern men expected in this way to  build up a northern party in the South, they were gravely mistaken. They  would only be multiplying the power of the old and natural leaders of  Southern politics by giving every vote to a former slave. Heretofore  such men had served their masters only in the fields; now they would do  no less faithful service at the polls. If the North could stand it, the  South could. For himself, he should make no special objection to Negro  suffrage as one of the terms of reorganization, and if it came, he did  not think the South would have much cause to regret it.\"    To sum up the situation at this time: the Negro population at the close  of the war constituted a tremendous problem for those in authority. The  race was free, but without status, without leaders, without property,  and without education. Probably a fourth of them had some experience in  freedom before the Confederate armies surrendered, and the servitude of  the other three millions ended very quickly and without violence. But in  the Black Belt, where the bulk of the black population was to be found,  the labor system was broken up, and for several months the bewildered  freedmen wandered about or remained at home under conditions which were  bad for health, morals, and thrift. The Northern Negroes did not furnish  the expected leadership for the race, and the more capable men in the  South showed a tendency to go North. The unsettled state of the Negroes  and their expectation of receiving a part of the property of the whites  kept the latter uneasy and furnished the occasion of frequent conflicts.  Not the least of the unsettling influences at work upon the Negro  population were the colored troops and the agitators furnished by the  Freedmen's Bureau, the missions, and the Bureau schools. But at the  beginning of the year 1866, the situation appeared to be clearing, and  the social and economic revolution seemed on the way to a quieter ending  than might have been expected.        CHAPTER III. THE WORK OF THE PRESIDENTS    The war ended slavery, but it left the problem of the freed slave;  it preserved the Union in theory, but it left unsolved many delicate  problems of readjustment. Were the seceded States in or out of the  Union? If in the Union, what rights had they? If they were not in  the Union, what was their status? What was the status of the Southern  Unionist, of the ex-Confederate? What punishments should be inflicted  upon the Southern people? What authority, executive or legislative,  should carry out the work of reconstruction? The end of the war  brought with it, in spite of much discussion, no clear answer to these  perplexing questions.    Unfortunately, American political life, with its controversies over  colonial government, its conflicting interpretations of written  constitutions, and its legally trained statesmen, had by the middle  of the nineteenth century produced a habit of political thought which  demanded the settlement of most governmental matters upon a theoretical  basis. And now in 1865, each prominent leader had his own plan of  reconstruction fundamentally irreconcilable with all the others, because  rigidly theoretical. During the war the powers of the executive had  been greatly expanded and a legislative reaction was to be expected. The  Constitution called for fresh interpretation in the light of the Civil  War and its results.    The first theory of reconstruction may be found in the  Crittenden-Johnson resolutions of July 1861, which declared that the war  was being waged to maintain the Union under the Constitution and that  it should cease when these objects were obtained. This would have  been subscribed to in 1861 by the Union Democrats and by most of the  Republicans, and in 1865 the conquered Southerners would have been glad  to reenter the Union upon this basis; but though in 1865 the resolution  still expressed the views of many Democrats, the majority of Northern  people had moved away from this position.    The attitude of Lincoln, which in 1865 met the views of a majority of  the Northern people though not of the political leaders, was that \"no  State can upon its mere motion get out of the Union,\" that the States  survived though there might be some doubt about state governments, and  that \"loyal\" state organizations might be established by a population  consisting largely of ex-Confederates who had been pardoned by the  President and made \"loyal\" for the future by an oath of allegiance.  Reconstruction was, Lincoln thought, a matter for the executive to  handle. But that he was not inflexibly committed to any one plan is  indicated by his proclamation after the pocket veto of the Wade-Davis  Bill and by his last speech, in which he declared that the question of  whether the seceded States were in the Union or out of it was \"merely a  pernicious abstraction.\" In addition, Lincoln said:    \"We are all agreed that the seceded States, so called, are out of their  proper practical relation with the Union, and that the sole object of  the government, civil and military, in regard to those States is to  again get them into that proper practical relation. I believe that it  is not only possible, but in fact easier, to do this without deciding or  even considering whether these States have ever been out of the Union,  than with it. Finding themselves safely at home, it would be utterly  immaterial whether they had ever been abroad. Let us all join in doing  the acts necessary to restore the proper practical relations between  these States and the Union, and each forever after innocently indulge  his own opinion whether in doing the acts he brought the States from  without into the Union, or only gave them proper assistance, they never  having been out of it.\"    President Johnson's position was essentially that of Lincoln, but his  attitude toward the working out of the several problems was different.  He maintained that the states survived and that it was the duty of the  executive to restore them to their proper relations. \"The true theory,\"  said he, \"is that all pretended acts of secession were from the  beginning null and void. The States cannot commit treason nor screen  individual citizens who may have committed treason any more than they  can make valid treaties or engage in lawful commerce with any foreign  power. The states attempting to secede placed themselves in a condition  where their vitality was impaired, but not extinguished; their functions  suspended, but not destroyed.\" Lincoln would have had "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2898"],[0,"Pioneers of the Old South: A Chronicle of English Colonial Beginnings (#7)"],[1,"\"making them,\" says the relation, \"like blackamoors  dusted over with silver.\" The white men filled their boat with as much  of this ore as they could carry. High were their hopes over it, but  when it was subsequently sent to London and assayed, it was found to be  worthless.    The fifteen now started homeward, out of Potomac and down the westward  side of Chesapeake. In their travels they saw, besides the Indians, all  manner of four-footed Virginians. Bears rolled their bulk through these  forests; deer went whither they would. The explorers might meet foxes  and catamounts, otter, beaver and marten, raccoon and opossum, wolf and  Indian dog. Winged Virginians made the forests vocal. The owl hooted  at night, and the whippoorwill called in the twilight. The streams  were filled with fish. Coming to the mouth of the Rappahannock, the  travelers' boat grounded upon sand, with the tide at ebb. Awaiting the  water that should lift them off, the fifteen began with their swords to  spear the fish among the reeds. Smith had the ill luck to encounter a  sting-ray, and received its barbed weapon through his wrist. There set  in a great swelling and torment which made him fear that death was at  hand. He ordered his funeral and a grave to be dug on a neighboring  islet. Yet by degrees he grew better and so out of torment, and withal  so hungry that he longed for supper, whereupon, with a light heart, he  had his late enemy the sting-ray cooked and ate him. They then named the  place Sting-ray Island and, the tide serving, got off the sand-bar and  down the bay, and so came home to Jamestown, having been gone seven  weeks.    Like Ulysses, Smith refuses to rust in inaction. A few days, and away  he is again, first up to Rappahannock, and then across the bay. On this  journey he and his men come up with the giant Susquehannocks, who are  not Algonquins but Iroquois. After many hazards in which the forest  and the savage play their part, Smith and his band again return to  Jamestown. In all this adventuring they have gained much knowledge of  the country and its inhabitants--but yet no gold, and no further news of  the South Sea or of far Cathay.    It was now September and the second summer with its toll of fever  victims was well-nigh over. Autumn and renewed energy were at hand. All  the land turned crimson and gold. At Jamestown building went forward,  together with the gathering of ripened crops, the felling of trees,  fishing and fowling, and trading for Indian corn and turkeys.    One day George Percy, heading a trading party down the river, saw coming  toward him a white sailed ship, the Mary and Margaret-it was Christopher  Newport again, with the second supply. Seventy colonists came over on  the Mary and Margaret, among them a fair number of men of note. Here  were Captain Peter Wynne and Richard Waldo, \"old soldiers and valiant  gentlemen,\" Francis West, young brother of the Lord De La Warr, Rawley  Crashaw, John Codrington, Daniel Tucker, and others. This is indeed an  important ship. Among the laborers, the London Council had sent eight  Poles and Germans, skilled in their own country in the production of  pitch, tar, glass, and soap-ashes. Here, then, begin in Virginia other  blood strains than the English. And in the Mary and Margaret comes with  Master Thomas Forest his wife, Mistress Forest, and her maid, by name  Anne Burras. Apart from those lost ones of Raleigh's colony at Roanoke,  these are the first Englishwomen in Virginia. There may be guessed what  welcome they got, how much was made of them.    Christopher Newport had from that impatient London Council somewhat  strange orders. He was not to return without a lump of gold, or a  certain discovery of waters pouring into the South Sea, or some notion  gained of the fate of the lost colony of Roanoke. He had been given a  barge which could be taken to pieces and so borne around those Falls of  the Far West, then put together, and the voyage to the Pacific resumed.  Moreover, he had for Powhatan, whom the minds at home figured as a sort  of Asiatic Despot, a gilt crown and a fine ewer and basin, a bedstead,  and a gorgeous robe.    The easiest task, that of delivering Powhatan's present and placing  an idle crown upon that Indian's head who, among his own people, was  already sufficiently supreme, might be and was performed. And Newport  with a large party went again to the Falls of the Far West and miles  deep into the country beyond. Here they found Indians outside the  Powhatan Confederacy, but no South Sea, nor mines of gold and silver,  nor any news of the lost colony of Roanoke. In December Newport left  Virginia in the Mary and Margaret, and with him sailed Ratcliffe. Smith  succeeded to the presidency.    About this time John Laydon, a laborer, and Anne Burras, that maid of  Mistress Forest's, fell in love and would marry. So came about the first  English wedding in Virginia.    Winter followed with snow and ice, nigh two hundred people to feed, and  not overmuch in the larder with which to do it. Smith with George  Percy and Francis West and others went again to the Indians for  corn. Christmas found them weather-bound at Kecoughtan. \"Wherever an  Englishman may be, and in whatever part of the world, he must keep  Christmas with feasting and merriment! And, indeed, we were never more  merrie, nor fedde on more plentie of good oysters, fish, flesh, wild  fowle and good bread; nor never had better fires in England than in the  drie, smokie houses of Kecoughtan!\"    But despite this Christmas fare, there soon began quarrels, many and  intricate, with Powhatan and his brother Opechancanough.        CHAPTER V. THE \"SEA ADVENTURE\"    Experience is a great teacher. That London Company with Virginia to  colonize had now come to see how inadequate to the attempt were its  means and strength. Evidently it might be long before either gold mines  or the South Sea could be found. The company's ships were too slight and  few; colonists were going by the single handful when they should go by  the double. Something was at fault in the management of the enterprise.  The quarrels in Virginia were too constant, the disasters too frequent.  More money, more persons interested with purse and mind, a great  company instead of a small, a national cast to the enterprise these were  imperative needs. In the press of such demands the London Company passed  away. In 1609 under new letters patent was born the Virginia Company.    The members and shareholders in this corporation touch through and  through the body of England at that day. First names upon the roll come  Robert Cecil, Thomas Howard, Henry Wriothesley, William Herbert, Henry  Clinton, Richard Sackville, Thomas Cecil, Philip Herbert--Earls of  Salisbury, Suffolk, Southampton, Pembroke, Lincoln, Dorset, Exeter,  and Montgomery. Then follow a dozen peers, the Lord Bishop of Bath and  Wells, a hundred knights, many gentlemen, one hundred and ten merchants,  certain physicians and clergymen, old soldiers of the Continental wars,  sea-captains and mariners, and a small host of the unclassified. In  addition shares were taken by fifty-six London guilds or industrial  companies. Here are the Companies of the Tallow and Wax Chandlers, the  Armorers and Girdlers, Cordwayners and Carpenters, Masons, Plumbers,  Founders, Poulterers, Cooks, Coopers, Tylers and Brick Layers, Bowyers  and Vinters, Merchant Taylors, Blacksmiths and Weavers, Mercers,  Grocers, Turners, Gardeners, Dyers, Scriveners, Fruiterers, Plaisterers,  Brown Bakers, Imbroiderers, Musicians, and many more.    The first Council appointed by the new charter had fifty-two members,  fourteen of whom sat in the English House of Lords, and twice that  number in the Commons. Thus was Virginia well linked to Crown and  Parliament.    This great commercial company had sovereign powers within Virginia. The  King should have his fifth part of all ore of gold and silver; the laws  and religion of England should be upheld, and no man let go to Virginia  who had not first taken the oath of supremacy. But in the wide field  beside all this the President--called the Treasurer--and the Council,  henceforth to be chosen out of and by the whole body of subscribers,  had full sway. No longer should there be a second Council sitting in  Virginia, but a Governor with power, answerable only to the Company at  home. That Company might tax and legislate within the Virginian field,  punish the ill-doer or \"rebel,\" and wage war, if need be, against Indian  or Spaniard:    One of the first actions of the newly constituted body was to seek  remedy for the customary passage by way of the West Indies--so long and  so beset by dangers. They sent forth a small ship under Captain Samuel  Argall, with instructions \"to attempt a direct and cleare passage, by  leaving the Canaries to the East, and from thence to run a straight  westerne course.... And so to make an experience of the Winds and  Currents which have affrighted all undertakers by the North.\"    This Argall, a young man with a stirring and adventurous life behind him  and before him, took his ship the indicated way. He made the voyage  in nine weeks, of which two were spent becalmed, and upon his return  reported that it might be made in seven, \"and no apparent inconvenience  in the way.\" He brought to the great Council of the Company a story of  necessity and distress at Jamestown, and the Council lays much of the  blame for that upon \"the misgovernment of the Commanders, by dissention  and ambition among themselves,\" and upon the idleness of the general  run, \"active in nothing but adhearing to factions and parts.\" The  Council, sitting afar from a savage land, is probably much too severe.  But the \"factions and parts\" cannot easily be denied.    Before Argall's return, the Company had commissioned as Governor of  Virginia Sir Thomas Gates, and had gathered a fleet of seven ships and  two pinnaces with Sir George"]]]
