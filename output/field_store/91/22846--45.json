[16] Stephen, _History of Criminal Law_, II, 431, says of this act:  \"Hutchinson suggests that this act, which was passed two years after the  act of the Six Articles, was intended as a 'hank upon the reformers,'  that the part of it to which importance was attached was the pulling  down of crosses, which, it seems, was supposed to be practised in  connection with magic. Hutchinson adds that the act was never put into  execution either against witches or reformers. The act was certainly  passed during that period of Henry's reign when he was inclining in the  Roman Catholic direction.\" The part of the act to which Hutchinson  refers reads as follows: \"And for execucion of their saide falce devyses  and practises have made or caused to be made dyvers Images and pictures  of men, women, childrene, Angelles or develles, beastes or fowles, ...  and gyving faithe and credit to suche fantasticall practises have dygged  up and pulled downe an infinite nombre of Crosses within this Realme.\"    [17] _Parliamentary History_ (London, 1751-1762), III, 229.

[20] The measure in fact reached the engrossing stage in the Commons.  Both houses, however, adjourned early in April and left it unpassed.    [21] Several of the bishops who were appointed on Elizabeth's accession  had travelled in South Germany and Switzerland during the Marian period  and had the opportunity of familiarizing themselves with the propaganda  in these parts against witches. Thomas Bentham, who was to be bishop of  Coventry and Lichfield, had retired from England to Zurich and had  afterwards been preacher to the exiles at Basel. John Parkhurst,  appointed bishop of Norwich, had settled in Zurich on Mary's accession.  John Scory, appointed bishop of Hereford, had served as chaplain to the  exiles in Geneva. Richard Cox, appointed bishop of Ely, had visited  Frankfort and Strassburg. Edmund Grindall, who was to be the new bishop  of London, had, during his exile, visited Strassburg, Speier, and  Frankfort. Miles Coverdale, who had been bishop of Exeter but who was  not reappointed, had been in Geneva in the course of his exile. There  were many other churchmen of less importance who at one time or another  during the Marian period visited Zurich. See Bullinger's _Diarium_  (Basel, 1904) and Pellican's _Chronikon_ (Basel, 1877), _passim_, as  also Theodor Vetter, _Relations between England and Zurich during the  Reformation_ (London, 1904). At Strassburg the persecution raged  somewhat later; but how thoroughly Bucer and his colleagues approved and  urged it is clear from a letter of advice addressed by them in 1538 to  their fellow pastor Schwebel, of Zweibruecken (printed as No. 88 in the  _Centuria Epistolarum_ appended to Schwebel's _Scripta Theologica_,  Zweibruecken, 1605). That Bucer while in England (1549-1551) found also  occasion to utter these views can hardly be doubted. These details I owe  to Professor Burr.    [22] Various dates have been assigned for Jewel's sermon, but it can be  determined approximately from a passage in the discourse. In the course  of the sermon he remarked: \"I would wish that once again, as time should  serve, there might be had a quiet and sober disputation, that each part  might be required to shew their grounds without self will and without  affection, not to maintain or breed contention, ... but only that the  truth may be known.... For, at the last disputation that should have  been, you know which party gave over and would not meddle.\" This is  clearly an allusion to the Westminster disputation of the last of March,  1559; see John Strype, _Annals of the Reformation_ (London, 1709-1731;  Oxford, 1824), ed. of 1824, I, pt. i, 128. The sermon therefore was  preached after that disputation. It may be further inferred that it was  preached before Jewel's controversy with Cole in March, 1560. The words,  \"For at the last disputation ... you know which party gave over and  would not meddle,\" were hardly written after Cole accepted Jewel's  challenge. It was on the second Sunday before Easter (March 17), 1560,  that Jewel delivered at court the discourse in which he challenged  dispute on four points of church doctrine. On the next day Henry Cole  addressed him a letter in which he asked him why he \"yesterday in the  Court and at all other times at Paul's Cross\" offered rather to \"dispute  in these four points than in the chief matters that lie in question  betwixt the Church of Rome and the Protestants.\" In replying to Cole on  the 20th of March Jewel wrote that he stood only upon the negative and  again mentioned his offer. On the 31st of March he repeated his  challenge upon the four points, and upon this occasion went very much  into detail in supporting them. Now, in the sermon which we are trying  to date, the sermon in which allusion is made to the prevalence of  witches, the four points are briefly named. It may be reasonably  conjectured that this sermon anticipated the elaboration of the four  points as well as the challenging sermon of March 17. It is as certain  that it was delivered after Jewel's return to London from his visitation  in the west country. On November 2, 1559, he wrote to Peter Martyr: \"I  have at last returned to London, with a body worn out by a most  fatiguing journey.\" See _Zurich Letters_, I (Parker Soc., Cambridge,  1842), 44. It is interesting and significant that he adds: \"We found in  all places votive relics of saints, nails with which the infatuated  people dreamed that Christ had been pierced, and I know not what small  fragments of the sacred cross. The number of witches and sorceresses had  everywhere become enormous.\" Jewel was consecrated Bishop of Salisbury  in the following January, having been nominated in the summer of 1559  just before his western visitation. The sermon in which he alluded to  witches may have been preached at any time after he returned from the  west, November 2, and before March 17. It would be entirely natural that  in a court sermon delivered by the newly appointed bishop of Salisbury  the prevalence of witchcraft should be mentioned. It does not seem a  rash guess that the sermon was preached soon after his return, perhaps  in December, when the impression of what he had seen in the west was  still fresh in his memory. But it is not necessary to make this  supposition. Though the discourse was delivered some time after March  15, 1559, when the first bill \"against Conjurations, Prophecies, etc.,\"  was brought before the Commons (see _Journal of the House of Commons_,  I, 57), it is not unreasonable to believe that there was some connection  between the discourse and the fortunes of this bill. That connection  seems the more probable on a careful reading of the Commons Journals for  the first sessions of Elizabeth's Parliament. It is evident that the  Elizabethan legislators were working in close cooperation with the  ecclesiastical authorities. Jewel's sermon may be found in his _Works_  (ed. for the Parker Soc., Cambridge, 1845-1850), II, 1025-1034. (For the  correspondence with Cole see I, 26 ff.)    For assistance in dating this sermon the writer wishes to express his  special obligation to Professor Burr.    [23] Strype, _Annals of the Reformation_, I, pt. i, 11. He may, indeed,  mean to ascribe it, not to the sermon, but to the evils alleged by the  sermon.    [24] In the contemporary account entitled _A True and just Recorde of  the Information, Examination, and Confession of all the Witches taken at  St. Oses.... Written ... by W. W._ (1582), next leaf after B 5, we read:  \"there is a man of great cunning and knowledge come over lately unto our  Queenes Maiestie, which hath advertised her what a companie and number  of witches be within Englande.\" This probably refers to Jewel.    [25] See _ibid._, B 5 verso: \"I and other of her Justices have received  commission for the apprehending of as many as are within these limites.\"  This was written later, but the event is referred to as following what  must have been Bishop Jewel's sermon.

Hardest of all is the case of the woman who longs not merely for  wifehood and 'a kind man,' but more especially for motherhood, the  bitter-sweet crown of the sex that celibate priests preach ceaselessly  as woman's first duty and highest good, but which thousands of women in  this country are debarred from fulfilling! Surely no bitterness must  be so poignant as the bitterness of the woman who longs for  motherhood--ceaselessly in her ears the Life Force is calling, and deep  in her heart the dream children are stirring, crying, 'Give us life!  give us life!' becoming more importunate every year, as each year finds  the divine possibilities unrealised.    I often think how everything combines to torment a generous-hearted,  full-blooded, mother-woman whose nature is starved thus. She has, of  course, to suppress all emotion on the subject, to hold her head high,  and endure with a smile the 'experienced' airs of girls, much younger  than herself, who happen to wear that magical golden ring that changes  all life for a woman; to pretend generally that she has no wish to  marry, never had, and could have if she chose, to laugh at this page if  she should happen to read it, and call the writer a morbid idiot--in  short, she always has to act a part before a world which professes to  find exquisitely humorous the fact of a woman being cheated out of the  birthright of her sex. Every paper and book she picks up nowadays  contains some reference to the glories of motherhood, the joys of love.  Music, pictures, novels and plays, all speak of sex fulfilled and  triumphant, not starved and denied like hers. The same principle is  everywhere in Nature--the sky, the sea, the flowers, the green trees,  the sound of summer rain--all beautiful sights and sounds have the same  meaning, the same burden, the same sharp sting for her. If she is  inclined to be morbid, every child's face seen in the street turns the  knife in the wound; every sweet baby's cooing is another pang. 'Not for  me--not for me!' must be the perpetual refrain in her mind. Her arms are  empty, her heart is cold; she belongs to the vast, sad army of the  undesired.    _Do you wonder the madhouses are full of single women?_       *   *   *    NOTE.--A clever and delightful friend of mine, a spinster by choice,  takes exception to my views on the single estate. I should be deeply  grieved if any words of mine were to cause pain to other women. I have  said before that some of the best women are spinsters, which is sad to a  believer in marriage like myself. Two of the sweetest and noblest women  I know are unmarried; one of them especially seems absolutely without a  thought of self, and has worked hard for others all her life, giving her  powers of brain and body to their utmost limit, and the treasures of her  beautiful heart generously and without stint. I beg my readers to note  that I have tried to differentiate between those spinsters who do not  want to marry and those who do; between the rich spinster who can  command all the amenities of life, and the poor one compelled to a  relentless and unceasing round of uncongenial toil. Still more do I wish  to distinguish between the placid contented woman who can adapt herself  to circumstances and find a quiet sort of happiness in any life--and the  less well-balanced, more passionate natures, with deeper desires and an  imperious need of loving. It is this need of loving stifled, crushed and  fought against that awakens my profound compassion--a compassion which  my friend informs me is wasted and misplaced. My readers must judge.            PART II      CAUSES OF FAILURE        'For Marriage is like Life in this, that it is a field of battle,    not a bed of roses.' --R. L. STEVENSON.      'Marriage is to me apostasy, profanation of the sanctuary of my    soul, violation of my manhood, sale of my birthright, shameful    surrender, ignominious capitulation, acceptance of defeat.'      --_Man and Superman._      'A wise man should avoid married life, as though it were a burning    pit of live coals.' --_Dhammika Sutta._            I      THE VARIOUS KINDS OF MARRIAGE      'Marriage is the great mistake that wipes out the smaller    stupidities of Love.' --SCHOPENHAUER.      In one of his essays Stevenson says: 'I am so often filled with wonder  that so many marriages are passable successes, and so few come to open  failure, the more so as I fail to understand the principle on which  people regulate their choice.'    Out of the chaos which envelops this 'principle' four special motives  seem to stand out, and we can therefore roughly divide the marriages  that take place into five sections thus--      1. The Marriage of Passion.    2. The Marriage of Convenience.    3. Marriage for a Purpose.    4. Haphazard Marriage.    5. The Marriage of Affection.       *   *   *    _The Marriage of Passion._--One of Mr Somerset Maugham's characters in  _The Merry-Go-Round_ says: 'I'm convinced that marriage is the most  terrible thing in the world, unless passion makes it absolutely  inevitable.' Although a profound admirer of Mr Maugham's work, here I  find myself entirely at variance with him. Most of the mad, unreasonable  matches are those which 'passion makes inevitable.' Theoretically this  is one of the most promising types of marriage--in practice it proves  the most fatally unhappy of all. 'They're madly in love with each other,  it's an ideal match' is a comment one often hears expressed with much  satisfaction, but it is a painful fact that these desperate loves lead  very frequently to disaster and divorce. Most of the miserable married  couples personally known to me were 'madly in love' with each other at  the start.    Is it to be wondered at when one considers the matter? Nature, who  seldom makes a mistake where primitive mankind is concerned is by no  means infallible when dealing with the artificial conditions of our  Western civilisation. In the East where greater sex licence is allowed,  it seems quite safe to trust Nature and follow the instincts she  implants. Not so in our hemisphere. The young man and maid who fall  under passion's thrall are temporarily blind and mad; their judgment is  obscured, their reasoning powers non-existent, nothing in the world  seems of the slightest importance except the overwhelming necessity _to  give_ themselves--_to possess_ the beloved, the being who has fired  their blood.    If the Fates are cruel, these two are permitted to rush into matrimony.  Nature has worked her will and pays no more heed. She is well-satisfied:  the children born of these unions of utter madness are generally the  finest and strongest, and what else does Nature care about? But for the  young couple? . . . Gradually the roseate clouds lift, the intoxicating  fumes are wafted away--the rapture subsides, and each awakes from the  effects of the most potent drug in the universe to find a very ordinary  young person at their side--and around them a chain which men name  'Forever!'    Unhappy indeed are these two if, when they stand facing each other over  passion's grave, there proves to be no link at all between them except  the memory of the madness that has died. Fortunately this is by no means  always the case, but when it is a very unhappy married life must  inevitably follow. Schopenhauer gives as the reason for such matches  proving unhappy the fact that their participants look after 'the welfare  of the future generation at the expense of the present,' and quotes the  Spanish proverb, 'He who marries for love must live in grief.' From the  point of view of the individual's interest, and not that of the future  generation, it certainly seems a mistake to wed the object of intense  desire unless there is also spiritual harmony, community of tastes and  interests, and many other points of union in common. But under the  influence of suppressed passion people lose their clearness of mental  vision and are therefore more or less incapable of judging.    Let there be passion in marriage by all means--so far I entirely agree  with Mr Maugham--but let it be merely the outer covering of love--a  garment of flame the embrace of which is ecstasy indeed, but which, when  it has burnt itself away, still leaves love a solid form of joy and  beauty, erect beneath its ashes. 'Real friendship,' founded on harmony  of sentiment, does not exist until the instinct of sex has been  extinguished.[2]        [Footnote 2: Schopenhauer's _Metaphysics of Love_.]       *   *   *    _Marriages of Convenience_ are of two kinds, the wholly sordid, when  money, social position, or some personal aggrandisement has been the  motive on one or both sides, without any basis of affection; and the  partially-sordid, when these reasons are modified by some existing  affection or liking. In this category come the people who marry  principally in the interests of their business or profession, such as  the barrister who weds the solicitor's daughter, or the young doctor who  marries into the old doctor's family. In this connection one recalls the  father who advised his sons not to marry for money, but to love where  money was. No doubt the possession of a little money or 'influence' is  an added attraction to a maiden's charm in the eyes of the go-ahead  young man of to-day; and considering how hard it appears to be to earn a  living nowadays one cannot altogether blame them--distressing as it  seems from the sentimental point of view. I don't believe, however, that  there are so many wholly sordid marriages outside the confines of the  set generally prefixed as 'smart.' People who are not members of this  glittering circle are already sufficiently shy of matrimony"]]]
