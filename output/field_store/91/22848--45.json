She was too  taut and quiet, working her share but seldom contributing a word--we  were not yet in mountain country. So far she was quiet and touchy with  me, although she seemed natural enough with the Darkovans, and I let her  alone.    \"Hi, Jason, get a move on,\" someone shouted, and I walked back toward  the clearing squinting in the sun. It hurt, and I touched my face  gingerly, suddenly realizing what had happened. Yesterday, riding in the  uncovered truck, and this morning, un-used to the fierce sun of these  latitudes, I had neglected to take the proper precautions against  exposure and my face was reddening with sunburn. I walked toward Kyla,  who was cinching a final load on one of the pack-animals, which she did  efficiently enough.    She didn't wait for me to ask, but sized up the situation with one  amused glance at my face. \"Sunburn? Put some of this on it.\" She  produced a tube of white stuff; I twisted at the top inexpertly, and she  took it from me, squeezed the stuff out in her palm and said, \"Stand  still and bend down your head.\"    She smeared the mixture efficiently across my forehead and cheeks. It  felt cold and good. I started to thank her, then broke off as she burst  out laughing. \"What's the matter?\"    \"You should see yourself!\" she gurgled.    I wasn't amused. No doubt I presented a grotesque appearance, and no  doubt she had the right to laugh at it, but I scowled. It hurt.  Intending to put things back on the proper footing, I demanded, \"Did you  make up the climbing loads?\"    \"All except bedding. I wasn't sure how much to allow,\" she said. \"Jason,  have you eyeshades for when you get on snow?\" I nodded, and she  instructed me severely, \"Don't forget them. Snowblindness--I give you my  word--is even more unpleasant than sunburn--and _very_ painful!\"    \"Damn it, girl, I'm not stupid!\" I exploded.    She said, in her expressionless monotone again, \"Then you _ought_ to  have known better than to get sunburnt. Here, put this in your pocket,\"  she handed me the tube of sunburn cream, \"maybe I'd better check up on  some of the others and make sure they haven't forgotten.\" She went off  without another word, leaving me with an unpleasant feeling that she'd  come off best, that she considered me an irresponsible scamp.    Forth had said almost the same thing....    I told off the Darkovan brothers to urge the pack animals across the  narrowest part of the ford, and gestured to Corus and Kyla to ride one  on either side of Kendricks, who might not be aware of the swirling,  treacherous currents of a mountain river. Rafe could not urge his edgy  horse into the water; he finally dismounted, took off his boots, and led  the creature across the slippery rocks. I crossed last, riding close to  Regis Hastur, alert for dangers and thinking resentfully that anyone so  important to Darkover's policies should not be risked on such a mission.  Why, if the Terran Legate had (unthinkably!) come with us, he would be  surrounded by bodyguards, secret service men and dozens of precautions  against accident, assassination or misadventure.    All that day we rode upward, encamping at the furthest point we could  travel with pack animals or mounted. The next day's climb would enter  the dangerous trails we must travel afoot. We pitched a comfortable  camp, but I admit I slept badly. Kendricks and Lerrys and Rafe had  blinding headaches from the sun and the thinness of the air; I was more  used to these conditions, but I felt a sense of unpleasant pressure, and  my ears rang. Regis arrogantly denied any discomfort, but he moaned and  cried out continuously in his sleep until Lerrys kicked him, after which  he was silent and, I feared, sleepless. Kyla seemed the least affected  of any; probably she had been at higher altitudes more continuously than  any of us. But there were dark circles beneath her eyes.    However, no one complained as we readied ourselves for the final last  long climb upward. If we were fortunate, we could cross Dammerung before  nightfall; at the very least, we should bivouac tonight very near the  pass. Our camp had been made at the last level spot; we partially  hobbled the pack animals so they would not stray too far, and left ample  food for them, and cached all but the most necessary of light trail  gear. As we prepared to start upward on the steep, narrow track--hardly  more than a rabbit-run--I glanced at Kyla and stated, \"We'll work on  rope from the first stretch. Starting now.\"    One of the Darkovan brothers stared at me with contempt. \"Call yourself  a mountain man, Jason? Why, my little daughter could scramble up _that_  track without so much as a push on her behind!\"    I set my chin and glared at him. \"The rocks aren't easy, and some of  these men aren't used to working on rope at all. We might as well get  used to it, because when we start working along the ledges, I don't want  anybody who doesn't know how.\"    They still didn't like it, but nobody protested further until I directed  the huge Kendricks to the center of the second rope. He glared viciously  at the light nylon line and demanded in some apprehension, \"Hadn't I  better go last until I know what I'm doing? Hemmed in between the two of  you, I'm apt to do something damned dumb!\"    Hjalmar roared with laughter and informed him that the center place on a  3-man rope was always reserved for weaklings, novices and amateurs. I  expected Kendricks' temper to flare up: the burly Spaceforce man and the  Darkovan giant glared at one another, then Kendricks only shrugged and  knotted the line through his belt. Kyla warned Kendricks and Lerrys  about looking down from ledges, and we started.    The first stretch was almost too simple, a clear track winding higher  and higher for a couple of miles. Pausing to rest for a moment, we could  turn and see the entire valley outspread below us. Gradually the trail  grew steeper, in spots pitched almost at a 50-degree angle, and was  scattered with gravel, loose rock and shale, so that we placed our feet  carefully, leaning forward to catch at handholds and steady ourselves  against rocks. I tested each boulder carefully, since any weight placed  against an unsteady rock might dislodge it on somebody below. One of the  Darkovan brothers--Vardo, I thought--was behind me, separated by ten or  twelve feet of slack rope, and twice when his feet slipped on gravel he  stumbled and gave me an unpleasant jerk. What he muttered was perfectly  true; on slopes like this, where a fall wasn't dangerous anyhow, it was  better to work unroped; then a slip bothered no one but the slipper.  But I was finding out what I wanted to know--what kind of climbers I had  to lead through the Hellers.    Along a cliff face the trail narrowed horizontally, leading across a  foot-wide ledge overhanging a sheer drop of fifty feet and covered with  loose shale and scrub plants. Nothing, of course, to an experienced  climber--a foot-wide ledge might as well be a four-lane superhighway.  Kendricks made a nervous joke about a tightrope walker, but when his  turn came he picked his way securely, without losing balance. The  amateurs--Lerrys Ridenow, Regis, Rafe--came across without hesitation,  but I wondered how well they would have done at a less secure altitude;  to a real mountaineer, a footpath is a footpath, whether in a meadow,  above a two-foot drop, a thirty-foot ledge, or a sheer mountain face  three miles above the first level spot.    After crossing the ledge the going was harder. A steeper trail, in  places nearly imperceptible, led between thick scrub and overhanging  trees, thickly forested. In spots their twisted roots obscured the  trail; in others the persistent growth had thrust aside rocks and dirt.  We had to make our way through tangles of underbrush which would have  been nothing to a trailman, but which made our ground-accustomed bodies  ache with the effort of getting over or through them; and once the track  was totally blocked by a barricade of tangled dead brushwood, borne down  on floodwater after a sudden thaw or cloud-burst. We had to work  painfully around it over a three-hundred-foot rockslide, which we could  cross only one at a time, crab-fashion, leaning double to balance  ourselves; and no one complained now about the rope.    Toward noon I had the first intimation that we were not alone on the  slope.    At first it was no more than a glimpse of motion out of the corner of my  eyes, the shadow of a shadow. The fourth time I saw it, I called softly  to Kyla: \"See anything?\"    \"I was beginning to think it was my eyes, or the altitude. I saw,  Jason.\"    \"Look for a spot where we can take a break,\" I directed. We climbed  along a shallow ledge, the faint imperceptible flutters in the brushwood  climbing with us on either side. I muttered to the girl, \"I'll be glad  when we get clear of this. At least we'll be able to see what's coming  after us!\"    \"If it comes to a fight,\" she said surprisingly, \"I'd rather fight on  gravel than ice.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Over a rise, there was a roaring sound; Kyla swung up and balanced on a  rock-wedged tree root, cupped her mouth to her hands and called,  \"Rapids!\"    I pulled myself up to the edge of the drop and stood looking down into  the narrow gully. Here the narrow track we had been following was  crossed and obscured by the deep, roaring rapids of a mountain stream.    Less than twenty feet across, it tumbled in an icy flood, almost a  waterfall, pitching over the lip of a crag above us. It had sliced a  ravine five feet deep in the mountainside, and came roaring down with a  rushing noise that made my head vibrate. It looked formidable; anyone  stepping into it would be knocked off his feet in seconds, and swept a  thousand feet down the mountainside by the force of the current.

All the arts of  concealment had been carefully studied. It was the last place you would  think of looking, and, if you did look, nothing was visible but the  dense green circle of the low-spreading juniper. When you approached,  the bird would keep her place till you had begun to stir the branches,  when she would start out, and, just skimming the ground, make a bright  brown line to the near fence and bushes. I confidently expected that  this nest would escape molestation, but it did not. Its discovery by  myself and dog probably opened the door for ill luck, as one day, not  long afterward, when I peeped in upon it, it was empty. The proud song  of the male had ceased from his accustomed tree, and the pair were seen  no more in that vicinity.    The phoebe-bird is a wise architect, and perhaps enjoys as great an  immunity from danger, both in its person and its nest, as any other  bird. Its modest, ashen-gray suit is the color of the rocks where it  builds, and the moss of which it makes such free use gives to its nest  the look of a natural growth or accretion. But when it comes into the  barn or under the shed to build, as it so frequently does, the moss is  rather out of place. Doubtless in time the bird will take the hint, and  when she builds in such places will leave the moss out. I noted but two  nests, the summer I am speaking of: one, in a barn, failed of issue, on  account of the rats, I suspect, though the little owl may have been the  depredator; the other, in the woods, sent forth three young. This latter  nest was most charmingly and ingeniously placed. I discovered it while  in quest of pond-lilies, in a long, deep level stretch of water in the  woods. A large tree had blown over at the edge of the water, and its  dense mass of up-turned roots, with the black, peaty soil filling the  interstices, was like the fragment of a wall several feet high, rising  from the edge of the languid current. In a niche in this earthy wall,  and visible and accessible only from the water, a phoebe had built her  nest, and reared her brood. I paddled my boat up and came alongside  prepared to take the family aboard. The young, nearly ready to fly, were  quite undisturbed by my presence, having probably been assured that no  danger need be apprehended from that side. It was not a likely place for  minks, or they would not have been so secure.    I noted but one nest of the wood pewee, and that, too, like so many  other nests, failed of issue. It was saddled upon a small dry limb of a  plane-tree that stood by the roadside, about forty feet from the ground.  Every day for nearly a week, as I passed by I saw the sitting bird upon  the nest. Then one morning she was not in her place, and on examination  the nest proved to be empty--robbed, I had no doubt, by the red  squirrels, as they were very abundant in its vicinity, and appeared to  make a clean sweep of every nest. The wood pewee builds an exquisite  nest, shaped and finished as if cast in a mould. It is modeled  without and within with equal neatness and art, like the nest of the  humming-bird and the little gray gnat-catcher. The material is much  more refractory than that used by either of these birds, being, in the  present case, dry, fine cedar twigs; but these were bound into a shape  as rounded and compact as could be moulded out of the most plastic  material. Indeed, the nest of this bird looks precisely like a large,  lichen-covered, cup-shaped excrescence of the limb upon which it is  placed. And the bird, while sitting, seems entirely at ease. Most birds  seem to make very hard work of incubation. It is a kind of martyrdom  which appears to tax all their powers of endurance. They have such a  fixed, rigid, predetermined look, pressed down into the nest and as  motionless as if made of cast-iron. But the wood pewee is an exception.  She is largely visible above the rim of the nest. Her attitude is easy  and graceful; she moves her head this way and that, and seems to take  note of whatever goes on about her; and if her neighbor were to drop in  for a little social chat, she could doubtless do her part. In fact,  she makes light and easy work of what, to most other birds, is such a  serious and engrossing matter. If it does not look like play with her,  it at least looks like leisure and quiet contemplation.    There is no nest-builder that suffers more from crows and squirrels  and other enemies than the wood-thrush. It builds as openly and  unsuspiciously as if it thought the whole world as honest as itself.  Its favorite place is the fork of a sapling, eight or ten feet from  the ground, where it falls an easy prey to every nest-robber that comes  prowling through the woods and groves. It is not a bird that skulks and  hides, like the cat-bird, the brown-thrasher, the chat, or the cheewink,  and its nest is not concealed with the same art as theirs. Our thrushes  are all frank, open-mannered birds; but the veery and the hermit build  upon the ground, where they at least escape the crows, owls, and jays,  and stand a better chance to be overlooked, by the red squirrel and  weasel also; while the robin seeks the protection of dwellings and  out-buildings. For years I have not known the nest of a wood-thrush  to succeed. During the season referred to I observed but two, both  apparently a second attempt, as the season was well advanced, and both  failures. In one case, the nest was placed in a branch that an apple  tree, standing near a dwelling, held out over the highway. The structure  was barely ten feet above the middle of the road, and would just escape  a passing load of hay. It was made conspicuous by the use of a large  fragment of newspaper in its foundation--an unsafe material to build  upon in most cases. Whatever else the press may guard, this particular  newspaper did not guard this nest from harm. It saw the egg and probably  the chick, but not the fledgeling. A murderous deed was committed  above the public highway, but whether in the open day or under cover  of darkness I have no means of knowing. The frisky red squirrel was  doubtless the culprit. The other nest was in a maple sapling, within  a few yards of the little rustic summer-house already referred to. The  first attempt of the season, I suspect, had failed in a more secluded  place under the hill; so the pair had come up nearer the house for  protection. The male sang in the trees near by for several days before  I chanced to see the nest. The very morning, I think, it was finished,  I saw a red squirrel exploring a tree but a few yards away; he probably  knew what the singing meant as well as I did. I did not see the inside  of the nest, for it was almost instantly deserted, the female having  probably laid a single egg, which the squirrel had devoured.    If I were a bird, in building my nest I should follow the example of the  bobolink, placing it in the midst of a broad meadow, where there was no  spear of grass, or flower or growth unlike another to mark its site. I  judge that the bobolink escapes the dangers to which I have adverted  as few or no other birds do. Unless the mowers come along at an earlier  date than she has anticipated, that is, before July lst, or a skunk goes  nosing through the grass, which is unusual, she is as safe as bird well  can be in the great open of nature. She selects the most monotonous and  uniform place she can find amid the daisies or the timothy and clover,  and places her simple structure upon the ground in the midst of it.  There is no concealment, except as the great conceals the little, as  the desert conceals the pebble, as the myriad conceals the unit. You  may find the nest once, if your course chances to lead you across it  and your eye is quick enough to note the silent brown bird as she darts  quickly away; but step three paces in the wrong direction, and your  search will probably be fruitless. My friend and I found a nest by  accident one day, and then lost it again one minute afterward. I moved  away a few yards to be sure of the mother-bird, charging my friend not  to stir from his tracks. When I returned, he had moved two paces, he  said (he had really moved four), and we spent a half hour stooping  over the daisies and the buttercups, looking for the lost clew. We  grew desperate, and fairly felt the ground all over with our hands, but  without avail. I marked the spot with a bush, and came the next day, and  with the bush as a centre, moved about it in slowly increasing circles,  covering, I thought, nearly every inch of ground with my feet, and  laying hold of it with all the visual power that I could command, till  my patience was exhausted, and I gave up, baffled. I began to doubt  the ability of the parent birds themselves to find it, and so secreted  myself and watched. After much delay, the male bird appeared with food  in his beak, and satisfying himself that the coast was clear, dropped  into the grass which I had trodden down in my search. Fastening my eye  upon a particular meadow-lily, I walked straight to the spot, bent down,  and gazed long and intently into the grass. Finally my eye separated the  nest and its young from its surroundings. My foot had barely missed them  in my search, but by how much they had escaped my eye I could not tell.  Probably not by distance at all, but simply by unrecognition. They were  virtually invisible. The dark gray and yellowish brown dry grass and  stubble of the meadow-bottom were exactly copied in the color of the  half-fledged young. More than that, they hugged the nest so closely and  formed such a compact mass, that though there were five of them, they  preserved the unit of expression,--no single head or form was defined;  they were one, and that one was without shape or color, and  not separable, except by closest scrutiny, from the one of the  meadow-bottom. That nest prospered, as bobolinks' nests doubtless  generally "]]]
