De massa paid a thousand  green-back dollars for him down to Mobile. 'Nuf green-backs to wrap him  up in, he said, so he named him Green Bonner.    \"Yes suh, we was all Baptis'--de deep water kind, and every Sunday dey  used to pile us into de waggins and pull out bright and early for Big  Creek Church on the Carrollton road. Everybody fetched a big basket of  grub and, sakes alive! sech another dinner you never see, all spread out  on de grassy grove by de ole graveyard. Mos' all de quality white folks  belonged at Big Creek and when dere slaves got sho' nuff 'ligion, dey  have 'em jine at Big Creek and be baptized at de swimmin' hole. Some of  de niggers want to have dere own meetin's, but Lawd chile, dem niggers  get happy and get to shoutin' all over de meadow where dey built a brush  arbor. Massa John quick put a stop to dat. He say, 'if you gwine to  preach and sing you must turn de wash pot bottom up'; meanin', no  shoutin'. Dem Baptis' at Big Creek was sho' tight wid dere rules too.  Turn you out sho' if you drink too much cawn licker, or dance, or cuss.    \"Massa John had a big fine bird dog. She was a mammy dog and one day she  foun' six puppies out in de harness house. Dey was mos' all girl puppies  so massa gwine drown 'em. I axed him to give 'em to me and purty soon de  missus sent me to de pos'office, so I put de puppies in a basket and  took 'em wid me.

Bout a week atter dat ole missus sent me to 'de pos'office again,  so I took my basket of puppies. Sho' nuff, 'long come Dr. Lyles and he  say, 'Siney, see you still ain't sold dem pups'. I say, 'Naw-suh'. Den  he axed me ag'in what 'nomination dey b'long to. I tole him dey was  Baptis' dogs. He say, 'How come? You tole me las' week dem was Methodis'  pups'. Ha-ha!

De ole court house had been burned and dey 'rested a nigger  named Bill Burkhalter for settin' it on fire. Dey sent him to de pen'  an' some officers started wid him to Montgomery. When dey got to Sipsey  River a mob ketched up wid 'em an' took Bill and hung him dere in the  swamp. 'Bout dat time a bad cloud come up. Dey axed Bill did he have  anything to say.

Her little grand-child had to act to some  extent as an interpreter, as her speech was at times most indistinct.    \"Yassum, I remembers lots of things dat happened back in de days of de  Cibil War,\" she said. \"I remembers de place whar I lived. It were de  prettiest house you ever seed. It were on a high hill overlooking a  small creek and de flowers 'roun' in de yard was somp'n to see, sho'  'nuff.    \"I was bawn in 1847 on Massa Fisher's and Mistis Fisher's plantation  near Camden, Alabama.

We had fetched him things, but he say dat you couldn't carry  nothing to war but a pack on your back and he laid dem all down and  wiped his eyes and rode off wid a big yell to us. Dat was de rebel yell  and we answered back.    \"One morning de very next week we heard our young missus hollering and  we went to see what de trouble was.

My Marster was my father, his name was Tom Reed, and he  lived six miles from Lancaster Court House. Dats where I was born. My  mammy name Jane, don't know where she come from. My marster was kind to  us. I done no work much, just picked peas and sich like during de war. I  was my mammy's only child, and when de war was over, and I grow up, I  left dere and come to Cedar Creek, low part of Fairfield County. I marry  a gal, Bella Cook, and us had sixteen chillun, thirteen of them is a  livin' now. I then marry Hannah Dubard, a widow. She and me have had no  child.    \"I b'long to de Sanctified Church, and you have to go down into de water  and come up straight way out of de water to b'long to dat church. Where  is it? Its on Little Cedar Creek in dis county. Who de preacher? His  name is the Reverend Edmunds.

He is incapable of self support on account of age,  ill health, and impaired feet. One of his feet was mashed off and the  other badly damaged by handling bales of cotton several years ago. He  subsists on what his sister and other people are able to give him.    \"I has been livin' right here in Columbia for the past thirty-six years.  I has worked in de cotton business, first as ginner and then wid cotton  buyers, ever since I has been here. I knows all de grades of lint cotton  and can name them right now. (He ran through the different grades fairly  correctly.)    \"I learned all I knows 'bout cotton and de grades from Mr. M.C. Heath  and Mr. W.E. Smith, cotton buyers in Columbia for thirty years or more.  They thought so much of my knowledge of cotton, dat they sent me many  times to settle claims wid big men and big buyers.[1]     [1] Verification not available.    \"It ain't what a nigger knows dat keeps him down. No, sir. It is what he  don't know, dat keeps de black man in de background. White folks dat is  business folks, pays no 'tention to our color as much as they does to  dat money makin' power us has. Of course, de white man sticks to his  color and you can't blame him for dat. If de nigger shows dat he is  willin' to work and to learn to be business lak, make money and walk  straight wid his boss and fellowman, de better class of de white people  is gwine to treat him right. I knows what I's tellin' you is so, from my  own 'sperience wid Mr. Heath and Mr. Smith. They always treated me  better than I deserved and even now in my old age, deir folks and deir  friends gives me money, dat keeps me out de poorhouse.    \"No, sir, I don't 'member de Civil War a-tall myself but I has heard all  'bout it from my own folks and de white folks I has worked wid. It seems  lak I knows too much 'bout them awful times. I sho' am glad I didn't  come 'long then. I feels and knows dat de years after de war was worser  than befo'. Befo' de war, niggers did have a place to lie down at night  and somewhere to eat, when they got hungry in slavery time. Since them  times, a many a nigger has had it tough to make a livin'. I knows dat is  so, too, 'cause I has been all 'long dere.    \"Many niggers have gone north to live, since freedom, but de most of  them either comes back south again or they wants to come back. De north  don't suit de nigger. Cold climate lak they has up dere is too hard on  him. He has thin blood and you knows dat a thin pan gwine to git hot  quicker than a thick one and cold de same way. You see a heap of niggers  is lak wild animals, in a way. He laks to eat a heap, sleep a heap, and  move 'bout slow. When he goes up north he has to step 'round fas',  'cause if he don't, he gits in de way of them Yankees dat move 'bout  quick.    \"De black man is natchally lazy, you knows dat. De reason he talks lak  he does, is 'cause he don't want to go to de trouble to 'nounce his  words lak they ought to be. When he says 'dat' he saves a letter, same  way wid 'dis' and nearly all other words. It ain't after savin' so much;  he is just too careless and lazy to care 'bout it. A nigger wants what  is in sight and not dat what he can't see; it can look out for itself. I  is sorry I has to say all dis 'bout my own color but it is de truth. De  truth makes you free and runs de devil. I is a nigger myself and I knows  what they is and what they does.    \"Is de nigger 'ligious? Yes, sir, many of them is very 'ligious widout  'ligion. He takes all dat from white folks. So many think 'ligion is  gwine to git them somethin' widout workin' for it and fool people by  makin' them think they is good and can be trusted and all dat. But I  'spects some of them is right, even at dat, 'cause if they ain't got  'ligion they sho' ain't got nothin' in dis world. I pays no 'tention to  all dis 'gwine on' lak I see some 'ligious folks does. Maybe I wouldn't  be in de fix I is, if I paid more 'tention to churches and all dat. I  believes in churches and good folks but I don't practice them good  things lak I ought to. Boss, if you take de dollar out of 'ligion and de  churches, you sho' would have to hunt for them. I believes dat. I don't  see no 'ciples gwine 'bout a preachin' and doin' good, lak I has heard  they once done, barefooted and askin' no pay. De preachers dese days is  a ridin' in de finest automobiles and you sho' better look out for  yourself, if you don't, you is gwine to git run over.    \"I has been a good man, in body, all de time since I got grown. For many  years I didn't know my own strength. I never seen a bale of cotton I  couldn't pick up and tote where I wanted to, by myself. You see dese  foots of mine? They was mashed off, from drappin' bales of cotton on  them, back yonder many years ago.    \"I 'members mighty well, when de fust skyscraper was built in Columbia.
