Certain insects exude bitter or  foetid liquids; but in all these cases, and in others that are similar,  the animal finds in his own organism a secretion which happens to be  more or less useful to his conservation. The method of the _Toxotes_  is different. It is a foreign body which he takes up, and it is an  intended victim at which he takes aim and which he strikes; his  movements are admirably co-ordinated to obtain a precise effect.       [21] Cuvier et Valenciennes, _Hist. Nat. des Poissons_,          Paris, 1831, t. vii. p. 231.    Another fish, the _Chelinous_ of Java, also acts in this manner. He  generally lives in estuaries. It is therefore a brackish water which  he takes up and projects by closing his gills and contracting his  mouth; he can thus strike a fly at a distance of several feet. Usually  he aims sufficiently well to strike it at the first blow, but  sometimes he fails. Then he begins again until he has succeeded, which  shows that his movements are not those of a machine. He knows what he  is doing, what effect ought to be produced, and whether this desired  result has happened, and he perseveres until the insect has fallen.  These facts are unquestioned; the Chinese preserve these curious fish  in jars, and amuse themselves by making them carry on this little  exercise. Many observers have witnessed and described it.    _Particular circumstances put to profit._--In the various kinds of  hunting which we have been passing in review, it is certain that the  animals in question generally exercise them nearly always in the same  manner. If an animal has carried out a ruse successfully he does not  abandon it, but reproduces it as often as it is efficacious. When,  however, conditions happen to change, animals are prompt to profit by  them, and one sees how all these acts are derived from reflection.  This is the clearer the more the favourable circumstance is accidental  and unforeseen, when it is not possible to consider the animals as  accustomed to profit by it.    In the wild regions of Africa it happens that from some reason or  another, perhaps from the effect of lightning on immense forests,  dense thickets or plains covered by tall plants become the prey of  gigantic fires which spread as long as they find food on their road.  The heat as of a furnace arises above and around; an acrid smoke veils  everything, and the frightened animals flee before the scourge.  Travellers who have witnessed these magnificent scenes often insist on  the panics thus produced, and describe the inoffensive lion fleeing in  the midst of a herd of gazelles. All are seized by the same fear,  because all are exposed to the same danger. But birds, whose wings can  carry them at will afar from the furnace, preserve greater presence of  mind, and profit by the public calamity and general anxiety to make a  successful hunt and copious feasts. One may see the birds of prey  flying in front of the fire and seizing easy victims. Certain birds of  Africa are the most furious hunters during a fire. Legions of insects  flee far from the tall dried plants, and clouds of birds arrive to  throw themselves on them. They pursue them with incredible audacity  through the smoke close to the flames and always retire in time to  avoid singeing. A member of the Crow family who inhabits India,  _Anomalocorax splendens_, enjoys a deserved reputation of astuteness  and allows no opportunity to escape without seizing it by the  forelock. In ordinary times his food is composed of very varied  substances--crabs, insects, worms, etc.; but if he perceives afar an  ascending cloud he immediately abandons his small researches, knowing  there is something better to be done over there. He is not selfish,  and he calls a few comrades and they all put themselves into position  to await events. They know very well the relation that exists between  this smoke and the prey they covet. The fire indicated by the smoke  can have no other reason in this hot country than the cooking of food.  A Hindoo family are in fact installed and preparing their repast. The  birds see all this and observe. The Hindoos are accustomed to throw  outside the remains of their meals, and the _Anomalocorax_, who have  come together from afar to await patiently this result, then throw  themselves on the quarry. (Jerdon.)    Tennent narrates a singular trick which was twice, to his knowledge,  played on a dog by two of these small glossy crows of Ceylon. The dog  was gnawing a bone and would not be disturbed from the pure delight of  sucking the marrow of which he was the legitimate proprietor. A crow  approached the scene of the feast, and conceived the design of taking  possession of it; he began by hopping around the dog, going and  coming, trying to attract the animal's attention and ready to profit  by the first distraction. His gambols remaining without result, he  understood that he would not succeed and he flew away; but it was only  to return accompanied by a friend possessing as little respect as  himself for the property of others. The associate perched on a branch  a few steps away, while the first crow renewed his attempts by flying  around the bone and the dog; but the latter remained impassive. Then  the second personage, whose part had hitherto been to remain  contemplative, flew off his branch, threw himself on the dog and gave  him a formidable blow on the spine. Seized with indignation, the dog  turned round to punish the author of this unjustifiable aggression;  but the bird was already far away, and in the meanwhile from the other  side the first _Anomalocorax_ seized the long-coveted bone and also  took flight. The feelings of the sheepish dog who saw both his  vengeance and his repast flying away in the air may be better imagined  than described.[22]       [22] Tennent, _Ceylon_, vol. i. p. 171.    All the birds, indeed, of this family know how to reach their ends. I  have already spoken of certain hunts of the Raven; it is even said  that in Iceland he knows when a ewe is going to give birth to young,  and awaits this moment with immense patience. As soon as the lamb  appears the Raven alights on him, digs out his eyes, and devours them.    The Quelelis or Guadaloupe Caracara (_Polyborus lutosus_), a  Californian bird of prey, is a cruel enemy to animals like the goat  when they are about to bring forth their young. No sooner is one kid  born, and while the mother is yet in labour with the second, than the  birds pounce upon it, and should the mother be able to interfere, she  is assaulted also. If there are a number of young kids together, the  birds unite their forces and with great noise and flapping of wings  succeed in separating the weakest and killing it.[23]       [23] Bendire, _Life Histories of North American Birds_,          1892, p. 319.    Dr. J. Lowe has recently called attention to a very curious method of  attracting prey adopted by the Blackcap (_Sylvia atricapilla_) at  Orotava, Teneriffe.[24] This bird has discovered that the juice exuded  by certain flowers (_Hibiscus Rosa sinensis_ and _Abutilon frondosum_)  is attractive to the insects upon which he preys; he therefore  punctures the petals of these flowers in order to promote the  exudation of this viscid secretion.       [24] Linnaean Society, 1st June 1893.    Many of us in our schooldays have admired the intelligence of Jackdaws  having their nests in some old tower or belfry. They are able to  distinguish according to the hour the significance of the various  school bells. Most of these clangs do not move them, and they continue  to attend to their affairs without paying attention. Their attention  is only attracted by the ringing which marks the beginning and the end  of recreation time. At the sound of the first they all flee and  abandon the courts before even a single pupil has yet appeared. The  bell, on the contrary, which marks the end of recreation time invites  them to descend in a band to collect the crumbs of lunch. They arrive  in a hurry, so as to be the first to profit by the repast, not waiting  even until the place is abandoned; they know very well that the young  people still there are not to be feared, having no time now to be  occupied with them.    In this class of facts, there are a certain number which may be  considered as more marked by custom and perhaps less marked by  spontaneous reflection. Such, for example, is the custom of Sharks and  Seagulls to follow ships.    In the seas where Dog-fish are abundant, one or more of them become  attached to a ship, and quit it neither night nor day. One may believe  sometimes that they are not there; but if any object is thrown into  the sea, the fin of one of these monsters appears at the surface;  everything which is thrown overboard disappears in their large  jaws--kitchen refuse, bottles, etc. When a dead body is thrown into  the sea it is soon seized by the shark, while living men who fall into  the water have great difficulty in escaping, and are often drawn up  horribly mutilated and half dead.    Sea-gulls also follow vessels when they approach the coast. It is a  pleasant sight to see the noisy band animating the monotonous  splendour of the ocean; they arrive as soon as a vessel is one or two  days' journey from land. Henceforth they do not leave her, flying  behind and plunging in her wake; they profit by the disturbance  produced by the gigantic machine to capture the stunned fishes.    On land exactly the same kind of chase is carried on by Rooks, Crows,  and Magpies, who follow the plough to seize the worms which the  ploughshare turns up in the open earth. In autumn they cover the  fields, animated and active, pilfering as the furrow is hollowed out.    Certain rapacious birds who are awkward in hunting, especially Kites,  make up for their lack of skill by audacious impudence."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29839"],[0,"The House in the Water: A Book of Animal Stories (#7)"],[1,"and  stones and mud. A second look, however, and his heart jumped with  excitement and delight. Here was the beginning of a new pond, here  were the foundations of a new dam. He would be able to see what few  indeed of the students of the wilderness had had the opportunity to  watch--the actual process by which these wilderness engineers achieved  their great work.    All about the place the straightest and brushiest alders had been cut  down, those usually selected being at least ten or twelve feet in  height. Many of them were still lying where they fell; but a number  had been dragged to the stream and anchored securely, with stones and  turfy clay, across the channel. The Boy noted, with keenest  admiration, that these were all laid with the greatest regularity  parallel with the flow of the current, butts up stream, brushy tops  below. In this way, the current took least hold upon them, and was  obstructed gradually and as it were insidiously, without being  challenged to any violent test of strength. Already it was lingering  in some confusion, backing up, and dividing its force, and stealing  away at each side among the bushes. The Boy had heard that the  beavers were accustomed to begin their dams by felling a tree across  the channel and piling their materials upon that as a foundation. But  the systematic and thorough piece of work before him was obviously  superior in permanence to any such slovenly makeshift; and moreover,  further to discredit such a theory, here was a tall black ash close to  the stream and fairly leaning over it, as if begging to be put to some  such use.    At this spot the Boy stayed his explorations for the day. Choosing a  bit of dry thicket close by, to be a hiding-place for Jabe and himself  that night, a bunch of spruce and fir where he knew the beavers would  not come for supplies, he hurried back to the camp for a bite of  dinner, giving wide berth to all the ponds on the way. Building a tiny  camp-fire he fried himself a couple of slices of bacon and brewed a  tin of tea for his solitary meal, then lay down in the lean-to, with  the sun streaming in upon him, for an hour's nap.    The night having been a tiring one for his youthful nerves and  muscles, he slept heavily, and awoke with a start to find the sun a  good two hours nearer the horizon. Sleep was still heavy upon him, so  he went down to the edge of the brook and plunged his face into the  chilly current. Then, picking up an axe instead of his rifle, he  returned up-stream to the dam.    As he drew near, he caught sight of a beaver swimming down the pond,  towing a big branch over its shoulder; and his conscience smote him at  the thought of the trouble and anxiety he was going to inflict upon  the diligent little inhabitants. His mind was made up, however. He  wanted knowledge, and the beavers would have to furnish it, at  whatever cost. A few minutes of vigorous work with the axe, a few  minutes of relentless tugging and jerking upon the upper framework of  the dam, and he had made a break through which the water rushed  foaming in a muddy torrent. Soon, as he knew, the falling of the  pond's level would alarm the house-dwellers, and bring them out to see  what had happened. Then, as soon as darkness came, there would be a  gathering of both households to repair the break.    [Illustration: \"HE CAUGHT SIGHT OF A BEAVER SWIMMING DOWN THE POND.\"]    Hiding in the bushes near by, he saw the water slowly go down, but for  half an hour the beavers gave no sign. Then, close beside the break, a  big fellow crawled out upon the slope of the dam and made a careful  survey of the damage. He disappeared; and presently another came, took  a briefer look, and vanished. A few minutes later, far up the pond,  several bushy branches came to the surface, as if they had been  anchored on the bottom and released. They came, apparently floating,  down toward the dam. As they reached the break, the heads of several  beavers showed themselves above water, and the branches were guided  across the opening, where they were secured in some way which the  watcher could not see. They did not so very greatly diminish the  waste, but they checked the destructive violence of it. It was  evidently a temporary makeshift, this; for in the next hour nothing  more was done. Then the Boy got tired, and went back to camp to wait  for Jabe and nightfall.    That evening the backwoodsman, forgetting the fatigue of his day's  cruising in the interest of the Boy's story, was no less eager than  his companion; and the two, hurrying through an early supper, were off  for the pond in the first purple of twilight. When they reached the  Boy's hiding-place by the dam the first star was just showing itself  in the pallid greenish sky, and the surface of the pond, with its  vague, black reflections, was like a shadowed mirror of steel. There  was not a sound on the air except the swishing rush of the divided  water over the break in the dam.    The Boy had timed his coming none too early; for the pond had dropped  nearly a foot, and the beavers were impatient to stop the break. No  sooner had night fairly settled down than suddenly the water began to  swirl into circles all about the lower end of the pond, and a dozen  heads popped up. Then more brush appeared, above the island-house, and  was hurriedly towed down to the dam. The brush which had been thrust  across the break was now removed and relaid longitudinally, branchy  ends down stream. Here it was held in place by some of the beavers  while others brought masses of clayey turf from the nearest shore to  secure it. Meanwhile more branches were being laid in place, always  parallel with the current; and in a little while the rushing noise of  the overflow began to diminish very noticeably. Then a number of  short, heavy billets were mixed with shorter lengths of brush; and all  at once the sound of rushing ceased altogether. There was not even the  usual musical trickling and tinkling, for the level of the pond was  too low for the water to find its customary stealthy exits. At this  stage the engineers began using smaller sticks, with more clay, and a  great many small stones, making a very solid-looking piece of work. At  last the old level of the dam crest was reached, and there was no  longer any evidence of what had happened except the lowness of the  water. Then, all at once, the toilers disappeared, except for one big  beaver, who kept nosing over every square inch of the work for perhaps  two minutes, to assure himself of its perfection. When he, at last,  had slipped back into the water, both Jabe and the Boy got up, as if  moved by one thought, and stretched their cramped legs.    \"I swan!\" exclaimed the woodsman with fervour. \"If that ain't the  slickest bit o' work I ever seen! Let's go over and kind of inspect  the job fer 'em!\"    Inspection revealed that the spot which had just been mended was the  solidest portion of the whole structure. Wherever else the water might  be allowed to escape, it was plain the beavers intended it should have  no more outlet here.    From the mended dam the Boy now led Jabe away up-stream in haste, in  the hope of catching some beavers at work on the new dam in the  alders. Having skirted the long pond at a distance, to avoid giving  alarm, the travellers went with the utmost caution till they reached  the swampy level. Then, indifferent to the oozy, chilly mud, they  crept forward like minks stealing on their prey; and at last, gaining  the fir thicket without mishap, they lay prone on the dry needles to  rest.    As they lay, a sound of busy splashing came to their ears, which  promptly made them forget their fatigue. Shifting themselves very  slowly and with utter silence, they found that the place of ambush  had been most skilfully chosen. In perfect hiding themselves,  they commanded a clear and near view of the new dam and all its  approaches.    There were two beavers visible, paddling busily on the foundations  of the dam, while the overflowing water streamed about them,  covering their feet. At this stage, most of the water flowed  through the still uncompacted structure, leaving work on the top  unimpeded. The two beavers were dragging into place a long birch  sapling, perhaps eleven feet in length, with a thick, bushy top.  When laid to the satisfaction of the architects,--the butt, of course,  pointing straight up-stream,--the trunk was jammed firmly down  between those already placed. Then the more erect and unmanageable of  the branches were gnawed off and in some way--which the observers  with all their watchfulness could not make out--wattled down among  the other branches so as to make a woven and coherent mass. The  earth and sod and small stones which were afterwards brought and  laid upon the structure did not seem necessary to hold it in place,  but rather for the stoppage of the interstices.    While this was going on at the dam, a rustling of branches and  splashing of water turned the watchers' attention up-stream. Another  beaver came in sight, and then another, each partly floating and  partly dragging a straight sapling like the first. It seemed that the  dam-builders were not content to depend altogether on the crooked,  scraggly alder-growth all about them, but demanded in their  foundations a certain proportion of the straighter timbers and denser  branches of the birch. It was quite evident that they knew just what  they were doing, and how best to do it.    While the building was going on, yet another pair of beavers appeared,  and the work was pressed with a feverish energy that produced amazing  results. The Boy remembered a story told him by an old Indian, but  not confirmed by any natural history which he had come across, to the  effect that when a pair of young beavers set out to establish a new  pond, some of the old ones go along to lend a hand in the building of  the dam. It was plain that these workers were"]]]
