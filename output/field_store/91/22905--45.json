The upper part of the picture, which is  by Gherardi, has not an equal degree of force. Lattanzio finished his  career by being sheriff of his native city; and of this office, a more  honourable distinction than at the present day, it appears he took  possession in the year 1553, and at that time renounced the art. It is  certain, that, in the before mentioned paper, the Capitano Lattanzio di  Vincenzo Pagani da Monte Rubbiano acknowledges to have received six  scudi of gold from Sforza degli Oddi, as earnest money for a picture  representing the Trinity, with four saints; and engages that in the  ensuing August it should be executed by his father Vincenzo and Tommaso  da Cortona, and this must be the picture still existing in the chapel of  the Oddi in S. Francesco, since the figures particularized in the  agreement are found there; we shall have an opportunity of noticing it  again.    In the _Antichita Picene_, tom. xxi. p. 148, Ercole Ramazzani di  Roccacontrada is recorded as a scholar of Pietro Perugino, and for some  time of Raffaello. A picture of the circumcision, by him, is there  mentioned to be at Castel Planio, with his name and the date of 1588;  and in speaking of the artist it is added, that he possessed a beautiful  style of colour, a charming invention, and a manner approaching to  Barocci. I have never seen the above mentioned picture, nor the others  which he left in his native city, mentioned in the _Memorie_ of  Abbondanziere: but only one by a Ramazzani di Roccacontrada, painted in  the church of S. Francesco, in Matelica, in 1573. Although I cannot  affirm to a certainty that this painter called himself Ercole, I still  suspect him to be the same. It represents the conception of the Virgin,  in which the idea of the subject is taken from Vasari, where Adam, and  others of the Old Testament, are seen bound to the tree of knowledge of  good and evil, as the heirs of sin, while the Virgin triumphs over them  in her exemption from the penalty of the first parents. Ramazzani has  adopted this design, which he had probably seen, but he has executed his  picture on a much larger scale, with better colouring, and much more  expression in the countenances. To conclude, we do not see a trace of  the manner of Perugino, and the period at which he lived seems too late  for him to have received instructions from that artist; and it is most  probable that he was taught by some of his latter scholars, in whom, if  I mistake not, that more fascinating than correct style of colouring had  its origin, before it was adopted by Barocci.    I may further observe, that as Perugino was the most celebrated name at  the beginning of the sixteenth century, many other artists of the Roman  States, who studied the art about his time, are given to his school  without any sufficient authority; and particularly those who retained a  share of the old style. Such was a Palmerini of Urbino, a contemporary  of Raphael, and probably his fellow scholar in early life, of whom there  remains at S. Antonio, a picture of various saints, truly beautiful, and  approaching to a more modern style. In the same style I found, in the  Borghese Gallery at Rome, the Woman of Samaria at the Well, painted by a  Pietro Giulianello, or perhaps _da_ Giulianello, a little district not  far from Rome; an artist deserving to be placed in the first rank of  _quattrocentisti_, although not mentioned by any writer. There are  besides, some pictures by Pietro Paolo Agabiti, who in tom. xx. of the  _Ant. Pic._ is said to be of Masaccio, where he painted in 1531, and  some time afterwards. But I have seen a work by him in the church of S.  Agostino in Sassoferrato, a series of small histories, with an  inscription in which he names Sassoferrato as his native place, with the  date of 1514; a date that will carry him from the moderns to the better  class of the old school. Lorenzo Pittori da Macerata painted in the  church of the Virgin, highly esteemed for its architecture, a picture of  Christ in 1533, in a manner which has been called _antico moderno_. Two  artists, Bartolommeo, and Pompeo his son, flourished in Fano, and  painted in 1534 in conjunction, in the church of S. Michele, the  resurrection of Lazarus. It is wonderful to observe how little they  regarded the reform which the art had undergone. These artists strictly  followed the dry style of the quattrocentisti, with a thorough contempt  of the modern style. Nor was the son at all modernized on leaving his  father's studio. I found at S. Andrea di Pesaro a picture by him of  various saints, which might have done him honour in the preceding age.  Civalli mentions other works by him in a better style: and he certainly  in his lifetime enjoyed a degree of reputation, and was one of the  masters of Taddeo Zuccaro. There are a number of painters of this class,  of whom a long list might be compiled; they are generally represented to  be pupils of some well known master, and in such cases Pietro Perugino  is selected; though it would be more candid to confess our ignorance on  the subject.    It would be improper to pass on to another epoch of art, without  adverting to the grotesque. This branch of the art is censured by  Vitruvius[25] as a creation of portentous monsters beyond the reign of  nature, transferring to canvas the dreams and ravings of a disordered  fancy, as wild as the waves of a convulsed sea, lashed into a thousand  varying forms by the fury of the tempest. This style took its name from  the _grotte_, for so those beautiful antique edifices may be called,  where paintings of this kind are found, covered with earth, and with  buildings of a later period. This style was revived in Rome, where a  greater proportion of these ancient specimens is found, and was restored  at this epoch. Vasari ascribes the revival of them to Morto da Feltro,  and the perfecting of the style to Giovanni da Udine. But he himself,  notwithstanding the little esteem he had for Pinturicchio, calls him the  friend of Morto da Feltro, and allows that he executed many works in the  same manner in Castel S. Angelo. Before him too Pietro his master had  painted some of the same kind in the Sala del Cambio, which Orsini says  are well conceived, and to him likewise a precedent had been afforded by  Benedetto Bonfigli, of whom Taja, in his description of the Vatican  palace, says, that he painted for Innocent VIII. in Rome some singularly  beautiful grotesques. This branch of art was afterwards cultivated in  many of the schools of Italy, particularly in that of Siena. Peruzzi  approved of it in architecture, and adopted it in his painting, and gave  occasion to Lomazzo to offer a defence of it, and precepts, as I before  noticed, and as may be seen in the sixth book of his Trattato della  Pittura, chapter forty-eight.

An interorbital bar  and transverse marks on the shanks are invariably present. The dorsal  markings are variable, but in most specimens (92%) consist of either  an X- or )(-shaped mark in the scapular region; in the other specimens  the markings are irregular short lines or absent. Approximately equal  numbers of specimens have a transverse bar, chevron, or broken lines  in the sacral region, whereas about eight per cent of the specimens  lack markings in the sacral region.    When active at night, individuals are pale yellowish tan with faint  brown dorsal markings. By day they are tan with more distinct brown  markings (Pl. 14). The thighs are pale yellow; the belly is white. The  iris is pale creamy tan with brown flecks. In breeding males the vocal  sac is yellow.    _Tadpoles._--Tadpoles of this species have been found in an extensive  grassy pond at Puerto Viejo, Costa Rica. The following description is  based on KU 104099, a specimen in development stage 36 (Gosner, 1960).    Total length, 21.0 mm.; body length, 6.7 mm.; body slightly wider than  deep, snout pointed; nostrils large, directed anteriorly, situated  near end of snout; eyes small, situated dorsolaterally, directed  laterally; spiracle sinistral, located just posteroventral to eye;  anal tube dextral. Tail xiphicercal; caudal musculature moderately  deep, extending far beyond posterior edge of fins; fins deepest at  about midlength; dorsal fin extending onto body, slightly deeper than  caudal musculature; ventral fin slightly shallower than musculature.  Mouth small, terminal, lacking teeth and fringing papillae, but having  finely serrate beaks. In preservative top of head olive-tan with brown  flecks; dark stripe from snout through eye to posterior edge of body;  belly white, flecked with brown anteriorly; tail creamy tan with  grayish brown blotches. In life, dorsum of body reddish tan mottled  with darker brown; lateral stripe dark brown; belly white, mottled  with brown and black; caudal musculature heavily pigmented with  grayish tan; posterior tip of tail marked with dark gray; caudal fins  heavily blotched with grayish tan; iris orange-tan peripherally, red  centrally (Pl. 15).    _Remarks._--This species has been confused with _Hyla microcephala  underwoodi_ by many workers. Dunn (1931, 1933, 1934) and Breder (1946)  referred Panamanian specimens of _H. phlebodes_ to _H. underwoodi_;  likewise, Gaige, Hartweg, and Stuart (1937) made the same error. Cole  and Barbour (1906) and Kellog (1932) used the name _H. phlebodes_ for  Mexican specimens of _H. microcephala underwoodi_. The similarity in  color pattern of _H. microcephala underwoodi_ and _H. phlebodes_  easily accounts for the misapplication of names. Although both species  have nearly identical dorsal color patterns, that of _H. microcephala  underwoodi_ usually is bolder. Furthermore, in that species a narrow  white line usually is present above the well-defined lateral dark  stripe, whereas the lateral dark stripe is short and posterior to the  eye is not bordered above by a white line in _H. phlebodes_.    The type locality \"San Carlos, Costa Rica\" given by Stejneger  (1906:817) apparently refers to a region, the Llanuras de San Carlos,  in the northern part of Alajuela Province, Costa Rica.        [Illustration: Fig. 3. Map showing locality records for        _Hyla phlebodes_.]      _Distribution._--_Hyla phlebodes_ inhabits humid tropical forests from  southeastern Nicaragua southeastward on the Caribbean slopes and  lowlands to the Canal Zone in Panama, thence eastward in the Chucunaque  Basin of eastern Panama and onto the Pacific lowlands of Colombia  (Fig. 3). The species also reaches the Pacific slopes in the Arenal  Depression in northwestern Costa Rica and in the Panamanian isthmus,  where it occurs in humid forests on the Pacific slope of El Valle and  Cerro La Campana. Mostly the species is found at low elevations, but  it occurs at 600 meters at Turrialba and at 700 meters at Finca San  Bosco in Costa Rica.    _Specimens examined._--410, as follows: +Nicaragua+: Zelaya: Isla  Grande del Maiz, MCZ 14848; Rio Mico, El Recrero, UMMZ 79720 (6).    +Costa Rica+: Alajuela: 12.4 km.

All specimens lack a dorsolateral dark stripe and white line, although  a dark line is present on the canthus and dissipates in the loreal  region. A broad interorbital brown bar is present in all specimens.  The color pattern on the dorsum invariably consists of a broad, dark,  chevron-shaped mark in the scapular region and a broad dark chevron or  transverse bar in the sacral region. The shanks invariably have two or  three dark brown transverse bars.    When active at night individuals are yellowish tan above with chocolate  brown markings (Pl. 14). The belly is white, and the thighs are pale  yellowish tan. The iris is dark bronze-color. In breeding males the  vocal sac is yellow. By day some individuals were observed to change  to creamy gray with distinct darker markings.    _Remarks._--Although tadpoles of this species have not been found,  observations on the breeding sites indicate that the tadpoles probably  develop in ponds. Except for calling males observed around a pool in a  stream-bed 11.8 kilometers west-northwest of Tierra Colorada, Guerrero,  all breeding congregations have been found at temporary ponds.    Smith (1951:186) named _Hyla sartori_ as a subspecies of _Hyla  microcephala_. This subspecific relationship seemed reasonable until  analysis of the mating calls showed that the call of _H. sartori_ is  more nearly like that of _H. phlebodes_ than that of _H. microcephala_.  The broad hiatus separating the ranges of _H. microcephala_ and _H.  sartori_ is additional evidence for considering _H. sartori_ as a  distinct species.        [Illustration: Fig. 4. Map showing locality records for        _Hyla sartori_.]      _Distribution._--_Hyla sartori_ occurs in mesophytic forests to  elevations of about 300 meters on the Pacific slopes of southern Mexico  from southwestern Jalisco to south-central Oaxaca (Fig. 4). The lack of  specimens from Colima and Michoacan probably reflects inadequate  collecting instead of the absence of the species there. On the basis of  available habitat the species would be expected to occur in Nayarit,  but extensive collecting there has failed to reveal its presence. The  semi-arid Plains of Tehuantepec apparently limit the distribution to  the east.    _Specimens examined._--190, as follows: +Mexico+: Guerrero: 5 km. E  Acapulco, AMNH 54611-2; 23.2 km.
