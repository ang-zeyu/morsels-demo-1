It is the least he can do:  regaining the family influence, and letting us hold up our heads again.  I shall write to him the moment I am justified,\" said Lady Marney,  \"perhaps you will do so yourself, Charles.\"    \"Why, considering I have not seen my brother for two years, and we did  not part on the best possible terms--\"    \"But that is all forgotten.\"    \"By your good offices, dear mother, who are always doing good: and yet,\"  continued Egremont, after a moment's pause, \"I am not disposed to write  to Marney, especially to ask a favour.\"    \"Well, I will write,\" said Lady Marney; \"though I cannot admit it is  any favour. Perhaps it would be better that you should see him first. I  cannot understand why he keeps so at the Abbey. I am sure I found it  a melancholy place enough in my time. I wish you had gone down there,  Charles, if it had been only for a few days.\"    \"Well I did not, my dear mother, and I cannot go now. I shall trust to  you. But are you quite sure that the king is going to die?\"    \"I repeat to you, it is certain,\" replied Lady Marney, in a lowered  voice, but a decided tone; \"certain, certain, certain. My authority  cannot be mistaken: but no consideration in the world must throw you off  your guard at this moment; breathe not the shadow of what you know.\"    At this moment a servant entered and delivered a note to Lady Marney,  who read it with an ironical smile. It was from Lady St Julians, and ran  thus:--          \"Most confidential.      \"My dearest Lady Marney,        \"It is a false report: he is ill, but not dangerously; the  hay     fever; he always has it; nothing more: I will tell my       authority when we meet; I dare not write it.  It will  satisfy     you.  I am going on with my quadrille.        \"Most affectionately yours,      \"A. St J.\"      \"Poor woman! she is always wrong,\" said Lady Marney throwing the note to  Egremont. \"Her quadrille will never take place, which is a pity, as it  is to consist only of beauties and eldest sons. I suppose I must send  her a line,\" and she wrote:          \"My dearest Lady St Julians,        \"How good of you to write to me, and send me such cheering       news!  I have no doubt you are right: you always are: I  know     he had the hay fever last year.  How fortunate for your       quadrille, and how charming it will be!  Let me know if  you     hear anything further from your unmentionable quarter.        \"Ever your affectionate      \"C.M.\"          Book 1 Chapter 5        Lord Marney left several children; his heir was five years older than  the next son Charles who at the period of his father's death was  at Christchurch and had just entered the last year of his minority.  Attaining that age, he received the sum of fifteen thousand pounds,  his portion, a third of which amount his expenditure had then already  anticipated. Egremont had been brought up in the enjoyment of every  comfort and every luxury that refinement could devise and wealth  furnish. He was a favourite child. His parents emulated each other in  pampering and indulging him. Every freak was pardoned, every whim was  gratified. He might ride what horses he liked, and if he broke their  knees, what in another would have been deemed a flagrant sin, was in  him held only a proof of reckless spirit. If he were not a thoroughly  selfish and altogether wilful person, but very much the reverse, it was  not the fault of his parents, but rather the operation of a benignant  nature that had bestowed on him a generous spirit and a tender heart,  though accompanied with a dangerous susceptibility that made him the  child and creature of impulse, and seemed to set at defiance even the  course of time to engraft on his nature any quality of prudence. The  tone of Eton during the days of Charles Egremont was not of the high  character which at present distinguishes that community. It was the  unforeseen eve of the great change, that, whatever was its purpose or  have been its immediate results, at least gave the first shock to the  pseudo-aristocracy of this country. Then all was blooming; sunshine and  odour; not a breeze disturbing the meridian splendour. Then the world  was not only made for a few, but a very few. One could almost tell upon  one's fingers the happy families who could do anything, and might have  everything. A school-boy's ideas of the Church then were fat-livings,  and of the State, rotten-boroughs. To do nothing and get something,  formed a boy's ideal of a manly career. There was nothing in the lot,  little in the temperament, of Charles Egremont, to make him an exception  to the multitude. Gaily and securely he floated on the brilliant stream.  Popular at school, idolized at home, the present had no cares, and the  future secured him a family seat in Parliament the moment he entered  life, and the inheritance of a glittering post at court in due time,  as its legitimate consequence. Enjoyment, not ambition, seemed the  principle of his existence. The contingency of a mitre, the certainty of  rich preferment, would not reconcile him to the self-sacrifice which,  to a certain degree, was required from a priest, even in those days of  rampant Erastianism. He left the colonies as the spoil of his younger  brothers; his own ideas of a profession being limited to a barrack in a  London park, varied by visits to Windsor. But there was time enough to  think of these things. He had to enjoy Oxford as he had enjoyed Eton.  Here his allowance from his father was extravagant, though greatly  increased by tithes from his mother's pin-money. While he was pursuing  his studies, hunting and boating, driving tandems, riding matches,  tempering his energies in the crapulence of boyish banquets, and  anticipating life, at the risk of expulsion, in a miserable mimicry  of metropolitan dissipation, Dukism, that was supposed to be eternal,  suddenly crashed.    The Reform Act has not placed the administration of our affairs in abler  hands than conducted them previously to the passing of the measure, for  the most efficient members of the present cabinet with some very few  exceptions, and those attended by peculiar circumstances, were ministers  before the Reform Act was contemplated. Nor has that memorable statute  created a Parliament of a higher reputation for public qualities, such  as politic ability, and popular eloquence, and national consideration,  than was furnished by the old scheme. On the contrary; one house of  Parliament has been irremediably degraded into the decaying position of  a mere court of registry, possessing great privileges, on condition  that it never exercises them; while the other chamber that, at the first  blush, and to the superficial, exhibits symptoms of almost unnatural  vitality, engrossing in its orbit all the business of the country,  assumes on a more studious inspection somewhat of the character of a  select vestry, fulfilling municipal rather than imperial offices, and  beleaguered by critical and clamorous millions, who cannot comprehend  why a privileged and exclusive senate is required to perform functions  which immediately concern all, which most personally comprehend, and  which many in their civic spheres believe they could accomplish in a  manner not less satisfactory, though certainly less ostentatious.    But if it have not furnished us with abler administrators or a more  illustrious senate, the Reform Act may have exercised on the country at  large a beneficial influence. Has it? Has it elevated the tone of the  public mind? Has it cultured the popular sensibilities to noble and  ennobling ends? Has it proposed to the people of England a higher test  of national respect and confidence than the debasing qualification  universally prevalent in this country since the fatal introduction  of the system of Dutch finance? Who will pretend it? If a spirit of  rapacious coveteousness, desecrating all the humanities of life, has  been the besetting sin of England for the last century and a half, since  the passing of the Reform Act the altar of Mammon has blazed with triple  worship. To acquire, to accumulate, to plunder each other by virtue of  philosophic phrases, to propose an Utopia to consist only of WEALTH and  TOIL, this has been the breathless business of enfranchised England for  the last twelve years, until we are startled from our voracious strife  by the wail of intolerable serfage.    Are we then to conclude, that the only effect of the Reform Act has been  to create in this country another of those class interests, which we now  so loudly accuse as the obstacles to general amelioration? Not  exactly that. The indirect influence of the Reform Act has been not  inconsiderable, and may eventually lead to vast consequences. It set men  a-thinking; it enlarged the horizon of political experience; it led  the public mind to ponder somewhat on the circumstances of our national  history; to pry into the beginnings of some social anomalies which they  found were not so ancient as they had been led to believe, and which had  their origin in causes very different to what they had been educated to  credit; and insensibly it created and prepared a popular intelligence to  which one can appeal, no longer hopelessly, in an attempt to dispel the  mysteries with which for nearly three centuries it has been the  labour of party writers to involve a national history, and without  the dispersion of which no political position can be understood and no  social evil remedied.    The events of 1830 did not produce any change in the modes of thought  and life of Charles Egremont. He took his political cue from his mother,  who was his constant correspondent. Lady Marney was a distinguished  \"stateswoman,\" as they called Lady Carlisle in Charles the First's  time, a great friend of Lady St Julians, and one of the most eminent and  impassioned votaries of Dukism.

He was there when  Columbus returned from his famous first voyage, and very likely saw  him pass through the streets of Barcelona on his day of triumph.  Just when Amerigo and Columbus met we do not know.  But very soon we  find Amerigo in the service of the merchant who supplied Columbus  with food and other necessaries for his second voyage.  It has been  thought by some that Vespucci went with Columbus on this voyage,  but that is not very likely.  It was about this time, however, that  Vespucci went on his first voyage in which he explored the coast of  Venezuela or of Central America.  It is very doubtful which.  Before  going on this voyage he had been in Spain about four years, and  not having succeeded very well as a merchant he decided to give up  trading and take to a sea life.    No voyages perhaps have been more written about and fought over than  those of Amerigo Vespucci.  Some will have it that he went only two  voyages, and say he was a braggart and a vainglorious fool if he  said he went more.  Others think that he went at least four voyages  and probably six.  And most people are now agreed that these last are  right, and that he who gave his name to the great double Continent  of America was no swaggering pretender but an honest and upright  man.    In the first two voyages that he made Vespucci sailed under the  flag of Spain.  In the second two he sailed in the service of the  King of Portugal.  But after his fourth voyage he returned again to  Spain.  There he received a large salary and the rank of captain.  Later he was made Pilot Major of Spain, and was held in high honour  till his death.    Yet in all the voyages Vespucci went, whether under the flag of  Portugal or of Spain, he was never leader.  He went as astronomer,  or as pilot, while other men captained the expeditions.    It is from Amerigo's letters alone that we gather the little we  know about his voyages.  For although he says in one of his letters  that he has written a book called \"The Four Voyages\" it has never  been found, and perhaps was never published.  One long letter,  however, which he wrote to an old schoolfellow was so interesting  that it was published and read by many people all over Europe.  It  was, says an old English writer, \"abrode in every mannes handes.\"    Amerigo's voyages led him chiefly to Central and South America and  he became convinced that South America was a continent.  So soon,  what with the voyages of Vespucci and the voyages of other great  men, it became at last quite certain that there was a vast continent  beyond the Atlantic ocean.  Map-makers, therefore, began to draw a  huge island, large enough to form in itself a continent, south of  the Equator.  They called it the New World, or the land of the Holy  Cross, but the Northern Continent was still represented on the maps  by a few small islands, or as a part of Asia.    Thus years passed.  Daring sailors still sailed the stormy seas  in search of new lands, and learned men read the tales of their  adventures and wrote new books of geography.    Then one day a professor who taught geography at the Monastery of  St.  Dié in Alsace published a little book on geography.  In it he  spoke of Europe, Asia and Africa, the three parts of the world as  known to the ancients.  Then he spoke of the fourth part which had  been discovered by Amerigo Vespucci, by which he meant what we now  call South America. \"And,\" continues this professor, \"I do not see  what is rightly to hinder us calling this part Amerige or America,  that is, the land of Americus after its discoverer Americus.\"    This is the first time the word America was ever used, and little did  this old German professor, writing in his quiet Alsatian College,  think that he was christening the great double continent of the  New World.  And as little did Amerigo think in writing his letter  to his old school fellow that he was to be looked upon as the  discoverer of the New World.    At first the new name came slowly into use and it appears for the  first time on a map made about 1514.  In this map America is shown  as a great island continent lying chiefly south of the Equator.    All the voyages which Columbus had made had been north of the  Equator.  No man yet connected the land south of the Equator with  him, and it was at first only to this south land that the name  America was given.    Thirty years and more went by.  Many voyages were made, and it  became known for certain that Columbus had not reached the shores  of India by sailing west, and that a great continent barred the  way north as well as south of the Equator.    Then a famous map-maker gave the name of America to both continents.    But many Spaniards were jealous for the fame of Columbus, and they  thought that the Northern Continent should be called Colonia or  Columbiana.  One, anxious that the part in the discovery taken by  Ferdinand and Isabella should not be forgotten, even tried to make  people call it Fer-Isabelica.    But all such efforts were in vain.  America sounded well, people  liked it, and soon every one used it.    Amerigo Vespucci himself had nothing to do with the choice, and  yet because others gave his name to the New World many hard things  have been said of him.  He has been called in scorn a \"land lubber,  \" a beef and biscuit contractor,\" and other contemptuous names.  Even one of the greatest American writers has poured scorn on him.  \"Strange,\" he says, \"that broad America must wear the name of a  thief.  Amerigo Vespucci, the pickle dealer of Seville . . . whose  highest naval rank was a boatswain's mate in an expedition that  never sailed, managed in this lying world to supplant Columbus and  baptise half the earth with his own dishonest name.\"    But it was the people of his day, and not Vespucci, who brought  the new name into use.  Vespucci himself had never any intention of  being a thief or of robbing Columbus of his glory.  He and Columbus  had always been friends, and little more than a year before he died  Columbus wrote a letter to his son Diego which Vespucci delivered.  In this letter Columbus says, \"Amerigo Vespucci, the bearer of this  letter . . . has always been wishful to please me.  He is a very  honest man. . . .  He is very anxious to do something for me, if it  is in his power.\"    It was only accident which gave the name of America to the New  World, and perhaps also the ingratitude of the great leader's own  generation.    Later generations, however, have not been so unmindful of Columbus  and his deeds; Americans have not allowed his great name to be  wholly forgotten.  The district in which the capital of the United  States is situated is called Columbia.  In Canada too there is the  great province of British Columbia, and in South America the 'United  States of Colombia, besides many towns all named in honour of the  great discoverer.    __________            Chapter 6 - How The Flag of England Was Planted on the Shores of  the New World          Christopher Columbus showed the way across the Sea of Darkness;  Amerigo Vespucci gave his name to the great double continent, but  it was another Italian, John Cabot, who first landed on the Continent  of North America.    Like Columbus, Cabot was born in Genoa.  When, however, he left his  own land he did not go to Spain like Columbus, but to England.    He had been living in England for some years when the news of the  first great voyage of Columbus was brought there.  Soon every one  was talking about the wonderful discovery from the King and his  court downward.    Cabot was a trader and a daring sailor, well used to sailing on  the stormy seas.  Yet even he was awed by what Columbus had done.  To find that way never known before, and by sailing west to reach  the east \"where the spices grow\" seemed to him \" a thing more  divine than human. \"And he too longed to follow Columbus, and maybe  discover new lands.    King Henry VII was eager to claim new lands as the Kings of  Spain and Portugal were doing.  So he listened to the persuasions  of John Cabot.  And in spite of the Pope - who had divided all the  undiscovered world between the Kings of Spain and Portugal - gave  him leave to sail forth to \"the seas of the east and west and north\"  and to plant the banner of England upon any islands, countries or  regions belonging to heathens or infidels which he might discover.  He bade his \"well-beloved John Cabot\" take five ships and set forth  on the adventure at his \" own proper costs and charges.\" For Henry  was a King \"wise but not lavish,\" and although he wanted England  to have the glory of new discoveries he was not eager to spend his  gold on them.    But where could a poor sailor find money enough for so great an  adventure?    So a year went past, and although Cabot had the King's leave  to go he did not set out.  But he did not let the King forget.  And  at length close-fisted Henry listened to \"the busy request and  supplication\" of the eager sailor, and consented to fit out one  small ship.    So at five o'clock one sweet May morning a frail little vessel  called the Matthew, with a crew of but eighteen men, sailed out  from Bristol harbour.  Many people came to see the vessel sail.  For  they were nearly all Bristol men who were thus venturing forth on  the unknown deep, and their friends crowded to the harbour to wish  them godspeed.    It was a great occasion for Bristol, and indeed for all England,  for it was the first voyage of discovery with which the English  king and people had to do.  So the tiny whitesailed ship put out to  sea, followed by the prayers and wishes of those left behind.  With  tear-dimmed eyes they watched it till it faded from view.  Then they  turned homewards to pray for the return of their loved ones.    Round the coast of Ireland the vessel sped.  But at last its green  shores faded from sight and the little company of eighteen brave  men were alone upon the"]]]
