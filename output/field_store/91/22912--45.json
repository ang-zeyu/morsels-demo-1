The student should be able  to show from Fig. 11 that the declination is equal to the sum of the  altitude and the latitude of the place diminished by 90°, or in an  equation        Declination = Altitude + Latitude - 90°.    If the declination as found from this equation is a negative number it  indicates that the sun is on the south side of the equator.    The right ascension and declination of the sun as observed on each day  should be plotted on the map and the date, written opposite it. If the  work has been correctly done, the plotted points should fall upon the  curved line (ecliptic) which runs lengthwise of the map. This line, in  fact, represents the sun's path among the stars.    Note that the hours of right ascension increase from 0 up to 24, while  the numbers on the clock dial go only from 0 to 12, and then repeat 0 to  12 again during the same day. When the sidereal time is 13 hours, 14  hours, etc., the clock will indicate 1 hour, 2 hours, etc., and 12 hours  must then be added to the time shown on the dial.    If observations of the sun's right ascension and declination are made  in the latter part of either March or September the student will find  that the sun crosses the equator at these times, and he should determine  from his observations, as accurately as possible, the date and hour of  this crossing and the point on the equator at which the sun crosses it.  These points are called the equinoxes, Vernal Equinox and Autumnal  Equinox for the spring and autumn crossings respectively, and the  student will recall that the vernal equinox is the point from which  right ascensions are measured. Its position among the stars is found by  astronomers from observations like those above described, only made with  much more elaborate apparatus.    Similar observations made in June and December show that the sun's  midday altitude is about 47° greater in summer than in winter. They show  also that the sun is as far north of the equator in June as he is south  of it in December, from which it is easily inferred that his path, the  ecliptic, is inclined to the equator at an angle of 23°.5, one half of  47°. This angle is called the obliquity of the ecliptic. The student may  recall that in the geographies the torrid zone is said to extend 23°.5  on either side of the earth's equator. Is there any connection between  these limits and the obliquity of the ecliptic? Would it be correct to  define the torrid zone as that part of the earth's surface within which  the sun may at some season of the year pass through the zenith?    EXERCISE 12.--After a half dozen observations of the sun have been  plotted upon the map, find by measurement the rate, in degrees per day,  at which the sun moves along the ecliptic. How many days will be  required for it to move completely around the ecliptic from vernal  equinox back to vernal equinox again? Accurate observations with the  elaborate apparatus used by professional astronomers show that this  period, which is called a _tropical year_, is 365 days 5 hours 48  minutes 46 seconds. Is this the same as the ordinary year of our  calendars?    26. THE PLANETS.--Any one who has watched the sky and who has made the  drawings prescribed in this chapter can hardly fail to have found in the  course of his observations some bright stars not set down on the printed  star maps, and to have found also that these stars do not remain fixed  in position among their fellows, but wander about from one constellation  to another. Observe the motion of one of these planets from night to  night and plot its positions on the star map, precisely as was done for  the moon. What kind of path does it follow?    Both the ancient Greeks and the modern Germans have called these bodies  wandering stars, and in English we name them planets, which is simply  the Greek word for wanderer, bent to our use. Besides the sun and moon  there are in the heavens five planets easily visible to the naked eye  and, as we shall see later, a great number of smaller ones visible only  in the telescope. More than 2,000 years ago astronomers began observing  the motion of sun, moon, and planets among the stars, and endeavored to  account for these motions by the theory that each wandering star moved  in an orbit about the earth. Classical and mediæval literature are  permeated with this idea, which was displaced only after a long struggle  begun by Copernicus (1543 A. D.), who taught that the moon alone of  these bodies revolves about the earth, while the earth and the other  planets revolve around the sun. The ecliptic is the intersection of the  plane of the earth's orbit with the sky, and the sun appears to move  along the ecliptic because, as the earth moves around its orbit, the sun  is always seen projected against the opposite side of it. The moon and  planets all appear to move near the ecliptic because the planes of their  orbits nearly coincide with the plane of the earth's orbit, and a narrow  strip on either side of the ecliptic, following its course completely  around the sky, is called the _zodiac_, a word which may be regarded as  the name of a narrow street (16° wide) within which all the wanderings  of the visible planets are confined and outside of which they never  venture. Indeed, Mars is the only planet which ever approaches the edge  of the street, the others traveling near the middle of the road.    [Illustration: FIG. 14.--The apparent motion of a planet.]    27. A TYPICAL CASE OF PLANETARY MOTION.--The Copernican theory,  enormously extended and developed through the Newtonian law of  gravitation (see Chapter IV), has completely supplanted the older  Ptolemaic doctrine, and an illustration of the simple manner in which it  accounts for the apparently complicated motions of a planet among the  stars is found in Figs. 14 and 15, the first of which represents the  apparent motion of the planet Mars through the constellations Aries and  Pisces during the latter part of the year 1894, while the second shows  the true motions of Mars and the earth in their orbits about the sun  during the same period. The straight line in Fig. 14, with cross ruling  upon it, is a part of the ecliptic, and the numbers placed opposite it  represent the distance, in degrees, from the vernal equinox. In Fig. 15  the straight line represents the direction from the sun toward the  vernal equinox, and the angle which this line makes with the line  joining earth and sun is called the earth's longitude. The imaginary  line joining the earth and sun is called the earth's radius vector, and  the pupil should note that the longitude and length of the radius vector  taken together show the direction and distance of the earth from the  sun--i. e., they fix the relative positions of the two bodies. The same  is nearly true for Mars and would be wholly true if the orbit of Mars  lay in the same plane with that of the earth. How does Fig. 14 show that  the orbit of Mars does not lie exactly in the same plane with the orbit  of the earth?    EXERCISE 13.--Find from Fig. 15 what ought to have been the apparent  course of Mars among the stars during the period shown in the two  figures, and compare what you find with Fig. 14. The apparent position  of Mars among the stars is merely its direction from the earth, and this  direction is represented in Fig. 14 by the distance of the planet from  the ecliptic and by its longitude.    [Illustration: FIG. 15.--The real motion of a planet.]    The longitude of Mars for each date can be found from Fig. 15 by  measuring the angle between the straight line _S V_ and the line drawn  from the earth to Mars. Thus for October 12th we may find with the  protractor that the angle between the line _S V_ and the line joining  the earth to Mars is a little more than 30°, and in Fig. 14 the position  of Mars for this date is shown nearly opposite the cross line  corresponding to 30° on the ecliptic. Just how far below the ecliptic  this position of Mars should fall can not be told from Fig. 15, which  from necessity is constructed as if the orbits of Mars and the earth lay  in the same plane, and Mars in this case would always appear to stand  exactly on the ecliptic and to oscillate back and forth as shown in Fig.  14, but without the up-and-down motion there shown. In this way plot in  Fig. 14 the longitudes of Mars as seen from the earth for other dates  and observe how the forward motion of the two planets in their orbits  accounts for the apparently capricious motion of Mars to and fro among  the stars.    [Illustration: FIG. 16.--The orbits of Jupiter and Saturn.]    28. THE ORBITS OF THE PLANETS.--Each planet, great or small, moves in  its own appropriate orbit about the sun, and the exact determination of  these orbits, their sizes, shapes, positions, etc., has been one of the  great problems of astronomy for more than 2,000 years, in which  successive generations of astronomers have striven to push to a still  higher degree of accuracy the knowledge attained by their predecessors.  Without attempting to enter into the details of this problem we may say,  generally, that every planet moves in a plane passing through the sun,  and for the six planets visible to the naked eye these planes nearly  coincide, so that the six orbits may all be shown without much error as  lying in the flat surface of one map. It is, however, more convenient to  use two maps, such as Figs. 16 and 17, one of which shows the group of  planets, Mercury, Venus, the earth, and Mars, which are near the sun,  and on this account are sometimes called the inner planets, while the  other shows the more distant planets, Jupiter and Saturn, together with  the earth, whose orbit is thus made to serve as a connecting link  between the two diagrams. These diagrams are accurately drawn to scale,  and are intended to be used by the student for accurate measurement in  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34848"],[0,"Mammals of the San Gabriel Mountains of California (#7)"],[1," after sundown hoary bats were  collected until two hours and 35 minutes after sundown; in this period  22 were caught and at least as many more observed. Many were released  after being examined, whereupon they hung on the foliage of nearby  alders to rest and dry themselves. This concentration of hoary bats may  have been due to a sudden beginning of migration with a resultant  concentration of bats at certain altitudinal belts. The warm weather  might have set off the migration. On evenings that followed subsequent  hot days no such concentration of hoary bats was seen. B. P. Bole (Hall  1946:156) observed a concentration of hoary bats on August 28, 1932, in  Esmeralda County, Nevada.    Several captive _Myotis californicus_ in a jar next to a pond in San  Antonio Canyon set up a squeaking which seemed to attract a hoary bat.  Repeatedly the large bat swooped over the jar.        _Specimens examined._--Total, 12, distributed as follows: Los      Angeles County: Mescal Canyon, 4900 ft., 2; San Antonio Canyon,      3200 ft., 2; San Antonio Canyon, 2800 ft., 8.      =Antrozous pallidus pacificus= Merriam    Pallid Bat    The pallid bat is probably the most common and characteristic bat of the  citrus belt at the Pacific base of the mountains. Only once, on May 4,  1951, was this bat taken in the mountains. On that night two individuals  were collected at 2800 feet in San Antonio Canyon. All of the other  specimens and observations were from colonies in old barns and  outbuildings in the citrus belt where these bats are found in spring,  summer, and fall.    The impression gained by examining many mixed colonies of _Antrozous_  and _Tadarida_ was that the former greatly outnumbered the latter. For  example, a small colony of bats in an old barn near San Dimas Wash  consisted of about thirty pallid bats and five freetails.    Large numbers of wings of moths of the family _Sphingidae_, and legs and  parts of the heads of Jerusalem crickets (_Stenopelmatus fuscus_) were  beneath an _Antrozous_ night-roosting place in a barn near Upland.    Pallid bats were collected in 1951, from April 16 to October 17 but  probably were active in the area into November.    Each of two pregnant females taken two miles northeast of San Dimas on  April 20, 1951, carried two embryos 4 millimeters long.        _Specimens examined._--Total, 6, distributed as follows: Los      Angeles County: 2 mi. NE San Dimas, 1200 ft., 2 (1PC); Ontario,      1100 ft., 4 (3PC).      Family MOLOSSIDAE      =Tadarida mexicana= (Saussure)    Mexican Free-tailed Bat    This bat, regularly met with in the citrus belt at the coastal base of  the range, occurred in small numbers with colonies of _Antrozous_, and  was once found with a colony of _Eptesicus_ near Covina. None of the  females taken in April 1951 was pregnant.        _Specimens examined._--Los Angeles County: 2 mi. NE San Dimas,      1200 ft., 4.      =Eumops perotis californicus= (Merriam)    Mastiff Bat    H. W. Grinnell (1918:373) mentioned individuals collected at Sierra  Madre (at the coastal base of the San Gabriels west of the study area),  and Sanborn (1932:351) reported specimens from Covina and Azusa.  Probably this bat occurs locally all along the coastal base of the  range.      Family LEPORIDAE      =Lepus californicus bennettii= Gray    California Jack Rabbit    This species was found in the coastal sage belt from Cajon Wash west to  San Gabriel Canyon and was most plentiful in thin stands of sagebrush,  and in and around citrus groves. Because of their preference for  semi-open country, jack rabbits are absent from much of the coastal belt  of sagebrush where the brush is fairly continuous, and they never were  observed in the chaparral association.    Coyotes catch many jack rabbits and regularly forage around the foothill  borders of the citrus groves for cottontails and jack rabbits.    A female examined on February 19, 1951, was pregnant, and one taken on  March 15, 1951, carried three small embryos.        _Specimens examined._--San Bernardino County: 2 mi. NW Upland,      1600 ft., 3 (PC).      =Lepus californicus deserticola= Mearns    California Jack Rabbit    There was sign of jack rabbits along the desert slope of the San  Gabriels up to about 6700 feet, one-half mile west of Big Pines. They  were fairly common in the Joshua tree belt, occurred less commonly in  the juniper belt, and were present locally in small numbers in the  pinyon-juniper association.    The population seemed to be at a low ebb from 1948 to 1952, when field  work was done on the desert slope. I often hiked for an hour or more on  the desert or juniper-covered benches without seeing a jack rabbit. The  species was commoner in washes where as many as eleven were noted in two  hours' hiking.    In December, 1951, below Graham Canyon, the leaves on large areas of  many nearly recumbent Joshua trees had been gnawed down to their bases,  and jack rabbit feces covered the ground next to these gnawings.  Probably the Joshua tree is an emergency food used by the rabbits only  when other food is scarce.    In years when the population of jack rabbits is not low they serve as a  major food for coyotes. In the Joshua tree belt below Mescal Canyon,  jack rabbit remains were fairly common in coyote feces, and tracks  repeatedly showed where some coyote had pursued a jack rabbit for a  short distance. A large male bobcat trapped in the juniper belt in  Graham Canyon had deer hair and jack rabbit remains in its stomach.        _Specimens examined._--Total, 7, distributed as follows: Los      Angeles County: 6 mi. E and 1 mi. S Llano, 3500 ft., 4; Mescal      Canyon, 4800 ft., 3.      =Sylvilagus audubonii sanctidiegi= (Miller)    Audubon Cottontail    Cottontails are common in the coastal sage scrub association and in and  around citrus groves, but generally penetrate the mountains no farther  than the lower limit of the chaparral association. They are everywhere  on coastal alluvial slopes, except in the barren washes, and prefer  patches of prickly-pear and often are loathe to leave its protection.  After completely destroying a large patch of prickly-pear in the course  of examining a wood rat house in the center of the cactus, I found  hiding, in the main nest chamber of the house, a cottontail that dashed  from its hiding place only when poked forceably with the handle of a  hoe.    Cottontails are seldom above the sage belt in the chaparral  associations, although along firebreaks and roads they occasionally  occur there. Habitually cottontails escape predators in partly open  terrain offering retreats such as low, thick brush, rock piles, and  cactus patches; but on open ground beneath dense chaparral, cottontails  may be vulnerable to predation.    Examinations of feces and stomach contents of the coyote reveals that it  preys more heavily on cottontails than on any other wild species.  Remains of several cottontails eaten by raptors were found in the sage  belt.    In April, 1951, many young cottontails were found dead on roads in the  sage belt, and a newly born cottontail was in the stomach of a coyote  trapped four miles north of Claremont, on February 7, 1952.        _Specimens examined._--Total, 3, distributed as follows: Los      Angeles County: mouth of San Antonio Canyon, 2000 ft., 1 (PC).      San Bernardino County: 2 mi. NW Upland, 1600 ft., 2 (PC).      =Sylvilagus audubonii arizonae= (J. A. Allen)    Audubon Cottontail    This subspecies was recorded on the interior slope from 5200 feet  elevation, as at the head of Grandview Canyon, down into the desert, and  was common in the sagebrush flats of the upper pinyon-juniper  association. Piles of feces under thick oak and mountain-mahogany  chaparral indicated that the rabbits often sought shelter there.  Adequate cover is a requirement for this rabbit on the desert slope of  the San Gabriels; in the juniper and Joshua tree belts the species  occurs in washes where there is fairly heavy brush, and only  occasionally elsewhere. In the foothills, when frightened from cover in  one small wash cottontails often run up over an adjacent low ridge and  seek cover in the brush of the next wash. In the wash below Graham  Canyon tracks and observations showed that cottontails were taking  refuge in deserted burrows of kit foxes.    In the pinyon-juniper association cottontails and jack rabbits probably  occur in roughly equal numbers, but in the Joshua tree belt cottontails  seem far less numerous than jack rabbits. In the course of a two hour  hike in lower Mescal Wash, at about 3500 feet, eleven jack rabbits and  two cottontails were noted.        _Specimens examined._--Total, 2, distributed as follows: Los      Angeles County: 6 mi. E and 1 mi. S Llano, 3500 ft., 1; Mescal      Canyon, 4800 ft., 1.      =Sylvilagus bachmani cinerascens= (J. A. Allen)    Brush Rabbit    Brush rabbits inhabit the Pacific slope of the mountains from about 1200  feet in the coastal sagebrush belt up to at least 4500 feet in the  chaparral, and are the only lagomorphs found commonly above the lower  edge of the chaparral association. Here they were often on steep slopes  beneath extensive and nearly impenetrable tracts of chaparral.    The ecologic niche of the brush rabbit is in brush where the plants form  continuous thickets with little open ground. In the coastal sagebrush  flats, areas supporting only scattered bushes are uninhabited by brush  rabbits, while areas grown to extensive tracts of brush harbor them.  When the brush rabbit's mode of escape from its enemies is considered,  the reason for their habitat preference becomes more clear. Almost  invariably these rabbits seek escape by running through the densest  portions of the brush, never appearing in the open; in this way they  travel quickly away from the source of danger without being observed.  Because they avoid being seen in the open, and do not seek safety  largely through running ability, they need"]]]
