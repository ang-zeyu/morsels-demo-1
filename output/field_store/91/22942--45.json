[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/36764"],[0,"In the Track of the Bookworm (#7)"],[1," my copy--not being  the possessor of the first edition--I have made a reference to Mr. Crowe's  passage, and supplied the suppressed cut from an early American copy which  cost me twenty-five cents. How many of the first edition men know of the  interesting fact narrated by Mr. Crowe? The Illustrator ought always at  least to insert the portrait of the author whenever it has been omitted by  the publisher.    Second: What to illustrate. The Illustrator should not be an imitator or  follower, but should strive after an unhackneyed subject. A man is not apt  to marry the woman who flings herself at his head; he loves the  excitement of courting; and so there is not much amusement in utilizing  common pictures, but the charm consists in hunting for scarce ones. It is  very natural to tread in others' tracks, and easy, because the market  affords plenty of material for the common subjects. Shakespeare and Walton  and Boswell's Johnson, and a few other things of that sort, have been done  to death, and there is fairer scope in something else. Biographies of  Painters, Elia's Essays, Sir Thomas Browne's \"Religio Medici\" and \"Urn  Burial,\" \"Childe Harold,\" Horace, Virgil, the Life of Bayard, or of  Vittoria Colonna, or Philip Sidney, and Sappho are charming subjects, and  not too common. A ponderous or voluminous work lends itself less  conveniently to the purpose than a small book in one or two volumes. Great  quartos and folios are mere mausoleums or repositories for expensive  prints, too huge to handle, and too extensive for any one ever to look  through, and therefore they afford little pleasure to the owners or their  guests. An illustrated Shakespeare in thirty volumes is theoretically a  very grand object, but I should never have the heart to open it, and as  for histories, I should as soon think of illustrating a dictionary. Walton  is a lovely subject, but I would adopt a small copy and keep it within two  or three volumes. After all there is nothing so charming as a single  little illustrated volume, like \"Ballads of Books,\" compiled by Brander  Matthews; Andrew Lang's \"Letters to Dead Authors,\" or \"Old Friends,\"  Friswell's \"Varia,\" the \"Book of Death,\" \"Melodies and Madrigals,\" \"The  Book of Rubies,\" Winter's \"Shakespeare's England.\"    A gentleman who published, a good many years ago, a monograph of privately  illustrated books in this country, spoke of the work that I had done in  this field, and criticised me for my \"apparent want of method,\"  \"eccentricity,\" \"madness,\" \"vagaries,\" \"omnivorousness,\" and \"lack of  speciality or system,\" and finally, although he blamed me for having  illustrated pretty much everything, he also blamed me for not having  illustrated any \"biographical works.\" This criticism seems not only  inconsistent, but without basis, for one man may not dictate to another  what he shall prefer to illustrate for his own amusement, any more than  what sort of a house or pictures he shall buy or what complexion or  stature his wife shall have. The author also did me the honor to spell my  name wrong, and did the famous Greek amatory poet the honor of mentioning  among my illustrated work, \"Odes to Anacreon.\" Would that I could find  that book!    I offer these suggestions with diffidence, and with no intention to impose  my taste upon others.    If the Illustrator can get or make something absolutely unique he is a  fortunate man. For example, I know one, stigmatized as eccentric, who has  illustrated a printed catalogue of his own library with portraits of the  authors, copies of prints in the books, and duplicates of engraved  title-pages; also one who has illustrated a collection in print or in  manuscript of his own poems; also one who has illustrated a Life of  Hercules, written by himself, printed by one of his own family, and  adorned with prints from antique gems and other subjects; and even a  lawyer who has illustrated a law book written by himself, in which he has  found place for prints so diverse and apparently out of keeping as Jonah  and the whale, John Brown, a man pacing the floor in a nightgown with a  crying baby, a \"darkey\" shot in a melon-patch, an elephant on the rampage,  Cupid, Hudibras writing a letter, Joanna Southcote, Launce and his dog, a  dog catching a boy going over a wall, Dr. Watts, Robinson Crusoe, Barnum  in the form of a hum-bug, Jacob Hall the rope dancer, Lord Mayor's  procession, Raphael discoursing to Adam, gathering sea-weed, Artemus Ward,  a whale ashore, a barber-shop, Gilpin's ride, King Lear, St. Lawrence on  his gridiron, Charles Lamb, Terpsichore, and a child tumbling into a well.  The owner of such a book may be sure that it is unique, as the man was  certain his coat of arms was genuine, because he made it himself.    Third: the Illustrator should not be in a hurry.    There are three singular things about the hunt for pictures. One is, the  moment you have your book bound, no matter how many years you may have  waited, some rare picture you wanted is sure to turn up. Hence the  reluctance of the Illustrator to commit himself to binding, a reluctance  only paralleled by that of the lover to marry the woman he had courted for  ten years, because then he would have no place to spend his evenings. (I  have had books \"in hand\" for twenty years).    Another is, when you have found your rare picture you are pretty certain  to find one or two duplicates. Prints, like accidents or crimes, seem to  come in cycles and schools. I have known a man to search in vain in thirty  print-shops in London, and coming home find what he wanted in a New York  print-shop, and two copies at that. The third is, that you are continually  coming very near the object without quite attaining it. Thus one may get  Lady Godiva alone, and the effigy of Peeping Tom on the corner of an old  house at Coventry, but to procure the whole scene is, so far as I know,  out of the question. It would seem that Mr. Anthony Comstock has put his  ban on it. So one will find it difficult to get \"God's scales,\" in which  wealth and poverty are weighed against each other, but I have had other  scales thrust at me, such as those in which the emblems of love are  weighed against those of religion, and a king against a beggar, but even  the latter is not the precise thing, for in these days there are poor  kings and rich beggars.    One opinion in which all illustrators agree seems sound, and that is, that  photographs are not to be tolerated. Photography is the most  misrepresentative of arts. But an exception may be indulged in the case  of those few celebrities who are too modest to allow themselves to be  engraved, and of whom photography furnishes the only portraiture. A  photographic copy of a rare portrait in oil is also admissible. Some also  exclude wood-cuts. I am not such a purist as that. They are frequently the  only means of illustrating a subject, and small and fine wood-cuts form  charming head and tail pieces and marginal adornments. One who eschews  wood-cuts must forego such interesting little subjects as Washington and  his little hatchet, God's scales, the skeleton in the closet, and many of  those which I have particularized. I flatter myself that I have made the  margins of a good many books very interesting by means of small wood-cuts,  of which our modern magazines provide an abundant and exquisite supply.  These furnish a copious source of specific illustration.    With their zeal illustrators are sometimes apt to be anachronistic. Every  book ought to be illustrated in the spirit and costume of its time. The  book should not be stuffed too full of prints; let a better proportion be  preserved between the text and the illustrations than Falstaff observed  between his bread and his sack. The prints should not be so numerous as to  cause the text to be forgotten, as in the case of a tedious sermon.    Probably nearly every collector expects that his treasures will be  dispersed at his death, if not sooner. But it is a serious question to the  illustrator, what will become of these precious objects upon which he has  spent so much time, thought and labor, and for which he has expended so  much money. He never cares and rarely knows, and if he knows he never  tells, how much they have cost, but he may always be certain that they  will never fetch their cost. Let us not indulge in any false dreams on  this subject. The time may have been when prints were cheap and when the  illustrator may have been able to make himself whole or even reap a  profit, but that day I believe has gone by. One can hardly expect that  his family will care for these things; the son generally thinks the  Book-Worm a bore, and the wife of one's bosom and the daughter of one's  heart usually affect more interest than they feel, and if they kept such  objects would do so from a sense of duty alone, as the ancient Romans  preserved the cinerary urns of their ancestors. For myself, I have often  imagined my grandson listlessly turning over one of my favorite  illustrated volumes, and saying, \"What a funny old duffer grandad must  have been!\" Such a book-club, as the \"Grolier,\" of New York, is a  fortunate avenue of escape from these evils. There one might deposit at  least some of his peculiar treasures, certain that they would receive good  care, be regarded with permanent interest, and keep alive his memory.    To augment his books by inserting prints is ordinarily just the one thing  which the Book-Worm can do to render them in a deeper sense his own, and  to gain for himself a peculiar proprietorship in them. Generally he cannot  himself bind them, but by this means he may render himself a coadjutor of  the author, and place himself on equal terms with the printer and the  binder.    After he has illustrated a favorite book once, it is an enjoyable  occupation for the Book-Worm to do it over again, in a different spirit  and with different pictures. \"Second thoughts are best,\" it has been"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/36830"],[0,"The Badger: A Monograph (#7)"],[1,"at times, but  generally spends most of its time in company with the fox, to which it  is greatly attached, all sleeping snugly together.\"--G. W. Duckett,  Northleach, R.S.O., Gloucestershire.    M. le Masson gives a pretty account of his tame badger, which, though it  loses much in translation, I give in English. \"I brought up and kept for  more than two years a female badger, which died at last from obesity.  She had been taken from her mother when only eight days old and suckled  by a Normandy bitch, which had already reared me some wolf whelps.  'Grisette,' as she was named, was, like all her kind, omnivorous; meat,  beetles, fruits, certain kinds of vegetables, in fact, all and  everything was welcome to her healthy appetite. When out walking in the  country, where she always readily followed me, she would unearth rats,  moles, and young rabbits, which she could scent at the bottom of their  holes. In spite of her thorough domesticity, I never succeeded in  overcoming her antipathy to dogs, and more especially to cats, which she  chased most viciously did they dare to enter the kitchen where she  reigned as queen; and where, such was her sensitiveness to cold, she had  made her bed against the wall in the chimney corner. Here in winter,  buried in her furs, she slept curled up for whole days together. But  which of us is without a fault? A little greedy without being actually  voracious, sweet Grisette sometimes ventured on to the stone-work of the  cooking-stove, and from there was able to discover from which of the  saucepans was exhaled the most savoury odour, and never did she make a  mistake on that score!\"    Du Fouilloux states in his _Venerie_:--\"Je ay veu aux blereaux prendre  deuant moy les petis cochons de laict, lesquelz ilz tray-noient tout  vifz en leur terrier. C'est vne chose certaine qu'ilz en sont plus  friandz que de toutes autres chairs: car si on passe vn carnage de  porceau par dessus leurs terriers, ilz ne faudront iamais de sorter pour  y aller.\"    The badger is credited with a special love for pork. I have seen a  statement in an old volume of the _Gentleman's Recreation_, in which the  writer refers to the taste of the badger for pork. \"They love  Hog's-flesh above any other; for take but a piece of Pork and train it  over a badger's Burrow, if he be within, you shall quickly see him  appear without.\"    Badgers are omnivorous. In their wild state their food is principally  roots and insects--they are especially fond of beetles and such  creatures as are to be found just below the surface of the ground, or  under the decaying dung of cattle. The natural history books say they  eat frogs. This may be true, but I have not observed it. I have tried  badgers in confinement with all sorts of insects and grubs, but I never  could get them to touch slugs or worms. They are carnivorous, and eat  mice, rats, voles, and moles. They will take a rabbit out of a trap,  turn it inside out, and eat all the meat, leaving the skin behind,  turned neatly with the fur inside. They are also fond of very young  rabbits, and will dig a shaft through several feet of solid earth direct  on to the nest. But when this has been stated, nearly all has been said  with regard to their propensity to damage in game coverts. I am  supported by other observers in this opinion; for instance, a recent  writer in the _Field_ who says:--\"In reply to E. T. D'Egmont's inquiry  about catching badgers, I have never found them do much harm to the  nests of winged game; but they are death on rabbits, and much resemble a  fox in finding a young one appetizing. Their skins would make good  waistcoats, but, apart from that, I would not destroy them upon any  property of my own, because they do so much more good than harm in  divers ways. We have a small property in my family, where foxes and  badgers lie up together in close proximity to a rabbit warren, upon the  inhabitants of which they feed. It is a spot practically unknown to the  outward gaze of man, as it is difficult of access; and I should fancy  that any one attempting to attack their stronghold would meet with a  stubborn resistance. Badgers mostly go seeking for food during the  night-time. Where they abound, one occasionally meets them walking  quietly along a path, with their snout low down, and occasionally giving  a kind of grunt like a mongoose. They are very fond of honey. A bag  pegged back over the entrance to their holes is a good way of catching  them.\"    They do not hunt for rabbits or game like a fox or cat, and though there  are undoubtedly instances of their taking partridge and pheasant eggs,  in my experience I have never known it done by those around me, nor from  other places where they have ample opportunity of doing so. I have known  a pheasant rear a young brood on an earth tenanted by badgers; but,  curiously enough, I have known a similar case on a fox's earth,  containing a vixen and cubs, and I cannot defend the general character  of a fox in regard to game. Still it may be taken that a badger, though  occasionally eating rabbits and rarely eggs, does not hunt for game,  ground or feathered, or do a hundredth part of the damage done by a fox  or a cat. There have always been more rabbits, hares, and pheasants in a  hollow near my house, where there is a large colony of badgers, than in  any other part of the coverts. The badger has a special weakness for  wild honey, and the grubs of wasps and humble bees. The wildest and most  unconciliatory badgers I have ever had in confinement would come out and  eat a wasp's nest, and they will hunt every bank and hedgerow in July  and August, routing out every wasp's and hornet's nest in the  country-side. A keeper told me that upon one occasion, when he was  walking along the covert edges in summer-time about nine o'clock in the  evening, his attention was arrested by a curious chapping, champing  noise, and looking over the fence he saw an old badger with his head in  a huge wasp's nest hanging in a bramble bush, and he was crunching up  and eating with the greatest gusto the wasps and grubs, quite undeterred  by the thousand angry insects that covered his head and body. In truth,  I must admit that while he is thus useful, he has been known to enter a  garden and upset the hives and purloin the honey, being as fond of it as  his larger cousins, the bears.    I must also bring another charge against him. Let me introduce this  painful subject by giving the following correspondence from the _Field_  newspaper:--    \"Wilfred writes--'I shall be obliged if you will allow me to ask your  readers whether they have known old badgers to kill fox cubs. Last year  our M.F.H. gave a neighbouring keeper a litter of cubs. He put them into  a natural empty fox-earth, and kept them shut in until they had got  fairly on their feed, and were quite at home. When he opened the earth,  and allowed them to come out, they played about, and all went well for  two or three days, when he found one at a little distance from the mouth  of the earth dead, with its skull smashed in, and very much bitten  about the head and neck. He lost the lot in the same way in a few days.  He thought an old badger or fox killed his cubs. About this time I got  five cubs, and put them into an empty artificial fox-earth. All went  well with them for some time after they played out, when the keeper  reported finding one about twenty yards from the earth dead, and killed  after the same fashion as my neighbour's cubs, and I too lost mine. In  the same artificial earth I had a natural litter this season, and the  cubs played out well; but on the keeper telling me he did not think they  were there now, I went to examine the earth, found the foxes gone, and  the earth occupied by an old badger. I had a litter of fox cubs in the  deer park here, where I live, and all went well with them until ten days  ago, when one was picked up dead, killed in the same manner as those  last year, and another was found dead yesterday. I feel quite certain  myself that they were killed by an old badger or an old fox, for I am  sure if killed by dogs they would not smash the skull and neck. I shall  be glad if any one can enlighten me on this subject.'\"    In reply to \"Wilfred\" there were several letters, among which were the  following:--        \"Sir,--Undoubtedly; every one that they can get near, and more      especially hand-reared cubs that have not got the old foxes to      protect them. I was first told this by old Jem Hills, the      well-known huntsman of the Heythrop, in his latter years; and      subsequently I had positive proof of what he said. On one      occasion a man brought a fine half-grown cub to my house which      he had picked up dead in the road he came along. It was bitten      most severely through and behind the shoulder, and I at once      remarked to a friend that was with me, 'That is the work of a      badger.' On going down to an earth where I knew there was a      natural litter, we found tracks of a badger all about the place,      as if he had been hunting the cubs. Having at the time eight      cubs that I was hand-rearing in an artificial drain, I thought      it was high time to look after them, for though regularly fed,      I did not always watch to see whether they all came to feed.      However, I did so that evening, and only two came, and these      looked very wild and scared. I then searched the plantation, and      picked up four of my cubs killed quite recently, and bitten in      the same savage way. A few weeks after we killed a big boar      badger in the drain. Several years later, I was again rearing      some hand-bred cubs, and everything went well until they were a      good size, when one morning I found one of them killed,      evidently by a badger; and I eventually took four more of them,      and the others were all driven away. This badger beat me for      some little time, but I got him at"]]]
