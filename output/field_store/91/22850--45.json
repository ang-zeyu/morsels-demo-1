Berliner, \"the child was initiated  into the observance of religious precepts, and was put upon his  guard against their transgression.  His parents had but one aim,  to inculcate in him the religion of his ancestors and render the  Law, the source of this religion, accessible to him.  He was thus  inured to the struggle of life, in which his shield was belief in  God.  The mother also took part in the rearing of her child.  Her  lullabies were often prayers or Biblical hymns, and although the  women, as a rule, did not receive a thorough education, they  effectually helped to make observant devotees of the Law of their  children.\"[13]  Five or six was the age at which Hebrew was begun  to be taught to the child, and the occasion was usually  celebrated by a picturesque ceremony full of poetic feeling.  On  the morning of the Pentecost, the festival which commemorates the  giving of the Law on Mt. Sinai, or on the morning of the  Rejoicing of the Law, the day devoted above all others to  honoring the Law, the child, dressed in his holiday clothes and  wrapped in a Tallit, was led to the synagogue by his father or by  a scholar who acted as sponsor.  In the synagogue the child  listened to the reading of the Law; then he was led to the house  of the teacher to whom his education was to be entrusted.  The  teacher took him in his arms, \"as a nursing-father carrieth the  sucking child,\" and presented him with a tablet, on which were  written the Hebrew alphabet and some verses from the Bible  applicable to the occasion.  The tablet was then spread with  honey, which the child ate as if to taste the sweetness of the  Law of God.  The child was also shown a bun made by a young  maiden, out of flour kneaded together with milk and with oil or  honey, and bearing among other inscriptions the words of Ezekiel:  \"Son of man, cause thy belly to eat, and fill thy bowels with  this roll that I give thee.  Then did I eat it; and it was in my  mouth as honey for sweetness.\" Other Biblical passages were  inscribed on the shell of an egg, and after they were read, the  bun and the egg as well as apples and other fruit were eaten by  the pupils present.    This ceremony, marred only by the introduction of superstitious  practices, such as the conjuring up of evil demons, was well  adapted to stamp itself on the child's mind, and its naive  symbolism was bound to make a profound impression upon his  imagination.  Pagan antiquity knew of nothing so delicate and at  the same time so elevated in sentiment.  Pindar, and Horace after  him, conceived the fancy that the bees of Hymettus alighted on  the child's brow and dropped rich honey upon it.  The Jewish  celebration of a new period in childhood, though not a poetic  fiction, is none the less charming and picturesque.  It shows how  precious was the cultivation of the mind to a people whom the  world delights to represent as absorbed by material interests and  consumed by the desire for wealth.  Education has always been  highly valued among the Jews, who long acted up to the saying of  Lessing: \"The schoolmaster holds the future in his hands.\"  The  religious law is a system of instruction, the synagogue is a  school.  It will redound to the eternal honor of Judaism that it  raised the dissemination of knowledge to the height of a  religious precept.  At a time when among the Christians knowledge  was the special privilege of the clergy, learning was open to  every Jew, and, what is still finer, the pursuit of it was  imposed upon him as a strict obligation.  The recalcitrant, say  the legalists, is compelled to employ a tutor for his child.  Every scholar in Israel is obliged to gather children about him;  and the rabbinical works contain most detailed recommendations  concerning the organization of schools and methods of  instruction.  One comes upon principles and rules of pedagogy  unusually advanced for their time.  For instance, teachers were  forbidden to have more than forty pupils, and were not to use a  more severe means of punishment than whipping with a small strap.  In Christian schools, on the contrary, pedagogic methods were  backward and barbarous.  It was considered an excellent plan to  beat all pupils with the ferule [ferrule sic], in order to make  knowledge enter the heads of the bad and to keep the good from  the sin of pride.    Among the Jews instruction was tempered to suit the faculty of  the learner.  First the child was taught to read Hebrew,  translate the daily prayers, and recite the more important of  them by heart.  Then the Pentateuch beginning with Leviticus was  explained to him, and, if necessary, it was translated into  French.  It was read with a special chant.  Rashi, be it said  parenthetically, by his commentary gave this Bible instruction a  more solid basis.  Not until the pupil was a little older did he  study the Talmud, which is so well qualified to develop  intelligence and clear-headedness.  His elementary education  completed, and provided he had shown taste and inclination for  the more difficult studies, the young man went to special  schools.  But if he had not shown signs of progress, he was  taught simply to read Hebrew and understand the Bible.    The author of a curious pedagogic regulation in the middle ages  fixes the whole term of study at fourteen years: the seven years  preceding the religious majority of the child are spent in the  local school, at the study of the Pentateuch (two years), at the  study of the rest of the Bible (two years), and at the study of  the easier Talmudic treatises (three years).  The remaining seven  years are devoted to the higher study of the Talmud in an academy  outside the birthplace of the youth.  This education was obtained  sometimes from private teachers, and sometimes in schools founded  and maintained at the expense of the community or even of  educational societies.    A sufficiently clear idea may thus be obtained of Rashi's early  education; and in assuming that he soon distinguished himself for  precocity and for maturity of thought, we shall not be shooting  wide of the mark.  But legend will not let its heroes off so  cheaply; legend will have it that Rashi, in order to complete his  education, travelled [traveled sic] to the most distant lands.  Not satisfied with having him go to the south of France, to  Narbonne, to the school of Moses ha-Darshan (who had doubtless  died before Rashi's coming to his school was a possibility), or  to Lunel, to attend the school of Zerahiah ha-Levi (not yet  born), tradition maintains that at the age of thirty-three Rashi  made the tour of almost the whole world as then known, in order  to atone for a mistake made by his father, who regretted having  lost a precious object, and also in order to assure himself that  his commentaries had not been surpassed.  He is said to have  traversed Italy, Greece, Egypt, Palestine, and Persia, returning  by way of Germany.    So long a voyage must, of course, have been marked by a number of  events.  In Egypt, Rashi became the disciple-the more exigent  say, the intimate friend-of Maimonides, who, as we all know, was  born in 1135, nearly a century later than Rashi.  Maimonides, as  fiction recounts, conceived a great affection for Rashi, and  imparted to him all his own learning.  Not to fall behind  Maimonides in courtesy, Rashi showed him his commentaries, and  Maimonides at the end of his life declared that he would have  written more commentaries, had he not been anticipated by the  French rabbi.    While in the Orient Rashi is represented as having met a monk,  and the two discussed the superiority of their respective  religions.  At the inn the monk suddenly fell sick.  Rashi,  caring for him as for a brother, succeeded in curing him by means  of a miraculous remedy.  The monk wanted to thank him, but Rashi  interrupted, saying: \"Thou owest me nothing in return.  Divided  as we are by our religions, we are united by charity, which my  religion imposes upon me as a duty.  If thou comest upon a Jew in  misfortune, aid him as I have aided thee.\"  Fictitious though the  story be, it is not unworthy the noble character of Rashi.  He  <I>was</I> noble, therefore noble deeds are ascribed to him.    On his return Rashi is said to have passed through Prague,  whither his reputation had preceded him.  On his entrance into  the synagogue, the declamations of the faithful proved to him the  admiration they felt for the young rabbi of only thirty-six  years.  The pleasure manifested by the Jews irritated Duke  Vratislav, who had the famous rabbi arrested, brought before him,  and questioned in the presence of his counsellor [counselor sic],  the Bishop of Olmutz.  The bishop raising his eyes recognized in  the prisoner the Jew who had saved his life, and he told the  story to the duke.  The order was immediately given to set Rashi  free; but the people, thinking the Jews lost, had fallen upon the  Jewish quarter.  Rashi threw himself at the feet of the  sovereign, and begged protection for his brethren.  Provided with  a safe-conduct, Rashi went forth to appease the mob.  The Jews in  their great joy saluted him as their savior.  Tradition adds that  the duke conceived great admiration for the Jewish scholar, and  made him one of his advisers.    Another, even sweeter reward, awaited him.  Rebecca, the daughter  of his host, fell in love with him, and, as Rashi returned the  feeling, her father consented to the marriage.    But all this is on the face of it romance.  Certain passages in  Rashi's works give abundant proof that Rashi never visited either  Palestine or Babylonia, and his conception of the geography of  the two countries is utterly fantastic.  For instance, he  believed that the Euphrates flowed from the one land into the  other.  Moreover, he himself admitted that his ideas concerning  them were gathered"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31671"],[0,"Plain Talks on Avoided Subjects (#7)"],[1,"from the exactly opposite cause--abuse: the  organs become worn out, and hence arises atrophy. Physiologically  considered, it is not a fact that the power of secreting semen is  annihilated in well-formed adults leading a healthy life and yet  remaining continent. The function goes on in the organ always, from  puberty to old age. Semen is secreted sometimes slowly, sometimes  quickly, and very frequently under the influence of the will. No  continent man need be deterred by this apocryphal fear of atrophy of the  testes from living a chaste life. It is a device of the unchaste--a lame  excuse for their own incontinence, unfounded on any physiological law.  The testes will take care that their action is not interfered with.\"    Many and many a time have I heard it regretted and bemoaned, on account  of the many troubles they had seemed to cause, that the sexual organs  exist. It is the lewd thoughts and uses to which they are put that  causes all this misery, and there is always that \"first thought\" which  should not be harbored. Cast away the impure thoughts, rise above them,  and one is safe! Pure thoughts can _never_ lead to harm.    The generative organs, with their functions and uses, are most closely  interwoven with the highest destiny and well being of the race  physically, mentally and spiritually; they are a part of us, without  which there would be no men and women, lovers and loved ones, fathers  and mothers, brothers and sisters. We must then happily accept the  situation as it is, and our bodies, parts and passions as they are; for  they are all indispensable, high and holy, when kept in an orderly and  chaste condition. We only need the above knowledge and its application  to make ourselves as happy in the enjoyment of these organs as it was  designed by our Creator that we should be.    To rise above the sexual temptations that may be more or less  experienced by many and perhaps by all, requires an effort of course,  and frequently a very great effort; but let it be borne in mind that  all temptations to do wrong, require effort to overcome them; and as a  rule, the greater the evil we are tempted to commit the greater is the  effort needed to overcome it. Now, as shown above, since sexual matters  are so thoroughly interwoven with the highest destinies of the human  race, physically, mentally and spiritually, there is scarcely any  function of higher import, allotted to any individual, than that  assigned to the genital organs. No function more deeply concerns the  healthfulness of the body, the clearness and brilliancy of the  intellect, or the purity and sincerity of the soul itself.    Several times in the course of this book I have referred to the term  \"abuse.\" By \"abuse,\" I mean precisely what _Lallemand_ so forcibly  expresses as follows: \"_I understand by the term abuse, when applied to  the organs of generation, any irregular or premature exercise of their  functions; any application of them which cannot have, as its result, the  propagation of the species._\"    Look at the habitual masturbator! See how thin, pale and haggard he  appears; how his eyes are sunken; how long and cadaverous is his cast of  countenance; how irritable he is and how sluggish, mentally and  physically; how afraid he is to meet the eye of his fellows; feel his  damp and chilling hand, so characteristic of great vital exhaustion.  Taken as a class, how terrible are their lost virility, their miserable  night's sleep, their convulsions and their shrunken limbs. They keep by  themselves, seeking charm in solitude and are fit companions for no one;  they dare not read their Bible, they cannot commune with good angels nor  with the Lord, our Saviour. Is not this picture deplorable? It is at the  last end of the chain I admit, but it is reached link after link, one at  a time; and the first link was forged when the first temptation in the  mind was first favored and finally yielded to. The above picture is a  true one and shows how intimately connected are the soul, the mind and  the body with this whole subject. Man in a healthy state need not and  should not lose one drop of seminal fluid by his own hand, by nightly  emissions or pollutions, or in any way, until he becomes conjoined to a  wife of his choice in the holy bonds of matrimony. Every time the seed  of his body is lost in a disorderly or unnatural way, he injures the  finest textures of his brain correspondingly, as well as the finest and  most exalted condition of his mind and soul, because the act proceeds in  its incipiency from a willful prostitution of these higher powers.    When sexual thoughts and temptations arise in one's mind, even very  young men are capable of putting them away, urged by the thought that  tampering with one's generative organs is wrong. He should intuitively  feel that it is something akin to theft, or a crime of some worse sort,  for him to indulge in solitary vice and he should intuitively feel an  inward reproach for all such meditations. When one is sorely tempted in  these matters, as is often the case, let him reflect that he was not  created to indulge in such pleasures by himself, and that to do so is a  crime, a sin against the God of Heaven; that it is his destiny, his  privilege and one of the uses of his life to share such enjoyments with  the wife of his bosom; and that all excitement or dallying with this  part of his nature before marriage only serves to weaken his sexual  powers, as well as his mind and body; also, that it mars his sexual uses  and will detract from his sexual pleasures in the married life. Sexual  indulgence of any sort in a young man is a loss, not only to himself but  also, prospectively, to that dear girl whom he will some day make his  wife. Such reflections will often drive away the temptation entirely. If  they are not sufficient to do so let him read some interesting book that  shall take his mind away from the subject; or, that failing, let him  take exercise, vigorous exercise--pushed to fatigue, if necessary. If  these states of temptation occur in bed at night, let him rise and read,  plunge his arm into very cold water, or if necessary go forth into the  open air and seek relief in a rapid walk. It is better to go to any  amount of trouble and to endure any physical discomfort, than to  sacrifice one's chastity, the loss of which can never be replaced.    A young man naturally desires and expects chastity of the strictest  order in the young woman of his choice for a wife. Who would marry a  girl, no matter how beautiful or how many and varied her accomplishments  if it were known that she had granted her favors to any other man? And  yet, what less has _she_ a perfect right to require from a young man who  presumes to pay his addresses to her? This consideration, too, should  serve as a restraint to any amorous desires that might infest a man's  mind. It is wonderful how keen are the perceptions of a pure minded  young lady to detect even an approach to licentiousness in the male. He  is abhorrent to her and his very sphere betrays him.    With the facts of the preceding pages, contained in this chapter being  known, it does seem as if every man would keep himself pure from all  carnal associations and use the utmost care not to prostitute his mind,  that he may approach the nuptial altar as pure in mind and body as he  would have her who is to become the idol of his heart.    Now this is all very beautiful in theory and desirable in practice, but  _is it practical_? Can man so school himself in self denial as to  accomplish this end? Are there not real physiological facts existing  which utterly preclude the possibility of this most desirable result? Do  not, as has been alleged by some writers, the testicles of man secrete  semen until they become so surcharged that emission becomes absolutely  necessary, and does not this accumulation actually produce such sexual  excitement that man feels compelled to seek relief in some way? I  answer, most unhesitatingly, NO! The above questions are all theories  and utterly devoid of fact.    Would Almighty God command, \"Thou shalt _not_ commit adultery,\" and then  so create man as to compel him to break his Divine injunction?    Abundance of proof is at hand to substantiate this sweeping remark of  mine, were this the place to produce it. Seminal fluid is abundantly  secreted and produced only during the height of sexual excitement in the  male. As Acton remarks: \"It is a highly organized fluid requiring the  expenditure of much vital force in its elaboration and its expulsion.\"  It is secreted from the blood of his body and the whole man physically,  mentally and spiritually is concerned and represented in its product;  consequently the action requires an effort of the whole man, and, if  often repeated, the effect is very exhausting to the physical powers, to  the mind and to the brain. Let this be another warning to remain in  purity of heart.    We have said in the preceding pages that man, in a healthy state, need  not lose a drop of seminal fluid until after marriage. There are many  abnormal causes resulting in what are called wet dreams, nightly  pollutions, spermatorrhoea, prostatic emission during stool or  urination, also diurnal emissions without erection. These may result  from over study, from errors in diet such as use of coffee, highly  seasoned food, wines, spirituous liquors or drugs of various  kinds--though perhaps prescribed by a physician. When these troubles  arise from constitutional disorders, a skillful physician must be  consulted at once. Errors in diet and the taking of drugs causing this  trouble must of course be discontinued. [G]\"Certain medicines--as  astringents, purgatives, narcotics, stimulants and diuretics  especially--may bring on conditions from which spermatorrhoea may  arise.\" Among other causes Lallemand refers to the use of quinine,  tobacco and, particularly _alcohol_.
