These are really only modifications of Stephenson's  principle--namely, the employment of _two_ eccentrics set at equal  angles to and on opposite sides of the crank. There are three other  forms of link-reversing gear, and nearly a dozen types of _radial_  reversing devices; but as we have already described the three most  commonly used on locomotives and ships, there is no need to give  particulars of these.    Before the introduction of Stephenson's gear a single eccentric was used  for each cylinder, and to reverse the engine this eccentric had to be  loose on the axle. \"A lever and gear worked by a treadle on the  footplate controlled the position of the eccentrics. When starting the  engine, the driver put the eccentrics out of gear by the treadle; then,  by means of a lever he raised the small-ends[5] of the eccentric rods,  and, noting the position of the cranks, or, if more convenient, the  balance weight in the wheels, he, by means of another handle, moved the  valves to open the necessary ports to steam and worked them by hand  until the engine was moving; then, with the treadle, he threw the  eccentrics over to engage the studs, at the same time dropping the  small-ends of the rods to engage pins upon the valve spindles, so that  they continued to keep up the movement of the valve.\"[6] One would  imagine that in modern shunting yards such a device would somewhat delay  operations!      PISTON VALVES.    In marine engines, and on many locomotives and some stationary engines,  the D-valve (shown in Figs. 30-32) is replaced by a piston valve, or  circular valve, working up and down in a tubular seating. It may best be  described as a rod carrying two pistons which correspond to the faces of  a D-valve. Instead of rectangular ports there are openings in the tube  in which the piston valve moves, communicating with the steam-ways into  the cylinder and with the exhaust pipe. In the case of the D-valve the  pressure above it is much greater than that below, and considerable  friction arises if the rubbing faces are not kept well lubricated. The  piston valve gets over this difficulty, since such steam as may leak  past it presses on its circumference at all points equally.      SPEED GOVERNORS.    [Illustration: FIG. 33.--A speed governor.]    Practically all engines except locomotives and those known as  \"donkey-engines\"--used on cranes--are fitted with some device for  keeping the rotatory speed of the crank constant within very narrow  limits. Perhaps you have seen a pair of balls moving round on a seating  over the boiler of a threshing-engine. They form part of the \"governor,\"  or speed-controller, shown in principle in Fig. 33. A belt driven by a  pulley on the crank shaft turns a small pulley, P, at the foot of the  governor. This transmits motion through two bevel-wheels, G, to a  vertical shaft, from the top of which hang two heavy balls on links, K  K. Two more links, L L, connect the balls with a weight, W, which has a  deep groove cut round it at the bottom. When the shaft revolves, the  balls fly outwards by centrifugal force, and as their velocity increases  the quadrilateral figure contained by the four links expands laterally  and shortens vertically. The angles between K K and L L become less and  less obtuse, and the weight W is drawn upwards, bringing with it the  fork C of the rod A, which has ends engaging with the groove. As C  rises, the other end of the rod is depressed, and the rod B depresses  rod O, which is attached to the spindle operating a sort of shutter in  the steam-pipe. Consequently the supply of steam is throttled more and  more as the speed increases, until it has been so reduced that the  engine slows, and the balls fall, opening the valve again. Fig. 34 shows  the valve fully closed. This form of governor was invented by James  Watt. A spring is often used instead of a weight, and the governor is  arranged horizontally so that it may be driven direct from the crank  shaft without the intervention of bevel gearing.    [Illustration: FIG. 34.]    The Hartwell governor employs a link motion. You must here picture the  balls raising and lowering the _free end_ of the valve rod, which  carries a block moving in a link connected with the eccentric rod. The  link is pivoted at the upper end, and the eccentric rod is attached to  the lower. When the engine is at rest the end of the valve rod and its  block are dropped till in a line with the eccentric rod; but when the  machinery begins to work the block is gradually drawn up by the  governor, diminishing the movement of the valve, and so shortening the  period of steam admission to the cylinder.    Governors are of special importance where the _load_ of an engine is  constantly varying, as in the case of a sawmill. A good governor will  limit variation of speed within two per cent.--that is, if the engine is  set to run at 100 revolutions a minute, it will not allow it to exceed  101 or fall below 99. In _very_ high-speed engines the governing will  prevent variation of less than one per cent., even when the load is at  one instant full on, and the next taken completely off.      MARINE GOVERNORS.    These must be more quick-acting than those used on engines provided with  fly-wheels, which prevent very sudden variations of speed. The screw is  light in proportion to the engine power, and when it is suddenly raised  from the water by the pitching of the vessel, the engine would race till  the screw took the water again, unless some regulating mechanism were  provided. Many types of marine governors have been tried. The most  successful seems to be one in which water is being constantly forced by  a pump driven off the engine shaft into a cylinder controlling a  throttle-valve in the main steam-pipe. The water escapes through a leak,  which is adjustable. As long as the speed of the engine is normal, the  water escapes from the cylinder as fast as it is pumped in, and no  movement of the piston results; but when the screw begins to race, the  pump overcomes the leak, and the piston is driven out, causing a  throttling of the steam supply.      CONDENSERS.    The _condenser_ serves two purposes:--(1) It makes it possible to use  the same water over and over again in the boilers. On the sea, where  fresh water is not obtainable in large quantities, this is a matter of  the greatest importance. (2) It adds to the power of a compound engine  by exerting a back pull on the piston of the low-pressure cylinder while  the steam is being exhausted.    [Illustration: FIG. 35.--The marine condenser.]    Fig. 35 is a sectional illustration of a marine condenser. Steam enters  the condenser through the large pipe E, and passes among a number of  very thin copper tubes, through which sea-water is kept circulating by a  pump. The path of the water is shown by the featherless arrows. It comes  from the pump through pipe A into the lower part of a large cap covering  one end of the condenser and divided transversely by a diaphragm, D.  Passing through the pipes, it reaches the cap attached to the other end,  and flows back through the upper tubes to the outlet C. This arrangement  ensures that, as the steam condenses, it shall meet colder and colder  tubes, and finally be turned to water, which passes to the well through  the outlet F. In some condensers the positions of steam and water are  reversed, steam going through the tubes outside which cold water  circulates.      [3] Also called _ports_.    [4] The bores of the cylinders are in the proportion of 4: 6: 9. The  stroke of all three is the same.    [5] The ends furthest from the eccentric.

How a turbine works--The De Laval turbine--The Parsons       turbine--Description of the Parsons turbine--The expansive action       of steam in a Parsons turbine--Balancing the thrust--Advantages of       the marine turbine.      More than two thousand years ago Hero of Alexandria produced the first  apparatus to which the name of steam-engine could rightly be given. Its  principle was practically the same as that of the revolving jet used to  sprinkle lawns during dry weather, steam being used in the place of  water. From the top of a closed cauldron rose two vertical pipes, which  at their upper ends had short, right-angle bends. Between them was hung  a hollow globe, pivoted on two short tubes projecting from its sides  into the upright tubes. Two little L-shaped pipes projected from  opposite sides of the globe, at the ends of a diameter, in a plane  perpendicular to the axis. On fire being applied to the cauldron, steam  was generated. It passed up through the upright, through the pivots, and  into the globe, from which it escaped by the two L-shaped nozzles,  causing rapid revolution of the ball. In short, the first steam-engine  was a turbine. Curiously enough, we have reverted to this primitive type  (scientifically developed, of course) in the most modern engineering  practice.      HOW A TURBINE WORKS.    In reciprocating--that is, cylinder--engines steam is admitted into a  chamber and the door shut behind it, as it were. As it struggles to  expand, it forces out one of the confining walls--that is, the  piston--and presently the door opens again, and allows it to escape when  it has done its work. In Hero's toy the impact of the issuing molecules  against other molecules that have already emerged from the pipes was  used. One may compare the reaction to that exerted by a thrown stone on  the thrower. If the thrower is standing on skates, the reaction of the  stone will cause him to glide backwards, just as if he had pushed off  from some fixed object. In the case of the _reaction_--namely, the  Hero-type--turbine the nozzle from which the steam or water issues  moves, along with bodies to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28569"],[0,"Makers of Many Things (#7)"],[1,"as the whole thing was useless as soon as the pen was worn out, but  they were highly esteemed because they lasted longer than quills and  did not have to be mended. After a while separate pens were  manufactured that could be slipped into a holder; and one improvement  after another followed until little by little the cheap, convenient  writing tool that we have to-day was produced.    A pen is a small thing, but each one is worked upon by twenty to  twenty-four persons before it is allowed to be sold. The material is  the best steel. It comes in sheets five feet long and nineteen inches  wide, and about one fortieth of an inch thick, that is, three times  as thick as the finished pen. The first machine cuts the sheet  crosswise into strips from two to three inches wide, varying according  to the size of the pen to be made. These strips are put into iron  boxes and kept at a red heat for a number of hours to anneal or soften  them. Then they pass between heavy rollers, a process which not only  helps to toughen them, but also stretches the steel so that it is now  fifty inches long instead of nineteen.    At least six or seven people have handled the material already, and  even now there is nothing that looks like pens; but the next machine  cuts them out, by dies, of course. The points interlap; and the  cutting leaves odd-shaped openwork strips of steel for the scrap-heap.  This part of the work is very quick, for the machine will cut  thousands of pens in an hour. Now is when the little hole above the  slit is punched and the side slits cut. To make the steel soft and  pliable, it must be annealed again, kept red hot for several hours,  and then cooled. Thus far it has looked like a tiny fence paling, but  at length it begins to resemble a pen, for it is now stamped with  whatever letters or designs may be desired, usually the name of the  maker and the name and number of the variety of pen, and it is pressed  between a pair of dies to form it into a curve. The last annealing  left the metal soft so that all this could be done, but too soft to  work well as a pen; and it has to be heated red hot again, and then  dropped into cold oil to harden it. Centrifugal force, which helps in  so many manufactures, drives the oil away, and the pens are dried in  sawdust. They are now sufficiently hard, but too brittle. They must be  tempered. To do this, they are placed in an iron cylinder over a fire,  and the cylinder revolved till the pen is as elastic as a spring.    The pen is of the correct shape, is tough and elastic; and now it is  put into \"tumbling barrels\" which revolve till it is bright and ready  for the finishing touches. If you look closely at the outside of a  steel pen just above the nib, you will see that across it run tiny  lines. They have a use, for they hold the ink back so that it will  not roll down in drops, and they help to make the point more springy  and easier to write with.    The pen must be slit up from the point. This is done by a machine, and  a most accurate one, for the cut must go exactly through the center of  the point and not reach beyond the little hole that was punched. Only  one thing is lacking now to make the pen a useful member of society,  ready to do its work in the world; and that is to grind off the points  and round them in order to keep them from sticking into the paper.    After so much careful work, it does seem as if not one pen out of a  thousand could be faulty; but every one has to be carefully examined  to make sure that the cutting, piercing, marking, forming, tempering,  grinding, and slitting, are just what they should be. These pens carry  the maker's name, and a few poor ones getting into the market might  spoil the sale of thousands of boxes; therefore the examiner sits  before a desk covered with black glass and looks at every pen. The  faulty ones are heated so that they cannot be used, and they go to  the scrap-heap.    Now the pens are ready so far as usefulness goes, but people have  preferences in color. Some prefer bronze, some gray, and some black;  so off the pens go to the tempering-room, their last trip, and there  are heated in a revolving cylinder till the right color appears; then  they are chilled and lacquered, put into boxes, labeled, packed, and  sold for such low prices that the good folk of a century ago, who  paid from twenty-five to fifty cents for a pen, would have opened  their eyes in amazement. When the typewriter was invented, some  people said, \"That will be the death of the steel pen\"; but as a  matter of fact, it has greatly increased its sale. The typewriter  makes writing so easy and so quick that many more letters are written  than formerly. All these letters have to be answered, and few people  compared with the whole number own typewriters, and therefore the pen  still holds its place.    The lacquer on a steel pen protects it until it has been used for a  while. After that, it will rust, if it is not wiped, and it will wear  out whether it is wiped or not. All that the gold pen asks is not  to be bent or broken, and it will last almost forever. It has the  flexibility of the quill, but does not have to be \"mended.\" Gold pens  are made in much the same way as are steel pens; but just at the point  a tiny shelf is squeezed. Upon this shelf a bit of the alloy of two  exceedingly hard metals, iridium and osmium, is secured by melting  the gold around it; and it is this bit which stands all the wear of  rubbing on the paper. When gold pens were first made, tiny bits of  diamonds or rubies were soldered on for points; but they were  expensive, and they had a disagreeable fashion of falling off.    A century ago, writers would have thought it the height of luxury to  have a gold pen; but now they are not satisfied unless they can be  saved the trouble of dipping it into an inkstand, and they look upon  the fountain pen as their special friend. The fountain pen carries its  supplies with it. The pen itself is like any other gold pen, but the  barrel is full of ink. A little tube carries the ink to the point, and  the slight bending back of the pen as one writes lets it run out upon  the paper. At the end of the slit, at the back of the pen, is a hole  to let air into the barrel as the ink runs out. A perfect fountain pen  ought to be prepared to write--without shaking--whenever the cap is  taken off, and not to refuse to work so long as a drop of ink remains  in the barrel. It should never drop ink at the point and, whether the  point is up or down, it should never leak there or anywhere else.    The stylographic pen is quite a different article. There is no pen to  it; the writing is done with the end of a needle which projects  through a hole at the point. The barrel and point are full of ink; but  even if the pen is held point down, it will not leak because the  needle fills up the hole. When you press the point on paper to write,  the needle falls back just enough to let out what ink is needed. The  flow stops the instant the pen ceases to touch the paper. The special  advantage of the stylographic is that the mere weight of the pen is  sufficient pressure, and therefore many hours of writing do not tire  the muscles of the hand. The advantage of the fountain pen is that it  has the familiar action of the gold pen, and that it will adapt itself  to any style of handwriting.    A pen of almost any kind is a valuable article, but for  rough-and-ready use we should find it hard to get on without its  humble friend, the lead pencil. A lead pencil, by the way, has not a  particle of lead in it. The \"lead\" is all graphite, or plumbago. Years  ago sticks of lead were used for marking, and made a pale-gray line.  When graphite was introduced, its mark was so black that people called  it black lead, and the name has stuck. No one who has ever tried to  use a pencil of real lead could fail to appreciate graphite, and when  a graphite mine was discovered in England, it was guarded by armed men  as watchfully as if it had been a mine of diamonds. That mine was  exhausted long ago, but many others have been found. The best graphite  in the world comes from Ceylon and Mexico.    When graphite was first used for pencils, it was cut into slabs and  these slabs into small strips. The broken and powdered graphite was  not used until it was discovered that it could be mixed with clay and  so made into sticks. In a lead pencil there are only three substances,  graphite, clay, and wood, but a really good one must be manufactured  with as much care as if it were made up of twenty. First of all, the  graphite is ground and ground and ground, until, if you take a pinch  of it between your thumb and finger, you can hardly feel that anything  is there. It is now sifted through fine silk and mixed with water and  finely powdered clay, and becomes a wet, inky mass. This clay comes  from Austria and Bohemia and is particularly smooth and fine. The  amount put in is carefully weighed. If you have a hard pencil, it was  made by using considerable clay; if your pencil is soft, by using very  little; and if it is very soft and black, it is possible that a little  lampblack was added.    This inky mass is ground together between millstones for several  weeks. Then it goes between rollers, and at length is squeezed  through a die and comes out in soft, doughy black strings. These are  the \"leads\" of the pencils. They have been thoroughly wet, and now  they must be made thoroughly dry. They are laid on boards, then taken  off, cut into pieces the length of a pencil, and put into ovens and  baked for hours in a heat twenty times as great as that of a hot  summer day. They certainly ought to be well dried and ready for the  wood. The red cedar of Florida, Tennessee, Georgia, and Alabama is  the best wood for pencils because it is soft and has a fine, straight  grain. It is cut into slabs about as long as one pencil, as wide as  six, and a little"]]]
