His creditors combined to push him to the wall. During  one week five or six executions were taken out against him. His  brother Solomon was the only one outside the Church, willing to lend  him a helping hand in his financial troubles, resulting from the  inimical actions of his neighbors and old-time associates. His brother  Charles, who had formerly befriended him, was dead. But the Lord  opened his way, much to the chagrin of his persecutors, and he  obtained money to meet his liabilities, so that none of his property  was sold at auction.    In September following the organization of the branch in Mendon,  Brigham Young's wife, Miriam, died. She had been feeble for months,  but in her expiring moments, filled with a supernatural vitality, she  clapped her hands and praised God, calling upon all around to join her  in so doing. She continued in this happy state until she breathed her  last, moving her lips in prayer when her voice could no longer be  heard. Heber remarks that the death-bed scene of this zealous and  devoted Saint was to him another testimony of the truth and power of  the everlasting gospel. Vilate Kimball took charge of Miriam's two  little daughters, and, thenceforth, until after they removed from  Mendon, the families of Brigham and Heber were as one.    In the meantime, the latter had been ordained an Elder, under the  hands of Joseph Young, and labored with him and Brigham in the  ministry. They visited Genesee, Avon and Lyonstown, baptizing many and  building up branches of the Church. The following incident, related by  Heber, shows how powerfully the Holy Ghost wrought through him in his  ministrations:    \"Brother Ezra Landon preached in Avon and Genesee, baptized eighteen  or twenty, and being afraid to confirm them and promise the Holy  Ghost, he requested me to confirm them, which I did according to the  best of my knowledge, pronouncing but a few words on the head of each  one, and invariably saying, 'receive ye the Holy Ghost in the name of  Jesus Christ.' Immediately the Holy Ghost fell upon them, and several  commenced speaking in tongues before they arose from their knees, and  we had a joyful time. Some ten or twelve spoke in tongues, neither of  whom had ever heard any person speak in tongues before, they being the  first baptized in that place.\"    The region in which he was laboring is thus interestingly described:    \"From the time Father Bosley located near Avon, he found and plowed up  axes and irons, and had sufficient to make his mill irons, and had  always abundance of iron on hand without purchasing.    \"In the towns of Bloomfield, Victor, Manchester, and in the regions  round about, there were hills upon the tops of which were  entrenchments and fortifications, and in them were human bones, axes,  tomahawks, points of arrows, beads and pipes, which were frequently  found; and it was a common occurrence in the country to plow up axes,  which I have done many times myself.    \"I have visited the fortifications on the tops of those hills  frequently, and the one near Bloomfield I have crossed hundreds of  times, which is on the bluff of Honeyoye River, at the outlet of  Honeyoye Lake.    \"In that region there are many small deep lakes, and in some of them  the bottom has never been found. Fish abound in them.    \"The hill Cumorah is a high hill for that country, and had the  appearance of a fortification or entrenchment around it. In the State  of New York, probably there are hundreds of these fortifications which  are now visible, and I have seen them in many other parts of the  United States.\"    Readers of the Book of Mormon will remember that in this very region,  according to that sacred record, the final battles were fought between  the Nephites and Lamanites. At the hill Cumorah, the Nephites made  their last stand prior to their utter extermination, A. D., 385.    Thus was Heber preaching the Gospel to the Gentiles, above the graves  of the ancients of Israel, whose records with the fullness of that  Gospel, and the relics of their prowess and civilization, were now  \"whispering from the dust.\"    But another scene was about to shift in his life's drama. He had  planned to visit Kirtland, the bosom of the Church, and home of Joseph  the Prophet.          CHAPTER V.    THE LAND OF SHINEHAH--ARRIVAL OF HEBER AND BRIGHAM IN KIRTLAND--THEIR  FIRST MEETING WITH THE PROPHET--THE KIMBALLS AND YOUNGS REMOVE TO  OHIO--VEXATIOUS SUITS AND MOB VIOLENCE--FALLEN ON PERILOUS TIMES.      Kirtland, at the time arrived at in our narrative, was the  head-quarters of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The  home of the Prophet of God and many of the leading Elders of Israel,  it was also the spot designated by revelation where the first temple  was to be built in this dispensation.    The Church, organized at Fayette, Seneca County, New York, on the 6th  of April, 1830, had entered on the third year of its existence, and  the Saints throughout the eastern parts had been commanded to gather  westward. Kirtland and its vicinity, or \"the land of Shinehah,\" as it  is named in revelation, had been settled as a stake of Zion since  early in 1831, and from there, in the summer of the same year, had  gone forth a colony of Saints to purchase and occupy \"the land of  Zion,\" in the western confines of Missouri. That region was then the  nation's frontier, bordering on a wilderness inhabited by wild beasts  and savages, and but sparsely peopled itself by whites scarcely less  ignorant and cruel.    The Gospel, preached by the first missionaries sent westward from New  York, in October, 1830, had taken a firm hold among the  honest-in-heart of Northern Ohio. Among those who had embraced the new  faith--new, indeed, and wonderful to that generation--were Sidney  Rigdon, Edward Partridge and Newel K. Whitney. The Pratts, the  Whitmers, and other noted families were already numbered among the  followers of the \"Mormon\" Prophet, and it was Parley P. Pratt, Oliver  Cowdery and other Elders who had first brought the Gospel to Kirtland.    The new branch throve so rapidly as to soon eclipse in importance all  others; an event no doubt divinely ordered, as the Saints at large, in  December, 1830, were commanded to \"assemble together at the Ohio.\"    Late in October, or early in November, 1832, Heber C. Kimball, in  company with Brigham and Joseph Young, arrived in Kirtland. They had  traveled by team a distance of three hundred miles. Their first  meeting with the Prophet, whom they had come so far to see, was on the  8th day of November. Joseph was felling trees in the forest when the  party approached. It is related that, on seeing Brigham, he said:  \"There is a man who will yet preside over this Church.\"    As to Heber, the heart of Joseph was at once knit with his, in  friendship like unto that of David and Jonathan; and this feeling of  brotherly love, like a golden chain, uniting these two noble souls,  was destined to endure unbroken through time and eternity.    Says Heber: \"We saw brother Joseph Smith and had a glorious time;  during which Brother Brigham spoke in tongues before Joseph, this  being the first time he had heard anyone speak in tongues. He rose up  and testified that the gift was from God, and then the gift fell upon  him and he spoke in tongues himself. He afterwards declared it was the  pure, or Adamic language that he spoke. Soon after this the gift of  tongues commenced in the Church at Kirtland generally. We had a  precious season and returned with a blessing in our souls.\"    In the fall of 1833, Elder Kimball disposed of his possessions in  Mendon, and settled his affairs preparatory to gathering to the bosom  of the Church. He had borne faithful testimony to the inhabitants of  the place which had been his home for so many years, but, with few  exceptions, they had turned a deaf ear to his warning words. Heber was  the only one of his father's household to embrace the Gospel. His  brother Solomon, though friendly, and at one time, like Agrippa,  \"almost persuaded,\" did not come within the fold.    No sooner was Heber ready to start Zionward, than he was again beset  by petty persecutions. This time they were not only malicious, but of  an out and out dishonest character. Notwithstanding he had settled all  his accounts, and paid every penny that he owed--\"unless it was two  cents to one man, in a case where change could not be procured\"--and  left debts owing to him, uncollected, to the amount of \"some hundred  dollars,\" attachments were issued at the instance of some of his  neighbors, and his goods seized by officers of the law.    Rather than be delayed by a law-suit, in which, owing to religious  prejudice, he had little hope of receiving fair treatment, he settled  the unjust claims and departed.    His family at this time consisted of himself and wife, and their two  children, William Henry and Helen Mar. Judith Marvin, an elder  daughter, and Roswell Heber, a younger son--the first and latest born  of the household--had died. Brigham Young and his two little daughters  went in the same wagon with the Kimball family to Kirtland. They  reached their destination about the last of October, or early in  November. They first occupied a house belonging to Elijah Smith, uncle  to the wife of Bishop N. K. Whitney; but Heber soon had a home of his  own, which he continued to share with his friend and brother Brigham,  until the latter procured a separate domicile.    It is an interesting fact that Brigham was the builder of Heber's  house in Kirtland, he being a carpenter and joiner, as well as a  painter and glazier.    \"When I got to Kirtland,\" says Elder Kimball, \"the brethren were  engaged in building the House of the Lord. The commandment to build  the House and also the pattern of it, were given in a revelation to  Joseph Smith, jun., Sidney "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3534"],[0,"A Complete Account of the Settlement at Port Jackson (#7)"],[1,"consist of 12 persons.      Every political code, either from a defect of its constitution, or from the  corruptness of those who are entrusted to execute it, will be found less  perfect in practice than speculation had promised itself. It were, however,  prejudice to deny, that for some time following the institution of this  patrol, nightly depredations became less frequent and alarming: the petty  villains, at least, were restrained by it. And to keep even a garden  unravaged was now become a subject of the deepest concern.    For in October our weekly allowance of provisions, which had hitherto been  eight pounds of flour, five pounds of salt pork, three pints of pease, six  ounces of butter, was reduced to five pounds five ounces of flour, three  pounds five ounces of pork, and two pints of pease.    In order to lessen the consumption from the public stores, the 'Supply' was  ordered to touch at Lord Howe Island, in her way from Norfolk Island, to  try if turtle could be procured, for the purpose of being publicly served  in lieu of salt provisions. But she brought back only three turtles, which  were distributed in the garrison.    December, 1789. At the request of his excellency, lieutenant Dawes of the  marines, accompanied by lieutenant Johnston and Mr. Lowes, about this  time undertook the attempt to cross the Nepean river, and to penetrate to  Carmarthen mountains. Having discovered a ford in the river, they passed  it, and proceeded in a westerly direction. But they found the country so  rugged, and the difficulty of walking so excessive, that in three days they  were able to penetrate only fifteen miles, and were therefore obliged to  relinquish their object. This party, at the time they turned back, were  farther inland than any other persons ever were before or since, being  fifty-four miles in a direct line from the sea coast when on the summit  of mount Twiss, a hill so named by them, and which bounded their  peregrination.    Intercourse with the natives, for the purpose of knowing whether or not the  country possessed any resources, by which life might be prolonged*, as  well as on other accounts, becoming every day more desirable, the governor  resolved to make prisoners of two more of them.    [*One of the convicts, a negro, had twice eloped, with an intention of  establishing himself in the society of the natives, with a wish to adopt  their customs and to live with them: but he was always repulsed by them;  and compelled to return to us from hunger and wretchedness.]      Boats properly provided, under the command of lieutenant Bradley of the  'Sirius', were accordingly dispatched on this service; and completely  succeeded in trepanning and carrying off, without opposition, two fine  young men, who were safely landed among us at Sydney.    Nanbaree and Abaroo welcomed them on shore; calling them immediately by  their names, Baneelon (Bennelong), and Colbee. But they seemed little  disposed to receive the congratulations, or repose confidence in the  assurances of their friends. The same scenes of awkward wonder and  impatient constraint, which had attended the introduction of Arabanoo,  succeeded. Baneelon we judged to be about twenty-six years old, of good  stature, and stoutly made, with a bold intrepid countenance, which bespoke  defiance and revenge. Colbee was perhaps near thirty, of a less sullen  aspect than his comrade, considerably shorter, and not so robustly framed,  though better fitted for purposes of activity. They had both evidently  had the smallpox; indeed Colbee's face was very thickly imprinted with the  marks of it.    Positive orders were issued by the governor to treat them indulgently, and  guard them strictly; notwithstanding which Colbee contrived to effect his  escape in about a week, with a small iron ring round his leg. Had those  appointed to watch them been a moment later, his companion would have  contrived to accompany him.    But Baneelon, though haughty, knew how to temporize. He quickly threw  off all reserve; and pretended, nay, at particular moments, perhaps felt  satisfaction in his new state. Unlike poor Arabanoo, he became at once fond  of our viands, and would drink the strongest liquors, not simply without  reluctance, but with eager marks of delight and enjoyment. He was the only  native we ever knew who immediately shewed a fondness for spirits: Colbee  would not at first touch them. Nor was the effect of wine or brandy upon  him more perceptible than an equal quantity would have produced upon one of  us, although fermented liquor was new to him.    In his eating, he was alike compliant. When a turtle was shown to Arabanoo,  he would not allow it to be a fish, and could not be induced to eat of it.  Baneelon also denied it to be a fish; but no common councilman in Europe  could do more justice than he did to a very fine one, that the 'Supply' had  brought from Lord Howe Island, and which was served up at the governor's  table on Christmas Day.    His powers of mind were certainly far above mediocrity. He acquired  knowledge, both of our manners and language, faster than his predecessor  had done. He willingly communicated information; sang, danced, and capered,  told us all the customs of his country, and all the details of his family  economy. Love and war seemed his favourite pursuits; in both of which he  had suffered severely. His head was disfigured by several scars; a spear  had passed through his arm, and another through his leg. Half of one of his  thumbs was carried away; and the mark of a wound appeared on the back of  his hand. The cause and attendant circumstances of all these disasters,  except one, he related to us.    \"But the wound on the back of your hand, Baneelon! How did you get that?\"    He laughed, and owned that it was received in carrying off a lady of  another tribe by force. \"I was dragging her away. She cried aloud, and  stuck her teeth in me.\"    \"And what did you do then?\"    \"I knocked her down, and beat her till she was insensible, and covered with  blood. Then...\"    Whenever he recounted his battles, \"poised his lance, and showed how fields  were won\", the most violent exclamations of rage and vengeance against his  competitors in arms, those of the tribe called Cameeragal in particular,  would burst from him. And he never failed at such times to solicit the  governor to accompany him, with a body of soldiers, in order that he might  exterminate this hated name.    Although I call him only Baneelon, he had besides several appellations, and  for a while he chose to be distinguished by that of Wolarawaree. Again, as  a mark of affection and respect to the governor, he conferred on him the  name of Wolarawaree, and sometimes called him 'Beenena' (father), adopting  to himself the name of governor. This interchange we found is a constant  symbol of friendship among them*. In a word, his temper seemed pliant, and  his relish of our society so great, that hardly any one judged he would  attempt to quit us, were the means of escape put within his reach.  Nevertheless it was thought proper to continue a watch over him.    [*It is observable that this custom prevails as a pledge of friendship  and kindness all over Asia, and has also been mentioned by Captain Cook to  exist among the natives in the South Sea Islands.]          CHAPTER VI.        Transactions of the Colony, from the Beginning of the Year 1790 until the  End of May following.      Our impatience of news from Europe strongly marked the commencement of the  year. We had now been two years in the country, and thirty-two months from  England, in which long period no supplies, except what had been procured at  the Cape of Good Hope by the 'Sirius', had reached us. From intelligence of  our friends and connections we had been entirely cut off, no communication  whatever having passed with our native country since the 13th of May 1787,  the day of our departure from Portsmouth. Famine besides was approaching  with gigantic strides, and gloom and dejection overspread every  countenance. Men abandoned themselves to the most desponding reflections,  and adopted the most extravagant conjectures.    Still we were on the tiptoe of expectation. If thunder broke at a distance,  or a fowling-piece of louder than ordinary report resounded in the woods,  \"a gun from a ship\" was echoed on every side, and nothing but hurry  and agitation prevailed. For eighteen months after we had landed in the  country, a party of marines used to go weekly to Botany Bay, to see whether  any vessel, ignorant of our removal to Port Jackson, might be arrived  there. But a better plan was now devised, on the suggestion of captain  Hunter. A party of seamen were fixed on a high bluff, called the  South-head, at the entrance of the harbour, on which a flag was ordered to  be hoisted, whenever a ship might appear, which should serve as a direction  to her, and as a signal of approach to us. Every officer stepped forward  to volunteer a service which promised to be so replete with beneficial  consequences. But the zeal and alacrity of captain Hunter, and our brethren  of the 'Sirius', rendered superfluous all assistance or co-operation.    Here on the summit of the hill, every morning from daylight until the sun  sunk, did we sweep the horizon, in hope of seeing a sail. At every fleeting  speck which arose from the bosom of the sea, the heart bounded, and the  telescope was lifted to the eye. If a ship appeared here, we knew she must  be bound to us; for on the shores of this vast ocean (the largest in the  world) we were the only community which possessed the art of navigation,  and languished for intercourse with civilized society.    To say that we were disappointed and shocked, would very inadequately  describe our sensations. But the misery and horror of such a situation  cannot be imparted, even by those who have suffered under it.    March, 1790. Vigorous measures were become"]]]
