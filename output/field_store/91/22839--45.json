Bearing in mind this middle row of  spines it is impossible to mistake the leaf of the pandan for that of  the pineapple or maguey, which it resembles more or less in form and  shape. Another very prominent feature of pandans is the presence of  air or prop roots which grow from the stem above the ground and are  helpful to the plant in various ways. The veins of the leaves always  run parallel and in a longitudinal direction. The leaves are never  borne on a petiole, but are attached directly, in winding corkscrew  fashion, in ranks of three, to the stem.    Pandans are true tropical shrubs or trees. Although also found in the  subtropics of Australia, they never occur in other temperate regions  except when raised as ornamental plants in greenhouses. Even their  distribution in the tropics is limited, as they are found growing  wild only in the tropical regions of the Old World, especially on  the islands lying between the mainland of Australia and southeastern  Asia. They are hardly ever cultivated, for where they do occur they  are found in more than sufficient quantity for the purposes to which  they are put. They are essentially seacoast or open swamp forms,  generally found at low altitudes and appearing to find a moist, warm  climate most congenial to their growth. In the Philippines they occur  in all provinces, though not always in sufficient quantity to make  them of commercial importance.    The structure of the pandans presents many exceedingly interesting  characteristics well worth noticing. Some plants are very low with  leaves not wider than a blade of grass, while others form large trees  with leaves many meters long and several decimeters wide. Spines  generally occur along the whole margin of the leaf, though in a few  forms, especially in cultivated varieties, they may be present only  at the tip or may be wanting entirely. The marginal spines usually  curve forward and vary in size from small, hardly perceptible forms,  to large sharp conical structures. At times they are set very close  together; again they may be several centimeters apart. Those on  the midrib most often curve backwards and may vary the same as the  marginal spines. Generally the spines are green in color, though in  some species they are pale-green, red, black or white.    Some forms seem to creep along the ground, while others, low and bushy  and standing close together, form, with their numerous supporting  prop roots, an almost impenetrable jungle. The high tree forms are  very striking because of their peculiarly shaped crowns.    The first roots which the pandans develop soon disappear and their  place is taken by others. Starting high above the ground, these grow  at an angle from the stem and generally reach the soil. They serve  the twofold purpose of supporting the stem and of supplying it with  sufficient air. If, by accident, the underground roots die off,  the plant relies entirely on these air and prop roots for support  and food. The strong prop roots are generally of the same diameter  throughout, though sometimes they thicken at the ends. Normally they  never branch above the ground, but after reaching the soil very often  divide. The tip of the roots is protected by a cap, while a layer of  cork tissue prevents the drying out of the root body.    The pandan has two kinds of flowers, male and female. The male flowers  are arranged in the form of a spike protected by a modified leaf  called the bract. They are white in color, crowded together on the  spike and consist of stamens which hold the pollen. The flowers do  not have the showy colored bracts which forms so prominent a feature  in those of many other plants. The female flowers consist only of the  necessary parts. As the pollen occurs in enormous quantities and as  the plants generally grow in groups, it is very probable that some  flowers are pollinated by the wind. The fact that many pandans have  very fragrant blossoms makes it almost certain that in the majority of  cases insect pollination takes place. In a few forms that have a very  disagreeable odor, pollination is effected by night flying insects.    The fruit commonly has the general shape of the female inflorescence,  but as it matures it increases greatly in size. Pandans have a  composite fruit made up of smaller fruits called drupes. The most  common forms resemble the pineapple with its leafy fruit apex cut  off. As is natural, variations from this type occur. Cylindrical,  eggshaped, jackfruit-like forms are quite common. The largest may  be 60 cm. long and weigh 25 kilos, the smallest only 7 cm. in length  and 60 grams in weight. The fruit may occur solitary at the end of a  branch, or in groups. The color is green, though some species change  to a bright red before maturity is reached. The fruit may have drupes  ranging from 12 mm. to 14 mm. in length and these may contain one  seed or a number of seeds. At maturity the drupes separate and the  fruit falls apart. If the plant occurs along the water, the seeds,  when liberated, float about until they rest in a suitable place  for germination.        Uses of Pandans.    Pandans are valued chiefly for their strong fibrous leaves, which are  woven into mats, bags, and hats. Unless specially prepared, the soft  plant tissue between the harder leaf fibers becomes dry and dirty  and breaks in time; hence the ordinary pandan bag or mat can not  be considered a durable article. However, when treated to a boiling  process or when rolled, as explained for sabutan and the pandan of  Majayjay, the leaves yield straw which is stronger and more durable  than most palm or sedge straw used for the same purposes.    Pandan mats are important articles of domestic commerce in Malaysia,  as it is estimated that four-fifths of the total population use them  for sleeping purposes. In all places except where palms, like the  buri or sedges occur, they yield the most suitable and most easily  prepared mat material. Generally the whole leaf is utilized after  removing the marginal and midrib spines. The coarsest mats are used  in drying out copra, cacao beans, paddy, and such products. Pandan  mats are made and used widely in the Philippines.    Formerly, before gunny sacks came into general use, coffee was packed  in pandan bags and where pandans did not grow they were introduced  and cultivated for that purpose. Even to-day bags from pandan play  an important part in transporting sugar, coffee, and other tropical  products in and around southern Asia. Few pandan bags are made in  the Philippines in comparison with the enormous quantity of bayons  woven of buri straw and used to contain domestic rice and export sugar.    Pandans are used extensively for making hats in the Philippines as  well as in other parts of the world. In several islands of the Pacific  very fine ones are woven from straw consisting of the whole leaf cut  into strips. In the Loochoo Islands imitation Panama hats of great  strength are woven from the skin of a pandan, bleached and rolled  into a straw. In the Philippines numerous varieties of pandan hats  are produced, varying in grade from the fine and expensive sabutan  to the coarse pandan. [11]    In some other places, as Burma, pandan leaves are woven or sewed into  sails. In southern India they are utilized as umbrella covering. If  no stronger material is obtainable, the leaves are placed on roofs  as thatching, but they do not seem to lend themselves well to that  purpose. In countries where they grow, they are often used instead  of twine or made into ropes or hunting nets, or into drag ropes for  fishing nets. They are said to be excellent paper-making material. In  some islands the fibers are separated from the leaf and used by the  inhabitants in the manufacture of belts and aprons.    The wood of the tree pandans is too spongy and soft to make a good  material for the construction of houses. Still, on small islands,  such as the Coral and Marshall Islands, the natives construct their  huts from pandan wood. Generally, it is used only for rough, temporary  work. In some localities the soft interior part is removed to make  water pipes. Again, because of its lightness, the wood is used by the  people on the many islands of the Pacific to buoy their fishing nets.    Pandan roots are employed for various purposes. If sufficiently  thin they are used, after being cleaned, for making baskets. The  roots may also be pounded out, cleaned and made into brushes for  painting or whitewashing houses. They are sometimes so employed in  the Philippines. They are also used for cordage. A medicinal oil is  sometimes obtained from them.    The flowers of some pandans, especially those of Pandanus tectorius,  are extremely fragrant. This plant is the most widely distributed of  the pandans and is the most frequent pandan found along the seacoast  and in low altitudes. Some botanists claim that the male flowers of  this species have the sweetest odor known among plants. So powerful  is their fragrance that by it sailors can often tell the presence of  land before they actually see it. The natives in some places use the  flowers in making an aromatic water, or, by distillation, a volatile  oil, known as keura oil, which is used medicinally for rheumatism.    Certain pandan fruit is extremely oily and serves at times as a  substitute for butter. The sap has the taste of sweet apples and is  relished by the inhabitants in many islands. In some places it is  even made into fruit jam.    The very young leaves, especially those surrounding the flowers,  are eaten raw or cooked, and constitute an important article of diet  when a famine sweeps India.        Kinds of Pandans.      The Common Seashore Pandan.    In a walk of half a mile or, at most, a mile along the beach of any  of the seacoast provinces in the Philippines, one is almost sure  to come across Pandanus tectorius.

Such openings, in man, are met       with, either as the results of accidents, of suicidal attempts, or       of operations performed on the larynx or trachea for the relief of       disease.\"         Dr. TOBOLD, Professor in the University of Berlin, in his       \"Laryngoscopie and Kehlkopf Krankheiten\" (Laryngoscopy and Diseases       of the Larynx), p. 131, says, \"Soft palate, lid, pockets, and       pocket-bands are not directly active in the production of either       chest or falsetto tones; they only modify the tone produced in the       glottis.\"         Dr. LUSCHKA, Professor in the University of Tubingen, in his great       work \"Der Kehlkopf des Menschen\" (The Human Larynx), says in the       introduction: \"Only the vocal cords, with the slit they form, have       specifically functional signification, in a narrower sense, of a       voice apparatus, as the parts of the larynx which lie under and       over them have no material and deciding influence on the production       of sound.\"         I will bring my quotations to a close with the following, which       seeks to prove the contrary. Dr. C. B. GARRETT (\"The Human Voice,\"       J. and J. Churchill, London, 1875, p. 17) says, \"It is recorded       that the larynx of a blackbird was removed by severing the windpipe       just below it; that the poor 'thing continued to _sing_, though in       a feebler tone.' This proves that notes can be formed _behind the       instrument_ and before the air reaches it.\" This argument, however,       is of no value, because it so happens that birds have two larynges,       one at the bottom and the other at the top of the windpipe. Dr.       Garrett seems not to have been aware of this fact.    The vocal ligaments in the adult male are, in a state of rest, about  three-quarters of an inch long, and in the female about half an inch. I  pointed out before that the vocal ligaments are attached in front to the  shield (pl. VII, 6) and behind to the pyramids (pl. VII, 3, 3). Let it  now be borne in mind--1st, That the pyramids, in their turn, are  fastened to the upper border of the ring cartilage; and 2nd, That by  drawing the shield downwards and forwards upon the ring, the distance  between the upper border of the ring (pl. VII, 5) and the front of the  shield (pl. VII, 6) is increased, and it will be easily seen that this  movement must of necessity have the effect of stretching the vocal  ligaments.    This drawing of the shield downwards and forwards upon the ring is  brought about by a pair of muscles ascending on either side, in the  shape of a fan, from the ring to the shield cartilage (pl. VIII, 1, 2).  These muscles we name the \"Ring-Shield Muscles.\" In opposition to them  there is another pair inside the shield, running parallel with the vocal  ligaments (pl. IX, 1, 2, 3). They are attached (like the vocal  ligaments) in front to the shield cartilage and behind to the pyramids.  These muscles we will call the \"Shield-Pyramid Muscles.\" They counteract  the ring-shield muscles, and having overcome their resistance, pull the  shield cartilage up again, thereby, of course, relaxing the vocal  ligaments. The ring-shield muscles, therefore, _stretch_ the vocal  ligaments and the shield-pyramid muscles _relax_ them. The  shield-pyramid muscles have an additional function--that of pressing  together the vocal ligaments, under certain circumstances, thereby  narrowing the opening between them. They have therefore been, in these  later days, called the Sphincter[G] muscle of the glottis. They have  also been called the Vocal Muscles, since they play so important a part  in the formation of all vocal tone that a paralysis of them causes total  loss of voice.

WINDPIPE.  ]         It may be observed here that it is impossible to imitate, in the       dead subject, the contraction of the vocal muscles. All       conclusions, therefore, drawn from experiments upon exsected       larynges, with regard to tone-production in living man are       necessarily quite untrustworthy, and cannot for one moment be       admitted as evidence against observations made upon singers with       the laryngoscope.    These two pairs of muscles, then, namely the ring-shield muscles (pl.  VIII, 1, 2) and the shield-pyramid muscles (pl. IX, 1, 2, 3) by  stretching, slackening, and compressing the vocal ligaments, mainly  govern the pitch of the tones produced by their vibrations. The  ring-shield muscles receive some assistance in stretching the vocal  ligaments from another quarter, of which we shall speak later on.    We have now had a look at the vocal ligaments, and we have seen by what  means they are put on the stretch. As, however, in a state of repose  these ligaments diverge behind, they must be brought parallel to each  other before they are ready for the production of sound. Let us,  therefore, in order to explain how this is done, imagine that we have  cut off that part of the pyramids which is standing out above the vocal  ligaments (pl. VII), and let us now have a look at these parts from  above. You see the ligaments (pl. XA, 1, 2), a section of the pyramids  (pl. XA, 3, 4), and uniting these an elastic band (pl. XA, 5). The space  between these parts is commonly called the Glottis, but as this  appellation belongs more properly to the vocal ligaments, it is  manifestly wrong to give the same name to the _space_ which they  inclose. This space should be distinguished as the \"_Chink_ of the  Glottis\" or the \"Vocal Chink.\"         I have been blamed for making this distinction in the face of       almost universal usage. But I can point to the great anatomist       Professor Luschka as having set the example, and while it is true       that in most physiological works \"Glottis\" is used for the _slit_       between the vocal ligaments, yet the appellations \"Rima glottidis\"       and \"Aperture of the glottis\" are also employed for the same thing.       Medical men, moreover, speak of \"Spasm of the glottis,\" and singing       masters of the \"Shock of the glottis,\" which terms are clearly       quite meaningless when applied to a space.    Dr. Garrett says, on page 12 of the book quoted before, that \"The upper  portion of the larynx above the false vocal cords is termed the  glottis.\" He might as well say, \"The upper portion of the face above the  nose is termed the mouth.\" I really should not notice so astounding a  statement were it not made by one signing himself an M.D., and published  by so eminent a firm of Medical publishers as Messrs. J. and A.  Churchill.    [Illustration: PLATE X.    A. GLOTTIS IN REPOSE.    B. GLOTTIS IN RESPIRATION.    C. GLOTTIS IN THE PRODUCTION OF SOUND.    A. 1, 2. VOCAL LIGAMENTS.    3, 4. SECTION OF THE PYRAMIDS.    5. ELASTIC BAND.    6, 7. LEVERS OF THE PYRAMIDS.  ]    On plate XI you see all parts in a state of rest. To the levers of the  pyramids (pl. XI, 1, 2) a pair of muscles is attached, the bases of  which are fixed upon the back of the ring cartilage below (pl. XI, 3, 6,  3). The action of these \"Back Ring-Pyramid Muscles\" (pl. XI, 4, 1 and 5,  2) is to contract as soon as we take breath, thereby drawing together  the pyramids _behind_ and separating them _in front_, at the same time  stretching the elastic band behind (pl. X, A, 5). By this movement the  chink of the glottis is thrown _wide open_ into the shape depicted on  pl. X, B. During expiration these relax, the elastic band contracts, and  the vocal chink resumes the shape as on pl. XI. These movements go on  from the beginning of our lives to the end, whether we are asleep or  awake, with more or less vigour, according as we take a slight or a deep  inspiration. The back ring-pyramid muscles (pl. XI, 4, 1 and 5, 2), have  consequently the all-important function of keeping open the gate through  which the air we breathe enters the lungs. They have, therefore, been  poetically called the \"Guardians of the Portal of Life.\" By their action  of pulling the pyramids backwards, they also assist the ring-shield  muscles (pl. VIII, 1, 2) in stretching the vocal ligaments.           *       *       *       *       *    In opposition to these \"Opening Muscles\" there is another pair rising  from the side borders of the ring (pl. XI, 3, 3) which are fastened to  the front part of the levers of the pyramids (pl. XI, 1, 2), serving to  draw together their front projections to which the vocal ligaments are  attached, and which are thereby brought parallel with each other.    [Illustration: PLATE XI.
