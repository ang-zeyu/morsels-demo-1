One of the first practical questions to emerge was the question by what  authority their ministry was to be exercised. On one point they seem to  have been quite clear. The episcopal ordination, which each of them had  received in England, whatever validity it may have had in English law,  gave them no authority in the church of God in Salem. Further, their  appointment from the Company in London, although it was a regular  commission from the constituted civil government of the colony, could  confer no office in the spiritual house. A day of solemn fasting was  held, by the governor's appointment, for the choice of pastor and  teacher, and after prayer the two recognized candidates for the two  offices, Skelton and Higginson, were called upon to give their views as  to a divine call to the ministry. \"They acknowledged there was a twofold  calling: the one, an inward calling, when the Lord moved the heart of a  man to take that calling upon him, and fitted him with gifts for the  same; the second (the outward calling) was from the people, when a  company of believers are joined together in covenant to walk together in  all the ways of God.\" Thereupon the assembly proceeded to a written  ballot, and its choice fell upon Mr. Skelton and Mr. Higginson. It  remained for the ministers elect to be solemnly inducted into office,  which was done with prayer and the laying on of hands in benediction.    But presently there were searchings of heart over the anterior question  as to the constituency of the church. Were all the population of Salem  to be reckoned as of the church of Salem? and if not, who should  \"discern between the righteous and the wicked\"? The result of study of  this question, in the light of the New Testament, was this--that it was  \"necessary for those who intended to be of the church solemnly to enter  into a covenant engagement one with another, in the presence of God, to  walk together before him according to his Word.\" Thirty persons were  chosen to be the first members of the church, who in a set form of words  made public vows of faithfulness to each other and to Christ. By the  church thus constituted the pastor and teacher, already installed in  office in the parish, were instituted as ministers of the church.[96:1]    Before the solemnities of that notable day were concluded, a belated  vessel that had been eagerly awaited landed on the beach at Salem the  \"messengers of the church at Plymouth.\" They came into the assembly,  Governor Bradford at the head, and in the name of the Pilgrim church  declared their \"approbation and concurrence,\" and greeted the new  church, the first-born in America, with \"the right hand of fellowship.\"  A thoughtful and devoted student declares this day's proceedings to be  \"the beginning of a distinctively American church history.\"[97:1]    The immediate sequel of this transaction is characteristic and  instructive. Two brothers, John and Samuel Browne, members of the  council of the colony, took grave offense at this departure from the  ways of the Church of England, and, joining to themselves others  like-minded, set up separate worship according to the Book of Common  Prayer. Being called to account before the governor for their schismatic  procedure, they took an aggressive tone and declared that the ministers,  \"were Separatists, and would be Anabaptists.\" The two brothers were  illogical. The ministers had not departed from the Nationalist and  anti-Separatist principles enunciated by Higginson from the quarter-deck  of the \"Talbot.\" What they had just done was to lay the foundations of a  national church for the commonwealth that was in building. And the two  brothers, trying to draw off a part of the people into their  schism-shop, were Separatists, although they were doubtless surprised to  discover it. There was not the slightest hesitation on the governor's  part as to the proper course to be pursued. \"Finding those two brothers  to be of high spirits, and their speeches and practices tending to  mutiny and faction, the governor told them that New England was no place  for such as they, and therefore he sent them both back for England at  the return of the ships the same year.\"[98:1] Neither then nor  afterward was there any trace of doubt in the minds of the New England  settlers, in going three thousand miles away into the seclusion of the  wilderness, of their indefeasible moral right to pick their own company.  There was abundant opportunity for mistake and temptation to wrong-doing  in the exercise of this right, but the right itself is so nearly  self-evident as to need no argument.    While the civil and ecclesiastical foundations of the Salem community  are thus being laid, there is preparing on the other side of the sea  that great _coup d'etat_ which is to create, almost in a day, a  practically independent American republic. Until this is accomplished  the colonial organization is according to a common pattern, a settlement  on a distant shore, equipped, sustained, and governed with authority all  but sovereign by a commercial company at the metropolis, within the  reach, and thus under the control, of the supreme power. Suppose, now,  that the shareholders in the commercial company take their charter  conferring all but sovereign authority, and transport themselves and it  across the sea to the heart of the settlement, there to admit other  planters, at their discretion, to the franchise of the Company, what  then? This was the question pondered and decided in those dark days of  English liberty, when the triumph of despotism, civil and spiritual,  over the rights of Englishmen seemed almost achieved. The old officers  of the Company resigned; their places were filled by Winthrop and Dudley  and others, who had undertaken to emigrate; and that memorable season of  1630 not less than seventeen ships, carrying about one thousand  passengers, sailed from English ports for Massachusetts Bay. It was the  beginning of the great Puritan exodus. Attempts were made by the king  and the archbishop to stay the flow of emigration, but with only  transient success. \"At the end of ten years from Winthrop's arrival  about twenty-one thousand Englishmen, or four thousand families,  including the few hundreds who were here before him, had come over in  three hundred vessels, at a cost of two hundred thousand pounds  sterling.\"[99:1] What could not be done by despotism was accomplished by  the triumph of the people over the court. The meeting of the Long  Parliament in 1640 made it safe for Puritans to stay in England; and the  Puritans stayed. The current of migration was not only checked, but  turned backward. It is reckoned that within four generations from that  time more persons went to old England than originally came thence. The  beginnings of this return were of high importance. Among the home-going  companies were men who were destined to render eminent service in the  reconstruction of English society, both in the state and in the army,  and especially in the church. The example of the New England churches,  voluminously set forth in response to written inquiries from England,  had great influence in saving the mother country from suffering the  imposition of a Presbyterian hierarchy that threatened to be as  intolerant and as intolerable as the tyranny of Laud.    For the order of the New England churches crystallized rapidly into a  systematic and definite church polity, far removed from mere Separatism  even in the temperate form in which this had been illustrated by  Robinson and the Pilgrim church. The successive companies of emigrants  as they arrived, ship-load after ship-load, each with its minister or  college of ministers, followed with almost monotonous exactness the  method adopted in the organization of the church in Salem. A small  company of the best Christians entered into mutual covenant as a church  of Christ, and this number, growing by well-considered accessions, added  to itself from time to time other believers on the evidence and  confession of their faith in Christ. The ministers, all or nearly all of  whom had been clergymen in the orders of the Church of England, were of  one mind in declining to consider their episcopal ordination in England  as conferring on them any spiritual authority in a church newly gathered  in America. They found rather in the free choice of the brotherhood the  sign of a divine call to spiritual functions in the church, and were  inducted into office by the primitive form of the laying on of hands.    In many ways, but especially in the systematized relations of the  churches with one another and in their common relations with the civil  government, the settled Nationalism of the great Puritan migration was  illustrated. With the least possible constraint on the individual or on  the church, they were clear in their purpose that their young state  should have its established church.    Through what rude experiences the system and the men were tested has  been abundantly told and retold.[100:1] Roger Williams, learned,  eloquent, sincere, generous, a man after their own heart, was a very  malignant among Separatists, separating himself not only from the  English church, but from all who would not separate from it, and from  all who would not separate from these, and so on, until he could no  longer, for conscience' sake, hold fellowship with his wife in family  prayers. After long patience the colonial government deemed it necessary  to signify to him that if his conscience would not suffer him to keep  quiet, and refrain from stirring up sedition, and embroiling the colony  with the English government, he would have to seek freedom for that  sort of conscience outside of their jurisdiction; and they put him out  accordingly, to the great advantage of both parties and without loss of  mutual respect and love.

CHAPTER XIII    A CONSULAR VISIT TO IRENE CAMP      The story of the petitions, related in the previous chapter, had, as I  have said before, taken place during the time of Hansie's sojourn at  Irene. She knew nothing about it at the time because, naturally, her  mother's letters contained no hint of the agitation with the Consuls  at Pretoria, and she was absorbed in her own \"agitations\" in the Camp,  her stormy interviews with the Commandant, her hopeless struggles  against disease and death.    If ever a Concentration Camp was mismanaged, Irene was, and the six  volunteer nurses, not being paid servants, but having taken up their  work for love and at no small sacrifice to themselves, left no stone  unturned to bring about the necessary improvements.    How futile their poor little efforts were! How powerless they found  themselves against the tide of wilful misunderstanding, deliberate  neglect, unpardonable mismanagement!    The number of deaths in the Camps increased every day, and Hansie,  wiping the hoar-frost from her hair when she woke, half-frozen, in her  tent, wondered how many of her little patients had been mercifully  released by death that night.    For always, when she resumed her work, there were _childish_ forms  stretched out in their last sleep.    One morning, when she found that there had been five deaths during the  night, in her ward alone, she took the train to Pretoria, straight to  General Maxwell's office.    \"Come and see for yourself, General. The people are starving, and they  lie on the cold ground with little or no covering. Fuel they have  nothing to speak of, medical comforts are always out of stock----\"    With a heavy frown he asked:    \"Why are these things not reported to me?\"    \"I don't know,\" she answered miserably. \"We thought you knew. We can  do nothing with the Commandant----\"    A great deal more was said on both sides, revelations, not to be  repeated here, made by the unhappy girl, and the Governor's  sympathetic face grew stern with righteous indignation as she  proceeded.    \"I will investigate the matter for myself,\" he said. \"But you look  ill--why don't you come home and take a good rest?\"    \"I am only sick with misery, General; but if you will speak to the  Commandant and insist on better management in the Camp, we may still  be able to save a great many lives. There is no time to lose. If the  people are not provided with better food and warmer covering during  this intensely cold weather, the mortality will be something appalling  next month.\"    A few days later, one beautifully crisp and clear Sunday morning,  General Maxwell and his A.D.C., Major Hoskins, rode over to Irene to  pay the Camp a surprise visit--and a \"surprise\" it must have been  indeed, of no pleasant nature, to the Commandant, judging by his black  looks afterwards.    The General asked to see Miss van Warmelo and demanded to be shown  through her ward, inspected her worst cases, visited the overcrowded  tents. He seemed much impressed by the scenes he witnessed that day,  and issued orders to the effect that all complaints from her ward were  to be attended to promptly, and that a distribution of blankets and  warm clothing should be made immediately.    There were no blankets \"in stock\" the day before, but they were  produced on this occasion with remarkable alacrity.    The Governor inspected the foodstuffs and the small supply of medical  comforts (which was _always_, I may say here, kept in stock for  inspection, and was not touched for the use of the inmates of the  Camp, when the stores ran out).    On leaving, the Governor said to Hansie with"]]]
