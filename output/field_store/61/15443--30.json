Then:    \"Interesting,\" he said. \"You notice that the two figures are almost the  same--which is rather extraordinary. Very interesting.\"    \"Well?\" asked Tarling impatiently, almost savagely.    \"Interesting,\" said Whiteside again, \"but none of these correspond to the  thumb prints on the bureau.\"    \"Thank God for that!\" said Tarling fervently \"Thank God for that!\"          CHAPTER XIX    LING CHU TELLS THE TRUTH      The firm of Dashwood and Solomon occupied a narrow-fronted building in  the heart of the City of London. Its reputation stood as high as any, and  it numbered amongst its clients the best houses in Britain. Both partners  had been knighted, and it was Sir Felix Solomon who received Tarling in  his private office.    Sir Felix was a tall, good-looking man, well past middle age, rather  brusque of manner but kindly withal, and he looked up over his glasses as  the detective entered.    \"Scotland Yard, eh?\" he said, glancing at Tarling's card. \"Well, I can  give you exactly five minutes, Mr. Tarling. I presume you've come to see  me about the Lyne accounts?\"    Tarling nodded.    \"We have not been able to start on these yet,\" said Sir Felix, \"though we  are hoping to go into them to-morrow. We're terribly rushed just now, and  we've had to get in an extra staff to deal with this new work the  Government has put on us--by-the-way, you know that we are not Lyne's  accountants; they are Messrs. Purbrake & Store, but we have taken on the  work at the request of Mr. Purbrake, who very naturally wishes to have an  independent investigation, as there seems to be some question of  defalcation on the part of one of the employees. This, coupled with the  tragic death of Mr. Lyne, has made it all the more necessary that an  outside firm should be called in to look into the books.\"    \"That I understand,\" said Tarling, \"and of course, the Commissioner quite  appreciates the difficulty of your task. I've come along rather to  procure information for my own purpose as I am doubly interested----\"    Sir Felix looked up sharply.    \"Mr. Tarling?\" he repeated, looking at the card again. \"Why, of course!  I understand that letters of administration are to be applied for on your  behalf?\"    \"I believe that is so,\" said Tarling quietly. \"But my interest in the  property is more or less impersonal at the moment. The manager of the  business is a Mr. Milburgh.\"    Sir Felix nodded.    \"He has been most useful and helpful,\" he said. \"And certainly, if the  vague rumours I have heard have any substantial foundation--namely, that  Milburgh is suspected of robbing the firm--then he is assuredly giving us  every assistance to convict himself.\"    \"You have all the books in your keeping?\"    \"Absolutely,\" replied Sir Felix emphatically. \"The last three books,  unearthed by Mr. Milburgh himself, came to us only this morning. In fact,  those are they,\" he pointed to a brown paper parcel standing on a smaller  table near the window. The parcel was heavily corded and was secured  again by red tape, which was sealed.    Sir Felix leaned over and pressed a bell on the table, and a clerk came  in.    \"Put those books with the others in the strong-room,\" he said, and when  the man had disappeared, staggering under the weight of the heavy volumes  he turned to Tarling.    \"We're keeping all the books and accounts of Lyne's Stores in a special  strong-room,\" he said. \"They are all under seal, and those seals will be  broken in the presence of Mr. Milburgh, as an interested party, and a  representative of the Public Prosecutor.\"    \"When will this be?\" asked Tarling.    \"To-morrow afternoon, or possibly to-morrow morning. We will notify  Scotland Yard as to the exact hour, because I suppose you will wish to be  represented.\"    He rose briskly, thereby ending the interview.    It was another dead end, thought Tarling, as he went out into St. Mary  Axe and boarded a westward-bound omnibus. The case abounded in these  culs-de-sac which seemed to lead nowhere. Cul-de-sac No. 1 had been  supplied by Odette Rider; cul-de-sac No. 2 might very easily lead to the  dead end of Milburgh's innocence.    He felt a sense of relief, however, that the authorities had acted so  promptly in impounding Lyne's books. An examination into these might lead  to the discovery of the murderer, and at any rate would dispel the cloud  of suspicion which still surrounded Odette Rider.    He had gone to Dashwood and Solomon to make himself personally acquainted  with that string in the tangled skein which he was determined to unravel;  and now, with his mind at rest upon that subject, he was returning to  settle matters with Ling Chu, that Chinese assistant of his who was now  as deeply under suspicion as any suspect in the case.    He had spoken no more than the truth when he had told Inspector Whiteside  that he knew the way to deal with Ling Chu. A Chinese criminal--and he  was loath to believe that Ling Chu, that faithful servant, came under  that description--is not to be handled in the Occidental manner; and he,  who had been known throughout Southern China as the \"Hunter of Men\" had a  reputation for extracting truth by methods which no code of laws would  sanction.    He walked into his Bond Street flat, shut the door behind him and locked  it, putting the key in his pocket. He knew Ling Chu would be in, because  he had given him instructions that morning to await his return.    The Chinaman came into the hall to take his coat and hat, and followed  Tarling into the sitting-room.    \"Close the door, Ling Chu,\" said Tarling in Chinese. \"I have something to  say to you.\"    The last words were spoken in English, and the Chinaman looked at him  quickly. Tarling had never addressed him in that language before, and  the Chinaman knew just what this departure portended.    \"Ling Chu,\" said Tarling, sitting at the table, his chin in his hand,  watching the other with steady eyes, \"you did not tell me that you spoke  English.\"    \"The master has never asked me,\" said the Chinaman quietly, and to  Tarling's surprise his English was without accent and his pronunciation  perfect.    \"That is not true,\" said Tarling sternly. \"When you told me that you had  heard of the murder, I said that you did not understand English, and you  did not deny it.\"    \"It is not for me to deny the master,\" said Ling Chu as coolly as ever.  \"I speak very good English. I was trained at the Jesuit School in  Hangkow, but it is not good for a Chinaman to speak English in China, or  for any to know that he understands. Yet the master must have known I  spoke English and read the language, for why should I keep the little  cuttings from the newspapers in the box which the master searched this  morning?\"    Tarling's eyes narrowed.    \"So you knew that, did you?\" he said.    The Chinaman smiled. It was a most unusual circumstance, for Ling Chu had  never smiled within Tarling's recollection.    \"The papers were in certain order--some turned one way and some turned  the other. When I saw them after I came back from Scotland Yard they had  been disturbed. They could not disturb themselves, master, and none but  you would go to my box.\"    There was a pause, awkward enough for Tarling, who felt for the moment a  little foolish that his carelessness had led to Ling Chu discovering the  search which had been made of his private property.    \"I thought I had put them back as I had found them,\" he said, knowing  that nothing could be gained by denying the fact that he had gone through  Ling Chu's trunk. \"Now, you will tell me, Ling Chu, did those printed  words speak the truth?\"    Ling Chu nodded.    \"It is true, master,\" he said. \"The Little Narcissus, or as the  foreigners called her, the Little Daffodil, was my sister. She became a  dancer in a tea-house against my wish, our parents being dead. She was a  very good girl, master, and as pretty as a sprig of almond blossom.  Chinese women are not pretty to the foreigner's eyes, but little Daffodil  was like something cast in porcelain, and she had the virtues of a  thousand years.\"    Tarling nodded.    \"She was a good girl?\" he repeated, this time speaking in Chinese and  using a phrase which had a more delicate shade of meaning.    \"She lived good and she died good,\" said the Chinaman calmly. \"The speech  of the Englishman offended her, and he called her many bad names because  she would not come and sit on his knee; and if he put shame upon her by  embracing her before the eyes of men, she was yet good, and she died very  honourably.\"    Another interval of silence.    \"I see,\" said Tarling quietly. \"And when you said you would come with me  to England, did you expect to meet--the bad Englishman?\"    Ling Chu shook his head.    \"I had put it from my mind,\" he said, \"until I saw him that day in the  big shop. Then the evil spirit which I had thought was all burnt out  inside me, blazed up again.\" He stopped.    \"And you desired his death?\" said Tarling, and a nod was his answer.    \"You shall tell me all, Ling Chu,\" said Tarling.    The man was now pacing the room with restless strides, his emotion  betrayed only by the convulsive clutching and unclutching of his hands.    \"The Little Daffodil was very dear to me,\" he said. \"Soon I think she  would have married and have had children, and her name would have been  blessed after the fashion of our people; for did not the Great Master  say: 'What is more worshipful than the mother of children?' And when she  died, master, my heart was empty, for there was no other love in my life.  And then the Ho Sing murder was committed, and I went into the interior  to search for Lu Fang, and that helped me to forget. I had forgotten till  I saw him again. Then the old sorrow grew large in my soul, and I went  out----\"    \"To kill him,\" said Tarling quietly.    \"To"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20915"],[0,"Field's Chromatography (#20)"],[1,"brown merely by being washed over with a colour which had been  taken out of its saucer with a penknife. In the cake, it must be  carefully kept wrapped up in paper, otherwise the presence of metal  tubes or a knife in the colour-box may spoil it. By a foul atmosphere,  the scarlet is soon utterly destroyed, and even metallized. In contact  with the air, it quickly fades away; and has been found to vanish  completely, when exposed to light alone. Employed in water, a thick  glaze of gum-arabic or gamboge adds to its stability. As a landscape  pigment, the colour is out of the general scale of nature; but in  flower-painting its charms are almost irresistible. Nothing certainly  can approach it as a colour for scarlet geraniums, but its beauty is  almost as fleeting as the flowers.    87. RED CHROME,    Also called _Scarlet Chrome_, is a bright chromate of lead of an  orange-red colour, the red being predominant. Rank in tone, it is liable  to the changes of the yellow chromes, though in a less degree. The  recent introduction of cadmium red renders the use of this unnecessary.    88. RED LEAD,    _Minium_, or _Saturnine Red_, is an ancient pigment, by some old writers  confounded with cinnabar, and termed Sinoper or Synoper. It is an oxide  of uncertain composition, prepared by subjecting massicot to the heat of  a furnace with an expanded surface and free accession of air. Of a  scarlet colour and fine hue, it is warmer than common vermilion, whose  body and opacity it possesses, and with which it was once customary to  mix it. Bright, but not so vivid as the iodide of mercury, it is more  durable, although far less so than vermilion. When pure and alone, light  does not affect its colour, which soon flies, however, on being mixed  with white lead or any preparation of that metal. By impure air, red  lead is blackened and ultimately metallized.    On account of its extreme fugacity when compounded with white lead, this  red cannot be used in tints; but employed, unmixed with other pigments,  in simple varnish or oil not rendered drying by any metallic oxide, it  may stand a long time under favourable circumstances. It is an excellent  dryer in oil, and has often been used as a siccative with other colours,  but it cannot safely be so employed except with the ochres, earths, and  blacks in general. Oils, varnishes, and, in some measure, strong  mucilages, are preventive of chemical action in the compounding of  colours, by intervening and clothing the particles of pigments; and  hence heterogeneous and injudicious tints and mixtures have sometimes  stood well, but are not to be relied upon in practice. Altogether, red  lead is a dangerous pigment in any but skilled hands, and has naturally  had a variable character for permanence. It is frequently adulterated  with earthy substances, such as brickdust, red ochre, and colcotha.      VERMILIONS.    Vermilion is so called from the Italian word _vermiglio_ (little worm,)  given to the kermes or \"coccus ilicis,\" which was used as a scarlet dye  before the introduction of cochineal. It is a sulphuret of mercury,  which previous to levigation is called Cinnabar; and is found native in  quicksilver mines, as well as produced artificially. This is an ancient  pigment, the [Greek: kinnabari] of the Greeks, and the _minium_--a term  now confined to red lead--of older writers. Pliny states that it was so  esteemed by the Romans, as to have its price fixed by express law of  state. Among other places, the natural product is met with in  California, Spain, and Peru; and in China there is a native cinnabar so  pure as only to require grinding to become very perfect vermilion.  Whether the natural possesses any advantages over the artificial,  appears to admit of doubt: Bouvier thought that the former blackened  more than the latter, and others coincide with him. As, however, native  vermilion has become commercially obsolete, the question of their  comparative permanence is of little importance. Theoretically, it is  difficult to assign a reason why there should be any difference between  the two.    Vermilion is capable of being made by both wet and dry processes, but  the last are almost exclusively adopted on a scale, and are, we  believe, preferable. Our opinion, expressed with some diffidence, is,  that pigments whose colour depends on the union of sulphur with a  metal--such as vermilion and cadmium yellow--are more stable when the  sulphur is forced to bite into the base. This can only be effected by a  considerable degree of heat, far greater than can be obtained in any  moist method. We hold that in pigments so produced, the sulphur is less  liable to oxidation by air and light, and that therefore the colour  better withstands exposure to those agents. Before now, vermilions have  been taxed with fading in a strong light: supposing them genuine, it  would be interesting to know by what mode they were manufactured.    There are two kinds of vermilion in common use, European and Chinese, of  which the first inclines to orange and the second to purple. These  include the several varieties known as--_Vermilion_, _Deep Vermilion_,  _Pale Vermilion_, _Scarlet Vermilion_, _Chinese Vermilion_, _Carmine  Vermilion_, _Extract of Vermilion_, _Orange Vermilion_, and _Field's  Orange Vermilion_.    89. VERMILION,    Deep or pale, when well made and pure is of strict permanence, not  sensibly affected by light, time, or foul air; and eligible either in  water, oil, or fresco. For an enamel colour it is unsuited, being  dissipated at a red heat, a test that detects the presence of any  non-volatile adulterant. The best vermilion is a powerful vivid colour,  higher in tone than all reds, except the scarlet iodide of mercury. With  this it should not be compounded, but with other pigments it may safely  be used in admixture, as far as its own colour is concerned. Of great  body, weight, and opacity, it is a somewhat slow drier; and does not  retain that brilliancy when dry, which is peculiar to it while wet. A  want of transparency, and not drying well, prevent its being so  generally employed as would be desirable. Pictures should seem to be  painted with colour, not with pigment, the material being lost amid the  hues, tints, and shades; but with such compounds as vermilion, the art  of concealing art becomes difficult indeed. The pigment is apt to  predominate over the colour, and the painting to look mechanical rather  than natural: particles are apparent where hues alone should be seen,  and all sense of reality is destroyed. For these reasons, vermilion is a  dangerous pigment in unskilled hands, needing an intimate acquaintance  with its physical properties. The extreme weight or specific gravity of  the red renders it liable to sink and separate when compounded with  other colours; hence the heavier those mixed with it the better. Its  almost equal opacity, too, and habit of washing up, militate against its  use by young painters. With experience, however, and due care, this is  a serviceable colour; yielding with white most delicate flesh tints, and  in minute proportion with cobalt or French blue and white, tender aërial  grays.    Being cheaper than formerly, vermilion is not so much adulterated as it  once was; although, even now, brickdust, orpiment, &c. sometimes  sophisticate it. The knavish practices to which the pigment has been  subjected, have acquired it an ill-fame both with authors and artists.  Vermilion has been charged with fading in the light, and with being  blackened by impure air; but it was the custom to crimson the colour by  means of lake, or tone it to a scarlet hue by red lead. With pigments as  with persons, evil communications corrupt good manners--a motto that  might be written with advantage on every palette.    90. SCARLET VERMILION    Resembles the preceding in all respects, except in being more scarlet in  its tint, and washing better; advantages which render it more useful  when the tone is required to be very bright and pure. At one time, the  Dutch alone in Europe possessed the secret of giving to vermilion a rich  scarlet colour.    91. CHINESE VERMILION,    Or _Carmine Vermilion_, partakes of a crimson hue, and is adapted,  mixed with white, for the rose and lilac-tints of some complexions. Like  other vermilions, however, the colour needs much nicety of management;  and it must not be attempted to further enrich it by admixture of  cochineal lakes. Those colours, as we have remarked, cannot safely be  brought into contact with vermilion, either compounded or as a glaze.  The reds of madder should be substituted for them.    92. EXTRACT OF VERMILION,    A somewhat curious name for a metallic colour, was a peculiar  preparation of the author, possessing in its time certain advantages  over other vermilions, and especially distinguished by a more scarlet  hue. Now, however, extract of vermilion and scarlet vermilion are  synonymous terms.    93. ORANGE VERMILION    Is rather more transparent than ordinary vermilion, with a clear but not  bright orange hue. It also washes better, and is for landscape purposes  more generally useful. Resembling red-lead in appearance, it is not  subject to its changes, being perfectly durable in oil and water. A most  powerful tinger of white, its tints are warmer than red-lead's,  affording delicate carnations similar to those of Titian and Rubens.  This pigment--or, preferably, the succeeding variety--may be employed  with excellent results in scumbling of flesh, for which Sir Joshua  Reynolds improperly used the so-called red orpiment. It dries in simple  linseed oil, but works with best effect in water with a considerable  portion of gum. In speaking of sunset and sunrise clouds, Mr. Penley  observes--\"Orange vermilion if used so thin as to get rid of its  opacity, is a fine tone; but it must be remembered that _transparency_  is the character of the sunset or sunrise, and hence arises"]]]
