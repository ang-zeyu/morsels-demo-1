It could not be said that James was studying,  for he was watching the vessels passing far out at sea, and inwardly  moaning over the fact that he was destined for a profession for which  he had no real liking, instead of being free to choose one of travel  and adventure.    Presently, he heard voices behind him. The position, in which he was  lying, was a little distance down on the slopes, on the seaward side of  the path, and, as a screen of bushes grew behind it, he could not be  seen by anyone passing along.    \"All the men, with their pistols and cutlasses, are to assemble here at  ten o'clock tonight, Johnson. But do not give them orders till late,  and let them come up, one by one, so as not to attract attention.  Lipscombe's men are to assemble at the same hour, and march to meet us.  This time, I think, there is no mistake. The cargo is to be landed  where I told you. It will be high tide at twelve o'clock, and they are  sure to choose that hour, so that the cutter can run close in. I have  sent off a man on horseback to Weymouth, for the revenue cutter to come  round. If she's in time, we shall catch that troublesome lugger, as  well as her cargo. She has been a thorn in our side for the last year.  This time, I do hope we shall have her.\"    The speakers then moved on out of hearing, but James Walsham recognized  the voice, as that of the revenue officer commanding the force at  Sidmouth.    Smuggling was, at that time, carried on on a large scale along the  coast, and there were frequent collisions between those engaged in it  and the revenue officers. The sympathies of the population were wholly  with the smugglers, and the cheating of the revenue was not at all  considered in the light of a crime.    Many of the fishermen, from time to time, took a hand in smuggling  cruises, and the country people were always ready to lend assistance in  landing and carrying the cargoes.    When out in their boats at night, James had often heard the fishermen  tell stories of their smuggling adventures, and more than once he had  been with them, when they had boarded a lugger laden with contraband,  to warn them that the revenue cutter was on the cruising ground, and it  would not be safe to attempt to run cargo at present. He now  determined, at once, that he would warn the smugglers of their danger.  The question was, where was the cargo to be run? The officer had not  mentioned the spot, but, as the force from the next station to the east  was to cooperate, it must be somewhere between the two.    Waiting till the speakers must have gone well along the cliff, he rose  to his feet, and returned to Sidmouth. He thought, at first, of telling  some of the fishermen what he had heard, but as, in the event of an  affray, it might come out how the smugglers had been warned of the  intention of the revenue officers, he thought there would be less risk  in giving them warning himself. He knew every path down the cliff for  miles, and trusted that he should be able to make his way down, and  give the boats notice of their danger, before the revenue men reached  the shore.    At nine o'clock he dressed himself, in the rough sailor's suit he wore  when he went out with the fishermen, and started along the cliff. For  some distance he kept well inland, as the officer might have placed a  man on the lookout, to stop anyone going towards the scene of action.  The spot he thought the most likely was a mile and a half along the  shore. There was a good landing place, and an easy path up the cliff,  and he knew that cargoes had been more than once run here. Accordingly,  when he reached this spot, he sat down among some bushes on the edge of  the cliff, and waited for some sort of signal. Half an hour later, he  heard the tramp of a number of men, passing along behind him.    \"There go the revenue men,\" he thought to himself. \"I suppose they are  going to meet those coming the other way.\"    An hour passed without further sound, and James began to get uneasy. If  this was the spot fixed for the landing, some of the country people  ought to be arriving, by this time, to help to carry off the cargo.  They might, for aught he knew, be already near, waiting for the signal  before they descended the path. No doubt the revenue men would be lying  in wait, a short distance off, and would allow the friends of the  smugglers to go down to the water, without letting them know of their  presence.    He kept his eyes fixed on the water to the east, watching anxiously for  the appearance of a light. Presently he started. Immediately in front  of him, about a mile at sea, a bright light was shown. In a second, it  disappeared. Three times it flashed out, and then all was dark. The  night was a very dark one. There was no moon, and the stars were  obscured, and although he strained his eyes to the utmost, he could not  make out the vessel from which the light had been shown.    \"How foolish to show such a bright light!\" he said to himself. \"It  would have been almost sure to attract the attention of anyone on the  watch.\"    He made his way to the path, and descended to the edge of the water,  and waited, expecting momentarily to be joined by people from above.  But no one came. He strained his ears listening for the fall of  approaching oars; but all was silent.    Half an hour passed, and then it flashed across him that the signal  must have been made to deceive the revenue men, and to cause them to  assemble at that spot, and so leave the point really determined upon  free for operations.    With an exclamation of disgust at his own stupidity, in having been  deceived, James ran up the path again at the top of his speed, and then  took the road along the cliff. For two miles, he ran without  interruption, and then saw a dark mass in front of him. He turned off,  instantly, to the left. Doubtless he had been heard approaching, for  two or three men detached themselves from the rest, and started to cut  him off. James ran straight inland, and in the darkness soon lost sight  of his pursuers. Then he turned, and made for the cliff again. Two or  three hundred yards farther along, there was another path to the shore,  and this he had no doubt, now, was the one the smugglers were about to  use. He struck the cliff within a few yards of the spot. In an instant,  two men jumped up and seized him.    \"Who are you?\"    For an instant, James thought that his assailants were revenue men,  but, even in the darkness, he saw that they were countrymen.    \"Quick!\" he said. \"The revenue men are close at hand. They are  watching, two or three hundred yards along. Listen! Here they come.\"    A tramping of feet coming rapidly along the cliff was clearly heard,  and the men, with an oath, released their hold and ran off, giving a  loud whistle, and made for their carts, which were stationed a few  hundred yards inland. James dashed down the path, shouting at the top  of his voice. He had not gone many yards before he met a number of men,  coming up with tubs of spirits on their shoulders.    \"Throw them down,\" he cried, \"and make along the shore. The revenue men  are close behind.\"    His advice was taken at once. The tubs were thrown down, and went  leaping and bounding down to the shore, while the men followed James,  at full speed, down the path.    Their pursuers were close behind. There was no longer any use in  concealment. Their officer shouted to them to press forward at full  speed, while, from the beach below, a hubbub of voices suddenly broke  out, and, at the same moment, a blue light was lit on the cliff above.    \"Beat them back, my lads,\" one of the smugglers was shouting, as James  ran down to the little crowd of men standing near two boats. \"We are  five to one against them. Come on.\"    \"Surrender in the king's name,\" the revenue officer shouted, as he  rushed forward, followed by his men.    The answer was a pistol shot, and, in a moment, a furious melee began.  The advantage in numbers was all on the side of the smugglers. Those  who had landed with the kegs were all armed with pistol and cutlass,  and the countrymen had heavy sticks and bludgeons. The ten revenue men  would have been overpowered, but suddenly a shout was heard, and  another party of sailors ran up along the shore, and joined in the  fray. It was the detachment from the other station, which had been  waiting, at some little distance along the shore, for the signal from  above.    \"To the boats, lads,\" the leader of the smugglers shouted. \"We are  caught in a trap.\"    The smugglers rushed to the boats, and James, who was standing by the  water's edge, leaped on board with them. Most of the country people  fled at once along the shore, pursued by some of the revenue men, while  the others made a rush for the boats. These had been kept afloat a few  yards from the shore. Grapnels had been dropped over their sterns, and,  as the men in charge hauled out the moment the fight began, they were  in water shoulder deep when the smugglers scrambled on board.    The revenue men dashed in after them, and strove to hold the boats; but  they were beaten off with oars and cutlasses, and the boats were soon  hauled out into deep water. The grapnels were lifted, and the men, many  of whom were wounded more or less severely in the fray, got out their  oars and pulled to the lugger, amid a dropping fire of pistol shots  from shore.        Chapter 7: Pressed.      Many and deep were the maledictions uttered, as the smugglers climbed  on board their vessel; but their captain said cheerily:    \"Never mind, lads, it might have been worse. It was only the first  cargo of tubs, and half of those weren't ashore. The lace and silk are  all right, so no great harm is done. Set to work, and get up sail as  soon as you can. Likely enough there is a cutter in the offing; that  blue light must have been a "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17770"],[0,"Christmas Stories And Legends (#20)"],[1," length came back to Dahvid's white cheeks and strength  and health to his limbs and he went back again to the plain. Old  Abraham embraced him, \"Forgive me, my son. I have been a hard master.  Thou hast been very faithful, and for thy reward I make thee lord over  all my flocks and half of them shall be thine own.\"    So Dahvid became a man of flocks, and all his days he was known among  the other shepherds as the one who had held the Christ-child in his  arms.

Stocking; published by the Pilgrim Press.          PAULINA'S CHRISTMAS[*]    A Story of Russian Life. Adapted from Anna Robinson's    _Little Paulina_      One day, in Russia, there was a heavy snowstorm. The snow was deep on  the ground; and in the forest the branches of the trees bent under its  weight.    In this forest a little girl was struggling along. There was no path  for her to follow, for the snow covered all the paths. The little  girl's name was Paulina. She was dressed in a long fur coat, and she  wore a cap and mittens and gaiters of fur, so that she looked more  like a little furry animal than a little girl. She kept tramping  along, not a bit afraid, when suddenly she heard a call for help.    \"Help! Help!\" the call came.    \"Coming, coming!\" she called back. She went in the direction of the  voice and soon she saw a man making his way toward her. His dress was  that of a peasant.    \"Will you please direct me out of this forest, little one?\" he asked.  \"You probably know the paths about.\"    \"No, I am a stranger here,\" Paulina answered. \"I live in Kief--that  is, I did live there; but I am on my way to my father.\"    \"Where is your father?\" asked the man.    \"He is in Siberia. They banished him.\"    \"But, little one,\" said the stranger, \"that is a terrible place for a  child to go to. That frozen country, where wicked people are sent!\"    \"O, yes,--but my father is there, you know,\" said Paulina.    \"Who is your father?\" the man asked.    The little girl was about to tell him, when she noticed a look of  interest on the stranger's face, so she said,    \"Did you say that you had lost your way in the forest? Do you live far  from here?\"    \"Yes, very far. I am lost, and am nearly perishing from hunger and  cold. How far is it to the next village?\"    \"They told me it was some miles on,\" said the child. \"But I will take  you back to the woodsman's cottage where I spent the night. The woman  is a kind-hearted person, and I am sure she will give you shelter.\"    \"That is kind of you, little one,\" said the stranger, \"but you will be  hindering your own journey if you do that.\"    \"I know that my father would want me to show a kindness, even though  it did put me back some,\" Paulina said.    \"You must have a good father, to give you such training. Why did the  Emperor send him into exile?\" the stranger asked her.    \"O, my father had enemies who lied to the Emperor--and there was no  chance given to my father to explain. So the Emperor sent him away to  Siberia,--and I am trying to find my way there to him.\"    While they walked through the forest, the stranger told Paulina about  his own little daughter who was expecting him to spend Christmas with  her. At last they reached the woodsman's hut. The woman greeted them  kindly, and while Paulina went into another room to help her prepare  the evening meal, the stranger was left warming himself by the fire,  and rocking the cradle.    Once Paulina thought she heard voices, as if the stranger were talking  to someone; but when she went back, she found him alone, still warming  his hands and rocking the cradle with his foot.    That night the stranger slept on the floor in front of the fire--there  was no other place for him; but he was glad to be safe from the storm  outside.    Early in the morning, the two started out through the forest again.  They must hurry, if they were to reach the next village before  darkness fell. The storm had passed over, and the day was cold and  clear. A beautiful winter's day. The little girl and the stranger  reached the village on the other side of the forest early in the  afternoon, and there before them they saw a beautiful sleigh drawn by  four horses. There were four servants standing near.    \"What a lovely sleigh!\" exclaimed Paulina.    \"Yes, I wonder where they are going. I will ask them,\" the stranger  said. He went nearer the men and spoke to them.    \"We are driving for our master to Igorhof,\" they said.    \"Why, that is where my daughter is. If I might only ride with you, I  could spend Christmas with her. Tomorrow is Christmas day, you know.  And, little one, you could spend Christmas with us, too.\"    \"O, no,\" said Paulina. \"I could not take the time. I must hurry on to  my father. But it would be lovely if we could only ride in this  beautiful sleigh.\"    \"You could spend the night with us, and then we could set you on your  way, because you have been so kind to me,\" the man told her.    The servants were willing to let them ride in the beautiful sleigh,  and soon they were speeding over the snow toward the great city. Once,  the stranger took a scarf from a pocket on the side of the sleigh and  threw it about his neck. Paulina frowned, and promptly placed it back  in the pocket.    \"It isn't right for you to touch anything in the sleigh. It belongs to  someone else. I am beginning to fear that you may not be an honest  man,\" she said gravely.    The stranger laughed at her, but he did not take the scarf again. They  sped on over the snow until, as darkness fell, they reached the city.  Soon they entered a large courtyard, and the stranger took Paulina's  hand and led her into a narrow passageway, and up a small winding  stairway.    \"Where are you taking me?\" asked Paulina. \"I feel almost sure now,  that you are not an honest man. I think that you may even be a thief!\"    The man laughed again.    \"No, I am an honest man. You will believe me when you see my little  daughter. I trusted you in the forest. Now you trust me.\"    He led her into a large room, and they sat down upon a sofa.    \"We will wait here until my daughter comes,\" he said.    Soon the door opened, and a beautiful little girl, about as large as  Paulina, came toward them. She looked puzzled when she saw the  rough-looking man with the little girl. She went close to the stranger  and looked into his face.    \"It _is_ my father!\" she cried, and threw her arms around his neck.    \"But why are you dressed like a peasant? Has there been an accident?  And who is this little stranger?\"    The man took her on his lap and told her how his sleigh had been  overturned in the storm, and how he had found his way to a peasant's  hut, where they had given him dry clothes to put on, and how he had  started out alone to find his way through the forest; and how he was  nearly perishing with cold and hunger when this little girl had  rescued him, and how, if it had not been for her, he would have died  in the snow in the forest. He told her how little Paulina was on her  way to Siberia to find her father, and how they went to the woodsman's  hut where a servant had found him, and how he had planned for the  sleigh to meet them on the other side of the forest.    \"O,\" Paulina interrupted him, \"then there was somebody talking with  you when we were preparing the evening meal?\"    \"Yes, and everything came out just as I had planned. And do you know,  little daughter, this Paulina would not let me put my own scarf around  my neck. She thought that I was a thief. She is an honest little girl.  But she will not tell me her name. She does not trust me.\"    \"But why should I trust you, when you will not tell me who you are, or  anything about yourself?\" Paulina asked.    \"Do trust my father, Paulina. I'm sure he can help you. He will tell  you who he is soon, I know,\" the beautiful little girl said.    \"Yes, little one,\" the stranger said. \"I know someone who could speak  to the Emperor about your father, and perhaps he could be pardoned.  Please tell me your name; and then before you go away I will answer  any questions about myself you may ask me.\"    \"Do tell my father, Paulina,\" the little girl urged.    Paulina threw her arms about the stranger's knees.    \"O, if you could only get the Emperor to pardon him.--But I do not ask  for a _pardon_--he has done nothing to be pardoned for. All that I ask  is that he may have justice done him. My father is Vladimir Betzkoi.\"    The stranger frowned, and then he whispered,    \"There must be some mistake. He must be a good man to have such an  honest little daughter.\" Then he said to Paulina,    \"Do you believe now that I am an honest man, since you have seen my  daughter?\"    \"O, yes, indeed I do. You couldn't help being good and honest. She is  so beautiful. I think her face is like what a queen's should be,\"  Paulina answered eagerly.    The stranger and his little daughter smiled, and the man said,    \"Well, I believe that your father is an honest man since I have seen  you. And I can tell you now, I _know_ he will be pardoned.\"    \"Tell her, father, tell the little Paulina who you are,\" his daughter  whispered.    \"Until your father returns to you, little one, you must stay here and  I will be a father to you--as I am father to all the people of Russia,  for _I am the Emperor!_\"    Just then the bells began ringing, and voices outside began  singing,--for it was the beginning of Christmas morning. And Paulina  said,    \"This is the happiest Christmas morning I have ever known.\"    [*] By permission--Copyright, 1912, by Sturgis & Walton Company.
