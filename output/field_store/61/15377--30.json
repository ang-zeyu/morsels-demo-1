DESCRIPTION (_apud_ Hodgson).--\"Feet very small, included in the  wing membrane nearly to the end of the toes; ears acutely pointed,  shorter than the head; muzzle groved, nudish; face sharp; rostrum  somewhat recurved; wholly sooty brown; a little smaller than _Vesp.  formosa_.\"    I cannot find this bat mentioned by any other author, and Jerdon  says it does not seem to be recognised.      NO. 93. SCOTOPHILUS TEMMINCKII.  _Syn_.--NYCTICEJUS TEMMINCKII (_Jerdon_).    HABITAT.--India generally; Burmah and Ceylon.    [Figure: _Scotophilus Temminckii_.]    DESCRIPTION.--Ears short, rounded and narrow; tragus narrow, curved  and pointed inwards; muzzle thick, blunt and conical; the fur varies,  sometimes dark olive brown, fulvous beneath, and occasionally  chestnut, with a paler shade of yellow below.    SIZE.--Four and a-half inches, of which the tail is 1-1/2; expanse,  13.    A very common species, appearing early in the evening. Horsfield says  of it that it collects by hundreds in hollow trees, and feeds chiefly  on white ants.      NO. 94. SCOTOPHILUS HEATHII.    HABITAT.--India and Ceylon (Rajanpore, Punjab).    DESCRIPTION.--Similar to the above, but longer in all its  measurements (_Dobson_). Judging from drawings, the head and muzzle  of this are more in a line than in the last species, the ears project  forward, and are also larger, the tragus especially, and there is  a greater width between the ears.    SIZE.--Five inches, of which the tail is 2.      NO. 95. SCOTOPHILUS EMARGINATUS.    HABITAT.--India; precise locality unknown.    DESCRIPTION.--Head broad and flat; muzzle obtuse and thick; ears  long and large, with rounded tips turning outwards; tragus short;  thumb long with a strong claw; wing membrane quite devoid of hair,  except on the interfemoral membrane, which is half covered; fur  tricolored, first dark chestnut, buff, and then yellowish brown.    SIZE.--Head and body, 2-1/10 inches; tail, 2 inches.      NO. 96. SCOTOPHILUS ORNATUS.  _Syn_.--NYCTICEJUS ORNATUS.    HABITAT.--India and Burmah.    DESCRIPTION.--Head broad; muzzle short; ears triangular, erect,  with rounded tips, and broadly rounded lobe at the base; tragus  narrow, semi-lunate, curved towards the front; fur a light  Isabelline brown, spotted with white; a white spot on the centre of  the forehead, and from the back of the head down the spine for  two-thirds of its length a narrow white streak; on each side of the  body two white patches; a broad white collar, or rather demi-collar,  from one ear spot to the other, passing under the throat. Dr. Dobson  says the position of these patches is very constant, but the size  varies, being greatest in individuals of a pale rusty red colour,  and these he found always to be males.    SIZE.--Head and body, 3 inches; tail, 2 inches; expanse, 15.      NO. 97. SCOTOPHILUS PALLIDUS.    HABITAT.--Mian Mir, Lahore.    DESCRIPTION.--Head and muzzle as in _S. Temminckii_; ears slightly  shorter than the head; internal basal lobe convex, evenly rounded;  tip broadly rounded off; tragus moderately long and rounded at the  tip; a prominent triangular lobe at base. Wing membrane from base  of toes; lobule at the heel very narrow and long; last rudimentary  caudal vertebra free; fur of the body, wings, and interfemoral  membrane pale buff throughout.    SIZE.--Head and body, 2 inches; tail, 1.4 inch.      NOCTULINIA NOCTULA.  (See _ante: Vesperugo noctula--Jerdon's No. 41_.)      NYCTICEJUS HEATHII.  _Large Yellow Bat_ (_Jerdon's No. 42_).  (See _ante: Scotophilus Heathii_.)      NYCTICEJUS LUTEUS.  _The Bengal Yellow Bat_ (_Jerdon's No. 43_).      NYCTICEJUS TEMMINCKII.  _The Common Yellow Bat_ (_Jerdon's No. 44_).    Both the above (Nos. 43 and 44) are, according to Dr. Dobson,  synonymous with _Scotophilus Temminckii_, which see.      NYCTICEJUS CASTANEUS.  _The Chestnut Bat_ (_Jerdon's No. 45_).    This is also a variety of _Scotophilus Temminckii_.      NYCTICEJUS ATRATUS.  _The Sombre Bat_ (_Jerdon's No. 46_).  (See _ante: Vesperugo atratus_.)

NO. 98. NYCTICEJUS NIVICOLUS.  _The Alpine Bat_ (_Jerdon's No. 49_).    HABITAT.--Sikim.    DESCRIPTION.--\"Head and body above uniform light brown with a slight  yellowish shade; underneath, from the throat to the vent, dark grey  with a brownish tint, lighter on the sides of the throat. Ears long,  attenuated to an obtuse point.\"--_Jerdon_.    SIZE.--Head and body, 3 inches; tail, 2 inches; expanse, 19 inches.    This bat was described by Hodgson ('Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist.' 1855), but  there is some doubt about it, and it has been classed as a _Lasiurus_  and also with _Scot. ornatus_ and _Vesp. formosa_, but Jerdon thinks  it a _distinct_ species. I cannot find any mention of it in Dobson's  monograph.      _GENUS HARPIOCEPHALUS_.    This is also the genus _Murina_ of Gray. Dr. Dobson explains his  acceptance of the former term in the following way: that he first  accepted _Murina_ on the score of priority in a paper showing that  _Harpiocephalus_ and _Murina_ must be united in a single genus; but  finding afterwards that Gray had founded _Murina_ on a specimen of  what he believed to be _Vesp. suillus_ (Temm.), but which was in  reality a specimen of a very different species from Darjeeling,  belonging to the same section of the genus as _Vespertilio harpia_  (Temm.) the type of his genus _Harpiocephalus_, it remained  therefore either to discard both names or to retain _Harpiocephalus_,  in which course he was supported by Professor Peters, to whom he  mentioned the facts.    Horsfield's genus _Lasiurus_ is included in this one, though Jerdon  considers it distinct from _Murina_.    Muzzle elongated, conical; _nostrils prominent, tubular; produced  beyond the upper lip_, opening laterally or sublaterally, emarginate  between; crown of the head scarcely raised above the face line; ears  thin, generally covered with glandular papillae; tragus long,  attenuated towards the tip, and inclined outwards; thumb very large,  with a large, strongly curved claw; wings around interfemoral  membrane very hairy.--_Dobson_.    Dentition: Inc., 2--2/6; can. 1--1/1--1; premolars, 2--2/2--2;  molars, 3--3/3--3.      NO. 99. HARPIOCEPHALUS HARPIA.  _Lasiurus Pearsonii_ (_Horsfield_) (_Jerdon's No. 50_).    HABITAT.--Darjeeling and Khasia hills.    DESCRIPTION.--\"Fur above very soft, silky, and rather long; colour  on the head, neck, and shoulders brownish grey, with a ferruginous  cast, variegated with whitish hairs; the rest of the body above, with  the base of the membrane, the thighs and the interfemoral membrane,  have a deep bay or reddish-brown hue, and delicate hairs of the same  colour are scattered over the membrane and project from its border;  the body underneath is thickly covered with a grey fur, which is paler  on the breast and body; the interfemoral membrane marked with  regularly parallel transverse lines\" (_Horsfield_). Ears ovoid;  tragus rather long, nearly straight, acute at the tip (_Jerdon_).  Muzzle rather short, obtusely conical; end of nose projecting  considerably beyond the lip, consisting of diverging tubular  nostrils opening laterally, with a slight emargination between each  (_Dobson_).    SIZE.--Head and body, 3 inches; tail, 1-1/2 inch; expanse, 14.  Hodgson, who procured it at Darjeeling, writes of it: \"Entire legs  and caudal membrane clad in fur like the body, which is thick and  woolly. Colour bright rusty above; sooty below, the hairs tipped with  hoary.\"    [Figure: Skull of _Harpiocephalus harpia_.]    This bat is, for its size, one of the most powerfully armed with teeth.  The skull reminds one of that of a dog or hyaena in miniature; the  teeth are very stout, the canines blunt and conical, and the cusps  of the molars short and blunt, well coated with enamel; the jaws are  correspondingly muscular and adapted to the food of the animal, which  consists of hard-shelled beetles, the crushed cases of which have  been found in its stomach.      NO. 100. HARPIOCEPHALUS (MURINA) SUILLUS.  _The Pig-Bat_ (_Jerdon's No. 51_).    HABITAT.--Darjeeling (_Jerdon_); Malayan archipelago.    DESCRIPTION.--Muzzle narrow, elongated; nostrils very prominent,  which, viewed from below, resemble in shape a small hour-glass placed  horizontally at the extremity of the muzzle; ears moderate, shorter  than the head, rounded at the tips; tragus moderately long,  attenuated above and slightly curved outwards; fur light  greyish-brown; extremities dark brown; beneath light greyish-brown  throughout.--_Dobson_.    SIZE.--Head and body, 1-3/4 to 2 inches; tail, 1-1/2 inch; expanse  9 to 10.      NO. 101. HARPIOCEPHALUS AURATUS.    HABITAT.--Thibet.    DESCRIPTION.--Head and muzzle as in _H. suillus_, but the nostrils  are differently shaped; each nostril forms a distinct tube directed  sublaterally with a circular aperture marked by a very small notch  on the outer and upper margin (_Dobson_). The whole body is thickly  clad; the fur on the back is black, with bright golden yellow tips;  the back of the fore-arm covered with short golden hair; the hair  of the under parts black with silvery tips, whiter on the lower jaw,  neck and pubis; the interfemoral membrane is covered with very long  hair, which forms a fringe along its free margin extending on the  legs and feet, and projecting beyond the toes; underneath short  silvery hair.    SIZE.--Head and body 1.4 inch; tail 1.2.      NO. 102. HARPIOCEPHALUS GRISEUS.    HABITAT.--Jeripani, N.W. Himalayas.    DESCRIPTION.--Head and muzzle as in _H. suillus_; fur above dark  brown, with yellowish-brown extremities; beneath similar, but with  the extreme points of the hairs ashy.    SIZE.--Head and body, 1.4 inch; tail 1 inch.

(Incl. is the abbreviation for inclosure.)    (Stamp) Rec'd Western Department, July 30, 1916.        (Note. This correspondence is not complete but it illustrates how to  write a military letter and indorsement.)        USE OF THE COMBINED ARMS      Every efficient officer must realize the possibilities and limitations  of his own arm of the service as well as the possibilities and  limitations of the other arms. Each arm of the service is necessary and  important. A proper understanding of the use of the combined arms is as  essential to success in battle as cooeperation between the different  members of a football team is to its success. Don't \"knock\" any arm but  the one you are in, and don't knock that unless you are willing to admit  you are not man enough to improve it.        INFANTRY      \"The infantry is the principal and most important arm, which is charged  with the main work on the field of battle and it usually decides the  final issue of the combat.\" (Field Service Regulations.) The role (duty  or job) of the infantry, whether offensive or defensive, is the role of  the entire force. If it fails, all fail. When properly supported by  artillery, trained infantrymen armed with rifles, bayonets, and the will  to put the enemy out of action, will settle all issues.        ARTILLERY      The chief duty of the artillery is to support the infantry. It does this  in three ways: 1st, By firing at the hostile infantry. 2d, By putting  out of action the hostile artillery so that it cannot fire at the  infantry. 3d, By demolishing the obstacles in front of the enemy's  works. It smothers the enemy with a curtain of fire, so that the  infantry can move forward without ruinous losses. Cooeperation with the  infantry is essential. If the infantry is defeated the artillery covers  its withdrawal; if the infantry is successful the artillery moves  forward and assists in reaping the full reward of victory by firing on  the fleeing enemy. The present European War has greatly increased the  prestige and importance of this arm of the service. The amount of  artillery on the Western front and the amount of ammunition consumed  daily is appalling.        CAVALRY      This very important arm is the eye with which the general sees for many  miles to the front and flank. In an advance it pushes ahead, combs the  country for the enemy, disperses his cavalry, and thus protects the  infantry in the rear. It locates the enemy, and occupies his attention  until the infantry comes up. It protects the flanks and rear of the  infantry and artillery during the fight. If needed, it joins in the  fight. If the infantry is defeated it covers the withdrawal, and if the  infantry wins it pursues and pounces upon the enemy.        MACHINE GUNS      Before the present European War, machine guns were classified as  emergency weapons. It was not believed that they could remain long in  action, because they would soon be silenced by hostile fire (artillery  and infantry). It was recommended, therefore, that a favorable  opportunity be awaited before opening fire which was to be delivered  with their utmost effectiveness. They were believed to possess very  limited possibilities in an attacking line, hut as being most valuable  in defensive works where protection and concealment could be found.    During this war they have lost, as a defensive weapon, no prestige. They  have also proved of great value to the attacking side. They are being  made light and portable to accompany the firing line in an attack. The  supply of ammunition alone limits the number that can be used.    Each side in the present war has used them by the thousands with  effectiveness. Machine guns are more worthy of consideration to-day than  heretofore.        BOMBS AND HAND GRENADES      The present European War has revived the use of hand grenades and bombs.  A certain number of soldiers in each British and French battalion are  trained as grenade throwers. Their principal weapon is a bucket or bag  of grenades or bombs. They operate not only from trenches but accompany  the firing line in an attack and dispose of sheltered or isolated group  of the enemy by smothering their position with a shower of hand grenades  or bombs.    These weapons are in the first stages of development in this country.  They offer to the service practically a virgin field of opportunities.  Some Reserve Officers might make a specialty of this subject and assist  in its development.        NIGHT OPERATIONS      \"By employing night operations troops make use of the cover of darkness  to minimize losses from hostile fire, to escape observation, to gain  time.\" (Infantry Drill Regulations.) They are dangerous because control  is difficult and confusion is frequently unavoidable. Only trained  troops should be used, and the formation must be simple. Don't attempt  anything complicated.    Observe the following suggestions. For an attack or offensive movement:        (1) Study by daylight and after dark, if possible, the ground you are          to cross.        (2) Make careful preparations with secrecy.        (3) Avoid fire action. Pieces should not be loaded. Rely on the          bayonet.        (4) Give each unit a definite objective and direction. Avoid collision.        (5) Have each man wear a distinctive badge. (For instance, a white band          on one arm.)    If on the defensive and you expect a night attack, place obstacles in  front of your position, heavily patrol your front, fix bayonets, move up  your supports, open fire as soon as results may be expected, and  illuminate the foreground.        OBSTACLES      The main object in placing obstacles in front of a defensive position is  to delay the enemy while he is under the defenders' fire, and thus make  his advance as difficult as possible. To accomplish this result they  must be so placed that the enemy must cross them. They must not  interfere with the defenders' view or fire; they must not be easily  destroyed by artillery fire; they must not afford concealment to the  enemy; and they must be so made that they will not obstruct a counter  attack on the part of the defenders. The present war has demonstrated  that the barb wire entanglement fulfils more of these requirements than  any other form of obstacle.--See Engineer Department's \"Manual on Field  Fortifications\" on how to construct obstacles.        MEETING ENGAGEMENTS      When two hostile forces suddenly meet we have what is termed a \"meeting  engagement.\" Very little or no reconnaissance is possible. There is an  absence of trenches. Both sides deploy rapidly. The smaller the force  the more frequently will it fight a meeting engagement. Therefore, it is  of the utmost importance to junior officers. A great advantage will  accrue to the side which can deploy the faster. The leader who has  intuition, initiative, who can make a quick decision and is willing to  take a long chance, will have a great advantage.        WITHDRAWAL FROM ACTION      \"The withdrawal of a defeated force can generally be effected only at a  heavy cost.\" (Infantry Drill Regulations.) When a withdrawal is  necessary, make every possible effort to place distance and a rear guard  between you and the enemy. Have one part of your line withdraw under  protection of the fire of the other part and so on. Reorganize your  command as soon as possible.        INTRENCHMENTS      \"Ordinarily infantry intrenches itself whenever it is compelled to halt  for a considerable time in the presence of the enemy.\" (Infantry Drill  Regulations.) Trenches are constructed with a view of giving cover which  will diminish losses, but they must not be so built or placed as to  interfere with the free use of the rifle. A good field of fire is the  first consideration. The construction of a trench is simple, but the  location of it is difficult. If possible, trenches are laid out in  company lengths.    Intrenchments usually take the following form:    (1) Hasty Cover. Constructed by troops with the tools they carry on  their person. It is a shallow trench with a parapet at least three feet  thick and one foot high. It furnishes cover against rifle fire, but  scarcely any against shrapnel.    (2) Fire Trench. It should be deep and narrow with the parapet flat  and concealed. While in it, the troops fire at the enemy; hence the name  fire trench.    Usual forms of fire trenches are as shown in the following illustration:    [Illustration]    (3) Support Trenches. The supports sleep and live in these trenches;  hence they are covered. The cover (roof) must be thick enough to afford  protection from high angle artillery fire. It is placed as near the fire  trench as possible.    (4) Approach Trenches. These connect fire trenches with the support  trenches and the support trenches with any trenches in rear where  natural covered communication is impracticable.    [Illustration: CROSS SECTION OF A SUPPORT TRENCH AND DUGOUT]    [Illustration: A SECTION OF A FORWARD ENTRENCHED ZONE    OTHERS ARE IN REAR]    They are zig-zagged to escape being enfiladed. (That is, to prevent one  explosion from doing too much damage in a single trench.) During an  engagement, troops by using these trenches can go safely to the help  of the troops in the"]]]
