Hence we may speak of understanding with regard to all  these things.    Since, however, human knowledge begins with the outside of things  as it were, it is evident that the stronger the light of the  understanding, the further can it penetrate into the heart of things.  Now the natural light of our understanding is of finite power;  wherefore it can reach to a certain fixed point. Consequently man  needs a supernatural light in order to penetrate further still so  as to know what it cannot know by its natural light: and this  supernatural light which is bestowed on man is called the gift of  understanding.    Reply Obj. 1: The natural light instilled within us, manifests only  certain general principles, which are known naturally. But since man  is ordained to supernatural happiness, as stated above (Q. 2, A. 3;  I-II, Q. 3, A. 8), man needs to reach to certain higher truths, for  which he requires the gift of understanding.    Reply Obj. 2: The discourse of reason always begins from an  understanding and ends at an understanding; because we reason by  proceeding from certain understood principles, and the discourse of  reason is perfected when we come to understand what hitherto we  ignored. Hence the act of reasoning proceeds from something  previously understood. Now a gift of grace does not proceed from the  light of nature, but is added thereto as perfecting it. Wherefore  this addition is not called \"reason\" but \"understanding,\" since the  additional light is in comparison with what we know supernaturally,  what the natural light is in regard to those things which we know  from the first.    Reply Obj. 3: \"Will\" denotes simply a movement of the appetite  without indicating any excellence; whereas \"understanding\" denotes a  certain excellence of a knowledge that penetrates into the heart of  things. Hence the supernatural gift is called after the understanding  rather than after the will.  _______________________    SECOND ARTICLE [II-II, Q. 8, Art. 2]    Whether the Gift of Understanding Is Compatible with Faith?    Objection 1: It would seem that the gift of understanding is  incompatible with faith. For Augustine says (QQ. lxxxiii, qu. 15)  that \"the thing which is understood is bounded by the comprehension  of him who understands it.\" But the thing which is believed is not  comprehended, according to the word of the Apostle to the Philippians  3:12: \"Not as though I had already comprehended [Douay: 'attained'],  or were already perfect.\" Therefore it seems that faith and  understanding are incompatible in the same subject.    Obj. 2: Further, whatever is understood is seen by the understanding.  But faith is of things that appear not, as stated above (Q. 1, A.  4; Q. 4, A. 1). Therefore faith is incompatible with understanding  in the same subject.    Obj. 3: Further, understanding is more certain than science. But  science and faith are incompatible in the same subject, as stated  above (Q. 1, AA. 4, 5). Much less, therefore, can understanding  and faith be in the same subject.    _On the contrary,_ Gregory says (Moral. i, 15) that \"understanding  enlightens the mind concerning the things it has heard.\" Now one who  has faith can be enlightened in his mind concerning what he has heard;  thus it is written (Luke 24:27, 32) that Our Lord opened the scriptures  to His disciples, that they might understand them. Therefore  understanding is compatible with faith.    _I answer that,_ We need to make a twofold distinction here: one on  the side of faith, the other on the part of understanding.    On the side of faith the distinction to be made is that certain  things, of themselves, come directly under faith, such as the mystery  to three Persons in one God, and the incarnation of God the Son;  whereas other things come under faith, through being subordinate, in  one way or another, to those just mentioned, for instance, all that  is contained in the Divine Scriptures.    On the part of understanding the distinction to be observed is that  there are two ways in which we may be said to understand. In one way,  we understand a thing perfectly, when we arrive at knowing the  essence of the thing we understand, and the very truth considered in  itself of the proposition understood. In this way, so long as the  state of faith lasts, we cannot understand those things which are the  direct object of faith: although certain other things that are  subordinate to faith can be understood even in this way.    In another way we understand a thing imperfectly, when the essence of  a thing or the truth of a proposition is not known as to its quiddity  or mode of being, and yet we know that whatever be the outward  appearances, they do not contradict the truth, in so far as we  understand that we ought not to depart from matters of faith, for the  sake of things that appear externally. In this way, even during the  state of faith, nothing hinders us from understanding even those  things which are the direct object of faith.    This suffices for the Replies to the Objections: for the first three  argue in reference to perfect understanding, while the last refers to  the understanding of matters subordinate to faith.  _______________________    THIRD ARTICLE [II-II, Q. 8, Art. 3]    Whether the Gift of Understanding Is Merely Speculative or Also  Practical?    Objection 1: It would seem that understanding, considered as a gift of  the Holy Ghost, is not practical, but only speculative. For, according  to Gregory (Moral. i, 32), \"understanding penetrates certain more  exalted things.\" But the practical intellect is occupied, not with  exalted, but with inferior things, viz. singulars, about which actions  are concerned. Therefore understanding, considered as a gift, is not  practical.    Obj. 2: Further, the gift of understanding is something more  excellent than the intellectual virtue of understanding. But the  intellectual virtue of understanding is concerned with none but  necessary things, according to the Philosopher (Ethic. vi, 6). Much  more, therefore, is the gift of understanding concerned with none but  necessary matters. Now the practical intellect is not about necessary  things, but about things which may be otherwise than they are, and  which may result from man's activity. Therefore the gift of  understanding is not practical.    Obj. 3: Further, the gift of understanding enlightens the mind in  matters which surpass natural reason. Now human activities, with  which the practical intellect is concerned, do not surpass natural  reason, which is the directing principle in matters of action, as was  made clear above (I-II, Q. 58, A. 2; I-II, Q. 71, A. 6). Therefore  the gift of understanding is not practical.    _On the contrary,_ It is written (Ps. 110:10): \"A good understanding  to all that do it.\"    _I answer that,_ As stated above (A. 2), the gift of understanding is  not only about those things which come under faith first and  principally, but also about all things subordinate to faith. Now good  actions have a certain relationship to faith: since \"faith worketh  through charity,\" according to the Apostle (Gal. 5:6). Hence the gift  of understanding extends also to certain actions, not as though these  were its principal object, but in so far as the rule of our actions  is the eternal law, to which the higher reason, which is perfected by  the gift of understanding, adheres by contemplating and consulting  it, as Augustine states (De Trin. xii, 7).    Reply Obj. 1: The things with which human actions are concerned are  not surpassingly exalted considered in themselves, but, as referred  to the rule of the eternal law, and to the end of Divine happiness,  they are exalted so that they can be the matter of understanding.    Reply Obj. 2: The excellence of the gift of understanding consists  precisely in its considering eternal or necessary matters, not only  as they are rules of human actions, because a cognitive virtue is  the more excellent, according to the greater extent of its object.    Reply Obj. 3: The rule of human actions is the human reason and the  eternal law, as stated above (I-II, Q. 71, A. 6). Now the eternal law  surpasses human reason: so that the knowledge of human actions, as  ruled by the eternal law, surpasses the natural reason, and requires  the supernatural light of a gift of the Holy Ghost.  _______________________    FOURTH ARTICLE [II-II, Q. 8, Art. 4]    Whether the Gift of Understanding Is in All Who Are in a State of  Grace?    Objection 1: It would seem that the gift of understanding is not in  all who are in a state of grace. For Gregory says (Moral. ii, 49)  that \"the gift of understanding is given as a remedy against dulness  of mind.\" Now many who are in a state of grace suffer from dulness of  mind. Therefore the gift of understanding is not in all who are in a  state of grace.    Obj. 2: Further, of all the things that are connected with knowledge,  faith alone seems to be necessary for salvation, since by faith  Christ dwells in our hearts, according to Eph. 3:17. Now the gift of  understanding is not in everyone that has faith; indeed, those who  have faith ought to pray that they may understand, as Augustine says  (De Trin. xv, 27). Therefore the gift of understanding is not  necessary for salvation: and, consequently, is not in all who are in  a state of grace.    Obj. 3: Further, those things which are common to all who are in a  state of grace, are never withdrawn from them. Now the grace of  understanding and of the other gifts sometimes withdraws itself  profitably, for, at times, \"when the mind is puffed up with  understanding sublime things, it becomes sluggish and dull in base  and vile things,\" as Gregory observes (Moral. ii, 49). Therefore the  gift of understanding is not in all who are in a state of grace.    _On the contrary,_ It is written (Ps. 81:5): \"The"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18757"],[0,"Prince Henry the Navigator, the Hero of Portugal and of Modern Discovery, (#20)"],[1,"ee, of Caste, of the Brahminical \"thread with one hundred and four  beads by which to pray\"; of their etiquette in eating, drinking, birth,  marriage, and death--only the simple fact can be noticed here, that the  first serious and direct Christian account of India, as of China, is  also among the most accurate and well judged, and that both in what he  says and what he leaves unsaid, Messer Marco is a true Herodotus of the  Middle Ages.    But not only does his account discover for Europe the extreme east and  south of Asia; in his last chapter he returns to the Tartars, and after  adding a few words on the nomades of the central plains, gives us our  first \"Latin\" account of Siberia, \"where are found great white bears,  black foxes, and sables; and where are great lakes, frozen except for a  few months in the year, and crossed in sledges by the fur-traders.\"    Beyond this the Obscure Land reaches to the furthest North, \"near which  is Russia, where for the most of winter the sun appears not, and the air  is thick and dark as betimes in the morning with us, where the men are  pale and squat and live like the beasts, and where on the East men come  again to the Ocean Sea and the islands of the Falcons.\"    The work of Marco Polo is the high-water mark of mediaeval land travel;  the extension of Christendom after him was mainly by the paths of the  sea; the Roman missions to the Tartars and to Malabar, vigorously and  stubbornly pressed as they were, ended in unrelieved collapse; only by  the revolt and resurrection of the Russian kingdom did the European  world permanently and markedly expand on the side of Asia. But a crowd  of missionaries followed the first traders to Cathay and to Mangi--Friar  Odoric, John de Monte Corvino, John de Cora; statesmen like Marignolli  the Papal Legate, sight-seers like Mandeville followed these; Bishop  Jordanus of Capua worked for years in Coulam near Cape Comorin (_c._  1325-35); the martyrdom of four friars on April 1, 1322, at Tana, in  India, became one of the great commemorations of the Latin Church; there  seemed no cause why Christian missions which had won north and  north-east Europe should not win central and eastern Asia, whose peoples  seemed as indifferent, as agnostic, as our own Norse or English pagans.    \"The fame of the Latins,\" says Jordanus, about 1330--and he is borne out  by Marino Sanuto--\"is greater in India than among ourselves. Here our  arrival is always looked for, and said to be predicted in their books.  Once gain Egypt and launch a fleet even of two galleys on this sea and  the battle is won.\" As Egypt could not be gained by arms, it was turned  by seamanship. Before Polo returned from China, the coasting of Africa  had begun, and Italian mariners were already in search of the longer way  to the East.    But there is no work of land travel after that of Messer Marco which  really adds anything decisive to European knowledge before the fifteenth  century; the advance of trade intercourse between India and the Italian  Republics, the gradual liberation of Russia the use made of the caravan  routes by some of the most active of the Western clergy, are the chief  notes of the time between the Polos and Prince Henry; and the flimsy  fabrications of Mandeville--\"of all liars that type of the first  magnitude\"--would be fairly left without a word even in a minute history  of discovery, if he had not, like Ktesias with Herodotus, won a hearing  for himself and drawn men's minds away from the truth-telling original  that he travestied, by the sheer force of impudence.    The Indian travels of the Italian Nicolo Conti and the Russian merchant  Athanasius Nikitin belong to a later time, to the age of the Portuguese  voyages; they are not part of the preparation for our central subject,  they are only a somewhat obscure parallel to that subject.    For in the later Middle Ages the chief interest lies elsewhere. The  expansion of Christendom in the fourteenth century, and still more in  the fifteenth (Prince Henry's own), is the story of the ventures and the  successes, not so much of landsmen, as of mariners.          CHAPTER IV.    MARITIME EXPLORATION.    CIRCA 1250-1410.      Italian, Catalan, French, and English sailors were the forerunners of  the Portuguese in the fourteenth century, and the latter years of the  thirteenth. And as in land travel, so in maritime, the republics of  Italy, Amalphi, Pisa, Venice, and Genoa, were the leaders and examples  of Europe. Just as the Italian Dante is the first great name in the new  literatures of the West, so the Italian Dorias and Vivaldi and Malocelli  are the first to take up again the old Greek and Phoenician enterprise  in the ocean. Since Hanno of Carthage and Pharaoh Necho's Tyrians, there  had been nothing in the nature of a serious trial to find a way round  Africa, and even the knowledge of the Western or Fortunate Islands, so  clear to Ptolemy and Strabo, had become dim. The Vikings and their  crusader-followers had done nothing south of Gibraltar Straits.    [Illustration: THE S.W., OR AFRICAN SECTION OF THE HEREFORD MAP. C.  1275-1300. (SEE LIST OF MAPS)]    But while the Crusades were still dragging along a weary and hopeless  warfare under St. Louis of France and Prince Edward of England,  discovery began again in the Atlantic. In 1270 Lancelot Malocello found  the Canaries; in 1281 or 1291 the Genoese galleys of Tedisio Doria and  the Vivaldi, trying to \"go by sea to the ports of India to trade there,\"  reached Gozora or Cape Non in Barbary, the southern Ultima Thule, and  according to a later story \"sailed the Sea of Ghinoia (Guinea) to a city  of AEthiopia,\" where even legend lost sight of them, for in 1312 nothing  more had been heard. From the frequent and emphatic references to this  attempt in the literature of the later Middle Ages, it is clear that the  daring Genoese drew upon themselves the attention of the learned and  mercantile worlds, as much as one would naturally expect. For these men  are the pioneers of Christian explorations in the southern world--the  precursors of all the ocean voyages that led to the discoveries of  Prince Henry, Da Gama, Columbus, and Magellan,--the first who directly  challenged the disheartening theories of geographers, such as Ptolemy,  the inaction and traditionalism of the Arabs, and the elaborate  falsities of story tellers, who, in the absence of real knowledge, had a  grand opening for terrible fairy tales.    The first age, if so it may be called, of South Atlantic and African  voyages was purely Italian; the second was chiefly marked by the efforts  of the Spanish States to equip fleets and send out explorers under  Genoese captains. In 1317 the Genoese Emmanuel Pessanha became Admiral  of Portugal; in 1341 three ships manned by Portuguese and \"other  Spaniards\" with some Italians put out from Lisbon in search of  Malocello's \"Rediscovered\" islands, granted by the Pope to Don Luis of  Spain in a Bull of November 15, 1334, and now described, from the  original letters of Florentine merchants and partners in the venture of  1341, by Boccaccio. \"Land was found on the fifth day after leaving the  Tagus\" (July 1); the fleet stayed till November, and then brought back  four natives and products of the islands. The chief pilot thought these  were near nine hundred miles from Seville, and we may fully suppose that  the archipelago of thirteen, now first explored and described,  represents the Fortunate Islands of Greek geography, the Canaries of  modern maps, and that the five chief islands with their naked but not  quite savage people, with excellent wood houses, and flocks of goats,  palms, and figs, gardens and corn patches, rocky mountains and pine  forests, were our Ferro, Palma, Gomera, Grand Canary, and Teneriffe. The  last they took to be thirty thousand feet high, with its white scarped  sides looking like a fortress, but terrified at signs of enchantment  they did not dare to land, and returned to Spain, leaving the Islands of  the Rediscovered to be visited as a convenient slave depot by merchants  and pirates from the Peninsula till the Norman Conquest of Bethencourt  in 1402.    The voyage of 1341 gained much by attempting little; the Catalan voyage  of 1346, which followed close upon it, was something of a return to the  wilder and larger schemes of the first Genoese. On August 10, 1346,  Jayme Ferrer left Majorca \"to go to the River of Gold,\" but of the said  galley, says the Catalan map of 1375, no news has since been heard. On  the same map, however, the explorers' boat is sketched off the \"Cape  Finisterre of west Africa,\" and there is, after all, some ground for  supposing this to be nothing more than a mercantile venture to the Gold  Coast of Guinea, which was becoming known to the traders of Nismes,  Marseilles, and the Christian Mediterranean by the caravan traffic  across the Sahara. Even Prince Henry began in the same way; Guinea was  his half-way house for India.    About the same date (_c._ 1350) as the Catalan voyage is the Book of the  Spanish Friar, \"of the voyage south to the River of Gold,\" which gives a  more than half fabulous story of travel, first by sea beyond Capes Non  and Bojador, then by land across the heart of Africa to the Mountains of  the Moon, the city of Melli, where dwelt Prester John, and \"the  Euphrates, which comes from the terrestrial Paradise,\" where behind some  real notes of Barbary coasting, perhaps gained from the Catalans of  1346, there is little but a confused transcript of Edrisi's geography.  Yet this was one of the books which helped to fix the notion of a double  Nile, Northern and Western, a Nile of Egypt and a Nile of the Blacks,  with a common source in the Mountains of the Moon, upon the Christian  science of the time, as the Arab geographers had fixed it upon Islam.    The next piece of Atlantic exploration was a romantic accident. In the  reign of Edward III., an Englishman"]]]
