Nevertheless, Thomas continued obstinate; and, at  length declared, that if the dog was not shot immediately, he himself  would be his executioner--This declaration opened the flood-gates of  Tabby's eloquence, which would have shamed the first-rate oratress of  Billingsgate. The footman retorted in the same stile; and the squire  dismissed him from his service, after having prevented me from giving  him a good horse-whipping for his insolence.    The coach being adjusted, another difficulty occurred--Mrs Tabitha  absolutely refused to enter it again, unless another driver could  be found to take the place of the postilion; who, she affirmed, had  overturned the carriage from malice aforethought--After much dispute,  the man resigned his place to a shabby country fellow, who undertook to  go as far as Marlborough, where they could be better provided; and at  that place we arrived about one O'clock, without farther impediment. Mrs  Bramble, however, found new matter of offence; which, indeed, she has a  particular genius for extracting at will from almost every incident in  life. We had scarce entered the room at Marlborough, where we stayed to  dine, when she exhibited a formal complaint against the poor fellow who  had superseded the postilion. She said he was such a beggarly rascal  that he had ne'er a shirt to his back, and had the impudence to shock  her sight by shewing his bare posteriors, for which act of indelicacy  he deserved to be set in the stocks. Mrs Winifred Jenkins confirmed the  assertion, with respect to his nakedness, observing, at the same time,  that he had a skin as fair as alabaster.    'This is a heinous offence, indeed (cried my uncle) let us hear what the  fellow has to say in his own vindication.' He was accordingly summoned,  and made his appearance, which was equally queer and pathetic. He seemed  to be about twenty years of age, of a middling size, with bandy legs,  stooping shoulders, high forehead, sandy locks, pinking eyes, flat nose,  and long chin--but his complexion was of a sickly yellow; his looks  denoted famine, and the rags that he wore could hardly conceal  what decency requires to be covered--My uncle, having surveyed him  attentively, said, with an ironical expression in his countenance, 'An't  you ashamed, fellow, to ride postilion without a shirt to cover your  backside from the view of the ladies in the coach?' 'Yes, I am, an  please your noble honour (answered the man) but necessity has no law,  as the saying is--And more than that, it was an accident. My breeches  cracked behind, after I had got into the saddle' 'You're an impudent  varlet (cried Mrs Tabby) for presuming to ride before persons of fashion  without a shirt'--'I am so, an please your worthy ladyship (said he)  but I am a poor Wiltshire lad--I ha'n't a shirt in the world, that I can  call my own, nor a rag of clothes, and please your ladyship, but what  you see--I have no friend nor relation upon earth to help me out--I  have had the fever and ague these six months, and spent all I had in the  world upon doctors, and to keep soul and body together; and, saving  your ladyship's good presence, I han't broke bread these four and twenty  hours.'    Mrs Bramble, turning from him, said, she had never seen such a filthy  tatterdemalion, and bid him begone; observing, that he would fill the  room full of vermin--Her brother darted a significant glance at her, as  she retired with Liddy into another apartment, and then asked the man if  he was known to any person in Marlborough?--When he answered, that  the landlord of the inn had known him from his infancy; mine host was  immediately called, and being interrogated on the subject, declared that  the young fellow's name was Humphry Clinker. That he had been a love  begotten babe, brought up in the work-house, and put out apprentice by  the parish to a country black-smith, who died before the boy's time was  out: that he had for some time worked under his ostler, as a helper and  extra postilion, till he was taken ill of the ague, which disabled him  from getting his bread: that, having sold or pawned every thing he had  in the world for his cure and subsistence, he became so miserable and  shabby, that he disgraced the stable, and was dismissed; but that  he never heard any thing to the prejudice of his character in other  respects. 'So that the fellow being sick and destitute (said my uncle)  you turned him out to die in the streets.' 'I pay the poor's rate  (replied the other) and I have no right to maintain idle vagrants,  either in sickness or health; besides, such a miserable object would  have brought a discredit upon my house.'    'You perceive (said the 'squire, turning to me) our landlord is a  Christian of bowels--Who shall presume to censure the morals of the age,  when the very publicans exhibit such examples of humanity?--Heark ye,  Clinker, you are a most notorious offender--You stand convicted of  sickness, hunger, wretchedness, and want--But, as it does not belong to  me to punish criminals, I will only take upon me the task of giving you  a word of advice. Get a shirt with all convenient dispatch, that your  nakedness may not henceforward give offence to travelling gentlewomen,  especially maidens in years.'    So saying, he put a guinea into the hand of the poor fellow, who stood  staring at him in silence, with his mouth wide open, till the landlord  pushed him out of the room.    In the afternoon, as our aunt stept into the coach, she observed, with  some marks of satisfaction, that the postilion, who rode next to  her, was not a shabby wretch like the ragamuffin who had them into  Marlborough. Indeed, the difference was very conspicuous: this was a  smart fellow, with a narrow brimmed hat, with gold cording, a cut bob,  a decent blue jacket, leather-breaches, and a clean linen shirt, puffed  above the waist-band. When we arrived at the Castle, on Spin-hill, where  we lay, this new postilion was remarkably assiduous in bringing in the  loose parcels; and, at length, displayed the individual countenance  of Humphry Clinker, who had metamorphosed himself in this manner, by  relieving from pawn part of his own clothes, with the money he had  received from Mr Bramble.    Howsoever pleased the rest of the company were with such a favourable  change in the appearance of this poor creature it soured on the  stomach of Mrs Tabby, who had not yet digested the affront of his naked  skin--She tossed her nose in disdain, saying, she supposed her brother  had taken him into favour, because he had insulted her with his  obscenity: that a fool and his money were soon parted; but that if Matt  intended to take the fellow with him to London, she would not go a foot  further that way--My uncle said nothing with his tongue, though his  looks were sufficiently expressive; and next morning Clinker did not  appear, so that we proceeded without further altercation to Salthill,  where we proposed to dine--There, the first person that came to the  side of the coach, and began to adjust the footboard, was no other than  Humphry Clinker--When I handed out Mrs Bramble, she eyed him with a  furious look, and passed into the house--My uncle was embarrassed, and  asked him peevishly, what had brought him hither? The fellow said, his  honour had been so good to him, that he had not the heart to part with  him; that he would follow him to the world's end, and serve him all the  days of his life, without fee or reward.    Mr Bramble did not know whether to chide or laugh at this  declaration--He foresaw much contradiction on the side of Tabby; and  on the other hand, he could not but be pleased with the gratitude of  Clinker, as well as with the simplicity of his character--'Suppose I  was inclined to take you into my service (said he) what are your  qualifications? what are you good for?' 'An please your honour (answered  this original) I can read and write, and do the business of the stable  indifferent well--I can dress a horse, and shoe him, and bleed and rowel  him; and, as for the practice of sow-gelding, I won't turn my back on  e'er a he in the county of Wilts--Then I can make hog's puddings and  hob-nails, mend kettles and tin sauce-pans.'--Here uncle burst out  a-laughing; and inquired what other accomplishments he was master of--'I  know something of single-stick, and psalmody (proceeded Clinker); I can  play upon the jew's-harp, sing Black-ey'd Susan, Arthur-o'Bradley, and  divers other songs; I can dance a Welsh jig, and Nancy Dawson; wrestle a  fall with any lad of my inches, when I'm in heart; and, under correction  I can find a hare when your honour wants a bit of game.' 'Foregad! thou  are a complete fellow (cried my uncle, still laughing) I have a good  mind to take thee into my family--Prithee, go and try if thou can'st  make peace with my sister--Thou ha'st given her much offence by shewing  her thy naked tail.'    Clinker accordingly followed us into the room, cap in hand, where,  addressing himself to Mrs Tabitha, 'May it please your ladyship's  worship (cried he) to pardon and forgive my offences, and, with God's  assistance, I shall take care that my tail shall never rise up in  judgment against me, to offend your ladyship again. Do, pray, good,  sweet, beautiful lady, take compassion on a poor sinner--God bless your  noble countenance; I am sure you are too handsome and generous to bear  malice--I will serve you on my bended knees, by night and by day, by  land and by water; and all for the love and pleasure of serving such an  excellent lady.'    This compliment and humiliation had"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21614"],[0,"For the Temple: A Tale of the Fall of Jerusalem (#20)"],[1,"eard, above--the work is done. They are about to march away.\"    \"Do not let us expose ourselves further,\" John said. \"It may be  that they have left a few watchers, to see if any who have eluded  their search may show themselves, believing that they have gone. I  have no doubt they are going and, by tomorrow, it will be safe for  us to move.\"    All day they heard the sound of trumpets, for the great host took a  long time getting into motion but, gradually, the sound grew  fainter and fainter, as the rear guard of the army took the road  which they had cut through the mountains, eight weeks before.    That night, when darkness fell, and the two lads sat up on their  ledge and looked round, not a light was to be seen; and not a sound  broke the silence of the night.    \"At daybreak tomorrow, Jonas, as soon as it becomes light enough  for you to see your way, you shall go up and look round. They may  have left a guard behind, but I should hardly think so. After the  wholesale slaughter at Gadara, and here, the hatred of the Romans  will be so intense that, confident as they are in their arms and  discipline, they would hardly venture to leave a small body of men,  in the heart of these mountains.\"    As soon as it was daylight, Jonas prepared to climb up to the  plateau above. He took with him the rope; arranging that, if he  found that the place was absolutely deserted, he would lower one  end to John and fasten the other to the tree above; and that he  would then aid John, as much as his strength would permit, in  making his way up the rock.    John watched his companion making his way up, and observed exactly  where he placed his feet and hands, until he was out of sight. Then  he waited. In about a quarter of an hour, the end of the rope fell  in front of him. He fastened it securely under his arms and then,  taking off his sandals, began the ascent. It was not so difficult  as it had looked; and the steady strain which Jonas kept on the  rope, from above, aided him and gave him confidence. In three or  four minutes, he gained the top of the rock.    \"There is not a soul to be seen,\" Jonas said. \"The town has gone,  and the people, and the Romans. All is desolation!\"    The scene was indeed changed, since John had last looked upon it.  Not a wall, in the so-lately busy little town, had been left  standing. The whole area was covered, three or four feet deep with  a chaos of stones, mortar, and beams; forming a great grave, below  which lay the bodies of forty thousand of the defenders of the  place. The walls so bravely defended had disappeared; and the  embankment, whose erection had cost the Romans so much labor and  bloodshed, had been destroyed by fire. A dead silence hung over the  place, and the air was tainted with a terrible odor of corruption.    The desolation and solitude of the scene overpowered John, and he  sat down on a fragment of masonry and wept, unrestrainedly, for  some time. He roused himself, at last, as Jonas touched him.    \"I shall go down again, and get what grain there is left,\" the boy  said. \"There is no chance of finding anything to eat within a day's  march of here. The Roman horse will have destroyed every village  within a wide circuit.\"    \"But I cannot let you go down again, Jonas. The danger is too  great.\"    \"But I have been up and down, lots of times,\" Jonas said.    \"That may be, Jonas, but you might be dashed to pieces, this time.\"    \"Well, if you like I will fasten the rope round me; then, if I  should slip, I shall be safe.\"    John consented with some reluctance, but he was so nervous and  shaken that he walked some distance away, and did not turn round  until he heard Jonas' footsteps again approaching him.    \"Now we can start,\" the boy said. \"We have got grain here, enough  for three days; and tonight we will crush it, and cook it. I have  had enough of eating raw grain, for a long time to come.\"    The boy's cheerfulness restored the tone of John's nerves  and--making their way with some difficulty over the chaos of stone  and timber, until they arrived at the pile of charred timber, which  marked the spot where the Roman embankment had stood--they stepped  out briskly, descended the hill, crossed the deserted lines of  circumvallation; and then began to ascend the mountains, which had,  for some distance, been stripped of their timber for the purposes  of the siege. In another hour's walking they reached the forest,  and pressed on until the afternoon. Not that there was any need for  speed, now, but John felt a longing to place as wide a gap as  possible between himself and the great charnel ground which, alone,  marked the spot where Jotapata had stood.    At length, Jonas urged the necessity for a halt, for rest and food.  They chose a spot at the foot of a great tree, and then set to work  to collect a store of firewood. John took out the box of tinder  which, in those days, everyone carried about with him, and a fire  was soon lighted. Jonas then looked for two large flat stones, and  set to work to grind some grain.    The halting place had been chosen from the vicinity of a little  spring, which rose a few yards distant. With this the pounded grain  was moistened and, after kneading it up, Jonas rolled it in balls  and placed them in the hot ashes of the fire. In half an hour they  were cooked, and the meal was eaten with something like  cheerfulness.    Another day's walking brought them to a little village, nestled in  the forest. Here they were kindly received, though the people  scarce believed them when they said that they were survivors of the  garrison of Jotapata. The news of the capture of the town, and the  destruction of its defenders, had already spread through the  country; and John now learned, for the first time, the fate which  had befallen Japha and the Samaritans on Mount Gerizim--events  which filled him with consternation.    The folly of the tactics which had been pursued--of cooping all the  fighting men up in the walled cities, to be destroyed one after the  other by the Romans--was more than ever apparent. He had never,  from the first, been very hopeful of the result of the struggle;  but it seemed, now, as if it could end in nothing but the total  destruction of the Jewish race of Palestine.    John stayed for two days in the little mountain village and then,  with a store of provisions sufficient to last him for some days,  pursued his way; following the lines of the Anti-Libanus, until  that range of hills joined the range of Mount Hermon, north of the  sources of the Jordan.    He had stopped for a day at Dan, high up among the hills. Here the  people had no fear of Roman vengeance; for the insurrection had not  extended so far north, and the Roman garrison of Caesarea Philippi  overawed the plains near the upper waters of the Jordan.  Determined, however, to run no unnecessary risks, John and his  companion pursued their way on the lower slopes of the hills until,  after six days' walking, they arrived at Neve.    Here they learned where the farm of John's kinsman was situated,  and made their way thither. As they came up to the house a woman  came out, gazed intently at John and, with a scream of terror, ran  back into the house. It was one of Martha's maids. John stood  irresolute, fearing that his sudden appearance might startle the  other inmates when, suddenly, Mary appeared at the door, looking  pale but resolute. She, too, gazed fixedly at John; and her lips  moved, but no sound came from them.    \"Don't you know me, Mary?\" John said.    The girl gave a scream of joy, and threw herself into his arms. A  moment later Martha, followed by Miriam and the other servants,  came out.    \"It is no spirit, mother, it is John, himself,\" Mary exclaimed and,  the next moment, John was clasped in his mother's arms.    It was not surprising that the first who saw John had thought that  he was a spirit. The news had already been received that the whole  of the garrison of Jotapata had been put to the sword; and John's  appearance was changed so greatly, within the last three months,  that he would scarce have been known. Fatigue, anxiety, and the  loss of blood--from several wounds which he had received, in the  course of the siege--had so pulled him down that he was but a  shadow of his former self. His clothes were in rags. He had washed  them at the village where he had first stopped for, before that,  they had been stiffened with blood; and even now, stained and  ragged as they were, they gave him the appearance of a mendicant.    Jonas had held back a little, while the first joyful greeting was  going on, but John soon turned to him.    \"Mother,\" he said, \"this must be as another son to you for, next to  the protection of God, it is to him I owe my life.\"    Martha welcomed the young stranger affectionately.    \"Before you tell us aught that has befallen you, John, go and  change your garments, and wash, while we prepare a meal for you.  The clothes of your uncle's son Silas, who is about your age, will  fit you; and those of his younger brother will do for your friend.\"    \"Was the last news of my father good?\" John asked.    \"Yes, the Lord be praised, he was well when we heard of him, a week  since!\"    The travelers were at once conducted to a room, and supplied with  water and clean garments. By the time they had changed, and  returned to the general room, John's uncle and cousin had been  fetched in from the farm, and he received another hearty welcome.    It almost seemed to him, as he sat down to a comfortable meal, with  Mary and his mother waiting upon him, that the events of the past  two months had been a hideous dream; and that he had never left his  comfortable home on the shore of the Lake of Galilee. As to Jonas,  unaccustomed to kind treatment, or to luxury of any kind, he was  too confused to utter a word. When the meal was over, John was  asked to tell his news; and he related all the stirring incidents  "]]]
