This was the allowance given to those who were serving as the  king's body-guard for the time being.    So when Apries leading his foreign mercenaries, and Amasis at the head  of the whole body of the Egyptians, in their approach to one another had  come to the city of Momemphis, they engaged in battle: and although the  foreign troops fought well, yet being much inferior in number they were  worsted by reason of this. But Apries is said to have supposed that not  even a god would be able to cause him to cease from his rule, so firmly  did he think that it was established. In that battle then, I say, he was  worsted, and being taken alive was brought away to the city of Sais, to  that which had formerly been his own dwelling but from thenceforth was  the palace of Amasis. There for some time he was kept in the palace, and  Amasis dealt well with him but at last, since the Egyptians blamed  him, saying that he acted not rightly in keeping alive him who was  the greatest foe both to themselves and to him, therefore he delivered  Apries over to the Egyptians; and they strangled him, and after that  buried him in the burial-place of his fathers: this is in the temple of  Athene, close to the sanctuary, on the left hand as you enter. Now the  men of Sais buried all those of this district who had been kings, within  the temple; for the tomb of Amasis also, though it is further from  the sanctuary than that of Apries and his forefathers, yet this too is  within the court of the temple, and it consists of a colonnade of stone  of great size, with pillars carved to imitate date-palms, and otherwise  sumptuously adorned; and within the colonnade are double doors, and  inside the doors a sepulchral chamber. Also at Sais there is the  burial-place of him whom I account it not pious to name in connexion  with such a matter, which is in the temple of Athene behind the house  of the goddess, stretching along the whole wall of it; and in the sacred  enclosure stand great obelisks of stone, and near them is a lake adorned  with an edging of stone and fairly made in a circle, being in size,  as it seemed to me, equal to that which is called the \"Round Pool\" in  Delos. On this lake they perform by night the show of his sufferings,  and this the Egyptians call Mysteries. Of these things I know more fully  in detail how they take place, but I shall leave this unspoken; and of  the mystic rites of Demeter, which the Hellenes call _thesmophoria_, of  these also, although I know, I shall leave unspoken all except so much  as piety permits me to tell. The daughters of Danaos were they who  brought this rite out of Egypt and taught it to the women of the  Pelasgians; then afterwards when all the inhabitants of Peloponnese were  driven out by the Dorians, the rite was lost, and only those who were  left behind of the Peloponnesians and not driven out, that is to say the  Arcadians, preserved it.    Apries having thus been overthrown, Amasis became king, being of the  district of Sais, and the name of the city whence he was is Siuph. Now  at the first the Egyptians despised Amasis and held him in no  great regard, because he had been a man of the people and was of no  distinguished family; but afterwards Amasis won them over to himself by  wisdom and not wilfulness. Among innumerable other things of price which  he had, there was a foot-basin of gold in which both Amasis himself and  all his guests were wont always to wash their feet. This he broke up,  and of it he caused to be made the image of a god, and set it up in the  city, where it was most convenient; and the Egyptians went continually  to visit the image and did great reverence to it. Then Amasis, having  learnt that which was done by the men of the city, called together the  Egyptians and made known to them the matter, saying that the image had  been produced from the foot-basin, into which formerly the Egyptians  used to vomit and make water, and in which they washed their feet,  whereas now they did to it great reverence; and just so, he continued,  had he himself now fared, as the foot-basin; for though formerly he  was a man of the people, yet now he was their king, and he bade them  accordingly honour him and have regard for him. In such manner he won  the Egyptians to himself, so that they consented to be his subjects; and  his ordering of affairs was this:--In the early morning, and until the  time of the filling of the market he did with a good will the business  which was brought before him; but after this he passed the time in  drinking and in jesting at his boon-companions, and was frivolous and  playful. And his friends being troubled at it admonished him in some  such words as these: \"O king, thou dost not rightly govern thyself in  thus letting thyself descend to behaviour so trifling; for thou oughtest  rather to have been sitting throughout the day stately upon a stately  throne and administering thy business; and so the Egyptians would have  been assured that they were ruled by a great man, and thou wouldest  have had a better report: but as it is, thou art acting by no means in a  kingly fashion.\" And he answered them thus: \"They who have bows stretch  them at such time as they wish to use them, and when they have finished  using them they loose them again; for if they were stretched tight  always they would break, so that the men would not be able to use them  when they needed them. So also is the state of man: if he should always  be in earnest and not relax himself for sport at the due time, he would  either go mad or be struck with stupor before he was aware; and knowing  this well, I distribute a portion of the time to each of the two ways of  living.\" Thus he replied to his friends. It is said however that Amasis,  even when he was in a private station, was a lover of drinking and of  jesting, and not at all seriously disposed; and whenever his means of  livelihood failed him through his drinking and luxurious living, he  would go about and steal; and they from whom he stole would charge him  with having their property, and when he denied it would bring him before  the judgment of an Oracle, whenever there was one in their place;  and many times he was convicted by the Oracles and many times he was  absolved: and then when finally he became king he did as follows:--as  many of the gods as had absolved him and pronounced him not to be a  thief, to their temples he paid no regard, nor gave anything for the  further adornment of them, nor even visited them to offer sacrifice,  considering them to be worth nothing and to possess lying Oracles; but  as many as had convicted him of being a thief, to these he paid very  great regard, considering them to be truly gods, and to present Oracles  which did not lie. First in Sais he built and completed for Athene a  temple-gateway which is a great marvel, and he far surpassed herein all  who had done the like before, both in regard to height and greatness,  so large are the stones and of such quality. Then secondly he dedicated  great colossal statues and man-headed sphinxes very large, and for  restoration he caused to be brought from the stone-quarries which  are opposite Memphis, others of very great size from the city of  Elephantine, distant a voyage of not less than twenty days from Sais:  and of them all I marvel most at this, namely a monolith chamber which  he brought from the city of Elephantine; and they were three years  engaged in bringing this, and two thousand men were appointed to convey  it, who all were of the class of boatmen. Of this house the length  outside is one-and-twenty cubits, the breadth is fourteen cubits, and  the height eight. These are the measures of the monolith house outside;  but the length inside is eighteen cubits and five-sixths of a cubit, the  breadth twelve cubits, and the height five cubits. This lies by the side  of the entrance to the temple; for within the temple they did not draw  it, because, as it is said, while the house was being drawn along, the  chief artificer of it groaned aloud, seeing that much time had been  spent and he was wearied by the work; and Amasis took it to heart as a  warning and did not allow them to draw it further onwards. Some say on  the other hand that a man was killed by it, of those who were heaving it  with levers, and that it was not drawn in for that reason. Amasis also  dedicated in all the other temples which were of repute, works which are  worth seeing for their size, and among them also at Memphis the colossal  statue which lies on its back in front of the temple of Hephaistos,  whose length is five-and-seventy feet; and on the same base made of the  same stone are set two colossal statues, each of twenty feet in length,  one on this side and the other on that side of the large statue. There  is also another of stone of the same size in Sais, lying in the same  manner as that at Memphis. Moreover Amasis was he who built and finished  for Isis her temple at Memphis, which is of great size and very worthy  to be seen.    In the reign of Amasis it is said that Egypt became more prosperous than  at any other time before, both in regard to that which comes to the land  from the river and in regard to that which comes from the land to its  inhabitants, and that at this time the inhabited towns in it numbered  in all twenty thousand. It was Amasis too who established the law that  every year each one of the Egyptians should declare to the ruler of his  district, from what source he got his livelihood, and if any man did  not do this or did not make declaration of an honest way of living,  he should be punished with death. Now Solon the Athenian received from  Egypt this law and had it enacted for the Athenians, and they have  continued to observe it, since it is a law with which none can find  fault.    Moreover Amasis became a lover of the Hellenes; and besides other proofs"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21312"],[0,"Glyn Severn's Schooldays (#20)"],[1,"good-bye before he went abroad.  There, don't yawn, either of you.  I am only trying to quote it to you  because to my mind they were very good words, and just suitable for you,  because they were about fighting: `Beware of entrance to a quarrel; but  being in, bear't that the opposer may beware of thee; and--' Humph!  Ah,  dear me, let me see; there was something else about borrowing and  lending.  But never mind that.  It was about the fighting that I wanted  to speak, and the long and short of it was, don't fight, boys, if you  can possibly help it; but if you do fight, show the other fellow that  you know how.  There, that's enough about that.  Now then, what shall we  talk about next?--Yes, waiter, what is it?\"    \"Beg pardon, sir, but there's a person, sir, in the hall wants to know  if he can see the young gentlemen.\"    \"Eh?  Who is it?\" said the Colonel sharply.  \"Not one of the masters?\"    \"No, sir.  It's the proprietor, sir, of the big wild-beast show, sir, in  the field--Mr Ramball, sir.\"    \"Oh, pooh! pooh!\" cried the Colonel.  \"Tell him the young gentlemen are  engaged, and don't care to visit his show to-night.\"    \"Yes, sir.  But beg pardon, sir, I don't think it's about that.  He's in  great trouble about something, sir.  He's well-known here, sir; has a  large farm two or three miles away where he keeps his wild things when  he's not taking them round the country.\"    \"Well, but--\" began the Colonel.    \"Said it was very particular business, sir, and he must see the young  gentlemen.\"    \"Why, it must be something about his elephant, father,\" cried Glyn  eagerly.    \"Well, but, my dear boys, you can't be at the beck and call of this man  because he owns animals that he can't manage.  But there, there, I don't  want you two to withhold help when you can give it.  We'll hear what he  has to say.--We'll come out and speak to him.--I'll come, boys, because  you may want to refer to me.\"    The little party followed the waiter out into the hall, where Ramball  was standing, hat in one hand, yellow handkerchief in the other, dabbing  his bald head and looking very much excited.    \"Hah!\" he cried.  \"There you are, gentlemen!\"  And he put his  handkerchief on the top of his head and made a movement as if to thrust  his hat into his pocket, but recollected himself and put the  handkerchief into the hat instead.  \"I have been up to the school,  gentlemen--Your servant, sir.  I beg pardon for interrupting you; but I  have been up to the school to ask for the young gentlemen there, and I  saw Mr Wrench the Doctor's man, and he said that you had come on here  to dinner.--Pray, pray, gentlemen, come and help me, or I am a ruined  man.\"    \"Why, what's the matter?\" cried Singh and Glyn in a breath.    \"Didn't you hear, gentlemen?  He's got away again--pulled the iron  picket out of the ground, and gone off with the chain and all  chinkupping from his leg.  I have got men out all over scouring the  country, and as soon as they have found out where he is I'd take it  kindly, gentlemen, if you'd come and bring him home.\"    \"Come, come, my man,\" said the Colonel good-humouredly, \"isn't this  rather cool?\"    \"Cool, sir!  It's too hot to be borne.  That great beast will be the  death of me before he's done.  Do say a kind word for me, sir, to the  young gents.  They have got a power over that beast as beats miracles.  I wouldn't ask, sir, but I'm about done.  I should have shot him the  other day if these 'ere young gents hadn't stopped me and showed me, a  man of fifty, as has handled poisonous snakes and gone after lions  before now when they'd got out--showed me, I say, that I didn't  understand my work.\"    \"Oh, well,\" said the Colonel, \"I--I--\"    At that moment the elephant's keeper and another man, a driver of one of  the caravans, hurried excitedly into the hotel hall, dragging between  them a miserable-looking object, drenched with mud and water, and  trembling in every limb.    \"Mr Ramball, sir!\" cried the keeper.    \"What, have you found him?\" cried the proprietor.    \"No, sir; but we've come across this chap, as has got a cock-and-bull  story about something, and I think it means that he's seen him.\"    \"Yes--what?  Where?  How?\" cried Ramball, catching hold of the man by  the shoulders and letting go again directly, to dive into his hat for  his handkerchief.  \"Why, you are all wet and muddy!\" he cried, wiping  his hands.  \"Where did you see him?\"    \"The giant, sir?\" said the poor fellow, shivering.    \"Giant?\" cried Ramball.  \"Well, yes, giant if you like.  Where did you  see him?\"    \"It was about a mile down the road, sir, and we was coming down the Cut  Lane with a load of clover, my mate and me, which we had been to fetch  for the governor's horses in the yard here.  My mate was driving, and I  was sitting on a heap of the clover, stacked up on the hind ladder of  the cart.  We'd stopped a while after loading up, being a bit tired, to  give the horses a drink, and it had got dark, while as we was coming  home, me sitting behind as I telled you, and my mate driving in front,  all of a suddent, and just as I was half-asleep and smoking my pipe, a  great big giant loomed up on t'other side of the hedge, and before I  knew where I was he reaches down, slips his arm round me, and lifts me  right out of the cart.\"    The man wiped his face with his muddy hand and uttered a low groan.    \"Well, go on,\" cried Ramball.  \"What next?\"    \"Don't hurry me, master, please,\" said the man piteously.  \"I'm shook  all to pieces, and feel that freckened that I could sit down and cry.  I  was too much staggered to call out for help, and when I tried to look  round, my mate and the cart was gone, and this 'ere great thing was  carrying me away right across Snow's field, and all I could think of was  that he was hungry and had made me his prey.\"    \"Humph!  An ogre, I suppose,\" said the Colonel to the boys.    \"No, sir,\" said the man; \"it was one of them there great giants as you  read of in books; and no matter how I tried to get away, he only hugged  me the tighter.\"    \"Well, well,\" said the Colonel; \"but you did escape.\"    \"No, sir; I didn't, sir.  He carried me right across the field and  dropped me into the big horse-pond in the corner.  I was half-drowned, I  was; and when I struggled to the side my legs stuck in the mud right up  to my knees.  And then I found that I had come out, half-blind with mud  and water, just where he was standing with his back to me, and then I  daren't move.  But he took no more notice of me, and walked right off,  so that I saved my life.  Next thing was I come upon your two men, Mr  Ramball, sir, and they got asking me questions; but I was too skeart to  understand what they meant, and so they brought me here.--You don't  know, I suppose,\" he continued, speaking to one of the waiters who had  come into the hall, \"whether my mate came home safely with the clover  cart?\"    \"Bah!\" cried Ramball.  \"With your giant indeed!  Which way did he go?\"    \"I dunno, sir; it was too dark.  But it were a giant.  I could swear to  him if I saw him again.  I should know him by his trowges.\"    \"Know him by what?\" cried the Colonel, laughing heartily.    \"By his trowges, sir.  I was down in the mud close behind him, and I  could see right up his great legs to his waist.  I couldn't see any  farther, he was so big.  Awful giant, he was.  You may take my word,  sir, for that.\"    \"Bah!\" roared the proprietor.  \"Here, my lads, he's frightened this poor  lad nearly into fits, and we are wasting time.  Off with you, and follow  his track from the spot where you found the man.  Run him down, and then  don't do anything more to scare him or make him turn nasty; but one of  you stop and watch, and t'other come back here and tell me where he is.\"    The two keepers obeyed promptly, and hurried away, while one of the  waiters sent the scared carter out into the kitchen.    \"That's 'im, sir,\" said Ramball; \"and if the young gents would just give  me a hand to make things easy--\"    \"Yes, yes,\" said the Colonel; \"but from what I know of elephants, that  great brute may go wandering about through the country for half the  night.  You'd better go after your men and track him.  He'll be most  likely in some turnip-field having a gorge, and if you can't get him  quietly back come to me again and I'll see what I can do.\"    \"Beg pardon, sir,\" said Ramball quietly, \"I am ready for anything now,  cunning as I used to think myself.  But does your honour understand  elephants?\"    \"Does he understand elephants, Glyn!\" cried Singh.--\"Why, Mr Ramball,  my friend's father has trapped scores out in the Terai.\"    \"Of course he has, sir,\" said Ramball.--\"Thank you kindly, then, sir.  I'll have my pony put to and go after him at once.\"    Ramball hurried out of the hall, and the Colonel with his young guests  was about to return to the dining-room when they found that Morris and  Professor Barclay were standing close behind them.    \"Quite a succession of adventures, Mr Singh,\" said Morris.    \"Yes,\" said the Professor, \"and most interesting your knowledge of the  habits of those great beasts.\"    \"Yes, exactly,\" said the Colonel drily.  \"They are rather difficult to  deal with.--Come boys,\" and he led the way into the dining-room.  \"There, sit down for a bit,\" he said, resuming his old seat.  \"Are both  those your masters, Glyn, my boy?\"    \"No, father; only one.  The other's a friend of his, I think.\"    \"What, that rather shady-looking individual?\"    \"No, father, the Professor--Professor Barclay.  He dined at the Doctor's  the other night.\"    \"Oh,\" said the Colonel.  \"Well, I don't wish to be too exclusive; but  somehow I never care for strangers who are so very eager to make  friends.\"    \"But oughtn't we to have gone to help find the elephant, father?\" said  Glyn.    \"No, my boy, I think not.  You are my guests to-night, and we don't  often meet.  If they find him, and there is any real necessity,"]]]
