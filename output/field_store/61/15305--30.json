We were about to erect new columns of Hercules.  The grandeur of the enterprise; the agitation of co-operating Europe;  the imposing spectacle of an army of 400,000 foot and 80,000 horse: so  many warlike reports and martial clamours, kindled the minds of veterans  themselves. It was impossible for the coldest to remain unmoved amid the  general impulse; to escape from the universal attraction.    In conclusion;--independent of all these motives for animation, the  composition of the army was good, and every good army is desirous of  war.          BOOK IV.          CHAPTER I.      Napoleon, satisfied with his preparations, at length declared himself.  \"Soldiers,\" said he, \"the second Polish war is commenced. The first was  concluded at Friedland and at Tilsit. At Tilsit, Russia swore eternal  alliance with France, and war with England. She now violates her oaths.  She will give no explanation of her capricious conduct, until the French  eagles have repassed the Rhine; by that means leaving our allies at her  mercy. Russia is hurried away by fatality; her destiny must be  accomplished. Does she then believe us to be degenerated? Are we not  still the soldiers of Austerlitz? She places us between war and  dishonour; the choice cannot be doubtful. Let us advance, then; let us  pass the Niemen, and carry the war into her territory! The second Polish  war will be as glorious for the French arms as the first; but the peace  we shall this time conclude will carry with it its own guarantee; it  will put an end to the fatal influence which Russia for the last fifty  years has exercised over the affairs of Europe.\"    This tone, which was at that time deemed prophetic, befitted an  expedition of an almost fabulous character. It was quite necessary to  invoke Destiny, and give credit to its empire, when the fate of so many  human beings, and so much glory, were about to be consigned to its  mercy.    The Emperor Alexander also harangued his army, but in a very different  manner. The difference between the two nations, the two sovereigns, and  their reciprocal position, were remarked in these proclamations. In  fact, the one which was defensive was unadorned and moderate; the other,  offensive, was replete with audacity and the confidence of victory. The  first sought support in religion, the other in fatality; the one in love  of country, the other in love of glory; but neither of them referred to  the liberation of Poland, which was the real cause of contention.    We marched towards the east, with our left towards the north, and our  right towards the south. On our right, Volhynia invoked us with all her  prayers; in the centre, were Wilna, Minsk, and the whole of Lithuania,  and Samogitia; in front of our left, Courland and Livonia awaited their  fate in silence.    The army of Alexander, composed of 300,000 men, kept those provinces in  awe. From the banks of the Vistula, from Dresden, from Paris itself,  Napoleon had critically surveyed it. He had ascertained that its centre,  commanded by Barclay, extended from Wilna and Kowno to Lida and Grodno,  resting its right on Vilia, and its left on the Niemen.    That river protected the Russian front by the deviation which it makes  from Grodno to Kowno; for it was only in the interval between these two  cities, that the Niemen, running toward the north, intersected the line  of our attack, and served as a frontier to Lithuania. Before reaching  Grodno, and on quitting Kowno, it flows westward.    To the south of Grodno was Bagration, with 65,000 men, in the direction  of Wolkowisk; to the north of Kowno, at Rossiana and Keydani,  Wittgenstein, with 26,000 men, substituted their bayonets for that  natural frontier.    At the same time, another army of 50,000 men, called the reserve, was  assembled at Lutsk, in Volhynia, in order to keep that province in  check, and observe Schwartzenberg; it was confided to Tormasof, till the  treaty about to be signed at Bucharest permitted Tchitchakof, and the  greater part of the army in Moldavia, to unite with it.    Alexander, and, under him, his minister of war, Barclay de Tolly,  directed all these forces. They were divided into three armies, called,  the first western army, under Barclay; the second western army, under  Bagration; and the army of reserve, under Tormasof. Two other corps were  forming; one at Mozyr, in the environs of Bobruisk; and the other at  Riga and Duenabourg. The reserves were at Wilna and Swentziany. In  conclusion, a vast entrenched camp was erected before Drissa, within an  elbow of the Duena.    The French emperor's opinion was, that this position behind the Niemen  was neither offensive nor defensive, and that the Russian army was no  better off for the purpose of effecting a retreat; that this army, being  so much scattered over a line of sixty leagues, might be surprised and  dispersed, as actually happened to it; that, with still more certainty,  the left of Barclay, and the entire army of Bagration, being stationed  at Lida and at Wolkowisk, in front of the marshes of the Berezina, which  they covered, instead of being covered by them, might be thrown back on  them and taken; or, at least, that an abrupt and direct attack on Kowno  and Wilna would cut them off from their line of operation, indicated by  Swentziany and the entrenched camp at Drissa.    In fact, Doctorof and Bagration were already separated from that line;  for, instead of remaining in mass with Alexander, in front of the roads  leading to the Duena, to defend them and profit by them, they were  stationed forty leagues to the right.    For this reason it was that Napoleon separated his forces into five  armies. While Schwartzenberg, advancing from Gallicia with his 30,000  Austrians, (whose numbers he had orders to exaggerate,) would keep  Tormasof in check, and draw the attention of Bagration towards the  south; while the King of Westphalia, with his 80,000 men, would employ  that general in front, towards Grodno, without pressing him too  vehemently at first; and while the Viceroy of Italy, in the direction of  Pilony, would be in readiness to interpose between the same Bagration  and Barclay; in fine, while at the extreme left, Macdonald, debouching  from Tilsit, would invade the north of Lithuania, and fall on the right  of Wittgenstein; Napoleon himself, with his 200,000 men, was to  precipitate himself on Kowno, on Wilna, and on his rival, and destroy  him at the first shock.    Should the Emperor of Russia give way, he would press him hard, and  throw him back upon Drissa, and as far as the commencement of his line  of operations; then, all at once, propelling his detachments to the  right, he would surround Bagration, and the whole of the corps of the  Russian left, which, by this rapid irruption, would be separated from  their right.    I will shortly sketch a brief and rapid summary of the history of our  two wings, being anxious to return to the centre, and to be enabled  uninterruptedly to exhibit the great scenes which were enacted there.  Macdonald commanded the left wing; his invasion, supported by the  Baltic, overcame the right wing of the Russians; it threatened Revel  first, next Riga, and even Petersburgh. He soon reached Riga. The war  became stationary under its walls; although of little importance, it was  conducted by Macdonald with prudence, science, and glory, even in his  retreat, to which he was neither compelled by the winter nor by the  enemy, but solely by Napoleon's orders.    With regard to his right wing, the emperor had counted on the support of  Turkey, which failed him. He had inferred that the Russian army of  Volhynia would follow the general movement of Alexander's retreat; but,  on the contrary, Tormasof advanced upon our rear. The French army was  thus uncovered, and menaced with being turned on those vast plains.  Nature not supplying it in that quarter with any support, as she did on  the left wing, it was necessarily compelled to rely entirely on itself.  Forty thousand Saxons, Austrians, and Poles, remained there in  observation.    Tormasof was beaten; but another army, rendered available by the treaty  of Bucharest, arrived and formed a junction with the remnant of the  first. From that moment, the war upon that point became defensive. It  was carried on feebly, as was to be expected, notwithstanding some  Polish troops and a French general were left with the Austrian army.  That general had been long and strenuously cried up for ability,  although he had met with reverses, and his reputation was not  undeserved.    No decisive advantage was gained on either side. But the position of  this corps, almost entirely Austrian, became more and more important, as  the grand army retreated upon it. It will be seen whether Schwartzenberg  deceived its confidence,--whether he left us to be surrounded on the  Berezina,--and whether it be true, that he seemed on that occasion to  aspire to no other character than that of an armed witness to the great  dispute.          CHAP. II.      Between these two wings, the grand army marched to the Niemen, in three  separate masses. The king of Westphalia, with 80,000 men, moved upon  Grodno; the viceroy of Italy, with 75,000 men, upon Pilony; Napoleon,  with 220,000 men, upon Nogaraiski, a farm situated three leagues beyond  Kowno. The 23d of June, before daylight, the imperial column reached the  Niemen, but without seeing it. The borders of the great Prussian forest  of Pilwisky, and the hills which line the river, concealed the great  army, which was about to cross it.    Napoleon, who had travelled in a carriage as far as that, mounted his  horse at two o'clock in the morning. He reconnoitred the Russian river,  without disguising himself, as has been falsely asserted, but under  cover of the night crossing this frontier, which five months"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18127"],[0,"The Beginner's American History (#20)"],[1,"in the western forests; his bear tree.--When  Daniel had grown to manhood, he wandered off with his gun on his  shoulder, and crossing the mountains, entered what is now the state  of Tennessee. That whole country was then a wilderness, full of  savage beasts and still more savage Indians; and Boone had many a  sharp fight with both.    More than a hundred and thirty years ago, he cut these words on a  beech-tree, still standing in Eastern Tennessee,[3]--\"D. Boon  killed a bar on (this) tree in the year 1760.\" You will see if you  examine the tree, on which the words can still be read, that Boone  could not spell very well; but he could do what the bear minded a  good deal more,--he could shoot to kill.    [Illustration: BOONE'S BEAR TREE.]    [Footnote 3: The tree is still standing on the banks of Boone's Creek,  near Jonesboro, Washington County, Tennessee.]      148. Boone goes hunting in Kentucky; what kind of game he found there;  the Indians; the \"Dark and Bloody Ground.\"--Nine years after he cut  his name on that tree, Boone, with a few companions, went to a new  part of the country. The Indians called it Kentucky. There he saw  buffalo, deer, bears, and wolves enough to satisfy the best hunter  in America.    This region was a kind of No Man's Land, because, though many tribes  of Indians roamed over it, none of them pretended to own it. These  bands of Indians were always fighting and trying to drive each other  out, so Kentucky was often called the \"Dark and Bloody Ground.\" But,  much as the savages hated each other, they hated the white men, or  the \"pale-faces,\" as they called them, still more.      149. Indian tricks; the owls.--The hunters were on the lookout for  these Indians, but the savages practised all kinds of tricks to get  the hunters near enough to shoot them. Sometimes Boone would hear  the gobble of a wild turkey. He would listen a moment, then he would  say, That is not a wild turkey, but an Indian, imitating that bird;  but he won't fool me and get me to come near enough to put a bullet  through my head.    One evening an old hunter, on his way to his cabin, heard what seemed  to be two young owls calling to each other. But his quick ear noticed  that there was something not quite natural in their calls, and what  was stranger still, that the owls seemed to be on the ground instead  of being perched on trees, as all well-behaved owls would be. He crept  cautiously along through the bushes till he saw something ahead which  looked like a stump. He didn't altogether like the looks of the stump.  He aimed his rifle at it, and fired. The stump, or what seemed to  be one, fell over backward with a groan. He had killed an Indian,  who had been waiting to kill him.      150. Boone makes the \"Wilderness Road,\" and builds the fort at  Boonesboro'.--In 1775 Boone, with a party of thirty men, chopped a  path through the forest from the mountains of Eastern Tennessee to  the Kentucky River,[4] a distance of about two hundred miles. This  was the first path in that part of the country leading to the great  west. It was called the \"_Wilderness Road_.\" Over that road, which  thousands of emigrants travelled afterward, Boone took his family,  with other settlers, to the Kentucky River. There they built a fort  called Boonesboro'. That fort was a great protection to all the first  settlers in Kentucky. In fact, it is hard to see how the state could  have grown up without it. So in one way, we can say with truth that  Daniel Boone, the hunter, fighter, and road-maker, was a  state-builder besides.    [Illustration: MAP SHOWING BOONE'S \"WILDERNESS ROAD.\"]    [Footnote 4: See map in this paragraph.]      151. Boone's daughter is stolen by the Indians; how he found  her.--One day Boone's young daughter was out, with two other girls,  in a canoe on the river. Suddenly some Indians pounced on them and  carried them off.    One of the girls, as she went along, broke off twigs from the bushes,  so that her friends might be able to follow her track through the  woods. An Indian caught her doing it, and told her that he would kill  her if she did not instantly stop. Then she slyly tore off small bits  of her dress, and dropped a piece from time to time.    Boone and his men followed the Indians like bloodhounds. They picked  up the bits of dress, and so easily found which way the savages had  gone. They came up with the Indians just as they were sitting down  round a fire to eat their supper. Creeping toward them behind the  trees as softly as a cat creeps up behind a mouse, Boone and his men  aimed their rifles and fired. Two of the Indians fell dead, the rest  ran for their lives, and the girls were carried back in safety to  the fort.      152. Boone is captured by Indians; they adopt him as a son.--Later,  Boone himself was caught and carried off by the Indians. They  respected his courage so much that they would not kill him, but  decided to adopt him; that is, take him into the tribe as one of their  own people, or make an Indian of him.    They pulled out all his hair except one long lock, called the  \"scalp-lock,\" which they left to grow in Indian fashion. The  squaws[5] and girls braided bright feathers in this lock, so that  Boone looked quite gay. Then the Indians took him down to a river.  There they stripped him, and scrubbed him with all their might, to  get his white blood out, as they said. Next, they painted his face  in stripes with red and yellow clay, so that he looked, as they  thought, handsomer than he ever had before in his life. When all had  been done, and they were satisfied with the appearance of their new  Indian, they sat down to a great feast, and made merry.    [Footnote 5: Squaws: Indian women.]      153. Boone escapes, but the Indians find him again; what a handful  of tobacco dust did.--After a time Boone managed to escape, but the  Indians were so fond of him that they could not rest till they found  him again. One day he was at work in a kind of shed drying some tobacco  leaves. He heard a slight noise, and turning round saw four Indians  with their guns pointed at him. \"Now, Boone,\" said they, \"we got you.  You no get away this time.\" \"How are you?\" said Boone, pleasantly;  \"glad to see you; just wait a minute till I get you some of my  tobacco.\" He gathered two large handfuls of the leaves: they were  as dry as powder and crumbled to dust in his hands. Coming forward,  as if to give the welcome present to the Indians, he suddenly sprang  on them and filled their eyes, mouths, and noses with the stinging  tobacco dust. The savages were half choked and nearly blinded. While  they were dancing about, coughing, sneezing, and rubbing their eyes,  Boone slipped out of the shed and got to a place of safety. The Indians  were mad as they could be, yet they could hardly help laughing at  Boone's trick; for cunning as the red men were, he was more cunning  still.    [Illustration: BOONE'S FORT, AT BOONESBORO', KENTUCKY.]      154. Boone's old age; he moves to Missouri; he begs for a piece of  land; his grave.--Boone lived to be a very old man. He had owned a  good deal of land in the west, but he had lost possession of it. When  Kentucky began to fill up with people and the game was killed off,  Boone moved across the Mississippi into Missouri. He said that he  went because he wanted \"more elbow room\" and a chance to hunt buffalo  again.    He now begged the state of Kentucky to give him a small piece of land,  where, as he said, he could \"lay his bones.\" The people of that state  generously helped him to get nearly a thousand acres; but he appears  to have soon lost possession of it. If he actually did lose it, then  this brave old hunter, who had opened up the way for such a multitude  of emigrants to get farms at the west, died without owning a piece  of ground big enough for a grave. He is buried in Frankfort, Kentucky,  within sight of the river on which he built his fort at Boonesboro'.      155. Summary.--Daniel Boone, a famous hunter from North Carolina,  opened up a road through the forest, from the mountains of Eastern  Tennessee to the Kentucky River. It was called the \"Wilderness Road,\"  and over it thousands of emigrants went into Kentucky to settle.  Boone, with others, built the fort at Boonesboro', Kentucky, and went  there to live. That fort protected the settlers against the Indians,  and so helped that part of the country to grow until it became the  state of Kentucky.      Tell about Daniel Boone. How did he help his father?

Who James Robertson was; Governor Tryon; the battle of  Alamance.[2]--When Daniel Boone first went to Kentucky (1769) he had  a friend named James Robertson, in North Carolina[3] who was, like  himself, a mighty hunter. The British governor of North Carolina at  that time was William Tryon. He lived in a palace built with money  which he had forced the people to give him. They hated him so for  his greed and cruelty that they nicknamed him the \"Great Wolf of North  Carolina.\"    At last many of the settlers vowed that they would not give the  governor another penny. When he sent tax-collectors to get money,  they drove them back, and they flogged one of the governor's friends  with a rawhide till he had to run for his life.    The governor then collected some soldiers and"]]]
