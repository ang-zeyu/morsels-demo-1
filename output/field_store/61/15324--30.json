It is often said that the sole purpose  of Columbus was to discover such a route, yet it is clear that he  expected to make some new discoveries, and that if he did not, the  sovereigns were under no specified obligations to him. Patents are  usually drawn on the lines indicated by the petitioner. Can we conclude  that the complete silence of the articles as to the Indies means that  Ferdinand and Isabella refused to make any promises if Columbus only  succeeded in reaching the known East Indies and could gain for them no  new possessions?          TITLE GRANTED BY THE CATHOLIC SOVEREIGNS TO CRISTOBAL COLON OF ADMIRAL,  VICEROY AND GOVERNOR OF THE ISLANDS AND MAINLAND THAT MAY BE  DISCOVERED[81-1]      Don Ferdinand and Donna Isabella, by the grace of God King and Queen of  Castile, Leon, Aragon, Sicily, Granada, Toledo, Valencia, Galicia,  Majorca, Seville, Sardinia, Cordova, Corsica, Murcia, Jaen, Algarbe,  Algeciras, Gibraltar, and the Canary Islands; Count and Countess of  Barcelona; Lords of Biscay and Molina; Dukes of Athens and Neopatria;  Counts of Roussillon and Cerdagne, Marquises of Oristano and Goziano;  Forasmuch as you, Cristobal Colon, are going by our command, with some of  our ships and with our subjects, to discover and acquire certain islands  and mainland in the ocean, and it is hoped that, by the help of God, some  of the said islands and mainland in the said ocean will be discovered and  acquired by your pains and industry; and as it is a just and reasonable  thing that since you incur the said danger for our service you should be  rewarded for it, and since we desire to honor and favor you on account of  what is aforesaid, it is our will and pleasure that you, the said  Cristobal Colon, after you have discovered and acquired the said islands  and mainland in the said ocean, or any of them whatsoever, shall be our  Admiral of the said islands and mainland which you may thus discover and  acquire, and shall be our Admiral and Viceroy and Governor therein, and  shall be empowered from that time forward to call and entitle yourself  Don Cristobal Colon, and that your sons and successors in the said office  and charge may likewise entitle and call themselves Don, and Admiral and  Viceroy and Governor thereof; and that you may have power to use and  exercise the said office of Admiral, together with the said office of  Viceroy and Governor of the said islands and mainland which you may thus  discover and acquire, by yourself or by your lieutenants, and to hear and  determine all the suits and causes civil and criminal appertaining to the  said office of Admiralty, Viceroy, and Governor according as you shall  find by law, and as the Admirals of our kingdoms are accustomed to use  and exercise it; and may have power to punish and chastise delinquents,  and exercise the said offices of Admiralty, Viceroy, and Governor, you  and your said lieutenants, in all that concerns and appertains to the  said offices and to each of them; and that you shall have and levy the  fees and salaries annexed, belonging and appertaining to the said offices  and to each of them, according as our High Admiral in the Admiralty of  our kingdoms levies and is accustomed to levy them.

JOURNAL OF THE FIRST VOYAGE OF COLUMBUS          INTRODUCTION      The contents of Columbus's Journal of his first voyage were first made  known to the public in the epitome incorporated in Ferdinand Columbus's  life of the Admiral, which has come down to us only in the Italian  translation of Alfonso Ulloa, the _Historie del S.D. Fernando Colombo  nelle quali s'ha particolare e vera relazione della vita e de' fatti  dell' Ammiraglio D. Christoforo Colombo suo padre_, etc. (Venice, 1571).  This account is accessible in English in Churchill's _Voyages_, Vol. II.,  and in Pinkerton's _Voyages_, Vol. XII.    Another epitome was prepared by Bartolome de Las Casas and inserted in  his _Historia de las Indias_. This account was embodied in the main by  Antonio de Herrera in his _Historia General de las Indias Occidentales_  (Madrid, 1601). It is accessible in English in John Stevens's translation  of Herrera (London, 1725-1726).    These independent epitomes of the original were supplemented in 1825 by  the publication by the Spanish archivist Martin Fernandez de Navarrete in  his _Coleccion de los Viages y Descubrimientos que hicieron por mar los  Espanoles desde fines del siglo XV._ of a considerably more detailed  narrative (likewise independently abridged from the original) which  existed in two copies in the archives of the Duke del Infantado.  Navarrete says that the handwriting of the older copy is that of Las  Casas and that Las Casas had written some explanatory notes in the  margin.

Be careful as you go down the steps, Florence.\"    Tim Bolton was standing behind the bar, and as he heard steps he  looked carelessly toward the entrance, but when he saw Florence, his  indifference vanished. He came from behind the bar, and advanced to  meet her.    \"Miss Linden,\" he said.    Florence shrank back and clung to her companion's arm.    \"Is there anything I can do for you? I am a rough man, but I'm not so  bad as you may think.\"    \"That's what I told her, Tim,\" said Mrs. O'Keefe. \"I told Florence  there was worse men than you.\"    \"Thank you, Mrs. O'Keefe. Can I offer you a glass of whiskey?\"    The apple-woman was about to accept, but she felt an alarmed tug at  her arm, and saw that Florence would be placed in an embarrassing  position if she accepted. So, by an exercise of self-denial--for Mrs.  O'Keefe was by no means insensible to the attractions of whiskey,  though she never drank to excess--she said:    \"Thank you kindly, Mr. Bolton. I won't take any just now; but I'll  remind you of your offer another day.\"    \"Have it your own way, Mrs. O'Keefe. And now, what can I do for you  and Miss Linden?\"    \"Oh, Mr. Bolton,\" broke in Florence, unable to bear the suspense  longer, \"where is Dodger?\"          Chapter XXV.  Finding The Clew.      Tim Bolton looked at Florence in undisguised astonishment.    \"Dodger!\" he repeated. \"How should I know? I supposed that you had  lured him away from me.\"    \"He didn't like the business you were in. He preferred to make a  living in some other way.\"    \"Then why do you ask me where he is?\"    \"Because he did not come home last night. Shure he rooms at my house,\"  put in Mrs. O'Keefe, \"and he hasn't showed up since----\"    \"And you thought I might have got hold of him?\" said Bolton,  inquiringly.    \"Then you are mistaken. I haven't seen the boy for weeks.\"    Tim Bolton spoke so straightforwardly that there was no chance to  doubt his word.    \"When he was living with you, Mr. Bolton,\" continued Florence, \"did he  ever stay away like this?\"    \"No,\" answered Bolton. \"Dodger was always very regular about comin'  home.\"    \"Then something must have happened to him,\" said Florence, anxiously.    \"He might have got run in,\" suggested the apple-woman. \"Some of them  cops is mighty officious.\"    \"Dodger would never do anything to deserve arrest,\" Florence said,  quickly.    \"Thrue for you, Florence, but some innersent parties are nabbed. I  know of one young man who was standin' on a strate corner waitin' for  the cars, when a cop came up and arristed him for disorderly conduct.\"    \"But that is shameful!\" said Florence, indignantly.    \"Thrue for you, my dear. We might go round to the police headquarters  and inquire if the boy's been run in.\"    \"What do you think, Mr. Bolton?\" asked Florence.    Tim Bolton seemed busy thinking. Finally he brought down his hand  forcibly on the bar, and said: \"I begin to see through it.\"    Florence did not speak, but she fixed an eager look of inquiry on the  face of the saloon-keeper.    \"I believe Curtis Waring is at the bottom of this,\" he said.    \"My cousin!\" exclaimed Florence, in astonishment.    \"Yes, your cousin, Miss Linden.\"    \"But what can he have against poor Dodger! Is it because the boy has  taken my part and is a friend to me?\"    \"He wouldn't like him any better on account of hat; but he has another  and a more powerful reason.\"    \"Would you mind telling me what it is? I cannot conceive what it can  be.\"    \"At present,\" answered Bolton, cautiously, \"I prefer to say nothing on  the subject. I will only say the boy's disappearance interferes with  my plans, and I will see if I can't find out what has become of him.\"    \"If you only will, Mr. Bolton, I shall be so grateful. I am afraid I  have misjudged you. I thought you were an enemy of Dodger's.\"    \"Then you were mistaken. I have had the boy with me since he was a  kid, and though I've been rough with him at times, maybe, I like him,  and I may some time have a chance to show him that old Tim Bolton is  one of his best friends.\"    \"I will believe it now, Mr. Bolton,\" said Florence, impulsively,  holding out her hand to the burly saloon-keeper.    He was surprised, but it was evident that he was pleased, also, and he  took the little hand respectfully in his own ample palm, and pressed  it in a friendly manner.    \"There's one thing more I want you to believe, Miss Linden,\" he said,  \"and that is, that I am your friend, also.\"    \"Thank you, Mr. Bolton. And now let us all work together to find  Dodger.\"    \"You can count on me, Miss Linden. If you'll tell me where you live  I'll send or bring you any news I may hear.\"    \"I live with Mrs. O'Keefe, my good friend, here.\"    \"I haven't my kyard with me, Tim,\" said the apple-woman, \"but I'll  give you my strate and number. You know my place of business?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"If you come to me there I'll let Florence know whatever you tell me.  She is not always at home.\"    The two went away relieved in mind, for, helpless and bewildered as  they were, they felt that Tim Bolton would make a valuable ally.    When they had gone Tim turned to Hooker and Briggs, who were lounging  at a table, waiting for some generous customer to invite them to the  bar.    \"Boys,\" said Tim, \"has either of you seen anything of Dodger lately?\"    \"No,\" answered the two in unison.    \"Have you heard anything of him?\"    \"I heard that he was baggage-smashin' down by the steamboat landings,\"  said Hooker.    \"Go down there, both of you, and see if you can see or hear anything  of him.\"    \"All right, Tim.\"    And the two left the saloon and took a westerly route toward the North  River piers.    Three hours later they returned.    \"Have you heard anything?\" asked Bolton. \"Did you see Dodger?\"    \"No; we didn't see him.\"    \"But you heard something?\"    \"Yes; we found a boy, a friend of his, that said the last he saw of  Dodger was last evenin'.\"    \"Where did he see him?\"    \"Near the pier of the Albany boats.\"    \"What was he doin'?\"    \"Carryin' a valise for a man.\"    \"What kind of a man? How did he look?\"    \"He had gray hair and gray whiskers.\"    Tim was puzzled by the description.    If, as he suspected, Curtis were concerned in the abduction, this man  could not have been he.    \"The man was a passenger by the Albany boat, I suppose?\"    \"No; that was what looked queer. Before the Albany boat came in the  man was lyin' round with his valise, and the boy thought he was goin'  off somewhere. But when the boat came in he just mixed in with the  passengers, and came up to the entrance of the pier. Two boys asked to  carry his valise, but he shook his head till Dodger came round, and he  engaged him right off.\"    Tim Bolton nodded knowingly.    \"It was a plan,\" he said. \"The man wanted to get hold of Dodger. What  puzzles me is, that you said he was an old man.\"    \"His hair and beard were gray.\"    \"And Curtis has no beard, and his hair is black.\"    \"But the boy said he didn't look like an old man, except the hair. He  walked off like a young man.\"    Tim Bolton's face lighted up with sudden intelligence.    \"I'll bet a hat it was Curtis in disguise,\" he soliloquized.    \"That's all we could find out, Mr. Bolton,\" said Briggs, with another  longing look at the bar.    \"It is enough! You have earned your whiskey. Walk up, gentlemen!\"    Hooker and Briggs needed no second invitation.    \"Will either of you take a note for me to Mrs. O'Keefe? For another  drink, of course.\"    \"I will, Tim,\" said Hooker, eagerly.    \"No; take me, Mr. Bolton,\" entreated Briggs.    \"You can both go,\" said Tim, generously. \"Wait a minute, and I'll have  it ready for you.\"    He found a half sheet of note paper, and scribbled on it this message:        \"Mrs. O'Keefe:--Tell Miss Linden that I have a clew. I am      almost surtin her cozen has got away with Dodger. He won't      hurt him, but he will get him out of the city. Wen I hear      more I will right.                                                     \"T. Bolton.\"          Chapter XXVI.  Bolton Makes A Discovery.      \"I see it all,\" Bolton said to himself, thoughtfully. \"Curtis Waring  is afraid of the boy--and of me. He's circumvented me neatly, and the  game is his--so far my little plan is dished. I must find out for  certain whether he's had anything to do with gettin' Dodger out of the  way, and then, Tim Bolton, you must set your wits to work to spoil his  little game.\"    Bolton succeeded in securing the services of a young man who had  experience at tending bar, and about eight o'clock, after donning his  best attire, he hailed a Fourth Avenue surface car and got aboard.    Getting out at the proper street, he made his way to Madison Avenue,  and ascended the steps of John Linden's residence.    The door was opened by Jane, who eyed the visitor with no friendly  glance.    \"What do you want?\" she asked, in a hostile tone.    \"Is Mr. Waring at home?\"    \"I don't know.\"    \"Is Miss Florence at home?\"    \"Do you know her?\" she asked.    \"Yes; I am a friend of hers.\"    Jane evidently thought that Florence must have made some queer  friends.    \"Have you seen her lately?\" she asked eagerly.    \"I saw her to-day.\"    \"Is she well?\"    \"Yes; she is well, but she is in trouble.\"    \"Is she---- Does she need any money?\"    \"No; it isn't that. The boy Dodger has disappeared, and she is afraid  something has happened to him.\"    \"Oh, I am so sorry! He was a good friend of Miss Florence.\"    \"I see you know him. I am trying to help him and her.\"    \"But you asked for Mr. Waring?\" said Jane, suspiciously.    \"So I did. Shall I tell you why?\"    \"I wish you would.\"    \"I think he has something to do with gettin' Dodger out of the way,  and I'm goin' to try to find out.\"    \"He won't tell you.\"    \"You don't understand. I shall make him think I am on his side. Was he  at home last night?\"    \"He went away at dinner time, and he didn't"]]]
