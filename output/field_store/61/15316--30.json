Between the  equator and latitude 30 deg. or 40 deg. there is a difference of six  minutes in the rotation period--i.e., the equatorial parts turn round  the axis so much faster than the parts north and south of them, that in  one rotation they gain six minutes of time. In other words, the clouds  over Jupiter's equator flow past those in the middle latitudes with a  relative velocity of 270 miles per hour. But there are no sharp lines  of separation between the different velocities; on the contrary, the  swiftness of rotation gradually diminishes from the equator toward the  poles, as it manifestly could not do if the visible surface of Jupiter  were solid.    In this respect Jupiter resembles the sun, whose surface also has  different rates of rotation diminishing from the equator. Measured by  the motion of spots on or near the equator, Jupiter's rotation period is  about nine hours fifty minutes; measured by the motion of spots in the  middle latitudes, it is about nine hours fifty-six minutes. The red spot  completes a rotation in a little less than nine hours and fifty-six  minutes, but its period can not be positively given for the singular  reason that it is variable. The variation amounts to only a few seconds  in the course of several years, but it is nevertheless certain. The  phenomenon of variable motion is not, however, peculiar to the red spot.  Mr. W.F. Denning, who has studied Jupiter for a quarter of a century,  says:    \"It is well known that in different latitudes of Jupiter there are  currents, forming the belts and zones, moving at various rates of speed.  In many instances the velocity changes from year to year. And it is a  singular circumstance that in the same current a uniform motion is not  maintained in all parts of the circumference. Certain spots move faster  than others, so that if we would obtain a fair value for the rotation  period of any current it is not sufficient to derive it from one marking  alone; we must follow a number of objects distributed in different  longitudes along the current and deduce a mean from the whole.\"[10]    [Footnote 10: The Observatory, No. 286, December, 1899.]    Nor is this all. Observation indicates that if we could look at a  vertical section of Jupiter's atmosphere we should behold an equally  remarkable contrast and conflict of motions. There is evidence that some  of the visible spots, or clouds, lie at a greater elevation than others,  and it has been observed that the deeper ones move more rapidly. This  fact has led some observers to conclude that the deep-lying spots may be  a part of the actual surface of the planet. But if we could think that  there is any solid nucleus, or core, in the body of Jupiter, it would  seem, on account of the slight mean density of the planet, that it can  not lie so near the visible surface, but must be at a depth of  thousands, perhaps tens of thousands, of miles. Since the telescope is  unable to penetrate the cloudy envelope we can only guess at the actual  constitution of the interior of Jupiter's globe. In a spirit of mere  speculative curiosity it has been suggested that deep under the clouds  of the great planet there may be a comparatively small solid globe, even  a habitable world, closed round by a firmament all its own, whose vault,  raised 30,000 or 40,000 miles above the surface of the imprisoned  planet, appears only an unbroken dome, too distant to reveal its real  nature to watchers below, except, perhaps, under telescopic scrutiny;  enclosing, as in a shell, a transparent atmosphere, and deriving its  illumination partly from the sunlight that may filter through, but  mainly from some luminous source within.    But is not Jupiter almost equally fascinating to the imagination, if we  dismiss all attempts to picture a humanly impossible world shut up  within it, and turn rather to consider what its future may be, guided by  the not unreasonable hypothesis that, because of its immense size and  mass, it is still in a chaotic condition? Mention has been made of the  resemblance of Jupiter to the sun by virtue of their similar manner of  rotation. This is not the only reason for looking upon Jupiter as being,  in some respects, almost as much a solar as a planetary body. Its  exceptional brightness rather favors the view that a small part of the  light by which it shines comes from its own incandescence. In size and  mass it is half-way between the earth and the sun. Jupiter is eleven  times greater than the earth in diameter and thirteen hundred times  greater in volume; the sun is ten times greater than Jupiter in diameter  and a thousand times greater in volume. The mean density of Jupiter, as  we have seen, is almost exactly the same as the sun's.    Now, the history of the solar system, according to the nebular  hypothesis, is a history of cooling and condensation. The sun, a  thousand times larger than Jupiter, has not yet sufficiently cooled and  contracted to become incrusted, except with a shell of incandescent  metallic clouds; Jupiter, a thousand times smaller than the sun, has  cooled and contracted until it is but slightly, if at all, incandescent  at its surface, while its thickening shell, although still composed of  vapor and smoke, and still probably hot, has grown so dense that it  entirely cuts off the luminous radiation from within; the earth, to  carry the comparison one step further, being more than a thousand times  smaller than Jupiter, has progressed so far in the process of cooling  that its original shell of vapor has given place to one of solid rock.    A sudden outburst of light from Jupiter, such as occurs occasionally in  a star that is losing its radiance through the condensation of  absorbing vapors around it, would furnish strong corroboration of the  theory that Jupiter is really an extinguished sun which is now on the  way to become a planet in the terrestrial sense.    Not very long ago, as time is reckoned in astronomy, our sun, viewed  from the distance of the nearer fixed stars, may have appeared as a  binary star, the brighter component of the pair being the sun itself and  the fainter one the body now called the planet Jupiter. Supposing the  latter to have had the same intrinsic brilliance, surface for surface,  as the sun, it would have radiated one hundred times less light than the  sun. A difference of one hundredfold between the light of two stars  means that they are six magnitudes apart; or, in other words, from a  point in space where the sun appeared as bright as what we call a  first-magnitude star, its companion, Jupiter, would have shone as a  sixth-magnitude star. Many stars have companions proportionally much  fainter than that. The companion of Sirius, for instance, is at least  ten thousand times less bright than its great comrade.    Looking at Jupiter in this way, it interests us not as the probable  abode of intelligent life, but as a world in the making, a world,  moreover, which, when it is completed--if it ever shall be after the  terrestrial pattern--will dwarf our globe into insignificance. That  stupendous miracle of world-making which is dimly painted in the grand  figures employed by the writers of Genesis, and the composers of other  cosmogonic legends, is here actually going on before our eyes. The  telescope shows us in the cloudy face of Jupiter the moving of the  spirit upon the face of the great deep. What the final result will be we  can not tell, but clearly the end of the grand processes there in  operation has not yet been reached.    The interesting suggestion was made and urged by Mr. Proctor that if  Jupiter itself is in no condition at present to bear life, its  satellites may be, in that respect, more happily circumstanced. It can  not be said that very much has been learned about the satellites of  Jupiter since Proctor's day, and his suggestion is no less and no more  probable now than it was when first offered.    There has been cumulative evidence that Jupiter's satellites obey the  same law that governs the rotation of our moon, viz., that which compels  them always to keep the same face turned toward their primary, and this  would clearly affect, although it might not preclude, their  habitability. With the exception of the minute fifth satellite  discovered by Barnard in 1892, they are all of sufficient size to retain  at least some traces of an atmosphere. In fact, one of them is larger  than the planet Mars, and another is of nearly the same size as that  planet, while the smallest of the four principal ones is about equal to  our moon. Under the powerful attraction of Jupiter they travel rapidly,  and viewed from the surface of that planet they would offer a wonderful  spectacle.    They are continually causing solar eclipses and themselves undergoing  eclipse in Jupiter's shadow, and their swiftly changing aspects and  groupings would be watched by an astronomer on Jupiter with undying  interest.    But far more wonderful would be the spectacle presented by Jupiter to  inhabitants dwelling on his moons. From the nearer moon, in particular,  which is situated less than 220,000 miles from Jupiter's surface, the  great planet would be an overwhelming phenomenon in the sky.    Its immense disk, hanging overhead, would cover a circle of the  firmament twenty degrees in diameter, or, in round numbers, forty times  the diameter of the full moon as seen from the earth! It would shed a  great amount of light and heat, and thus would more or less effectively  supply the deficit of solar radiation, for we must remember that Jupiter  and his satellites receive from the sun less than one twenty-fifth as  much light and heat as the earth receives.

Before cutting, the crust may be lifted and the apples  seasoned with butter and sugar, or the seasoning may be added after  serving. A liquid or a hard sauce may be served with the slump. If the  apples are a kind that do not cook easily bake half an hour, then put on  the crust and set back in the oven.      ~BREAD PUFFS WITH SAUCE~--When bread dough is raised light, cut off  small pieces and pull out two or three inches long. Fry like doughnuts  in deep fat and put into a deep dish, turn over the puffs a cream sauce  seasoned with salt and pepper.      ~CHERRY DUMPLINGS~--Sift two cups of pastry flour with four level  teaspoons of baking powder and a saltspoon of salt. Mix with  three-quarters cup of milk or enough to make a soft dough. Butter some  cups well, put a tablespoon of dough in each, then a large tablespoon of  stoned cherries and another tablespoon of dough. Set in a steamer or set  the cups in a pan of hot water and into the oven to cook half an hour.  Serve with a sweet liquid sauce.      ~COTTAGE CHEESE TARTLETS~--One cup cheese, three level tablespoons  sugar, few grains salt, two teaspoons melted butter, one tablespoon  lemon juice, yolks two eggs, one-fourth cup milk, whites two eggs. Press  the cheese through a potato ricer or sieve, then add the sugar, salt,  butter, lemon juice, and the egg yolks well beaten and mixed with the  milk. Mix well and fold the whites of the eggs beaten stiff. Line  individual tins with pastry and fill three-fourths full with the  mixture. Bake in a moderate oven for thirty minutes.      ~PRUNE TARTS~--Wash the prunes thoroughly and soak over night or for  several hours. Cook in the same water. When very tender rub them through  a sieve. To one cup of the pulp add one tablespoon of lemon juice, the  yolks of two eggs beaten with one-half cup of thin cream and a few  grains of salt. Mix well and sweeten to taste, then fold in the whites  of two eggs beaten very stiff. Line small tins with paste, fill with the  mixture and bake in a moderate oven. Serve cold.      ~RASPBERRY DUMPLINGS~--Wash one cup of rice and put into the double  boiler. Pour over it two cups of boiling water, add one-half teaspoon of  salt and two tablespoons of sugar and cook thirty minutes or until soft.  Have some small pudding cloths about twelve inches square, wring them  out of hot water and lay them over a small half pint bowl. Spread the  rice one-third of an inch thick over the cloth, and fill the center with  fresh raspberries. Draw the cloth around until the rice covers the  berries and they are a good round shape. Tie the ends of the cloth  firmly, drop them into boiling water and cook twenty minutes. Remove the  cloth and serve with lemon sauce.      ~TART SHELLS~--Roll out thin a nice puff paste, cut with a small biscuit  cutter. With cutter take out the centers of two or three of these, lay  the rings thus made on the third and bake immediately. Shells may also  be made by lining pattypans with the paste; if the paste is light the  shells will be fine and may be used for tarts or oyster patties. Filled  with jelly and covered with meringue (a tablespoonful of sugar to the  white of an egg), and browned in the oven.      ~BAVARIAN CREAM~--Soak one-quarter of a box of gelatin in cold water  until it is soft, then dissolve it in a cup of hot milk with one-third  of a cup of sugar. Flavor with vanilla and set away to cool. Whip one  pint of cream and when the gelatin is cold and beginning to stiffen stir  in the cream lightly. Form in mold.      ~BOILED CUSTARD~--Heat two cups of milk in a double boiler and pour on  to the yolks of three eggs beaten light, with three rounding tablespoons  of sugar and a pinch of salt. Return to the double boiler and cook until  the spoon will coat with the custard. Cool and add flavoring.      ~CALLA LILIES~--Beat three eggs and a rounding cup of sugar together,  add two-thirds cup of flour and one-half teaspoon of lemon flavoring.  Drop in teaspoonfuls on a buttered sheet, allowing plenty of room to  spread in baking. Bake in a moderate oven, take up with a knife, and  roll at once into lily shape. Bake but four or five at a time because if  the cakes cool even a little they will break. Fill each with a little  beaten and sweetened cream.      ~COCOA CUSTARD~--For three cups of milk allow four teaspoons of cocoa,  three beaten eggs, three tablespoons of sugar, and three-quarters  teaspoon of vanilla. Heat the milk, stir in the cocoa, and cool a little  before pouring over the egg and sugar. Bake in custard cups set in a pan  of hot water in a moderate oven.      ~COFFEE CREAM~--Have one and one-half cups of strong coffee hot, add one  level tablespoon of gelatin soaked in one-half cup of milk for fifteen  minutes. When well dissolved add two-thirds cup of sugar, a saltspoon of  salt, and the yolks of three eggs beaten light, stir in the double  boiler till thick, take from the fire, and add the white of three eggs  beaten stiff and one-half teaspoon of vanilla. Fill molds that have been  dipped in cold water, set in cool place and when firm unmold and serve  with powdered sugar and cream.      ~COFFEE CUP CUSTARD~--One quart milk, one-fourth cup ground coffee, four  eggs, one-half cup sugar, one-fourth level teaspoon salt, one-half  teaspoon vanilla. Tie the coffee loosely in a piece of cheesecloth and  put into double boiler with the milk. Scald until a good coffee color  and flavor is obtained, then remove from the fire. Remove the coffee.  Beat the eggs and add the sugar, salt and vanilla, then pour on  gradually the milk. Strain into cups, place in a pan of hot water, and  bake in a moderate oven until firm in the middle. Less vanilla is  required when combined with another flavoring.          CAKES, CRULLERS AND ECLAIRS      ~ALMOND CAKES~--One pound sifted flour, one-half pound butter,  three-fourths pound sugar, two eggs, one-half teaspoon ground cinnamon,  four ounces of almonds blanched and chopped very fine. Two ounces of  raisins finely chopped. Mix all the dry ingredients together, then rub  in the butter, add eggs and spices last of all, roll out half an inch  thick, cut in fancy shapes and bake in a slow oven.      ~ALMOND CHEESE CAKES~--Blanch and pound to a fine paste one cupful  almonds. As you pound them add rose water, a few drops at a time to keep  them from oiling. Add the paste to one cupful milk curd, together with a  half cup cream, one cupful sugar, three beaten egg yolks and a scant  teaspoonful of rose water. Fill patty pans lined with paste and bake in  hot oven ten minutes.      ~AUNT AMY'S CAKE~--Take two eggs, one and one-half cups of sugar, one  cup of sour milk, one-half cup of butter, two cups of flour and one  teaspoonful of soda. Spice to taste. This is a good cake and one which  is also inexpensive in baking. Use a moderate oven and bake in loaves  rather than sheets.      ~BALTIMORE CAKE~--Beat one cupful of butter to a cream, using a wood  cake spoon. Add gradually while beating constantly two cupfuls fine  granulated sugar. When creamy add a cupful of milk, alternating with  three and one-half cupfuls pastry flour that has been mixed and sifted  with two teaspoonfuls of baking powder. Add a teaspoonful of vanilla and  the whites of six eggs beaten stiff and dry. Bake in three buttered and  floured shallow cake tins, and spread between the layers and on top the  following icing: Put in a saucepan three cups sugar, one cup water. Heat  gradually to the boiling point, and cook without stirring until the  syrup will thread. Pour the hot syrup gradually over the well beaten  whites of three eggs and continue beating until of the right consistency  for spreading. Then add one cupful chopped and seeded raisins, one cup  chopped pecan meats and five figs cut in strips.      ~BALTIMORE CAKE--~For this cake use one cupful butter, two cupfuls  sugar, three and one-half cupfuls flour, one cupful sweet milk, two  teaspoonfuls baking powder, the whites of six eggs and a teaspoonful of  rose water. Cream the butter, add the sugar gradually, beating steadily,  then the milk and flavoring, next the flour sifted with the baking  powder, and lastly the stiffly beaten whites folded in at the last. Bake  in three layer cake tins in an oven hotter than for loaf cake. While  baking prepare the filling. Dissolve three cupfuls sugar in one cupful  boiling water, and cook until it spins a thread. Pour over the stiffly  beaten whites of three eggs, stirring constantly. Add to this icing one  cupful chopped raisins, one cupful chopped nut meats, preferably pecans  or walnuts, and a half dozen figs cut in fine strips. Use this for  filling and also ice the top and sides with it.      ~BREAD CAKE--~Cream one cup of sugar and one-half cup of butter, add  one-half cup of milk, two cups of flour sifted with three teaspoons of  baking powder and last the stiffly beaten whites of three eggs and half  a teaspoon of vanilla flavoring. Bake in one loaf.      ~BRIDE'S CAKE--~One and one-half cupfuls of sugar, one-half cupful of  butter, one-half cupful of sweet milk, two cupfuls of flour, one-quarter  cupful cornstarch, six egg whites, one and one-half teaspoonfuls baking  powder, one teaspoonful vanilla. Cream the sugar and butter, add milk,  flour and cornstarch into which the baking powder has been thoroughly  sifted, stir in the whites of eggs quickly with the flavoring.      ~BUTTERMILK CAKE--~Cream three tablespoons of butter with one cup of  sugar, add one cup of buttermilk, one well beaten egg, two cups of flour  sifted with four teaspoons of baking powder and one-half cup of seeded  raisins cut in pieces and rolled in flour.      ~CHOCOLATE CAKE--~Beat one cup of butter to a cream with two cups of  sugar, add the yolks of five eggs, beaten until light-colored, and one  cup of milk. Sift three and one-half cups of flour with five level  teaspoons of baking powder and add to the first mixture. Stir well and  fold in"]]]
