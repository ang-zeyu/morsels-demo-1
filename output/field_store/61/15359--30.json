[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19238"],[0,"Foundations of World Unity (#20)"],[1,"created forms are progressive in their planes or kingdoms of existence  under the stimulus of the power or spirit of life. The universal energy is  dynamic. Nothing is stationary in the material world of outer phenomena or  in the inner world of intellect and consciousness.    Religion is the outer expression of the divine reality. Therefore it must  be living, vitalized, moving and progressive. If it be without motion and  non-progressive it is without the divine life; it is dead. The divine  institutes are continuously active and evolutionary; therefore the  revelation of them must be progressive and continuous. All things are  subject to re-formation. This is a century of life and renewal. Sciences  and arts, industry and invention have been reformed. Law and ethics have  been reconstituted, reorganized. The world of thought has been  regenerated. Sciences of former ages and philosophies of the past are  useless today. Present exigencies demand new methods of solution; world  problems are without precedent. Old ideas and modes of thought are fast  becoming obsolete. Ancient laws and archaic ethical systems will not meet  the requirements of modern conditions, for this is clearly the century of  a new life, the century of the revelation of the reality and therefore the  greatest of all centuries. Consider how the scientific developments of  fifty years have surpassed and eclipsed the knowledge and achievements of  all the former ages combined. Would the announcements and theories of  ancient astronomers explain our present knowledge of the sun-worlds and  planetary systems? Would the mask of obscurity which beclouded mediaeval  centuries meet the demand for clear-eyed vision and understanding which  characterizes the world today? In view of this, shall blind imitations of  ancestral forms and theological interpretations continue to guide and  control the religious life and spiritual development of humanity today?  Shall man gifted with the power of reason unthinkingly follow and adhere  to dogma, creeds and hereditary beliefs which will not bear the analysis  of reason in this century of effulgent reality? Unquestionably this will  not satisfy men of science, for when they find premise or conclusion  contrary to present standards of proof and without real foundation, they  reject that which has been formerly accepted as standard and correct and  move forward from new foundations.    The divine prophets have revealed and founded religion. They have laid  down certain laws and heavenly principles for the guidance of mankind.  They have taught and promulgated the knowledge of God, established  praiseworthy ethical ideals and inculcated the highest standards of virtue  in the human world. Gradually these heavenly teachings and foundations of  reality have been beclouded by human interpretations and dogmatic  imitations of ancestral beliefs. The essential realities which the  prophets labored so hard to establish in human hearts and minds while  undergoing ordeals and suffering tortures of persecution, have now well  nigh vanished. Some of these heavenly messengers have been killed, some  imprisoned; all of them despised and rejected while proclaiming the  reality of divinity. Soon after their departure from this world, the  essential truth of their teachings was lost sight of and dogmatic  imitations adhered to.    Inasmuch as human interpretations and blind imitations differ widely,  religious strife and disagreement have arisen among mankind, the light of  true religion has been extinguished and the unity of the world of humanity  destroyed. The prophets of God voiced the spirit of unity and agreement.  They have been the founders of divine reality. Therefore if the nations of  the world forsake imitations and investigate the reality underlying the  revealed Word of God they will agree and become reconciled. For reality is  one and not multiple.    The nations and religions are steeped in blind and bigoted imitations. A  man is a Jew because his father was a Jew. The Mohammedan follows  implicitly the footsteps of his ancestors in belief and observance. The  Buddhist is true to his heredity as a Buddhist. That is to say they  profess religious belief blindly and without investigation, making unity  and agreement impossible. It is evident therefore that this condition will  not be remedied without a re-formation in the world of religion. In other  words the fundamental reality of the divine religions must be renewed,  reformed, revoiced to mankind.    From the seed of reality, religion has grown into a tree which has put  forth leaves and branches, blossoms and fruit. After a time this tree has  fallen into a condition of decay. The leaves and blossoms have withered  and perished; the tree has become stricken and fruitless. It is not  reasonable that man should hold to the old tree, claiming that its life  forces are undiminished, its fruit unequalled, its existence eternal. The  seed of reality must be sown again in human hearts in order that a new  tree may grow therefrom and new divine fruits refresh the world. By this  means the nations and peoples now divergent in religion will be brought  into unity, imitations will be forsaken and a universal brotherhood in the  reality itself will be established. Warfare and strife will cease among  mankind; all will be reconciled as servants of God. For all are sheltered  beneath the tree of His providence and mercy. God is kind to all; He is  the giver of bounty to all alike, even as His Holiness Jesus Christ has  declared that God \"sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust;\" that is to  say, the mercy of God is universal. All humanity is under the protection  of His love and favor, and unto all He has pointed the way of guidance and  progress.    Progress is of two kinds, material and spiritual. The former is attained  through observation of the surrounding existence and constitutes the  foundation of civilization. Spiritual progress is through the breaths of  the Holy Spirit and is the awakening of the conscious soul of man to  perceive the reality of divinity. Material progress insures the happiness  of the human world. Spiritual progress insures the happiness and eternal  continuance of the soul. The prophets of God have founded the laws of  divine civilization. They have been the root and fundamental source of all  knowledge. They have established the principles of human brotherhood or  fraternity which is of various kinds, such as the fraternity of family, of  race, of nation and of ethical motives. These forms of fraternity, these  bonds of brotherhood are merely temporal and transient in association.  They do not insure harmony and are usually productive of disagreement.  They do not prevent warfare and strife; on the contrary they are selfish,  restricted and fruitful causes of enmity and hatred among mankind. The  spiritual brotherhood which is enkindled and established through the  breaths of the Holy Spirit unites nations and removes the cause of warfare  and strife. It transforms mankind into one great family and establishes  the foundations of the oneness of humanity. It promulgates the spirit of  international agreement and insures universal peace. Therefore we must  investigate the foundation reality of this heavenly fraternity. We must  forsake all imitations and promote the reality of the divine teachings. In  accordance with these principles and actions and by the assistance of the  Holy Spirit, both material and spiritual happiness shall become realized.  Until all nations and peoples become united by the bonds of the Holy  Spirit in this real fraternity, until national and international  prejudices are effaced in the reality of this spiritual brotherhood, true  progress, prosperity and lasting happiness will not be attained by man.  This is the century of new and universal nationhood. Sciences have  advanced, industries have progressed, politics have been reformed, liberty  has been proclaimed, justice is awakening. This is the century of motion,  divine stimulus and accomplishment; the century of human solidarity and  altruistic service; the century of universal peace and the reality of the  divine Kingdom.            DIVINE LOVE      Every subject presented to a thoughtful audience must be supported by  rational proofs and logical arguments. Proofs are of four kinds: first,  through sense-perception; second, through the reasoning faculty; third,  from traditional or scriptural authority; fourth, through the medium of  inspiration. That is to say, there are four criterions or standards of  judgment by which the human mind reaches its conclusions. We will first  consider the criterion of the senses. This is a standard still held to by  the materialistic philosophers of the world. They believe that whatever is  perceptible to the senses is a verity, a certainty and without doubt  existent. For example, they say, \"Here is a lamp which you see, and  because it is perceptible to the sense of sight you cannot doubt its  existence. There is a tree; your sense of vision assures you of its  reality which is beyond question. This is a man; you see that he is a man;  therefore he exists.\" In a word, everything confirmed by the senses is  assumed to be as undoubted and unquestioned as the product of five  multiplied by five; it cannot be twenty-six nor less than twenty-five.  Consequently the materialistic philosophers consider the criterion of the  senses to be first and foremost.    But in the estimation of the divine philosophers this proof and assurance  is not reliable; nay, rather, they deem the standard of the senses to be  false because it is imperfect. Sight, for instance, is one of the most  important of the senses, yet it is subject to many aberrations and  inaccuracies. The eye sees the mirage as a body of water, regards images  in the mirror as realities when they are but reflections. A man sailing  upon the river imagines that"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19239"],[0,"Bahá'í World Faith (#20)"],[1,"contingent being is made up of different and numerous  elements and the existence of everything is a result of composition. That  is to say, when between simple elements a composition takes place a being  arises; the creation of beings comes about in this way. And when that  composition is upset, it is followed by decomposition, the elements  disintegrate, and that being becomes annihilated. That is to say, the  annihilation of everything consists in the decomposition and the  separation of elements. Therefore, every composition among the elements is  the cause of life, while dissociation and separation are the cause of  death. In short, attraction and harmony of things are the cause of the  production of fruits and useful results, while repulsion and inharmony of  things are the cause of disturbance and annihilation. From harmony and  attraction, all living contingent beings, such as plant, animal and man,  are realized, and from inharmony and repulsion decay sets in and  annihilation becomes manifest. Therefore whatever is the cause of harmony,  attraction and union among men is the life of the world of humanity, and  whatever is the cause of difference, of repulsion and of separation is the  cause of the death of mankind. And when you pass by a garden wherein  vegetable beds and plants, flowers and fragrant herbs are all combined so  as to form a harmonious whole, this is an evidence that this plantation  and this rose garden have been cultivated and arranged by the care of a  perfect gardener, while when you see a garden in disorder, lacking  arrangement and confused, this indicates that it has been deprived of the  care of a skillful gardener, nay, rather, it is nothing but a mass of  weeds. It has therefore been made evident that fellowship and harmony are  indicative of the training by the real Educator, while separation and  dispersion prove wildness and deprivation of Divine training.    Should any one object that, since the communities and nations and races  and peoples of the world have different formalities, customs, tastes,  temperaments, morals, varied thoughts, minds and opinions, it is therefore  impossible for ideal unity to be made manifest and complete union among  men to be realized, we say that differences are of two kinds: One leads to  destruction, and that is like the difference between warring peoples and  competing nations who destroy one another, uproot each other's families,  do away with rest and comfort and engage in bloodshed and rapacity. That  is blameworthy. But the other difference consists in variation. This is  perfection itself and the cause of the appearance of Divine bounty.  Consider the flowers of the rose garden. Although they are of different  kinds, various colors and diverse forms and appearances, yet as they drink  from one water, are swayed by one breeze and grow by the warmth and light  of one sun, this variation and this difference cause each to enhance the  beauty and splendor of the others. The differences in manners, in customs,  in habits, in thoughts, opinions and in temperaments is the cause of the  adornment of the world of mankind. This is praiseworthy. Likewise this  difference and this variation, like the difference and variation of the  parts and members of the human body, are the cause of the appearance of  beauty and perfection. As these different parts and members are under the  control of the dominant spirit, and the spirit permeates all the organs  and members, and rules all the arteries and veins, this difference and  this variation strengthen love and harmony and this multiplicity is the  greatest aid to unity. If in a garden the flowers and fragrant herbs, the  blossoms and fruits, the leaves, branches and trees are of one kind, of  one form, of one color and of one arrangement, there is no beauty or  sweetness, but when there is variety, each will contribute to the beauty  and charm of the others and will make an admirable garden, and will appear  in the utmost loveliness, freshness and sweetness. Likewise, when  difference and variety of thoughts, forms, opinions, characters and morals  of the world of mankind come under the control of one Supreme Power and  the influence of the Word of the One True God, they will appear and be  displayed in the most perfect glory, beauty, exaltation and perfection.  Today nothing but the power of the Word of God which encompasses the  realities of things can bring the thoughts, the minds, the hearts and the  spirits under the shade of one Tree. He is the potent in all things, the  vivifier of souls, the preserver and the controller of the world of  mankind. Praise be to God, in this day the light of the Word of God has  shone forth upon all regions, and from all sects, communities, nations,  tribes, peoples, religions and denominations, souls have gathered under  the shadow of the Word of Oneness and have in the most intimate fellowship  united and harmonized!            CHAPTER SEVEN: SOUL, MIND AND SPIRIT          THE ORIGIN OF MAN      Know that it is one of the most abstruse spiritual truths that the world  of existence, that is to say this endless universe, has no beginning.    We have already explained that the names and attributes of the Divinity  themselves require the existence of beings. Although this subject has been  explained in detail, we will speak of it again briefly. Know that an  educator without pupils cannot be imagined, a monarch without subjects  could not exist, a master without scholars cannot be appointed, a creator  without a creature is impossible, a provider without those provided for  cannot be conceived; for all the divine names and attributes demand the  existence of beings. If we could imagine a time when no beings existed,  this imagination would be the denial of the Divinity of God. Moreover,  absolute non-existence cannot become existence. If the beings were  absolutely non-existent, existence would not have come into being.  Therefore, as the Essence of Unity, that is the existence of God, is  everlasting and eternal--that is to say, it has neither beginning nor  end--it is certain that this world of existence, this endless universe, has  neither beginning nor end. Yes, it may be that one of the parts of the  universe, one of the globes, for example, may come into existence, or may  be disintegrated, but the other endless globes are still existing; the  universe would not be disordered nor destroyed; on the contrary, existence  is eternal and perpetual. As each globe has a beginning, necessarily it  has an end, because every composition, collective or particular, must of  necessity be decomposed; the only difference is that some are quickly  decomposed, and others more slowly, but it is impossible that a composed  thing should not eventually be decomposed.    It is necessary, therefore, that we should know what each of the important  existences was in the beginning--for there is no doubt that in the  beginning the origin was one: the origin of all numbers is one and not  two. Then it is evident that in the beginning matter was one, and that one  matter appeared in different aspects in each element; thus various forms  were produced, and these various aspects as they were produced became  permanent, and each element was specialized. But this permanence was not  definite, and did not attain realization and perfect existence until after  a very long time. Then these elements became composed, and organized and  combined in infinite forms; or rather from the composition and combination  of these elements innumerable beings appeared.    This composition and arrangement through the wisdom of God and His  pre-existent might, were produced from one natural organization, which was  composed and combined with the greatest strength, conformably to wisdom,  and according to a universal law. From this it is evident that it is the  creation of God, and is not a fortuitous composition and arrangement. This  is why from every natural composition a being can come into existence, but  from an accidental composition no being can come into existence. For  example, if a man of his own mind and intelligence collects some elements  and combines them, a living being will not be brought into existence,  since the system is unnatural. This is the answer to the implied question,  that, since beings are made by the composition and the combination of  elements, why is it not possible for us to gather elements and mingle them  together, and so create a living being. This is a false supposition, for  the origin of this composition is from God; it is God who makes the  combination, and as it is done according to the natural system, from each  composition one being is produced, and an existence is realized. A  composition made by man produces nothing, because man cannot create.    Briefly, we have said that from the composition and combination of  elements, from their decomposition, from their measure, and from the  effect of other beings upon them, resulted forms, endless realities, and  innumerable beings. But it is clear that this terrestrial globe in its  present form did not come into existence all at once; but that this  universal existence gradually passed through different phases until it  became adorned with its present perfection. Universal beings resemble and  can be compared to particular beings, for both are subjected to one  natural system, one universal law and divine organization. So you will  find the smallest atoms in the universal system are similar to the  greatest beings of the universe. It is clear that they come into existence  from one laboratory of might under one natural system, and one universal  law; therefore they may be compared to one another. Thus the embryo of man  in the womb of the mother gradually grows and develops, and appears in  different forms and conditions, until in the degree of perfect beauty it  reaches maturity, and appears in a perfect form with the "]]]
