I never doubted, for instance, the  existence of the Deity; that he made the world, and govern'd it by his  Providence; that the most acceptable service of God was the doing good  to man; that our souls are immortal; and that all crime will be  punished, and virtue rewarded, either here or hereafter. These I  esteem'd the essentials of every religion; and, being to be found in  all the religions we had in our country, I respected them all, tho'  with different degrees of respect, as I found them more or less mix'd  with other articles, which, without any tendency to inspire, promote,  or confirm morality, serv'd principally to divide us, and make us  unfriendly to one another. This respect to all, with an opinion that  the worst had some good effects, induc'd me to avoid all discourse  that might tend to lessen the good opinion another might have of his  own religion; and as our province increas'd in people, and new places  of worship were continually wanted, and generally erected by voluntary  contribution, my mite for such purpose, whatever might be the sect,  was never refused.    Tho' I seldom attended any public worship, I had still an opinion of  its propriety, and of its utility when rightly conducted, and I  regularly paid my annual subscription for the support of the only  Presbyterian minister or meeting we had in Philadelphia. He us'd to  visit me sometimes as a friend, and admonished me to attend his  administrations, and I was now and then prevail'd on to do so, once  for five Sundays successively. Had he been in my opinion a good  preacher, perhaps I might have continued,[65] notwithstanding the  occasion I had for the Sunday's leisure in my course of study; but his  discourses were chiefly either polemic arguments, or explications of  the peculiar doctrines of our sect, and were all to me very dry,  uninteresting, and unedifying, since not a single moral principle was  inculcated or enforc'd, their aim seeming to be rather to make us  Presbyterians than good citizens.        [65] Franklin expressed a different view about the duty      of attending church later.    At length he took for his text that verse of the fourth chapter of  Philippians, \"_Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, honest,  just, pure, lovely, or of good report, if there be any virtue, or any  praise, think on these things._\" And I imagin'd, in a sermon on such a  text, we could not miss of having some morality. But he confin'd  himself to five points only, as meant by the apostle, viz.: 1. Keeping  holy the Sabbath day. 2. Being diligent in reading the holy  Scriptures. 3. Attending duly the publick worship. 4. Partaking of the  Sacrament. 5. Paying a due respect to God's ministers. These might be  all good things; but, as they were not the kind of good things that I  expected from that text, I despaired of ever meeting with them from  any other, was disgusted, and attended his preaching no more. I had  some years before compos'd a little Liturgy, or form of prayer, for my  own private use (viz., in 1728), entitled, _Articles of Belief and  Acts of Religion_. I return'd to the use of this, and went no more to  the public assemblies. My conduct might be blameable, but I leave it,  without attempting further to excuse it; my present purpose being to  relate facts, and not to make apologies for them.          IX    PLAN FOR ATTAINING MORAL  PERFECTION      It was about this time I conceived the bold and arduous project of  arriving at moral perfection. I wish'd to live without committing any  fault at any time; I would conquer all that either natural  inclination, custom, or company might lead me into. As I knew, or  thought I knew, what was right and wrong, I did not see why I might  not always do the one and avoid the other. But I soon found I had  undertaken a task of more difficulty than I had imagined.[66] While my  care was employ'd in guarding against one fault, I was often surprised  by another; habit took the advantage of inattention; inclination was  sometimes too strong for reason. I concluded, at length, that the mere  speculative conviction that it was our interest to be completely  virtuous, was not sufficient to prevent our slipping; and that the  contrary habits must be broken, and good ones acquired and  established, before we can have any dependence on a steady, uniform  rectitude of conduct. For this purpose I therefore contrived the  following method.        [66] Compare Philippians iv, 8.    In the various enumerations of the moral virtues I had met with in my  reading, I found the catalogue more or less numerous, as different  writers included more or fewer ideas under the same name. Temperance,  for example, was by some confined to eating and drinking, while by  others it was extended to mean the moderating every other pleasure,  appetite, inclination, or passion, bodily or mental, even to our  avarice and ambition. I propos'd to myself, for the sake of clearness,  to use rather more names, with fewer ideas annex'd to each, than a few  names with more ideas; and I included under thirteen names of virtues  all that at that time occurr'd to me as necessary or desirable, and  annexed to each a short precept, which fully express'd the extent I  gave to its meaning.    These names of virtues, with their precepts, were:    1. Temperance.    Eat not to dullness; drink not to elevation.    2. Silence.    Speak not but what may benefit others or yourself; avoid trifling  conversation.    3. Order.    Let all your things have their places; let each part of your business  have its time.    4. Resolution.    Resolve to perform what you ought; perform without fail what you  resolve.    5. Frugality.    Make no expense but to do good to others or yourself; _i. e._, waste  nothing.    6. INDUSTRY.    Lose no time; be always employ'd in something useful; cut off all  unnecessary actions.    7. Sincerity.    Use no hurtful deceit; think innocently and justly; and, if you speak,  speak accordingly.    8. Justice.    Wrong none by doing injuries, or omitting the benefits that are your  duty.    9. Moderation.    Avoid extreams; forbear resenting injuries so much as you think they  deserve.    10. Cleanliness.    Tolerate no uncleanliness in body, cloaths, or habitation.    11. Tranquillity.    Be not disturbed at trifles, or at accidents common or unavoidable.    12. Chastity.    13. Humility.    Imitate Jesus and Socrates.    My intention being to acquire the _habitude_ of all these virtues, I  judg'd it would be well not to distract my attention by attempting the  whole at once, but to fix it on one of them at a time; and, when I  should be master of that, then to proceed to another, and so on, till  I should have gone thro' the thirteen; and, as the previous  acquisition of some might facilitate the acquisition of certain  others, I arrang'd them with that view, as they stand above.  Temperance first, as it tends to procure that coolness and clearness  of head, which is so necessary where constant vigilance was to be kept  up, and guard maintained against the unremitting attraction of ancient  habits, and the force of perpetual temptations. This being acquir'd  and establish'd, Silence would be more easy; and my desire being to  gain knowledge at the same time that I improv'd in virtue, and  considering that in conversation it was obtain'd rather by the use of  the ears than of the tongue, and therefore wishing to break a habit I  was getting into of prattling, punning, and joking, which only made me  acceptable to trifling company, I gave _Silence_ the second place.  This and the next, _Order_, I expected would allow me more time for  attending to my project and my studies. _Resolution_, once become  habitual, would keep me firm in my endeavours to obtain all the  subsequent virtues; _Frugality_ and Industry freeing me from my  remaining debt, and producing affluence and independence, would make  more easy the practice of Sincerity and Justice, etc., etc. Conceiving  then, that, agreeably to the advice of Pythagoras[67] in his Golden  Verses, daily examination would be necessary, I contrived the  following method for conducting that examination.    I made a little book, in which I allotted a page for each of the  virtues.[68] I rul'd each page with red ink, so as to have seven  columns, one for each day of the week, marking each column with a  letter for the day. I cross'd these columns with thirteen red lines,  marking the beginning of each line with the first letter of one of the  virtues, on which line, and in its proper column, I might mark, by a  little black spot, every fault I found upon examination to have been  committed respecting that virtue upon that day.        [67] A famous Greek philosopher, who lived about 582-500      B. C. The _Golden Verses_ here ascribed to him are      probably of later origin. \"The time which he recommends      for this work is about even or bed-time, that we may      conclude the action of the day with the judgment of      conscience, making the examination of our conversation      an evening song to God.\"        [68] This \"little book\" is dated July 1, 1733.--W.

A fortnight of travel passes more quickly  than a fortnight of illness, but yields many more events for the memory  to review as the \"filling\" for time.    Probably no one has any very accurate feeling of the length, that is,  the actual _duration_ of a year--or even of a month! We therefore divide  time into convenient units, as weeks, months, years and centuries. This  allows us to think of time in mathematical terms where immediate  perception fails in its grasp.      5. THE TRAINING OF PERCEPTION    In the physical world as in the spiritual there are many people who,  \"having eyes, see not and ears, hear not.\" For the ability to perceive  accurately and richly in the world of physical objects depends not alone  on good sense organs, but also on _interest_ and the habit of  _observation_. It is easy if we are indifferent or untrained to look at  a beautiful landscape, a picture or a cathedral without _seeing_ it; it  is easy if we lack interest or skill to listen to an orchestra or the  myriad sounds of nature without _hearing_ them.    PERCEPTION NEEDS TO BE TRAINED.--Training in perception does not depend  entirely on the work of the school. For the world about us exerts a  constant appeal to our senses. A thousand sights, sounds, contacts,  tastes, smells or other sensations, hourly throng in upon us, and the  appeal is irresistible. We must in some degree attend. We must observe.    Yet it cannot be denied that most of us are relatively unskilled in  perception; we do not know how, or take the trouble to observe. For  example, a stranger was brought into the classroom and introduced by the  instructor to a class of fifty college students in psychology. The class  thought the stranger was to address them, and looked at him with mild  curiosity. But, after standing before them for a few moments, he  suddenly withdrew, as had been arranged by the instructor. The class  were then asked to write such a description of the stranger as would  enable a person who had never seen him to identify him. But so poor had  been the observation of the class that they ascribed to him clothes of  four different colors, eyes and hair each of three different colors, a  tie of many different hues, height ranging from five feet and four  inches to over six feet, age from twenty-eight to forty-five years, and  many other details as wide of the mark. Nor is it probable that this  particular class was below the average in the power of perception.    SCHOOL TRAINING IN PERCEPTION.--The school can do much in training the  perception. But to accomplish this, the child must constantly be brought  into immediate contact with the physical world about him and taught to  observe. Books must not be substituted for things. Definitions must not  take the place of experiment or discovery. Geography and nature study  should be taught largely out of doors, and the lessons assigned should  take the child into the open for observation and investigation. All  things that live and grow, the sky and clouds, the sunset colors, the  brown of upturned soil, the smell of the clover field, or the new mown  hay, the sounds of a summer night, the distinguishing marks by which to  identify each family of common birds or breed of cattle--these and a  thousand other things that appeal to us from the simplest environment  afford a rich opportunity for training the perception. And he who has  learned to observe, and who is alert to the appeal of nature, has no  small part of his education already assured.      6. PROBLEMS IN OBSERVATION AND INTROSPECTION    1. Test your power of observation by walking rapidly past a well-filled  store window and then seeing how many of the objects you can name.    2. Suppose a tailor, a bootblack, a physician, and a detective are  standing on the street corner as you pass by. What will each one be most  likely to observe about you? _Why?_    3. Observe carefully green trees at a distance of a few rods; a quarter  of a mile; a mile; several miles. Describe differences (1) in color, (2)  in brightness, or light, and (3) in detail.    4. How many common birds can you identify? How many kinds of trees? Of  wild flowers? Of weeds?    5. Observe the work of an elementary school for the purpose of  determining:    a. Whether the instruction in geography, nature study, agriculture,  etc., calls for the use of the eyes, ears and fingers.    b. Whether definitions are used in place of first-hand information in  any subjects.    c. Whether the assignment of lessons to pupils includes work that would  require the use of the senses, especially out of doors.    d. Whether the work offered in arithmetic demands the use of the senses  as well as the reason.    e. Whether the language lessons make use of the power of observation.          CHAPTER VIII    MENTAL IMAGES AND IDEAS      As you sit thinking, a company of you together, your thoughts run in  many diverse lines. Yet with all this diversity, your minds possess this  common characteristic: _Though your thinking all takes place in what we  call the present moment, it goes on largely in terms of past  experiences._      1. THE PART PLAYED BY PAST EXPERIENCE    PRESENT THINKING DEPENDS ON PAST EXPERIENCE.--Images or ideas of things  you have seen or heard or felt; of things you have thought of before and  which now recur to you; of things you remember, such as names, dates,  places, events; of things that you do not remember as a part of your  past at all, but that belong to it nevertheless--these are the things  which form a large part of your mental stream, and which give content to  your thinking. You may think of a thing that is going on now, or of one  that is to occur in the future; but, after all, you are dependent on  your past experience for the material which you put into your thinking  of the present moment.    Indeed, nothing can enter your present thinking which does not link  itself to something in your past experience. The savage Indian in the  primeval forest never thought about killing a deer with a rifle merely  by pulling a trigger, or of turning a battery of machine guns on his  enemies to annihilate them--none of these things were related to his  past experience; hence he could not think in such terms.    THE PRESENT INTERPRETED BY THE PAST.--Not only can we not think at all  except in terms of our past experience, but even if we could, the  present would be meaningless to us; for the present is interpreted in  the light of the past. The sedate man of affairs who decries athletic  sports, and has never taken part in them, cannot understand the wild  enthusiasm which prevails between rival teams in a hotly contested  event. The fine work of art is to the one who has never experienced the  appeal which comes through beauty, only so much of canvas and variegated  patches of color. Paul says that Jesus was \"unto the Greeks,  foolishness.\" He was foolishness to them because nothing in their  experience with their own gods had been enough like the character of  Jesus to enable them to interpret Him.    THE FUTURE ALSO DEPENDS ON THE PAST.--To the mind incapable of using  past experience, the future also would be impossible; for we can look  forward into the future only by placing in its experiences the elements  of which we have already known. The savage who has never seen the  shining yellow metal does not dream of a heaven whose streets are paved  with gold, but rather of a \"happy hunting ground.\" If you will analyze  your own dreams of the future you will see in them familiar pictures  perhaps grouped together in new forms, but coming, in their elements,  from your past experience nevertheless. All that would remain to a mind  devoid of a past would be the little bridge of time which we call the  \"present moment,\" a series of unconnected _nows_. Thought would be  impossible, for the mind would have nothing to compare and relate.  Personality would not exist; for personality requires continuity of  experience, else we should be a new person each succeeding moment,  without memory and without plans. Such a mind would be no mind at all.    RANK DETERMINED BY ABILITY TO UTILIZE PAST EXPERIENCE.--So important is  past experience in determining our present thinking and guiding our  future actions, that the place of an individual in the scale of creation  is determined largely by the ability to profit by past experience. The  scientist tells us of many species of animals now extinct, which lost  their lives and suffered their race to die out because when, long ago,  the climate began to change and grow much colder, they were unable to  use the experience of suffering in the last cold season as an incentive  to provide shelter, or move to a warmer climate against the coming of  the next and more rigorous one. Man was able to make the adjustment;  and, providing himself with clothing and shelter and food, he survived,  while myriads of the lower forms perished.    The singed moth again and again dares the flame which tortures it, and  at last gives its life, a sacrifice to its folly; the burned child fears  the fire, and does not the second time seek the experience. So also can  the efficiency of an individual or a nation, as compared with other  individuals or nations, be determined. The inefficient are those who  repeat the same error or useless act over and over, or else fail to  repeat a chance useful act whose repetition might lead to success. They  are unable to learn their lesson and be guided by experience. Their past  does not sufficiently minister to their present, and through it direct  their future.      2. HOW PAST EXPERIENCE IS CONSERVED    PAST EXPERIENCE CONSERVED IN BOTH MENTAL AND PHYSICAL TERMS.--If past  experience plays so important a part in our welfare, how, then, is it to  be conserved so that we may secure its benefits? Here, as elsewhere, we  find the"]]]
