The Baba Yaga gave    him food and drink, and bid him set about his business. But the    moment he had driven the mares afield, they cocked up their    tails, and away they tore across the meadows in all directions.    Before the Prince had time to look round, they were all out of    sight. Thereupon he began to weep and to disquiet himself, and    then he sat down upon a stone and went to sleep. But when the    sun was near its setting, the outlandish bird came flying up to him,    and awakened him saying:--      \"Arise, Prince Ivan! the mares are at home now.\"      The Prince arose and returned home. There the Baba Yaga    was storming and raging at her mares, and shrieking:--      \"Whatever did ye come home for?\"      \"How could we help coming home?\" said they. \"There    came flying birds from every part of the world, and all but pecked    our eyes out.\"      \"Well, well! to-morrow don't go galloping over the meadows,    but disperse amid the thick forests.\"      Prince Ivan slept all night. In the morning the Baba Yaga    says to him:--      \"Mind, Prince! if you don't take good care of the mares, if    you lose merely one of them--your bold head will be stuck on    that pole!\"      He drove the mares afield. Immediately they cocked up their    tails and dispersed among the thick forests. Again did the    Prince sit down on the stone, weep and weep, and then go to    sleep. The sun went down behind the forest. Up came running    the lioness.      \"Arise, Prince Ivan! The mares are all collected.\"      Prince Ivan arose and went home. More than ever did the    Baba Yaga storm at her mares and shriek:--      \"Whatever did ye come back home for?\"      \"How could we help coming back? Beasts of prey came    running at us from all parts of the world, all but tore us utterly    to pieces.\"      \"Well, to-morrow run off into the blue sea.\"      Again did Prince Ivan sleep through the night. Next morning    the Baba Yaga sent him forth to watch the mares:      \"If you don't take good care of them,\" says she, \"your bold    head will be stuck on that pole!\"      He drove the mares afield. Immediately they cocked up    their tails, disappeared from sight, and fled into the blue sea.    There they stood, up to their necks in water. Prince Ivan sat    down on the stone, wept, and fell asleep. But when the sun had    set behind the forest, up came flying a bee and said:--      \"Arise, Prince! The mares are all collected. But when    you get home, don't let the Baba Yaga set eyes on you, but go    into the stable and hide behind the mangers. There you will    find a sorry colt rolling in the muck. Do you steal it, and at    the dead of night ride away from the house.\"      Prince Ivan arose, slipped into the stable, and lay down behind    the mangers, while the Baba Yaga was storming away at    her mares and shrieking:--      \"Why did ye come back?\"      \"How could we help coming back? There came flying bees    in countless numbers from all parts of the world, and began    stinging us on all sides till the blood came!\"      The Baba Yaga went to sleep. In the dead of the night    Prince Ivan stole the sorry colt, saddled it, jumped on its back,    and galloped away to the fiery river. When he came to that river    he waved the handkerchief three times on the right hand, and    suddenly, springing goodness knows whence, there hung across    the river, high in the air, a splendid bridge. The Prince rode    across the bridge and waved the handkerchief twice only on the    left hand; there remained across the river a thin--ever so thin    a bridge!      When the Baba Yaga got up in the morning, the sorry colt    was not to be seen! Off she set in pursuit. At full speed did    she fly in her iron mortar, urging it on with the pestle, sweeping    away her traces with the broom. She dashed up to the fiery    river, gave a glance, and said, \"A capital bridge!\" She drove    on to the bridge, but had only got half-way when the bridge    broke in two, and the Baba Yaga went flop into the river. There    truly did she meet with a cruel death!      Prince Ivan fattened up the colt in the green meadows, and    it turned into a wondrous steed. Then he rode to where Marya    Morevna was. She came running out, and flung herself on his    neck, crying:--      \"By what means has God brought you back to life?\"      \"Thus and thus,\" says he. \"Now come along with me.\"      \"I am afraid, Prince Ivan! If Koshchei catches us, you will    be cut in pieces again.\"      \"No, he won't catch us! I have a splendid heroic steed now;    it flies just like a bird.\" So they got on its back and rode    away.      Koshchei the Deathless was returning home when his horse    stumbled beneath him.      \"What art thou stumbling for, sorry jade? dost thou scent    any ill?\"      \"Prince Ivan has come and carried off Marya Morevna.\"      \"Can we catch them?\"      \"God knows! Prince Ivan has a horse now which is better    than I.\"      \"Well, I can't stand it,\" says Koshchei the Deathless. \"I    will pursue.\"      After a time he came up with Prince Ivan, lighted on the    ground, and was going to chop him up with his sharp sword.    But at that moment Prince Ivan's horse smote Koshchei the    Deathless full swing with its hoof, and cracked his skull, and the    Prince made an end of him with a club. Afterwards the Prince    heaped up a pile of wood, set fire to it, burnt Koshchei the    Deathless on the pyre, and scattered his ashes to the wind.    Then Marya Morevna mounted Koshchei's horse and Prince Ivan    got on his own, and they rode away to visit first the Raven, and    then the Eagle, and then the Falcon. Wherever they went they    met with a joyful greeting.      \"Ah, Prince Ivan! why, we never expected to see you again.    Well, it wasn't for nothing that you gave yourself so much trouble.    Such a beauty as Marya Morevna one might search for all the    world over--and never find one like her!\"      And so they visited, and they feasted; and afterwards they    went off to their own realm.[104]    With the Baba Yaga, the feminine counterpart of Koshchei and the  Snake, we shall deal presently, and the Waters of Life and Death will  find special notice elsewhere.[105] A magic water, which brings back  the dead to life, plays a prominent part in the folk-lore of all  lands, but the two waters, each performing one part only of the cure,  render very noteworthy the Slavonic stories in which they occur. The  Princess, Marya Morevna, who slaughters whole armies before she is  married, and then becomes mild and gentle, belongs to a class of  heroines who frequently occur both in the stories and in the \"metrical  romances,\" and to whom may be applied the remarks made by Kemble with  reference to a similar Amazon.[106] In one of the variants of the  story the representative of Marya Morevna fights the hero before she  marries him.[107] The Bluebeard incident of the forbidden closet is  one which often occurs in the Skazkas, as we shall see further on; and  the same may be said about the gratitude of the Bird, Bee, and  Lioness.    The story of Immortal Koshchei is one of very frequent occurrence,  the different versions maintaining a unity of idea, but varying  considerably in detail. In one of them,[108] in which Koshchei's part  is played by a Snake, the hero's sisters are carried off by their  feathered admirers without his leave being asked--an omission for  which a full apology is afterwards made; in another, the history of  \"Fedor Tugarin and Anastasia the Fair,\"[109] the hero's three sisters  are wooed and won, not by the Falcon, the Eagle, and the Raven, but by  the Wind, the Hail, and the Thunder. He himself marries the terrible  heroine Anastasia the Fair, in the forbidden chamber of whose palace  he finds a snake \"hung up by one of its ribs.\" He gives it a lift and  it gets free from its hook and flies away, carrying off Anastasia the  Fair. Fedor eventually finds her, escapes with her on a magic foal  which he obtains, thanks to the aid of grateful wolves, bees, and  crayfish, and destroys the snake by striking it \"on the forehead\" with  the stone which was destined to be its death. In a third version of  the story,[110] the hero finds in the forbidden chamber \"Koshchei the  Deathless, in a cauldron amid flames, boiling in pitch.\" There he has  been, he declares, for fifteen years, having been lured there by the  beauty of Anastasia the Fair. In a fourth,[111] in which the hero's  three sisters marry three beggars, who turn out to be snakes with  twenty, thirty, and forty heads apiece, Koshchei is found in the  forbidden chamber, seated on a horse which is chained to a cauldron.  He begs the hero to unloose the horse, promising, in return, to save  him from three deaths.          [Into the mystery of the forbidden chamber I will not        enter fully at present. Suffice to say that there can        be little doubt as to its being the same as that in        which Bluebeard kept the corpses of his dead wives. In        the Russian, as well as in the Oriental stories, it is        generally the curiosity of a man, not of a woman,        which leads to the opening of the prohibited room. In        the West of Europe the fatal inquisitiveness is more        frequently ascribed to a woman. For parallels see the        German stories of \"Marienkind,\" and \"Fitchers Vogel.\"        (Grimm, _KM._, Nos. 3 and 46, also the notes in Bd.        iii. pp. 8, 76, 324.) Less familiar than these is,        probably, the story of \"Die eisernen Stiefel\" (Wolf's        \"Deutsche Hausmaerchen,\" 1851, No. 19), in which the        hero opens a forbidden door--that of a        summer-house--and sees \"deep down below him the earth,        and on the earth his father's palace,\" and is seized        by a sudden longing after his former home. The        Wallachian story of \"The Immured Mother\" (Schott, No.        2) resembles Grimm's \"Mar"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22381"],[0,"Myths and Legends of Ancient Greece and Rome (#20)"],[1,"merely an importation from Greece, which never at any  time took firm root in Rome, nor entered largely into the actual life and  sympathies of the nation, his worship being unattended by the devotional  feeling and enthusiasm which characterized the religious rites of the other  deities. He still, however, retained in Rome his {101} Greek attributes as  god of fire, and unrivalled master of the art of working in metals, and was  ranked among the twelve great gods of Olympus, whose gilded statues were  arranged consecutively along the Forum. His Roman name, Vulcan, would seem  to indicate a connection with the first great metal-working artificer of  Biblical history, Tubal-Cain.    POSEIDON (NEPTUNE).    Poseidon was the son of Kronos and Rhea, and the brother of Zeus. He was  god of the sea, more particularly of the Mediterranean, and, like the  element over which he presided, was of a variable disposition, now  violently agitated, and now calm and placid, for which reason he is  sometimes represented by the poets as quiet and composed, and at others as  disturbed and angry.    [Illustration]    In the earliest ages of Greek mythology, he merely symbolized the watery  element; but in later times, as navigation and intercourse with other  nations engendered greater traffic by sea, Poseidon gained in importance,  and came to be regarded as a distinct divinity, holding indisputable  dominion over the sea, and over all sea-divinities, who acknowledged him as  their sovereign ruler. He possessed the power of causing at will, mighty  and destructive tempests, in which the billows rise mountains high, the  wind becomes a hurricane, land and sea being enveloped in thick mists,  whilst destruction assails the unfortunate mariners exposed to their fury.  On the other hand, his alone was the power of stilling the angry {102}  waves, of soothing the troubled waters, and granting safe voyages to  mariners. For this reason, Poseidon was always invoked and propitiated by a  libation before a voyage was undertaken, and sacrifices and thanksgivings  were gratefully offered to him after a safe and prosperous journey by sea.    The symbol of his power was the fisherman's fork or trident,[37] by means  of which he produced earthquakes, raised up islands from the bottom of the  sea, and caused wells to spring forth out of the earth.    Poseidon was essentially the presiding deity over fishermen, and was on  that account, more particularly worshipped and revered in countries  bordering on the sea-coast, where fish naturally formed a staple commodity  of trade. He was supposed to vent his displeasure by sending disastrous  inundations, which completely destroyed whole countries, and were usually  accompanied by terrible marine monsters, who swallowed up and devoured  those whom the floods had spared. It is probable that these sea-monsters  are the poetical figures which represent the demons of hunger and famine,  necessarily accompanying a general inundation.    Poseidon is generally represented as resembling his brother Zeus in  features, height, and general aspect; but we miss in the countenance of the  sea-god the kindness and benignity which so pleasingly distinguish his  mighty brother. The eyes are bright and piercing, and the contour of the  face somewhat sharper in its outline than that of Zeus, thus corresponding,  as it were, with his more angry and violent nature. His hair waves in dark,  disorderly masses over his shoulders; his chest is broad, and his frame  powerful and stalwart; he wears a short, curling beard, and a band round  his head. He usually appears standing erect in a graceful shell-chariot,  drawn by hippocamps, or sea-horses, with golden manes and brazen hoofs, who  bound over the dancing waves with such wonderful swiftness, that the  chariot scarcely touches {103} the water. The monsters of the deep,  acknowledging their mighty lord, gambol playfully around him, whilst the  sea joyfully smooths a path for the passage of its all-powerful ruler.    [Illustration]    He inhabited a beautiful palace at the bottom of the sea at AEgea in Euboea,  and also possessed a royal residence on Mount Olympus, which, however, he  only visited when his presence was required at the council of the gods.    His wonderful palace beneath the waters was of vast extent; in its lofty  and capacious halls thousands of his followers could assemble. The exterior  of the building was of bright gold, which the continual wash of the waters  preserved untarnished; in the interior, lofty and graceful columns  supported the gleaming dome. Everywhere fountains of glistening, silvery  water played; everywhere groves and arbours of feathery-leaved sea-plants  appeared, whilst rocks of pure crystal glistened with all the varied  colours of the rainbow. Some of the paths were strewn with white sparkling  sand, interspersed with jewels, pearls, and amber. This delightful abode  was surrounded on all sides by wide fields, where there were whole groves  of dark purple coralline, and tufts of beautiful scarlet-leaved plants, and  sea-anemones of every tint. Here grew bright, pinky sea-weeds, mosses of  all hues and shades, and tall grasses, which, growing upwards, formed  emerald caves and grottoes such as the Nereides love, whilst fish of  various kinds playfully darted in and out, in the full enjoyment of their  native element. Nor was illumination wanting in this fairy-like region,  which at night was lit up by the glow-worms of the deep.    But although Poseidon ruled with absolute power over the ocean and its  inhabitants, he nevertheless bowed submissively to the will of the great  ruler of Olympus, and appeared at all times desirous of conciliating him.  We {104} find him coming to his aid when emergency demanded, and frequently  rendering him valuable assistance against his opponents. At the time when  Zeus was harassed by the attacks of the Giants, he proved himself a most  powerful ally, engaging in single combat with a hideous giant named  Polybotes, whom he followed over the sea, and at last succeeded in  destroying, by hurling upon him the island of Cos.    These amicable relations between the brothers were, however, sometimes  interrupted. Thus, for instance, upon one occasion Poseidon joined Hera and  Athene in a secret conspiracy to seize upon the ruler of heaven, place him  in fetters, and deprive him of the sovereign power. The conspiracy being  discovered, Hera, as the chief instigator of this sacrilegious attempt on  the divine person of Zeus, was severely chastised, and even beaten, by her  enraged spouse, as a punishment for her rebellion and treachery, whilst  Poseidon was condemned, for the space of a whole year, to forego his  dominion over the sea, and it was at this time that, in conjunction with  Apollo, he built for Laomedon the walls of Troy.    Poseidon married a sea-nymph named Amphitrite, whom he wooed under the form  of a dolphin. She afterwards became jealous of a beautiful maiden called  Scylla, who was beloved by Poseidon, and in order to revenge herself she  threw some herbs into a well where Scylla was bathing, which had the effect  of metamorphosing her into a monster of terrible aspect, having twelve  feet, six heads with six long necks, and a voice which resembled the bark  of a dog. This awful monster is said to have inhabited a cave at a very  great height in the famous rock which still bears her name,[38] and was  supposed to swoop down from her rocky eminence upon every ship that passed,  and with each of her six heads to secure a victim.    Amphitrite is often represented assisting Poseidon in attaching the  sea-horses to his chariot.    {105}    The Cyclops, who have been already alluded to in the history of Cronus,  were the sons of Poseidon and Amphitrite. They were a wild race of gigantic  growth, similar in their nature to the earth-born Giants, and had only one  eye each in the middle of their foreheads. They led a lawless life,  possessing neither social manners nor fear of the gods, and were the  workmen of Hephaestus, whose workshop was supposed to be in the heart of the  volcanic mountain AEtna.    Here we have another striking instance of the manner in which the Greeks  personified the powers of nature, which they saw in active operation around  them. They beheld with awe, mingled with astonishment, the fire, stones,  and ashes which poured forth from the summit of this and other volcanic  mountains, and, with their vivacity of imagination, found a solution of the  mystery in the supposition, that the god of Fire must be busy at work with  his men in the depths of the earth, and that the mighty flames which they  beheld, issued in this manner from his subterranean forge.    The chief representative of the Cyclops was the man-eating monster  Polyphemus, described by Homer as having been blinded and outwitted at last  by Odysseus. This monster fell in love with a beautiful nymph called  Galatea; but, as may be supposed, his addresses were not acceptable to the  fair maiden, who rejected them in favour of a youth named Acis, upon which  Polyphemus, with his usual barbarity, destroyed the life of his rival by  throwing upon him a gigantic rock. The blood of the murdered Acis, gushing  out of the rock, formed a stream which still bears his name.    Triton, Rhoda,[39] and Benthesicyme were also children of Poseidon and  Amphitrite.    The sea-god was the father of two giant sons called Otus and Ephialtes.[40]  When only nine years old they {106} were said to be twenty-seven cubits[41]  in height and nine in breadth. These youthful giants were as rebellious as  they were powerful, even presuming to threaten the gods themselves with  hostilities. During the war of the Gigantomachia, they endeavoured to scale  heaven by piling mighty mountains one upon another. Already had they  succeeded in placing Mount Ossa on Olympus and Pelion on Ossa, when this  impious project was frustrated by Apollo,"]]]
