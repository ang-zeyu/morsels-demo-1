[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19275"],[0,"God Passes By (#20)"],[1,"recorded in both the Qayyumu'l-Asma and the Bayan, designed  to be respectively the first and last written testimonials to the glory  with which God was soon to invest Him. It was He Who, through His  correspondence with the Author of the newly founded Faith, and His  intimate association with the most distinguished amongst its disciples,  such as Vahid, Hujjat, Quddus, Mulla Husayn and Tahirih, was able to  foster its growth, elucidate its principles, reinforce its ethical  foundations, fulfill its urgent requirements, avert some of the immediate  dangers threatening it and participate effectually in its rise and  consolidation. It was to Him, \"the one Object of our adoration and love\"  that the Prophet-pilgrim, on His return to Bu_sh_ihr, alluded when,  dismissing Quddus from His presence, He announced to him the double joy of  attaining the presence of their Beloved and of quaffing the cup of  martyrdom. He it was Who, in the hey-day of His life, flinging aside every  consideration of earthly fame, wealth and position, careless of danger,  and risking the obloquy of His caste, arose to identify Himself, first in  Tihran and later in His native province of Mazindaran, with the cause of  an obscure and proscribed sect; won to its support a large number of the  officials and notables of Nur, not excluding His own associates and  relatives; fearlessly and persuasively expounded its truths to the  disciples of the illustrious mujtahid, Mulla Muhammad; enlisted under its  banner the mujtahid's appointed representatives; secured, in consequence  of this act, the unreserved loyalty of a considerable number of  ecclesiastical dignitaries, government officers, peasants and traders; and  succeeded in challenging, in the course of a memorable interview, the  mujtahid himself. It was solely due to the potency of the written message  entrusted by Him to Mulla Muhammad Mihdiy-i-Kandi and delivered to the Bab  while in the neighborhood of the village of Kulayn, that the soul of the  disappointed Captive was able to rid itself, at an hour of uncertainty and  suspense, of the anguish that had settled upon it ever since His arrest in  _Sh_iraz. He it was Who, for the sake of Tahirih and her imprisoned  companions, willingly submitted Himself to a humiliating confinement,  lasting several days--the first He was made to suffer--in the house of one  of the kad-_kh_udas of Tihran. It was to His caution, foresight and  ability that must be ascribed her successful escape from Qazvin, her  deliverance from her opponents, her safe arrival in His home, and her  subsequent removal to a place of safety in the vicinity of the capital  from whence she proceeded to _Kh_urasan. It was into His presence that  Mulla Husayn was secretly ushered upon his arrival in Tihran, after which  interview he traveled to A_dh_irbayjan on his visit to the Bab then  confined in the fortress of Mah-Ku. He it was Who unobtrusively and  unerringly directed the proceedings of the Conference of Bada_sh_t; Who  entertained as His guests Quddus, Tahirih and the eighty-one disciples who  had gathered on that occasion; Who revealed every day a Tablet and  bestowed on each of the participants a new name; Who faced unaided the  assault of a mob of more than five hundred villagers in Niyala; Who  shielded Quddus from the fury of his assailants; Who succeeded in  restoring a part of the property which the enemy had plundered and Who  insured the protection and safety of the continually harassed and much  abused Tahirih. Against Him was kindled the anger of Muhammad _Sh_ah who,  as a result of the persistent representations of mischief-makers, was at  last induced to order His arrest and summon Him to the capital--a summons  that was destined to remain unfulfilled as a result of the sudden death of  the sovereign. It was to His counsels and exhortations, addressed to the  occupants of _Sh_ay_kh_ Tabarsi, who had welcomed Him with such reverence  and love during His visit to that Fort, that must be attributed, in no  small measure, the spirit evinced by its heroic defenders, while it was to  His explicit instructions that they owed the miraculous release of Quddus  and his consequent association with them in the stirring exploits that  have immortalized the Mazindaran upheaval. It was for the sake of those  same defenders, whom He had intended to join, that He suffered His second  imprisonment, this time in the masjid of Amul to which He was led, amidst  the tumult raised by no less than four thousand spectators,--for their sake  that He was bastinadoed in the namaz-_kh_anih of the mujtahid of that town  until His feet bled, and later confined in the private residence of its  governor; for their sake that He was bitterly denounced by the leading  mulla, and insulted by the mob who, besieging the governor's residence,  pelted Him with stones, and hurled in His face the foulest invectives. He  alone was the One alluded to by Quddus who, upon his arrival at the Fort  of _Sh_ay_kh_ Tabarsi, uttered, as soon as he had dismounted and leaned  against the shrine, the prophetic verse \"The Baqiyyatu'llah (the Remnant  of God) will be best for you if ye are of those who believe.\" He alone was  the Object of that prodigious eulogy, that masterly interpretation of the  Sad of Samad, penned in part, in that same Fort by that same youthful  hero, under the most distressing circumstances, and equivalent in  dimensions to six times the volume of the Qur'an. It was to the date of  His impending Revelation that the Lawh-i-Hurufat, revealed in _Ch_ihriq by  the Bab, in honor of Dayyan, abstrusely alluded, and in which the mystery  of the \"Musta_gh_a_th_\" was unraveled. It was to the attainment of His  presence that the attention of another disciple, Mulla Baqir, one of the  Letters of the Living, was expressly directed by none other than the Bab  Himself. It was exclusively to His care that the documents of the Bab, His  pen-case, His seals, and agate rings, together with a scroll on which He  had penned, in the form of a pentacle, no less than three hundred and  sixty derivatives of the word Baha, were delivered, in conformity with  instructions He Himself had issued prior to His departure from _Ch_ihriq.  It was solely due to His initiative, and in strict accordance with His  instructions, that the precious remains of the Bab were safely transferred  from Tabriz to the capital, and were concealed and safeguarded with the  utmost secrecy and care throughout the turbulent years following His  martyrdom. And finally, it was He Who, in the days preceding the attempt  on the life of the _Sh_ah, had been instrumental, while sojourning in  Karbila, in spreading, with that same enthusiasm and ability that had  distinguished His earlier exertions in Mazindaran, the teachings of His  departed Leader, in safeguarding the interests of His Faith, in reviving  the zeal of its grief-stricken followers, and in organizing the forces of  its scattered and bewildered adherents.    Such a man, with such a record of achievements to His credit, could not,  indeed did not, escape either the detection or the fury of a vigilant and  fully aroused enemy. Afire from the very beginning with an uncontrollable  enthusiasm for the Cause He had espoused; conspicuously fearless in His  advocacy of the rights of the downtrodden; in the full bloom of youth;  immensely resourceful; matchless in His eloquence; endowed with  inexhaustible energy and penetrating judgment; possessed of the riches,  and enjoying, in full measure, the esteem, power and prestige associated  with an enviably high and noble position, and yet contemptuous of all  earthly pomp, rewards, vanities and possessions; closely associated, on  the one hand, through His regular correspondence with the Author of the  Faith He had risen to champion, and intimately acquainted, on the other,  with the hopes and fears, the plans and activities of its leading  exponents; at one time advancing openly and assuming a position of  acknowledged leadership in the forefront of the forces struggling for that  Faith's emancipation, at another deliberately drawing back with consummate  discretion in order to remedy, with greater efficacy, an awkward or  dangerous situation; at all times vigilant, ready and indefatigable in His  exertions to preserve the integrity of that Faith, to resolve its  problems, to plead its cause, to galvanize its followers, and to confound  its antagonists, Baha'u'llah, at this supremely critical hour in its  fortunes, was at last stepping into the very center of the stage so  tragically vacated by the Bab--a stage on which He was destined, for no  less a period than forty years, to play a part unapproached in its  majesty, pathos and splendor by any of the great Founders of the world's  historic religions.    Already so conspicuous and towering a figure had, through the accusations  levelled against Him, kindled the wrath of Muhammad _Sh_ah, who, after  having heard what had transpired in Bada_sh_t, had ordered His arrest, in  a number of farmans addressed to the _kh_ans of Mazindaran, and expressed  his determination to put Him to death. Haji Mirza Aqasi, previously  alienated from the Vazir (Baha'u'llah's father), and infuriated by his own  failure to appropriate by fraud an estate that belonged to Baha'u'llah,  had sworn eternal enmity to the One Who had so brilliantly succeeded in  frustrating his evil designs. The Amir-Nizam, moreover, fully aware of the  pervasive influence of so energetic an opponent, had, in the presence of a  distinguished gathering, accused Him of having inflicted, as a result of  His activities, a loss of no less than five kururs upon the government,  and had expressly requested Him, at a critical moment in the fortunes of  the Faith, to temporarily transfer His residence to Karbila. Mirza Aqa  _Kh_an-i-Nuri, who succeeded the Amir-Nizam, had endeavored, at the very  outset of his ministry, to effect a reconciliation "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19279"],[0,"Memorials of the Faithful (#20)"],[1," conversion he  traveled everywhere, through the cities and villages of Persia, and his  breath moved the hearts of longing souls. Then he left for 'Iraq, and on  the Beloved's first journey, attained His presence there. Once he beheld  that beauteous Light he was carried away to the Kingdom of Splendors; he  was incandescent, he became a thrall of yearning love. At this time he was  directed to go back to Persia. He was a peddler, a vendor of small wares,  and would travel from city to city.    On Baha'u'llah's second journey to 'Iraq, Haji Hasan longed to behold Him  again, and there in Ba_gh_dad was once more bedazzled by His presence.  Every so often he would journey to Persia and then return, his thoughts  centered on teaching and furthering the Cause. His business fell apart.  His merchandise was carried away by thieves, and thus, as he put it, his  load was lifted from him--he was disencumbered. He shunned every worldly  tie. He was held fast as by a magnet; he fell hopelessly, madly in love  with the tender Companion, with Him Who is the Well-Beloved of both  worlds. He was known everywhere for the ecstasy he was in, and experienced  strange states of being; sometimes, with utmost eloquence, he would teach  the Faith, adducing as proofs many a sacred verse and holy tradition, and  bringing sound and reasonable arguments to bear. Then his hearers would  comment on the power of his mind, on his wisdom and his self-possession.  But there were other times when love suddenly flamed within him, and then  he could not remain still for an instant. At those times he would skip,  and dance, or again in a loud voice he would cry out a verse from the  poets, or a song. Toward the end of his days he became a close friend of  Jinab-i-Munib; the two exchanged many a recondite confidence, and each  carried many a melody in his breast.    On the friends' final journey he went to A_dh_irbayjan, and there,  throwing caution to the winds, he roared out the Greatest Name: \"Ya  Baha'u'l-Abha!\" The unbelievers there joined forces with his relatives,  and they lured that innocent, that man in his ecstasy, away to a garden.  Here, they first put questions to him and listened to his answers. He  spoke out; he expounded the secret verities of the Faith, and set forth  conclusive proofs that the Advent had indeed come to pass. He recited  verses from the Qur'an, and traditions handed down from the Prophet  Muhammad and the Holy Imams. Following that, in a frenzy of love and  longing rapture, he began to sing. It was a _sh_ahnaz melody he sang; the  words were from the poets, to say that the Lord had come. And they killed  him; they shed his blood. They wrenched and hacked his limbs apart and hid  his body underneath the dust.    As for Haji Muhammad-Ja'far, the gently born, he too, like his brother,  was bewitched by the Blessed Beauty. It was in 'Iraq that he entered the  presence of the Light of the World, and he too caught fire with Divine  love and was carried away by the gentle gales of God. Like his brother, he  was a vendor of small wares, always on a journey from one place to the  next. When Baha'u'llah left Ba_gh_dad for the capital of Islam, Haji  Ja'far was in Persia, and when the Blessed Beauty and His retinue came to  a halt in Adrianople, Ja'far and Haji Taqi, his brother, arrived there  from A_dh_irbayjan. They found a corner somewhere and settled down. Our  oppressors then stretched out arrogant hands to send Baha'u'llah forth to  the Most Great Prison, and they forbade the believers to accompany the  true Beloved, for it was their purpose to bring the Blessed Beauty to this  prison with but a few of His people. When Haji Ja'far saw that they had  excluded him from the band of exiles, he seized a razor and slashed his  throat.(73) The crowds expressed their grief and horror and the  authorities then permitted all the believers to leave in company with  Baha'u'llah--this because of the blessing that came from Ja'far's act of  love.    They stitched up his wound but no one thought he would recover. They told  him, \"For the time being, you will have to stay where you are. If your  throat heals, you will be sent on, along with your brother. Be sure of  this.\" Baha'u'llah also directed that this be done. Accordingly, we left  Ja'far in the hospital and went on to the Akka prison. Two months later,  he and his brother Haji Taqi arrived at the fortress, and joined the other  prisoners. The safely delivered Haji grew more loving, more ardent with  every passing day. From dusk till dawn he would stay awake, chanting  prayers, shedding his tears. Then one night he fell from the roof of the  caravanserai and ascended to the Kingdom of miracles and signs.    Haji Taqi, born under a fortunate star, was in every sense a true brother  to Haji Ja'far. He lived in the same spiritual condition, but he was  calmer. After Haji Ja'far's death, he would stay in one room, all alone.  He was silence itself. He would sit there, all alone, properly and  courteously, even during the night. One midnight he climbed up to the roof  to chant prayers. The next morning they found him where he had fallen, on  the ground by the wall. He was unconscious, and they could not tell  whether this was an accident or whether he had thrown himself down. When  he came to himself he said: \"I was weary of this life, and I tried to die.  Not for a moment do I wish to linger in this world. Pray that I may go  on.\"    This, then, is the life story of those three brothers. All three were  souls well-assured; all three were pleased, and pleasing unto God.(74)  They were flames; they were captives of the Faith; they were pure and  holy. And therefore, cut off from the world, turning their faces toward  the Most High Kingdom, they ascended. May God wrap them in the garment of  His grace in the realm of forgiveness, and immerse them in the waters of  His mercy forever and ever. Greetings be unto them, and praise.            HAJI MIRZA MUHAMMAD-TAQI, THE AFNAN      Among those souls that are righteous, that are luminous entities and  Divine reflections, was Jinab-i-Muhammad-Taqi, the Afnan.(75) His title  was Vakilu'd-Dawlih. This eminent Bough was an offshoot of the Holy Tree;  in him an excellent character was allied to a noble lineage. His kinship  was a true kinship. He was among those souls who, after one reading of the  Book of Iqan, became believers, bewitched by the sweet savors of God,  rejoicing at the recital of His verses. His agitation was such that he  cried out, \"Lord, Lord, here am I!\" Joyously, he left Persia and hurried  away to 'Iraq. Because he was filled with longing love, he sped over the  mountains and across the desert wastes, not pausing to rest until he came  to Ba_gh_dad.    He entered the presence of Baha'u'llah, and achieved acceptance in His  sight. What holy ecstasy he had, what fervor, what detachment from the  world! It was beyond description. His blessed face was so comely, so  luminous that the friends in 'Iraq gave him a name: they called him \"the  Afnan of all delights.\" He was truly a blessed soul, a man worthy to be  revered. He never failed in his duty, from the beginning of life till his  last breath. As his days began, he became enamored of the sweet savors of  God, and as they closed, he rendered a supreme service to the Cause of  God. His life was righteous, his speech agreeable, his deeds worthy. Never  did he fail in servitude, in devotion, and he would set about a major  undertaking with alacrity and joy. His life, his behavior, what he did,  what he left undone, his dealings with others--were all a way of teaching  the Faith, and served as an example, an admonishment to the rest.    After he had achieved the honor, in Ba_gh_dad, of meeting Baha'u'llah, he  returned to Persia, where he proceeded to teach the Faith with an eloquent  tongue. And this is how to teach: with an eloquent tongue, a ready pen, a  goodly character, pleasing words, and righteous ways and deeds. Even  enemies bore witness to his high-mindedness and his spiritual qualities,  and they would way: \"There is none to compare with this man for his words  and acts, his righteousness, trustworthiness, and strong faith; in all  things he is unique; what a pity that he is a Baha'i!\" That is: \"What a  pity that he is not as we are, perverse, uncaring, committing sins,  engrossed in sensuality, the creatures of our passions!\" Gracious God!  They saw with their own eyes that the moment he learned of the Faith he  was transformed, he was severed from the world, he began to emit rays from  the Sun of Truth; and still, they failed to profit by the example he set.    During his days in Yazd he was, outwardly, engaged in commercial pursuits,  but actually teaching the Faith. His only aim was to exalt the Word of  God, his only wish, to spread the Divine sweet savors, his only thought,  to come nearer and ever nearer to the mansions of the Lord. There was no  remembrance on his lips but the verses of God. He was an embodiment of the  good pleasure of Baha'u'llah; a dawning-point of the grace of the Greatest  Name. Many and many a time, Baha'u'llah expressed to those about Him, His  extreme satisfaction with the Afnan; and consequently, everyone was  certain that he would in future initiate some highly important task.    After the ascension of Baha'u'llah, the Afnan, loyal and staunch in the  Covenant, rendered even more services than he had before; this in spite of  many obstacles, and an overwhelming load of work, and an infinite variety  of matters all claiming his attention. He gave up his comfort, his  business, his properties, estates, lands, hastened away to I_sh_qabad and  set about building the Ma_sh_riqu'l-A_dh_kar; this was a service of very  great magnitude, for he thus became the first individual to erect a Baha'i  House of Worship, the first builder of a House to unify man. With the  believers in I_sh_qabad assisting him, he succeeded in carrying off the  "]]]
