And now its fore  feet were on the strand--now its enormous breast, scaled on either  side as in armour, in the centre showing its corrugated skin of a dull  venomous yellow; and now its whole length was on the land, a hundred  feet or more from the jaw to the tail. Another stride of those ghastly  feet would have brought it to the spot where I sat. There was but a  moment between me and this grim form of death, when what seemed a flash  of lightning shot through the air, smote, and, for a space of time  briefer than that in which a man can draw his breath, enveloped  the monster; and then, as the flash vanished, there lay before me a  blackened, charred, smouldering mass, a something gigantic, but of which  even the outlines of form were burned away, and rapidly crumbling into  dust and ashes. I remained still seated, still speechless, ice-cold with  a new sensation of dread; what had been horror was now awe.    I felt the child's hand on my head--fear left me--the spell was  broken--I rose up. \"You see with what ease the Vril-ya destroy their  enemies,\" said Taee; and then, moving towards the bank, he contemplated  the smouldering relics of the monster, and said quietly, \"I have  destroyed larger creatures, but none with so much pleasure. Yes, it IS  a Krek; what suffering it must have inflicted while it lived!\" Then he  took up the poor fishes that had flung themselves ashore, and restored  them mercifully to their native element.        Chapter XIX.      As we walked back to the town, Taee took a new and circuitous way,  in order to show me what, to use a familiar term, I will call the  'Station,' from which emigrants or travellers to other communities  commence their journeys. I had, on a former occasion, expressed a wish  to see their vehicles. These I found to be of two kinds, one for land  journeys, one for aerial voyages: the former were of all sizes and  forms, some not larger than an ordinary carriage, some movable houses of  one story and containing several rooms, furnished according to the ideas  of comfort or luxury which are entertained by the Vril-ya. The aerial  vehicles were of light substances, not the least resembling our  balloons, but rather our boats and pleasure-vessels, with helm and  rudder, with large wings or paddles, and a central machine worked by  vril. All the vehicles both for land or air were indeed worked by that  potent and mysterious agency.    I saw a convoy set out on its journey, but it had few passengers,  containing chiefly articles of merchandise, and was bound to a  neighbouring community; for among all the tribes of the Vril-ya there  is considerable commercial interchange. I may here observe, that their  money currency does not consist of the precious metals, which are too  common among them for that purpose. The smaller coins in ordinary use  are manufactured from a peculiar fossil shell, the comparatively scarce  remnant of some very early deluge, or other convulsion of nature, by  which a species has become extinct. It is minute, and flat as an oyster,  and takes a jewel-like polish. This coinage circulates among all the  tribes of the Vril-ya. Their larger transactions are carried on much  like ours, by bills of exchange, and thin metallic plates which answer  the purpose of our bank-notes.    Let me take this occasion of adding that the taxation among the tribe I  became acquainted with was very considerable, compared with the amount  of population. But I never heard that any one grumbled at it, for it was  devoted to purposes of universal utility, and indeed necessary to the  civilisation of the tribe. The cost of lighting so large a range  of country, of providing for emigration, of maintaining the public  buildings at which the various operations of national intellect were  carried on, from the first education of an infant to the departments in  which the College of Sages were perpetually trying new experiments in  mechanical science; all these involved the necessity for considerable  state funds. To these I must add an item that struck me as very  singular. I have said that all the human labour required by the state is  carried on by children up to the marriageable age. For this labour the  state pays, and at a rate immeasurably higher than our own remuneration  to labour even in the United States. According to their theory, every  child, male or female, on attaining the marriageable age, and there  terminating the period of labour, should have acquired enough for an  independent competence during life. As, no matter what the disparity of  fortune in the parents, all the children must equally serve, so all  are equally paid according to their several ages or the nature of their  work. Where the parents or friends choose to retain a child in their  own service, they must pay into the public fund in the same ratio as the  state pays to the children it employs; and this sum is handed over to  the child when the period of service expires. This practice serves, no  doubt, to render the notion of social equality familiar and agreeable;  and if it may be said that all the children form a democracy, no less  truly it may be said that all the adults form an aristocracy. The  exquisite politeness and refinement of manners among the Vril-ya, the  generosity of their sentiments, the absolute leisure they enjoy for  following out their own private pursuits, the amenities of their  domestic intercourse, in which they seem as members of one noble order  that can have no distrust of each other's word or deed, all combine to  make the Vril-ya the most perfect nobility which a political disciple  of Plato or Sidney could conceive for the ideal of an aristocratic  republic.        Chapter XX.      From the date of the expedition with Taee which I have just narrated,  the child paid me frequent visits. He had taken a liking to me, which I  cordially returned. Indeed, as he was not yet twelve years old, and  had not commenced the course of scientific studies with which childhood  closes in that country, my intellect was less inferior to his than to  that of the elder members of his race, especially of the Gy-ei, and most  especially of the accomplished Zee. The children of the Vril-ya,  having upon their minds the weight of so many active duties and grave  responsibilities, are not generally mirthful; but Taee, with all  his wisdom, had much of the playful good-humour one often finds the  characteristic of elderly men of genius. He felt that sort of pleasure  in my society which a boy of a similar age in the upper world has in the  company of a pet dog or monkey. It amused him to try and teach me the  ways of his people, as it amuses a nephew of mine to make his poodle  walk on his hind legs or jump through a hoop. I willingly lent myself to  such experiments, but I never achieved the success of the poodle. I was  very much interested at first in the attempt to ply the wings which the  youngest of the Vril-ya use as nimbly and easily as ours do their legs  and arms; but my efforts were attended with contusions serious enough to  make me abandon them in despair.    These wings, as I before said, are very large, reaching to the knee,  and in repose thrown back so as to form a very graceful mantle. They are  composed from the feathers of a gigantic bird that abounds in the rocky  heights of the country--the colour mostly white, but sometimes with  reddish streaks. They are fastened round the shoulders with light but  strong springs of steel; and, when expanded, the arms slide through  loops for that purpose, forming, as it were, a stout central membrane.  As the arms are raised, a tubular lining beneath the vest or tunic  becomes, by mechanical contrivance inflated with air, increased or  diminished at will by the movement of the arms, and serving to buoy the  whole form as on bladders. The wings and the balloon-like apparatus are  highly charged with vril; and when the body is thus wafted upward, it  seems to become singularly lightened of its weight. I found it easy  enough to soar from the ground; indeed, when the wings were spread it  was scarcely possible not to soar, but then came the difficulty and the  danger. I utterly failed in the power to use and direct the pinions,  though I am considered among my own race unusually alert and ready in  bodily exercises, and am a very practiced swimmer. I could only make the  most confused and blundering efforts at flight. I was the servant of the  wings; the wings were not my servants--they were beyond my control;  and when by a violent strain of muscle, and, I must fairly own, in that  abnormal strength which is given by excessive fright, I curbed their  gyrations and brought them near to the body, it seemed as if I lost the  sustaining power stored in them and the connecting bladders, as when the  air is let out of a balloon, and found myself precipitated again to the  earth; saved, indeed, by some spasmodic flutterings, from being dashed  to pieces, but not saved from the bruises and the stun of a heavy fall.  I would, however, have persevered in my attempts, but for the advice or  the commands of the scientific Zee, who had benevolently accompanied my  flutterings, and, indeed, on the last occasion, flying just under me,  received my form as it fell on her own expanded wings, and preserved  me from breaking my head on the roof of the pyramid from which we had  ascended.    \"I see,\" she said, \"that your trials are in vain, not from the fault  of the wings and their appurtenances, nor from any imperfectness and  malformation of your own corpuscular system, but from irremediable,  because organic, defect in your power of volition. Learn that the  connection between the will and the agencies of that fluid which has  been subjected to the control of the Vril-ya was never established by  the first discoverers, never achieved by a single generation; it has"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19511"],[0,"Bell's Cathedrals: Wimborne Minster and Christchurch Priory (#20)"],[1," 1150.     2.

VICARS OF CHRISTCHURCH    By the council of Arles 1261, religious orders that held parish churches  were bound to supply vicars to officiate. These were appointed by the  canons, and were taken from their own body.    The names of many of these are known. The 13th was Robert Harys, whose  chantry stands in the south choir aisle; he died in 1325. In the time of  the 15th, William Trapnell, the church was granted by Henry VIII. to the  parishioners, 32nd year of Henry VIII. In the time of the 17th, Robert  Newman, an inventory of the property was made by order of Edward VI.'s  commissioner. John Imber, the 21st vicar, was expelled by the Parliament  from 1647-1660, but was restored to his preferment in the same year as  Charles II. gained the throne. The present vicar is the 32nd.      STRATFORD'S INJUNCTIONS, 1325    1. Every canon save the seneschal and cellarer must attend Matins, High  Mass, and the Hours. The seneschal, if present in the priory for two  nights together, must attend one Matins, and the cellarer must be  present at service on alternate nights at least.    2. Six canons must be enrolled for celebrating Our Lady's Mass; the  prior must celebrate on all great feasts at High Mass, and on Saturdays  at Our Lady's Mass, and must wear a surplice not a rochet.    3. Canons in priests' orders must celebrate daily, those who are not  must repeat eleven Psalms with a Litany or Psalter of Our Lady every  day.    4. Four confessors must be appointed to hear the confessions of the  canons.    5. Latin or French must be the languages spoken.    6. No one save the prior or officers, without special leave, must ride  or leave the Priory.    7. Two-thirds of the canons must dine daily in the refectory; the door  must be kept by a secular watchman whose duty it is to remove servants  and idle people from the door during dinner; the almoner must prevent  any canon carrying his commons to the laundry-people or people of the  town.    8. All the canons must sleep in the dormitory, each in his own bed.    9. The infirmary must be visited daily by the prior or sub-prior.    10. Two canons must act as treasurers, and a yearly account must be  presented.    11. The common seal must be kept under four locks, and documents sealed  in full chapter, not as heretofore during Mass.    12. Canons must not play at chess or draughts, nor keep hounds or arms  (save in the custody of the prior), nor have a servant (save when on a  journey), nor write nor receive letters without leave. The prior may  keep hounds outside the priory buildings.      ARCHBISHOP ARUNDEL'S INJUNCTIONS, 1404    No. 1. Ordered the destruction of an old hall and an adjoining chamber  known as the sub-prior's hall after the departure of Sir Thomas West its  then occupier, as noblemen were in the habit of occupying it to the  great disturbance of the order and the keeping open of gates which ought  to be closed.    No. 2. Enjoined the building of a house for the proecentor, and a new  chamber for the sick.    No. 3. Ordered the setting apart of a chamber for recreation apart from  the infirmary (it may be supposed that the canons during recreation  hours were noisy, thereby disturbing the sick).    No. 4. Directed the provision of separate studies for the canons. It  would appear that nobles, such as the Montacutes and Wests, put the  priory to such great expense by taking up their abode, together with  their retainers, in the domestic part of the buildings.      THE NORMAN CASTLE    Very little of the castle erected by Richard de Redvers, who died in  1137, remains; but on an artificial mound at no great distance to the  north of the Priory Church stand fragments of the east and west walls of  the square Norman keep, about 20 feet high and 10 feet thick. The castle  belonged to the De Redvers, Earls of Devon, till they were alienated to  the crown in the 9th year of Edward I. (1280), the last earl having died  in 1263, though the last female descendant lived till 1293. In 1331,  Edward III. granted the castle and land to William de Montacute, Earl of  Salisbury; after the execution of John de Montacute in 1400 for the part  he took in the plots against the new king, Henry IV., Sir Thomas West,  who lies buried in the Lady Chapel, was appointed constable. He died in  1405, then Thomas, Earl of Salisbury, held the castle till 1428. After  this it was held by various persons, and we find a constable of the  Lordship of Christchurch as late as 1656. The manor held by the De  Redvers, and then by the Montacutes, passed through various hands. Among  the holders we may notice the Nevilles, hence the connection with the  Priory of the ill-fated Margaret, the kingmaker's granddaughter, who was  Countess of Salisbury in her own right, the Earl of Clarendon, Sir  George Rose, and the present owner, the Earl of Malmesbury, who obtained  it in 1862.    In early days the bailiff of the de Redvers regulated all markets,  fairs, tolls, and fines, and had the right of preemption and sat as  judge in the tenants' court. Edward I. relieved the burgesses of  Christchurch from all arbitrary exactions, and established a fixed  fee-farm rent instead. The castle was taken for the Parliament by Sir  William Waller with 300 men on April 7, 1644.    A little to the north-east of the castle stand the remains of one of  the few Norman houses that have come down to the present time. It is  thus described in the first volume of \"The Domestic Architecture of the  Middle Ages\" by Turner and Parker, pp. 38, 39. This volume was published  in 1851. \"At Christchurch, in Hampshire, is the ruin of a Norman house,  rather late in the style, with good windows of two lights and a round  chimney shaft.[6] The plan, as before, is a simple oblong; the principal  room appears to have been on the first floor. It is situated on the bank  of the river near to the church, and still more close to the mound,  which is said to have been the keep of the castle; being between that  and the river, it could not well have been placed in a situation of  greater security. Whether it formed part of another series of buildings  or not, it was a perfect house in itself, and its character is strictly  domestic. It is about seventy feet long, and twenty-four broad, its  walls, like those of the keep, being exceedingly thick. On the ground  floor are a number of loop-holes: the ascent to the upper storey was by  a stone staircase, part of which remains; the ground floor was divided  by a wall, but the upper storey seems to have been a long room, lighted  by three double windows on each side; near the centre of the east wall,  next the river, is a large fireplace, to which the round chimney before  mentioned belongs. At the north end, there appears to have been a large  and handsome window of which part of the arch and shafts remain, and  there is a small circular window in the south gable. From what remains  of the ornamental part of this building, it appears to have been  elegantly finished and cased with squared stones, most of which are,  however, now taken away. There is a small projecting tower, calculated  for a flank, under which the water runs; it has loopholes both on the  north and east fronts, these walls are extremely thick. By the ruins of  several walls, there were some ancient buildings at right angles to this  hall, stretching away towards the keep. This was probably part of the  residence of Baldwin de Redvers, Earl of Devon, to whom the manor of  Christchurch belonged about the middle of the twelfth century.\"[7]        [6] Since rebuilt.

[Illustration: REMAINS OF THE NORMAN HOUSE.]    This building is much overgrown with ivy, which by a comparison of the  illustration given in the work just quoted with its present condition,  as represented in the photograph here reproduced, has increased  considerably during the last fifty years. It is due to the memory of the  Rev. William Jackson, who was vicar of Christchurch from 1778 to 1802,  that it should be recorded that he saved this valuable relic of Norman  domestic architecture from destruction. He was evidently imbued with a  spirit of love for antiquity by no means common a hundred years ago, and  far too rare even at the present day.
