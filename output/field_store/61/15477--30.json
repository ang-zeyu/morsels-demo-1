Say, that must be a fine place to get a drink!\" piped  in Andy; and at this little joke all of the girls giggled.          CHAPTER XVII    THE GIRLS FROM CLEARWATER HALL      The Rover boys remained with the girls from Clearwater Hall for the  best part of half an hour after the scare at the moving picture  theater, and during that time the young folks became quite well  acquainted.    \"We'll have to be getting back to our school now,\" said Ruth Stevenson,  presently.    \"Oh, what's your hurry?\" pleaded Jack. \"Weren't you going to stay to  the pictures?\"    \"No. We were going to leave immediately after that reel they were  showing when the explosion occurred,\" the girl replied.    \"Well, we've got to get back to Colby Hall in time for supper; but we  can make that easily enough--we are all good walkers.\"    \"I should think you would ride in your auto-stage,\" put in Alice  Strobell. \"I'd ride if we had a stage handy.\"    \"The stage isn't down here now,\" answered Randy. \"It only comes on  order.\"    The four boys walked with the girls to the end of a side street of the  town, and there the pupils from Clearwater Hall stopped to say  good-bye.    \"We are very thankful for what you did for us at the theater,\" said  Ruth Stevenson. \"You were very kind, indeed.\"    \"You are regular heroes!\" burst out May Powell, who by her merry eyes  showed that she was almost as full of fun as were the Rover twins. \"I'm  going to write to Spouter and let him know all about it.\"    \"And don't forget to mention the rescue of my hat,\" added Alice  Strobell with a giggle.    \"I hope I have the pleasure of meeting you again, Miss Stevenson,\" said  Jack, in an aside to the oldest girl of the party.    \"Well, maybe,\" she returned, looking at him frankly.    \"I've enjoyed this afternoon very much--in spite of that excitement.\"    \"Oh, so have I!\" and now she cast down her eyes while a faint flush  stole into her cheeks.    \"We won't dare say much about that trouble in the theater when we get  back to school,\" remarked Jennie Mason.    \"That's right!\" burst out Annie Larkins. \"If we did, maybe Miss Garwood  would refuse to let us attend any more performances.\"    \"Is Miss Garwood the head of your school?\" questioned Randy.    \"Yes. And let me tell you, she is a very particular and precise woman.\"    \"I guess she isn't as precise and particular as one of our professors,\"  was Andy's comment.    \"Oh! do you mean that teacher they call old Lemon?\" cried May Powell.    \"Yes.\"    \"We've met him a number of times. What a ridiculous man he is! I don't  understand why Colonel Colby keeps him.\"    \"I saw you look at me when I spoke about that boat race,\" said Jack to  Ruth Stevenson. \"Maybe you like to be out on the water?\"    \"Oh, I do--very much! You know we have boats at the school, and I often  go out with my friends.\"    \"I like to row myself. Perhaps some day you'd like to go out with me?\"  went on the oldest Rover, boldly.    \"I'd have to ask permission first,\" answered the girl, and then dropped  her eyes. Evidently, however, the tentative invitation pleased her.    As was to be expected, the parting between the boys and the girls was a  rather prolonged affair, and it looked as if everybody was highly  pleased with everybody else. But at last Annie Larkins looked at a  wrist watch she wore and gave a little shriek.    \"Oh, girls, we must be going! We ought to be at the school this  minute!\"    \"Then here is where we start the walking act,\" declared May Powell.  \"Good-bye, everybody!\" and away she hurried, leaving the others to  trail behind her.    \"Don't forget about the row,\" said Jack in a low tone to Ruth  Stevenson.    \"I'll remember--if I get the chance,\" she returned; and in a moment  more all of the girls were gone and the boys retraced their steps to  the center of the town.    \"Pretty nice bunch,\" was Randy's comment.    \"It's funny that Spouter Powell never told us he had such a nice  cousin,\" came from Fred.    \"Hello, Fred's already smitten!\" cried Jack, gaily.    \"Huh! you needn't talk,\" retorted the youngest Rover. \"How about  yourself? Didn't I catch you trying to make a date with that Ruth  Stevenson?\"    \"Oh, say, Fred! your ears are too big for your head,\" retorted Jack,  growing red, while Andy and Randy looked at each other suggestively.    By this time the excitement around the moving picture theater had died  away completely and the crowd had disappeared. The front doors were  closed, but the manager was just hanging out a sign to the effect that  the evening performances would be given as usual.    \"I guess it was a big scare for nothing,\" was Randy's comment.    \"The audience can be thankful that they got out without anybody being  hurt,\" returned Jack.    The boys made a few more purchases in Haven Point, and then started  back for Colby Hall.    \"I wonder if those girls go to church in Haven Point on Sundays,\"  remarked Jack, just before the Hall was reached.    \"I don't know,\" answered Andy. \"More than likely.\" His eyes began to  twinkle. \"Thinking of going to church yourself, Jack?\"    \"Didn't we go to church when we were at home, Andy?\"    \"Sure,\" was the prompt reply.    \"I think we can find out from Spouter or from some of the other  cadets,\" answered Fred. \"I know the boys are allowed to go to whatever  church they please on Sundays.\" It may be as well to add here that on  week days regular chapel exercises were held at Colby Hall before the  ordinary classes were in session.    From Spouter Jack received the information he desired, which was to the  effect that his cousin May and a number of her chums generally attended  a church on the outskirts of Haven Point in the direction of Clearwater  Hall.    \"If you say so, I'll go with you there to-morrow morning,\" continued  Spouter; and so the matter was arranged. At the church the cadets heard  a very good sermon, and after the services had the pleasure of  strolling with the girls as far as the entrance to their school  grounds.    Monday morning found the Rovers once more down to the grind of lessons.  So far they had gotten along very well. But on Tuesday the unfortunate  Andy had another run-in with Asa Lemm.    \"This won't do at all, Rover,\" stormed the professor, after Andy had  given the wrong answer to a question. \"You must pay more attention to  your studies.\"    \"I'm doing the best I can, Professor,\" pleaded the youth.    \"Nonsense! I don't believe a word of it. They tell me you spend most of  your time in horseplay. Now, that won't do at all. You must buckle down  to your studies or I shall have to take you in hand;\" and Professor  Lemm glared at the lad as if ready to devour him.    \"Say, Andy, you'll have to toe the chalk mark after this,\" whispered  his twin. \"If you----\"    \"Silence there! I will have silence!\" cried Asa Lemm, pounding on his  desk with a paper weight.    \"I'll have one grand smash-up with that man some day,\" was Andy's  comment in speaking of the affair after the school session had closed.  \"I can't stand his arbitrary ways.\"    \"Oh, he's a lemon--and worse,\" returned his brother.    During that week there was an election of officers for the school  battalion, composed of Company A and Company B. The Rover boys, being  freshmen, could not compete for any position, even had they so desired;  but there was a good deal of electioneering among the cadets, and the  lads got quite a lot of fun out of it. The announcement of who was  elected was followed by a parade around the grounds and an unusually  good supper in the mess hall. Then the boys were allowed to gather at  one end of the parade ground near the river, where they soon had  several large bonfires burning, around which they danced, sang, and cut  up to their hearts' content.    The election had been a bitter disappointment to Slugger Brown and  Nappy Martell. Each had wanted to be an officer of the battalion, and  each had failed to get the required number of votes.    \"It's that Gif Garrison-Spouter Powell crowd that did it,\" muttered  Slugger Brown. \"I saw 'em working like troopers to defeat us.\"    \"Yes. And those Rover boys worked against both of you, too,\" piped in  Codfish, who was present. \"I watched 'em do it. They went all around  among the fellows they know electioneering for the others who were  running.\"    \"It would be just like them to do it,\" muttered Nappy Martell,  gloomily.    \"I thought you were going to fight that Jack Rover to a finish some  day?\" questioned the sneak of the school.    \"So I am--when I get the chance,\" returned Martell.    As soon as the election of officers was settled, the minds of a certain  number of cadets turned to football. Gif Garrison was busy arranging  his teams and placing the names of the players up on a big board in the  gymnasium.    \"Hurrah!\" shouted Fred, bursting in on Jack one afternoon while the  latter was busy in his room studying the next day's lessons. \"Our names  are up on the board, Jack! Gif has put us up for a try-out on the scrub  eleven!\"    \"Is that so!\" exclaimed his cousin, his face showing his satisfaction.  \"Are you sure?\"    \"I am. I just came from the gymnasium. We are to report for practice  to-morrow afternoon at four o'clock.\"    \"Is Andy or Randy up?\"    \"No. You remember they told Gif they didn't want to play football this  season.\"    The Rover boys soon learned that not only Gif but also Spouter, Ned  Lowe, Walt Baxter, and Slugger Brown were on the regular eleven. The  scrub team was made up largely from the freshmen class, although Dan  Soppinger and a few others of the older cadets who had never played on  the first team were also included.    \"Now, I want all of you to do your very best,\" said Gif, at the close  of a long talk to the boys on what was required of them. \"We'll have  nothing but squad work first, and then a game or two just to find out  how matters are shaping themselves.\"    As an aid Gif had Mr. Crews, the gymnasium instructor, who"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21899"],[0,"A Rip Van Winkle Of The Kalahari (#20)"],[1,"the two prospectors rode  ahead to locate the best spot for proving this fresh field, the rest of  the expedition following more leisurely. Dick had to confess that they  were most artistic in their methods. On arriving near the high dune,  where he had seen Grosman giving Fortune a friendly lead in the small  hours of the morning, Dick found to his astonishment that they were  being guided to quite a different spot at some distance from the  carefully prepared \"jeweller's shop.\" \"What the devil does this mean?\"  mused he, as he rode behind with the professor and the others. He could  not be mistaken about the spot, for the dune was too prominent a  landmark yet there were the two prospectors signaling to them from a  place at least half a mile away from the scene of his nocturnal  experience. Trotting across to them they found an argument in full  swing.    \"Gentlemen,\" said the other prospector a tall slab-sided individual  whose English was of a pronounced American flavor. \"I don't think this  kind of thing is fair! I'm here earning the company's dollars, and I'm  about tired of being yanked around to try spots that Grosman points  out. I guess I'm here to locate the pay-dirt as well as he is, that's  what the company pays me for, that's what I'm here for, to find out the  truth! No, sir not any I don't.\"    \"Junes,\" cried Gilderman, \"remember your position! I'm sure no one ever  expressed a doubt as to the syndicate's finds and I--\"    \"But look-ee here, Mr. Gilderman,\" interrupted the prospector; \"you've  got to excuse me. I'm supposed to look into this thing myself, besides  it's for the blamed fool's own benefit. Any fool can see that the  deepest wash runs the other side of that dune, not this.\"    \"Rot,\" jerked out Grosman; \"well, if you want to go to your damned old  place, do so.\"    High words followed, the experts became partisans, every one was  dragged in except Dick and the Herr Professor, and the latter, flushed  and rattled and his glasses all awry, was at length appealed to in the  matter.    \"Ach, gentlemens,\" said he, beaming from one to the other, and  absolutely exuding good temper and conciliation; \"why quarrel on this  so-splendid an expedition, hein? Let us then return to the Herr  Prospector Junes' choice let us accede to this so good man's request,  hein?\"    \"Right,\" snorted Grosman; \"but if the damned place is no good don't  blame me and don't condemn the field. I can show you where there are  stones, anyway!\"    And so with many a sneer and jeer, and with an atmosphere of extreme  tension pervading the whole party, Junes was allowed to lead the way to  the spot of his choice. He went straight across the foot of the big  dune, and in a few minutes had amply justified himself, for there were  diamonds in abundance the diamonds his confederate Grosman had strewn  there the night before.    Now Solly's instructions to Dick to lie low, and say nothing, no matter  what he found out, had been explicit and insisted upon, and in spite of  his instinct to warn the professor, he might have been content to \"lie  low\" and go on watching till the trip was over, had it not been for a  certain small but excessively highly-charged black scorpion that found  its way into Dick's sleeping-bag that night; and more than making up in  \"cussedness\" what it lacked in size, gave him an exceedingly warm time  of it. One sting in particular, on a big vein in his leg, gave him  excruciating pain, and though he applied the universal veldt remedy of  nicotine from his pipe-bowl, the agony was so great and the swelling so  alarming that at length he hobbled off to the professor's tent to see  if that learned man could give him some relief. He found the old  gentleman sleeping soundly and had some difficulty in rousing him; but  that task accomplished, so assiduous was the professor in dressing the  sting, and such kindly interest did he display in both Dick and the  defunct scorpion, that Dick, who had always liked the old chap, almost  made up his mind to tell him all that he had seen and suspected. The  scorpion really settled the question for him, for the professor had  scarcely finished injecting Dick's leg than he turned his attention to  the dead reptile, at which he had already cast many curious glances as  it lay on his little camp-table beside his medicine chest. And now he  proceeded to examine it thoroughly, lighting a powerful acetylene lamp  for the purpose.    And scarcely had the strong rays fallen upon the black, wicked,  lobster-like little iniquity than the Herr Professor let off a regular  yell of delight and literally fell upon Dick's neck.    \"Ach, meine lieber!\" he exclaimed ecstatically. \"Aber this is most  wunderbahr! It is of the great fortune, good luck, what you call him?  That he sting you.\"    \"Good luck?\" said the surprised Sydney, feeling anything but pleased;  \"well, professor, it's the kind of luck that I can very well do  without. Why, the blamed little thing must have been about a thousand  volts strong. Sting! why it must have squirted about a pint of forked  lightning into me! Luck?\"    \"Of the greatest,\" said the scientist; \"of the most colossal. For it is  a discovery you have of him made he is new he is wonderful wunderschoen  wunderbahr!\"    \"You're wrong, professor,\" protested Dick with emphasis. \"He discovered  me. He may be new newly charged, anyway!\"    \"Of a variety entirely new, Herr Sydney,\" insisted the old professor  impressively; \"and much would I have given to have been in your place  to discover him.\"    \"You'd have been welcome,\" said Dick feelingly; \"but why?\"    \"It is my life-work, my stedenpferd, my 'hobby' you call it, hein? This  study of the arachnids, spiders, scorpions! Geology, you say? True,  that is my work, but this other is different, this I love! Already have  I four large volumes written upon the known varieties of scorpion and  now to have been but almost the discoverer of a new variety, it is hard  to have been so near. But at least I shall be the first to describe, to  classify, that honor you will grant me? It is hard to have been so  near!\"    \"Believe me, professor, it was a good deal harder to be just where I  was. But I see your point, and feel for you indeed I may say I'm  feeling it quite a lot even now. I'm mighty sorry the electric  gentleman with the red-hot trousers didn't sample you first as you say,  it's real hard he didn't. So do please take the fame and describe all  you want!\"    It took a lot of persuasion to make the scientist see it in the light  that Dick did, but after a while he consented to name the new specimen  after himself, and sat down to examine and gloat over his treasure.    But first he showed Dick some of his books, thick tomes full of  illustrations of most weird and undesirable-looking insects, spiders,  scorpions, and the like, and crammed with learned descriptions  bristling with Latin names; and he showed such an innocent delight in  his new acquisition that Dick's mind was made up. He did not like  Germans, but this old chap was so naive, so full of human-kindness, so  innocent and ignorant of all but his science that it would have been  infamous not to have warned him of what was happening. For Dick could  see plainly enough that if nothing were said this poor kind-hearted old  scientist would have to bear the blame when the gigantic swindle was at  length discovered, and the victimized public demanded a scapegoat.    He lifted the fly of the tent and looked out. There was no light in any  of the tents, and the sound of snoring came from them in chorus.  Farther away by the still flickering embers of the campfire could be  dimly seen a dozen or more recumbent forms, where the native boys  huddled. The waning moon was just rising, and except for the snores all  was quiet as only the desert can be; yet Dick, when he turned once more  towards the professor, stood with a warning finger on his lips, and  spoke but in a whisper. For he knew that he and the man he spoke to  were the only honest men in this lonely camp; and that the others would  not hesitate to put either himself or the professor out of the way if  once they suspected that their villainy was known, he never doubted.  Not that he was afraid; but here in the wilds, with six well-armed and  determined men against him, he saw the need for caution. The professor  he did not count not just then!    The old man still sat at his little camp-table, magnifying glass in  hand, and at Dick's low \"Hist,\" he turned a bland, inquiring gaze in  his direction. Dick came close to him, and with head half averted so  that he could listen for the slightest sound outside, he whispered his  story. Not a sound came either from the camp or from his listener till  his brief tale was ended.    \"They are all in it all rogues together, sir,\" he whispered in  conclusion; \"and it's part of a big swindle that people will blame you  for.\"    And for the first time since he began his tale he looked the professor  full in the face. He started with amazement as he did so: for now he  saw not a benign, smiling old scientist, beaming good nature and  affability through his spectacles, but a stern-faced, iron-mouthed man,  whose jaw was set with grim inflexibility, and whose eyes seemed  actually to blaze with fury. The big veins stood out upon his temples,  and the hand that still held the magnifying glass was now clenched in a  grip of iron, that trembled, not from weakness, but from the violence  of his anger and emotion.    Dick saw the man with new eyes: this was no worn-out old scientist,  such as he had deemed him; but a man still strong and vigorous, in  spite of his three-score and ten years, a man in whom the hot blood of  passion could still work wonders. And the younger man realized that if  the strong hand were necessary in this affair, he would by no means  need to play it alone.    \"Gott im Himmel!\" he muttered hoarsely, as Dick finished. \"Diebstahl"]]]
