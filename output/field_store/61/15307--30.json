All the most intelligent people in the country were being  led to a distant land, from which most of them would probably never  return. The iron rule of the Babylonians was everywhere supreme.    There are other nations and races whose people might not have cared so  much even if this had been the end of their national existence. But  the Hebrews from the beginning were proud of their race and ambitious  for its glory. They believed that it had been promised to Abraham,  their ancestor, that they should become a great nation in their land  of Canaan. This hope had grown stronger and stronger. Stories of the  greatness of King David were handed down from fathers to their  children. To the best men and women among them the great teachings of  such prophets as Amos and Isaiah were even more worthy of pride. \"We  have a knowledge of the true God,\" they said, \"such as no other nation  has. Surely there is a great future before us.\" And now all these  hopes seemed lost forever.    =The discouragement of the poor people in Canaan.=--Those who had been  left behind in Canaan when the Babylonians conquered the land were  even more hopeless and wretched. The exiles soon made a place for  themselves in the busy, prosperous land of Babylonia. They earned  money and lived in comfort. But the farmers on the stony hills of  Judaea suffered untold hardships. Not only were they poor; they were  also harassed by bands of robbers. The city of Jerusalem, which had  protected them, lay in ashes. The Babylonian governor did not help  them. He was there only to collect taxes and tribute. So the old  enemies, the robber tribes from the desert, came in and burned and  murdered and stole as they pleased. It is not strange that many of  these poor people felt that all was over for the Hebrew or Jewish  nation. Many of them ceased to worship Jehovah and became heathen,  like the other tribes around Canaan.      VOICES OF COMFORT AND HOPE    It was not easy, however, to crush the courage of the Jews. Out of the  darkness of those days we hear a whole chorus of voices, all of them  saying: \"This is _not_ the end of everything for us. Jehovah has not  forgotten his promises to our ancestors. He will bring back the exiles  from Babylon, and from other distant lands whither they have escaped,  and will rebuild Jerusalem in all its beauty, and will restore the  glory of our nation in the land of Canaan.\"    =The prophecies in Isaiah.=--Many of these voices are found in short  passages scattered through the writings of the older prophets. Two of  them are in Isaiah 9 and 11.        =\"The people that walked in darkness have seen a great light:      ... the rod of his oppressor thou hast broken.... For all the      armor of the armed man in the tumult, and the garments rolled      in blood, shall even be for burning, for fuel of fire. For      unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given; and the      government shall be upon his shoulder, and his name shall be      called Wonderful, Counsellor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father,      Prince of Peace.\"=    \"In other words,\" he reasoned, \"Jehovah will free us from the  tyrannical Babylonians, give us an ideal king, who shall be wise and  just and faithful, and under whose rule we shall see no more of the  horror and cruelty of war.\"    =Ezekiel's prophecies of hope.=--Away off in Babylonia itself Ezekiel  helped to keep alive the hopes of the exiles. Even though the nation  is dead, he told them, Jehovah can bring it to life. It will be as  though the dry and bleaching bones in some valley where a battle was  long ago fought should suddenly come together as human skeletons, and  warm living flesh should grow upon them once more. Ezekiel worked out  a kind of constitution for the new nation and the temple when these  should be restored.    All these brave leaders helped the Jews to believe in themselves as a  people. They listened to these men as they spoke in their synagogues  in Judaea and in Babylonia. They handed from one to another the rolls  on which their words were written. And ever the children heard from  their mothers these hopes which kept them from being completely  discouraged: \"We are Jews. The Jewish nation is not going to be  destroyed. Some day the exiles in Babylon will return to the old  country. We will have a king of our own. And we will build the great  nation which Jehovah promised Abraham.\"      THE BEGINNINGS OF A RESTORED JUDAH    In the year B.C. 538, the Babylonian empire was conquered by Cyrus,  the Persian. There was scarcely any resistance on the part of the  Babylonians. And one of his first acts in the conquered city was to  issue a proclamation that captives and exiles from other lands might  return if they wished. It was the chance for which the Jews for forty  years had been hoping. Now at last they could go back over that  thousand-mile journey, up the Euphrates, across to the coast land, and  down to Canaan. But alas! too many years had passed. Most of those who  had come to Babylon as grown people and who remembered Canaan as home  were now dead. Most of the living Jews had grown up in Babylon and  were comfortably settled there. Yet some did return, and from time to  time others kept returning. These men who thought enough of their  nation to go back to the home land and help it in its weakness and  poverty almost always became leaders.    =The new temple.=--It may have been a group of these leaders returned  from Babylon who started the rebuilding of the temple in Jerusalem in  the year B.C. 520, just sixty years after the old temple of Solomon  was burned by the soldiers of Nebuchadrezzar. There were two prophets,  Haggai and Zechariah, who did much to stir up the people to this work.  Some of their words are preserved in the Old Testament books which  bear their names. These men may have been returned exiles. The new  building was erected on the same old foundation and was finished in  four years. It was dedicated amidst the shouts of the people, while  old men and women, who as children had seen the former temple before  it was destroyed, wept for joy that at last a house had been rebuilt  for Jehovah. It seemed like the beginning of better times for their  nation.      THE GREATEST OF THE PROPHETS OF HOPE    Yet the years that followed the building of the new temple were sad  and disappointing. The better days did not seem to come. The walls of  Jerusalem still lay in ruins. The robber tribes still made their cruel  raids. The poor people suffered most, for they were oppressed and  plundered by the richer men even of their own people. \"What has become  of Jehovah?\" men asked. \"Where are his promises to Abraham? Why does  he allow even his most faithful servants to be oppressed--those who do  not oppress others; who obey his just laws, and who are merciful to  their brothers?\"    =The great unknown.=--About this time there came to the people of  Israel a new message from one of the greatest prophets of all those  whom God has raised up in any nation. He is sometimes called the  \"Great Unknown,\" because we to-day know nothing about his personal  life, not even his name. His great messages to his fellow Jews are  found in the latter part of the book of Isaiah, beginning with chapter  40. The first verse of this chapter strikes the keynote of comfort  which runs through all the chapters to follow.        =\"Comfort ye, comfort ye my people, saith your God. Speak ye      comfortably to Jerusalem, and cry unto her, that her warfare      is accomplished, that her iniquity is pardoned; that she hath      received of the Lord's hand double for all her sins.\"=    With words that sing like a beautiful instrument of music he tells the  people that God has not forgotten them; that the scattered exiles  will be brought back to the home land; that the ruined city,  Jerusalem, will be rebuilt and made more lovely than before; that a  rule of justice will be established; and that the blessings of peace  and happiness will come to all.    =The greatness of service.=--Even better than these promises of  happiness, our unknown prophet helped the people to understand more  clearly what it means to _be_ a great nation. He did not believe that  the God of heaven and earth would make a favorite of any one nation.  Instead he taught that Jehovah had chosen Israel to be a servant  nation for him, to serve all other nations by teaching them about the  true God.        =\"I will also give thee for a light to the Gentiles, that      thou mayest be my salvation to the end of the earth.\"=    He explained in this way even the undeserved suffering which many of  the best people of Israel were enduring. Israel thus became a type of  Him who was \"despised and rejected of men.\" To be chastised and  afflicted and oppressed is not so hard to bear if it is all a part of  Jehovah's plan for men. The ideal in the Old Testament becomes a  reality in the New.    So for the first time the idea came into the world that Abraham's  dreams of a greater and nobler nation and God's promises to Abraham,  Moses, David and the rest were not for the Hebrew people only, but for  all men; that beginning with this little nation God was making a  better world; a world of love, instead of selfishness and hate; of  happy work and play, instead of misery and hopelessness and war.    Of course very few of the prophet's hearers understood him. But more  and more the Jews were filled with the thought that somehow God had a  great future for them. Boys and girls, as they grew up, wondered if  they might not become leaders, a new Moses, a second David, or Elijah,  to play some part in bringing the great future which God had promised.

Presently a red squirrel rushes out of the thicket at the left,  scurries along the rails and up and down the posts. He goes like a  little red whirlwind, though he has nothing whatever to hurry about.  Just opposite my stump he stops his rush with marvelous suddenness;  chatters, barks, scolds, tries to make me move; then goes on and out  of sight at the same breakneck rush. A jay stops a moment in a young  hickory above the fence to whistle his curiosity, just as if he had  not seen it fifty times before. A curiosity to him never grows old. He  does not scream now; it is his nesting time.--And so on through the  afternoon. The old fence is becoming a part of the woods; and every  wild thing that passes by stops to get acquainted.    I was weaving an idle history of the old fence, when a chickadee  twittered in the pine behind me. As I turned, he flew over me and lit  on the fence in front. He had something in his beak; so I watched to  find his nest; for I wanted very much to see him at work. Chickadee  had never seemed afraid of me, and I thought he would trust me now.  But he didn't. He would not go near his nest. Instead he began hopping  about the old rail, and pretended to be very busy hunting for insects.    Presently his mate appeared, and with a sharp note he called her down  beside him. Then both birds hopped and twittered about the rail, with  apparently never a care in the world. The male especially seemed just  in the mood for a frolic. He ran up and down the mossy rail; he  whirled about it till he looked like a little gray pinwheel; he hung  head down by his toes, dropped, and turned like a cat, so as to light  on his feet on the rail below. While watching his performance, I  hardly noticed that his mate had gone till she reappeared suddenly on  the rail beside him. Then he disappeared, while she kept up the  performance on the rail, with more of a twitter, perhaps, and less of  gymnastics. In a few moments both birds were together again and flew  into the pines out of sight.    [Illustration]    I had almost forgotten them in watching other birds, when they  reappeared on the rail, ten or fifteen minutes later, and went through  a very similar performance. This was unusual, certainly; and I sat  very quiet, very much interested, though a bit puzzled, and a bit  disappointed that they had not gone to their nest. They had some  material in their beaks both times when they appeared on the rail, and  were now probably off hunting for more--for rabbit fur, perhaps, in  the old orchard. But what had they done with it? \"Perhaps,\" I thought,  \"they dropped it to deceive me.\" Chickadee does that sometimes. \"But  why did one bird stay on the rail? Perhaps\"--Well, I would look and  see.    I left my stump as the idea struck me, and began to examine the posts  of the old fence very carefully. Chickadee's nest was there somewhere.  In the second post on the left I found it, a tiny knot-hole, which  Chickadee had hollowed out deep and lined with rabbit fur. It was well  hidden by the vines that almost covered the old post, and gray moss  grew all about the entrance. A prettier nest I never found.    I went back to my stump and sat down where I could just see the dark  little hole that led to the nest. No other birds interested me now  till the chickadees came back. They were soon there, hopping about on  the rail as before, with just a wee note of surprise in their soft  twitter that I had changed my position. This time I was not to be  deceived by a gymnastic performance, however interesting. I kept my  eyes fastened on the nest. The male was undoubtedly going through with  his most difficult feats, and doing his best to engage my attention,  when I saw his mate glide suddenly from behind the post and disappear  into her doorway. I could hardly be sure it was a bird. It seemed  rather as if the wind had stirred a little bundle of gray moss. Had  she moved slowly I might not have seen her, so closely did her soft  gray cloak blend with the weather-beaten wood and the moss.    In a few moments she reappeared, waited a moment with her tiny head  just peeking out of the knot-hole, flashed round the post out of  sight, and when I saw her again it was as she reappeared suddenly  beside the male.    Then I watched him. While his mate whisked about the top rail he  dropped to the middle one, hopped gradually to one side, then dropped  suddenly to the lowest one, half hidden by vines, and disappeared. I  turned my eyes to the nest. In a moment there he was--just a little  gray flash, appearing for an instant from behind the post, only to  disappear into the dark entrance. When he came out again I had but a  glimpse of him till he appeared on the rail near me beside his mate.    Their little ruse was now quite evident. They had come back from  gathering rabbit fur, and found me unexpectedly near their nest.  Instead of making a fuss and betraying it, as other birds might do,  they lit on the rail before me, and were as sociable as only  chickadees know how to be. While one entertained me, and kept my  attention, the other dropped to the bottom rail and stole along behind  it; then up behind the post that held their nest, and back the same  way, after leaving his material. Then he held my attention while his  mate did the same thing.    Simple as their little device was, it deceived me at first, and would  have deceived me permanently had I not known something of chickadees'  ways, and found the nest while they were away. Game birds have the  trick of decoying one away from their nest. I am not sure that all  birds do not have more or less of the same instinct; but certainly  none ever before or since used it so well with me as Ch'geegee.    For two hours or more I sat there beside the pine thicket, while the  chickadees came and went. Sometimes they approached the nest from the  other side, and I did not see them, or perhaps got only a glimpse as  they glided into their doorway. Whenever they approached from my side,  they always stopped on the rail before me and went through with their  little entertainment. Gradually they grew more confident, and were  less careful to conceal their movements than at first. Sometimes only  one came, and after a short performance disappeared. Perhaps they  thought me harmless, or that they had deceived me so well at first  that I did not even suspect them of nest-building. Anyway, I never  pretended I knew.    As the afternoon wore away, and the sun dropped into the pine tops,  the chickadees grew hungry, and left their work until the morrow. They  were calling among the young birch buds as I left them, busy and  sociable together, hunting their supper.          XI. A FELLOW OF EXPEDIENTS.      [Illustration]    Among the birds there is one whose personal appearance is rapidly  changing. He illustrates in his present life a process well known  historically to all naturalists, viz., the modification of form  resulting from changed environment. I refer to the golden-winged  woodpecker, perhaps the most beautifully marked bird of the North,  whose names are as varied as his habits and accomplishments.    Nature intended him to get his living, as do the other woodpeckers, by  boring into old trees and stumps for the insects that live on the  decaying wood. For this purpose she gave him the straight, sharp,  wedge-shaped bill, just calculated for cutting out chips; the very  long horn-tipped tongue for thrusting into the holes he makes; the  peculiar arrangement of toes, two forward and two back; and the stiff,  spiny tail-feathers for supporting himself against the side of a tree  as he works. But getting his living so means hard work, and he has  discovered for himself a much easier way. One now frequently  surprises him on the ground in old pastures and orchards, floundering  about rather awkwardly (for his little feet were never intended for  walking) after the crickets and grasshoppers that abound there. Still  he finds the work of catching them much easier than boring into dry  old trees, and the insects themselves much larger and more  satisfactory.    A single glance will show how much this new way of living has changed  him from the other woodpeckers. The bill is no longer straight, but  has a decided curve, like the thrushes; and instead of the  chisel-shaped edge there is a rounded point. The red tuft on the head,  which marks all the woodpecker family, would be too conspicuous on the  ground. In its place we find a red crescent well down on the neck, and  partially hidden by the short gray feathers about it. The point of the  tongue is less horny, and from the stiff points of the tail-feathers  lamina are beginning to grow, making them more like other birds'. A  future generation will undoubtedly wonder where this peculiar kind of  thrush got his unusual tongue and tail, just as we wonder at the  deformed little feet and strange ways of a cuckoo.    The habits of this bird are a curious compound of his old life in the  woods and his new preference for the open fields and farms. Sometimes  the nest is in the very heart of the woods, where the bird glides in  and out, silent as a crow in nesting time. His feeding place meanwhile  may be an old pasture half a mile away, where he calls loudly, and  frolics about as if he had never a care or a fear in the world. But  the nest is now more frequently in a wild orchard, where the bird  finds an old knot-hole and digs down through the soft wood, making a  deep nest with very little trouble. When the knot-hole is not well  situated, he finds a large decayed limb and drills through the outer  hard shell, then digs down a foot or more through the soft wood, and  makes a nest. In this nest the rain never troubles him, for he very  providently drills the entrance on the under side of the limb.    Like many other birds, he has discovered that the farmer is his  friend. Occasionally, therefore, he neglects to build a deep nest,"]]]
