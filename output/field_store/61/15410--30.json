For should he, too, conjure by the Name of Heaven and Earth,  he might look for a similar deliverance; and his recital of the myth  itself would tend to clinch the magical effect of his own incantation.    The description of Ziusudu has also great interest in furnishing us with  a close parallel to the piety of Noah in the Hebrew Versions. For in the  Gilgamesh Epic and in Berossus this feature of the story is completely  absent. We are there given no reason why Ut-napishtim was selected by  Ea, nor Xisuthros by Kronos. For all that those versions tell us, the  favour of each deity might have been conferred arbitrarily, and not in  recognition of, or in response to, any particular quality or action  on the part of its recipient. The Sumerian Version now restores the  original setting of the story and incidentally proves that, in this  particular, the Hebrew Versions have not embroidered a simpler narrative  for the purpose of edification, but have faithfully reproduced an  original strand of the tradition.          IV. THE DREAM-WARNING    The top of the Fourth Column of the text follows immediately on the  close of the Third Column, so that at this one point we have no great  gap between the columns. But unfortunately the ends of all the lines  in both columns are wanting, and the exact content of some phrases  preserved and their relation to each other are consequently doubtful.  This materially affects the interpretation of the passage as a whole,  but the main thread of the narrative may be readily followed. Ziusudu is  here warned that a flood is to be sent \"to destroy the seed of mankind\";  the doubt that exists concerns the manner in which the warning is  conveyed. In the first line of the column, after a reference to \"the  gods\", a building seems to be mentioned, and Ziusudu, standing beside  it, apparently hears a voice, which bids him take his stand beside  a wall and then conveys to him the warning of the coming flood. The  destruction of mankind had been decreed in \"the assembly (of the gods)\"  and would be carried out by the commands of Anu and Enlil. Before the  text breaks off we again have a reference to the \"kingdom\" and \"its  rule\", a further trace of the close association of the Deluge with the  dynastic succession in the early traditions of Sumer.    In the opening words of the warning to Ziusudu, with its prominent  repetition of the word \"wall\", we must evidently trace some connexion  with the puzzling words of Ea in the Gilgamesh Epic, when he begins his  warning to Ut-napishtim. The warnings, as given in the two versions, are  printed below in parallel columns for comparison.(1) The Gilgamesh Epic,  after relating how the great gods in Shuruppak had decided to send a  deluge, continues as follows in the right-hand column:         SUMERIAN VERSION                    SEMITIC VERSION         For (. . .) . . . the gods a        Nin-igi-azag,(2) the god Ea,       . . . (. . .);                      sat with them,       Ziusudu standing at its side        And he repeated their word to       heard (. . .):                      the house of reeds:       \"At the wall on my left side take   \"Reed-hut, reed-hut!

O my devout one . . . (. . .),      Thou man of Shuruppak, son of       Ubar-Tutu,       By our hand(?) a flood(3) . . .

The commands of Anu (and)           And bring living seed of every       En(lil . . .)                       kind into the ship.       Its kingdom, its rule (. . .)

Its breadth and length shall       correspond.       (. . .)                             In the deep shalt thou immerse       it.\"         (1) Col. IV, ll. 1 ff. are there compared with Gilg. Epic,       XI, ll. 19-31.         (2) Nin-igi-azag, \"The Lord of Clear Vision\", a title borne       by Enki, or Ea, as God of Wisdom.         (3) The Sumerian term _amaru_, here used for the flood and       rendered as \"rain-storm\" by Dr. Poebel, is explained in a       later syllabary as the equivalent of the Semitic-Babylonian       word _abubu_ (cf. Meissner, _S.A.I._, No. 8909), the term       employed for the flood both in the early Semitic version of       the Atrakhasis story dated in Ammizaduga's reign and in the       Gilgamesh Epic. The word _abubu_ is often conventionally       rendered \"deluge\", but should be more accurately translated       \"flood\". It is true that the tempests of the Sumerian       Version probably imply rain; and in the Gilgamesh Epic heavy       rain in the evening begins the flood and is followed at dawn       by a thunderstorm and hurricane. But in itself the term       _abubu_ implies flood, which could take place through a rise       of the rivers unaccompanied by heavy local rain. The annual       rainfall in Babylonia to-day is on an average only about 8       in., and there have been years in succession when the total       rainfall has not exceeded 4 in.; and yet the _abubu_ is not       a thing of the past.         (4) The word here rendered \"assembly\" is the Semitic loan-       word _buhrum_, in Babylonian _puhrum_, the term employed for       the \"assembly\" of the gods both in the Babylonian Creation       Series and in the Gilgamesh Epic. Its employment in the       Sumerian Version, in place of its Sumerian equivalent       _ukkin_, is an interesting example of Semitic influence. Its       occurrence does not necessarily imply the existence of a       recognized Semitic Version at the period our text was       inscribed. The substitution of _buhrum_ for _ukkin_ in the       text may well date from the period of Hammurabi, when we may       assume that the increased importance of the city-council was       reflected in the general adoption of the Semitic term (cf.       Poebel, _Hist. Texts_, p. 53).    In the Semitic Version Ut-napishtim, who tells the story in the first  person, then says that he \"understood\", and that, after assuring Ea  that he would carry out his commands, he asked how he was to explain his  action to \"the city, the people, and the elders\"; and the god told  him what to say. Then follows an account of the building of the ship,  introduced by the words \"As soon as the dawn began to break\". In  the Sumerian Version the close of the warning, in which the ship was  probably referred to, and the lines prescribing how Ziusudu carried out  the divine instructions are not preserved.    It will be seen that in the passage quoted from the Semitic Version  there is no direct mention of a dream; the god is represented at first  as addressing his words to a \"house of reeds\" and a \"wall\", and then as  speaking to Ut-napishtim himself. But in a later passage in the Epic,  when Ea seeks to excuse his action to Enlil, he says that the gods'  decision was revealed to Atrakhasis through a dream.(1) Dr. Poebel  rightly compares the direct warning of Ut-napishtim by Ea in the passage  quoted above with the equally direct warning Ziusudu receives in the  Sumerian Version. But he would have us divorce the direct warning from  the dream-warning, and he concludes that no less than three different  versions of the story have been worked together in the Gilgamesh Epic.  In the first, corresponding to that in our text, Ea communicates the  gods' decision directly to Ut-napishtim; in the second he sends a dream  from which Atrakhasis, \"the Very Wise one\", guesses the impending peril;  while in the third he relates the plan to a wall, taking care that  Ut-napishtim overhears him.(2) The version of Berossus, that Kronos  himself appears to Xisuthros in a dream and warns him, is rejected by  Dr. Poebel, who remarks that here the \"original significance of the  dream has already been obliterated\". Consequently there seems to him to  be \"no logical connexion\" between the dreams or dream mentioned at the  close of the Third Column and the communication of the plan of the gods  at the beginning of the Fourth Column of our text.(3)         (1) Cf. l. 195 f.; \"I did not divulge the decision of the       great gods. I caused Atrakhasis to behold a dream and thus       he heard the decision of the gods.\"         (2) Cf. Poebel, _Hist. Texts_, p. 51 f. With the god's       apparent subterfuge in the third of these supposed versions       Sir James Frazer (_Ancient Stories of a Great Flood_, p. 15)       not inaptly compares the well-known story of King Midas's       servant, who, unable to keep the secret of the king's       deformity to himself, whispered it into a hole in the       ground, with the result that the reeds which grew up there       by their rustling in the wind proclaimed it to the world       (Ovid, _Metamorphoses_, xi, 174 ff.).         (3) Op. cit., p. 51; cf. also Jastrow, _Heb. and Bab.       Trad._, p. 346.    So far from Berossus having missed the original significance of the  narrative he relates, I think it can be shown that he reproduces  very accurately the sense of our Sumerian text; and that the apparent  discrepancies in the Semitic Version, and the puzzling references to  a wall in both it and the Sumerian Version, are capable of a simple  explanation. There appears to me no justification for splitting the  Semitic narrative into the several versions suggested, since the  assumption that the direct warning and the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20300"],[0,"Henry VIII. (#20)"],[1,"envoy in England, \"the King sent for these ambassadors, and kept them  to dine with him privately in his chamber with the Queen, a very  unusual proceeding. After dinner he took to singing and playing on  every musical instrument, and exhibited a part of his very excellent  endowments. At length he commenced dancing,\" and, continues another  narrator, \"doing marvellous things, both in dancing and jumping,  proving himself, as he is in truth, indefatigable.\" On another day  there was \"a most stately joust.\" Henry was magnificently attired in  \"cloth of silver with a raised pile, and wrought throughout with  emblematic letters\". When he had made the usual display in the lists,  the Duke of Suffolk entered from the other end, with well-nigh equal  array and pomp. He was accompanied by fourteen other jousters. \"The  King wanted to joust with all of them; but this was forbidden by the  council, which, moreover, decided that each jouster was to run six  courses and no more, so that the entertainment might be ended on that  day.... The competitor assigned to the King was the Duke of Suffolk;  and they bore themselves so bravely that the spectators fancied  themselves witnessing a joust between Hector and Achilles.\" \"They  tilted,\" says Sagudino, \"eight courses, both shivering their lances at  every time, to the great applause of the spectators.\" Chieregati  continues: \"On arriving in the lists the King presented himself before  the Queen and the ladies, making a thousand jumps in the air, and  (p. 096)  after tiring one horse, he entered the tent and mounted another...  doing this constantly, and reappearing in the lists until the end of  the jousts\". Dinner was then served, amid a scene of unparalleled  splendour, and Chieregati avers that the \"guests remained at table for  seven hours by the clock\". The display of costume on the King's part  was equally varied and gorgeous. On one occasion he wore \"stiff  brocade in the Hungarian fashion,\" on another, he \"was dressed in  white damask in the Turkish fashion, the above-mentioned robe all  embroidered with roses, made of rubies and diamonds\"; on a third, he  \"wore royal robes down to the ground, of gold brocade lined with  ermine\"; while \"all the rest of the Court glittered with jewels and  gold and silver, the pomp being unprecedented\".

Cal._, ii., 918; _L. and P._,                     ii., 3455, 3462.]    All this riot of wealth would no doubt impress the impecunious  Charles. In September he landed in Spain, so destitute that he was  glad to accept the offer of a hobby from the English ambassador.[242]  At the first meeting of his Cortes, they demanded that he should marry  at once, and not wait for Francis's daughter; the bride his subjects  desired was the daughter of the King of Portugal.[243] They were no  more willing to part with Navarre; and Charles was forced to make to  Francis the feeble excuse that he was not aware, when he was in the  Netherlands, of his true title to Navarre, but had learnt it since his  arrival in Spain; he also declined the personal interview to which  Francis invited him.[244] A rupture between Francis and Charles was  only a question of time; and, to prepare for it, both were anxious (p. 097)  for England's alliance. Throughout the autumn of 1517 and spring of  1518, France and England were feeling their way towards friendship.  Albany had left Scotland, so that source of irritation was gone. Henry  had now a daughter, Mary, and Francis a son. \"I will unite them,\" said  Wolsey;[245] and in October, 1518, not only was a treaty of marriage  and alliance signed between England and France, but a general peace  for Europe. Leo X. sent Campeggio with blessings of peace from the  Vicar of Christ, though he was kept chafing at Calais for three  months, till he could bring with him Leo's appointment of Wolsey as  legate and the deposition of Wolsey's enemy, Hadrian, from the  Bishopric of Bath and Wells.[246] The ceremonies exceeded in splendour  even those of the year before. They included, says Giustinian, a \"most  sumptuous supper\" at Wolsey's house, \"the like of which, I fancy, was  never given by Cleopatra or Caligula; the whole banqueting hall being  so decorated with huge vases of gold and silver, that I fancied myself  in the tower of Chosroes,[247] when that monarch caused Divine honours  to be paid him. After supper... twelve male and twelve female dancers  made their appearance in the richest and most sumptuous array possible,  being all dressed alike.... They were disguised in one suit of fine  green satin, all over covered with cloth of gold, undertied together  with laces of gold, and had masking hoods on their heads; the ladies  had tires made of braids of damask gold, with long hairs of white  gold. All these maskers danced at one time, and after they had danced  they put off their visors, and then they were all known.... The    (p. 098)  two leaders were the King and the Queen Dowager of France, and all the  others were lords and ladies.\"[248] These festivities were followed by  the formal ratification of peace.[249] Approval of it was general, and  the old councillors who had been alienated by Wolsey's Milan expedition,  hastened to applaud. \"It was the best deed,\" wrote Fox to Wolsey,  \"that ever was done for England, and, next to the King, the praise of  it is due to you.\"[250] Once more the wheel had come round, and the  stone of Sisyphus was lodged more secure than before some way up the  side of the hill.                       [Footnote 242: _L. and P._, ii., 3705.]                       [Footnote 243: _Ibid._, ii., 4022.]                       [Footnote 244: _Ibid._, ii., 4164, 4188.]                       [Footnote 245: _L. and P._, ii., 4047.]                       [Footnote 246: _Ibid._, ii., 4348.]                       [Footnote 247: Chosroes I.

That was the everlasting pretence, but eighteen months before,  Maximilian had suffered a stroke of apoplexy; men, said Giustinian,  commenting on the fact, did not usually survive such strokes a year,  and rivals were preparing to enter the lists for the Empire.  Maximilian himself, faithful to the end to his guiding principle,  found a last inspiration in the idea of disposing of his succession  for ready money. He was writing to Charles that it was useless to  expect the Empire unless he would spend at least as much as the  French.[251] \"It would be lamentable,\" he said, \"if we should now lose  all through some pitiful omission or penurious neglect;\" and Francis  was \"going about covertly and laying many baits,\"[252] to attain   (p. 099)  the imperial crown. To Henry himself Maximilian had more than once  offered the prize, and Pace had declared that the offer was only  another design for extracting Henry's gold \"for the electors would  never allow the crown to go out of their nation\".[253] The Emperor had  first proposed it while serving under Henry's banners in France.[254]  He renewed the suggestion in 1516, inviting Henry to meet him at  Coire. The brothers in arms were thence to cross the Alps to Milan,  where the Emperor would invest the English King with the duchy; he  would then take him on to Rome, resign the Empire himself, and have  Henry crowned. Not that Maximilian desired to forsake all earthly  authority; he sought to combine a spiritual with a temporal glory; he  was to lay down the imperial crown and place on his brows the papal  tiara.[255] Nothing was too fantastic for the Emperor Maximilian; the  man who could not wrest a few towns from Venice was always deluding  himself with the hope of leading victorious hosts to the seat of the  Turkish Empire and the Holy City of Christendom; the sovereign whose  main incentive in life was gold, informed his daughter that he  intended to get himself canonised, and that after his death she would  have to adore him. He died at Welz on 12th January, 1519, neither Pope  nor saint, with Jerusalem still in the hands of the Turk, and the  succession to the Empire still undecided.                       [Footnote 251: _Ibid._, ii., 4172.]                       [Footnote 252: _L. and P._, ii., 4159.]                       [Footnote 253: _Ibid._, ii., 1923.]                       [Footnote 254: _Ibid._, ii., 1398, 1878, 1902,                     2218, 2911, 4257.]                       [Footnote 255: _Cf._ W.

The price of a vote was a hundredfold  more than the most corrupt parliamentary elector could conceive in his  wildest dreams of avarice. There were only seven electors and the prize  was the greatest on earth. Francis I. said he was ready to spend  3,000,000 crowns, and Charles could not afford to lag far behind.[256]  The Margrave of Brandenburg, \"the"]]]
