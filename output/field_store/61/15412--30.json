That hill isn't wuth much as it stands.  It's too steep to plow, and only a goat could find a foothold on it to  graze. So if you moving picture folks level it for me I may be able to  raise some crops on it. Shoot as much as you like. You can't hurt that  hill!\"    The men at the gun signaled that they were going to fire no more that  day, and then, as it was safe, the young folks made a trip to see the  extent of damage caused by the shells.    Great furrows were torn in the earth and the stones, and the top of the  hill, that had been rounding, was now quite flat, though far from being  smooth.    The next day had been set for filming the scenes with the big gun in  them. Contrary to expectations, no pictures could be taken, as the  throwing up of the earthworks had not been finished. But a number of men  from both \"armies\" were set to work, and as it afforded good practice  for the militia they were called on to dig trenches, throw up ridges of  earth, and go through other needful military tactics.    The girls had no part in the scenes with the big gun, except that, later  on, they were to act as nurses in the hospital tent.    On top of the hill a force of Confederates would be stationed, and they  were to reply to the fire of the big gun. Of course, when the  projectiles struck the hill the soldiers would be a safe distance away,  but by means of trick photography scenes would be shown just as if they  were sustaining a severe bombardment.    \"Is everything ready?\" asked Mr. Pertell, a few days after the setting  up of the big gun, during which interval a sort of fort had been  constructed on the hill and a redoubt thrown up.    \"I think so,\" answered Russ. \"We couldn't have a better day, as far as  sunshine is concerned. I'm ready to film whenever you are.\"    \"I'll give the word in a minute. Paul, you're in charge of a detachment  of Union soldiers that storms the hill as soon as the big gun has  silenced the battery there.\"    \"Very well, sir.\"    The big gun rattled out its booming challenge and was replied to by  volleys from the rifles of the Confederates on the hill and by their  field artillery, which they hurriedly brought up.    Shot after shot was fired, and one after another the Confederate cannon  were disabled. They were blown up by small charges of powder put under  them, set off by fuses lighted by the Confederates themselves, but this  did not show in the picture, and it looked as though the Southern  battery was blown up by shots from the big gun.    \"All ready now, Paul! Lead your men!\" yelled the director, who was  standing near Russ and his camera. \"Rush right up the hill. Stop firing  here!\" he called to those in charge of the big gun.    But something went wrong, or some one misunderstood. As Paul was  charging up the hill at the head of his little band, Russ, turning his  head for an instant, saw a man about to pull the lanyard of the big gun.    \"Don't shoot! Don't shoot!\" he yelled. \"It's aimed right at Paul and his  fellows!\"    But Russ was too late. The man pulled the cord. There was a deafening  roar, a cloud of smoke, a sheet of fire, and a black projectile was sent  hurtling on its way against the hill, up the side of which Paul was  climbing with his soldiers.          CHAPTER XXI    THE BIG SCENE      Nothing could be done! No power on earth could stop that projectile now  until it had spent itself, or until it had struck something and  exploded.    Horror-stricken, those near the big gun looked across the intervening  space. How many would survive what was to follow?    The man who had pulled the lanyard sank to the ground, covering his face  with his hands.    For a brief instant Paul, leading his men, looked back at the sound of  the unexpected shot. He had been told that no more were to be fired.  Doubtless, this was an extra one to make the pictures more realistic.  But when he saw, in a flash, something black and menacing leaping  through the air toward him and his men, instinctively he cried:    \"Duck, everybody! Duck!\"    He fell forward on his face and those of his men who heard and  understood did likewise.    Ruth, Alice and Estelle, who were watching the scene from a distant  knoll, hardly understood what it was all about. They had thought no more  shots would be fired when Paul began his charge, but one had boomed out,  and surely that was a projectile winging its way toward the partly  demolished hill.    \"That is carrying realism a little too far,\" said Ruth. \"I hope----\"    \"Paul has fallen!\" cried Alice. \"Oh--something has happened!\"    One must realize that all this took place at the same time. The firing  of the shot, the realization that it was a mistake, Paul's flash of the  oncoming projectile, his command to his men and the vision had by the  girls. All in an instant, for a shot from a big gun does not leave much  margin of time between starting and arriving even when fired with only a  small charge of powder for moving picture purposes.    And, so quickly had it happened that Russ had not stopped turning the  crank of his camera, nor had an assistant on the hillside, where he had  been stationed to film Paul and his soldiers.    And then the projectile struck. Into the soft dirt of the hillside it  buried its head, and then, as the explosion came, up went a shower of  earth and stones. And ever afterward the gunner who inserted that  charge blessed himself and an ever-watchful Providence that he had put  in but half a charge, the last of the powder.    For it was this half-charge that saved Paul and his men. The projectile  struck in the hill a hundred feet below where Paul was leading his force  up the slope, and though they were well-nigh buried beneath a rain of  sand and gravel, they were not otherwise hurt--scratches and bruises  being their portion.    \"What are they trying to do, kill us?\" cried a man, staggering to his  feet, blood streaming from a cut on his cheek.    \"This is too much like real war for me!\" yelled another throwing down  his gun. \"I'm going to quit!\"    \"No you don't!\" shouted Paul. \"Come on. It was a mistake. They won't  fire any more. It will make a great scene on the film. Come on!\"    He gave one look back toward the Union battery and saw Mr. Pertell  fluttering a white flag which meant safety. Waving his sword above his  head, Paul yelled again:    \"Come on! Come on! It's all right! Up the hill with you! That shot was  only to put a little pep in you!\"    \"Pep! More like sand! I got a mouthful!\" muttered a sergeant.    \"Get every inch of that. It's the best scene we've had yet, though it  was a close call!\" telephoned Mr. Pertell to the operator on the side of  the hill. \"Film every inch of it!\"    \"All right! I'm getting it,\" answered the camera man and he went on  grinding away at his crank.    The explosion of the shell had, for the moment, stopped the advance of  Paul and his men up the hill, but this momentary halt only made it look  more realistic--as though they really feared they were in danger, as  indeed they had been. Now the director called:    \"It's all right, Paul! Go ahead! Keep on just as if that was part of the  show.\"    \"It was a lively part all right!\" and Paul laughed grimly. \"Come on,  boys!\"    And the charge was resumed.    Back of the dismantled battery, whence they had presumably been driven  by the fire from the big gun, the Confederates were massed. They were  waiting for Paul's charge, and they, too, had been a little surprised by  the unexpected firing of the shell.    But now, in response to a signal on the field telephone, they prepared  to resist the assault.    \"Come on, boys! Beat the Yankees back!\" was the battle cry that would be  flashed on the screen.    Then came the fierce struggle, and it was nearly as fierce as it was  indicated in the pictures. Real blows were given, and more than one man  went down harder than he had expected to. There were duels with clubbed  rifles, and fencing combats with swords, though, of course, the  participants took care not to cut one another.    In spite of this, several received minor hurts. But this result only  added to the effectiveness of the scene, though it was painful. But in  providing realism for motion pictures more than one conscientious player  has been injured, and not a few have lost their lives. It is devotion of  no small sort to their profession.    Back and forth surged the fight, sometimes Paul's men giving way, and  again driving the Confederates back from the crest of the hill. Small  detachments here and there fired volleys of blank cartridges from their  rifles, but there was not as much of this for the close-up pictures as  there had been for the larger battle scenes. For while smoke blowing  over a big field on which hundreds of men and horses are massed makes a  picture effective, if seen at too close range it hides the details of  the fighting.    And Mr. Pertell wanted the details to come out in this close-up scene.    Back and forth surged the fight until it had run through a certain  length of film. Then the orders came that the Confederates were to give  up and retreat. Before this, however, a number of them had been killed,  as had almost as many Union soldiers.    Then came a spirited scene. Paul, leading his men, leaped up on the  earthworks of the Confederate battery, cut down the Southern flag--the  stars and bars. In its place he hoisted the stars and stripes, and with  a wild yell that made the fight seem almost real, he and his men  occupied the heights.    \"Well done!\" cried Mr. Pertell, enthusiastically, when he came over from  the ramparts of the big gun. \"Are you sure none of you was hurt when  that shell exploded?\"    \"None of us,\" answered Paul. \"It fell short, luckily, and the dirt was  soft. No big rocks were tossed up, fortunately, and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20386"],[0,"Embroidery and Tapestry Weaving (#20)"],[1,"is  required as in the embroidery. Good work can be very much marred in the  making up; on the other hand, a little extra interest added on a part  not often seen renders it doubly valuable.    The mounting of certain things should not be attempted at home; boxes  should be handed over to the cabinetmaker, books to the bookbinder, and  so on, for it is not possible for any one not an expert to do these  things properly, and even good work can look poor if badly set.    The question how to appropriately finish off an edge often arises; let  it be hem stitched rather than plain hemmed; or a narrow line of drawn  thread work may be inserted, for an open-work border is frequently a  set-off to the rest of the embroidery. If a binding is placed over the  edge this can be fixed with a pretty stitch, or the stitch alone can  bind the edge, one such as buttonhole, overcast, or that shown in fig.  76. With some stitches the edge of the material can be rolled over a  piping cord and the stitch worked over the thus emphasised margin.    The difficulty of procuring cord suitable for use with embroidered work  makes the appliance illustrated at fig. 149 a useful possession.[14] The  cords made upon this wheel can be of any thickness, according to the  number of plies and the substance in each. Different colours and  materials can be twisted up together, such as a gold and silk thread.    [Illustration: Fig. 149.]    To make a three-plied cord, cut three equal lengths of thread rather  longer than the required cord is to be, as it shortens in the  twisting. Make a loop at each end of the thread, or, better still,  attach tiny metal rings at the ends. Hook the threads in position as  shown in the diagram, and place the instrument far enough from the  clamped block of wood to make the threads that are stretched between  quite taut. Now commence the twisting by turning the large wheel quickly  with an even motion in the direction that continues to twist up the  threads, keeping the left hand on the instrument to steady it, for it  gradually slides towards the block as the twisting continues. When  corkscrew-like knots begin to come in the threads, stop revolving the  wheel, unhook the two outer threads and place them both on the central  hooks together with the third thread, keeping them taut during the  process. Revolve the large wheel again, in the direction opposite to  that in which it has been working, and continue turning until the cord  is tightly twisted up. It is now made, and can be removed from the  machine. The second twisting had better be over-done rather than not  sufficiently, since if over-twisted the cord rights itself upon being  removed from the machine. A two-ply cord is made in like manner, by  using first the two outer hooks only, and then placing both threads  together on the central hooks.    There is a simple way of making this cord without the help of any  instrument, but it is not possible to get the perfect result that the  machine gives. It is most easily carried out by two persons, though one  can do it. In order to make a two-plied cord, by hand, take a thread  rather more than twice the length of the required cord. Let each worker  take an end of the thread in the right hand and commence to twist it  between the thumb and finger, each working in direction opposite to the  other and keeping the thread at tension. When twisted as much as  possible without getting corkscrew-like knots in the thread, the cord  must be doubled in half by holding it at the centre and bringing  together the two ends, which are then knotted. During the entire process  the thread must be kept under tension. If one end of the cord is now let  go it should immediately twist itself up tight, and remain in that  position. If any small knots form during the process run the cord  sharply through the fingers once or twice to straighten it out.    [Illustration: Fig. 150.]    [Illustration: Fig. 151.]    [Illustration: Fig. 152.]    Another pretty kind of cord is a knotted one. It is made in the hand in  most primitive fashion by using the two first fingers as crochet hooks.  The thread used for making it should be stout and firm. To commence  making the cord, knot two pieces of thread together and place the  threads in position as shown in fig. 150. The next step is shown in fig.  151, which is the index finger of the left hand bringing the darker  thread through the loop. Fig. 152 shows this thread looped on the  finger, the cord held in the left hand instead of the right, and the  right hand in process of drawing the lighter thread, which was the last  loop, tight. The next move, fig. 153, shows the right-hand first finger  making the new loop with the lighter thread, and fig. 154 shows the  loop on the finger, the cord passed over to be held in the right hand  again, and the left hand this time pulling the last loop tight. Continue  making the cord by following out the last four positions consecutively.    [Illustration: Fig. 153.]    [Illustration: Fig. 154.]    A very usual finish to an edge is a fringe. This can be made either by  fraying out the material or by adding a detached fringe, either knotting  it in or attaching it in some other way. If the fringe is to be a  frayed-out one, the best way to do it is to first draw out a few warp  threads where the head of the fringe is to come, then hem stitch the  upper edge of this, see the right-hand end of fig. 155; this makes the  heading of the fringe secure, after which the remainder of the warp  threads can be withdrawn. When fringing a square in this fashion, it is  well to save some of the frayings out to knot in at the four corners  where otherwise there would be gaps.    [Illustration: Fig. 155.]    To knot an added fringe into the border is a very simple matter. Begin  by cutting the threads that are to compose it all to one length, about  double that of the required fringe. Take a few together to form a bunch  and double it in half. With a stiletto make a hole near the edge of the  material; then bring from the back a crochet hook through this hole, and  draw the loop formed by the doubling of the bunch a little way through,  then take the ends of the bunch through the loop and draw them tight in  order to make the knotting firm.    [Illustration: Fig. 156.]    There are many ways of patterning a plain fringe, sometimes a change of  colour in the knotted-in threads is sufficient, as shown in fig. 156.  Another very usual way is to divide the bunches and refasten them  together in some way to form a pattern. Fig. 157 is an example of this;  they may be either knotted together, as in the first half of the  diagram, or bound with thread as in the second half, the needle reaching  the required places by running in zigzag fashion up the thread and down  again.    [Illustration: Fig. 157.]    A simple fringe can be made of strands twisted together, as in the first  half of fig. 158. This is made upon the same principle as the twisted  cord already described. About three threads of the fringe are twisted up  tight, and an adjoining three treated in the same fashion. These threes  are then twisted together in the direction opposite to that which has  just been used, and thus are securely locked together. The ends of the  completed fringe may require a little trimming off to make all of an  equal length. The second half of the diagram shows a durable and simple  fringe made by a close series of knots down the thread.    [Illustration: Fig. 158.]    Fig. 159 suggests two methods by which a stitching of coloured thread  near the margin can help to decorate a plain fringed edge.    [Illustration: Fig. 159.]    A row of tassels makes a pretty finish to various things. Complicated  tassel-making requires a professional hand; even a simple tassel  requires making properly. The first proceeding is to wind some thread  round a piece of cardboard, which should be a little wider than the  tassel is to be long; then double a piece of the same thread and thread  the two ends into a needle, thus leaving a loop at the usual knot end.  Slip the needle through the centre of the wound thread close to the  cardboard, then through the loop and draw the thread tight; this will  bind the threads securely at that point. They can then be cut exactly  opposite this on the other side, which will release the cardboard. Give  the binding thread another tightening pull, and then take the needle and  thread straight through the centre, as shown in fig. 160, and fasten it  off with a good knot. This knot will be in the ball part of the tassel  and will help to make it round. Next, double the tassel into shape ready  for the collar. Thread the needle as before and make the thread encircle  the tassel, as shown in the second figure in the diagram, drawing the  thread quite tight, and, if necessary, winding it several times round  the neck of the tassel until the collar is of sufficient width, then  take the needle and thread straight through the centre, bringing it out  at the top, where it can be made use of to fix the tassel in its place  upon the work. With sharp scissors trim the edge of the tassel which  now is complete. The ball part can be further decorated by covering it  with an open network of stitches in some contrasting colour; buttonhole  and various lace stitches can be used for the purpose.    [Illustration: Fig. 160.]      KNOTS    Knots, which can be very pretty, are at times required in embroidery;  anything that requires a fastening may give an opportunity for some  pretty interlacing strap work or knotting. Also knots may be practically  useful in both weaving and embroidery, for sometimes a finishing thread  must be knotted on to a new one, since there may be no opportunity of  making a firm commencement with the aid of the material.    The knot shown in fig. 161 is called the girdle knot; it might be made  use of in many other ways. To carry it out, make a loop with one end"]]]
