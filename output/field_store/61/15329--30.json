He was telling a tale of his own  wrongs--always a thrilling subject. It was his barge he was speaking  about.    \"And 'e sent down word 'paint her inside hout,' not namin' no colour,  d'ye see? So I gets a lotter green paint and I paints her stem to stern,  and I tell yer she looked A1. Then 'E comes along and 'e says, 'Wot yer  paint 'er all one colour for?' 'e says. And I says, says I, 'Cause I  thought she'd look fust-rate,' says I, 'and I think so still.' An' he  says, 'DEW yer? Then ye can just pay for the bloomin' paint yerself,'  says he. An' I 'ad to, too.\" A murmur of sympathy ran round the  room. Breaking noisily in on it came Bobbie. She burst open the swing  door--crying breathlessly:--    \"Bill! I want Bill the Bargeman.\"    There was a stupefied silence. Pots of beer were held in mid-air,  paralysed on their way to thirsty mouths.    \"Oh,\" said Bobbie, seeing the bargewoman and making for her. \"Your barge  cabin's on fire. Go quickly.\"    The woman started to her feet, and put a big red hand to her waist, on  the left side, where your heart seems to be when you are frightened or  miserable.    \"Reginald Horace!\" she cried in a terrible voice; \"my Reginald Horace!\"    \"All right,\" said Bobbie, \"if you mean the baby; got him out safe. Dog,  too.\" She had no breath for more, except, \"Go on--it's all alight.\"    Then she sank on the ale-house bench and tried to get that breath of  relief after running which people call the 'second wind.' But she felt  as though she would never breathe again.    Bill the Bargee rose slowly and heavily. But his wife was a hundred  yards up the road before he had quite understood what was the matter.    Phyllis, shivering by the canal side, had hardly heard the quick  approaching feet before the woman had flung herself on the railing,  rolled down the bank, and snatched the baby from her.    \"Don't,\" said Phyllis, reproachfully; \"I'd just got him to sleep.\"              *          *          *          *          *          *    Bill came up later talking in a language with which the children were  wholly unfamiliar. He leaped on to the barge and dipped up pails  of water. Peter helped him and they put out the fire. Phyllis, the  bargewoman, and the baby--and presently Bobbie, too--cuddled together in  a heap on the bank.    \"Lord help me, if it was me left anything as could catch alight,\" said  the woman again and again.    But it wasn't she. It was Bill the Bargeman, who had knocked his pipe  out and the red ash had fallen on the hearth-rug and smouldered there  and at last broken into flame. Though a stern man he was just. He did  not blame his wife for what was his own fault, as many bargemen, and  other men, too, would have done.             *          *          *          *          *          *    Mother was half wild with anxiety when at last the three children turned  up at Three Chimneys, all very wet by now, for Peter seemed to have come  off on the others. But when she had disentangled the truth of what had  happened from their mixed and incoherent narrative, she owned that they  had done quite right, and could not possibly have done otherwise. Nor  did she put any obstacles in the way of their accepting the cordial  invitation with which the bargeman had parted from them.    \"Ye be here at seven to-morrow,\" he had said, \"and I'll take you the  entire trip to Farley and back, so I will, and not a penny to pay.  Nineteen locks!\"    They did not know what locks were; but they were at the bridge at seven,  with bread and cheese and half a soda cake, and quite a quarter of a leg  of mutton in a basket.    It was a glorious day. The old white horse strained at the ropes, the  barge glided smoothly and steadily through the still water. The sky was  blue overhead. Mr. Bill was as nice as anyone could possibly be. No one  would have thought that he could be the same man who had held Peter by  the ear. As for Mrs. Bill, she had always been nice, as Bobbie said, and  so had the baby, and even Spot, who might have bitten them quite badly  if he had liked.    \"It was simply ripping, Mother,\" said Peter, when they reached home very  happy, very tired, and very dirty, \"right over that glorious aqueduct.  And locks--you don't know what they're like. You sink into the ground  and then, when you feel you're never going to stop going down, two great  black gates open slowly, slowly--you go out, and there you are on the  canal just like you were before.\"    \"I know,\" said Mother, \"there are locks on the Thames. Father and I used  to go on the river at Marlow before we were married.\"    \"And the dear, darling, ducky baby,\" said Bobbie; \"it let me nurse it  for ages and ages--and it WAS so good. Mother, I wish we had a baby to  play with.\"    \"And everybody was so nice to us,\" said Phyllis, \"everybody we met. And  they say we may fish whenever we like. And Bill is going to show us the  way next time he's in these parts. He says we don't know really.\"    \"He said YOU didn't know,\" said Peter; \"but, Mother, he said he'd tell  all the bargees up and down the canal that we were the real, right sort,  and they were to treat us like good pals, as we were.\"    \"So then I said,\" Phyllis interrupted, \"we'd always each wear a red  ribbon when we went fishing by the canal, so they'd know it was US, and  we were the real, right sort, and be nice to us!\"    \"So you've made another lot of friends,\" said Mother; \"first the railway  and then the canal!\"    \"Oh, yes,\" said Bobbie; \"I think everyone in the world is friends if you  can only get them to see you don't want to be UN-friends.\"    \"Perhaps you're right,\" said Mother; and she sighed. \"Come, Chicks. It's  bedtime.\"    \"Yes,\" said Phyllis. \"Oh dear--and we went up there to talk about what  we'd do for Perks's birthday. And we haven't talked a single thing about  it!\"    \"No more we have,\" said Bobbie; \"but Peter's saved Reginald Horace's  life. I think that's about good enough for one evening.\"    \"Bobbie would have saved him if I hadn't knocked her down; twice I did,\"  said Peter, loyally.    \"So would I,\" said Phyllis, \"if I'd known what to do.\"    \"Yes,\" said Mother, \"you've saved a little child's life. I do think  that's enough for one evening. Oh, my darlings, thank God YOU'RE all  safe!\"        Chapter IX. The pride of Perks.      It was breakfast-time. Mother's face was very bright as she poured the  milk and ladled out the porridge.    \"I've sold another story, Chickies,\" she said; \"the one about the King  of the Mussels, so there'll be buns for tea. You can go and get them as  soon as they're baked. About eleven, isn't it?\"    Peter, Phyllis, and Bobbie exchanged glances with each other, six  glances in all. Then Bobbie said:--    \"Mother, would you mind if we didn't have the buns for tea to-night, but  on the fifteenth? That's next Thursday.\"    \"_I_ don't mind when you have them, dear,\" said Mother, \"but why?\"    \"Because it's Perks's birthday,\" said Bobbie; \"he's thirty-two, and  he says he doesn't keep his birthday any more, because he's got other  things to keep--not rabbits or secrets--but the kids and the missus.\"    \"You mean his wife and children,\" said Mother.    \"Yes,\" said Phyllis; \"it's the same thing, isn't it?\"    \"And we thought we'd make a nice birthday for him. He's been so awfully  jolly decent to us, you know, Mother,\" said Peter, \"and we agreed that  next bun-day we'd ask you if we could.\"    \"But suppose there hadn't been a bun-day before the fifteenth?\" said  Mother.    \"Oh, then, we meant to ask you to let us anti--antipate it, and go  without when the bun-day came.\"    \"Anticipate,\" said Mother. \"I see. Certainly. It would be nice to put  his name on the buns with pink sugar, wouldn't it?\"    \"Perks,\" said Peter, \"it's not a pretty name.\"    \"His other name's Albert,\" said Phyllis; \"I asked him once.\"    \"We might put A. P.,\" said Mother; \"I'll show you how when the day  comes.\"    This was all very well as far as it went. But even fourteen halfpenny  buns with A. P. on them in pink sugar do not of themselves make a very  grand celebration.    \"There are always flowers, of course,\" said Bobbie, later, when a really  earnest council was being held on the subject in the hay-loft where  the broken chaff-cutting machine was, and the row of holes to drop hay  through into the hay-racks over the mangers of the stables below.    \"He's got lots of flowers of his own,\" said Peter.    \"But it's always nice to have them given you,\" said Bobbie, \"however  many you've got of your own. We can use flowers for trimmings to the  birthday. But there must be something to trim besides buns.\"    \"Let's all be quiet and think,\" said Phyllis; \"no one's to speak until  it's thought of something.\"    So they were all quiet and so very still that a brown rat thought that  there was no one in the loft and came out very boldly. When Bobbie  sneezed, the rat was quite shocked and hurried away, for he saw that a  hay-loft where such things could happen was no place for a respectable  middle-aged rat that liked a quiet life.    \"Hooray!\" cried Peter, suddenly, \"I've got it.\" He jumped up and kicked  at the loose hay.    \"What?\" said the others, eagerly.    \"Why, Perks is so nice to everybody. There must be lots of people in the  village who'd like to help to make him a birthday. Let's go round and  ask everybody.\"    \"Mother said we weren't to ask people for things,\" said Bobbie,  doubtfully.    \"For ourselves, she meant, silly, not for other people. I'll ask the old  gentleman too. You see if I don't,\" said Peter.    \"Let's ask Mother first,\" said Bobbie.    \"Oh, what's the use of bothering Mother about every little thing?\"  said Peter, \"especially when she's busy. Come on. Let's go down to the  village now and begin.\"    So they went. The old lady at the Post-office said she didn't see why  Perks should have a birthday any more than anyone else.    \"No,\""]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18751"],[0,"A Text-book of Assaying: For the Use of Those Connected with Mines.

The answer is, 7.8769 grams must be taken.    As a sample of another class of problem similar in nature to the last  (but a little more complicated) take the following:--\"What weight of  permanganate of potash must be taken to make 2 litres of a solution, 100  c.c. of which shall be equivalent to 1 gram of iron?\" In the first place  the 2 litres must be equivalent to 20 grams of iron, for there are 20 ×  100 c.c. in two litres. In the titration of iron by permanganate  solution there are two reactions. First in dissolving the iron    Fe + H_{2}SO_{4} = FeSO_{4} + H_{2}   |   V   56    and second, in the actual titration,    10FeSO_{4} + 2KMnO_{4} + 9H_{2}SO_{4}= 2MnSO_{4}                 |       + 5Fe_{2}(SO_{4})_{3} + 2KHSO_{4} + 8H_{2}O                 V               K = 39              Mn = 55            O_{4}= 64                  ---                  158 × 2 = 316    As before, attention is confined to the two substances under  consideration--viz., Fe and KMnO_{4}. In the second equation, we find  316 parts of the permanganate are required for 10 molecules of FeSO_{4};  and in the first equation 56 parts of iron are equivalent to one  molecule of FeSO_{4}, therefore 560 of iron are equivalent to 316 of  permanganate; and the question is, How much of the permanganate will be  equivalent to 20 grams of iron?            560 : 316 :: 20 grams : _x_.                                  _x_= 11.286 grams.    The answer is 11.286 grams.    Very similar to this last problem is the question suggested under the  head \"Indirect Titration\" (p. 43). \"If 100 c.c. of the standard  permanganate solution are equivalent to 1 gram of iron, how much  peroxide of manganese will they be equivalent to?\" The equation for  dissolving the iron is already given; the second equation is    2FeSO_{4} + MnO_{2} + 2H_{2}SO_{4}                |      = Fe_{2}(SO_{4})_{2} + MnSO_{4} + 2H_{2}O                |                V             Mn = 55          O_{2} = 32                  --                  87    It will be seen that 87 grams of peroxide of manganese are equivalent to  112 grams of iron. How much then is equivalent to 1 gram of iron?            112 : 87 :: 1 gram : _x_                               _x_ = 0.7767 gram.    It is sometimes convenient to calculate the formula of a substance from  its analysis. The method of calculating is shown by the following  example. Required the formula of a mineral which gave the following  figures on analysis:--      Cupric oxide (CuO)          10.58    Ferrous oxide (FeO)         15.69    Zinc oxide (ZnO)             0.35    Sulphuric oxide (SO_{2})    28.82    Water (H_{2}O)              44.71                               ------                               100.15    First find the molecular weights of CuO, FeO, &c., and divide the  corresponding percentages by these figures. Thus, CuO = 63.3+16 = 79.3  and 10.58 divided by 79.3 gives 0.1334. Similarly FeO = 56+16 = 72 and  15.69 divided by 72 gives 0.2179. Treated in the same way the oxide of  zinc, sulphuric oxide and water give as results 0.0043, 0.3602 and  2.484.    Classify the results as follows:--        Bases.         Acids.         Water.      CuO 0.1334    SO_{3} 0.3602    H_{2}O 2.484    FeO 0.2179    ZnO 0.0043    ----------    -------------    ------------     RO 0.3556    RO_{3} 0.3602    R_{2}O 2.484    The figures 0.3556, 0.3602 and 2.484 should be then divided by the  lowest of them--_i.e._, 0.3556; or where, as in this case, two of the  figures are very near each other the mean of these may be taken--_i.e._,  0.3579. Whichever is taken the figures got will be approximately 1, 1  and 7. The formula is then RO.SO_{3}.7H_{2}O in which R is nearly 2/5ths  copper, 3/5ths iron and a little zinc.    This formula requires the following percentage composition, which for  the sake of comparison is placed side by side with the actual results.                     Calculated.   Found.    Cupric oxide     11.29       10.58    Ferrous oxide    15.37       15.69    Zinc oxide        nil         0.35    Sulphuric oxide  28.47       28.82    Water            44.84       44.71                     -----      ------                     99.97      100.15    Trimming the results of an analysis to make them fit in more closely  with the calculations from the formula would be foolish as well as  dishonest. There can be no doubt that the actual analytical results  represent the composition of the specimen much more closely than the  formula does; although perhaps other specimens of the same mineral would  yield results which would group themselves better around the calculated  results than around those of the first specimen analysed. It must be  remembered that substances are rarely found pure either in nature or in  the arts; so that in most cases the formula only gives an approximation  to the truth. In the case of hydrated salts there is generally a  difficulty in getting the salt with exactly the right proportion of  water.      PRACTICAL EXERCISES.    The following calculations may be made:--    1. Calculate standards in the following cases--    (a) Silver taken, 1.003 gram. Standard salt used, 100.15 c.c.    (b) Iron taken, 0.7 gram. Bichromate used, 69.6 c.c.    2. Calculate percentages:--    (a) Ore taken, 1 gram. Solution used, 65.2 c.c. Standard, 0.987      gram.      (b) Ore taken, 1 gram. Barium sulphate got, 1.432 gram. Barium      sulphate contains 13.73 per cent. of sulphur, and the percentage      of sulphur in the ore is wanted.      (c) Barium sulphate is BaSO_{4}. Calculate the percentage of sulphur      it contains, for use in the preceding question.    3.  A method of estimating the quantity of peroxide in a manganese ore  is based on the following reactions:--        (1) MnO_{2} + 4HCl = MnCl_{2} + Cl_{2} + 2H_{2}O.        (2) Cl + KI = KCl + I.    To how much MnO_{2} is 1 gram of Iodine (I) equivalent?    4. A mineral has the following composition:--      Carbonic acid (CO_{2})     19.09    Copper oxide (CuO)         71.46    Water (H_{2}O)              9.02    What is its formula?    5. How much copper is contained in 1.5 gram of crystallized copper  sulphate (CuSO_{4}.5H_{2}O)? How much of these crystals must be taken to  give 0.4 gram of copper?    6. How much ferrous sulphate crystals (FeSO_{4}.7H_{2}O) must be taken  to yield 2 litres of a solution, 100 c.c. of which shall contain 0.56  gram of iron?    7. Galena is PbS, and hæmatite Fe_{2}O_{3}. What percentages of metal do  these minerals contain?          CHAPTER VIII.    SPECIFIC GRAVITY.      The relation of the weight of a substance to its volume should be kept  in mind in all cases where both weight and volume are dealt with.  Students are apt to imagine that on mixing equal volumes of, say,  sulphuric acid and water, an acid of half the strength must be obtained.  If the statement of strength is in parts by weight this will lead to  considerable error. For example, 100 c.c. of sulphuric acid containing  98 per cent. by weight of real acid, will, if diluted with 100 c.c. of  water, yield a solution containing not 49 per cent. by weight, but about  63.5 per cent. of the acid. The reason is this: the 100 c.c. of  sulphuric acid weighs 184 grams, and contains 180.32 grams of real acid,  while the 100 c.c. of water weighs only 100 grams; the mixed water and  acid weighs 284 grams, and contains 180.32 of real acid, which is  equivalent to nearly 63.5 per cent. by weight. If, however, the method  of statement be volumetric, it would be correct to say that doubling the  volume halves the strength: if 100 c.c. of brine contains 10 grams of  salt, and is diluted with water to 200 c.c., it would be of one-half the  former strength, that is, 100 c.c. of the solution would contain 5 grams  of salt.    This confusion is avoided by always stating the strengths as so many  grams or \"c.c.\" in 100 c.c. of the liquid. But obviously it would be  advantageous to be able to determine quickly the weight of any  particular substance corresponding to 1 c.c. or some other given volume.  Moreover, in descriptions of processes the strengths of acids and  solutions are frequently defined neither by their gravimetric nor  volumetric composition, but by a statement either of specific gravity or  of the degrees registered by Twaddell's or Beaumé's hydrometer. Thus, in  the description of the process of gold parting, one writer gives: \"The  acid should be of 1.2 specific gravity\"; and another says: \"The acid  must not be stronger than 32° Beaumé.\"    These considerations justify an account of the subject in such a work as  this. And on other grounds the determination of a specific gravity is  one of the operations with which an assayer should be familiar.    The meaning of \"specific gravity\" is present in the mind of every one  who uses the sentence \"lead is heavier than water.\" This is meaningless  except some such phrase as \"bulk for bulk\" be added. Make the sentence  quantitative by saying: \"bulk for bulk lead is 11.36 times heavier than  water,\" and one has the exact meaning of: \"the specific gravity of lead  is 11.36.\" A table of the specific gravities of liquids and solids shows  how many times heavier the substances are than water.    It is better, however, to look upon the specific gravity (written  shortly, sp. g.) as the weight of a substance divided by its volume. In  the metric system, 1 c.c. of water at 4° C. weighs with sufficient  exactness 1 gram; consequently, the sp. g., which states how many times  heavier than water the substance is, also expresses the weight in grams  of one c.c. of it. So that if a 100 c.c. flask of nitric acid weighs,  after the weight of "]]]
