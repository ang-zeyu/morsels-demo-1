It was claimed by the lord of  the fee where the fair or market was held, by virtue of a grant  from the Crown either ostensible or presumed] and passage [money  paid for crossing a river or for crossing the sea as might be  due to the Crown] and all custom [customary payments] throughout  my whole land of England, Normandy, and Wales, wherever they  shall come, they and their goods. Wherefore I will and strictly  command, that they shall have all their liberties and  acquittances and free customs fully and honorable, as my free  and faithful men, and that they shall be quit of toll and  passage and of every other customs: and I forbid any one to  disturb them on this account contrary to this my charter, on  forfeiture of ten pounds [200s.].\"    John, when he was an earl and before he became King, granted  these liberties to Bristol about 1188:    1) No burgess may sue or be sued out of Bristol.    2) The burgesses are excused from the murder fine (imposed by the  King or lord from the hundred or town where the murder was  committed when the murderer had not been apprehended).    3) No burgess may wage duel, unless sued for death of a stranger.    4) No one may take possession of a lodging house by assignment  or by livery of the Marshall of the Earl of Gloucester against  the will of the burgesses (so that the town would not be  responsible for the good behavior of a stranger lodging in the  town without first accepting the possessor of the lodging house).    5) No one shall be condemned in a matter of money, unless  according to the law of the hundred, that is, forfeiture of 40s.    6) The hundred court shall be held only once a week.    7) No one in any plea may argue his cause in miskenning.    8) They may lawfully have their lands and tenures and mortgages  and debts throughout my whole land, [from] whoever owes them  [anything].    9) With regard to debts which have been lent in Bristol, and  mortgages theremade, pleas shall be held in the town according  to the custom of the town.    10) If any one in any other place in my land shall take toll of  the men of Bristol, if he does not restore it after he is  required to, the Prepositor of Bristol may take from him a  distress at Bristol, and force him to restore it.    11) No stranger-tradesman may buy within the town from a man who  is a stranger, leather, grain, or wool, but only from a burgess.    12) No stranger may have a shop, including one for selling wine,  unless in a ship, nor shall sell cloth for cutting except at the  fair.    13) No stranger may remain in the town with his goods for the  purpose of selling his goods, but for forty days.    14) No burgess may be confined or distrained any where else  within my land or power for any debt, unless he is a debtor or  surety (to avoid a person owed a debt from distraining another  person of the town of the debtor).    15) They shall be able to marry themselves, their sons, their  daughters and their widows, without the license of their lords.  (Lords had the right of preventing their tenants and mesne lords  and their families from marrying without his consent.)    16) No one of their lords shall have the wardship or the disposal  of their sons or daughters on account of their lands out of the  town, but only the wardship of their tenements which belong to  their own fee, until they become of age.    17) There shall be no recognition [acknowledgement that something  done by another person in one's name had one's authority] in the  town.    18) No one shall take tyne [wooden barrel with a certain quantity  of ale, payable by the townsmen to the constable for the use of  the castle] unless for the use of the lord Earl, and that  according to the custom of the town.    19) They may grind their grain wherever they may choose.    20) They may have their reasonable guilds, as well or better than  they had themin the time of Robert and his son William [John's  wife's grandfather and father, who were earls of Gloucester when  the town and castle of Bristol were part of the honor of  Gloucester].    21) No burgess may be compelled to bail any man, unless he  himself chooses it, although he may be dwelling on his land.    We have also granted to them all their tenures, messuages, in  copses, in buildings on the water or elsewhere to be held in  free burgage [tenant to pay only certain fixed services or  payments to his lord, but not military service (like free  socage)]. We have granted also that any of them may make  improvements as much as he can in erecting buildings anywhere on  the bank and elsewhere, as long as the borough and town are not  damaged thereby. Also, they shall have and possess all waste  land and void grounds and places, to be built on at their  pleasure.    Newcastle-on-Tyne's taxes were simplified in 1175 as follows:    \"Know ye that I have granted and by this present charter have  confirmed to my burgesses of Newcastle upon Tyne, and to all  their things which they can assure to be their own, acquittance  from toll and passage and pontage and from the Hanse and from  all other customs throughout all my land. And I prohibit all  persons from vexing or disturbing them therein upon forfeiture to  me.\"    We grant to our upright men on Newcastle-on-Tyne and their heirs  our town of Newcastle-on-Tyne with all its appurtances at fee  farm for 100 pounds to be rendered yearly to us and our heirs at  our Exchequer by their own hand at the two terms, to wit, at  Easter 50 pounds and at Michaelmas 50 pounds, saving to us our  rents and prizes and assizes in the port of the same town.    Ranulph, earl of Chester, made grants to his burgesses of  Coventry by this charter: \"That the aforesaid burgesses and  their heirs may well and honorably quietly and in free burgage  hold of me and my heirs as ever in the time of my father and  others of my ancestors they have held better more firmly and  freer. In the second place I grant to them all the free and good  laws which the burgesses of Lincoln have better and freer. I  prohibit and forbid my constables to draw them into the castle  to plead for any cause, but they may freely have their portimote  [leet court] in which all pleas belonging to me and them may be  justly treated of. Moreover they may choose from themselves one  to act for me whom I approve, who a justice under me and over  them may know the laws and customs, and keep them to my counsel  in all things reasonable, every excuse put away, and may  faithfully perform to me my rights. If any one happen to fall  into my amercement he may be reasonably fined by my bailiff and  the faithful burgesses of the court. Furthermore, whatever  merchants they have brought with them for the improvement of the  town, I command that they have peace, and that none do them  injury or unjustly send them into court. But if any foreign  merchant shall have done anything improper in the town that same  may be regulated in the portimote before the aforesaid justice  without a suit at law.\"    Henry confirmed this charter of the earl's by 1189 as follows: I  have confirmed all the liberties and free customs the earl of  Chester granted to them, namely, that the same burgesses may  well and honorably hold in free burgage, as ever in the time of  the father of the beforesaid earl, or other of his ancestors,  they may have better or more firmly held; and they may have all  the laws and customs which the citizens of Lincoln have better  and freer [e.g. their merchant guilds; all men brought to trade  may be subject to the guild customs and assize of the town;  those who lawfully hold land in the town for a year and a day  without question and are able to prove that an accuser has been  in the kingdom within the year without finding fault with them,  from thence may hold the land well and in peace without  pleading; those who have remained in the town a year and a day  without question, and have submitted to the customs of the town  and the citizens of the town are able to show through the laws  and customs of the town that the accuser stood forth in the  kingdom, and not a fault is found of them, then they may remain  in peace in the town without question]; and that the constable of  the aforesaid earl shall not bring them into the castle to plead  in any case. But they may freely have their own portmanmote in  which all pleas appertaining to the earl and to them may be  justly treated of. Moreover they may choose one from themselves  to act for the earl, whom I approve, who may be a justice under  the earl and over them, and who to the earl may faithfully  perform his rights, and if anyone happen to fall into the earl's  forfeiture he shall be acquit for 12 pence. If by the testimony  of his neighbors he cannot pay 12 pence coins, by their advice  it shall be so settled as he is able to pay, and besides, with  other acquittances, that the burgesses shall not provide anything  in corrody [allowance in food] or otherwise whether for the  said earl or his men, unless upon condition that their chattels  shall be safe, and so rendered to them.    Furthermore, whatever merchants they have brought with them for  the improvement of the town they may have peace, and none shall  do them injury or unjustly send them into suit at law. But if  any foreign merchant has done anything improper in the town that  shall be amended [or tried] in the portmanmote before the  aforesaid justice without a suit. And they who may be newcomers  into the town, from the day on which they began to build in the  town for the space of two years shall be acquit of all charges."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16940"],[0,"Gleanings from the Writings of Bahá'u'lláh (#20)"],[1," and over their  transgressions and their total disregard of the thing for which they were  created. This is what We observed in that City, and which We have chosen  to note down in Our Book, that it may serve as a warning unto them, and  unto the rest of mankind.    Say: If ye be seekers after this life and the vanities thereof, ye should  have sought them while ye were still enclosed in your mothers' wombs, for  at that time ye were continually approaching them, could ye but perceive  it. Ye have, on the other hand, ever since ye were born and attained  maturity, been all the while receding from the world and drawing closer to  dust. Why, then, exhibit such greed in amassing the treasures of the  earth, when your days are numbered and your chance is well-nigh lost? Will  ye not, then, O heedless ones, shake off your slumber?    Incline your ears to the counsels which this Servant giveth you for the  sake of God. He, verily, asketh no recompense from you and is resigned to  what God hath ordained for Him, and is entirely submissive to God's Will.    The days of your life are far spent, O people, and your end is fast  approaching. Put away, therefore, the things ye have devised and to which  ye cleave, and take firm hold on the precepts of God, that haply ye may  attain that which He hath purposed for you, and be of them that pursue a  right course. Delight not yourselves in the things of the world and its  vain ornaments, neither set your hopes on them. Let your reliance be on  the remembrance of God, the Most Exalted, the Most Great. He will,  erelong, bring to naught all the things ye possess. Let Him be your fear,  and forget not His covenant with you, and be not of them that are shut out  as by a veil from Him.    Beware that ye swell not with pride before God, and disdainfully reject  His loved ones. Defer ye humbly to the faithful, they that have believed  in God and in His signs, whose hearts witness to His unity, whose tongues  proclaim His oneness, and who speak not except by His leave. Thus do We  exhort you with justice, and warn you with truth, that perchance ye may be  awakened.    Lay not on any soul a load which ye would not wish to be laid upon you,  and desire not for any one the things ye would not desire for yourselves.  This is My best counsel unto you, did ye but observe it.    Respect ye the divines and learned amongst you, they whose conduct accords  with their professions, who transgress not the bounds which God hath  fixed, whose judgments are in conformity with His behests as revealed in  His Book. Know ye that they are the lamps of guidance unto them that are  in the heavens and on the earth. They who disregard and neglect the  divines and learned that live amongst them--these have truly changed the  favor with which God hath favored them.    Say: Await ye till God will have changed His favor unto you. Nothing  whatsoever escapeth Him. He knoweth the secrets both of the heavens and of  the earth. His knowledge embraceth all things. Rejoice not in what ye have  done, or will do in the future, nor delight in the tribulation with which  ye have afflicted Us, for ye are unable by such means as these to exalt  your stations, were ye to examine your works with acute discernment.  Neither will ye be capable of detracting from the loftiness of Our state.  Nay, God will add unto the recompense with which He shall reward Us, for  having sustained with persevering patience the tribulations We have  suffered. He, verily, shall increase the reward of them that endure with  patience.    Know ye that trials and tribulations have, from time immemorial, been the  lot of the chosen Ones of God and His beloved, and such of His servants as  are detached from all else but Him, they whom neither merchandise nor  traffic beguile from the remembrance of the Almighty, they that speak not  till He hath spoken, and act according to His commandment. Such is God's  method carried into effect of old, and such will it remain in the future.  Blessed are the steadfastly enduring, they that are patient under ills and  hardships, who lament not over anything that befalleth them, and who tread  the path of resignation....    The day is approaching when God will have raised up a people who will call  to remembrance Our days, who will tell the tale of Our trials, who will  demand the restitution of Our rights from them that, without a tittle of  evidence, have treated Us with manifest injustice. God, assuredly,  dominateth the lives of them that wronged Us, and is well aware of their  doings. He will, most certainly, lay hold on them for their sins. He,  verily, is the fiercest of avengers.    Thus have We recounted unto you the tales of the one true God, and sent  down unto you the things He had preordained, that haply ye may ask  forgiveness of Him, may return unto Him, may truly repent, may realize  your misdeeds, may shake off your slumber, may be roused from your  heedlessness, may atone for the things that have escaped you, and be of  them that do good. Let him who will, acknowledge the truth of My words;  and as to him that willeth not, let him turn aside. My sole duty is to  remind you of your failure in duty towards the Cause of God, if perchance  ye may be of them that heed My warning. Wherefore, hearken ye unto My  speech, and return ye to God and repent, that He, through His grace, may  have mercy upon you, may wash away your sins, and forgive your trespasses.  The greatness of His mercy surpasseth the fury of His wrath, and His grace  encompasseth all who have been called into being and been clothed with the  robe of life, be they of the past or of the future.            LXVII: THERE HATH APPEARED IN THIS REVELATION...      There hath appeared in this Revelation what hath never appeared before. As  to the infidels that have witnessed what hath been manifested, they murmur  and say: \"Verily, this is a sorcerer who hath devised a lie against God.\"  They are indeed an outcast people.    Tell out to the nations, O Pen of the Ancient of Days, the things that  have happened in 'Iraq. Tell them of the messenger whom the congregation  of the divines of that land had delegated to meet Us, who, when attaining  Our presence, questioned Us concerning certain sciences, and whom We  answered by virtue of the knowledge We inherently possess. Thy Lord is,  verily, the Knower of things unseen. \"We testify,\" said he, \"that the  knowledge Thou dost possess is such as none can rival. Such a knowledge,  however, is insufficient to vindicate the exalted station which the people  ascribe to Thee. Produce, if Thou speakest the truth, what the combined  forces of the peoples of the earth are powerless to produce.\" Thus was it  irrevocably decreed in the court of the presence of thy Lord, the  All-Glorious, the Loving.    \"Witness! What is it thou seest?\" He was dumbfounded. And when he came to  himself, he said: \"I truly believe in God, the All-Glorious, the  All-Praised.\" \"Go thou to the people, and tell them: 'Ask whatsoever ye  please. Powerful is He to do what He willeth. Nothing whatsoever, be it of  the past or of the future, can frustrate His Will.' Say: 'O ye  congregation of the divines! Choose any matter ye desire, and ask your  Lord, the God of Mercy, to reveal it unto you. If He fulfil your wish, by  virtue of His sovereignty, believe ye then in Him, and be not of those  that reject His truth.'\" \"The dawn of understanding hath now broken,\" said  he, \"and the testimony of the All-Merciful is fulfilled.\" He arose and  returned unto them that sent him, at the bidding of God, the All-Glorious,  the Well-Beloved.    Days passed and he failed to come back to Us. Eventually, there came  another messenger who informed Us that the people had given up what they  originally had purposed. They are indeed a contemptible people. This is  what happened in 'Iraq, and to what I reveal I Myself am witness. This  happening was noised abroad, yet none was found to comprehend its meaning.  Thus did We ordain it. Would that ye knew this!    By My Self! Whoso hath in bygone ages asked Us to produce the signs of  God, hath, no sooner We revealed them to him, repudiated God's truth. The  people, however, have, for the most part, remained heedless. They whose  eyes are illumined with the light of understanding will perceive the sweet  savors of the All-Merciful, and will embrace His truth. These are they who  are truly sincere.            LXVIII: O THOU WHO ART THE FRUIT OF MY TREE AND...      O thou who art the fruit of My Tree and the leaf thereof! On thee be My  glory and My mercy. Let not thine heart grieve over what hath befallen  thee. Wert thou to scan the pages of the Book of Life, thou wouldst, most  certainly, discover that which would dissipate thy sorrows and dissolve  thine anguish.    Know thou, O fruit of My Tree, that the decrees of the Sovereign Ordainer,  as related to fate and predestination, are of two kinds. Both are to be  obeyed and accepted. The one is irrevocable, the other is, as termed by  men, impending. To the former all must unreservedly submit, inasmuch as it  is fixed and settled. God, however, is able to alter or repeal it. As the  harm that must result from such a change will be greater than if the  decree had remained unaltered, all, therefore, should willingly acquiesce  in what God hath willed and confidently abide by the same.    The decree that is impending, however, is such that prayer and entreaty  can succeed in averting it.    God grant that thou who art the fruit of My Tree, and they that are  associated with thee, may be shielded from its evil consequences.    Say: O God, my God! Thou hast committed into mine hands a trust from Thee,  and hast now according to the good-pleasure of Thy Will called it back to  Thyself. It is not for me, who am a handmaid of Thine, to say, whence is  this to me or wherefore hath it happened, inasmuch as Thou art glorified  in all Thine acts, and art to be obeyed in Thy "]]]
