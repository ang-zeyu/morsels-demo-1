Anthony (#20)"],[1,"  *       *       *    Divorce had been much in the news because several leading families in  America and in England were involved in lawsuits complicated by  stringent divorce laws. Invariably the wife bore the burden of censure  and hardship, for no matter how unprincipled her husband might be, he  was entitled to her children and her earnings under the property laws  of most states.    In New York efforts were now being made to gain support for a liberal  divorce bill, patterned after the Indiana law, and a variety of  proposals were before the legislature, making drunkenness, insanity,  desertion, and cruel and abusive treatment grounds for divorce. Horace  Greeley in his _Tribune_ had been vigorously opposing a more liberal  law for New York, while Robert Dale Owen of Indiana wrote in its  defense. Everywhere people were reading the Greeley-Owen debates in  the _Tribune_. Through his widely circulated paper, Horace Greeley had  in a sense become an oracle for the people who felt he was safe and  good; while Robert Dale Owen, because of his youthful association with  the New Harmony community and Frances Wright, was branded with  radicalism which even his valuable service in the Indiana legislature  and his two terms in Congress could not blot out.    Susan and Mrs. Stanton had no patience with Horace Greeley's smug  old-fashioned opinions on marriage and divorce. In fact these  Greeley-Owen debates in the _Tribune_ were the direct cause of their  decision to bring this subject before the convention, where they hoped  for support from their liberal friends. They counted especially on  Lucy Stone, who seemed to give her approval when she wrote, \"I am glad  you will speak on the divorce question, provided you yourself are  clear on the subject. It is a great grave topic that one shudders to  grapple, but its hour is coming.... God touch your lips if you speak  on it.\"[110]    Neither Susan nor Mrs. Stanton shuddered to grapple with any subject  which they believed needed attention. In fact, the discussion of  marriage and divorce in woman's rights conventions had been on their  minds for some time. Three years before Susan had written Lucy, \"I  have thought with you until of late that the Social Question must be  kept separate from Woman's Rights, but we have always claimed that our  movement was _Human Rights_, not Woman's specially.... It seems to me  we have played on the surface of things quite long enough. Getting the  right to hold property, to vote, to wear what dress we please, etc.,  are all to the good, but _Social Freedom_, after all, lies at the  bottom of all, and unless woman gets that she must continue the slave  of man in all other things.\"[111]           *       *       *       *       *    Consternation spread through the genial ranks of the convention as  Mrs. Stanton now offered resolutions calling for more liberal divorce  laws. Quick to sense the temper of an audience, Susan felt its  resistance to being jolted out of the pleasant contemplation of past  successes to the unpleasant recognition that there were still  difficult ugly problems ahead. She was conscious at once of a stir of  astonishment and disapproval when Mrs. Stanton in her clear compelling  voice read, \"Resolved, That an unfortunate or ill-assorted marriage is  ever a calamity, but not ever, perhaps never a crime--and when society  or government, by its laws or customs, compels its continuance, always  to the grief of one of the parties, and the actual loss and damage of  both, it usurps an authority never delegated to man, nor exercised by  God, Himself....\"[112]    Listening to Mrs. Stanton's speech in defense of her ten bold  resolutions on marriage and divorce, Susan felt that her brave  colleague was speaking for women everywhere, for wives of the present  and the future. As the hearty applause rang out, she concluded that  even the disapproving admired her courage; but before the applause  ceased, she saw Antoinette Blackwell on her feet, waiting to be heard.  She knew that Antoinette, like Horace Greeley, preferred to think of  all marriages as made in heaven, and true to form Antoinette contended  that the marriage relation \"must be lifelong\" and \"as permanent and  indissoluble as the relation of parent and child.\"[113] At once  Ernestine Rose came to the rescue in support of Mrs. Stanton.    Then Wendell Phillips showed his displeasure by moving that Mrs.  Stanton's resolutions be laid on the table and expunged from the  record because they had no more to do with this convention than  slavery in Kansas or temperance. \"This convention,\" he asserted, \"as I  understand it, assembles to discuss the laws that rest unequally upon  men and women, not those that rest equally on men and women.\"[114]    Aghast at this statement, Susan was totally unprepared to have his  views supported by that other champion of liberty, William Lloyd  Garrison, who, however, did not favor expunging the resolutions from  the record.    It was incomprehensible to Susan that neither Garrison nor Phillips  recognized woman's subservient status in marriage under prevailing  laws and traditions, and she now stated her own views with firmness:  \"As to the point that this question does not belong to this  platform--from that I totally dissent. Marriage has ever been a  one-sided matter, resting most unequally upon the sexes. By it, man  gains all--woman loses all; tyrant law and lust reign supreme with  him--meek submission and ready obedience alone befit her.\"[115]    Warming to the subject, she continued, \"By law, public sentiment, and  religion from the time of Moses down to the present day, woman has  never been thought of other than as a piece of property, to be  disposed of at the will and pleasure of man. And this very hour, by  our statute books, by our so-called enlightened Christian  civilization, she has no voice in saying what shall be the basis of  the relation. She must accept marriage as man proffers it or not at  all....\"    When finally the vote was taken, Mrs. Stanton's resolutions were laid  on the table, but not expunged from the record, and the convention  adjourned with much to talk about and think about for some time to  come.    The newspapers, of course, could not overlook such a piece of news as  this heated argument on divorce in a woman's rights convention, and  fanned the flames pro and con, most of them holding up Miss Anthony  and Mrs. Stanton as dangerous examples of freedom for women. The Rev.  A. D. Mayo, Unitarian clergyman of Albany, heretofore Susan's loyal  champion, now made a point of reproving her. \"You are not married,\" he  declared with withering scorn. \"You have no business to be discussing  marriage.\" To this she retorted, \"Well, Mr. Mayo, you are not a  slave. Suppose you quit lecturing on slavery.\"[116]    Both Susan and Mrs. Stanton, amazed at the opposition and the  disapproval they had aroused, were grateful for Samuel Longfellow's  comforting words of commendation[117] and for the letters of approval  which came from women from all parts of the state. Most satisfying of  all was this reassurance from Lucretia Mott, whose judgment they so  highly valued: \"I was rejoiced to have such a defense of the  resolutions as yours. I have the fullest confidence in the united  judgment of Elizabeth Stanton and Susan Anthony and I am glad they are  so vigorous in the work.\"[118]    Hardest to bear was the disapproval of Wendell Phillips whom they both  admired so much. Difficult to understand and most disappointing was  Lucy Stone's failure to attend the convention or come to their  defense. Thinking over this first unfortunate difference of opinion  among the faithful crusaders for freedom to whom she had always felt  so close in spirit, Susan was sadly disillusioned, but she had no  regrets that the matter had been brought up, and she defied her  critics by speaking before a committee of the New York legislature in  support of a liberal divorce bill. Nor was she surprised when a group  of Boston women, headed by Caroline H. Dall, called a convention which  they hoped would counteract this radical outbreak in the woman's  rights movement by keeping to the safe subjects of education,  vocation, and civil position.    Having learned by this time through the hard school of experience that  the bona-fide reformer could not play safe and go forward, Susan  thoughtfully commented, \"Cautious, careful people, always casting  about to preserve their reputation and social standing, never can  bring about a reform. Those who are really in earnest must be willing  to be anything or nothing in the world's estimation, and publicly and  privately, in season and out, avow their sympathy with despised and  persecuted ideas and their advocates, and bear the consequences.\"[119]           *       *       *       *       *    The repercussions of the divorce debates were soon drowned out by the  noise and excitement of the presidential campaign of 1860. With four  candidates in the field, Breckenridge, Bell, Douglas, and Lincoln,  each offering his party's solution for the nation's critical problems,  there was much to think about and discuss, and Susan found woman's  rights pushed into the background. At the same time antagonism toward  abolitionists was steadily mounting for they were being blamed for the  tensions between the North and the South.    Dedicated to the immediate and unconditional emancipation of slavery,  Susan saw no hope in the promises of any political party. Even the  Republicans' opposition to the extension of slavery in the  territories, which had won over many abolitionists, including Henry  and Elizabeth Stanton, seemed to her a mild and ineffectual answer to  the burning questions of the hour. For her to further the election of  Abraham Lincoln was unthinkable, since he favored the enforcement of  the Fugitive Slave Law and had stated he was not in favor of Negro  citizenship.

He who  had but the money in hand might readily defraud his poorer neighbour  in the name of law and right. \"Woe is me!\" exclaims one author, \"in  my home there is but one procurator, and yet is the whole country  round about brought into confusion by his wiles. What a misery will  this horde bring upon us!\" Everywhere was complaint and in many places  resistance.    As early as 1460 we find the Bavarian estates vigorously complaining  that all the courts were in the hands of doctors. They demanded that  the rights of the land and the ancient custom should not be cast  aside; but that the courts as of old should be served by reasonable  and honest judges, who should be men of the same feudal livery and of  the same country as those whom they tried. Again in 1514, when the  evil had become still more crying, we find the estates of Wuertemberg  petitioning Duke Ulrich that the Supreme Court \"shall be composed of  honourable, worthy, and understanding men of the nobles and of the  towns, who shall not be doctors, to the intent that the ancient usages  and customs should abide, and that it should be judged according to  them in such wise that the poor man might no longer be brought to  confusion.\" In many covenants of the end of the fifteenth century,  express stipulation is made that they should not be interpreted by a  doctor or licentiate, and also in some cases that no such doctor or  licentiate should be permitted to reside or to exercise his  profession within certain districts. Great as was the economical  influence of the new jurists in the tribunals, their political  influence in the various courts of the empire, from the  _Reichskammergericht_ downwards, was, if anything, greater. Says  Wimpfeling, the first writer on the art of education in the modern  world: \"According to the loathsome doctrines of the new jurisconsults,  the prince shall be everything in the land and the people naught. The  people shall only obey, pay tax, and do service. Moreover, they shall  not alone obey the prince but also them that he has placed in  authority, who begin to puff themselves up as the proper lords of the  land, and to order matters so that the princes themselves do as little  as may be reign.\" From this passage it will be seen that the modern  bureaucratic State, in which government is as nearly as possible  reduced to mechanism and the personal relation abolished, was ushered  in under the auspices of the civil law. How easy it was for the  civilian to effect the abolition of feudal institutions may be readily  imagined by those cognizant of the principles of Roman law. For  example, the Roman law, of course, making no mention of the right of  the mediaeval \"estates\" to be consulted in the levying of taxes or in  other questions, the jurist would explain this right to his too  willing master, the prince, as an abuse which had no legal  justification, and which, the sooner it were abolished in the interest  of good government the better it would be. All feudal rights as  against the power of an overlord were explained away by the civil  jurist, either as pernicious abuses, or, at best, as favours granted  in the past by the predecessors of the reigning monarch, which it was  within his right to truncate or to abrogate at his will.    From the preceding survey will be clearly perceived the important role  which the new jurisprudence played on the Continent of Europe in the  gestation of the new phase which history was entering upon in the  sixteenth century. Even the short sketch given will be sufficient to  show that it was not in one department only that it operated; but  that, in addition to its own domain of law proper, its influence was  felt in modifying economical, political, and indirectly even ethical  and religious conditions. From this time forth Feudalism slowly but  surely gave place to the newer order, all that remained being certain  of its features, which, crystallized into bureaucratic forms, were  doubly veneered with a last trace of mediaeval ideas and a denser  coating of civilian conceptions. This transitional Europe, and not  mediaeval Europe, was the Europe which lasted on until the eighteenth  century, and which practically came to an end with the French  Revolution.

CHAPTER VI    THE REVOLT OF THE KNIGHTHOOD      We have already pointed out in more than one place the position to  which the smaller nobility, or the knighthood, had been reduced by the  concatenation of causes which was bringing about the dissolution of the  old mediaeval order of things, and, as a consequence, ruining the  knights both economically and politically--economically by the rise of  capitalism as represented by the commercial syndicates of the cities;  by the unprecedented power and wealth of the city confederations,  especially of the Hanseatic League; by the rising importance of the  newly developed world-market; by the growing luxury and the enormous  rise in the prices of commodities concurrently with the reduction in  value of the feudal land-tenures; and by the limitation of the  possibilities of acquiring wealth by highway robbery, owing to Imperial  constitutions, on the one hand, and increased powers of defence on the  part of the trading community, on the other--politically, by the new  modes of warfare in which artillery and infantry, composed of  comparatively well-drilled mercenaries (_Landsknechte_), were rapidly  making inroads into the omnipotence of the ancient feudal chivalry, and  reducing the importance of individual skill or prowess in the handling  of weapons, and by the development of the power of the princes or  higher nobility, partly due to the influence which the Roman civil law  now began to exercise over the older customary Constitution of the  empire, and partly to the budding centralism of authority--which in  France and England became a national centralization, but in Germany, in  spite of the temporary ascendancy of Charles V, finally issued in a  provincial centralization in which the princes were _de facto_  independent monarchs. The Imperial Constitution of 1495, forbidding  private war, applied, it must be remembered, only to the lesser  nobility and not to the higher, thereby placing the former in a  decidedly ignominious position as regards their feudal superiors. And  though this particular enactment had little immediate result, yet it  was none the less resented as a blow struck at the old knightly  privilege.    The mental attitude of the knighthood in the face of this progressing  change in their position was naturally an ambiguous one, composed  partly of a desire to hark back to the haughty independence of  feudalism, and partly of sympathy with the growing discontent among  other classes and with the new spirit generally. In order that the  knights might succeed in recovering their old or even in maintaining  their actual position against the higher nobility, the princes, backed  as these now largely were by the Imperial power, the co-operation of  the cities was absolutely essential to them, but the obstacles in the  way of such a co-operation proved insurmountable. The towns hated the  knights for their lawless practices, which rendered trade unsafe and  not infrequently cost the lives of the citizens. The knights for the  most part, with true feudal hauteur, scorned and despised the artisans  and traders who had no territorial family name and were unexercised in  the higher chivalric arts. The grievances of the two parties were,  moreover, not identical, although they had their origin in the same  causes.    The cities were in the main solely concerned to maintain their old  independent position, and especially to curb the growing disposition  at this time of the other estates to use them as milch cows from  which to draw the taxation necessary to the maintenance of the  empire. For example, at the Reichstag opened at Nuernberg on November  17, 1522--to discuss the questions of the establishment of perpetual  peace within the empire, of organizing an energetic resistance to the  inroads of the Turks, and of placing on a firm foundation the  Imperial Privy Council (_Kammergericht_) and the Supreme Council  (_Reichsregiment_)--at which were represented twenty-six Imperial  towns, thirty-eight high prelates, eighteen princes, and twenty-nine  counts and barons--the representatives of the cities complained  grievously that their attendance was reduced to a farce, since they  were always out-voted, and hence obliged to accept the decisions of  the other estates. They stated that their position was no longer  bearable, and for the first time drew up an Act of Protest, which  further complained of the delay in the decisions of the Imperial  courts; of their sufferings from the right of private war, which was  still allowed to subsist in defiance of the Constitution; of the  increase of customs-stations on the part of the princes and  prince-prelates; and, finally, of the debasement of the coinage due  to the unscrupulous practices of these notables and of the Jews. The  only sympathy the other estates vouchsafed to the plaints of the  cities was with regard to the right of private war, which the higher  nobles were also anxious to suppress amongst the lower, though  without prejudice, of course, to their own privileges in this line.  All the other articles of the Act of Protest were coolly waived  aside. From all this it will be seen that not much co-operation was  to be expected between such heterogeneous bodies as the knighthood  and the free towns, in spite of their common interest in"]]]
