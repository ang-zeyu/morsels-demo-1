Nothing was terrible except that long,  dark body which lay across the entrance to the cave, and she finally got  to her feet and began to explore. She came first on a quantity of dead  grass heaped in a corner that was where Satan was stalled, no doubt, and  it made all the cave seem almost homelike. She found, too, a number of  stones grouped together with ashes in the hollow circle-that was where  the fires were built, and there to the side lay the pile of dead wood. A  little down the cave and directly in the center of the top, she next  saw the natural aperture where the smoke must escape and last of all she  came on the bed. Boughs heaped a foot thick with the blankets on top,  neatly stretched out, and the tarpaulin over all, made a couch as soft  as down and fragrant with the pure scent of evergreens.    Joan tried the surface with a foot that sank to her ankle, then with her  hands, and finally sat down to think. The first fear was almost gone;  she understood that Bart was keeping her here until Dan came home, and  fear does not go hand in hand with understanding. She only wondered,  now, at the reason that kept Daddy Dan living in this cave so far from  the warm comfort of the cabin, and so far away from her mother; but  thinking makes small heads drowsy, and in five minutes Joan lay with her  head pillowed on her arm, sound asleep.    When she awoke, the evening-gray of the cave had given place to utter  blackness, alarming and thick. Joan sat up with a start; she would have  cried out, bewildered, but now she heard a noise on the gravel, and  turned to see Daddy Dan entering the cave with Satan behind him, quite  distinctly outlined by the sunset outside. Black Bart walked first,  looking back over his shoulder as though he led the way.    It was partly because the black, silhouetted figures awed her, somewhat,  and partly because she wished to give Daddy Dan a gay surprise, that  Joan did not run to him. And then, in the darkness, she heard Satan  munching the dried grass, and the squeak and rattle as the saddle was  drawn off and hung up, scraping against the rock.    \"What you been doin', Bart?\" queried the voice of Daddy Dan, and the  last of Joan's fears fell from her as she listened. \"You act kind of  worried. If you been runnin' rabbits all day and got your pads full of  thorns I'll everlastin'ly treat you rough.\"    The wolf-dog whined.    \"Well, speak up. What you want? Want me over there?\"    It would have been a trifle unearthly to most people, but Joan knew  the ways of Daddy Dan with Satan and Black Bart. She lay quite still,  shivering with pleasure as the footsteps approached her. Then a match  scratched--she saw by the blue spurt of flame that he was lighting a  pine torch, then whirling it until the flame ate down to the pitchy  knot. He held it above his head, and now she saw him plainly: the light  cascaded over his shoulders, glowed on his eyes, and then puffed out  sidewise in a draught.    Joan was upon her feet, and running toward him with a cry of joy, until  she remembered that he was not to be approached like her mother. There  were never any bear-hugs from him, no caresses, not much laughter. She  stopped barely in time, and stood with her fingers interlaced, staring  up at him, half delighted, half afraid. She read his mind by microscopic  changes in his eyes and lips.    \"Munner sent me.\"    That was wrong, she saw at once.    \"And Bart brought me.\" Much better, now. \"And oh, Daddy Dan, I've been  lonesome for you!\"    He continued to stare at her for another moment, and even Joan could not  tell whether he were angry or indifferent or pleased.    \"Well,\" he murmured at length, \"I guess you're hungry, Joan?\"    She knew it was complete acceptance, and she could hardly keep from a  shout of happiness. Daddy Dan had a great aversion to sudden outcries.    \"I guess I am,\" said Joan.        Chapter XX. Discipline    He made the preparation for supper with such easy speed that everything  seemed to be done by magic hands. When Joan's mother cooked supper there  was always much rattling of the stove, then the building of the fire, a  long preparation of food, and another interval when things steamed and  sizzled on the fire. There followed the setting of the table, and then  a long, aching time of hunger when the food was in sight, but one could  not eat until Daddy Dan had done this, and Munner had done that. Also,  when one did eat, half the taste was taken from things by the necessity  of various complicated evolutions of knife and fork. Instance the  absurdity of taking the fork under the thumb with the forefinger  pressing along the back of the wobbly instrument, when any one could see  that the proper, natural way of using a fork was to grasp it daggerwise  and drive it firmly through that skidding piece of meat. Not only this,  but a cup must be held in one hand, and bread must be broken into little  pieces before putting butter on it. Above all, no matter how terribly  hard one tried, there was sure to be a mistake, and then: \"Now, Joan,  don't do that. This is the way--\"    But how different everything was in this delightful house of Daddy Dan!    In an incredibly short time three torches flared about them and filled  the air with scents of freshness and the outdoors-scents that went  tingling up the nose and filled one with immense possibilities of  eating. At the very same time, a few motions caused a heap of wood  to catch fire and blaze among the stones while a steady stream of  blue-white smoke wavered up toward the top of the cave and disappeared  in the shadows. After this her father showed her a little stream of  water which must come from a spring far back in the cave, and the  current slipped noiselessly along one wall, and dipped of sight again  before it reached the entrance to the place. Here she discovered a  little bowl, made out of small stones nicely fitted together, and  allowing the water to pour over one edge and out at another with a  delicious purling--such crystal clear water that one actually wanted to  wash in it even if it was cold, and even if one had the many sore places  on fingers and nose and behind the ears.    Behold! no sooner did one turn from the washing of hands and face than  the table was miraculously spread upon the surface of a flat rock, with  other stones nearby to serve as chairs; and on the table steamed \"pone,\"  warmed over; coffee with milk in it--coffee, which was so strictly  banned at home!--potatoes sliced to transparent thinness and fried to  crisp brown at the edges, and a great slab of meat that fairly shouted  to the appetite.    So far so good, but the realization was a thousand fold better than  anticipation. No cutting of one's own meat at this enchanted board!  The shining knife of Daddy Dan divided it into delectable bits with the  speed of light, and it needed only the slightest amount of experimenting  and cautious glances to discover that one could use a fork daggerwise,  and when in doubt even seize upon a morsel with one's fingers and wipe  the fingers afterwards on a bit of the dry grass. One could grasp the  cup by both sides, scorning the silly handle, and if occasionally one  sipped the coffee with a little noise--which added astonishingly to the  taste--there was no sharp warning, no frowning eye to overlook. Besides,  at Munner's table, there was never time to pay attention to Joan, for  there was talk about vague, abstract things--the price of skins,  the melting of the snows, the condition of the passes, the long and  troubling argument about the wicker chairs, with some remarkably foolish  asides, now and then, concerning happiness and love--when all the time  any one with half an eye could see that the thing to do was to eat  and eat and eat until that hollow place ceased to be. Talking came  afterwards.    In the house of Daddy Dan all these things were ordered as they should  be. Not a word was said; not a glance of criticism rested upon her; when  her tin plate was cleared she heard no reproofs for eating too greedily,  but she was furnished anew from the store of good things on the rock.    In place of conversation, there were other matters to occupy the mind  during the meal. For presently she observed the beautiful head of Satan  just behind his master--Satan, who could pass over noisy gravel with  the softness of a cat, and now loomed out of the deeper night down the  cavern. Inch by inch, with infinite caution and keenly pricked ears,  the head lowered beside Dan, and the quivering, delicate muzzle stole  towards a fragment of the \"pone.\" Joan watched breathlessly and then she  saw that in spite of the caution of that movement her father knew all  about it--just a glint of amusement in the corner of his eyes, just a  slight twitch at the corners of his mouth to tell Joan that he was as  delighted as a boy playing a trick. Barely in time to save the morsel  of pone, he spoke and the head was dashed up. Yet Satan was not entirely  discouraged. If he could not steal the bread he would beg for it. It  made Joan pause in her destruction of the edibles, not to watch openly,  for an instinct told her that the thing to do was to note these by-plays  from the corner of one's eye, as Daddy Dan did, and swallow the ripples  of mirth that came tickling in the throat. She knew perfectly well that  Satan would have it in the end, for of all living things not even Munner  had such power over Dan as the black stallion. He maneuvered adroitly.  First he circled the table and stood opposite the master, begging with  his eyes, but Dan looked fixedly down at the rock until an impatient  whinny called up his eyes. Then he pretended the most absolute surprise.    \"Why, Satan, you old scoundrel, what are you doin' over there? Get back  where you belong?\"    He gestured with a thumb over his shoulder"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18993"],[0,"History  of the World War: An Authentic Narrative of the World's Greatest War (#20)"],[1,"in the streets, firing off their rifles on  every side. A young man, seventeen years, Georges Lecourtier, who tried  to escape, was shot. M. Alfred Lallemand suffered the same fate. He was  pursued into the kitchen of his fellow-citizen Tautelier, and murdered  there, while Tautelier received three bullets in his hand.    \"Fearing, not without reason, for their lives, Mlle. Proces, her mother  and her grandmother of seventy-one and her old aunt of eighty-one, tried  to cross the trellis which separates their garden from a neighboring  property with the help of a ladder. The young girl alone was able to  reach the other side and to avoid death by hiding in the cabbages. As  for the other women, they were struck down by rifle shots. The village  cure collected the brains of the aunt on the ground on which they were  strewn and had the bodies carried into Proces' house. During the  following night, the Germans played the piano near the bodies.    \"While the carnage raged, the fire rapidly spread and devoured  thirty-five houses. An old man of seventy and a child of two months  perished in the flames. M. Igier, who was trying to save his cattle, was  pursued for 300 meters by soldiers, who fired at him ceaselessly. By a  miracle this man had the good fortune not to be wounded, but five  bullets went through his clothing.\"    This summary merely hints at the atrocities that were perpetrated. And  these are the crimes that France and Belgium will remember after  indemnities have been paid, after borders have been re-established and  after generations shall have past. The horrors of blazing villages, of  violated womanhood, of mutilated childhood, of stark and senseless  butcheries, will flash before the minds of French and Belgian men and  women when Germany's name shall be mentioned long after the declaration  of peace.    Schrecklichkeit had its day. It took its bloody toll of the fairest and  bravest of two gallant nations. It ravaged Poland as well and wreaked  its fiendish will on wounded soldiers on the battle-fields.    But Schrecklichkeit is dead. Belgium and France have shown that murder  and rape and arson can not destroy liberty nor check the indomitable  ambitions of the free peoples of earth.    The lesson to Germany was taught at a terrible cost to humanity, but it  was taught in a fashion that nations hereafter who shall dream of  emulating the Hun will know in advance that frightfulness serves no end  except to feed the lust for destruction that exists only in the most  debased and brutish of men.        CHAPTER VII    THE FIRST BATTLE OF THE MARNE    France and civilization were saved by Joffre and Foch at the first  battle of the Marne, in September, 1914. Autocracy was destroyed by Foch  at the second battle of the Marne, in July, 1918.    This in a nutshell embraces the dramatic opening and closing episodes of  the World War on the soil of France. Bracketed between these two  glorious victories were the agonies of martyred France, the deaths and  life-long cripplings of millions of men, the up-rooting of arrogant  militarism, the liberation of captive nations.    The first battle of the Marne was wholly a French operation. The British  were close at hand, but had no share in the victory. Generals Gallieni  and Manoury, acting under instructions from Marshal Joffre, were driven  by automobile to the headquarters of the British commander, Sir John  French, in the village of Melun. They explained in detail General  Joffre's plan of attack upon the advancing German army. An urgent  request was made that the British army halt its retreat, face about, and  attack the two corps of von Kluck's army then confronting the British.  Simultaneously with this attack General Manoury's forces were to fall  upon the flank and the rear guard of von Kluck along the River Ourcq.  This operation was planned for the next day, September 5th. Sir John  French replied that he could not get his tired army in readiness for  battle within forty-eight hours. This would delay the British attack in  all probability until September 7th.    Joffre's plan of battle, however, would admit of no delay. The case was  urgent; there was grave danger of a union between the great forces  headed by the Crown Prince and those under von Kluck. He resolved to go  ahead without the British, and ordered Manoury to strike as had been  planned.    He fixed as an extreme limit for the movement of retreat, which was  still going on, the line of Bray-sur-Seine, Nogent-sur-Seine,  Arcis-sur-Aube, Vitry-le-Francois, and the region to the north of  Bar-le-Duc. This line might be reached if the troops were compelled to  go back so far. They would attack before reaching it, as soon as there  was a possibility of bringing about an offensive disposition, permitting  the co-operation of the whole of the French forces. On September 5 it  appeared that this desired situation existed.      [Illustration: Photograph]    Copyright Underwood and Underwood, N.Y.

[Illustration: Photograph]    MARSHAL FERDINAND FOCH, GENERALISSIMO OF THE ALLIED ARMIES    No leader could command greater confidence than the brilliant    strategist to whom was mainly due the great victory of the Marne in    the first autumn of the war. He also directed the French offensive on    the Somme in 1916 and in November, 1917, he was chosen as the French    representative and subsequently chairman of the Central Military    Committee appointed to assist the Supreme Allied War Council. Marshal    Foch was formerly for five years lecturer on strategy and tactics at    the Ecole de Guerre. At the close of the war he said to the Allied    armies: \"You have won the greatest battle in history and saved the    most sacred cause--the liberty of the world,\"      [Illustration: Map; Paris in the lower left corner, showing various  battle lines Eastward to Luxumburg.]    THE FIRST GERMAN DASH FOR PARIS      The First German army, carrying audacity to temerity, had continued its  endeavor to envelop the French left, had crossed the Grand Morin, and  reached the region of Chauffry, to the south of Rebais and of Esternay.  It aimed then at cutting Joffre off from Paris, in order to begin the  investment of the capital.    The Second army had its head on the line Champaubert, Etoges, Bergeres,  and Vertus.    The Third and Fourth armies reached to Chalons-sur-Marne and  Bussy-le-Repos. The Fifth army was advancing on one side and the other  from the Argonne as far as Triacourt-les-Islettes and Juivecourt. The  Sixth and Seventh armies were attacking more to the east.    The French left army had been able to occupy the line Sezanne,  Villers-St. Georges and Courchamps. This was precisely the disposition  which the General-in-Chief had wished to see achieved. On the 4th he  decided to take advantage of it, and ordered all the armies to hold  themselves ready. He had taken from his right two new army corps, two  divisions of infantry, and two divisions of cavalry, which were  distributed between his left and his center.    On the evening of the 5th he addressed to all the commanders of armies a  message ordering them to attack.    \"The hour has come,\" he wrote, \"to advance at all costs, and to die  where you stand rather than give way.\"    If one examines the map, it will be seen that by his inflection toward  Meaux and Coulommiers General von Kluck was exposing his right to the  offensive action of the French left. This is the starting point of the  victory of the Marne.    On the evening of September 5th the French left army had reached the  front Penchard-Saint-Souflet-Ver. On the 6th and 7th it continued its  attacks vigorously with the Ourcq as objective. On the evening of the  7th it was some kilometers from the Ourcq, on the front  Chambry-Marcilly-Lisieux-Acy-en-Multien. On the 8th, the Germans, who  had in great haste reinforced their right by bringing their Second and  Fourth army corps back to the north, obtained some successes by attacks  of extreme violence. But in spite of this pressure the French held their  ground. In a brilliant action they took three standards, and being  reinforced prepared a new attack for the 10th. At the moment that this  attack was about to begin the enemy was already in retreat toward the  north. The attack became a pursuit, and on the 12th the French  established themselves on the Aisne.    Why did the German forces which were confronting the French, and on the  evening before attacking so furiously, retreat on the morning of the  10th? Because in bringing back on the 6th several army corps from the  south to the north to face the French left, the enemy had exposed his  left to the attacks of the now rested British, who had immediately faced  around toward the north, and to those of the French armies which were  prolonging the English lines to the right. This is what the French  command had sought to bring about. This is what happened on September  8th and allowed the development and rehabilitation which it was to  effect.    On the 6th the British army set out from the line Rozcy-Lagny and that  evening reached the southward bank of the Grand Morin. On the 7th and  8th it continued its march, and on the 9th had debouched to the north of  the Marne below Chauteau-Thierry--the town that was to become famous  for the American stand in 1918--taking in flank the German forces which  on that day were opposing, on the Ourcq, the French left army. Then it  was that these forces began to retreat, while the British army, going in  pursuit and capturing seven guns and many prisoners, reached the Aisne  between Soissons and Longueval.    The role of the French army, which was operating to the right of the  British army, was threefold. It had to support the British attacking "]]]
