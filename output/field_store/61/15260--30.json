The Governor's sole anxiety is to  obtain ivory, and no aid is rendered to traders. Seyed Suleiman the  Wazeer is the author of the do-nothing policy, and sent away all the  sepoys as too expensive, consequently the Wagogo plunder traders  unchecked. It is reported that Egyptian Turks came up and attacked  Mteza, but lost many people, and fled. The report of a Moslem Mission to  his country was a falsehood, though the details given were  circumstantial: falsehood is so common, one can believe nothing the  Arabs say, unless confirmed by other evidence: they are the followers of  the Prince of lies--Mohamad, whose cool appropriation of the knowledge  gained at Damascus, and from the Jews, is perfectly disgusting. All his  deeds were done when unseen by any witnesses. It is worth noticing that  all admit the decadence of the Moslem power, and they ask how it is so  fallen? They seem sincere in their devotion and in teaching the Koran,  but its meaning is comparatively hid from most of the Suaheli. The  Persian Arabs are said to be gross idolators, and awfully impure. Earth  from a grave at Kurbelow (?) is put in the turban and worshipped: some  of the sects won't say \"Amen.\"    Moenyegumbe never drank more than a mouthful of pombe. When young, he  could make his spear pass right through an elephant, and stick in the  ground on the other side. He was a large man, and all his members were  largely developed, his hands and fingers were all in proportion to his  great height; and he lived to old age with strength unimpaired: Goambari  inherits his white colour and sharp nose, but not his wisdom or courage.  Merere killed five of his own people for exciting him against the Arabs.  The half-caste is the murderer of many of Charura's descendants. His  father got a daughter of Moenyegumbe for courage in fighting the Babema  of Ubena.    Cold-blooded murders are frightfully common here. Some kill people in  order to be allowed to wear the red tail feathers of a parrot in their  hair, and yet they are not ugly like the West Coast Negroes, for many  men have as finely formed heads as could be found in London. We English,  if naked, would make but poor figures beside the strapping forms and  finely shaped limbs of Manyuema men and women. Their cannibalism is  doubtful, but my observations raise grave suspicions. A Scotch jury  would say, \"Not proven.\" The women are not guilty.    _4th February, 1871._--Ten of my men from the coast have come near to  Bambarre, and will arrive to-day. I am extremely thankful to hear it,  for it assures me that my packet of letters was not destroyed; they know  at home by this time what has detained me, and the end to which I  strain.    Only one letter reached, and forty are missing! James was killed to-day  by an arrow: the assassin was hid in the forest till my men going to buy  food came up.[12] I propose to leave on the 12th. I have sent Dr. Kirk a  cheque for Rs. 4000: great havoc was made by cholera, and in the midst  of it my friend exerted himself greatly to get men off to me with goods;  the first gang of porters all died.    _8th February, 1871._--The ten men refusing to go north are influenced  probably by Shereef, and my two ringleaders, who try this means to  compel me to take them.    _9th February, 1871._--The man who contrived the murder of James came  here, drawn by the pretence that he was needed to lead a party against  the villages, which he led to commit the outrage. His thirst for blood  is awful: he was bound, and word sent to bring the actual murderers  within three days, or he suffers death. He brought five goats, thinking  that would smooth the matter over.    _11th February, 1871._--Men struck work for higher wages: I consented to  give them six dollars a month if they behaved well; if ill I diminish  it, so we hope to start to-morrow. Another hunting quelled by Mohamad  and me.    The ten men sent are all slaves of the Banians, who are English  subjects, and they come with a lie in their mouth: they will not help  me, and swear that the Consul told them not to go forward, but to force  me back, and they spread the tale all over the country that a certain  letter has been sent to me with orders to return forthwith. They swore  so positively that I actually looked again at Dr. Kirk's letter to see  if his orders had been rightly understood by me. But for Mohamad  Bogharib and fear of pistol-shot they would gain their own and their  Banian masters' end to baffle me completely; they demand an advance of  one dollar, or six dollars a month, though this is double freeman's pay  at Zanzibar. Their two headmen, Shereef and Awathe, refused to come past  Ujiji, and are revelling on my goods there.    _13th February, 1871._--Mabruki being seized with choleraic purging  detains us to-day. I gave Mohamad five pieces Americano, five ditto  Kanike,[13] and two frasilahs samisami beads. He gives me a note to  Hassani for twenty thick copper bracelets. Yesterday crowds came to eat  the meat of the man who misled James to his death spot: but we want the  men who set the Mbanga men to shoot him: they were much disappointed  when they found that no one was killed, and are undoubtedly cannibals.    _16th, February, 1871._--Started to-day. Mabruki making himself out  very ill, Mohamad roused him out by telling him I travelled when much  worse. The chief gave me a goat, and Mohamad another, but in coming  through the forest on the neck of the mountain the men lost three, and  have to go back for them, and return to-morrow. Simon and Ibram were  bundled out of the camp, and impudently followed me: when they came  up, I told them to be off.    _17th February, 1871._--Waiting at a village on the Western slope for  the men to come up with the goats, if they have gone back to the camp.  Mohamad would not allow the deserters to remain among his people, nor  would I. It would only be to imbue the minds of my men with their want  of respect for all English, and total disregard of honesty and honour:  they came after me with inimitable effrontery, believing that though I  said I would not take them, they were so valuable, I was only saying  what I knew to be false. The goats were brought by a Manyuema man, who  found one fallen into a pitfall and dead; he ate it, and brought one of  his own in lieu of it. I gave him ten strings of beads, and he presented  a fowl in token of goodwill.    _18th February, 1871._--Went on to a village on the Lulwa, and on the  19th reached Moenemgoi, who dissuaded me so earnestly against going to  Moenekurumbo for the cause of Molembalemba that I agreed not to venture.    _20th February, 1871._--To the ford with only one canoe now, as two men  of Katomba were swept away in the other, and drowned. They would not  sell the remaining canoe, so I go N.W. on foot to Moene Lualaba, where  fine large canoes are abundant. The grass and mud are grievous, but my  men lift me over the waters.    _21st February, 1871._--Arrived at Monandewa's village, situated on a  high ridge between two deep and difficult gullies. These people are  obliging and kind: the chief's wife made a fire for me in the evening  unbidden.    _22nd February, 1871._--On N.W. to a high hill called Chibande a Yunde,  with a spring of white water at the village on the top. Famine from some  unknown cause here, but the people are cultivating now on the plain  below with a will.    _23rd February, 1871._--On to two large villages with many banana plants  around, but the men said they were in fear of the traders, and shifted  their villages to avoid them: we then went on to the village  Kahombogola, with a feeble old man as chief. The country is beautiful  and undulating: light-green grass covers it all, save at the brooks,  where the eye is relieved by the dark-green lines of trees. Grass tears  the hands and wets the extremities constantly. The soil is formed of the  debris of granitic rocks; rough and stony, but everywhere fertile. One  can rarely get a bare spot to sit down and rest.    _24th February, 1871._--To a village near Lolande River. Then across  the Loengadye, sleeping on the bank of the Luha, and so to Mamohela,  where we were welcomed by all the Arabs, and I got a letter from Dr.  Kirk and another from the Sultan, and from Mohamad bin Nassib who was  going to Karagwe: all anxious to be kind. Katomba gave flour, nuts,  fowls, and goat. A new way is opened to Kasongo's, much shorter than  that I followed. I rest a few days, and then go on.    _25th February, 1871._--So we went on, and found that it was now known  that the Lualaba flowed west-south-west, and that our course was to be  west across this other great bend of the mighty river. I had to suspend  my judgment, so as to be prepared to find it after all perhaps the  Congo. No one knew anything about it except that when at Kasongo's nine  days west, and by south it came sweeping round and flowed north and  north and by east.    Katomba presented a young soko or gorillah that had been caught while  its mother was killed; she sits eighteen inches high, has fine long  black hair all over, which was pretty so long as it was kept in order by  her dam. She is the least mischievous of all the monkey tribe I have  seen, and seems to know that in me she has a friend, and sits quietly on  the mat beside me. In walking, the first thing observed is that she does  not tread on the palms of her hands, but on the backs of the second line  of bones of the hands: in doing this the nails do not touch the ground,  nor do the knuckles; she uses the arms thus supported crutch fashion,  and hitches herself along between them; occasionally one hand is put  down before the other, and alternates with the feet, or she walks  upright and holds up a hand to any one to carry her. If refused, she  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1703"],[0,"Dead Men Tell No Tales (#20)"],[1,"the virtue in my beloved's voice, the  magic of her eyes, the healing of her touch, that I was scarce conscious  of deceit, but felt a whole man once more as we two stood together in  the moonlight.    In a trance I stood there gazing into her brave young eyes. In a  trance I suffered her to lead me by the hand through the rank, dense  rhododendrons. And still entranced I crouched by her side near the  further side, with only unkempt grass-plot and a weedy path between us  and that ponderous door, wide open still, and replaced by a section of  the lighted hail within. On this we fixed our attention with mingled  dread and impatience, those contending elements of suspense; but the  black was slow to reappear; and my eyes stole home to my sweet girl's  face, with its glory of moonlit curls, and the eager, resolute,  embittered look that put the world back two whole months, and Eva  Denison upon the Lady Jermyn's poop, in the ship's last hours. But it  was not her look alone; she had on her cloak, as the night before,  but with me (God bless her!) she found no need to clasp herself in its  folds; and underneath she wore the very dress in which she had sung at  our last concert, and been rescued in the gig. It looked as though she  had worn it ever since. The roses were crushed and soiled, the tulle all  torn, and tarnished some strings of beads that had been gold: a tatter  of Chantilly lace hung by a thread: it is another of the relics that I  have unearthed in the writing of this narrative.    \"I thought men never noticed dresses?\" my love said suddenly, a pleased  light in her eyes (I thought) in spite of all. \"Do you really remember  it?\"    \"I remember every one of them,\" I said indignantly; and so I did.    \"You will wonder why I wear it,\" said Eva, quickly. \"It was the first  that came that terrible night. They have given me many since. But I  won't wear one of them--not one!\"    How her eyes flashed! I forgot all about Jose.    \"I suppose you know why they hadn't room for you in the gig?\" she went  on.    \"No, I don't know, and I don't care. They had room for you,\" said I;  \"that's all I care about.\" And to think she could not see I loved her!    \"But do you mean to say you don't know that these--murderers--set fire  to the ship?\"    \"No--yes! I heard you say so last night.\"    \"And you don't want to know what for?\"    Out of politeness I protested that I did; but, as I live, all I wanted  to know just then was whether my love loved me--whether she ever  could--whether such happiness was possible under heaven!    \"You remember all that mystery about the cargo?\" she continued eagerly,  her pretty lips so divinely parted!    \"It turned out to be gunpowder,\" said I, still thinking only of her.    \"No--gold!\"    \"But it was gunpowder,\" I insisted; for it was my incorrigible passion  for accuracy which had led up to half our arguments on the voyage; but  this time Eva let me off.    \"It was also gold: twelve thousand ounces from the diggings. That was  the real mystery. Do you mean to say you never guessed?\"    \"No, by Jove I didn't!\" said I. She had diverted my interest at last. I  asked her if she had known on board.    \"Not until the last moment. I found out during the fire. Do you remember  when we said good-by? I was nearly telling you then.\"    Did I remember! The very letter of that last interview was cut deep in  my heart; not a sleepless night had I passed without rehearsing it word  for word and look for look; and sometimes, when sorrow had spent itself,  and the heart could bleed no more, vain grief had given place to vainer  speculation, and I had cudgelled my wakeful brains for the meaning of  the new and subtle horror which I had read in my darling's eyes at the  last. Now I understood; and the one explanation brought such a tribe  in its train, that even the perilous ecstasy of the present moment was  temporarily forgotten in the horrible past.    \"Now I know why they wouldn't have me in the gig!\" I cried softly.    \"She carried four heavy men's weight in gold.\"    \"When on earth did they get it aboard?\"    \"In provision boxes at the last; but they had been filling the boxes for  weeks.\"    \"Why, I saw them doing it!\" I cried. \"But what about the gig? Who picked  you up?\"    She was watching that open door once more, and she answered with notable  indifference, \"Mr. Rattray.\"    \"So that's the connection!\" said I; and I think its very simplicity was  what surprised me most.    \"Yes; he was waiting for us at Ascension.\"    \"Then it was all arranged?\"    \"Every detail.\"    \"And this young blackguard is as bad as any of them!\"    \"Worse,\" said she, with bitter brevity. Nor had I ever seen her look so  hard but once, and that was the night before in the old justice hall,  when she told Rattray her opinion of him to his face. She had now the  same angry flush, the same set mouth and scornful voice; and I took  it finally into my head that she was unjust to the poor devil, villain  though he was. With all his villainy I declined to believe him as bad  as the others. I told her so in as many words. And in a moment we were  arguing as though we were back on the Lady Jermyn with nothing else to  do.    \"You may admire wholesale murderers and thieves,\" said Eva. \"I do not.\"    \"Nor I. My point is simply that this one is not as bad as the rest. I  believe he was really glad for my sake when he discovered that I knew  nothing of the villainy. Come now, has he ever offered you any personal  violence?\"    \"Me? Mr. Rattray? I should hope not, indeed!\"    \"Has he never saved you from any?\"    \"I--I don't know.\"    \"Then I do. When you left them last night there was some talk of  bringing you back by force. You can guess who suggested that--and who  set his face against it and got his way. You would think the better of  Rattray had you heard what passed.\"    \"Should I?\" she asked half eagerly, as she looked quickly round at me;  and suddenly I saw her eyes fill. \"Oh, why will you speak about him?\"  she burst out. \"Why must you defend him, unless it's to go against me,  as you always did and always will! I never knew anybody like you--never!  I want you to take me away from these wretches, and all you do is to  defend them!\"    \"Not all,\" said I, clasping her hand warmly in mine. \"Not all--not all!  I will take you away from them, never fear; in another hour God grant  you may be out of their reach for ever!\"    \"But where are we to go?\" she whispered wildly. \"What are you to do with  me? All my friends think me dead, and if they knew I was not it would  all come out.\"    \"So it shall,\" said I; \"the sooner the better; if I'd had my way it  would all be out already.\"    I see her yet, my passionate darling, as she turned upon me, whiter than  the full white moon.    \"Mr. Cole,\" said she, \"you must give me your sacred promise that so far  as you are concerned, it shall never come out at all!\"    \"This monstrous conspiracy? This cold blooded massacre?\"    And I crouched aghast.    \"Yes; it could do no good; and, at any rate, unless you promise I remain  where I am.\"    \"In their hands?\"    \"Decidedly--to warn them in time. Leave them I would, but betray  them--never!\"    What could I say? What choice had I in the face of an alternative so  headstrong and so unreasonable? To rescue Eva from these miscreants I  would have let every malefactor in the country go unscathed: yet the  condition was a hard one; and, as I hesitated, my love went on her knees  to me, there in the moonlight among the rhododendrons.    \"Promise--promise--or you will kill me!\" she gasped. \"They may deserve  it richly, but I would rather be torn in little pieces than--than have  them--hanged!\"    \"It is too good for most of them.\"    \"Promise!\"    \"To hold my tongue about them all?\"    \"Yes--promise!\"    \"Promise!\"    \"When a hundred lives were sacrificed--\"    \"Promise!\"    \"I can't,\" I said. \"It's wrong.\"    \"Then good-by!\" she cried, starting to her feet.    \"No--no--\" and I caught her hand.    \"Well, then?\"    \"I--promise.\"          CHAPTER XV. FIRST BLOOD      So I bound myself to a guilty secrecy for Eva's sake, to save her from  these wretches, or if you will, to win her for myself. Nor did it  strike me as very strange, after a moment's reflection, that she should  intercede thus earnestly for a band headed by her own mother's widower,  prime scoundrel of them all though she knew him to be. The only  surprise was that she had not interceded in his name; that I should have  forgotten, and she should have allowed me to forget, the very existence  of so indisputable a claim upon her loyalty. This, however, made it a  little difficult to understand the hysterical gratitude with which my  unwilling promise was received. Poor darling! she was beside herself  with sheer relief. She wept as I had never seen her weep before. She  seized and even kissed my hands, as one who neither knew nor cared what  she did, surprising me so much by her emotion that this expression of it  passed unheeded. I was the best friend she had ever had. I was her one  good friend in all the world; she would trust herself to me; and if I  would but take her to the convent where she had been brought up, she  would pray for me there until her death, but that would not be very  long.    All of which confused me utterly; it seemed an inexplicable breakdown  in one who had shown such nerve and courage hitherto, and so hearty a  loathing for that damnable Santos. So completely had her presence of  mind forsaken her that she looked no longer where she had been gazing  hitherto. And thus it was that neither of us saw Jose until we heard  him calling, \"Senhora Evah! Senhora Evah!\" with some rapid sentences in  Portuguese.    \"Now is our time,\" I whispered, crouching lower and clasping a small  hand gone suddenly cold. \"Think of nothing now but getting out of this.  I'll keep my word once we are out; and here's the toy that's going to  get us out.\" And I produced my Deane"]]]
