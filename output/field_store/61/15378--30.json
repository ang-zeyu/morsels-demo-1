We need not limit ourselves, however, to the argument by exclusion, for  it is not difficult to present direct evidence that the differences  between men are actually inherited by children from parents. The  problem, formally stated, is to measure the amount by which the likeness  of individuals of like ancestry surpasses the likeness of individuals of  different ancestry. After subtraction of the necessary amount for the  greater likeness in training, that the individuals of like ancestry will  have, whatever amount is left will necessarily, represent the actual  inheritance of the child from its ancestors--parents, grandparents, and  so on.    Obviously, the subtraction for environmental effects is the point at  which a mistake is most probable. We may safely start, therefore, with a  problem in which no subtraction whatever need be made for this cause.  Eye color is a stock example, and a good one, for it is not conceivable  that home environment or training would cause a change in the color of  brothers' eyes.    The correlation[30] between brothers, or sisters, or brothers and  sisters--briefly, the fraternal resemblance--for eye-color was found by  Karl Pearson, using the method described in Chapter I, to be .52. We are  in no danger of contradiction if we state with positiveness that this  figure represents the influence of ancestry, or direct inheritance, in  respect to this particular trait.    Suppose the resemblance between brothers be measured for stature--it  is .51; for cephalic index, that is, the ratio of width of skull to length  of skull--it is .49; for hair color--it is .59. In all of these points,  it will be admitted that no home training, or any other influence except  heredity, can conceivably play an important part. We could go on with a  long list of such measurements, which biometrists have made; and if they  were all summed up it would be found that the fraternal correlation in  these traits as to the heritability of which there can be no dispute, is  about .52. Here is a good measure, albeit a technical one, of the  influence of heredity from the near ancestry. It is possible, too, to  measure the direct correlation between a trait in parent and the same  trait in offspring; the average of many cases where only heredity can be  thought to have had any effect in producing the result, is .49. By the  two methods of measurement, therefore, quite comparable results are  obtained.    So much work has been done in this subject that we have no hesitation in  affirming .5 to represent approximately the average intensity of  heredity for physical characters in man. If any well-marked physical  character be measured, in which training and environment can not be  assumed to have had any part, it will be found, in a large enough number  of subjects, that the resemblance, measured on a scale from 0 to 1, is  just about one-half of unity. Of course, perfect identity with the  parents is not to be expected, because the child must inherit from both  parents, who in turn each inherited from two parents, and so on.    So far, it may be said, we have had plain sailing because we have  carefully chosen traits in which we were not obliged to make any  subtraction whatever for the influence of training. But it is evident  that not all traits fall in that class.    This is the point at which the inheritance of mental traits has been  most often questioned. Probably no one will care to dispute the  inheritance of such physical traits as eye-color. But in considering the  mind, a certain school of popular pseudo-psychological writers question  the reality of mental inheritance, and allege that the proofs which the  geneticist offers are worthless because they do not make account of the  similarity in environment or training. Of course, it is admitted that  some sort of a mental groundwork must be inherited, but extremists  allege that this is little more than a clean slate on which the  environment, particularly during the early years of childhood, writes  its autograph.    We must grant that the analysis of the inheritance of mental traits is  proceeding slowly. This is not the fault of the geneticist, but rather  of the psychologist, who has not yet been able to furnish the geneticist  with the description of definite traits of such a character as to make  possible the exhaustive analysis of their individual inheritance. That  department of psychology is only now being formed.    We might even admit that no inherited \"unit character\" in the mind has  yet been isolated; but it would be a great mistake to assume from this  admission that proof of the inheritance of mental qualities, in general,  is lacking.    The psychologists and educators who think so appear either to be swayed  by metaphysical views of the mind, or else to believe that resemblance  between parent and offspring is the only evidence of inheritance that  can be offered. The father dislikes cheese, the son dislikes cheese.  \"Aha, you think that that is the inheritance of a dislike for cheese,\"  cries the critic, \"but we will teach you better.\" An interesting example  of this sort of teaching is furnished by Boris Sidis, whose feelings are  outraged because geneticists have represented that some forms of  insanity are hereditary. He declaims for several pages[31] in this  fashion:    \"The so-called scientific method of the eugenists is radically faulty,  in spite of the rich display of colored plates, stained tables,  glittering biological speculations, brilliant mathematical formulae and  complicated statistical calculations. The eugenists pile Ossa on Pelion  of facts by the simple method of enumeration which Bacon and the  thinkers coming after him have long ago condemned as puerile and futile.  From the savage's belief in sympathetic, imitative magic with its  consequent superstitions, omens, and taboos down to the articles of  faith and dogmas of the eugenists we find the same faulty, primitive  thought, guided by the puerile, imbecile method of simple enumeration,  and controlled by the wisdom of the logical _post hoc, ergo propter  hoc_.\"    Now if resemblance between parent and offspring were, as Dr. Sidis  supposes, the only evidence of inheritance of mental traits which the  eugenist can produce, his case would indeed be weak. And it is perfectly  true that \"evidence\" of this kind has sometimes been advanced as  sufficient by geneticists who should have known better. But this is not  the real evidence which genetics offers. The evidence is of numerous  kinds, and several lines might be destroyed without impairing the  validity of the remainder. It is impossible to review the whole body of  evidence here, but some of the various kinds may be indicated, and  samples given, even though this involves the necessity of repeating some  things we have said in earlier chapters. The reader will then be able to  form his own opinion as to whether the geneticists' proofs or the mere  assurances of those who have not studied the subject are the more  weighty.    1. _The analogy from breeding experiments._ Tame rats, for instance, are  very docile; their offspring can be handled without a bit of trouble.  The wild rat, on the other hand, is not at all docile.    W. E. Castle, of Harvard University, writes:[32] \"We have repeatedly  mated tame female rats with wild males, the mothers being removed to  isolated cages before the birth of the young. These young which had  never seen or been near their father were very wild in disposition in  every case. The observations of Yerkes on such rats raised by us  indicates that their wildness was not quite as extreme as that of the  pure wild rat but closely approached it.\"    Who can suggest any plausible explanation of their conduct, save that  they inherited a certain temperament from their sire? Yet the  inheritance of temperament is one of the things which certain  psychologists most \"view with alarm.\" If it is proved in other animals,  can it be considered wholly impossible in man?    2. _The segregation of mental traits._ When an insane, or epileptic, or  feeble-minded person mates with a normal individual, in whose family no  taint is found, the offspring (generally speaking) will be mentally  sound, even though one parent is not. On the other hand, if two people  from tainted stocks marry, although neither one may be personally  defective, part of their offspring will be affected.    This production of sound children from an unsound parent, in the first  case, and unsound children from two apparently sound parents in the  second case, is exactly the opposite of what one would expect if the  child gets his unsoundness merely by imitation or \"contagion.\" The  difference can not reasonably be explained by any difference in  environment or external stimuli. Heredity offers a satisfactory  explanation, for some forms of feeble-mindedness and epilepsy, and some  of the diseases known as insanity, behave as recessives and segregate in  just the way mentioned. There are abundant analogies in the inheritance  of other traits in man, lower animals and plants, that behave in exactly  the same manner.    If mental defects are inherited, then it is worth while investigating  whether mental excellencies may not also be.    3. _The persistence of like qualities regardless of difference in  environment._ Any parent with open eyes must see this in his own  children--must see that they retained the inherited traits even when  they left home and lived under entirely different surroundings. But the  histories of twins furnish the most graphic evidence. Galton, who  collected detailed histories of thirty-five pairs of twins who were  closely alike at birth, and examined their history in after years,  writes:[33] \"In some cases the resemblance of body and mind had  continued unaltered up to old age,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19562"],[0,"Napoleon and the Queen of Prussia (#20)"],[1,"going again, for the worst time  will be over then, and the fallen star will cease burning. Farewell, and  strike that hour as soon as possible!\"[15]    [Footnote 15: The clock remained in Napoleon's possession and  accompanied him to St. Helena. It stood on the mantel-piece in his small  parlor, and is mentioned in his will. He bequeathed it to his son, the  Duke de Reichstadt, in the following words: \"The clock which always  awakened me in the morning; it belonged to Frederick II., and I  appropriated it in Potsdam.\" The bell he also bequeathed to his son.  Many conflicting statements have been made concerning the sword Napoleon  took. It was certainly not the sword which Frederick had worn to the  last. The latter had a leathern scabbard which, in several defective  places, had been repaired with sealing-wax because Frederick found this  to be less expensive than to have it repaired by a harness-maker. The  king had taken this sword along, when, in September, 1806, he repaired  with the queen to the headquarters of the army; it accompanied him  during his flight, and was safely brought back by him. It was afterward  at the \"_Kunstkammer_\" In Berlin. The sword which Napoleon sent to Paris  had been presented to Frederick by Peter III. of Russia, who, it is well  known, was an ardent admirer of the great king. Bluecher, in 1814,  brought it back from Paris.]    Looking even more gloomy than on leaving the city, the emperor rode with  his suite again through the deserted, silent streets of Potsdam. The  brilliant cavalcade moved as slowly and solemnly as a funeral procession  toward the church, the lower vault of which contained the coffin with  the remains of Frederick. The sexton and his assistants, bearing the  large bunch of keys and a blazing torch, conducted the emperor through  the dark and silent corridors, and opened the heavy, clanking iron doors  leading into the vault. Napoleon entered. For a moment he stood still on  the threshold and gazed in surprise at its plain, gloomy vault, the  walls of which were not adorned with trophies, nor with any decorations  whatever, and at that humble wooden coffin, which stood so bare and  solitary in the middle of the sombre room. Behind him were his marshals,  who looked at the strange scene with an air of curiosity and  astonishment.    \"Ah,\" said Napoleon, gently turning his head toward them, and pointing  with his right hand to the coffin, \"a man must have distinguished  himself by many great deeds, and obtained immortal glory, to need thus  no earthly pomp and splendor!\"    He approached closely to the coffin; folding his arms on his breast, his  lips firmly compressed, he gazed long and steadfastly at it. The blaze  of the torch shed a bright light on his face, and as his pale head alone  was distinctly visible in the darkness, the beholders might have  believed one of the marble statues of the Caesars on the terrace of  Sans-souci, had descended from its pedestal in order to pay a visit to  the dead king.    After a long pause Napoleon's eye resumed its wonted brilliancy. He  pointed with a strange smile at the dust covering the lid of the coffin.  \"Dust without and dust within! that within was a great king and a hero;  yet that without is more lasting than the oaths which the Emperor  Alexander swore here a year ago, with Frederick William and the  beautiful Louisa. Even the kiss which Alexander imprinted at that time  on the coffin of Frederick is no longer visible; dust has covered it,  and equalized every thing.\" Thus speaking, he drew lines with his hand;  without knowing it, perhaps, his finger traced a large _N_ in the dust  of the royal coffin. He then hastily left the dark vault to return to  the palace.[16]    [Footnote 16: One of Horace Vernet's most beautiful paintings represents  this visit of Napoleon paid to the grave of Frederick the Great.]    The emperor paced the room a long while, his hands clasped on his back;  he then rang the bell impetuously, and sent for the chief of his  cabinet, M. de Menneval.    \"Be seated,\" said he, as soon as that functionary made his appearance;  \"take my pen, I will dictate to you my eighteenth bulletin.\"[17]    [Footnote 17: Napoleon wrote or dictated all his bulletins without  consulting any one in regard to them. After being dictated, the  bulletins were, however, submitted to Talleyrand, who took good care to  make no alteration.]    M. de Menneval sat down at the desk. Napoleon walked slowly up and down,  and dictated in a loud, stern voice as follows: \"The emperor arrived in  Potsdam on the 25th of October, and took up his residence at the royal  palace. He visited on the first day Sans-souci and the environs of  Potsdam, spending some time in the rooms of Frederick II., where every  thing is still in the same condition as at the time of his death. In the  arsenal at Berlin, five hundred cannon, several hundred thousand pounds  of powder, and several thousand muskets, were found in excellent  condition. It has been noticed as a singular coincidence that the  emperor arrived in Potsdam on the same day and at the same hour, and  occupied the same rooms, as the Emperor of Russia during the latter's  visit--a visit last year which has had such fatal consequences for  Prussia. Since that moment the queen has forgotten to take care of her  domestic affairs, and of the most important duties of the toilet, in  order to occupy herself with politics, gain power over the king, and  spread everywhere the evil influence which possesses her. The result of  that famous oath which was taken on the 4th of November, 1805, is the  battle of Austerlitz, and the speedy evacuation of Germany by the  Russian army in the manner prescribed by France. Forty-eight hours  afterward that oath at the coffin of Frederick the Great was made the  subject of a copper-plate, which is to be found in all the shops, and  even causes the peasants to laugh. On it is represented the handsome  Emperor of Russia; by his side the queen, and opposite him the king, who  lifts up his hand over the coffin; the queen, wrapped in a shawl, like  lady Hamilton, as seen on the London copper-plates, places her hand on  her heart, and seems to look at the Emperor of Russia. It is  incomprehensible how the Berlin police could permit the circulation of  so base a satire. At all events, the shade of Frederick cannot have  contemplated this scandalous scene but with indignation and disgust. His  mind, his genius, his wishes, belong to the French nation, which he  esteemed so highly, and of which he said that, if he were its king, no  cannon should be discharged in Europe without his permission. On his  return from Sans-souci the emperor visited also the tomb of Frederick  the Great. The remains of this great man are reposing in a wooden  coffin, covered with one of copper, and in a vault devoid of drapery,  trophies, or any thing that might remind the beholder of his heroic  deeds. The emperor has presented the _Hotel des Invalides_ at Paris with  the sword of Frederick, with his insignia of the order of the Black  Eagle, as well as with the stands of colors used by the king's  lifeguards in the Seven Years' War. The veterans will receive with  reverent awe every thing that belonged to one of the greatest generals  known in history.\"[18]    [Footnote 18: Goujon, \"Collection des Bulletins de Napoleon,\" vol.  xvii., Bulletin xviii.]          CHAPTER X.    NAPOLEON'S ENTRY INTO BERLIN.      The city of Berlin had not exhibited for many years so festive and  lively a spectacle as on the morning of the 27th of October. An immense  crowd was moving across the Palace Place, Broad Street, and the Linden,  toward the Brandenburg Gate, and forming in line on both sides of the  street. Thousands of boys and youths climbed the linden-trees, that  stand in two rows in the middle of this thoroughfare, causing the trees  to move to and fro under their heavy burden, and gazed with eyes full of  curiosity from their lofty position on the bustle reigning beneath.  Through the crowd hundreds of busy figures were gliding, standing still  here and there, and addressing the people in low and impressive tones;  now and then, however, they did not content themselves with mere words,  but to some handed pieces of money, and whispered, \"Drink the emperor's  health, in order that your throats may be prepared, when he makes his  entry, to shout in stentorian tones, '_Vive l'Empereur_!'\"    These liberal adherents of Napoleon were agents of the French police,  already fully organized in Berlin--the hirelings of General Clarke, who  was now governor of the capital, and treated the subjugated inhabitants  with all the haughtiness and scorn of a triumphant conqueror.    Many tears were shed in the city during these days--many imprecations  uttered, but only secretly and in a low voice, for the people could not  venture to provoke the anger of the victor, but had to bear whatever  burdens he imposed on them. The odds were too heavy; the army was  defeated; the king with his court had fled; the higher functionaries had  either concealed themselves or loudly declared their willingness to take  the oath of allegiance to the Emperor of the French, and to serve him as  their master.    What remained, therefore, for the poor inhabitants of Berlin but to  submit? All had deserted them; even the governor had escaped, and his  lieutenant, the Prince von Hatzfeld, seemed to have no other task than  to admonish them to be quiet and obedient, and to implore them to  undertake, utter, and even think nothing that might be distasteful to  the new French government; but to bow willingly and cheerfully to every  thing that the conqueror might demand.    The citizens, therefore, had bowed to their fate; they had submitted  silently, and now hastened to the Linden and the Brandenburg Gate to  witness the entry of the emperor. Not only the citizens and the people  generally desired to witness this entry--th"]]]
