Here he started as  a hosier in St. Paul's Churchyard, lodging meantime in the house of a  milliner, where he fell in love with one of the apprentices, Miss  Griffiths, 'a native of Wales.' His affections were won, we are naively  informed in the _Memoir_, by the young woman's talent in the preparation  of a vegetable pie. This is our first glimpse of Lady Phillips--'a  quiet, respectable woman,' whom Borrow was to meet at dinner long years  afterwards. Inspired, it would seem, by the kindly exhortation of Dr.  Priestley, he now transformed his hosiery business in St. Paul's  Churchyard into a 'literary repository,' and started a singularly  successful career as a publisher. There he produced his long-lived  periodical, _The Monthly Magazine_, which attained to so considerable a  fame. Dr. Aikin, a friend of Priestley's, was its editor, but with him  Phillips had a quarrel--the first of his many literary quarrels--and  they separated. This Dr. Aikin was the father of the better-known Lucy  Aikin, and was a Nonconformist who suffered for his opinions in these  closing years of the eighteenth century, even as Priestley did. He was  the author of many works, including the once famous _Evenings at Home_,  written in conjunction with his sister, Mrs. Barbauld;[51] and after his  quarrel with Phillips he founded a new publication issued by the house  of Longman, and entitled _The Athenaeum_. Hereupon he and Phillips  quarrelled again, because Dr. Aikin described himself in advertisements  of _The Athenaeum_ as 'J. Aikin, M.D., late editor of _The Monthly  Magazine_.' Aikin's contributors to _The Monthly_ included Capell Lofft,  of whom we know too little, and Dr. Wolcot, of whom we know too much.  Meanwhile Phillips's publishing business grew apace, and he removed to  larger premises in Bridge Street, Blackfriars, an address which we find  upon many famous publications of his period. A catalogue of his books  lies before me dated 'January 1805.' It includes many works still upon  our shelves. Almon's _Memoirs and Correspondence of John Wilkes_, Samuel  Richardson's _Life and Correspondence_, for example, several of the  works of Maria Edgeworth, including her _Moral Tales_, many of the works  of William Godwin, including _Caleb Williams_, and the earlier books of  that still interesting woman and once popular novelist, Lady Morgan,  whose _Poems_ as Sydney Owenson bears Phillips's name on its title-page,  as does also her first successful novel _The Wild Irish Girl_, and other  of her stories. My own interest in Phillips commenced when I met him in  the pages of Lady Morgan's _Memoirs_.[52] Thomas Moore, Lady Morgan  tells us,         had come back to Dublin from London, where he had been 'the       guest of princes, the friend of peers, the translator of       Anacreon!' From royal palaces and noble manors, he had returned       to his family seat--a grocer's shop at the corner of Little       Longford Street, Angier Street.    Here, in a little room over the shop, Sydney heard him sing two of his  songs, and was inspired thereby to write her first novels, _St. Clair_  and _The Novice of St. Dominick_. The first was published in Dublin;  over the second she corresponded with Phillips, and his letters to her  commence with one dated from Bridge Street, 6th April 1805, in which he  wishes her to send the manuscript of _The Novice_ to him as one 'often  (undeservedly) complimented as the most liberal of my trade!' She  determined, fresh from a governess situation, to bring the manuscript  herself. Phillips was charmed with his new author, and really seems to  have treated her very liberally. He insisted, however, on having _The  Novice_ cut down from six volumes to four, and she was wont to say that  nothing but regard for her feelings prevented him from reducing it to  three.[53] _The Novice of St. Dominick_ was a favourite book with the  younger Pitt, who read it over again in his last illness. Then  followed--in 1806--Sydney Owenson's new novel, _The Wild Irish Girl_,  and it led to an amusing correspondence with its author on the part of  Phillips on the one side, and Johnson, who, it will be remembered, was  Cowper's publisher, on the other. Phillips was indignant that, having  first brought Sydney into fame, she should dare to ask more money on  that account. As is the case with every novelist to-day who scores one  success, Miss Owenson had formed a good idea of her value, and there is  a letter to Johnson in which she admitted that Phillips's offer was a  generous one. Johnson had offered her L300 for the copyright of _The  Wild Irish Girl_. Phillips had offered only L200 down and L50 each for  the second and third editions. When Phillips heard that Johnson had  outbidden him, he described the offer as 'monstrous,' and that it was  'inspired by a spirit of revenge.' He would not, he declared, increase  his offer, but a little later he writes from Bridge Street to Sydney  Owenson as his 'dear, bewitching, and deluding Syren,' and promises the  L300. A few months later he gave her a hundred pounds for a slight  volume of poems, which certainly never paid for its publication,  although Scott and Moore and many another were making much money out of  poetry in those days. In any case Phillips did not accept Miss Owenson's  next story with alacrity, in spite of the undoubted success of _The Wild  Irish Girl_. She no doubt asked too much for _Ida of Athens_. Phillips  probably thought, after reading the first volume in type, that it was  very inferior work, as indeed it was. Athens was described without the  author ever having seen the city. After much wrangling, in which the  lady said that her 'prince of publishers,' as she had once called him,  had 'treated her barbarously,' the novel went into the hands of the  Longmans, who published it, not without some remonstrance as to certain  of its sentiments. The successful Lady Morgan afterwards described _Ida_  as a bad book, so perhaps here, as usually, Phillips was not far wrong  in his judgment. A similar quarrel seems to have taken place over the  next novel, _The Missionary_. Here Phillips again received the  manuscript, discussed terms with its author, and returned it. The firm  of Stockdale and Miller were his successful rivals. Later and more  prosperous novels, _O'Donnel_ in particular, were issued by Henry  Colburn, and Phillips now disappears from Lady Morgan's life. I have  told the story of Phillips's relation with Lady Morgan at length because  at no other point do we come into so near a contact with him. In Fell's  _Memoir_ Phillips is described--in 1808--as 'certainly now the first  publisher in London,' but while he may have been this in the volume of  his trade--and school-books made an important part of it--he was not in  mere 'names.' Most of his successful writers--Sydney Owenson, Thomas  Skinner Surr, Dr. Gregory, and the rest--have now fallen into oblivion.  The school-books that he issued have lasted even to our own day, notably  Dr. Mavor's _Spelling Book_. Dr. Mavor was a Scotsman from Aberdeen, who  came to London and became Phillips's chief hack. There are no less than  twenty of Mavor's school-books in the catalogue before me. They include  Mavor's _History of England_, Mavor's _Universal History_, and Mavor's  _History of Greece_. In the _Memoir_ of 1808 it is claimed that 'Mavor'  is but a pseudonym for Phillips, and the claim is also made, quite  wrongfully, by John Timbs, who, before he became acting editor of the  _Illustrated London News_ under Herbert Ingram, and an indefatigable  author, was Phillips's private secretary.[54] It seems clear, however,  that in the case of Blair's _Catechism_ and Goldsmith's _Geography_, and  many another book for schools, Phillips was 'Blair' and 'Goldsmith' and  many another imaginary person, for the books in question numbered about  two hundred in all. For these books there must have been quite an army  of literary hacks employed during the twenty years prior to the  appearance of George Borrow in that great army. On 9th November 1807,  the Lord Mayor's procession through London included Richard Phillips  among its sheriffs, and he was knighted by George III. in the following  year. During his period of office he effected many reforms in the City  prisons. John Timbs, in his _Walks and Talks about London_, tells us  that Phillips's colleague in the shrievalty was one Smith, who  afterwards became Lord Mayor:         The _personnel_ of the two sheriffs presented a sharp contrast.       Smith loved aldermanic cheer, but was pale and cadaverous in       complexion; whilst Phillips, who never ate animal food, was       rosy and healthful in appearance. One day, when the sheriffs       were in full state, the procession was stopped by an       obstruction in the street traffic; when droll were the mistakes       of the mob: to Smith they cried, 'Here's Old Water-gruel!' to       Phillips, 'Here's Roast Beef! something like an Englishman!'    Two volumes before me show Phillips as the precursor of many of the  publishers of one-volume books of reference so plentiful in our day. _A  Million of Facts_ is one of them, and _A Chronology of Public Events  Within the Last Fifty Years from 1771 to 1821_ is another, while one of  the earliest and most refreshing guides to London and its neighbourhood  is afforded us in _A Morning Walk from London to Kew_, which first  appeared in _The Monthly Magazine_, but was reprinted in 1817 with the  name 'Sir Richard Phillips' as author on the title-page. Phillips was  now no longer a publisher.

But he had no  money, and one can do nothing without money!    Then there came back to him the face of the Englishman he had seen  talking to the violinist of the Paradiso. He hated the man because he  was ugly and rich. These English were all rich, and yet they seemed to  him a miserable race, mere ignorant bullies. He remembered how often he  had come to the help of the English travellers who filled Egypt. Why had  he, he asked himself, for the sake of a miserable reward, prevented them  being cheated, when he, with all his talents, was condemned to starve?  Even his child, he thought, would grow to hate him if he remained poor.  He must get money. Amos would have to lend him some. The Jews were  unpopular among the Greeks; it were wise to keep on good terms with  them, as Amos would find out.    At last he fell asleep.    In the morning his troubles began again. There was no coffee, and only a  little Arab bread, and when that was done they must starve if they could  not get some money. Gregorio tore off a bit of bread and ate it slowly,  looking at his wife, who sat weeping beside him.    \"I shall go to Amos,\" he said, firmly.    \"Ah, yes, to Amos,\" Xantippe answered quietly; \"but it will be no good.\"    \"Why no good?\"    \"Because you owe him money, and he will give you no more till he is  paid.\"    \"But we cannot pay him. He must let us have some. If not--\" and Gregorio  raised threatening.    His wife smiled sadly and kissed him.    \"You will not frighten Amos, my love. When I told him the child had been  ill, he only laughed.\"    \"When was that?\"    \"Yesterday.\"    \"Then he had been here?\"    \"He came last night to ask for his money. I told him we had none, and  he laughed and said we must get some. He told me I might get some if I  cared to. He said I could make, oh, so much!\"    Gregorio scowled savagely. \"The filthy Jew! he said that? Never, never,  never!\"    \"But we must get some money,\" the woman sobbed, \"if only for our son's  sake, Gregorio. But not that way?\"    \"No, not that way,\" he replied, savagely.    \"When shall you go to him?\"    \"Now.\"    And taking up his hat he rushed into the street. He was terribly angry,  not so much at the purport of the Jew's speech as at the man who made  it. He loathed the Jews, and felt insulted when spoken to by one; it was  a terrible matter to ask this man for help, but it was intolerable that  his wife should suffer insult. And yet the child must be fed. Yes, she  had said that, and it was true. They must make sacrifices for the child.    He soon reached the Jew's house, and was shown by a richly clad servant  into the room where Amos sat. Amos was an old man, tall and strong, with  a long bushy beard, in which his fingers continually played; and his  eyes were sharp and brilliant and restless, a strange contrast to his  stately bearing and measured movements. He rose from his cushions as  Gregorio entered, and saluted him courteously, motioning him to a seat.  Then, having resettled himself, he clapped his hands together smartly  and ordered the servant who answered the summons to bring in coffee and  pipes.    Gregorio was rather overawed at the luxury he saw around him, and he  felt the stern-looking, polite old man would be a difficult person to  deal with. As he puffed at his tube he considered carefully what words  he should use.    For some time neither spoke, but Amos was the first to break the  silence.    \"You heard I was at your house last night, and so have come to pay me?\"    \"Yes, I heard you were at my house and that you wanted to be paid. You  are a rich man, and I am poor.\"    \"Nay, I am not rich; they lie who say I am rich.\"    \"It is twenty pounds I owe you, is it not?\"    \"Yes, twenty pounds. It is a large sum, and I have dealt generously with  you. I am now in need of it myself.\"    \"I am a poor man.\"    \"You have not the money, eh, my friend?\"    \"I have not the money. But I will pay you if you will lend me some more.  I shall be successful now; only twenty pounds more.\"    Amos appeared unmoved at the tremor in Gregorio's voice. His eyes rested  coldly on the face of his client, while the unfortunate Greek continued  to speak rapidly of his troubles and hopes. He smiled sarcastically as  Gregorio spoke of the certainty of making his fortune at Benhur, and  remained quite unmoved at the story of the sufferings of a woman and  child from hunger and want.    \"Your wife is beautiful,\" was all he answered when Gregorio paused for  a moment. At these words, however, he half rose from his place and  clinched his hands savagely. But he sank back again with the remembrance  that a show of temper would not advance his cause.    \"Very beautiful,\" he answered, chokingly; \"would you see her starve?\"    \"She is not my wife,\" said Amos, quietly. Then he continued slowly,  pausing at intervals to puff out a cloud of smoke from his mouth:    \"You have owed me this money a long time. I want it, and I will have it.  Even in Egypt there is law. You do not like us Jews, but the law will  protect me as long as I am rich enough to buy justice. In three days  you will pay me this money. I have been generous to you; now I will be  generous no longer. If I am not paid I will take measures to recover my  loss. You will sleep in the streets like the Arabs, my friend; but  the weather is warm. It is early summer, so you will scarcely feel the  exposure. In three days you will come and pay me.\"    \"But how am I to get the money? If you would lend me only a few pounds I  would repay you all I owe.\"    \"Already you owe me more than you can pay. You can make money. You are  married. These Christian women are worse than the Arabs; do I not see  them as I come home in the evening from my business? It is not right to  borrow and not repay. I need my money. How can I have my coffee and my  pipe unless I have money?\"    Gregorio listened with growing anger, and finally rose from his seat and  shook his fist in the old man's face.    \"You shall be paid,\" he shouted, \"you shall be paid!\"    \"Anger is useless, my friend.\"    And as Gregorio left the house Amos smiled and stroked his beard.  \"Truly,\" he thought, \"these Christians hate us, but we have them in our  power. It is pleasant to be hated and yet to know that it is to us they  must cringe when they are in need; and it is very pleasant to refuse. My  friend Gregorio is not happy now that he is struggling in my grasp.\"    As for Gregorio, he wandered away toward the harbour, kicking savagely  at the refuse scattered along the pavement. He did not know how to set  about earning the requisite sum. It was no good applying to the hotels  or tourist agencies, for there were few visitors in the city and  dragomen were therefore not needed.    His friends were too poor to help him, and the consul was unable to do  much for him, there were so many poor Greeks who wanted help. Meanwhile  there was no food at home and no drink; even the necessaries of life  were lacking.    On arriving at his home he found his wife and child huddled in a corner  crying for food. They ran toward him as he entered, but the hope in  their faces quickly faded at the sight of him.    \"It's no good,\" Gregorio growled; \"Amos refuses to advance a piastre and  says I must pay all I owe in three days.\"    \"It is impossible to sleep when one is hungry,\" said Gregorio that night  to his wife, who lay awake, weeping, beside him.          III--OF FAILURE AND A RESOLVE    Gregorio's dreams, when he did sleep, were none of the pleasantest,  and when he woke up, from time to time, he heard his wife weeping. In  wondering what he should say to comfort her he fell asleep again, and  sleeping was worse than lying awake. For in his dreams he saw Xantippe  and his child starving and crying for food, and he was unable to help  them in any way. He lived over again the long day he had spent tramping  the streets of Alexandria searching for work. He saw the few tourists  still left in the town fat and happy; he saw the porters of the hotels  who had smiled on him pityingly and yet contemptuously; and he woke,  after each representation of the crude comedy, hot and yet cold with  perspiration, to feel the bed on which he lay shaking under the sobs of  his wife.    When at last day dawned Gregorio raised himself with an oath, and swore  to find food for his family and work for himself. The terrible debt he  owed to Amos he swore should not trouble him, laughing at his wife's  remonstrances. With the bright daylight had come a new courage, and,  hungry as he was, he felt able not only to satisfy their hunger, but so  skilfully to arrange matters that they would never feel hungry again.  Yet is was a terrible ordeal, that half-hour when the family should have  sat down to a table laden with food. The poor wife cried, and he had  to comfort her tears with promises, unsubstantial nutriment indeed,  and they could not satisfy the child, who failed dismally to understand  them. Through the green blinds came the noise of life and health and  merriment; curses too, sometimes, but only the curses of the well fed,  and therefore meaningless. Already the sun fell hot and indomitable on  the room, and the atmosphere at their touch became stifling. Gregorio,  swallowing his tears, tore out into the street, shouting up the narrow  stairway hysterical words of hope.    How long and shadowless the street seemed! Every house had its green  blinds closely shut; the wind that stirred the dust of the pavements was  hot and biting. Gregorio clinched his hands and strode rapidly onward.  What mattered it to him that behind those green blinds women and men  slumbered in comparative comfort? He had a work to do, and by sunset  must carry good tidings to his little world. For a time his heart was  brave as the dry wind scorched the tear upon his cheek. \"Surely,\" he  thought, weaving his thoughts into a fine marching rhythm, \"the"]]]
