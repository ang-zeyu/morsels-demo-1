[_She walks about. Vasantasena appears, dressed, but still  asleep. The maid discovers her._] It is time to get up, mistress. The  morning is here.    _Vasantasena._ [_Awakening._] What! is the night over? is it morning?    _Maid._ For us it is morning. But for my mistress it appears to be  night still.    _Vasantasena._ But girl, where is your gambler?    _Maid._ Mistress, after giving Vardhamanaka his orders, Charudatta  went to the old garden Pushpakaranda.    _Vasantasena._ What orders?    _Maid._ To have the bullock-cart ready before daylight; for, he  said, Vasantasena was to come--    _Vasantasena._ Where, girl?    _Maid._ Where Charudatta is.    _Vasantasena._ [_Embraces the maid._] I did not have a good look at  him in the evening. But to-day I shall see him face to face. Tell  me, girl. Have I found my way into the inner court?    _Maid._ You have found your way not only into the inner court,  but into the heart of every one who lives here.    _Vasantasena._ Tell me, are Charudatta's servants vexed?    _Maid._ They will be.    _Vasantasena._ When?    _Maid._ When my mistress goes away.    _Vasantasena._ But not so much as I shall be. [_Persuasively._] Here,  girl, take this pearl necklace. You must go and give it to my lady  sister, his good wife. And give her this message: \"Worthy Charudatta's  virtues have won me, made me his slave, and therefore your  slave also. And so I hope that these pearls may adorn your neck.\"    [94.3. S.    _Maid._ But mistress, Charudatta will be angry with you.    _Vasantasena._ Go. He will not be angry.    _Maid._ [_Takes the necklace._] Yes, mistress. [_She goes out, then  returns._] Mistress, his lady wife says that her lord made you a present  of it, and it would not be right for her to accept it. And further, that  you are to know that her lord and husband is her most excellent  adornment.    [_Enter Radanika, with Charudatta's little son._]    _Radanika._ Come, dear, let's play with your little cart.    _Rohasena._ [_Peevishly._] I don't like this little clay cart, Radanika.  Give me my gold cart.    _Radanika._ [_Sighing wearily._] How should we have anything to do  with gold now, my child? When your papa is rich again, then you  shall have a gold cart to play with. But I'll amuse him by taking  him to see Vasantasena. [_She approaches Vasantasena._] Mistress,  my service to you.    _Vasantasena._ I am glad to see you, Radanika. But whose little  boy is this? He wears no ornaments, yet his dear little face makes  my heart happy.    _Radanika._ This is Charudatta's son, Rohasena.    _Vasantasena._ [_Stretches out her arms._] Come, my boy, and put  your little arms around me. [_She takes him on her lap._] He looks  just like his father.    _Radanika._ More than looks like him, he _is_ like him. At least I  think so. His father is perfectly devoted to him.    _Vasantasena._ But what is he crying about?    _Radanika._ He used to play with a gold cart that belongs to the  son of a neighbor. But that was taken away, and when he asked  for it, I made him this little clay cart. But when I gave it to him,  he said \"I don't like this little clay cart, Radanika. Give me my  gold cart.\"    P. 158.10]    _Vasantasena._ Oh, dear! To think that this little fellow has to suffer  because others are wealthy. Ah, mighty Fate! the destinies of men,  uncertain as the water-drops which fall upon a lotus-leaf, seem to  thee but playthings! [_Tearfully._] Don't cry, my child. You shall  have a gold cart to play with.    _Rohasena._ Who is she, Radanika?    _Vasantasena._ A slave of your father's, won by his virtues.    _Radanika._ My child, the lady is your mother.    _Rohasena._ That's a lie, Radanika. If the lady is my mother, why  does she wear those pretty ornaments?    _Vasantasena._ My child, your innocent lips can say terrible things.  [_She removes her ornaments. Weeping._] Now I am your mother.  You shall take these ornaments and have a gold cart made for you.    _Rohasena._ Go away! I won't take them. You're crying.    _Vasantasena._ [_Wiping away her tears._] I'll not cry, dear. There!  go and play. [_She fills the clay cart with her jewels._] There, dear,  you must have a little gold cart made for you.                                          [_Exit Radanika, with Rohasena._    [_Enter Vardhamanaka, driving a bullock-cart._]    _Vardhamanaka._ Radanika, Radanika! Tell mistress Vasantasena  that the covered cart is standing ready at the side-door.    _Radanika._ [_Entering._] Mistress, Vardhamanaka is here, and he  says that the cart is waiting at the side-door.    _Vasantasena._ He must wait a minute, girl, while I get ready.    _Rad._ Wait a minute, Vardhamanaka, while she gets ready.   [_Exit._    _Vardhamanaka._ Hello, I've forgotten the cushion. I must go and  get it. But the nose-rope makes the bullocks skittish. I suppose I  had better take the cart along with me.                     [_Exit._    [96.14. S.    _Vasantasena._ Bring me my things, girl. I must make myself ready.

Get up, bullocks, get up!  [_He drives about and looks around._] Why, the road is blocked with  villagers' carts. What am I to do now? [_Haughtily._] Get out of my way,  you! Get out of my way! [_He listens._] What's that? you want to know  whose cart this is? This cart belongs to Sansthanaka, the king's  brother-in-law. So get out of my way--and this minute, too! [_He looks  about._] Why, here's a man going in the other direction as fast as he  can. He is trying to hide like a runaway gambler, and he looks at me as  if I were the gambling-master. I wonder who he is. But then, what  business is it of mine? I must get there as soon as I can. Get out of my  way, you villagers, get out of my way! What's that? you want me to wait  a minute and put a shoulder to your wheel? Confound you! A brave man  like me, that serves Sansthanaka, the king's brother-in-law, put a  shoulder to your wheel? After all, the poor fellow is quite alone. I'll  do it. I'll stop my cart at the side-door to Charudatta's orchard. [_He  does so._] I'm coming!                                         [_Exit._    _Maid._ Mistress, I think I hear the sound of wheels. The cart  must be here.    _Vasantasena._ Come, girl. My heart grows impatient. Go with me  to the side-door.    _Maid._ Follow me, mistress.    _Vasantasena._ [_Walks about._] You have earned a rest, girl.    _Maid._ Thank you, mistress.                                [_Exit._    _Vasantasena._ [_Feels her right eye twitch_[68] _as she enters the  cart._] Why should my right eye twitch now? But the sight of Charudatta  will smooth away the bad omen. [_Enter Sthavaraka._]    P. 169.8]    _Sthavaraka._ I've cleared the carts out of the way, and now I'll  go ahead. [_He mounts and drives away. To himself._] The cart has  grown heavy. But I suppose it only seems so, because I got tired  helping them with that wheel. Well, I'll go along. Get up, bullocks,  get up!    _A voice behind the scenes._ Police! Police! Every man at his post!  The young herdsman has just broken jail, killed the jailer, broken  his fetters, escaped, and run away. Catch him! Catch him!    [_Enter, in excited haste, Aryaka, an iron chain on one foot. Covering  his face, he walks about._]    _Sthavaraka._ [_To himself._] There is great excitement in the city. I  must get out of the way as fast as I possibly can.

Why, I declare you're as thin  as a hurdle, and as black under the eyes as if you had been fighting  with a collier.  You ought to be ashamed of yourself!  Look at me; do  all I can I can't get up an interesting pallor like you, and I've  fretted enough over those conic sections (comic sections Jim always  calls them).  Never mind!  Wait till I get you down to the sea.\"    And so he rattled on, while Tom leaned back in his seat and winced at  every word.    When they reached Mr Newcome's of course there was a scene of eager  welcome on one side and boisterous glee on the other.  Tom, as he looked  on, sighed, as well he might, and wished he could have been spared the  torture of this day.    Charlie tore himself away from his mother, to drag his friend into the  house.    \"Look at this object!\" he cried; \"did you ever see such a caution to  students?  If we do nothing else in Kent we shall scare the crows, eh,  Tom?\"    \"Charlie!\" exclaimed his mother; \"you have come home quite rude!  I hope  you'll excuse him, Mr Drift.\"    Mr Drift said nothing, and looked and felt extremely miserable.    \"He looks really ill, poor fellow!\" said Mrs Newcome to her husband.  \"I wonder they allow the students to overwork themselves in that way.\"    And then they sat down to dinner--a meal as distasteful to Tom as it was  joyful to Charlie and his parents.        CHAPTER FOURTEEN.    HOW TOM DRIFT PARTED WITH HIS BEST FRIEND.    Charlie could not fail to discover before long that there was something  wrong with my master.    Never before had he known him so silent, so spiritless, so mysterious.  No effort could rouse him into cheerfulness or conversation, and for the  first time for three years Charlie felt that Tom was sorry to see him.  Naturally, he put it all down to the results of overwork.  Tom in his  letters had always represented himself as engrossed in study.  Even the  few hurried scrawls of the past few weeks he had excused on the same  ground.  It never once occurred to the simple-minded schoolboy that a  chum of his could possibly be struggling in the agonies of shame and  temptation and he know nothing of it; he who knew so little of evil  himself, was not the one to think or imagine evil where any other  explanation was possible.    And yet Tom's manner was so strange and altered, that he determined, as  soon as they should find themselves alone, to make an effort to  ascertain its cause.    The opportunity came when the two youths, having bid farewell to Mr and  Mrs Newcome, found themselves at last in Tom's lodgings in Grime  Street.    \"Well,\" said Charlie, with all the show of cheerfulness he could muster,  for his spirits had been strangely damped by the irresponsive gloom of  his old schoolfellow--\"well! here's the den at last.  Upon my word, old  man, I've seen livelier holes!  Why don't you explore and find some  place a trifle less dead-alive?  But I dare say it's convenient to be  near the Hospital, and when a fellow's working, it doesn't much matter  what sort of a place he's in, as long as there's not a row going on  under his window--and I don't suppose there's much chance of that here,\"  said Charlie, looking out into the black street with a kind of shudder.    Tom said nothing; he wished his friend would not everlastingly be  talking of hard work and study in the way he did.  However Charlie  intended it, it was neither more nor less than a talking at him, and  that he could not stand.    Charlie took no notice of his silence, but continued his inspection of  the dismal apartment, lighting up with pleasure at the sight of the old  Randlebury relics.    \"My old rod!\" exclaimed he, taking down the very rod with the lance-wood  top which had figured so conspicuously in a certain adventure three  years ago; \"how jolly to see it again!  I'm afraid you don't get much  use for it here.  And our fencing-sticks, too; see, Tom, here's the very  place where you got under my guard and snipped a bit out of the basket.  Ha, ha! what a crack that was!  And here's the picture of old  Randlebury, with you at your window, and me lying on the grass (and  looking uncommonly like a recently felled tree).  Look here, Tom, this  window here is where Jim and I hang out now.  It used to be Callaghan's.  By the way, do you ever see Call?  He's in London, articled to a  solicitor.  A pretty lawyer he'll make!  Have you seen him yet, Tom?\"    Tom, during this rattle, had been looking listlessly out of the window.  He now turned round with a start and said--    \"Eh? what did you say?\"    The look which accompanied the words was so haggard and miserable, that  Charlie's pity was instantly touched.  He stepped across the room and  put his arm in Tom's as he stood, and said,--    \"Tom, old boy, what's wrong?\"    Tom said nothing, but walked away and leaned against the mantelpiece.    \"What is it, Tom?  Are you ill, or in trouble?  You'll tell me, won't  you?\"    Tom still remained silent, but his flushing face and restless lips  showed that the appeal had at least been heard.    \"Old boy,\" continued Charlie, venturing again nearer, \"we never used to  have secrets.  I'm sure something's the matter.  Mayn't I know what it  is?  Very likely I can't help you; but I could try.\"    Tom's lips quivered.  The old influence was fast coming back.  Already  in his mind he was picturing himself telling Charlie all and with his  help extricating himself from the slough into which he had sunk.  How  _could_ he stand unmoved with that voice, familiar by many a memory of  simple courageous goodness, again falling on his ear; and that appealing  face, one so loved and delighted in, again turned to his?    \"I'm afraid it's something more than ill health, old boy.  You've  something on your mind.  Oh! why won't you at least tell me what it is?\"    Tom could stand it no longer.  He _must_ speak.  Whatever the confession  cost him, whatever its effect would be on his old schoolfellow's  friendship, Charlie must know all.  To him at least he could not play  the hypocrite or the deceiver.  He had turned from the mantelpiece, his  hand was held out to take that of his friend's, he was just about to  speak, when the door of his room opened, and there entered Gus,  Mortimer, and two companions.    \"Here he is!\" cried Gus, not noticing that Tom had company.  \"Tommy, old  man, you're in luck.  Old Owl has got a supper on to-night, no end of  punch, my boy, and he's expecting you; and afterwards we're going for a  regular night of it to the-- Hullo! who's your friend?\"    He caught sight of Charlie at this moment, and for an instant failed to  recognise in Tom's companion the boy whom he had treated so shamefully  at Gurley races.  But he remembered him in a moment.    \"What, surely--yet upon my honour so it is, our young sporting friend.  How are you, Charlie, my boy?  Here's a game!  You'll come too, of  course?  Mortimer, this fellow is Drift's special--up to all the  wrinkles, no end of a knowing blade.\"    During this brief and rapid salutation Tom and Charlie, I need hardly  say, were speechless.  One in utter despair, the other in utter rage and  astonishment.  In both the revulsion of feeling caused by the  interruption was almost stupefying, and they stood for a moment staring  at the intruders in simple bewilderment.    Tom was the first to find words.  His cheeks were white, and his voice  almost choked as he said to Gus,--    \"I wish you'd go.  I'm engaged.\"    \"So you are,\" said Gus, with a sneer; \"but I say.  Tom, old man, I wish  you'd come.  It's too good a thing to miss.\"    \"Go away!\" almost gasped Tom.    \"Oh, of course an Englishman's house is his castle,\" said Gus, offended  at this unusual rebuff; \"you're a fool, though, that's all.  We were  going to have a spree to-night that would make all sprees of the past  month look foolish.  Come along, don't be an ass; and bring young  mooney-face; I dare say by this time he knows what's what as well as you  or me, Tom; eh, Jack?\"    \"Lookth tho,\" replied the amused Jack.    By this time Charlie had found words.  The truth of course had all  flashed in upon him; he knew the secret now of Tom's strange manner, of  the neglected letters, of the haggard looks, of the reluctant welcome.    And he knew, too, that but for this untimely incursion he would have  heard it all from Tom himself, penitent and humble, instead of, as now,  hardened and desperate.    And he recognised in the miserable little swaggering dandy before him  the author and the promoter of his friend's ruin; on him therefore his  sudden rage expended itself.    \"You little cowardly wretch!\" he exclaimed, addressing Gus, \"haven't you  done mischief enough to Tom already?  Go out of his room!\"    Poor Charlie!  Nothing could have been more fatal to his hopes than this  rash outbreak.  The words had scarcely escaped his lips before he saw  the mischief he had done.    Tom's manner suddenly altered.  All signs of shame and penitence  disappeared as he stepped with a swagger up to Charlie and exclaimed,--    \"What business have you to attack my friends?  Get out yourself!\"    \"Bravo, Tom, old man,\" cried the delighted Gus.  \"Do you hear, young  prig? walk off, you're not wanted here.\"    Charlie stood for one moment stunned and irresolute.  Had there been in  Tom's face the faintest glimmer of regret, or the faintest trace of the  old affection, he would have stayed and braved all consequences.  But  there was neither.  The spell that bound Tom Drift, his fear of being  thought a milksop, had changed him utterly, and as Charlie's eyes turned  with pleading look to his they met only with menace and confusion.    \"Go!\" repeated Tom, driven nearly wild by the mocking laugh in which  Mortimer and his two companions joined.    This, then, was the end of their friendship--so full of hope on one  side, so full of promise on the other.    It was a strange moment in the lives of those two.  To one it was the"]]]
