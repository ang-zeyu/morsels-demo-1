So vague and undefined an influence as that exerted by the  larger forms of surrounding nature are seldom recognized and  acknowledged by the artisan; on the contrary, experiments, resulting in  improvement, are largely prompted by practical requirements.  Particularly is this the case in the art of house-building.    SHUMOPAVI.    This village, although not so isolated as Oraibi, has no near neighbors  and is little visited by whites or Indians. The inhabitants are rarely  seen at the trading post to which the others resort, and they seem to be  pretty well off and independent as compared with their neighbors of the  other villages (Pl. XXXIV). The houses and courts are in keeping with  the general character of the people and exhibit a degree of neatness and  thrift that contrasts sharply with the tumble-down appearance of some of  the other villages, especially those of the Middle Mesa and Oraibi.  There is a general air of newness about the place, though it is  questionable whether the architecture is more recent than that of the  other villages of Tusayan. This effect is partly due to the custom of  frequently renewing the coating of mud plaster. In most of the villages  little care is taken to repair the houses until the owner feels that to  postpone such action longer would endanger its stability. Many of the  illustrations in this chapter indicate the proportion of rough masonry  usually exposed in the walls. At Shumopavi (Pl. XXXV), however, most of  the walls are smoothly plastered. In this respect they resemble Zuñi and  the eastern pueblos, where but little naked masonry can be seen. Another  feature that adds to the effect of neatness and finish in this village  is the frequent use of a whitewash of gypsum on the outer face of the  walls. This wash is used partly as an ornament and partly as protection  against the rain. The material, called by the Mexicans \"yeso,\" is very  commonly used in the interior of their houses throughout this region,  both by Mexicans and Indians. More rarely it is used among the pueblos  as an external wash. Here, however, its external use forms quite a  distinctive feature of the village. The same custom in several of the  cliff houses of Canyon de Chelly attests the comparative antiquity of  the practice, though not necessarily its pre-Columbian origin.    Shumopavi, compared with the other villages, shows less evidence of  having been built on the open court idea, as the partial inclosures  assume such elongated forms in the direction of the long, straight rows  of the rooms; yet examination shows that the idea was present to a  slight extent.    At the southeast corner of the pueblo there is a very marked approach to  the open court, though it is quite evident that the easternmost row has  its back to the court, and that the few rooms that face the other way  are later additions. In fact, the plan of the village and the  distribution of the terraces seem to indicate that the first  construction consisted only of a single row facing nearly east, and was  not an inclosed court, and that a further addition to the pueblo assumed  nearly the same form, with its face or terraced side toward the back of  the first row only partly adapting itself by the addition of a few small  rooms later, to the court arrangement, the same operation being  continued, but in a form not so clearly defined, still farther toward  the west.    The second court is not defined on the west by such a distinct row as  the others, and the smaller clusters that to some extent break the long,  straight arrangement bring about an approximation to a court, though  here again the terraces only partly face it, the eastern side being  bounded by the long exterior wall of the middle row, two and three  stories high, and almost unbroken throughout its entire length of 400  feet. The broken character of the small western row, in conjunction with  the clusters near it, imparts a distinct effect to the plan of this  portion, differentiating it in character from the masses of houses  formed by the other two rows. The latter are connected at their southern  end by a short cross row which converts this portion of the village  practically into a single large house. Two covered passageways, however,  which are designated on the plan, give access to the southeast portion  of the court. This portion is partly separated from the north half of  the inclosure by encroaching groups of rooms. This partial division of  the original narrow and long court appears to be of later date.      [Illustration: Plate XXXII. A covered passageway of Shupaulovi.]    The kivas are four in number, of which but one is within the village.  The latter occupies a partly inclosed position in the southwest portion,  and probably owes its place to some local facility for building a kiva  on this spot in the nature of a depression in the mesa summit; but even  with such aid the ceremonial chamber was built only partly under ground,  as may be seen in Fig. 14. The remaining three kivas are more distinctly  subterranean, and in order to obtain a suitable site one of these was  located at a distance of more than 200 feet from the village, toward the  mesa edge on the east. The other two are built very close together,  apparently in contact, just beyond the northern extremity of the  village. One of these is about 3 feet above the surface at one corner,  but nearly on a level with the ground at its western side where it  adjoins its neighbor. These two kivas are illustrated in Pl. LXXXVIII  and Fig. 21.      [Illustration: Fig. 14. Court kiva of Shumopavi.]    Here again we find that the ceremonial chamber that forms so important a  feature among these people, occupies no fixed relation to the dwellings,  and its location is largely a matter of accident, a site that would  admit of the partial excavation or sinking of the chamber below the  surface being the main requisite. The northwest court contains another  of the small inclosed shrines already described as occurring at  Shupaulovi and elsewhere.    The stonework of this village also possesses a somewhat distinctive  character. Exposed masonry, though comparatively rare in this  well-plastered pueblo, shows that stones of suitable fracture were  selected and that they were more carefully laid than in the other  villages. In places the masonry bears a close resemblance to some of the  ancient work, where the spaces between the longer tablets of stone were  carefully chinked with small bits of stone, bringing the whole wall to a  uniform face, and is much in advance of the ordinary slovenly methods of  construction followed in Tusayan.    Shumopavi is the successor of an older village of that name, one of the  cities of the ancient Tusayan visited by a detachment of Coronado's  expedition in 1540. The ruins of that village still exist, and they  formerly contained vestiges of the old church and mission buildings  established by the monks. The squared beams from, these buildings were  considered valuable enough to be incorporated in the construction of  ceremonial kivas in some of the Tusayan villages. This old site was not  visited by the party.    ORAIBI.    This is one of the largest modern pueblos, and contains nearly half the  population of Tusayan; yet its great size has not materially affected  the arrangement of the dwellings. The general plan (see Pl. XXXVI),  simply shows an unusually large collection of typical Tusayan  house-rows, with the general tendency to face eastward displayed in the  other villages of the group. There is a remarkable uniformity in the  direction of the rows, but there are no indications of the order in  which the successive additions to the village were made, such as were  found at Mashóngnavi.    The clusters of rooms do not surpass the average dimensions of those in  the smaller villages. In five of the clusters in Oraibi a height of four  stories is reached by a few rooms; a height seen also in Walpi.    At several points in Oraibi, notably on the west side of cluster No. 7,  may be seen what appears to be low terraces faced with rough masonry.  The same thing is also seen at Walpi, on the west side of the  northernmost cluster. This effect is produced by the gradual filling in  of abandoned and broken-down marginal houses, with fallen masonry and  drifted sand. The appearance is that of intentional construction, as may  be seen in Pl. XXXIX.      [Illustration: Plate XXXIII. The chief kiva of Shupaulovi.]    The rarity of covered passageways in this village is noteworthy, and  emphasizes the marked difference in the character of the Tusayan and  Zuñi ground plans. The close crowding of rooms in the latter has made a  feature of the covered way, which in the scattered plan of Oraibi is  rarely called for. When found it does not seem an outgrowth of the same  conditions that led to its adoption in Zuñi. A glance at the plans will  show how different has been the effect of the immediate environment in  the two cases. In Zuñi, built on a very slight knoll in the open plain,  the absence of a defensive site has produced unusual development of the  defensive features of the architecture, and the result is a remarkably  dense clustering of the dwellings. At Tusayan, on the other hand, the  largest village of the group does not differ in character from the  smallest. Occupation of a defensive site has there, in a measure taken  the place of a special defensive arrangement, or close clustering of  rooms. Oraibi is laid out quite as openly as any other of the group, and  as additions to its size have from time to time been made the builders  have, in the absence of the defensive motive for crowding the rows or  groups into large clusters, simply followed the usual arrangement. The  crowding that brought about the use of the covered way was due in Walpi  to restricted site, as nearly all the available summit of its"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19870"],[0,"Illuminated Manuscripts (#20)"],[1,"accepted this peculiarity as  part of the scheme, and all that followed as a natural consequence and  development. But it is curious that as a system worked out by many minds  pointed architecture should thus begin. First come thorns and cusps and  lanceolate forms without foliage. Then, not perfect leaves, but buds. In  due time the bud opens, at first into the profile coil, and by-and-by  into the full-spread leaf. Then comes the flower, and finally the fruit.  After that, rottenness and decay. It is curious that this should  actually take place through a course of centuries. That it should be  reflected in book illumination is simply the usual order of things--the  fact has been frequently observed, and as it is curious, we call  attention to it. But, as we have said, the great change itself was  brought about by the influence of lay artists, and chiefly by the  freemasons.    Who and what the freemasons were everybody is supposed to know, but on  inquiry we find very few people indeed know anything definite about  them. Of course we do not refer to the friendly societies or social  guilds that now bear the name, but to the mediæval builders. \"Everybody  knows,\" says Batissier,[33] \"that the study of the sciences and of  literature and the practice of the various branches of art took refuge  in the monasteries during the irruptions of the barbarians and the  strife of international war. In those retreats, not only painting,  sculpture, engraving on metals, and mosaic, but also architecture were  cultivated. If the question arose about building a church, it was nearly  always an ecclesiastic who furnished the plan and monks who carried out  the works under his direction. The brethren in travelling from convent  to convent naturally exercised a reciprocal influence over each other.  We conceive, then, that the abbeys of any given Order would put in vogue  the same style, and that the art would be modified under certain points  of view, in the same manner in each country.\"    [33] _Hist. de l' Art Monumental_, p. 466, Paris, 1845, I. 8°.    \"It is certain, moreover, that outside the cloisters there were also  troops of workmen not monastics, who laboured under the direction of the  latter.\"    \"Masons were associated among them in the same way as other trade  corporations. It was the same with these corporations in the South as  with the communes--the _débris_ of the Roman organisation; they took  refuge in the Church, and had arrived at a condition of public life and  independence, when order was established between the commune, the  Seignory, and the Church.\"    \"During the twelfth and thirteenth centuries these corporations were  organised into recognised fraternities having their own statutes, but  there is abundant evidence of their having a much earlier existence.\"    \"A great number of masons were trained in Italy, and came from Lombardy,  which in the tenth century even was an active centre of civilisation.  Italy had its corporations of masons called _maestri comaccini_,  enjoying exclusive privileges, who, having passed the different degrees  of apprenticeship, became 'accepted'[34] masons, and had the right of  exercising their profession wherever they might be. The sovereigns of  different countries granted them special privileges, and the popes  protected them in all Catholic countries where they might travel. Thus  the lodges grew and prospered. The Greek artists who had fled from  Constantinople during the various Iconoclast persecutions had got  themselves enrolled in the ranks of the freemasons, and taught their  fellow-masons their Byzantine methods.\"    [34] German \"angenommen.\"    \"Speedily these corporations spread through France, England, and  Germany, where they were employed almost exclusively by the religious  Orders, in building their churches and conventual buildings.\"    While, therefore, the general plan and rules of construction were common  to all members of the fraternity, the details were almost entirely left,  under regulations, to the individual taste of certain members of each  band of workmen, who, being all qualified artists, were quite capable of  putting in execution, and with masterly skill, any such minutiæ of  ornament as might be left to their discretion.[35] Local illuminators  would thus speedily get hold of every novelty, and the page of the  Psalter or Bible would become, as a French writer has explained it, a  _vitrail sur velin_. If not indeed exclusively following the stained  glass, they copied the mural decorations, and so we find the backgrounds  of the miniatures, whether fitted into the initials or placed separately  in framed mouldings, faithfully reproducing the imbrications,  _carrelages_, panellings, and diapers of these mural enrichments.    [35] Governor Pownall (\"Observations on the Origin and Progress of Gothic  Architecture, and on the Corporation of Freemasons,\" _Archæologia_,  1788, vol. 9, pp. 110-126) was of opinion that \"the Collegium or  Corporation of Freemasons, were the first formers of Gothic architecture  into a regular and scientific order by applying the models and  proportions of timber framework to building in stone,\" and that this  method \"came into use and application about the close of the twelfth or  commencement of the thirteenth century.\" See also Gould (R.F.), _History  of Freemasonry_, vol. i. p. 259, note. \"Without going so far as to agree  with Governor Pownall that the Freemasons invented Gothic, it may be  reasonably contended that without them it could not have been brought to  perfection, and without Gothic they would not have stood in the peculiar  and prominent position that they did, that there was mutual indebtedness,  and while without Freemasons there would have been no Gothic...without  Gothic the Freemasons would have formed but a very ordinary community of  trades unionists.\"    To select an example of Gothic illumination which shall exemplify the  earliest features of the pointed style is not an easy matter,  notwithstanding the number of thirteenth-century MSS. which still exist  in public collections. In the National Library at Paris are several such  MSS. One that decidedly marks the change from the German work hitherto  in vogue is the Psalter of St. Louis (Nat. Lib., Paris., Lat. 10525),  which contains nearly eighty small, delicately executed miniatures. It  was completed about 1250. Its noticeable features are a vastly improved  dexterity in draughtsmanship, which displays a refined certainty of  touch, enabling the artist to express his intention with unhesitating  freedom. The drawing thus produced in outline is filled in with flat  tints of body-colour, without gradation or any attempt at brush-work  shading. Whatever finishing in this respect might be thought necessary  was added with the pen. Nothing could show more clearly that it is  simply and frankly imitative of stained glass. As in the glass the black  outline is left for definition. No colour is used on hands of faces  except a slight touch of red on the cheeks and lips. The prevailing  colours are rich blue and bright scarlet. Perhaps the illuminator would  have been better advised had he neglected some of the harder features of  this kind of work. Not considering that the limits of the glass painter  did not apply to his vellum, he fettered himself unnecessarily, and  instead of a picture he has only succeeded in producing a surface  enamel, or a mere reticulation of surface-patterns. This very defect has  by some writers been held up to admiration as the true perfection of all  illumination. Its flatness was applauded because it had to be shut up in  a book, and was therefore the only appropriate way of making a picture  for such a purpose. But whoever would dream that because a picture,  painted in due perspective and proper light and shade, was to be shut up  in a book that the figures represented in relief would actually be  crushed. Such reasoning is most puerile. The supposed parallel case of a  carpet or hearth-rug representing groups of flowers--even if the latter  ever did deceive the domestic cat--does not in the least affect the most  childish conception of a picture in a book. We see it in a scene in  light and shade, we enjoy and admire its reliefs, but at the same time  we know it is a picture, and that it is quite flat. The two tests of  knowledge never interfere with each other. To suppose they do is to  suppose a case of imbecility that even a lunatic must laugh to scorn. So  far, therefore, we think the illuminator mistaken in slavishly copying  the limitations of the glass-painter. It is no very great knowledge of  nature that is shown in these drawings. There is a good example of the  method of study followed by thirteenth-century artists in the  sketch-book of a French mason named Villars de Honnecourt, still kept in  the National Library at Paris.[36] In this book the artist has made  drawings, as he says, from the life--some are views, others drawings of  objects of art; one represents a lion of the mediæval heraldic type, yet  the artist assures us it is from the life. But there is no real  accuracy, everything is done with reference to some canon. It is,  however, quite free from the Byzantine influence, though by no means  free from a certain tincture of symbolism. The nude is rarely attempted,  but when it is it is certainly less ugly than in Carolingian and  Romanesque. To return to the Psalter--the style of the figures is rather  graceful, attitudes are gentle and modest, though the inclination of  head and body are such as to suggest a sort of undulatory movement in  walking that is scarcely natural. The forms are slender, and the limbs  occasionally beyond the owner's control--sometimes even deformed. The  feet are small and weak--now and then over-twisted. The hands more  delicate than formerly, especially when open. Faces are gently oval and  sometimes expressive.    [36] It has been published as the "]]]
