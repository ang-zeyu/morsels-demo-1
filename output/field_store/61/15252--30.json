There was a sudden silence in the cabin--the demand had stopped. The  agents below must now have realized that the ship with the distress  signals blazing on her nose was not going to reply. Dane found he could  not watch the visa plate now, Rip's hands about their task filled his  whole range of sight.    He knew that Shannon was using every bit of his skill and knowledge to  jockey them into the position where they could ride their tail rockets  down to the scorched rock of the E-Stat field. Perhaps it wasn't as  smooth a landing as Jellico could have made. But they did it. Rip's hands  were quiet, again that patch of darkness showed on the back of his tunic.  He made no move from his seat.    \"Secure--\" Ali's voice floated up to them.    Dane unbuckled his safety webbing and got up, looking to Shannon for  orders. This was Rip's plan they were to carry through. Then something  moved him to give honor where it was due. He touched that bowed shoulder  before him.    \"Fin landing, brother! Four points and down!\"    Rip glanced up, a grin made him look his old self. \"Ought to have a  recording of that for the Board when I go up for my pass-through.\"    Dane matched his smile. \"Too bad we didn't have someone out there with a  tri-dee machine.\"    \"More likely it'd be evidence at our trial for piracy--\" their words must  have reached Ali on the ship's inter-com, for his deflating reply came  back, to remind them of why they had made that particular landing. \"Do we  move now?\"    \"Check first,\" Rip said into the mike.    Dane looked at the visa-plate. Against a background of jagged rock teeth  was the bubble of the E-Stat housing--more than three-quarters of it  being in the hollowed out sections below the surface of the miniature  world which supported it, as Dane knew. But a beam of light shown from  the dome to center on the grounded Queen. They had not caught the Stat  agents napping.    They made the rounds of the spacer, checking on each of the  semi-conscious men. Ali had ready the artificial oxgy tanks--they must  move fast once they began the actual task of clearing and restocking the  hydro.    \"Hope you have a good story ready,\" he commented as the other three  joined him by the hatch to don the suits which would enable them to cross  the airless, heatless surface of the asteroid.    \"We have a poisoned hydro,\" Dane said.    \"One look at the plants we dump will give you the lie. They won't accept  our story without investigation.\"    Dane was aroused. Did Ali think he was a stupid as all that? \"If you'd  take a look in there now you'd believe me,\" he snapped.    \"What did you do?\" Ali sounded genuinely interested.    \"Chucked a heated can of lacoil over a good section. It's wilting down  fast in big patches.\"    Rip snorted. \"Good old lacoil. You drink it, you wash in it, and now you  kill off the Hydro with it. Maybe we can give the company an extra  testimonial for the official jabber and collect when we hit Terra. All  right--Weeks,\" he spoke to the little man, \"you listen in on the  com--it's tuned to our helmet units. We'll climb into these pipe suits  and see how many tears we can wring out of the Eysies with our sad, sad  tale.\"    They got into the awkward, bulky suits and squeezed into the hatch while  Weeks slammed the lock door at their backs and operated the outer  opening. Then they were looking out across the ground, still showing  signs of the heat of their landing, and lighted by the dome beam.    \"Nobody hurrying out with an aid and comfort kit,\" Rip's voice sounded in  Dane's earphones. \"A little slack aren't they?\"    Slack--or was it that the Eysies had recognized the Queen and was  preparing the sort of welcome the remnant of her crew could not  withstand? Dane, wanting very much in his heart to be elsewhere, climbed  down the ladder in Rip's wake, both of them spotlighted by the immovable  beam from the Stat dome.          Chapter XI    DESPERATE MEASURES      Measured in distance and time that rough walk in the ponderous suits  across the broken terrain of the asteroid was a short one, measured by  the beating of his own heart, Dane thought it much too long. There was no  sign of life by the air lock of the bubble--no move on the part of the  men stationed there to come to their assistance.    \"D'you suppose we're invisible?\" Ali's disembodied voice clicked in the  helmet earphones.    \"Maybe we'll wish we were,\" Dane could not forego that return.    Rip was almost to the air lock door now. His massively suited arm was  outstretched toward the control bar when the com-unit in all three  helmets caught the same demand:    \"Identify!\" The crisp order had enough snap to warn them that an answer  was the best policy.    \"Shannon--A-A of the Polestar,\" Rip gave the required information. \"We  claim E rights--\"    But would they get them? Dane wondered. There was a click loud in his  ears. The metal door was yielding to Rip's hand. At least those on the  inside had taken off the lock. Dane quickened pace to join his leader.    Together the three from the Queen crowded through the lock door, saw that  swing shut and seal behind them, as they stood waiting for the moment  they could discard the suits and enter the dome. The odds against them  could not be too high, this was a small Stat. It would not house more  than four agents at the most. And they were familiar enough with the  basic architecture of such stations to know just what move to make. Ali  was to go to the com room where he could take over if they did meet with  trouble. Dane and Rip would have to handle any dissenters in the main  section. But they still hoped that luck might ride their fins and they  could put over a story which would keep them out of active conflict with  the Eysies.    The gauge on the wall registered safety and they unfastened the  protective clasps of the suits. Standing the cumbersome things against  the wall as the inner door to the lock rolled back, they walked into  Eysie territory.    As Free Traders they had the advantage of being uniformly tunicked--with  no Company badge to betray their ship or status. So that could well _be_  the \"Polestar\" standing needle slim behind them--and not the notorious  \"Solar Queen.\" But each, as he passed through the inner lock, gave a  hitch to his belt which brought the butt of his sleep rod closer to hand.  Innocuous as that weapon was, in close quarters its effects, if only  temporary, was to some purpose. And since they were prepared for trouble,  they might have a slight edge over the Eysies in attack.    A Company man, his tunic shabby and open in a negligent fashion at his  thick throat, stood waiting for them. His unhelmeted head was grizzled,  his coarse, tanned face with heavy jowls bristly enough to suggest he had  not bothered to use smooth-cream for some days. An under officer of some  spacer, retired to finish out the few years before pension in this  nominal duty--fast letting down the standards of personal regime he had  had to maintain on ship board. But he wasn't all fat and soft living,  the glance with which he measured them was shrewdly appraising.    \"What's your trouble?\" he demanded without greeting. \"You didn't I-dent  coming in.\"    \"Coms are out,\" Rip replied as shortly. \"We need E-Hydro--\"    \"First time I ever heard it that the coms were wired in with the grass,\"  the Eysies's hands were on his hips--in close proximity to something  which made Dane's eyes narrow. The fellow was wearing a flare-blaster!  That might be regulation equipment for an E-Stat agent on a lonely  asteroid--but he didn't quite believe it. And probably the other was  quick on the draw too.    \"The coms are something else,\" Rip answered readily. \"Our tech is working  on them. But the hydro's bad all though. We'll have to dump and restock.  Give you a voucher on Terra for the stuff.\"    The Eysie agent continued to block the doorway into the station. \"This is  private--I-S property. You should hit the Patrol post--they cater to you  F-Ts.\"    \"We hit the nearest E-Stat when we discovered that we were contaminated,\"  Rip spoke with an assumption of patience. \"That's the law, and you know  it. You have to supply us and take a voucher--\"    \"How do I know that your voucher is worth the film it's recorded on?\"  asked the agent reasonably.    \"All right,\" Rip shrugged. \"If we have to do it the hard way, we'll cargo  dump to cover your bill.\"    \"Not on this field.\" The other shook his head. \"I'll flash in your  voucher first.\"    He had them, Dane thought bitterly. Their luck had run out. Because what  he was going to do was a move they dared not protest. It was one any  canny agent would make in the present situation. And if they were what  they said they were, they must readily agree to let him flash their  voucher of payment to I-S headquarters, to be checked and okayed before  they took the hydro stock.    But Rip merely registered a mild resignation. \"You the Com-tech? Where's  your unit? I'll indit at once if you want it that way.\"    Whether their readiness to co-operate allayed some of the agent's  suspicion or not, he relaxed some, giving them one more stare all around  before he turned on his heel. \"This way.\"    They followed him down the narrow hall, Rip on his heels, the others  behind.    \"Lonely post,\" Rip commented. \"I'd think you boys'd get space-whirly out  here.\"    The other snorted. \"We're not star lovers. And the pay's worth a three  month stretch. They take us down for Terra leave before we start talking  to the Whisperers.\"    \"How many of you here at a time?\" Rip edged the question in casually.    But the other might have been expecting it by the way he avoided giving a  direct answer. \"Enough to run the place--and not enough to help you clean  out your wagon,\" he was short about it. \"Any dumping you do is strictly  on your own.

However, Decumus Pacarius,  the procurator,[246] nearly ruined Corsica by an act of indiscretion,  which in a war of such dimensions could not possibly have affected the  issue, and only ended in his own destruction. He hated Otho and  determined to aid Vitellius with all the forces of Corsica; a useless  assistance, even if it had been forthcoming. He summoned the chief men  of the island and disclosed his project. Claudius Pyrrhicus, who  commanded the Liburnian cruisers[247] stationed there, and a Roman  knight named Quintius Certus ventured to oppose him. He ordered their  execution. This overawed the others who were present. So they swore  allegiance to Vitellius, as did also the general mass of ignorant  people, who blindly shared a fear they did not feel. However, when  Pacarius began to enlist them and to harass his undisciplined men with  military duties, their loathing for the unwonted labour set them  thinking of their weakness. 'They lived in an island: Vitellius'  legions were in Germany, a long way off: Otho's fleet had already  sacked and plundered districts that had even horse and foot to protect  them.' The revulsion was sudden, but did not issue in overt  resistance. They chose a suitable moment for their treachery. Waiting  till Pacarius' visitors[248] were gone, they murdered him, stripped  and helpless, in his bath, and killed his comrades too. The heads they  bore themselves to Otho, like enemies' scalps. Neither did Otho reward  nor Vitellius punish them. In the general confusion their deed was  overshadowed by more heinous crimes.    We have already described[249] how 'Silius' Horse' had admitted the     17  war into the heart of Italy. No one there either supported Otho or  preferred Vitellius. But prolonged peace had broken their spirits to  utter servility. They were an easy prey to the first comer and cared  little who was the better man. All the fields and cities between the  Alps and the Po, the most fertile district in Italy, were held by the  Vitellian forces, the cohorts sent forward by Caecina[249] having  already arrived. One of the Pannonian cohorts had been captured at  Cremona: a hundred cavalry and a thousand marines had been cut off  between Placentia and Ticinum.[250] After this success the river and  its steep banks were no barrier to the Vitellian troops: indeed the  Batavians and other Germans found the Po a positive temptation.  Crossing suddenly opposite Placentia, they captured a handful of  scouts and created such a panic that the others in terror spread the  false report that Caecina's whole army was upon them.    Spurinna, who was holding Placentia, had made up his mind that          18  Caecina had not yet arrived, and that, if he should, his troops must  be kept within their lines: he could not pit three cohorts of guards  with one detachment a thousand strong,[251] and a few cavalry, against  Caecina's veteran army. But his men were unruly and ignorant of  war.[252] Seizing the standards and colours[253] they broke out,  threatening to kill the general who tried to check them and paying no  heed to their superior officers. They even clamoured that Otho was  being betrayed, and Caecina had been summoned.[254] Spurinna yielded  unwillingly to their folly, at first under compulsion, later with a  show of sympathy. He was anxious to gain weight for his advice,  should the mutiny cool.    At nightfall, with the Po in sight, Spurinna decided to entrench        19  his camp.[255] The unaccustomed hard work soon blunted the enthusiasm  of his town-bred troops. The older men began to curse their credulity,  and to point out the fearful danger to their small force of being  surrounded by Caecina's army in the open country. Soon a more sober  spirit pervaded the camp. The tribunes and centurions mingled with the  men, and every one talked with admiration of Spurinna's foresight in  selecting a powerful and wealthy colony as a strong base for their  operations. Finally Spurinna himself rather explained his plans than  reproached their faults, and, leaving patrols behind, succeeded  eventually in leading the rest of the men back to Placentia in a  quieter and more submissive frame of mind. There the walls were  repaired, outworks built, and the turrets increased in height and  number, while Spurinna provided not only for arms and ammunition but  also for obedience and discipline. This was all his party lacked, for  their courage was unimpeachable.    Caecina, on the other hand, seemed to have left his cruelty and         20  profligacy on the other side of the Alps. He marched through Italy  with a well-disciplined force. The people in the country-towns and  colonies took offence at his costume as showing arrogance. While they  wore the plain toga, Caecina addressed them attired in a  parti-coloured plaid and trousers.[256] Moreover, his wife Salonina  rode on a fine horse with purple trappings, and though this did no one  any harm, they grumbled and seemed hurt. It is an ineradicable human  trait to turn critical eyes on new-found fortune, and to insist upon  moderation most of all in those who used to be our equals. Crossing  the Po, Caecina tried to undermine the loyalty of the Othonians by  negotiations and promises. They retaliated with the same weapons, and  when they had finished bandying empty and fine-sounding phrases about  Peace and Union, Caecina devoted all his attention and plans to an  assault on Placentia in terrific force. He knew that his future  reputation rested on the issue of his first engagements.[257]    But the first day's work savoured more of impatience than of a          21  veteran army's methods. The men ventured under the walls without cover  or precaution, drunk and overfed. Meanwhile the amphitheatre, a fine  building outside the walls, was burnt down. It was set on fire either  by the attacking force hurling torches and heated shot and  fire-brands, or by the besieged in returning their fire. The common  people of the town harboured a suspicion that fuel for the fire had  been surreptitiously introduced from one of the neighbouring colonies,  and that the motive was jealousy, since no building in Italy could  hold so many people. However it happened, they thought little of it,  while worse disasters threatened: safety assured, they bewailed it as  the worst calamity they could have suffered. To return, however, to  Caecina: he was repulsed with heavy losses, and the night was spent in  preparations. The Vitellians provided mantlets, fascines, and  penthouses,[258] to protect the assailants while undermining the  walls: the Othonians procured stakes and huge masses of stone or lead  or brass, to break through the enemy's formation and crush them to  pieces. Both parties were actuated by feelings of pride and ambition.  Various encouragements were used, one side praising the strength of  the legions and the German army, the other the reputation of the  Guards and the City Garrison. The Vitellians decried their enemy as  lazy effeminates demoralized by the circus and the theatre: to which  they replied that the Vitellians were a pack of foreigners and  barbarians. Meanwhile, Otho and Vitellius were held up to praise or  blame, insult providing the more fruitful stimulus.    Hardly had day dawned before the walls of Placentia bristled with       22  defenders, and the fields glittered with the soldiers' armour. The  Vitellian legions[259] advancing in close order with their auxiliaries  in scattered bands assailed the higher portions of the walls with  stones and arrows: where the walls were in disrepair or crumbling from  age they came close up to them. The Othonians above, poising and  aiming their weapons with surer effect, rained them down on the  Germans, who came rashly charging under the walls with the wild songs  and scanty dress of their country, brandishing their shields over  their heads. Meanwhile, the legionaries under cover of their mantlets  and fascines set to work to undermine the walls, build up a mound, and  assail the gates, while Otho's Guards rolled on to them with terrific  crashes huge millstones, which they had arranged for this purpose  along the walls. Of those beneath, some were crushed by the stones;  others, wounded by darts, were left mangled and bleeding to death.  Panic redoubled the slaughter, and the rain of missiles came all the  fiercer from the walls. At last they sacrificed the honour of their  party and beat a retreat. Caecina, ashamed of his rash attempt at  assault, was afraid of looking ridiculous and useless if he sat still  in the same camp. So he crossed the Po and made for Cremona. As he  was retiring, Turullius Cerialis with a large force of marines, and  Julius Briganticus[260] with a few cavalry, came over to his side. The  latter, a Batavian born, had held a cavalry command: the former was a  senior centurion, who was known to Caecina, as he had served in that  capacity in Germany.    Spurinna, learning the enemy's route, informed Annius Gallus[261]       23  by letter of all that had happened, the defence of Placentia and  Caecina's plans. Gallus was leading the First legion to the relief of  Placentia, for he doubted the ability of the weak force of Guards to  resist a long siege and the full strength of the German army. Hearing  that Caecina was defeated and making for Cremona, he halted at  Bedriacum, though he found it hard to restrain the ardour of his  troops, whose zeal for battle nearly broke into mutiny. The village of  Bedriacum lies between Verona and Cremona,[262] and two Roman  disasters have now given it a sinister notoriety.    In the same week Martius Macer[263] gained a victory in the  neighbourhood of Cremona. With great enterprise he had transported his  gladiators across the Po, and suddenly flung them on to the opposite  bank. There they routed the Vitellian auxiliaries and killed all who  offered resistance,"]]]
