[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21654"],[0,"In and Around Berlin (#20)"],[1,"Prince William and his  family passed, in the most striking equipage of all, except that of  the Prince of Wales. It was a State carriage of the time of Frederick  the Great, its decorations of gold on a dark body; a large, low  vehicle whose glass windows revealed the occupants on every side. Six  Pomeranian brown steeds of high mettle were guided by the skilful  driver, horses and outriders being splendidly caparisoned in light  blue and silver. Rudolph, Crown Prince of Austria, solitary in his  carriage, received his share of attention, as did the Russian Grand  Dukes and Grand Duchess, the fine-looking King and Queen of Saxony,  the Prince-Regent of Bavaria with his two sons of ten and twelve, and  the Duchess of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, venerable sister of the Emperor.  The Queen of Roumania bowed to the throng with utmost grace, smiling  and showing her brilliant teeth; but whether the special huzzas were a  tribute to the beauty of the Queen, or to the poetry of Carmen Sylva,  we could not determine. All things have an end; and so did this  dazzling State pageant, at which all Europe assisted and where all  Europe was looking on; but not until Bismarck's carriage had conveyed  the Chancellor to his chief, followed by General Von Moltke, who had  the good taste to drive up simply, with two horses and an open  carriage that interposed not even plate-glass between the great  soldier and the loyal multitude. A few moments after their entrance,  the Emperor appeared at the palace window, Bismarck on his right and  Von Moltke on his left, and the hurrahs of the crowd burst forth anew.    Later in the day the Crown Prince and Crown Princess entertained the  royal guests at dinner; and Prince Bismarck, as usual on the Emperor's  birthday, gave a dinner to the Diplomatic Corps. A drizzling rain set  in suddenly in the afternoon, sending dismay to the hearts of all; for  the most brilliant part of the celebration was still in reserve for  the evening. The rain fell in occasional light showers up to a late  hour, but it dampened only the outer garb, not the hearts, of the  undiminished multitude, which at night-fall, on foot or in carriages,  thronged the streets of the brilliant capital, whose myriad lights  showed to better advantage under the reflecting clouds than they would  have done under starlight. The carriages numbered scores of thousands,  and the people on foot hundreds of thousands; but so complete were the  arrangements of the police and so obedient the concourse, that all  proceeded in nearly perfect order. Our coachman fortunately drove  through Old Berlin and Koeln, as a preliminary to the evening's  sight-seeing. Long arcades filled with Jews' shops were worthy the pen  of Dickens. This festal day made this most ancient portion of the city  also one of the most picturesque. Houses with quaint dormer windows  roofed by \"eyelids,\" of an architecture dating back two or three  hundred years, gleamed with candles in every window. Almost no house  or shop was so poor as to dispense with its share of the universal  illumination. At least three horizontal lines of lighted candles  threaded both sides of every street of this city of a million and a  half inhabitants. Many private as well as public buildings in the old  part showed by colored lights the picturesque, quaint streets and  nooks, as no light of day can ever do. We were passing the Rath-haus,  or City Hall,--a modern and imposing edifice,--at the time when its  great tower was being lighted up. Three hundred feet above the  pavement floated the flags grouped in the centre and at the corners of  the square tower. Invisible red fires illuminated them, the shafts of  crimson light rising to the clouds above, the outlines of the  remainder of the building dimly reposing in darkness. An immense  electric light, guided by a reflector in another tower, shot a bridge  of white light high in air across the river, and fell, like a  circumscribed space of noonday amid black darkness, on the fine  equestrian statue of the Great Elector by the bridge behind the Old  Castle, with an effect almost indescribable. As we entered Unter den  Linden by the Lustgarten, the beautiful square and its historic  edifices, which form an ideal sight even by daylight, glowed and  gleamed with jets of light from every point. The Old Schloss showed  continuous lines of illumination in the windows of its four stories,  along its front of six hundred and fifty feet, while the majestic dome  caught and reflected rays of light from every point of the horizon. On  the opposite side of the Lustgarten, the Doric portico of the National  Gallery glowed with rose-colored light from massive Grecian lamps,  while the arched entrance beneath its superb staircase gleamed with a  pale sea-green radiance like the entrance to some ocean cave. The  incomparable architecture of the Old Museum was set in strong relief  by white light, which flooded its immense Ionic colonnade and brought  out the high colors of the colossal frescos along the three hundred  feet of its magnificent portico. The front of the palace of the Crown  Prince was thrown, by innumerable jets, into a blaze of crimson. The  Roman Catholic Church of St. Hedwig, with its dome in imitation of the  Pantheon, its Latin cross and window arches beaming in pale yellow,  made a fine background for the only unilluminated building, the palace  of the Emperor. From the Opera House, the Arsenal, and the University,  crowns and elaborate designs were burning, yet unconsumed. Most  elaborately decorated of all Berlin buildings was the Academy of Arts  and Sciences, opposite the Imperial Palace, with colossal warriors in  bronze keeping guard at its portals, and the Angel of Peace laying a  laurel wreath on the altar of Fatherland as its decorative  centre-piece. No high meaning of all its symbols was more touching  and significant than the appropriate texts of Scripture written for  the Kaiser's eye, underneath its elaborate frescos. But of what avail  would be an attempt to describe two miles of most beautiful  decorations along Unter den Linden, each one a study in itself, and  having nothing in common with the others, except the eagles and the  Emperor's monogram; and the innumerable points of light, massed in a  world of various forms, and in all the colors of the rainbow! This  glow of splendor surrounded by the dense darkness covered the city,  and the dazzling coronals of its lofty towers and domes and spires  must have been visible to a great distance across the plains of  Brandenburg.    Slowly the triple line of carriages and the surging throng pressed  onward, past the palaces and diplomatic residences of the Pariser  Platz; some diverging down the Wilhelm Strasse, where streaming flags  and blazing illuminations made noonday brightness and gayety about the  palace of the Chancellor, but most passing through the Brandenburg  Gate. The massive Doric columns of this impressive structure were in  darkness, but the Chariot of Victory with its fine bronze horses,  surmounting the gate, was weird with the scarlet light of Bengal  fires burning on the entablature.    As the artist rests his eyes by the spot of neutral gray which he  keeps for the purpose on wall or palette, so brain and eye were  prepared for sleep at the close of this long day, by sitting in our  carriages, safe sheltered from the soft-falling rain, outside the  great gate which divided the splendor from the darkness, for three  quarters of an hour, in an inextricable tangle of carriages, until the  perturbed coachmen and the sorely vexed police could evolve order from  the temporary confusion, and set the hindered procession again on its  homeward way.    Meantime the day was not over for the much-enduring Emperor and his  royal guests. In the famous White Saloon of the Old Schloss an  entertainment was going forward. Blinding coronets and necklaces on  royal ladies made the interior of this ancient palace more brilliant  than its shining exterior on this birth-night. The Empress Augusta,  leaning on the arm of her grandson, Prince William, was attired in a  lace-trimmed robe of pale green, her diamonds a mass of sparkling  light; the Crown Princess was in silver-gray, the wife of the English  Ambassador in pale mauve, the Princess Christian in turquoise blue;  and the Grand Duchess Vladimir of Russia wore a magnificent robe of  pink satin trimmed with sable, with a tiara of diamonds and a  stomacher of diamonds and emeralds. From the neck and forehead of the  Queen of Roumania flashed a thousand prismatic hues; and the Green  Vault of Dresden sent some of its most precious treasures to keep  company with the fair Queen of Saxony in adding brilliance to the  scene.    Our reverie led from this starry point in history back to the time  when, as on this memorable day, the royal salute of Berlin artillery  shook the city, to announce the birth of a prince ninety years ago. A  rapid, almost a chance recall of the years shows us Washington then  living on his estate at Mount Vernon, Lafayette a young man of forty,  Clay a stripling of twenty, Webster a boy of fifteen. The Directory in  France had not yet made way for the First Republic; the younger Pitt  and Canning held England; Metternich and O'Connell were in their  youth, and Robert Peel was a child of nine. Napoleon Bonaparte was in  the flush of youthful success, soon to become the idol of France and  the terror of Europe, before whom the boy, now Kaiser Wilhelm, and  his royal family fled to Koenigsberg by the Baltic, while the conqueror  held Berlin and reduced Prussia to a second-rate province. To this boy  the flames of burning Moscow were a transient aurora-borealis under  the pole-star; and Nelson and Wellington were unknown to the stories  of his childhood, for as yet their fame was not. Goethe and Schiller  were in the prime of early manhood; Kant and Klopstock elderly, but  with years yet to live;"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21656"],[0,"The Princess of the School (#20)"],[1," with red ink, they inscribed their autographs on a piece of  paper, rolled it up, placed it in a bottle, then solemnly dug a hole,  and buried the said bottle under a tree.    \"It will be here for a testimony against any girl who breaks her oath!\"  declared Phillida. \"Carmel says the real Mafia sign their names in  blood, but I think that's horrid, and red ink will do quite as well.  Just as I was coming out now, Laurette said to me; 'Oh, don't go running  away, because I want one of you younger ones to do something for me  presently.' She said it with the air of a duchess!\"    \"Cheek!\" agreed the others. \"It's high time we made up a society against  her!\"    Many and various were the offences that were laid to Laurette's score.  Lilias had a private grievance, because she fancied that Laurette had  never been so civil to herself and Dulcie since it was known that their  brother was not to inherit the Chase. Gowan, who liked plain speaking,  accused Laurette of telling \"fiblets\"; Bertha had had a squabble over  the bathroom, and Prissie a wrestle for the piano.    \"Laurette always reminds me of that rhyme that the undergrads made up  about the Master of Balliol,\" said Edith.        \"'Here come I, my name is Jowett,       All there is to know, I know it;       I'm the head of this here College,       What I don't know isn't knowledge!'    That's Laurette's attitude exactly. She's so superior to everybody!\"    \"We'll take her down, don't worry yourself!\" smiled Dulcie. \"We must  just wait for a good opportunity, and then----\"    \"The secret hand will smite!\" laughed Carmel, who enjoyed the fun as  much as anybody.    Laurette's aggravatingly superior pose was especially apparent in her  attitude towards the mistresses. She monopolized Miss Herbert, treated  her almost like a friend, wrote notes to her, left flowers in her  bedroom, and walked arm-in-arm with her in the garden. Perhaps the  mistress was lonely, possibly she was flattered by receiving so much  attention, at any rate she allowed Laurette to be on terms of great  intimacy, and gave her a far larger share of her confidence than was at  all wise. Laurette, after a hot affection lasting three weeks, got tired  of Miss Herbert, and suddenly cooled off. Gowan and Carmel, going into  the sitting-room one day, found her discussing her former idol with a  group of her chums.    \"Do you call her pretty? Well, now, I _don't_!\" she was saying  emphatically. \"She may have been pretty once, but now she's getting  decidedly _passee_. I can't say I admire faded sentimental people!\"    \"Sentimental?\" said Truie. \"I shouldn't call her sentimental at all.  She's only too horribly practical, in my opinion!\"    \"You don't know her as I do! My dear! The things she's told me! The love  affairs she's been through! I had the whole history of them. And she  used to blush, and look most romantic. It was all I could do not to  burst out laughing. You'd scream if I were to tell you! First there was  a clergyman----\"    \"Here, stop!\" interrupted Gowan, breaking abruptly into the  conversation, and turning two blazing blue eyes on Laurette. \"Anything  Miss Herbert may have told you was certainly in confidence, and to go  and blab it over the school seems to me the meanest, sneakiest trick  I've ever heard of! You're an absolute blighter, Laurette!\"    \"Well, I'm sure! What business is it of yours, Gowan Barbour, or of  Carmel Ingleton's either? Cheek!\"    \"It _is_ our business!\" flared Carmel, as indignant as Gowan. \"It's  horribly mean to make friends with any one, and hear all her secrets,  and then go and make fun of them!\"    \"It's playing it low!\" added Gowan, determined to speak her mind for  once. \"And I hope somebody will make fun of _you_ some day just to  serve you right! Some day _you'll_ be _faded_ and _passee_, and people  will giggle and say you haven't 'got off' in spite of all your efforts,  and they wonder how old you really are, and they remember when you came  out, and you can't be a chicken, and they don't like to see 'mutton  dressed like lamb,' and all the rest of the kind pleasant things that  people of your type find to say. _I_ know! Well, I shan't be in the  least sorry for you! It will be a judgment!\"    Laurette had made a desperate attempt to interrupt Gowan's flow of  words, but she might as well have tried to stop the brook. When Gowan  began, she never even paused for breath. Her wrath was like a whirlwind.  Laurette's three chums had turned away as if rather ashamed, and began  hastily to get out books and writing-materials. They pretended not to  notice when Laurette looked at them for support.    \"Yes, you needn't think Truie and Hester and Muriel will back you up!\"  continued Gowan. \"Unless they're as mean as you are. There! I've  finished now, so you needn't butt in! You know exactly what I think of  you. Come along, Carmel!\"    The two immediate results of this episode were a bitter feud between  Laurette and Gowan, and a sympathetic interest in Miss Herbert by all  the members of the Mafia. They felt that her confidence had been  betrayed, and they would have liked somehow to make it up to her. They  brought so many floral offerings to her bedroom that her vases were  almost inconveniently crowded.    Carmel, hearing that she was collecting post cards, sent home for some  special ones of Sicily; Dulcie tendered chocolates; Lilias crocheted her  a pincushion cover, and Bertha painted her a hair-tidy. She accepted  their little kindnesses with mild astonishment, but not a hint of the  real reason of their sudden advances flashed across her mind.    \"We mustn't let her suspect!\" said Dulcie.    \"Rather not!\" agreed Carmel.    \"Not for worlds!\" said Gowan emphatically.          CHAPTER XII    White Magic      October passed by with flaming crimson and gold on the trees, and orange  and mauve toadstools among the moss of the woods, and squirrels  scampering up the Scotch pines at the top of the garden, laying by their  winter store of nuts; and flocks of migrating birds twittering in the  fields, and hosts of glittering red hips and haws in the hedges, and  shrouds of fairy gossamer over the blackberry bushes. It was Carmel's  first autumn in England, and, though her artistic temperament revelled  in the beauty of the tints, the falling leaves filled her with  consternation.    \"It is so sad to see them all come down,\" she declared. \"Why the trees  will soon be quite bare! Nothing but branches left!\"    \"What else do you expect?\" asked Gowan. \"They won't keep green all the  winter.\"    \"I suppose not. But in Sicily we have so many evergreens and shrubs that  flower all the winter. The oranges and lemons begin to get ripe soon  after Christmas, and we have agaves and prickly pears everywhere. I  can't imagine a landscape without any leaves!\"    \"Wait till you see the snow! It's prime then!\"    \"There's generally snow on Etna, but I haven't been up so high. It  doesn't fall where we live.\"    \"Girl alive! Have you never made a snowball?\"    \"Never.\"    \"Then it's a treat in store for you. I sincerely hope we shall have a  hard winter.\"    \"We ought to, by the number of berries in the hedges,\" put in Bertha.  \"It's an old saying that they foretell frost.        \"'Bushes red with hip and haw,       Weeks of frost without a thaw.'    I don't know whether it always comes true, though.\"    \"I'm a believer in superstitions,\" declared Gowan. \"Scotch people  generally are, I think. My great-grandmother used to have second sight.  By the by; it's Hallowe'en on Friday! I vote we rummage up all the old  charms we can, and try them. It would be ever such fun.\"    \"Topping! Only let us keep it to the Mafia, and not let the others  know.\"    \"_Ra_ther! We don't want Laurette and Co. butting in.\"    The remaining members of the Mafia, when consulted, received the idea  with enthusiasm. There is a vein of superstition at the bottom of the  most practical among us, and all of them were well accustomed to  practise such rites as throwing spilt salt over the left shoulder,  curtseying to the new moon, and turning their money when they heard the  cuckoo.    \"Not, of course, that it always follows,\" said Prissie. \"On Easter  holidays a bird used to come and tap constantly at our drawing-room  window at home. It was always doing it. Of course that means 'a death in  the family,' but we all kept absolutely hearty and well. Not even a  third cousin once removed has died, and it's more than two years ago.  Mother says it was probably catching insects on the glass. She laughs at  omens!\"    \"I always double my thumb inside my fist if I walk under a ladder,\"  volunteered Noreen.    \"Well, it _is_ unlucky to go under a ladder,\" declared Phillida. \"You  may get a pot of paint dropped on your head! I saw that happen once to a  poor lady: it simply turned upside down on her, and deluged her hat and  face and everything with dark green paint. She had to go into a shop to  be wiped. It must have been awful for her, and for her clothes as well.  I've never forgotten it.\"    \"What could we do on Hallowe'en?\" asked Edith.    \"Well, we must try to think it out, and make some plans.\"    From the recesses of their memories the girls raked up every  superstition of which they had ever heard. These had to be divided into  the possible and the impossible. There are limits of liberty in a girls'  school, and it was manifestly infeasible, as well as very chilly, to  attempt to stray out alone at the stroke of twelve, robed merely in a  nightgown, and fetch three pails of water to place by one's bedside.  Gowan's north country recipe for divination was equally  impracticable--to go out at midnight, and \"dip your smock in a  south-running spring where the lairds' lands meet,\" then hang it to dry  before the fire. They discussed it quite seriously, however, in all its  various aspects.    \"To begin with, what exactly is a smock?\" asked Carmel.    Everybody had a hazy notion, but nobody"]]]
