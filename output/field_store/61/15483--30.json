Do your best to  evade the blows or arrows. If one goes aside, rush on him,\" said Big  Turtle.    At length a boy found Gray Squirrel. \"This moving one is a gray  squirrel,\" he said. They went in a great uproar. They shot at him.  They even hit him with sticks. One boy stood aside. Gray Squirrel  attacked him and bit him. They said, \"Wonderful! Heretofore the gray  squirrel has been very easy to approach, but we have failed. He has  bitten us; we have done nothing to him,\" they said.    \"He whom you used to call 'Gray Squirrel' is coming back, having  killed one right among them,\" he called. He told it to Big Turtle.    \"Ho! real warrior, act very honestly,\" said Big Turtle.    \"O war chief, it is just so. I have killed one,\" said he.    \"Ho! warrior, you make me thankful,\" said Big Turtle.    \"Ho! warriors,\" said Big Turtle again. \"I, even I, will make a trial.  I shall not come back for some time. Beware lest you go homeward.  Beware lest you leave me and go homeward.\"    He arrived there. Some ashes had been poured out. They were  extinguished. At length Big Turtle pushed his way through. He went  within. He sat within, with his eyes sticking out, looking around. A  woman approached when it was morning. She stood very close to where  Big Turtle sat.    \"You will tread on my shield,\" he said. The woman looked around. \"From  what place does he speak?\" she thought; therefore she looked around.  Again he said to her, \"You will tread on my shield. Stand further  away.\" And the woman found him.    \"Oh!\" she said.    \"Stand still. I send you with a message,\" said Big Turtle. \"Go home  and say, 'Big Turtle says he has come to war. He says he has come  desiring the chief's daughter, whose body has been placed on the bough  of a tree.'\"    The people came. All the people said, \"Break in his skull suddenly.\"  He said, \"How is it possible for you to break in my skull suddenly? If  you let your weapons slip off suddenly from me each time, you will  break your legs with the blows.\"    They said, \"When the water is hot, it will be good to put him in it.\"    \"Fie!\" said Big Turtle. \"When the water is hot and I scatter it with  kicking, many of you will be scalded to death.\"    \"He tells what is probably true,\" they said.    \"And if it be so, it is good to burn him,\" said the people.    \"For shame! If I scatter the fire by kicking, I will cause all the  land to blaze. Beware lest many of your children, too, die from the  fire,\" he said.    \"He tells what is probably true,\" they said.    A child begged for water. \"O mother, some water,\" it said. Big Turtle  said, \"_Oh!_\" He tempted them with reference to water.    \"Cause the child to ask for water,\" said one.    \"What do you mean by that?\" said others.    \"When the child said, 'O mother, some water,' this one, Big Turtle,  said '_Oh!_'\" answered one.    \"Wonderful!\" they said. \"He is fearing the sight of water.\" They took  him to the water, holding him by the tail. Notwithstanding Big Turtle  clung to the ground with his forelegs, they held his tail, and reached  the water with him. They threw him forcibly right into the water. He  walked the water for a while, crying a little, and pretended he did  not know how to swim. He said, \"_Wi! wi! wi!_\"    \"Wonderful! Throw him out into the middle of the stream,\" they said.  Again they sent him headlong. He was wandering around. At length he  sank. They said, \"He is dead,\" and went homeward. \"You should have  done that to him at first,\" said the people.    When the people went homeward, some boys stood there. Big Turtle  approached, floating. He came peeping. Some boys stood looking at the  place where the deed was done.    Big Turtle said, \"When Big Turtle came in the past to war on you, you  said that you killed him. Look here at me.\"    The boys went homeward to tell it. \"You said that you killed Big  Turtle, but as this one behind us showed his body, he laughed at us.  Big Turtle is he who is alive.\"    \"Ho! We attack him,\" said the people. They attacked him. They arrived  there.    \"In what place?\" said they.    \"In this place,\" said the boys.    \"Where is Otter? Where is Grass Snake? Let those two seek him,\" said  they.    Big Turtle sat under the mud at the bottom of the water. Only the tip  of his nose and his eyes were sticking out. Snake and Otter sought him  beneath the water. They passed very near to him, and stepped regularly  over his head. When Otter was about to pass the second time, Big  Turtle bit him in the stomach.    \"Ho! elder brother, you give me pain,\" said Otter. Big Turtle said,  \"Why do you seek me?\"    \"I did not seek you. As I desired food, we have met each other,\" said  Otter.    \"No, you wished to join those who desire to kill me, so you sought  me,\" said Big Turtle.    \"O elder brother! O elder brother! O elder brother! I pray to you. I  have not sought you,\" he said.    \"I will by no means let you go from my mouth,\" said Big Turtle.    \"Ho! elder brother! How long before you will open your mouth and let  me go?\" said Otter.    \"When the Thunder God has come back, I will let you go.\"    \"Halloo!\" shouted Otter to the people. \"He will let me go when the  Thunder God comes back. Halloo! He bites me between the legs. Halloo!\"  said he.    \"He says that he is bitten,\" said the people. \"He says that he is  bitten between the legs. Hit tent skins for him.\"    They made the tent skins resound by hitting them.    \"Ho! elder brother, the Thunder God has come back,\" said Otter.    \"They hit the tent skins,\" said the Big Turtle.    The people said, \"It is good to fell trees.\" They began felling trees  here and there. The trees said, \"_Qwi! qwi!_\" as they fell.    \"Ho! elder brother, the Thunder God has come back,\" said Otter.    \"They are felling trees,\" said Big Turtle.    At length the Thunder God roared, very far away.    \"Ho! elder brother, he has come back,\" said he. Big Turtle let him go.  Otter was very thin. He went homeward. He reached home very lean.    \"Let the two birds drink the stream dry,\" said the people. \"Bring the  Pelicans here.\"    When they came, the people said, \"Drink the stream dry. A person came  here to war and we killed him, but he is alive. He laughs heartily at  us.\"    The birds drank the stream dry. There was only a very small quantity  left in which Big Turtle sat.    Big Turtle called, \"Ho! warrior Gray Squirrel, be coming hither,  wherever you may be moving. They have almost killed me.\"    Gray Squirrel was coming back, crying loud. He was coming back to  attack them. He attacked the two birds. He tore open their water  pouches by biting. He bit holes in them. At length all the water  returned to its former place. At the creek and the lake it was as  before; they were filled with water.    \"Sew up their pouches for them,\" said the people. So they sewed up the  water pouches of the Pelicans. They finished sewing them.    \"Come, drink it dry again. Do your best. Beware lest we fail,\" said  the people. They drank the stream dry again. Again very little of the  water was left.    \"Ho! warrior Gray Squirrel, wherever you may be moving. They have  nearly killed me. Be coming hither again,\" said Big Turtle. He came  back again. He bit and tore the throats in many places. It made their  throats very bad. He made them bad to be sewed at all. It was  difficult to sew them.    \"Yet we shall fail,\" said the people. \"Gray Squirrel is abominable! I  think Gray Squirrel is the only one with Big Turtle. I think he is the  only one siding with them. Therefore we have failed to hurt them,\"  said the people.    They ceased. When it was night, Big Turtle went back. He reached his  comrades again.    \"Ho! Warriors, when men get the better of their enemies in a fight,  they usually go homeward. I suspect that your sisters are tired of  waiting to dance!\"    They went homeward. He walked around them, rattling his gourd.    \"Warriors, I said that I would do thus, and so it is,\" he said. He  burnt the grass.    He burnt the grass so that they might think he was coming home after  killing the foe. At length they arrived at the village. They tied  scalps to a stick. Then those in the village said, \"Yonder come those  who went to war!\" The returning warriors raced around and around as  victorious warriors do. People said, \"There they are coming home,  having killed the people of the enemy.\"    An old man shouted: \"Corn Crusher says that he killed one. _Halloo!_  He says he killed her right at the lodge. _Halloo!_ Comb says he  killed one right at the lodge. _Halloo!_ Awl says he killed one right  at the lodge. _Halloo!_, Gray Squirrel says that he killed three  right in the midst of the people. _Halloo!_ It is said they held the  war chief, Big Turtle, right among them, in a great uproar. _Halloo!_  It is said they failed to injure him. _Halloo!_\"    Big Turtle walked very proudly, carrying his shield. He went homeward  to enter the lodge. He sat there telling them about himself. As people  wished to hear it, they continued arriving there.    \"Why did they fail, when they were so near you? If you sat very near  them, how is it that you are alive?\" asked the people.    \"I pretended to be afraid of water, so I am alive,\" he said.    \"If so, then those over there have no eyes. How is it that they did  not find you when you were alive?\"    \"I sat in the ashes, therefore I am alive. I have come home, having  killed people. Why did you doubt me? As you did not take vengeance on  the people who used to kill you, I went to war on them myself. I  killed them. How can you doubt me? I will tell no more about myself,\"  said Big Turtle. \"I have ceased.\"      THE END          Transcriber's Note    Minor punctuation errors have been corrected without note.

Even if she couldn't love me it was a great deal to me just  to see her dainty form about the house, and to hear the sound of her  voice.\"    \"Well,\" said I, \"you call that love, Mr. Carruthers, but I should call  it selfishness.\"    \"Maybe the two things go together. Anyhow, I couldn't let her go.  Besides, with this crowd about, it was well that she should have someone  near to look after her. Then when the cable came I knew they were bound  to make a move.\"    \"What cable?\"    Carruthers took a telegram from his pocket.    \"That's it,\" said he.    It was short and concise:--    \"The old man is dead.\"    \"Hum!\" said Holmes. \"I think I see how things worked, and I can  understand how this message would, as you say, bring them to a head. But  while we wait you might tell me what you can.\"    The old reprobate with the surplice burst into a volley of bad language.    \"By Heaven,\" said he, \"if you squeal on us, Bob Carruthers, I'll serve  you as you served Jack Woodley. You can bleat about the girl to your  heart's content, for that's your own affair, but if you round on your  pals to this plain-clothes copper it will be the worst day's work that  ever you did.\"    \"Your reverence need not be excited,\" said Holmes, lighting a cigarette.  \"The case is clear enough against you, and all I ask is a few details  for my private curiosity. However, if there's any difficulty in your  telling me I'll do the talking, and then you will see how far you have  a chance of holding back your secrets. In the first place, three of you  came from South Africa on this game--you Williamson, you Carruthers, and  Woodley.\"    \"Lie number one,\" said the old man; \"I never saw either of them until  two months ago, and I have never been in Africa in my life, so you can  put that in your pipe and smoke it, Mr. Busybody Holmes!\"    \"What he says is true,\" said Carruthers.    \"Well, well, two of you came over. His reverence is our own home-made  article. You had known Ralph Smith in South Africa. You had reason  to believe he would not live long. You found out that his niece would  inherit his fortune. How's that--eh?\"    Carruthers nodded and Williamson swore.    \"She was next-of-kin, no doubt, and you were aware that the old fellow  would make no will.\"    \"Couldn't read or write,\" said Carruthers.    \"So you came over, the two of you, and hunted up the girl. The idea  was that one of you was to marry her and the other have a share of the  plunder. For some reason Woodley was chosen as the husband. Why was  that?\"    \"We played cards for her on the voyage. He won.\"    \"I see. You got the young lady into your service, and there Woodley was  to do the courting. She recognised the drunken brute that he was, and  would have nothing to do with him. Meanwhile, your arrangement was  rather upset by the fact that you had yourself fallen in love with the  lady. You could no longer bear the idea of this ruffian owning her.\"    \"No, by George, I couldn't!\"    \"There was a quarrel between you. He left you in a rage, and began to  make his own plans independently of you.\"    \"It strikes me, Williamson, there isn't very much that we can tell this  gentleman,\" cried Carruthers, with a bitter laugh. \"Yes, we quarreled,  and he knocked me down. I am level with him on that, anyhow. Then I lost  sight of him. That was when he picked up with this cast padre here. I  found that they had set up house-keeping together at this place on the  line that she had to pass for the station. I kept my eye on her after  that, for I knew there was some devilry in the wind. I saw them from  time to time, for I was anxious to know what they were after. Two days  ago Woodley came up to my house with this cable, which showed that Ralph  Smith was dead. He asked me if I would stand by the bargain. I said I  would not. He asked me if I would marry the girl myself and give him a  share. I said I would willingly do so, but that she would not have me.  He said, 'Let us get her married first, and after a week or two she  may see things a bit different.' I said I would have nothing to do with  violence. So he went off cursing, like the foul-mouthed blackguard that  he was, and swearing that he would have her yet. She was leaving me this  week-end, and I had got a trap to take her to the station, but I was  so uneasy in my mind that I followed her on my bicycle. She had got a  start, however, and before I could catch her the mischief was done. The  first thing I knew about it was when I saw you two gentlemen driving  back in her dog-cart.\"    Holmes rose and tossed the end of his cigarette into the grate. \"I have  been very obtuse, Watson,\" said he. \"When in your report you said that  you had seen the cyclist as you thought arrange his necktie in  the shrubbery, that alone should have told me all. However, we may  congratulate ourselves upon a curious and in some respects a unique  case. I perceive three of the county constabulary in the drive, and I am  glad to see that the little ostler is able to keep pace with them; so  it is likely that neither he nor the interesting bridegroom will be  permanently damaged by their morning's adventures. I think, Watson, that  in your medical capacity you might wait upon Miss Smith and tell her  that if she is sufficiently recovered we shall be happy to escort her to  her mother's home. If she is not quite convalescent you will find that  a hint that we were about to telegraph to a young electrician in the  Midlands would probably complete the cure. As to you, Mr. Carruthers, I  think that you have done what you could to make amends for your share in  an evil plot. There is my card, sir, and if my evidence can be of help  to you in your trial it shall be at your disposal.\"      In the whirl of our incessant activity it has often been difficult for  me, as the reader has probably observed, to round off my narratives, and  to give those final details which the curious might expect. Each case  has been the prelude to another, and the crisis once over the actors  have passed for ever out of our busy lives. I find, however, a short  note at the end of my manuscripts dealing with this case, in which I  have put it upon record that Miss Violet Smith did indeed inherit a  large fortune, and that she is now the wife of Cyril Morton, the senior  partner of Morton & Kennedy, the famous Westminster electricians.  Williamson and Woodley were both tried for abduction and assault, the  former getting seven years and the latter ten. Of the fate of Carruthers  I have no record, but I am sure that his assault was not viewed very  gravely by the Court, since Woodley had the reputation of being a most  dangerous ruffian, and I think that a few months were sufficient to  satisfy the demands of justice.      *****                           THE STRAND MAGAZINE                     Vol. 27  FEBRUARY, 1904                  THE RETURN OF SHERLOCK HOLMES.                      By ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE.          V.--The Adventure of the Priory School.      WE have had some dramatic entrances and exits upon our small stage at  Baker Street, but I cannot recollect anything more sudden and startling  than the first appearance of Thorneycroft Huxtable, M.A., Ph.D., etc.  His card, which seemed too small to carry the weight of his academic  distinctions, preceded him by a few seconds, and then he entered  himself--so large, so pompous, and so dignified that he was the very  embodiment of self-possession and solidity. And yet his first action  when the door had closed behind him was to stagger against the table,  whence he slipped down upon the floor, and there was that majestic  figure prostrate and insensible upon our bearskin hearthrug.    We had sprung to our feet, and for a few moments we stared in silent  amazement at this ponderous piece of wreckage, which told of some sudden  and fatal storm far out on the ocean of life. Then Holmes hurried with  a cushion for his head and I with brandy for his lips. The heavy white  face was seamed with lines of trouble, the hanging pouches under the  closed eyes were leaden in colour, the loose mouth drooped dolorously at  the corners, the rolling chins were unshaven. Collar and shirt bore  the grime of a long journey, and the hair bristled unkempt from the  well-shaped head. It was a sorely-stricken man who lay before us.    \"What is it, Watson?\" asked Holmes.    \"Absolute exhaustion--possibly mere hunger and fatigue,\" said I, with my  finger on the thready pulse, where the stream of life trickled thin and  small.    \"Return ticket from Mackleton, in the North of England,\" said Holmes,  drawing it from the watch-pocket. \"It is not twelve o'clock yet. He has  certainly been an early starter.\"    The puckered eyelids had begun to quiver, and now a pair of vacant, grey  eyes looked up at us. An instant later the man had scrambled on to his  feet, his face crimson with shame.    \"Forgive this weakness, Mr. Holmes; I have been a little overwrought.  Thank you, if I might have a glass of milk and a biscuit I have no doubt  that I should be better. I came personally, Mr. Holmes, in order to  ensure that you would return with me. I feared that no telegram would  convince you of the absolute urgency of the case.\"    \"When you are quite restored---\"    \"I am quite well again. I cannot imagine how I came to be so weak. I  wish you, Mr. Holmes, to come to Mackleton with me by the next train.\"    My friend shook his head.    \"My colleague, Dr. Watson, could tell you that we are very busy at  present. I am retained in this case of the Ferrers Documents, and the  Abergavenny murder is coming up for trial. Only a very important"]]]
