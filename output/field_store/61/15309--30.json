He had always been rather partial to  me, and the friendship between us continued after his retirement. I  heard from him regularly at more or less prolonged intervals, and either  at Christmas or Easter invariably received an invitation to spend a few  days with him. On this occasion he was most anxious that I should  accept.    \"Do come to us for Easter,\" he wrote. \"I am sure this place will  interest you--it is haunted.\"    The cunning fellow! He knew I was very keen on Psychical Research work,  and would go almost anywhere on the bare chance of seeing a ghost.    At that time I was quite open-minded, I had arrived at no definite  conclusion as to the existence or non-existence of ghosts. But to tell  the truth, I doubted very much if the Colonel's word, in these  circumstances, could be relied upon. I had grave suspicions that this  \"haunting\" was but an invention for the purpose of getting me to  Eastover. However, as it was just possible that I might be  mistaken--that there really was a ghost, and as I had not seen Colonel  Onslow for a long time, and indulged in feelings of the warmest regard  both for him and his wife, I resolved to go.    Accordingly I set out early in the afternoon of the Good Friday. The  weather, which had been muggy in London, grew colder and colder the  further we advanced along the line, and by the time we reached Eastover  there was every prospect of a storm.    As I expected, a closed carriage had been sent to meet me; for the  Colonel, carrying conservatism--with more conservatism than sense,  perhaps--to a fine point, cherished a deep-rooted aversion to  innovations of any sort, and consequently abhorred motors. His house,  Eastover Hall, is three miles from the station, and lies at the foot of  a steep spine of the Chilterns.    The grounds of Eastover Hall were extensive; but, in the ordinary sense,  far from beautiful. To me, however, they were more than beautiful; there  was a grandeur in them--a grandeur that appealed to me far more than  mere beauty--the grandeur of desolation, the grandeur of the Unknown. As  we passed through the massive iron gates of the lodge, I looked upon  countless acres of withered, undulating grass; upon a few rank sedges;  upon a score or so of decayed trees; upon a house--huge, bare, grey and  massive; upon bleak walls; upon vacant, eye-like windows; upon crude,  scenic inhospitality, the very magnitude of which overpowered me. I have  said it was cold; but there hung over the estate of Eastover an iciness  that brought with it a quickening, a sickening of the heart, and a  dreariness that, whilst being depressing in the extreme, was, withal,  sublime. Sublime and mysterious; mysterious and insoluble. A thousand  fancies swarmed through my mind; yet I could grapple with none; and I  was loth to acknowledge that, although there are combinations of very  simple material objects which might have had the power of affecting me  thus, yet any attempt to analyse that power was beyond--far beyond--my  mental capability.    The house, though old--and its black oak panellings, silent staircases,  dark corridors, and general air of gloom were certainly suggestive of  ghosts--did not affect me in the same degree. The fear it inspired was  the ordinary fear inspired by the ordinary superphysical, but the fear I  felt in the grounds was a fear created by something out of the  way--something far more bizarre than a mere phantom of the dead.    The Colonel asked me if I had experienced any unusual sensations the  moment I entered the house, and I told him, \"Yes.\"    \"Nearly everyone does,\" he replied, \"and yet, so far as I know, no one  has ever seen anything. The noises we hear all round the house have  lately been more frequent. I won't describe them; I want to learn your  unbiassed opinion of them first.\"    We then had tea, and whilst the rest--there was a large  house-party--indulged in music and cards, the Colonel and I had a  delightful chat about old times. I went to bed in the firm resolution of  keeping awake till at least two; but I was very tired, and the excessive  cold had made me extremely sleepy; consequently, despite my heroic  efforts, I gradually dozed off, and knew no more till it was broad  daylight and the butler entered my room with a cup of tea. When I came  down to breakfast I found everyone in the best of spirits. The Onslows  are \"great hands\" at original entertainments, and the announcement that  there would be a masked ball that evening was received with tremendous  enthusiasm.    \"To-night we dance, to-morrow we feed on Easter eggs and fancy cakes,\"  one of the guests laughingly whispered. \"What a nicely ordered  programme! I hear, too, we are to have a real old-fashioned Easter  Day--heaving and lifting, and stool-ball. Egad! The Colonel deserves  knighthood!\"    Soon after breakfast there was a general stampede to Seeton and  Dinstable to buy gifts; for in that respect again the Onslows stuck to  old customs, and there was a general interchange of presents on Easter  morning. My purchases made, I joined one or two of the house-party at  lunch in Seeton, cycled back alone to Eastover in time for tea; and, at  five o'clock, commenced my first explorations of the grounds. The sky  having become clouded my progress was somewhat slow. I did the Park  first, and I had not gone very far before I detected the same presence I  had so acutely felt the previous afternoon. Like the scent of a wild  beast, it had a certain defined track which I followed astutely,  eventually coming to a full stop in front of a wall of rock. I then  perceived by the aid of a few fitful rays of suppressed light, which at  intervals struggled successfully through a black bank of clouds, the  yawning mouth of a big cavern, from the roof of which hung innumerable  stalactites. I now suddenly realized that I was in a very lonely,  isolated spot, and became immeasurably perturbed. The Unknown Something  in the atmosphere which had inspired me with so much fear was here  conglomerated--it was no longer the mere essence--it was the whole  Thing. The whole Thing, but what was that Thing? A hideous fascination  made me keep my gaze riveted on the gaping hole opposite me. At first I  could make out nothing--nothing but jagged walls and roof, and empty  darkness; then there suddenly appeared in the very innermost recesses of  the cave a faint glow of crimson light which grew and grew, until with  startling abruptness it resolved itself into two huge eyes, red and  menacing. The sight was so unexpected, and, by reason of its intense  malignity, so appalling, that I was simply dumbfounded. I could do  nothing but stare at the Thing--paralysed and speechless. I made a  desperate effort to get back my self-possession; I strove with all my  might to reason with myself, to assure myself that this was the supreme  moment of my life, the moment I had so long and earnestly desired. But  it was in vain; I was terrified--helplessly, hopelessly terrified. The  eyes moved, they drew nearer and nearer to me, and as they did so they  became more and more hostile. I opened my mouth to shout for help, I  could feel my lungs bursting under the tension; not a sound came; and  then--then, as the eyes closed on me, and I could feel the cold, clammy  weight pressing me down, there rang out, loud and clear, in the keen and  cutting air of the spring evening, a whole choir of voices--the village  choral society.    I am not particularly fond of music--certainly not of village music,  however well trained it may be; but I can honestly affirm that, at that  moment, no sounds could have been more welcome to me than those old  folk-songs piped by the rustics, for the instant they commenced the  spell that so closely held me prisoner was broken, my faculties  returned, and reeling back out of the clutches of the hateful Thing, I  joyfully turned and fled.    I related my adventure to the Colonel, and he told me that the cave was  generally deemed to be the most haunted spot in the grounds, that no one  cared to venture there alone after dark.    \"I have myself many times visited the cave at night--in the company of  others,\" he said, \"and we have invariably experienced sensations of the  utmost horror and repulsion, though we have seen nothing. It must be a  devil.\"    I thought so, too, and exclaimed with some vehemence that the proper  course for him to pursue was to have the cave filled in or blasted. That  night I awoke at about one o'clock with the feeling very strong on me  that something was prowling about under my window. For some time I  fought against the impulse to get out of bed and look, but at last I  yielded. It was bright moonlight--every obstacle in the grounds stood  out with wonderful clearness--and directly beneath the window, peering  up at me, were the eyes--red, lurid, satanical. A dog barked, and they  vanished. I did not sleep again that night, not until the daylight  broke, when I had barely shut my eyes before I was aroused by decidedly  material bangings on the doors and hyper-boisterous Easter greetings.    After breakfast a few of the party went to church, a few into the  nursery to romp with the children, whilst the rest dispersed in  different directions. At luncheon all met again, and there was much  merry-making over the tansy cakes--very foolish, no doubt, but to me at  least very delightful, and perhaps a wise practice, at times, even for  the most prosaic. In the afternoon the Colonel took me for a drive to a  charmingly picturesque village in the Chilterns, whence we did not set  out on our way back till it was twilight.    The Colonel was a good whip, and the horse, though young and rather  high-spirited, was, he said,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18237"],[0,"A Bird Calendar for Northern India (#20)"],[1,"land. Both  are months of hope, heralds of the most pleasant period of the year.  In both the countryside is fresh and green. In both millions of avian  visitors arrive.    Like the English April, October in Northern India is welcome chiefly  for that to which it leads. But it has merits of its own. Is not each  of its days cooler than the preceding one? Does it not produce the  joyous morn on which human beings awake to find that the hot weather  is a thing of the past?    Throughout October the sun's rays are hot, but, for an hour or two  after dawn, especially in the latter half of the month, the climate  leaves little to be desired. An outing in the early morning is a thing  of joy, if it be taken while yet the air retains the freshness  imparted to it by the night, and before the grass has yielded up the  sparkling jewels acquired during the hours of darkness. It is good to  ride forth on an October morn with the object of renewing acquaintance  with nimble wagtails, sprightly redstarts, stately demoiselle cranes  and other newly-returned migrants. In addition to meeting many winter  visitors, the rider may, if he be fortunate, come upon a colony of  sand-martins that has begun nesting operations.    The husbandman enjoys very little leisure at this season of the year.  From dawn till sunset he ploughs, or sows, or reaps, or threshes, or  winnows.    The early-sown rice yields the first-fruits of the _kharif_ harvest.  By the end of the month it has disappeared before the sickle and many  of the fields occupied by it have been sown with gram. The hemp  (_san_) is the next crop to mature. In some parts of Northern India  its vivid yellow flowers are the most conspicuous feature of the  autumn landscape. They are as brilliantly coloured as broom. The _san_  plant is not allowed to display its gilded blooms for long, it is cut  down in the prime of life and cast into a village pond, there to soak.  The harvesting of the various millets, the picking of the cotton, and  the sowing of the wheat, barley, gram and poppy begin before the close  of the month. The sugar-cane, the _arhar_ and the late-sown rice are  not yet ready for the sickle. Those crops will be cut in November and  December.    As in September so in October the birds are less vociferous than they  were in the spring and the hot weather. During the earlier part of the  month the notes of the koel and the brain-fever bird are heard on rare  occasions; before October has given place to November, these noisy  birds cease to trouble. The pied starlings have become comparatively  subdued, their joyful melody is no longer a notable feature of the  avian chorus. In the first half of the month the green barbets utter  their familiar cries at frequent intervals; as the weather grows  colder they call less often, but at no season of the year do they  cease altogether to raise their voices. The _tonk_, _tonk_, _tonk_ of  the coppersmith is rarely heard in October; during the greater part of  the cold weather this barbet is a silent creature, reminding us of its  presence now and then by calling out _wow_ softly, as if half ashamed  at the sound of its voice. The oriole now utters its winter note  _tew_, and that sound is heard only occasionally.    It is unnecessary to state that the perennials--the crows, kites,  doves, bee-eaters, tree-pies, tailor-birds, cuckoo-shrikes, green  parrots, jungle and spotted owlets--are noisy throughout the month.    The king-crows no longer utter the soft notes which they seem to keep  for the rainy season; but, before settling down to the sober delights  of the winter, some individuals become almost as lively and vociferous  as they were in the nesting season. Likewise some pairs of \"blue jays\"  behave, in September and October, as though they were about to  recommence courtship; they perform strange evolutions in the air and  emit harsh cries, but these lead to nothing; after a few days of noisy  behaviour the birds resume their more normal habits.    The hoopoes have been silent for some time, but in October a few of  them take up their refrain--_uk-uk-uk-uk_, and utter it with almost as  much vigour as they did in March.    It would thus seem that the change of season, the approach of winter,  has a stimulating influence on king-crows, rollers and hoopoes,  causing the energy latent within them suddenly to become active and to  manifest itself in the form of song or dance.    In October the pied chat and the wood-shrike frequently make sweet  melody. Throughout the month the cock sunbirds sing as lustily and  almost as brilliantly as canaries; many of them are beginning to  reassume the iridescent purple plumage which they doffed some time  ago. From every mango tope emanates the cheerful lay of the fantail  flycatcher and the lively \"Think of me ... Never to be\" of the  grey-headed flycatcher. Amadavats sing sweet little songs without  words as they flit about among the tall grasses.    In the early morning and at eventide, the crow-pheasants give vent to  their owl-like hoot, preceded by a curious guttural _kok-kok-kok_. The  young ones, that left the nest some weeks ago, are rapidly losing  their barred plumage and are assuming the appearance of the adult. By  the middle of November very few immature crow-pheasants are seen.    Migration and moulting are the chief events in the feathered world at  the present season. The flood of autumn immigration, which arose as a  tiny stream in August, and increased in volume nightly throughout  September, becomes, in October, a mighty river on the bosom of which  millions of birds are borne.    Day by day the avian population of the _jhils_ increases. At the  beginning of the month the garganey teal are almost the only migratory  ducks to be seen on them. By the first of November brahminy duck,  gadwall, common teal, widgeon, shovellers and the various species of  pochard abound. With the duck come demoiselle cranes, curlews, storks,  and sandpipers of various species. The geese and the pintail ducks,  however, do not return to India until November. These are the last of  the regular winter visitors to come and the first to go.    The various kinds of birds of prey which began to appear in September  continue to arrive throughout the present month.    Grey-headed and red-breasted flycatchers, minivets, bush-chats,  rose-finches and swallows pour into the plains from the Himalayas,  while from beyond those mountains come redstarts, wagtails, starlings,  buntings, blue-throats, quail and snipe. Along with the other migrants  come numbers of rooks and jackdaws. These do not venture far into  India; they confine themselves to the North-West Frontier Province and  the Punjab, where they remain during the greater part of the winter.  The exodus, from the above-mentioned Provinces, of the bee-eaters,  sunbirds, yellow-throated sparrows, orioles, red turtle-doves and  paradise flycatchers is complete by the end of October. The above are  by no means the only birds that undergo local migration. The great  majority of species probably move about in a methodical manner in the  course of the year; a great deal of local migration is overlooked,  because the birds that move away from a locality are replaced by  others of their kind that come from other places.    During a spell of exceptionally cold weather a great many Himalayan  birds are driven by the snow into the plains of India, where they  remain for a few days or weeks. Some of these migrants are noticed in  the calendar for December.    In October the annual moult of the birds is completed, so that,  clothed in their warm new feathers, they are ready for winter some  time before it comes. In the case of the redstart, the bush-chat, most  of the wagtails, and some other species, the moult completely changes  the colouring of the bird. The reason of this is that the edges of the  new feathers are not of the same colour as the inner parts. Only the  margins show, because the feathers of a bird overlap like slates on a  roof, or the scales of a fish. After a time the edges of the new  feathers become worn away, and then the differently-hued deeper parts  begin to show, so that the bird gradually resumes the appearance it  had before the moult. When the redstarts reach India in September most  of the cocks are grey birds, because of the grey margins to their  feathers; by the middle of April, when they begin to depart, many of  them are black, the grey margins of the feathers having completely  disappeared; other individuals are still grey because the margins of  the feathers are broader or have not worn so much.    October is the month in which the falconer sallies forth to secure the  hawks which will be employed in \"the sport of kings\" during the cold  weather. There are several methods of catching birds of prey, as  indeed there are of capturing almost every bird and beast. The amount  of poaching that goes on in this country is appalling, and, unless  determined efforts are made to check it, there is every prospect of  the splendid fauna of India being ruined. The sportsman is bound by  all manner of restrictions, but the poacher is allowed to work his  wicked will on the birds and beasts of the country, almost without let  or hindrance.    The apparatus usually employed for the capture of the peregrine, the  shahin and other falcons is a well-limed piece of cane, about the  length of the expanse of a falcon's wings. To the middle of this a  dove, of which the eyelids have been sewn up, is tied. When a wild  falcon appears on the scene the bird-catcher throws into the air the  cane with the luckless dove attached to it. The dove flies about  aimlessly, being unable to see, and is promptly pounced upon by the  falcon, whose wings strike the limed cane and become stuck to it; then  falcon and dove fall together to the ground, where they are secured by  the bird-catcher.    Another method largely resorted to is to tether a myna,"]]]
