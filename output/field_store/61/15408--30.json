Hence it was in imitation of the arrangement of the  tie-beams that men began to employ, in Doric buildings, the device of  triglyphs and the metopes between the beams.    3. Later, others in other buildings allowed the projecting principal  rafters to run out till they were flush with the triglyphs, and then  formed their projections into simae. From that practice, like the  triglyphs from the arrangement of the tie-beams, the system of mutules  under the coronae was devised from the projections of the principal  rafters. Hence generally, in buildings of stone and marble, the mutules  are carved with a downward slant, in imitation of the principal rafters.  For these necessarily have a slanting and projecting position to let the  water drip down. The scheme of triglyphs and mutules in Doric buildings  was, therefore, the imitative device that I have described.    4. It cannot be that the triglyphs represent windows, as some have  erroneously said, since the triglyphs are placed at the corners and over  the middle of columns--places where, from the nature of the case, there  can be no windows at all. For buildings are wholly disconnected at the  corners if openings for windows are left at those points. Again, if we  are to suppose that there were open windows where the triglyphs now  stand, it will follow, on the same principle, that the dentils of the  Ionic order have likewise taken the places of windows. For the term  \"metope\" is used of the intervals between dentils as well as of those  between triglyphs. The Greeks call the seats of tie-beams and rafters  [Greek: opai], while our people call these cavities columbaria  (dovecotes). Hence, the space between the tie-beams, being the space  between two \"opae,\" was named by them [Greek: metope].    5. The system of triglyphs and mutules was invented for the Doric order,  and similarly the scheme of dentils belongs to the Ionic, in which there  are proper grounds for its use in buildings. Just as mutules represent  the projection of the principal rafters, so dentils in the Ionic are an  imitation of the projections of the common rafters. And so in Greek  works nobody ever put dentils under mutules, as it is impossible that  common rafters should be underneath principal rafters. Therefore, if  that which in the original must be placed above the principal rafters,  is put in the copy below them, the result will be a work constructed on  false principles. Neither did the ancients approve of or employ mutules  or dentils in pediments, but only plain coronae, for the reason that  neither principal nor common rafters tail into the fronts of pediments,  nor can they overhang them, but they are laid with a slope towards the  eaves. Hence the ancients held that what could not happen in the  original would have no valid reason for existence in the copy.    6. For in all their works they proceeded on definite principles of  fitness and in ways derived from the truth of Nature. Thus they reached  perfection, approving only those things which, if challenged, can be  explained on grounds of the truth. Hence, from the sources which have  been described they established and left us the rules of symmetry and  proportion for each order. Following in their steps, I have spoken above  on the Ionic and Corinthian styles, and I shall now briefly explain the  theory of the Doric and its general appearance.          CHAPTER III    PROPORTIONS OF DORIC TEMPLES      1. Some of the ancient architects said that the Doric order ought not to  be used for temples, because faults and incongruities were caused by the  laws of its symmetry. Arcesius and Pytheos said so, as well as  Hermogenes. He, for instance, after getting together a supply of marble  for the construction of a Doric temple, changed his mind and built an  Ionic temple to Father Bacchus with the same materials. This is not  because it is unlovely in appearance or origin or dignity of form, but  because the arrangement of the triglyphs and metopes (lacunaria) is an  embarrassment and inconvenience to the work.    2. For the triglyphs ought to be placed so as to correspond to the  centres of the columns, and the metopes between the triglyphs ought to  be as broad as they are high. But in violation of this rule, at the  corner columns triglyphs are placed at the outside edges and not  corresponding to the centre of the columns. Hence the metopes next to  the corner columns do not come out perfectly square, but are too broad  by half the width of a triglyph. Those who would make the metopes all  alike, make the outermost intercolumniations narrower by half the width  of a triglyph. But the result is faulty, whether it is attained by  broader metopes or narrower intercolumniations. For this reason, the  ancients appear to have avoided the scheme of the Doric order in their  temples.    3. However, since our plan calls for it, we set it forth as we have  received it from our teachers, so that if anybody cares to set to work  with attention to these laws, he may find the proportions stated by  which he can construct correct and faultless examples of temples in the  Doric fashion.    Let the front of a Doric temple, at the place where the columns are put  up, be divided, if it is to be tetrastyle, into twenty-seven parts; if  hexastyle, into forty-two. One of these parts will be the module (in  Greek [Greek: embates]); and this module once fixed, all the parts of  the work are adjusted by means of calculations based upon it.    4. The thickness of the columns will be two modules, and their height,  including the capitals, fourteen. The height of a capital will be one  module, and its breadth two and one sixth modules. Let the height of the  capital be divided into three parts, of which one will form the abacus  with its cymatium, the second the echinus with its annulets, and the  third the necking. The diminution of the column should be the same as  described for Ionic columns in the third book. The height of the  architrave, including taenia and guttae, is one module, and of the  taenia, one seventh of a module. The guttae, extending as wide as the  triglyphs and beneath the taenia, should hang down for one sixth of a  module, including their regula. The depth of the architrave on its under  side should answer to the necking at the top of the column. Above the  architrave, the triglyphs and metopes are to be placed: the triglyphs  one and one half modules high, and one module wide in front. They are to  be arranged so that one is placed to correspond to the centre of each  corner and intermediate column, and two over each intercolumniation  except the middle intercolumniations of the front and rear porticoes,  which have three each. The intervals in the middle being thus extended,  a free passage will be afforded to those who would approach the statues  of the gods.    [Illustration: VITRUVIUS' DORIC ORDER COMPARED WITH THE TEMPLE AT CORI  AND THE DORIC ORDER OF THE THEATRE OF MARCELLUS]    5. The width of the triglyph should be divided into six parts, and five  of these marked off in the middle by means of the rule, and two half  parts at the right and left. Let one part, that in the centre, form a  \"femur\" (in Greek [Greek: meros]). On each side of it are the channels,  to be cut in to fit the tip of a carpenter's square, and in succession  the other femora, one at the right and the other at the left of a  channel. To the outsides are relegated the semichannels. The triglyphs  having been thus arranged, let the metopes between the triglyphs be as  high as they are wide, while at the outer corners there should be  semimetopes inserted, with the width of half a module.    In these ways all defects will be corrected, whether in metopes or  intercolumniations or lacunaria, as all the arrangements have been made  with uniformity.    6. The capitals of each triglyph are to measure one sixth of a module.  Over the capitals of the triglyphs the corona is to be placed, with a  projection of two thirds of a module, and having a Doric cymatium at the  bottom and another at the top. So the corona with its cymatia is half a  module in height. Set off on the under side of the corona, vertically  over the triglyphs and over the middle of the metopes, are the viae in  straight lines and the guttae arranged in rows, six guttae broad and  three deep. The spaces left (due to the fact that the metopes are  broader than the triglyphs) may be left unornamented or may have  thunderbolts carved on them. Just at the edge of the corona a line  should be cut in, called the scotia. All the other parts, such as  tympana and the simae of the corona, are to be constructed as described  above in the case of the Ionic order.    7. Such will be the scheme established for diastyle buildings. But if  the building is to be systyle and monotriglyphic, let the front of the  temple, if tetrastyle, be divided into nineteen and a half parts; if  hexastyle, into twenty-nine and a half parts. One of these parts will  form the module in accordance with which the adjustments are to be made  as above described.    8. Thus, over each portion of the architrave two metopes and two  triglyphs[3] will be placed; and, in addition, at the corners half a  triglyph and besides a space large enough for a half triglyph. At the  centre, vertically under the gable, there should be room for three  triglyphs and three metopes, in order that the centre intercolumniation,  by its greater width, may give ample room for people to enter the  temple, and may lend an imposing effect to the view of the statues of  the gods.    [Note 3: That is: two metopes with"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20248"],[0,"The Necessity of Atheism (#20)"],[1," an opinion that runs counter to the accepted mode  of thinking. It is much easier and much more pleasant to give oneself  passively to that delusion of grandeur, that delusion that pleasantly  drugs the mind with the assumption that there is a supreme being who is  personally interested in our well-being; a providence who, like a school  master, at his pleasure dispenses rewards and punishments; as  immortality, Heaven and Hell. So firmly has this become entrenched in  the minds of men that the irrationalities which manifest themselves  against such a conception make no impression. Schopenhauer well states,  \"Nothing is more provoking, when we are arguing against a man with  reasons and explanations, and taking all pains to convince him, than to  discover at last that he _will_ not understand, that we have to do with  his _will_.\"    The Martian, knowing the widespread extent of religious beliefs and  their supposed influence in our daily lives, is prepared to find in our  annals a vast literature that would attest to the overwhelming benefits  that mankind had derived from his religious beliefs.    He is amazed to find that the little good which religion had  accomplished, had occurred at the time when our race was in its infancy.  Just as fear is instilled into the mind of the child to protect it from  the dangers of its environment before the child has reached the age when  it can use its reason for protection, just so had religion, by its  implantation of fear, served its purpose in the days of our racial  childhood. The child, however, as soon as it learns to reason, replaces  those fears by a logical comprehension of the laws governing his  environment. But in religious matters this fear has clung to man  tenaciously; and while at first serving a protective function, at the  present stage of civilization constitutes an embryonic impediment. The  assertion of ecclesiastics that without the aid of religious learning  and influence our civilization would have been retarded is a statement  that a study of the development of man shows to be directly opposed to  the facts; that religion has been the greatest impediment in the road to  progress. This will be shown in the subsequent chapters. The  oft-repeated assertion that, during the Middle Ages, ecclesiastic  influence was the saving grace is well refuted by Dr. William J.  Robinson:    \"We are told by the Church apologists that during the Middle Ages the  priests and monks kept up the torch of learning, that, being the only  literate people, they brought back the study of the classics.  Historically speaking, this is about the most impudent statement that  one could imagine. It was the Church that retarded human progress at  least one thousand years, it is the Church that put a thick,  impenetrable pall over the sun of learning and science, so that humanity  was enveloped in utter darkness, and if the priests and monks later  learned to read and write (from the Arabs, Jews, and Greeks exiled from  Constantinople after 1453), it is because they wanted to keep the power  in their hands; the people they did not permit to learn either to read  or write. _Even the reading of the Bible, bear in mind, was considered a  crime._ We are told that the priests and monks built hospitals and gave  alms to the poor. Having gotten enormous tracts of the best land into  their hands, so that the people were starving, they were willing to  throw a bone occasionally to the latter. It cost them nothing and it  gave them a reputation for charity. They built enormous monasteries with  well filled cellars, and lived on the fat of the land, while the people  lived in wretched hovels, working their lives away for a crust of bread.  The beasts, the domestic animals lived a more comfortable life than did  the men, women, and children of the people. And the Church never, never  raised a finger to ameliorate their condition. It kept them in  superstitious darkness and helped the temporal lords--for a long period  the spiritual were also the temporal lords--to keep them in fear,  subjection and slavery.\"    The Martian being an impartial observer examined what had been done by  Christianity for the intellectual and material advancement of humanity  during her long reign, and what had been done by science and purely  secular knowledge in its brief period of activity, the period when  science and secular knowledge had partially liberated themselves from  ecclesiastical domination. He came to the conclusion that in instituting  a comparison he had established a contrast.          CHAPTER VI    RELIGION AND SCIENCE        _Science, then, commands our respect, not on the basis that its      present assumptions and deductions are absolutely and for all time      true, but on the ground that its method is for all time true--the      method of discovery, the method of observation, research,      experimentation, comparison, examination, testing, analysis and      synthesis._        MAYNARD SHIPLEY, \"The War on Modern Science.\"        _In the bare three and one-half centuries since modern science      began, the churches had conducted an unremitting crusade against it.      That much of this crusade had turned into a rear-guard action was      due less to the weakness of the defenders of the faith than to the      invulnerability of their non-resistant victim._        HORACE M. KALLEN, \"Why Religion?\"      Some sixty years ago in the \"Dogmatic Constitution of the Catholic  Faith,\" the Church stated, \"But never can reason be rendered capable of  thoroughly understanding mysteries as it does those truths which form  its proper subject. We, therefore, pronounce false every assertion which  is contrary to the enlightened truth of faith.... Hence, all the  Christian faithful are not only forbidden to defend as legitimate  conclusions of science those opinions which are known to be contrary to  the doctrine of faith, especially when condemned by the Church, but are  rather absolutely bound to hold them for errors wearing the deceitful  appearance of truth. Let him be anathema....    \"Who shall say that human sciences ought to be pursued in such a spirit  of freedom that one may be allowed to hold true their assertions even  when opposed to revealed doctrine.\"    Can anything stronger be said to discourage research, investigation,  experiment, and retard progress? And only sixty years ago! It is but the  restatement of what the Church has uttered so many times and for so  long--that all knowledge, material as well as spiritual, is to be found  in the Bible as interpreted by the Church. It was this myth which had  stultified the mind of man for 1500 years (during the period in which  the Church was dominant); it was this that had killed the urge to search  and seek for the truth, which is the goal of all science, the means by  which humanity is set on the road to progress. This was the damnable  precept foisted on the minds of men which enslaved them throughout the  ages, and from which we are just emerging. This was the precept that  plunged the world into the Dark Ages, and retarded the advance of  mankind for centuries.    This is the reason that it is utterly impossible for the intellectually  honest scientist, and for that matter any individual, to reconcile  science with religion. On the one hand, that of religion, we have the  forces of intolerance, superstition, and the endeavor to besmirch,  repress, and ridicule every advance favorable to mankind; to cloak with  meaningless words obsolete rites, to stand in the way of human progress,  because it does not permit men to think boldly and logically. Science,  on the other hand, does not hesitate to tear down old conceptions, and  has only one motive, the ultimate truth. Religion has the purpose of  keeping the masses in the narrow and false path of only accepted  doctrines. The true scientist is the man with the open mind, one who  will discard the worthless and accept only the proven good. The  religionist closes his mind to all facts which he is unwilling to  believe, everything which will endanger his creed. Religion teaches the  individual to place all hope, all desire, in a problematical hereafter.  The stay on earth is so short compared to the everlasting life to come,  that of what interest is this life; all things are vain. The misery, the  suffering, of his fellow men leave him cold; he can only think of living  in the light of his narrow creed so that he may gain his future reward.  How well this philosophy has fitted in with the schemes of the select  few for the control of the many!    Truth to the scientific mind is something provisional, a hypothesis that  for the present moment best conforms to the recognized tests. It is an  evolving conception in a constantly changing universe. It is not that  science has attained true conclusions; not that the evidence at hand  must remain immutable; but that the scientific method of analyzing and  formulating assumptions on the basis of discovery, on ascertained facts,  is a superior method to the closed \"infallible\" method of \"revelation.\"  These assumptions, based upon the known facts, lead to a working  hypothesis which in turn develops into a theory. If the theory is  adopted it must account for the facts known. But the theory is not held  as final, it is always changed or abandoned if necessary to conform to  the new discovered data. Science welcomes the critical attitude that  leads to the refinement of its theories. There may be today various  theories held by scientists in which they are mistaken, but the question  of the _method_ by which they arrive at conclusions can no longer be  under consideration with regard to its validity.    To the scientific mind, knowledge is something to be arrived at by study  and research. To the religionist, knowledge is something that is  contained in an infallible and supernatural statement or insight.  Religion exalts the transcendental;"]]]
