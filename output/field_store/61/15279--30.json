These public readings, which were  common throughout Greece and its colonies, had not a little effect on  the authors. They then wrote for the ear rather than the eye, to be  listened to rather than to be read, which was one among the causes of  Greek elegance and simplicity of style.    Among others who were brought to Alexandria by the fame of Philadelphus'  bounty was Zoilus, the grammarian, whose ill-natured criticism on  Homer's poems had earned for him the name of Homeromastix, or the  scourge of Homer. He read his criticisms to Philadelphus, who was so  much displeased with his carping and unfair manner of finding fault,  that he even refused to relieve him when in distress. The king told him,  that while hundreds had earned a livelihood by pointing out the beauties  of the Iliad and Odyssey in their public readings, surely one person who  was so much wiser might be able to live by pointing out the faults.    Timon, a tragic poet, was also one of the visitors to this court; but,  as he was more fond of eating and drinking than of philosophy, we need  not wonder at our knowing nothing of his tragedies, or at his not  being made a professor by Philadelphus. But he took his revenge on the  better-fed philosophers of the court, in a poem in which he calls them  literary fighting-cocks, who were being fattened by the king, and were  always quarrelling in the coops of the museum.    The Alexandrian men of science and letters maintained themselves, some  few by fees received from their pupils, others as professors holding  salaries in the museum, and others by civil employments under the  government. There was little to encourage in them the feelings of noble  pride or independence. The first rank in Alexandria was held by the  civil and military servants of the crown, who enjoyed the lucrative  employments of receiving the taxes, hearing the lawsuits by appeal, and  repressing rebellions. With these men the philosophers mixed, not as  equals, but partaking of their wealth and luxuries, and paying their  score with wit and conversation. There were no landholders in the city,  as the soil of the country was owned by Egyptians; and the wealthy  trading classes, of all nations and languages, could bestow little  patronage on Greek learning, and therefore little independence on its  professors.    Philadelphus was not less fond of paintings and statues than of books;  and he seems to have joined the Achaian league as much for the sake of  the pictures which Aratus, its general, was in the habit of sending  to him, as for political reasons. Aratus, the chief of Sicyon, was an  acknowledged judge of paintings, and Sicyon was then the first school  of Greece. The pieces which he sent to Philadelphus were mostly those of  Pamphilus, the master, and of Melanthius, the fellow-pupil, of Apelles.  Pamphilus was famed for his perspective; and he is said to have received  from every pupil the large sum of ten talents, or seven thousand five  hundred dollars, a year. His best known pieces were, Ulysses in his  ship, and the victory of the Athenians near the town of Phlius. It was  through Pamphilus that, at first in Sicyon, and afterwards throughout  all Greece, drawing was taught to boys as part of a liberal education.  Neacles also painted for Aratus; and we might almost suppose that it was  as a gift to the King of Egypt that he painted his Sea-fight between the  Egyptians and the Persians, in which the painter shows us that it was  fought within the mouth of the Nile by making a crocodile bite at an ass  drinking on the shore.    Helena, the daughter of Timon, was a painter of some note at this time,  at Alexandria; but the only piece of hers known to us by name is the  Battle of Issus, which three hundred years afterwards was hung up by  Vespasian in the Temple of Peace at Rome. We must wonder at a woman  choosing to paint the horrors and pains of a battle-piece; but, as we  are not told what point of time was chosen, we may hope that it was  after the battle, when Alexander, in his tent, raised up from their  knees the wife and lovely daughter of Darius, who had been found among  the prisoners. As for the Egyptians, they showed no taste in painting.    [Illustration: 137.jpg METHOD OF EGYPTIAN DRAFTSMANSHIP]    Their method of drawing the human figure mathematically by means of  squares, which was not unsuitable in working a statue sixty feet high,  checked all flights of genius; and it afterwards destroyed Greek art,  when the Greek painters were idle enough to use it. We hear but little  of the statues and sculptures made for Philadelphus; but we cannot help  remarking that, while the public places of Athens were filled with  the statues of the great and good men who had deserved well of their  country, the statues which were most common in Alexandria were those of  Cline, a favourite damsel, who filled the office of cup-bearer to the  king of Egypt.    The favour shown to the Jews by Ptolemy Soter was not withdrawn by his  son. He even bought from his own soldiers and freed from slavery one  hundred and twenty thousand men of that nation, who were scattered over  Egypt. He paid for each, out of the royal treasury, one hundred and  twenty drachmas, or about fifteen dollars, to those of his subjects who  held them either by right of war or by purchase. In fixing the amount  of the ransom, the king would seem to have been guided by his Jewish  advisers, as this is exactly equal to thirty shekels, the sum fixed  by the Jewish law as the price of a slave. The Jews who lived in Lower  Egypt, in the enjoyment of civil and religious liberty, looked upon that  country as their home. They had already a Greek translation of either  the whole or some part of their sacred writings, which had been made for  those whose families had been for so many generations in Egypt that they  could not read the language of their forefathers. But they now hoped,  by means of the king's friendship and the weight which his wishes must  carry with them, to have a Greek translation of the Bible which should  bear the stamp of official authority.    Accordingly, to please them, Philadelphus sent Aris-taaus, a man whose  wisdom had gained his friendship, and Andrseus, a captain of the guard,  both of them Greek Jews, with costly gifts to Eleazer, the high priest  of Jerusalem; and asked him to employ learned and fit men to make a  Greek translation of the Bible for the library at Alexandria. Eleazer,  so runs the tradition, named seventy elders to undertake the task, who  held their first sitting on the business at the king's dinner-table;  when Menedemus, the Socratic philosopher, the pupil of Plato, was also  present, who had been sent to Philadelphus as ambassador from Eubcea.  The translators then divided the work among themselves; and when each  had finished his task it wras laid before a meeting of the seventy, and  then published by authority. Thus was said to have been made the  Greek translation of the Old Testament, which, from the number of the  translators, we now call the Septuagint; but a doubt is thrown upon  the whole story by the fables which have been mingled with it to give  authority to the translation. By this translation the Bible became known  for the first time to the Greek philosophers. We do not indeed hear that  they immediately read it or noticed it, we do not find it quoted till  after the spread of Christianity; but it had a silent effect on  their opinions, which we trace in the new school of Platonists soon  afterwards rising in Alexandria.    When Aratus of Sicyon first laid a plot to free his country from its  tyrant, who reigned by the help of the King of Macedonia, he sent to  Philadelphus to beg for money. He naturally looked to the King of Egypt  for help when entering upon a struggle against their common rival; but  the king seems to have thought the plans of this young man too wild to  be countenanced. Aratus, however, soon raised Sicyon to a level with the  first states of Greece, and made himself leader of the Achaian league,  under which band and name the Greeks were then struggling for freedom  against Macedonia; and when, by his courage and success, he had shown  himself worthy of the proud name which was afterwards given him, of the  \"Last of the Greeks,\" Philadelphus, like other patrons, gave him  the help which he less needed. Aratus, as we have seen, bought his  friendship with pictures, the gifts of all others the most welcome;  and, when he went to Egypt, Philadelphus gave him one hundred and fifty  talents, or forty-five thousand dollars, and joined the Achaian league,  on the agreement that in carrying on the war by sea and land they should  obey the orders from Alexandria.    The friendship of Philadelphus, indeed, was courted by all the  neighbouring states; the little island of Delos set up its statue to  him; and the cities of Greece vied with one another in doing him honour.  The Athenians named one of the tribes of their city and also one  of their public lecture-rooms by his name; and two hundred years  afterwards, when Cicero and his friend Atticus were learning wisdom and  eloquence from the lips of Antiochus in Athens, it was in the gymnasium  of Ptolemy.    Philadelphus, when young, had married Arsinoe, the daughter of  Lysimachus of Thrace, by whom he had three children, Ptolemy, who  succeeded him, Lysimachus, and Berenice; but, having found that his  wife was intriguing with Amyntas, and with his physician Chrysippus  of Rhodes, he put these two to death and banished the Queen Arsinoe to  Koptos in the Thebaid.    He then took Arsinoe, his own sister, as the partner of his throne. She  had married first the old Lysimachus, King of Thrace, and then Ceraunus,  her half-brother, when he was King of Macedonia. As they were not  children of the same mother, this second marriage was neither illegal  nor improper in Macedonia; but her third"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17331"],[0,"History of Egypt From 330 B.C. To the Present Time, Volume 11 (of 12) (#20)"],[1,"for those sounds which  the Greeks did not use; and the writing was then written from left to  right like a European language instead of in either direction according  to the skill or fancy of the scribe.    It was only upon the ancient hieroglyphics thus falling into disuse that  the Greeks of Alexandria, almost for the first time, had the  curiosity to study the principles on which they were written. Clemens  Alexandrinus, who thought no branch of knowledge unworthy of his  attention, gives a slight account of them, nearly agreeing with the  results of our modern discoveries. He mentions the three kinds of  writing; first, the _hieroglyphic_; secondly, the _hieratic_, which is  nearly the same, but written with a pen, and less ornamental than  the carved figures; and thirdly, the _demotic_, or common alphabetic  writing. He then divides the hieroglyphic into the alphabetic and  the symbolic; and lastly, he divides the symbolic characters into the  imitative, the figurative, and those formed like riddles. As instances  of these last we may quote, for the first, the three zigzag lines which  by simple imitation mean \"water;\" for the second, the oval which mean  \"a name,\" because kings' names were written within ovals; and for the  third, a cup with three anvils, which mean \"Lord of Battles,\" because  \"cup\" and \"lord\" have nearly the same sound _neb_, and \"anvils\" and  \"battles\" have nearly the same sound _meshe_.    In this reign Pantonus of Athens, a Stoic philosopher, held the first  place among the Christians of Alexandria. He is celebrated for uniting  the study of heathen learning with a religious zeal which led him to  preach Christianity in Abyssinia.    [Illustration: 135.jpg HIEROGLYPHIC, HIERATIC, AND DEMOTIC WRITING]    He introduced a taste for philosophy among the Christians; and, though  Athenagoras rather deserves that honour, he was called the founder  of the catechetical school which gave birth to the series of learned  Christian writers that flourished in Alexandria for the next century. To  have been a learned man and a Christian, and to have encouraged learning  among the catechists in his schools may seem deserving of no great  praise. Was the religion of Jesus to spread ignorance and darkness over  the world? But we must remember that a new religion cannot be introduced  without some danger that learning and science may get forbidden,  together with the ancient superstitions which had been taught in the  same schools; we shall hereafter see that in the quarrels between pagans  and Christians, and again between the several sects of Christians,  learning was often reproached with being unfavourable to true religion;  and then it will be granted that it was no small merit to have founded  a school in which learning and Christianity went hand in hand for nearly  two centuries. Pantaenus has left no writings of his own, and is best  known through his pupil or fellow-student, Clemens. He is said to have  brought with him to Alexandria, from the Jewish Christians that he met  with on his travels, a copy of St. Matthew's Gospel in the original  Hebrew, a work now unfortunately lost, which, if we possessed it, would  settle for us the disputed point, whether or no it contained all that  now bears that Apostle's name in the Greek translation.    The learned, industrious, and pious Clemens, who, to distinguish him  from Clemens of Rome, is usually called Clemens Alexandrinus, succeeded  Pantaenus in the catechetical school, and was at the same time a  voluminous writer. He was in his philosophy a platonist, though  sometimes called of the Eclectic school. He has left an Address to the  Gentiles, a treatise on Christian behaviour called Pedagogus, and eight  books of Stromata, or _collections_, which he wrote to describe the  perfect Christian or Gnostic, to furnish the believer with a model for  his imitation, and to save him from being led astray by the sects of  Gnostics \"falsely so called.\" By his advice, and by the imitation of  Christ, the Christian is to step forward from faith, through love, to  knowledge; from being a slave, he is to become a faithful servant and  then a son; he is to become at last a god walking in the flesh.    Clemens was not wholly free from the mysticism which was the chief mark  of the Gnostic sect. He thought much of the sacred power of numbers.  Abraham had three hundred and eighteen servants when he rescued Lot,  which, when written in Greek numerals thus, IHT formed the sacred sign  for the name of Jesus. Ten was a perfect number, and is that of the  commandments given to Moses. Seven was a glorious number, and there  are seven Pleiades, seven planets, seven days in the week; and the  two fishes and five barley loaves, with which the multitude were  miraculously fed, together make the number of years of plenty in Egypt  under Joseph. Clemens also quotes several lines in praise of the seventh  day, which he says were from Homer, Hesiod, and Callimachus; but here  there is reason to believe that he was deceived by the pious fraud of  some zealous Jew or Christian, as no such lines are now to be found in  the pagan poets.    During the reign of Pertinax, which lasted only three months (194 A.D.),  we find no trace of his power in Egypt, except the money which the  Alexandrians coined in his name. It seems to have been the duty of the  prefect of the mint, as soon as he heard of an emperor's death, to lose  no time in issuing coins in the name of his successor. It was one of the  means to proclaim and secure the allegiance of the province for the new  emperor.    During the reign of Commodus, Pescennius Niger had been at the head of  the legion that was employed in Upper Egypt in stopping the inroads of  their troublesome neighbours, who already sometimes bore the name of  Saracens. He was a hardy soldier, and strict in his discipline, while he  shared the labours of the field and of the camp with the men under him.  He would not allow them the use of wine; and once, when the troops that  guarded the frontier at Syene (Aswan) sent to ask for it, he bluntly  answered, \"You have got the Nile to drink, and cannot possibly want  more.\" Once, when a cohort had been routed by the Saracens, the men  complained that they could not fight without wine; but he would not  relax in his discipline. \"Those who have just now beaten you,\" said  Niger, \"drink nothing but water.\" He gained the love and thanks of the  people of Upper Egypt by thus bridling the lawlessness of the troops;  and they gave him his statue cut in black basalt, in allusion to his  name Niger. This statue was placed in his Roman villa.    [Illustration: 138b.jpg A NATIVE OF ASWAN]    But on the death of Pertinax, when Septimus Severus declared himself  emperor in Pannonia, Niger, who was then in the province of Syria, did  the same. Egypt and the Egyptian legions readily and heartily joined  his party, which made it unnecessary for him to stay in that part of  the empire; so he marched upon Greece, Thrace, and Macedonia. But there,  after a few months, he was met by the army of his rival, who also sent  a second army into Egypt; and he was defeated and slain at Cyzicus in  Mysia, after having been acknowledged as emperor in Egypt and Syria for  perhaps a year and a few months.    [Illustration: 139b.jpg PAINTING AT THE ENTRANCE OF THE FIFTH TOMB]    We find no Alexandrian coins of Niger, although we cannot allow a  shorter space of time to his reign than one whole year, together with  a few months of the preceding and following years. Within that time  Severus had to march upon Rome against his first rival, Julian, to  punish the praetorian guards, and afterwards to conquer Niger.    After the death of his rival, when Severus was the undisputed master of  the empire, and was no longer wanted in the other provinces, he found  leisure, in A.D. 196, to visit Egypt; and, like other active-minded  travellers, he examined the pyramids of Memphis and the temples at  Thebes, and laughed at the worship of Serapis and the Egyptian animals.  His visit to Alexandria wras marked by many new laws. Now that the  Greeks of that city, crushed beneath two centuries of foreign rule, had  lost any remains of courage or of pride that could make them feared by  their Roman master, he relaxed part of the strict policy of Augustus. He  gave them a senate and a municipal form of government, a privilege that  had hitherto been refused in distrust to that great city, though freely  granted in other provinces where rebellion was less dreaded. He also  ornamented the city with a temple to Rhea, and with a public bath, which  was named after himself the Bath of Severus.    Severus made a law, says the pagan historian, forbidding anybody, under  a severe punishment, from becoming Jew or Christian. But he who gives  the blow is likely to speak of it more lightly than he who smarts under  it; and we learn from the historian of the Church that, in the tenth  year of this reign, the Christians suffered persecution from their  governors and their fellow-citizens. Among others who then lost their  lives for their religion was Leonides, the father of Origen. He left  seven orphan children, of whom the eldest, that justly celebrated  writer, was only sixteen years old, but was already deeply read in  the Scriptures, and in the great writers of Greece. As the property of  Leonides was forfeited, his children were left in poverty; but the young  Origen was adopted by a wealthy lady, zealous for the new religion,  by whose help he was enabled to continue his studies under Clemens. In  order to read the Old Testament in the original, he made himself master  of Hebrew, which was a study then very unusual among the Greeks, whether  Jews or Christians.    In this persecution of the Church all public worship was forbidden to  the Christians; and Tertullian of Carthage eloquently complains that,  while the emperor allowed the Egyptians"]]]
