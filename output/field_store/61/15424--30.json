Very good.    \"I resume.          VIII      \"When all was finished, Paris came to see the sight. The people flocked  in crowds to those terrible places; no one interfered with them. This  was what the butcher wanted. Louis Bonaparte had not done all this to  hide it afterwards.    \"The southern side of the boulevard was covered with torn cartridge  wads; the sidewalk on the northern side disappeared beneath the mortar  torn from the fronts of the houses by the bullets, and was as white as  if snow had fallen on it; while pools of blood left large dark patches  on that snow of ruins. The foot of the passer-by avoided a corpse only  to tread upon fragments of broken glass, plaster, or stone; some houses  were so riddled by the grape and cannon-balls, that they seemed on the  point of tumbling down; this was the case with M. Sallandrouze's, which  we have already mentioned, and the mourning warehouse at the corner of  Faubourg Montmartre. 'The Billecoq house,' says a witness, 'is, at the  present moment, still propped up by wooden beams, and the front will  have to be partly rebuilt. The balls have made holes in the carpet  warehouse in several places.' Another witness says: 'All the houses  from the Cercle des Etrangers to Rue Poissonniere were literally  riddled with balls, especially on the right-hand side of the boulevard.  One of the large panes of plate glass in the warehouses of _La Petite  Jeannette_ received certainly more than two hundred for its share.  There was not a window that had not its ball. One breathed an  atmosphere of saltpetre. Thirty-seven corpses were heaped up in the  Cite Bergere; the passers-by could count them through the iron  railings. A woman was standing at the corner of Rue Richelieu. She was  looking on. Suddenly she felt that her feet were wet. 'Why, has it been  raining?' she said, 'my feet are in the water.'--'No, madame,' replied  a person who was passing, 'it is not water.'--Her feet were in a pool  of blood.    \"On Rue Grange-Bateliere three corpses were seen in a corner, quite  naked.    \"During the butchery, the barricades on the boulevards had been carried  by Bourgon's brigade. The corpses of those who had defended the  barricade at Porte Saint-Denis, of which we have already spoken at the  beginning of our narrative, were piled up before the door of the Maison  Jouvin. 'But,' says a witness, 'they were nothing compared to the heaps  which covered the boulevard.'    \"About two paces from the Theatre des Varietes, the crowd stopped to  look at a cap full of brains and blood, hung upon a tree.    \"A witness says: 'A little beyond the Varietes, I came to a corpse  lying on the ground with its face downwards; I tried to raise it, aided  by others, but we were repelled by the soldiers. A little farther on,  there were two bodies, a man and a woman; then one alone, a workman'  (we abridge the account). 'From Rue Montmartre to Rue du Sentier _one  literally walked in blood_; at certain spots, it covered the sidewalk  some inches deep, and, without exaggeration, one was obliged to use the  greatest caution not to step into it. I counted there thirty-three  corpses. The sight was too much for me: I felt great tears rolling down  my cheeks. I asked leave to cross the road, in order to enter my own  house, and my request was _granted as a favour_!'    \"Another witness says: 'The boulevard presented a horrible sight. _We  literally walked in blood._ We counted eighteen corpses in about five  and twenty paces.'    \"Another witness, the keeper of a wine-shop on Rue du Sentier, says: 'I  went along Boulevard du Temple to my house. When I got home, I had an  inch of blood around the bottom of my trousers.'    \"Representative Versigny has this to say: 'We could see, in the  distance, almost as far as Porte Saint-Denis, the immense bivouac-fires  of the infantry. The light from them, with the exception of that from a  few rare lamps, was all we had to guide us amid that horrible carnage.  The fighting in the daytime was nothing compared to those corpses and  that silence. R. and I were half-dead with horror. A man was passing  us; hearing one of my exclamations, he came up to me, took my hand, and  said: \"You are a republican; and I was what is called a friend of  order, a reactionary, but one must be forsaken of God, not to execrate  this horrible orgy. France is dishonoured.\" And he left us, sobbing.'    \"Another witness, who allows us to give his name, a Legitimist, the  honourable Monsieur de Cherville, deposes as follows: 'In the evening,  I determined on continuing my sad inspection. On Rue Le Peletier I met  Messieurs Bouillon and Gervais (of Caen). We walked a few steps  together, when my foot slipped. I clung to M. Bouillon. I looked at my  feet. I had walked into a large pool of blood. M. Bouillon then  informed me, that, being at his window, in the morning, he saw a  druggist, whose shop he pointed out to me, shutting his door. A woman  fell; the druggist rushed forward to raise her; at the same moment, a  soldier, ten paces off, aimed at him and lodged a bullet in his head.  Overcome with wrath, and forgetting his own danger, M. Bouillon  exclaimed to the passers-by: \"You will all bear witness to what has  taken place.\"'    \"About eleven o'clock at night, when the fires of the bivouacs were  everywhere lighted, M. Bonaparte allowed the troops to amuse  themselves. It was like a _fete-de-nuit_ on the boulevards. The  soldiers laughed and sang, as they threw into the fire the debris of  the barricades. After this, as at Strasbourg and Boulogne, money was  distributed among them. Let us hear what a witness says: 'I saw, at  Porte Saint-Denis, a staff-officer give two hundred francs to the chief  of a detachment of twenty men, with these words: \"The prince ordered me  to give you this money, to be distributed among your brave soldiers!  the marks of his satisfaction will not be confined to this.\"--Each  soldier received ten francs.'    \"On the evening of the battle of Austerlitz, the Emperor said:  'Soldiers, I am content with you.'    \"Another person adds: 'The soldiers, with cigars in their mouths,  twitted the passers-by and jingled the money in their pockets.' Another  says: 'The officers broke the rolls of louis d'or _like sticks of  chocolate_.'    \"The sentinels allowed only women to pass; whenever a man made his  appearance, they cried: 'Be off!' Tables were spread in the bivouacs,  and officers and soldiers drank around them. The flame of the braziers  was reflected on all those merry faces. The corks and capsules of the  champagne bottles floated on the red torrents of blood. From bivouac to  bivouac the soldiers exchanged loud cries and obscene jokes. They  saluted one another with: 'Long live the grenadiers!' 'Long live the  lancers!' and all joined in, 'Long live Louis-Napoleon!' One heard the  clinking of glasses, and the crash of broken bottles. Here and there,  in the shadow, women, with a taper of yellow wax or a lantern in their  hands, prowled among the dead bodies, gazing at those pale faces, one  after another, and seeking a son, a father, or a husband.          IX      \"Let us hasten to have done with these ghastly details.    \"The next day, the fifth, something terrible was seen in the cemetery  of Montmartre.    \"An immense space, the exact location of which is unknown to this day,  was 'utilized' for the temporary interment of some of those who had  been massacred. They were buried with their heads above ground, in  order that their relations might recognize them. Most of them had also  their feet above ground, with a little earth upon their breasts. The  crowd flocked to the spot, the sightseers pushed one here and there,  they wandered about among the graves, and, at times, one felt the earth  giving way beneath one's feet: one was walking on the stomach of a  corpse. One turned and beheld a pair of boots, of sabots, or of women's  shoes; while on the other side was the head, which the pressure on the  body caused to move.    \"An illustrious witness, the great sculptor David, who is now  proscribed and wandering far from France, says:--    \"'In the cemetery of Montmartre, I saw about forty bodies with their  clothes still on them; they had been placed side by side and a few  shovelfuls of earth hid all except their heads, which had been left  uncovered in order that they might be recognized by their relations.  There was so little earth that their feet were still visible; the  crowd, horrible to say, was walking on their bodies.

Early enrollment  figures suggested they would not. Between July 1941, when the schools  opened, and October 1941, only seventeen out of the 1,997 students  enrolled in candidate schools were Negroes. Only six more Negroes  entered during the next two months.[2-90]                       [Footnote 2-90: Eleven of these were candidates at                     the Infantry School, 2 at the Field Artillery                     School, 7 at the Quartermaster School, and 1 each                     at the Cavalry, Ordnance, and Finance Schools.

Even  before the schools opened, Judge Hastie warned Secretary Stimson that  any effective integration plan \"required a directive to Corps Area  Commanders indicating that Negroes are to be selected in numbers  exactly or approximately indicated for particular schools.\"[2-91] But  the planners had recommended the integrated schools precisely to avoid  a quota system. They were haunted by the Army's 1917 experience,  although the chief of the Army staff's Organizations Division did not  allude to these misgivings when he answered Judge Hastie. He argued  that a quota could not be defended on any grounds \"except those of a  political nature\" and would be \"race discrimination against the  whites.\"[2-92]                       [Footnote 2-91: Ltr, Hastie to SW, 8 May 41, ASW                     291.2 NT.]                       [Footnote 2-92: Memo, ACofS, G-3, for CofS, 12 May                     41, sub: Negro Officers; Memo, ACofS, G-3, for                     ACofS, G-1 (ATTN: Col Wharton), 12 Jun 41, same                     sub. Both in WDGOT 291.2.]    General Marshall agreed that racial parity could not be achieved at  the expense of commissioning unqualified men, but he was equally  adamant about providing equal opportunity for all qualified  candidates, black and white. He won support for his position from some  of the civil rights advocates.[2-93] These arguments may not have swayed  Hastie, but in the end he dropped the idea of a regular quota system,  judging it unworkable in the case of the officer candidate schools. He  concluded that many commanders approached the selection of officer  candidates with a bias against the Negro, and he recommended that a  directive or confidential memorandum be sent to commanders charged  with the selection of officer candidates informing them that a certain  minimum percentage of black candidates was to be chosen. Hastie's  recommendation was ignored, but the widespread refusal of local  commanders to approve or transmit applications of Negroes, or even to  give them access to appropriate forms, halted when Secretary Stimson  and the Army staff made it plain that they expected substantial  numbers of Negroes to be sent to the schools.[2-94]                       [Footnote 2-93: Pogue, _Organizer of Victory_, p.                     96.]                       [Footnote 2-94: Memo, Hastie for ASW, 5 Sep 41,                     G-1/15640-120; Ltr, Hastie to Nichols, 15 Jul 53;                     Tab C to AG 320.2 (11-24-42).]    The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People  meanwhile moved quickly to prove that the demand for a return to  segregated schools, made by Edgar G. Brown, president of the United  States Government Employees, and broadcaster Fulton Lewis, Jr.,  enjoyed little backing in the black community. \"We respectfully  submit,\" Walter White informed Stimson and Roosevelt, \"that no leader  considered responsible by intelligent Negro or white Americans would  make such a request.\"[2-95] In support of its stand the NAACP issued a  statement signed by many influential black leaders.

A group of Florida congressmen, for  example, protested to the Army against the establishment of an  integrated Air Corps school at Miami Beach. The War Department  received numerous complaints when living quarters at the schools were  integrated. The president of the White Supremacy League complained  that young white candidates at Fort Benning \"have to eat and sleep  with Negro candidates,\" calling it \"the most damnable outrage that was  ever perpetrated on the youth of the South.\" To all such complaints  the War Department answered that separation was not always possible  because of the small number of Negroes involved.[2-96]                       [Footnote 2-96: Ltr, Horace Wilkinson to Rep. John J.                     Sparkman (Alabama), 24 Aug 43; Ltr, TAG to Rep.                     John Starnes (Alabama), 15 Sep 43. Both in AG 095                     (Wilkinson) (28 Aug 43). See also Interv, Nichols                     with Ulysses Lee, 1953.]    In answering these complaints the Army developed its ultimate  justification for integrated officer schools: integration was  necessary on the grounds of efficiency and economy. As one Army  spokesman put it, \"our objection to separate schools is based      (p. 051)  primarily on the fact that black officer candidates are eligible  from every branch of the Army, including the Armored Force and tank  destroyer battalions, and it would be decidedly uneconomical to  attempt to gather in one school the materiel and instructor personnel  necessary to give training in all these branches.\"[2-97]                       [Footnote 2-97: Ltr, SGS to Sen. Carl Hayden                     (Arizona), 12 Dec 41, AG 352 (12-12-41).

Many blacks and whites lived together with a minimum of  friction, and, except in flight school, all candidates trained  together.[2-98] Yet in some schools the number of black officer  candidates made racially separate rooms feasible, and Negroes were  usually billeted and messed together. In other instances Army  organizations were slow to integrate their officer training. The  Women's Army Auxiliary Corps, for example, segregated black candidates  until late 1942 when Judge Hastie brought the matter to McCloy's  attention.[2-99] Nevertheless, the Army's experiment was far more  important than its immediate results indicated. It proved that even in  the face of considerable opposition the Army was willing to abandon  its segregation policy when the issues of economy and efficiency were  made sufficiently clear and compelling.                       [Footnote 2-98: Dollard and Young, \"In the Armed                     Forces.\"]                       [Footnote 2-99: Memos, Hastie for ASW, 4 Nov 42 and                     15 Dec 42; Ltr, Maj Gen A.

All in ASW                     291.2 NT (12-2-42).]    The Army's second experiment with integration came in part from the  need for infantry replacements during the Allied advance across  Western Europe in the summer and fall of 1944.[2-100] The Ground Force  Replacement Command had been for some time converting soldiers from  service units to infantry, and even as the Germans launched their  counterattack in the Ardennes the command was drawing up plans to  release thousands of soldiers in Lt. Gen. John C. H. Lee's  Communications Zone and train them"]]]
