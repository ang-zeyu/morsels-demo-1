This Governor must have been a  student of military science; he was utterly astounded when he heard that  this pirate leader, with less than four hundred men, had captured the  redoubtable town of Porto Bello, defended by a strong garrison and  inhabited by citizens who were brave and accustomed to fighting, and,  being anxious to increase his knowledge of improved methods of warfare,  he sent a messenger to Morgan \"desiring him to send him some small  pattern of those arms wherewith he had taken with such violence so great  a city.\" The pirate leader received the messenger with much courtesy,  and sent to the Governor a pistol and a few balls, \"desiring him to  accept that slender pattern of the arms wherewith he had taken Porto  Bello, and keep them for a twelvemonth; after which time he promised to  come to Panama and fetch them away.\"    This courteous correspondence was continued by the Governor returning  the pistol and balls with thanks, and also sending Morgan a handsome  gold ring with the message that he need not trouble himself to come to  Panama; for, if he did, he would meet with very different fortune from  that which had come to him at Porto Bello.    Morgan put the ring on his finger and postponed his reply, and, as soon  as the ransom was paid, he put his booty on board his ships and  departed. When the spoils of Porto Bello came to be counted, it was  found that they were of great value, and each man received a lordly  share.    When Captain Morgan was ready to set out on another expedition, he found  plenty of pirates ready to join him, and he commanded all the ships and  men whom he enlisted to rendezvous at a place called the Isle of Cows. A  fine, large, English ship had recently come to Jamaica from New England,  and this vessel also joined Morgan's forces on the island, where the  pirate leader took this ship as his own, being much the best and largest  vessel of the fleet.    Besides the ships belonging to Morgan, there was in the harbor where  they were now congregated, a fine vessel belonging to some French  buccaneers, and Morgan desired very much that this vessel should join  his fleet, but the French cherished hard feelings against the English,  and would not join them.    Although Morgan was a brave man, his meanness was quite equal to his  courage, and he determined to be revenged upon these Frenchmen who had  refused to give him their aid, and therefore played a malicious trick  upon them. Sometime before, this French vessel, being out of provisions  when upon the high seas, had met an English ship, and had taken from her  such supplies as it had needed. The captain did not pay for these, being  out of money as well as food, not an uncommon thing among buccaneers,  but they gave the English notes of exchange payable in Jamaica; but as  these notes were never honored, the people of the English ship had never  been paid for their provisions.    This affair properly arranged in Morgan's mind, he sent a very polite  note to the captain of the French ship and some of his officers,  inviting them to dine with him on his own vessel. The French accepted  the invitation, but when Morgan received them on board his ship he did  not conduct them down to dinner; instead of that, he began to upbraid  them for the manner in which they had treated an English crew, and then  he ordered them to be taken down below and imprisoned in the hold.  Having accomplished this, and feeling greatly elated by this piece of  sly vengeance, he went into his fine cabin, and he and his officers sat  down to the grand feast he had prepared.    There were fine times on board this great English ship; the pirates were  about to set forth on an important expedition, and they celebrated the  occasion by eating and drinking, firing guns, and all manner of riotous  hilarity. In the midst of the wild festivities--and nobody knew how it  happened--a spark of fire got into the powder magazine, and the ship  blew up, sending the lifeless bodies of three hundred English sailors,  and the French prisoners, high into the air. The only persons on board  who escaped were Morgan and his officers who were in the cabin close to  the stern of the vessel, at some distance from the magazine.    This terrible accident threw the pirate fleet into great confusion for a  time; but Morgan soon recovered himself, and, casting about to see what  was the best thing to be done, it came into his head that he would act  the part of the wolf in the fable of the wolf and the lamb. As there  was no way of finding out how the magazine happened to explode, he took  the ground that the French prisoners whom he had shut up in the hold,  had thrown a lighted match into the magazine, wishing thus to revenge  themselves even though they should, at the same time, lose their own  lives. The people of the French ship bitterly opposed any such view of  the case, but their protestations were of no use; they might declare as  much as they pleased that it was impossible for them to make the waters  muddy, being lower down in the stream than the wolfish pirate who was  accusing them, but it availed nothing. Morgan sprang upon them and their  ship, and sent them to Jamaica, where, upon his false charge, they were  shut up in prison, and so remained for a long time.    Such atrocious wickedness as the treatment of the nuns and monks,  described in this chapter, would never have been countenanced in any  warfare between civilized nations. But Morgan's pirates were not making  war; they were robbers and murderers on a grand scale. They had no right  to call themselves civilized; they were worse than barbarians.    [Illustration: \"Morgan began to upbraid them, and ordered them taken  below.\"--p. 151.]          Chapter XVIII    A Piratical Aftermath      Morgan's destination was the isle of Savona, near which a great Spanish  fleet was expected to pass, and here he hoped to make some rich prizes.  But when he got out to sea he met with contrary and dangerous winds,  which delayed him a long time, and eventually when he arrived at Savona,  after having landed at various places, where he pillaged, murdered, and  burned, according to the extent of his opportunities, he found at least  one-half of his men and ships had not arrived. With the small force  which he now had with him he could not set out to attack a Spanish  fleet, and therefore he was glad to accept the suggestion made to him by  a Frenchman who happened to be in his company.    This man had been with L'Olonnois two years before when that bloody  pirate had sacked the towns of Maracaibo and Gibraltar; he had made  himself perfectly familiar with the fortifications and defences of these  towns, and he told Morgan that it would be easy to take them. To be  sure they had been thoroughly sacked before, and therefore did not offer  the tempting inducements of perfectly fresh towns, such as  Port-au-Prince, but still in two years the inhabitants must have  gathered together some possessions desirable to pirates, and therefore,  although Morgan could not go to these towns with the expectation of  reaping a full harvest, he might at least gather up an aftermath which  would pay him for his trouble.    So away sailed this horde of ravenous scoundrels for the lake of  Maracaibo, at the outer end of which lay the town of Maracaibo, and at  the other extremity the town of Gibraltar. When they had sailed near  enough to the fortifications they anchored out of sight of the  watch-tower and, landing in the night, marched on one of the forts. Here  the career of Morgan came very near closing forever. The Spaniards had  discovered the approach of the pirates, and this fort had been converted  into a great trap in which the citizens hoped to capture and destroy the  pirate leader and his men. Everybody had left the fort, the gates were  open, and a slow-match, communicating with the magazine, had been  lighted just before the last Spaniard had left.    But the oldest and most sagacious of rats would be no more difficult to  entrap than was the wily pirate Morgan. When he entered the open gates  of the fort and found everything in perfect order, he suspected a trick,  and looking about him he soon saw the smouldering match. Instantly he  made a dash at it, seized it and extinguished the fire. Had he been  delayed in this discovery a quarter of an hour longer, he and his men  would have been blown to pieces along with the fort.    Now the pirates pressed on toward the town, but they met with no  resistance. The Spaniards, having failed to blow up their dreaded  enemies, had retreated into the surrounding country and had left the  town. The triumphant pirates spread themselves everywhere. They searched  the abandoned town for people and valuables, and every man who cared to  do so took one of the empty houses for his private residence. They made  the church the common meeting-place where they might all gather together  when it was necessary, and when they had spent the night in eating and  drinking all the good things they could find, they set out the next day  to hunt for the fugitive citizens.    For three weeks Morgan and his men held a devil's carnival in Maracaibo.  To tell of the abominable tortures and cruelties which they inflicted  upon the poor people, whom they dragged from their hiding-places in the  surrounding country, would make our flesh creep and our blood run cold.  When they could do no more evil they sailed away up the lake for  Gibraltar.    It is not necessary to tell the story of the taking of this town. When  Morgan arrived there he found it also entirely deserted. The awful dread  of the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/172"],[0,"The Haunted Bookshop (#20)"],[1,"his hip pocket.  What a different aspect a little hot supper gives to affairs!  The most  resolute idealist or assassin had better write his poems or plan his  atrocities before the evening meal.  After the narcosis of that repast  the spirit falls into a softer mood, eager only to be amused.  Even  Milton would hardly have had the inhuman fortitude to sit down to the  manuscript of Paradise Lost right after supper.  Aubrey began to wonder  if his unpleasant suspicions had not been overdrawn.  He thought how  delightful it would be to stop in at the bookshop and ask Titania to go  to the movies with him.    Curious magic of thought!  The idea was still sparkling in his mind  when he saw Titania and Mrs. Mifflin emerge from the bookshop and pass  briskly in front of the lunchroom.  They were talking and laughing  merrily.  Titania's face, shining with young vitality, seemed to him  more \"attention-compelling\" than any ten-point Caslon type-arrangement  he had ever seen.  He admired the layout of her face from the  standpoint of his cherished technique.  \"Just enough 'white space,'\" he  thought, \"to set off her eyes as the 'centre of interest.' Her features  aren't this modern bold-face stuff, set solid,\" he said to himself,  thinking typographically.  \"They're rather French old-style italic,  slightly leaded.  Set on 22-point body, I guess.  Old man Chapman's a  pretty good typefounder, you have to hand it to him.\"    He smiled at this conceit, seized hat and coat, and dashed out of the  lunchroom.    Mrs. Mifflin and Titania had halted a few yards up the street, and were  looking at some pert little bonnets in a window.  Aubrey hurried across  the street, ran up to the next corner, recrossed, and walked down the  eastern pavement.  In this way he would meet them as though he were  coming from the subway.  He felt rather more excited than King Albert  re-entering Brussels.  He saw them coming, chattering together in the  delightful fashion of women out on a spree.  Helen seemed much younger  in the company of her companion.  \"A lining of pussy-willow taffeta and  an embroidered slip-on,\" she was saying.    Aubrey steered onto them with an admirable gesture of surprise.    \"Well, I never!\" said Mrs. Mifflin.  \"Here's Mr. Gilbert.  Were you  coming to see Roger?\" she added, rather enjoying the young man's  predicament.    Titania shook hands cordially.  Aubrey, searching the old-style italics  with the desperate intensity of a proof-reader, saw no evidence of  chagrin at seeing him again so soon.    \"Why,\" he said rather lamely, \"I was coming to see you all.  I--I  wondered how you were getting along.\"    Mrs. Mifflin had pity on him.  \"We've left Mr. Mifflin to look after  the shop,\" she said.  \"He's busy with some of his old crony customers.  Why don't you come with us to the movies?\"    \"Yes, do,\" said Titania.  \"It's Mr. and Mrs. Sidney Drew, you know how  adorable they are!\"    No one needs to be told how quickly Aubrey assented.  Pleasure  coincided with duty in that the outer wing of the party placed him next  to Titania.    \"Well, how do you like bookselling?\" he asked.    \"Oh, it's the greatest fun!\" she cried.  \"But it'll take me ever and  ever so long to learn about all the books.  People ask such questions!  A woman came in this afternoon looking for a copy of Blase Tales.  How  was I to know she wanted The Blazed Trail?\"    \"You'll get used to that,\" said Mrs. Mifflin.  \"Just a minute, people,  I want to stop in at the drug store.\"    They went into Weintraub's pharmacy.  Entranced as he was by the  proximity of Miss Chapman, Aubrey noticed that the druggist eyed him  rather queerly.  And being of a noticing habit, he also observed that  when Weintraub had occasion to write out a label for a box of powdered  alum Mrs. Mifflin was buying, he did so with a pale violet ink.    At the glass sentry-box in front of the theatre Aubrey insisted on  buying the tickets.    \"We came out right after supper,\" said Titania as they entered, \"so as  to get in before the crowd.\"    It is not so easy, however, to get ahead of Brooklyn movie fans.  They  had to stand for several minutes in a packed lobby while a stern young  man held the waiting crowd in check with a velvet rope.  Aubrey  sustained delightful spasms of the protective instinct in trying to  shelter Titania from buffets and pushings.  Unknown to her, his arm  extended behind her like an iron rod to absorb the onward impulses of  the eager throng.  A rustling groan ran through these enthusiasts as  they saw the preliminary footage of the great Tarzan flash onto the  screen, and realized they were missing something.  At last, however,  the trio got through the barrier and found three seats well in front,  at one side.  From this angle the flying pictures were strangely  distorted, but Aubrey did not mind.    \"Isn't it lucky I got here when I did,\" whispered Titania.  \"Mr.  Mifflin has just had a telephone call from Philadelphia asking him to  go over on Monday to make an estimate on a library that's going to be  sold so I'll be able to look after the shop for him while he's gone.\"    \"Is that so?\" said Aubrey.  \"Well, now, I've got to be in Brooklyn on  Monday, on business.  Maybe Mrs. Mifflin would let me come in and buy  some books from you.\"    \"Customers always welcome,\" said Mrs. Mifflin.    \"I've taken a fancy to that Cromwell book,\" said Aubrey.  \"What do you  suppose Mr. Mifflin would sell it for?\"    \"I think that book must be valuable,\" said Titania.  \"Somebody came in  this afternoon and wanted to buy it, but Mr. Mifflin wouldn't part with  it.  He says it's one of his favourites.  Gracious, what a weird film  this is!\"    The fantastic absurdities of Tarzan proceeded on the screen, tearing  celluloid passions to tatters, but Aubrey found the strong man of the  jungle coming almost too close to his own imperious instincts.  Was not  he, too--he thought naively--a poor Tarzan of the advertising jungle,  lost among the elephants and alligators of commerce, and sighing for  this dainty and unattainable vision of girlhood that had burst upon his  burning gaze!  He stole a perilous side-glance at her profile, and saw  the racing flicker of the screen reflected in tiny spangles of light  that danced in her eyes.  He was even so unknowing as to imagine that  she was not aware of his contemplation.  And then the lights went up.    \"What nonsense, wasn't it?\" said Titania.  \"I'm so glad it's over!  I  was quite afraid one of those elephants would walk off the screen and  tread on us.\"    \"I never can understand,\" said Helen, \"why they don't film some of the  really good books--think of Frank Stockton's stuff, how delightful that  would be.  Can't you imagine Mr. and Mrs. Drew playing in Rudder  Grange!\"    \"Thank goodness!\" said Titania.  \"Since I entered the book business,  that's the first time anybody's mentioned a book that I've read.  Yes--do you remember when Pomona and Jonas visit an insane asylum on  their honeymoon?  Do you know, you and Mr. Mifflin remind me a little  of Mr. and Mrs. Drew.\"    Helen and Aubrey chuckled at this innocent correlation of ideas.  Then  the organ began to play \"O How I Hate To Get Up in the Morning\" and the  ever-delightful Mr. and Mrs. Drew appeared on the screen in one of  their domestic comedies.  Lovers of the movies may well date a new  screen era from the day those whimsical pantomimers set their wholesome  and humane talent at the service of the arc light and the lens.  Aubrey  felt a serene and intimate pleasure in watching them from a seat beside  Titania.  He knew that the breakfast table scene shadowed before them  was only a makeshift section of lath propped up in some barnlike motion  picture studio; yet his rocketing fancy imagined it as some arcadian  suburb where he and Titania, by a jugglery of benign fate, were  bungalowed together.  Young men have a pioneering imagination: it is  doubtful whether any young Orlando ever found himself side by side with  Rosalind without dreaming himself wedded to her.  If men die a thousand  deaths before this mortal coil is shuffled, even so surely do youths  contract a thousand marriages before they go to the City Hall for a  license.    Aubrey remembered the opera glasses, which were still in his pocket,  and brought them out.  The trio amused themselves by watching Sidney  Drew's face through the magnifying lenses.  They were disappointed in  the result, however, as the pictures, when so enlarged, revealed all  the cobweb of fine cracks on the film.  Mr. Drew's nose, the most  amusing feature known to the movies, lost its quaintness when so  augmented.    \"Why,\" cried Titania, \"it makes his lovely nose look like the map of  Florida.\"    \"How on earth did you happen to have these in your pocket?\" asked Mrs.  Mifflin, returning the glasses.    Aubrey was hard pressed for a prompt and reasonable fib, but  advertising men are resourceful.    \"Oh,\" he said, \"I sometimes carry them with me at night to study the  advertising sky-signs.  I'm a little short sighted.  You see, it's part  of my business to study the technique of the electric signs.\"    After some current event pictures the programme prepared to repeat  itself, and they went out.  \"Will you come in and have some cocoa with  us?\" said Helen as they reached the door of the bookshop.  Aubrey was  eager enough to accept, but feared to overplay his hand.  \"I'm sorry,\"  he said, \"but I think I'd better not.  I've got some work to do  to-night.  Perhaps I can drop in on Monday when Mr. Mifflin's away, and  put coal on the furnace for you, or something of that sort?\"    Mrs. Mifflin laughed.  \"Surely!\" she said.  \"You're welcome any time.\"  The door closed behind them, and Aubrey fell into a profound  melancholy.  Deprived of the heavenly rhetoric of her eye, Gissing  Street seemed flat and dull.    It was still early--not quite ten o'clock--and it occurred to Aubrey  that if he was going to patrol"]]]
