The famous German  philosopher, Schopenhauer, dined there regularly for thirty years--from  1831 to 1860, though I cannot advance that as any great recommendation,  for the ways and tastes of philosophers are usually somewhat erratic. I  have no doubt, however, that the cuisine has materially altered since  Schopenhauer's time.    The Frankfurter Hof, built about thirty years ago, is a larger  establishment with all the modern improvements. It is much frequented by  Englishmen and Americans, but rather lacks the quiet of the Angleterre.  It has a good cuisine, for M. Ritz, who has an interest in the hotel,  has seen to that, and magnificent reception rooms where many balls,  parties, weddings, etc., take place. A band plays there during the  greater part of the day, and it is advisable to get as far distant as  possible from it when dining. In the restaurant one can obtain _a la  carte_ a very excellently cooked dinner.    The Palast Hotel Furstenhof is of the highest class and was only  recently opened. It has beautifully decorated rooms, a good restaurant,  a dining-hall, and an excellent American bar. Herr Schill the former  head waiter of the Englischer Hof--his _nom de guerre_ is Mons.  Jules--assiduously sees to the comfort and welfare of his guests. Like  Mons. Ritz he has a large following of friends.    The Hotel Imperial was opened about two years ago, and although a little  smaller than the Frankfurter Hof or the Palast has a most aristocratic  _clientele_. Being close to the Opera House, its restaurant is much  patronised in the season by people who during the _entr'acte_, or to  pass over a more or less tedious act, prefer to partake of light  refreshments and a cigarette on the terrace in the open air. There is an  American bar there also. The _elite_ of Frankfurt, on the rare occasions  when they do sup after going to the theatre or opera, generally order  their meals at one of the restaurants of the leading hotels; but  Frankfurt does not, as a rule, keep late hours.    The Palmen Garten is a pleasant summer restaurant a little way out of  the town, on the Bockenheimerstrasse. It has a fine dining-hall, or you  may sit at _al-fresco_ tables while the regimental band discourses  excellent music. The cooking is good--German cuisine, but nothing high  class. It is a very pleasant spot to visit in the hot weather; on fete  days one is treated there to the luxury of fireworks, etc.    Buerose ought to be mentioned as a quiet restaurant, where there is a  _specialite_ of _hors-d'oeuvre_ and excellent oysters.    Lovers of good beer will find at the Allemania, if they ask for a  Schoppen of the Royal Court Hofbrau, exactly what they have been craving  for; and the Pilsener at the Kaiserhof Restaurant in the Goetheplatz is  equally good. One has to sample several glasses of each before one can  definitely make up one's mind as to which is the best.      Duesseldorf    The best restaurant in Duesseldorf is that of the Park Hotel on the  Corneliusplatz. It is one of the best on the Rhine, and was opened in  April 1902 on the occasion of the Duesseldorf Exhibition; it is a fine  building, and has pretty grounds and ornamental water adjoining it. It  is frequented by the highest German nobility, but yet its prices are  moderate.    Luncheons are served at 3 marks, dinners at 5 marks. Suppers for 3 marks  are served at _prix fixe_, or one can order _a la carte_. The Moselle  wines are exceptionally good. There is an American bar in the hotel. The  restaurant, handsomely decorated in the style of Louis XIV., is opposite  the Opera House and overlooks the Hofgaerten.    It has no specialities in the way of food beyond the usual German and  French dishes.    At the Thuernagel Restaurant, also in the Corneliusplatz, you are likely  to find the artistic colony in session. The restaurant dates back to the  year 1858. There is a good collection of wine in the cellars, and a word  may be said in favour of its cookery.      The Rhine Valley    The Rhine valley is not a happy hunting ground for the gourmet. Cologne  has its picturesque Gurzenich in which is a restaurant; its inhabitants  eat their oysters in the saloon in the Kleine Bugenstrasse, part of a  restaurant there; and there are restaurants in the Marienburg and in the  Stadt garden, and the Flora and Zoological Gardens. At every little town  on either bank there are one or more taverns with a view where the usual  atrocities which pass as food in provincial Germany are to be obtained,  good beer, and generally excellent wine made from the vineyards on the  mountain side. Now and again some restaurant-keeper has a little pool of  fresh water in front of his house, and one can select one's particular  fish to be cooked for breakfast. The wines of the district are far  better than its food.    Rudesheim, Geisenheim, Schloss Johannisberg, the Steinberg Abbey above  Hattenheim, are of course household words, and the man who said that  travelling along the Rhine was like reading a restaurant wine-list had  some justification for his Philistine speech. One does not expect to  discover the real Steinberg Cabinet in a village inn, and the  Johannisberg generally found in every hotel in Rhineland is a very  inferior wine to that of the Schloss, and is grown in the vineyards  round Dorf Johannisberg. I have memories of excellent bottles of wine at  the Ress at Hattenheim, and at the Engel at Erbach; but the fact that I  was making a walking tour may have added to the delight of the draughts.  The Marcobrunn vineyards lie between Hattenheim and Erbach. The Hotel  Victoria at Bingen has its own vineyards and makes a capital wine; and  in the valley of the river below Bingen almost every little town and  hill--Lorch, Boppard, Horcheim, and the Kreuzberg--has its own  particular brand, generally excellent. Assmanhausen, which gives such an  excellent red wine, is on the opposite bank to Bingen and a little below  it. The Rhine boats have a very good assortment of wines on board, but  it is wise to run the finger a little way down the list before ordering  your bottle, for the very cheapest wines on the Rhine are, as is usual  in all countries, of the thinnest description. Most of the British  doctors on the Continent make the greater part of their living by  attending their fellow-countrymen who drink everywhere anything that is  given them free, and who hold that the _vin du pays_ must be drinkable  because it _is_ the wine of the country. Our compatriots often swallow  the throat-cutting stuff which the farm labourers and stable hands  drink, sooner than pay a little extra money for the sound wine of the  district. The foreigner who came to Great Britain and drank our cheapest  ale and rawest whisky would go away with a poor impression of the  liquors of _our_ country. Drink the wine of the district where they make  good wine, but do not grudge the extra shilling which makes all the  difference in quality. The dinners and lunches on the big express Rhine  steamers are a scramble for food; but on some of the smaller and slower  boats, where the caterer has fewer passengers to feed, the meals are  often very good. I have a kindly memory of an old head steward, a  fatherly old gentleman in a silk cap shaped somewhat like an accordion,  who provided the meals on a leisurely steamer which pottered up the  Rhine, stopping at every village. He gave us local delicacies, took an  interest in our appetites, and his cookery, though distinctively German,  was also very good. In a land where all the big hotels fill once a day  and empty once a day, and where the meals are in heavy-handed imitation  of bourgeois French cookery, that old man with his stews and roasts, and  pickles, veal, and pork, sausages big and sausages small, strange  cheeses, and Delikatessen of all kinds was a good man to meet.      German \"Cure\" Places    First of course amongst the places in Germany where men and women mend  their constitutions and enjoy themselves at the same time comes      Homburg    The \"Homburg Dinner\" has become a household word, meaning that a certain  number of men and women agree to dine together at one of the hotels,  each one paying his or her own share in the expenses. During the past  two years, owing to the desire to spend money shown by some  millionaires, British and American, who are not happy unless they are  giving expensive dinners every night with a score of guests, this pretty  old custom seems likely now to die out. In no German town are there  better hotels than at Homburg, and one dines on a warm day in very  pleasant surroundings, for Ritter's has its world-famous terrace, and  some of the other hotels have very delightful open-air restaurants in  their gardens. Simplicity, good plain food well cooked, is insisted on  by the doctors at Homburg, and therefore a typical Homburg dinner is a  very small affair compared to German feasts over which the doctors do  not have control. This is a dinner of the day at Ritter's, taken  haphazard from a little pile of menus, and it may be accepted as a  typical Homburg dinner:--                     Potage Crecy au Riz.      Truite de Lac. Sce. Genevoise. Pommes Natures.              Longe de Veau a la Hongroise.                  Petits pois au Jambon.                Chapons de Chalons rotis.        Salade and Compots. Peches a la Cardinal.                     Fruits. Dessert.    The hotels at Homburg are always quite full in the season. No  hotel-keeper puts any pressure on his guests to dine at his hotel, and  you may have your bedroom in one hotel and dine at another every night  of your life so far as the proprietors care. All those who have the  luck to be made members of the Golf Club take tea there, and eat cake  such as is only to be found at school-treats in England.

We are decidedly not upon the road followed by  Saknussemm. All we have to do is to go back. Let us take one night's  good rest, and before three days are over, I promise you we shall have  regained the point where the galleries divided.\"    \"Yes, we may, if our strength lasts as long,\" I cried, in a lamentable  voice.    \"And why not?\"    \"Tomorrow, among us three, there will not be a drop of water. It is just  gone.\"    \"And your courage with it,\" said my uncle, speaking in a severe tone.    What could I say? I turned round on my side, and from sheer exhaustion  fell into a heavy sleep disturbed by dreams of water! And I awoke  unrefreshed.    I would have bartered a diamond mine for a glass of pure spring water!          CHAPTER 18    THE WRONG ROAD!      Next day, our departure took place at a very early hour. There was no  time for the least delay. According to my account, we had five days'  hard work to get back to the place where the galleries divided.    I can never tell all the sufferings we endured upon our return. My uncle  bore them like a man who has been in the wrong--that is, with  concentrated and suppressed anger; Hans, with all the resignation of his  pacific character; and I--I confess that I did nothing but complain, and  despair. I had no heart for this bad fortune.    But there was one consolation. Defeat at the outset would probably upset  the whole journey!    As I had expected from the first, our supply of water gave completely  out on our first day's march. Our provision of liquids was reduced to  our supply of Schiedam; but this horrible--nay, I will say it--this  infernal liquor burnt the throat, and I could not even bear the sight of  it. I found the temperature to be stifling. I was paralyzed with  fatigue. More than once I was about to fall insensible to the ground.  The whole party then halted, and the worthy Icelander and my excellent  uncle did their best to console and comfort me. I could, however,  plainly see that my uncle was contending painfully against the extreme  fatigues of our journey, and the awful torture generated by the absence  of water.    At length a time came when I ceased to recollect anything--when all was  one awfull hideous, fantastic dream!    At last, on Tuesday, the seventh of the month of July, after crawling on  our hands and knees for many hours, more dead than alive, we reached the  point of junction between the galleries. I lay like a log, an inert mass  of human flesh on the arid lava soil. It was then ten in the morning.    Hans and my uncle, leaning against the wall, tried to nibble away at  some pieces of biscuit, while deep groans and sighs escaped from my  scorched and swollen lips. Then I fell off into a kind of deep lethargy.    Presently I felt my uncle approach, and lift me up tenderly in his arms.    \"Poor boy,\" I heard him say in a tone of deep commiseration.    I was profoundly touched by these words, being by no means accustomed to  signs of womanly weakness in the Professor. I caught his trembling hands  in mine and gave them a gentle pressure. He allowed me to do so without  resistance, looking at me kindly all the time. His eyes were wet with  tears.    I then saw him take the gourd which he wore at his side. To my surprise,  or rather to my stupefaction, he placed it to my lips.    \"Drink, my boy,\" he said.    Was it possible my ears had not deceived me? Was my uncle mad? I looked  at him, with, I am sure, quite an idiotic expression. I could not  believe him. I too much feared the counteraction of disappointment.    \"Drink,\" he said again.    Had I heard aright? Before, however, I could ask myself the question a  second time, a mouthful of water cooled my parched lips and throat--one  mouthful, but I do believe it brought me back to life.    I thanked my uncle by clasping my hands. My heart was too full to speak.    \"Yes,\" said he, \"one mouthful of water, the very last--do you hear, my  boy--the very last! I have taken care of it at the bottom of my bottle  as the apple of my eye. Twenty times, a hundred times, I have resisted  the fearful desire to drink it. But--no--no, Harry, I saved it for you.\"    \"My dear uncle,\" I exclaimed, and the big tears rolled down my hot and  feverish cheeks.    \"Yes, my poor boy, I knew that when you reached this place, this  crossroad in the earth, you would fall down half dead, and I saved my  last drop of water in order to restore you.\"    \"Thanks,\" I cried; \"thanks from my heart.\"    As little as my thirst was really quenched, I had nevertheless partially  recovered my strength. The contracted muscles of my throat relaxed--and  the inflammation of my lips in some measure subsided. At all events, I  was able to speak.    \"Well,\" I said, \"there can be no doubt now as to what we have to do.  Water has utterly failed us; our journey is therefore at an end. Let us  return.\"    While I spoke thus, my uncle evidently avoided my face: he held down his  head; his eyes were turned in every possible direction but the right  one.    \"Yes,\" I continued, getting excited by my own words, \"we must go back to  Sneffels. May heaven give us strength to enable us once more to revisit  the light of day. Would that we now stood on the summit of the crater.\"    \"Go back,\" said my uncle, speaking to himself, \"and must it be so?\"    \"Go back--yes, and without losing a single moment,\" I vehemently cried.    For some moments there was silence under that dark and gloomy vault.    \"So, my dear Harry,\" said the Professor in a very singular tone of  voice, \"those few drops of water have not sufficed to restore your  energy and courage.\"    \"Courage!\" I cried.    \"I see that you are quite as downcast as before--and still give way to  discouragement and despair.\"    What, then, was the man made of, and what other projects were entering  his fertile and audacious brain!    \"You are not discouraged, sir?\"    \"What! Give up just as we are on the verge of success?\" he cried.  \"Never, never shall it be said that Professor Hardwigg retreated.\"    \"Then we must make up our minds to perish,\" I cried with a helpless  sigh.    \"No, Harry, my boy, certainly not. Go, leave me, I am very far from  desiring your death. Take Hans with you. <i>I will go on alone.</i>\"    \"You ask us to leave you?\"    \"Leave me, I say. I have undertaken this dangerous and perilous  adventure. I will carry it to the end--or I will never return to the  surface of Mother Earth. Go, Harry--once more I say to you--go!\"    My uncle as he spoke was terribly excited. His voice, which before had  been tender, almost womanly, became harsh and menacing. He appeared to  be struggling with desperate energy against the impossible. I did not  wish to abandon him at the bottom of that abyss, while, on the other  hand, the instinct of preservation told me to fly.    Meanwhile, our guide was looking on with profound calmness and  indifference. He appeared to be an unconcerned party, and yet he  perfectly well knew what was going on between us. Our gestures  sufficiently indicated the different roads each wished to follow--and  which each tried to influence the other to undertake. But Hans appeared  not to take the slightest interest in what was really a question of life  and death for us all, but waited quite ready to obey the signal which  should say go aloft, or to resume his desperate journey into the  interior of the earth.    How then I wished with all my heart and soul that I could make him  understand my words. My representations, my sighs and groans, the  earnest accents in which I should have spoken would have convinced that  cold, hard nature. Those fearful dangers and perils of which the stolid  guide had no idea, I would have pointed them out to him--I would have,  as it were, made him see and feel. Between us, we might have convinced  the obstinate Professor. If the worst had come to the worst, we could  have compelled him to return to the summit of Sneffels.    I quietly approached Hans. I caught his hand in mine. He never moved a  muscle. I indicated to him the road to the top of the crater. He  remained motionless. My panting form, my haggard countenance, must have  indicated the extent of my sufferings. The Icelander gently shook his  head and pointed to my uncle.    \"Master,\" he said.    The word is Icelandic as well as English.    \"The master!\" I cried, beside myself with fury--\"madman! no--I tell you  he is not the master of our lives; we must fly! we must drag him with  us! do you hear me? Do you understand me, I say?\"    I have already explained that I held Hans by the arm. I tried to make  him rise from his seat. I struggled with him and tried to force him  away. My uncle now interposed.    \"My good Henry, be calm,\" he said. \"You will obtain nothing from my  devoted follower; therefore, listen to what I have to say.\"    I folded my arms, as well as I could, and looked my uncle full in the  face.    \"This wretched want of water,\" he said, \"is the sole obstacle to the  success of my project. In the entire gallery, made of lava, schist, and  coal, it is true we found not one liquid molecule. It is quite possible  that we may be more fortunate in the western tunnel.\"    My sole reply was to shake my head with an air of deep incredulity.    \"Listen to me to the end,\" said the Professor in his well-known  lecturing voice. \"While you lay yonder without life or motion, I  undertook a reconnoitering journey into the conformation of this other  gallery. I have discovered that it goes directly downwards into the  bowels of the earth, and in a few hours will take us to the old granitic  formation. In this we shall undoubtedly find innumerable springs. The  nature of the rock makes this a mathematical certainty, and instinct  agrees with logic to say that it is so. Now, this is the serious  proposition which I have to make to you.
