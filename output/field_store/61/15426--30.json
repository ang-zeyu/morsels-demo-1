In more fruitful countries, the removal of one only makes  room for the succession of another: but in the Hebrides, the loss of an  inhabitant leaves a lasting vacuity; for nobody born in any other parts  of the world will choose this country for his residence, and an Island  once depopulated will remain a desert, as long as the present facility of  travel gives every one, who is discontented and unsettled, the choice of  his abode.    Let it be inquired, whether the first intention of those who are  fluttering on the wing, and collecting a flock that they may take their  flight, be to attain good, or to avoid evil.  If they are dissatisfied  with that part of the globe, which their birth has allotted them, and  resolve not to live without the pleasures of happier climates; if they  long for bright suns, and calm skies, and flowery fields, and fragrant  gardens, I know not by what eloquence they can be persuaded, or by what  offers they can be hired to stay.    But if they are driven from their native country by positive evils, and  disgusted by ill-treatment, real or imaginary, it were fit to remove  their grievances, and quiet their resentment; since, if they have been  hitherto undutiful subjects, they will not much mend their principles by  American conversation.    To allure them into the army, it was thought proper to indulge them in  the continuance of their national dress.  If this concession could have  any effect, it might easily be made.  That dissimilitude of appearance,  which was supposed to keep them distinct from the rest of the nation,  might disincline them from coalescing with the Pensylvanians, or people  of Connecticut.  If the restitution of their arms will reconcile them to  their country, let them have again those weapons, which will not be more  mischievous at home than in the Colonies.  That they may not fly from the  increase of rent, I know not whether the general good does not require  that the landlords be, for a time, restrained in their demands, and kept  quiet by pensions proportionate to their loss.    To hinder insurrection, by driving away the people, and to govern  peaceably, by having no subjects, is an expedient that argues no great  profundity of politicks.  To soften the obdurate, to convince the  mistaken, to mollify the resentful, are worthy of a statesman; but it  affords a legislator little self-applause to consider, that where there  was formerly an insurrection, there is now a wilderness.    It has been a question often agitated without solution, why those  northern regions are now so thinly peopled, which formerly overwhelmed  with their armies the Roman empire.  The question supposes what I believe  is not true, that they had once more inhabitants than they could  maintain, and overflowed only because they were full.    This is to estimate the manners of all countries and ages by our own.  Migration, while the state of life was unsettled, and there was little  communication of intelligence between distant places, was among the  wilder nations of Europe, capricious and casual.  An adventurous  projector heard of a fertile coast unoccupied, and led out a colony; a  chief of renown for bravery, called the young men together, and led them  out to try what fortune would present.  When Caesar was in Gaul, he found  the Helvetians preparing to go they knew not whither, and put a stop to  their motions.  They settled again in their own country, where they were  so far from wanting room, that they had accumulated three years provision  for their march.    The religion of the North was military; if they could not find enemies,  it was their duty to make them: they travelled in quest of danger, and  willingly took the chance of Empire or Death.  If their troops were  numerous, the countries from which they were collected are of vast  extent, and without much exuberance of people great armies may be raised  where every man is a soldier.  But their true numbers were never known.  Those who were conquered by them are their historians, and shame may have  excited them to say, that they were overwhelmed with multitudes.  To  count is a modern practice, the ancient method was to guess; and when  numbers are guessed they are always magnified.    Thus England has for several years been filled with the atchievements of  seventy thousand Highlanders employed in America.  I have heard from an  English officer, not much inclined to favour them, that their behaviour  deserved a very high degree of military praise; but their number has been  much exaggerated.  One of the ministers told me, that seventy thousand  men could not have been found in all the Highlands, and that more than  twelve thousand never took the field.  Those that went to the American  war, went to destruction.  Of the old Highland regiment, consisting of  twelve hundred, only seventy-six survived to see their country again.    The Gothick swarms have at least been multiplied with equal liberality.  That they bore no great proportion to the inhabitants, in whose countries  they settled, is plain from the paucity of northern words now found in  the provincial languages.  Their country was not deserted for want of  room, because it was covered with forests of vast extent; and the first  effect of plenitude of inhabitants is the destruction of wood.  As the  Europeans spread over America the lands are gradually laid naked.    I would not be understood to say, that necessity had never any part in  their expeditions.  A nation, whose agriculture is scanty or unskilful,  may be driven out by famine.  A nation of hunters may have exhausted  their game.  I only affirm that the northern regions were not, when their  irruptions subdued the Romans, overpeopled with regard to their real  extent of territory, and power of fertility.  In a country fully  inhabited, however afterward laid waste, evident marks will remain of its  former populousness.  But of Scandinavia and Germany, nothing is known  but that as we trace their state upwards into antiquity, their woods were  greater, and their cultivated ground was less.    That causes were different from want of room may produce a general  disposition to seek another country is apparent from the present conduct  of the Highlanders, who are in some places ready to threaten a total  secession.  The numbers which have already gone, though like other  numbers they may be magnified, are very great, and such as if they had  gone together and agreed upon any certain settlement, might have founded  an independent government in the depths of the western continent.  Nor  are they only the lowest and most indigent; many men of considerable  wealth have taken with them their train of labourers and dependants; and  if they continue the feudal scheme of polity, may establish new clans in  the other hemisphere.    That the immediate motives of their desertion must be imputed to their  landlords, may be reasonably concluded, because some Lairds of more  prudence and less rapacity have kept their vassals undiminished.  From  Raasa only one man had been seduced, and at Col there was no wish to go  away.    The traveller who comes hither from more opulent countries, to speculate  upon the remains of pastoral life, will not much wonder that a common  Highlander has no strong adherence to his native soil; for of animal  enjoyments, or of physical good, he leaves nothing that he may not find  again wheresoever he may be thrown.    The habitations of men in the Hebrides may be distinguished into huts and  houses.  By a house, I mean a building with one story over another; by a  hut, a dwelling with only one floor.  The Laird, who formerly lived in a  castle, now lives in a house; sometimes sufficiently neat, but seldom  very spacious or splendid.  The Tacksmen and the Ministers have commonly  houses.  Wherever there is a house, the stranger finds a welcome, and to  the other evils of exterminating Tacksmen may be added the unavoidable  cessation of hospitality, or the devolution of too heavy a burden on the  Ministers.    Of the houses little can be said.  They are small, and by the necessity  of accumulating stores, where there are so few opportunities of purchase,  the rooms are very heterogeneously filled.  With want of cleanliness it  were ingratitude to reproach them.  The servants having been bred upon  the naked earth, think every floor clean, and the quick succession of  guests, perhaps not always over-elegant, does not allow much time for  adjusting their apartments.    Huts are of many gradations; from murky dens, to commodious dwellings.    The wall of a common hut is always built without mortar, by a skilful  adaptation of loose stones.  Sometimes perhaps a double wall of stones is  raised, and the intermediate space filled with earth.  The air is thus  completely excluded.  Some walls are, I think, formed of turfs, held  together by a wattle, or texture of twigs.  Of the meanest huts, the  first room is lighted by the entrance, and the second by the smoke hole.  The fire is usually made in the middle.  But there are huts, or dwellings  of only one story, inhabited by gentlemen, which have walls cemented with  mortar, glass windows, and boarded floors.  Of these all have chimneys,  and some chimneys have grates.    The house and the furniture are not always nicely suited.  We were driven  once, by missing a passage, to the hut of a gentleman, where, after a  very liberal supper, when I was conducted to my chamber, I found an  elegant bed of Indian cotton, spread with fine sheets.  The accommodation  was flattering; I undressed myself, and felt my feet in the mire.  The  bed stood upon the bare earth, which a long course of rain had softened  to a puddle.    In pastoral countries the condition of the lowest rank of people is  sufficiently wretched.

The breeze was heavy and smelled of fire, and  the sand was blowing here and there. She had a sense of the bigness,  the openness of this valley, and then she realized its wildness and  strangeness. These lonely, isolated monuments made the place different  from any she had visited. They did not seem mere standing rocks. They  seemed to retreat all the time as she approached, and they watched her.  They interested her, made her curious. What had formed all these  strange monuments? Here the ground was level for miles and miles, to  slope gently up to the bases of these huge rocks. In an old book she  had seen pictures of the Egyptian pyramids, but these appeared vaster,  higher, and stranger, and they were sheerly perpendicular.    Suddenly Sage King halted sharply, shot up his ears, and whistled. Lucy  was startled. That from the King meant something. Hastily, with keen  glance she swept the foreground. A mile on, near the monument, was a  small black spot. It seemed motionless. But the King's whistle had  proved it to be a horse. When Lucy had covered a quarter of the  intervening distance she could distinguish the horse and that there  appeared some thing strange about his position. Lucy urged Sage King  into a lope and soon drew nearer. The black horse had his head down,  yet he did not appear to be grazing. He was as still as a statue. He  stood just outside a clump of greasewood and cactus.    Suddenly a sound pierced the stillness. The King jumped and snorted in  fright. For an instant Lucy's blood ran cold, for it was a horrible  cry. Then she recognized it as the neigh of a horse in agony. She had  heard crippled and dying horses utter that long-drawn and  blood-curdling neigh. The black horse had not moved, so the sound could  not have come from him. Lucy thought Sage King acted more excited than  the occasion called for. Then remembering her father's warning, she  reined in on top of a little knoll, perhaps a hundred yards from where  the black horse stood, and she bent her keen gaze forward.    It was a huge, gaunt, shaggy black horse she saw, with the saddle  farther up on his shoulders than it should have been. He stood  motionless, as if utterly exhausted. His forelegs were braced, so that  he leaned slightly back. Then Lucy saw a rope. It was fast to the  saddle and stretched down into the cactus. There was no other horse in  sight, nor any living thing. The immense monument dominated the scene.  It seemed stupendous to Lucy, sublime, almost frightful.    She hesitated. She knew there was another horse, very likely at the  other end of that lasso. Probably a rider had been thrown, perhaps  killed. Certainly a horse had been hurt. Then on the moment rang out  the same neigh of agony, only weaker and shorter. Lucy no longer feared  an ambush. That was a cry which could not be imitated by a man or  forced from a horse. There was probably death, certainly suffering,  near at hand. She spurred the King on.    There was a little slope to descend, a wash to cross, a bench to  climb--and then she rode up to the black horse. Sage King needed harder  treatment than Lucy had ever given him.    \"What's wrong with you?\" she demanded, pulling him down. Suddenly, as  she felt him tremble, she realized that he was frightened. \"That's  funny!\" Then when she got him quiet she looked around.    The black horse was indeed huge. His mane, his shaggy flanks, were  lathered as if he had been smeared with heavy soap-suds. He raised his  head to look at her. Lucy, accustomed to horses all her life, saw that  this one welcomed her arrival. But he was almost ready to drop.    Two taut lassoes stretched from the pommel of his saddle down a little  into a depression full of brush and cactus and rocks. Then Lucy saw a  red horse. He was down in a bad position. She heard his low, choking  heaves. Probably he had broken legs or back. She could not bear to see  a horse in pain. She would do what was possible, even to the extent of  putting him out of his misery, if nothing else could be done. Yet she  scanned the surroundings closely, and peered into the bushes and behind  the rocks before she tried to urge Sage King closer. He refused to go  nearer, and Lucy dismounted.    The red horse was partly hidden by overbending brush. He had plunged  into a hole full of cactus. There was a hackamore round his nose and a  tight noose round his neck. The one round his neck was also round his  forelegs. And both lassoes were held taut by the black horse. A torn  and soiled rider's scarf hung limp round the red horse's nose, kept  from falling off by the hackamore.    \"A wild horse, a stallion, being broken!\" exclaimed Lucy, instantly  grasping the situation. \"Oh! where's the rider?\"    She gazed around, ran to and fro, glanced down the little slope, and  beyond, but she did not see anything resembling the form of a man. Then  she ran back.    Lucy took another quick look at the red stallion. She did not believe  either his legs or back were hurt. He was just played out and tangled  and tied in the ropes, and could not get up. The shaggy black horse  stood there braced and indomitable. But he, likewise, was almost ready  to drop. Looking at the condition of both horses and the saddle and  ropes, Lucy saw what a fight there had been, and a race! Where was the  rider? Thrown, surely, and back on the trail, perhaps dead or maimed.    Lucy went closer to the stallion so that she could almost touch him. He  saw her. He was nearly choked. Foam and blood wheezed out with his  heaves. She must do something quickly. And in her haste she pricked her  arms and shoulders on the cactus.    She led the black horse closer in, letting the ropes go, slack. The  black seemed as glad of that release as she was. What a faithful brute  he looked! Lucy liked his eyes.    Then she edged down in among the cactus and brush. The red horse no  longer lay in a strained position. He could lift his head. Lucy saw  that the noose still held tight round his neck. Fearlessly she jerked  it loose. Then she backed away, but not quite out of his reach. He  coughed and breathed slowly, with great heaves. Then he snorted.    \"You're all right now,\" said Lucy, soothingly. Slowly she reached a  hand toward his head. He drew it back as far as he could. She stepped  around, closer, and more back of him, and put a hand on him, gently,  for an instant. Then she slipped out of the brush and, untying one  lasso from the pommel, she returned to the horse and pulled it from  round his legs. He was free now, except the hackamore, and that rope  was slack. Lucy stood near him, watching him, talking to him, waiting  for him to get up. She could not be sure he was not badly hurt till he  stood up. At first he made no efforts to rise. He watched Lucy, less  fearfully, she imagined. And she never made a move. She wanted him to  see, to understand that she had not hurt him and would not hurt him. It  began to dawn upon her that he was magnificent.    Finally, with a long, slow heave he got to his feet. Lucy led him out  of the hole to open ground. She seemed somehow confident. There  occurred to her only one way to act.    \"A little horse sense, as Dad would say,\" she soliloquized, and then,  when she got him out of the brush, she stood thrilled and amazed.    \"Oh, what a wild, beautiful horse! What a giant! He's bigger than the  King. Oh, if Dad could see him!\"    The red stallion did not appear to be hurt. The twitching of his  muscles must have been caused by the cactus spikes embedded in him.  There were drops of blood all over one side. Lucy thought she dared to  try to pull these thorns out. She had never in her life been afraid of  any horse. Farlane, Holley, all the riders, and her father, too, had  tried to make her realize the danger in a horse, sooner or later. But  Lucy could not help it; she was not afraid; she believed that the  meanest horse was actuated by natural fear of a man; she was not a man  and she had never handled a horse like a man. This red stallion showed  hate of the black horse and the rope that connected them; he showed  some spirit at the repeated blasts of Sage King. But he showed less  fear of her.    \"He has been a proud, wild stallion,\" mused Lucy. \"And he's now  broken--terribly broken--all but ruined.\"    Then she walked up to him naturally and spoke softly, and reached a  hand for his shoulder.    \"Whoa, Reddy. Whoa now.... There. That's a good fellow. Why, I wouldn't  rope you or hit you. I'm only a girl.\"    He drew up, made a single effort to jump, which she prevented, and then  he stood quivering, eying her, while she talked soothingly, and patted  him and looked at him in the way she had found infallible with most  horses. Lucy believed horses were like people, or easier to get along  with. Presently she gently pulled out one of the cactus spikes. The  horse flinched, but he stood. Lucy was slow, careful, patient, and  dexterous. The cactus needles were loose and easily removed or brushed  off. At length she got him free of them, and was almost as proud as she  was glad. The horse had gradually dropped his head; he was tired and  his spirit was broken.    \"Now, what shall I do?\" she queried. \"I'll take the back trail of these  horses. They certainly hadn't been here long before I saw them. And the  rider may be close. If not I'll take the horses home.\"    She slipped the noose from the stallion's head, leaving the hackamore,  and, coiling the loose lasso, she hung it over the pommel of the  black's saddle. Then she took up his bridle.    \"Come on,\" she called.    The black followed her, and the stallion, still fast to him by the  lasso Lucy had left tied, trooped behind with bowed head. Lucy was  elated. But Sage King did not like the matter at all. Lucy had to drop  the black's bridle and catch the King, and then ride back to lead the  other again.    A broad trail marked the way the two horses"]]]
