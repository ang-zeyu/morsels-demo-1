In others  supernatural beings are the narrators of the subordinate tales, as in  the Indian romances, _Vetala Panchavinsati_, or Twenty-five Tales of a  Demon, and the _Sinhasana Dwatrinsati_, or Tales of the Thirty-two  Speaking Statues--literally, Thirty-two (Tales) of a Throne. In others,  again, the relators are birds, as in the Indian work entitled _Hamsa  Vinsati_, or Twenty Tales of a Goose.    Of this last class is the popular Persian work, _Tuti Nama_, (Tales of a  Parrot, or Parrot-Book), of which I purpose furnishing some account, as  it has not yet been completely translated into English. This work was  composed, according to Pertsch, in A.D. 1329, by a Persian named  Nakhshabi, after an older Persian version, now lost, which was made from  a Sanskrit work, also no longer extant, but of which the modern  representative is the _Suka Saptati_, or Seventy Tales of a Parrot.[41]  The frame, or leading story, of the Persian Parrot-Book is to the  following effect:       [41] Ziyau-'d-Din Nakhshabi, so called from Nakhshab, or          Nasaf, the modern Kashi, a town situated between          Samarkand and the Oxus, led a secluded life in Bada'um,          and died, as stated by 'Abdal-Hakk, A.H. 751 (A.D.          1350-1).--Dr. Rieu's _Catalogue of Persian MSS. in the          British Museum_.--In 1792 the Rev. B. Gerrans published          an English translation of twelve of the fifty-two tales          comprised in the _Tuti Nama_, but the work is now best          known in Persia and India from an abridgment made by          Kadiri in the last century, which was printed, with a          translation, at London in 1801.    A merchant who had a very beautiful wife informs her one day that he has  resolved to travel into foreign countries in order to increase his  wealth by trade. His wife endeavours to persuade him to remain at home  in peace and security instead of imperiling his life among strangers.  But he expatiates on the evils of poverty and the advantages of wealth:  \"A man without riches is fatherless, and a home without money is  deserted. He that is in want of cash is a nonentity, and wanders in the  land unknown. It is, therefore, everybody's duty to procure as much  money as possible; for gold is the delight of our lives--it is the  bright live-coal of our hearts--the yellow links which fasten the coat  of mail--the gentle stimulative of the world--the complete coining die  of the globe--the traveller who speaks all languages, and is welcome in  every city--the splendid bride unveiled--the defender, register, and  mirror of jehandars. The man who has dirhams [_Scottice_,  'siller'--_Fr._ 'l'argent'] is handsome; the sun never shines on the  inauspicious man without money.\"[42] Before leaving home the merchant  purchased at great cost in the bazaar a wonderful parrot, that could  discourse eloquently and intelligently, and also a sharak, a species of  nightingale, which, according to Gerrans, \"imitates the human voice in  so surprising a manner that, if you do not see the bird, you cannot help  being deceived\"; and, having put them into the same cage, he charged his  spouse that whenever she had any matter of importance to transact she  should first obtain the sanction of both birds.       [42] \"He that has money in the scales,\" says Saadi, \"has          strength in his arms, and he who has not the command of          money is destitute of friends in the world.\"--Hundreds          of similar sarcastic observations on the power of wealth          might be cited from the Hindu writers, such as: \"He who          has riches has friends; he who has riches has relations;          he who has riches _is even a sage_!\" The following          verses in praise of money are, I think, worth          reproducing, if only for their whimsical arrangement:                                 Honey,                             Our Money                          We find in the end                       Both relation and friend;                 'Tis a helpmate for better, for worse.                     Neither father nor mother,                       Nor sister nor brother,                         Nor uncles nor aunts,                             Nor dozens                             Of cousins,                   Are like a friend in the purse.                   Still regard the main chance;                            'Tis the clink                            Of the chink                 Is the music to make the heart dance.      The merchant having protracted his absence many months (Vatsyayana, in  his _Kama Sutra_, says that the man who is given to much travelling does  not deserve to be married), and, his wife chancing to be on the roof of  her house one day when a young foreign prince of handsome appearance  passed by with his attendants, she immediately fell in love with  him--\"the battle-axe of prudence dropped from her hand; the vessel of  continence became a sport to the waves of confusion; while the avenues  leading to the fortress of reason remained unguarded, the sugar-cane of  incontinence triumphantly raised its head above the rose-tree of  patience.\" The prince had also observed the lady, as she stood on the  terrace of her house, and was instantly enamoured of her. He sends an  old woman (always the obliging--\"for a consideration\"--go-between of  Eastern lovers) to solicit an interview with the lady at his own palace  in the evening, and, after much persuasion, she consents. Arraying her  beauteous person in the finest apparel, she proceeds to the cage, and  first consults the sharak as to the propriety of her purpose. The sharak  forbids her to go, and is at once rewarded by having her head wrung off.  She then represents her case to the parrot, who, having witnessed the  fate of his companion, prudently resolves to temporise with the amorous  dame; so he \"quenched the fire of her indignation with the water of  flattery, and began a tale conformable to her temperament, which he took  care to protract till the morning.\" In this manner does the prudent  parrot prevent the lady's intended intrigue by relating, night after  night, till the merchant returns home from his travels, one or more  fascinating tales, which he does not bring to an end till it is too late  for the assignation.[43]       [43] In a Telugu MS., entitled _Patti Vrutti Mahima_ (the          Value of Chaste Wives), the minister of Chandra Pratapa          assumes the form of a bird owing to a curse pronounced          against him by Siva, and is sold to a merchant named          Dhanadatta, whose son, Kuveradatta, is vicious. The bird          by moral lessons reformed him for a time. They went to a          town called Pushpamayuri, where the king's son saw the          wife of Kuveradatta when he was absent from home. An          illicit amour was about to begin, when the bird          interposed by relating tales of chaste wives, and          detained the wanton lady at home till her husband          returned.    The order of the parrot's tales is not the same in all texts; in  Kadiri's abridgment there are few of the Nights which correspond with  those of the India Office MS. No. 2573, which may, perhaps, be partly  accounted for by the circumstance that Kadiri has given only 35 of the  52 tales that are in the original text. For the general reader, however,  the sequence of the tales is a minor consideration; and I shall content  myself with giving abstracts of some of the best stories, irrespective  of their order in any text, and complete translations of two or three  others. It so happens that the Third Night is the same in Kadiri and the  India Office MS. No. 2573, which comprises the complete text; and the  story the eloquent bird relates on that night may be entitled      _The Stolen Images._    A goldsmith and a carpenter, travelling in company, steal from a Hindu  temple some golden images, which, when they arrive in the neighbourhood  of their own city, they bury beneath a tree. The goldsmith goes secretly  one night and carries away the images, and next morning, when both go  together to share the spoil, the goldsmith accuses the carpenter of  having played him false. But the carpenter was a shrewd fellow, and so  he makes a figure resembling the goldsmith, dresses it in clothes  similar to what he usually wore, and procures a couple of bear's cubs,  which he teaches to take their food from the skirts and sleeves of the  effigy. Thus the cubs conceived a great affection for the figure of the  goldsmith. He then contrives to steal the goldsmith's two sons, and,  when the father comes to seek them at his house, he pretends they have  been changed into young bears. The goldsmith brings his case before the  kazi; the cubs are brought into court, and no sooner do they discover  the goldsmith than they run up and fondle him. Upon this the judge  decides in favour of the carpenter, to whom the goldsmith confesses his  guilt, and offers to give up all the gold if he restore his children,  which he does accordingly.[44]       [44] Many Asiatic stories relate to the concealing of          treasure--generally at the foot of a tree, to mark the          spot--by two or more companions, and its being secretly          stolen by one of them. The device of the carpenter in          the foregoing tale of abducting the rascally goldsmith's          two sons, and so on, finds an analogue in the          _Panchatantra_, the celebrated Sanskrit collection of          fables (Book I, Fab. 21, of Benfey's German          translation), where we read that a young man, who had          spent the wealth left to him by his father, had only a          heavy iron balance remaining of all his possessions, and          depositing it with a merchant went to another country.          When he returned, after some time, he went to the          merchant and demanded back his balance. The merchant          told him it had been eaten by rats;"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16955"],[0,"Three Translations of The Koran (Al-Qur'an) side (#20)"],[1,"of a garden on a height. The rainstorm smiteth it and it bringeth forth  its fruit twofold. And if the rainstorm smite it not, then the shower.  Allah is Seer of what ye do.    S: And the parable of those who spend their property to seek the  pleasure of Allah and for the certainty 'of their souls is as the  parable of a garden on an elevated ground, upon which heavy rain falls  so it brings forth its fruit twofold but if heavy rain does not fall  upon it, then light rain (is sufficient); and Allah sees what you do.    002.266  Y: Does any of you wish that he should have a garden with date-palms and  vines and streams flowing underneath, and all kinds of fruit, while he  is stricken with old age, and his children are not strong (enough to  look after themselves)- that it should be caught in a whirlwind, with  fire therein, and be burnt up? Thus doth Allah make clear to you (His)  Signs; that ye may consider.    P: Would any of you like to have a garden of palm-trees and vines, with  rivers flowing underneath it, with all kinds of fruit for him therein;  and old age hath stricken him and he hath feeble offspring; and a fiery  whirlwind striketh it and it is (all) consumed by fire. Thus Allah  maketh plain His revelations unto you, in order that ye may give  thought.    S: Does one of you like that he should have a garden of palms and vines  with streams flowing beneath it; he has in it all kinds of fruits; and  old age has overtaken him and he has weak offspring, when, (lo!) a  whirlwind with fire in it smites it so it becomes blasted; thus Allah  makes the communications clear to you, that you may reflect.    002.267  Y: O ye who believe! Give of the good things which ye have (honourably)  earned, and of the fruits of the earth which We have produced for you,  and do not even aim at getting anything which is bad, in order that out  of it ye may give away something, when ye yourselves would not receive  it except with closed eyes. And know that Allah is Free of all wants,  and worthy of all praise.    P: O ye who believe! Spend of the good things which ye have earned, and  of that which We bring forth from the earth for you, and seek not the  bad (with intent) to spend thereof (in charity) when ye would not take  it for yourselves save with disdain; and know that Allah is Absolute,  Owner of Praise.    S: O you who believe! spend (benevolently) of the good things that you  earn and or what We have brought forth for you out of the earth, and do  not aim at what is bad that you may spend (in alms) of it, while you  would not take it yourselves unless you have its price lowered, and  know that Allah is Self-sufficient, Praiseworthy.    002.268  Y: The Evil one threatens you with poverty and bids you to conduct  unseemly. Allah promiseth you His forgiveness and bounties. And Allah  careth for all and He knoweth all things.    P: The devil promiseth you destitution and enjoineth on you lewdness.  But Allah promiseth you forgiveness from Himself with bounty. Allah is  All-Embracing, All-Knowing.    S: Shaitan threatens you with poverty and enjoins you to be niggardly,  and Allah promises you forgiveness from Himself and abundance; and  Allah is Ample-giving, Knowing.    002.269  Y: He granteth wisdom to whom He pleaseth; and he to whom wisdom is  granted receiveth indeed a benefit overflowing; but none will grasp the  Message but men of understanding.    P: He giveth wisdom unto whom He will, and he unto whom wisdom is given,  he truly hath received abundant good. But none remember except men of  understanding.    S: He grants wisdom to whom He pleases, and whoever is granted wisdom,  he indeed is given a great good and none but men of understanding mind.    002.270  Y: And whatever ye spend in charity or devotion, be sure Allah knows it  all. But the wrong-doers have no helpers.    P: Whatever alms ye spend or vow ye vow, lo! Allah knoweth it.  Wrong-doers have no helpers.    S: And whatever alms you give or (whatever) vow you vow, surely Allah  knows it; and the unjust shall have no helpers.    002.271  Y: If ye disclose (acts of) charity, even so it is well, but if ye  conceal them, and make them reach those (really) in need, that is best  for you: It will remove from you some of your (stains of) evil. And  Allah is well acquainted with what ye do.    P: If ye publish your almsgiving, it is well, but if ye hide it and give  it to the poor, it will be better for you, and will atone for some of  your ill-deeds. Allah is Informed of what ye do.    S: If you give alms openly, it is well, and if you hide it and give it  to the poor, it is better for you; and this will do away with some of  your evil deeds; and Allah is aware of what you do.    002.272  Y: It is not required of thee (O Messenger), to set them on the right  path, but Allah sets on the right path whom He pleaseth. Whatever of  good ye give benefits your own souls, and ye shall only do so seeking  the \"Face\" of Allah. Whatever good ye give, shall be rendered back to  you, and ye shall not Be dealt with unjustly.    P: The guiding of them is not thy duty (O Muhammad), but Allah guideth  whom He will. And whatsoever good thing ye spend, it is for yourselves,  when ye spend not save in search of Allah's Countenance; and whatsoever  good thing ye spend, it will be repaid to you in full, and ye will not  be wronged.    S: To make them walk in the right way is not incumbent on you, but Allah  guides aright whom He pleases; and whatever good thing you spend, it is  to your own good; and you do not spend but to seek Allah's pleasure;  and whatever good things you spend shall be paid back to you in full,  and you shall not be wronged.    002.273  Y: (Charity is) for those in need, who, in Allah's cause are restricted  (from travel), and cannot move about in the land, seeking (For trade or  work): the ignorant man thinks, because of their modesty, that they are  free from want. Thou shalt know them by their (Unfailing) mark: They  beg not importunately from all the sundry. And whatever of good ye  give, be assured Allah knoweth it well.    P: (Alms are) for the poor who are straitened for the cause of Allah,  who cannot travel in the land (for trade). The unthinking man  accounteth them wealthy because of their restraint. Thou shalt know  them by their mark: They do not beg of men with importunity. And  whatsoever good thing ye spend, lo! Allah knoweth it.    S: (Alms are) for the poor who are confined in the way of Allah-- they  cannot go about in the land; the ignorant man thinks them to be rich on  account of (their) abstaining (from begging); you can recognise them by  their mark; they do not beg from men importunately; and whatever good  thing you spend, surely Allah knows it.    002.274  Y: Those who (in charity) spend of their goods by night and by day, in  secret and in public, have their reward with their Lord: on them shall  be no fear, nor shall they grieve.    P: Those who spend their wealth by night and day, by stealth and openly,  verily their reward is with their Lord, and their shall no fear come  upon them neither shall they grieve.    S: (As for) those who spend their property by night and by day, secretly  and openly, they shall have their reward from their Lord and they shall  have no fear, nor shall they grieve.    002.275  Y: Those who devour usury will not stand except as stand one whom the  Evil one by his touch Hath driven to madness. That is because they say:  \"Trade is like usury,\" but Allah hath permitted trade and forbidden  usury. Those who after receiving direction from their Lord, desist,  shall be pardoned for the past; their case is for Allah (to judge); but  those who repeat (The offence) are companions of the Fire: They will  abide therein (for ever).    P: Those who swallow usury cannot rise up save as he ariseth whom the  devil hath prostrated by (his) touch. That is because they say: Trade  is just like usury; whereas Allah permitteth trading and forbiddeth  usury. He unto whom an admonition from his Lord cometh, and (he)  refraineth (in obedience thereto), he shall keep (the profits of) that  which is past, and his affair (henceforth) is with Allah. As for him  who returneth (to usury) - Such are rightful owners of the Fire. They  will abide therein.    S: Those who swallow down usury cannot arise except as one whom Shaitan  has prostrated by (his) touch does rise. That is because they say,  trading is only like usury; and Allah has allowed trading and forbidden  usury. To whomsoever then the admonition has come from his Lord, then  he desists, he shall have what has already passed, and his affair is in  the hands of Allah; and whoever returns (to it)-- these arc the inmates  of the fire; they shall abide in it.    002.276  Y: Allah will deprive usury of all blessing, but will give increase for  deeds of charity: For He loveth not creatures ungrateful and wicked.    P: Allah hath blighted usury and made almsgiving fruitful. Allah loveth  not the impious and guilty.    S: Allah does not bless usury, and He causes charitable deeds to  prosper, and Allah does not love any ungrateful sinner.    002.277  Y: Those who believe, and do deeds of righteousness, and establish  regular prayers and regular charity, will have their reward with their  Lord: on them shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve.    P: Lo! those who believe and do good works and establish worship and pay  the poor-due, their reward is with their Lord and there shall no fear  come upon them neither shall they grieve.    S: Surely they who believe and do good deeds and keep up prayer and pay  the poor-rate they shall have their reward from their Lord, and they  shall have no fear, nor shall they grieve.    002.278  Y: O ye who believe! Fear Allah, and give up what remains of your demand  for usury, if ye are indeed believers.    P: O ye who believe! Observe your duty to Allah, and give up what  remaineth (due to you) from usury, if ye are (in truth) believers.   "]]]
