To this perpetual movement  of the waters of the Atlantic Ocean he ventures to attribute the  excavation of the Gulf of Mexico, and presumes that at the end of ages  it will break through the Isthmus of Panama, and transform America into  two great islands or two small continents. Not understanding that the  islands are either the result of upheaval, or outliers of continents,  due to subsidence, Lamarck supposed that his westward flow of the ocean,  due to the moon's attraction, eroded the eastern shores of America, and  the currents thus formed \"in their efforts to move westward, arrested by  America and by the eastern coasts of China, were in great part diverted  towards the South Pole, and seeking to break through a passage across  the ancient continent have, a long time since, reduced the portion of  this continent which united New Holland to Asia into an archipelago  which comprises the Molucca, Philippine, and Mariana Islands.\" The West  Indies and Windward Islands were formed by the same means, and the sea  not breaking through the Isthmus of Panama was turned southward, and the  action of its currents resulted in detaching the island of Tierra del  Fuego from South America. In like manner New Zealand was separated from  New Holland, Madagascar from Africa, and Ceylon from India.    He then refers to other \"displacements of the ocean basin,\" to the  shallowing of the Straits of Sunda, of the Baltic Sea, the ancient  subsidence of the coast of Holland and Zealand, and states that Sweden  offers all the appearance of having recently emerged from the sea, while  the Caspian Sea, formerly much larger than at present, was once in  communication with the Black Sea, and that some day the Straits of Sunda  and the Straits of Dover will be dry land, so that the union of England  and France will be formed anew.    Strangely enough, with these facts known to him, Lamarck did not see  that such changes were due to changes of level of the land rather than  to their being abandoned or invaded by the sea, but explained these by  his bizarre hypothesis of westward-flowing currents due to the moon's  action; though it should be in all fairness stated that down to recent  times there have been those who believed that it is the sea and not the  land which has changed its level.    This idea, that the sea and not the land has changed its level, was  generally held at the time Lamarck wrote, though Strabo had made the  shrewd observation that it was the land which moved. The Greek  geographer threw aside the notion of some of his contemporaries, and  with wonderful prevision, considering the time he wrote and the limited  observations he could make, claimed that it is not the sea which has  risen or fallen, but the land itself which is sometimes raised up and  sometimes depressed, while the sea-bottom may also be elevated or sunk  down. He refers to such facts as deluges, earthquakes, and volcanic  eruptions, and sudden swellings of the land beneath the sea.      \"And it is not merely the small, but the large islands also, not    merely the islands, but the continents which can be lifted up    together with the sea; and, too, the large and small tracts may    subside, for habitations and cities, like Bure, Bizona, and many    others, have been engulfed by earthquakes.\"[75]    But it was not until eighteen centuries later that this doctrine, under  the teachings of Playfair, Leopold von Buch, and Elie de Beaumont  (1829-30) became generally accepted. In 1845 Humboldt remarked, \"It is a  fact to-day recognized by all geologists, that the rise of continents is  due to an actual upheaval, and not to an apparent subsidence occasioned  by a general depression of the level of the sea\" (_Cosmos_, i). Yet as  late as 1869 we have an essay by H. Trautschold[76] in which is a  statement of the arguments which can be brought forward in favor of the  doctrine that the increase of the land above sea level is due to the  retirement of the sea.[77]    As authentic and unimpeachable proofs of the former existence of the sea  where now it is absent, Lamarck cites the occurrence of fossils in rocks  inland. Lamarck's first paper on fossils was read to the Institute in  1799, or about three years previous to the publication of the  _Hydrogeologie_. He restricts the term \"fossils\" to vegetable and animal  remains, since the word in his time was by some loosely applied to  minerals as well as fossils; to anything dug out of the earth. \"We find  fossils,\" he says, \"on dry land, even in the middle of continents and  large islands; and not only in places far removed from the sea, but even  on mountains and in their bowels, at considerable heights, each part of  the earth's surface having at some time been a veritable ocean bottom.\"  He then quotes at length accounts of such instances from Buffon, and  notices their prodigious number, and that while the greater number are  marine, others are fresh-water and terrestrial shells, and the marine  shells may be divided into littoral and pelagic.      \"This distinction is very important to make, because the    consideration of fossils is, as we have already said, one of the    principal means of knowing well the revolutions which have taken    place on the surface of our globe. This subject is of great    importance, and under this point of view it should lead naturalists    to study fossil shells, in order to compare them with their    analogues which we can discover in the sea; finally, to carefully    seek the places where each species lives, the banks which are    formed of them, the different beds which these banks may present,    etc., etc., so that we do not believe it out of place to insert here    the principal considerations which have already resulted from that    which is known in this respect.    \"_The fossils which are found in the dry parts of the surface of the  globe are evident indications of a long sojourn of the sea in the very  places where we observe them._\" Under this heading, after repeating the  statement previously made that fossils occur in all parts of the dry  land, in the midst of the continents and on high mountains, he inquires  _by what cause_ so many marine shells could be found in the explored  parts of the world. Discarding the old idea that they are monuments of  the deluge, transformed into fossils, he denies that there was such a  general catastrophe as a universal deluge, and goes on to say in his  assured, but calm and philosophic way:      \"On the globe which we inhabit, everything is submitted to continual    and inevitable changes, which result from the essential order of    things: they take place, in truth, with more or less promptitude or    slowness, according to the nature, the condition, or the situation    of the objects; nevertheless they are wrought in some time or other.      \"To nature, time is nothing, and it never presents a difficulty; she    always has it at her disposal, and it is for her a means without    limit, with which she has made the greatest as well as the least    things.      \"The changes to which everything in this world is subjected are    changes not only of form and of nature, but they are changes also of    bulk, and even of situation.      \"All the considerations stated in the preceding chapters should    convince us that nothing on the surface of the terrestrial globe is    immutable. They teach us that the vast ocean which occupies so great    a part of the surface of our globe cannot have its bed constantly    fixed in the same place; that the dry or exposed parts of this    surface themselves undergo perpetual changes in their condition, and    that they are in turn successively invaded and abandoned by the sea.      \"There is, indeed, every evidence that these enormous masses of    water continually displace themselves, both their bed and their    limits.      \"In truth these displacements, which are never interrupted, are in    general only made with extreme and almost inappreciable slowness,    but they are in ceaseless operation, and with such constancy that    the ocean bottom, which necessarily loses on one side while it gains    on another, has already, without doubt, spread over not only once,    but even several times, every point of the surface of the globe.      \"If it is thus, if each point of the surface of the terrestrial    globe has been in turn dominated by the seas--that is to say, has    contributed to form the bed of those immense masses of water which    constitute the ocean--it should result (1) that the insensible but    uninterrupted transfer of the bed of the ocean over the whole    surface of the globe has given place to deposits of the remains of    marine animals which we should find in a fossil state; (2) that this    translation of the ocean basin should be the reason why the dry    portions of the earth are always more elevated than the level of the    sea; so that the old ocean bed should become exposed without being    elevated above the sea, and without consequently giving rise to the    formation of mountains which we observe in so many different regions    of the naked parts of our globe.\"    Thus littoral shells of many genera, such as Pectens, Tellinae, cockle  shells, turban shells (_sabots_), etc., madrepores and other littoral  polyps, the bones of marine or of amphibious animals which have lived  near the sea, and which occur as fossils, are then unimpeachable  monuments of the sojourn of the sea on the points of the dry parts of  the globe where we observe their deposits, and besides these occur  deep-water forms. \"Thus the encrinites, the belemnites, the  orthoceratites, the ostracites, the terebratules, etc., all animals  which habitually live at the bottom, found for the most part among the  fossils deposited on the point of the globe in question, are  unimpeachable witnesses which attest that this same place was"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2057"],[0,"The Last of the Plainsmen (#20)"],[1,"in the wind.  An' see how dark the days are gettin' on us.\"    \"I'm for hunting musk-oxen,\" replied Jones.    \"Man, we're facin' the northern night; we're in the land of the  midnight sun. Soon we'll be shut in for seven months. A cabin we want,  an' wood, an' meat.\"    A forest of stunted spruce trees edged on the lake, and soon its dreary  solitudes rang to the strokes of axes. The trees were small and uniform  in size. Black stumps protruded, here and there, from the ground,  showing work of the steel in time gone by. Jones observed that the  living trees were no larger in diameter than the stumps, and questioned  Rea in regard to the difference in age.    \"Cut twenty-five, mebbe fifty years ago,\" said the trapper.    \"But the living trees are no bigger.\"    \"Trees an' things don't grow fast in the north land.\"    They erected a fifteen-foot cabin round the stone chimney, roofed it  with poles and branches of spruce and a layer of sand. In digging near  the fireplace Jones unearthed a rusty file and the head of a whisky  keg, upon which was a sunken word in unintelligible letters.    \"We've found the place,\" said Rea. \"Frank built a cabin here in 1819.  An' in 1833 Captain Back wintered here when he was in search of Captain  Ross of the vessel Fury. It was those explorin' parties thet cut the  trees. I seen Indian sign out there, made last winter, I reckon; but  Indians never cut down no trees.\"    The hunters completed the cabin, piled cords of firewood outside,  stowed away the kegs of dried fish and fruits, the sacks of flour,  boxes of crackers, canned meats and vegetables, sugar, salt, coffee,  tobacco--all of the cargo; then took the boat apart and carried it up  the bank, which labor took them less than a week.    Jones found sleeping in the cabin, despite the fire, uncomfortably  cold, because of the wide chinks between the logs. It was hardly better  than sleeping under the swaying spruces. When he essayed to stop up the  crack, a task by no means easy, considering the lack of material--Rea  laughed his short \"Ho! Ho!\" and stopped him with the word, \"Wait.\"  Every morning the green ice extended farther out into the lake; the sun  paled dim and dimmer; the nights grew colder. On October 8th the  thermometer registered several degrees below zero; it fell a little  more next night and continued to fall.    \"Ho! Ho!\" cried Rea. \"She's struck the toboggan, an' presently she'll  commence to slide. Come on, Buff, we've work to do.\"    He caught up a bucket, made for their hole in the ice, rebroke a  six-inch layer, the freeze of a few hours, and filling his bucket,  returned to the cabin. Jones had no inkling of the trapper's intention,  and wonderingly he soused his bucket full of water and followed.    By the time he had reached the cabin, a matter of some thirty or forty  good paces, the water no longer splashed from his pail, for a thin film  of ice prevented. Rea stood fifteen feet from the cabin, his back to  the wind, and threw the water. Some of it froze in the air, most of it  froze on the logs. The simple plan of the trapper to incase the cabin  with ice was easily divined. All day the men worked, easing only when  the cabin resembled a glistening mound. It had not a sharp corner nor a  crevice. Inside it was warm and snug, and as light as when the chinks  were open.    A slight moderation of the weather brought the snow. Such snow! A  blinding white flutter of grey flakes, as large as feathers! All day  they rustle softly; all night they swirled, sweeping, seeping brushing  against the cabin. \"Ho! Ho!\" roared Rea. \"'Tis good; let her snow, an'  the reindeer will migrate. We'll have fresh meat.\" The sun shone again,  but not brightly. A nipping wind came down out of the frigid north and  crusted the snows. The third night following the storm, when the  hunters lay snug under their blankets, a commotion outside aroused them.    \"Indians,\" said Rea, \"come north for reindeer.\"    Half the night, shouting and yelling, barking dogs, hauling of sleds  and cracking of dried-skin tepees murdered sleep for those in the  cabin. In the morning the level plain and edge of the forest held an  Indian village. Caribou hides, strung on forked poles, constituted  tent-like habitations with no distinguishable doors. Fires smoked in  the holes in the snow. Not till late in the day did any life manifest  itself round the tepees, and then a group of children, poorly clad in  ragged pieces of blankets and skins, gaped at Jones. He saw their  pinched, brown faces, staring, hungry eyes, naked legs and throats, and  noted particularly their dwarfish size. When he spoke they fled  precipitously a little way, then turned. He called again, and all ran  except one small lad. Jones went into the cabin and came out with a  handful of sugar in square lumps.    \"Yellow Knife Indians,\" said Rea. \"A starved tribe! We're in for it.\"    Jones made motions to the lad, but he remained still, as if transfixed,  and his black eyes stared wonderingly.    \"Molar nasu (white man good),\" said Rea.    The lad came out of his trance and looked back at his companions, who  edged nearer. Jones ate a lump of sugar, then handed one to the little  Indian. He took it gingerly, put it into his mouth and immediately  jumped up and down.    \"Hoppiesharnpoolie! Hoppiesharnpoolie!\" he shouted to his brothers and  sisters. They came on the run.    \"Think he means sweet salt,\" interpreted Rea. \"Of course these beggars  never tasted sugar.\"    The band of youngsters trooped round Jones, and after tasting the white  lumps, shrieked in such delight that the braves and squaws shuffled out  of the tepees.    In all his days Jones had never seen such miserable Indians. Dirty  blankets hid all their person, except straggling black hair, hungry,  wolfish eyes and moccasined feet. They crowded into the path before the  cabin door and mumbled and stared and waited. No dignity, no  brightness, no suggestion of friendliness marked this peculiar attitude.    \"Starved!\" exclaimed Rea. \"They've come to the lake to invoke the Great  Spirit to send the reindeer. Buff, whatever you do, don't feed them. If  you do, we'll have them on our hands all winter. It's cruel, but, man,  we're in the north!\"    Notwithstanding the practical trapper's admonition Jones could not  resist the pleading of the children. He could not stand by and see them  starve. After ascertaining there was absolutely nothing to eat in the  tepees, he invited the little ones into the cabin, and made a great pot  of soup, into which he dropped compressed biscuits. The savage children  were like wildcats. Jones had to call in Rea to assist him in keeping  the famished little aborigines from tearing each other to pieces. When  finally they were all fed, they had to be driven out of the cabin.    \"That's new to me,\" said Jones. \"Poor little beggars!\"    Rea doubtfully shook his shaggy head.    Next day Jones traded with the Yellow Knives. He had a goodly supply of  baubles, besides blankets, gloves and boxes of canned goods, which he  had brought for such trading. He secured a dozen of the large-boned,  white and black Indian dogs, huskies, Rea called them--two long sleds  with harness and several pairs of snowshoes. This trade made Jones rub  his hands in satisfaction, for during all the long journey north he had  failed to barter for such cardinal necessities to the success of his  venture.    \"Better have doled out the grub to them in rations,\" grumbled Rea.    Twenty-four hours sufficed to show Jones the wisdom of the trapper's  words, for in just that time the crazed, ignorant savages had glutted  the generous store of food, which should have lasted them for weeks.  The next day they were begging at the cabin door. Rea cursed and  threatened them with his fists, but they returned again and again.    Days passed. All the time, in light and dark, the Indians filled the  air with dismal chant and doleful incantations to the Great Spirit, and  the tum! tum! tum! tum! of tomtoms, a specific feature of their wild  prayer for food.    But the white monotony of the rolling land and level lake remained  unbroken. The reindeer did not come. The days became shorter, dimmer,  darker. The mercury kept on the slide.    Forty degrees below zero did not trouble the Indians. They stamped till  they dropped, and sang till their voices vanished, and beat the tomtoms  everlastingly. Jones fed the children once each day, against the  trapper's advice.    One day, while Rea was absent, a dozen braves succeeded in forcing an  entrance, and clamored so fiercely, and threatened so desperately, that  Jones was on the point of giving them food when the door opened to  admit Rea.    With a glance he saw the situation. He dropped the bucket he carried,  threw the door wide open and commenced action. Because of his great  bulk he seemed slow, but every blow of his sledge-hammer fist knocked a  brave against the wall, or through the door into the snow. When he  could reach two savages at once, by way of diversion, he swung their  heads together with a crack. They dropped like dead things. Then he  handled them as if they were sacks of corn, pitching them out into the  snow. In two minutes the cabin was clear. He banged the door and  slipped the bar in place.    \"Buff, I'm goin' to get mad at these thievin' red, skins some day,\" he  said gruffly. The expanse of his chest heaved slightly, like the slow  swell of a calm ocean, but there was no other indication of unusual  exertion.    Jones laughed, and again gave thanks for the comradeship of this  strange man.    Shortly afterward, he went out for wood, and as usual scanned the  expanse of the lake. The sun shone mistier and warmer, and frost  feathers floated in the air. Sky and sun and plain and lake--all were  gray. Jones fancied he saw a distant moving mass of darker shade than  the gray background. He called the trapper.    \"Caribou,\" said Rea instantly. \"The vanguard"]]]
