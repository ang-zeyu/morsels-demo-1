A peculiar class of dramas are the philosophical  ones, in which abstractions and systems appear as the _dramatis  personae_. One very special peculiarity of the Hindu drama is that women,  and persons of inferior rank, station, or caste are introduced as  speaking the _Prakrit_ or vulgarised Sanskrit, while the language of the  higher and more educated classes is the classical Sanskrit of the  present type.      THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE SANSKRIT DRAMA.    According to the code of criticism laid down in works on Sanskrit drama,  it should deal principally either with the sentiment of love, or the  heroic sentiment; the other sentiments should have a subsidiary  position. There should be four or five principal characters, and the  number of acts should vary from five to ten.    There are several species of the drama,--ten principal, and eighteen  minor. Of these none has a tragic end.    Every drama opens with a prologue or, to speak more correctly, an  introduction designed to prepare the way for the entrance of the  dramatis personae. The prologue commences with a prayer or benediction  (_Nandi_) invoking the national deity in favour of the audience.    Then generally follows a dialogue between the stage-manager and one or  two of the actors, which refers to the play and its author, mentions  past events and present circumstances elucidating the plot, and  invariably ends by adroitly introducing one of the dramatic personages,  and the real performance begins.    The play thus opened, is carried forward in scenes and acts; each scene  being marked by the entrance of one character and the exit of another.  The stage is never left vacant till the end of an act, nor does any  change of locality take place till then. The commencement of a new act  is often marked, by an introductory monologue or dialogue spoken by one  or more of the _dramatis personae_, and is called _Viskambhaka_ or  _Praveshaka_, which alludes to events supposed to have occurred in the  interval, and the audience are prepared for national plenty and  prosperity, addressed by one of the principal personages of the drama,  to the favourite deity. The development of the plot is brought about  through five divisions called the five _sandhis_. A _sandhi_ is a  combination of incidents whereby the object is attained.      THE MANNER OF PERFORMANCE.    There were no special theatres in the Hindu Middle Ages, and plays seem  to have been performed in the concert-room (_Sangita-Cala_) of royal  palaces. A curtain, divided in the middle, was a necessary part of the  stage arrangement; it did not, however, separate the audience from the  stage, as in the Roman theatre, but formed the back-ground of the stage.  Behind the curtain was the tiring-room (_nepathya_), whence the actors  came on the stage. When they were intended to enter hurriedly, they  were directed to do so \"with a toss of the curtain.\" The stage scenery  and decorations were of a very simple order, much being left to the  imagination of the spectator, as in the Shakespearian drama. Weapons,  seats, thrones, and chariots appeared on the stage; but it is highly  improbable that the latter were drawn by the living animals supposed to  be attached to them. There may have been some kind of aerial contrivance  to represent celestial chariots.      KALIDASA.    Kalidasa is the author of Sakuntala, Vikramorvasi and Malavikagnimitra.  He has been designated the Indian Shakespeare. He is reputed to have  been one of the nine ornaments (or \"gems\") of the Court of Vikramaditya,  king of Ujayin, whose Era, called _Samvat_, begins in 56 B.C. Stories  extant about him describe him to be the veriest fool. He rose to be a  great poet through the favour of the Goddess of Learning. Those stories  embody the public opinion that except through Divine Grace or the  Inspiration of the Muse a man cannot rise to such eminence by learning  and culture alone. His native place is Kashmir or its neighbourhood. He  had no doubt suffered from the pangs of poverty and neglect and  travelled a great deal. He professed the _Saiva_ form of worship.    His chief poems are the Raghuvansam, the Kumarasambhavam, the Meghadutam  and the Ritusanharam. It is believed that he wrote a treatise on  Astronomy and one on Sanskrit Prosody. His genius was of a versatile  nature. He was a poet, a dramatist and an astronomer. His works bespeak  the superior order of his scholarship--his acquaintance with the  important systems of philosophy, the Upanishads and the Puranas;--his  close observation of society and its intricate problems;--his delicate  appreciation of the most refined feelings, his familiarity with the  conflicting sentiments and emotions of the human heart,--and his keen  perception of and deep sympathy with the beauties of Nature. His  imagination was of a very high order and of a constructive nature. His  power of depicting all shades of character,--high and low,--from the  king to the common fisherman, is astonishing. His similes are so very  apt that they touch directly the heart and at once enlist the sympathy  of the reader. He is called the poet of the sentiment of Love as this  sentiment was his _forte_. His diction is chaste and free from  extravagance and is marked by that felicity of expression, spontaneity  and melody which have earned for him the epithet--\"the favoured child of  the Muse.\"      SAKUNTALA.    Of all Sanskrit dramas, Sakuntala has acquired the greatest celebrity.  It is not in India alone that it is known and admired. Its excellence  and beauty are acknowledged by learned men in every country of the  civilised world. It was the publication of a translation of this play by  Sir William Jones, which Max Muller thinks \"may fairly be considered as  the starting point of Sanskrit Philology.\" \"The first appearance of  this beautiful specimen of dramatic art,\" he continues, \"created, at  the time, a sensation throughout Europe, and the most rapturous praise  was bestowed upon it by men of high authority in matters of taste.\"      THE MORAL OF THE PLAY.    The recovery of the ring, like its loss, was a matter of pure accident  and points to the moral that the joys and sorrows of human beings depend  in most cases upon circumstances which lie beyond their control.      MALAVIKAGNIMITRA.    The play was not written at a time when Buddhism was despised, and had  already been driven out of India, but when it was still regarded with  favour, and was looked up to with reverence.      VIKRAMORVASI.    The root of all the stories of Pururavas and Urvasi were short  proverbial expressions, of which ancient dialects are so fond.  Thus--'Urvasi loves Pururavas,' meant 'the sun rises'; 'Urvasi sees  Pururavas naked,' meant 'the dawn is gone'; 'Urvasi finds Pururavas  again,' meant 'the sun is setting.'    The same ideas pervade the mythological language of Greece.      BHAVABHUTI.    The name of Bhavabhuti stands high in Sanskrit literature. It is perhaps  the highest in eloquence of expression and sublimity of imagination.  Throughout the whole range of Sanskrit literature--from the simple  lessons of Hitopadesha to the most elaborate polish of Naishadha--from  the terse vigour of Sankaracharjya to the studied majesty of Magha--from  the harmonious grace of Kalidasa to the ornate picturesqueness of  Kadambari, there is probably no writer who can come up to Bhavabhuti in  his wonderful command of Sanskrit language and surprising fluency and  elevation of diction.    The introductions to the Viracharita and the Malati-Madhava tell us that  he belonged to Padmapura in Vidarva (Berar) and was the grandson of  Gopal Bhatta and son of Nilkantha and Jatukarni. He was descended from a  family of Brahmans surnamed Udambaras.    His wonderful memory and vast erudition soon procured for him the title  of Srikantha or Minerva-throated. He soon removed to the court of  Ujjayini, where before the celebrated Mahakala all his plays were acted.    He wrote the Viracharita, the Uttarramacharita and the Malati-Madhava.    According to Rajatarangini, Bhavabhuti was patronized by Yasovarma, king  of Kanoja. This Yasovarma was subdued by Lalitaditya, king of Kasmira,  who acquired by his conquests a paramount supremacy over a large part of  India.      VIRA CHARITA.    The play throws some light on the condition of women. The princesses of  Videha publicly go to the hermitage of Vishvamitra. Sita comes out with  her attendants to dissuade Rama from meeting Jamadagnya and makes a  public entry with him on his return to Ayodhya. The old queens come out  to meet their children. Yet it must not be supposed that Hindu women  enjoyed the same freedom of intercourse as their European sisters. As  now, there used to be separate apartments for women. As now, they were  not admitted to an equality with men. The princesses of Videha do not  carry on conversation with the princes of Ajodhya. Sita does not come  out to pay her respects to the seniors, but her salute is announced from  within. There is now more seclusion of Hindu women as the result of the  influence of past Mahammedan rule. The influence of British rule is now  promoting the cause of female liberty.      UTTARRAMACHARITA.    The mutual sorrows of Rama and Sita in their state of separation are  pleasingly and tenderly expressed. The meeting of the father and his  sons may be compared advantageously with similar scenes with which the  fictions of Europe, both poetical and dramatic, abound. The true spirit  of chivalry pervades the encounter of the two young princes with their  father. Some brilliant thoughts occur, the justice and beauty of which  are not surpassed in any literature. The comparison of Chandraketu to a  lion's cub turning to brave the thunderbolt is one of these; and another  is the illustration of the effects of education upon minds possessed or  destitute of natural gifts.    MALATI-MADHAVA.    The marriage dress"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18297"],[0,"The Story of a Summer (#20)"],[1," more popularly 'boards.'  The corsets worn in those days did not clasp  in front, but merely laced behind, and inserted in the lining of the  front was the 'busk,' a piece of steel, or (among poorer people) wood  two inches wide, and the depth of the corset.  This busk, with the  addition of very tightly drawn lacing-strings, was supposed to give  great symmetry to the figure.  No village belle ever liked to own that  she laced tightly, or that she wore a board; as it was a tacit  admission that her figure could not bear unaided the test of the Empire  dress; consequently brother's remarks would be received by his young  friends with an injured air, and a vehement protest against such a  false accusation.  Brother would then test their truth by dropping his  handkerchief and requesting them to pick it up; if they 'wore a board,'  stooping would be impossible, or, at all events, very difficult; an  ordeal that would cover them with confusion, when the philosopher of  thirteen years old would resume his moral lecture upon the laws of  hygiene, and the follies of fashion.\"          CHAPTER XIV.    The Morning Mail--A letter to Mrs. Cleveland--Strange Contents--Ida's  Letter Bag--Appeals for Money, for Clothing, and for her Hand--An  Original Letter from a Trapper.      _July 13_.    Going to the post-office for the morning mail is, I think, our greatest  daily pleasure.  For some reason, we seldom have many letters by our  second mail, the 6.30 P.M. train, but in the morning our box is always  well filled, for we receive regularly the dear daily _Tribune_, six  weekly journals, and the leading magazines, and as we all have quite a  number of correspondents, we feel deeply aggrieved if our box is not  filled to repletion at least _once_ a day.    Ida, of course, is blessed with the greatest number of letters in the  family, for besides those from her own and her father's friends,      \"The cry is, still they come!\"    in shoals from unknown people of high and low degree, sometimes  containing merely poems, or expressions of sympathy and interest in the  sad history of our beautiful cousin, but varied occasionally by some of  the extraordinary appeals for help which I have already mentioned.    This morning I went down to the office when the mail came in.  There  was the usual number of expectant faces--Miss Murray and Miss Cox in  their carriages, and our more rural neighbors standing about the  pigeon-hole; however, every one makes way for us in Chappaqua, and I  approached nearer, and asked for our letters.  A very rough-looking man  standing near by, looked on with interest while the postmaster handed  out letter after letter, and finally said:    \"You belong to the family, do you not?\"    \"Yes,\" I said, for I always answer the rustic salutations of the people  about here, knowing them to have had a sort of feudal attachment to  uncle.    \"I thought a great deal of the old gentleman,\" he said with a rude  pathos in his voice that was very touching.  \"I used to see him very  often, for I live in these parts, and he always used to say  good-morning so pleasant, and was never ashamed to shake my dirty, hard  hand!\"    This reminds me of a little incident that mamma related yesterday.  She  was standing upon the balcony when an old gentleman who was driving  past, seeing mamma, stopped his horses, looked up and bowed, hesitated,  and then said:    \"Excuse me, but is thee the sister of Horace Greeley that was?\"    Mamma assented.    \"I thought so,\" he said, \"I saw it in thy countenance.\"    He then told mamma his name, and, after making a few remarks about  uncle that showed thoroughly good feeling, drove on.    It is not uncommon for those driving past to slacken their horses and  gaze earnestly at the house, and, if any of us are upon the piazza or  at the windows, they always bow--a mark of respect that is also shown  us by all the farmers and working people about here.    But I am forgetting Ida's letters.  I brought her this morning as many  as six or eight, some of which were put up in yellow-brown envelopes,  and directed in very questionable chirography.  In a few moments she  knocked at mamma's door and said,    \"I have brought you a few letters from some of my extraordinary  correspondents, Aunt Esther.\"    \"We will compare notes, my dear,\" said mamma, looking up from a  rose-colored sheet embellished with decidedly scrawly writing.  \"I have  just received one that is quite astounding.\"    \"From Tennessee,\" said Ida, looking at the postmark.  \"I know the  writing; that man has sent me as many as half a dozen letters, wishing  to enter into correspondence.  I suppose that finding me so  unresponsive he thinks he will try another member of the family.\"    \"He comes to the point in a most emphatic manner this time,\" said  mamma, \"by asking me for your hand; and as the letter is really a  curiosity in a literary point of view, I will read it to you.\" [1]      \"NASHVILLE, TENN.    \"MRS. JOHN F. CLEVELAND:--I reckon I am one of the spoilt children of  the South, similar to what Mr. Greeley says of South Carolina.  I want  to Marry Miss Ida, because she is the daughter of the most powerful Man  that has yet appeared on the American Continent.  Mr. Greeley turned  four millions of slaves loose with the Pen can't I win his daughter  with the same facile weapon?  Now Mrs. Cleveland won't you help me?  I  am not a Humbug, I have too many bullet holes through my body to be  classed with that tribe of insects.  I begin to feel a little skittish  about my age, 35 and not yet Married.  Yet I have always been rather a  fatalist and incline to Worship some star.  The Greeks Worshiped the  sun, And moon under the Name of Isis and Osiris, but I am more like the  Arab look to the stars for something sublime and unchanging among all  the bright lights that hang and move in the firmament.  The North Star  Appears to be the most important.  The Axis on which our Earth daily  turns.  The point from which all Mariners calculate their course in mid  ocean, and safely guides Them from continent to continent.  Without the  North Star there would be no Magnetic Meridian by which Governments  could be surveyed and divided equitably to its inhabitants and  civilization would lose its strong hold in being based on Justice.  If  there is any South Star that plays such an important part on this  continent or Europe I have never heard of it.  Miss Ida is the North  Star made so by the fact her father was the great center around Which  The whole country swung.  And As she is the oldest the crown of  greatness ought to rest on her head.  And if she will Marry Me I will  do as hard fighting as Caesar did to put it there.  With great respects  yours Truly    \"------ ------.\"      This letter would have excited more astonishment than it did, had it  not been only a fair specimen of what Ida has been daily receiving  since her father's death.  She then read us one from Indiana, addressed  to herself, and written, as the newspapers would say, with a view to  matrimony, but couched in quite a business-like strain:      \"MISS IDA GREELEY:    \"May I not surprise you by the fact that I desire an acquaintance with  you.  I send you my photograph (which however is too light to be  perfect), hoping yours in return.  If answered, I in my next will give  my age and history generally.    \"Yours truly    \"------ ------.\"      Another was from a widow with a son at college, who was very badly in  debt.  The mother appealed to Ida as a lady of fortune and generosity,  and the only person to whom they could look for aid, to pay the son's  debts, \"And,\" Ida added with mock indignation, \"she does not even  promise that I shall be ultimately rewarded with the young man's hand.\"    A third was dated Illinois, and bore the sonorous signature of Greeley  Barnum M------.  This epistle was extremely prolific, inasmuch as it  gave the occupations, ages, and a personal description of not only the  immediate members of the writer's family, but even extended to cousins  once or twice removed.  He had also much to say about his name of  Greeley; sometimes he was proud of it, and sometimes the reverse,  according to the company he was in.  Passing over all this prelude, we  discovered that Greeley Barnum M------'s object in writing was to  request a complete outfit for his sister who was about to go to school.  \"You are a young Lady, Miss greeley,\" the writer touchingly said, \"and  know everything that my sister would be likely to want.\"  The clothes,  he kindly intimated, could be put up in a box, and sent by express,  prepaid; and having done so, Ida was requested to notify his sister and  also an uncle and aunt at some distant point, that they might not be  distressed by thinking their niece was going to school without a  suitable outfit.    The next letter that Ida took up was from a Kansas man, more modest in  his requests than the others, for he neither asked for her hand nor a  loan, but being anxious for self-improvement, solicited a little  assistance from her in that line.  This letter was written in an even,  flowing hand, with very few mis-spelt words.      \"WICHITA, KANSAS.    \"MISS IDA GREELY:    \"Well, here is another fool, will no doubt be the first thought that  will pass through your mind, and it is quite likely that you may in the  main be correct.    \"I have a very high regard for all womankind.  I have read so much  about your sympathetic nature, I thought perhaps our sympathies might  be mutual in some respects.    \"I am always desirous of improving, and have heretofore looked to much  to persons no better qualified than myself to instruct or improve in  correspondence of any kind.  Knowing that you are educated and refined  I apply to you as a perfect Gentleman for a small portion of your time  say one half-hour in four weeks as a time set aside to answer any  letter I might write, at same time corract misspell'd words etc.  And  do it unreservedly.
