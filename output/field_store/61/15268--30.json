For we by no  means reject prayer, but the bare, useless howling and murmuring we  reject, as Christ Himself also rejects and prohibits long palavers. Now  we shall most briefly and clearly treat of the Lord's Prayer. Here  there is comprehended in seven successive articles, or petitions, every  need which never ceases to relate to us, and each so great that it  ought to constrain us to keep praying it all our lives.     The First Petition.    Hallowed be Thy name.    This is, indeed, somewhat obscure, and not expressed in good German,  for in our mother-tongue we would say: Heavenly Father, help that by  all means Thy name may be holy. But what is it to pray that His name  may be holy? Is it not holy already? Answer: Yes, it is always holy in  its nature, but in our use it is not holy. For God's name was given us  when we became Christians and were baptized, so that we are called  children of God and have the Sacraments by which He so incorporates us  in Himself that everything which is God's must serve for our use.    Here now the great need exists for which we ought to be most  concerned, that this name have its proper honor, be esteemed holy and  sublime as the greatest treasure and sanctuary that we have; and that  as godly children we pray that the name of God, which is already holy  in heaven, may also be and remain holy with us upon earth and in all  the world.    But how does it become holy among us? Answer, as plainly as it can be  said: When both our doctrine and life are godly and Christian. For  since in this prayer we call God our Father, it is our duty always to  deport and demean ourselves as godly children, that He may not receive  shame, but honor and praise from us.    Now the name of God is profaned by us either in words or in works. (For  whatever we do upon the earth must be either words or works, speech or  act.) In the first place, then, it is profaned when men preach, teach,  and speak in the name of God what is false and misleading, so that His  name must serve to adorn and to find a market for falsehood. That is,  indeed, the greatest profanation and dishonor of the divine name.  Furthermore, also when men, by swearing, cursing, conjuring, etc.,  grossly abuse the holy name as a cloak for their shame. In the second  place also by an openly wicked life and works, when those who are  called Christians and the people of God are adulterers, drunkards,  misers, envious, and slanderers. Here again must the name of God come  to shame and be profaned because of us. For just as it is a shame and  disgrace to a natural father to have a bad perverse child that opposes  him in words and deeds, so that on its account he suffers contempt and  reproach, so also it brings dishonor upon God if we who are called by  His name and have all manner of goods from Him teach, speak, and live  in any other manner except as godly and heavenly children, so that  people say of us that we must be not God's, but the devil's children.    Thus you see that in this petition we pray just for that which God  demands in the Second Commandment; namely, that His name be not taken  in vain to swear, curse, lie, deceive, etc., but be usefully employed  to the praise and honor of God. For whoever employs the name of God for  any sort of wrong profanes and desecrates this holy name, as aforetime  a church was considered desecrated when a murder or any other crime had  been committed in it, or when a pyx or relic was desecrated, as being  holy in themselves, yet become unholy in use. Thus this point is easy  and clear if only the language is understood, that to hallow is the  same as in our idiom to praise, magnify, and honor both in word and  deed.    Here, now, learn how great need there is of such prayer. For because we  see how full the world is of sects and false teachers, who all wear the  holy name as a cover and sham for their doctrines of devils, we ought  by all means to pray without ceasing, and to cry and call upon God  against all such as preach and believe falsely and whatever opposes and  persecutes our Gospel and pure doctrine, and would suppress it, as  bishops, tyrants, enthusiasts, etc. Likewise also for ourselves who  have the Word of God, but are not thankful for it, nor live as we  ought according to the same. If now you pray for this with your heart,  you can be sure that it pleases God; for He will not hear anything more  dear to Him than that His honor and praise is exalted above everything  else, and His Word is taught in its purity and is esteemed precious and  dear.    The Second Petition.     Thy kingdom come.    As we prayed in the First Petition concerning the honor and name of God  that He would prevent the world from adorning its lies and wickedness  with it, but cause it to be esteemed sublime and holy both in doctrine  and life, so that He may be praised and magnified in us, so here we  pray that His kingdom also may come. But just as the name of God is in  itself holy, and we pray nevertheless that it be holy among us, so also  His kingdom comes of itself, without our prayer, yet we pray  nevertheless that it may come to us, that is, prevail among us and with  us, so that we may be a part of those among whom His name is hallowed  and His kingdom prospers.    But what is the kingdom of God? Answer: Nothing else than what we  learned in the Creed, that God sent His Son Jesus Christ our Lord, into  the world to redeem and deliver us from the power of the devil, and to  bring us to Himself, and to govern us as a King of righteousness, life  and salvation against sin death, and an evil conscience, for which end  He has also bestowed His Holy Ghost, who is to bring these things home  to us by His holy Word, and to illumine and strengthen us in the faith  by His power.    Therefore we pray here in the first place that this may become  effective with us, and that His name be so praised through the holy  Word of God and a Christian life that both we who have accepted it may  abide and daily grow therein, and that it may gain approbation and  adherence among other people and proceed with power throughout the  world, that many may find entrance into the Kingdom of Grace, be made  partakers of redemption, being led thereto by the Holy Ghost, in order  that thus we may all together remain forever in the one kingdom now  begun.    For the coming of God's Kingdom to us occurs in two ways; first, here  in time through the Word and faith; and secondly, in eternity forever  through revelation. Now we pray for both these things, that it may come  to those who are not yet in it, and, by daily increase, to us who have  received the same, and hereafter in eternal life. All this is nothing  else than saying: Dear Father, we pray, give us first Thy Word, that  the Gospel be preached properly throughout the world; and secondly,  that it be received in faith, and work and live in us, so that through  the Word and the power of the Holy Ghost Thy kingdom may prevail among  us, and the kingdom of the devil be put down, that he may have no right  or power over us, until at last it shall be utterly destroyed, and sin,  death, and hell shall be exterminated, that we may live forever in  perfect righteousness and blessedness.    From this you perceive that we pray here not for a crust of bread or a  temporal, perishable good, but for an eternal inestimable treasure and  everything that God Himself possesses; which is far too great for any  human heart to think of desiring if He had not Himself commanded us to  pray for the same. But because He is God, He also claims the honor of  giving much more and more abundantly than any one can comprehend, --  like an eternal, unfailing fountain, which, the more it pours forth and  overflows, the more it continues to give, -- and He desires nothing  more earnestly of us than that we ask much and great things of Him, and  again is angry if we do not ask and pray confidently.    For just as when the richest and most mighty emperor would bid a poor  beggar ask whatever he might desire, and were ready to give great  imperial presents, and the fool would beg only for a dish of gruel, he  would be rightly considered a rogue and a scoundrel who treated the  command of his imperial majesty as a jest and sport, and was not worthy  of coming into his presence: so also it is a great reproach and  dishonor to God if we, to whom He offers and pledges so many  unspeakable treasures, despise the same, or have not the confidence to  receive them, but scarcely venture to pray for a piece of bread.    All this is the fault of the shameful unbelief which does not look to  God for as much good as will satisfy the stomach, much less expects  without doubt such eternal treasures of God. Therefore we must  strengthen ourselves against it, and let this be our first prayer;  then, indeed, we shall have all else in abundance, as Christ teaches  [Matt. 6, 33]: Seek ye first the kingdom of God and His righteousness  and all these things shall be added unto you. For how could He allow us  to suffer want and to be straitened in temporal things when He promises  that which is eternal and imperishable?     The Third Petition.    Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.    Thus far we have prayed that God's name be honored by us, and that His  kingdom prevail among us; in which two points is comprehended all that  pertains to the honor of God and to our salvation, that we receive as  our own God and all His riches. But now a need just as great arises,  namely, that we firmly keep them, and do not suffer ourselves to be  torn therefrom. For as in a good government it is not only necessary  that there be those who build and govern well, but also those who make  defense, afford protection and maintain it firmly, so here likewise,  although we have prayed for the greatest need, for the Gospel, faith,  and the Holy Ghost, that He may govern us and redeem us from the power  of the devil,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17221"],[0,"History of the Plague in London (#20)"],[1,"on that side which  the seamen call \"to windward,\" that the scent of the bodies might blow  from them. And thus great numbers went out of the world who were never  known, or any account of them taken, as well within the bills of  mortality as without.    This indeed I had, in the main, only from the relation of others; for I  seldom walked into the fields,[162] except towards Bethnal Green and  Hackney, or as hereafter. But when I did walk, I always saw a great many  poor wanderers at a distance, but I could know little of their cases;  for, whether it were in the street or in the fields, if we had seen  anybody coming, it was a general method to walk away. Yet I believe the  account is exactly true.    As this puts me upon mentioning my walking the streets and fields, I  cannot omit taking notice what a desolate place the city was at that  time. The great street I lived in, which is known to be one of the  broadest of all the streets of London (I mean of the suburbs as well as  the liberties, all the side where the butchers lived, especially without  the bars[163]), was more like a green field than a paved street; and the  people generally went in the middle with the horses and carts. It is  true that the farthest end, towards Whitechapel Church, was not all  paved, but even the part that was paved was full of grass also. But this  need not seem strange, since the great streets within the city, such as  Leadenhall Street, Bishopsgate Street, Cornhill, and even the Exchange  itself, had grass growing in them in several places. Neither cart nor  coach was seen in the streets from morning to evening, except some  country carts to bring roots and beans, or pease, hay, and straw, to the  market, and those but very few compared to what was usual. As for  coaches, they were scarce used, but to carry sick people to the  pesthouse and to other hospitals, and some few to carry physicians to  such places as they thought fit to venture to visit; for really coaches  were dangerous things, and people did not care to venture into them,  because they did not know who might have been carried in them last; and  sick infected people were, as I have said, ordinarily carried in them to  the pesthouses; and sometimes people expired in them as they went along.    It is true, when the infection came to such a height as I have now  mentioned, there were very few physicians who cared to stir abroad to  sick houses, and very many of the most eminent of the faculty[164] were  dead, as well as the surgeons also; for now it was indeed a dismal time,  and for about a month together, not taking any notice of the bills of  mortality, I believe there did not die less than fifteen or seventeen  hundred a day, one day with another.    One of the worst days we had in the whole time, as I thought, was in  the beginning of September, when, indeed, good people were beginning to  think that God was resolved to make a full end of the people in this  miserable city. This was at that time when the plague was fully come  into the eastern parishes. The parish of Aldgate, if I may give my  opinion, buried above one thousand a week for two weeks, though the  bills did not say so many; but it[165] surrounded me at so dismal a  rate, that there was not a house in twenty uninfected. In the Minories,  in Houndsditch, and in those parts of Aldgate Parish about the Butcher  Row, and the alleys over against me,--I say, in those places death  reigned in every corner. Whitechapel Parish was in the same condition,  and though much less than the parish I lived in, yet buried near six  hundred a week, by the bills, and in my opinion near twice as many.  Whole families, and indeed whole streets of families, were swept away  together, insomuch that it was frequent for neighbors to call to the  bellman to go to such and such houses and fetch out the people, for that  they were all dead.    And indeed the work of removing the dead bodies by carts was now grown  so very odious and dangerous, that it was complained of that the bearers  did not take care to clear such houses where all the inhabitants were  dead, but that some of the bodies lay unburied till the neighboring  families were offended by the stench, and consequently infected. And  this neglect of the officers was such, that the churchwardens and  constables were summoned to look after it; and even the justices of the  hamlets[166] were obliged to venture their lives among them to quicken  and encourage them; for innumerable of the bearers died of the  distemper, infected by the bodies they were obliged to come so near. And  had it not been that the number of people who wanted employment, and  wanted bread, as I have said before, was so great that necessity drove  them to undertake anything, and venture anything, they would never have  found people to be employed; and then the bodies of the dead would have  lain above ground, and have perished and rotted in a dreadful manner.    But the magistrates cannot be enough commended in this, that they kept  such good order for the burying of the dead, that as fast as any of  those they employed to carry off and bury the dead fell sick or died (as  was many times the case), they immediately supplied the places with  others; which, by reason of the great number of poor that was left out  of business, as above, was not hard to do. This occasioned, that,  notwithstanding the infinite number of people which died and were sick,  almost all together, yet they were always cleared away, and carried off  every night; so that it was never to be said of London that the living  were not able to bury the dead.    As the desolation was greater during those terrible times, so the  amazement of the people increased; and a thousand unaccountable things  they would do in the violence of their fright, as others did the same in  the agonies of their distemper: and this part was very affecting. Some  went roaring, and crying, and wringing their hands, along the street;  some would go praying, and lifting up their hands to heaven, calling  upon God for mercy. I cannot say, indeed, whether this was not in their  distraction; but, be it so, it was still an indication of a more serious  mind when they had the use of their senses, and was much better, even as  it was, than the frightful yellings and cryings that every day, and  especially in the evenings, were heard in some streets. I suppose the  world has heard of the famous Solomon Eagle, an enthusiast. He, though  not infected at all, but in his head, went about denouncing of judgment  upon the city in a frightful manner; sometimes quite naked, and with a  pan of burning charcoal on his head. What he said or pretended, indeed,  I could not learn.    I will not say whether that clergyman was distracted or not, or whether  he did it out of pure zeal for the poor people, who went every evening  through the streets of Whitechapel, and, with his hands lifted up,  repeated that part of the liturgy of the church continually, \"Spare us,  good Lord; spare thy people whom thou hast redeemed with thy most  precious blood.\" I say I cannot speak positively of these things,  because these were only the dismal objects which represented themselves  to me as I looked through my chamber windows; for I seldom opened the  casements while I confined myself within doors during that most violent  raging of the pestilence, when indeed many began to think, and even to  say, that there would none escape. And indeed I began to think so too,  and therefore kept within doors for about a fortnight, and never stirred  out. But I could not hold it. Besides, there were some people, who,  notwithstanding the danger, did not omit publicly to attend the worship  of God, even in the most dangerous times. And though it is true that a  great many of the clergy did shut up their churches and fled, as other  people did, for the safety of their lives, yet all did not do so. Some  ventured to officiate, and to keep up the assemblies of the people by  constant prayers, and sometimes sermons, or brief exhortations to  repentance and reformation; and this as long as they would hear them.  And dissenters[167] did the like also, and even in the very churches  where the parish ministers were either dead or fled; nor was there any  room for making any difference at such a time as this was.    It pleased God that I was still spared, and very hearty and sound in  health, but very impatient of being pent up within doors without air, as  I had been for fourteen days or thereabouts. And I could not restrain  myself, but I would go and carry a letter for my brother to the  posthouse; then it was, indeed, that I observed a profound silence in  the streets. When I came to the posthouse, as I went to put in my  letter, I saw a man stand in one corner of the yard, and talking to  another at a window; and a third had opened a door belonging to the  office. In the middle of the yard lay a small leather purse, with two  keys hanging at it, with money in it; but nobody would meddle with it. I  asked how long it had lain there. The man at the window said it had  lain almost an hour, but they had not meddled with it, because they did  not know but the person who dropped it might come back to look for it. I  had no such need of money, nor was the sum so big that I had any  inclination to meddle with it or to get the money at the hazard it might  be attended with: so I seemed to go away, when the man who had opened  the door said he would take it up, but so that, if the right owner came  for it, he should be sure to have it. So he went in and fetched a pail  of water, and set it down hard by the purse, then went again and fetched  some gunpowder, and cast a good deal of powder upon the purse, and then  made a train from that which he had thrown loose upon the purse (the  train reached about two yards); after this he goes in a third time, and  fetches out a pair of tongs red hot, and which he had prepared, "]]]
