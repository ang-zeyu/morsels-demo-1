He went to the window and could  see nothing, although the night had not been dark when he went to  bed. He shouted, and there was no reply; nor could he hear any talking  without. His name, by the way, was H. J. Owens, though his name does not  matter except for convenience in mentioning him. Owens, then, lighted a  lamp, and almost instantly was forced to reach out quickly and save it  from toppling, because one corner of the shack was lifting, lifting...    Outside, the Happy Family worked in silence. Before they had left One  Man Coulee they had known exactly what they were to do, and how to do  it. They knew who was to nail the hastily constructed shutter over the  window. They knew who was to fasten the door so that it could not be  opened from within. They knew also who were to use the crow-bars, who  were to roll the skids under the shack.    There were twelve of them--because Bert Rogers had insisted upon  helping. In not many more minutes than there were men, they were in  their saddles, ready to start. The shack lurched forward after the  straining horses. Once it was fairly started it moved more easily than  you might think it could do, upon crude runners made of cottonwood logs  eight inches or so in diameter and long enough for cross pieces bolted  in front and rear. The horses pulled it easily with the ropes tied to  the saddle-horns, just as they had many times pulled the roundup wagons  across mirey creeks or up steep slopes; just as they had many times  pulled stubborn cattle or dead cattle--just as they had been trained  to pull anything and everything their masters chose to attach to their  ropes.    Within, Owens called to them and cursed them. When they had just gained  an even pace, he emptied his revolver through the four sides of the  shack. But he did not know where they were, exactly, so that he was  compelled to shoot at random. And since the five shots seemed to have  no effect whatever upon the steady progress of the shack, he decided to  wait until he could see where to aim. There was no use, he reflected,  in wasting good ammunition when there was a strong probability that he  would need it later.    After a half hour or more of continuous travel, the shack tilted on a  steep descent. H. J. Owens blew out his lamp and swore when a box came  sliding against his shins in the dark. The descent continued until it  was stopped with a jolt that made him bite his tongue painfully, so that  tears came into the eyes that were the wrong shade of blue to please  Andy Green. He heard a laugh cut short and a muttered command, and that  was all. The shack heaved, toppled, righted itself and went on down, and  down, and down; jerked sidewise to the left, went forward and then swung  joltingly the other way. When finally it came to a permanent stand it  was sitting with an almost level floor.    Then the four corners heaved upward, two at a time, and settled with a  final squeal of twisted boards and nails. There was a sound of confused  trampling, and after that the lessening sounds of departure. Mr. Owens  tried the door again, and found it still fast. He relighted the lamp,  carried it to the window and looked upon rough boards outside the glass.  He meditated anxiously and decided to remain quiet until daylight.    The Happy Family worked hard, that night. Before daylight they were in  their beds and snoring except the two who guarded the cattle. Each was  in his own cabin. His horse was in his corral, smooth-coated and dry.  There was nothing to tell of the night's happenings,--nothing except the  satisfied grins on their faces when they woke and remembered.        CHAPTER 12. SHACKS, LIVE STOCK AND PILGRIMS PROMPTLY AND PAINFULLY REMOVED         \"I'm looking rather seedy now, while holding down my            claim,       And my grub it isn't always served the best,       And the mice play shyly round me as I lay me down to rest In       my little old sod shanty on my claim.       Oh, the hinges are of leather and the windows have no glass,       And the roof it lets the howling blizzards in,       And I hear the hungry kiote as he sneaks up through               grass--    \"Say! have they got down the hill yet, Pink;\" Pink took his cigarette  from his fingers, leaned and peered cautiously through the grimy window.  \"Unh-huh. They're coming up the flat.\"    Whereupon Andy Green, ostentatiously washing his breakfast dishes,  skipped two or three verses and lifted his voice in song to fit the  occasion.         \"How I wish that some kind-hearted girl would pity on me               take,       And relieve me of the mess that I am in!       Oh, the angel, how I'd bless her if her home with me she'd               make,       In my little old sod shanty--    \"Got her yet?\" And he craned his neck to look. \"Aw, they've pulled up,  out there, listening!\"         \"My clothes are plastered o'er with dough, I'm looking like a               fright,       And everything is scattered round the room--\"    \"Why don't yuh stop that caterwauling?\" Pink demanded fretfully. \"You'll  queer the whole play if you keep it up. They'll swear you're drunk!\"    There was sense in that. Andy finished the line about remaining two  happy lovers in his little old sod shanty, and went to the door with the  dishpan. He threw out the water, squeezed the dishrag in one hand and  gave the inside of the pan a swipe before he appeared to discover that  Miss Allen and Florence Grace Hallman were riding up to his door. As a  matter of fact, he had seen them come over the top of the bluff and had  long ago guessed who they were.    He met them with a smile of surprised innocence, and invited them  inside. They refused to come, and even Miss Allen showed a certain  reproachful coolness toward him. Andy felt hurt at that, but he did not  manifest the fact. Instead he informed them that it was a fine morning.  And were they out taking a look around?    They were. They were looking up the men who had perpetrated the outrage  last night upon four settlers.    \"Outrage?\" Andy tilted the dishpan against the cabin wall, draped the  dishrag over the handle and went forward, pulling down his sleeves.  \"What outrage is that, Miss Hallman? Anybody killed?\"    Miss Hallman watched him with her narrowed glance. She saw the quick  glance he gave Miss Allen, and her lids narrowed still more. So that  was it! But she did not swerve from her purpose, for all this unexpected  thrust straight to the heart of her self-love.    \"You know that no one was killed. But you damaged enough property to  place you on the wrong side of the law, Mr. Green. Not one of those  shacks can be gotten out of the gulch except in pieces!\"    Andy smiled inside his soul, but his face was bewildered; his eyes fixed  themselves blankly upon her face. \"Me? Damaging property? Miss Hallman,  you don't know me yet!\" Which was perfectly true. \"What shacks are you  talking about? In what gulch? All the shacks I've seen so far have been  stuck up on bald pinnacles where the blizzards will hit 'em coming  and going next winter.\" He glanced again at Miss Allen with a certain  sympathetic foretaste of what she would suffer next winter if she stayed  in her shack.    \"Don't try to play innocent, Mr. Green.\" Florence Grace Hallman drew her  brows together. \"We all know perfectly well who dragged those shacks off  the claims last night.\"    \"Don't you mean that you think you know? I'm afraid you've kinda taken  it for granted I'd be mixed up in any deviltry you happened to hear  about. I've got in bad with you--I know that--but just the same, I hate  to be accused of everything that takes place in the country. All this is  sure interesting news to me. Whereabouts was they taken from? And when,  and where to? Miss Allen, you'll tell me the straight of this, won't  you? And I'll get my hoss and you'll show me what gulch she's talking  about, won't you?\"    Miss Allen puckered her lips into a pout which meant indecision, and  glanced at Florence Grace Hallman. And Miss Hallman frowned at being  shunted into the background and referred to as she, and set her teeth  into her lower lip.    \"Miss Allen prefers to choose her own company,\" she said with distinct  rudeness. \"Don't try to wheedle her--you can't do it. And you needn't  get your horse to ride anywhere with us, Mr. Green. It's useless. I just  wanted to warn you that nothing like what happened last night will be  tolerated. We know all about you Flying U men--you Happy Family.\" She  said it as if she were calling them something perfectly disgraceful.  \"You may be just as tough and bad a you please--you can't frighten  anyone into leaving the country or into giving up one iota of their  rights. I came to you because you are undoubtedly the ring-leader of the  gang.\" She accented gang. \"You ought to be shot for what you did  last night. And if you keep on--\" She left the contingency to his  imagination.    \"Well, if settling up the country means that men are going to be shot  for going to bed at dark and asleeping till sun-up, all I've got to say  is that things ain't like they used to be. We were all plumb peaceful  here till your colony came, Miss Hallman. Why, the sheriff never got out  this way often enough to know the trails! He always had to ask his way  around. If your bunch of town mutts can't behave themselves and leave  each other alone, I don't know what's to be done about it. We ain't  hired to keep the peace.\"    \"No, you've been hired to steal all the land you can and make all the  trouble you can. We understand that perfectly.\"    Andy shook his head in meek denial, and with a sudden impulse turned  toward the cabin. \"Oh, Pink!\" he called, and brought that boyish-faced  young man to the door, his eyes as wide and as pure as the eyes of a  child.    Pink lifted his hat with just the proper degree of confusion to impress  the girls"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17404"],[0,"Kinship Organisations and Group Marriage in Australia (#20)"],[1," the west; but that Yakomari, travelling upwards from the  south-west, displaced the more usual eighth class name, or perhaps we  should say, replaced it, when the eight-class system was adopted, for a  name is not likely to have gone out of use when it had once been applied  as a designation.    Attention has been called in connection with the phratries to the  suffixes such as _um_, _itch_, _aku_[115], etc. Their precise meaning is  usually uncertain. An attentive consideration of the class names seems  to show that similar suffixes have been used in forming them. If we  compare Panunga and Baniker, it seems a fair conclusion that the _ban_  or _pan_ is compounded with _iker_ (_aku_) or _unga_, for among the  Yookala, the nearest neighbours of the Bingongina, who have it as a  phratriac suffix, the _-agoo_ of the class names is unmistakeably  independent of the root word, whatever that may be. In addition to  _unga_ we find _inginja_, _angie_, _inja_, _itch_ (recalling the _itji_  of the phratries), _itchana_, and the form _anjegoo_ which seems to have  a double suffix. _Ara_, _yeri_, _aree_, _um_, _ana_, _ula_ (as we see by  comparing Purula with Burong), _ta_, and the possibly double form  _tjuka_, seem to be further examples.    The feminine forms Nalyirri for Thalirri (=Palyeri), Nala for Chula,  Ninum for Tjinum, Nana for Tjana or Thama, etc. suggest that prefixes  are also to be distinguished. They seem to be _choo_, _joo_, _ja_, _ya_,  _n-_, _yun_, _u-_, _ku_, _pu_, _bu_, _nu_, etc. We are however on very  uncertain ground here, for the feminine forms may be deliberate  creations. Allowance has to be made too for the personal equation of the  observer, which is by no means inconsiderable. Possibly this factor,  together with ordinary laws of phonetic change, the most elementary  principles of which have yet to be established for the Australian  languages, will suffice to account for the variations in the names as  recorded. Otherwise the words are in most cases reduced to monosyllabic  roots from which it seems hopeless to attempt to extract a meaning.    These questions of suffixes and prefixes are intimately connected with  the very difficult problem of the origin of the classes. The languages  of these tribes are at present, if not distinct linguistic stocks, at  any rate very far from being mere dialectical variations of a common  tongue, for the members of two tribes appear to be mutually  unintelligible, unless, contrary to the custom of the American Indians,  they are bilingual. But if each tribe added a suffix, and thus adopted  into their own language words which, from the general agreement among  the class names of this group, seem to have come to them from outside,  it is a reasonable hypothesis that the word which they adopted had some  meaning for them. Of course we may suppose that the class names were all  adopted in the far off time when all spoke a common language. But apart  from the difficulty that this presupposes the existence of an  eight-class system at that early period, it is clear from the Queensland  evidence that class names have been handed on from tribe to tribe, and  it is reasonable to suppose this to have been the case with the northern  tribes. This conclusion is borne out by the forms of the suffixes, which  do not appear to have been developed from one root determinative, as  must have been the case if we suppose that the names originated when the  language spoken by these tribes was undifferentiated; and by the facts  as to the apparent duplication of Koomara, to which allusion has already  been made.    The important point about the class, as distinguished from the phratry  systems, is the great extent covered by the former. The north-west area  of male descent is virtually one from the point of view of class names;  two other areas are very large, six are of medium size, three are small,  and the remaining one is probably medium.    Although the question of the meaning of the class names is closely bound  up with that of their origin, the problem is closely bound up with some  of the points discussed in this chapter. The meaning of the eight-class  names is connected with the area of origin of the system, and linguistic  questions, such as those relating to suffixes, come in. We may therefore  briefly discuss at this point the meaning of the class names.    On the whole it may be said that we know the meaning of the class names  only in exceptional cases. The Kiabara, Kamilaroi, Annan River,  Kuinmurbura, Narrang-ga, and two of the West Australian names can be  translated (see Table I). But with these exceptions we have no certain  knowledge of the meaning of the single class names.    Conjectures are of comparatively little value. For in the first place  the number of words recorded from any given tribe is as a rule very  small, and little or no indication of the pronunciation is given even in  the latest works on Australian ethnography. The variations, evidently  purely arbitrary and due to the want of training in phonetics, are  frequently very considerable. And finally the area over which the names  prevail is sufficiently great to give us our choice from half a dozen or  more different tribal languages, which combined with the variation in  the form of the words, adds very considerably to the probability that  there will be found somewhere within the area a word or words bearing a  deceptively close resemblance to the class names. How far this is the  case may be made clear by one or two instances of chance resemblances  between animal names (it seems on the whole probable that if the names  are translateable they will turn out to be animal names) in the same or  neighbouring tribes. The meaning of Arunta seems to be white  cockatoo[116], but we also find a word almost indistinguishable from it  in sound--eranta--with the meaning of pelican[117]. Kulbara means emu  and koolbirra kangaroo[118]. Malu (=kangaroo), mala (=mouse), and male  (=swan) are found in tribes of West Australia, though not of tribes  living in immediate proximity one to another[119]. But perhaps the best  example is that of Derroein, which, as we have seen, means kangaroo. In  addition to durween (young male kangaroo) we find at no great distance  the words dirrawong (=iguana) and deerooyn (=whip snake), either of  which bears a sufficiently close resemblance to the class name to be  accepted as a translation for it in the absence of other  competitors[120].    With these facts in mind such suggestions as an attentive study of  vocabularies has disclosed are naturally put forward with a full sense  of their uncertainty, they are of a purely tentative nature.    For the Koobaroo (var. Obur) of the Goorgilla set I find in the same  group the homophone _obur_ (gidea tree), which is also a totem of the  group of tribes in question[121]. The Wotero of Halifax Bay suggests  Wutheru, for which I am unable to find a meaning, unless it be emu, as  given by one observer, who however on another occasion gave a different  translation. Korkoro in the same set may be the same as korkoren  (opossum) of a tribe some 150 miles away[122]. The muri[123] and kubbi  of the Kamilaroi and Turribul (?) mean kangaroo and opossum in the  latter language, and ibbai means Eaglehawk in Wiraidhuri[124]. The  Kamilaroi bundar (=kangaroo) may give us a clue to the meaning of the  Dippil Bundar[125]; the Kiabara Bulcoin has a homophone in the Peechera  tribe, where it means kangaroo; on the Hastings River it means red  wallaby. Balcun however means native bear according to Mathew[126].    If we turn to the eight-class tribes the results are hardly more  striking. The Dieri Pultara, Palyara and Upala[127], are homophones of  the class names which we have seen as alternative forms; but this very  fact makes it certain, or nearly so, that one of the homophones is due  to chance coincidence. Bearing in mind that the Arunta alone have the  form Bulthara, we may perhaps see in the change undergone by the word in  their language the result of attraction, though it must be confessed  that the hypothesis is far-fetched in the case of a non-written  language. On the other hand it tells against the Palyeri=Palyara  equation that the Arunta, who are by far the nearest to the Dieri, use  the form Bulthara. The equation Kanunka=Panunga is not backed by any  evidence that the p-k change is admissible. Finally three of the four  words mentioned seem to be compounded with a suffix; and if this is so  it is clearly useless to equate them with words in which this suffix is  a component part.    One class name only, Ungilla, is found in the Arunta area itself (and  far beyond it, as far as the Gulf of Carpentaria) with the meaning  crow[128]. If we may regard the _j_ and _k_ of the forms jungalla,  kungalla, as a prefix, the equation seems justified; otherwise it seems  an insuperable difficulty that not the original form of the class name,  but the derivative and shortened form is the one to which the equation  applies. Our very defective knowledge of the languages of the  eight-class tribes makes it possible that when we know more of them  other root words may be discovered. At present it can only be said that  in very few instances have we either in the four-class or the  eight-class areas any warrant for saying that we know the meaning of the  class names, much less that we know them to be derived from the names of  animals.    One piece of evidence on the subject we need mention only to reject. The  Rev. H. Kempe, of the Lutheran Mission among the southern Arunta, has on  two occasions stated that the classes in signalling to each other use as  their signs the gestures employed to designate animals[129]. On one  occasion however he assigns to the Bunanka class the eaglehawk gesture,  on another the lizard gesture; the remaining three, which he added only  on the second occasion, were ant, wallaby and eaglehawk.
