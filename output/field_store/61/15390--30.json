[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19800"],[0,"London and the Kingdom - Volume 1 (#20)"],[1,"  the king's action in writing from Berwick (28th June, 1291) to the warden  and aldermen of the city--at a time when he was completely in the hands of  the Italian goldsmiths and money-lenders--soliciting for her a more or less  lucrative post is easily intelligible.(318) The king's request was  refused, notwithstanding the city being at the time in charge of a  _custos_ of his own choice instead of a mayor elected by the citizens  themselves. Such requests produced friction between the king and the city,  and the former's financial relations with the foreign merchants were  fraught with danger to himself and to his son.(319)    (M202)    Edward's anxiety was in the meanwhile increased by domestic troubles. In  1290 he suffered a bitter disappointment by the death of a Scottish  princess who was affianced to his son, the Prince of Wales, and thus a  much-cherished plan for establishing friendly relations between the two  countries was frustrated.  But this disappointment was quickly cast in the  shade by the more severe affliction he suffered in the loss of his wife.  In November Queen Eleanor died. Her corpse was brought from Lincoln to  Westminster, and the bereaved husband ordered a memorial cross to be set  up at each place where her body rested. One of these crosses was erected  at the west end of Cheapside. After the Reformation the images with which  the cross was ornamented, like the image of Becket set over the gate of  the Mercers' Chapel, roused the anger of the iconoclast, who took delight  in defacing them.    (M203)    Time only increased the king's pecuniary difficulties. In February, 1292,  all freeholders of land of the annual value of L40 were ordered to receive  knighthood, and in the following January the estates of defaulters were  seized by the king's orders.(320) In June, 1294, war was declared against  France. Money must be had. Every monastery and every church throughout  England was ransacked for treasure, and the sum of L2,000, found in St.  Paul's Church, was appropriated for the public service.(321) The dean was  seized with a fit (_subita percussus passione_) and died in the king's  presence.(322)    (M204)    Instead of invading France, Edward found his own shores devastated by a  French fleet, whilst at the same time his hands were full with fresh  difficulties from Scotland and Wales. In the summer of 1295, the city  furnished the king with three ships, the cost being defrayed by a tax of  twopence in the pound charged on chattels and merchandise. John le Breton,  then warden, advanced the sum of L40, which the aldermen and six men of  each ward undertook to repay.(323) In the following year (1296) the city  agreed, after some little hesitation, to furnish forty men with  caparisoned horses, and fifty arbalesters for the defence of the south  coast, under the king's son, Edward of Carnarvon.(324)    (M205)    Edward again turned his attention to Scotland, and, having succeeded in  reducing Balliol to submission, he carried off from Scone the stone which  legend identifies with Jacob's pillow, and on which the Scottish kings had  from time immemorial been crowned,(325) By Edward's order the stone was  enclosed in a stately seat, and placed in Westminster Abbey, where it has  since served as the coronation chair of English sovereigns.    (M206)    From Berwick Edward issued (26 Aug., 1296,) writs for a Parliament to meet  at Bury St. Edmund's, in the following November. The constitution of this  Parliament was the same as that which had met at Westminster in November  of the previous year (1295) and which was intended to serve as a model  parliament, a pattern for all future national assemblies. The city was  represented by two aldermen, namely, Sir Stephen Aswy, or Eswy, who had  been confined in Windsor Castle ten years before for his conduct towards  the king's justiciars at the Tower, and Sir William de Hereford.(326) From  this time forward down to the present day we have little difficulty in  discovering from one source or another the names of the city's  representatives in successive parliaments. Edward, of course, wanted  money. The barons and knights increased their former grants; so also did  the burgesses. The clergy, on the other hand, declared themselves unable  to make any grant at all in the face of a papal prohibition,(327) and the  king was at last driven to seize the lay fees of the clergy of the  province of Canterbury. In the spring of the following year he proceeded  to seize all the wool of the country, paying for it by tallies, and to  levy a supply of provisions on the counties. The act was only justifiable  on the plea of necessity, and led to measures being taken to prevent its  repetition.(328)    (M207)    It was an easier matter for Edward to raise money than to get the barons  to accompany him abroad. To leave them behind was to risk the peace of the  country. He therefore spared no efforts to persuade them to join in a  projected expedition, and when persuasion failed tried threats. It was his  desire that the barons should go to Gascony, whilst he took the command in  Flanders. This was not at all to the taste of the barons, who declined to  go abroad, except in the personal retinue of the king himself. \"With you,  O king,\" said Roger Bigod, \"I will gladly go; as belongs to me by  hereditary right, I will go in front of the host, before your face;\" but  without the king he positively declined to move. \"By God, earl,\" cried the  king, fairly roused by the obstinacy of his vassal, \"you shall either go  or hang;\" to which the earl replied, with equal determination, \"By the  same token, O king, I will neither go nor hang.\"(329)    Nothing daunted, the king issued writs (15 May) for a military levy of the  whole kingdom for service abroad, to meet at London on the 7th July, a  measure as unconstitutional as the seizure of wool and the levying of  taxes without the assent of Parliament. On the day appointed, the barons,  who had received a large accession of strength from the great vassals,  appeared with their forces at St. Paul's; but instead of complying with  the king's demands--or rather requests, for the king had altered his  tone--they prepared a list of their grievances.    (M208)    With difficulty civil war was avoided, and in August Edward set sail for  Flanders. No sooner was his back turned, than the barons and the Londoners  made common cause in insisting upon a confirmation and amplification of  their charters.(330) Prince Edward, the king's son, who had been appointed  regent in his father's absence, granted all that was asked, and on the  10th October (1297), the _Confirmatio Cartarum_, as it was called, was  issued in the king's name.(331) Thenceforth, no customs duties were to be  exacted without the consent of parliament.    (M209)    In view of the king's return to England in March (1298), the warden of the  city, Sir John Breton, the aldermen, and a deputation from the wards met  together and resolved that every inhabitant of the city, citizen and  stranger, should pay to the king's collectors the sum of sixpence in the  pound of all their goods up to L100.(332) In the following month Edward  issued letters patent (11th April), restoring to the citizens their  franchises and the right of again electing their mayor.(333) The choice of  the citizens fell upon Henry le Waleys, who was duly admitted by the  Barons of the Exchequer after presentation to the king.(334)    (M210)    In the summer Edward marched to Scotland for the purpose of putting down  the rising under Wallace. An account of the battle of Falkirk, fought on  the 22nd July, was conveyed to the mayor, aldermen, and \"barons\" of  London, by letter from Walter Langton, Bishop of Lichfield and Coventry,  or, as he was then styled, Bishop of Chester, who wrote as an eye-witness,  if not indeed as a partaker in that day's work.(335) It was the first  battle of any consequence in which the English long-bow was brought into  prominence. Edward's victory was complete. The enemy's loss was great, the  number that perished, according to the bishop's information, being two  hundred men-at-arms and twenty thousand foot soldiers. Edward was unable,  however, to follow up his success for want of supplies, and so retreated.  In 1304, he again marched northward, notwithstanding the defection of many  nobles. He had previously resorted once more to the questionable practice  of talliaging the city of London,(336) levying from the citizens the  fifteenth penny of their moveable goods and the tenth penny of their  rents.(337) The campaign was eminently successful. Sterling surrendered  after a siege of two months, and Wallace himself shortly afterwards fell  into his hands, having refused the terms of an amnesty which Edward had  generously offered.    (M211)    He was carried to London, where a crowd of men and women flocked out to  meet one, of whose gigantic stature and feats of strength they had heard  so much. He was lodged in the house of William de Leyre, an alderman of  the city, situate in the parish of All Hallows at the Hay or All Hallows  the Great. Having been tried at Westminster and condemned to death on  charges of treason, sacrilege and robbery, he was hanged, drawn, and  quartered, and his head set up on London Bridge.(338)    (M212)    No sooner was Wallace disposed of than another claimant to the Scottish  crown appeared in the person of Bruce. Before Edward took the field  against the new foe, he conferred knighthood upon his son and nearly three  hundred others, including John le Blound the mayor. The number of knights  within the small compass of the city was reckoned at that time to be not  less than a thousand.(339) Knighthood, as we have seen, was one of the  means Edward resorted to for raising money, and on this occasion the  citizens of London are said to have made him a free gift of L2,000, in  recognition of the honour bestowed on their mayor.(340)    (M213) "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19826"],[0,"The White Christmas and other Merry Christmas Plays (#20)"],[1," in Act I rattle a large sheet of sheet-iron and  explode several large fire-crackers.

For the back of the suit do not cut the waist  part separate from the legs, as is usual in the pattern, but allow the  waist to be as wide as the seat of the drawers.    Then lay a pleat from A to B on either side, tapering to form a loose  fit below the waist. Sew thumbless mittens to the ends of the sleeves,  padding them a little on the back and sewing on palms of a light tan,  to represent paws.    [Illustration: Fig. 2]    Fit the seat of the drawers at the back loose enough to give freedom  of motion, but no more.    For the heads, cut hoods like Fig. 3, taking a straight piece of cloth  and fitting it with pleats around the face, etc. Make ears of two  thicknesses of the cloth, stitched and turned like Fig. 4. Lay a  box-pleat at A-B and sew them to the hood at C-D, so that they will  stand out and forward. See Fig. 5. Sew this hood to the neck of the  suit, so that all goes on together. Bear false faces.    [Illustration: Fig. 3]    [Illustration: Fig. 4]    [Illustration: Fig. 5]    BABY JUMBO--Two medium sized boys form the elephant.

Attach strings at A and tie to the first crosspiece of the rack. Pad  the rack with an old comfort sewed fast with cord to hold it in place.    [Illustration: Fig. 6]    Set the rack on the boy's shoulders, then standing with heads bent  forward, the foremost boy supporting the elephant's head with his head  and slipping his right hand into the upper part of the trunk so as to  swing it. Throw over them a large, dark-colored shawl, reaching to  their knees, fasten it together in the back and pin on a tail made of  cambric and stuffed. Legs covered with brown burlap.
