Verily, I read thy letter sent by thee and was rejoiced in heart by the  wonderful meaning and eloquent content, which proved thy extreme sincerity  in the Cause of God, thy steadfastness in the path of the Kingdom of God  and thy firmness in the religion of God, forasmuch as this is of the  utmost importance before God.    How many souls advanced unto God, entered the shadow of the Word of God  and became celebrated in the world, as Judas Iscariot. Then, when the  tests became severe and trials great, their feet turned from the path;  turned from confession to denial; changed from love and affection to  severe enmity. Then the power of tests, whereby the foundations shake,  were manifested.    Judas Iscariot was one of the greatest disciples, was called unto Jesus;  he thought that Jesus increased his kindness to Peter, the disciple, when  saying to him: \"Thou art Peter; upon thee I shall build my church.\" This  speech affecting Peter with special impression whereby envy was created in  the heart of Judas and, therefore, he turned after advancing, denied after  confessing, hated after loving, until he became the cause of the  crucifixion of the Glorious Lord and Manifest Light. This is the end of  envy which causes people to turn from the right path. Such has taken place  and will occur in this Great Cause; but there is no harm in it, as it is  the cause of manifesting the firmness of the rest and the arising of the  firm souls who are as solid as the lofty mountains in the love of the  Manifest Light.    As to thee, convey unto the maid-servants of the Merciful that they must  be firm in the love of El-Baha at the time of the severe trials and tests;  forasmuch as the storms and winds occur during the winter seasons; then  comes the spring with the wonderful scenery and it adorns the hills and  plains with flowers and beautiful birds sing the melodies of joy on the  branches of the trees and warble beautiful tunes on the roofs of bowers,  in wonderful melodies. Soon shalt thou see that the lights have shone  forth, the banners of the Kingdom have been raised, the fragrances of God  diffused, the hosts of the Kingdom descending, the angels of heaven  confirmed and the Holy Spirit breathed into those horizons (regions). Then  shalt thou see the waverers frightened and at loss. This is a complete  matter on the part of the Lord of Signs.    Blessed art thou for keeping firm in the Cause of God. I pray God to give  thee a divine spirit, spiritual blood and to make thee a growing and  thriving leaf on the Tree of Life, so that thou mayest serve the  maid-servants of God in fragrance and spirituality.    Thy generous Lord will confirm thee in serving in His great vineyard and  will make thee an instrument for spreading the spirit of concord and union  among the maid-servants of the Merciful, will open thine insight by the  light of knowledge and forgive thee thy sins and change them to good  deeds.    Verily thy Lord is the Forgiving, the Merciful and Possessor of Great  Bounty!          \"O maid-servant of God who art swayed like a strong...\"      O maid-servant of God who art swayed like a strong branch by the breeze of  God!    I have read thy letter which evinces the abundance of thy love and the  warmth of thy devotion and thy zeal in acknowledging God.    Commit thyself to God; give up thy will and choose that of God; abandon  thy desire and lay hold on that of God; that thou mayest be a holy,  spiritual and heavenly example among the maid-servants of God.    O maid-servant of God! Know thou that in the sight of God, the conduct of  women is the same as that of men. All are the creatures of God and He has  created them after His form and likeness; that is to say, after the form  and likeness of the Manifestations of His names and His attributes. From  the spiritual point of view, therefore, there is no difference between  women and men. \"The nearer we draw to God, the nearer He comes to us\"  without regard to whether the person be a man or a woman. How many women,  thus drawn to God, have surpassed men in the shadow of Baha' in bringing  men under it--women famous throughout the world!    The House of Justice, however, according to the positive commandments of  the Doctrine of God, has been specialized to the men, for a (specific)  reason or exercise of wisdom on the part of God, and this reason will  presently appear, even as the sun at midday.    And as to you--you other maid-servants attracted by the perfume of  God--establish spiritual gatherings (assemblies) and heavenly meetings.  This work is the beginning of the diffusing of the perfume of God and the  foundation of the elevating of the Word of God and the making known of the  commandments of God. Is there a blessing greater than this? These  spiritual gatherings (assemblies) are sustained (reinforced) by the Spirit  of God, and their protector is Abdul-Baha, who spreads his wings (over)  above them. Is there a blessing greater than this? These spiritual  gatherings (assemblies) are glowing lamps and heavenly gardens which cast  the light of knowledge upon the contingent world and cause the spirit of  life to penetrate to every quarter. This, then, is the best means of the  progress of the human race in all conditions and circumstances. Is there a  greater blessing than this?          \"O thou who art attracted by the Fragrances of God!...\"      O thou who art attracted by the Fragrances of God!    Verily, I read thy beautifully composed letter and thank God for that He  granted thee characteristics, attributes and deeds which made thee dear  and loved by the maid-servants of God and chosen to be the president of  the \"Assembly of Teaching.\" Thank God for that He confirmed thee by this  wonderful bounty, and, verily, I supplicate unto Him to strengthen thee in  rendering this great service in His great vineyard, and to strengthen thy  respected husband in patience and forbearance in this test which will pass  away, by the help of God, and the veil be removed; difficulty will be  replaced by ease; hardships and trouble be changed into comfort, in the  shadow of His great Kingdom.          \"O thou dear maid-servant of God!...\"      O thou dear maid-servant of God!    Thank God that thou hast come near unto the Holy Threshold and art dear in  the Kingdom of His Glory. Thou art president of an assembly which is a  type of the assemblages of the Supreme Concourse and a reflection of the  semblances of the Kingdom of God. With heart and soul, with entire  devotion, supplication, humbleness and submissiveness, endeavor to  promulgate the law of God and strive to diffuse the fragrances of God.  Exert yourself to become the real president of assemblies of spiritual  ones and a companion of the Kingdom of the Merciful.    Thou hast asked in regard to the 10th verse of the 21st chapter of  Revelation and to the 17th verse:    Know that the firmament of the bright sun of the world of possibilities is  divided into twelve sections, according to mathematical principles, which  are called the twelve constellations; likewise, the Sun of Truth manifests  and pours forth His bounty in twelve constellations of holiness. By these  constellations are meant holy souls who are the manifestations of purity  and the dawning-points of the lights of Unity. Observe that in the day of  His Holiness the Speaker of God (Moses), there were twelve holy souls who  were the leaders of the Truth. In like manner, in the cycle of His  Holiness the Spirit (Jesus Christ), note that there were twelve apostles  under the shadow of the light of the Most High, and the Sun of Truth was  manifested through those bright dawning-places like unto the phenomenal  sun. Likewise, in the time of His Holiness Mohammed, consider that there  were twelve dawning points of holiness who were the manifestations of  confirmation. Such is the case.    Accordingly, St. John, the divine, declared in his vision regarding the  twelve doors and the twelve foundations. By the great and holy city of  Jerusalem, which is descended from heaven, is meant the sacred law of God.  This subject has been repeatedly explained in many Tablets and in the  Scriptures of the ancient prophets. For example, it is said in one place:  \"I beheld Jerusalem marching on to the wilderness.\" The purport is that  this Heavenly Jerusalem has twelve doors through which the advancing souls  enter into the City of God. These doors are the souls who are the stars of  guidance and doors unto bounty and knowledge. \"At the gates twelve angels  stood.\" By \"angel\" is meant the power of the confirmation of God; that the  candle of the power of the divine confirmation shines forth and is  illumined in those souls. That is to say, that each one of those souls  will be confirmed by the mightiest power. Those twelve gates surround the  whole universe. This signifies that all existence is under the shadow of  those souls; also, that these doors are the foundation of the city of God,  the divine Jerusalem; that upon each of these foundations the name of one  of the Apostles of His Holiness the Spirit(59) is written. That is to say,  the manifestation of the perfections, glad-tidings, virtues and high  attributes of that holy soul.    In brief, it is said that: \"And he that talked with me had a golden rod to  measure the city and the gates thereof and the walls thereof.\" The purport  is this, that certain souls guided (people) with a rod of the plant, that  is, a reed wherewith he shepherded the sheep, like unto the rod of Moses;  other trained (the people) with a rod of iron and drove them, as in the  time of Mohammed (The scepter of Mohammed was the sword).

The troops wild with enthusiasm and  tremendously cheering especially as they passed the warships of our  Allies.    _Nunc Dimittis_, O Lord of Hosts! Not a man but knows he is making for  the jaws of death. They know, these men do, they are being asked to  prove their enemies to have lied when they swore a landing on  Gallipoli's shore could never make good. They know that lie must pass  for truth until they have become targets to guns, machine guns and  rifles--huddled together in boats, helpless, plain to the enemy's sight.  And they are wild with joy; uplifted! Life spins superbly through their  veins at the very moment they seek to sacrifice it for a cause. O death,  where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory?    A shadow has been cast over the wonders of the day by a wireless to say  that Rupert Brooke is very dangerously ill--from the wording we fear  there can be no hope.    Dent, principal Naval Transport Officer, left to-day to get ready.  Wemyss said good-bye on going to take up command of his Squadron.    Have got d'Amade's revised orders for the landing at Kum Kale and also  for the feint at Besika Bay. Very clear and good.    At 7.15 p.m. we got this message from K.:--    \"Please communicate the following messages at a propitious moment to  each of those concerned.    \"(1) My best wishes to you and all your force in carrying to a  successful conclusion the operations you have before you, which will  undoubtedly have a momentous effect on the war. The task they have to  perform will need all the grit Britishers have never failed to show, and  I am confident your troops will victoriously clear the way for the Fleet  to advance on Constantinople.    \"(2) Convey to the Admiral my best wishes that all success may attend  the Fleet. The Army knows they can rely on their energy and effective  co-operation while dealing with the land forces of the enemy.    \"(3) Assure General d'Amade and the French troops of our entire  confidence that their courage and skill will result in the triumph of  their arms.    \"(End of message)--\" Personal:    \"All my thoughts will be with you when operations begin.\"    We, here, think of Lord K. too. May his shadow fall dark upon the  Germans and strike the fear of death into their hearts.    Just got following from the Admiral:--                                                \"H.M.S. _Queen Elizabeth_,                                                   \"_23rd April, 1915._      \"My dear General,    \"I have sent orders to all Admirals that operations are to proceed and  they are to take the necessary measures to have their commands in their  assigned positions by Sunday morning, April 25th!    \"I pray that the weather may be favourable and nothing will prevent our  proceeding with the scheme. 'May heaven's light be our guide' and God  give us the victory.    \"Think everything is ready and in some ways the delay has been useful,  as we have now a few more lighters and tugs available.                            \"Yours sincerely,                              (_Sd._) \"J.

Straightaway he will be buried. The rest is  silence.    Twice was \"the sight\" vouchsafed me:--in London when I told Eddie I  would bespeak the boy's services; at Port Said when I bespoke them.    Death on the eve of battle, death on a wedding day--nothing so tragic  save that most black mishap, death in action after peace has been  signed. Death grins at my elbow. I cannot get him out of my thoughts. He  is fed up with the old and sick--only the flower of the flock will serve  him now, for God has started a celestial spring cleaning, and our star  is to be scrubbed bright with the blood of our bravest and our best.    Youth and poetry are the links binding the children of the world to come  to the grandsires of the world that was. War will smash, pulverise,  sweep into the dustbins of eternity the whole fabric of the old world:  therefore, the firstborn in intellect must die. Is _that_ the reading of  the riddle?    Almighty God, Watchman of the Milky Way, Shepherd of the Golden Stars,  have mercy upon us, smallest of the heavenly Shiners. Our star burns dim  as a corpse light: the huge black chasm of space closes in: if only by  blood ...? Thy Will be done. _En avant_--at all costs--_en avant_!          CHAPTER V    THE LANDING      _24th April, 1915. H.M.S. \"Queen Elizabeth.\" Tenedos._ Boarded the Queen  Lizzie at 1.30 p.m. Anchored off Tenedos just before 4 p.m. Lay outside  the roadstead; close by us is the British Fleet with an Armada of  transports,--all at anchor. As we were closing up to them we spotted a  floating mine which must have been passed touch-and-go during the night  by all those warships and troopships. A good omen surely that not one of  them fell foul of the death that lurks in that ugly, horned devil--not  dead itself, but very much alive, for it answered a shot from one of our  three pounders with the dull roar and spitting of fire and smoke bred  for our benefit by the kindly German Kultur.    I hope I may sleep to-night. I think so. If not, my wakefulness will  wish the clock's hand forward.    _25th April, 1915. H.M.S. \"Queen Elizabeth.\"_ Our _Queen_ chose the cold  grey hour of 4 a.m. to make her war toilette. By 4.15 she had sunk the  lady and put on the man of war. Gone were the gay companions; closed the  tight compartments and stowed away under armour were all her furbelows  and frills. In plain English, our mighty battleship was cleared for  action, and--my mind--that also has now been cleared of its everyday  lumber: and I am ready.    If this is a queer start for me, so it is also for de Robeck. In sea  warfare, the Fleet lies in the grip of its Admiral like a platoon in the  hands of a Subaltern. The Admiral sees; speaks the executive word and  the whole Fleet moves; not, as with us, each Commander carrying out the  order in his own way, but each Captain steaming, firing, retiring to the  letter of the signal. In the Navy the man at the gun, the man at the  helm, the man sending up shells in the hoist has no discretion unless  indeed the gear goes wrong, and he has to use his wits to put it right  again. With us the infantry scout, a boy in his teens perhaps, may have  to decide whether to open fire, to lie low or to fall back; whether to  bring on a battle or avoid it. But the Fleet to-day is working like an  army; the ships are widely scattered each one on its own, except in so  far as wireless may serve, and that is why I say de Robeck is working  under conditions just as unusual to him as mine are to me.    My station is up in the conning tower with de Robeck. The conning tower  is a circular metal chamber, like a big cooking pot. Here we are, all  eyes, like potatoes in the cooking pot aforesaid, trying to peep through  a slit where the lid is raised a few inches, _ad hoc_, as these blasted  politicians like to say. My Staff are not with me in this holy of  holies, but are stowed away in steel towers or jammed into 6-inch  batteries.    So we kept moving along and at 4.30 a.m. were off Sedd-el-Bahr. All  quiet and grey. Thence we steamed for Gaba Tepe and midway, about 5  o'clock, heard a very heavy fire from Helles behind us. The Turks are  putting up some fight. Now we are off Gaba Tepe!    The day was just breaking over the jagged hills; the sea was glassy  smooth; the landing of the lads from the South was in full swing; the  shrapnel was bursting over the water; the patter of musketry came  creeping out to sea; we are in for it now; the machine guns muttered as  through chattering teeth--up to our necks in it now. But would we be out  of it? No; not one of us; not for five hundred years stuffed full of  dullness and routine.    By 5.35 the rattle of small arms quieted down; we heard that about 4,000  fighting men had been landed; we could see boat-loads making for the  land; swarms trying to straighten themselves out along the shore; other  groups digging and hacking down the brushwood. Even with our glasses  they did not look much bigger than ants. God, one would think, cannot  see them at all or He would put a stop to this sort of panorama  altogether. And yet, it would be a pity if He missed it; for these  fellows have been worth the making. They are not charging up into this  Sari Bair range for money or by compulsion. They fight for love--all the  way from the Southern Cross for love of the old country and of liberty.  Wave after wave of the little ants press up and disappear. We lose sight  of them the moment they lie down. Bravo! every man on our great ship  longs to be with them. But the main battle called. The Admiral was keen  to take me when and where the need might most arise. So we turned South  and steamed slowly back along the coast to Cape Helles.    Opposite Krithia came another great moment. We have made good the  landing--sure--it is a fact. I have to repeat the word to myself several  times, \"fact,\" \"fact,\" \"fact,\" so as to be sure I am awake and standing  here looking at live men through a long telescope. The thing seems  unreal; as though I were in a dream, instead of on a battleship. To see  words working themselves out upon the ground; to watch thoughts move  over the ground as fighting men....!    Both Battalions, the Plymouth and the K.O.S.B.s, had climbed the high  cliff without loss; so it was signalled; there is no firing; the Turks  have made themselves scarce; nothing to show danger or stress;"]]]
