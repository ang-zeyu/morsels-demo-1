He  looked at Ann. Then he looked at Bartling again.    \"I think there's some mistake,\" he said. \"My name is Bayliss.\"    Before his stony eye the immaculate Bartling wilted. It was a  perfectly astounding likeness, but it was apparent to him when  what he had ever heard and read about doubles came to him. He was  confused. He blushed. It was deuced bad form going up to a  perfect stranger like this and pretending you knew him. Probably  the chappie thought he was some kind of a confidence johnnie or  something. It was absolutely rotten! He continued to blush till  one could have fancied him scarlet to the ankles. He backed away,  apologising in ragged mutters. Jimmy was not insensible to the  pathos of his suffering acquaintance's position; he knew Reggie  and his devotion to good form sufficiently well to enable him to  appreciate the other's horror at having spoken to a fellow to  whom he had never been introduced; but necessity forbade any  other course. However Reggie's soul might writhe and however  sleepless Reggie's nights might become as a result of this  encounter, he was prepared to fight it out on those lines if it  took all summer. And, anyway, it was darned good for Reggie to  get a jolt like that every once in a while. Kept him bright and  lively.    So thinking, he turned to Ann again, while the crimson Bartling  tottered off to restore his nerve centres to their normal tone at  some other hostelry. He found Ann staring amazedly at him, eyes  wide and lips parted.    \"Odd, that!\" he observed with a light carelessness which he  admired extremely and of which he would not have believed himself  capable. \"I suppose I must be somebody's double. What was the  name he said?\"    \"Jimmy Crocker!\" cried Ann.    Jimmy raised his glass, sipped, and put it down.    \"Oh yes, I remember. So it was. It's a curious thing, too, that  it sounds familiar. I've heard the name before somewhere.\"    \"I was talking about Jimmy Crocker on the ship. That evening on  deck.\"    Jimmy looked at her doubtfully.    \"Were you? Oh yes, of course. I've got it now. He is the man you  dislike so.\"    Ann was still looking at him as if he had undergone a change into  something new and strange.    \"I hope you aren't going to let the resemblance prejudice you  against _me_?\" said Jimmy. \"Some are born Jimmy Crockers, others  have Jimmy Crockers thrust upon them. I hope you'll bear in mind  that I belong to the latter class.\"    \"It's such an extraordinary thing.\"    \"Oh, I don't know. You often hear of doubles. There was a man in  England a few years ago who kept getting sent to prison for  things some genial stranger who happened to look like him had  done.\"    \"I don't mean that. Of course there are doubles. But it is  curious that you should have come over here and that we should  have met like this at just this time. You see, the reason I went  over to England at all was to try to get Jimmy Crocker to come  back here.\"    \"What!\"    \"I don't mean that _I_ did. I mean that I went with my uncle and  aunt, who wanted to persuade him to come and live with them.\"    Jimmy was now feeling completely out of his depth.    \"Your uncle and aunt? Why?\"    \"I ought to have explained that they are his uncle and aunt, too.  My aunt's sister married his father.\"    \"But--\"    \"It's quite simple, though it doesn't sound so. Perhaps you  haven't read the _Sunday Chronicle_ lately? It has been publishing  articles about Jimmy Crocker's disgusting behaviour in  London--they call him Piccadilly Jim, you know--\"    In print, that name had shocked Jimmy. Spoken, and by Ann, it was  loathly. Remorse for his painful past tore at him.    \"There was another one printed yesterday.\"    \"I saw it,\" said Jimmy, to avert description.    \"Oh, did you? Well, just to show you what sort of a man Jimmy  Crocker is, the Lord Percy Whipple whom he attacked in the club  was his very best friend. His step-mother told my aunt so. He  seems to be absolutely hopeless.\" She smiled. \"You're looking  quite sad, Mr. Bayliss. Cheer up! You may look like him, but you  aren't him he?--him?--no, 'he' is right. The soul is what counts.  If you've got a good, virtuous, Algernonish soul, it doesn't  matter if you're so like Jimmy Crocker that his friends come up  and talk to you in restaurants. In fact, it's rather an  advantage, really. I'm sure that if you were to go to my aunt and  pretend to be Jimmy Crocker, who had come over after all in a fit  of repentance, she would be so pleased that there would be  nothing she wouldn't do for you. You might realise your ambition  of being adopted by a millionaire. Why don't you try it? I won't  give you away.\"    \"Before they found me out and hauled me off to prison, I should  have been near you for a time. I should have lived in the same  house with you, spoken to you--!\" Jimmy's voice shook.    Ann turned her head to address an imaginary companion.    \"You must listen to this, my dear,\" she said in an undertone. \"He  speaks _wonderfully!_ They used to call him the Boy Orator in his  home-town. Sometimes that, and sometimes Eloquent Algernon!\"    Jimmy eyed her fixedly. He disapproved of this frivolity.    \"One of these days you will try me too high--!\"    \"Oh, you didn't hear what I was saying to my friend, did you?\"  she said in concern. \"But I meant it, every word. I love to hear  you talk. You have such _feeling!_\"    Jimmy attuned himself to the key of the conversation.    \"Have you no sentiment in you?\" he demanded.    \"I was just warming up, too! In another minute you would have  heard something worth while. You've damped me now. Let's talk  about my lifework again.\"    \"Have you thought of anything?\"    \"I'd like to be one of those fellows who sit in offices, and sign  checks, and tell the office-boy to tell Mr. Rockerfeller they can  give him five minutes. But of course I should need a check-book,  and I haven't got one. Oh well, I shall find something to do all  right. Now tell me something about yourself. Let's drop the  future for awhile.\"              *       *       *       *       *      An hour later Jimmy turned into Broadway. He walked pensively,  for he had much to occupy his mind. How strange that the Petts  should have come over to England to try to induce him to return  to New York, and how galling that, now that he was in New York,  this avenue to a prosperous future was closed by the fact that  something which he had done five years ago--that he could  remember nothing about it was quite maddening--had caused Ann to  nurse this abiding hatred of him. He began to dream tenderly of  Ann, bumping from pedestrian to pedestrian in a gentle trance.    From this trance the seventh pedestrian aroused him by uttering  his name, the name which circumstances had compelled him to  abandon.    \"Jimmy Crocker!\"    Surprise brought Jimmy back from his dreams to the hard  world--surprise and a certain exasperation. It was ridiculous to be  incognito in a city which he had not visited in five years and to  be instantly recognised in this way by every second man he met.  He looked sourly at the man. The other was a sturdy,  square-shouldered, battered young man, who wore on his homely  face a grin of recognition and regard. Jimmy was not particularly  good at remembering faces, but this person's was of a kind which  the poorest memory might have recalled. It was, as the  advertisements say, distinctively individual. The broken nose,  the exiguous forehead, and the enlarged ears all clamoured for  recognition. The last time Jimmy had seen Jerry Mitchell had been  two years before at the National Sporting Club in London, and,  placing him at once, he braced himself, as a short while ago he  had braced himself to confound immaculate Reggie.    \"Hello!\" said the battered one.    \"Hello indeed!\" said Jimmy courteously. \"In what way can I  brighten your life?\"    The grin faded from the other's face. He looked puzzled.    \"You're Jimmy Crocker, ain't you?\"    \"No. My name chances to be Algernon Bayliss.\"    Jerry Mitchell reddened.    \"'Scuse me. My mistake.\"    He was moving off, but Jimmy stopped him. Parting from Ann had  left a large gap in his life, and he craved human society.    \"I know you now,\" he said. \"You're Jerry Mitchell. I saw you  fight Kid Burke four years ago in London.\"    The grin returned to the pugilist's face, wider than ever. He  beamed with gratification.    \"Gee! Think of that! I've quit since then. I'm working for an old  guy named Pett. Funny thing, he's Jimmy Crocker's uncle that I  mistook you for. Say, you're a dead ringer for that guy! I could  have sworn it was him when you bumped into me. Say, are you doing  anything?\"    \"Nothing in particular.\"    \"Come and have a yarn. There's a place I know just round by  here.\"    \"Delighted.\"    They made their way to the place.    \"What's yours?\" said Jerry Mitchell. \"I'm on the wagon myself,\"  he said apologetically.    \"So am I,\" said Jimmy. \"It's the only way. No sense in always  drinking and making a disgraceful exhibition of yourself in  public!\"    Jerry Mitchell received this homily in silence. It disposed  definitely of the lurking doubt in his mind as to the possibility  of this man really being Jimmy Crocker. Though outwardly  convinced by the other's denial, he had not been able to rid  himself till now of a nebulous suspicion. But this convinced him.  Jimmy Crocker would never have said a thing like that nor would  have refused the offer of alcohol. He fell into pleasant  conversation with him. His mind eased.        CHAPTER IX    MRS. PETT IS SHOCKED    At five o'clock in the afternoon some ten days after her return  to America, Mrs. Pett was at home to her friends in the house on  Riverside Drive. The proceedings were on a scale that amounted to  a reception, for they were not only a sort of official  notification to New York"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/201"],[0,"Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions (Illustrated) (#20)"],[1,"k,\" said my Master; \"try you.\"    Hereon, raising my voice to the uttermost, I addressed the Point as  follows:    \"Silence, silence, contemptible Creature.  You call yourself the All in  All, but you are the Nothing:  your so-called Universe is a mere speck  in a Line, and a Line is a mere shadow as compared with--\"  \"Hush,  hush, you have said enough,\" interrupted the Sphere, \"now listen, and  mark the effect of your harangue on the King of Pointland.\"    The lustre of the Monarch, who beamed more brightly than ever upon  hearing my words, shewed clearly that he retained his complacency; and  I had hardly ceased when he took up his strain again.  \"Ah, the joy,  ah, the joy of Thought!  What can It not achieve by thinking!  Its own  Thought coming to Itself, suggestive of Its disparagement, thereby to  enhance Its happiness! Sweet rebellion stirred up to result in triumph!  Ah, the divine creative power of the All in One!  Ah, the joy, the joy  of Being!\"    \"You see,\" said my Teacher, \"how little your words have done.  So far  as the Monarch understands them at all, he accepts them as his own--for  he cannot conceive of any other except himself--and plumes himself upon  the variety of 'Its Thought' as an instance of creative Power.  Let us  leave this God of Pointland to the ignorant fruition of his  omnipresence and omniscience:  nothing that you or I can do can rescue  him from his self-satisfaction.\"    After this, as we floated gently back to Flatland, I could hear the  mild voice of my Companion pointing the moral of my vision, and  stimulating me to aspire, and to teach others to aspire.  He had been  angered at first--he confessed--by my ambition to soar to Dimensions  above the Third; but, since then, he had received fresh insight, and he  was not too proud to acknowledge his error to a Pupil.  Then he  proceeded to initiate me into mysteries yet higher than those I had  witnessed, shewing me how to construct Extra-Solids by the motion of  Solids, and Double Extra-Solids by the motion of Extra-Solids, and all  \"strictly according to Analogy\", all by methods so simple, so easy, as  to be patent even to the Female Sex.          Section 21.  How I tried to teach the Theory of Three Dimensions                 to my Grandson, and with what success        I awoke rejoicing, and began to reflect on the glorious career before  me.  I would go forth, methought, at once, and evangelize the whole of  Flatland.  Even to Women and Soldiers should the Gospel of Three  Dimensions be proclaimed.  I would begin with my Wife.    Just as I had decided on the plan of my operations, I heard the sound  of many voices in the street commanding silence.  Then followed a  louder voice.  It was a herald's proclamation.  Listening attentively,  I recognized the words of the Resolution of the Council, enjoining the  arrest, imprisonment, or execution of any one who should pervert the  minds of the people by delusions, and by professing to have received  revelations from another World.    I reflected.  This danger was not to be trifled with.  It would be  better to avoid it by omitting all mention of my Revelation, and by  proceeding on the path of Demonstration--which after all, seemed so  simple and so conclusive that nothing would be lost by discarding the  former means.  \"Upward, not Northward\"--was the clue to the whole  proof.  It had seemed to me fairly clear before I fell asleep; and when  I first awoke, fresh from my dream, it had appeared as patent as  Arithmetic; but somehow it did not seem to me quite so obvious now.  Though my Wife entered the room opportunely just at that moment, I  decided, after we had exchanged a few words of commonplace  conversation, not to begin with her.    My Pentagonal Sons were men of character and standing, and physicians  of no mean reputation, but not great in mathematics, and, in that  respect, unfit for my purpose.  But it occurred to me that a young and  docile Hexagon, with a mathematical turn, would be a most suitable  pupil.  Why therefore not make my first experiment with my little  precocious Grandson, whose casual remarks on the meaning of 3^3 had met  with the approval of the Sphere?  Discussing the matter with him, a  mere boy, I should be in perfect safety; for he would know nothing of  the Proclamation of the Council; whereas I could not feel sure that my  Sons--so greatly did their patriotism and reverence for the Circles  predominate over mere blind affection--might not feel compelled to hand  me over to the Prefect, if they found me seriously maintaining the  seditious heresy of the Third Dimension.    But the first thing to be done was to satisfy in some way the curiosity  of my Wife, who naturally wished to know something of the reasons for  which the Circle had desired that mysterious interview, and of the  means by which he had entered the house.  Without entering into the  details of the elaborate account I gave her,--an account, I fear, not  quite so consistent with truth as my Readers in Spaceland might  desire,--I must be content with saying that I succeeded at last in  persuading her to return quietly to her household duties without  eliciting from me any reference to the World of Three Dimensions.  This  done, I immediately sent for my Grandson; for, to confess the truth, I  felt that all that I had seen and heard was in some strange way  slipping away from me, like the image of a half-grasped, tantalizing  dream, and I longed to essay my skill in making a first disciple.    When my Grandson entered the room I carefully secured the door.  Then,  sitting down by his side and taking our mathematical tablets,--or, as  you would call them, Lines--I told him we would resume the lesson of  yesterday.  I taught him once more how a Point by motion in One  Dimension produces a Line, and how a straight Line in Two Dimensions  produces a Square.  After this, forcing a laugh, I said, \"And now, you  scamp, you wanted to make me believe that a Square may in the same way  by motion 'Upward, not Northward' produce another figure, a sort of  extra Square in Three Dimensions.  Say that again, you young rascal.\"    At this moment we heard once more the herald's \"O yes! O yes!\" outside  in the street proclaiming the Resolution of the Council.  Young though  he was, my Grandson--who was unusually intelligent for his age, and  bred up in perfect reverence for the authority of the Circles--took in  the situation with an acuteness for which I was quite unprepared.  He  remained silent till the last words of the Proclamation had died away,  and then, bursting into tears, \"Dear Grandpapa,\" he said, \"that was  only my fun, and of course I meant nothing at all by it; and we did not  know anything then about the new Law; and I don't think I said anything  about the Third Dimension; and I am sure I did not say one word about  'Upward, not Northward', for that would be such nonsense, you know.  How could a thing move Upward, and not Northward?  Upward and not  Northward!  Even if I were a baby, I could not be so absurd as that.  How silly it is!  Ha! ha! ha!\"    \"Not at all silly,\" said I, losing my temper; \"here for example, I take  this Square,\" and, at the word, I grasped a moveable Square, which was  lying at hand--\"and I move it, you see, not Northward but--yes, I move  it Upward--that is to say, not Northward, but I move it somewhere--not  exactly like this, but somehow--\" Here I brought my sentence to an  inane conclusion, shaking the Square about in a purposeless manner,  much to the amusement of my Grandson, who burst out laughing louder  than ever, and declared that I was not teaching him, but joking with  him; and so saying he unlocked the door and ran out of the room.  Thus  ended my first attempt to convert a pupil to the Gospel of Three  Dimensions.          Section 22.  How I then tried to diffuse the Theory                 of Three Dimensions by other means, and of the result        My failure with my Grandson did not encourage me to communicate my  secret to others of my household; yet neither was I led by it to  despair of success.  Only I saw that I must not wholly rely on the  catch-phrase, \"Upward, not Northward\", but must rather endeavour to  seek a demonstration by setting before the public a clear view of the  whole subject; and for this purpose it seemed necessary to resort to  writing.    So I devoted several months in privacy to the composition of a treatise  on the mysteries of Three Dimensions.  Only, with the view of evading  the Law, if possible, I spoke not of a physical Dimension, but of a  Thoughtland whence, in theory, a Figure could look down upon Flatland  and see simultaneously the insides of all things, and where it was  possible that there might be supposed to exist a Figure environed, as  it were, with six Squares, and containing eight terminal Points.  But  in writing this book I found myself sadly hampered by the impossibility  of drawing such diagrams as were necessary for my purpose; for of  course, in our country of Flatland, there are no tablets but Lines, and  no diagrams but Lines, all in one straight Line and only  distinguishable by difference of size and brightness; so that, when I  had finished my treatise (which I entitled, \"Through Flatland to  Thoughtland\") I could not feel certain that many would understand my  meaning.    Meanwhile my life was under a cloud.  All pleasures palled upon me; all  sights tantalized and tempted me to outspoken treason, because I could  not but compare what I saw in Two Dimensions with what it really was if  seen in Three, and could hardly refrain from making my comparisons  aloud.  I neglected my clients and my own business to give myself to  the contemplation of the mysteries which I had once beheld, yet which I  could impart to no one, and found daily more difficult to reproduce  even before my own mental vision.    One day, about eleven months after my return from Spaceland, I tried to  see a"]]]
