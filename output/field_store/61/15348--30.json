He was a different man from the one Vye had  known on Jumala. \"Premium for the Guild is one thousand credits down,  two thousand for training and say another for about the best field  outfit you can buy. That'll give you maybe another two or three  thousand to save for your honorable retirement.\"    \"How did you know?\" Vye began and then had to laugh in spite of  himself as Hume replied:    \"I didn't. Good guess, eh? Well, zoom out your recorder, Commander. I  think you are going to have some very free speech now.\" He got to his  feet. \"You know, the Guild has a stake in this alien discovery. We may  just find that we haven't seen the last of that valley after all,  recruit.\"    He was gone and Vye, eager to have the past done with, and the future  beginning, reached for the dictation mike.           *       *       *       *       *          TWO COMPLETE SPACE ADVENTURE NOVELS    PLANET OF ALIEN MONSTERS....

(Receive, O King, gold.)\"       \"Tolle thus, tu vere Deus. (Accept incense, Thou very God.)\"       \"Myrrham, signum sepulturae. (Myrrh, the sign of burial.)\"    The clergy and people then make their offerings, while the Magi fall  asleep and are warned by an angel to return home another way. This they  do symbolically by proceeding back to the choir by a side aisle.{6}    In its later forms the Epiphany play includes the appearance of Herod,  who is destined to fill a very important place in the mediaeval drama.  Hamlet's saying \"he out-Herods Herod\" sufficiently suggests the raging  tyrant whom the playwrights of the Middle Ages loved. His appearance  marks perhaps the first introduction into the Christian religious play of  the evil principle so necessary to dramatic effect. At first Herod holds  merely a mild conversation with the Magi, begging them to tell him when  they have found the new-born King; in later versions of the play,  however, his wrath is shown on learning that the Wise Men have |127|  departed home by another way; he breaks out into bloodthirsty tirades,  orders the slaying of the Innocents, and in one form takes a sword and  brandishes it in the air. He becomes in fact the outstanding figure in  the drama, and one can understand why it was sometimes named after him.    In the Laon \"Stella\" the actual murder of the Innocents was represented,  the symbolical figure of Rachel weeping over her children being  introduced. The plaint and consolation of Rachel, it should be noted,  seem at first to have formed an independent little piece performed  probably on Holy Innocents' Day.{7} This later coalesced with the  \"Stella,\" as did also the play of the shepherds, and, at a still later  date, another liturgical drama which we must now consider--the  \"Prophetae.\"    This had its origin in a sermon (wrongly ascribed to St. Augustine)  against Jews, Pagans, and Arians, a portion of which was used in many  churches as a Christmas lesson. It begins with a rhetorical appeal to the  Jews who refuse to accept Jesus as the Messiah in spite of the witness of  their own prophets. Ten prophets are made to give their testimony, and  then three Pagans are called upon, Virgil, Nebuchadnezzar and the  Erythraean Sibyl. The sermon has a strongly dramatic character, and when  chanted in church the parts of the preacher and the prophets were  possibly distributed among different choristers. In time it developed  into a regular drama, and more prophets were brought in. It was, indeed,  the germ of the great Old Testament cycles of the later Middle Ages.{8}    An extension of the \"Prophetae\" was the Norman or Anglo-Norman play of  \"Adam,\" which began with the Fall, continued with Cain and Abel, and  ended with the witness of the prophets. In the other direction the  \"Prophetae\" was extended by the addition of the \"Stella.\" It so happens  that there is no text of a Latin drama containing both these extensions  at the same time, but such a play probably existed. From the  mid-thirteenth to the mid-fourteenth century, indeed, there was a  tendency for the plays to run together into cycles and become too long  and too elaborate for performance in church. In the eleventh century,  even, they had begun to pass out into the churchyard or |128| the  market-place, and to be played not only by the clergy but by laymen. This  change had extremely important effects on their character. In the first  place the vulgar tongue crept in. As early, possibly, as the twelfth  century are the Norman \"Adam\" and the Spanish \"Misterio de los Reyes  Magos,\" the former, as we have seen, an extended vernacular \"Prophetae,\"  the latter, a fragment of a highly developed vernacular \"Stella.\" They  are the first of the popular as distinguished from the liturgical plays;  they were meant, as their language shows, for the instruction and delight  of the folk; they were not to be listened to, like the mysterious Latin  of the liturgy, in uncomprehending reverence, but were to be understanded  of the people.    The thirteenth and fourteenth centuries saw a progressive supplanting of  Latin by the common speech, until, in the great cycles, only a few scraps  of the church language were left to tell of the liturgical origin of the  drama. The process of popularization, the development of the plays from  religious ceremonial to lively drama, was probably greatly helped by the  _goliards_ or vagabond scholars, young, poor, and fond of amusement, who  wandered over Europe from teacher to teacher, from monastery to  monastery, in search of learning. Their influence is shown not merely in  the broadening of the drama, but also in its passing from the Latin of  the monasteries to the language of the common folk.    A consequence of the outdoor performance of the plays was that Christmas,  in the northern countries at all events, was found an unsuitable time for  them. The summer was naturally preferred, and we find comparatively few  mentions of plays at Christmas in the later Middle Ages. Whitsuntide and  Corpus Christi became more popular dates, especially in England, and the  pieces then performed were vast cosmic cycles, like the York, Chester,  Towneley, and \"Coventry\" plays, in which the Christmas and Epiphany  episodes formed but links in an immense chain extending from the Creation  to the Last Judgment, and representing the whole scheme of salvation. It  is in these Nativity scenes, however, that we have the only English  renderings of the Christmas story in drama,{9} and though they |129|  were actually performed not at the winter festival[42] but in the summer,  they give in so striking a way the feelings, the point of view, of our  mediaeval forefathers in regard to the Nativity that we are justified in  dealing with them here at some length.    As the drama became laicized, it came to reflect that strange medley of  conflicting elements, pagan and Christian, materialistic and spiritual,  which was the actual religion of the folk, as distinguished from the  philosophical theology of the doctors and councils and the mysticism of  the ascetics. The popularizing of Christianity had reached its climax in  most countries of western Europe in the fifteenth century, approximately  the period of the great \"mysteries.\" However little the ethical teaching  of Jesus may have been acted upon, the Christian religion on its external  side had been thoroughly appropriated by the people and wrought into a  many-coloured polytheism, a true reflection of their minds.    The figures of the drama are contemporaries of the spectators both in  garb and character; they are not Orientals of ancient times, but  Europeans of the end of the Middle Ages. Bethlehem is a \"faier borow,\"  Herod a \"mody king,\" like unto some haughty, capricious, and violent  monarch of the time, the shepherds are rustics of England or Germany or  France or Italy, the Magi mighty potentates with gorgeous trains, and the  Child Himself is a little being subject to all the pains and necessities  of infancy, but delighted with sweet and pleasant things like a bob of  cherries or a ball. The realism of the writers is sometimes astounding,  and comic elements often appear--to the people of the Middle Ages  religion was so real and natural a thing that they could laugh at it  without ceasing to believe in or to love it.    The English mediaeval playwrights, it may safely be said, are surpassed  by no foreigners in their treatment of Christmas subjects. To illustrate  their way of handling the scenes I may |130| gather from the four great  cycles a few of the most interesting passages.    From the so-called \"Ludus Coventriae\" I take the arrival of Joseph and  Mary at Bethlehem; they ask a man in the street where they may find an  inn:--       \"_Joseph._  Heyl, wurchepful sere, and good day!        A ceteceyn of this cyte ye seme to be;      Of herborwe[43] ffor spowse and me I yow pray,        ffor trewly this woman is fful were,                And fayn at reste, sere, wold she be;        We wolde ffulffylle the byddynge of oure emperoure,      ffor to pay tribute, as right is oure,      And to kepe oureselfe ffrom dolowre,                We are come to this cyte.        _Cives._  Sere, ostage in this towne know I non,        Thin wyff and thou in for to slepe;      This cete is besett with pepyl every won,        And yett thei ly withowte fful every strete.        Withinne no walle, man, comyst thou nowth,        Be thou onys[44] withinne the cyte gate;      Onethys[45] in the strete a place may be sowth,        Theron to reste, withowte debate.        _Joseph._  Nay, sere, debate that wyl I nowth;        Alle suche thyngys passyn my powere:      But yitt my care and alle my thought        Is for Mary, my derlynge dere.        A! swete wyff, wat xal we do?        Wher xal we logge this nyght?      Onto the ffadyr of heffne pray we so,        Us to kepe ffrom every wykkyd whyt.        _Cives._  Good man, o word I wyl the sey,        If thou wylt do by the counsel of me;      Yondyr is an hous of haras[46] that stant be the wey,        Amonge the bestys herboryd may ye be. |131|        _Maria._  Now the fadyr of hefne he mut yow yelde!

The Virgin worships the Child, saluting Him  thus:--       \"Hayle my lord God! hayle prince of pees!      Hayle my fadir, and hayle my sone!      Hayle souereyne sege all synnes to sesse!
