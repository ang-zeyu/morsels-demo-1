Sixty he sent on ahead, following with one hundred and forty on  the 15th of January 1664. It was an intensely cold journey, and the  accommodation at night, with one happy exception, proved quite infamous.  On the 3rd of February Lord Carlisle and his _cortege_ found themselves  five versts from Moscow. The 5th of February was fixed for their entry  into the city in all their finery. They were ready on the morning of  that day, awaiting the arrival of the Tsar's escort, but it never came.  Lord Carlisle had sent his cooks on to Moscow to prepare the dinner he  expected to eat in his city-quarters. Nightfall approached, and it was  not till \"half an hour before night\" that the belated messengers  arrived, full of excuses. The ambassador was hungry, cold, and furious,  nor did his anger abate when told he was not to be allowed to enter  Moscow that night, as the Tsar and his ladies were very anxious to  enjoy the spectacle. The return of the cooks from Moscow and the  preparation of dinner, though a mitigation, was no cure for wounded  pride, and Lord Carlisle, calling Marvell to his side, and with his  assistance, concocted a letter in Latin to the Tsar, complaining  bitterly of their ill-treatment _inter fumosi gurgustii sordes et  angustias sine cibo aut potu_, and going so far as to assert that had  anything of the kind happened in England to a foreign ambassador, the  King of England would never have rested until the offence had been  atoned for with the blood of the criminals. When, some forty years  afterwards, Peter the Great asked Queen Anne to chop off the heads of  the rude men who had arrested his ambassador for debt, he had, perhaps,  Marvell's letter before him.    On the 6th of February Lord Carlisle and his suite made their public  entry into Moscow; but so long a time was occupied over the few versts  they had to travel, that it was dusk before the Kremlin was reached.    The formal reception of the ambassador was on the 11th of February.  Marvell was in the ambassador's sledge and carried his credentials upon  a yard of red damask. The titles of the Russian Potentate would, if  printed here, fill half a page. All the Russias, Great, Little, and  White, emperies more than one, dukedoms by the dozen, territories,  countries, and dominions--not all easy to identify on the map, and very  hard to pronounce--were read out in a loud voice by Marvell. At the end  of them came the homely title of the Earl and his offices, \"his  Majesty's Lieutenant in the Counties of Cumberland and Westmorland.\"    The letters read and delivered, the Tsar and his Boyars rose in their  places simultaneously, and their tissue vests made so strange, loud, and  unexpected a noise as to provoke the ever too easily moved risibility  of the Englishmen.[109:1] When Marvell and the rest of them had ceased  from giggling, the Tsar inquired after the health of the king, but the  distance between his Imperial Majesty and Lord Carlisle being too great  for the question to carry, it had to be repeated by those who were  nearer the ambassador, who gravely replied that when he last saw his  master, namely on the 20th of July then last past, he was perfectly  well. To the same question as to the health of \"the desolate widow of  Charles the First,\" Carlisle returned the same cautious answer. He then  read a very long speech in English, which his interpreter turned into  Russian. The same oration was rendered into Latin by Marvell, and  presented. Over Marvell's Latin trouble arose, for the Russians were  bent on taking and giving offence. Marvell had styled the Tsar  _Illustrissimus_ when he ought, so it was alleged, to have called him  _Serenissimus_. Marvell was not a schoolmaster's son, an old scholar of  Trinity, and Milton's assistant as Latin Secretary for nothing. He  prepared a reply which, as it does not lack humour, has a distinct  literary flavour, and is all that came of the embassy, may here be given  at length:--       \"I reply, saith he, that I sent no such paper into the     Embassy-office, but upon the desire of his Tzarskoy Majesty's     Councellor Evan Offonassy Pronchissof, I delivered it to him, not     being a paper of State, nor written in the English Language wherein I     treat, nor put into the hands of the near Boyars and Councellors of     his Tzarskoy majesty, nor subscribed by my self, nor translated into     Russe by my Interpreter, but only as a piece of curiosity, which is     now restored me, and I am possessed of it; so that herein his     Tzarskoy majestie's near Boyars and Councellors are doubtless ill     grounded. But again I say concerning the value of the words     _Illustrissimus_ and _Serenissimus_ compared together, seeing we must     here from affaires of State, fall into Grammatical contests     concerning the Latin tongue; that the word _Serenus_ signifieth     nothing but still and calm; and, therefore, though of late times     adopted into the Titles of great Princes by reason of that benigne     tranquility which properly dwells in the majestick countenance of     great Princes, and that venerable stillness of all the Attendants     that surround them, of which I have seen an excellent example when I     was in the presence of his Tzarskoy majesty, yet is more properly     used concerning the calmness of the weather, or season. So that even     the night is elegantly called _Serena_ by the best Authors, Cicero in     Arato 12, Lucretius i. l. 29. '_Serena nox_'; and upon perusing again     what I have writ in this paper, I finde that I have out of the     customariness of that expression my self near the beginning said, And     that most serene night, &c. Whereas on the contrary _Illustris_ in     its proper derivation and signification expresseth that which is all     resplendent, lightsome, and glorious, as well without as within, and     that not with a secondary but with a primitive and original light.     For if the Sun be, as he is, the first fountain of light, and Poets     in their expressions (as is well known) are higher by much than those     that write in Prose, what else is it when Ovid in the 2. of the     Metamorphoses saith of Phoebus speaking with Phaethon, _Qui terque     quaterque concutiens Illustre caput_, and the Latin Orators, as     Pliny, Ep. 139, when they would say the highest thing that can be     exprest upon any subject, word it thus, _Nihil Illustrius dicere     possum_. So that hereby may appear to his Tzarskoy Majestie's near     Boyars and Counsellors what diminution there is to his Tzarskoy     Majesty (which farr be it from my thoughts) if I appropriate     _Serenissimus_ to my Master and _Illustrissimus_ to Him than which     _nihil dici potest Illustrius_. But because this was in the time of     the purity of the Latin tongue, when the word _Serenus_ was never     used in the Title of any Prince or Person, I shall go on to deale     with the utmost candor, forasmuch as in this Nation the nicety of     that most eloquent language is not so perfectly understood, which     gives occasion to these mistakes. I confess therefore that indeed in     the declination of the Latin tongue, and when there scarce could be     found out words enough to supply the modern ambition of Titles,     Serenissimus as several other words hath grown in fashion for a     compellation of lesser as well as greater Princes, and yet befits     both the one and the other. So there is _Serenissima Respublica     Veneta_, _Serenitates Electoriae_, _Serenitates Regiae_, even as the     word Highness or _Celsitudo_ befits a Duke, a Prince, a King, or an     Emperour, adjoyning to it the respective quality, and so the word     _Illustris_. But suppose it were by modern use (which I deny)     depressed from the undoubted superiority that it had of _Serenus_ in     the purest antiquity, yet being added in the transcendent degree to     the word Emperour, the highest denomination that a Prince is capable     of, it becomes of the same value. So that to interpret     _Illustrissimus_ unto diminution is to find a positive in a     superlative, and in the most orient light to seek for darkness. And I     would, seeing the near Boyars and Counsellors of his Tzarskoy Majesty     are pleased to mention the Title given to his Tzarskoy Majesty by his     Cesarian Majesty, gladly be satisfied by them, whether ever any     Cesarian Majesty writ formerly hither in High-Dutch, and whether then     they styled his Tzarskoy Majesty Durchluchtigste which is the same     with _Illustrissimus_, and which I believe the Caesar hath kept for     Himself. But to cut short, his Royal Majesty hath used the word to     his Tzarskoy Majesty in his Letter, not out of imitation of others,     although even in the Dutch Letter to his Tzarskoy Majesty of 16 June     1663, I finde Durchlauchtigste the same (as I said) with     _Illustrissimus_, but out of the constant use of his own Court,     further joyning before it Most High, Most Potent, and adding after it     Great Lord Emperour, which is an higher Title than any Prince in the     World gives his Tzarskoy Majesty, and as high a Title of honour as     can be given to any thing under the Divinity. For the King my Master     who possesses as considerable Dominions, and by as high and     self-dependent a right as any Prince in the Universe, yet contenting     Himself with the easiest Titles, and satisfying Himself in the     essence of things, doth most willingly give to other Princes the     Titles which are appropriated to them, but to the Tzarskoy Majesties     of Russia his Royal Ancestors, and to his present Tzarskoy Majesty     his Royal Majesty himself, have usually and do gladly pay Titles even     to superfluity out of meer kindness. And upon that reason He added     the word most Illustrious, and so did I use it"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17396"],[0,"The Secret Garden (#20)"],[1,"voice.    \"Because when you were born the garden door was locked and the key was  buried. And it has been locked for ten years.\"    Colin half sat up, turning toward her, leaning on his elbows.    \"What garden door was locked? Who did it? Where was the key buried?\" he  exclaimed as if he were suddenly very much interested.    \"It--it was the garden Mr. Craven hates,\" said Mary nervously. \"He  locked the door. No one--no one knew where he buried the key.\"    \"What sort of a garden is it?\" Colin persisted eagerly.    \"No one has been allowed to go into it for ten years,\" was Mary's  careful answer.    But it was too late to be careful. He was too much like herself. He too  had had nothing to think about and the idea of a hidden garden attracted  him as it had attracted her. He asked question after question. Where was  it? Had she never looked for the door? Had she never asked the  gardeners?    \"They won't talk about it,\" said Mary. \"I think they have been told not  to answer questions.\"    \"I would make them,\" said Colin.    \"Could you?\" Mary faltered, beginning to feel frightened. If he could  make people answer questions, who knew what might happen!    \"Every one is obliged to please me. I told you that,\" he said. \"If I  were to live, this place would sometime belong to me. They all know  that. I would make them tell me.\"    Mary had not known that she herself had been spoiled, but she could see  quite plainly that this mysterious boy had been. He thought that the  whole world belonged to him. How peculiar he was and how coolly he spoke  of not living.    \"Do you think you won't live?\" she asked, partly because she was  curious and partly in hope of making him forget the garden.    \"I don't suppose I shall,\" he answered as indifferently as he had spoken  before. \"Ever since I remember anything I have heard people say I  shan't. At first they thought I was too little to understand and now  they think I don't hear. But I do. My doctor is my father's cousin. He  is quite poor and if I die he will have all Misselthwaite when my father  is dead. I should think he wouldn't want me to live.\"    \"Do you want to live?\" inquired Mary.    \"No,\" he answered, in a cross, tired fashion. \"But I don't want to die.  When I feel ill I lie here and think about it until I cry and cry.\"    \"I have heard you crying three times,\" Mary said, \"but I did not know  who it was. Were you crying about that?\" She did so want him to forget  the garden.    \"I dare say,\" he answered. \"Let us talk about something else. Talk about  that garden. Don't you want to see it?\"    \"Yes,\" answered Mary, in quite a low voice.    \"I do,\" he went on persistently. \"I don't think I ever really wanted to  see anything before, but I want to see that garden. I want the key dug  up. I want the door unlocked. I would let them take me there in my  chair. That would be getting fresh air. I am going to make them open  the door.\"    He had become quite excited and his strange eyes began to shine like  stars and looked more immense than ever.    \"They have to please me,\" he said. \"I will make them take me there and I  will let you go, too.\"    Mary's hands clutched each other. Everything would be  spoiled--everything! Dickon would never come back. She would never again  feel like a missel thrush with a safe-hidden nest.    \"Oh, don't--don't--don't--don't do that!\" she cried out.    He stared as if he thought she had gone crazy!    \"Why?\" he exclaimed. \"You said you wanted to see it.\"    \"I do,\" she answered almost with a sob in her throat, \"but if you make  them open the door and take you in like that it will never be a secret  again.\"    He leaned still farther forward.    \"A secret,\" he said. \"What do you mean? Tell me.\"    Mary's words almost tumbled over one another.    \"You see--you see,\" she panted, \"if no one knows but ourselves--if there  was a door, hidden somewhere under the ivy--if there was--and we could  find it; and if we could slip through it together and shut it behind  us, and no one knew any one was inside and we called it our garden and  pretended that--that we were missel thrushes and it was our nest, and if  we played there almost every day and dug and planted seeds and made it  all come alive--\"    \"Is it dead?\" he interrupted her.    \"It soon will be if no one cares for it,\" she went on. \"The bulbs will  live but the roses--\"    He stopped her again as excited as she was herself.    \"What are bulbs?\" he put in quickly.    \"They are daffodils and lilies and snowdrops. They are working in the  earth now--pushing up pale green points because the spring is coming.\"    \"Is the spring coming?\" he said. \"What is it like? You don't see it in  rooms if you are ill.\"    \"It is the sun shining on the rain and the rain falling on the sunshine,  and things pushing up and working under the earth,\" said Mary. \"If the  garden was a secret and we could get into it we could watch the things  grow bigger every day, and see how many roses are alive. Don't you see?  Oh, don't you see how much nicer it would be if it was a secret?\"    He dropped back on his pillow and lay there with an odd expression on  his face.    \"I never had a secret,\" he said, \"except that one about not living to  grow up. They don't know I know that, so it is a sort of secret. But I  like this kind better.\"    \"If you won't make them take you to the garden,\" pleaded Mary,  \"perhaps--I feel almost sure I can find out how to get in sometime. And  then--if the doctor wants you to go out in your chair, and if you can  always do what you want to do, perhaps--perhaps we might find some boy  who would push you, and we could go alone and it would always be a  secret garden.\"    \"I should--like--that,\" he said very slowly, his eyes looking dreamy. \"I  should like that. I should not mind fresh air in a secret garden.\"    Mary began to recover her breath and feel safer because the idea of  keeping the secret seemed to please him. She felt almost sure that if  she kept on talking and could make him see the garden in his mind as she  had seen it he would like it so much that he could not bear to think  that everybody might tramp into it when they chose.    \"I'll tell you what I _think_ it would be like, if we could go into it,\"  she said. \"It has been shut up so long things have grown into a tangle  perhaps.\"    He lay quite still and listened while she went on talking about the  roses which _might_ have clambered from tree to tree and hung  down--about the many birds which _might_ have built their nests there  because it was so safe. And then she told him about the robin and Ben  Weatherstaff, and there was so much to tell about the robin and it was  so easy and safe to talk about it that she ceased to feel afraid. The  robin pleased him so much that he smiled until he looked almost  beautiful, and at first Mary had thought that he was even plainer than  herself, with his big eyes and heavy locks of hair.    \"I did not know birds could be like that,\" he said. \"But if you stay in  a room you never see things. What a lot of things you know. I feel as if  you had been inside that garden.\"    She did not know what to say, so she did not say anything. He evidently  did not expect an answer and the next moment he gave her a surprise.    \"I am going to let you look at something,\" he said. \"Do you see that  rose-colored silk curtain hanging on the wall over the mantel-piece?\"    Mary had not noticed it before, but she looked up and saw it. It was a  curtain of soft silk hanging over what seemed to be some picture.    \"Yes,\" she answered.    \"There is a cord hanging from it,\" said Colin. \"Go and pull it.\"    Mary got up, much mystified, and found the cord. When she pulled it the  silk curtain ran back on rings and when it ran back it uncovered a  picture. It was the picture of a girl with a laughing face. She had  bright hair tied up with a blue ribbon and her gay, lovely eyes were  exactly like Colin's unhappy ones, agate gray and looking twice as big  as they really were because of the black lashes all round them.    \"She is my mother,\" said Colin complainingly. \"I don't see why she died.  Sometimes I hate her for doing it.\"    \"How queer!\" said Mary.    \"If she had lived I believe I should not have been ill always,\" he  grumbled. \"I dare say I should have lived, too. And my father would not  have hated to look at me. I dare say I should have had a strong back.  Draw the curtain again.\"    Mary did as she was told and returned to her footstool.    \"She is much prettier than you,\" she said, \"but her eyes are just like  yours--at least they are the same shape and color. Why is the curtain  drawn over her?\"    He moved uncomfortably.    \"I made them do it,\" he said. \"Sometimes I don't like to see her looking  at me. She smiles too much when I am ill and miserable. Besides, she is  mine and I don't want every one to see her.\"    There were a few moments of silence and then Mary spoke.    \"What would Mrs. Medlock do if she found out that I had been here?\" she  inquired.    \"She would do as I told her to do,\" he answered. \"And I should tell her  that I wanted you to come here and talk to me every day. I am glad you  came.\"    \"So am I,\" said Mary. \"I will come as often as I can, but\"--she  hesitated--\"I shall have to look every day for the garden door.\"    \"Yes, you must,\" said Colin, \"and you can tell me about it afterward.\"    He lay thinking a few minutes, as he had done before, and then he spoke  again.    \"I think you shall be a secret, too,\" he said. \"I will not tell them  until they find out. I can always send the nurse out of the room and say  that I want to be by myself. Do you know Martha?\"    \"Yes, I know her very well,\" said Mary. \"She waits on me.\"    He nodded his head toward the outer corridor.    \"She is the one who is asleep in the other room. The nurse went away  yesterday to stay all night with her sister and she always makes Martha  attend to me when she wants to go out. Martha"]]]
