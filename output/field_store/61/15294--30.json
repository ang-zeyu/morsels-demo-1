The chief stood looking from the lion to the hunter. \"Ye be  brothers,\" he said, \"ye two; both great men of the hunt; chiefs by  your own right wherever you go.\"    \"When I was young,\" said Mr. Hume, \"I shot lions for the pride of  the victory; but long since I gave that up, and only when a lion  seeks me have I gone out to kill him.\"    \"Ye be brothers,\" said the chief. \"The great one stands alone, for  he is merciful in his strength. The spotted one kills for the love  of killing. He will kill, if the chance comes, many times more than  he can eat. The warrior will slay of his enemies all his spear can  reach. The great one eats and is satisfied. The rest may live till  he be hungry. I know, for I have met him face to face in the path. I  say to him, '''Inkose' (chief), the path is yours.' I have stood  aside, and the 'inkose' has gone on his way in peace.'    \"If you carried a rifle, chief, it might be otherwise. Take the  claws, Venning; we cannot find room for the skin.\"    The claws were cut off, and they returned to the camp for breakfast.        CHAPTER X    A NIGHT IN THE REEDS    It was good to sit around the glowing embers where the buffalo-steak  sizzled and threw out an odour that made their mouths water, good to  sip the hot coffee and to look out upon the great wilderness rising  up to the distant watershed of the lower bank of the Congo. From the  cliff above starlings flew out to seek their feeding-haunts where  the big game fed; and there was a familiar visitor near them in the  black and drab stone-chat, whose scolding chirp they had so often  heard in England among the gorse and bramble. The metallic cry of  guinea-fowl down by the little river had a farm-yard ring; but the  chatter of parrots flying overhead was still new, and so with many  other calls, so that they sat munching in silence, with eyes and  ears too much engaged for speech, even if the buffalo-steak had not  given their mouths other occupation. They saw the vultures speeding  from out the uttermost reach of the blue vault to feed upon the  carcass of the dead monarch, the whereabouts of the feast having  been detected from their distant haunts by a keenness of sight which  for swiftness outdoes wireless telegraphy. They swept on like  frigates of the sky, heads thrust down, and the vast wings seeming  to bear them on without beat or motion.    After breakfast the two boys left the camp for a little hunt on  their own account, while Mr. Hume remained to help the chief cure  the buffalo hide. They struck out down the river, passed the reeds  out of which the lion had sprung, saw the cluster of vultures  standing round the body of the lion, and then they saw a troop of  antelope  grazing in a patch of mimosas. After a careful stalk,  Compton fired, and the herd dashed off together, with the exception  of one, which took its own course at a slower gait.    \"You hit him, Dick.\"    \"Yes; and we'll get him. You go to the left, and I'll keep him away  from the river.\"    The two dashed off, each on his own line, and for several minutes  the stricken animal led them through fairly open country, with every  promise of a speedy run, for it was evidently hard hit. Then, taking  advantage of an old watercourse, it turned to the right, and when  Compton recovered the track he had lost touch with Venning. He gave  a \"coo-ee,\" and then getting a view of the antelope making down to  the water, he turned it with another shot, and sprinted to overtake  it. Yard by yard he gained in this final burst, and shifted his  rifle to his left hand in order to have his right free to use the  hunting-knife. Another effort and he was almost within touch; but  the buck also had a reserve of power, and, gathering its quarters,  it made a couple of bounds, which carried it into the shelter of a  thin sprinkling of reeds. Compton responded, and in a few strides  was so near that he flung himself forward in an effort to get  astride the animal's back. The buck slipped forward, letting him  down, and, when he rose he saw the white tail whisking round a  corner in the reeds. On he dashed down a narrow path, which twisted  and turned so sharply that he could only see a few yards ahead; but  he was never in fault, as when he could not see the game he could  hear it plainly, so he never slackened. The chase went on always  with the prospect of success tantalizingly before him, until at last  he was at fault in a little clearing where the reeds had been beaten  down, and from which there branched several lanes. He stopped to  listen, but the buck had stopped too. Then he searched for the  blood-trail, and, finding it, set off once more, and this time,  after another chase lasting about ten minutes, the buck was  overtaken and despatched. Then he threw himself on his back and  panted for breath. When he had recovered he sat up and wondered, for  his hands and bare arms were bleeding from a number of cuts that  began to smart most painfully. The sharp saw-like edges of the reeds  bad cut into his flesh, and in the excitement he had not noticed the  injuries.  Thanks, however, to the regulations enforced by Mr. Hume,  he carried in the pouches of his belt a little store of quinine,  vaseline, and meat lozenges. He rubbed the vaseline on the cuts,  mopped his face, and felt all right. Then he put his hand to his  mouth and gave a \"coo-ee.\" The call was strangled in the reeds. He  called again, fired off his gun, and waited, but he could hear  nothing but a soft whispering.  The reeds reached above his head,  and he could see nothing but the matted stems around him and the  blue sky overhead. He gave a grunt of impatience, lifted the buck,  hoisted the body on his shoulder, brought the fore legs round on one  side, the hind legs on the other side, and secured them before him  with his handkerchief. Then he stooped for his rifle, and plunged  into a path with the object of tramping straight through to the  outer edge, when he would get his bearings for the camp.    This was more easily intended than carried out; for the reeds closed  in so as to hamper his movements, and in a short time the path ran  into other tracks, which doubled here and there without any decided  direction, and led him into little dens. In one of these there was  the bleached skull of a buffalo, and he sat down on this to  consider.    He got the direction of the sun from the shadows, made a rough guess  at the points of the compass, and then started off again, picking  out a path that seemed wider than the others, and which led in the  right way. After steady tramping, he found himself back at the very  spot where he had killed the antelope. It was a nasty shock, but, in  no way dismayed, he tried to pick up his old spoor, and after a  patient search he hit it off, and went on with a little laugh. He  hesitated when he entered another little open space, but finally  kept on in the same direction, and finding the way easier, stepped  out confidently, although the weight of the buck was beginning to  tell, combined with the closeness of the air in these long aisles.  At last the reeds thinned, and he stepped out into the open. He  slipped the legs of the buck over his head to stretch himself, and  then a little cry of disgust broke from his lips, for the place he  had come to was not the outskirts of the reeds at all, but merely an  open space, larger than any he had met before, with a little grass  mound in the centre. Mounting this, he could see a run of trees in  the distance, and in between a sea of green leaves, giving back  myriad points of light under the rays of the sun. Queer soft noises  came out of the white rows of reeds all around, and from the vast  expanse a continual murmur that was something like the moaning of  the wind in the pines.    He fired his gun off and listened. A faint far-off answer he thought  he heard; but when he fired again he could detect no sound but the  whispering murmur. He cut a couple of stout reeds, fitted one into  the other, tied his handkerchief to the top, and planted the pole on  the mound. Then he placed the buck at the foot of the pole, covered  it with an armful of reeds, took a long look around, and started off  once more. He was resolved to keep straight on, path or no path, but  after a tussle with the serried ranks of reeds, with their razor-  like leaves, he soon gave up that idea as hopeless, and took again  to the paths--going very slowly, and taking his direction at  intervals. But, try as he would, there were the kinks and twists in  the paths which turned him out of his course. The endless game-  tracks formed a worse snare than any he had been in of human  contrivance; and at places, moreover, the ground was boggy, catching  hold of his feet, and exhausting him by the heavy going. Several  times animals broke cover and crashed away unseen. At one spot in  the ooze he saw the form of a huge crocodile, and at another place  the menacing head of a python was reared above the tops of the  reeds, with his forked tongue  flickering about the blunt nose.  These sights, and the sudden snorts from unseen beasts, bred in him  a growing feeling of uneasiness, which in turn weakened his powers  of reasoning,  so that he blundered hither and thither in a sort of  reckless fury, until he went flat, face downwards, in black mud,  that gripped him at every point. If he had struggled he would have  been hopelessly bogged, but luckily he recovered his wits, and set  himself slowly to extricate himself. His left foot was in up to the  knee, and his left arm was sinking each moment, when he steadied  himself and drew his knife. Beaching out, he cut"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17636"],[0,"The Mystery at Putnam Hall: The School Chums' Strange Discovery (#20)"],[1,"soft hat and turned  his face around. Then he uttered a low cry.    \"See anything, Andy?\" whispered Pepper.    \"That man--he's the same fellow--I feel sure of it!\" gasped the  acrobatic youth.    \"What are you talking about?\"    \"That man! Don't you remember how the horse ran away with me and I got  caught in the tree and was knocked unconscious? Don't you remember my  telling how I had seen a man ahead of me just before the accident? Well,  that is the man!\"    \"Are you sure?\"    \"I think so. Of course, I didn't get a very good look at him--I had my  hands full with the horse. But I think that is the man.\"    \"Then maybe he robbed you, Andy!\"    \"Maybe he did.\"    \"Don't say that unless you are sure of it,\" warned Jack. \"It's a serious  accusation and may get you into trouble.\"    \"Oh, I know enough to go slow,\" answered the acrobatic youth.    Ritter and the stranger had turned to the rear of the house and the  watchers saw something passed between them. Then, a minute later, Ritter  turned and hurried off by a back way, while the stranger turned to leave  by the way he had come.    Andy was undecided what to do, and while he still hesitated the man  came through to the front of the house.    \"Hello!\" he cried, as he caught sight of the three cadets. \"What are you  doing here?\"    \"Perhaps we might ask the same question,\" returned Jack, as he saw that  Andy did not know what to say.    \"Have you been following me?\" demanded the man, suspiciously.    \"Why should we follow you?\" asked Pepper.    \"No reason at all, so far as I know. I only asked the question,\" and now  the man tried to speak as carelessly as possible.    \"I saw you come in here a few minutes ago and I followed, because I want  to speak to you,\" said Andy, shoving to the front and eyeing the fellow  closely.    \"What do you wish to speak about?\"    \"Haven't I met you before?\"    At these words the man started, but quickly recovered.    \"I don't think so,\" he answered slowly, looking Andy straight in the  eyes. \"You see, I am a stranger in Cedarville.\"    \"Didn't I meet you in September, on the road back of Putnam Hall  school?\" asked the acrobatic youth, sharply.    \"In September?\" The man shook his head slowly. \"No, I wasn't here in  September--I was in Boston.\"    \"You are sure about that?\" demanded Andy.    \"Certainly I am sure,\" growled the man. \"Do you doubt my word?\"    \"If it wasn't you it was a man who looks very much like you,\" said Andy,  pointedly. \"Will you tell me your name?\"    \"It's none of your business, boy! I never met you, and that settles it.  I'm in a hurry now, I've got to get to Ithaca, so I'll thank you to let  me pass.\" And so speaking the stranger brushed forward. Andy put out his  hand, as if to detain him, but then changed his mind. In a moment more  the man was hurrying down the street. He turned the nearest corner  without looking back.    \"I believe he is the same fellow, and I believe he robbed me!\" cried  Andy.    \"Possibly he is, but you are not sure of it,\" answered the young major.  \"And it would be foolhardy to have him arrested when you have no  evidence against him.\"    \"He acted as if he was scared,\" came from Pepper. \"That growl of his was  all put on.\"    \"I wish I had forced him to give me his name and address.\"    \"That's true.\"    \"You can get that from Reff Ritter.\"    \"Providing Ritter will give it,\" added Jack. \"He may be as backward  about it as the man was himself.\"    \"Why should he be, if the man is honest?\"    \"Perhaps he won't want it known that he met the man,\" said Pepper. \"He  came in here rather sneakingly.\"    \"Where did Ritter go?\"    \"To the Hall, most likely. It's time we got back, too.\"    The three cadets left the vicinity of the unfinished buildings and were  soon on the way to the school. As they trudged along they talked over  what had happened, and also discussed the arrival of Dan Baxter.    \"Baxter will try to stir things up,\" said Jack. And he was right, the  bully did stir up the whole school, but it was not until the next term,  after the young major had left.    About half the distance to Putnam Hall had been covered when the three  cadets discovered a crowd ahead of them.    \"Who are those fellows?\" asked Pepper.    \"Pornell Academy lads,\" announced Andy. \"And see, they have spotted us!\"    He was right, the other crowd, nine strong, were students from Pornell.  They were led by Roy Bock and a fellow named Grimes. They had been  good-naturedly snowballing each other, but now they stopped.    \"Three Putnam Hall cadets!\" cried Bock. \"Come on, fellows, here's a  chance for sport.\"    \"Let's snowball 'em good and proper!\" exclaimed Grimes.    \"Everybody on the jump!\" yelled another Pornell youth.    \"Let's surround 'em,\" was the suggestion offered.    \"We'll hammer the daylights out of 'em,\" came from one lad, who could  only be brave when backed up by a crowd.    \"Yes, surround 'em, don't let 'em get away!\" cried Bock. \"Come on!\" And  he led the way on the run, making snowballs as he moved.          CHAPTER XIX    ABOUT A SET OF TEETH      \"I am afraid we are in for it!\" whispered the young major, as he saw the  rush of the Pornell students, each armed with all the snowballs he could  carry.    \"Shall we run away?\" asked Andy. \"I guess we can run as fast as they  can.\"    \"Never!\" replied Pepper. \"I am going to the Hall and on this road.\"    \"So am I!\" added Jack.    \"Then let us rush 'em?\" suggested Andy. \"We can't stand and fight nine  of 'em--we'll be snowed under.\"    \"Rush it is,\" returned the young major. \"Wait till I give the signal.\"    On came the enemy, and soon the snowballs were flying at a lively rate.  It was growing dark, but the aim of the Pornell students was good and  the chums were hit several times. They threw snowballs in return,  hitting Bock in the breast and Grimes in the chin.    \"Come on, throw 'em over!\" roared Bock. \"Roll 'em in the snow!\"    \"And stuff some snow down their backs!\" added Grimes.    \"Now then, all together!\" cried Jack. \"Keep as close as possible! One,  two, three!\"    Side by side the three chums bounded forward, straight for the line of  Pornellites. They came on swiftly and took the enemy by surprise. Jack  bumped into Bock, hurling him flat, and Pepper bowled over Grimes. Andy  bent low and caught another student by the legs, sending him over into a  fourth, and both went flat. Then the three cadets caught a fifth and ran  him along the road and into a hollow, where he went into snow up to his  waist.    \"Stop 'em! Stop 'em!\" was the cry, but the Putnam Hall boys could not be  stopped. Turning, they delivered a parting shower of snowballs, and then  ran on, in the direction of the school.    \"I guess the Pornell fellows will remember that for awhile,\" panted  Pepper, when they felt safe.    \"And just think of it--three to nine!\" chuckled Andy.    \"They thought they had us dead to rights,\" came from Jack. \"Well, I  guess we showed them a trick or two they won't forget right away.\"    \"Are they following us?\" asked the acrobatic youth, looking back.    \"I reckon not,\" replied Pepper, \"Must have had enough,\" and he smiled  broadly.    The three cadets were tired out from their long walk and the contest on  the road, and when the school was reached all were glad enough to sit  down and rest previous to having supper. Andy looked around for Reff  Ritter, but that cadet kept himself out of sight.    \"I'll see him after supper,\" said the acrobatic youth.    It was not until nearly bedtime that he got a chance to question the  bully. He followed Ritter up to his dormitory, which chanced just then  to be unoccupied.    \"Reff, I want to talk to you,\" he said, when the bully was on the point  of closing the door in his face.    \"What do you want, Andy Snow? I'm not feeling well to-night, and I am  tired out from a walk I took to Cedarville.\"    \"I won't keep you long, Reff. I want to ask you about the man you met in  Cedarville? What's his name?\"    Reff Ritter stopped short and showed that the question took him by  surprise.    \"Man I met?\" he stammered.    \"Yes, the man you met at the new buildings in Cedarville.\"    \"Who said I met any one?\"    \"We saw you, I and Major Ruddy and Pep Ditmore.\"    \"Huh! Been spying on me, eh?\" And Reff Ritter's face took on its old  look of sourness.    \"It was an accident. But I want to know who that man was.\"    \"What for?\"    \"I have my reasons.\"    \"I don't see that I am called on to answer your questions, Andy Snow. If  I want to meet anybody I'll do it.\"    \"Then you refuse to tell me who the man was?\"    \"Tell me why you want to know and maybe I'll tell you who he is,\"  answered the bully, after studying the acrobatic youth's face for a  moment.    \"Very well. Do you remember the time the horse ran away with me and left  me unconscious on the road?\"    \"I heard about it.\"    \"Well, just before I was knocked unconscious I saw a man on the road  ahead of me.\"    \"Well?\"    \"I think it was the man you met this afternoon.\"    \"That man?\" cried the bully, and now he showed a sudden interest.    \"Yes, and that is why I want to know his name, and where he comes from.\"    \"You must be mistaken, Snow. That man doesn't belong around here.\"    \"Where is he from?\"    \"I think he comes from Boston, but I am not sure.\"    \"And his name?\"    \"Why do you ask these questions? Do you think he had something to do  with your being thrown from the horse?\"    \"No, not with being thrown from the horse, Reff. But, if you'll  remember, when I came to my senses my watch was gone, also my stickpin  and eight dollars in bills.\"    \"And you think that man took them?\" questioned Reff Ritter, in a voice  that sounded strained.    \"I won't say that until I know more about the man. If you say he is a  good, honest man, why then I'll be bound to believe I am mistaken.\"    \"I don't know much about him, but I don't think he is a thief,\" answered  the bully, slowly. \"His name is Smith, Cameron Smith, and he is a"]]]
