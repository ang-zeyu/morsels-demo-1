New York was the first to feel this, coming under the gentleman's  governorship immediately on being the second time surrendered to  England. Such had been the political disorder in the province, that  Andros's headship, stern as it was, proved beneficial. He even, for a  time, 1683-86, reluctantly permitted an elective legislature, though  discontinuing it when the legislatures of New England were suppressed.  This taste of freedom had its effect afterward.    [1690]    When news of the Revolution of 1688 in England reached New York, Andros  was in Boston. Nicholson, Lieutenant-Governor, being a Catholic and an  absolutist, and the colony now in horror of all Catholics through fear  of French invasion from Canada, Jacob Leisler, a German adventurer,  partly anticipating, partly obeying the popular wish, assumed to  function in Nicholson's stead. All the aristocracy, English or Dutch,  and nearly all the English of the lower rank were against him. Leisler  was passionate and needlessly bitter toward Catholics, yet he meant  well. He viewed his office as only transitory, and stood ready to  surrender it so soon as the new king's will could be learned; but when  Slaughter arrived with commission as governor, Leisler's foes succeeded  in compassing his execution for treason. This unjust and cruel deed  began a long feud between the popular and the aristocratic party in the  colony.    [Illustration: Sloughter signing Leisler's Death Warrant.]    [1700]    From this time till the American Revolution New York continued a  province of the Crown. Royal governor succeeded royal governor, some of  them better, some worse. Of the entire line Bellomont was the most  worthy official, Cornbury the least so. One of the problems which  chiefly worried all of them was how to execute the navigation acts,  which, evaded everywhere, were here unscrupulously defied. Another care  of the governors, in which they succeeded but very imperfectly, was to  establish the English Church in the colony. A third was the  disfranchisement of Catholics. This they accomplished, the legislature  concurring, and the disability continued during the entire colonial  period.    Hottest struggle of all occurred over the question of the colony's right  of self-taxation. The democracy stood for this with the utmost  firmness, and even the higher classes favored rather than opposed. The  governors, Cornbury and Lovelace, most frantically, but in vain,  expostulated, scolded, threatened, till at last it became admitted by  law in the colony that no tax whatever could, on any pretext, be levied  save by act of the people's representatives.    Dutch America, it will be remembered, had reached southward to the  Delaware River, and this lower portion passed with the rest to the Duke  of York in 1664. The territory between the Hudson and the Delaware,  under the name of New Jersey, he made over to Lord Berkeley and Sir  George Carteret, proprietaries, who favored the freest institutions,  civil and religious.  The population was for long very sparse and, as it  grew, very miscellaneous. Dutch, Swedes, English, Quakers, and Puritans  from New England were represented.    [Illustration: Seal of the Carterets.]    After the English recovery Berkeley disposed of his undivided half of  the province, subsequently set off as West Jersey, to one Bylling, a  Quaker, who in a little time assigned it to Lawrie, Lucas, Penn, and  other Quakers. West Jersey became as much a Quaker paradise as  Pennsylvania. Penn with eleven of his brethren, also bought, of  Carteret's heirs, East Jersey, but here Puritan rather than Quaker  influence prevailed.    [Illustration: Seal of East Jersey.]    The Jersey plantations came of course under Andros, and after his fall  its proprietors did not recover their political authority. For twelve  years, while they were endeavoring to do this, partial anarchy cursed  the province, and at length in 1702 they surrendered their rights to the  Crown, the Jerseys, now made one, becoming directly subject to Queen  Anne. The province had its own legislature and, till 1741, the same  governors as New York. It also had mainly the same political  vicissitudes, and with the same result.    William Penn, the famous Quaker, received the proprietorship of  Pennsylvania in payment of a claim for sixteen thousand pounds against  the English Government. This had been left him by his father, Sir  William Penn, a distinguished naval commander in the Dutch war of  1665-67, when he had borne chief part in the conquest of Jamaica.    [Illustration: Wampum received by Penn in Commemoration of the Indian  Treaty.]    William Penn was among the most cultivated men of his time, polished by  study and travel, deeply read in law and philosophy. He had fortune, and  many friends at court, including Charles II. himself. He needed but to  conform, and great place was his. But conform he would not. True to the  inner light, braving the scoffs of all his friends, expelled from Oxford  University, beaten from his own father's door, imprisoned now nine  months in London Tower, now six in Newgate, this heroic spirit  persistently went the Quaker way. In despair of securing in England  freedom for distressed consciences he turned his thoughts toward  America, there to try his \"holy experiment.\"    [Illustration: William Penn; From the copy by Francis Race in the  National Museum, Philadelphia.]    The charter from Charles II. was drawn by Penn's own hand and was nobly  liberal. It ordained perfect religious toleration for all Christians,  and forbade taxation save by the provincial assembly or the English  Parliament. Under William and Mary, greatly to his grief, Penn was  forced to sanction the penal laws against Catholics; but they were most  leniently administered, which brought upon the large-minded proprietary  much trouble with the home government.    As Pennsylvania, owing to the righteous and loving procedure of Penn  toward them, suffered nothing from the red men to the west, so was it  fortunately beyond Andros's jurisdiction on the east. Once, from 1692,  for two years, the land was snatched from Penn and placed under a royal  commission. Returning to England in 1684, after a two years' sojourn in  America to get his colony started, the Quaker chief became intimate and  a favorite with James II., devotedly supporting his Declaration of  Indulgence toward Catholics as well as toward all Protestant dissenters.  He tried hard but vainly to win William and Mary to the same policy.  This attitude of his cost him dear, rendering him an object of suspicion  to the men now in power in England. Twice was he accused of treasonable  correspondence with the exiled James II., though never proved guilty.  From 1699 to 1701 he was in America again, thereafter residing in  England till his death in 1718. He had literally given all for his  colony, his efforts on its behalf having been to him, so he wrote in  1710, a cause of grief, trouble, and poverty.    [Illustration: The Treaty Monument, Kensington.]    But the colony itself was amazingly prosperous. There were internal  feuds, mainly petty, some serious. George Keith grievously divided the  Quakers by his teachings against slavery, going to law, or service as  magistrates on the part of Quakers, thus implying that only infidels or  churchmen could be the colony's officials.    Fletcher's governorship in 1693-94, under the royal commission, evoked  continual opposition, colonial privileges remaining intact in spite of  him. The people from time to time subjected their ground-law to changes,  only to render it a fitter instrument of freedom. In everything save the  hereditary function of the proprietary, it was democratic. For many  years even the governor's council was elective. The colony grew,  immigrants crowding in from nearly every European country, and wealth  multiplied to correspond.    [Illustration: The Penn Mansion in Philadelphia.]    We have, dating from 1698, a history of Pennsylvania by one Gabriel  Thomas, full of interesting information. Philadelphia was already a  \"noble and beautiful city,\" containing above 2,000 houses, most of them  \"stately,\" made of brick; three stores, and besides a town house, a  market house, and several schools. Three fairs were held there yearly,  and two weekly markets, which it required twenty fat bullocks, besides  many sheep, calves, and hogs, to supply. The city had large trade to New  York, New England, Virginia, West India, and Old England. Its exports  were horses, pipe-staves, salt meats, bread-stuffs, poultry, and  tobacco; its imports, fir, rum, sugar, molasses, silver, negroes, salt,  linen, household goods, etc. Wages were three times as high as in  England or Wales. All sorts of \"very good paper\" were made at  Germantown, besides linen, druggets, crapes, camlets, serges, and other  woollen cloths. All religious confessions were represented.    In 1712, such his poverty, the good proprietary was willing to sell to  the Crown, but as he insisted upon maintenance of the colonists' full  rights, no sale occurred. English bigots and revenue officials would  gladly have annulled his charter, but his integrity had gotten him  influence among English statesmen, which shielded the heritage he had  left even when he was gone.    It is particularly to be noticed that till our Independence Delaware was  most intimately related to Pennsylvania. Of Delaware the fee simple  belonged not to Penn, but to the Duke of York, who had conquered it from  the Dutch, as they from the Swedes. Penn therefore governed here, not as  proprietary but as the Duke's tenant. In 1690-92, and from 1702,  Delaware enjoyed a legislature by itself, though its governors were  appointed by Penn or his heirs during the entire colonial period.        CHAPTER V.

It has been also urged  that his reforms were good and useful for his own time and place, but  that by making them final he has prevented further progress and  consecrated half measures. What were restrictions to his Arabs would  have been license to other men.[147] (2) That Islam deals with positive  precepts rather than with principles,[148] and the danger of a precise  system of positive precepts regulating the minute detail, the ceremonial  worship, and the moral and social relations of life, is, that it should  retain too tight a grip upon men when the circumstances which justified  it have changed and vanished away, and therefore the imposition of a  system good for barbarians upon people already possessing higher sort of  civilization and the principles of a purer faith is not a blessing but a  curse. Nay more, even the system which was good for people when they  were in a barbarous state may become positively mischievous to those  same people when they begin to emerge from their barbarism under its  influence into a higher condition.[149] (3) That the exact ritual and  formal observations of Islam have carried with them their own Nemesis,  and thus we find that in the worship of the faithful formalism and  indifferences, pedantic scrupulosity and positive disbelief flourish  side by side. The minutest change of posture in prayer, the displacement  of a simple genuflexion, would call for much heavier censure than  outward profligacy or absolute neglect.[150] (4) That morality is viewed  not in the abstract, but in the concrete. That the Koran deals much more  with sin and virtue in fragmentary details than as a whole. It deals  with acts more than principles, with outward practice more than inward  motives, with precepts and commands more than exhortation. It does not  hold up before man the hatefulness and ugliness of _all_ sin _as a  whole_.[151] (5) \"That Islam is stationary; swathed in the rigid bands  of the Coran, it is powerless, like the Christian dispensation,[152] to  adapt itself to the varying circumstances of time and place, and to keep  pace with, if not to lead and direct, the progress of society and the  elevation of the race.

All these objections more or less apply rather to the teachings of  the Mohammadan Common Law (canon and civil), called _Fiqah_ or _Shara_,  than to the Koran, the Mohammadan Revealed Law. Our Common Law, which  treats both ecclesiastical and the civil law, is by no means considered  to be a divine or unchangeable law. This subject has been treated by me  in a separate work[154] on the Legal, Political and Social Reforms to  which the reader is referred. The space allowed to me in this  Introduction, which has already exceeded its proper limit, does not  admit a full and lengthy discussion of the objections quoted above, but  I will review them here in as few words as possible.    [Footnote 154: Reforms, Political, Social and Legal, under the Moslem  Rule, Bombay Education Society's Press, 1883.]      [Sidenote: Finality of the social reforms of Mohammad.]    39. (1) Mohammad had to deal with barbarous nations around him, to be  gradually reformed, and besides this the subject of social reforms was a  secondary question. Yet it being necessary to transform the character of  the people and to reform the moral and social abuses prevailing among  them, he gradually introduced his social reforms which proved immense  blessings to the Arabs and other nations in the seventh century. Perhaps  some temporary but judicious, reasonable and helpful accommodations had  to be made to the weakness and immaturity of the people, as halting  stages in the march of reforms only to be set aside at their adult  strength, or to be abolished when they were to begin to emerge from  their barbarism under its influence to a higher civilization.  Consequently gradual amelioration of social evils had necessarily to  pass several trials during progress of reform. The intermediate stages  are not to be taken as final and irrevocable standard of morality and an  insuperable barrier to the regeneration of the Arabian nation. Our  adversaries stick indiscriminately to these temporary measures or  concessions only, and call them half measures and partial reforms made  into an unchangeable law which exclude the highest reforms, and form a  formidable obstacle to the dawn of a progressive and enlightened  civilization. I have in view here the precepts of Mohammad for  ameliorating the degraded condition of women for restricting the  unlimited polygamy and the facility of divorce, together with servile  concubinage and slavery.[155] Mohammad's injunctions and precepts,  intermediary and ultimate, temporary and permanent, intended for the  removal of these social evils, are interwoven with each other,  interspersed in different Suras and not chronologically arranged, in  consequence of which it is somewhat difficult for those who have no deep  insight into the promiscuous literature of the Koran to find out which  precept was only a halting stage, and which the latest. It was only from  some oversight on the part of the compilers of the Common Law that, in  the first place, the civil precepts of a transitory nature and as a  mediate step leading to a higher reform were taken as final; and in the  second place, the civil precepts adapted for the dwellers of the Arabian  desert were pressed upon the neck of all ages and countries. A social  system for barbarism ought not to be imposed on a people already  possessing higher forms of civilizations.    [Footnote 155: \"The cankerworm of polygamy, divorce, servile concubinage  and veil lay at the root. They are bound up in the character of its  existence. A reformed Islam which should part with the divine ordinances  on which they rest, or attempt in the smallest degree to change them by  a rationalistic selection, abetment or variation would be Islam no  longer.\" Annals of the Early Caliphate by Sir W. Muir, page 458.]      [Sidenote: Positive precepts.]    [Sidenote: Ceremonial law.]    40. (2) In fact the Koran deals with positive precepts as well as with  principles, but it never teaches a precise system of precepts regulating  in minute details the social relations of life and the ceremonial of  worship. On the contrary, its aim has been to counteract the tendency to  narrowness, formality, and severity which is the consequence of a living  under a rigid system of positive precepts. Mohammad had to transform the  character of the Arab barbarians who had no religious or moral teacher  or a social reformer before his advent. It was therefore necessary to  give them a few positive precepts, moulding and regulating their moral "]]]
