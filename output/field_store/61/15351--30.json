Every colour used in painting, except pure white and black, is therefore  a light and shade at the same time. It is a light with reference to all  below it, and a shade with reference to all above it.      132. The solid forms of an object, that is to say, the projections or  recessions of its surface within the outline, are, for the most part,  rendered visible by variations in the intensity or quantity of light  falling on them. The study of the relations between the quantities of  this light, irrespectively of its colour, is the second division of the  regulated science of painting.      133. Finally, the qualities and relations of natural colours, the means  of imitating them, and the laws by which they become separately  beautiful, and in association harmonious, are the subjects of the third  and final division of the painter's study. I shall endeavour at once to  state to you what is most immediately desirable for you to know on each  of these topics, in this and the two following lectures.      134. What we have to do, then, from beginning to end, is, I repeat once  more, simply to draw spaces of their true shape, and to fill them with  colours which shall match their colours; quite a simple thing in the  definition of it, not quite so easy in the doing of it.    But it is something to get this simple definition; and I wish you to  notice that the terms of it are complete, though I do not introduce the  term \"light,\" or \"shadow.\" Painters who have no eye for colour have  greatly confused and falsified the practice of art by the theory that  shadow is an absence of colour. Shadow is, on the contrary, necessary to  the full presence of colour; for every colour is a diminished quantity  or energy of light; and, practically, it follows from what I have just  told you--(that every light in painting is a shadow to higher lights,  and every shadow a light to lower shadows)--that also every _colour_ in  painting must be a shadow to some brighter colour, and a light to some  darker one--all the while being a positive colour itself. And the great  splendour of the Venetian school arises from their having seen and held  from the beginning this great fact--that shadow is as much colour as  light, often much more. In Titian's fullest red the lights are pale  rose-colour, passing into white--the shadows warm deep crimson. In  Veronese's most splendid orange, the lights are pale, the shadows crocus  colour; and so on. In nature, dark sides if seen by reflected lights,  are almost always fuller or warmer in colour than the lights; and the  practice of the Bolognese and Roman schools, in drawing their shadows  always dark and cold, is false from the beginning, and renders perfect  painting for ever impossible in those schools, and to all who follow  them.      135. Every visible space, then, be it dark or light, is a space of  colour of some kind, or of black or white. And you have to enclose it  with a true outline, and to paint it with its true colour.    But before considering how we are to draw this enclosing line, I must  state to you something about the use of lines in general, by different  schools.    I said just now that there was no difference between the masses of  colour of which all visible nature is composed, except in _texture_. Now  textures are principally of three kinds:--         (1) Lustrous, as of water and glass.       (2) Bloomy, or velvety, as of a rose-leaf or peach.       (3) Linear, produced by filaments or threads as in feathers, fur,           hair, and woven or reticulated tissues.    All these three sources of pleasure to the eye in texture are united in  the best ornamental work. A fine picture by Fra Angelico, or a fine  illuminated page of missal, has large spaces of gold, partly burnished  and lustrous, partly dead;--some of it chased and enriched with linear  texture, and mingled with imposed or inlaid colours, soft in bloom like  that of the rose-leaf. But many schools of art affect for the most part  one kind of texture only, and a vast quantity of the art of all ages  depends for great part of its power on texture produced by multitudinous  lines. Thus, wood engraving, line engraving properly so called, and  countless varieties of sculpture, metal work, and textile fabric, depend  for great part of the effect, for the mystery, softness, and clearness  of their colours, or shades, on modification of the surfaces by lines or  threads. Even in advanced oil painting, the work often depends for some  part of its effect on the texture of the canvas.      136. Again, the arts of etching and mezzotint engraving depend  principally for their effect on the velvety, or bloomy texture of their  darkness, and the best of all painting is the fresco work of great  colourists, in which the colours are what is usually called dead; but  they are anything but dead, they glow with the luminous bloom of life.  The frescoes of Correggio, when not repainted, are supreme in this  quality.      137. While, however, in all periods of art these different textures are  thus used in various styles, and for various purposes, you will find  that there is a broad historical division of schools, which will  materially assist you in understanding them. The earliest art in most  countries is linear, consisting of interwoven, or richly spiral and  otherwise involved arrangements of sculptured or painted lines, on  stone, wood, metal or clay. It is generally characteristic of savage  life, and of feverish energy of imagination. I shall examine these  schools with you hereafter, under the general head of the \"Schools of  Line.\"[12]    [Footnote 12: See \"Ariadne Florentina,\" Sec. 5.]    Secondly, even in the earliest periods, among powerful nations, this  linear decoration is more or less filled with chequered or barred shade,  and begins at once to represent animal or floral form, by filling its  outlines with flat shadow, or with flat colour. And here we instantly  find two great divisions of temper and thought. The Greeks look upon all  colour first as light; they are, as compared with other races,  insensitive to hue, exquisitely sensitive to phenomena of light. And  their linear school passes into one of flat masses of light and  darkness, represented in the main by four tints,--white, black, and two  reds, one brick colour, more or less vivid, the other dark purple; these  two standing mentally their favourite +porphyreos+ colour, in its  light and dark powers. On the other hand, many of the Northern nations  are at first entirely insensible to light and shade, but exquisitely  sensitive to colour, and their linear decoration is filled with flat  tints, infinitely varied, but with no expression of light and shade.  Both these schools have a limited but absolute perfection of their own,  and their peculiar successes can in no wise be imitated, except by the  strictest observance of the same limitations.      138. You have then, Line for the earliest art, branching into--         (1) Greek, Line with Light.       (2) Gothic, Line with Colour.    Now, as art completes itself, each of these schools retain their  separate characters, but they cease to depend on lines, and learn to  represent masses instead, becoming more refined at the same time in all  modes of perception and execution.    And thus there arise the two vast mediaeval schools; one of flat and  infinitely varied colour, with exquisite character and sentiment added,  in the forms represented; but little perception of shadow. The other, of  light and shade, with exquisite drawing of solid form, and little  perception of colour: sometimes as little of sentiment. Of these, the  school of flat colour is the more vital one; it is always natural and  simple, if not great;--and when it is great, it is very great.    The school of light and shade associates itself with that of engraving;  it is essentially an academical school, broadly dividing light from  darkness, and begins by assuming that the light side of all objects  shall be represented by white, and the extreme shadow by black. On this  conventional principle it reaches a limited excellence of its own, in  which the best existing types of engraving are executed, and ultimately,  the most regular expressions of organic form in painting.    Then, lastly,--the schools of colour advance steadily, till they adopt  from those of light and shade whatever is compatible with their own  power,--and then you have perfect art, represented centrally by that of  the great Venetians.    The schools of light and shade, on the other hand, are partly, in their  academical formulas, too haughty, and partly, in their narrowness of  imagination, too weak, to learn much from the schools of colour; and  pass into a state of decadence, consisting partly in proud endeavours to  give painting the qualities of sculpture, and partly in the pursuit of  effects of light and shade, carried at last to extreme sensational  subtlety by the Dutch school. In their fall, they drag the schools of  colour down with them; and the recent history of art is one of confused  effort to find lost roads, and resume allegiance to violated principles.      139. That, briefly, is the map of the great schools, easily remembered  in this hexagonal form:--                                       1.

I guess Brit's at the ranch.\"    \"Sorry I'm busy to-day,\" said Lone, opening the door. \"You stay as long  as you like, Swan. I've got some riding to do.\"    \"I'll wash the dishes, and then I maybe will think quicker than that  coyote. I'm after him, by golly, till I get him.\"    Lone muttered something and went out. Within five minutes Swan, hearing  hoofbeats, looked out through a crack in the door and saw Lone riding at  a gallop along the trail to Rock City. \"Good bait. He swallows the  hook,\" he commented to himself, and his good-natured grin was not  brightening his face while he washed the dishes and tidied the cabin.    With Lone rode bitterness of soul and a sick fear that had nothing to do  with his own destiny. How long ago Brit had been hurled into the canyon  Lone did not know; he had not asked. But he judged that it must have  been very recently. Swan had not told him of anything but the runaway,  and of helping to carry Brit home--and of the \"damn funny thing about  the chain\"--the rough-lock, he must have meant. Too well Lone  understood the sinister meaning that probably lay behind that phrase.    \"They've started on the Quirt now,\" he told himself with foreboding.  \"She's been telling her father----\"    Lone fell into bitter argument with himself. Just how far was it  justifiable to mind his own business? And if he did not mind it, what  possible chance had he against a power so ruthless and so cunning? An  accident to a man driving a loaded wagon down the Spirit Canyon grade  had a diabolic plausibility that no man in the country could question.  Brit, he reasoned, could not have known before he started that his  rough-lock had been tampered with, else he would have fixed it. Neither  was Brit the man to forget the brake on his load. If Brit lived, he  might talk as much as he pleased, but he could never prove that his  accident had been deliberately staged with murderous intent.    Lone lifted his head and looked away across the empty miles of sageland  to the quiet blue of the mountains beyond. Peace--the peace of  untroubled wilderness--brooded over the land. Far in the distance,  against the rim of rugged hills, was an irregular splotch of brown which  was the headquarters of the Sawtooth. Lone turned his wrist to the  right, and John Doe, obeying the rein signal, left the trail and began  picking his way stiff-legged down the steep slope of the ridge, heading  directly toward the home ranch.    John Doe was streaked with sweat and his flanks were palpitating with  fatigue when Lone rode up to the corral and dismounted. Pop Bridgers saw  him and came bow-legging eagerly forward with gossip titillating on his  meddlesome tongue, but Lone stalked by him with only a surly nod. Bob  Warfield he saw at a distance and gave no sign of recognition. He met  Hawkins coming down from his house and stopped in the trail.    \"Have you got time to go back to the office and fix up my time,  Hawkins?\" he asked without prelude. \"I'm quitting to-day.\"    Hawkins stared and named the Biblical place of torment. \"What yuh  quittin' for, Lone?\" he added incredulously. \"All you boys got a raise  last month; ain't that good enough?\"    \"Plenty good enough, so long as I work for the outfit.\"    \"Well, what's wrong? You've been with us five years, Lone, and it's  suited you all right so far----\"    Lone looked at him. \"Say, I never set out to _marry_ the Sawtooth,\" he  stated calmly. \"And if I have married you-all by accident, you can get a  bill of divorce for desertion. This ain't the first time a man ever quit  yuh, is it, Hawkins?\"    \"No--and there ain't a man on the pay roll we can't do without,\" Hawkins  retorted, his neck stiffening with resentment. \"It's a kinda rusty  trick, though, Lone, quittin' without notice and leaving a camp empty.\"    \"Elk Spring won't run away,\" Lone assured him without emotion. \"She's  been left alone a week or two at a time during roundups. I don't reckon  the outfit'll bust up before you get a man down there.\"    The foreman looked at him curiously, for this was not like Lone, whose  tone had always been soft and friendly, and whose manner had no hint of  brusqueness. There was a light, too, in Lone's eyes that had not been  there before. But Hawkins would not question him further. If Lone Morgan  or any other man wanted to quit, that was his privilege,--providing, of  course, that his leaving was not likely to menace the peace and  security of the Sawtooth. Lone had made it a point to mind his own  business, always. He had never asked questions, he had never surmised or  gossiped. So Hawkins gave him a check for his wages and let him go with  no more than a foreman's natural reluctance to lose a trustworthy man.    By hard riding along short cuts, Lone reached the Quirt ranch and  dropped reins at the doorstep, not much past mid-afternoon.    \"I rode over to see if there's anything I can do,\" he said, when  Lorraine opened the door to him. He did not like to ask about her  father, fearing that the news would be bad.    \"Why, thank you for coming.\" Lorraine stepped back, tacitly inviting him  to enter. \"Dad knows us to-day, but of course he's terribly hurt and  can't talk much. We do need some one to go to town for things. Frank  helps me with dad, and Jim and Sorry are trying to keep things going on  the ranch. And Swan does what he can, of course, but----\"    \"I just thought you maybe needed somebody right bad,\" said Lone quietly,  meaning a great deal more than Lorraine dreamed that he meant. \"I'm not  doing anything at all, right now, so I can just as well help out as  not. I can go to town right away, if I can borrow a horse. John Doe,  he's pretty tired. I been pushing him right through--not knowing there  was a town trip ahead of him.\"    Lorraine found her eyes going misty. He was so quiet, and so reassuring  in his quiet. Half her burden seemed to slip from her shoulders while  she looked at him. She turned away, groping for the door latch.    \"You may see dad, if you like, while I get the list of things the doctor  ordered. He left only a little while ago, and I was waiting for one of  the boys to come back so I could send him to town.\"    It was on Lone's tongue to ask why the doctor had not taken in the order  himself and instructed some one to bring out the things; but he  remembered how very busy with its own affairs was Echo and decided that  the doctor was wise.    He tiptoed in to the bed and saw a sallow face covered with stubbly gray  whiskers and framed with white bandages. Brit opened his eyes and moved  his thin lips in some kind of greeting, and Lone sat down on the edge of  a chair, feeling as miserably guilty as if he himself had brought the  old man to this pass. It seemed to him that Brit must know more of the  accident than Swan had told, and the thought did not add to his comfort.  He waited until Brit opened his eyes again, and then he leaned forward,  holding Brit's wandering glance with his own intent gaze.    \"I ain't working now,\" he said, lowering his voice so that Lorraine  could not hear. \"So I'm going to stay here and help see you through with  this. I've quit the Sawtooth.\"    Brit's eyes cleared and studied Lone's face. \"D'you know--anything?\"    \"No, I don't.\" Lone's face hardened a little. \"But I wanted you to know  that I'm--with the Quirt, now.\"    \"Frank hire yuh?\"    \"No. I ain't hired at all. I'm just--_with_ yuh.\"    \"We--need yuh,\" said Brit grimly, looking Lone straight in the eyes.          CHAPTER FOURTEEN    \"FRANK'S DEAD\"      \"Frank come yet?\" The peevish impatience of an invalid whose horizon has  narrowed to his own personal welfare and wants was in Brit's voice. Two  weeks he had been sick, and his temper had not sweetened with the pain  of his broken bones and the enforced idleness. Brit was the type of man  who is never quiet unless he is asleep or too ill to get out of bed.    Lorraine came to the doorway and looked in at him. Two weeks had set  their mark on her also. She seemed older, quieter in her ways; there  were shadows in her eyes and a new seriousness in the set of her mouth.  She had had her burdens, and she had borne them with more patience than  many an older woman would have done, but what she thought of those  burdens she did not say.    \"No, dad--but I thought I heard a wagon a little while ago. He must be  coming,\" she said.    \"Where's Lone at?\" Brit moved restlessly on the pillow and twisted his  face at the pain.    \"Lone isn't back, either.\"    \"He ain't? Where'd he go?\"    Lorraine came to the bedside and, lifting Brit's head carefully,  arranged the pillow as she knew he liked it. \"I don't know where he  went,\" she said dully. \"He rode off just after dinner. Do you want your  supper now? Or would you rather wait until Frank brings the fruit?\"    \"I'd ruther wait--if Frank don't take all night,\" Brit grumbled. \"I hope  he ain't connected up with that Echo booze. If he has----\"    \"Oh, no, dad! Don't borrow trouble. Frank was anxious to get home as  soon as he could. He'll be coming any minute, now. I'll go listen for  the wagon.\"    \"No use listenin'. You couldn't hear it in that sand--not till he gits  to the gate. I don't see where Lone goes to, all the time. Where's Jim  and Sorry, then?\"    \"Oh, they've had their supper and gone to the bunk-house. Do you want  them?\"    \"No! What'd I want 'em fur? Not to look at, that's sure. I want to know  how things is going on this ranch. And from all I can make out, they  ain't goin' at all,\" Brit fretted. \"What was you 'n Lone talkin' so long  about, out in the kitchen last night? Seems to me you 'n' him have got  a lot to say to each other, Raine.\"    \"Why, nothing in particular. We were just--talking. We're all human  beings, dad; we have to talk sometimes. There's nothing else to do.\"    \"Well, I caught something about the Sawtooth. I don't want you talking  to Lone or anybody else about that outfit, Raine. I told yuh so once.  He's"]]]
