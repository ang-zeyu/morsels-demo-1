The first       few lines of the _Great Inscription of El-Kab_ seem to refer       to four successive campaigns, i.e. four years of warfare up       to the taking of Avaris, and to a fifth year spent in       pursuing the Shepherds into Syria.         ** The vulture of Nekhabit is used to indicate the south,       while the urseus of Buto denotes the extreme north; the       title Ra-Nekhnit, \"Chief of Nekhnit,\" which is,       hypothetically, supposed to refer to a judicial function, is       none the less associated with the expression, \"Nekhabit-       Tekhnit,\" as an indication of the south, and, therefore,       can be traced to the prehistoric epoch when Nekhabit was the       primary designation of the south.    [Illustration: 116.jpg THE WALLS OF EL-KAB SEEN FROM THE TOMB OF PIHIRI]         Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a photograph by Emil Brugsch-Bey.      [Illustration: 116a.jpg COLLECTION OF VASES] MODELLED AND PAINTED IN THE  GRAND TEMPLE. PHILAE ISLAND.    These nomes were cultivated, moreover, by a poor and sparse population.  It needed a fortuitous combination of circumstances to relieve them from  their poverty-stricken condition--either a war, which would bring into  prominence their strategic positions; or the establishment of  markets, such as those of Syene and Elephantine, where the commerce  of neighbouring regions would naturally centre; or the erection, as at  Ombos or Adfu, of a temple which would periodically attract a crowd  of pilgrims. The principality of the Two Feathers comprised, besides  Nekhabit, at least two such towns--Anit, on its northern boundary, and  Nekhnit almost facing Nekhabit on the left bank of the river.* These  three towns sometimes formed separate estates for as many independent  lords:** even when united they constituted a fiefdom of but restricted  area and of slender revenues, its chiefs ranking below those of the  great feudal princes of Middle Egypt. The rulers of this fiefdom led an  obscure existence during the whole period of the Memphite empire, and  when at length Thebes gained the ascendency, they rallied to the latter  and acknowledged her suzerainty. One of them, Sovkunakhiti, gained the  favour of Sovkhotpu III. Sakhemuaztauiri, who granted him lands which  made the fortune of his house; another of them, Ai, married Khonsu,  one of the daughters of Sovkumsauf I. and his Queen Nubkhas, and it is  possible that the misshapen pyramid of Qulah, the most southern in Egypt  proper, was built for one of these royally connected personages.         * Nekhnit is the Hieraconpolis of Greek and Roman times,       Hait-Bauku, the modern name of which is Kom-el-Ahmar.         ** Pihiri was, therefore, prince of Nekhabit and of Anit at       one and the same time, whereas the town of Nekhnit had its       own special rulers, several of whom are known to us from the       tombs at Kom-el-Ahmar.    The descendants of Ai attached themselves faithfully to the Pharaohs  of the XVIIth dynasty, and helped them to the utmost in their struggle  against the invaders. Their capital, Nekhabit, was situated between the  Nile and the Arabian chain, at the entrance to a valley which penetrates  some distance into the desert, and leads to the gold-mines on the Red  Sea. The town profited considerably from the precious metals brought  into it by the caravans, and also from the extraction of natron, which  from prehistoric times was largely employed in embalming. It had been  a fortified place from the outset, and its walls, carefully repaired  by successive ages, were still intact at the beginning of this century.  They described at this time a rough quadrilateral, the two longer sides  of which measured some 1900 feet in length, the two shorter being about  one-fourth less. The southern face was constructed in a fashion common  in brick buildings in Egypt, being divided into alternate panels of  horizontally laid courses, and those in which the courses were concave;  on the north and west facades the bricks were so laid as to present  an undulating arrangement running uninterruptedly from one end to the  other. The walls are 33 feet thick, and their average height 27 feet;  broad and easy steps lead to the foot-walk on the top. The gates are  unsymmetrically placed, there being one on the north, east, and west  sides respectively; while the southern side is left without an opening.  These walls afforded protection to a dense but unequally distributed  population, the bulk of which was housed towards the north and west  sides, where the remains of an immense number of dwellings may still  be seen. The temples were crowded together in a small square enclosure,  concentric with the walls of the enceinte, and the principal sanctuary  was dedicated to Nekhabit, the vulture goddess, who gave her name to the  city.* This enclosure formed a kind of citadel, where the garrison could  hold out when the outer part had fallen into the enemy's hands. The  times were troublous; the open country was repeatedly wasted by war, and  the peasantry had more than once to seek shelter behind the protecting  ramparts of the town, leaving their lands to lie fallow.         * A part of the latter temple, that which had been rebuilt       in the Saite epoch, was still standing at the beginning of       the XIXth century, with columns bearing the cartouches of       Hakori; it was destroyed about the year 1825, and       Champollion found only the foundations of the walls.

Famine constantly resulted from these disturbances, and it taxed all the  powers of the ruling prince to provide at such times for his people. A  chief of the Commissariat, Bebi by name, who lived about this period,  gives us a lengthy account of the number of loaves, oxen, goats, and  pigs, which he allowed to all the inhabitants both great and little,  down even to the quantity of oil and incense, which he had taken care to  store up for them: his prudence was always justified by the issue, for  \"during the many years in which the famine recurred, he distributed  grain in the city to all those who hungered.\"    Babai, the first of the lords of El-Kab whose name has come down to  us, was a captain in the service of Saqnunri Tiuaqni.* His son Ahmosi,  having approached the end of his career, cut a tomb for himself in the  hill which overlooks the northern side of the town. He relates on  the walls of his sepulchre, for the benefit of posterity, the most  praiseworthy actions of his long life. He had scarcely emerged from  childhood when he was called upon to act for his father, and before his  marriage he was appointed to the command of the barque _The Calf._ From  thence he was promoted to the ship _The North_, and on account of his  activity he was chosen to escort his namesake the king on foot, whenever  he drove in his chariot. He repaired to his post at the moment when the  decisive war against the Hyksos broke out.         * There are still some doubts as to the descent of this       Ahmosi. Some authorities hold that Babai was the name of his       father and Abina that of his grandfather; others think that       Babai was his father and Abina his mother; others, again,       make out Babai and Abina to be variants of the same name,       probably a Semitic one, borne by the father of Ahmosi; the       majority of modern Egyptologists (including myself) regard       this last hypothesis as being the most probable one.    The tradition current in the time of the Ptolemies reckoned the number  of men under the command of King Ahmosis when he encamped before  Avaris at 480,000. This immense multitude failed to bring matters to a  successful issue, and the siege dragged on indefinitely. The king afc  length preferred to treat with the Shepherds, and gave them permission  to retreat into Syria safe and sound, together with their wives, their  children, and all their goods. This account, however, in no way agrees  with the all too brief narration of events furnished by the inscription  in the tomb. The army to which Egypt really owed its deliverance was  not the undisciplined rabble of later tradition, but, on the contrary,  consisted of troops similar to those which subsequently invaded Syria,  some 15,000 to 20,000 in number, fully equipped and ably officered,  supported, moreover, by a fleet ready to transfer them across the canals  and arms of the river in a vigorous condition and ready for the battle.*         * It may be pointed out that Ahmosi, son of Abina, was a       sailor and a leader of sailors; that he passed from one       vessel to another, until he was at length appointed to the       command of one of the most important ships in the royal       fleet. Transport by water always played considerable part in       the wars which were carried on in Egyptian territory; I have       elsewhere drawn attention to campaigns conducted in this       manner under the Horacleopolitan dynasties, and we shall see       that the Ethiopian conquerors adopted the same mode of       transit in the course of their invasion of Egypt.

Harmhabi, who was continually  looking for opportunities to put down injustice and to punish deceit,  at length decided to pro-mulgate a very severe edict against the  magistrates and the double-dealing officials: any of them who was found  to have neglected his duty was to have his nose cut off, and was to  be sent into perpetual exile to Zalu, on the eastern frontier. His  commands, faithfully carried out, soon produced a salutary effect, and  as he would on no account relax the severity of the sentence, exactions  were no longer heard of, to the advantage of the revenue of the State.  On the last day of each month the gates of his palace were open to every  one.    [Illustration: 127.jpg AMENOTHES IV. FROM A FRAGMENT USED AGAIN BY  HARMHABI]         Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a sketch by Prisse d'Avennes.    Any one on giving his name to the guard could enter the court of honour,  where he would find food in abundance to satisfy his hunger while he was  awaiting an audience. The king all the while was seated in the sight  of all at the tribune, whence he would throw among his faithful friends  necklaces and bracelets of gold: he inquired into complaints one after  another, heard every case, announced his judgments in brief words, and  dismissed his subjects, who went away proud and happy at having had  their affairs dealt with by the sovereign himself.*         * All these details are taken from a stele discovered in       1882. The text is so mutilated that it is impossible to give       a literal rendering of it in all its parts, but the sense is       sufficiently clear to warrant our rilling up the whole with       considerable certainty.    The portraits of Harmhabi which have come down to us give us the  impression of a character at once energetic and agreeable. The most  beautiful of these is little more than a fragment broken off a  black granite statue. Its mournful expression is not pleasing to the  spectator, and at the first view alienates his sympathy. The face, which  is still youthful, breathes an air of melancholy, an expression which  is somewhat rare among the Pharaohs of the best period: the thin and  straight nose is well set on the face, the elongated eyes have somewhat  heavy lids; the large, fleshy lips, slightly contracted at the corners  of the mouth, are cut with a sharpness that gives them singular vigour,  and the firm and finely modelled chin loses little of its form from the  false beard depending from it. Every detail is treated with such freedom  that one would think the sculptor must have had some soft material to  work upon, rather than a rock almost hard enough to defy the chisel;  the command over it is so complete that the difficulty of the work is  forgotten in the perfection of the result. The dreamy expression of his  face, however, did not prevent Harmhabi from displaying beyond Egypt, as  within it, singular activity.    [Illustration: 128.jpg HARMHABI]         Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a Autograph by Emil Brugsch-Bey.    Although Egypt had never given up its claims to dominion over the whole  river-valley, as far as the plains of Sennar, yet since the time of  Amenothes III. no sovereign had condescended, it would I appear, to  conduct in person the expeditions directed against the tribes of! the  Upper Nile. Harmhabi was anxious to revive the custom which imposed  upon the Pharaohs the obligation to make their first essay in arms in  Ethiopia, as Horus, son of Isis, had done of yore, and he seized the  pretext of the occurrence of certain raids there to lead a body of  troops himself into the heart of the negro country.    [Illustration: 129.jpg THE VAULTED PASSAGE OF THE ROCK-TOMB AT GEBEL  SILSILEH]         Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a photograph by Insinger.    He had just ordered at this time the construction of the two southern  pylons at Karnak, and there was great activity in the quarries of  Silsileh. A commemorative chapel also was in course of excavation here  in the sandstone rock, and he had dedicated it to his father, Amon-Ba of  Thebes, coupling with him the local divinities, Hapi the Nile, and Sobku  the patron of Ombos. The sanctuary is excavated somewhat deeply into  the hillside, and the dark rooms within it are decorated with the usual  scenes of worship, but the vaulted approach to them displays upon its  western wall the victory of the king. We see here a figure receiving  from Amon the assurance of a long and happy life, and another letting  fly his arrows at a host of fleeing enemies; Ethiopians raise their  heads to him in suppliant gesture; soldiers march past with their  captives; above one of the doors we see twelve military leaders marching  and carrying the king aloft upon their shoulders, while a group of  priests and nobles salute him, offering incense.*         * The significance of the monument was pointed out first by       Champollion. The series of races conquered was represented       at Karnak on the internal face of one of the pylons built by       Harmhabi; it appears to have been \"usurped\" by Ramses II.    At this period Egyptian ships were ploughing the Red Sea, and their  captains were renewing official relations with Puanit. Somali chiefs  were paying visits to the palace, as in the time of Thutmosis III. The  wars of Amon had, in fact, begun again. The god, having suffered neglect  for half a century, had a greater need than ever of gold and silver  to fill his coffers; he required masons for his buildings, slaves and  cattle for his farms, perfumed essences and incense for his daily rites.  His resources had gradually become exhausted, and his treasury would  soon be empty if he did not employ the usual means to replenish it. He  incited Harmhabi to proceed against the countries from which, in olden  times he had enriched himself--to the south in the first place, and  then, having decreed victory there, and having naturally taken for  himself the greater part of the spoils, he turned his attention to Asia.

The black spots are due to the torches of the fellahin of       the neighbourhood who have visited the rock tomb in bygone       years.    In the latter campaign the Egyptian troops took once more the route  through Coele-Syria, and if the expedition experienced here more  difficulties than on the banks of the Upper Nile, it was, nevertheless,  brought to an equally triumphant conclusion. Those of their adversaries  who had offered an obstinate resistance were transported into other  lands, and the rebel cities were either razed to the ground or given to  the flames: the inhabitants having taken refuge in the mountains, where  they were in danger of perishing from hunger, made supplications for  peace, which was granted to them on the usual conditions of doing homage  and paying tribute.*         * These details are taken from the fragment of an       inscription now in the museum at Vienna; Bergmann, and also       Erman, think that we have in this text the indication of an       immigration into Egypt of a tribe of the Monatiu.    We do not exactly know how far he penetrated into the country; the  list of the towns and nations over which he boasts of having triumphed  contains, along with names unknown to us, some already famous or soon to  become so--Arvad, Pibukhu, the Khati, and possibly Alasia. The Haui-Nibu  themselves must have felt the effects of the campaign, for several of  their chiefs associated, doubtless, with the Phoenicians, presented  themselves before the Pharaoh at Thebes. Egypt was maintaining,  therefore, its ascendency, or at least appearing to maintain it in  those regions where the kings of the XVIIIth dynasty had ruled after  the campaigns of Thutmosis I., Thutmosis III., and Amenothes II. Its  influence, nevertheless, was not so undisputed as in former days; not  that the Egyptian soldiers were less valiant, but owing to the fact  that another power had risen up alongside them whose armies were strong  enough to encounter them on the field of battle and to obtain a victory  over them.    Beyond Naharaim, in the deep recesses of the Amanus and Taurus, there  had lived, for no one knows how many centuries, the rude and warlike  tribes of the Khati, related not so, much to the Semites of the Syrian  plain as to the populations of doubtful race and language who occupied  the upper basins of the Halys and Euphrates.* The Chaldaean conquest  had barely touched them; the Egyptian campaign had not more effect, and  Thutmosis III. himself, after having crossed their frontiers and sacked  several of their towns, made no serious pretence to reckon them among  his subjects. Their chiefs were accustomed, like their neighbours, to  use, for correspondence with other countries, the cuneiform mode of  writing; they had among them, therefore, for this purpose, a host of  scribes, interpreters, and official registrars of events, such as we  find to have accompanied the sovereigns of Assyria and Babylon.**  These chiefs were accustomed to send from time to time a present to the  Pharaoh, which the latter was pleased to regard as a tribute,*** or  they would offer, perhaps, one of their daughters in marriage to the  king at Thebes, and after the marriage show themselves anxious to  maintain good faith with their son-in-law.         * Halevy asserts that the Khati were Semites, and bases his       assertion on materials of the Assyrian period. Thes Khati,       absorbed in Syria by the Semites, with whom they were       blended, appear to have been by origin a non-Semitic people.         ** A letter from the King of the Khati to the Pharaoh   "]]]
