I have met nothing which would touch the argument in the  text. The following is the testimony of Dr. Koelle, the best possible  witness on the subject:    \"It is true the Mohammedan nations in the interior of Africa, namely,  the Bornuese, Mandengas, Pulas, etc., invited by the weak and  defenseless condition of the surrounding negro tribes, still  occasionally make conquests, and after subduing a tribe of pagans, by  almost exterminating its male population and committing the most  horrible atrocities, impose upon those that remain the creed of Islam;  but keeping in view the whole of the Mohammedan world this fitful  activity reminds one only of these green branches sometimes seen on  trees, already, and for long, decayed at the core from age.\"--_Food for  Reflection_, p. 37.

Some remedy for this intolerable evil should be devised.  At present the magistrates of all our conterminous districts require,  or expect, that their charges against any offender in Oude, who has  committed a crime in their districts, shall be held to be sufficient  for their arrest; but some of them, on the other band, require that  nothing less than some unattainable judicial proof, on the part of  the officers of the Oude Government, shall be held to be sufficient  to justify the arrest of any Oude offender who takes refuge in our  districts. They hold, that the sole object of the Oude authorities is  to get revenue defaulters into their power, and that the charges  against them for heinous crimes are invented solely for that purpose.  No doubt this is often the object, and that other charges are  sometimes invented, for the sole purpose of securing the arrest and  surrender of revenue defaulters; but the Oude revenue defaulters who  take refuge in our districts are for the most part, the tallookdars,  or great landholders, who, either before or after they do so,  invariably fight with the Oude authorities, and murder and plunder  indiscriminately, in order to reduce them to their own terms.    The Honourable the Court of Directors justly require that requisition  for the surrender of offenders by and from British officers and  Native States, shall be limited to persons charged with having  committed heinous crimes within their respective territories; and  that the obligation to surrender such offenders shall be strictly  reciprocal, unless, in any special case, there be very strong reason  for a departure from the rule.* But some magistrates of districts  disregard altogether applications made to them by the sovereign of  Oude, through the British Resident, for the arrest of subjects of  Oude who have committed the most atrocious robberies and murders in  the Oude territory in open day, and in the sight of hundreds; and  allow refugees from Oude to collect and keep up gangs of robbers  within their own districts, and rob and murder within the Oude  territory. Happily such Magistrates are rare. Government, in a letter  dated the 25th February, 1848, state--\"that it is the duty of the  magistrates of our districts bordering on Oude to adopt vigorous  measures for preventing the assembling or entertaining of followers  by any party, for the purpose of committing acts of violence on the  Oude side of the frontier.\"    [* See their letter to the Government of India, 27th May 1835.]    _December_ 8, 1849.--Pukharpoor, a distance of fourteen miles, over a  fine plain of good soil, scantily tilled. For some miles the road lay  through Rajah Hurdut Sing's estate of Bumnootee, which was, with the  rest of the district of Bahraetch and Gonda, plundered by Rughbur  Sing, during the two years that he held the contract. We passed  through no village or hamlet, but saw some at a distance from the  road, with their dwellings of naked mud walls, the abodes of fear and  wretchedness; but the plain is well studded with groves and fine  single trees, and the crops are good where there are any on the  ground. Under good management, the country would be exceedingly  beautiful, and was so until within the last four years.    In the evening I had a long talk with the people of the village, who  had assembled round our tents. Many of them had the goitre; but they  told me, that in this and all the villages within twenty miles the  disease had, of late years, diminished; that hardly one-quarter of  the number that used to suffer from it had now the disease; that the  quality of the water must have improved, though they knew not why, as  they still drank from the same wells. These wells must penetrate into  some bed of mineral or other substance, which produces this disease  of the glands, and may in time exhaust it. But it is probable, that  the number who suffer from this disease has diminished merely with  the rest of the population, and that the proportion which the  goitered bear to the ungoitered may be still the same. They told me  that they had been plundered of all their stock and moveable property  by the terrible scourge, Rughber Sing, during his reign of two years,  and could not hope to recover from their present state of poverty for  many more; that their lands were scantily tilled, and the crops had  so failed for many years, since this miscreant's rule, that the  district which used to supply Lucknow with grain was obliged to draw  grain from it, and even from Cawnpore. This is true, and grain has in  consequence been increasing in price ever since we left Lucknow. It  is now here almost double the price that it is at Lucknow, while it  is usually twice as cheap here.    _December_ 9, 1849.--Bahraetch, ten miles north-east. We encamped on  a fine sward, on the left bank of the Surjoo river, a beautiful clear  stream. The cultivation very scanty, but the soil good, with water  everywhere, within a few feet of the surface. Groves and single trees  less numerous; and of villages and hamlets we saw none. Under good  government, the whole country might, in a few years, be made a  beautiful garden. The river Surjoo is like a winding stream in a  park; and its banks might, everywhere, be cultivated to the water's  edge. No ravines, jungle, or steep embankments. It is lamentable to  see so fine a country in so wretched a state.    The Turae forest begins a few miles to the north of Bahraetch, and  some of the great baronial landholders have their residence and  strongholds within it. The Rajah of Toolseepoor is one of them. He is  a kind-hearted old man, and a good landlord and subject; but he has  lately been driven out by his young and reprobate son, at the  instigation and encouragement of a Court favourite. The Rajah had  discharged an agent, employed by him at Court for advocating the  cause of his son while in rebellion against his father. The agent  then made common cause with the son, and secured the interest of two  powerful men at Court, Balkrishen Dewan and Gholam Ruza, the deputy  minister, who has charge of the estates in the Hozoor Tehsel. The  jurisdiction over the estate had been transferred from the local  authorities to the Hozoor Tehsel; and, by orders from Court, the  father's friends, the Bulrampoor and other Rajahs of the clan, were  prevented from continuing the aid they had afforded to support the  father's authority. The father unwilling to have the estate  devastated by a contest with the band of ruffians whom his son had  collected, retired, and allowed him to take possession. The son  seized upon all the property the father had left, and now employs it  in maintaining this band and rewarding the services of Court  favourites. The Nazim of the district is not permitted to interfere,  to restore rights or preserve order in the estate, nor would he,  perhaps, do either, if so permitted, for he has been brought up in a  bad school, and is not a good man. The pretext at Court is, that the  father is deranged; but, though not wise, he is learned, and no man  can be more sober than he is, or better disposed towards his  sovereign and tenants. That he is capable of managing his estate, is  shown by the excellent condition in which he left it.    Prethee Put, of Paska, is not worse than many of the tallookdars of  Oude, who now disturb the peace of the country; and I give a brief  sketch of his history, as a specimen of the sufferings inflicted on  the people by the wild licence which such landholders enjoy under the  weak, profligate, and apathetic government of Oude.    Keerut Sing, the tallookdar of Paska, on the left bank of the Ghagra,  between Fyzabad and Byram-ghaut, was one of the Chehdwara  landholders, and had five sons, the eldest Dirgpaul Sing, and the  second Prethee Put, the hero of this brief history. Before his death,  Keerut Sing made over the management of his estate to his eldest son  and heir; but gave to his second son a portion of land out of it, for  his own subsistence and that of his family. The father and eldest son  continued to reside together in the fort of Dhunolee, situated on the  right bank of the Ghagra, opposite Paska. Prethee Put took up his  residence in his portion of the estate at Bumhoree, collected a gang  of the greatest ruffians in the country, and commenced his trade, and  that of so many of his class, as an indiscriminate plunderer. Keerut  Sing and his eldest son, Dirgpaul, continued to pay the Government  demand punctually, to obey the local authorities, and manage the  estate with prudence.    Prethee Put, in 1836, attacked and took a despatch of treasure,  consisting of twenty-six thousand rupees, on its way to Lucknow, from  the Nazim of Bahraetch. In 1840 he attacked and took another of  eighty-five thousand rupees, on its way to Lucknow from the same  place. With these sums, and the booty which he acquired from the  plunder of villages and travellers, he augmented his gang, built a  fort at Bumhoree, and extended his depredations. In January 1842, his  father, who had been long ill, died. The local authorities demanded  five thousand rupees from the eldest son, Dirgpaul Sing, on his  accession. He promised to pay, and sent his eldest son, Dan Bahader  Sing, a lad of eighteen, as a hostage for the payment to the Nazim.  Soon after, Prethee Pat attacked the fort of Dhunolee, in which his  elder brother resided with his family, killed fifty-six persons, and  made Dirgpaul, his wife, and three other sons prisoners. Dirgpaul's  sister tried to conceal her brother under some clothes; but, under a  solemn oath from Prethee Put, that no personal violence should be  offered"]]]
