On the  ninth day of July, William detached general Douglas with a considerable  body of horse and foot towards Athlone, while he himself, having left  Trelawny to command at Dublin, advanced with the rest of his army to  Inchiquin in his way to Kilkenny. Colonel Grace, the governor of Athlone  for king James, being summoned to surrender, fired a pistol at the  trumpeter, saying, \"These are my terms.\" Then Douglas resolved to  undertake the siege of the place, which was naturally very strong, and  defended by a resolute garrison. An inconsiderable breach was made, when  Douglas, receiving intelligence that Sarsfield was on his march to the  relief of the besieged, abandoned the enterprise after having lost above  four hundred men in the attempt. The king continued his march to the  westward; and, by dint of severe examples, established such order and  discipline in his army, that the peasants were secure from the least  violence. At Carlow he detached the duke of Ormond to take possession of  Kilkenny, where that nobleman regaled him in his own castle, which  the enemy had left undamaged. While the army encamped at Carrick,  major-general Kirke was sent to Waterford, the garrison of which,  consisting of two regiments, capitulated upon condition of marching out  with their arms and baggage, and being conducted to Mallow. The fort of  Duncannon was surrendered on the same terms. Here the lord Dover and the  lord George Howard were admitted to the benefit of the king's mercy and  protection.          HE INVESTS LIMERICK; IS OBLIGED TO RAISE THE SIEGE.    On the first day of August, William being at Chapel-Izard, published a  second declaration of mercy, confirming the former, and even extending  it to persons of superior rank and station, whether natives or  foreigners, provided they would, by the twenty-fifth day of the month,  lay down their arms and submit to certain conditions. This offer of  indemnity produced very little effect, for the Irish were generally  governed by their priests, and the news of the victory which the French  fleet had obtained over the English and Dutch, was circulated with such  exaggerations as elevated their spirits, and effaced all thoughts of  submission. The king had returned to Dublin with a view to embark for  England, but receiving notice that the designs of his domestic enemies  were discovered and frustrated, that the fleet was repaired, and the  French navy retired to Brest, he postponed his voyage and resolved to  reduce Limerick; in which Monsieur Boisseleau commanded as governor, and  the duke of Berwick and colonel Sarsfield acted as inferior officers.  On the ninth day of August, the king having called in his detachment and  advanced into the neighbourhood of the place, summoned the commander to  deliver the town; and Boisseleau answered, that he imagined the best way  to gain the good opinion of the prince of Orange, would be a vigorous  defence of the town which his majesty had committed to his charge.  Before the place was fully invested, colonel Sarsfield, with a body of  horse and dragoons, passed the Shannon in the night, intercepted the  king's train of artillery on its way to the camp, routed the troops that  guarded it, disabled the cannon, destroyed the carriages, waggons, and  ammunition, and returned in safety to Limerick. Notwithstanding this  disaster, the trenches were opened on the seventeenth day of the month,  and a battery was raised with some cannon brought from Waterford. The  siege was carried on with vigour, and the place defended with great  resolution. At length the king ordered his troops to make a lodgment in  the covered way or counterscarp, which was accordingly assaulted with  great fury; but the assailants met with such a warm reception from the  besieged, that they were repulsed with the loss of twelve hundred men  either killed on the spot or mortally wounded. This disappointment,  concurring with the badness of the weather, which became rainy and  unwholesome, induced the king to renounce his undertaking. The heavy  baggage and cannon being sent away, the army decamped and marched  towards Clonmel. William having constituted the lord Sydney and Thomas  Coningsby lords justices of Ireland, and left the command of the army  with count Solmes, embarked at Duncannon with prince George of Denmark  on the fifth of September, and next day arrived in King road, near  Bristol, from whence he repaired to Windsor.          CORK AND KINSALE REDUCED.    About the latter end of this month the earl of Marlborough arrived in  Ireland with five thousand English troops, to attack Cork and Kinsale in  conjunction with a detachment from the great army, according to a scheme  he had proposed to king William. Having landed his soldiers without much  opposition in the neighbourhood of Cork, he was joined by five thousand  men under the prince of Wirtemberg, between whom and the earl a dispute  arose about the command; but this was compromised by the interposition  of La Mellionere. The place being invested, and the batteries raised,  the besiegers proceeded with such rapidity that a breach was soon  effected. Colonel Mackillicut the governor demanded a parley, and  hostages were exchanged; but he rejected the conditions that were  offered, and hostilities recommenced with redoubled vigour. The duke  of Grafton, who served on this occasion as a volunteer, was mortally  wounded in one of the attacks, and died regretted as a youth of  promising talents. Preparations being made for a general assault,  the besieged thought proper to capitulate, and surrendered themselves  prisoners of war. Besides the governor and colonel Bicaut, the victor  found the earls of Clancarty and Tyrone among the individuals of  the garrison. Marlborough having taken possession of Cork, detached  brigadier Villiers with a body of horse and dragoons to summon the town  and forts of Kinsale, and next day advanced with the rest of the forces.  The old fort was immediately taken by assault; but sir Edward Scott,  who commanded the other, sustained a regular siege until the breach  was practicable, and then obtained an honourable capitulation. These  maritime places being reduced, all communication between France and  the enemy on this side of the island was cut off, and the Irish  were confined to Ulster, where they could not subsist without great  difficulty. The earl of Marlborough having finished this expedition in  thirty days, returned with his prisoners to England, where the fame of  this exploit added greatly to his reputation.          THE FRENCH FORCES QUIT IRELAND.    During these transactions count de Lausan, commander of the French  auxiliaries in Ireland, lay inactive in the neighbourhood of Galway, and  transmitted such a lamentable account of his situation to the court of  France, that transports were sent over to bring home the French forces.  In these he embarked with his troops, and the command of the Irish  forces devolved to the duke of Berwick, though it was afterwards  transferred to M. St. Ruth. Lausan was disgraced at Versailles for  having deserted the cause before it was desperate: Tyrconnel, who  accompanied him in his voyage, solicited the French court for a further  supply of officers, arms, clothes, and ammunition for the Irish army,  which he said would continue firm to the interest of king James if thus  supported. Meanwhile they formed themselves into separate bodies  of freebooters, and plundered the country, under the appellation of  rapparees: while the troops of king William either enjoyed their ease in  quarters, or imitated the rapine of the enemy; so that between both the  poor people were miserably harassed.          SAVOY JOINS THE CONFEDERACY.    The affairs of the continent had not yet undergone any change of  importance, except in the conduct of the duke of Savoy, who renounced  his neutrality, engaged in an alliance with the emperor and king of  Spain; and, in a word, acceded to the grand confederacy. He had no  sooner declared himself, than Catinat the French general entered his  territories at the head of eighteen thousand men, and defeated him in  a pitched battle near Saluces, which immediately surrendered to the  conqueror. Then he reduced Savillana, Villa Franca, with several other  places, pursued the duke to Carignan, surprised Suza, and distributed  his forces in winter quarters, partly in Provence and partly in the  duchy of Savoy, which St. Ruth had lately reduced under the dominion  of France. The duke finding himself disappointed in the succours he  expected from the emperor and the king of Spain, demanded assistance of  the states-general and king William: to this last he sent an ambassador,  to congratulate him upon his accession to the throne of England. The  confederates in their general congress at the Hague, had agreed that  the army of the states under prince Waldeck should oppose the forces  of France, commanded by the duke of Luxembourg in Flanders; while the  elector of Brandenburgh should observe the marquis de Boufflers on  the Moselle: but before the troops of Brandenburgh could be assembled,  Boufflers encamped between the Sambre and the Mouse, and maintained a  free communication with Luxembourg.          PRINCE WALDECK DEFEATED.    Prince Waldeck understanding that this general intended to cross  the Sambre between Namur and Charleroy, in order to lay the Spanish  territories under contribution, decamped from the river Pieton, and  detached the count of Berlo with a great body of horse to observe  the motions of the enemy. He was encountered by the French army near  Fleuras, and slain: and his troops, though supported by two other  detachments, were hardly able to rejoin the main body, which continued  all night in order of battle. Next day they were attacked by the French,  who"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19218"],[0,"The History of England in Three Volumes, Vol.III. (#20)"],[1,"proper adjustment of this nice affair.  Still Chatham kept aloof from the business, and he either would not from  illness, or could not from despondency, give his thoughts and directions  in writing as to what steps to take and what further motion to make. In  the end, therefore, after many divisions, a bill was framed, granting  nearly all that was asked for by the company, and binding it to pay  L400,000 per annum, in half-yearly payments, and to indemnify the  exchequer, should any loss be sustained in consequence of lower-ing  the inland duties on tea, and the allowance of the drawback on its  exportation. But the term of this contract was limited to two years;  commencing from the 1st of February of the current year; so that the  company had a further interference with their territories and wealth in  prospect: but till the expiration of that term, their territorial rights  were fully admitted.    While this subject was under parliamentary discussion, the proprietors  of East India stock demanded of the court, that, as the company had  gained so much territory and so many new advantages, a larger dividend  should be declared. In compliance with this demand the dividends were  increased from ten to twelve and a half per cent., which step called for  the interference of government. In order to check a proceeding which was  considered calculated to renew the gambling stock and share jobbing of  the memorable South Sea year, two bills were brought into the house by  ministers; one for regulating the qualifications of voters in trading  companies, and the other for restraining and limiting the making of  dividends by the company; fixing them at ten per cent. This latter bill  encountered a most violent opposition both by the company and in the  house, particularly by the lords, but it was carried, and received the  royal sanction.          AMERICAN TAXATION.    Soon after the reassembling of parliament Mr. Grenville, intent upon  taxing America, had proposed saddling that country for the support  of troops, &c, and the chancellor of the exchequer, in reply, pledged  himself to the house to find a revenue in the colonies sufficient to  meet the expenses. Accordingly, during the session, he introduced a  bill to lay certain duties on glass, tea, paper, and painters' colours,  imported from Great Britain into America. This bill was carried through  both houses with the greatest facility, and another act passed with  equal facility, which placed these duties, and all other customs and  duties in the American colonies, under the management of the  king's resident commissioners. These acts were followed by one more  justifiable. The assembly of New York had refused to comply with the  statute requiring a grant of additional rations to the troops stationed  in that province; and the refractory disposition of the colonists made  it manifest that their intention was to deny the jurisdiction of Great  Britain altogether. It was evident that a spirit of infatuation had  taken deep root in America, and it was easy to foresee that confusion  and bloodshed would one day ensue. Under these circumstances, and with a  view of checking the onward progress of the march of insubordination, an  act was passed, prohibiting the governor, council, and assembly of New  York from passing any legislative act, till satisfaction should be given  as to the treatment of the commissioners and troops, and submission paid  to the Mutiny Act. But no measure which the parliament of England could  devise, whether coercive or conciliatory, could tame the fierce spirit  which the Stamp Act had created, and the new scheme of duties on imports  was calculated to confirm in hostility to Great Britain. The breach grew  wider and wider, until at length it was past all remedy.          CHANGES IN THE MINISTRY.    Parliament was prorogued on the 2nd of July, with a speech from his  majesty, in which he acknowledged annuities of L8000, which had been  settled during this session on each of the king's brothers; namely, the  Dukes of York, Gloucester, and Cumberland. During the recess, an event  occurred which threatened to overthrow the tottering cabinet. This  was the death of Charles Townshend, who suddenly expired on the 4th of  September. But before his death, there were signs of a dissolution of  the ministry, and Townshend was actually engaged in the projection of  a new administration. Lord Northington and General Conway had both  expressed a wish to resign, and the Duke of Grafton showed a greater  disposition for pleasure than for business, whence negociations were  opened by Townshend with the Rockingham party.    His death set these aside, but several changes soon afterwards took  place among the great officers of state. The Earl of Chatham, afflicted  with the gout, and indisposed to business, still remained idle; and the  king therefore, authorized the Duke of Grafton to make the necessary  changes in the cabinet. All that could be done, however, before the  meeting of parliament, was to entrust the seals of the office of  chancellor of the exchequer to Lord Mansfield, chief justice of the  king's bench, and to empower him to renew negociations with the Duke of  Bedford, in which the Duke of Grafton had been unsuccessful.    The ministry was in this unsettled state when the parliament met in  November. The principal point recommended to its attention by his  majesty was the high price of corn, with the consequent suffering of the  poor. This subject was also impressed on parliament by strong petitions  from all parts of the country; and an act was passed, extending the  prohibition against exportation, and encouraging the importation of  grain.    In the midst of these proceedings, Lord North was prevailed upon to  accept the chancellorship of the exchequer; Mr. Thomas Townshend, cousin  of the late Charles Townshend, succeeded him as joint paymaster of the  forces; and his place, as one of the lords of the treasury, was given  to Mr. Jenkinson. Soon after this, General Conway and Lord Northington  insisted on resigning, and fresh overtures were made to the Duke of  Bedford. That nobleman having been gained over, Earl Gower became  president of the council in the place of Lord Northington, and Lord  Weymouth secretary of state in lieu of Conway. At the same time the Earl  of Hillsborough was appointed third secretary of state, which was a new  office; and he was succeeded as joint paymaster with Lord North, by  the Duke of Bedford's ally, Lord Sandwich. General Conway was  appointed lieutenant-general of the ordnance; and the ministry, thus  reconstructed, took the name of the Duke of Grafton's administration. As  for the Earl of Chatham he was still a cipher, keeping aloof at Bath, or  at Burton Pynsent, or at Hayes in Kent, where he would neither see  nor speak to anybody. But he still retained the privy seal, and still  retained the emoluments of office, and the king was afraid to deprive  him of them.    {A.D. 1768}    Parliament, in this session, extended the act which restricted the  East India Company's dividends to ten per cent.; but scarcely any  other business was transacted beside the voting of supplies. The king  prorogued parliament on the 10th of March, and on the 12th of that month  it was dissolved by proclamation, it having nearly completed its legal  term of seven years.          PROCEEDINGS IN AMERICA.    The new Revenue Act, which imposed duties on various articles of  merchandise, excited great resentment in America. It was looked upon by  the colonists, indeed, as a deceptive measure, having a similar object  to that of the Stamp Act, and it had the effect of reviving a question,  which the British parliament should have endeavoured to have consigned  to utter oblivion. The Americans, animated by a spirit of resistance,  would now no longer acknowledge that distinction between external and  internal taxation, on which they had at first grounded their claim  for relief. Their presses teemed with invectives against the British  legislature, and it was confidently asserted that England was resolved  to reduce the colonies to a state of abject slavery. The assembly of  Massachusets Bay took the lead in opposing the government, and it soon  engaged the other colonies to join in resisting the mother-country.  A petition was likewise sent by that house to the king, and letters,  signed by their speaker, to several of the British cabinet, containing  statements of their rights and grievances, and soliciting relief.    A letter was also sent to Mr. De Berdt, their agent in London,  instructing him to oppose the obnoxious measure on every ground of right  and policy. This letter adverted to the appropriation of the revenue  intended to be thus unconstitutionally raised--stating that it was to  supply a support for governors and judges, and a standing army. On both  these grounds, as well as its unconstitutional nature, the house opposed  it, remarking, on the subject of the standing army, in the following  terms, by way of remonstrance:--\"As Englishmen and British subjects, we  have an aversion to a standing army, which we reckon dangerous to our  civil liberties; and considering the examples of ancient times, it seems  a little surprising that a mother-state should trust large bodies of  mercenary troops in her colonies, at so great a distance from her; lest,  in process of time, when the spirits of the people shall be depressed by  the military power, another Caesar should arise and usurp the authority  of his master.\"    A circular letter was sent, in the name of the assembly of Massachusets  Bay, to the other provincial assemblies, informing them of the measures  already taken; and it was couched in such terms that it had the effect  of lulling the suspicions of some whose opinions were not so violent,  and of making many of them firm adherents to the cause of liberty.
