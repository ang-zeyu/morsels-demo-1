[Illustration: Ruins at Reims. Upper and Lower Plates--The Cathedral.  Middle Plate--The Archbishop's Palace.]    Adjoining the cathedral was the archbishop's palace, famous the world  over, and its contents priceless. This was utterly destroyed. One of our  party, in looking about the ruins, picked up a large sized key, which  proved afterwards to be the key to the archbishop's residence. He was  given permission by the sub-prefect to retain this, and I subsequently  acquired it.    We also visited the market place and the old Notre Dame church built in  1149 by Charlemagne. This was a most beautiful church, the windows  almost equalling those of the Cathedral of St. Elme at Nancy, but  inferior to those in the Reims cathedral, said to have been the most  beautiful in the world. In this church we saw a statue of Jeanne D'Arc,  and a very fine painting of the \"Ascension\".    We were taken to the city hospital at Reims, which had been fired upon  and almost completely destroyed by the Germans while occupied by French  wounded. The range was obtained by the aviators, and then incendiary  bombs were fired. These bombs set fire to the buildings with which they  came in contact. We were told that hundreds of French soldiers were  killed with this mode of warfare. We could hear the bombs on the Aisne  front exploding while we were visiting the ruins of the hospital. We  were next shown around to view the ruins of the town. Twenty-five  hundred acres of houses were almost blown to pieces. We were told that  thousands of bodies of men, women and children were still under the  ruins. In an isolated part of these ruins, absolutely alone, we found  and talked to an old French woman, still occupying her house. She had  refused to move and insisted upon staying in her little home, one or two  rooms having been left.    Following this visit to the ruins we were permitted to enter the  trenches. A number of the party did not go to the end of the trenches.  However, I concluded to see all there was to be seen, and with Deputy  Damour and Mr. MacArthur, went, escorted by a staff officer detailed for  that duty, to the extreme limit. We went through the trenches to within  one thousand feet of the German firing lines. We could see the German  sentinels through periscopes, and were told to be careful and not show  our heads, which admonition was religiously obeyed.    This visit to the trenches was one of the most interesting parts of the  trip, and in spite of the danger, I was very glad that I had gone and  had nerve enough to go to the limit. We entered what is known as a  \"communication\" trench, leading from the edge of the city toward the  front. This was necessary, as the terrain was open and under range of  the German guns. Going down through this long trench we encountered a  network of others, apparently leading in all directions. Our guide knew  them well and led us forward until we could, by means of a contrivance  for that purpose, look over the top and see the German trenches, less  than one thousand yards away. We saw few German soldiers, although  occasionally we were shown where a sentinel was on duty, carefully  concealed to save himself from French bullets.    The trenches in this section are irregular in width and depth. As a  general thing they are not more than three feet wide at the bottom and  about five feet deep. The earth is thrown up at the side next to the  enemy. At short intervals along the trench holes are scooped out, into  which the soldiers can go when fighting is not actually in progress.  Some of these caves were quite large and had in them straw and sometimes  a bench. There were cooking utensils and buckets for water. The bottoms  of the trenches are generally dry, or were when we saw them. In some  places they have boards on the bottom. The sides are steep and are  constantly crumbling.    Some of the trenches we entered had been made by the Germans, others by  the French. Those close up to the front seemed to have been dug but a  short time, but farther back they were already beginning to look  ancient. In some places grass was growing in the sides and here and  there flowers. Some of these trenches had not been used to any extent  during the summer. They are so arranged that each line is connected with  the one in its front and rear by cross trenches, and it is through these  that the soldiers enter and leave the actual fighting zone.    [Illustration: Key of Archbishop's Palace at Reims and Bone from Twelfth  Century Tombs Opened by German Shells.]    We saw many French soldiers in the trenches. They seemed to be well fed  and comfortable. At the time we were there there was no actual fighting,  of course, but an occasional shot rang out across \"no man's land,\" when  sentries on either side thought they saw a chance to do execution. The  ground between Reims and the battle line is a complete network of these  trenches, and years will be required to level it again after the war is  over.    From the advanced trench toward the German lines, at the points where we  looked, there was no sign of war except an occasional shell hole and the  barbed wire entanglements. The country was green and seemed to be at  peace, except for the sound of the guns. It was hard to believe that we  were looking across a narrow strip, on the other side of which were  millions of armed men and every form of death and destruction that has  been invented. Yet all this was there.    Upon coming out of the trenches we were unable to find our automobiles,  the military authorities having ordered them to separate, so that they  would not prove an attraction to the German aeroplanes, otherwise they  would undoubtedly have been fired upon.    [Illustration: Trenches Visited by the Commission]    Following this visit to the trenches, we were taken to the famous wine  cellars of Heidsick & Co., containing twelve miles of underground  vaults. A few days previous to our visit a German bomb had struck the  Heidsick wine cellar and destroyed forty thousand bottles of champagne,  believed to be the largest number of bottles opened at any one time in  the history of the world. These vaults, during the bombardments, which  were numerous, are a safety place for the inhabitants and thousands take  refuge in the wine cellars. We were told that there was not a single  bottle of champagne missed, a testimony to the honesty of the French  people. This visit to the wine cellars was intensely interesting.    While driving about the ruined town, the automobile in which I happened  to be was guided by a chauffeur unfamiliar with the location, and he  drove us across the German lines within three minutes ride of the German  headquarters. The major in charge of the automobile squad discovered the  error. We were told afterwards that we had a narrow escape from being  made prisoners. While at Reims we were at all times within twenty-five  minutes walk of the Germans and within ten minutes ride in the motor.    The population at Reims before the war was one hundred and eighteen  thousand. It is now reduced to eighteen thousand, the other hundred  thousand having become refugees, soldiers and \"missing\". We visited a  Twelfth century cathedral which, strange to say, had not been touched.  While in this cathedral we could hear the guns booming.    We returned to Chalons on the Marne the same evening, arriving there at  8:30 P.M., it being considered unsafe to remain at Reims. After our  dinner at Chalons on the Marne, Dr. Mailloux timed the firing of the  cannon and announced that for a space of half an hour there was one  fired every two seconds.    We left Chalons on the Marne at 11:30 A.M. on the following day by  railroad. The train was filled with officers returning from the front.  We saw a number of Red Cross girls on this train. One had a double  decoration. As we passed along we saw thousands of soldiers enroute to  the front, among them one full regiment. We also saw a large detachment  of German prisoners being transferred, with the letters \"P. G.\" quite  large on the back of each prisoner. \"P. G.\" means prison garb.    In the railroad trains in both England and France appears the  following:--      Be Silent!    Be watchful!    Hostile ears are listening to you!    Issued by the Minister of War.          XVI.    BACK TO PARIS      We arrived at Paris at three o'clock P.M., October 17th, and here  received our first news of the submarine work off Nantucket. In the  evening we met Antoine Borrel, deputy from Savoy, on six days' leave of  absence from the Alsace Lorraine district. He entered the war a common  soldier and now has the Legion of Honor on his breast.    On Wednesday, October 11th, we visited Consul Thackara and arranged  about our passports.    I succeeded in securing some fine war relics and a partial line of  French war posters which I brought home with me.    On Thursday, October 12th, with Mr. Weare, of the United States Steel  Corporation, I called upon Consul Thackara, Charge d'Affairs Bliss, and  other friends at the Embassy. We also visited the general offices of the  Schneider Company.    On Friday, October 13th, a meeting of the Commissioners was held and,  although our passage had been engaged on the Rochambeau of the French  line, it was decided to cancel the passage and return to America by way  of the American line. This was a disappointment to some of the  Commissioners, although the change appeared to be inevitable. The  secretary of the Commission then set about to get us safely across the  Channel. We were told we would be convoyed by a British vessel, usually  used in carrying soldiers. We were fed on this information for three  days, telegrams were sent to the American Embassy in London and a lot of  valuable time wasted. The whole scheme proved to be a myth, and we were  obliged to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20467"],[0,"Handbook of the Trees of New England (#20)"],[1,"about half the nut, thin, shallow, with small, rarely much  thickened scales: acorn ovoid or globose, about 3/4 inch long.    =Horticultural Value.=--Hardy in New England; grows in all good dry or  moist soils, in open or partly shaded situations; maintains a nearly  uniform rate of growth till maturity, and is not seriously affected by  insects. It forms a fine individual tree and is useful in forest  plantations. Propagated from seed.    [Illustration: PLATE XLII.--Quercus Muhlenbergii.]      1. Winter buds.    2. Flowering branch.    3.

More or less common throughout the states east of the Mississippi;  westward apparently grading into _Q. Muhlenbergii_, within the limits of  New England mostly a low shrub, rarely assuming a tree-like habit. The  leaves vary from rather narrow-elliptical to broadly obovate, are rather  regularly and coarsely toothed, bright green and often lustrous on the  upper surface.      =Quercus rubra, L.=    RED OAK.    =Habitat and Range.=--Growing impartially in a great variety of soils,  but not on wet lands.         Nova Scotia and New Brunswick to divide west of Lake Superior.    Maine,--common, at least south of the central portions; New  Hampshire,--extending into Coos county, far north of the  White mountains; Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and  Connecticut,--common; probably in most parts of New England the most  common of the genus; found higher up the slopes of mountains than the  white oak.         South to Tennessee, Virginia, and along mountain ranges to Georgia;       reported from Florida; west to Minnesota, Nebraska, Kansas, and       Texas.    =Habit.=--The largest of the New England oaks, 50-85 feet high, with a  diameter of 2-6 feet above the swell of the roots; occasionally  attaining greater dimensions; trunk usually continuous to the top of the  tree, often heavily buttressed; point of branching higher than in the  white oak; branches large, less contorted, and rising at a sharper  angle, the lower sometimes horizontal; branchlets rather slender; head  extremely variable, in old trees with ample space for growth, open,  well-proportioned, and imposing; sometimes oblong in outline, wider near  the top, and sometimes symmetrically rounded, not so broad, however, as  the head of the white oak; conspicuous in summer by its bright green,  abundant foliage, which turns to dull purplish-red in autumn.    =Bark.=--Bark of trunk and lower parts of branches in old trees dark  gray, firmly, coarsely, and rather regularly ridged, smooth elsewhere;  in young trees greenish mottled gray, smooth throughout; season's shoots  at first green, taking a reddish tinge in autumn, marked with pale,  scattered dots.    =Winter Buds and Leaves.=--Buds ovate, conical, sharp-pointed. Leaves  simple, alternate, 4-8 inches long, 3-5 inches broad, bright green  above, paler beneath, dull brown in autumn; outline oval or obovate,  sometimes scarcely distinguishable by the character of its lobing from  _Q. tinctoria_; in the typical form, lobes broadly triangular or oblong,  with parallel sides bristle-pointed; leafstalks short; stipules linear,  soon falling.    =Inflorescence.=--Earliest of the oaks, appearing in late April or early  May, when the leaves are half-grown; sterile catkins 3-5 inches long;  calyx mostly 4-lobed; lobes rounded; stamens mostly 4; anthers yellow:  pistillate flowers short-stemmed; calyx lobes mostly 3 or 4; stigmas  long, spreading.    =Fruit.=--Maturing in the second year, single or in pairs, sessile or  short-stalked: cup sometimes turbinate, usually saucer-shaped with a  flat or rounded base, often contracted at the opening and surmounted by  a kind of border; scales closely imbricated, reddish-brown, more or less  downy, somewhat glossy, triangular-acute to obtuse, pubescent: acorn  nearly cylindrical or ovoid, tapering to a broad, rounded top.    =Horticultural Value.=--Hardy throughout New England; grows in all  well-drained soils, but prefers a rich, moist loam; more readily  obtainable than most of our oaks; in common with other trees of the  genus, nursery trees must be transplanted frequently to be moved with  safety; grows rapidly and is fairly free from disfiguring insects; the  oak-pruner occasionally lops off its twigs. When once established, it  grows as rapidly as the sugar maple, and is worthy of much more extended  use in street and landscape plantations. Propagated from the seed.

Maine,--valley of the Androscoggin, southward; New Hampshire and  Vermont,--not authoritatively reported by recent observers;  Massachusetts,--more common in the eastern than western sections,  sometimes covering considerable areas; Rhode Island and  Connecticut,--common.         South to the middle states and along the mountains to North       Carolina and Tennessee; reported from Florida; west to Minnesota,       Nebraska, and Missouri.    =Habit.=--A medium-sized tree, 30-50 feet high and 1-3 feet in trunk  diameter; attaining greater dimensions southward; trunk straight and  tapering, branches regular, long, comparatively slender, not contorted,  the lower nearly horizontal, often declined at the ends; branchlets  slender; head open, narrow-oblong or rounded, graceful; foliage deeply  cut, shining green in summer and flaming scarlet in autumn; the most  brilliant and most elegant of the New England oaks.    =Bark.=--Trunk in old trees dark gray, roughly and firmly ridged; inner  bark red; young trees and branches smoothish, often marked with dull red  seams and more or less mottled with gray.    =Winter Buds and Leaves.=--Buds small, reddish-brown, ovate to oval,  acutish, partially hidden by enlarged base of petiole. Leaves simple,  alternate, extremely variable, more commonly 3-6 inches long, two-thirds  as wide, bright green and shining above, paler beneath, smooth on both  sides but often with a tufted pubescence on the axils beneath, turning  scarlet in autumn, deeply lobed, the rounded sinuses sometimes reaching  nearly to the midrib; lobes 5-9, rather slender and set at varying  angles, sparingly toothed and bristly tipped; apex acute; base truncate  to acute; leafstalk 1-1-1/2 inches long, slender, swollen at base.    =Inflorescence.=--Early in May. Appearing when the leaves are half  grown; sterile catkins 2-4 inches long; calyx most commonly 4-parted;  pubescent; stamens commonly 4, exserted; anthers yellow, glabrous:  pistillate flowers red; stigmas long, spreading, reflexed.    =Fruit.=--Maturing in the autumn of the second year, single or in twos  or threes, sessile or on rather short footstalks: cup top-shaped or  cup-shaped, about half the length of the acorn, occasionally nearly  enclosing it, smooth, more or less polished, thin-edged; scales closely  appressed, firm, elongated, triangular, sides sometimes rounded,  homogeneous in the same plant: acorn 1/2-3/4 inch long, variable in  shape, oftenest oval to oblong: kernel white within; less bitter than  kernel of the black oak.    =Horticultural Value.=--Hardy throughout New England; grows in any  light, well-drained soil, but prefers a fertile loam. Occasionally  offered by nurserymen, but as it is disposed to make unsymmetrical young  trees it is not grown in quantity, and it is not desirable for streets.  Its rapid growth, hardiness, beauty of summer foliage, and its brilliant  colors in autumn make it desirable in ornamental plantations. Propagated  from the seed.
