It was published in  facsimile and illustrated by Visconti in the _Bullettino Comunale_,  1889, p. 340, tav. xi.-xii.    [43] See the _Annali dell' Instituto_, 1854, p. 28.    [44] The convent and its garden occupy the sites of the house of  Augustus, the temples of Vesta and Apollo, the Greek and Latin  libraries, and the Portico of the Danaids, described in _Ancient  Rome_, ch. v., p. 109. The estate has been owned successively by the  Mattei, Spada, and Ronconi families, and by Charles Mills. Its finest  ornament is a portico built by the Matteis in the sixteenth century  from the designs of Raffaellino del Colle. This pupil of Raphael was  also the painter of the exquisite frescoes representing Venus and  Cupid, Jupiter and Antiope, Hermaphrodite and Salmace, and other  subjects engraved by Marcantonio and Agostino Veneziano. These  frescoes, greatly injured by age and neglect, were restored in 1824,  by Camuccini, at the expense of Mr. Charles Mills.

Rome, according to an old saying, contains as many churches as there  are days in the year. This statement is too modest; the \"great  catalogue\" published by cardinal Mai[60] mentions over a thousand  places of worship, while nine hundred and eighteen are registered in  Professor Armellini's \"Chiese di Roma.\" A great many have disappeared  since the first institution, and are known only from ruins, or  inscriptions and chronicles. Others have been disfigured by  \"restorations.\" Without denying the fact that our sacred buildings  excel in quantity rather than quality, there is no doubt that as a  whole they form the best artistic and historic collection in the  world. Every age, from the apostolic to the present, every school,  every style has its representatives in the churches of Rome.    The assertion that the works of mediaeval architects have been  destroyed or modernized to such an extent as to leave a wide gap  between the classic and Renaissance periods, must have been made by  persons unacquainted with Rome; the churches and the cloisters of S.  Saba on the Aventine, of SS. Quattro Coronati on the Caelian, of S.  Giovanni a Porta Latina, of SS. Vincenzo e Anastasio alle Tre Fontane,  of S. Lorenzo fuori le Mura, are excellent specimens of mediaeval  architecture. Let students, archaeologists, and architects provide  themselves with a chronological table of our sacred buildings, and  select the best specimens for every quarter of a century, beginning  with the oratory of Aquila and Prisca, mentioned in the Epistles, and  ending with the latest contemporary creations; they cannot find a  better subject for their education in art and history.    From the point of view of their origin and structure, the churches of  Rome of the first six centuries may be divided into six classes:--    I. Rooms of private houses where the first prayer-meetings were held.    II. Scholae (memorial or banqueting halls in public cemeteries),  transformed into places of worship.    III. Oratories and churches built over the tombs of martyrs and  confessors.    IV. Houses of confessors and martyrs.    V. Pagan monuments, especially temples, converted into churches.    VI. Memorials of historical events.    In treating this subject we must bear in mind that early Christian  edifices in Rome were never named from a titular saint, but from their  founder, or from the owner of the property on which they were  established. The same rule applies to the suburban cemeteries, which  were always named from the owner of the ground above them, not from  the martyrs buried within. The statement is simple; but we are so  accustomed to calling the Lateran basilica \"S. Giovanni,\" or the  oratory of Pudens \"S. Pudentiana,\" that their original names (Basilica  Salvatoris, and Ecclesia Pudentiana) have almost fallen into oblivion.    I shall select from each of the six classes such specimens as I  believe will convey an impression of its type to the mind of the  reader.      I. PRIVATE ORATORIES. \"In the familiar record of the first days of the  Christian church we read how the men of Galilee, who returned to  Jerusalem after the ascension, 'went up into the upper chamber,' which  was at once their dwelling-place and their house of prayer and of  assembly. There, at the first common meal, the bread was broken and  the cup passed around in remembrance of the last occasion on which  they had"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22163"],[0,"The Rover Boys on the Farm; or, Last Days at Putnam Hall (#20)"],[1," and rolled up a big ball in the  shape of an egg and then dug out the middle with a shovel. In the  meantime a message was sent to the general utility man that he was  wanted at the top of the hill at once.    \"Must want me to mend a sled,\" he mused, and hurried off, taking with  him some tools, nails and cord. He often did favors for the cadets, who  gave him \"tips\" in return.    When Peleg Snuggers arrived at the top of the hill the big snowball was  ready for use.    \"Here is Peleg!\" cried Tom. \"He can do the trick for us. Can't you,  Peleg?\"    \"What is that, Tom?\" asked the general utility man, innocently.    \"We want to fasten this cord in the hole through that big snowball, but  we don't want to get it crossed,\" went on Tom, anxiously. \"Will you take  the cord, crawl in there and then pass the end out and over the end of  this shovel, and then loop it over to the other end?\"    \"Why--er--I don't understand,\" stammered Peleg Snuggers.    \"I'll explain after you are inside the ball,\" said Tom. \"Here's the  cord,\" and he led the general utility man to the hole and helped him to  get down.    Not suspecting a trick, Snuggers crawled into the big snowball. Before  he could do anything with the cord given to him the cadets rushed  forward and gave the snowball a push toward the edge of the hill.    \"Hi! stop that!\" roared the general utility man, trying to back out.    \"Hold tight--the snowball is getting away from us!\" yelled Tom.  \"Somebody keep it from going down the hill!\"    \"We can't hold it back!\" screamed Larry, grinning at the same time.    \"It's bound to go--too bad!\" wailed another.    \"Say, let me git out!\" yelled Peleg Snuggers, but at that moment the  snowball began to turn over. \"I'll be killed! Oh, dear, I think you did  this a-purpose, you rascals!\"    \"Never!\" came back promptly.    \"Enjoy the ride while you have the chance, Peleg!\"    \"You've got a free ticket to the bottom of the hill!\"    \"Let me out! Stop her!\" yelled Snuggers, and they saw his feet at one  end of the big snowball and his hands at the other. \"I can't stand  rollin', nohow!\"    \"You're not standing,\" called Sam. \"You are just rolling.\"    Away went the big snowball, down the long hill, and the cadets after it.  As it progressed it grew larger and larger. They saw Peleg Snuggers  shove out his head from one end, and the head went around and around  like a top.    \"I guess he'll be rather dizzy when the trip's ended,\" observed  Songbird.    At last the snowball came to a stop in a stretch of meadow land. The  students rushed up just in time to see Peleg Snuggers crawl out on his  hands and knees. When he arose he staggered around as if intoxicated.    \"Say, you young villains!\" he gasped, and then had to stop to catch his  breath.    \"Oh, Peleg, why did you run away with our snowball?\" asked Tom,  innocently.    \"It was a mean thing to do,\" put in Dick.    \"We wanted some fun with that ball,\" added Sam.    \"I--run--off--with the--the snowball?\" gasped the general utility man.  \"I want you to know----\"    \"Oh, we know all about it,\" interrupted Tom. \"I know what's the matter.  You've been drinking, and didn't know what you were doing.\"    \"Perhaps we had better report this to Captain Putnam,\" said Larry.  \"Drinking isn't allowed around here, you know.\"    \"I hain't drunk a drop--it's the rollin' as made me dizzy,\" roared Peleg  Snuggers. \"Oh, dear, I can't stand straight,\" and he bumped up against  the big snowball and sat down in a heap.    \"I'll tell you what I think you ought to do,\" proceeded Tom, calmly. \"I  think you ought to roll our snowball back up the hill for us.\"    \"Roll it back?\" snorted Snuggers. \"Why, four hosses couldn't pull that  weight o' snow up the hill! I ain't going to tech the snowball.\"    \"Then at least pay us for the ride you've had,\" suggested Sam.    \"I ain't goin' to do that nuther! It's a trick that's what it is!\"  growled the general utility man, and arose unsteadily. \"I'll be sick for  a week after this, I know I will!\"    \"Never mind,\" said Dick, soothingly. \"Just get Mrs. Green to give you a  dose of pink Whirl Around Pills, and you'll be all right again.\"    \"I shan't never come out to this hill again, not fer nobody,\" grumbled  the general utility man, and walked off. Then he turned to gaze at the  cadets. \"You do anything like that again an' I'll tell Captain Putnam on  ye, see if I don't. I ain't going to be no merry-go-'round, or spinnin'  top fer nobody!\" And then he hurried for the stables and disappeared.          CHAPTER XXIII    HOLIDAYS AT THE FARM      Almost before they knew it, the mid-winter holidays were at hand, and  the Rover boys went home to enjoy Christmas and New Year. On their way  they stopped at several stores in Ithaca, where they purchased a number  of Christmas presents. Some of these they mailed at the post-office.  Dick sent a nice book to Dora, and Tom and Sam sent books to Grace and  Nellie. The boys also united in the gift of a stick pin to Mrs. Stanhope  and another to Mrs. Laning, and sent Mr. Laning a necktie. Captain  Putnam was not forgotten, and they likewise remembered George Strong.  The rest of their purchases they took home, for distribution there.    A number of the other students had come as far as Ithaca with them, and  here the crowd had dinner at one of the hotels,--the same place where  Tom had once played his great joke on Josiah Crabtree.    \"By the way, who knows anything about Nick Pell?\" asked one of the  students, while dining.    \"He has been removed to his home in the city,\" answered George Granbury.    \"Is he better?\" questioned Dick.    \"They say he is better some days, but at other times he is worse. The  poison somehow affected his mind.\"    \"What a terrible thing to happen,\" murmured the eldest Rover, and then  shuddered to think what might have ensued had the snake bitten him.    \"Any news of Tad Sobber?\" asked another cadet. He looked at each of the  others, but all shook their heads.    \"It's queer where he went to,\" said Songbird. \"Wonder if Captain Putnam  tried to communicate with his folks?\"    \"He has only an uncle, and the captain couldn't find him,\" answered  another youth who was present.    As the dinner progressed the boys warmed up, and at the conclusion they  sang several songs. Then the Rovers had to rush for their train and they  caught it just as it was pulling out of the station.    \"Hullo!\" cried Sam, as he dropped into a seat, and he pointed out of the  car window.    \"What's up now?\" queried Tom.    \"I saw a fellow on the depot platform who looked like Tad Sobber!\"    \"Are you sure it was Sobber?\" demanded Dick.    \"No, I am not dead certain--but the fellow looked a good deal like Tad.\"    \"Must have been a mistake,\" was Tom's comment. \"What would he be doing  around Ithaca?\"    \"Well, he's got to stay somewhere, Tom.\"    \"But he wouldn't stay so close to Cedarville--he'd probably go to some  big city,\" put in Dick.    As the train rushed on the Rover boys talked the matter over, but could  make nothing out of it.    \"I suppose he is in hiding waiting to see if Nick Pell will recover,\"  said Dick. \"He knows that if Nick doesn't get over his trouble he'll be  liable to prosecution.\"    At the station at Oak Run the boys found their father awaiting them with  the big family sleigh. All piled in, and over the crisp snow they  started for Valley Brook farm.    \"I need not ask how you are feeling,\" said Anderson Rover. \"Every one of  you looks the picture of health.\"    \"I never felt better in my life,\" declared Dick, and Tom and Sam said  the same.    \"Has Uncle Randolph heard anything more of his traction company bonds?\"  asked Tom, as they drove along.    \"Not a word more,\" answered his father. \"It is a great loss to him.\"    \"Do you suppose the game was tried on anybody else?\" asked Sam.    \"We have not heard of it.\"    Arriving at home, the boys were warmly greeted by their uncle and their  aunt and also by the others around the house. Their aunt had a hot  supper awaiting them, and while they ate this the whole subject of the  missing bonds was thoroughly discussed. The boys learned that a private  detective was still on the trail of Merrick and Pike, but so far had  reported nothing of importance.    \"I believe those rascals,--or at least Merrick--must belong around Lake  Cayuga,\" observed Dick. \"Otherwise we shouldn't have seen Merrick in  Ithaca and up at the Stanhope place.\"    \"I was very simple to let them get the best of me. The next time I shall  be more careful,\" said Randolph Rover.    The boys learned from Jack Ness that hunting in the woods back of the  farm was good, and two days before Christmas they went out with the  hired man. They went for rabbits and squirrels, and each took his  shotgun along and a substantial lunch, for they expected to be out the  greater part of the day.    It was clear, cold weather, the sun glistening brightly on the snow.  They journeyed directly for a portion of the woods they knew was a  favorite spot for rabbits, and it was not long before they started up  several.    \"There they go!\" cried Dick, and took aim. Bang! bang! went his gun, and  the reports of Tom's firearm followed. Three rabbits came down, and a  few minutes later Sam brought another one low.    \"Four for a starter are not so bad,\" remarked Tom, as the game was  placed in their bags. \"Even if we don't get any more we won't have to go  home empty-handed.\"    By noon they had made their way directly through the woods and had  eleven rabbits and three squirrels to their credit. Then Tom suggested  they build a campfire and rest while eating their lunch and this was  done.    \"I wish we could bring down a fox or two,\" said Jack Ness. \"They have  been bothering the chickens again lately--carried off two only night  before last.\"    \"Do you know where they hang out?\" asked Dick.    \"I think they come from over yonder,\" and the hired man pointed with his  hand to the northward.    \"Let us travel"]]]
