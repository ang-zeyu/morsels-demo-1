The most important  ingredient, after the clay-substance and the sand, is oxide of iron; for  the colour, and, to a less extent, the hardness and durability of the burnt  bricks depend on its presence. The amount of oxide of iron in these clays  varies from about 2 to 10%, and the colour of the bricks varies accordingly  from light buff to chocolate; although the colour developed by a given  percentage of oxide of iron is influenced by the other substances present  and also by the method of firing. A clay containing from 5 to 8% of oxide  of iron will, under ordinary conditions of firing, produce a red brick; but  if the clay contains 3 to 4% of alkalis, or the brick is fired too hard,  the colour will be darker and more purple. The actions of the alkalis and  of increased temperature are probably closely related, for in either case  the clay is brought nearer to its fusion point, and ferruginous clays  generally become darker in colour as they approach to fusion. Alumina acts  in the opposite direction, an excess of this compound tending to make the  colour lighter and brighter. It is impossible to give a typical composition  for such clays, as the percentages of the different constituents vary  through such wide ranges. The clay substance may vary from 15 to 80%, the  free silica or sand from 5 to 80%, the oxide of iron from 1 to 10%, the  carbonates of lime and magnesia together, from 1 to 5%, and the alkalis  from 1 to 4%. Organic matter is always present, and other impurities which  frequently occur are the sulphates of lime and magnesia, the chlorides and  nitrates of soda and potash, and iron-pyrites. The presence of organic  matter gives the wet clay a greater plasticity, probably because it forms a  kind of mucilage which adds a certain viscosity and adhesiveness to the  natural plasticity of the clay. In some of the coal-measure shales the  amount of organic matter is very considerable, and may render the clay  useless for brickmaking. The other impurities, all of which, except the  pyrites, are soluble in water, are undesirable, as they give rise to  \"scum,\" which produces patchy colour and pitted faces on the bricks. The  commonest soluble impurity is calcium sulphate, which produces a whitish  scum on the face of the brick in drying, and as the scum becomes  permanently fixed in burning, such bricks are of little use except for  common work. This question of \"scumming\" is very important to the maker of  high-class facing and moulded bricks, and where a clay containing calcium  sulphate must be used, a certain percentage of barium carbonate is nowadays  added to the wet clay. By this means the calcium sulphate is converted into  calcium carbonate which is insoluble in water, so that it remains  distributed throughout the mass of the brick instead of being deposited on  the surface. The presence of magnesium salts is also very objectionable, as  these generally remain in the burnt brick as magnesium sulphate, which  gives rise to an efflorescence of fine white crystals after the bricks are  built into position. Clays which are strong or plastic are known as \"fat\"  clays, and they always contain a high percentage of true \"clay substance,\"  and, consequently, a low percentage of sand. Such clays take up a  considerable amount of water in \"tempering\"; they dry slowly, shrink  greatly, and so become liable to lose their shape and develop cracks in  drying and firing. \"Fat\" clays are greatly improved by the addition of  coarse sharp sand, [v.04 p.0519] which reduces the time of drying and the  shrinkage, and makes the brick more rigid during the firing. Coarse sand,  unlike clay-substance, is practically unaffected during the drying and  firing, and is a desirable if not a necessary ingredient of all brick  clays. The best brick-clays feel gritty between the fingers; they should,  of course, be free from pebbles, sufficiently plastic to be moulded into  shape and strong enough when dry to be safely handled. All clays are  greatly improved by being turned over and exposed to the weather, or by  standing for some months in a wet condition. This \"weathering\" and \"ageing\"  of clay is particularly important where bricks are made from tempered clay,  _i.e._ clay in the wet or plastic state; where bricks are made from shale,  in the semi-plastic condition, weathering is still of importance.    The lime clays or \"marls\" of class (2), which contain essentially a high  percentage of chalk or limestone, are not so widely distributed as the  ordinary brick-clays, and in England the natural deposits of these clays  have been largely exhausted. A very fine chalk-clay, or \"malm\" as it was  locally called, was formerly obtained from the alluvium in the vicinity of  London; but the available supply of this has been used up, and at the  present time an artificial \"malm\" is prepared by mixing an ordinary  brick-clay with ground chalk. For the best London facing-bricks the clay  and chalk are mixed in water. The chalk is ground on grinding-pans, and the  clay is mixed with water and worked about until the mixture has the  consistence of cream. The mixture of these \"pulps\" is run through a grating  or coarse sieve on to a drying-kiln or \"bed,\" where it is allowed to stand  until stiff enough to walk on. A layer of fine ashes is then spread over  the clay, and the mass is turned over and mixed by spade, and tempered by  the addition of water. In other districts, where clays containing limestone  are used, the marl is mixed with water on a wash-pan and the resulting  creamy fluid passed through coarse sieves on to a drying-bed. If necessary,  coarse sand is added to the clay in the wash-pan, and such addition is  often advisable because the washed clays are generally very fine in grain.  Another method of treating these marls, when they are in the plastic  condition, is to squeeze them by machinery through iron gratings, which  arrest and remove the pebbles. In other cases the marl is passed through a  grinding-mill having a solid bottom and heavy iron rollers, by which means  the limestone pebbles are crushed sufficiently and mixed through the whole  mass. The removal of limestone pebbles from the clay is of great  importance, as during the firing they would be converted into quicklime,  which has a tendency to shatter the brick on exposure to the weather. As  before stated, these marls (which usually contain from 15 to 30% of calcium  carbonate) burn to a yellow colour which is quite distinctive, although in  some cases, where the percentage of limestone is very high, over 40%, the  colour is grey or a very pale buff. The action of lime in bleaching the  ferric oxide and producing a yellow instead of a red brick, has not been  thoroughly investigated, but it seems probable that some compound is  produced, between the lime and the oxide of iron, or between these two  oxides and the free silica, entirely different from that produced by oxide  of iron in the absence of lime. Such marls require a harder fire than the  ordinary brick-clays in order to bring about the reaction between the lime  and the other ingredients. Magnesia may replace lime to some extent in such  marls, but the firing temperature must be higher when magnesia is present.  Marls usually contract very little, if at all, in the burning, and  generally produce a strong, square brick of fine texture and good colour.  When under-fired, marl bricks are very liable to disintegrate under the  action of the weather, and great care must be exercised in burning them at  a sufficiently high temperature.    _Brickmaking_.--Bricks made of tempered clay may be made by hand or by  machine, and the machines may be worked by hand or by mechanical power.  Bricks made of semi-plastic clay (_i.e._ ground clay or shale sufficiently  damp to adhere under pressure) are generally machine-made throughout. The  method of making bricks by hand is the same, with slight variation, the  world over. The tempered clay is pressed by hand into a wooden or metal  mould or four-sided case (without top or bottom) which is of the desired  shape and size, allowance being made for the shrinkage of the brick in  drying and firing. The moulder stands at the bench or table, dips the mould  in water, or water and then sand, to prevent the clay from sticking, takes  a rudely shaped piece of clay from an assistant, and dashes this into the  mould which rests on the moulding bench. He then presses the clay into the  corners of the mould with his fingers, scrapes off any surplus clay and  levels the top by means of a strip of wood called a \"strike,\" and then  turns the brick out of the mould on to a board, to be carried away by  another assistant to the drying-ground. The mould may be placed on a  special piece of wood, called the stock-board, provided with an elevated  tongue of wood in the centre, which produces the hollow or \"frog\" in the  bottom of the brick.    Machine-made bricks may be divided into two kinds, plastic and  semi-plastic, although the same type of machine is often used for both  kinds.    The machine-made plastic bricks are made of tempered clay, but generally  the tempering and working of the clay are effected by the use of machinery,  especially when the harder clays and shales are used. The machines used in  the preparation of such clays are grinding-mills and pug-mills. The  grinding-mills are either a series of rollers with graduated spaces  between, through which the clay or shale is passed, or are of the ordinary  \"mortar pan\" type, having a solid or perforated iron bottom on which the  clay or shale is crushed by heavy rollers. Shales are sometimes passed  through a grinding-mill before they are exposed to the action of the  weather, as the disintegration of the hard lumps of shale greatly  accelerates the \"weathering.\" In the case of ordinary brick-clay, in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19706"],[0,"Brood of the Witch-Queen (#20)"],[1,"within me was called up, and braving the laws of God  and man, I was about to slay that thing. Thank God!--\"    He dropped upon his knees, silently bowed his head for a moment, and  then stood up, self-possessed again, as his son had always known him.  It had been a strange and awful awakening for Robert Cairn--to find  his room illuminated by a lurid light, and to find his own father  standing over him with a knife! But what had moved him even more  deeply than the fear of these things, had been the sight of the  emotion which had shaken that stern and unemotional man. Now, as he  gathered together his scattered wits, he began to perceive that a  malignant hand was moving above them, that his father, and himself,  were pawns, which had been moved mysteriously to a dreadful end.    A great disturbance had now arisen in the streets below, streams of  people it seemed, were pouring towards the harbour; but Dr. Cairn  pointed to an armchair.    \"Sit down, Rob,\" he said. \"I will tell my story, and you shall tell  yours. By comparing notes, we can arrive at some conclusion. Then we  must act. This is a fight to a finish, and I begin to doubt if we are  strong enough to win.\"    He took up the dagger and ran a critical glance over it, from the keen  point to the enamelled hilt.    \"This is unique,\" he muttered, whilst his son, spellbound, watched  him; \"the blade is as keen as if tempered but yesterday; yet it was  made full five thousand years ago, as the workmanship of the hilt  testifies. Rob, we deal with powers more than human! We have to cope  with a force which might have awed the greatest Masters which the  world has known. It would have called for all the knowledge, and all  the power of Apollonius of Tyana to have dealt with--_him_!\"    \"Antony Ferrara!\"    \"Undoubtedly, Rob! it was by the agency of Antony Ferrara that the  wireless message was sent to you from the P. and O. It was by the  agency of Antony Ferrara that I dreamt a dream to-night. In fact it  was no true dream; I was under the influence of--what shall I term  it?--hypnotic suggestion. To what extent that malign will was  responsible for you and I being placed in rooms communicating by means  of a balcony, we probably shall never know; but if this proximity was  merely accidental, the enemy did not fail to take advantage of the  coincidence. I lay watching the stars before I slept, and one of them  seemed to grow larger as I watched.\" He began to pace about the room  in growing excitement. \"Rob, I cannot doubt that a mirror, or a  crystal, was actually suspended before my eyes by--someone, who had  been watching for the opportunity. I yielded myself to the soothing  influence, and thus deliberately--deliberately--placed myself in the  power of--Antony Ferrara--\"    \"You think that he is here, in this hotel?\"    \"I cannot doubt that he is in the neighbourhood. The influence was too  strong to have emanated from a mind at a great distance removed. I  will tell you exactly what I dreamt.\"    He dropped into a cane armchair. Comparative quiet reigned again in  the streets below, but a distant clamour told of some untoward  happening at the harbour.    Dawn would break ere long, and there was a curious rawness in the  atmosphere. Robert Cairn seated himself upon the side of the bed, and  watched his father, whilst the latter related those happenings with  which we are already acquainted.    \"You think, sir,\" said Robert, at the conclusion of the strange story,  \"that no part of your experience was real?\"    Dr. Cairn held up the antique dagger, glancing at the speaker  significantly.    \"On the contrary,\" he replied, \"I _do_ know that part of it was  dreadfully real. My difficulty is to separate the real from the  phantasmal.\"    Silence fell for a moment. Then:    \"It is almost certain,\" said the younger man, frowning thoughtfully,  \"that you did not actually leave the hotel, but merely passed from  your room to mine by way of the balcony.\"    Dr. Cairn stood up, walked to the open window, and looked out, then  turned and faced his son again.    \"I believe I can put that matter to the test,\" he declared. \"In my  dream, as I turned into the lane where the house was--the house of the  mummy--there was a patch covered with deep mud, where at some time  during the evening a quantity of water had been spilt. I stepped upon  that patch, or dreamt that I did. We can settle the point.\"    He sat down on the bed beside his son, and, stooping, pulled off one  of his slippers. The night had been full enough of dreadful surprises;  but here was yet another, which came to them as Dr. Cairn, with the  inverted slipper in his hand, sat looking into his son's eyes.    The sole of the slipper was caked with reddish brown mud.          CHAPTER XVI    LAIR OF THE SPIDERS      \"We must find that house, find the sarcophagus--for I no longer doubt  that it exists--drag it out, and destroy it.\"    \"Should you know it again, sir?\"    \"Beyond any possibility of doubt. It is the sarcophagus of a queen.\"    \"What queen?\"    \"A queen whose tomb the late Sir Michael Ferrara and I sought for many  months, but failed to find.\"    \"Is this queen well known in Egyptian history?\"    Dr. Cairn stared at him with an odd expression in his eyes.    \"Some histories ignore her existence entirely,\" he said; and, with an  evident desire to change the subject, added, \"I shall return to my  room to dress now. Do you dress also. We cannot afford to sleep whilst  the situation of that house remains unknown to us.\"    Robert Cairn nodded, and his father stood up, and went out of the  room.    Dawn saw the two of them peering from the balcony upon the streets of  Port Said, already dotted with moving figures, for the Egyptian is an  early riser.    \"Have you any clue,\" asked the younger man, \"to the direction in which  this place lies?\"    \"Absolutely none, for the reason that I do not know where my dreaming  left off, and reality commenced. Did someone really come to my window,  and lead me out through another room, downstairs, and into the street,  or did I wander out of my own accord and merely imagine the existence  of the guide? In either event, I must have been guided in some way to  a back entrance; for had I attempted to leave by the front door of the  hotel in that trance-like condition, I should certainly have been  detained by the _bowwab_. Suppose we commence, then, by inquiring if  there is such another entrance?\"    The hotel staff was already afoot, and their inquiries led to the  discovery of an entrance communicating with the native servants'  quarters. This could not be reached from the main hall, but there was  a narrow staircase to the left of the lift-shaft by which it might be  gained. The two stood looking out across the stone-paved courtyard  upon which the door opened.    \"Beyond doubt,\" said Dr. Cairn, \"I might have come down that staircase  and out by this door without arousing a soul, either by passing  through my own room, or through any other on that floor.\"    They crossed the yard, where members of the kitchen staff were busily  polishing various cooking utensils, and opened the gate. Dr. Cairn  turned to one of the men near by.    \"Is this gate bolted at night?\" he asked, in Arabic.    The man shook his head, and seemed to be much amused by the question,  revealing his white teeth as he assured him that it was not.    A narrow lane ran along behind the hotel, communicating with a maze of  streets almost exclusively peopled by natives.    \"Rob,\" said Dr. Cairn slowly, \"it begins to dawn upon me that this is  the way I came.\"    He stood looking to right and left, and seemed to be undecided. Then:    \"We will try right,\" he determined.    They set off along the narrow way. Once clear of the hotel wall, high  buildings rose upon either side, so that at no time during the day  could the sun have penetrated to the winding lane. Suddenly Robert  Cairn stopped.    \"Look!\" he said, and pointed. \"The mosque! You spoke of a mosque near  to the house?\"    Dr. Cairn nodded; his eyes were gleaming, now that he felt himself to  be upon the track of this great evil which had shattered his peace.    They advanced until they stood before the door of the mosque--and  there in the shadow of a low archway was just such an ancient,  iron-studded door as Dr. Cairn remembered! Latticed windows overhung  the street above, but no living creature was in sight.    He very gently pressed upon the door, but as he had anticipated it was  fastened from within. In the vague light, his face seemed strangely  haggard as he turned to his son, raising his eyebrows interrogatively.    \"It is just possible that I may be mistaken,\" he said; \"so that I  scarcely know what to do.\"    He stood looking about him in some perplexity.    Adjoining the mosque, was a ruinous house, which clearly had had no  occupants for many years. As Robert Cairn's gaze lighted upon its  gaping window-frames and doorless porch, he seized his father by the  arm.    \"We might hide up there,\" he suggested, \"and watch for anyone entering  or leaving the place opposite.\"    \"I have little doubt that this was the scene of my experience,\"  replied Dr. Cairn; \"therefore I think we will adopt your plan. Perhaps  there is some means of egress at the back. It will be useful if we  have to remain on the watch for any considerable time.\"    They entered the ruined building and, by means of a rickety staircase,  gained the floor above. It moved beneath them unsafely, but from the  divan which occupied one end of the apartment an uninterrupted view of  the door below was obtainable.    \"Stay here,\" said Dr. Cairn, \"and watch, whilst I reconnoitre.\"    He descended the stairs again, to return in a minute or so and  announce that another street could be reached through the back of the  house. There and then they settled the plan of campaign. One at a time  they would go to the hotel for their meals, so that the door would  never"]]]
