The Universal House of Justice      The Universal House of Justice is elected by the members of the National  Houses of Justice. At this time when the National Assemblies in the Cause  are not yet functioning sufficiently or fully representative of all the  various important elements within it, and when some of the Baha'is are not  even free to practise their faith, despite their numbers, it is quite  impracticable to seek to establish the Universal House of Justice.  Whenever conditions permit, it will be established.          Surmount Every Obstacle      The Guardian wishes the members of your Assembly to persevere, in spite of  the dangers of the war now raging near to India, in the all-important task  of fulfilling the Six-Year Plan.    He is confident that the friends of India and Burma like their Baha'i  brothers and sisters of other lands, will surmount every obstacle,  overcome every difficulty, and emerge victorious at the end of the first  Baha'i Century.    [From the Guardian:]    The news conveyed by your latest communication has rejoiced my heart. The  manner in which the friends have arisen to promote the teaching work  throughout their country merits the highest praise. By their enthusiasm,  their self-abnegation, the determination and vigour they display, they  have lent a fresh impetus to the onward march of the Faith and the  expansion of its institutions and the multiplication of its administrative  centres. The perils of the present hour, the repercussions of this  tremendous world ordeal on their native land, must, in no wise, alarm or  discourage them. Their purpose must never be deflected, their enthusiasm  never dimmed, their vision never obscured, their exertions never  discontinued. Adversity prepares the hearts of men, and paves the way for  a wholehearted and general acceptance of the tenets and claims of our  beloved Faith. Challenged by the obstacles in their path, encouraged by  work already initiated, assured of the Divine Promise of Baha'u'llah, let  them forge ahead until their goal is attained. My prayers will ever  surround them.    December 27, 1941          Remarkable Evidence of Activity      He has been greatly encouraged by the work the Indian believers are doing  in the pioneer teaching field. It makes him proud to behold the way this  great eastern nation is arising, through its enlightened Baha'is, to serve  the Cause of God, and is fast pushing to the forefront of Baha'i service,  and becoming an example and an inspiration to the other Baha'i communities  in the Orient and Far East.    The noble response the Indian friends are making to his appeals has  encouraged him to send them further donations for their teaching work, and  he trusts that, under the indefatigable leadership of the National  Spiritual Assembly, they will redouble their efforts, and push on to the  full and glorious completion of the Six-Year Plan they laid down for  themselves with such courage and devotion.    The establishment of the Hyderabad Assembly and that of Bangalore are  great steps forward, and the Guardian is waiting hopefully to receive the  good news of more new spiritual Assemblies in this coming Baha'i year.    He was also very pleased to hear that the Summer School is becoming an  institution of national importance, and that the friends are increasingly  attending it and realizing its great value in the life of the entire  Community of believers. In a country such as India it might grow to be the  first permanent institution of Baha'i learning if the believers support it  sufficiently and carry out their teaching campaign with whole-hearted  devotion and zeal; for, with the influx of many new Baha'is into the Cause  in that country, it should not be difficult to evolve it into a Baha'i  university as time goes by.    The Guardian wishes to convey, through you, his loving appreciation of  their noble services to all the dear Indian believers who have gone out as  pioneers and teachers in these momentous days. He will remember them, and  all the Indian friends, in his prayers in the Holy Shrines, and supplicate  for them a victorious conclusion for their Six-Year Plan by 1944.    [From the Guardian:]    I have been greatly heartened in my arduous task by the remarkable  evidences of activity, devotion and perseverance which the believers in  India have lately manifested, and by the manner in which they have arisen  to promote the cause of our Beloved, and extend the range of its  institutions. I admire, their spirit, and feel truly proud of their  achievements. The field is indeed vast, and the problems manifold, but the  spirit they have demonstrated will, if kept alive, enable them to surmount  every obstacle. My prayers will continue to be offered on their behalf and  particularly for those who are planting the banner of the Faith in virgin  territories. How glorious their task, how meritorious their  accomplishments.    January 10, 1942          Future is Blessed and Glorious      He was very relieved to hear from Mr. Butt that the Burmese Baha'is were  all safe, and he trusts that, in spite of the grave dangers now so near  them, God will continue to over-shadow them and protect them in His mercy  and wisdom.    We Baha'is are indeed most blessed in that we know that, however dark the  days immediately ahead of the human race, the future is blessed and  glorious. It is for this future that the believers must labour day and  night, heedless of the state of the world and the dangers threatening.    The Guardian will continuously pray that Baha'u'llah will strengthen and  guide the Indian friends to succeed in their teaching plans, and to  persevere in their efforts until they have completed the Six-Year Plan.    [From the Guardian:]    In these days when perils are fast gathering about India and Burma my  heart and my thoughts turn increasingly towards the friends, and  particularly those who are vigorously and devotedly promoting the  interests of the Six-Year Plan. I will specially and fervently pray for  them all, that their vision may not be obscured, that their efforts may  not diminish, that their courage many remain undaunted, and their  steadfastness and loyalty unshaken. The greater their problems and  anxieties and the more formidable the obstacles in their way, the more  glorious and abundant will be the recompense and blessings that will be  bestowed upon them by their all-seeing, their all-bountiful, all-powerful  Master.    February 23, 1942          New Assemblies of Hyderabad & Kotah      The Guardian has written the new Hyderabad Assembly, and he will indeed  pray for their protection and blessing. They are an important group in an  important State, and he hopes that your Assembly will render them every  assistance and help possible, in order to deepen them in the knowledge of  the teachings and in Faith.    The establishment of the Assembly of Kotah, no less than that of  Hyderabad, must be viewed in the light of another milestone in the forward  march of the Faith in India. The Guardian would like you to convey to all  the dear pioneers and teachers whom you have enumerated in your letters,  the expression of his deep gratitude for, and appreciation of the  wonderful work they are doing. The believers of India, though few in  number in relation to the millions that form their nation, are performing  a service to their fellow-countrymen which in the future will be seen in  the true magnitude. Let them rest assured and toil ceaselessly for the  establishment of the Faith which they serve, and which alone can  ultimately heal the ills of sorely-tried mankind.    [From the Guardian:]    The pioneer activities in which the friends in India are so steadfastly,  so energetically and so devotedly engaged, in spite of the perils, the  uncertainties and the stress of the present hour, are a marvellous  evidence of the indomitable spirit that animates them in the service of  the Cause of Baha'u'llah. Perseverance is the magnet that will, in these  days, attract the promised blessings of the Almighty Author of our beloved  Faith. Unity and harmony constitute the basis on which the structure of  these activities can securely rest. Self-sacrifice, audacity, undeviating  adherence to the essentials of the Faith, will reinforce that structure  and accelerate its rise. That the dear friends in India are increasingly  demonstrating the quality and depth of their faith and the character and  range of their accomplishments is a source of intense satisfaction to me,  and I will continue to supplicate our Beloved to guide their steps, cheer  their hearts, illumine their understanding, and fulfil their highest and  noblest aspirations. He indeed is well pleased with the record of their  past services, and will, if they redouble their efforts, enable them to  achieve a signal victory.    June 27, 1942          Prizes to be Won      ...The extremely good news of the way the Baha'is of India are arising and  serving in new fields in spite of the war conditions prevailing, and the  formation of the new Assemblies of Hyderabad and Kotah, the work in  Kashmir and various other centres, has all greatly cheered his heart, and  impelled him to contribute the sum he forwarded through you to help carry  out the many teaching enterprises now under way. The rate at which the  Indian believers are advancing is increasingly entitling them to a  position in the foremost ranks of the Faith, and will no doubt greatly  inspire and encourage other Baha'is of the East to follow their example.  Such prizes are to be won in these days of universal trial and suffering,  and it makes the Guardian very happy to feel that some of them are  evidently going to be merited by the Indian believers!

Your true and grateful brother,  Shoghi.            LETTER OF JAN. 21, -51      Haifa, Israel,  Jan. 21, -51    National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of Australia and New Zealand;    The beloved Guardian has instructed me to acknowledge on his behalf the  Nov. issue of your Baha'i News. He is well pleased with it and commends  you.    He would like to call your attention to the statement on page 3, paragraph  3, under \"Anniversaries and Festivals\", and clarify it.    The Day of the Covenant Nov. 26th, and the Day of the Ascension, Nov.  28th, anniversaries of the birth and the Ascension of 'Abdu'l-Baha must be  observed by the friends coming together, but work is not prohibited. In  other words the friends must regard observance of these two anniversaries  as obligatory--but suspension of work not to be regarded as obligatory.    He assures you of his deep interest in all your efforts and offers prayers  on your behalf at the Holy Shrines.    With warmest love,    Sincerely yours,  Amelia Collins.            LETTER OF MARCH 1, 1951      Haifa, Israel,  March 1, 1951    National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of Australia and New Zealand    C/- Mrs. Mariette G. Bolton, Secretary    Dear Baha'i Friends:    Your letters addressed to our beloved Guardian, and dated June 22, August  4 and 22, November 10 and December 5 and 11, of 1950 and January 30 and  Feb. 20, 22, 26, of 1951, together with their enclosures, have been  received; and he has instructed me to answer you on his behalf.    In regard to the various matters raised in your letters:    It is indeed a great tragedy that ... should have such an utterly  despicable character, and the ability to be a teacher. He has undoubtedly  dealt with the greatest injustice with the friends in Fiji who wrote to  Mr. Blum; and the Guardian was extremely sorry to hear that this man,  attracted to the Faith of Baha'u'llah, and evidently a sincere and decent  person, should have been duped by the very man who gave him this glorious  Message. It was very wise to send Mr. Blum out there; and he hopes that  your Assembly will keep in close contact with the friends who were  attracted, it would seem almost miraculously under the circumstances, to  the Cause of Baha'u'llah in those distant islands.    It might interest your Assembly to know that since leaving Fiji, ... went  to the United States, and himself admitted in a letter to the Guardian  that he had seen Ahmad Sohrab.    The Guardian assures your Assembly, and, through you, all the believers  throughout Australasia, that he has been deeply touched by the spirit of  loyalty which you have all shown at this difficult time for him, and also  the devotion to every work which is undertaken here at the International  Center of the Faith.    The support you have given to the construction of the Shrine of the Bab  has been deeply appreciated; and he hopes that in the not distant future  it will be possible for the doors of pilgrimage to be opened once more;  and then the believers can see with their own eyes what their sacrificial  contributions have helped to erect, on Mount Carmel. It will interest the  friends to hear that we are at present busy with the preliminary work  required prior to the erection of the second story of the Holy Tomb, in  other words, the octagonal portion, which will be built on top of the roof  of the original Shrine building erected by 'Abdu'l-Baha Himself. The  stones have been ordered from Italy for this next stage in our  undertaking, and soon will be coming to Haifa another 300 tons of granite,  some of it with beautiful carved ornamentation.    The Guardian would like you to please convey to the Adelaide Spiritual  Assembly his deep appreciation of the contribution they made through your  Body to the Shrine Fund here in Haifa, a contribution which represents the  sum of their Property Fund. They showed in this matter an exemplary  spirit, and placed the major issue in its true perspective, forgetting  their local hopes and aspirations in order that the work on the glorious  Shrine of the Bab might be carried forward more speedily.    In regard to your question concerning the Centenary of the birth of  Baha'u'llah's mission: The Guardian, at a later date, will give  instructions concerning this commemoration to the entire Baha'i world.    He has been particularly pleased to note, during the past year, the  increase in pioneer activity going on under your jurisdiction. As you  know, he attaches the greatest importance to this type of Baha'i service;  and he hopes that more of the believers will arise and go forth into the  field, establishing new centers and groups, and broadcasting the Message  of Baha'u'llah over the face of that vast continent.    This is at once their greatest duty and privilege, and one which will  attract the blessings of Baha'u'llah, and enrich, not only each individual  who arises to serve, but the entire Community of which he forms a part.    Whenever the friends feel that they are small in number, and the effort  required, truly colossal, they should remember what the British Baha'is  accomplished during the Six Year Plan; and how, after the long and  exhaustive years of the war and all its restrictions, they succeeded, at  the point of utter exhaustion, one might say, in achieving every single  goal gloriously. The Australian and New Zealand friends, who have not been  subjected to such rigors during the last decade, who are a young and fresh  nation, so to speak, can surely accomplish as much, and one would imagine  more, than their British brethren, who labored under such great handicaps.    He assures you all that he will remember you in his prayers at the Holy  Threshold, and supplicate that your Assembly, and the Community of  believers whom you represent, may achieve great things during the coming  Baha'i year and arise to new heights of self-sacrifice and service.    With warm Baha'i love,  R. Rabbani.    P.S. I would like to add that the Guardian does not consider that it is  advisable for New Zealand to be separated in the near future from  Australia, and come under the jurisdiction of an independent National  Assembly. He considers that the present arrangement is the best one until  such time as there are more assemblies flourishing in New Zealand, and he  would consider the basis for a National Assembly strong enough there to  support such an institution.    Regarding the question of Mr. ..., the Guardian was considerably surprised  at his temerity in getting in touch with the Baha'is. He belongs to an old  family of Covenant-breakers from the days of 'Abdu'l-Baha, was later  pardoned by the Guardian, and a number of years ago, flagrantly disobeyed  the Guardian, and was put out of our local Community here. We all know  that he has been in constant association with the Covenant-breakers ever  since, and he even admits it in his own letter! Needless to say, the  Baha'is should consider him a Covenant-breaker, and shun him entirely. The  harm that he could do a Community if treated otherwise, would be very  great indeed.    [From the Guardian:]    Dear and valued co-workers:    The manifold and ever multiplying activities in which the Australian, New  Zealand and Tasmanian Baha'i communities are so devotedly and unitedly  engaged are the object of my constant solicitude, and evoke, as they  steadily expand, feelings of gratitude and admiration in my heart. Though  unavoidably prevented from communicating more frequently with their  elected national representatives, who are directing with exemplary  loyalty, unrelaxing vigilance, inflexible resolve, unsparing devotion and  commendable foresight, the course of these highly meritorious and  promising activities, I follow, through the perusal of the various reports  and news letters I receive from them, every development in the unfoldment  of their work, and surround them as they labour so assiduously for their  Cause, with my fervent prayers, offered on their behalf in the holy  Shrines.    The assistance they have so spontaneously and enthusiastically extended to  the newly established centre in the Fiji Islands, constituting the opening  phase of the crusade destined to be systematically launched by them in the  Pacific Islands--a territory with which their spiritual destiny is  irrevocably linked--has been particularly gratifying and merits unstinted  praise. To have undertaken this additional task, with such determination  and fervour, while immersed in the labours associated with the prosecution  of their Plan, is surely an evidence of their youthful vitality, their  unbounded devotion to the interests of the Faith, and their eager desire  to emulate the example of their sister-communities which have initiated,  over and above their prescribed tasks, enterprises beyond the confines of  their respective homelands.    While this historic undertaking is being carried forward by their elected  national representatives, these communities must concentrate their  attention on the pressing and inescapable requirements of the Plan to  which they stand committed. The process of extending the range of their  administrative activities through the formation of groups and the  multiplication of assemblies must continue unabated until this particular  objective of the Plan is fully achieved. The proper incorporation of the  national and local assemblies, so vital and urgent at the present stage of  their evolution, must be hastened by every means in their power. The  measures required to ensure the recognition of the Faith, of its laws  regarding matters of personal status, as well as its Holy Days, by the  civil authorities, in both Australia and New Zealand, must be carefully  considered, and promptly adopted. The institutions of summer and winter  schools, so vital and beneficial at the present stage"]]]
