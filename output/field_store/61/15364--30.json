[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19282"],[0,"The Promised Day Is Come (#20)"],[1," empires  have almost synchronized with the crumbling of the seemingly inviolable  strongholds of religious orthodoxy. That same process which, swiftly and  tragically, sealed the doom of kings and emperors, and extinguished their  dynasties, has operated in the case of the ecclesiastical leaders of both  Christianity and Islam, damaging their prestige, and, in some cases,  overthrowing their highest institutions. \"Power hath been seized\" indeed  from both \"kings and ecclesiastics.\" The glory of the former has been  eclipsed, the power of the latter irretrievably lost.    Those leaders who exercised guidance and control over the ecclesiastical  hierarchies of their respective religions have, likewise, been appealed  to, warned, and reproved by Baha'u'llah, in terms no less uncertain than  those in which the sovereigns who presided over the destinies of their  subjects have been addressed. They, too, and more particularly the heads  of Muslim ecclesiastical orders, have, in conjunction with despots and  potentates, launched their assaults and thundered their anathemas against  the Founders of the Faith of God, its followers, its principles, and its  institutions. Were not the divines of Persia the first who hoisted the  standard of revolt, who inflamed the ignorant and subservient masses  against it, and who instigated the civil authorities, through their  outcry, their threats, their lies, their calumnies, and denunciations, to  decree the banishments, to enact the laws, to launch the punitive  campaigns, and to carry out the executions and massacres that fill the  pages of its history? So abominable and savage was the butchery committed  in a single day, instigated by these divines, and so typical of the  \"callousness of the brute and the ingenuity of the fiend\" that Renan, in  his \"Les Apotres,\" characterized that day as \"perhaps unparalleled in the  history of the world.\"    It was these divines, who, by these very acts, sowed the seeds of the  disintegration of their own institutions, institutions that were so  potent, so famous, and appeared so invulnerable when the Faith was born.  It was they who, by assuming so lightly and foolishly, such awful  responsibilities were primarily answerable for the release of those  violent and disruptive influences that have unchained disasters as  catastrophic as those which overwhelmed kings, dynasties, and empires, and  which constitute the most noteworthy landmarks in the history of the first  century of the Baha'i era.    This process of deterioration, however startling in its initial  manifestations, is still operating with undiminished force, and will, as  the opposition to the Faith of God, from various sources and in distant  fields, gathers momentum, be further accelerated and reveal still more  remarkable evidences of its devastating power. I cannot, in view of the  proportions which this communication has already assumed, expatiate, as  fully as I would wish, on the aspects of this weighty theme which,  together with the reaction of the sovereigns of the earth to the Message  of Baha'u'llah, is one of the most fascinating and edifying episodes in  the dramatic story of His Faith. I will only consider the repercussions of  the violent assaults made by the ecclesiastical leaders of Islam and, to a  lesser degree, by certain exponents of Christian orthodoxy upon their  respective institutions. I will preface these observations with some  passages gleaned from the great mass of Baha'u'llah's Tablets which, both  directly and indirectly, bear reference to Muslim and Christian divines,  and which throw such a powerful light on the dismal disasters that have  overtaken, and are still overtaking, the ecclesiastical hierarchies of the  two religions with which the Faith has been immediately concerned.    It must not be inferred, however, that Baha'u'llah directed His historic  addresses exclusively to the leaders of Islam and Christianity, or that  the impact of an all-pervading Faith on the strongholds of religious  orthodoxy is to be confined to the institutions of these two religious  systems. \"The time foreordained unto the peoples and kindreds of the  earth,\" affirms Baha'u'llah, \"is now come. The promises of God, as  recorded in the Holy Scriptures, have all been fulfilled.... This is the  Day which the Pen of the Most High hath glorified in all the Holy  Scriptures. There is no verse in them that doth not declare the glory of  His holy Name, and no Book that doth not testify unto the loftiness of  this most exalted theme.\" \"Were We,\" He adds, \"to make mention of all that  hath been revealed in these heavenly Books and Holy Scriptures concerning  this Revelation, this Tablet would assume impossible dimensions.\" As the  promise of the Faith of Baha'u'llah is enshrined in all the Scriptures of  past religions, so does its Author address Himself to their followers, and  particularly to their responsible leaders who have intervened between Him  and their respective congregations. \"At one time,\" writes Baha'u'llah, \"We  address the people of the Torah and summon them unto Him Who is the  Revealer of verses, Who hath come from Him Who layeth low the necks of  men.... At another, We address the people of the Evangel and say: 'The  All-Glorious is come in this Name whereby the Breeze of God hath wafted  over all regions.'... At still another, We address the people of the  Qur'an saying: 'Fear the All-Merciful, and cavil not at Him through Whom  all religions were founded.'... Know thou, moreover, that We have  addressed to the Magians Our Tablets, and adorned them with Our Law.... We  have revealed in them the essence of all the hints and allusions contained  in their Books. The Lord, verily, is the Almighty, the All-Knowing.\"    Addressing the Jewish people Baha'u'llah has written: \"The Most Great Law  is come, and the Ancient Beauty ruleth upon the throne of David. Thus hath  My Pen spoken that which the histories of bygone ages have related. At  this time, however, David crieth aloud and saith: 'O my loving Lord! Do  Thou number me with such as have stood steadfast in Thy Cause, O Thou  through Whom the faces have been illumined, and the footsteps have  slipped!'\" And again: \"The Breath hath been wafted, and the Breeze hath  blown, and from Zion hath appeared that which was hidden, and from  Jerusalem is heard the Voice of God, the One, the Incomparable, the  Omniscient.\" Furthermore, in His \"Epistle to the Son of the Wolf\"  Baha'u'llah has revealed: \"Lend an ear unto the song of David. He saith:  'Who will bring me into the Strong City?' The Strong City is Akka, which  hath been named the Most Great Prison, and which possesseth a fortress and  mighty ramparts. O _Sh_ay_kh_! Peruse that which Isaiah hath spoken in His  Book. He saith: 'Get thee up into the high mountain, O Zion, that bringest  good tidings; lift up thy voice with strength, O Jerusalem, that bringest  good tidings. Lift it up, be not afraid; say unto the cities of Judah:  \"Behold your God! Behold the Lord God will come with strong hand, and His  arm shall rule for Him.\"' This Day all the signs have appeared. A Great  City hath descended from heaven, and Zion trembleth and exulteth with joy  at the Revelation of God, for it hath heard the Voice of God on every  side.\"    To the priestly caste, holding sacerdotal supremacy over the followers of  the Faith of Zoroaster, that same Voice, identifying itself with the voice  of the promised _Sh_ah-Bahram, has declared: \"O high priests! Ears have  been given you that they may hearken unto the mystery of Him Who is the  Self-Dependent, and eyes that they may behold Him. Wherefore flee ye? The  Incomparable Friend is manifest. He speaketh that wherein lieth salvation.  Were ye, O high priests, to discover the perfume of the rose garden of  understanding, ye would seek none other but Him, and would recognize, in  His new vesture, the All-Wise and Peerless One, and would turn your eyes  from the world and all who seek it, and would arise to help Him.\"  \"Whatsoever hath been announced in the Books,\" Baha'u'llah, replying to a  Zoroastrian who had inquired regarding the promised _Sh_ah-Bahram, has  written, \"hath been revealed and made clear. From every direction the  signs have been manifested. The Omnipotent One is calling, in this Day,  and announcing the appearance of the Supreme Heaven.\" \"This is not the  day,\" He, in another Tablet declares, \"whereon the high priests can  command and exercise their authority. In your Book it is stated that the  high priests will, on that Day, lead men far astray, and will prevent them  from drawing nigh unto Him. He indeed is a high priest who hath seen the  light and hastened unto the way leading to the Beloved.\" \"Say, O high  priests!\" He, again addresses them, \"The Hand of Omnipotence is stretched  forth from behind the clouds; behold ye it with new eyes. The tokens of  His majesty and greatness are unveiled; gaze ye on them with pure eyes....  Say, O high priests! Ye are held in reverence because of My Name, and yet  ye flee Me! Ye are the high priests of the Temple. Had ye been the high  priests of the Omnipotent One, ye would have been united with Him, and  would have recognized Him.... Say, O high priests! No man's acts shall be  acceptable, in this Day, unless he forsaketh mankind and all that men  possess, and setteth his face towards the Omnipotent One.\"    It is not, however, with either of these two Faiths that we are primarily  concerned. It is to Islam and, to a lesser extent, to Christianity that my  theme is directly related. Islam, from which the Faith of Baha'u'llah has  sprung, even as did Christianity from Judaism, is the religion within  whose pale that Faith first rose and developed, from whose ranks the great  mass of Baha'i adherents have been recruited, and by whose leaders they  have been, and indeed are still being, persecuted. Christianity, on the  other hand, is the religion to which the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19284"],[0,"Paris Talks (#20)"],[1,"PRINCIPLE--THE ABOLITION OF PREJUDICES      4 Avenue de Camoeens, Paris,  November 13th    All prejudices, whether of religion, race, politics or nation, must be  renounced, for these prejudices have caused the world's sickness. It is a  grave malady which, unless arrested, is capable of causing the destruction  of the whole human race. Every ruinous war, with its terrible bloodshed  and misery, has been caused by one or other of these prejudices.    The deplorable wars going on in these days are caused by the fanatical  religious hatred of one people for another, or the prejudices of race or  colour.    Until all these barriers erected by prejudice are swept away, it is not  possible for humanity to be at peace. For this reason Baha'u'llah has  said, 'These Prejudices are destructive to mankind'.    Contemplate first the prejudice of religion: consider the nations of  so-called religious people; if they were truly worshippers of God they  would obey His law which forbids them to kill one another.    If priests of religion really adored the God of love and served the Divine  Light, they would teach their people to keep the chief Commandment, 'To be  in love and charity with all men'. But we find the contrary, for it is  often the priests who encourage nations to fight. Religious hatred is ever  the most cruel!    All religions teach that we should love one another; that we should seek  out our own shortcomings before we presume to condemn the faults of  others, that we must not consider ourselves superior to our neighbours! We  must be careful not to exalt ourselves lest we be humiliated.    Who are we that we should judge? How shall we know who, in the sight of  God, is the most upright man? God's thoughts are not like our thoughts!  How many men who have seemed saint-like to their friends have fallen into  the greatest humiliation. Think of Judas Iscariot; he began well, but  remember his end! On the other hand, Paul, the Apostle, was in his early  life an enemy of Christ, whilst later he became His most faithful servant.  How then can we flatter ourselves and despise others?    Let us therefore be humble, without prejudices, preferring others' good to  our own! Let us never say, 'I am a believer but he is an infidel', 'I am  near to God, whilst he is an outcast'. We can never know what will be the  final judgment! Therefore let us help all who are in need of any kind of  assistance.    Let us teach the ignorant, and take care of the young child until he grows  to maturity. When we find a person fallen into the depths of misery or sin  we must be kind to him, take him by the hand, help him to regain his  footing, his strength; we must guide him with love and tenderness, treat  him as a friend not as an enemy.    We have no right to look upon any of our fellow-mortals as evil.    Concerning the prejudice of race: it is an illusion, a superstition pure  and simple! For God created us all of one race. There were no differences  in the beginning, for we are all descendants of Adam. In the beginning,  also, there were no limits and boundaries between the different lands; no  part of the earth belonged more to one people than to another. In the  sight of God there is no difference between the various races. Why should  man invent such a prejudice? How can we uphold war caused by an illusion?    God has not created men that they should destroy one another. All races,  tribes, sects and classes share equally in the Bounty of their Heavenly  Father.    The only difference lies in the degree of faithfulness, of obedience to  the laws of God. There are some who are as lighted torches, there are  others who shine as stars in the sky of humanity. The lovers of mankind,  these are the superior men, of whatever nation, creed, or colour they may  be. For it is they to whom God will say these blessed words, 'Well done,  My good and faithful servants'. In that day He will not ask, 'Are you  English, French, or perhaps Persian? Do you come from the East, or from  the West?'    The only division that is real is this: There are heavenly men and earthly  men; self-sacrificing servants of humanity in the love of the Most High,  bringing harmony and unity, teaching peace and goodwill to men. On the  other hand there are those selfish men, haters of their brethren, in whose  hearts prejudice has replaced loving kindness, and whose influence breeds  discord and strife.    To which race or to which colour belong these two divisions of men, to the  White, to the Yellow, to the Black, to the East or to the West, to the  North or to the South? If these are God's divisions, why should we invent  others? Political prejudice is equally mischievous, it is one of the  greatest causes of bitter strife amongst the children of men. There are  people who find pleasure in breeding discord, who constantly endeavour to  goad their country into making war upon other nations--and why? They think  to advantage their own country to the detriment of all others. They send  armies to harass and destroy the land, in order to become famous in the  world, for the joy of conquest. That it may be said: 'Such a country has  defeated another, and brought it under the yoke of their stronger, more  superior rule'. This victory, bought at the price of much bloodshed, is  not lasting! The conqueror shall one day be conquered; and the vanquished  ones victorious! Remember the history of the past: did not France conquer  Germany more than once--then did not the German nation overcome France?    We learn also that France conquered England; then was the English nation  victorious over France!    These glorious conquests are so ephemeral! Why attach so great importance  to them and to their fame, as to be willing to shed the blood of the  people for their attainment? Is any victory worth the inevitable train of  evils consequent upon human slaughter, the grief and sorrow and ruin which  must overwhelm so many homes of both nations? For it is not possible that  one country alone should suffer.    Oh! why will man, the disobedient child of God, who should be an example  of the power of the spiritual law, turn his face away from the Divine  Teaching and put all his effort into destruction and war?    My hope is that in this enlightened century the Divine Light of love will  shed its radiance over the whole world, seeking out the responsive heart's  intelligence of every human being; that the light of the Sun of Truth will  lead politicians to shake off all the claims of prejudice and  superstition, and with freed minds to follow the Policy of God: for Divine  Politics are mighty, man's politics are feeble! God has created all the  world, and bestows His Divine Bounty upon every creature.    Are we not the servants of God? Shall we neglect to follow our Master's  Example, and ignore His Commands?    I pray that the Kingdom shall come on Earth, and that all darkness shall  be driven away by the effulgence of the Heavenly Sun.          THE SIXTH PRINCIPLE--MEANS OF EXISTENCE      4 Avenue de Camoeens, Paris    One of the most important principles of the Teaching of Baha'u'llah is:    The right of every human being to the daily bread whereby they exist, or  the equalization of the means of livelihood.    The arrangements of the circumstances of the people must be such that  poverty shall disappear, that everyone, as far as possible, according to  his rank and position, shall share in comfort and well-being.    We see amongst us men who are overburdened with riches on the one hand,  and on the other those unfortunate ones who starve with nothing; those who  possess several stately palaces, and those who have not where to lay their  head. Some we find with numerous courses of costly and dainty food; whilst  others can scarce find sufficient crusts to keep them alive. Whilst some  are clothed in velvets, furs and fine linen, others have insufficient,  poor and thin garments with which to protect them from the cold.    This condition of affairs is wrong, and must be remedied. Now the remedy  must be carefully undertaken. It cannot be done by bringing to pass  absolute equality between men.    Equality is a chimera! It is entirely impracticable! Even if equality  could be achieved it could not continue--and if its existence were  possible, the whole order of the world would be destroyed. The law of  order must always obtain in the world of humanity. Heaven has so decreed  in the creation of man.    Some are full of intelligence, others have an ordinary amount of it, and  others again are devoid of intellect. In these three classes of men there  is order but not equality. How could it be possible that wisdom and  stupidity should be equal? Humanity, like a great army, requires a  general, captains, under-officers in their degree, and soldiers, each with  their own appointed duties. Degrees are absolutely necessary to ensure an  orderly organization. An army could not be composed of generals alone, or  of captains only, or of nothing but soldiers without one in authority. The  certain result of such a plan would be that disorder and demoralization  would overtake the whole army.    King Lycurgus, the philosopher, made a great plan to equalize the subjects  of Sparta; with self-sacrifice and wisdom was the experiment begun. Then  the king called the people of his kingdom, and made them swear a great  oath to maintain the same order of government if he should leave the  country, also that nothing should make them alter it until his return.  Having secured this oath, he left his kingdom of Sparta and never  returned. Lycurgus abandoned the situation, renouncing his high position,  thinking to achieve the permanent good of his country by the equalization  of the property and of the conditions of life in his kingdom. All the  self-sacrifice of the king was in vain. The great experiment failed. After  a time all was destroyed; his carefully thought-out constitution came to  an end."]]]
