I might well have needed that, for  with this hard blow of the proof that her eyes were hopelessly sealed  I felt my own situation horribly crumble, I felt--I saw--my livid  predecessor press, from her position, on my defeat, and I was conscious,  more than all, of what I should have from this instant to deal with in  the astounding little attitude of Flora. Into this attitude Mrs. Grose  immediately and violently entered, breaking, even while there pierced  through my sense of ruin a prodigious private triumph, into breathless  reassurance.    \"She isn't there, little lady, and nobody's there--and you never see  nothing, my sweet! How can poor Miss Jessel--when poor Miss Jessel's  dead and buried? WE know, don't we, love?\"--and she appealed, blundering  in, to the child. \"It's all a mere mistake and a worry and a joke--and  we'll go home as fast as we can!\"    Our companion, on this, had responded with a strange, quick primness of  propriety, and they were again, with Mrs. Grose on her feet, united, as  it were, in pained opposition to me. Flora continued to fix me with  her small mask of reprobation, and even at that minute I prayed God to  forgive me for seeming to see that, as she stood there holding tight  to our friend's dress, her incomparable childish beauty had suddenly  failed, had quite vanished. I've said it already--she was literally,  she was hideously, hard; she had turned common and almost ugly. \"I don't  know what you mean. I see nobody. I see nothing. I never HAVE. I think  you're cruel. I don't like you!\" Then, after this deliverance, which  might have been that of a vulgarly pert little girl in the street, she  hugged Mrs. Grose more closely and buried in her skirts the dreadful  little face. In this position she produced an almost furious wail. \"Take  me away, take me away--oh, take me away from HER!\"    \"From ME?\" I panted.    \"From you--from you!\" she cried.    Even Mrs. Grose looked across at me dismayed, while I had nothing to  do but communicate again with the figure that, on the opposite bank,  without a movement, as rigidly still as if catching, beyond the  interval, our voices, was as vividly there for my disaster as it was not  there for my service. The wretched child had spoken exactly as if she  had got from some outside source each of her stabbing little words, and  I could therefore, in the full despair of all I had to accept, but sadly  shake my head at her. \"If I had ever doubted, all my doubt would at  present have gone. I've been living with the miserable truth, and now  it has only too much closed round me. Of course I've lost you: I've  interfered, and you've seen--under HER dictation\"--with which I faced,  over the pool again, our infernal witness--\"the easy and perfect way to  meet it. I've done my best, but I've lost you. Goodbye.\" For Mrs.  Grose I had an imperative, an almost frantic \"Go, go!\" before which, in  infinite distress, but mutely possessed of the little girl and clearly  convinced, in spite of her blindness, that something awful had occurred  and some collapse engulfed us, she retreated, by the way we had come, as  fast as she could move.    Of what first happened when I was left alone I had no subsequent memory.  I only knew that at the end of, I suppose, a quarter of an hour, an  odorous dampness and roughness, chilling and piercing my trouble, had  made me understand that I must have thrown myself, on my face, on the  ground and given way to a wildness of grief. I must have lain there long  and cried and sobbed, for when I raised my head the day was almost done.  I got up and looked a moment, through the twilight, at the gray pool and  its blank, haunted edge, and then I took, back to the house, my dreary  and difficult course. When I reached the gate in the fence the boat,  to my surprise, was gone, so that I had a fresh reflection to make on  Flora's extraordinary command of the situation. She passed that night,  by the most tacit, and I should add, were not the word so grotesque a  false note, the happiest of arrangements, with Mrs. Grose. I saw  neither of them on my return, but, on the other hand, as by an ambiguous  compensation, I saw a great deal of Miles. I saw--I can use no other  phrase--so much of him that it was as if it were more than it had ever  been. No evening I had passed at Bly had the portentous quality of  this one; in spite of which--and in spite also of the deeper depths of  consternation that had opened beneath my feet--there was literally, in  the ebbing actual, an extraordinarily sweet sadness. On reaching the  house I had never so much as looked for the boy; I had simply gone  straight to my room to change what I was wearing and to take in, at  a glance, much material testimony to Flora's rupture. Her little  belongings had all been removed. When later, by the schoolroom fire, I  was served with tea by the usual maid, I indulged, on the article of my  other pupil, in no inquiry whatever. He had his freedom now--he might  have it to the end! Well, he did have it; and it consisted--in part at  least--of his coming in at about eight o'clock and sitting down with me  in silence. On the removal of the tea things I had blown out the candles  and drawn my chair closer: I was conscious of a mortal coldness and felt  as if I should never again be warm. So, when he appeared, I was sitting  in the glow with my thoughts. He paused a moment by the door as if to  look at me; then--as if to share them--came to the other side of the  hearth and sank into a chair. We sat there in absolute stillness; yet he  wanted, I felt, to be with me.          XXI      Before a new day, in my room, had fully broken, my eyes opened to Mrs.  Grose, who had come to my bedside with worse news. Flora was so markedly  feverish that an illness was perhaps at hand; she had passed a night of  extreme unrest, a night agitated above all by fears that had for their  subject not in the least her former, but wholly her present, governess.  It was not against the possible re-entrance of Miss Jessel on the scene  that she protested--it was conspicuously and passionately against mine.  I was promptly on my feet of course, and with an immense deal to ask;  the more that my friend had discernibly now girded her loins to meet me  once more. This I felt as soon as I had put to her the question of  her sense of the child's sincerity as against my own. \"She persists in  denying to you that she saw, or has ever seen, anything?\"    My visitor's trouble, truly, was great. \"Ah, miss, it isn't a matter  on which I can push her! Yet it isn't either, I must say, as if I much  needed to. It has made her, every inch of her, quite old.\"    \"Oh, I see her perfectly from here. She resents, for all the world like  some high little personage, the imputation on her truthfulness and,  as it were, her respectability. 'Miss Jessel indeed--SHE!' Ah, she's  'respectable,' the chit! The impression she gave me there yesterday was,  I assure you, the very strangest of all; it was quite beyond any of the  others. I DID put my foot in it! She'll never speak to me again.\"    Hideous and obscure as it all was, it held Mrs. Grose briefly silent;  then she granted my point with a frankness which, I made sure, had more  behind it. \"I think indeed, miss, she never will. She do have a grand  manner about it!\"    \"And that manner\"--I summed it up--\"is practically what's the matter  with her now!\"    Oh, that manner, I could see in my visitor's face, and not a little else  besides! \"She asks me every three minutes if I think you're coming in.\"    \"I see--I see.\" I, too, on my side, had so much more than worked it  out. \"Has she said to you since yesterday--except to repudiate her  familiarity with anything so dreadful--a single other word about Miss  Jessel?\"    \"Not one, miss. And of course you know,\" my friend added, \"I took it  from her, by the lake, that, just then and there at least, there WAS  nobody.\"    \"Rather! and, naturally, you take it from her still.\"    \"I don't contradict her. What else can I do?\"    \"Nothing in the world! You've the cleverest little person to deal with.  They've made them--their two friends, I mean--still cleverer even than  nature did; for it was wondrous material to play on! Flora has now her  grievance, and she'll work it to the end.\"    \"Yes, miss; but to WHAT end?\"    \"Why, that of dealing with me to her uncle. She'll make me out to him  the lowest creature--!\"    I winced at the fair show of the scene in Mrs. Grose's face; she looked  for a minute as if she sharply saw them together. \"And him who thinks so  well of you!\"    \"He has an odd way--it comes over me now,\" I laughed,\"--of proving it!  But that doesn't matter. What Flora wants, of course, is to get rid of  me.\"    My companion bravely concurred. \"Never again to so much as look at you.\"    \"So that what you've come to me now for,\" I asked, \"is to speed me on my  way?\" Before she had time to reply, however, I had her in check. \"I've a  better idea--the result of my reflections. My going WOULD seem the right  thing, and on Sunday I was terribly near it. Yet that won't do. It's YOU  who must go. You must take Flora.\"    My visitor, at this, did speculate. \"But where in the world--?\"    \"Away from here. Away from THEM. Away, even most of all, now, from me.  Straight to her uncle.\"    \"Only to tell on you--?\"    \"No, not 'only'! To leave me, in addition, with my remedy.\"    She was still vague. \"And what IS your remedy?\"    \"Your loyalty, to begin with. And then Miles's.\"    She looked at me hard. \"Do you think he--?\"    \"Won't, if he has the chance, turn on me? Yes, I venture still to think  it. At all events, I want to try. Get off with his sister as soon as  possible and leave me with him alone.\" I was amazed, myself, at the  spirit I had still in reserve,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20906"],[0,"The Journal of Negro History, Volume 3, 1918 (#20)"],[1,"others in your       labors, and when the phalanx is formed, bring on the press the       proposition perseveringly until its accomplishment.[124]    Writing to David Barrow in 1815 about the preparation of slaves for  emancipation, Jefferson said:         Unhappily it is a case for which both parties require long and       difficult preparation. The mind of the master is to be apprized       by reflection, and strengthened by the energies of conscience,       against the obstacles of self interest to an acquiescence in the       rights of others; that of the slave is to be prepared by       instruction and habit for self-government, and for the honest       pursuits of industry and social duty. Both of these courses of       preparation require time, and the former must precede the latter.       Some progress is sensibly made in it; yet not so much as I had       hoped and expected. But it will yield in time to temperate and       steady pursuit, to the enlargement of the human mind, and its       advancement in science. We are not in a world ungoverned by the       laws and the power of a Superior Agent. Our efforts are in His       hand, and directed by it; and He will give them their effect in       his own time. Where the disease is most deeply seated, there it       will be slowest in eradication. In the Northern States it was       merely superficial, and easily corrected. In the Southern it is       incorporated with the whole system, and requires time, patience       and perseverance in the curative process. That it may finally be       effected, and its process hastened, will be my last and fondest       prayer.[125]    In a letter to Dr. Thomas Humphreys in 1817, Jefferson expressed fear  about the purchase of slaves by the United States.         The bare proposition of purchase (of the slaves) by the United       States generally would excite infinite indignation in all the       States north of Maryland. The sacrifice must fall on the States       alone which hold them; and the difficult question will be how to       lessen this so as to reconcile our fellow citizens to it.       Personally, I am ready and desirous to make any sacrifice which       shall ensure their gradual but complete retirement from the       State, and effectually, at the same time, establish them       elsewhere in freedom and safety.[126]         I concur entirely in your leading principles of gradual       emancipation, of establishment on the coast of Africa, and the       patronage of our nation until the emigrants shall be able to       protect themselves.[127]    Jefferson saw in the extension of slavery that which had given the  institution a new aspect in lessening the difficulty by dividing it.         I can say with conscious truth that there is not a man on earth       who would sacrifice more than I would to relieve us from this       heavy reproach in any _practicable_ way. The cession of that kind       of property, for so it is misnamed, is a bagatelle which would       not cost me a second thought, if, in that way, a general       emancipation and _expatriation_ could be effected; and,       gradually, and with due sacrifices, I think it might be. But, as       it is, we have the wolf by the ears, and we can neither hold him,       nor safely let him go. Justice is in the one scale and       self-preservation in the other.[128]         Of one thing I am certain, that as the passage of slaves from one       State to another, would not make a slave of a single human being       who would not be so without it, so their diffusion over a greater       surface would make them individually happier, and proportionally       facilitate the accomplishment of their emancipation, by dividing       the burden on a greater number of coadjutors. An abstinence, too,       from this act of power would remove the jealousy excited by the       undertaking of Congress to regulate the condition of the       different descriptions of men composing a State, which nothing in       the Constitution has taken from them and given to the General       Government. Could Congress, for example, say that the non-freemen       of Connecticut shall be freemen, or that they shall not emigrate       into any other State?[129]    During the closing years of his life he expressed little hope of  seeing his plan of gradual emancipation carried out.         It was found that the public mind would not bear the proposition       (gradual emancipation), nor will it bear it even at this day       (1821). Yet the day is not distant when it must bear and adopt       it, or worse will follow. Nothing is more certainly written in       the book of fate, than that these people are to be free; nor is       it less certain, that the two races, equally free, cannot live in       the same government. Nature, habit, opinion have drawn indelible       lines of distinction between them. It is still in our power to       direct the process of emancipation and deportation, peaceably,       and in such slow degree, as that the evil will wear off       insensible, and their place be, _pari passu_, filled up by free       white laborers. If, on the contrary, it is left to force itself       on, human nature must shudder at the prospect held up. We should       in vain look for an example in the Spanish deportation, or       deletion of the Moors. This precedent would fall far short of our       case.[130]                *       *       *       *       *         In 1769, I became a member of the legislature by the choice of       the country in which I live (Albemarle), and so continued until       it was closed by the Revolution. I made one effort in that body       for the permission of the emancipation of slaves, which was       rejected; and indeed, during the regal government, nothing       liberal could expect success. Our minds were circumscribed within       narrow limits, by an habitual belief that it was our duty to be       subordinate to the mother country in all matters of government,       to direct all our labors in subservience to her interests, and       even to observe a bigoted intolerance for all religions but hers.       The difficulties with our representatives were of habit and       despair, not of reflection and conviction. Experience soon proved       that they could bring their minds to rights on the first summons       of their attention. But the King's Council, which acted as       another house of legislature, held their places at will, and were       in most humble obedience to that will; the Governor, too, who had       a negative on our laws, held by the same tenure, and with still       greater devotedness to it; and, last of all, the royal negative       closed the last door to every hope of       ameloration.--Autobiography.[131]         The first establishment (of slavery) in Virginia which became       permanent, was made in 1607. I have found no mention of negroes       in the Colony until about 1650. The first brought here as slaves       were by a Dutch ship; after which the English commenced the       trade, and continued it until the Revolutionary war. That       suspended, _ipso facto_, their further importation for the       present, and the business of the war pressing constantly on the       legislature, this subject was not acted on finally until the year       '78, when I brought in a bill to prevent their further       importation. This passed without opposition, and stopped the       increase of the evil by importation, leaving to future efforts       its final eradication.--Autobiography.[132]         Our only blot is becoming less offensive by the great improvement       in the condition and civilization of that race, who can now more       advantageously compare their situation with that of the laborers       of Europe. Still it is a hideous blot, as well from the       heteromorph peculiarities of the race, as that, with them,       physical compulsion to action must be substituted for the moral       necessity which constrains the free laborers to work equally       hard. We feel and deplore it morally and politically, and we look       without entire despair to some redeeming means not yet       specifically foreseen. I am happy in believing that the       conviction of the necessity of removing this evil gains ground       with time. Their emigration to the westward lightens the       difficulty by dividing it, and renders it more practicable on the       whole. And the neighborhood of a government of their color       promises a more accessible asylum than that from whence they       came.[133]    Showing the difficulty of purchase in case of the adoption of the  policy, Jefferson wrote Jared Sparks in 1824:         Actual property has been lawfully vested in that form (negroes)       and who can lawfully take it from the possessors?[134]         Who would estimate its blessed effects? I leave this to those who       will live to see their accomplishment, and to enjoy a beatitude       forbidden to my age. But I leave it with this admonition,--to       rise and be doing. A million and a half are within our control;       but six millions (which a majority of those now living will see       them attain), and one million of these fighting men, will say,       \"we will not go.\"[135]         The separation of infants from their mothers would produce some       scruples of humanity. But this would be straining at a gnat, and       swallowing a camel.[136]    Jefferson became interested in the schemes of Miss Fanny Wright, who  was endeavoring to promote gradual emancipation through an  Emancipating Labor Society. He wrote her in 1825:         The abolition of the evil is not impossible; it ought never,       therefore, to be despaired of. Every plan should be adopted,       every experiment tried, which may do something towards the       ultimate object. That which you propose is well worthy of trial."]]]
