The most memorable instance of spiritual consultation was the meeting of  the disciples of Jesus Christ upon the mount after His ascension. They  said, \"Jesus Christ has been crucified, and we have no longer association  and intercourse with Him in His physical body; therefore, we must be loyal  and faithful to Him, we must be grateful and appreciate Him, for He has  raised us from the dead, He made us wise, He has given us eternal life.  What shall we do to be faithful to Him?\" And so they held council. One of  them said, \"We must detach ourselves from the chains and fetters of the  world; otherwise, we cannot be faithful.\" The others replied, \"That is  so.\" Another said, \"Either we must be married and faithful to our wives  and children or serve our Lord free from these ties. We cannot be occupied  with the care and provision for families and at the same time herald the  Kingdom in the wilderness. Therefore, let those who are unmarried remain  so, and those who have married provide means of sustenance and comfort for  their families and then go forth to spread the message of glad tidings.\"  There were no dissenting voices; all agreed, saying, \"That is right.\" A  third disciple said, \"To perform worthy deeds in the Kingdom we must be  further self-sacrificing. From now on we should forego ease and bodily  comfort, accept every difficulty, forget self and teach the Cause of God.\"  This found acceptance and approval by all the others. Finally a fourth  disciple said, \"There is still another aspect to our faith and unity. For  Jesus' sake we shall be beaten, imprisoned and exiled. They may kill us.  Let us receive this lesson now. Let us realize and resolve that though we  are beaten, banished, cursed, spat upon and led forth to be killed, we  shall accept all this joyfully, loving those who hate and wound us.\" All  the disciples replied, \"Surely we will--it is agreed; this is right.\" Then  they descended from the summit of the mountain, and each went forth in a  different direction upon his divine mission.    This was true consultation. This was spiritual consultation and not the  mere voicing of personal views in parliamentary opposition and debate.          2 May 1912  Talk to Federation of Women's Clubs  Hotel La Salle, Chicago, Illinois      Notes by Joseph H. Hannen    One of the functions of the sun is to quicken and reveal the hidden  realities of the kingdoms of existence. Through the light and heat of the  great central luminary, all that is potential in the earth is awakened and  comes forth into the realm of the visible. The fruit hidden in the tree  appears upon its branches in response to the power of the sun; man and all  other organisms live, move and have their being under its developing rays;  nature is resplendent with countless evolutionary forms through its  pervading impulse--so that we can say a function of the sun is the  revelation of the mysteries and creative purposes hidden within the  phenomenal world.    The outer sun is a sign or symbol of the inner and ideal Sun of Truth, the  Word of God. Inasmuch as this is the century of light, it is evident that  the Sun of Reality, the Word, has revealed itself to all humankind. One of  the potentialities hidden in the realm of humanity was the capability or  capacity of womanhood. Through the effulgent rays of divine illumination  the capacity of woman has become so awakened and manifest in this age that  equality of man and woman is an established fact. In past ages woman was  wronged and oppressed. This was especially the case in Asia and Africa. In  certain parts of Asia women were not considered as members of humankind.  They were looked upon as inferior, unworthy creatures, subordinate and  subject to man. A certain people known as the Nusayris held to the belief  for a long period that woman was the incarnation of the evil spirit, or  Satan, and that man alone was the manifestation of God, the Merciful. At  last this century of light dawned, the realities shone forth, and the  mysteries long hidden from human vision were revealed. Among these  revealed realities was the great principle of the equality of man and  woman, which is now finding recognition throughout the whole  world--America, Europe and the Orient.    History records the appearance in the world of women who have been signs  of guidance, power and accomplishment. Some were notable poets, some  philosophers and scientists, others courageous upon the field of battle.  Qurratu'l-'Ayn, a Baha'i, was a poetess. She discomfited the learned men  of Persia by her brilliancy and fervor. When she entered a meeting, even  the learned were silent. She was so well versed in philosophy and science  that those in her presence always considered and consulted her first. Her  courage was unparalleled; she faced her enemies fearlessly until she was  killed. She withstood a despotic king, the _Sh_ah of Persia, who had the  power to decree the death of any of his subjects. There was not a day  during which he did not command the execution of some. This woman singly  and alone withstood such a despot until her last breath, then gave her  life for her faith.    Consider the mysteries revealed during the last half century, all due to  the effulgence of the Sun of Reality, which has been so gloriously  manifested in this age and cycle. In this day man must investigate reality  impartially and without prejudice in order to reach the true knowledge and  conclusions. What, then, constitutes the inequality between man and woman?  Both are human. In powers and function each is the complement of the  other. At most it is this: that woman has been denied the opportunities  which man has so long enjoyed, especially the privilege of education. But  even this is not always a shortcoming. Shall we consider it an  imperfection and weakness in her nature that she is not proficient in the  school of military tactics, that she cannot go forth to the field of  battle and kill, that she is not able to handle a deadly weapon? Nay,  rather, is it not a compliment when we say that in hardness of heart and  cruelty she is inferior to man? The woman who is asked to arm herself and  kill her fellow creatures will say, \"I cannot.\" Is this to be considered a  fault and lack of qualification as man's equal? Yet be it known that if  woman had been taught and trained in the military science of slaughter,  she would have been the equivalent of man even in this accomplishment. But  God forbid! May woman never attain this proficiency; may she never wield  weapons of war, for the destruction of humanity is not a glorious  achievement. The upbuilding of a home, the bringing of joy and comfort  into human hearts are truly glories of mankind. Let not a man glory in  this, that he can kill his fellow creatures; nay, rather, let him glory in  this, that he can love them.    When we consider the kingdoms of existence below man, we find no  distinction or estimate of superiority and inferiority between male and  female. Among the myriad organisms of the vegetable and animal kingdoms  sex exists, but there is no differentiation whatever as to relative  importance and value in the equation of life. If we investigate  impartially, we may even find species in which the female is superior or  preferable to the male. For instance, there are trees such as the fig, the  male of which is fruitless while the female is fruitful. The male of the  date palm is valueless while the female bears abundantly. Inasmuch as we  find no ground for distinction or superiority according to the creative  wisdom in the lower kingdoms, is it logical or becoming of man to make  such distinction in regard to himself? The male of the animal kingdom does  not glory in its being male and superior to the female. In fact, equality  exists and is recognized. Why should man, a higher and more intelligent  creature, deny and deprive himself of this equality the animals enjoy? His  surest index and guide as to the creative intention concerning himself are  the conditions and analogies of the kingdoms below him where equality of  the sexes is fundamental.    The truth is that all mankind are the creatures and servants of one God,  and in His estimate all are human. Man is a generic term applying to all  humanity. The biblical statement \"Let us make man in our image, after our  likeness\" does not mean that woman was not created. The image and likeness  of God apply to her as well. In Persian and Arabic there are two distinct  words translated into English as man: one meaning man and woman  collectively, the other distinguishing man as male from woman the female.  The first word and its pronoun are generic, collective; the other is  restricted to the male. This is the same in Hebrew.    To accept and observe a distinction which God has not intended in creation  is ignorance and superstition. The fact which is to be considered,  however, is that woman, having formerly been deprived, must now be allowed  equal opportunities with man for education and training. There must be no  difference in their education. Until the reality of equality between man  and woman is fully established and attained, the highest social  development of mankind is not possible. Even granted that woman is  inferior to man in some degree of capacity or accomplishment, this or any  other distinction would continue to be productive of discord and trouble.  The only remedy is education, opportunity; for equality means equal  qualification. In brief, the assumption of superiority by man will  continue to be depressing to the ambition of woman, as if her attainment  to equality was creationally impossible; woman's aspiration toward  advancement will be checked by it, and she will gradually become hopeless.  On the contrary, we must declare that her capacity is equal, even greater  than man's. This will inspire her with hope and ambition, and her  susceptibilities for "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19287"],[0,"Selections from the Writings of `Abdu'l-Bahá (#20)"],[1,"that has of late come to pass is this, that the  edifice of the Ma_sh_riqu'l-A_dh_kar is being raised in the very heart of  the American continent, and numerous souls from the surrounding regions  are contributing for the erection of this holy Temple. Among these is a  highly esteemed lady of the city of Manchester, who hath been moved to  offer her share.    Having no portion of goods and earthly riches, she sheared off with her  own hands the fine, long and precious tresses that adorned her head so  gracefully, and offered them for sale, that the price thereof might  promote the cause of the Ma_sh_riqu'l-A_dh_kar.    Consider ye, that though in the eyes of women nothing is more precious  than rich and flowing locks, yet notwithstanding this, that  highly-honoured lady hath evinced so rare and beautiful a spirit of  self-sacrifice.    And though this was uncalled for, and 'Abdu'l-Baha would not have  consented to such a deed, yet as it doth reveal so high and noble a spirit  of devotion, He was deeply touched thereby. Precious though the hair be in  the sight of western women, nay, more precious than life itself, yet she  offered it up as a sacrifice for the cause of the Ma_sh_riqu'l-A_dh_kar!    It is related that once in the days of the Apostle of God(32) He signified  His desire that an army should advance in a certain direction, and leave  was granted unto the faithful to raise contributions for the holy war.  Among many was one man who gave a thousand camels, each laden with corn,  another who gave half his substance, and still another who offered all  that he had. But a woman stricken in years, whose sole possession was a  handful of dates, came to the Apostle and laid at His feet her humble  contribution. Thereupon the Prophet of God--may my life be offered up as a  sacrifice unto Him--bade that this handful of dates be placed over and  above all the contributions that had been gathered, thus asserting the  merit and superiority thereof over all the rest. This was done because  that elderly woman had no other earthly possessions but these.    And in like manner this esteemed lady had nothing else to contribute but  her precious locks, and these she gloriously sacrificed in the cause of  the Ma_sh_riqu'l-A_dh_kar.    Ponder and reflect how mighty and potent hath the Cause of God become! A  woman of the west hath given her hair for the glory of the  Ma_sh_riqu'l-A_dh_kar.    Nay, this is but a lesson unto them that perceive.    In conclusion I am greatly pleased with the loved ones in Najaf-Abad for,  from the very early dawn of the Cause unto this day they have one and all  under all conditions evinced a great spirit of self-sacrifice.    Zaynu'l-Muqarrabin hath throughout his lifetime prayed with all the  sincerity of his stainless soul on behalf of the believers in Najaf-Abad  and implored for them the grace of God and His divine confirmation.    The Lord be praised that the prayers of this gracious soul have been  answered, for the effects thereof are everywhere manifest.            64: THE MASHRIQU'L-ADHKAR IS ONE OF THE MOST VITAL ...      The Ma_sh_riqu'l-A_dh_kar is one of the most vital institutions in the  world, and it hath many subsidiary branches. Although it is a House of  Worship, it is also connected with a hospital, a drug dispensary, a  traveller's hospice, a school for orphans, and a university for advanced  studies. Every Ma_sh_riqu'l-A_dh_kar is connected with these five things.  My hope is that the Ma_sh_riqu'l-A_dh_kar will now be established in  America, and that gradually the hospital, the school, the university, the  dispensary and the hospice, all functioning according to the most  efficient and orderly procedures, will follow. Make these matters known to  the beloved of the Lord, so that they will understand how very great is  the importance of this 'Dawning-Point of the Remembrance of God.' The  Temple is not only a place for worship; rather, in every respect is it  complete and whole.    O thou dear handmaid of God! If only thou couldst know what a high station  is destined for those souls who are severed from the world, are powerfully  attracted to the Faith, and are teaching, under the sheltering shadow of  Baha'u'llah! How thou wouldst rejoice, how thou wouldst, in exultation and  rapture, spread thy wings and soar heavenward--for being a follower of such  a way, and a traveller toward such a Kingdom.    As to the terminology I used in my letter, bidding thee to consecrate  thyself to service in the Cause of God, the meaning of it is this: limit  thy thoughts to teaching the Faith. Act by day and night according to the  teachings and counsels and admonitions of Baha'u'llah. This doth not  preclude marriage. Thou canst take unto thyself a husband and at the same  time serve the Cause of God; the one doth not preclude the other. Know  thou the value of these days; let not this chance escape thee. Beg thou  God to make thee a lighted candle, so that thou mayest guide a great  multitude through this darksome world.            65: O THOU FAVOURED HANDMAID OF THE HEAVENLY KINGDOM! ...      O thou favoured handmaid of the heavenly Kingdom! Thy letter hath been  received. It conveyeth high aspirations and noble goals, saying that thou  hast in mind to make a journey to the Far East, and that thou art ready to  endure extreme hardships, in order to guide the souls, and to spread far  and wide the glad tidings of God's Kingdom. This purpose of thine  betokeneth that thou, dear handmaid of God, dost cherish the very noblest  of all aims.    When delivering the glad tidings, speak out and say: the Promised One of  all the world's peoples hath now been made manifest. For each and every  people, and every religion, await a Promised One, and Baha'u'llah is that  One Who is awaited by all; and therefore the Cause of Baha'u'llah will  bring about the oneness of mankind, and the tabernacle of unity will be  upraised on the heights of the world, and the banners of the universality  of all humankind will be unfurled on the peaks of the earth. When thou  dost loose thy tongue to deliver this great good news, this will become  the means of teaching the people.    Thy projected journey, however, is to a very far-away land, and unless a  group of persons be available, the glad tidings will not take much effect  in that place. If ye think best, travel instead to Persia, and on the way  back, go through Japan and China. This would appear to be much better, and  far more enjoyable. In any case, do whatever seemeth feasible, and it will  be approved.            66: O THOU WHO HAST SOUGHT ILLUMINATION FROM THE ...      O thou who hast sought illumination from the light of guidance! Praise  thou God that He hath directed thee to the light of truth and hath invited  thee to enter the Kingdom of Abha. Thy sight hath been illumined and thy  heart hath been turned into a rose garden. I pray for thee that thou  mayest ever grow in faith and assurance, shine like unto a torch in the  assemblies and bestow upon them the light of guidance.    Whenever an illumined assembly of the friends of God is gathered,  'Abdu'l-Baha, although bodily absent, is yet present in spirit and in  soul. I am always a traveller to America and am assuredly associating with  spiritual and illumined friends. Distance is annihilated and prevents not  the close and intimate association of two souls that are closely attached  in heart even though they may be in two different countries. I am  therefore thy close companion, attuned and in harmony with thy soul.            67: O THOU LADY OF THE KINGDOM! THY LETTER SENT FROM ...      O thou lady of the Kingdom! Thy letter sent from New York hath been  received. Its contents imparted joy and gladness for they indicated that  with a firm resolve and a pure intention thou hast determined to travel to  Paris, that thou mayest in that silent city enkindle the fire of the love  of God and in the midst of that darkness of nature shine like unto a  resplendent candle. This journey is highly praiseworthy and suitable. When  thou reachest Paris, thou must strive, no matter how small the number of  the friends may be, to institute the assembly of the Covenant and to  vivify the souls through the power of the Covenant.    Paris is exceedingly dispirited and is in a state of torpor and so far it  hath not burst into flames although the French nation is an active and  lively one. But the world of nature hath fully stretched its pavilion over  Paris and hath done away with religious sentiments. But this power of the  Covenant shall heat every freezing soul, shall bestow light upon  everything that is dark and shall secure for the captive in the hand of  nature the true freedom of the Kingdom.    Arise thou at present in Paris with the power of the Kingdom, with a  divine confirmation, with a genuine zeal and ardour and with a flame of  the love of God. Roar like unto a lion and exhibit such ecstasy and love  among these few souls that praise and glorification may continuously reach  thee from the divine Kingdom and mighty confirmations may descend upon  thee. Rest thou assured. If thou dost act accordingly and hoist the  standard of the Covenant, Paris shall burst into flame. Be constantly  attached to and seek always the confirmations of Baha'u'llah for these  turn the drop into a sea and convert the gnat into an eagle.            68: O YE WHO ARE FIRM IN THE COVENANT AND THE TESTAMENT! ...      O ye who are firm in the Covenant and the Testament! Your letter was  received and your blessed names were one by one perused. The contents of  the letter were divine inspirations and manifest bounties because they  were indicative of the union of the friends and the harmony of all hearts.    Today the most remarkable favour of God centereth around union and harmony  among the friends; so that this unity and concord may be the cause of the  promulgation of the oneness of the world of humanity,"]]]
