The shamans and their faithful followers believe, or profess to believe,  that the direst vengeance of the gods would visit them if these rites  were varied in the least in picture, prayer, song, or ceremonial. The  mere fact that there are different schools among the medicine men may be  regarded as an evidence that changes have occurred.      160. FIRST PICTURE. The picture of the first day (Plate XV) is said to  represent the visit of Dsilyi` NeyÃ¡ni to the home of the snakes at  QoÂ¢estsÃ². (Paragraph 53.)      [Illustration:    Bureau of Ethnology    Fifth Annual Report Pl. XV    FIRST DRY-PAINTING]    161. In the center of the picture was a circular concavity, about six  inches in diameter, intended to represent water, presumably the house of  water mentioned in the myth. In all the other pictures where water was  represented a small bowl was actually sunk in the ground and filled with  water, which water was afterwards sprinkled with powdered charcoal to  give the impression of a flat, dry surface. Why the bowl of water was  omitted in this picture I do not know, but a medicine man of a different  fraternity from that of the one who drew the picture informed me that  with men of his school the bowl filled with water was used in the snake  picture as well as in the others. Closely surrounding this central  depression are four parallelograms about four inches by ten inches in  the original pictures. The half nearer the center is red; the outer half  is blue; they are bordered with narrow lines of white. The same figures  are repeated in other paintings. They appear in this drawing, and  frequently in others, as something on which the gods seem to stand. They  are the ca`bitlÃ²l, or rafts of sunbeam, the favorite vessels on which  the divine ones navigate the upper deep. In the Navajo myths, when a god  has a particularly long and speedy journey to make, he takes two  sunbeams and, placing them side by side, is borne off in a twinkling  whither he wills. Red is the color proper to sunlight in their  symbolism, but the red and blue together represent sunbeams in the  morning and evening skies when they show an alternation of blue and red.  It will be seen later that the sunbeam shafts, the halo, and the rainbow  are represented by the same colors. In form, however, the halo is  circular, and the rainbow is distinguished by its curvature, and it is  usually anthropomorphic, while the sunbeam and the halo are not.  External to these sunbeam rafts, and represented as standing on them,  are the figures of eight serpents, two white ones in the east, two blue  ones in the south, two yellow ones in the west, and two black ones in  the north. These snakes cross one another (in pairs) so as to form four  figures like the letter +X+. In drawing these +X+'s the snake which  appears to be beneath is made first complete in every respect, and then  the other snake is drawn over it in conformity with their realistic laws  of art before referred to. The neck, in all cases, is blue, crossed with  four bands of red. The necks of the gods in all the pictures, it will be  observed, are made thus, but the bars in the manlike figures run  transversely, while those in the snake-like run diagonally. Three rows  of +V+-shaped figures, four in each row, are seen on the backs of the  snakes; these are simply to represent mottlings. Outside of these eight  snakes are four more of much greater length; they form a frame or  boundary to the picture, except in the west, where the mountain of  DsilyÃ -iÃ§Ã­n lies beyond them. There is a white snake in the east, lying  from north to south and bounding the picture in the east; a blue snake,  of similar size and shape, in the south; a yellow one in the west, and a  black one in the north. They seem as if following one another around the  picture in the direction of the sun's apparent course, the head of the  east snake approximating the tail of the south snake, and so on.    162. In the northeast is seen the yay, Niltci, who accompanied the  Navajo prophet to the home of the snakes. In the extreme west is a black  circular figure representing the mountain of DsilyÃ -iÃ§Ã­n. In the  original picture the mountain was in relief--which I have not attempted  to represent--a little mound of about ten or twelve inches high. The  description of the mountain given in the myth is duly symbolized in the  picture, the halo added. The green spot in the center is designed to  represent a twig of spruce which was stuck in the mound of sand to  indicate the spruce tree door. From the summit of the mountain to the  middle of the central waters is drawn a wide line in corn meal, with  four footprints, depicted at intervals, in the same material. This  represents the track of a bear. Immediately south of this track is the  figure of an animal drawn in gray pigment. This is the grizzly himself,  which here, I have reason to believe, is used as a symbol of the Navajo  prophet. The bear, in the sacred language of the shamans, is  appropriately called Dsilyi` NeyÃ¡ni, since he is truly reared within the  mountains. His track, being represented by a streak of meal, has  reference to the same thing as the name akÃ¡ninili and the practice of  the couriers (paragraph 102), who are dressed to represent the prophet,  throwing corn meal in front of them when they travel.      163. The SECOND PICTURE is said to be a representation of the painting,  which the prophet saw in the home of the bears in the Carrizo Mountains  (paragraph 40). In the center of this figure is the bowl of water  covered with black powder, to which I referred before. The edge of the  bowl is adorned with sunbeams, and external to it are the four  ca`bitlol, or sunbeam rafts, on which seem to stand four gods, or yays.    164. The divine forms are shaped alike but colored differently. They lie  with heads extended outward, one to each of the four cardinal points of  the compass, the faces looking forward, the arms half extended on either  side, with the hands raised to a level with the shoulders. They wear  around their loins skirts of red sunlight, adorned with sunbeams. They  have ear pendants, bracelets, and armlets, blue and red (of turquoise  and coral), the prehistoric and emblematic jewels of the Navajo. Their  forearms and legs are black, showing in each a zigzag mark to represent  lightning on the surface of the black rain clouds. In the north god  these colors are, for artistic reasons, reversed. Each bears, attached  to his right hand with a string, a rattle, a charm, and a basket. The  rattle is of the shape of those used by the medicine men in this  particular dance, made of raw hide and painted to symbolize the rain  cloud and lightning. The left hand is empty; but beside each one is a  highly conventionalized picture of a plant. The left hand remains empty,  as it were, to grasp this plant, to indicate that the plant at the left  hand belongs to the god whose corresponding hand is unoccupied and  extended towards it. The proprietorship of each god in his own  particular plant is further indicated by making the plant the same color  as the god. The body of the eastern god is white; so is the stalk of  corn at his left, in the southeast. The body of the southern god is  blue; so is the beanstalk beside him, in the southwest. The body of the  western god is yellow; so is his pumpkin vine, in the northwest. The  body of the north god is black; so is the tobacco plant, which is under  his special protection, in the northeast.    165. Each of the four sacred plants is represented as growing from five  white roots in the central waters and spreading outwards to the  periphery of the picture. The gods form one cross whose limbs are  directed to the four cardinal points; the plants form another cross  having a common center with the first named cross, but whose limbs  extend to the intermediate points of the compass.    166. On the head of each yay is an eagle plume lying horizontally and  pointing to the right. A similar arrangement of four plumes, all  pointing in one direction (contrary to the sun's apparent course), may  be observed on the baskets carried by the gods.      [Illustration:    Bureau of Ethnology    Fifth Annual Report Pl. XVI    SECOND DRY PAINTING]    167. The gods are represented with beautiful embroidered pouches, each  of a different pattern. In old days the most beautiful things in art the  Navajo knew of were the porcupine quill embroideries of the northern  races. The art of garnishing with quills, and later with beads, seems  never to have been practiced to any extent by the Navajo women. They  obtained embroideries of the Ute and other northern tribes, and their  ancient legends abound in allusions to the great esteem in which they  held them. (See, for instance, paragraphs 32, 34.) Hence, to represent  the grandeur and potency of their gods, they adorn them with these  beautiful and much coveted articles.    168. Surrounding the picture on about three-fourths of its circumference  is the anthropomorphic rainbow or rainbow deity. It consists of two long  stripes, each about two inches wide in the original picture, one of  blue, one of red, bordered and separated by narrow lines of white. At  the southeastern end of the bow is a representation of the body below  the waist, such as the other gods have, consisting of pouch, skirt,  legs, and feet. At the northeastern end we have head, neck, and arms.  The head of the rainbow is rectangular, while the heads of the other  forms in this picture are round. In the pictures of the YÃ ybichy dance  we frequently observe the same difference in the heads. Some are  rectangular, some are round; the former are females, the latter males;  and whenever any of these gods are represented, by characters, in a  dance, those who enact the females wear square stiff masks, like our  dominoes,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20840"],[0,"Rebel Spurs (#20)"],[1,"like the odds. Not Apaches, probably  _bandidos_----\"    \"Kitchell?\" Drew asked.    \"My guess is they ain't sure. Got hit quick an' had to stampede to save  their skins.\"    Oliveri's men were taken in and Drew saw Rennie himself going from one of  the wounded to another, applying bandages and once probing skillfully for  a bullet. Drew commented on that, and Nye answered:    \"Old Man knows what's he's doin'. He ain't no real doc, of course, but was  I totin' me a hunka lead in some serious part, I'd rather have him diggin'  for it than a lotta docs I've seen out here. Heard tell as how once he was  plannin' to be a real doc hisself. He sure can take care of a fella good.  What I'd like to know is how them bushwhackers knew jus' where to lay down  an' wait for Oliveri.\"    \"What do you mean?\"    \"This here _Coronel_, he was comin' to buy hosses an' so he was carryin'  money or else somethin' as could pass for money. We all knowed he was  comin'. But we didn't know when or what road, an' he wasn't tellin' that  his side of th' border neither. Only some jasper had such a good idea as  to that what an' where, he an' some _amigos_ was squattin' back of rocks  jus' waitin' for th' _Coronel_ to ride into their little pocket of fire.\"    \"Mexicans could have trailed them up, cut ahead and waited----\"    \"Sure. Only this operation was too slick for most _bandidos_. They don't  go in for timed, planned things; they jus' cut loose when they see a  chance. This was different. Only Fenner an' some of the train guards  ridin' in spoiled their game.\"    \"Kitchell then?\"    \"Sounds more like. Don't think Kitchell's some common ridge-ridin' bad  man. He'd never've lasted this long was that so--not with th' Old Man an'  th' army an' what law there is in th' territory all gunnin' for him. Plans  things, Kitchell does, an' so far his plannin' has always paid off.    \"There's something else true now, too. Was Kitchell plannin' to make a  break south, he'd want him a good big stake to cover him on cold nights  an' winter days. I jus' wonder if this here ain't th' first of a lot of  fancy raidin' jobs. Could be he'll hit fast an' hard, gather up all th'  sweepin's an' light out. Could jus' be....\"    \"Don't promise us much shadin' times, does it?\" Anse remarked. \"Sounds  like everybody's goin' to have to set up a string an' ride hosses in  rotation. That is, always supposin' your supposin' is right.\"    \"Yeah, always supposin' that,\" Nye agreed.            11      \"Magnifico!\"    Drew glanced over Shiloh's back to the speaker. _Coronel_ Oliveri paused  in the doorway of the stable to study the stallion with almost exuberant  admiration mirrored on his dark and mobile features.    \"_Don_ Cazar\"--the Mexican officer raised a gloved hand in a beckoning  gesture--\"_por favor_, Excellency ... this one, he is of the Blood?\"    Hunt Rennie joined Oliveri. \"You are right. He is indeed of the Blood,\" he  assented.    \"It is past all hope then to offer for him?\" Oliveri was smiling, but his  eyes held a greedy glint Drew had seen before. Shiloh was apt to produce  that reaction in any horseman.    \"He is not mine to sell, _Coronel_. He belongs to _Senor_ Kirby who stands  there with him.\"    \"So?\" Oliveri's open astonishment irritated Drew. Maybe he did have on  rough work clothes and look the part of a range drifter. But then when the  _Coronel_ had arrived here last night, _he_ had not been too neat either.    \"A fine horse, _senor_.\" Oliveri came on in, now including Drew in his  gaze.    \"I think so, _Coronel_,\" Drew returned shortly. He gave a last brush to  flank and smoothed the saddle blanket.    \"From a distance you have brought him, _senor_?\" Oliveri walked about the  stud as Drew went to fetch his saddle.    \"From Kentucky.\" Was he unduly suspicious or was there a challenge in the  Mexican officer's voice--a faint suggestion that the antecedents of both  horse and owner were in question?    \"Kentucky ...\" Oliveri stumbled in his repetition of the word. \"I have  heard of Kentucky horses.\"    \"Most people have.\" Drew tightened the cinch. Then his pride in Shiloh  banished some of his stiffness. \"He is of the line of Eclipse.\" Maybe that  would not mean much to a Mexican, though. The breeding of eastern American  horses probably did not register south of the border.    \"_Senor_--such a one--he is not for sale?\"    \"No.\" Drew knew that sounded curt, but Oliveri ruffled him. He added, \"One  does not sell a friend.\"    Oliveri gave what sounded to Drew like an exaggerated sigh. \"_Senor_, you  have spoiled my day. How can one look at lesser animals when one has seen  such a treasure? _Don_ Cazar, the Range harbors so many treasures--Oro, and  now this one. How is he named, _senor_?\"    \"Shiloh.\"    \"Shiloh ...\" The _Coronel_ made a sibilant hiss of the word. \"An Indio  name?\"    \"No, a battle.\" Drew prepared to lead out. \"In the war.\"    \"So. And this one is a fighter, too. I think. _Senor_, should you ever  wish to sell, _por favor_, remember one Luis Oliveri! For such a horse as  this--_si_, a man might give a fortune! Ah, to ride into camp before that  puffed-up gamecock of a Merinda on such a horse!\" Oliveri closed his eyes  as if better to imagine the triumph.    \"Shiloh's not for sale, _Coronel_,\" Drew replied.    Oliveri shrugged. \"Perhaps now, no. But time changes and chance changes,  _senor_. So remember Luis Oliveri will give a fortune--and this is the  truth, _senor_!\"    \"Hunt!\" Drew was forced to halt as Johnny Shannon stood straight ahead of  him in the stable entrance. \"Teodoro Trinfan's come in with some news you  oughta hear.\"    \"So? Well. I'm coming. _Coronel_, Johnny can show you the stock we have  ready. I will be back as soon as I can.\"    \"Still I say\"--Oliveri shook his head as Rennie pushed past Drew and Shiloh  and went out--\"that after seeing this one, all others will be as pale  shadows of nothingness. But since I must have horses, _Senor_ Shannon, I  will look at horses. _Buenos dias, senor._\" He raised a hand to Drew and  the Kentuckian nodded.    But Shannon still stood in the doorway, and short of walking straight into  him there was no way for Drew to leave. Johnny was smiling a little--just  as he had back in Tubacca in Topham's office before the race.    \"Seems like you've got you a four-legged gold mine there, Kirby,\" he said.  \"Better keep your eyes peeled--gold claims have been jumped before in this  country. Kitchell'd give a lot to git a hoss like that to run south.\"    \"He'd have to,\" Drew said grimly. \"In lead--if he wanted it that way.\"    \"Kinda sure of that, ain't you?\" The smile had not cracked, nor had it  reached those shuttered blue eyes. Why did everyone say Johnny Shannon was  a boy? Inside he was older than most of the men Drew had known--as old and  cold as the desert rocks in nighttime. Again the Kentuckian was teased by  a scrap of memory. Once before he had seen old eyes in a boy's face, when  it had meant deadly danger for him.    \"When a man has somethin' as belongs to him, he doesn't step aside easy if  another makes a play to grab it,\" he said.    For the first time then he did see a flicker in Shannon's eyes. And his  hand tightened so on the reins that some fraction of his reaction must  have reached Shiloh. The horse neighed, pawed with a forefoot.    \"Just what I've always thought, too, Kirby.\" Shannon's voice was softer,  more drawling than ever. And there was menace in it--but why? What did  Shannon have against him? This was more now than the fact that they had  both bristled, incompatible, at their first meeting. It was more than just  instinctive dislike. No, Johnny Shannon was not a reckless boy; Drew Kirby  knew that, if no one else on the Range did.    \"_Coronel_\"--Shannon stepped aside from the door--\"we may not be able to git  you somethin' as fine as this here prancer, but we ain't altogether  lackin' in mighty good hosses. Come 'long an' look 'em over....\"    Drew rode off, out of the patio gate, giving Shiloh his daily workout,  trying to guess what Johnny Shannon had against him. Had he been right in  his fear that Johnny had not been unconscious back in Tubacca, that he had  caught Anse's greeting? Rennie was not too common a name, but he did not  see how Johnny could possibly have hit upon the truth.    What if he had, though? To Johnny, Drew could loom as a threat. He might  be baffled as to why the Kentuckian had not made a move to claim kinship  with Hunt. How much of Rennie's own past history was known to the people  here? His escape from prison during the Mexican War was common knowledge.  But, come to think of it, no one had mentioned his youthful marriage or  the fact that he was a widower. Perhaps even Johnny had never heard that  story, close to Hunt as he was. But Drew dared ask no questions.    He was still puzzling over the situation when he returned an hour later.  Nye, Anse, and a couple of the other riders had some of the recently  broken mounts out, showing them off to Oliveri. There was shouting, noise,  and confusion around the corrals and Drew slipped past without pausing. He  had finished with Shiloh and was on his way to the bunkhouse when Hunt  Rennie hailed him.    \"Drew!\" An imperative wave of the hand brought him to join _Don_ Cazar and  to discover Anse already there, rolling his bed. For a second or two Drew  blinked--the occupation fitted in too well with their worries of the night  before. But Hunt Rennie was already explaining.    \"Teodoro tells me that they've found traces of shod horses being driven  back in the canyons. This late the grass is beginning to brown, but there  are still some sections where stock can be wintered. I want to know more  about this. Since both of you are newcomers--\" Rennie paused and then  added: \"Your riding away from here might appear to others that you had  quit, were joining up with the mustangers on your own.\"    \"To hunt horses?\" Drew asked.    \"Not wild ones.\"    \"Sounds like trouble.\""]]]
