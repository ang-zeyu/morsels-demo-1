A few  rare inscriptions stamped on bricks, one or two letters or documents of  private interest, and some minor objects from widely distant spots, have  enabled us to ascertain the sites upon which these sovereigns erected  buildings; Karaindash restored the temple of Nana at Uruk, Burnaburiash  and Kurigalzu added to that of Shamash at Larsam, and Kurigalzu took in  hand that of Sin at Uru. We also possess a record of some of their acts  in the fragments of a document, which a Mnevite scribe of the time of  Assurbanipal had compiled, or rather jumbled together,* from certain  Babylonian chronicles dealing with the wars against Assyria and Elam,  with public treaties, marriages, and family quarrels. We learn from  this, for example, that Burnaburiash I. renewed with Buzurassur the  conventions drawn up between Karaindash and Assurbelnishishu. These  friendly relations were maintained, apparently, under Kurigalzu I.  and Assur-nadin-akhi, the son of Buzurassur;** if Kurigalzu built or  restored the fortress, long called after him Dur-Kurigalzu,*** at one  of the fords of the Narmalka, it was probably as a precautionary measure  rather than because of any immediate danger. The relations between  the two powers became somewhat strained when Burnaburiash II.  and Assuruballit had respectively succeeded to Kurigalzu and  Assur-nadin-akhi; **** this did not, however, lead to hostilities, and  the subsequent betrothal of Karakhardash, son of Burnaburiash II., to  Mubauitatserua, daughter of Assuruballit, tended to restore matters to  their former condition.         * This is what is generally called the \"Synchronous       History,\" the principal remains of which were discovered and       published by H. Rawlinson. It is a very unskilful       complication, in which Winckler has discovered several       blunders.         ** Assur-nadin-akhi I. is mentioned in a Tel el-Amarna       tablet as being the father of Assuruballit.         *** This is the present Akerkuf, as is proved by the       discovery of bricks bearing the name of Kurigalzu; but       perhaps what I have attributed to Kurigalzu I. must be       referred to the second king of that name.         **** We infer this from the way in which Burnaburiash speaks       of the Assyrians in the correspondence with Amenothes IV.    The good will between the two countries became still more pronounced  when Kadashmankharbe succeeded his father Karakhardash. The Cossaean  soldiery had taken umbrage at his successor and had revolted,  assassinated Kadashmankharbe, and proclaimed king in his stead a man  of obscure origin named Nazibugash. Assuruballit, without a moment's  hesitation, took the side of his new relatives; he crossed the frontier,  killed Nazibugash, and restored the throne to his sister's child,  Kurigalzu II., the younger. The young king, who was still a minor at  his accession, appears to have met with no serious difficulties; at any  rate, none were raised by his Assyrian cousins, Belnirari I. and his  successor Budilu.*         * The _Synchronous History_ erroneously places the events of       the reign of Ramman-nirari in that of Belnirari. The order       of succession of Buzurassur, Assuruballit, Belnirari, and       Budilu, has been established by the bricks of Kalah-Shergat.    Towards the close of his reign, however, revolts broke out, and it was  only by sustained efforts that he was able to restore order in Babylon,  Sippara, and the Country of the Sea. While the king was in the midst of  these difficulties, the Elamites took advantage of his troubles to  steal from him a portion of his territory, and their king, Khurbatila,  challenged him to meet his army near Dur-Dungi. Kurigalzu accepted the  challenge, gained a decisive victory, took his adversary prisoner, and  released him only on receiving as ransom a province beyond the Tigris;  he even entered Susa, and, from among other trophies of past wars,  resumed possession of an agate tablet belonging to Dungi, which the  veteran Kudurnakhunta had stolen from the temple of Nipur nearly  a thousand years previously. This victory was followed by the  congratulations of most of his neighbours, with the exception of  Bamman-nirari II., who had succeeded Budilu in Assyria, and probably  felt some jealousy or uneasiness at the news. He attacked the Cossaeans,  and overthrew them at Sugagi, on the banks of the Salsallat; their  losses were considerable, and Kurigalzu could only obtain peace by the  cession to Assyria of a strip of territory the entire length of the  north-west frontier, from the confines of the Shubari country, near  the sources of the Khabur, to the suburbs of Babylon itself. Nearly the  whole of Mesopotamia thus changed hands at one stroke, but Babylon had  still more serious losses to suffer. Nazimaruttash, who attempted to  wipe out the disaster sustained by his father Kurigalzu, experienced two  crushing defeats, one at Kar-Ishtar and the other near Akarsallu, and  the treaty which he subsequently signed was even more humiliating for  his country than the preceding one. All that part of the Babylonian  domain which lay nearest to Nineveh was ceded to the Assyrians, from  Pilaski on the right bank of the Tigris to the province of Lulume in  the Zagros mountains. It would appear that the Cossaean tribes who had  remained in their native country, took advantage of these troublous  times to sever all connection with their fellow-countrymen established  in the cities of the plain; for we find them henceforward carrying on a  petty warfare for their own profit, and leading an entirely independent  life. The descendants of Gandish, deprived of territories in the north,  repulsed in the east, and threatened in the south by the nations of  the Persian Gulf, never recovered their former ascendency, and their  authority slowly declined during the century which followed these  events. Their downfall brought about the decadence of the cities over  which they had held sway; and the supremacy which Babylon had exercised  for a thousand years over the countries of the Euphrates passed into the  hands of the Assyrian kings.    Assyria itself was but a poor and insignificant country when compared  with her rival. It occupied, on each side of the middle course of the  Tigris, the territory lying between the 35th and 37th parallels of  latitude.*         * These are approximately the limits of the first Assyrian       empire, as given by the monuments; from the Persian epoch       onwards, the name was applied to the whole course of the       Tigris as far as the mountain district. The ancient       orthography of the name is Aushar.    It was bounded on the east by the hills and mountain ranges running  parallel to the Zagros Chain--Gebel Guar, Gebel Gara, Zerguizavan-dagh,  and Baravan-dagh, with their rounded monotonous limestone ridges, scored  by watercourses and destitute of any kind of trees. On the north it  was hemmed in by the spurs of the Masios, and bounded on the east by an  undefined line running from Mount Masios to the slopes of Singar,  and from these again to the Chaldaean plain; to the south the frontier  followed the configuration of the table-land and the curve of the low  cliffs, which in prehistoric times had marked the limits of the Persian  Gulf; from here the boundary was formed on the left side of the Tigris  by one of its tributaries, either the Lower Zab or the Badanu. The  territory thus enclosed formed a compact and healthy district: it was  free from extremes of temperature arising from height or latitude, and  the relative character and fertility of its soil depended on the absence  or presence of rivers. The eastern part of Assyria was well watered by  the streams and torrents which drained the Iranian plateau and the lower  mountain chains which ran parallel to it. The beds of these rivers are  channelled so deeply in the alluvial soil, that it is necessary to stand  on the very edge of their banks to catch a sight of their silent and  rapid waters; and it is only in the spring or early summer, when they  are swollen by the rains and melting snow, that they spread over the  adjacent country. As soon as the inundation is over, a vegetation of the  intensest green springs up, and in a few days the fields and meadows are  covered with a luxuriant and fragrant carpet of verdure. This brilliant  growth is, however, short-lived, for the heat of the sun dries it up as  quickly as it appears, and even the corn itself is in danger of being  burnt up before reaching maturity. To obviate such a disaster, the  Assyrians had constructed a network of canals and ditches, traces of  which are in many places still visible, while a host of _shadufs_  placed along their banks facilitated irrigation in the dry seasons. The  provinces supplied with water in this manner enjoyed a fertility which  passed into a proverb, and was well known among the ancients; they  yielded crops of cereals which rivalled those of Babylonia, and included  among their produce wheat, barley, millet, and sesame. But few olive  trees were cultivated, and the dates were of inferior quality; indeed,  in the Greek period, these fruits were only used for fattening pigs and  domestic animals. The orchards contained the pistachio, the apple, the  pomegranate, the apricot, the vine, the almond, and the fig, and, in  addition to the essences common to both Syria and Egypt, the country  produced cedrats of a delicious scent which were supposed to be an  antidote to all kinds of poisons. Assyria was not well wooded, except in  the higher valleys, where willows and poplars bordered the rivers, and  sycamores, beeches, limes, and plane trees abounded,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17327"],[0,"History of Egypt, Chald√¶a, Syria, Babylonia, and Assyria, Volume 7 (of 12) (#20)"],[1," Kcrak, the Krak of       mediaeval times.         ** The account of the campaign (2 Kings iii. 8-27) belongs       to the prophetic cycle of Elisha, and seems to give merely a       popular version of the event. A king of Edom is mentioned       (9-10, 12-13), while elsewhere, under Jehoshaphat, it is       stated \"there was no king in Edom\" (1 Kings xxii. 47); the       geography also of the route taken by the expedition is       somewhat confused. Finally, the account of the siege of Kir-       hareseth is mutilated, and the compiler has abridged the       episode of the human sacrifice, as being too conducive to       the honour of Chemosh and to the dishonour of Jahveh. The       main facts of the account are correct, but the details are       not clear, and do not all bear the stamp of veracity.         *** This is the famous Moabite Stone or stele of Dhibon,       discovered by Clermont-Ganneau in 1868, and now preserved in       the Louvre.    [Illustration: 123.jpg THE MOABITE STONE OF STELE OF MESHA]         From a photograph by Faucher-Gudin, retouched by Massias       from the original in the Louvre. The fainter parts of the       stele are the portions restored in the original.    He still feared a repetition of the invasion, but this misfortune was  spared him; Jehoshaphat was gathered to his fathers,* and his Edomite  subjects revolted on receiving the news of his death. Jeho--his son and  successor, at once took up arms to bring them to a sense of their duty;  but they surrounded his camp, and it was with difficulty that he cut his  way through their ranks and escaped during the night.         * The date of the death of Jehoshaphat may be fixed as 849       or 848 B.C. The biblical documents give us for the period of       the history of Judah following on the death of Ahab: First,       eight years of Jehoshaphat, from the 17th year of his reign       (1 Kings xxii. 51) to his 25th (and last) year (1 Kings       xxii. 42); secondly, eight years of Jehoram, son of       Jehoshaphat (2 Kings viii. 17); thirdly, one year of       Ahaziah, son of Jehoram (2 Kings viii. 26)--in all 17 years,       which must be reduced and condensed into the period between       853 B.C., the probable date of the battle of Ramoth, and       843, the equally probable date of the accession of Jehu. The       reigns of the two Ahaziahs are too short to be further       abridged; we must therefore place the campaign against Moab       at the earliest in 850, during the months which followed the       accession of Joram of Israel, and lengthen Johoshaphat's       reign from 850 to 849. There will then be room between 849       and 844 for five years (instead of eight) for the reign of       Jehoram of Judah.    The defection of the old Canaanite city of Libnah followed quickly on  this reverse,* and Jehoram was powerless to avenge himself on it, the  Philistines and the Bedawin having threatened the western part of his  territory and raided the country.** In the midst of these calamities  Judah had no leisure to take further measures against Mesha, and Israel  itself had suffered too severe a blow to attempt retaliation. The  advanced age of Ben-hadad, and the unsatisfactory result of the  campaigns against Shalmaneser, had furnished Joram with an occasion for  a rupture with Damascus. War dragged on for some time apparently, till  the tide of fortune turned against Joram, and, like his father Ahab in  similar circumstances, he shut himself within Samaria, where the false  alarm of an Egyptian or Hittite invasion produced a panic in the Syrian  camp, and restored the fortunes of the Israelitish king.***         * 2 Kings viii. 20-22; cf. 2 Ghron. xxi. 8-10.         ** This war is mentioned only in 2 Ghron. xxi. 16, 17, where       it is represented as a chastisement from Jahveh; the       Philistines and \"the Arabs which are beside the Ethiopians\"       (Kush) seem to have taken Jerusalem, pillaged the palace,       and carried away the wives and children of the king into       captivity, \"so that there was never a son left him, save       Jehoahaz (Ahaziah), the youngest of his sons.\"         *** Kuenen has proposed to take the whole account of the       reign of Joram, son of Ahab, and transfer it to that of       Jehoahaz, son of Jehu, and this theory has been approved by       several recent critics and historians. On the other hand,       some have desired to connect it with the account of the       siege of Samaria in Ahab's reign. I fail to see any       reasonable argument which can be brought against the       authenticity of the main fact, whatever opinion may be held       with regard to the details of the biblical narrative.    Ben-hadad did not long survive the reverse he had experienced; he  returned sick and at the point of death to Damascus, where he was  assassinated by Hazael, one of his captains. Hebrew tradition points to  the influence of the prophets in all these events. The aged Elijah had  disappeared, so ran the story, caught up to heaven in a chariot of fire,  but his mantle had fallen on Elisha, and his power still survived in  his disciple. From far and near Elisha's counsel was sought, alike by  Gentiles as by the followers of the true God; whether the suppliant was  the weeping Shunamite mourning for the loss of her only son, or Naaman  the captain of the Damascene chariotry, he granted their petitions, and  raised the child from its bed, and healed the soldier of his leprosy.  During the siege of Samaria, he had several times frustrated the enemy's  designs, and had predicted to Joram not only the fact but the hour of  deliverance, and the circumstances which would accompany it. Ben-hadad  had sent Hazael to the prophet to ask him if he should recover, and  Elisha had wept on seeing the envoy--\"Because I know the evil that thou  wilt do unto the children of Israel; their strongholds wilt thou set on  fire, and their young men wilt thou slay with the sword, and wilt dash  in pieces their little ones, and rip up their women with child. And  Hazael said, But what is thy servant which is but a dog, that he should  do this great thing? And Elisha answered, The Lord hath showed me that  thou shalt be king over Syria.\" On returning to Damascus Hazael gave the  results of his mission in a reassuring manner to Ben-hadad, but \"on the  morrow... he took the coverlet and dipped it in water, and spread it on  his face, so that he died.\"    The deed which deprived it of its king^ seriously affected Damascus  itself. It was to Ben-hadad that it owed most of its prosperity; he it  was who had humiliated Hamath and the princes of the coast of Arvad, and  the nomads of the Arabian desert. He had witnessed the rise of the  most energetic of all the Israelite dynasties, and he had curbed its  ambition; Omri had been forced to pay him tribute; Ahab, Ahaziah, and  Joram had continued it; and Ben-hadad's suzerainty, recognised more or  less by their vassals, had extended through Moab and Judah as far as the  Bed Sea. Not only had he skilfully built up this fabric of vassal states  which made him lord of two-thirds of Syria, but he had been able to  preserve it unshaken for a quarter of a century, in spite of  rebellions in several of his fiefs and reiterated attacks from Assyria;  Shalmaneser, indeed, had made an attack on his line, but without  breaking through it, and had at length left him master of the field.  This superiority, however, which no reverse could shake, lay in himself  and in himself alone; no sooner had he passed away than it suddenly  ceased, and Hazael found himself restricted from the very outset to the  territory of Damascus proper.* Hamath, Arvad, and the northern peoples  deserted the league, to return to it no more; Joram of Israel called on  his nephew Ahaziah, who had just succeeded to Jehoram of Judah, and both  together marched to besiege Bamoth.         * From this point onward, the Assyrian texts which mentioned       _the twelve kings of the Khati_, Irkhulini of Hamath and       Adadidri (Ben-hadad) of Damascus, now only name _Khazailu of       the country of Damascus_.    The Israelites were not successful in their methods of carrying on  sieges; Joram, wounded in a skirmish, retired to his palace at Jezreel,  where Ahaziah joined him a few days later, on the pretext of inquiring  after his welfare. The prophets of both kingdoms and their followers  had never forgiven the family of Ahab their half-foreign extraction, nor  their eclecticism in the matter of religion. They had numerous partisans  in both armies, and a conspiracy was set on foot against the absent  sovereigns; Elisha, judging the occasion to be a propitious one,  despatched one of his disciples to the camp with secret instructions.  The generals were all present at a banquet, when the messenger arrived;  he took one of them, Jehu, the son of Nimshi, on one side, anointed  him, and then escaped. Jehu returned, and seated himself amongst his  fellow-officers, who, unsuspicious of what had happened, questioned him  as to the errand. \"Is all well? Wherefore came this mad fellow to thee?  And he said unto them, Ye know the man and what his talk was. And they  said, It is false; tell us now. And he said, Thus and thus spake he to  me, saying, Thus saith the Lord, I have anointed thee king over Israel.  Then they hasted, and took every man his garment and put it under him on  the top of the stairs, and blew the trumpet, saying, Jehu is king.\"  He at once marched on Jezreel, and the two kings, surprised at this  movement, went out to meet him with scarcely any escort. The two parties  had hardly met when Joram asked, \"Is it peace, Jehu?\" to which Jehu  replied, \"What peace, so long as the whoredoms of thy mother Jezebel and  her witchcrafts are so many?\" Whereupon Joram turned rein, crying to  his nephew, \"There is treachery, O Ahaziah.\" But an arrow pierced him  through the heart, and he fell forward in his chariot."]]]
