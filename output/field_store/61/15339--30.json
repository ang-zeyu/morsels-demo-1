But she  said that she liked her own free life best, only she would never go far  away and would come often to see Dot. At sunset she said good-bye to  Dot, a little sadly, and the child stood in the rosy light of the  afterglow, waving her hand, as she saw her kind animal friend hop away  and disappear into the dark shadow of the Bush.    She wandered about for some time listening to the voices of birds and  creatures, who came to tell her how glad everyone was that her way had  been found, and that no harm was to befall them in future. The news of  her safe return, and of the Kangaroo's finding her Joey, had been spread  far and near, by Willy Wagtail and the Kookooburra; and she could hear  the shouts of laughter from kookooburras telling the story until nearly  dark.    Quite late at night she was visited by the Opossum, the Native Bear,  and the Nightjar, who entered by the open window, and, sitting in the  moonlight, conversed about the day's events. They said that their whole  rest and sleep had been disturbed by the noise and excitement of the day  creatures spreading the news through the Bush. The Mo-poke wished to  sing a sad song because Dot was feeling happy, but the Opossum warned it  that it was sitting in a draught on the window sill and might spoil its  beautiful voice, so it flew away and only sang in the distance. The  Native Bear said that the story of Dot's return and the finding of  Kangaroo's Joey was so strange that it made its head feel quite empty.  The Opossum inspected everything in Dot's room, and tried to fight  itself in the looking-glass. It then got the Koala to look into the  mirror also, and said it would get an idea into its little empty head if  it did. When the Koala had taken a timid peep at itself, the Opossum  said that the Koala now had an idea of how stupid it looked, and the  little bear went off to get used to having an idea in its head. The  Opossum was so pleased with its spiteful joke that it hastily said good  night, and hurried away to tell it to the other 'possums.    Gradually the voices of the creatures outside became more and more faint  and indistinct; and then Dot slept in the grey light of the dawn.    When she went out in the morning, the kookooburras were gurgling and  laughing, the magpies were warbling, the parrakeets made their  twittering, and Willy Wagtail was most lively; but Dot was astonished to  find that she could not understand what any of the creatures said,  although they were all very friendly towards her. When the Kangaroo came  to see her she made signs that she wanted some berries of understanding,  but, strange as it may seem, the Kangaroo pretended not to understand.  Dot has often wondered why the Kangaroo would not understand, but,  remembering what that considerate animal had said when she first gave  her the berries, she is inclined to think that the Kangaroo is afraid of  her learning too much, and thereby getting indigestion. Dot and her  parents have often sought for the berries, but up to now they have  failed to find them. There is something very mysterious about those  berries!    During that day every creature Dot had known in the Bush came to see  her, for they all knew that their lives were safe now, so they were not  afraid. It greatly surprised Dot's parents to see such numbers of birds  and animals coming around their little girl, and they thought it very  pretty when in the evening a flock of Native Companions settled down,  and danced their graceful dance with the little girl joining in the  game.    \"It seems to me, wife,\" said Dot's father with a glad laugh, \"that the  place has become a regular menagerie!\"    [Illustration: BY THE LAKE (EVENING)]    Later on, Dot's father made a dam on a hollow piece of ground near the  house, which soon became full of water, and is surrounded by beautiful  willow trees. There all the thirsty creatures come to drink in safety.  And very pretty it is, to sit on the verandah of that happy home, and  see Dot playing near the water surrounded by her Bush friends, who come  and go as they please, and play with the little girl beside the pretty  lake. And no one in all the Gabblebabble district hurts a bush creature,  because they are all called \"Dot's friends.\"           *       *       *       *       *          FINALE.      Before putting away the pen and closing the inkstand, now that Dot has  said all she wishes to be recorded of her bewildering adventures, the  writer would like to warn little people, that the best thing to do when  one is lost in the bush, is to sit still in one place, and not to try to  find one's way home at all. If Dot had done this, and had not gone off  in the Kangaroo's pouch, she would have been found almost directly. As  the more one tries to find one's way home, the more one gets lost, and  as helpful Kangaroos like Dot's are very scarce, the best way to get  found quickly, is to wait in one place until the search parties find  one. Don't forget this advice! And don't eat any strange berries in the  bush, unless a Kangaroo brings them to you.           *       *       *       *       *          W. C. Penfold & Co.

In addition, Fortune smiled upon him as upon a favorite child.  Trained in mind and hand he lived for ninety-nine years and worked  unceasingly up to a few months of his death. His genius was great and  his accomplishment equally so. He was celebrated and independent at  thirty-five, though before that he showed something of the influence  of Giorgione. After the death of Giorgione and his master, Bellini,  Titian was the leader in Venice to the end of his long life, and  though having few scholars of importance his influence was spread  through all North Italian painting.    Taking him for all in all, perhaps it is not too much to say that he  was the greatest painter known to history. If it were possible to  describe that greatness in one word, that word would be  \"universality.\" He saw and painted that which was universal in its  truth. The local and particular, the small and the accidental, were  passed over for those great truths which belong to all the world of  life. In this respect he was a veritable Shakespeare, with all the  calmness and repose of one who overlooked the world from a lofty  height.    [Illustration: FIG. 49.--TINTORETTO. MERCURY AND GRACES. DUCAL PAL.,  VENICE.]    The restfulness and easy strength of Titian were not characteristics  of his follower Tintoretto (1518-1592). He was violent, headlong,  impulsive, more impetuous than Michael Angelo, and in some respects a  strong reminder of him. He had not Michael Angelo's austerity, and  there was more clash and tumult and fire about him, but he had a  command of line like the Florentine, and a way of hurling things, as  seen in the Fall of the Damned, that reminds one of the Last Judgment  of the Sistine. It was his aim to combine the line of Michael Angelo  and the color of Titian; but without reaching up to either of his  models he produced a powerful amalgam of his own.    He was one of the very great artists of the world, and the most rapid  workman in the whole Renaissance period. There are to-day, after  centuries of decay, fire, theft, and repainting, yards upon yards of  Tintoretto's canvases rotting upon the walls of the Venetian churches.  He produced an enormous amount of work, and, what is to be regretted,  much of it was contract work or experimental sketching. This has given  his art a rather bad name, but judged by his best works in the Ducal  Palace and the Academy at Venice, he will not be found lacking. Even  in his masterpiece (The Miracle of the Slave) he is \"Il Furioso,\" as  they used to call him; but his thunderbolt style is held in check by  wonderful grace, strength of modelling, superb contrasts of light with  shade, and a coloring of flesh and robes not unworthy of the very  greatest. He was a man who worked in the white heat of passion, with  much imagination and invention. As a technician he sought difficulties  rather than avoided them. There is some antagonism between form and  color, but Tintoretto tried to reconcile them. The result was  sometimes clashing, but no one could have done better with them than  he did. He was a fine draughtsman, a good colorist, and a master of  light. As a brushman he was a superior man, but not equal to Titian.    Paolo Veronese (1528-1588), the fourth great Venetian, did not follow  the line direction set by Tintoretto, but carried out the original  color-leaning of the school. He came a little later than Tintoretto,  and his art was a reflection of the advancing Renaissance, wherein  simplicity was destined to lose itself in complexity, grandeur, and  display. Paolo came on the very crest of the Renaissance wave, when  art, risen to its greatest height, was gleaming in that transparent  splendor that precedes the fall.    [Illustration: FIG. 50.--P. VERONESE. VENICE ENTHRONED. DUCAL PAL.,  VENICE.]    The great bulk of his work had a large decorative motive behind it.  Almost all of the late Venetian work was of that character. Hence it  was brilliant in color, elaborate in subject, and grand in scale.  Splendid robes, hangings, furniture, architecture, jewels, armor,  appeared everywhere, and not in flat, lustreless hues, but with that  brilliancy which they possess in nature. Drapery gave way to clothing,  and texture-painting was introduced even in the largest canvases.  Scenes from Scripture and legend turned into grand pageants of  Venetian glory, and the facial expression of the characters rather  passed out in favor of telling masses of color to be seen at a  distance upon wall or ceiling. It was pomp and glory carried to the  highest pitch, but with all seriousness of mood and truthfulness in  art. It was beyond Titian in variety, richness, ornament, facility;  but it was perhaps below Titian in sentiment, sobriety, and depth of  insight. Titian, with all his sensuous beauty, did appeal to the  higher intelligence, while Paolo and his companions appealed more  positively to the eye by luxurious color-setting and magnificence of  invention. The decadence came after Paolo, but not with him. His art  was the most gorgeous of the Venetian school, and by many is ranked  the highest of all, but perhaps it is better to say it was the height.  Those who came after brought about the decline by striving to imitate  his splendor, and thereby falling into extravagance.    These are the four great Venetians--the men of first rank. Beside them  and around them were many other painters, placed in the second rank,  who in any other time or city would have held first place. Palma il  Vecchio (1480?-1528) was so excellent in many ways that it seems  unjust to speak of him as a secondary painter. He was not, however, a  great original mind, though in many respects a perfect painter. He was  influenced by Bellini at first, and then by Giorgione. In subject  there was nothing dramatic about him, and he carries chiefly by his  portrayal of quiet, dignified, and beautiful Venetians under the names  of saints and holy families. The St. Barbara is an example of this,  and one of the most majestic figures in all painting.    [Illustration: FIG. 51.--LOTTO. THREE AGES. PITTI.]    Palma's friend and fellow-worker, Lorenzo Lotto (1480?-1556?) came  from the school of the Bellini, and at different times was under the  influence of several Venetian painters--Palma, Giorgione,  Titian--without obliterating a sensitive individuality of his own. He  was a somewhat mannered but very charming painter, and in portraits  can hardly be classed below Titian. Rocco Marconi (fl. 1505-1520) was  another Bellini-educated painter, showing the influence of Palma and  even of Paris Bordone. In color and landscape he was excellent.  Pordenone (1483-1540) rather followed after Giorgione, and  unsuccessfully competed with Titian. He was inclined to exaggeration  in dramatic composition, but was a painter of undeniable power.  Cariani (1480-1541) was another Giorgione follower. Bonifazio Pitati  probably came from a Veronese family. He showed the influence of  Palma, and was rather deficient in drawing, though exceedingly  brilliant and rich in coloring. This latter may be said for Paris  Bordone (1495-1570), a painter of Titian's school, gorgeous in color,  but often lacking in truth of form. His portraits are very fine.  Another painter family, the Bassani--there were six of them, of whom  Jacopo Bassano (1510-1592) and his son Francesco Bassano (1550-1591),  were the most noted--formed themselves after Venetian masters, and  were rather remarkable for violent contrasts of light and dark,  _genre_ treatment of sacred subjects, and still-life and animal  painting.    PAINTING IN VENETIAN TERRITORIES: Venetian painting was not confined to  Venice, but extended through all the Venetian territories in Renaissance  times, and those who lived away from the city were, in their art,  decidedly Venetian, though possessing local characteristics.    At Brescia Savoldo (1480?-1548), a rather superficial painter, fond of  weird lights and sheeny draperies, and Romanino (1485?-1566), a  follower of Giorgione, good in composition but unequal and careless in  execution, were the earliest of the High Renaissance men. Moretto  (1498?-1555) was the strongest and most original, a man of  individuality and power, remarkable technically for his delicacy and  unity of color under a veil of \"silvery tone.\" In composition he was  dignified and noble, and in brush-work simple and direct. One of the  great painters of the time, he seemed to stand more apart from  Venetian influence than any other on Venetian territory. He left one  remarkable pupil, Moroni (fl. 1549-1578) whose portraits are to-day  the gems of several galleries, and greatly admired for their modern  spirit and treatment.    At Verona Caroto and Girolamo dai Libri (1474-1555), though living  into the sixteenth century were more allied to the art of the  fifteenth century. Torbido (1486?-1546?) was a vacillating painter,  influenced by Liberale da Verona, Giorgione, Bonifazio Veronese, and  later, even by Giulio Romano. Cavazzola (1486-1522) was more original,  and a man of talent. There were numbers of other painters scattered  all through the Venetian provinces at this time, but they were not of  the first, or even the second rank, and hence call for no mention  here.
