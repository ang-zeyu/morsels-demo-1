And if they were watchdogs--whom did they serve? He was  inclined to believe that the aliens must be their masters, that the  monsters had been guardians of the treasure, perhaps. But dead  guardians suggested a rifled treasure house. Who and what--?    His mind filled with speculations and questions, Raf trotted behind  the others back to the chamber where they had found the first reptile.  The alien who had brought the discovery to his commander stepped  gingerly through the litter and laid the white rod in a special spot,  apparently the place where it had been found.    At a barked order from the officer, two of the others came forward and  tugged at the creature's mangled head, which had been freed from the  serpent neck, rolling it over to expose the underparts. There was a  broad tear there in the flesh, but Raf could see little difference  between it and those left by the feasters. However the officer,  holding a strip of cloth over his nose, bent stiffly above it for a  closer look and then made some statement which sent his command into a  babbling clamor.    Four of the lower ranks separated from the group and, with their hand  weapons at alert, swung into action, retracing the way back toward the  arena. It looked to Raf as if they now expected an attack from that  direction.    Under a volley of orders the rest went back to the storeroom, and the  officer, noting that Raf still lingered, waved him impatiently after  them.    Inside the men spread out, going from shelf to table, selecting things  with a speed which suggested that they had been rehearsed in this task  and had only a limited time in which to accomplish it. Some took piles  of boxes or other containers which were so light that they could  manage a half-dozen in an armload, while two or three others struggled  pantingly to move a single piece of weird machinery from its bed to  the wheeled trolley they had brought. There was to be no lingering on  this job--that was certain.          11    ESPIONAGE      Intent upon joining Sssuri, Dalgard left the lock, forgetting his  earlier unwillingness, stepping from the small chamber down to the sea  bottom, or endeavoring to, although instinctively he had begun to swim  and so forged ahead at a different rate of speed.    Waving fronds of giant water plants, such as were found only in the  coastal shallows, grew forest fashion but did not hide rocks which  stretched up in a sharp rise not too far ahead. The scout could not  see the merman, but as he held onto one of those fronds he caught the  other's summons:    \"Here--by the rocks--!\"    Pushing his way through the drifting foliage, Dalgard swam ahead to  the foot of the rocky escarpment. And there he saw what had so excited  his companion.    Sssuri had just driven away an encircling collection of sand-dwelling  scavengers, and what he was on his knees studying intently was an  almost clean-picked skeleton of one of his own race. But there was  something odd--Dalgard brushed aside a tendril of weed which cut his  line of vision and so was able to see clearly.    White and clean most of those bones were, but the skull was blackened,  and similar charring existed down one arm and shoulder. That merman  had not died from any mishap in the sea!    \"It is so,\" Sssuri replied to his thought. \"_They_ have come once more  to give the flaming death--\"    Dalgard, startled, looked up that slope which must lead to the island  top above the waves.    \"Long dead?\" he asked tentatively, already guessing what the other's  answer would be.    \"The pickers move fast,\" Sssuri indicated the sand dwellers. \"Perhaps  yesterday, perhaps the day before--but no longer than that.\"    \"And _they_ are up there now?\"    \"Who can tell? However, _they_ do not know the sea, nor the islands--\"    It was plain that the merman intended to climb to investigate what  might be happening above. Dalgard had no choice but to follow. And it  was true that the merpeople had no peers or equals when it came to  finding their ways about the sea and the coasts. He was confident that  Sssuri could get to the island top and discover just what he wished to  learn without a single sentry above, if they had stationed sentries,  being the wiser. Whether he himself could operate as efficiently was  another matter.    In the end they half climbed, half swam upward, detouring swiftly once  to avoid the darting attack of a rock hornet, harmless as soon as they  moved out of the reach of its questing stinger, for it was anchored  for its short life to the rough hollow in which it had been hatched.    Dalgard's head broke water as he rolled through the surf onto a scrap  of beach in the lee of a row of tooth-pointed outcrops. It was late  evening by the light, and he clawed the mask off his face to draw  thankful lungfuls of the good outer air. Sssuri, his fur sleeked tight  to his body, waded ashore, shook himself free of excess water, and  turned immediately to study the wall of the cliff which guarded the  interior of the island.    This was one of a chain of such isles, Dalgard noted, now that he had  had time to look about him. And with their many-creviced walls they  were just the type of habitations which appealed most strongly to the  merpeople. Here could be found the dry inner caves with underwater  entrances, which they favored for their group homes. And in the sea  were kelp beds for harvesting.    The cliffs did not present too much of a climbing problem. Dalgard  divested himself of the diving equipment, tucking it into a hollow  which he walled up with stones that he thought the waves would not  scour out in a hurry. He might need it again. Then, hitching his belt  tighter, pressing what water he could out of his clothing, and  settling his bow and quiver to the best advantage at his back, he  crossed to where Sssuri was already marking claw holds.    \"We may be seen--\" Dalgard craned his neck, trying to make out details  of what might be waiting above.    The merman shook his head with a quick jerk of negation. \"_They_ are  gone. Behind them remains only death--much death--\" And the bleakness  of his thoughts reached the scout.    Dalgard had known Sssuri since he was a toddler and the other a cub  coming to see the wonders of dry land for the first time. Never,  during all their years of close association since, had he felt in the  other a desolation so great. And to that emotional blast he could make  no answer.    In the twilight, with the last red banners across the sky at their  back, they made the climb. And it was as if the merman had closed off  his mind to his companion. Flesh fingers touched scaled ones as they  moved from one hold to the next, but Sssuri might have been half a  world away for all the communication between them. Never had Dalgard  been so shut out and with that his sensitivity to the night, to the  world about him, was doubly acute.    He realized--and it worried him--that perhaps he had come to depend  too much on Sssuri's superior faculty of communication. It was time  that he tried to use his own weaker powers to the utmost extent. So,  while he climbed, Dalgard sent questing thoughts into the gloom. He  located a nest of duck-dogs, those shy waterline fishers living in  cliff holes. They were harmless and just settling down for the night.  But of higher types of animals from which something might be  learned--hoppers, runners--there were no traces. For all he was able  to pick up, they might be climbing into blank nothingness.    And that in itself was ominous. Normally he should have been able to  mind touch more than duck-dogs. The merpeople lived in peace with most  of the higher fauna of their world, and a colony of hoppers, even a  covey of moth birds, would settle in close by a mer tribe to garner in  the remnants of feasts and for protection from the flying dragons and  the other dangers they must face.    \"_They_ hunt all life,\" the first break in Sssuri's self-absorption  came. \"Where _they_ walk the little, harmless peoples face only death.  And so it has been here.\" He had pulled himself over the rim of the  cliff, and through the dark Dalgard could hear him panting with the  same effort which made his own lungs labor.    Just as the stench of the snake-devil's lair had betrayed its site,  here disaster and death had an odor of its own. Dalgard retched before  he could control throat and stomach muscles. But Sssuri was unmoved,  as if he had expected this.    Then, to Dalgard's surprise the merman set up the first real call he  had ever heard issue from that furred throat, a plaintive whistle  which had a crooning, summoning note in it, akin to the mind touch in  an odd fashion, yet audible. They sat in silence for a long moment,  the human's ears as keen for any sound out of the night as those of  his companion. Why did Sssuri not use the customary noiseless greeting  of his race? When he beamed that inquiry, he met once again that  strange, solid wall of non-acceptance which had enclosed the merman as  they climbed. As if now there was danger to be feared from following  the normal ways.    Again Sssuri whistled, and in that cry Dalgard heard a close  resemblance to the flute tone of the night moth birds. Up the scale  the notes ran with mournful persistence. When the answer came, the  scout at first thought that the imitation had lured a moth bird, for  the reply seemed to ripple right above their heads.    Sssuri stood up, and his hand dropped on Dalgard's shoulder, applying  pressure which was both a warning and a summons, bringing the scout to  his feet with as little noise as possible. The horrible smell caught  at his throat, and he was glad when the merman did not head inland  toward the source of that odor, but started off along the edge of the  cliff, one hand in Dalgard's to draw him along.    Twice more Sssuri paused to whistle, and each time he was answered by"]]]
