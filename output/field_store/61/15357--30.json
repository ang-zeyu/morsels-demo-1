The music in the churches he affirmed not to be the noise of men, but a  bleating of brute beasts; choristers bellow the tenor, as it were oxen;  bark a counterpart, as it were a kennel of dogs; roar out a treble, as  it were a sort of bulls; and grunt out a bass, as it were a number of  hogs: Christmas, as it is kept, is the devil's Christmas: and Prynne  employed a great number of pages to persuade men to affect the name  of \"Puritan,\" as if Christ had been a Puritan; and so he saith in his  index.    This year, Charles made a journey to Scotland, attended by the court,  in order to hold a parliament there, and to pass through the ceremony of  his coronation. The nobility and gentry of both kingdoms rivalled each  other in expressing all duty and respect to the king, and in showing  mutual friendship and regard to each other. No one could have suspected,  from exterior appearances, that such dreadful scenes were approaching.    One chief article of business, (for it deserves the name,) which the  king transacted in this parliament, was, besides obtaining some supply,  to procure authority for ordering the habits of clergymen.[*] The act  did not pass without opposition and difficulty. The dreadful surplice  was before men's eyes, and they apprehended, with some reason, that  under sanction of this law, it would soon be introduced among them.  Though the king believed that his prerogative entitled him to a power,  in general, of directing whatever belonged to the exterior government  of the church, this was deemed a matter of too great importance to be  ordered without the sanction of a particular statute.    Immediately after the king's return to England, he heard of Archbishop  Abbot's death; and, without delay, he conferred that dignity on his  favorite, Laud; who, by this accession of authority, was now enabled to  maintain ecclesiastical discipline with greater rigor, and to aggravate  the general discontent of the nation.    Laud obtained the bishopric of London for his friend Juxon: and, about  a year after the death of Sir Richard Weston, created earl of Portland,  had interest enough to engage the king to make that prelate high  treasurer. Juxon was a person of great integrity, mildness, and  humanity, and endued with a good understanding.[**] Yet did this last  promotion give general offence. His birth and character were deemed too  obscure for a man raised to one of the highest offices of the crown.  And the clergy, it was thought, were already too much elated by former  instances of the king's attachment to them, and needed not this further  encouragement to assume dominion over the laity.[***] The Puritans,  likewise, were much dissatisfied with Juxon, notwithstanding his eminent  virtues, because he was a lover of profane field sports and hunting.         * Bushworth, vol. ii. p. 183.         ** Whitlocke, p. 23.

The first writs of this kind had  been directed to seaport towns only: but ship money was at this time  levied on the whole kingdom; and each county was rated at a particular  sum, which was after wards assessed upon individuals.[*] The amount of  the whole tax was very moderate, little exceeding two hundred thousand  pounds: it was levied upon the people with equality: the money was  entirely expended on the navy, to the great honor and advantage of the  kingdom: as England had no military force, while all the other powers of  Europe were strongly armed, a fleet seemed absolutely necessary for her  security; and it was obvious, that a navy must be built and equipped at  leisure, during peace; nor could it possibly be fitted out on a sudden  emergence, when the danger became urgent; yet all these considerations  could not reconcile the people to the imposition. It was entirely  arbitrary: by the same right any other tax might be imposed: and men  thought a powerful fleet, though very desirable both for the credit and  safety of the kingdom, but an unequal recompense for their liberties,  which, they apprehended, were thus sacrificed to the obtaining of it.    England, it must be owned, was in this respect unhappy in its present  situation, that the king had entertained a very different idea of the  constitution, from that which began in general to prevail among his  subjects. He did not regard national privileges as so sacred and  inviolable, that nothing but the most extreme necessity could justify an  infringement of them. He considered himself as the supreme magistrate,  to whose care Heaven, by his birthright, had committed his people; whose  duty it was to provide for their security and happiness, and who was  vested with ample discretionary powers for that salutary purpose. If the  observance of ancient laws and customs was consistent with the present  convenience of government, he thought himself obliged to comply with  that rule, as the easiest, the safest, and what procured the most prompt  and willing obedience. But when a change of circumstances, especially  if derived from the obstinacy of the people, required a new plan of  administration, national privileges, he thought, must yield to supreme  power; nor could any order of the state oppose any right to the will of  the sovereign, directed to the good of the public.[**]         * Rush. vol. ii. p. 257, 258, etc.         ** Rush. vol. iv p 535, 542.    That these principles of government were derived from the uniform tenor  of the English laws, it would be rash to affirm. The fluctuating nature  of the constitution, the impatient humor of the people, and the variety  of events, had, no doubt, in different ages, produced exceptions and  contradictions. These observations alone may be established on both  sides, that the appearances were sufficiently strong in favor of the  king to apologize for his following such maxims; and that public liberty  must be so precarious under this exorbitant prerogative, as to render an  opposition not only excusable, but laudable in the people.[*] [4]    Some laws had been enacted, during the reign of Henry VII., against  depopulation, or the converting of arable lands into pasture. By a  decree of the star chamber, Sir Anthony Roper was fined four thousand  pounds for an offence of that nature.[**] This severe sentence was  intended to terrify others into composition; and above thirty thousand  pounds were levied by that expedient.[***] Like compositions, or, in  default of them, heavy fines, were required for encroachments on the  king's forests, whose bounds, by decrees deemed arbitrary, were extended  much beyond what was usual.[****] The bounds of one forest, that  of Rockingham, were increased from six miles to sixty.[v] The same  refractory humor which made the people refuse to the king voluntary  supplies, disposed them, with better reason, to murmur against these  irregular methods of taxation.    Morley was fined ten thousand pounds for reviling, challenging, and  striking, in the court of Whitehall, Sir George Theobald, one of the  king's servants.[v*] This fine was thought exorbitant; but whether it  was compounded, as was usual in fines imposed by the star chamber, we  are not informed.         * See note D, at the end of the volume.         ** Rush. vol. ii. p. 270; vol. iii. App. p. 106.         *** Rush. vol. iii. p. 333. Franklyn, p. 478.         **** May, p. 16.         v Strafford's Letters and Despatches, vol. ii. p. 117.         v* Rush. vol. ii. p. 270.    Allison had reported, that the archbishop of York had incurred the  king's displeasure, by asking a limited toleration for the Catholics,  and an allowance to build some churches for the exercise of their  religion. For this slander against the archbishop, he was condemned in  the star chamber to be fined one thousand pounds, to be committed to  prison, to be bound to his good behavior during life, to be whipped,  and to be set on the pillory at Westminster, and in three other towns in  England. Robins, who had been an accomplice in the guilt, was condemned  by a sentence equally severe.[*] Such events are rather to be considered  as rare and detached incidents, collected by the severe scrutiny of  historians, than as proofs of the prevailing genius of the king's  administration which seems to have been more gentle and equitable than,  that of most of his predecessors: there were, on the whole, only five  or six such instances of rigor during the course of fifteen years,  which elapsed before the meeting of the long parliament. And it is also  certain, that scandal against the great, though seldom prosecuted at  present, is, however, in the eye of the law, a great crime, and subjects  the offender to very heavy penalties.    There are other instances of the high respect paid to the nobility and  to the great in that age, when the powers of monarchy, though disputed,  still maintained themselves in their pristine vigor. Clarendon[**] tells  us a pleasant incident to this purpose: a waterman, belonging to a man  of quality, having a squabble with a citizen about his fare, showed his  badge, the crest of his master, which happened to be a swan; and thence  insisted on better treatment from the citizen. But the other replied  carelessly, that he did not trouble his head about that goose. For  this offence, he was summoned before the marshal's court; was fined, as  having opprobriously defamed the nobleman's crest, by calling the swan a  goose; and was in effect reduced to beggary.    Sir Richard Granville had thought himself ill used by the earl of Suffolk  in a lawsuit; and he was accused before the star chamber of having said  of that nobleman, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19216"],[0,"The History of England in Three Volumes, Vol. I., Part F. (#20)"],[1,"that dependent situation. Instead of reviving those claims of  prerogative, so strenuously insisted on by his predecessors, Charles had  strictly confined himself within the limits of law, and had courted,  by every art of popularity, the affections of his subjects. Even  the severities, however blamable, which he had exercised against  nonconformists, are to be considered as expedients by which he strove to  ingratiate himself with that party which predominated in parliament.  But notwithstanding these promising appearances, there were many  circumstances which kept the government from resting steadily on that  bottom on which it was placed. The crown, having lost almost all its  ancient demesnes, relied entirely on voluntary grants of the people; and  the commons, not fully accustomed to this new situation, were not yet  disposed to supply, with sufficient liberality, the necessities of the  crown. They imitated too strictly the example of their predecessors in a  rigid frugality of public money; and neither sufficiently considered  the indigent condition of their prince, nor the general state of Europe,  where every nation, by its increase both of magnificence and force, had  made great additions to all public expenses. Some considerable sums,  indeed, were bestowed on Charles; and the patriots of that age,  tenacious of ancient maxims, loudly upbraided the commons with  prodigality; but if we may judge by the example of a later period, when  the government has become more regular, and the harmony of its parts has  been more happily adjusted, the parliaments of this reign seem rather to  have merited a contrary reproach.    The natural consequence of the poverty of the crown was besides feeble,  irregular transactions in foreign affairs, a continual uncertainty in  its domestic administration. No one could answer with any tolerable  assurance for the measures of the house of commons. Few of the members  were attached to the court by any other band than that of inclination.  Royalists indeed in their principles, but unexperienced in business,  they lay exposed to every rumor or insinuation; and were driven by  momentary gusts or currents, no less than the populace themselves. Even  the attempts made to gain an ascendant over them by offices, and, as  it is believed, by bribes and pensions, were apt to operate in a manner  contrary to what was intended by the ministers. The novelty of the  practice conveyed a general, and indeed a just alarm; while, at the same  time, the poverty of the crown rendered this influence very limited and  precarious.    The character of Charles was ill fitted to remedy those defects in the  constitution. He acted in the administration of public affairs, as if  government were a pastime, rather than a serious occupation; and, by  the uncertainty of his conduct he lost that authority which could alone  bestow constancy on the fluctuating resolutions of the parliament. His  expenses, too, which sometimes, perhaps, exceeded the proper bounds,  were directed more by inclination than by policy; and while they  increased his dependence on the parliament, they were not calculated  fully to satisfy either the interested or disinterested part of that  assembly.    The parliament met after a long adjournment, and the king promised  himself every thing from the attachment of the commons. All his late  measures had been calculated to acquire the good will of his people;  and, above all, the triple league, it was hoped, would be able to efface  all the disagreeable impressions left by the unhappy conclusion of the  Dutch war. But a new attempt made by the court, and a laudable one, too,  lost him for a time the effect of all these endeavors. Buckingham, who  was in great favor with the king, and carried on many intrigues among  the commons, had also endeavored to support connections with the  nonconformists; and he now formed a scheme, in concert with the lord  keeper, Sir Orlando Bridgeman, and the chief justice, Sir Matthew Hale,  two worthy patriots, to put an end to those severities under which  these religionists had so long labored. It was proposed to reconcile  the Presbyterians by a comprehension, and to grant a toleration to the  Independents and other sectaries Favor seems not, by this scheme, as  by others embraced during the present reign, to have been intended the  Catholics: yet were the zealous commons so disgusted, that they could  not be prevailed on even to give the king thanks for the triple  league, however laudable that measure was then, and has ever since been  esteemed. They immediately voted an address for a proclamation against  conventicles. Their request was complied with; but as the king still  dropped some hints of his desire to reconcile his Protestant subjects,  the commons passed a very unusual vote, that no man should bring into  the house any bill of that nature. The king in vain reiterated his  solicitations for supply; represented the necessity of equipping a  fleet; and even offered, that the money which they should grant should  be collected and issued for that purpose by commissioners appointed by  the house. Instead of complying, the commons voted an inquiry into all  the miscarriages during the late war; the slackening of sail after the  duke's victory from false orders delivered by Brounker the miscarriage  at Bergen, the division of the fleet under Prince Rupert and Albemarle,  the disgrace at Chatham. Brounker was expelled the house, and ordered to  be impeached. Commissioner Pet, who had neglected orders issued for the  security of Chatham, met with the same fate. These impeachments were  never prosecuted. The house at length, having been indulged in all their  prejudices, were prevailed with to vote the king three hundred and ten  thousand pounds, by an imposition on wine and other liquors; after which  they were adjourned.    Public business, besides being retarded by the disgust of the commons  against the tolerating maxims of the court, met with obstructions this  session from a quarrel between the two houses. Skinner, a rich merchant  in London, having suffered some injuries from the East India Company,  laid the matter by petition before the house of lords, by whom he was  relieved in costs and damages to the amount of five thousand pounds.  The commons voted, that the lords, in taking cognizance of this affair,  originally, without any appeal from inferior courts, had acted in a  manner not agreeable to the laws of the land, and tending to deprive the  subject of the right, ease, and benefit due to him by these laws; and  that Skinner, in prosecuting the suit after this manner, had infringed  the privileges of the commons; for which offence they ordered him to be  taken into custody. Some conferences ensued between the houses where the  lords were tenacious of their right of judicature, and maintained, that  the method in which they had exercised it was quite regular. The commons  rose into a great ferment; and went so far as to vote, that \"whoever  should be aiding or assisting in putting in execution the order or  sentence of the house of lords, in the case of Skinner against the East  India Company, should be deemed a betrayer of the rights and liberties  of the commons of England, and an infringer of the privileges of the  house of commons.\" They rightly judged, that it would not be easy, after  this vote, to find any one who would venture to incur their indignation.  The proceedings indeed of the lords seem in this case to have been  unusual and without precedent.    {1669.} The king's necessities obliged him again to assemble the  parliament, who showed some disposition to relieve him. The price,  however, which he must pay for this indulgence, was his yielding to  new laws against conventicles. His complaisance in this particular  contributed more to gain the commons, than all the pompous pretences  of supporting the triple alliance, that popular measure by which he  expected to make such advantage. The quarrel between the two houses was  revived; and as the commons had voted only four hundred thousand pounds,  with which the king was not satisfied, he thought proper, before they  had carried their vote into a law, to prorogue them. The only business  finished this short session, was the receiving of the report of the  committee appointed for examining the public accounts. On the first  inspection of this report, there appears a great sum, no less than a  million and a half, unaccounted for; and the natural inference is, that  the king had much abused the trust reposed in him by parliament But a  more accurate inspection of particulars serves, in a great measure,  to remove this imputation. The king indeed went so far as to tell the  parliament from the throne, \"that he had fully informed himself of that  matter, and did affirm, that no part of those moneys which they had  given him had been diverted to other uses; but, on the contrary, besides  all those supplies, a very great sum had been raised out of his standing  revenue and credit, and a very great debt contracted; and all for the  war.\" Though artificial pretences have often been employed by kings  in their speeches to parliament, and by none more than Charles, it is  somewhat difficult to suspect him of a direct lie and falsehood. He  must have had some reasons, and perhaps not unplausible ones, for this  affirmation, of which all his hearers, as they had the accounts lying  before them, were at that time competent judges.[*] [2]         * See note B, at the end of the volume.    The method which all parliaments had hitherto followed, was to vote  a particular sum for the supply, without any distinction, or any  appropriation to particular services. So long as the demands of the  crown were small and casual, no great inconveniencies arose from this  practice. But as all the measures of government were now changed, it  must be confessed that, if the king made a"]]]
