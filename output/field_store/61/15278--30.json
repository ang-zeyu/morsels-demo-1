At another time we find the same chief plotting with the Mannai  and the Saparda to raid the town of Kilman, and Esarhaddon implores the  god to show him how the place may be saved from their machinations.****         * This king's name seems to be of Iranian origin. Justi has       connected it with the name Aspakos, which is read in a Greek       inscription of the Cimmerian Bosphorus; both forms have been       connected with the Sanskrit Acvalca.         ** This subdivision of the horde into several bodies seems       to be indicated by the number of different royal names among       the Scythians which are mentioned in the Assyrian documents.         *** The site of Karkashshi is unknown, but the list of       Median princes subdued by Sargon shows that it was situated       in Media. Kishshashshu is very probably the same as Kishisim       or Kishisu, the town which Sargon subdued, and which he       called Kar-nergal or Kar-ninib, and which is mentioned in       the neighbourhood of Parsuash, Karalla, Kharkhar, Media, and       Ellipi. I think that it would be in the basin of the Gave--       Rud; Billerbeck places it at the ruins of Siama, in the       upper valley of the Lesser Zab.         **** The people of Saparda, called by the Persians Sparda,       have been with good reason identified with the Sepharad of       the prophet Obadiah (ver. 20): the Assyrian texts show that       this country should be placed in the neighbourhood of the       Mannai of the Medes.    He opens negotiations in order to gain time, but the barbarity of his  adversary is such that he fears for his envoy's safety, and speculates  whether he may not have been put to death. The situation would indeed  have become critical if Kashtariti had succeeded in bringing against  Assyria a combined force of Medes, Scythians, Mannai, and Cimmerians,  together with Urartu and its king, Eusas III.; but, fortunately, petty  hatreds made the combination of these various elements an impossibility,  and they were unable to arrive at even a temporary understanding.  The Scythians themselves were not united as to the best course to be  pursued, and while some endeavoured to show their hostility by every  imaginable outrage and annoyance, others, on the contrary, desired to  enter into friendly relations with Assyria. Esarhaddon received on  one occasion an embassy from Bartatua,* one of their kings, who humbly  begged the hand of a lady of the blood-royal, swearing to make a lasting  friendship with him if Esarhaddon would consent to the marriage. It was  hard for a child brought up in the harem, amid the luxury and comfort  of a civilised court, to be handed over to a semi-barbarous spouse; but  state policy even in those days was exacting, and more than one princess  of the line of Sargon had thus sacrificed herself by an alliance which  was to the interest of her own people.**         * Bartatua is, according to Winckler's ingenious       observation, the Proto-thyes of Herodotus, the father of       Madyes. [The name should more probably be read Masta-tua--       Ed.]         ** Sargon had in like manner given one of his daughters in       marriage to Ambaris, King of Tabal, in order to attach him       to the Assyrian cause, but without permanent success.    What troubled Esarhaddon was not the thought of sacrificing a sister  or a daughter, but a misgiving that the sacrifice would not produce  the desired result, and in his difficulty he once more had recourse to  Shamash. \"If Esarhaddon, King of Assyria, grants a daughter of the blood  (royal) to Bartatua, the King of the Iskuza, who has sent an embassy  to him to ask a wife, will Bartatua, King of the Iskuza, act loyally  towards Esarhaddon, King of Assyria? will he honestly and faithfully  enter into friendly engagements with Esarhaddon, King of Assyria? will  he observe the conditions (made by) Esarhaddon, King of Assyria? will he  fulfil them punctually? that thy high divinity knoweth. His promises, in  a decree and in the mouth of thy high divinity, O Shamash, great lord,  are they decreed, promulgated?\" It is not recorded what came of these  negotiations, nor whether the god granted the hand of the princess to  her barbarian suitor. All we know is, that the incursions and intrigues  of the Scythians continued to be a perpetual source of trouble to the  Medes, and roused them either to rebel against Assyria or to claim the  protection of its sovereign. Esarhaddon, in the course of his reign,  was more than once compelled to interfere in order to ensure peace and  quietness to the provinces on the table-land of Iran, which Sargon had  conquered and which Sennacherib had retained.*         * Several recent historians allege that Sennacherib did not       keep the territories that Sargon had conquered, and that the       Assyrian frontier became contracted on that side; whereas       the general testimony of the known texts seems to me to       prove the contrary, namely, that he preserved nearly all the       territory annexed by his father, and that Esarhaddon was far       from diminishing this inheritance. If these two kings       mention only insignificant deeds of arms in the western       region, it is because the population, exhausted by the wars       of the two preceding reigns, easily recognised the Ninevite       supremacy, and paid tribute to the Assyrian governors with       sufficient regularity to prevent any important military       expedition against them.    He had first to carry his arms to the extreme edge of the desert, into  the rugged country of Patusharra, lying at the foot of Demavend, rich  in lapis-lazuli, and as yet untrodden by any king of Assyria.* Having  reached his destination, he captured two petty kings, Eparna and  Shitirparna, and exiled them to Assyria, together with their people,  their thoroughbred horses, and their two-humped camels,--in fine, all  the possessions of their subjects. Shortly after this, three other  Median chiefs, hitherto intractable--Uppis of Par-takka, Zanasana of  Partukka,** Ramatea of Urakazabarna--came to Nineveh to present the king  with horses and lapis-lazuli, the best of everything they possessed, and  piteously entreated him to forgive their misdeeds.         * The country of Patusharra has been identified with that of       the Patischorians mentioned by Strabo in Persia proper, who       would have lived further north, not far from Demavend;       Sachau calls attention to the existence of a mountain chain       Patashwar-gar or Padishwar-gir, in front of Choarcne, and he       places the country of Patusharra between Demavend and the       desert.         ** Partakka and Partukka seem to be two different       adaptations of the name Paraituka, the Parsetakeno of the       Greek geographers; Tiele thinks of Parthyeno. I think that       these two names designate the northern districts of       Partetakeno, the present Ashnakhor or the country near to       it.    They represented that the whole of Media was torn asunder by countless  strifes, prince against prince, city against city, and an iron will was  needed to bring the more turbulent elements to order. Esarhaddon lent  a favourable ear to their prayers; he undertook to protect them on  condition of their paying an annual tribute, and he put them under  the protection of the Assyrian governors who were nearest to their  territory. Kharkhar, securely entrenched behind its triple ramparts,  assumed the position of capital to these Iranian marches.    It is difficult to determine the precise dates of these various events;  we learn merely that they took place before 673, and we surmise that  they must have occurred between the second and sixteenth year of the  king's reign.*         * The facts relating to the submission of Patusharra and of       Partukka are contained in Cylinder A, dated from the       eponymous year of Akhazilu, in 673. Moreover, the version       which this document contains seems to have been made up of       two pieces placed one at the end of the other: the first an       account of events which occurred during an earlier period of       the reign, and in which the exploits are classified in       geographical order, from Sidon in the west the Arabs       bordering on Chaldaea in the east; and the second consisting       of additional campaigns carried out after the completion of       the former--which is proved by the place which these       exploits occupy, out of their normal position in the       geographical series--and making mention of Partusharra and       Partuhka, as well as of Belikisha. The editor of the _Broken       Cylinder_ has tried to combine these latter elements with       the former in the order adopted by the original narrator. As       far as can be seen in what is left of the columns, he has       placed, after the Chaldsean events, the facts concerning       Partukka, then those concerning Patusharra, and finally the       campaign against Bazu, the extreme limit of Esarhaddon's       activity in the south. Knowing that the campaign in the       desert and the death of Abdimilkot took place in 676, and       that we find them already alluded to in the first part of       the narrative, as well as the events of 675 relating to the       revolt of Dakkuri, we may conclude that the submission of       Patusharra and that of Partukka occurred in 674, or at       latest in the beginning of 673.

The outcome of them was a distinct gain to Assyria, in the acquisition  of several new vassals.

Most of the cities of the Said were in such a state of decadence that it  was no longer possible to restore to them their former prosperity, but  Abydos occupied too important a place in the beliefs connected with the  future world, and attracted too many pilgrims, to permit of its being  neglected. The whole of its ancient necropolis had been rifled by  thieves during the preceding centuries, and the monuments were nearly as  much buried by sand as in our own times.    [Illustration: 111.jpg AN OSIRIS STRETCHED FULL LENGTH ON THE GROUND]         Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, after Mariette. The monument is a       statuette measuring only 15 centimetres in length; it has       been reproduced to give an idea of the probable form of the       statue seen by Herodotus.    The dismantled fortress now known as the Shunet ez-Zebib served as the  cemetery for the ibises of Thoth, and for the stillborn children of the  sacred singing-women, while the two Memnonia of Seti and Ramses, now  abandoned by their priests, had become mere objects of respectful  curiosity, on which devout Egyptians or passing travellers--Phoenicians,  Aramaeans, Cypriots, Carians, and Greeks from Ionia and the isles--came  to carve their names.*         * The position occupied by the graffiti on certain portions       of the walls show that in these places in the temple of Seti       there was already a layer of sand varying from one to three       metres in depth.    Amasis confided the work of general restoration to one of the principal  personages of his court, Pefzaaunit, Prince of Sais, who devoted his  attention chiefly to two buildings--the great sanctuary of Osiris, which  was put into good condition throughout, and the very ancient necropolis  of Omm-el-Graab, where lay hidden the _alquhah_, one of the sepulchres  of the god; he restored the naos, the table of offerings, the barques,  and the temple furniture, and provided for the sacred patrimony by an  endowment of fields, vineyards, palm groves, and revenues, so as to  ensure to the sanctuary offerings in perpetuity. It was a complete  architectural resurrection. The nomes of Middle Egypt, which had  suffered considerably during the Ethiopian and Assyrian wars, had  some chance of prosperity now that their lords were relieved from the  necessity of constantly fighting for some fresh pretender. Horu, son  of Psam-metichus, Prince of the Oleander nome, rebuilt the ancient  sanctuary of Harshafaitu at Heracleopolis, and endowed it with a  munificence which rivalled that of Pefzaaunifc at Abydos. The king  himself devoted his resources chiefly to works at Memphis and in the  Delta. He founded a temple of Isis at Memphis, which Herodotus  described as extending over an immense area and being well worth seeing;  unfortunately nothing now remains of it, nor of the recumbent colossus,  sixty feet in length, which the king placed before the court of Phtah,  nor of the two gigantic statues which he raised in front of the temple,  one on each side of the door.    [Illustration: 112.jpg THE TWO GODDESSES OF LAW; ANI ADORING OSIRIS] THE  TRIAL OF THE CONSCIENCE; TOTH AND THE FEATHER OF THE LAW.    Besides these architectural works, Amasis invested the funerary  ceremonies of the Apis-bulls with a magnificence rarely seen before  his time, and the official stelae which he carved to the memory of  the animals who died in his reign exhibit a perfection of style quite  unusual. His labours at Memphis, however, were eclipsed by the admirable  work which he accomplished at Sais. The propylae which he added to the  temple of Nit \"surpassed most other buildings of the same kind, as  much by their height and extent, as by the size and quality of the  materials;\" he had, moreover, embellished them by a fine colonnade, and  made an approach to them by an avenue of sphinxes.    [Illustration: 113.jpg AMASIS IN ADORATION BEFORE THE BULL APIS]         Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a photograph taken in the       Louvre.    In other parts of the same building were to be seen two superb obelisks,  a recumbent figure similar to that at Memphis, and a monolithic naos  of rose granite brought from the quarries of Elephantine. Amasis had a  special predilection for this kind of monument. That which he erected at  Thmuis is nearly twenty-three feet in height,* and the Louvre contains  another example, which though smaller still excites the admiration of  the modern visitor.**         * The exact measurements are 23 1/2 ft. in height, 12 ft. 9       ins. in width, and 10 ft. 6 ins. in depth. The naos of Saft       el-Hinneh must have been smaller, but it is impossible to       determine its exact dimensions.         ** It measures 9 ft. 7 ins. in height, 3 ft. 1 in. in width,       and 3 ft. 8 ins.    [Illustration: 114.jpg THE NAOS OF AMASIS AT THMUIS]         Drawn by Boudier, from the sketch of Burton.    The naos of Sais, which amazed Herodotus, was much larger than either of  the two already mentioned, or, indeed, than any known example. Tradition  states that it took two thousand boatmen three years to convey it down  from the first cataract. It measured nearly thirty feet high in the  interior, twenty-four feet in depth, and twelve feet in breadth; even  when hollowed out to contain the emblem of the god, it still weighed  nearly 500,000 kilograms. It never reached its appointed place in the  sanctuary. The story goes that \"the architect, at the moment when the  monument had been moved as far as a certain spot in the temple, heaved  a sigh, oppressed with the thought of the time expended on its transport  and weary of the arduous work. Amasis overheard the sigh, and taking it  as an omen, he commanded that the block should be dragged no further.  Others relate that one of the overseers in charge of the work was  crushed to death by the monument, and for this reason it was left  standing on the spot,\" where for centuries succeeding generations came  to contemplate it.*         * The measurements given by Herodotus are so different from       those of any naos as yet discovered, that I follow Kenrick       in thinking that Herodotus saw the monument of Amasis lying       on its side, and that he took for the height what was really       the width in depth. It had been erected in the nome of       Athribis, and afterwards taken to Alexandria about the       Ptolemaic era; it was discovered under water in one of the       ports of the town at the beginning of this century, and       Drovetti, who recovered it, gave it to the Museum of the       Louvre in 1825.    Amasis, in devoting his revenues to such magnificent works, fully shared  the spirit of the older Pharaohs, and his labours were nattering to  the national vanity, even though many lives were sacrificed in their  accomplishment; but the glory which they reflected on Egypt did not  have the effect of removing the unpopularity in which Tie was personally  held. The revolution which overthrew Apries had been provoked by the  hatred of the native party towards the foreigners; he himself had been  the instrument by which it had been accomplished, and it would have been  only natural that, having achieved a triumph in spite of the Greeks and  the mercenaries, he should have wished to be revenged on them, and have  expelled them from his dominions. But, as a fact, nothing of the kind  took place, and Amasis, once crowned, forgot the wrongs he had suffered  as an aspirant to the royal dignity; no sooner was he firmly seated on  the throne, than he recalled the strangers, and showed that he had only  friendly intentions with regard to them. His predecessors had received  them into favour, he, in fact, showed a perfect infatuation for them,  and became as complete a Greek as it was possible for an Egyptian to be.  His first care had been to make a treaty with the Dorians of Oyrene, and  he displayed so much tact in dealing with them, that they forgave him  for the skirmish of Irasa, and invited him to act as arbitrator in their  dissensions. A certain Arkesilas II. had recently succeeded the Battos  who had defeated the Egyptian troops, but his suspicious temper had  obliged his brothers to separate themselves from him, and they had  founded further westwards the independent city of Barca. On his  threatening to evict them, they sent a body of Libyans against him.  Fighting ensued, and he was beaten close to the town of Leukon. He  lost 7000 hoplites in the engagement, and the disaster aroused so  much ill-feeling against him that Laarchos, another of his brothers,  strangled him. Laarchos succeeded him amid the acclamations of the  soldiery; but not long after, Eryxo and Polyarchos, the wife and  brother-in-law of his victim, surprised and assassinated him in his  turn. The partisans of Laarchos then had recourse to the Pharaoh, who  showed himself disposed to send them help; but his preparations were  suspended owing to the death of his mother. Polyarchos repaired to Egypt  before the royal mourning was ended, and pleaded his cause with such  urgency that he won over the king to his side; he obtained the royal  investiture for his sister's child, who was still a minor, Battos III.,  the lame, and thus placed Oyrene in a sort of vassalage to the Egyptian  crown.*         * Herodotus narrates these events without mentioning Amasis,       and Nicolas of Damascus"]]]
