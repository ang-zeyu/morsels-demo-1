Slaves would run away but most of the time they were caught. The  Master would put blood hounds on their trail, and sometimes the slave  would kill the blood hound and make his escape. If a slave once tried  to run away and was caught, he would be whipped almost to death, and  from then on if he was sent any place they would chain their meanest  blood hound to him.    Funerals were very simple for slaves, they could not carry the body to  the church they would just take it to the grave yard and bury it. They  were not even allowed to sing a song at the cemetery. Old Mistress  used to tell us ghost stories after funerals and they would nearly  scare me to death. She would tell of seeing men with no head, and see  cattle that would suddenly turn to cats, and she made us believe if a  fire was close to a cemetery it was coming from a ghost.    I used to hear quite a bit about voodoo, but that some thing I never  believed in, therefore, I didn't pay any attention to it.    When a slave was sick, the master would get a good doctor for him if  he was a good slave, but if he wasn't considered a good slave he would  be given cheap medical care. Some of the doctors would not go to the  cabin where the slaves were, and the slave would have to be carried on  his bed to his master's back porch and the doctor would see him there.    When the news came that we were free, all of us were hid on the  Mississippi River. We had been there for several days, and we had to  catch fish with our hands and roast them for food. I remember quite  well when old Master came down to there and hollered, Come on out  niggers; you are free now and you can do as you please! We all went to  the Big House and there we found old Miss crying and talking about how  she hated to lose her good niggers.    Abraham Lincoln! Why we mourned three months for that man when he  died! I wouldn't miss a morning getting my black arm band and placing  it on in remembrance of Abraham, who was the best friend the Negroes  ever had. Now old Jeff Davis, I didn't care a thing about him. He was  a Democrat and none of them mean anything to the Negro. And if these  young Negroes don't quit messing with the democratic bunch they are  going to be right back where we started from. If they only knew as I  know they would struggle to keep such from happening, because although  I had a good master I wouldn't want to go through it again.          Oklahoma Writers' Project  Ex-Slaves    MARY GRAYSON  Age 83 yrs.  Tulsa, Oklahoma      I am what we colored people call a \"native.\" That means that I didn't  come into the Indian country from somewhere in the Old South, after  the War, like so many negroes did, but I was born here in the old  Creek Nation, and my master was a Creek Indian. That was eighty three  years ago, so I am told.    My mammy belonged to white people back in Alabama when she was  born--down in the southern part I think, for she told me that after  she was a sizeable girl her white people moved into the eastern part  of Alabama where there was a lot of Creeks. Some of them Creeks was  mixed up with the whites, and some of the big men in the Creeks who  come to talk to her master was almost white, it looked like. \"My white  folks moved around a lot when I was a little girl\", she told me.    When mammy was about 10 or 13 years old some of the Creeks begun to  come out to the Territory in little bunches. They wasn't the ones who  was taken out here by the soldiers and contractor men--they come on  ahead by themselves and most of them had plenty of money, too. A Creek  come to my mammy's master and bought her to bring out here, but she  heard she was being sold and run off into the woods. There was an old  clay pit, dug way back into a high bank, where the slaves had been  getting clay to mix with hog hair scrapings to make chinking for the  big log houses that they built for the master and the cabins they made  for themselves. Well, my mammy run and hid way back in that old clay  pit, and it was way after dark before the master and the other man  found her.    The Creek man that bought her was a kind sort of a man, mammy said,  and wouldn't let the master punish her. He took her away and was kind  to her, but he decided she was too young to breed and he sold her to  another Creek who had several slaves already, and he brought her out  to the Territory.    The McIntosh men was the leaders in the bunch that come out at that  time, and one of the bunch, named Jim Perryman, bought my mammy and  married her to one of his \"boys\", but after he waited a while and she  didn't have a baby he decided she was no good breeder and he sold her  to Mose Perryman.    Mose Perryman was my master, and he was a cousin to Legus Perryman,  who was a big man in the Tribe. He was a lot younger than Mose, and  laughed at Mose for buying my mammy, but he got fooled, because my  mammy got married to Mose's slave boy Jacob, the way the slaves was  married them days, and went ahead and had ten children for Mr. Mose.    Mose Perryman owned my pappy and his older brother, Hector, and one of  the McIntosh men, Oona, I think his name was, owned my pappy's brother  William. I can remember when I first heard about there was going to be  a war. The older children would talk about it, but they didn't say it  was a war all over the country. They would talk about a war going to  be \"back in Alabama\", and I guess they had heard the Creeks talking  about it that way.    When I was born we lived in the Choska bottoms, and Mr. Mose Perryman  had a lot of land broke in all up and down the Arkansas river along  there. After the War, when I had got to be a young woman, there was  quite a settlement grew up at Choska (pronounced Choe-skey) right  across the river east of where Haskell now is, but when I was a child  before the War all the whole bottoms was marshy kind of wilderness  except where farms had been cleared out. The land was very rich, and  the Creeks who got to settle there were lucky. They always had big  crops. All west of us was high ground, toward Gibson station and Fort  Gibson, and the land was sandy. Some of the McIntoshes lived over that  way, and my Uncle William belonged to one of them.    We slaves didn't have a hard time at all before the War. I have had  people who were slaves of white folks back in the old states tell me  that they had to work awfully hard and their masters were cruel to  them sometimes, but all the Negroes I knew who belonged to Creeks  always had plenty of clothes and lots to eat and we all lived in good  log cabins we built. We worked the farm and tended to the horses and  cattle and hogs, and some of the older women worked around the owner's  house, but each Negro family looked after a part of the fields and  worked the crops like they belonged to us.    When I first heard talk about the War the slaves were allowed to go  and see one another sometimes and often they were sent on errands  several miles with a wagon or on a horse, but pretty soon we were all  kept at home, and nobody was allowed to come around and talk to us.  But we heard what was going on.    The McIntosh men got nearly everybody to side with them about the War,  but we Negroes got word somehow that the Cherokees over back of Ft.  Gibson was not going to be in the War, and that there were some Union  people over there who would help slaves to get away, but we children  didn't know anything about what we heard our parents whispering about,  and they would stop if they heard us listening. Most of the Creeks who  lived in our part of the country, between the Arkansas and the  Verdigris, and some even south of the Arkansas, belonged to the Lower  Creeks and sided with the South, but down below us along the Canadian  River they were Upper Creeks and there was a good deal of talk about  them going with the North. Some of the Negroes tried to get away and  go down to them, but I don't know of any from our neighborhood that  went to them.    Some Upper Creeks came up into the Choska bottoms talking around among  the folks there about siding with the North. They were talking, they  said, for old man Gouge, who was a big man among the Upper Creeks. His  Indian name was Opoeth-le-ya-hola, and he got away into Kansas with a  big bunch of Creeks and Seminoles during the War.    Before that time, I remember one night my uncle William brought  another Negro man to our cabin and talked a long time with my pappy,  but pretty soon some of the Perryman Negroes told them that Mr. Mose  was coming down and they went off into the woods to talk. But Mr. Mose  didn't come down. When pappy came back Mammy cried quite a while, and  we children could hear them arguing late at night. Then my uncle  Hector slipped over to our cabin several times and talked to pappy,  and mammy began to fix up grub, but she didn't give us children but a  little bit of it, and told us to stay around with her at the cabin and  not go playing with the other children.    Then early one morning, about daylight, old Mr. Mose came down to the  cabin in his buggy, waving a shot gun and hollering at the top of his  voice. I never saw a man so mad in all my life, before nor since!    He yelled in at mammy to \"git them children together and git up to my  house before I beat you and all of them to death!\" Mammy began to cry  and plead that she didn't know anything, but he acted like he was  going to shoot sure enough, so we all ran to mammy and started for Mr.  Mose's house as fast as we could trot.    We had to pass all the other Negro cabins on the way, and we could see  that they were all empty, and it looked like everything in them had  been tore up. Straw and corn shucks all over the place, where somebody  had tore up the mattresses, and all the pans and kettles gone off the  outside walls where they used to hang them.    At one place we saw two Negro boys loading some iron kettles on a  wagon, and a little further on "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20788"],[0,"Storm Over Warlock (#20)"],[1,"lso, he believed, to satisfy an enemy.    The dream was a part of it. But who or what could set a man dreaming and  so take over his body, make him in fact betray himself? But then, what  had made Thorvald maroon him here? For the first time, Shann guessed a  new, if wild, explanation for the officer's desertion. Dreams--and the  disk which had worked so strangely on Thorvald. Suppose everything the  other had surmised was the truth! Then that disk _had_ been found on  this very island, and here somewhere must lie a clue to the riddle.    Shann licked his lips. Suppose that Thorvald had been sent away under  just such a strong compulsion as the one which had ruled Shann last  night? Why was he left behind if the other had been moved away to  protect some secret? Was it that Shann himself was wanted here, wanted  so much that when he at last found a means of escape he was set to  destroy it? That act might have been forced upon him for two reasons: to  keep him here, and to impress upon him how powerless he was.    Powerless! A flicker of stubborn will stirred to respond to that implied  challenge. All right, the mysterious _they_ had made him do this. But  they had underrated him by letting him learn, almost contemptuously, of  their presence by that revelation. So warned, he was in a manner armed;  he could prepare to fight back.    He squatted by the wreckage as he thought that through, turning over  broken pieces. And, Shann realized, he must present at the moment a  satisfactory picture of despondency to any spy. A spy, that was it!  Someone or something must have him under observation, or his activities  of the day before would not have been so summarily countered. And if  there was a spy, then there was his answer to the riddle. To trap the  trapper. Such action might be a project beyond his resources, but it was  his own counterattack.    So now he had to play a role. Not only must he search the island for the  trace of his spy, but he must do it in such a fashion that his purpose  would not be plain to the enemy he suspected. The wolverines could help.  Shann arose, allowed his shoulders to droop, slouching to the slope with  all the air of a beaten man which he could assume, whistling for Taggi  and Togi.    When they came, his exploration began. Ostensibly he was hunting for  lengths of drift or suitable growing saplings to take the place of those  he had destroyed under orders. But he kept a careful watch on the animal  pair, hoping by their reactions to pick up a clue to any hidden watcher.    The larger of the two beaches marked the point where the Terrans had  first landed and where the shell thing had been killed. The smaller was  more of a narrow tongue thrust out into the lagoon, much of it choked  with sizable boulders. On earlier visits there Taggi and Togi had poked  into the hollows among these with their usual curiosity. But now both  animals remained upslope, showing no inclination to descend to the water  line.    Shann caught hold of Taggi's scruff, pulling him along. The wolverine  twisted and whined, but he did not fight for freedom as he would have  upon scenting Throg. Not that the Terran had ever believed one of those  aliens was responsible for the happenings on the island.    Taggi came down under Shann's urging, but he was plainly ill at ease.  And at last he snarled a warning when the man would have drawn him  closer to two rocks which met overhead in a crude semblance of an arch.  There was a stick of drift protruding from that hollow affording Shann a  legitimate excuse to venture closer. He dropped his hold on the  wolverines, stooped to gather in the length of wood, and at the same  time glanced into the pocket.    Water lay just beyond, making this a doorway to the lagoon. The sun had  not yet penetrated into the shadow, if it ever did. Shann reached for  the wood, at the same time drawing his finger across the flat rock which  would furnish a steppingstone for anything using that door as an  entrance to the island.    Wet! Which might mean his visitor had recently arrived, or else merely  that a splotch of spray had landed there not too long before. But in his  mind Shann was convinced that he had found the spy's entrance. Could he  turn it into a trap? He added a piece of drift to his bundle and picked  up two more before he returned to the cliff ahead.    A trap.... He revolved in his mind all the traps he knew which could be  used here. He already had decided upon the bait--his own work. And if  his plans went through--and hope does not die easily--then this time he  would not waste his labor either.    So he went back to the same job he had done the day before, making do  with skin strips he had considered second-best before, smoothing,  cutting. Only the trap occupied his mind, and close to sunset he knew  just what he was going to do and how.    Though the Terran did not know the nature of the unseen opponent, he  thought he could guess two weaknesses which might deliver the other into  his hands. First, the enemy was entirely confident of success in this  venture. No being who was able to control Shann as completely and ably  as had been done the night before would credit any prey with the power  to strike back in force.    Second, such a confident enemy would be unable to resist watching the  manipulation of a captive. The Terran was certain that his opponent  would be on the scene somewhere when he was led, dreaming, to destroy  his work once more.    He might be wrong on both of those counts, but inwardly he didn't  believe so. However, he had to wait until the dark to set up his own  answer, one so simple he was certain the enemy would not suspect it at  all.          11. THE WITCH      There were patches of light in the inner valley marking the  phosphorescent plants, some creeping at ground level, others tall as  saplings. On other nights Shann had welcomed that wan radiance, but now  he lay in as relaxed a position as possible, marking each of those  potential betrayers as he tried to counterfeit the attitude of sleep and  at the same time plan out his route.    He had purposely settled in a pool of shadow, the wolverines beside him.  And he thought that the bulk of the animal's bodies would cover his own  withdrawal when the time came to move. One arm lying limply across his  middle was in reality clutching to him an intricate arrangement of small  hide straps which he had made by sacrificing most of the remainder of  his painfully acquired thongs. The trap must be set in place soon!    Now that he had charted a path to the crucial point avoiding all light  plants, Shann was ready to move. The Terran pressed his hand on Taggi's  head in the one imperative command the wolverine was apt to obey--the  order to stay where he was.    Shann sat up and gave the same voiceless instruction to Togi. Then he  inched out of the hollow, a worm's progress to that narrow way along the  cliff top--the path which anyone or anything coming up from that sea  gate on the beach would have to pass in order to witness the shoreline  occupied by the half-built outrigger.    So much of his plan was based upon luck and guesses, but those were all  Shann had. And as he worked at the stretching of his snare, the Terran's  heart pounded, and he tensed at every sound out of the night. Having  tested all the anchoring of his net, he tugged at a last knot, and then  crouched to listen not only with his ears, but with all his strength of  mind and body.    Pound of waves, whistle of wind, the sleepy complaint of some bird.... A  regular splashing! One of the fish in the lagoon? Or what he awaited?  The Terran retreated as noiselessly as he had come, heading for the  hollow where he had bedded down.    He reached there breathless, his heart pumping, his mouth dry as if he  had been racing. Taggi stirred and thrust a nose inquiringly against  Shann's arm. But the wolverine made no sound, as if he, too, realized  that some menace lay beyond the rim of the valley. Would that other come  up the path Shann had trapped? Or had he been wrong? Was the enemy  already stalking him from the other beach? The grip of his stunner was  slippery in his damp hand; he hated this waiting.    The canoe ... his work on it had been a careless botching. Better to  have the job done right. Why, it was perfectly clear now how he had been  mistaken! His whole work plan was wrong; he could see the right way of  doing things laid out as clear as a blueprint in his mind. A picture in  his mind!    Shann stood up and both wolverines moved uneasily, though neither made a  sound. A picture in his mind! But this time he wasn't asleep; he wasn't  dreaming a dream--to be used for his own defeat. Only (that other could  not know this) the pressure which had planted the idea of new work to be  done in his mind--an idea one part of him accepted as fact--had not  taken warning from his move. He was supposed to be under control; the  Terran was sure of that. All right, so he would play that part. He must  if he would entice the trapper into his trap.    He holstered his stunner, walked out into the open, paying no heed now  to the patches of light through which he must pass on his way to the  path his own feet had already worn to the boat beach. As he went, Shann  tried to counterfeit what he believed would be the gait of a man under  compulsion.    Now he was on the rim fronting the downslope, fighting against his  desire to turn and see for himself if anything had climbed behind. The  canoe was all wrong, a bad job which he must make better at once so that  in the morning he would be free of this island prison.    The pressure of that other's will grew stronger. And the Terran read  into that the overconfidence which he believed would be part of the  enemy's character. The one who was sending him to destroy his own work  had no suspicion that the victim was not entirely malleable, ready to be  used as he himself would use"]]]
