[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19103"],[0,"The Discovery of a World in the Moone (#20)"],[1,"I doubt  not but this also, and farre greater mysteries will bee discovered. In  the first ages of the world the Islanders either thought themselves to  be the onely dwellers upon the earth, or else if there were any other,  yet they could not possibly conceive how they might have any commerce  with them, being severed by the deepe and broad Sea, but the after-times  found out the invention of ships, in which notwithstanding none but some  bold daring men durst venture, there being few so resolute as to commit  themselves unto the vaste Ocean, and yet now how easie a thing is this,  even to a timorous & cowardly nature? So, perhaps, there may be some  other meanes invented for a conveyance to the Moone, and though it may  seeme a terrible and impossible thing ever to passe through the vaste  spaces of the aire, yet no question there would bee some men who durst  venture this as well as the other. True indeed, I cannot conceive any  possible meanes for the like discovery of this conjecture, since there  can bee no sailing to the Moone, unlesse that were true which the Poets  doe but feigne, that shee made her bed in the Sea. We have not now any  _Drake_ or _Columbus_ to undertake this voyage, or any _Daedalus_ to  invent a conveyance through the aire. However, I doubt not but that time  who is still the father of new truths, and hath revealed unto us many  things which our Ancestours were ignorant of, will also manifest to our  posterity, that which wee now desire, but cannot know. _Veniet tempus_  (saith _Seneca_[1])      _quo ista quae nunc latent, in lucem, dies extrahet, & longioris aevi    diligentia._    Time will come when the indeavours of after-ages shall bring such things  to light, as now lie hid in obscurity. Arts are not yet come to their  Solstice, but the industry of future times assisted with the labours of  their forefathers, may reach unto that height which wee could not  attaine to.      _Ueniet tempus quo posteri nostri nos tam aperta nescisse mirentur._    As wee now wonder at the blindnesse of our Ancestors, who were not able  to discerne such things as seeme plaine and obvious unto us. So will our  posterity admire our ignorance in as perspicuous matters. _Keplar_  doubts not, but that as soone as the art of flying is found out, some of  their Nation will make one of the first colonies that shall inhabite  that other world. But I leave this and the like conjectures to the  fancie of the reader; Desiring now to finish this Discourse, wherein I  have in some measure proved what at the first I promised, a world in the  Moone. However, I am not so resolute in this, that I thinke tis  necessary there must be one, but my opinion is that 'tis possible there  may be, and tis probable there is another habitable world in that  Planet. And this was that I undertooke to prove. In the pursuit whereof,  if I have shewed much weaknesse or indiscretion; I shall willingly  submit my selfe to the reason and censure of the more judicious.      [Sidenote 1: _Nat. Quaest. l. 7. c. 25._]            [Decoration]    The Propositions that are proved in this Discourse.      Proposition 1.    _That the strangenesse of this opinion is no sufficient reason why it    should be rejected, because other certaine truths have beene formerly    esteemed ridiculous, and great absurdities entertayned by common    consent._    By way of Preface.      Prop. 2.    _That a plurality of worlds doth not contradict any principle of    reason or faith._      Prop. 3.    _That the heavens doe not consist of any such pure matter which can    priviledge them from the like change and corruption, as these    inferiour bodies are liable unto._      Prop. 4.    _That the Moone is a solid, compacted opacous body._      Prop. 5.    _That the Moone hath not any light of her owne._      Prop. 6.    _That there is a world in the Moone, hath beene the direct opinion of    many ancient, with some moderne Mathematicians, and may probably be    deduced from the tenents of others._      Prop. 7.    _That those spots and brighter parts which by our sight may be    distinguished in the Moone, doe shew the difference betwixt the    Sea and Land in that other world._      Prop. 8.    _That the spots represent the Sea, and the brighter parts the Land._      Prop. 9.    _That there are high Mountaines, deepe vallies, and spacious plaines    in the body of the Moone._      Prop. 10.    _That there is an Atmo-sphaera, or an orbe of grosse vaporous aire,    immediately encompassing the body of the Moone._      Prop. 11.    _That as their world is our Moone, so our world is their Moone._      Prop. 12.    _That tis probable there may bee such Meteors belonging to that world    in the Moone, as there are with us._      Prop. 13.    _That tis probable there may be inhabitants in this other World, but    of what kinde they are is uncertaine._      FINIS.             *       *       *       *       *             *       *       *       *         *       *       *       *       *    [Transcriber's Additional Notes and Errata]    Works and Authors Cited in Sidenotes:    This is not intended to be a comprehensive list.

As an artist, he should not afford this public merely a  cheap amusement, but should acquaint it with the most perfect  embodiments of that art whose sole task properly is to ennoble the  taste of mankind, and to bestow happiness; to raise it above the  miseries of this workaday world, withdraw it from them, to idealize  even the hateful things in human nature which it may have to  represent, without departing from truth.    But what is the attitude of artists toward these tasks?    CLEVELAND, January 11, 1902.          NOTE    _A Good Remedy for Catarrh and Hoarseness_      Pour boiling hot water into a saucer, and let a large sponge suck it  all up. Then squeeze it firmly out again. Hold the sponge to the nose  and mouth, and breathe alternately through the nose and mouth, in and  out.    I sing my exercises, the great scale, passages, etc., and all the  vowels into it, and so force the hot steam to act upon the lungs,  bronchial tubes, and especially on the mucous membranes, while I am  breathing in and out through the sponge. After this has been kept up  for ten or fifteen minutes, wash the face in cold water. This can be  repeated four to six times a day. The sponge should not be full of  water, but must be quite squeezed out. This has helped me greatly, and  I can recommend it highly. It can do no injury because it is natural.  But after breathing in the hot steam, do not go out immediately into  the cold air."]]]
