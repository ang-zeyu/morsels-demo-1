So long as man  obeys the laws which regulate health, observes temperance in all things,  uses the things of this world as not abusing them, he is at rest, he is  blessed, he is happy: but no sooner has he violated heaven's law than he  becomes the slave, and the servant assumes the master. But I am  digressing. I would gladly follow this subject further, but I shall go  beyond my limits, and, it may be, your patience.    I would insist, however, on the facts to which your attention has been  given, for it is impossible, as I have before contended, to use language  correctly without a knowledge of the things and ideas it is employed to  represent.    Grovelling, indeed, must be the mind which will not trace the sublime  exhibitions of Divine power and skill in all the operations of nature;  and false must be that theory which teaches the young mind to think and  speak of neutrality as attached to things which do exist. As low and  debasing as the speculations of the schoolmen were, they gave to things  which they conceived to be incapable of action, a principle which they  called \"_vis inertiae_,\" or, _power to lie still_. Shall our systems of  instruction descend below them, throw an insurmountable barrier in the  way of human improvement, and teach the false principles that actions  can exist without an effect, or that there is a class of words which  \"express neither action or passion.\" Such a theory is at war with the  first principles of philosophy, and denies that \"like causes produce  like effects.\"    The ablest minds have never been able to explain the foundation of a  \"neuter verb,\" or to find a single word, with a solitary exception,  which does not, in certain conditions, express a positive action, and  terminate on a definite object; and that exception we shall see refers  to a verb which expresses the highest degree of conceivable action.  Still they have insisted on _three_ and some on _four_ kinds of verbs,  one expressing action, another passion or suffering, and the third  neutrality. We propose to offer a brief review of these distinctions,  which have so long perplexed, not only learners, but teachers  themselves, and been the fruitful source of much dissention among  grammarians.    It is to be hoped you will come up to this work with as great candor as  you have heretofore manifested, and as fully resolved to take nothing  for granted, because it has been said by good or great men, and to  reject nothing because it appears new or singular. Let truth be our  object and reason our guide to direct us to it. We can not fail of  arriving at safe and correct conclusions.    Mr. Murray tells us that \"verbs are of three kinds, _active_, _passive_,  and _neuter_. In a note he admits of \"active _transitive_ and  intransitive verbs,\" as a subdivision of his first kind. Most of his  \"improvers\" have adopted this distinction, and regard it as of essential  importance.    We shall contend, as before expressed, that _all_ verbs are of _one  kind_, that they _express action_, for the simple yet sublime reason,  that every thing acts, at all times, and under every possible condition;  according to the true definition of _action_ as understood and employed  by all writers on grammar, and natural and moral science. Here we are at  issue. Both, contending for principles so opposite, can not be correct.  One or the other, however pure the motives, must be attached to a system  wrong in theory, and of course pernicious in practice. You are to be the  umpires in the case, and, if you are faithful to your trust, you will  not be bribed or influenced in the least by the opinions of others. If  divested of all former attachments, if free from all prejudice, there  can be no doubt of the safety and correctness of your conclusions. But I  am apprehensive I expect too much, if I place the _new_ system of  grammar on a footing equally favorable in your minds with those you have  been taught to respect, as the only true expositions of language, from  your childhood up, and which are recommended to you on the authority of  the learned and good of many generations. I have to combat early  prejudices, and systems long considered as almost sacred. But I have in  my favor the common sense of the world, and a feeling of opposition to  existing systems, which has been produced, not so much by a detection of  their errors, as by a lack of capacity, as the learner verily thought,  to understand their profound mysteries. I am, therefore, willing to risk  the final decision with you, if _you_ will decide. But I am not willing  to have you made the tools of the opposite party, determined, whether  convinced or not, to hold to your old _neuter_ verb systems, right or  wrong, merely because others are doing so. All I ask is _your_ adoption  of what is proved to be undeniably true, and rejection of whatever is  found to be false.    Here is where the matter must rest, for it will not be pretended that it  is better to teach falsehood because it is ancient and popular, than  truth because it is novel. Teachers, in this respect, stand in a most  responsible relation to their pupils. They should always insist with an  unyielding pertinacity, on the importance of truth, and the evils of  error. Every trifling incident, in the course of education, which will  serve to show the contrast, should be particularly observed. If an error  can be detected in their books, they should be so taught as to be able  to correct it; and they should be so inclined as to be willing to do it.  They should not be skeptics, however, but close observers, original  thinkers, and correct reasoners. It is degrading to the true dignity and  independence of man, to submit blindly to any proposition. Freedom of  thought is the province of all. Children should be made to breathe the  free air of honest inquiry, and to inhale the sweet spirit of truth and  charity. They should not study their books as the end of learning, but  as a means of knowing. Books should be regarded as lamps, which are set  by the way side, not as the objects to be looked at, but the aids by  which we may find the object of our search. Knowledge and usefulness  constitute the leading motives in all study, and no occasion should be  lost, no means neglected, which will lead the young mind to their  possession.    Your attention is now invited to some critical remarks on the  distinctions usually observed in the use of verbs. Let us carefully  examine the meaning of these _three kinds_ and see if there is any  occasion for such a division; if they have any foundation in truth, or  application in the correct use of language. We will follow the  arrangements adopted by the most popular grammars.    \"A _verb active_ expresses an action, and necessarily implies an agent,  and an object acted upon; as, to love, I love Penelope.\" A very  excellent definition, indeed! Had grammarians stopped here, their works  would have been understood, and proved of some service in the study of  language. But when they diverge from this bright spot in the  consideration of verbs--this oasis in the midst of a desert--they soon  become lost in the surrounding darkness of conjecture, and follow each  their own dim light, to hit on a random track, which to follow in the  pursuit of their object.    We give our most hearty assent to the above definition of a verb. It  expresses action, which necessarily implies an _actor_, and an _object_  influenced by the action. In our estimation it matters not whether the  object on which the action terminates is expressed or _understood_. If I  _love_, I must love some object; either my neighbor, my enemy, my  family, _myself_, or something else. In either case the _action_ is the  same, tho the objects may be different; and it is regarded, on all  hands, as an active verb. Hence when the object on which the action  terminates is not expressed, it is necessarily understood. All language  is, in this respect, more or less eliptical, which adds much to its  richness and brevity.    Active verbs, we are told, are divided into _transitive_ and  _intransitive_. Mr. Murray does not exactly approve of this distinction,  but prefers to class the intransitive and neuter together. Others, aware  of the fallacy of attempting to make children conceive any thing like  neutrality in the verbs, _run_, _fly_, _walk_, _live_, &c., have  preferred to mark the distinction and call them _in_transitive; because,  say they, they do not terminate on any object expressed.    A _transitive verb_ \"expresses an action which passes from the agent to  the object; as, Caesar conquered Pompey.\" To this definition we can not  consent. It attempts a distinction where there is none. It is not true  in principle, and can not be adopted in practice.    \"Caesar conquered Pompey.\" Did the act of conquering pass _transitively_  over from _Caesar_ to Pompey? They might not have seen each other during  the whole battle, nor been within many miles of each other. They, each  of them, stood at the head of their armies, and alike gave orders to  their subordinate officers, and they again to their inferiors, and so  down, each man contending valiantly for _victory_, till, at last, the  fate of the day sealed the downfall of Pompey, and placed the crown of  triumph on the head of Caesar. The expression is a correct one, but the  action expressed by the verb \"conquered,\" is not transitive, as that  term is understood. A whole train of causes was put in operation which  finally terminated in the defeat of one, and the conquest of the other.    \"Bonaparte _lost_ the battle of Waterloo.\" What did _he_ do to _lose_  the battle? He exerted his utmost skill to _gain_ the battle and escape  defeat. He did not do a single act, he entertained not a single thought,  which lead "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17607"],[0,"Superstition In All Ages (1732) (#20)"],[1,"and wretched works; such a God and His conduct,  are they not as great mysteries as that of the incarnation? You blush,  you say, for your fellow beings who are persuaded that the God of the  universe could change Himself into a man and die upon a cross in a  corner of Asia. You consider the ineffable mystery of the Trinity very  absurd Nothing appears more ridiculous to you than a God who changes  Himself into bread and who is eaten every day in a thousand different  places.    Well! are all these mysteries any more shocking to reason than a God who  punishes and rewards men's actions? Man, according to your views, is he  free or not? In either case your God, if He has the shadow of justice,  can neither punish him nor reward him. If man is free, it is God who  made him free to act or not to act; it is God, then, who is the  primitive cause of all his actions; in punishing man for his faults, He  would punish him for having done that which He gave him the liberty to  do. If man is not free to act otherwise than he does, would not God be  the most unjust of beings to punish him for the faults which he could  not help committing? Many persons are struck with the detail of  absurdities with which all religions of the world are filled; but they  have not the courage to seek for the source whence these absurdities  necessarily sprung. They do not see that a God full of contradictions,  of oddities, of incompatible qualities, either inflaming or nursing the  imagination of men, could create but a long line of idle fancies.          CXIX.--WE DO NOT PROVE AT ALL THE EXISTENCE OF A GOD BY SAYING THAT IN  ALL AGES EVERY NATION HAS ACKNOWLEDGED SOME KIND OF DIVINITY.    They believe, to silence those who deny the existence of a God, by  telling them that all men, in all ages and in all centuries, have  believed in some kind of a God; that there is no people on the earth who  have not believed in an invisible and powerful being, whom they made the  object of their worship and of their veneration; finally, that there is  no nation, no matter how benighted we may suppose it to be, that is not  persuaded of the existence of some intelligence superior to human  nature. But can the belief of all men change an error into truth? A  celebrated philosopher has said with all reason: \"Neither general  tradition nor the unanimous consent of all men could place any  injunction upon truth.\" [Bayle.] Another wise man said before him, that  \"an army of philosophers would not be sufficient to change the nature of  error and to make it truth.\" [Averroes]    There was a time when all men believed that the sun revolved around the  earth, while the latter remained motionless in the center of the whole  system of the universe; it is scarcely more than two hundred years since  this error was refuted. There was a time when nobody would believe in  the existence of antipodes, and when they persecuted those who had the  courage to sustain it; to-day no learned man dares to doubt it. All  nations of the world, except some men less credulous than others, still  believe in sorcerers, ghosts, apparitions, spirits; no sensible man  imagines himself obliged to adopt these follies; but the most sensible  people feel obliged to believe in a universal Spirit!          CXX.--ALL THE GODS ARE OF A BARBAROUS ORIGIN; ALL RELIGIONS ARE ANTIQUE  MONUMENTS OF IGNORANCE, SUPERSTITION, AND FEROCITY; AND MODERN RELIGIONS  ARE BUT ANCIENT FOLLIES REVIVED.    All the Gods worshiped by men have a barbarous origin; they were visibly  imagined by stupid nations, or were presented by ambitious and cunning  legislators to simple and benighted people, who had neither the capacity  nor the courage to examine properly the object which, by means of  terrors, they were made to worship. In examining closely the God which  we see adored still in our days by the most civilized nations, we are  compelled to acknowledge that He has evidently barbarous features. To be  barbarous is to recognize no right but force; it is being cruel to  excess; it is but following one's own caprice; it is a lack of  foresight, of prudence, and reason. Nations, who believe yourselves  civilized! do you not perceive this frightful character of the God to  whom you offer your incense? The pictures which are drawn of Divinity,  are they not visibly borrowed from the implacable, jealous, vindictive,  blood-thirsty, capricious, inconsiderate humor of man, who has not yet  cultivated his reason? Oh, men! you worship but a great savage, whom you  consider as a model to follow, as an amiable master, as a perfect  sovereign.    The religious opinions of men in every country are antique and durable  monuments of ignorance credulity, of the terrors and the ferocity of  their ancestors. Every barbarian is a child thirsting for the wonderful,  which he imbibes with pleasure, and who never reasons upon that which he  finds proper to excite his imagination; his ignorance of the ways of  nature makes him attribute to spirits, to enchantments, to magic, all  that appears to him extraordinary; in his eyes his priests are  sorcerers, in whom he supposes an Almighty power; before whom his  confused reason humiliates itself, whose oracles are for him infallible  decrees, to contradict which would be dangerous. In matters of religion  the majority of men have remained in their primitive barbarity. Modern  religions are but follies of old times rejuvenated or presented in some  new form. If the ancient barbarians have worshiped mountains, rivers,  serpents, trees, fetishes of every kind; if the wise Egyptians worshiped  crocodiles, rats, onions, do we not see nations who believe themselves  wiser than they, worship with reverence a bread, into which they imagine  that the enchantments of their priests cause the Divinity to descend? Is  not the God-bread the fetish of many Christian nations, as little  rational in this point as that of the most barbarous nations?          CXXI.--ALL RELIGIOUS CEREMONIES BEAR THE SEAL OF STUPIDITY OR BARBARITY.    In all times the ferocity, the stupidity, the folly of savage men were  shown in religious customs which were often cruel and extravagant. A  spirit of barbarity has come down to our days; it intrudes itself into  the religions which are followed by the most civilized nations. Do we  not still see human victims offered to Divinity? In order to appease the  wrath of a God whom we suppose as ferocious, as jealous, as vindictive,  as a savage, do not sanguinary laws cause the destruction of those who  are believed to have displeased Him by their way of thinking?    Modern nations, at the instigation of their priests, have even excelled  the atrocious folly of the most barbarous nations; at least do we not  find that it never entered into a savage's mind to torment for the sake  of opinions, to meddle in thought, to trouble men for the invisible  actions of their brains? When we see polished and wise nations, such as  the English, French, German, etc., notwithstanding all their  enlightenment, continue to kneel before the barbarous God of the Jews,  that is to say, of the most stupid, the most credulous, the most savage,  the most unsocial nation which ever was on the earth; when we see these  enlightened nations divide themselves into sects, tear one another, hate  and despise each other for opinions, equally ridiculous, upon the  conduct and the intentions of this irrational God; when we see  intelligent persons occupy themselves foolishly in meditating on the  wishes of this capricious and foolish God; we are tempted to exclaim,  \"Oh, men! you are still savages! Oh, men! you are but children in the  matter of religion!\"          CXXII.--THE MORE ANCIENT AND GENERAL A RELIGIOUS OPINION IS, THE GREATER  THE REASON FOR SUSPECTING IT.    Whoever has formed true ideas of the ignorance, credulity, negligence,  and sottishness of common people, will always regard their religious  opinions with the greater suspicion for their being generally  established. The majority of men examine nothing; they allow themselves  to be blindly led by custom and authority; their religious opinions are  specially those which they have the least courage and capacity to  examine; as they do not understand anything about them, they are  compelled to be silent or put an end to their reasoning. Ask the common  man if he believes in God. He will be surprised that you could doubt it.  Then ask him what he understands by the word God. You will confuse him;  you will perceive at once that he is incapable of forming any real idea  of this word which he so often repeats; he will tell you that God is  God, and you will find that he knows neither what he thinks of Him, nor  the motives which he has for believing in Him.    All nations speak of a God; but do they agree upon this God? No! Well,  difference of opinion does not serve as evidence, but is a sign of  uncertainty and obscurity. Does the same man always agree with himself  in his ideas of God? No! This idea varies with the vicissitudes of his  life. This is another sign of uncertainty. Men always agree with other  men and with themselves upon demonstrated truths, regardless of the  position in which they find themselves; except the insane, all agree  that two and two make four, that the sun shines, that the whole is  greater than any one of its parts, that Justice is a benefaction, that  we must be benevolent to deserve the love of men, that injustice and  cruelty are incompatible with goodness. Do they agree in the same way if  they speak of God? All that they think or say of Him is immediately  contradicted by the effects which they wish to attribute to Him. Tell  several artists to paint a chimera, each of them will form different  ideas of it, and will paint it differently; you will find no resemblance  in the features each of them will have given to a portrait whose model  exists nowhere. In painting God, do any of the theologians of the world  represent "]]]
