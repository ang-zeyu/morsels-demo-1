Some of our compounds for  producing fertility may perhaps be as absurd as it would be to  give muriatic acid to a man troubled with indigestion, because  free muriatic acid is found in the stomach of a healthy person.  Let me recommend you to try both silex and magnesia in a soluble  state, and I think you will be satisfied with the benefit derived  from their use.    Recurring again to the quantity of manure necessary to grow  thirty-six bushels of wheat, I would ask, why limit yourself to so  small a crop? The difference in the cost of your manuring a field,  and my manuring it, is more than made up by the increase of  fourteen bushels of wheat and the corresponding increase of straw,  even if the land did not improve every year by the application;  and as the seed, rent, labour, and liabilities of the land are the  same whether you grow a small crop or a large one, why not have it  as large as possible? Again, if I applied far more manure than was  necessary, I ought to have had the crop equally good throughout  the field; but on the ridge of the hill, where the soil was thin  and poor, neither straw nor wheat were so good as they were where  it was deeper and richer. My own opinion is, that the plant is  never able to extract from the soil all the manure, and therefore  it ought to be brought up to a good standard before good crops can  be expected. I am not satisfied with any analogy that I can think  of, but the best that occurs to me is that of a cloth in a dye-  copper. You can never get it to absorb either all or half the  colouring matter, and if you don't use far more than is taken up  by the cloth, you will never obtain the desired results. Besides,  in chemical combinations it is desirable to use far more than the  chemical equivalents, or the experiments don't succeed. I perceive  that you intend to use guano next year, and that you intend to use  it along with the seed. I trust it will not be sowed in contact  with either the seed or the quicklime, which you proposed to use  in some of your land. The best time I have found for applying  guano is in wet weather, just when vegetation is making a start in  the spring--say the last week in March, or the first week in  April--as I fear a large part of the soluble portion of it would  be washed away by the rains of winter. It is true we have had none  this winter, but when shall we have such another? Did you ever use  woollen rags as manure? They ought to be excellent, as they are  almost all albumen, and are, I fancy, to be had at a very moderate  price, not far from you. Can you inform me what it is that causes  the land to be clover-sick? If it is the abstraction of something  from the soil, what is that something? Sir Humphrey Davy said that  a dressing of gypsum would prevent it; but clover does not succeed  here (even when dressed with gypsum), if sowed every four years.  One reason why I think so small a quantity of manure will not  succeed, is based on the theory of excrementitious secretion.  Decandolle proved that this secretion took place, but he did not  succeed in proving that it poisoned the land for a similar crop. I  can only reason from analogy, and it does not follow that an  analogy drawn from animal life will hold good when applied to  plants; but if we were to feed an animal with pure gluten and pure  starch, with the proper quantity of phosphates, &c., are we to  suppose it would have no excrements? Let this be applied to  plants: are we to suppose that the plant assimilates all that is  absorbed by its roots and leaves? When that which is absorbed is  what would enter into the composition of the plant, is it not more  rational to suppose that the inorganic and gaseous constituents  only combine in fixed proportions, and that although the plant may  absorb a much larger proportion of one than is required, the  surplus is discharged excrementitiously, and perhaps may be  unfitted for entering into the plant until it has undergone a  decomposition? In conclusion, I trust you will pardon my frankness  in so boldly canvassing your opinions; but it is in this collision  of opinion that the truth will be elicited, and if I judge you  aright, it is that you wish to discover whether it harmonizes with  your preconceived notions or not.    * * * * *    LOW MOOR, _1st May_, 1845.    HENRY BRIGGS, ESQ.    I duly received your pamphlet on the use of lime, for which I am  much obliged, and am delighted to perceive that you confirm the  idea (expressed in my pamphlet on the growth of wheat every year  on the same land) that the excessive use of lime is ultimately  injurious to the fertility of the soil to which it is applied.  This, coming from a gentleman of your reputation and experience,  will, I hope, induce someone capable of performing the experiment  to endeavour to ascertain with precision how much lime it is  desirable to apply to an acre to give the best results, and with  the least waste, assuming that the land contained little or none  previous to the experiment; and it would also be desirable to  ascertain whether it is better, in an economical point of view, to  apply a small quantity every year, or a larger quantity every  third or fourth. My own opinion is in favour of the former method,  except that it is difficult to get it ploughed in, particularly in  wet weather, immediately after spreading (which is essential where  you grow wheat on the same land every year) without injuring the  feet of the horses. You speak of ten days or a fortnight being  necessary to neutralize caustic lime, but our horses had their  feet injured by it six weeks after it had been spread on the land,  last year, although the weather had been wet almost the whole of  the time, say from the beginning of February to the middle of  March. You appear to think that lime will replace silica in the  wheat plant. Whose authority have you for this? It will be very  important to establish this supposition, but I fear it is too good  news to be true. On referring to your letter, I find you don't say  what I supposed you did, but that the lime liberates the soluble  silicates, potash, &c. This may be, and certainly the beneficial  effects of lime in growing wheat are not to be explained by any  other hypothesis with which I am acquainted. I am this year trying  some experiments to ascertain (if I can) the cause of clover-  sickness, and I hope to be in a position to say whether your  supposition that lime, gypsum, &c. will prevent it, is correct. My  experiments so far are opposed to this theory, but it is not very  safe or philosophical to draw conclusions from one or two  experiments only. I doubt the possibility of making silicate of  soda by merely mixing lime, sand, and salt together, as my  chemical friends tell me this cannot be accomplished unless the  silex and the alkali are fused together. If a soluble silicate of  soda can be made in the way you mention, it will be a great saving  of expense. Has it been tried? You have no doubt seen a report of  the enormous crop of wheat grown in a field in Norfolk last year  (90 bushels to the acre), and that the Royal Agricultural Society  have determined to have the soil analyzed by Dr. Playfair. This is  very desirable, but as Dr. Playfair is more of a lecturing than an  analyzing chemist, I think it is very necessary that his analysis  should be checked by another, made by the most eminent chemist  that Europe can produce, for 90 bushels is so unheard-of a crop,  that no expense should be spared which would enable us to  ascertain what the soil contained to enable it to produce such a  crop, which is the more remarkable as the field seems to have been  a good many years under the plough. As your Wakefield Farmers'  Club has many wealthy members in it, allow me to hint the  desirableness of your undertaking this analysis, which, if  properly performed, will be worth a thousand times more than its  cost. When you are aware that even Davy missed 16 per cent. of  alumina in one of his analyses and that the chemists of the  present day don't seem to have detected the potash which exists so  abundantly in potato-tops, you will, I think, agree how  exceedingly important it is that such analysis should be checked  by others, made without any communication between the parties. You  speak of an original letter of Liebig's appearing in the \"Farmer's  Journal.\" On what subject is it? as I have no means of referring  to the periodical in question. Does it throw any light upon the  new manure for which he is said to be taking out a patent? You  speak of humus and humic acid. What do you understand by humus?  as, according to Liebig, humus sometimes means one thing and  sometimes another, and he appears to treat it very much as modern  chemists treat phlogiston, as something which they don't  comprehend, but which they need to explain the phenomena of  vegetation. If you are a believer in humus, what is it composed  of, and how does it act in forwarding vegetation? I suppose you  will reply, By combining with oxygen and forming humic acid. But  would not the theory of the decomposition of carbon do quite as  well? I don't perceive the injurious effects of quicklime upon  grass land which you anticipate in your paper, but the contrary,  and the more caustic it is the more beneficial is its action, so  far as I can judge from my own experiments; and it is my practice  in liming grass land to spread it as soon as I can get it into the  state of flour. I shall be glad to hear the result of your  electrical experiment--at present I am rather sceptical on the  subject.    P.S.--Am I to suppose that you have abandoned the idea of manuring  an acre of wheat for thirteen shillings?    * * * * *    THE CULTIVATION OF WHEAT.    _October 1st_, 1852.

But thy death cannot now profit the dead, the beloved.  And thou hast had pity for him who took but thine aid to design thy  destruction.  His life is lost, thine is saved!\"    She spoke no more in the tongue that I could interpret.  She spoke,  in the language unknown, a few murmured words to her swarthy  attendants; then the armed men, still weeping, rose, and made a  dumb sign to me to go with them.  I understood by the sign that  Ayesha had told them to guard me on my way; but she gave no reply  to my parting thanks.      XI      I descended into the valley; the armed men followed.  The path, on  that side of the water course not reached by the flames, wound  through meadows still green, or amidst groves still unscathed.  As  a turning in the way brought in front of my sight the place I had  left behind, I beheld the black litter creeping down the descent,  with its curtains closed, and the Veiled Woman walking by its side.  But soon the funeral procession was lost to my eyes, and the  thoughts that it roused were erased.  The waves in man's brain are  like those of the sea, rushing on, rushing over the wrecks of the  vessels that rode on their surface, to sink, after storm, in their  deeps.  One thought cast forth into the future now mastered all in  the past: \"Was Lilian living still?\"  Absorbed in the gloom of that  thought, hurried on by the goad that my heart, in its tortured  impatience, gave to my footstep, I outstripped the slow stride of  the armed men, and, midway between the place I had left and the  home which I sped to, came, far in advance of my guards, into the  thicket in which the Bushmen had started up in my path on the night  that Lilian had watched for my coming.  The earth at my feet was  rife with creeping plants and many-colored flowers, the sky  overhead was half hid by motionless pines.  Suddenly, whether  crawling out from the herbage or dropping down from the trees, by  my side stood the white-robed and skeleton form--Ayesha's attendant  the Strangler.    I sprang from him shuddering, then halted and faced him.  The  hideous creature crept toward me, cringing and fawning, making  signs of humble goodwill and servile obeisance.  Again I recoiled--  wrathfully, loathingly, turned my face homeward, and fled on.  I  thought I had baffled his chase, when, just at the mouth of the  thicket, he dropped from a bough in my path close behind me.  Before I could turn, some dark muffling substance fell between my  sight and the sun, and I felt a fierce strain at my throat.  But  the words of Ayesha had warned me; with one rapid hand I seized the  noose before it could tighten too closely, with the other I tore  the bandage away from my eyes, and, wheeling round on the dastardly  foe, struck him down with one spurn of my foot.  His hand, as he  fell, relaxed its hold on the noose; I freed my throat from the  knot, and sprang from the copse into the broad sunlit plain.  I saw  no more of the armed men or the Strangler.  Panting and breathless,  I paused at last before the fence, fragrant with blossoms, that  divided my home from the solitude.    The windows of Lilian's room were darkened; all within the house  seemed still.    Darkened and silenced home, with the light and sounds of the jocund  day all around it.  Was there yet hope in the Universe for me?  All  to which I had trusted Hope had broken down; the anchors I had  forged for her hold in the beds of the ocean, her stay from the  drifts of the storm, had snapped like the reeds which pierce the  side that leans on the barb of their points, and confides in the  strength of their stems.  No hope in the baffled resources of  recognized knowledge!  No hope in the daring adventures of Mind  into regions unknown; vain alike the calm lore of the practiced  physician, and the magical arts of the fated Enchanter!  I had fled  from the commonplace teachings of Nature, to explore in her  Shadowland marvels at variance with reason.  Made brave by the  grandeur of love, I had opposed without quailing the stride of the  Demon, and my hope, when fruition seemed nearest, had been trodden  into dust by the hoofs of the beast!  And yet, all the while, I had  scorned, as a dream, more wild than the word of a sorcerer, the  hope that the old man and the child, the wise and the ignorant,  took from their souls as inborn.  Man and fiend had alike failed a  mind, not ignoble, not skill-less, not abjectly craven; alike  failed a heart not feeble and selfish, not dead to the hero's  devotion, willing to shed every drop of its blood for a something  more dear than an animal's life for itself!  What remained--what  remained for man's hope?--man's mind and man's heart thus  exhausting their all with no other result but despair!  What  remained but the mystery of mysteries, so clear to the sunrise of  childhood, the sunset of age, only dimmed by the clouds which  collect round the noon of our manhood?  Where yet was Hope found?  In the soul; in its every-day impulse to supplicate comfort and  light, from the Giver of soul, wherever the heart is afflicted, the  mind is obscured.    Then the words of Ayesha rushed over me: \"What mourner can be  consoled, if the dead die forever?\"  Through every pulse of my  frame throbbed that dread question; all Nature around seemed to  murmur it.  And suddenly, as by a flash from heaven, the grand  truth in Faber's grand reasoning shone on me, and lighted up all,  within and without.  Man alone, of all earthly creatures, asks,  \"Can the dead die forever?\" and the instinct that urges the  question is God's answer to man.  No instinct is given in vain.    And born with the instinct of soul is the instinct that leads the  soul from the seen to the unseen, from time to eternity, from the  torrent that foams toward the Ocean of Death, to the source of its  stream, far aloft from the Ocean.    \"Know thyself,\" said the Pythian of old.  \"That precept descended  from Heaven.\"  Know thyself!  Is that maxim wise?  If so, know thy  soul.  But never yet did man come to the thorough conviction of  soul but what he acknowledged the sovereign necessity of prayer.  In my awe, in my rapture, all my thoughts seemed enlarged and  illumed and exalted.  I prayed--all my soul seemed one prayer.  All  my past, with its pride and presumption and folly, grew distinct as  the form of a penitent, kneeling for pardon before setting forth on  the pilgrimage vowed to a shrine.  And, sure now, in the deeps of a  soul first revealed to myself, that the Dead do not die forever, my  human love soared beyond its brief trial of terror and sorrow.  Daring not to ask from Heaven's wisdom that Lilian, for my sake,  might not yet pass away from the earth, I prayed that my soul might  be fitted to bear with submission whatever my Maker might ordain.  And if surviving her--without whom no beam from yon material sun  could ever warm into joy a morrow in human life--so to guide my  steps that they might rejoin her at last, and in rejoining, regain  forever!    How trivial now became the weird riddle, that, a little while  before, had been clothed in so solemn an awe!  What mattered it to  the vast interests involved in the clear recognition of Soul and  Hereafter, whether or not my bodily sense, for a moment, obscured  the face of the Nature I should one day behold as a spirit?  Doubtless the sights and the sounds which had haunted the last  gloomy night, the calm reason of Faber would strip of their magical  seemings; the Eyes in the space and the Foot in the circle might be  those of no terrible Demons, but of the wild's savage children whom  I had seen, halting, curious and mute, in the light of the morning.  The tremor of the ground (if not, as heretofore, explicable by the  illusory impression of my own treacherous senses) might be but the  natural effect of elements struggling yet under a soil unmistakably  charred by volcanoes.  The luminous atoms dissolved in the caldron  might as little be fraught with a vital elixir as are the splendors  of naphtha or phosphor.  As it was, the weird rite had no magic  result.  The magician was not rent limb from limb by the fiends.  By causes as natural as ever extinguished life's spark in the frail  lamp of clay, he had died out of sight--under the black veil.    What mattered henceforth to Faith, in its far grander questions and  answers, whether Reason, in Faber, or Fancy, in me, supplied the  more probable guess at a hieroglyph which, if construed aright, was  but a word of small mark in the mystical language of Nature?  If  all the arts of enchantment recorded by Fable were attested by  facts which Sages were forced to acknowledge, Sages would sooner or  later find some cause for such portents--not supernatural.  But  what Sage, without cause supernatural, both without and within him,  can guess at the wonders he views in the growth of a blade of  grass, or the tints on an insect's wing?  Whatever art Man can  achieve in his progress through time, Man's reason, in time, can  suffice to explain.  But the wonders of God?  These belong to the  Infinite; and these, O Immortal! will but develop new wonder on  wonder, though thy sight be a spirit's, and thy leisure to track  and to solve an eternity.    As I raised my face from my clasped hands, my eyes fell full upon a  form standing in the open doorway.  There, where on the night in  which Lilian's long struggle for reason and life had begun, the  Luminous Shadow had been beheld in the doubtful light of a dying  moon and a yet hazy dawn; there, on the threshold, gathering round  her bright locks the aureole of the glorious sun, stood Amy, the  blessed child!  And as I gazed, drawing nearer and nearer to the  silenced house, and that Image of Peace on its threshold, I felt  that Hope met me at the door--Hope in the child's steadfast eyes,  Hope in the child's welcoming smile!    \"I was at watch for you,\" whispered Amy.  \"All"]]]
