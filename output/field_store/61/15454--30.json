Irene Grey presided at the urn, Bertha  handed round the cups, and a bevy of girls hung over the cake basket,  making critical and appreciative remarks.    \"Bags me that brown one, with the cream in the middle!  I've tried those  macaroons before--they are as hard as bricks!\"    \"I wish they would get cocoa-nut cakes for a change; I adore cocoa-nuts,  when they are soft and mushy.  We make them at home, and they are ever  so much nicer than the ones you buy!\"    \"That's what they call plum-cake, my love!  Case of `Brother, where art  thou?' like the Friday pudding.  Those little white fellows look  frightfully insipid.  What Rhoda would call a `kid-glove flavour,' I  should say.\"    Every one laughed at this, for it was still a matter of recent  congratulation in the house that Rhoda Chester had invented an  appropriate title for a certain mould or blancmange, which appeared at  regular intervals, and possessed a peculiar flavour which hitherto had  refused to be classified.    In a moment of inspiration, Rhoda had christened it \"Kid-Glove Jelly,\"  and the invention had been received with acclamation.  Did she say she  had never distinguished herself, had never attracted attention?  No,  surely this was wrong; for in that moment she had soared to the very  pinnacle of fame.  So long as the school endured, the name which she had  created would be handed down from generation to generation.  Alas, alas!  our ambitions are not always realised in the way we would choose!  When  one has pined to be in a first team, or to come out head in an  examination, it is a trifle saddening to be obliged to base our  reputation on--the nickname of a pudding!    Rhoda smiled brightly enough, however, at the present tribute to her  powers, and passed her cup for a third supply with undiminished  appetite.  She had been playing with her usual frantic energy, and was  tired and aching.  Her shoulders bent forward as she sat on her chair;  she shut her eyes with a little contraction of the brows; the dimple no  longer showed in her cheek; and when Bertha upset the tray upon the  floor, she started with painful violence.  Her nerves were beginning to  give way beneath the strain put upon them; but, instead of being warned,  and easing off in time, she repeated obstinately to herself:--\"Three  months more--two and a half--only two!--I can surely keep up for eight  weeks, and then there will be all the holidays for rest!\"    It seemed, indeed, looking forward, as if the world were bounded by the  coming examination, and that nothing existed beyond.  If she succeeded--  very well, it was finished!  Her mind could take in no further thought.  If she failed--clouds and darkness! chaos and destruction!  The world  would have come to an end so far as she was concerned.    It filled her with surprise to hear the girls discuss future doings in  their calm, unemotional fashion; but though she could not participate,  the subject never failed to interest.  The discussion began again now,  for it was impossible to keep away from the all-engrossing subject, and  the supposition, \"If I pass,\" led naturally to what would come  afterwards.    \"If I do well I shall go up to Newnham, and try for the Gilchrist  Scholarship--fifty pounds a year for three years.  It's vacant next  year, and I don't see why I shouldn't have it as well as anyone else,\"  said Bertha, modestly, and Tom pounded the table with her heels.    \"Go in, my beauty, go in and win!  I only wish you could wait a few  years until I am there to look after you.  I am going to be Principal of  Newnham one of these fine days, and run it on my own lines.  No work,  and every comfort--breakfast in bed, and tea in the grounds--nothing to  do but wait upon me and pander to my wishes!\"    \"I daresay!  So like you, Tom!  You would be a terror, and work the  girls to death.  You are never tired yourself, so you would keep them  going till they dropped.  I pity the poor creatures who came under your  rule, but most likely you will never be tried.  You may be first  mistress, or second, or third, but it's not likely you'll ever be a  Principal!\"    \"It's not likely at all, it's positive sure,\" retorted Tom calmly.  \"Principals, like poets, are born not made, and the cause can't afford  to lose me.  I don't say for a certainty it will be Newnham; it may  possibly be Girton, or Somerville, or Lady Margaret Hall, but one of the  two or three big places it's bound to be.  No one shall call me  conceited, but I know my own powers, and I intend that other people  shall know them too.  Education is my sphere, and I intend to devote my  life to the advancement of my sex.  Pass the cake, someone!  I haven't  had half enough.  Yes, my vocation is among women.  You will hardly  believe me, my dears, but men don't seem to appreciate me, somehow!  There is a `Je-ne-sais-quoi' in my beauty which doesn't appeal to them a  mite.  But girls adore me.  I've a fatal fascination for them which they  can't withstand.  There's Rhoda there--she intended to hate me when she  first came, and now she adores the ground I tread on.  Don't you, Fuzzy?  You watch her smile, and see if it's not true!  Very well, then; I see  plainly what Providence intends, and I'm going straight towards that  goal.\"    \"And it is what you would like?  You would choose it if you had the  choice?\"    \"Rather, just!  It's the dream of my life.  There is nothing in all the  world that I should like so much.\"    Pretty Dorothy sighed, and elevated her eyebrows.    \"Well--I wouldn't.  I enjoy school very much, and want to do well while  I am here, but when I leave, I never want to do another hour's study.  If I thought I had to teach, I should go crazy.  I should like to have a  good time at home for a few years, and then--yes, I should!--I should  like to marry a nice man who loved me, and live in the country--and have  a dear little home of my own.  Now, I suppose you despise me for a poor-  spirited wretch; but it's true, and I can't help it.\"    But Tom did not look at all scornful.  She beamed at the speaker over  her slice of plum-cake, and cried blandly--    \"Bless you, no!  It's quite natural.  You are that sort, my dear, and I  should not have believed you if you had said anything else.  You'll  marry, of course, and I'll come and visit you in the holidays, and  you'll say to `Him,' `What a terrible old maid Thomasina has grown!' and  I'll say to myself, `Poor, dear old Dorothy, she is painfully domestic!'  and we will both pity each other, and congratulate ourselves on our own  escape.  We have different vocations, you and I, and it would be folly  to try to go the same way.\"    \"You are happy creatures it you are _allowed_ to go your own way,\" said  Bertha sadly.  \"I'm not, and that's just the trouble.  I'm not a star,  like Tom, but I love work, and want to do some good with my education.  I should be simply miserable settling down at home with no occupation  but to pay calls, or do poker work and sewing; yet that's what my  parents expect me to do.  They are rich, and can't understand why I  should want to work when there is no necessity.  I may persuade them to  send me abroad for a year or so for languages and music, but even then I  should be only twenty, and I can't settle down to vegetate at twenty.  It's unreasonable to send a girl to a school where she is kept on the  alert, body and mind, every hour of the day, and then expect her to be  content to browse for the rest of her life!  Now, what ought one to do  in my position?  _I_ want one thing; _they_ want another.  Whose duty is  it to give way?\"    She looked at Tom as she spoke, but Tom swung her feet to and fro, and  went on munching plum-cake and staring into space with imperturbable  unconsciousness.  Bertha called her sharply to attention.    \"Tom! answer, can't you?  I was speaking to you.\"    \"Rather not, my dear.  Ask someone else; some wise old Solomon who has  had experience.\"    \"No, thank you.  I know beforehand what he would say.  `Submission, my  child, submission!  Parents always know best.  Young people are always  obstinate and hot-headed.  Be ruled!  Be guided!  In time to come you  will see'--Yah!\" cried Bertha, with a sudden outburst of irritation.  \"I'm sick of it!  I've had it dinned into my ears all my life, and I  want to hear someone appreciate the other side for a change.  I'm young;  I've got all my life to live.  If I were a boy I should be allowed to  choose.  Surely! surely, I ought to have _some_ say in my own affairs!  Don't shirk now, Tom, but speak out and say what you think.  If you are  going to be a Principal you ought to be able to give advice, and I  really do need it!\"    \"Ye-es!\" said Tom slowly.  \"But you needn't have given me such a poser  to start with.  It's a problem my dear, that has puzzled many a girl  before you, and many a parent, too.  The worst of it is that there is so  much to be said on both sides.  I could make out an excellent brief for  each; and, while I think of it, it wouldn't be half a bad subject to  discuss some day at our Debating Society: `To what extent is a girl  justified in deciding on her own career, in opposition to the wishes of  her parents?'  Make a note of that someone, will you?  It will come in  usefully.  I'm thankful to say my old dad and I see eye to eye about my  future, but if he didn't--it would be trying!  I hate to see girls  disloyal to their parents, and if the `revolt of the daughters' were the  only outcome of higher education I should say the sooner we got back to  deportment and the use of the globes the better for all concerned.  But  it wasn't all peace and concord even in the old days.  Don't tell me  that half a dozen daughters sat at home making bead mats in the front  parlour, and never had ructions with their parents or themselves!  They  quarrelled like cats, my dears, take my word for it, and were ever so  much less happy and devoted than girls are now,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21111"],[0,"Wild Nature Won By Kindness (#20)"],[1," to roll itself up into a ball on the slightest  provocation, and even Mr. Jamrach's argument that if I got tired of it  as a pet I could have it cooked, as they were excellent eating, failed  to lead me to a purchase. There was a fine, healthy toucan, with his  marvellous bill, looking sadly out of place in a small cage in such a  dingy place. Did he ever think of his tropical forest home, I wondered,  and wish himself in happier surroundings? A long wooden box with wire  front contained rows and rows of Grass Parrakeets: many hundreds must  have been on those perches, one behind the other, poor little patient  birdies, sitting in solemn silence, never moving an inch, for they were  wedged in as closely as they could sit and how they could eat and live  seemed a mystery. As I was in quest of some small rodents I was asked to  follow Mr. Jamrach to another place where the animals were kept. We came  to a back yard with dens and cages containing all kinds of tenants, from  fierce hyenas and wolves to tame deer, monkeys, cats, and dogs. A chorus  of yelps and barks and growls sounded a little uninviting, and a caution  from Jamrach, to mind the camel did not seize my young friend's hat,  made us aware of a stately form gazing down upon us from a recess we had  not before noticed. Every nook and corner seemed occupied, and in order  to see a kangaroo rat I was invited up a rickety ladder into a loft  where a Japanese cat, a large monkey, and sundry other creatures lived.  I did not take to the kangaroo rat, he was too large and formidable to  be pleasant, and was by no means tame, but to be pulled out of the cage  by his long tail was, I confess, enough to scare the mildest quadruped.  At length I was shown some Peruvian guinea-pigs. Wonderful little  creatures! With hair three or four inches long, white, yellow and black,  set on anyhow, sticking out in odd tufts, one side of their heads white  and the other black, their eyes just like boot buttons, they _were_  captivating; and a pair had to be chosen forthwith, and packed in a  basket with a tortoise and a huge Egyptian lizard, and with these spoils  I was not sorry to leave this place of varied noises and smells. The  lizard was about fourteen inches long, a really grand creature. He came  from the ruins of ancient Egypt, and looked in his calm stateliness as  though he might have gazed upon the Pharaohs themselves. When placed in  the sun for a time he would sometimes deign to move a few inches, his  massive, grey, scaly body looking very like a young crocodile. I was  greatly teased about my fondness for \"Rameses,\" as I called this new and  majestic pet; there was a great fascination about him, and as I really  wished to know more of his ways and habits, I carried the basket in  which he lived everywhere with me indoors and out, and studied all  possible ways of feeding him; but alas! nothing would induce him to eat.  After gazing for five minutes at the most tempting mealworm, he would at  last raise up his mighty head and appear to be revolving great ideas to  which mealworms and all sublunary things must give place. Jamrach told  me that the lizard would drink milk, so a saucerful was placed before  him, and once he did drink a few drops, but generally he walked into and  over the saucer as if it did not exist.    I believe the poor creature had been without food so long that it had  lost the power of taking nourishment, and to my great regret I found it  grew weaker and thinner, and at last it died, and all I could do was to  send the remains to a naturalist to be preserved somewhat after the  fashion of its great namesake.    The odd little guinea-pigs were named Fluff and Jamrach, and were a  source of much amusement. As they could not agree, and as the fights  grew serious, Jamrach was banished to the stable and Fluff occupied a  cage in the dining-room. When let out it was curious to see how he would  always keep close to the sides of the room--never would he venture into  the middle, the protection of the skirting board seemed indispensable,  and when let out under the tulip-tree he ran round the trunk in the same  way, only occasionally making an excursion to the edge of the branches  which rested on the ground, the space beyond was a _terra incognita_  which could not be explored by the timid little beastie.    There the two little guinea-pigs enjoyed a happy life on fine days and  grew to be friends at last, grunting little confidences one to the other  and going to sleep side by side. They had to be watched and their  liberty a good deal curtailed when we found a weasel began to appear  upon the scene, and as it is proverbially difficult to catch a weasel  either awake or asleep, he has not at present been captured. I much fear  if he ever attacked the little Peruvians they would stand a poor chance  of their lives, for they have no idea of self-defence and would fall an  easy prey to such a fierce, relentless persecutor. Perhaps the gardener  may devise some way of trapping the wary little creature, so that my  little friends may dwell in peace under the shady tree.    As the winter came on the cold prevented Fluff going out-of-doors, and  he led a most inactive life. I don't think he ever had more than two  ideas in his little brain--he just lived to eat and sleep, and was about  as interesting as a stuffed animal would have been. He is the only  instance of any animal I have ever known who seemed to be literally  without a single habit, apparently without affection, without a temper  good or bad, with no wishes or desires except to be let alone to doze  away his aimless life.    [Illustration]          [Illustration]    HOW TO OBSERVE NATURE      There is all the difference between taking a walk simply for exercise,  for some special errand, or to enjoy conversation with one's friends,  and the sort of quiet observant stroll I am going to ask my kind readers  to take with me to-day.    This beautiful world is full of wonders of every kind, full of evidences  of the Great Creator's wisdom and skill in adapting each created thing  to its special purpose. The whole realm of nature is meant, I believe,  to _speak to us_, to teach us lessons in parables--to lead our hearts  upward to God who made us and fitted us also for our special place in  creation.    In the nineteenth Psalm David speaks of the two great books God has  given us for our instruction. In the first six verses he speaks of the  teachings of the book of nature and the rest of the Psalm deals with the  written Word of God.    We acknowledge and read the Scriptures as the book which reveals the  will of God and His wondrous works for the welfare of mankind, but how  many fail to give any time or thought to reading the book of nature!  Thousands may travel and admire beautiful scenery, and derive a certain  amount of pleasure from nature, just glancing at each object, but really  observing nothing, and thus failing to learn any of the lessons this  world's beauty is intended to teach, they might almost as well have  stayed at home save for the benefit of fresh air and change of scene.  The habit of minute and careful observation is seldom taught in  childhood, and is not very likely to be gained in later life when the  mind is filled with other things. Yet if natural objects are presented  attractively to the young, how quickly they are interested! Question  after question is asked, and unconsciously a vast amount of information  may be conveyed to an intelligent child's mind by a simple, happy little  chat about some bird or insect. This is _admirably_ shown in a chapter  on Education in the Life of Mrs. Sewell. I would strongly urge every  mother to read and follow the advice there given.    We will now start for our garden walk. We have not taken many steps  before we are led to pause and inquire why there should be little  patches of grey-looking mud in the small angles of the brickwork of the  house. Opening one of the patches with a penknife we find a hollow cell,  and in it some green caterpillars just alive but not able to crawl. Now  I see that the cell is the work of one of the solitary mason wasps; she  brings the material, forms the cell, and when nearly finished lays her  egg at the bottom and provides these half-killed caterpillars as food  for the young grub when it is hatched, and by the time they are eaten  the grub becomes a pupa and then hatches into a young wasp to begin life  on its own account. One day I saw a bee go into a hole in the brickwork  of the house, and getting my net I waited to capture it; after about  five minutes the bee came out and flew into the net. It proved to be a  solitary mason bee, and was doubtless forming a place to lay its egg,  only, unlike the wasp, she would give the young grub pollen from the  stamens of flowers to feed upon instead of green caterpillars. I  remember seeing a mass of clay which had been formed into a wasp's nest  by one of the solitary species, under the flap of a pembroke table in an  unused room. A maid in dusting lifted up the flap, and down fell a  quantity of fine, dry mud with young grubs in it which would soon have  hatched into wasps, and revealed their rather strange nesting-place. I  have in my collection a very interesting hornet's nest, which was being  constructed in the hollow of an old tree. I happened to notice a hornet  fly into the opening, and, looking in, there was a small beginning of a  nest. It hung from a kind of stalk and consisted of only eight cells,  each having an egg at the bottom. I captured the two hornets, and though  I watched for a long time no others ever came, so I imagine they were  the founders of what would have been a colony in due time.    But we have been kept a long time engaged with these mason wasps. Let us  start for our walk. As we take our way through the garden we cannot help  noticing the happy songs of the different birds, all in full activity  preparing"]]]
