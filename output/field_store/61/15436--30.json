We've got about half an hour before the radiation  will reach lethal intensity. It has a very short half-life, though; only  about twelve minutes. If we spend an hour in here, we'll be safe enough.  Did you have any trouble putting the radiation counter out of  commission?\"    So in half an hour they would all be dead. Ringg, Rugel, Captain  Vorongil. Two dozen Lhari, all dead so that Montano could have a Lhari  ship to play with.    And what then? More killing, more murder? Would Montano start killing  everyone who tried to get the secret of the drive from him? The Lhari  had the star-drive; maybe it belonged to them, maybe not. Maybe humans  had a right to have it, too. But this wasn't the right way. Maybe they  didn't deserve it.    He turned to look at Montano. The man was leaning back, whistling softly  through his teeth. He felt like telling Montano that he couldn't go  through with it. He started to speak, then stopped, his blood icing  over.    _If I try to argue with him, I'll never get out of here alive. It means  too much to him._    _Do I just salve my conscience with that then? Sit here and let them  die?_    With a shock of remembrance, it came to Bart that he had a weapon. He  was armed, this time, with the energon-beam that was part of his  uniform. Montano had evidently forgotten it. _Could_ he kill Montano?  Even to save two dozen Lhari?    He reached hesitantly toward the beam-gun, quickly thumbed the catch  down to the lowest point, which was simple shock. He froze as Montano  looked in his direction, hand out of sight under his cloak.    \"How many Lhari on board?\"    \"Twenty-three, and three Mentorians.\"    \"Anyone apt to be behind shielding--say, in the drive chamber?\"    \"No, I think they're all outside.\"    Montano nodded, idly. \"Then we won't have to worry.\"    Bart slipped his hand toward his weapon. Montano saw the movement,  cocked his head in question; then, as understanding flashed over his  face, his hand darted to his own gun. But Bart had pressed the charge of  his, and Montano slumped over without a cry. He looked so limp that Bart  gasped. Was he dead? Hastily he fumbled the lax hand for a pulse. After  a long, endless moment he saw Montano's chest twitch and knew the man  was breathing.    Well, Montano would be safe here in the bunker. Hastily, Bart looked at  his timepiece. Half an hour before the radiation was lethal--_for the  Lhari_. Was it already, for him? Shakily, he unfastened the door. He ran  out into the glare, seeing as he ran that his badge was tinged with an  ever-darkening, gold, orange....    Montano had said there was a safety margin, but maybe he was wrong,  maybe all Bart would accomplish would be his own death! He ran back  along the line of bunkers, his heart pounding with his racing feet. Two  crewmen came along the line, young white-crested Lhari from the other  watch. He gasped, \"Where is the captain?\"    \"Down that way--what's wrong, Bartol?\" But Bart was gone, his muscles  aching with the unaccustomed effort inside gravity. Putting on speed, he  saw the tall, austere shape of Vorongil, his banded cloak dark against  the glaring light. Vorongil turned, startled, at the sound of his  running feet.    Suddenly, Bart realized that he was still holding his energon-ray. In  shock and revulsion, he dropped it at Vorongil's feet.    \"Captain, go warn the men! They'll all be dead in half an hour! There  are lethal radiations--\"    \"_What?_ Are you sunstruck?\"    Bart stopped cold. Never once had it crossed his mind what he would say  to Vorongil or how he would make the captain believe his story, without  revealing Montano. He started to hold up his badge, realized the Lhari  captain could not see color, and dropped it again, while Vorongil bent  over to pick up the fallen gun. \"Are you sunstruck or mad, Bartol?  What's this babble?\"    \"Captain, everybody on the _Swiftwing_--\"    \"And speak Lhari!\" Vorongil demanded, and Bart realized that in his  excitement he had been shouting in Universal. He drew a long, deep  breath.    \"Captain, there are lethal radiations being released here,\" he said.  \"You have just barely half an hour to gather all the men and get them  behind shielding.\"    \"The radiation counter is out of order,\" Vorongil remarked, unruffled.  \"How can you possibly know--\"    Bart stood in despair. Could he say, _A ship has landed here?_ Could he  say, _Check that bunker?_ Even if Montano was a would-be murderer, he  was human, and Bart could not betray him to the Lhari. There had been  too much betrayal. His voice rose in sudden hysteria.    \"Captain, there's no time! I tell you, you'll all be dead if you don't  believe me! Get the men into the ship! Get them behind shielding and  _then_ check my story! I'm not--\" he had gone this far, he might as well  go the whole way--\"_I'm not a Lhari!_\"    _\"What?\"_    One of the crewmen came dashing up, his crest sweat-streaked. \"Captain!  Rugel has collapsed! We don't know what's wrong with him.\"    \"Radiation sickness,\" said Bart, and Vorongil reached out, catching his  shoulder in a cruel taloned grip. Bart said desperately \"I'm not a  Lhari! I signed on in disguise--I knew they meant to take the ship, but  I can't let you all die.    \"How can I make you believe me? Here--\" In desperation, Bart reached up.  Pain stabbed his eyeballs, fierce, blinding, as he pulled out one of the  contact lenses. He could not see the captain's face through the light,  but suddenly two Lhari were holding his arms. The fear of death was on  Bart, but it no longer mattered. He saw through watering eyes the  ever-deepening orange of the badge disappearing.    \"Here,\" he said, tearing at it, \"radiation. You must be able to see how  dark it is. Even if it's just darkness....\"    Suddenly Vorongil was shouting, but Bart could not hear. Two men were  dragging him along. They hustled him up the ramp of the ship. He could  see again, but his eyes were blurred, and he felt sick, colors spinning  before his eyes, a nauseated ringing in his head.    At first he thought it was his ears ringing; then he made out the  rising, shrieking wail and fall of the emergency siren, steps running,  shouting voices, the slow clang of the doors. Someone was pushing at  him, babbling words in Lhari, but he heard them through an  ever-increasing distance: Vorongil's face bent over his, only a blurred  crimson blob that flashed away like a vanishing star in the viewport. It  flamed out into green darkness, vanished, and Bart fell through what  seemed to be a bottomless chasm of starless night.           *       *       *       *       *    When he woke, acceleration had its crushing hand on his chest. He tried  to move, discovered that he was strapped hard into a bunk, and fainted  again.    Suddenly the pressure was gone and he was lying at ease on the smooth  sheets of a hospital bunk. His eyes were covered with a light bandage,  and there was a sharp pain in his left arm. He tried to move it and  found it was tied down.    \"I think he's coming round,\" said Vorongil's voice.    \"Yes, and a lot too soon for me,\" said a bitter voice which Bart  recognized as that of the ship's medic. \"Freak!\"    \"Listen, Baldy,\" said Vorongil, \"whoever he is, he could have been  blinded or killed. You wouldn't be alive now if it wasn't for that  _freak_, as you call him. Bartol, can you hear me? How much light can  your eyes stand?\"    \"As much as any Mentorian.\" Bart found he could move his right arm, and  twitched the bandage away. Vorongil and the medic stood over him; in the  other infirmary bunk a form was lying, covered with a white sheet.  Sickly, Bart wondered if they had found Montano. Vorongil followed the  direction of his eyes.    \"Yes,\" he said, and his voice held deep bitterness, \"poor old Rugel is  dead. He didn't get much of the radiation, but his heart wouldn't stand  it, and gave out.\" He bowed his head. \"He was bald in the service of the  ships when my crest was new-sprouted,\" he said in deep grief.    Bart felt the shock of that, even through his own fear. He looked down  at his left arm. It was strapped to a splint, and fluid was dripping  slowly into the vein there.    Vorongil nodded. \"I expect you feel pretty sick. You got a good dose of  radiation yourself, but we've given you a couple of transfusions--one of  the Mentorians matched your blood type, fortunately. It was a close  call.\"    The medic was looking down in ill-disguised curiosity. \"Fantastic,\" he  said. \"I don't suppose you'd tell me who changed your looks. I admit I  wouldn't believe it until I had a look at your foot bones under the  fluoroscope.\"    Vorongil said quietly, \"Bartol--I don't suppose that's your real  name--why did you do it?\"    \"I couldn't see you all die, sir,\" Bart said, not expecting them to  believe him. \"No more than that.\"    The medic said roughly in Lhari, \"It's a trick, sir, no more. A trick to  make us trust him!\"    \"Why would he risk his own life then?\" Vorongil asked. \"No, it's more  than that.\" He hesitated. \"We checked the bunkers--in radiation  suits--before we took off. We found a man in one of them.\"    \"Was he dead?\" Bart whispered.    \"No,\" Vorongil said quietly.    \"Thank God!\" It was a heartfelt explosion. Then, apprehensively, \"Or did  you kill him?\"    \"What do you think we are?\" Vorongil said incredulously. \"Indeed no. His  own men have probably found him by now. I don't imagine he got half as  much radiation as you did.\"    Bart surveyed the needle in his arm. \"Why are you taking all this  trouble if I'm going to be put out of the way?\"    \"You must have some funny ideas about us,\" Vorongil said shaking his  head. \"That would be a fine way to reward you for saving all of our  lives. No, you're not going to be killed.\"    \"If I had my way--\" the old medic began, and suddenly Vorongil flew into  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2082"],[0,"Memoirs of the Comtesse Du Barry (#20)"],[1,"intrigue. He told the  king every thing that came into his head: he told him one day, that the  Choiseuls boasted that he, the king of France, never dared introduce his  mistress into the state apartments at Versailles.    \"Yes,\" added the duke, \"they boast so loudly, that nothing else is  talked of in the province; and at Bordeaux, for instance, there is one  merchant who, on the strength of the enemies of the comtesse, has made a  bet that she will never be presented.\"    \"And why do you not imprison these persons?\" inquired the king, angrily.    \"Because, sire, it appears to me injustice to punish the echo of the  fooleries of Paris.\"    \"I will conduct myself as regards the presentation of madame du Barry  in the manner which I think best. But is it not an inconceivable  contrariety, that one party should wish it with the utmost desire,  and another place every obstacle in the way? In truth, I am very  unfortunate, and a cruel tyranny is exercised over me.\"    The duc de Richelieu, not wishing to appear as one of the tyrants of the  king, gave a different turn to the conversation.    My presentation was, however, a matter of first-rate importance to me  and to my partizans, and the duc de la Vrilliere was gained over to my  side, by making him believe that the king would yield to my desires, and  that then I should remember all those who opposed my elevation. The duc  d'Aiguillon also drew over to my party M. Bertin, who bore no love to  the Choiseuls, and who saw that the preponderance of interest was on  my side of the scale. When I was assured of a considerable number of  defenders, I thought I might venture on the master stroke, and thus I  went to work.    One evening the king was with me, and the MM. de Maupeou and de  Richelieu were there also. We were discoursing of different things, and  the king was perfectly tranquillized, little anticipating the scene that  was in store for him. I rose suddenly from my arm-chair, and going up to  his majesty, after a profound courtesy cast myself at his feet. Louis XV  would have raised me, but I said,    \"No, I will remain where I am until you have accorded me the favor I  ask.\"    \"If you remain in this posture I shall place myself in a similar one.\"    \"Well, then, since you will not have me at your knees I will place  myself on them\"; and I seated myself in his lap without ceremony.    \"Listen to me, sire,\" I said, \"and repeat what I say to the king of  France word for word. He must authorize my presentation; for else, some  fine day, in the presence of the whole court, I will go to the state  apartments, and try whether I shall be repulsed at the door.\"    \"Will she have the boldness?\" inquired the king to the chancellor.    \"I have no doubt of it, sire. A female, young, beautiful, honored with  your kindness, may venture to do anything.\"    \"Is it not distressing to me,\" I added, \"that, graced with your  majesty's favors, I remain thus concealed, whilst women whom you detest  annoy you with their presence.\"    \"Madame is right,\" replied the duc de Richelieu, \"and I see that you  look for her every evening where she is not, and where she ought to be.\"    \"What! you too, duc de Richelieu, do you join the cry of the  chancellor?\"    \"I would tear out the eyes of these gentlemen,\" I added, \"if they  thought differently from me.\"    \"Oh,\" said the king, laughing, \"this punishment would not be one for M.  Maupeou: justice ought to be blind: and as for you, M. de Richelieu, you  have your _baton_ left.\"    \"Which he has nobly gained,\" I replied, \"by fighting against your  majesty's enemies, and of which he still continues worthy, by now  defending me from my foes.\"    \"This rebellion,\" said the king, \"cannot last, and I see myself  compelled to hold a _lit de justice_ (a judicial sitting or bed).\"    \"And I swear to you, that I will receive nobody into mine until I have  been presented.\"    This sally amused the king, who said, \"Well, since it must be so, you  shall be presented.\"    At this I leaped on the king's neck, giving a cry which might have been  heard by my rivals. After that, I advanced to the two gentlemen who had  advocated my cause so well, extending a hand to each, which they took  and kissed with great gallantry.    Louis XV became thoughtful, and continued to mutter between his teeth,  \"I wash my hands of it--they will cry out, they will clamor, but it must  be so.\" I saw the feelings of the king, and took care not to allow him  to go away in this state. Whilst I sought to compose him by my caresses,  the duc de Richelieu told us one of his thousand and one adventures,  which he told so well. I know not if it will please you, but such as it  is I shall give you an abridgment of it.    \"I was, you know,\" he began, \"a very good-looking, a very wild fellow:  women have no objection to this. I was travelling, and in my way thro'  D----, M., the intendant of the city, insisted on my taking up my abode  at his house. His lady added her entreaties, and I consented. I must  tell you that the lady was handsome. I had passed the night with her;  but when, on the next morning, as I sought to go out of her apartment, I  found the outer door double locked and bolted. I looked round me on all  sides, but found no egress. Whilst I was lamenting this with the lady's  _femme-de-chambre_, who was nearly as much distressed as her mistress,  I saw in a detached closet a great many machines covered with paper, and  all of different shapes. On inquiry, I was informed that the following  Monday was the lady's birthday, which they were to celebrate with  fireworks. I looked at the beautiful fusees and brilliant suns with  much admiration. Suddenly, thinking of the lady's honor which might be  compromised, I took a light and set fire to a Roman candle; in a  moment the whole was in flames, and everybody took alarm. Great was the  consternation in the house, which was turned out of windows; and in the  uproar, the house-door being broken open, a crowd of persons rushed in;  I ran this way and that way; everybody admired and praised my exertions.  I was compelled to quit the house at last, and ordered my carriage,  whilst M. the intendant was thanking me for the vast service I had  rendered him. I assure you, sire, that I never laughed more heartily.\"*         *The duc de Richelieu preserved his coolness and       talent at repartee in the most trivial circumstances.       The story is well known of the man who came to       ask for his aid, saying they were related.  \"How?\"       asked the duke.  \"Sir, by Adam.\"  \"Give this man a       penny,\" said the duke, turning to a gentleman of his       train; \"and if all of his relations give him as much       he will soon be a richer man than I am.\"         If our readers will turn to \"Joe Miller,\" Page 45,       they will find this jest attributed to the witty       duke of Buckingham.  It is a very good joke for a       duke, but savors more of a desire to be witty than       to be charitable.         (translator)    This tale amused the king, and M. de Richelieu assured him that he had  never told it before. A thousand considerations had induced him to keep  it to himself until the present time. \"But now,\" said he, \"the third  generation of madame l'intendante is no longer young, and I have no fear  of being called out to fight a duel.\"    Next day there was a general rumor of my presentation. My friends  asserted that I had the king's promise. This was imprudent on their  part, and they injured my interest whilst they flattered my vanity. They  put the Choiseul cabal to work, who intrigued so well that not a person  could be found who would perform the office of introductress. You  know the custom: the presentation is effected by the intermediation of  another lady, who conducts the person to be presented to the princesses,  and introduces her. This custom had passed into a law, and it would have  been too humiliating to me to have dispensed with it.    This was a dire blow for me: it distressed me sadly, and I wept over it  with my friends. The duc de Richelien said to me,    \"With money and promises everything can be managed at court. There is no  place where they know better how to value complaisance, and the price at  which it is sold. Do not give yourself any uneasiness; we shall find the  lady we want.\"    And we did find her, but her compliance was dearly bought. Two ladies  who were applied to stipulated for most outrageous conditions. One, the  marquise de Castellane, consented to present me, but demanded that she  should be created a duchess, and have a gift of five hundred thousand  livres: the other, whose name I forget, asked for her husband the order  of the Holy Ghost and a government, a regiment for her son, and for  herself I forget what. These ladies seemed to think, like Don Quixote  and Sancho Panza, that governments and five hundred thousand livres  were to be picked up on the highway. In truth, they spoke out without  disguise.    At this juncture the chancellor had a singular conversation concerning  me with the Choiseuls. He had been one morning to call on the duke, and  whilst they were discoursing, the duchesse de Grammont came into her  brother's apartment, and entered at once into conversation.    \"Ah, my lord, I am glad to see you. Your new friends carry you off from  your old ones. You are wrong to adore the rising sun.\"    \"That was the idolatry of a great number of persons: but I beg of you to  be so very kind as not to speak to me in figures, if you would wish me  to understand you.\"    \"Oh, you play off the ignorant. You know as well as I do what I mean,  and your daily visits to this _fille_.\"    \"Which, madame? There are so many at court!\"    This sarcastic reply made the brother and sister smile; both of them  being fully competent to understand the merit of an epigram. The duke  fearing lest the duchess should go too far, judging by what she had  already said, thus addressed him:    \"Yo"]]]
