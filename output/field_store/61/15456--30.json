Don't you see that the consulship of which we  thought so much, which Curio used of old to call an apotheosis, if this  Afranius is elected, will become a mere farce and mockery? Therefore I  think one should play the philosopher, as you in fact do, and not care a  straw for your consulships!    You say in your letter that you have decided not to go to Asia. For my  part I should have preferred your going, and I fear that there may be  some offence[108] given in that matter. Nevertheless, I am not the man  to blame you, especially considering that I have not gone to a province  myself. I shall be quite content with the inscriptions you have placed  in your Amaltheium,[109] especially as Thyillus has deserted me and  Archias written nothing about me. The latter, I am afraid, having  composed a Greek poem on the Luculli, is now turning his attention to  the Caecilian drama.[110] I have thanked Antonius on your account, and I  have intrusted the letter to Mallius. I have heretofore written to you  more rarely because I had no one to whom I could trust a letter, and was  not sure of your address. I have puffed you well. If Cincius should  refer any business of yours to me, I will undertake it. But at present  he is more intent on his own business, in which I am rendering him some  assistance. If you mean to stay any length of time in one place you may  expect frequent letters from me: but pray send even more yourself. I  wish you would describe your Amaltheium to me, its decoration and its  plan; and send me any poems or stories you may have about  Amaltheia.[111] I should like to make a copy of it at Arpinum. I will  forward you something of what I have written. At present there is  nothing finished.

The juries  were now made up of three _decuriae_--senators, equites, and _tribuni  aerarii_. But the exact meaning of _tribuni aerarii_ is not known, beyond  the fact that they formed an _ordo_, coming immediately below the  equites. Possibly they were old tribal officers who had the duty of  distributing pay or collecting taxes (to which the translation supposes  a punning reference), and as such were required to be of a _census_  immediately below that of the equites. I do not profess to be satisfied,  but I cannot think that Professor Tyrrell's proposal makes matters much  easier--_tribuni non tam aerarii, ut appellantur, quam aerati_; for his  translation of _aerati_ as \"bribed\" is not better supported, and is a  less natural deduction than \"moneyed.\"]    [Footnote 98: _I.e._, the Athenians.

His calling Crassus his \"panegyrist\" is  explained by Letter XIX, pp. 33-34.]    [Footnote 102: C. Curio, the elder, defended Clodius.

Atticus is making in his house something like what Cicero  had made in his, and called his academia or gymnasium.

And yet I was  already aware, as I saw that you also, when you took leave of me, were  beginning to suspect, that there was some lurking dissatisfaction, that  his feelings were wounded, and that certain unfriendly suspicions had  sunk deep into his heart. On trying on several previous occasions, but  more eagerly than ever after the allotment of his province, to assuage  these feelings, I failed to discover on the one hand that the extent of  his offence was so great as your letter indicates; but on the other I  did not make as much progress in allaying it as I wished. However, I  consoled myself with thinking that there would be no doubt of his seeing  you at Dyrrachium, or somewhere in your part of the country: and, if  that happened, I felt sure and fully persuaded that everything would be  made smooth between you, not only by conversation and mutual  explanation, but by the very sight of each other in such an interview.  For I need not say in writing to you, who know it quite well, how kind  and sweet-tempered my brother is, as ready to forgive as he is sensitive  in taking offence. But it most unfortunately happened that you did not  see him anywhere. For the impression he had received from the artifices  of others had more weight with him than duty or relationship, or the  old affection so long existing between you, which ought to have been the  strongest influence of all. And yet, as to where the blame for this  misunderstanding resides, I can more easily conceive than write: since I  am afraid that, while defending my own relations, I should not spare  yours. For I perceive that, though no actual wound was inflicted by  members of the family, they yet could at least have cured it. But the  root of the mischief in this case, which perhaps extends farther than  appears, I shall more conveniently explain to you when we meet. As to  the letter he sent to you from Thessalonica,[113] and about the language  which you suppose him to have used both at Rome among your friends and  on his journey, I don't know how far the matter went, but my whole hope  of removing this unpleasantness rests on your kindness. For if you will  only make up your mind to believe that the best men are often those  whose feelings are most easily irritated and appeased, and that this  quickness, so to speak, and sensitiveness of disposition are generally  signs of a good heart; and lastly--and this is the main thing--that we  must mutually put up with each other's gaucheries (shall I call them?),  or faults, or injurious acts, then these misunderstandings will, I hope,  be easily smoothed away. I beg you to take this view, for it is the  dearest wish of my heart (which is yours as no one else's can be) that  there should not be one of my family or friends who does not love you  and is not loved by you.    That part of your letter was entirely superfluous, in which you mention  what opportunities of doing good business in the provinces or the city  you let pass at other times as well as in the year of my consulship: for  I am thoroughly persuaded of your unselfishness and magnanimity, nor did  I ever think that there was any difference between you and me except in  our choice of a career. Ambition led me to seek official advancement,  while another and perfectly laudable resolution led you to seek an  honourable privacy. In the true glory, which is founded on honesty,  industry, and piety, I place neither myself nor anyone else above you.  In affection towards myself, next to my brother and immediate family, I  put you first. For indeed, indeed I have"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21254"],[0,"In Africa: Hunting Adventures in the Big Game Country (#20)"],[1,"were lots of people  saying that I was a drunkard, and that I could never do any work until I  had emptied a bottle or two of liquor.\"    We told him that we had heard these rumors frequently during the closing  months of his administration, and he laughed.    \"I never drank whisky,\" he said; \"not from principle, but because I  don't like it. I seldom drink wine, because I'm rather particular about  the kind of wine I drink. We have some champagne with us, but the  thought of drinking hot champagne in this country is unpleasant.  Sometimes, when I can get wines that just suit my taste, I drink a  little, but never much. The three drinks of brandy are all I've had in  Africa, and I'm sure that I've not taken one in the last four months.  They had all sorts of stories out about me before I left  Washington--that I was drinking hard and that I was crazy. I may be  crazy,\" he said, laughing, \"but I most certainly haven't been drinking  hard.\"    The luncheon was a merry affair. Heller had been out in the swamp in  front of the camp and had shot some ducks for luncheon.    \"On my way in,\" said the colonel, \"I shot an oribi, but when I heard  that Heller had shot some ducks I knew that my oribi would not be  served.\"    It was evident that the most thorough good fellowship existed among the  members of the colonel's party. His fondness for all of them was in  constant evidence--in the way he joked with them and in the complete  absence of restraint in their attitude toward him.    \"They were told that I would be a hard man to get along with in the  field,\" Colonel Roosevelt said, \"but we've had a perfectly splendid time  together.\"    I asked him whether he had been receiving newspapers, and, if not,  whether he would like to see some that I had received from home. He  answered that he had not seen any and really didn't want to see any.    \"I don't believe in clinging to the tattered shreds of former  greatness,\" he said, laughing.    He had not heard that Governor Johnson, of Minnesota, had died, and when  we told him he said that Johnson would undoubtedly have been the  strongest presidential candidate the Democrats could have nominated the  next time. He wanted to know where he could address a note of sympathy  to Mrs. Johnson.    Later, in speaking of a prominent public man who loudly disclaimed  responsibility for an act committed by a subordinate, he said:    \"It would have been far better to have said nothing about it, but let  people think he himself had given the order. Very often subordinates say  and do things that are credited to their superiors, and it is never good  policy to try to shift the blame. Do you remember the time Root was in  South America? Well, some president down there sent me a congratulatory  telegram which reached Washington when I was away. Mr. ---- of the state  department answered it in my name and said that I and 'my people' were  pleased with the reception they were giving Mr. Root. Well, the New York  _Sun_ took the matter up and when the fleet went around the world they  referred to it as 'my fleet,' and that 'my fleet' had crossed 'my  equator' four times and 'my ocean' a couple of times. It was very  cleverly done and some people began to call for a Brutus to curb my  imperialistic tendencies.\"    [Drawing: _Writing His Adventures While They're Hot_]    He told a funny story about John L. Sullivan, who came to the White  House to intercede for a nephew who had got into trouble in the navy.  John L. told what a nice woman the boy's mother was and what a terrible  disgrace it would be for himself and his family if the boy was dropped  from the navy. \"Why, if he hadn't gone into the navy he might have  turned out very bad,\" said John L.; \"taken up music or something like  that.\"    We also told him that some of the American papers were keeping score on  the game he had killed, and that whenever the cable reported a new  victim the score up to date would be published like a base-ball  percentage table. In the last report he was quoted as having killed  seven lions, while Kermit had killed ten. This seemed to amuse him very  much, although the figures were not strictly accurate. His score was  nine and Kermit's eight up to date. He was also amused by the habit the  American papers have of calling him \"Bwana Tumbo,\" which means \"The  Master with the Stomach,\" a title that did not fit him nearly so  appropriately then as it might have done before he began his active days  in the hunting field. He said, so far as he knew, the porters called him  \"Bwana Mkubwa,\" which means \"Great Master,\" and is applied to the chief  man of a _safari_, regardless of who or what he is. It is merely a title  that is always used to designate the boss. We told him that many natives  we had met would invariably refer to him as the Sultana Mkubwa, or Great  Sultan, because they had heard that he was a big chief from America.    He also laughingly quoted the attitude of Wall Street as expressed in  the statement that they \"hoped every lion would do his duty.\"    Later, in speaking generally of the odd experiences he had had in  Africa, he spoke of one that will surely be regarded as a nature fake  when he tells it. It was an experience that he and Cuninghame had with a  big bull giraffe which they approached as it slept. When they were  within ten feet of it it opened its eyes and stared at them. A slight  movement on their part caused it to strike out with its front foot, but  without rising. Then, as they made no offensive moves, it continued to  regard them sleepily and without fear. Even when they threw sticks at it  it refused to budge, and it was only after some time that it was chased  away, where it came to a stop only fifty yards off.    \"I suppose W.J. Long will call that a nature fake,\" he said, \"and I wish  that I had had a camera with me so that I could have photographed it.  I'm afraid they won't believe Cuninghame, because they don't know him.\"    In the course of the luncheon the conversation ranged from politics,  public men, his magazine work, some phases of Illinois politics, as  involved in the recent senatorial election, his future plans of the  present African trip and many of the little experiences he had had since  arriving in the country. Much that was said was of such frankness,  particularly as to public men, as to be obviously confidential.    [Photograph: Kermit Led the Way to the Elephant Camp]    [Photograph: The Elephants' Skulls Were Saved]    [Photograph: Removing an Elephant's Skin]    He was asked whether he had secured, among his trophies, any new species  of animal that might be named after him. In Africa there is a custom  of giving the discoverer's name to any new kind or class of animal  that is killed. For instance, the name \"granti\" is applied to the  gazelle first discovered by the explorer Grant. \"Thompsoni\" is applied  to the gazelle discovered by Thompson. \"Cokei\" is the name given the  hartebeest discovered by Coke, and so on. If Colonel Roosevelt had  discovered a new variation of any of the species it would be called the  \"Roosevelti ----.\"    The colonel said that he had not discovered any new animals, but that  Heller, he thought, had found some new variety of mouse or mole on Mount  Kenia. He supposed that it would be called the Mole Helleri.    He then told about an exciting adventure they had with a hippo two  nights before. Away in the night the camp was aroused by screams coming  from the big swamp in front. Kongoni, his gunbearer, rushed in and  shouted: \"Lion eat porter!\" The colonel grabbed his gun and dashed out  in the darkness. Kermit and one or two others, hastily armed, also  appeared, and they charged down the swamp, where a hippo had made its  appearance in the neighborhood of a terrified porter. Kermit dimly made  out the hippo and shot at it, but it disappeared and could not be found  again.    After luncheon the colonel said, \"Now, I want to inflict my pigskin  library on you,\" and together we went into his tent and he opened an  oilcloth-covered, aluminum-lined case that was closely packed with  books, nearly all of which were bound in pigskin. It was a present from  his sister, Mrs. Douglas Robinson. The tent was lined with red,  evidently Kermit's darkroom when he was developing pictures. A little  table stood at the open flaps of the entrance and upon it were writing  materials, with which Mr. Roosevelt already had started to write up the  elephant hunt of the day before. His motto seems to be, \"Do it now, if  not sooner.\"    [Drawing: _The Pigskin Library_]    I sat on his cot, Mrs. Akeley on a small tin trunk, and Stephenson on  another. The colonel squatted down on the floor cloth of the tent and  began to show us one by one the various literary treasures from his  pigskin library. The whole box of books was so designed that it weighed  only sixty pounds, and was thus within the limit of a porter's load.  Some of the books were well stained from frequent use and from contact  with the contents of his saddle-bags. Whenever he went on a hunt he  carried one or more of these little volumes, which he would take out and  read from time to time when there was nothing else to do. He never  seemed to waste a moment.    His pride in the library was evident, and the fondness with which he  brought forth the books was the fondness of an honest enthusiast.    \"Some people don't consider Longfellow a great poet, but I do,\" he said,  as he showed a little volume of the poet's works. \"Lowell is represented  here, but I think, toward the end of his life, he became too much  Bostonian. The best American,\" he said later, \"is a Bostonian who has  lived ten years west of the Mississippi.\"    He then showed us his work-box, a compact leather case containing pads  of paper, pens, lead pencils, and other requirements of the writer. I  did not see a type-writing machine such as we cartoonists have so often  represented in our cartoons of Mr."]]]
