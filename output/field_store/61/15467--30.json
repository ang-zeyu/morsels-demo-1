An old philosopher, whom Marville invited  to see a collection of landscapes by a celebrated artist, replied,  \"Landscapes I prefer seeing in the country itself, but I am fond of  contemplating the pictures of illustrious men.\" This opinion has some  truth; Lord Orford preferred an interesting portrait to either landscape  or historical painting. \"A landscape, however excellent in its  distributions of wood, and water, and buildings, leaves not one trace in  the memory; historical painting is perpetually false in a variety of  ways, in the costume, the grouping, the portraits, and is nothing more  than fabulous painting; but a real portrait is truth itself, and calls  up so many collateral ideas as to fill an intelligent mind more than any  other species.\"    Marville justly reprehends the fastidious feelings of those ingenious  men who have resisted the solicitations of the artist, to sit for their  portraits. In them it is sometimes as much pride as it is vanity in  those who are less difficult in this respect. Of Gray, Fielding, and  Akenside, we have no heads for which they sat; a circumstance regretted  by their admirers, and by physiognomists.    To an arranged collection of PORTRAITS, we owe several interesting  works. Granger's justly esteemed volumes originated in such a  collection. Perrault's _Eloges_ of \"the illustrious men of the  seventeenth century\" were drawn up to accompany the engraved portraits  of the most celebrated characters of the age, which a fervent love of  the fine arts and literature had had engraved as an elegant tribute to  the fame of those great men. They are confined to his nation, as  Granger's to ours. The parent of this race of books may perhaps be the  Eulogiums of Paulus Jovius, which originated in a beautiful CABINET,  whose situation he has described with all its amenity.    Paulus Jovius had a country house, in an insular situation, of a most  romantic aspect. Built on the ruins of the villa of Pliny, in his time  the foundations were still to be traced. When the surrounding lake was  calm, in its lucid bosom were still viewed sculptured marbles, the  trunks of columns, and the fragments of those pyramids which had once  adorned the residence of the friend of Trajan. Jovius was an enthusiast  of literary leisure: an historian, with the imagination of a poet; a  Christian prelate nourished on the sweet fictions of pagan mythology.  His pen colours like a pencil. He paints rapturously his gardens bathed  by the waters of the lake, the shade and freshness of his woods, his  green hills, his sparkling fountains, the deep silence, and the calm of  solitude. He describes a statue raised in his gardens to NATURE; in his  hall an Apollo presided with his lyre, and the Muses with their  attributes; his library was guarded by Mercury, and an apartment devoted  to the three Graces was embellished by Doric columns, and paintings of  the most pleasing kind. Such was the interior! Without, the pure and  transparent lake spread its broad mirror, or rolled its voluminous  windings, by banks richly covered with olives and laurels; and in the  distance, towns, promontories, hills rising in an amphitheatre blushing  with vines, and the elevations of the Alps covered with woods and  pasturage, and sprinkled with herds and flocks.    In the centre of this enchanting habitation stood the CABINET, where  Paulus Jovius had collected, at great cost, the PORTRAITS of celebrated  men of the fourteenth and two succeeding centuries. The daily view of  them animated his mind to compose their eulogiums. These are still  curious, both for the facts they preserve, and the happy conciseness  with which Jovius delineates a character. He had collected these  portraits as others form a collection of natural history; and he pursued  in their characters what others do in their experiments.    One caution in collecting portraits must not be forgotten; it respects  their authenticity. We have too many supposititious heads, and ideal  personages. Conrad ab Uffenbach, who seems to have been the first  collector who projected a methodical arrangement, condemned those  spurious portraits which were fit only for the amusement of children.  The painter does not always give a correct likeness, or the engraver  misses it in his copy. Goldsmith was a short thick man, with wan  features and a vulgar appearance, but looks tall and fashionable in a  bag-wig. Bayle's portrait does not resemble him, as one of his friends  writes. Rousseau, in his Montero cap, is in the same predicament.  Winkelmann's portrait does not preserve the striking physiognomy of the  man, and in the last edition a new one is substituted. The faithful  Vertue refused to engrave for Houbraken's set, because they did not  authenticate their originals; and some of these are spurious, as that of  Ben Jonson, Sir Edward Coke, and others. Busts are not so liable to  these accidents. It is to be regretted that men of genius have not been  careful to transmit their own portraits to their admirers: it forms a  part of their character; a false delicacy has interfered. Erasmus did  not like to have his own diminutive person sent down to posterity, but  Holbein was always affectionately painting his friend. Montesquieu once  sat to Dassier the medallist, after repeated denials, won over by the  ingenious argument of the artist; \"Do you not think,\" said Dassier,  \"that there is as much pride in refusing my offer as in accepting it?\"      FOOTNOTES:    [Footnote 22: Impressions have been taken from plates engraved by the  ancient Egyptians; and one of these, printed by the ordinary  rolling-press, was exhibited at the Great Manchester Exhibition, 1857;  it being for all practical purposes similar to those executed in the  present day.]          DESTRUCTION OF BOOKS.      The literary treasures of antiquity have suffered from the malice of Men  as well as that of Time. It is remarkable that conquerors, in the moment  of victory, or in the unsparing devastation of their rage, have not been  satisfied with destroying _men_, but have even carried their vengeance  to _books_.    The Persians, from hatred of the religion of the Phoenicians and the  Egyptians, destroyed their books, of which Eusebius notices a great  number. A Grecian library at Gnidus was burnt by the sect of  Hippocrates, because the Gnidians refused to follow the doctrines of  their master. If the followers of Hippocrates formed the majority, was  it not very unorthodox in the Gnidians to prefer taking physic their own  way? But Faction has often annihilated books.    The Romans burnt the books of the Jews, of the Christians, and the  Philosophers; the Jews burnt the books of the Christians and the Pagans;  and the Christians burnt the books of the Pagans and the Jews. The  greater part of the books of Origen and other heretics were continually  burnt by the orthodox party. Gibbon pathetically describes the empty  library of Alexandria, after the Christians had destroyed it. \"The  valuable library of Alexandria was pillaged or destroyed; and near  twenty years afterwards the appearance of the _empty shelves_ excited  the regret and indignation of every spectator, whose mind was not  totally darkened by religious prejudice. The compositions of ancient  genius, so many of which have irretrievably perished, might surely have  been excepted from the wreck of idolatry, for the amusement and  instruction of succeeding ages; and either the zeal or avarice of the  archbishop might have been satiated with the richest spoils which were  the rewards of his victory.\"    The pathetic narrative of Nicetas Choniates, of the ravages committed by  the Christians of the thirteenth century in Constantinople, was  fraudulently suppressed in the printed editions. It has been preserved  by Dr. Clarke; who observes, that the Turks have committed fewer  injuries to the works of art than the barbarous Christians of that age.    The reading of the Jewish Talmud has been forbidden by various edicts,  of the Emperor Justinian, of many of the French and Spanish kings, and  numbers of Popes. All the copies were ordered to be burnt: the intrepid  perseverance of the Jews themselves preserved that work from  annihilation. In 1569 twelve thousand copies were thrown into the flames  at Cremona. John Reuchlin interfered to stop this universal destruction  of Talmuds; for which he became hated by the monks, and condemned by the  Elector of Mentz, but appealing to Rome, the prosecution was stopped;  and the traditions of the Jews were considered as not necessary to be  destroyed.    Conquerors at first destroy with the rashest zeal the national records  of the conquered people; hence it is that the Irish people deplore the  irreparable losses of their most ancient national memorials, which their  invaders have been too successful in annihilating. The same event  occurred in the conquest of Mexico; and the interesting history of the  New World must ever remain imperfect, in consequence of the unfortunate  success of the first missionaries. Clavigero, the most authentic  historian of Mexico, continually laments this affecting loss. Everything  in that country had been painted, and painters abounded there as scribes  in Europe. The first missionaries, suspicious that superstition was  mixed with all their paintings, attacked the chief school of these  artists, and collecting, in the market-place, a little mountain of these  precious records, they set fire to it, and buried in the ashes the  memory of many interesting events. Afterwards, sensible of their error,  they tried to collect information from the mouths of the Indians; but  the Indians were indignantly silent: when they attempted to collect the  remains of these painted histories, the patriotic Mexican usually buried  in concealment"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2162"],[0,"Anarchism and Other Essays (#20)"],[1,"make good.  And how is he to do it  with ten, fifteen, or twenty years' imprisonment before him?  The  hope of liberty and of opportunity is the only incentive to life,  especially the prisoner's life.  Society has sinned so long against  him--it ought at least to leave him that.  I am not very sanguine  that it will, or that any real change in that direction can take  place until the conditions that breed both the prisoner and the  jailer will be forever abolished.         Out of his mouth a red, red rose!       Out of his heart a white!       For who can say by what strange way       Christ brings his will to light,       Since the barren staff the pilgrim bore       Bloomed in the great Pope's sight.      [1] CRIME AND CRIMINALS.  W. C. Owen.    [2] THE CRIMINAL, Havelock Ellis.    [3] THE CRIMINAL.    [4] THE CRIMINAL.    [5] THE CRIMINAL.          PATRIOTISM: A MENACE TO LIBERTY      What is patriotism?  Is it love of one's birthplace, the place of  childhood's recollections and hopes, dreams and aspirations?  Is it  the place where, in childlike naivety, we would watch the fleeting  clouds, and wonder why we, too, could not run so swiftly?  The place  where we would count the milliard glittering stars, terror-stricken  lest each one \"an eye should be,\" piercing the very depths of our  little souls?  Is it the place where we would listen to the music of  the birds, and long to have wings to fly, even as they, to distant  lands?  Or the place where we would sit at mother's knee, enraptured  by wonderful tales of great deeds and conquests?  In short, is it  love for the spot, every inch representing dear and precious  recollections of a happy, joyous, and playful childhood?    If that were patriotism, few American men of today could be called  upon to be patriotic, since the place of play has been turned into  factory, mill, and mine, while deafening sounds of machinery have  replaced the music of the birds.  Nor can we longer hear the tales of  great deeds, for the stories our mothers tell today are but those of  sorrow, tears, and grief.    What, then, is patriotism?  \"Patriotism, sir, is the last resort of  scoundrels,\" said Dr. Johnson.  Leo Tolstoy, the greatest  anti-patriot of our times, defines patriotism as the principle that  will justify the training of wholesale murderers; a trade that  requires better equipment for the exercise of man-killing than the  making of such necessities of life as shoes, clothing, and houses; a  trade that guarantees better returns and greater glory than that of  the average workingman.    Gustave Herve, another great anti-patriot, justly calls patriotism a  superstition--one far more injurious, brutal, and inhumane than  religion.  The superstition of religion originated in man's inability  to explain natural phenomena.  That is, when primitive man heard  thunder or saw the lightning, he could not account for either, and  therefore concluded that back of them must be a force greater than  himself.  Similarly he saw a supernatural force in the rain, and in  the various other changes in nature.  Patriotism, on the other hand,  is a superstition artificially created and maintained through a  network of lies and falsehoods; a superstition that robs man of his  self-respect and dignity, and increases his arrogance and conceit.    Indeed, conceit, arrogance, and egotism are the essentials of  patriotism.  Let me illustrate.  Patriotism assumes that our globe is  divided into little spots, each one surrounded by an iron gate.  Those who have had the fortune of being born on some particular spot,  consider themselves better, nobler, grander, more intelligent than  the living beings inhabiting any other spot.  It is, therefore, the  duty of everyone living on that chosen spot to fight, kill, and die  in the attempt to impose his superiority upon all the others.    The inhabitants of the other spots reason in like manner, of course,  with the result that, from early infancy, the mind of the child is  poisoned with blood-curdling stories about the Germans, the French,  the Italians, Russians, etc.  When the child has reached manhood, he  is thoroughly saturated with the belief that he is chosen by the Lord  himself to defend HIS country against the attack or invasion of any  foreigner.  It is for that purpose that we are clamoring for a  greater army and navy, more battleships and ammunition.  It is for  that purpose that America has within a short time spent four hundred  million dollars.  Just think of it--four hundred million dollars  taken from the produce of the PEOPLE.  For surely it is not the rich  who contribute to patriotism.  They are cosmopolitans, perfectly at  home in every land.  We in America know well the truth of this.  Are  not our rich Americans Frenchmen in France, Germans in Germany, or  Englishmen in England?  And do they not squander with cosmopolitan  grace fortunes coined by American factory children and cotton slaves?  Yes, theirs is the patriotism that will make it possible to send  messages of condolence to a despot like the Russian Tsar, when any  mishap befalls him, as President Roosevelt did in the name of HIS  people, when Sergius was punished by the Russian revolutionists.    It is a patriotism that will assist the arch-murderer, Diaz, in  destroying thousands of lives in Mexico, or that will even aid in  arresting Mexican revolutionists on American soil and keep them  incarcerated in American prisons, without the slightest cause or  reason.    But, then, patriotism is not for those who represent wealth and  power.  It is good enough for the people.  It reminds one of the  historic wisdom of Frederic the Great, the bosom friend of Voltaire,  who said: \"Religion is a fraud, but it must be maintained for the  masses.\"    That patriotism is rather a costly institution, no one will doubt  after considering the following statistics.  The progressive increase  of the expenditures for the leading armies and navies of the world  during the last quarter of a century is a fact of such gravity as to  startle every thoughtful student of economic problems.  It may be  briefly indicated by dividing the time from 1881 to 1905 into  five-year periods, and noting the disbursements of several great  nations for army and navy purposes during the first and last of those  periods.  From the first to the last of the periods noted the  expenditures of Great Britain increased from $2,101,848,936 to  $4,143,226,885, those of France from $3,324,500,000 to  $3,455,109,900, those of Germany from $725,000,200 to $2,700,375,600,  those of the United States from $1,275,500,750 to $2,650,900,450,  those of Russia from $1,900,975,500 to $5,250,445,100, those of Italy  from $1,600,975,750 to $1,755,500,100, and those of Japan from  $182,900,500 to $700,925,475.    The military expenditures of each of the nations mentioned increased  in each of the five-year periods under review.  During the entire  interval from 1881 to 1905 Great Britain's outlay for her army  increased fourfold, that of the United States was tripled, Russia's  was doubled, that of Germany increased 35 per cent., that of France  about 15 per cent., and that of Japan nearly 500 per cent.  If we  compare the expenditures of these nations upon their armies with  their total expenditures for all the twenty-five years ending with  1905, the proportion rose as follows:    In Great Britain from 20 per cent. to 37; in the United States from  15 to 23; in France from 16 to 18; in Italy from 12 to 15; in Japan  from 12 to 14.  On the other hand, it is interesting to note that the  proportion in Germany decreased from about 58 per cent. to 25, the  decrease being due to the enormous increase in the imperial  expenditures for other purposes, the fact being that the army  expenditures for the period of 1901-5 were higher than for any  five-year period preceding.  Statistics show that the countries in  which army expenditures are greatest, in proportion to the total  national revenues, are Great Britain, the United States, Japan,  France, and Italy, in the order named.    The showing as to the cost of great navies is equally impressive.  During the twenty-five years ending with 1905 naval expenditures  increased approximately as follows: Great Britain, 300 per cent.;  France 60 per cent.; Germany 600 per cent.; the United States 525 per  cent.; Russia 300 per cent.; Italy 250 per cent.; and Japan, 700 per  cent.  With the exception of Great Britain, the United States spends  more for naval purposes than any other nation, and this expenditure  bears also a larger proportion to the entire national disbursements  than that of any other power.  In the period 1881-5, the expenditure  for the United States navy was $6.20 out of each $100 appropriated  for all national purposes; the amount rose to $6.60 for the next  five-year period, to $8.10 for the next, to $11.70 for the next, and  to $16.40 for 1901-5.  It is morally certain that the outlay for the  current period of five years will show a still further increase.    The rising cost of militarism may be still further illustrated by  computing it as a per capita tax on population.  From the first to  the last of the five-year periods taken as the basis for the  comparisons here given, it has risen as follows: In Great Britain,  from $18.47 to $52.50; in France, from $19.66 to $23.62; in Germany,  from $10.17 to $15.51; in the United States, from $5.62 to $13.64; in  Russia, from $6.14 to $8.37; in Italy, from $9.59 to $11.24, and in  Japan from 86 cents to $3.11.    It is in connection with this rough estimate of cost per capita that  the economic burden of militarism is most appreciable.  The  irresistible conclusion from available data is that the increase of  expenditure for army and navy purposes is rapidly surpassing the  growth of population in each of the countries considered in the  present calculation.  In other words, a continuation of the increased  demands"]]]
