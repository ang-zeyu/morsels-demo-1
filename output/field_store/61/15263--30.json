The  two brothers de Caen belonged to the reformed religion.    Dolu advised Champlain to restrain the hands of the clerks of the old  company, and to seize all the merchandise in the magazine. He claimed  that although this measure was rigorous, it was justified by the fact  that the company had not fulfilled its obligations towards the  settlement of New France. De Villemenon's letter was dictated in much  the same terms. Guillaume de Caen gave notice that he would soon arrive  in Quebec with arms and stores for the settlement. Dolu's letter  regarding the seizure of merchandise was couched in terms that might be  considered imperative, nevertheless Champlain deemed it prudent to act  with caution, and he therefore had conferred with Father George Le  Baillif and Captain Dumay[18] on the subject.    The elder clerk had some clerks under him at Quebec, who after hearing  of the contents of Dolu's letter, were prepared to resist any  curtailment of their rights. Champlain appeased them, and assured them  that they would be allowed freedom of trading at least until the arrival  of Guillaume de Caen, the extent of whose authority was not yet known.    Caumont, the chief clerk, declared that he was satisfied with this  arrangement, but nevertheless the situation was difficult. If the king  had given the order to confiscate the merchandise, then Dumay, whose  visit to Canada was for the purpose of fur trading, would become the  king of commerce in New France, and therefore he had nothing to lose in  awaiting de Caen's arrival. He proceeded at once to Tadousac, but  instead of meeting de Caen, he found that Pont-Grave had arrived as the  representative of the old company, and that he had with him seventy-five  men and some clerks.    Champlain was much distressed on receiving these tidings, for he foresaw  a conflict which would possibly entail bloodshed. The clerks also were  despondent. In order to avoid a quarrel, Champlain deemed it advisable  to protect his men, and he therefore installed his brother-in-law,  Eustache Boulle, and Captain Dumay with sixteen men, in the small fort  which he had erected at Cape Diamond during the preceding year.  Champlain defended himself within the habitation, where he quartered all  the men he could dispose of. If the clerks were inclined to fight he  would defend his position, but he hoped that these precautionary  measures would prove the means of preventing bloodshed.    On May 7th, 1621, three of the clerks of Guillaume de Caen left Tadousac  and took up their quarters near the habitation. Father Le Baillif and  Jean Baptiste Guers asked them to produce their papers. They declared  that they had authority to trade from the old Company of Rouen, which  still existed through articles agreed to by the Duke of Montmorency, and  that a trial was at present pending between the two societies. On  receiving this information from Father Le Baillif, Champlain decided to  allow five clerks the necessary merchandise for trading; they were,  however, told that the old company had been dissolved, and that the new  company only was invested with authority to trade. The clerks were  satisfied with Champlain's decision, but they objected to the presence  of armed soldiers in the fort, which they claimed was not in accordance  with the king's commands. The clerks finally went to Three Rivers to  carry on their trade.    On June 13th, Pont-Grave arrived at Quebec. Here he was questioned as  to his authority, although he was treated with the respect and courtesy  due to his age and character. Pont-Grave assured Champlain that the  disputes between the two companies would be resolved in a friendly way,  and that he had received news to this effect before he sailed from  Honfleur. He then started for Three Rivers to join his clerks.    Some days after these events, a clerk named Rouvier, in the employ of de  Caen, arrived with letters from Dolu, de Villemenon, and Guillaume de  Caen, and left a copy of an order-in-council in favour of the old  company. Champlain also received a letter from the king. The  order-in-council granted permission to both companies to trade during  the year 1621, provided that both should contribute equally towards the  maintenance of the captains, soldiers, and the inhabitants of Quebec.    Foreseeing a conflict between de Caen and Pont-Grave, Champlain went to  Tadousac, and advised de Caen to respect Pont-Grave's authority. De Caen  replied that he could not do so, as he had received authority privately  from the king. Champlain therefore assured the commandment to  Pont-Grave's vessel, in order to protect his old friend, and thus it  happened that this affair which threatened to produce serious  consequences, was smoothed over through Champlain's intervention.  Pont-Grave then took possession of his vessel in the presence of de  Caen, who offered no opposition, and a few days after they both returned  to France.    De Caen had promised to send twenty-five men to Quebec, but he sent only  eighteen. A certain quantity of stores was also brought to Quebec at  this time by Jacques Halard, and a number of halberds, arquebuses,  lances, and many barrels of powder, which were delivered in the presence  of Jean Baptiste Varin, who had been sent by Guillaume de Caen, and  Guers.    Father Georges Le Baillif also left for France during the autumn, as a  delegate from the inhabitants of the settlement, who had prepared a  memorandum of their grievances. This document was signed by Champlain,  Father Jamet, Father Le Caron, Louis Hebert, Guillaume Couillard,  Eustache Boulle, Pierre Reye, Olivier Le Tardif, J. Groux, Pierre  Desportes, Nicholas and J.B. Guers. On his arrival in France, Father Le  Baillif had an interview with the king, and placed the memorandum in  question in His Majesty's hands. The king admitted that the complaints  were well founded, but at the same time he stated that it was impossible  to grant all that was requested. The Huguenots were to retain their  commercial liberty, and Champlain obtained some supplies, and his  salary, which was formerly six hundred livres, was increased to twelve  hundred.    Father Le Baillif's mission was unfruitful, for he brought word of the  amalgamation of the two companies, whose chiefs were Guillaume de Caen,  Ezechiel de Caen, and their nephew, Emery de Caen. The order-in-council  establishing this large company granted to them the liberty of trading  in New France, and all French subjects were eligible for admission to  the society. By this arrangement the de Caens were obliged to pay the  sum of ten thousand livres to the members of the old Rouen association,  and a sum equal to the value of their goods, barques and canoes. The old  company received five-twelfths of the Company of Montmorency,  one-twelfth of which was reserved by de Monts, who was at that time  living at his residence in Saintonge. By this latter arrangement,  however, the de Caens were relieved from the payment of the ten thousand  livres imposed upon them by the order-in-council. When Father Le Baillif  returned to Quebec in the spring of 1622, all the old rivalry had  disappeared. The Company of Rouen had adopted the name of the Company of  Montmorency with the de Caens as chiefs.    The principal articles stipulated in the agreement were:--    1. Champlain to be lieutenant of the viceroy, with precedence on land,  and to command the habitation of Quebec, and to have command of all the  French residents in New France. Ten men were also to be placed at his  disposal, who were to be maintained at the expense of de Caen, who was  also to pay to each an annual sum of twenty livres.    2. The company was also to maintain six Recollet fathers, two of whom  were to be engaged in missions to the savages.    3. The company was to support and maintain six families of labourers,  carpenters and masons, during the period of the agreement, the families  to be changed every two years.    4. The company was to pay the sum of twelve hundred francs as a salary  to Champlain.    5. Champlain was to enjoy the privilege of trading for eleven years, and  to this term the king added another eleven years.    The first man to bring the news of a change of authority was a clerk  named Santein, but it was confirmed some days after by the arrival of  Pont-Grave and Guillaume de Caen, who were accompanied by a clerk named  Le Sire, an underclerk named Thierry-Desdames,[19] and Raymond de la  Ralde. De Caen handed to Champlain a letter from the king, who advised  him to recognize the authority of the new company, and also to endeavour  to maintain peace and harmony. When de Caen had completed his trading at  Three Rivers he sailed again for France, leaving Pont-Grave as chief  clerk at Quebec, and Le Baillif as underclerk at Tadousac.    In order to establish good order throughout the country, Champlain  published certain ordinances, which should be regarded as the first code  of Canadian laws. Although it was desirable to maintain peace, it was  also necessary to prepare to resist the attacks of the Iroquois, who  were becoming more and more active. A party of the Iroquois had  approached Quebec, and were observed to be rambling in the vicinity of  the Recollets' convent, on the north shore of the River St. Charles.  They finally made an attack, but they were repulsed with loss by the  French and the Montagnais, whose chief was Mahicanaticouche, Champlain's  friend. This chief was the son of the famous Anadabijou, who had  contracted the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17149"],[0,"Creative Chemistry: Descriptive of Recent Achievements in the Chemical (#20)"],[1," want to do it as a business unless it pays and it  will not pay unless the manufacturing process is cheaper than the  natural process. This depends primarily upon the cost of the crude  materials. What, then, is the market price of these four elements?  Oxygen and nitrogen are free as air, and as we have seen in the second  chapter, their direct combination by the electric spark is possible.  Hydrogen is free in the form of water but expensive to extricate by  means of the electric current. But we need more carbon than anything  else and where shall we get that? Bits of crystallized carbon can be  picked up in South Africa and elsewhere, but those who can afford to buy  them prefer to wear them rather than use them in making synthetic food.  Graphite is rare and hard to melt. We must then have recourse to the  compounds of carbon. The simplest of these, carbon dioxide, exists in  the air but only four parts in ten thousand by volume. To extract the  carbon and get it into combination with the other elements would be a  difficult and expensive process. Here, then, we must call in cheap  labor, the cheapest of all laborers, the plants. Pine trees on the  highlands and cotton plants on the lowlands keep their green traps set  all the day long and with the captured carbon dioxide build up  cellulose. If, then, man wants free carbon he can best get it by  charring wood in a kiln or digging up that which has been charred in  nature's kiln during the Carboniferous Era. But there is no reason why  he should want to go back to elemental carbon when he can have it  already combined with hydrogen in the remains of modern or fossil  vegetation. The synthetic products on which modern chemistry prides  itself, such as vanillin, camphor and rubber, are not built up out of  their elements, C, H and O, although they might be as a laboratory  stunt. Instead of that the raw material of the organic chemist is  chiefly cellulose, or the products of its recent or remote destructive  distillation, tar and oil.    It is unnecessary to tell the reader what cellulose is since he now  holds a specimen of it in his hand, pretty pure cellulose except for the  sizing and the specks of carbon that mar the whiteness of its surface.  This utilization of cellulose is the chief cause of the difference  between the modern world and the ancient, for what is called the  invention of printing is essentially the inventing of paper. The Romans  made type to stamp their coins and lead pipes with and if they had had  paper to print upon the world might have escaped the Dark Ages. But the  clay tablets of the Babylonians were cumbersome; the wax tablets of the  Greeks were perishable; the papyrus of the Egyptians was fragile;  parchment was expensive and penning was slow, so it was not until  literature was put on a paper basis that democratic education became  possible. At the present time sheepskin is only used for diplomas,  treaties and other antiquated documents. And even if your diploma is  written in Latin it is likely to be made of sulfated cellulose.    The textile industry has followed the same law of development that I  have indicated in the other industries. Here again we find the three  stages of progress, (1) utilization of natural products, (2) cultivation  of natural products, (3) manufacture of artificial products. The  ancients were dependent upon plants, animals and insects for their  fibers. China used silk, Greece and Rome used wool, Egypt used flax and  India used cotton. In the course of cultivation for three thousand years  the animal and vegetable fibers were lengthened and strengthened and  cheapened. But at last man has risen to the level of the worm and can  spin threads to suit himself. He can now rival the wasp in the making of  paper. He is no longer dependent upon the flax and the cotton plant, but  grinds up trees to get his cellulose. A New York newspaper uses up  nearly 2000 acres of forest a year. The United States grinds up about  five million cords of wood a year in the manufacture of pulp for paper  and other purposes.    In making \"mechanical pulp\" the blocks of wood, mostly spruce and  hemlock, are simply pressed sidewise of the grain against wet  grindstones. But in wood fiber the cellulose is in part combined with  lignin, which is worse than useless. To break up the ligno-cellulose  combine chemicals are used. The logs for this are not ground fine, but  cut up by disk chippers. The chips are digested for several hours under  heat and pressure with acid or alkali. There are three processes in  vogue. In the most common process the reagent is calcium sulfite, made  by passing sulfur fumes (SO_{2}) into lime water. In another process a  solution of caustic of soda is used to disintegrate the wood. The third,  known as the \"sulfate\" process, should rather be called the sulfide  process since the active agent is an alkaline solution of sodium sulfide  made by roasting sodium sulfate with the carbonaceous matter extracted  from the wood. This sulfate process, though the most recent of the  three, is being increasingly employed in this country, for by means of  it the resinous pine wood of the South can be worked up and the final  product, known as kraft paper because it is strong, is used for  wrapping.    But whatever the process we get nearly pure cellulose which, as you can  see by examining this page under a microscope, consists of a tangled web  of thin white fibers, the remains of the original cell walls. Owing to  the severe treatment it has undergone wood pulp paper does not last so  long as the linen rag paper used by our ancestors. The pages of the  newspapers, magazines and books printed nowadays are likely to become  brown and brittle in a few years, no great loss for the most part since  they have served their purpose, though it is a pity that a few copies of  the worst of them could not be printed on permanent paper for  preservation in libraries so that future generations could congratulate  themselves on their progress in civilization.    But in our absorption in the printed page we must not forget the other  uses of paper. The paper clothing, so often prophesied, has not yet  arrived. Even paper collars have gone out of fashion--if they ever were  in. In Germany during the war paper was used for socks, shirts and shoes  as well as handkerchiefs and napkins but it could not stand wear and  washing. Our sanitary engineers have set us to drinking out of  sharp-edged paper cups and we blot our faces instead of wiping them.  Twine is spun of paper and furniture made of the twine, a rival of  rattan. Cloth and matting woven of paper yarn are being used for burlap  and grass in the making of bags and suitcases.    Here, however, we are not so much interested in manufactures of  cellulose itself, that is, wood, paper and cotton, as we are in its  chemical derivatives. Cellulose, as we can see from the symbol,  C_{6}H_{10}O_{5}, is composed of the three elements of carbon, hydrogen  and oxygen. These are present in the same proportion as in starch  (C_{6}H_{10}O_{5}), while glucose or grape sugar (C_{6}H_{12}O_{6}) has  one molecule of water more. But glucose is soluble in cold water and  starch is soluble in hot, while cellulose is soluble in neither.  Consequently cellulose cannot serve us for food, although some of the  vegetarian animals, notably the goat, have a digestive apparatus that  can handle it. In Finland and Germany birch wood pulp and straw were  used not only as an ingredient of cattle food but also put into war  bread. It is not likely, however, that the human stomach even under the  pressure of famine is able to get much nutriment out of sawdust. But by  digesting with dilute acid sawdust can be transformed into sugars and  these by fermentation into alcohol, so it would be possible for a man  after he has read his morning paper to get drunk on it.    If the cellulose, instead of being digested a long time in dilute acid,  is dipped into a solution of sulfuric acid (50 to 80 per cent.) and then  washed and dried it acquires a hard, tough and translucent coating that  makes it water-proof and grease-proof. This is the \"parchment paper\"  that has largely replaced sheepskin. Strong alkali has a similar effect  to strong acid. In 1844 John Mercer, a Lancashire calico printer,  discovered that by passing cotton cloth or yarn through a cold 30 per  cent. solution of caustic soda the fiber is shortened and strengthened.  For over forty years little attention was paid to this discovery, but  when it was found that if the material was stretched so that it could  not shrink on drying the twisted ribbons of the cotton fiber were  changed into smooth-walled cylinders like silk, the process came into  general use and nowadays much that passes for silk is \"mercerized\"  cotton.    Another step was taken when Cross of London discovered that when the  mercerized cotton was treated with carbon disulfide it was dissolved to  a yellow liquid. This liquid contains the cellulose in solution as a  cellulose xanthate and on acidifying or heating the cellulose is  recovered in a hydrated form. If this yellow solution of cellulose is  squirted out of tubes through extremely minute holes into acidulated  water, each tiny stream becomes instantly solidified into a silky thread  which may be spun and woven like that ejected from the spinneret of the  silkworm. The origin of natural silk, if we think about it, rather  detracts from the pleasure of wearing it, and if \"he who needlessly  sets foot upon a worm\" is to be avoided as a friend we must hope that  the advance of the artificial silk industry will be rapid enough to  relieve us of the necessity of boiling thousands of baby worms in their  cradles whenever we want silk stockings.      On a plain rush hurdle a silkworm lay    When a proud young princess came that way.    The haughty daughter of a lordly king    Threw a sidelong glance at the humble thing,"]]]
