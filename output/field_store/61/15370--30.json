It was so different.\"    The other Guinea Fowls looked uncomfortable when she spoke in this way,  and stood first on one foot and then on the other. Then the Cock said  something about the sunshiny fall weather, and the good neighbors,  and--and----    The Gander spoke again of the farm. \"It is not all that we could wish,\"  said he; \"still there are some good things about it. There are several  swimming places which are fine and cold in winter.\"    \"If it were only better cared for,\" said the Gray Goose. \"I had a  dreadful time a while ago, when I tried to get through a hole in the  fence. I don't remember what was the matter with the hole, and perhaps I  never knew, but the farmer should have such things fixed. My neck was  lame for days afterward, and he was wholly to blame.\"    After this, the Geese found fault with almost everything, and when there  was no one thing to grumble about, they sighed because, \"It was so  different from what it might be.\" It was not long before even the spring  Chickens, the Goslings, and the Ducklings were speaking in the same way,  and the poultry-yard was a most doleful place. The Bantam Hen was the  only really cheerful fowl there, and she got so tired of hearing the  rest sigh and grumble, that she often slipped between the pickets of the  fence and went to have a comfortable chat with the Oxen.    One day she fluttered toward them in a most excited manner. \"Do I look  nearly crazy?\" said she. \"I feel so. Ever since our last storm, the  Guinea Fowls have been shut in with us, and I would give half of my  tail-feathers if they had never come here. That one with the  orange-colored legs can't see good in anything, and all of our steady,  sensible fowls have heard it until they begin to believe that this farm  is a wretched place.\"    \"What do they do?\" asked the Nigh Ox, who always enjoyed hearing the  Bantam Hen talk.    \"Do?\" said she, shaking her dainty little head. \"They don't do much of  anything. That is what is the matter, and the young fowls are the worst  of all. You know how it used to be at feeding time? We all fluttered and  squabbled for the first chance at the food. Some Hen got the biggest  piece, and then the rest would chase her from one corner to another, and  not give her a chance to break and swallow any of it until she would  share with them. It was great fun, and we never left a scrap uneaten.  Now, what do you think?\"    \"Can't imagine,\" exclaimed the Oxen in one breath.    \"Well, they all stand around on one foot for a while, and I am the only  one eating. Then somebody says, 'I wonder if this is any better than  the last we had.' Another will groan, 'Oh, is it time to eat again?' or,  'Suppose I must eat something to keep up my strength.' Then I hear the  bright-legged Guinea Hen say, 'Ca-mac! Ca-mac! This is all so different,  so very different from what I have been used to.' The Cock and the other  Hen of that family are nice enough if you only get them away from her.\"    \"What nonsense!\" exclaimed the Oxen together, and they spoke quite  sharply for them.    \"I wish,\" said the Bantam Hen very slowly, and as though she meant every  word--\"I wish the bright-legged one were back where it was 'so  different.' Perhaps then my friends would begin to act like themselves.\"    \"Where did she come from?\" asked the Off Ox. \"It seems to me that I saw  a bright-legged Guinea Hen somewhere not long ago.\" He thought very  hard, so hard that he swallowed his cud without knowing he did so.    \"Wasn't it at the place where we took that load of stone the other day?\"  asked the Nigh Ox, trying to help his brother. He knew how disagreeable  it is not to be able to recall anything of that sort.    \"It was,\" cried the Off Ox; \"and a very poor farm it is. It was the same  Hen too. Talk about its being different! I should say it was different  from this place, but there are a good many ways of being different.  Um-hum! I think I will talk with the discontented Guinea Hen before  long, and I want you to see that the other fowls are listening when I  do.\"    Although he would say nothing more, the Bantam Hen saw from the look in  his eyes that he meant to stop the Guinea Hen's complaining, so she went  away feeling happier. Then the Off Ox unswallowed his cud and began to  chew it as though nothing had happened. His brother heard him chuckle  once in a while, and say, \"Different!\" under his breath.    When the Off Ox awakened from time to time during that night and heard  the Guinea Hens talking in the dark, he chuckled again to himself. The  Guinea Cock was a sound sleeper, but the Hens always talked a great deal  between sunset and sunrise, and especially if it were about to rain.  Other people thought that they might talk more in the daytime and then  keep quiet when their neighbors wanted to sleep. They declared that they  always remembered so many things to say as soon as they went to roost,  and that if they waited until morning they might forget more than half.    The very next day, the Off Ox had the chance he wanted. He and his  brother were yoked to the stone-boat and left standing by the  poultry-yard. \"Good-afternoon,\" said he. \"Is the bright-legged Guinea  Hen here?\"    \"I am,\" she answered, coming close to the pickets.    \"We are just going over to your old home,\" said he, \"with this load of  stone. Have you any messages to send to your friends?\"    The Guinea Hen looked rather uncomfortable, and stood first on one foot  and then the other. \"Tell them I am well,\" said she.    \"I will,\" said the Off Ox, in his hearty way. \"I will try to tell them  all. I think I can, too, for there did not seem to be many people in  that farmyard. I didn't see Ducks or Geese at all. Are there any living  there?\"    \"No,\" said the Guinea Hen. She did not seem to think of anything else to  say, although nobody spoke for a long time.    \"Of course not!\" exclaimed the Off Ox. \"How stupid of me to ask. There  is no brook or river on that farm.\"    Still the Guinea Hen said nothing.    \"We are dragging stone for their new barn,\" said the Off Ox. \"Or perhaps  I should say for their barn. One could hardly say that they have any  yet, although I suppose they use those loosely built sheds for barns. I  wonder people can spend a winter where there are such drafts; still,  home is always home, and people love it for that reason. We are glad to  have your family with us, not only to keep away the Crows (which was  part of the Guinea Fowls' work), but because you will be more  comfortable. I've never yet in all my travels seen so good a farm as  this, and the one you left was so different! Good-bye.\"    There was not much talking in the poultry-yard the rest of the  afternoon, although most of the fowls looked happier than they had for  many days. When supper-time came, the Dorking Hen snatched the biggest  pieces of food, and the others chased her from corner to corner in quite  the old way. Every scrap was eaten, and nobody laughed when the Shanghai  Cock said that the fine weather had given him a better appetite. It was  really a dark and chilly day, but they had stopped thinking how much  better off they would be if they only lived somewhere else. As soon as  they stopped thinking that, they could see how well they were cared for  at home. And so, although nobody had really looked at the sky or thought  about the weather, everybody had a feeling that the sun must have been  shining.    Perhaps the Guinea Cock and the other Guinea Hen were the happiest of  all, for they had not known what to do or say when the bright-legged one  talked about her old home. It all seemed like a joke now, yet she never  liked the Off Ox after that day. The other fowls were as nice to her as  ever, for they knew it was a sad thing to be so discontented, and they  knew, also, that if they had not been foolish enough to let her, she  could never have made them unhappy.          THE OXEN TALK WITH THE CALVES      It was a clear, cold winter morning, and the Cattle stood in the  barnyard where the great yellow straw-stacks were. They had nibbled away  at the lower part of these stacks until there was a sheltered place  underneath. The Calves liked to stand on the sunshiny side with an  over-hanging ledge of straw above their heads. The wind did not strike  them here, and they could reach up and pull out wisps to eat when they  had nothing else to do. Not that they were so fond of eating straw, but  it was fun to pull it out. There was, however, usually something else to  be done, for there was always their cud to chew.    Among all the farmyard people, there were none more particular about  their food. They might eat in a hurry when time was short, or when the  grass was fresh and green, but after they had swallowed it and filled  the first of their four stomachs with partly chewed food, they would  find some quiet and comfortable place where they could stand or lie  easily and finish their eating. To do this, they had to bring the partly  chewed food from the first stomach to the mouth again. They called this  \"unswallowing it,\" although they should have said \"regurgitating.\"    After the food was back in their mouths again, it was spoken of as their  cud, and the stout muscles in the sides of their faces pulled their  lower jaws up and down and sideways, and the food was caught over and  over again between the blunt grinding teeth in the back part of their  mouths, and was crushed, squeezed, and turned until it was fine, soft,  and ready to swallow into the second stomach.    Then the Cattle do not have to think of it again, but while they are  doing something quite different, and perhaps forgetting all about it,  there are many nerves and muscles and fine red blood-drops as busy as  can be, passing it into the third and fourth stomachs, and changing the  strength of the food into the strength of the Cattle. The Cows and the  Oxen do not know this."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19400"],[0,"History Of Egypt, Chaldæa, Syria, Babylonia, and Assyria, Volume 1 (of 12) (#20)"],[1,"demann,       and by most contemporary Egyptologists.    How could men who believed themselves surrounded by sphinxes and  griffins of flesh and blood doubt that there were bull-headed and  hawk-headed divinities with human busts? The existence of such  paradoxical creatures was proved by much authentic testimony; more  than one hunter had distinctly seen them as they ran along the furthest  planes of the horizon, beyond the herds of gazelles of which he was  in chase; and shepherds dreaded them for their flocks as truly as they  dreaded the lions, or the great felidse of the desert.[*]         * At Beni-Hassan and in Thebes many of the fantastic animals       mentioned in the text, griffins, hierosphinxes, serpent-       headed lions, are placed along with animals which might be       encountered by local princes hunting in the desert.    This nation of gods, like nations of men, contained foreign elements,  the origin of which was known to the Egyptians themselves. They knew  that Hathor, the milch cow, had taken up her abode in their land from  very ancient times, and they called her the Lady of Puanit, after the  name of her native country. Bisu had followed her in course of time,  and claimed his share of honours and worship along with her. He first  appeared as a leopard; then he became a man clothed in a leopard's skin,  but of strange countenance and alarming character, a big-headed dwarf  with high cheek-bones, and a wide and open mouth, whence hung an  enormous tongue; he was at once jovial and martial, the friend of the  dance and of battle.[*]         *  The hawk-headed monster with flower-tipped tail was       called the saga.    In historic times all nations subjugated by the Pharaohs transferred  some of their principal divinities to their conquerors, and the Libyan  Shehadidi was enthroned in the valley of the Nile, in the same way as  the Semitic Baalu and his retinue of Astartes, Anitis, Eeshephs, and  Kadshus. These divine colonists fared like all foreigners who  have sought to settle on the banks of the Nile: they were promptly  assimilated, wrought, moulded, and made into Egyptian deities scarcely  distinguishable from those of the old race. This mixed pantheon had  its grades of nobles, princes, kings, and each of its members was  representative of one of the elements constituting the world, or of one  of the forces which regulated its government.    [Illustration: 113.jpb SOME FABULOUS BEASTS OF THE EGYPTIAN DESERT 1]         1  Bisu, pp. 111-184. The tail-piece to the summary of this       chapter is a figure of Bisu, drawn by Faucher-Gudin from an       amulet in blue enamelled pottery.    The sky, the earth, the stars, the sun, the Nile, were so many breathing  and thinking beings whose lives were daily manifest in the life of the  universe.    They were worshipped from one end of the valley to the other, and the  whole nation agreed in proclaiming their sovereign power. But when the  people began to name them, to define their powers and attributes, to  particularize their forms, or the relationships that subsisted among  them, this unanimity was at an end. Each principality, each nome, each  city, almost every village, conceived and represented them differently.  Some said that the sky was the Great Horus, Haroeris, the sparrow-hawk  of mottled plumage which hovers in highest air, and whose gaze embraces  the whole field of creation. Owing to a punning assonance between his  name and the word _horu_, which designates the human countenance, the  two senses were combined, and to the idea of the sparrow-hawk there was  added that of a divine face, whose two eyes opened in turn, the right  eye being the sun, to give light by day, and the left eye the moon, to  illumine the night. The face shone also with a light of its own, the  zodiacal light, which appeared unexpectedly, morning or evening, a  little before sunrise, and a little after sunset. These luminous beams,  radiating from a common centre, hidden in the heights of the firmament,  spread into a wide pyramidal sheet of liquid blue, whose base rested  upon the earth, but whose apex was slightly inclined towards the zenith.  The divine face was symmetrically framed, and attached to earth by four  thick locks of hair; these were the pillars which upbore the firmament  and prevented its falling into ruin. A no less ancient tradition  disregarded as fabulous all tales told of the sparrow-hawk, or of the  face, and taught that heaven and earth are wedded gods, Sibu, and Nuit,  from whose marriage came forth all that has been, all that is, and all  that shall be.    [Illustration: 115.jpg NUIT THE STARRY ONE. 1]         1 Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a painted coffin of the XXIth       dynasty in Leyden.    Most people invested them with human form, and represented the earth-god  Sibu as extended beneath Nuit the Starry One; the goddess stretched out  her arms, stretched out her slender legs, stretched out her body above  the clouds, and her dishevelled head drooped westward. But there were  also many who believed that Sibu was concealed under the form of a  colossal gander, whose mate once laid the Sun Egg, and perhaps still  laid it daily. From the piercing cries wherewith he congratulated her,  and announced the good news to all who cared to hear it--after the  manner of his kind--he had received the flattering epithet of _Ngagu  oiru_, the Great Cack-ler. Other versions repudiated the goose in favour  of a vigorous bull, the father of gods and men, whose companion was a  cow, a large-eyed Hathor, of beautiful countenance. The head of the  good beast rises into the heavens, the mysterious waters which cover  the world flow along her spine; the star-covered underside of her body,  which we call the firmament, is visible to the inhabitants of earth, and  her four legs are the four pillars standing at the four cardinal points  of the world.

This is not the goose of Sibu, but the goose of Amon,       which was nurtured in the temple of Karnak, and was called       Smonu. Pacing it is the cat of Maut, the wife of Amon. Amon,       originally an earth-god, was, as we see, confounded with       Sibu, and thus naturally appropriated that deity's form of a       goose.    The planets, and especially the sun, varied in form and nature according  to the prevailing conception of the heavens. The fiery disk _Atonu_, by  which the sun revealed himself to men, was a living god, called Ra, as  was also the planet itself.[*] Where the sky was regarded as Horus, Ra  formed the right eye of the divine face: when Horus opened his eyelids  in the morning, he made the dawn and day; when he closed them in the  evening, the dusk and night were at hand.         *   The name of Ra has been variously explained. The       commonest etymology is that deriving the name from a verb       ra, _to give, to make to be_ a person or a thing, so that Ra       would thus be the great organizer, the author of all things.       Lauth goes so far as to say that \"notwithstanding its       brevity, Ra is a composite word (r-a, _maker--to be_)\" As a       matter of fact, the word is simply the name of the       planet applied to the god.    It means the _sun_, and nothing       more.

The statue was also published by Mariette,       _Monuments divers_, pl. 96 A-B, and in the _Album       photographique du Musee de Boulaq_, pl. x.    Where the sky was looked upon as the incarnation of a goddess, Ra was  considered as her son,[**] his father being the earth-god, and he was  born again with every new dawn, wearing a sidelock, and with his finger  to his lips as human children were conventionally represented.         **  Several passages from the Pyramid texts prove that the       _two eyes_ were very anciently considered as belonging to       the face of Nuit, and this conception persisted to the last       days of Egyptian paganism. Hence, we must not be surprised       if the inscriptions generally represent the god Ra as coming       forth from Nuit under the form of a disc, or a scarabaeus,       and born of her even as human children are born.    He was also that luminous egg, laid and hatched in the East by the  celestial goose, from which the sun breaks forth to fill the world with  its rays.[**]         **  These are the very expressions used in the seventeenth       chapter of the _Book of the Dead_ (Naville's edition, vol.       i. pl. xxv. lines 58-61; Lepsius, _Todtenbuch_, pl. ix. 11.       50, 51).

Drawing by Faucher-Gudin.    Nevertheless, by an anomaly not uncommon in religions, the egg did not  always contain the same kind of bird; a lapwing, or a heron, might  come out of it,[*] or perhaps, in memory of Horus, one of the beautiful  golden sparrow-hawks of Southern Egypt. A Sun-Hawk, hovering in high  heaven on outspread wings, at least presented a bold and poetic image;  but what can be said for a Sun-Calf? Yet it is under the innocent  aspect of a spotted calf, a \"sucking calf of pure mouth,\"[**] that the  Egyptians were pleased to describe the Sun-God when Sibu, the father,  was a bull, and Hathor a heifer.         *  The lapwing or the heron, the Egyptian _bonu_, is       generally the Osirian bird. The persistence with which it is       associated with Heliopolis and the gods of that city shows       that in this also we have"]]]
