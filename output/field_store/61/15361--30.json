I  personally appreciate and am thankful for your unfailing supplications and  special prayers on my behalf. I am deeply touched by your expressions of  unwavering faith, of loyalty and affection, and fully reciprocate your  brotherly sentiments and your keen desire and readiness to collaborate  with me more closely and effectively than ever before.          Purpose of Convention      And now regarding this forthcoming Convention, I feel that the dominating  purpose inspiring the assembled friends, delegates and visitors alike,  should be a two-fold one. The first is a challenge to the individual, the  second a collective responsibility. The one seeks to reinforce the motive  power of our spiritual activities, the second aims at raising the standard  of administrative efficiency so vitally needed at this advanced stage of  our work. We should first and foremost endeavor by every conceivable means  to revitalize our precious Cause, rudely shaken by the constant  vicissitudes attending the outward departure of a vigilant and gracious  Master. Our next object should be to seek to approach, through more  intimate association, fuller and more frequent consultations, and a closer  familiarity with the character, the mission and the teachings of the  Cause, that standard of excellence which should characterize the  cooperative efforts of Baha'i Communities in every land.    High aims and pure motives, however laudable in themselves, will surely  not suffice if unsupported by measures that are practicable and methods  that are sound. Wealth of sentiment, abundance of good-will and effort,  will prove of little avail if we should fail to exercise discrimination  and restraint and neglect to direct their flow along the most profitable  channels. The unfettered freedom of the individual should be tempered with  mutual consultation and sacrifice, and the spirit of initiative and  enterprise should be reinforced by a deeper realization of the supreme  necessity for concerted action and a fuller devotion to the common weal.          National Spiritual Assembly      It would be impossible at this stage to ignore the indispensability or to  overestimate the unique significance of the institution of the National  Spiritual Assembly--the pivot round which revolve the activities of the  believers throughout the American continent. Supreme is their position,  grave their responsibilities, manifold and arduous their duties. How great  the privilege, how delicate the task of the assembled delegates whose  function it is to elect such national representatives as would by their  record of service ennoble and enrich the annals of the Cause! If we but  turn our gaze to the high qualifications of the members of Baha'i  Assemblies, as enumerated in 'Abdu'l-Baha's Tablets, we are filled with  feelings of unworthiness and dismay, and would feel truly disheartened but  for the comforting thought that if we rise to play nobly our part every  deficiency in our lives will be more than compensated by the  all-conquering spirit of His grace and power. Hence it is incumbent upon  the chosen delegates to consider without the least trace of passion and  prejudice, and irrespective of any material consideration, the names of  only those who can best combine the necessary qualities of unquestioned  loyalty, of selfless devotion, of a well-trained mind, of recognized  ability and mature experience. May the incoming National Spiritual  Assembly--the privileged and chosen servants of the Cause--immortalize their  term of stewardship by deeds of loving service, deeds that will redound to  the honor, the glory and the power of the Most Great Name.          The Cornerstone of Service      I would also earnestly entreat all the delegates at this coming  Convention, and through them I appeal to the larger body of believers whom  they represent, to ever bear in mind the supreme injunction of  'Abdu'l-Baha, to teach unceasingly until the \"head cornerstone of the  foundation\" of the Cause of God is firmly established in every heart. Let  those whose time, resources and means allow, travel throughout the length  and breadth of that vast continent, let them scatter to the most distant  regions of the earth and, fired with enthusiasm and detachment, hand on  the torch of God's undying flame to the waiting multitudes of a  sadly-stricken world.    One word more in conclusion. Let the West, and particularly the Great  Republic of the New World, where a quarter of a century ago Baha'u'llah's  Banner was firmly implanted, realize that upon it now rests the  responsibility of achieving the universal recognition of the Baha'i Faith,  of fulfilling 'Abdu'l-Baha's fondest hopes.    Persia, the cradle of an unfolding world civilization, is still bereft of  her freedom, sunk in ignorance, a prey to contending policies and  factions, beset on one hand by the powers of orthodoxy and sectarian  fanaticism and assailed on the other by the forces of materialism and  unbelief. In her evil plight she is radiantly confident that the Flame she  had kindled in the world will, in the fullness of time, blaze forth in the  heart of the mighty West and shed redeeming illumination upon the silent  sufferers of a distracted country. Will it be America, will it be one of  the nations of Europe, that will seize the torch of Divine Guidance from  Persia's fettered hands and with it set the western world aflame? May your  Convention, by its spirit, its resolutions and its accomplishments, give  to that country's urgent call a noble and decisive answer.    Your brother and fellow-worker,  SHOGHI.    Haifa, Palestine,  June 3rd, 1925.          Letter of October 24th, 1925.      To the members of the National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of the  United States and Canada.    My well-beloved friends:    The numerous communications which your distinguished Secretary has lately  addressed on your behalf to the Greatest Holy Leaf and myself, have been  eagerly perused and their contents carefully noted. The news they imparted  and the spirit they revealed have caused us both genuine satisfaction, and  have served to intensify the feelings of joyous confidence, of pride and  gratitude with which we have greeted the inauguration of your term of  service.    The notable advance achieved by this year's memorable Convention is, I am  certain, attributable in no small measure to the energy, the thoroughness,  the insight and the loving-kindness that have characterized in an  unprecedented degree the activities of the outgoing National Spiritual  Assembly. I am confident that the work of America's newly elected  representatives, so splendidly and auspiciously begun, will further  consolidate the labors of the past, will resolve to a great extent the  problems and perplexities of the present, and open up fresh fields of  future achievements and service.    I rejoice to learn that ways and means have been found to enable the  National Secretary, who discharges in such an exemplary manner the  manifold and exacting duties of a highly responsible position, to devote  all his time to the pursuit of so meritorious a task. I am fully conscious  of the privations and sacrifice which the choice of this arduous work must  involve for him, as well as for his devoted and selfless companion; I  cannot but admire and extol their heroic efforts; and wish to assure them  both of my continued prayers for the speedy fruition of their earnest  endeavors.          Qualifications of a Believer      Regarding the very delicate and complex question of ascertaining the  qualifications of a true believer, I cannot in this connection emphasize  too strongly the supreme necessity for the exercise of the utmost  discretion, caution and tact, whether it be in deciding for ourselves as  to who may be regarded a true believer or in disclosing to the outside  world such considerations as may serve as a basis for such a decision. I  would only venture to state very briefly and as adequately as present  circumstances permit the principal factors that must be taken into  consideration before deciding whether a person may be regarded a true  believer or not. Full recognition of the station of the Forerunner, the  Author, and the True Exemplar of the Baha'i Cause, as set forth in  'Abdu'l-Baha's Testament; unreserved acceptance of, and submission to,  whatsoever has been revealed by their Pen; loyal and steadfast adherence  to every clause of our Beloved's sacred Will; and close association with  the spirit as well as the form of the present day Baha'i administration  throughout the world--these I conceive to be the fundamental and primary  considerations that must be fairly, discreetly and thoughtfully  ascertained before reaching such a vital decision. Any attempt at further  analysis and elucidation will, I fear, land us in barren discussions and  even grave controversies that would prove not only futile but even  detrimental to the best interests of a growing Cause. I would therefore  strongly urge those who are called upon to make such a decision to  approach this highly involved and ever-recurring problem with the spirit  of humble prayer, and earnest consultation, and to refrain from drawing  rigidly the line of demarcation except on such occasions when the  interests of the Cause absolutely demand it.          National Convention      In connection with the annual holding of the Baha'i Convention and  Congress, I feel that although such a representative body need not be  convened necessarily every year, yet it is highly desirable, in view of  the unique functions it fulfills in promoting harmony and good-will, in  removing misunderstandings and in enhancing the prestige of the Cause,  that the National Spiritual Assembly should exert itself"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19254"],[0,"Citadel of Faith (#20)"],[1,"and genesis--the twin Covenants of Baha'u'llah and of 'Abdu'l-Baha,  the present Administrative Order, the future World Order, the Laws of the  Most Holy Book, the inseparable institutions of the Guardianship and of  the Universal House of Justice, the salient events of the Heroic and  Formative Ages of the Faith, and its relationship with the Dispensations  that have preceded it, its attitude toward the social and political  organizations by which it is surrounded--must continue to constitute the  most vital aspect of the great spiritual Crusade launched by the champions  of the Faith from among the peoples of their sister republics in the  South.    The magnitude of the tasks these heroes and champions of the Faith are  summoned, at this hour, crowded with destiny, to discharge from the  borders of Greenland to the southern extremity of Chile in the Western  Hemisphere, and from Scandinavia in the north, to the Iberian peninsula in  the south of the European continent, is, indeed, breath-taking in its  implications and back-breaking in the strain it imposes. The sacrifices  they are called upon to voluntarily make for the successful performance of  such herculean, such holy, such epoch-making tasks, are comparable to none  but those which their spiritual forbears have willingly accepted at the  hour of the birth of their Faith more than a hundred years ago. Theirs is  the privilege, no less meritorious and perhaps as epoch-making, to  preside, in their own homeland and its neighboring continents, over, and  direct the forces generated by, the birth of an order that posterity will  acclaim as both the offspring of that Faith, and the precursor of the  Golden Age in which that same Faith must, in the fullness of time, find  its fullest expression and most glorious consummation.    How great the opportunity which the present hour, so dark in the fortunes  of mankind and yet so bright in the ever-unfolding history of their Faith,  offers them. How unspeakably precious the reward which they who serve it  will reap! How pitiful and urgent the need of the waiting multitudes of  these continents, summoned to sustain the initial impact of the operation  of a divinely impelled Plan which no force can resist and no power can  rival!    For what this superbly equipped community, this irresistibly advancing  army of the chosen warriors of Baha'u'llah, battling under His banner,  operating in conformity with the explicit Mandate voiced by His beloved  Son, has already achieved, over so extensive a field, in such a brief  time, at such great sacrifice, for so precious a Cause, and in the course  of such turbulent years, I cannot but feel the deepest sense of gratitude  the like of which no achievement, single or collective, rendered in any  other part of the globe, by any community associated with the Cause of the  Most Great Name has evoked. For what it will and must achieve in the  future I entertain feelings of warm expectation and serene confidence. For  it, I will continue, from the depths of a loving and grateful heart to  supplicate blessings immeasurably richer than any it has yet experienced.    [August 18, 1949]            PRAYING FOR INCREASING SUCCESS      Delighted at progress of Temple work; urge uninterrupted reinforcement of  Latin American and European enterprises through steady flow of pioneers,  continued self-sacrifice; praying for increasing success of your high  endeavors. Deepest loving appreciation.    [November 6, 1949]            MAJESTY OF THE BAB'S SHRINE UNFOLDING      Announce to the friends that six hundred tons of stones destined for the  arcade of the Bab's Shrine, received in successive shipments to the Holy  Land, have been safely transported to its precincts despite repeated  accidents--the sinking of a lighter in the harbor and outbreak of fire in  the hold of the ship. An additional two hundred tons of material including  carved marble mosaic have been ordered through recent contract for  erection of parapet designed to crown the columns and arches of the  arcade. North and east sides of structure with three corners virtually  completed. Construction of cornice and roof, last stage in erection of the  arcade, will soon be undertaken. Majesty and beauty of the colonnade  enveloping the central holy edifice built by 'Abdu'l-Baha's hands steadily  unfolding, presaging revelation of the full glory of the completed  Sepulcher manifesting the plenitude of the splendor of the constructed  dome.    [November 13, 1949]            FAITHLESS BROTHER HUSSEIN      Faithless brother Hussein, already abased through dishonorable conduct  over period of years followed by association with Covenant-breakers in  Holy Land and efforts to undermine Guardian's position, recently further  demeaned himself through marriage under obscure circumstances with lowborn  Christian girl in Europe. This disgraceful alliance, following four  successive marriages by sisters and cousins with three sons of  Covenant-breaker denounced repeatedly by 'Abdu'l-Baha as His enemy, and  daughter of notorious political agitator, brands them with infamy greater  than any associated with marriages contracted by old Covenant-breakers  whether belonging to family of Muhammad-'Ali or Badi'u'llah.    [December 19, 1949]            MAINTAIN MOMENTUM IN TRIPLE FIELD      Delighted by progress in Latin-American field, Temple construction and  publicity activities. Announce arrival of first shipment of parapet  panels. Anticipate early completion of eastern facade of Shrine including  mosaic panels. Urge maintenance of momentum in triple field, home,  intercontinental enterprises. Praying for bountiful blessings from the  Almighty.    [February 25, 1950]            SHRINE PARAPET COMPLETED      Announce to the friends the completion, on the eve of Naw-Ruz, of the  erection of parapet crowning the eastern facade of Holy Shrine one year  after placing the first threshold stones upon the foundation of the  arcade. The beauty and majesty of the finely carved panels surmounting the  soaring arches spanning the rosy monolith columns, emblazoned with emerald  green and scarlet mosaic symbolizing the Bab's lineage and martyrdom, are  strikingly revealed. The original pearl-like structure raised by the hands  of the Center of the Covenant, enshrining the remains of the  Martyr-Prophet of the Faith, acquiring, through construction of the shell  designed for its embellishment and preservation, additional height by  one-third, additional width by one-fifth, enhancing the massiveness of the  edifice embosomed in the Mountain of God, heralding the erection of the  lofty gilded dome that will eventually shine forth in solitary splendor  from its heart.    [March 21, 1950]            SACRED TASK OF PRESENT HOUR      Approved recommendation regarding treatment of walls. Meeting deficit  budget must have precedence over purchase of land near Hazira owing to  critical situation in Latin America and vital needs in Europe. Steady flow  of pioneers to both continents is the imperative, urgent, sacred task of  the present hour.    [March 29, 1950]            SHRINE ARCADE NEARING COMPLETION      Announce to friends that central panel of north facade, adorned with green  mosaic with gilded Greatest Name, the fairest gem set in crown of arcade  of Shrine, clearly visible from city by day, floodlit by night, is now in  position.    Three corner panels bearing symbol of ringstone erected, presaging  completion of both parapet and arcade on the occasion of approaching  Centenary of martyrdom of the Blessed Bab.    [June 17, 1950]            CENTENARY OF THE MARTYRDOM OF THE BAB      Moved to share with assembled representatives of American Baha'i Community  gathered beneath the dome of the Most Holy House of Worship in the Baha'i  world, feelings of profound emotion evoked by this historic occasion of  the world-wide commemoration of the First Centenary of the Martyrdom of  the Blessed Bab, Prophet and Herald of the Faith of Baha'u'llah, Founder  of the Dispensation marking the culmination of the six thousand year old  Adamic Cycle, Inaugurator of the five thousand century Baha'i Cycle.    Poignantly call to mind the circumstances attending the last act  consummating the tragic ministry of the Master-Hero of the most sublime  drama in the religious annals of mankind, signalizing the most dramatic  event of the most turbulent period of the Heroic Age of the Baha'i  Dispensation, destined to be recognized by posterity as the most precious,  momentous sacrifice in the world's spiritual history. Recall the peerless  tributes paid to His memory by the Founder of the Faith, acclaiming Him  Monarch of God's Messengers, the Primal Point round Whom the realities of  all the Prophets circle in adoration. Profoundly stirred by the memory of  the agonies He suffered, the glad-tidings He announced, the warnings He  uttered, the forces He set in motion, the adversaries He converted, the  disciples He raised up, the conflagrations He precipitated, the legacy He  left of faith and courage, the love He inspired. Acknowledge with bowed  head, joyous, thankful heart the successive, marvelous evidence of His  triumphant power in the course of the hundred years elapsed since the last  crowning act of His meteoric ministry.    The creative energies released at the hour of the birth of His Revelation,  endowing mankind with the potentialities of the attainment of maturity are  deranging, during the present transitional age, the equilibrium of the  entire planet as the inevitable prelude to the consummation in world unity  of the coming of age of the human race. The portentous but unheeded  warnings addressed to kings, princes, ecclesiastics are responsible for  the successive overthrow of fourteen monarchies of East and West, the  collapse of the institution of the Caliphate, the virtual extinction of  the Pope's temporal sovereignty, the progressive decline in the fortunes  of"]]]
