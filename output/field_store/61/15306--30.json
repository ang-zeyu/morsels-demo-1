He had not a farthing  in his pocket. He said his home was near the frontier, and that he often  slipped across it for a ride on his bicycle. He related that he had been  caught during one of these excursions, to find himself ultimately at  Sennelager. That man was a mystery. He was kept alive by the others more  or less, and he accompanied us to various prisons. But subsequently he  obtained his papers in a mysterious manner, and was seen no more. He  vanished in the darkness as it were, and the German guards were not  disposed to talk about him. It has always been our suspicion that he  was sent among us with an ulterior motive which it is impossible to  divine.    Those who could not purchase supplies from the canteen were assisted by  their more fortunate comrades. The lucky ones divided their purchases so  that the unfortunate individuals might not feel their position or suffer  want. This practice was tangibly assisted by one or two prisoners who  were well supplied with money, especially Prince L----, who became the  general favourite of the camp from his fellow-feeling, camaraderie,  sympathy, and sportsmanship.    One morning he came across a poor prisoner who looked very ill. He  appeared to be half starved, as indeed he was from his inability to buy  any food. After a short conversation the Prince slipped five sovereigns  into the man's hand and bolted before he could be thanked. Unfortunately  this poor fellow is still in prison, but he has never forgotten the  Prince's kindness.    The day after our arrival at Sennelager the Prince came to me and drew  my attention to my shirtless condition. I explained the reason for its  disappearance and that I could not get another as the authorities were  still holding my heavy baggage containing further supplies. He said  nothing as he went away, but a quarter of an hour later he returned with  a new garment from his own kit which he forced me to accept. Another  day, the party with which I was working were coming in to the evening  meal. He hailed us and invited one and all to accompany him to the  canteen to have a chop with him. That was the finest meal I had tasted  since my feast in Wesel prison. Some time later Prince L---- succeeded  in getting home. Although he was heartily congratulated upon his good  fortune, his absence was sorely felt by those whom he was in the habit  of befriending.    At nine o'clock we had to be in bed. Some of the more untameable spirits  rebelled at the order to extinguish lights at this hour, but in our  barrack Captain K---- rigidly insisted that the regulation should be  observed. He feared the antagonism of the officers might be aroused, in  which event we should be made to suffer for our fractiousness. The  disputes between the prisoners and the sentries over the lights were  interminable. The men would be ordered to extinguish their oil lamp. If  they did not respond with sufficient alacrity the sentry cluttered up  and put it out himself. At a later date, however, the hour for \"lights  out\" was extended to 10 p.m.    The German nation is ever held up as the world's apostle of hygiene and  sanitary science. However true this may be in regard to civic and rural  life it certainly does not apply to prison and military existence. We  were occupying the quarters normally assigned to recruits. Yet  Sennelager was absolutely devoid of the most primitive features of a  safe sanitary system. There was an open cesspool within a stone's throw  of the barracks, the stench from which, during the heat of the summer,  may be better imagined than described. No disinfectants whatever were  used, and at intervals of three days it was emptied by the crudest means  imaginable, on which occasions the barracks were not only untenantable  but absolutely unapproachable. In fact, the conditions were so primitive  and revolting that the outbreak of an epidemic was momentarily expected,  not only by ourselves but by the authorities as well.    This danger was brought home to us when we were compelled to submit to  the ordeal of vaccination. Even this task was carried out under  conditions which no other civilised country would permit for a moment,  for the simple reason that antiseptic precautions were conspicuous by  their complete absence. The order arrived that we were to be vaccinated  on such and such a morning \"in the interests of the camp--both prisoners  and soldiers.\" We were ordered to line up in a queue outside a small  building which we were to enter singly in succession. We were commanded  to have our arms bared to the shoulder in readiness. Vaccination was not  carried out by Dr. Ascher, the official medical attendant to the camp,  but by a young military doctor who came especially for the purpose.    Whether it was because the temperature within the small building was too  sultry or not I cannot say, but the vaccinator decided to complete his  work in the open air, the fact that a dust-storm was raging  notwithstanding. The military doctor was accompanied by a colleague  carrying a small pot or basin which evidently contained the serum. The  operation was performed quickly if crudely. The vaccinator stopped  before a man, dipped his lance or whatever the instrument was into the  jar, and gripping the arm tightly just above the elbow, made four big  slashes on the muscle. The incisions were large, deep, and  brutal-looking. Then he passed to the next man, repeating the process,  and so on all along the line. He took no notice of the dust which was  driving hither and thither in clouds.    Whether by misfortune or mishap I received four striking gashes, and the  shape of the incisions made me wonder whether the vaccinator thought he  was playing a game of noughts and crosses with a scalpel upon my arm.  After we had been wounded in this manner we were in a quandary. Our arms  were thickly covered with the drifting sand. Our shirt sleeves were  equally soiled. Consequently infection of the wound appeared to be  inevitable whatever we did. In this unhappy frame of mind and dirty  condition we were dismissed. Unfortunately for me I proved resistant to  the serum, and had to submit to the operation a second time with equally  abortive results. One or two of the prisoners suffered untold agonies,  blood-poisoning evidently setting in to aggravate the action of the  serum.    The primitive sanitary arrangements which prevailed brought one plague  upon us. We suffered from a pestilence of flies which under the  circumstances was not surprising, everything being conducive to their  propagation. They swarmed around us in thick black clouds. They recalled  the British housefly, only they were much larger, and extremely  pugnacious. Life within the barracks became almost impossible owing to  their attacks and the severity of their stings, which set up maddening  irritation. We petitioned the authorities to allow us a supply of  fly-papers. After considerable demur they acquiesced, but we could not  use them, or rather they were used up too rapidly. The evening we  received them we decided to attach a few to the ceiling, but before we  could fix them in position their fly-catching capacities were exhausted.  They were covered with a heaving, buzzing black mass of insects within a  minute. So we abandoned fly-catching tactics.    This pestilence harassed us sorely during our meals. They settled  everywhere and upon everything. While butter or margarine were  unobtainable at the canteen we were able to purchase a substance which  resembled honey in appearance, colour, and taste. Indeed we were told  that it was an artificial product of the beehive. When we spread this  upon our bread the flies swarmed to the attack, and before the food  could be raised to our mouths the bread was not to be seen for flies. At  first we spent considerable effort in brushing the insects away, but  their numbers were too overwhelming to be resisted, so we were compelled  to run the risk of the flies, and I, in common with others, have eaten  bread, honey, and flies as well! It took considerable time and effort to  master such a revolting meal, but under these conditions, it was either  flies or nothing, so we ran the risk of the insects, although it cannot  be said that they contributed to the tastiness of an already indifferent  food, or our peace of mind, because we could not dismiss thoughts of the  cesspool which the flies made their happy hunting-ground during the  periods between meals.    Infraction of the rules and regulations were frequent, for the simple  reason that they were never explained to us. We had to learn them as  best we could--invariably through the experience of punishment. This  state of affairs placed us at the mercy of the guards. Those who were  venomously anti-British expended their savagery upon us on every  occasion. For the slightest misdemeanour we were consigned to the cells  for one, two, three, or more days. The cell recalled my domicile in  Wesel, and I must confess that I made the acquaintance of its uninviting  interior upon several occasions through inadvertently breaking some  rule. But the others fared no better in this respect. It was cells for  anything.    This prison was a small masonry building, fitted with a tiny grating. It  was devoid of all appointments, not even a plank bed being provided. To  sleep one had to stretch one's self on the floor and secure as much  comfort as the cold stone would afford. Bread and water was the diet.  All exercise was denied, except possibly for the brief stretch  accompanied by the sentry to fetch the mid-day meal of soup, assuming  the offence permitted such food in the dietary, from the cook-house.  Conversation with a fellow-creature was rigidly _verboten_. It was  solitary confinement in its most brutal form.    The method of punishment was typically Prussian. If one upset the guard  by word or deed, he clapped you in the cell "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18183"],[0,"Trees, Fruits and Flowers of Minnesota, 1916 (#20)"],[1,"is a firm berry and stands shipping a long distance. My  belief is that this variety will make one of the best commercial berries  for the Northwest.    The everbearing variety is known as No. 1017. It is a large, round  berry, dark red color, and is of the best quality. This variety is  strong and vigorous and a good plant-maker when blossoms are picked off  early in the season. It is also very productive. The blossoms and  berries on a number of plants were counted in October, and we found all  the way from 200 to 345 berries and blossoms on single plants. This is,  of course, a little more than the average, but it shows what it will do  under ordinary conditions. This variety has been growing next to  Progressive, on the same soil, with the same cultivation, and I think  that persons who have seen it this summer will agree with me that it is  far ahead of Progressive in size and productiveness. I will say right  here, if you expect to have a good crop of fruit in the fall, keep the  most of the runners off. If you encourage them to make runners, or  plants, you will have less fruit.    The raspberries sent out as Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7, are all worthy  of trial. The No. 4 has fruited several years and gave the best showing  so far. The fruit resembles the Marlboro somewhat, but the color is  darker. It is not one of very high quality, but the size of the berry  and its appearance will more then make up for this. The canes and  foliage are generally healthy and very hardy. This variety will be  planted very extensively just as soon as enough stock can be supplied to  fruit growers.    The Burbank crossed with Wolf, hybrid plums. There have been several of  these sent out to trial stations, and as premiums to members of the  Horticultural Society. I will mention them in order as to size of fruit.  No. 5, 12, 4, and 6 will measure 1-3/4 inch in diameter. Nos. 21, 10,  17, 9, and No. 1 are nearly as large. The kinds which have given best  all around satisfaction up to the present time, are Nos. 1, 6, 9, 10,  12, 17, 21 and 25. One or two years more trial should give us an idea  which ones will be worthy of general propagation.    There are also several varieties of Abundance and Wolf crosses which  have fruited for several years. The quality of the fruit of these  hybrids is probably somewhat better than the Burbank and Wolf hybrids,  but the fruit in most cases runs smaller. No. 35 is probably one of the  best; its fruit is about 1-1/2 inch in diameter, colors up all over  before it is ripe, and will stand shipping a long distance, as they can  be picked quite green and still are colored up all over. There are  several numbers equally, or nearly, as promising as No. 35.    Sand cherry X Satsuma plum No. 145 is in the same class as Sapa. The  color of the fruit is bluish black when ripe, the flesh purple, pit  small and nearly freestone; fruit ripens first part of August. This tree  is a strong grower and makes a large tree. We also have another plum,  Compass cherry X Climax, about the only variety which fruited this year.  The color of the skin is almost blue when fully ripe; the meat is green  and of a very pleasant flavor. The pit is small and clingstone; size of  fruit is about 1-1/2 inches in diameter. The tree is a strong, upright  grower. This variety has been propagated this summer. I will not try to  describe any more as there are some 2,000 hybrid plums on the place and  only a small per cent have fruited.    [Illustration: Ornamental Purple Leaf Plum, originated at State  Fruit-Breeding Farm.]    In grapes we have several varieties worthy of propagation, but I will  just mention two varieties. One is a red grape about the size of Wyoming  Red. The bunches are large and very compact; the season for ripening is  about with Moore's Early; the quality is good enough to make it a table  grape. The vine is just as hardy as Beta grape, of which it is a  seedling. It has good foliage and the vine is a rank grower. The other  variety is black when ripe, nearly as large as Moore's Early. The fruit  is ripe first part of August; the vine is vigorous and hardy.    Strawberries and raspberries were a good crop this year, but all other  fruit was a total failure on account of the killing frost and snowstorm  on May 18th. Apples were in full bloom at the time, and a good crop of  plums had set on the trees, but all fell off a few days later. There  were no currants or gooseberries and only a few grapes.    Mr. Waldron: What do you think the male parent was of the red grape?    Mr. Haralson: I couldn't say. We don't know what the cross is.    Mr. Waldron: Did you have any red grapes growing there?    Mr. Haralson: I presume there were quite a number of varieties growing  near by. In the Beta seedlings we find a number of grapes that ripen  green and also some black and a number red, but not a great many, I  would say from five to seven per cent of the seedlings.    Mr. Wellington: Have you been able to cross the European plum with the  Japanese?    Mr. Haralson: We have one or two varieties, but the fruit is very small,  the fruit isn't very much larger than the Compass cherry. The tree is a  very strong grower and makes a large tree, but the fruit is not up to  what it should be.    Mr. Cook: What number do you hold that red grape under?    Mr. Haralson: The red grape is No. 1.    Mr. Sauter: Which is the next best raspberry besides the No. 4?    Mr. Haralson: I couldn't tell you at present. I thought the No. 2, but  from reports I have had from several places some think No. 1 is better.  No. 4 is the best of them all so far.    A Member: I would like to ask which of those raspberries is the best  quality.    Mr. Haralson: They run very much the same, very little difference in the  quality. The quality I should say compares very favorably with the King.    The President: Those of you who know of the wonderful work done by Mr.  Haralson can not help but say, \"Well done, good and faithful servant.\"  He has surely accomplished wonderful results out there, and the people  of this state and adjoining states will all in time enjoy the fruits of  his labor. (Applause.)           *       *       *       *       *    KILL WILD ONIONS IN NOVEMBER.--The secret of the vitality of  the wild onion lies in the two sorts of underground bulbs. Each plant  produces one large bulb, which germinates in the fall, and four or five  small ones, which start growth in the spring.    Late fall plowing, followed by early spring plowing and planting the  infested land to some clean cultivated crop destroys the wild onion pest  by killing both sorts of bulbs as the growth from them appears and  before they have a chance to multiply. The fall plowing should be deep,  and care should be taken to completely bury all green tops of the onion.  If very much top growth has been made, a harrow run before the plow will  facilitate the thorough covering of the tops.    Another interesting and valuable point about the wild onion is that the  spring bulbs rarely produce heads; consequently, if the infested land is  plowed in the fall, a spring oat crop practically free of onions can  always be secured. But for complete eradication of the onion, both fall  and spring plowing is necessary, and November is the best time to do the  fall work.          Annual Meeting, 1915, Wisconsin Horticultural Society.    CHAS. HARALSON, EXCELSIOR, MINN., DELEGATE.      The meeting was held January 5, 6 and 7, 1915, in the Assembly Room of  the State Capitol in Madison, Wis. Your delegate was present in time for  the opening session and given a chance with other delegates to deliver  the greetings of their societies.    The opening address by Governor Phillip was very interesting. He told of  the possibilities the State of Wisconsin offered fruit growers in a  commercial way with markets all around them. He advocated honest grading  and packing to obtain the top prices for the fruit. He also urged every  farmer to have a small orchard and fruit garden for home consumption.    Spraying and spray mixtures, illustrated, was ably presented by  Professor Geo. F. Potter, University of Wisconsin.    A speaking contest by ten students from University of Wisconsin competed  for prizes of $25.00, $15.00 and $10.00. This brought out almost every  phase of horticulture and was one of the most interesting sessions.    Commercial orcharding in the middle west was shown with moving pictures  and explanations by Sen. Dunlap, Savoy, Ill. These pictures illustrated  spraying, cultivating, harvesting, grading, packing, caring for the  fruit and marketing the same, and several other operations in connection  with uptodate commercial orcharding. He also gave a talk on spraying and  spraying materials. He said lime-sulphur is preferred in his locality.    A half hour question and answer session was led by Professor J.G. Moore,  University of Wisconsin, on pruning. This brought out a very lively  discussion about how to prune young orchards and what age of trees to  plant for commercial orchards. This question was not settled, as some  preferred one year old trees, while others would plant nothing but two  year old trees.    M. S. Kellogg, Janesville, Wis., spoke of nurserymen's troubles. His  paper was very interesting from a nurseryman's standpoint with all their  troubles and what they have to go up against.    C. O. Ruste, Blue Mounds, Wis., spoke about the farmer's orchard, what to  plant and how to care for the same.    The writer gave a paper, telling what is being done in the line of  fruit-breeding at the Minnesota Fruit-Breeding Farm.    The program was very full and interesting. The attendance, however, was  not very large. A very good exhibit of apples was on display in the  fruit room. The fruit was clean, well colored and up to size. Many  varieties, such as Jonathan, Fameuse, Baldwin, Windsor, Talman Sweet and  Wine Sap were on display in great quantities."]]]
