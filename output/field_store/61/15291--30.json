And the cripple was on the ground at the foot of the hedge, beneath the  spruce-fir, lying on his side, blood-stained and panting.  Nobody saw  him creep away.  Nobody cared--certainly not his lady acquaintance, who  was too busy receiving glad eyes from the conqueror.    Also, nobody saw him die.  Yet next morning he was dead, stiff and  still on the ground beside the summer-house.  Some think that it was  the injuries he received in his last great fight that killed him.  I do  not.  I could find no wounds upon him sufficiently severe to sustain  that theory.  I think he died of a broken heart.  Don't you?          VII    \"SET A THIEF\"----    Cob arrived in a snowstorm of unparalleled ferocity.  He came upon  extended vans sixty-nine inches from tip to tip, which he seemed as if  he were never going to flap.  All black above, all white below, he was.  The fact was worth noting, because, as seen from below, he looked  neither black nor any other hue, but just indiscriminate dark, unless  he swerved against the little light, and then his white \"hull\" shone  like silver.    In his calm tacking, in his effortless play, in his superb mastery of  the furious gale, one realized that here was one of Nature's  masterpieces.  He arrested the gaze with his serenity, and in his  majesty of flight marked himself as a bird apart.    Here was a bird accustomed to power, to respect, and to wield fear, as  a king might do; but he was no king, even among birds.  He was a great  black-backed gull, immense, austere, and cruel, with eyes as cold as  the waves whose glitter they reflected, and a heart as implacable as  the storm that cherished it; sea-rover, pillager, pirate, swashbuckler,  son of the storm in whose fierce buffetings he rejoiced, master of the  gale upon whose fury he flourished--the very spirit of the ocean's  frontiers, arrayed in the spotless uniform of the sea, sailing under  her bold colors.    And then, as he suddenly came, the watcher, had there been one, would  have looked at him expectantly, for an eagle, bristling with weapons,  so to speak, fierce-eyed, mighty, and scowling, came flapping heavily  across the white-fretted bay.  There is expression in birds, and most  have their feelings and their character stamped upon their whole body.  But there was no expression in Cob.  His cold eyes continued to stare  with steady stoniness, his vast vans to waft an occasional shallow,  lazy quarter-flap, his spotless head to peer down at times.  Once only,  as the real king of the birds, on his course, drew very near, so that  you could hear the deep, dry \"hough! hough!\" of the powerful wings, did  Cob open his red-stained--as it were blood--yellow beak, and give  utterance--one could call it no more--and so instantly close his beak  again and revert to his absolute expressionlessness that one had a job  to realize what, or who, in all that vast scene, had spoken.    \"I'm-Great-Black-Back!\" he said very quietly, quickly, gratingly, and  tersely; and then, as if expecting an answer, added, \"Eh?\" in a hollow  undertone.    The eagle's imperial head jerked round as he flew, and he shot a  stabbing, sheathed glance at the great sea-bird, as a king might at a  man in a crowd who begins to fumble at his hip-pocket.  But, save for  that, he took no further notice, and beat on with his terrific,  piston-like, regular wing-beats; and the gull, that speckless,  dazzling, hardened, hard giant, laughed--laughed, I say, softly and to  himself, hoarsely and insolently: \"How-how-how-how!\"  It was as if he  laughed in derision.    And then a strange thing happened.  From the opposite stupendous  cliffs, draped in snow, bejeweled with icicles, frowning and desolate,  an ominous black shape flung itself furiously, and made straight for  the eagle, barking hoarsely with rage as it came.  Another hollow bark  followed, and a second evil ebony form hurled down from the tottering  cliff-top, and flapped towards the eagle in the path of the first.  Bark echoed bark above the deep mutter of the breakers, and the echoes  along the cliffs answered both uncannily and mockingly.    They were a raven, disturbed from her wool-quilted nest, and her mate;  but if they had been hobgoblins straight from an evil dream, they could  not, in that immense, grim setting, have been much more impressive.    The great black-backed gull said no more, but wheeled on as if nothing  had happened.    The eagle said nothing, and tried to beat on as if nothing had  happened, too.  He did not succeed, for the ravens who had been  addressing him most particularly soon addressed themselves personally  to him; and before he knew just how it all came about, they had  summoned a quite amazing and unexpected aerial acrobatic power, and  were shooting and diving, striking and flapping, about his regal head  in a manner that even _he_ could not pretend any longer to ignore.  No  one, not even a king of all the birds, feels comfortable under the  imminent possibility of losing an eye--and such a haughty, wonderful  eye, too.  Nor did the eagle.  And he showed it.  One presumes he might  have abolished the pair--one or both--but the eagle never let on what  he presumed.  What he _knew_ was that he had nothing to gain in a fight  with such super-hooligans, and everything to lose, for one wound only  might mean a dead eagle _via_ starvation and a dead raven--what was a  dead raven worth, anyway, to him, or anybody else?    Therefore the eagle changed his mind about continuing his course, which  would have taken him above the ravens' nest.  He did it grandly, and  without giving the impression that the ravens had anything to do with  it--he could have squeezed the life out of them with one awful  handshake, if his heart had been as big as his claws.  But they had  something to do with it.  And they knew it.  So did Cob, who laughed  again, hoarsely and as one appreciating a joke, while he wheeled and  wheeled over the following waves, seeing all things and never appearing  to see anything.    Then at last, when the king of all the birds had sunk, like a speck of  floating burnt paper, away over the far, white-mantled hills, the  ravens suddenly evaporated into nowhere.  Probably no one had seen them  go except Cob, and Cob was by now a lonely, dwindling speck away over  the restless ocean.  Then he was not.  He was coming back, swinging  along with great, easy, shallow half-flaps, so sublimely lazy that he  seemed merely to swim through the gale.  But he covered distance; there  was speed as well as majesty in his flight, for all that.    In a very short time he was above the cliffs, silent, sinister, almost  stealthy.  One of the ravens came back suddenly, diving over the crest,  half-demented with anxiety to cover her eggs from that stony stare of  the sea-rover; and Cob, seeing where she had come from, surrendered  himself to the gale, hurtled down-wind, veered, tacked, circled,  rocking, and came down in a series of his oblique plunges--smack-bang  into the middle of a gory dinner-party, consisting of the male raven,  five gray or hooded crows, and one silver herring-gull, feasting upon  the carcass of a dead sheep.    Every head went up, every eye blinked, every wing half-opened, every  beak shut tight as Cob, whom everybody had thought to be miles away by  that time, threw forward his wings, umbrella-fashion, flung them up,  hat-fashion, fanning wide his tail, dropped his giant webbed feet, and  came to anchor with a rush.  Then he folded those wonderful pinions of  his, foot by rustling foot, stared stonily at the amazed, mute company  around him, and, throwing back his immaculate, smooth, low-browed,  spotless head, laughed to the winds, hoarsely, loudly, wildly--a rude,  baleful, transport of mirth:    \"How-how-how-how-how!\"    The raven did not laugh.  He had to feed his sitting wife--not counting  his big self--in that bitter weather, and he was pluming himself upon  having turned the eagle from sight of this gift banquet from Providence  as well as his nest.  The gray crows saw no cause for merriment,  remembering how big the great gull was, and how small are these little,  long-wooled, black-faced hill sheep.  Moreover, sheep do not often  oblige by getting turned turtle in a cleft of rock, and being unable to  right themselves before poor, starving, wild hunters--I won't swear  who, but it was not the raven _this_ time--can come and peck their eyes  out.    Cob looked at them again--all five of the gray crows sitting staring  straight down their own black gouge-beaks, hunched, cold, out-at-heels,  and dejected.  Then he laughed again--burst into another wild, jeering  fit of merriment, and fell to work.    First of all, he pointed out to the raven--his beak was the  pointer--that he was sitting upon the choicest portion of that sheep,  and must make way therefrom _instantly_.  Next, he turned his head and  looked--only looked--at a gray crow that had presumed, upon the turning  of his broad, black back, to recommence feeding, and that hooded crow  moved one yard in one second--out of reach.  And next, Cob, who  apparently loved discipline and cherished good manners, started his  banquet, and allowed the others to start theirs.    But it was an unholy feast.  Cob tugged and tore like a butcher without  any knives.  At times he nearly fell backwards, when the meat gave way;  at times he bolted, and gulped, and choked horribly; at times he was  nearly standing upon his head, and at other times upon his tail; and,  in case the others should find the woolly outside, where they alone  could feed, too easy, he was continually breaking off, to rush--a  red-headed demon from hell now--at the raven, or glare at the crows and  remove them yards, as if his eyes could kill.  As for the herring-gull,  he raced and danced in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17571"],[0,"Piano Tuning: A Simple and Accurate Method for Amateurs (#20)"],[1,"third, perfect fourth and  fifth, and major sixth. The thirds and sixths beat from about 7 to  nearly 12 per second. The exact number of beats for each step in the  system may be calculated from the \"Table of Vibration Numbers\" in  Lesson XIII. For instance, take middle C (2C) at 256, and its major  third, 2E. The exact third, determined by multiplying 256 by 5/4, is  found to be 320. By reference to the table, we find the tempered third  vibrates 322.54. The difference then is 2.54 vibrations per second,  and, knowing that a difference of one vibration from the exact major  third produces 4 beats, we simply multiply 2.54 by 4 and we have  10.16, the number of beats we should hear per second when this third  is tempered correctly. Other intervals may be figured out in like  manner by reference to the various tables given.    It is very doubtful if a beginner could succeed with this system. He  should tune by an easier system until he can hear the beats very  distinctly and judge quite accurately the rapidity of them. Having  acquired this ability, he may try this system and follow it in  preference to others.    In any system used it is well to test your work in the following  manner:    Begin with your lowest major third and strike each third in  succession, ascending chromatically. Of course, each third should beat  slightly faster than the one below it. For instance, in our system of  two octaves, take 1C-E; this third should beat about 5 per second.  Next, take 1C[#]-F, which should beat about 5-1/2 per second. The  beats should increase each test nearly a half beat, or the amount of 5  beats in this octave; hence, 2C-E will beat about 10 per second; or,  using the exact figures, 10.16. After arriving at the last-named test,  2C-E, you may test the remainder of the two octaves by tenths,  beginning with 1C-2E. The tenth is similar to the third  mathematically, and its beats are even more distinct.    We may remark here that our system may be reduced to the compass of an  octave and a half by simply not tuning the octaves upward which reach  beyond 2F[#]; and if anything were to be gained and nothing lost by  shortening the compass of the temperament, we would advise using only  the octave and a half. But in many years of experience in tuning all  imaginable types, styles and kinds of pianos, and by all systems, we  have found good reasons for adopting the two-octave temperament as  laid down in Lesson VIII, for universal application. Its advantages  may be summed up as follows:    ~Simplicity.~--But two kinds of intervals are employed: the fifth and  the octave. The fifth is always tuned to a fundamental below and hence  always flattened, which relieves the tuner of any mental operation to  determine which way he is to temper. Being a regular succession of  fifths and octaves, without a break, the system is easily learned, and  can be followed with little mental strain.    ~Uniformity.~--After the tuner has become well trained in tempering  his fifths, there is little danger of an uneven temperament, as the  various intervals used in trials will prove a false member in some  chord in time to correct it before he has gotten so far from it as to  make the correction difficult. When a correction is necessary, the  offending point is most easily found.    ~Precision.~--In our experience, we have never known another system by  which we could attain the absolute precision gained by this.    ~Stability.~--Stability is the feature wherein rests the paramount  reason for employing two octaves. From what has been said in previous  lessons concerning the liability of some strings to flatten or sharpen  by reason of altering the tension of other strings, the student will  readily see that the temperament should cover a sufficient portion of  the instrument, if possible, to insure that it will stand while the  remaining portion is being tuned. Our two octaves cover nearly all the  strings between the over-strung bass and the brace in the metal plate.  This being the case, any reasonable alteration of the strings beyond,  or outside, the braces from the temperament, will rarely, if ever,  affect it noticeably.    ~Final Inspection.~--Always test every key on the piano, or especially  those of the middle five octaves, for bad unisons. Upon finding one,  search for the string that has stood in tune, by testing each string  of the unison with its octave. This being done, simply bring the other  to it. Go over the whole key-board, striking octaves, and correct any  that might offend. One extremely bad tone or octave may disparage your  reputation, when in reality your work merits commendation.    ~Loose Pins.~--You will occasionally find pianos in which the tuning  pins have become so loose that they will not resist the pull of the  strings. If many of them are in this condition it is better, before  you begin to tune, to take a hammer of considerable weight and drive  them a little. Commence at one end of the row of pins and aim to  strike all the pins with the same force. Those which are tight enough  will not yield to the blow, while those which are loose may require  two or three blows to tighten them sufficiently. This defect is  generally found in very old squares or cheap uprights wherein the  pin-block is of poor material or defective in manufacture or in pianos  which have been abused.    ~Split Bridges.~--Even in pianos of the highest grade, we sometimes  find a string sounding as if there was a pin or some metallic  substance bearing against it. In such cases, find the string and  examine the place where it crosses the bridge. You will often find the  bridge split at that point or the bridge-pin, having yielded to the  pressure of the string, vibrates against the next pin, giving rise to  the singing effect. You can do little if anything toward repairing a  split bridge. You may, however, stop the singing by inserting the  point of your screw-driver between the close pins and pressing them  apart. This will generally stop the difficulty for the time being at  least.    Strings crossing the bridge near a split will not stand in tune well,  and will, perhaps, have to be gone over two or three times. The same  may be said of a broken metal plate. Many old squares have broken  plates; generally found near the overstrung bass, or within the first  octave of the treble. All the tuner can do is to apprise the owner of  the defect and inform her that it will not stand well at this point,  as the intense strain is thrown largely upon the wooden frame, which  will have a tendency to yield gradually to it.    ~Stringing.~--Strings break while the tuner is drawing them up,  sometimes because he does not pull them gradually, gives them an  abrupt turn or draws them too far above the pitch at which they are  intended to stand. More often, however, they break from being rusty at  the point where they pass over the bridge or around the tuning pin.  The best instruction concerning putting on new strings is, follow  appearances. Make the string you put on look just like those on the  instrument. In most modern pianos the string is wound with three coils  around the pin.    You will, of course, have to take out the action; not the key-board,  however, unless it be one of those rare cases where the key-board and  upper action are built to come out together. In the square it is only  necessary to remove the shade over the dampers, and the dampers, which  are all removed easily by taking out the screw at the left. This  allows the whole set of dampers with their support to come out  together.    Treble strings are nearly always passed around the hitch-pin, one wire  thus forming two strings. Take out the old string, noticing how it  passes over and under the felt at the dead end. After removing the  string always give the pin about three turns backward to draw it out  sufficiently so that when a new string is put on, the pin will turn  into the block as far as it did originally. Run one end of the string  barely through the hole in the tuning pin and turn it about twice  around, taking pains that the coils lie closely; then unwind enough  wire (of the same size of course) from your supply to reach down to  the hitch pin and back. Place the string on the bridge pins properly,  draw it as tight as you can by hand and cut it off about three  fingers' width beyond the pin upon which it is to be wound. This will  make about three coils around the pin. Place the end in the hole and  turn up gradually, watching that the string is clear down on hitch pin  and properly laid on the bridge. New strings will require drawing up  two or three times before they will stand in tune, and even then they  will run down in a short time. It is well on this account to leave  them slightly sharp, calling the owner's attention to the fact.    [Illustration: KNOT FOR SPLICING WIRE.]    When a bass string breaks at the point where it starts around the  tuning pin, it can nearly always be spliced and the trouble of sending  it away to have a new one made be avoided. Take a piece of new wire as  large or larger than the old string and splice it to the broken end  by a good secure knot. A knot called the square or ruft knot is the  best for this purpose. When a bass string breaks too far from the pin  to permit of a splice, the only resort will be to send the broken  string to some factory and have a new one made from it.
