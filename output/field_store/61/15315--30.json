There are other examples of hymeneal rites to which the male  offers no resistance.    The males of my menagerie of Gardeners, one and all eviscerated, speak  of similar customs. They are the victims of the females when the latter  have no further use for them. For four months, from April to August, the  insects pair off continually; sometimes tentatively, but usually the  mating is effective. The business of mating is all but endless for these  fiery spirits.    The Gardener is prompt and businesslike in his affairs of the heart. In  the midst of the crowd, with no preliminary courtship, the male throws  himself upon the female. The female thus embraced raises her head a  trifle as a sign of acquiescence, while the cavalier beats the back of  her neck with his antennae. The embrace is brief, and they abruptly  separate; after a little refreshment the two parties are ready for other  adventures, and yet others, so long as there are males available. After  the feast, a brief and primitive wooing; after the wooing, the feast; in  such delights the life of the Gardener passes.    The females of my collection were in no proper ratio to the number of  aspiring lovers; there were five females to twenty males. No matter;  there was no rivalry, no hustling; all went peacefully and sooner or  later each was satisfied.    I should have preferred a better proportioned assembly. Chance, not  choice, had given me that at my disposal. In the early spring I had  collected all the Gardeners I could find under the stones of the  neighbourhood, without distinguishing the sexes, for they are not easy  to recognise merely by external characteristics. Later on I learned by  watching them that a slight excess of size was the distinctive sign of  the female. My menagerie, so ill-proportioned in the matter of sex, was  therefore the result of chance. I do not suppose this preponderance of  males exists in natural conditions. On the other hand, one never sees  such numerous groups at liberty, in the shelter of the same stone. The  Gardener lives an almost solitary life; it is rarely that one finds two  or three beneath the same object of shelter. The gathering in my  menagerie was thus exceptional, although it did not lead to confusion.  There is plenty of room in the glass cage for excursions to a distance  and for all their habitual manoeuvres. Those who wish for solitude can  obtain it; those who wish for company need not seek it.    For the rest, captivity cannot lie heavily on them; that is proved by  their frequent feasts, their constant mating. They could not thrive  better in the open; perhaps not so well, for food is less abundant under  natural conditions. In the matter of well-being the prisoners are in a  normal condition, favourable to the maintenance of their usual habits.    It is true that encounters of beetle with beetle are more frequent here  than in the open. Hence, no doubt, arise more opportunities for the  females to persecute the males whom they no longer require; to fall upon  them from the rear and eviscerate them. This pursuit of their onetime  lovers is aggravated by their confined quarters; but it certainly is not  caused thereby, for such customs are not suddenly originated.    The mating season over, the female encountering a male in the open must  evidently regard him as fair game, and devour him as the termination of  the matrimonial rites. I have turned over many stones, but have never  chanced upon this spectacle, but what has occurred in my menagerie is  sufficient to convince me. What a world these beetles live in, where the  matron devours her mate so soon as her fertility delivers her from the  need of him! And how lightly the males must be regarded by custom, to be  served in this manner!    Is this practice of post-matrimonial cannibalism a general custom in the  insect world? For the moment, I can recollect only three characteristic  examples: those of the Praying Mantis, the Golden Gardener, and the  scorpion of Languedoc. An analogous yet less brutal practice--for the  victim is defunct before he is eaten--is a characteristic of the Locust  family. The female of the white-faced Decticus will eagerly devour the  body of her dead mate, as will the Green Grasshopper.    To a certain extent this custom is excused by the nature of the insect's  diet; the Decticus and the Grasshopper are essentially carnivorous.  Encountering a dead body of their own species, a female will devour it,  even if it be the body of her latest mate.    But what are we to say in palliation of the vegetarians? At the approach  of the breeding season, before the eggs are laid, the Ephippigera turns  upon her still living mate, disembowels him, and eats as much of him as  her appetite will allow.    The cheerful Cricket shows herself in a new light at this season; she  attacks the mate who lately wooed her with such impassioned serenades;  she tears his wings, breaks his musical thighs, and even swallows a few  mouthfuls of the instrumentalist. It is probable that this deadly  aversion of the female for the male at the end of the mating season is  fairly common, especially among the carnivorous insects. But what is the  object of this atrocious custom? That is a question I shall not fail to  answer when circumstances permit.          CHAPTER X    THE FIELD-CRICKET      The breeding of Crickets demands no particular preparations. A little  patience is enough--patience, which according to Buffon is genius; but  which I, more modestly, will call the superlative virtue of the  observer. In April, May, or later we may establish isolated couples in  ordinary flower-pots containing a layer of beaten earth. Their diet will  consist of a leaf of lettuce renewed from time to time. The pot must be  covered with a square of glass to prevent the escape of the inmates.    I have gathered some very curious data from these makeshift appliances,  which may be used with and as a substitute for the cages of wire gauze,  although the latter are preferable. We shall return to the point  presently. For the moment let us watch the process of breeding, taking  care that the critical hour does not escape us.    It was during the first week of June that my assiduous visits were at  last repaid. I surprised the female motionless, with the oviduct planted  vertically in the soil. Heedless of the indiscreet visitor, she remained  for a long time stationed at the same point. Finally she withdrew her  oviduct, and effaced, though without particular care, the traces of the  hole in which her eggs were deposited, rested for a moment, walked  away, and repeated the operation; not once, but many times, first here,  then there, all over the area at her disposal. Her behaviour was  precisely the same as that of the Decticus, except that her movements  were more deliberate. At the end of twenty-four hours her eggs were  apparently all laid. For greater certainty I waited a couple of days  longer.    I then examined the earth in the pot. The eggs, of a straw-yellow, are  cylindrical in form, with rounded ends, and measure about one-tenth of  an inch in length. They are placed singly in the soil, in a  perpendicular position.    I have found them over the whole area of the pot, at a depth of a  twelfth of an inch. As closely as the difficulties of the operation will  allow, I have estimated the eggs of a single female, upon passing the  earth through a sieve, at five or six hundred. Such a family will  certainly undergo an energetic pruning before very long.    The egg of the Cricket is a curiosity, a tiny mechanical marvel. After  hatching it appears as a sheath of opaque white, open at the summit,  where there is a round and very regular aperture, to the edge of which  adheres a little valve like a skull-cap which forms the lid. Instead of  breaking at random under the thrusts or the cuts of the new-formed  larva, it opens of itself along a line of least resistance which occurs  expressly for the purpose. The curious process of the actual hatching  should be observed.    A fortnight after the egg is laid two large eye-marks, round and of a  reddish black, are seen to darken the forward extremity of the egg.  Next, a little above these two points, and right at the end of the  cylinder, a tiny circular capsule or swelling is seen. This marks the  line of rupture, which is now preparing. Presently the translucency of  the egg allows us to observe the fine segmentation of the tiny inmate.  Now is the moment to redouble our vigilance and to multiply our visits,  especially during the earlier part of the day.    Fortune favours the patient, and rewards my assiduity Round the little  capsule changes of infinite delicacy have prepared the line of least  resistance. The end of the egg, pushed by the head of the inmate,  becomes detached, rises, and falls aside like the top of a tiny phial.  The Cricket issues like a Jack-in-the-box.    When the Cricket has departed the shell remains distended, smooth,  intact, of the purest white, with the circular lid hanging to the mouth  of the door of exit. The egg of the bird breaks clumsily under the blows  of a wart-like excrescence which is formed expressly upon the beak of  the unborn bird; the egg of the Cricket, of a far superior structure,  opens like an ivory casket. The pressure of the inmate's head is  sufficient to work the hinge.    The moment he is deprived of his white tunic, the young Cricket, pale  all over, almost white, begins to struggle against the overlying soil.  He strikes it with his mandibles; he sweeps it aside, kicking it  backwards and downwards; and being of a powdery quality, which offers no  particular resistance, he soon arrives at the surface, and henceforth  knows the joys of the sun, and the perils of intercourse with the  living; a tiny, feeble creature, little larger than a flea. His colour  deepens.
