Indeed the severities and rigors which I then exercised were extreme,  but they did not appease this appetite for the cross. It is Thou alone,  O Crucified Saviour, who canst make the cross truly effectual for the  death of self. Let others bless themselves in their ease or gaiety,  grandeur or pleasures, poor temporary heavens; for me, my desires were  all turned another way, even to the silent path of suffering for  Christ, and to be united to Him, through the mortification of all that  was of nature in me, that my senses, appetites and will, being dead to  these, might wholly live in Him.    I obtained leave to go to Paris for the cure of my eye; and yet it was  much more through the desire I had to see Monsieur Bertot, a man of  profound experience, whom Mother Granger had lately assigned to me for  my director. I went to take leave of my father, who embraced me with  peculiar tenderness, little thinking then that it would be our last  adieu.    Paris was a place now no longer to be dreaded as in times past. The  throngs only served to draw me into a deep recollection, and the noise  of the streets augmented my inward prayer. I saw Monsieur Bertot, who  did not prove of that service to me, which he would have been if I had  then the power to explain myself. Though I wished earnestly to hide  nothing from him, yet God held me so closely to Him, that I could  scarcely tell anything at all. As soon as I spoke to him, everything  vanished from my mind, so that I could remember nothing but some few  faults. As I saw him very seldom, and nothing stayed in my  recollection, and as I read of nothing any way resembling my case, I  knew not how to explain myself. Besides, I desired to make nothing  known, but the evil which was in me. Therefore Monsieur Bertot knew me  not, even till his death. This was of great utility to me, by taking  away every support, and making me truly die to myself.    I went to pass the ten days, from the Ascension to Whitsuntide, at an  abbey four leagues from Paris, the abbess of which had a particular  friendship for me. Here my union with God seemed to be deeper and more  continued, becoming always simple, at the same time more close and  intimate.    One day I awoke suddenly at four o'clock in the morning, with a strong  impression on my mind that my father was dead. At the same time my soul  was in a very great contentment, yet my love for him affected it with  sorrow, and my body with weakness. Under the strokes and daily troubles  which befell me, my will was so subservient to Thine, O my God, that it  appeared absolutely united to it. There seemed, indeed, to be no will  left in me but Thine only. My own disappeared, and no desires,  tendencies or inclinations were left, but to the one sole object of  whatever was most pleasing to Thee, be it what it would. If I had a  will, it was in union with thine, as two well tuned lutes in concert.  That which is not touched renders the same sound as that which is  touched; it is but one and the same sound, one pure harmony. It is this  union of the will which establishes in perfect peace. Yet, though my  own will was lost I have found since, in the strange states I have been  obliged to pass through, how much it had yet to cost me to have it  totally lost. How many souls are there which think their own wills  quite lost, while they are yet very far from it! They would find they  still subsist, if they met with severe trials. Who is there who does  not wish something for himself, either of interest, wealth, honor,  pleasure, conveniency and liberty. He who thinks his mind loose from  all these objects, because he possesses them, would soon perceive his  attachment to them, were he stripped of those he possessed. If there  are found in a whole age three persons so dead to everything, as to be  utterly resigned to providence without any exception, they may well  pass for prodigies of grace.    In the afternoon as I was with the abbess, I told her I had strong  presentiments of my father's death. Indeed I could hardly speak, I was  so affected within. Presently one came to tell her that she was wanted  in the parlor. It was a messenger come in haste, with an account from  my husband that my father was ill. And as I afterward found, he  suffered only twelve hours. He was therefore by this time dead. The  abbess returning, said, \"Here is a letter from your husband, who writes  that your father is taken violently ill.\" I said to her, \"He is dead, I  cannot have a doubt about it.\"    I sent away to Paris immediately, to hire a coach, to go the sooner;  mine waited for me at the midway. I went off at nine o'clock at night.  They said. I \"was going to destroy myself.\" I had no acquaintance with  me as I had sent away my maid to Paris, to put everything in order  there. Being in a religious house, I had no mind to keep a footman with  me. The abbess told me, that \"since I thought my father was dead, it  would be rashness in me to expose myself, and run the risk of my life  in that manner. Coaches could hardly pass the way I was going, it being  no beaten road.\" I answered, \"It was my indispensable duty to go to  assist my father, and that I ought not, on a bare apprehension, to  exempt myself from it.\" I then went alone, abandoned to Providence,  with people unknown. My weakness was so great, that I could hardly keep  my seat in the coach. I was often forced to alight, on account of  dangerous places in the road.    In this way I was obliged, about midnight, to cross a forest, notorious  for murders and robberies. The most intrepid dreaded it; but my  resignation left me scarce any room to think at all about it. What  fears and uneasiness does a resigned soul spare itself! All alone I  arrived within five leagues of my own habitation, where I found my  confessor who had opposed me, with one of my relations, waiting for me.  The sweet consolation I had enjoyed, when alone, was now interrupted.  My confessor, ignorant of my state, restrained me entirely. My grief  was of such a nature that I could not shed a tear. And I was ashamed to  hear a thing which I knew but too well, without giving any exterior  mark of grief. The inward and profound peace I enjoyed dawned on my  countenance. The state I was in did not permit me to speak, or to do  such things as are usually expected from persons of piety. I could do  nothing but love and be silent.    I found on my arrival at home, that my father was already buried  because of the excessive heat. It was ten o'clock at night. All wore  the habit of mourning. I had traveled thirty leagues in a day and a  night. As I was very weak, not having taken any nourishment, I was  instantly put to bed.    About two o'clock in the morning my husband got up, and having gone out  of my chamber, he returned presently, crying out with all his might,  \"My daughter is dead!\" She was my only daughter, as dearly beloved as  truly lovely. She had so many graces both of body and mind conferred on  her, that one must have been insensible not to have loved her. She had  an extraordinary share of love to God. Often was she found in corners  at prayer. As soon as she perceived me at prayer, she came and joined.  If she discovered that I had been without her, she would weep bitterly  and cry, \"Ah, mamma, you pray but I don't.\" When we were alone and she  saw my eyes closed she would whisper, \"Are you asleep?\" Then she would  cry out, \"Ah no, you are praying to our dear Jesus.\" Dropping on her  knees before me she would begin to pray too. She was several times  whipped by her grandmother, because she said, she would never have any  other husband but our Lord. She could never make her say otherwise. She  was innocent and modest as a little angel; very dutiful and endearing,  and withal very beautiful. Her father doted on her, to me she was very  dear, much more for the qualities of her mind than those of her  beautiful person. I looked upon her as my only consolation on earth.  She had as much affection for me, as her brother had aversion and  contempt. She died of an unseasonable bleeding. But what shall I say?  She died by the hands of Him who was pleased, for wise reasons of His  own, to strip me of all.    There now remained to me only the son of my sorrow. He fell ill to the  point of death, but was restored at the prayer of Mother Granger who  was now my only consolation after God. I no more wept for my child than  for my father. I could only say, \"Thou, O Lord, gave her to me; it  pleases Thee to take her back again, for she was Thine.\" As for my  father, his virtue was so generally known, that I must rather be  silent, than enter upon the subject. His reliance on God, his faith and  patience were wonderful. Both died in July, 1672. Henceforth crosses  were not spared me, and though I had abundance of them hitherto, yet  they were only the shadows of those which I have been since obliged to  pass through. In this spiritual marriage I claimed for my dowry only  crosses, scourges, persecutions, ignominies, lowliness, and nothingness  of self, which in God's great goodness, and for wise ends, as I have  seen, has been pleased to grant and confer upon me.    One day, being in great distress on account of the redoubling of  outward and inward crosses, I went into my closet to give vent to my  grief. M. Bertot was brought into my mind, with this wish, \"Oh, that he  was sensible of what I suffer!\" Though he wrote but very seldom, and  with great difficulty, yet he wrote me a letter dated the same day  about the cross. It was the finest and most consolatory he ever wrote  me on that subject. Sometimes my spirit was so oppressed with continual  crosses, which scarcely gave me any relaxation, that when alone my eyes  turned every way, to see if they could find anything to give relief.

Dr. John Earl had friends who understood the complex and extensive  nature of these sentiments, and, whatever might be their opinion  concerning his guilt or innocence of the specific charge under  discussion, they greatly feared the graver charge which emanated from  the chaotic darkness of superstition, ignorance, prejudice and jealousy  and the location of which could be determined only by occasional and  angry flashes of venom.    While these things were occurring, Dr. Earl had come to New York and had  gone directly to the district attorney and notified him that, if needed,  he could be found at his house on East 53rd Street, but he assured that  official that he knew nothing of the affair whatever.    This was treated as bravado by those who believed in his guilt and as  vindication by those who asserted his innocence.    His brother Frank hastened from a summer resort in the fastnesses of the  Rockies and his sister and brother-in-law returned to town from Newport.    One day, Silvia Holland appeared at the coroner's office and asked to  see the box in which the candied fruit had arrived. She examined it  critically for several minutes, and then asked for the wrapper  containing the address and postage stamps. There were three ten-cent and  two fifteen-cent stamps on the paper, although it was apparent that half  that amount in postage would have carried the package. She compared the  handwriting with samples of Dr. Earl's, and it was only too evident that  both address and message were written by him.    When she returned to her office she found Miss Renner waiting for her in  response to a telephone message. The two women had seen much of each  other after their meeting at the League House and a deep regard had  sprung up between them. For the time being, Miss Renner was doing  special work on one of the New York papers, and lending her voice to the  suffrage cause between assignments. They exchanged greetings, and then  the little Westerner said quietly, \"You wanted me?\"    Miss Holland looked at her long and searchingly. \"Yes, I both want and  need you, my dear. Your paper has been rather vindictive in its pursuit  of evidence against Dr. Earl. I want you to go to the district attorney  and ask him personally to examine the inside of the lid of the box which  contained the fruit, also the scalloped paper that covered the fruit. If  he does so, he will find that a green gage, an apricot or a plum, which  was seedless, of course, rested on top of the paper, and was crushed  against the lid of the box. The stain is quite distinct on both paper  and cover, and shows that there was only one such piece of fruit placed  there. Of course, it contained the poison, and was placed on top,  because it would naturally be eaten first.\"    Carroll Renner looked at her in amazement.    \"If I do that he will order the immediate arrest of Dr. Earl; it will  put him in jail and possibly lead to his conviction. Is that what you  desire?\" She looked up at the taller woman searchingly.    \"Surely I do--if he is guilty,\" Miss Holland replied, without changing  her expression. \"There is no doubt that it will cause his immediate  arrest,\" she added, \"but even that is preferable to this suspense with  everybody suspecting him and no opportunity to defend himself.\"    She turned away, and Carroll slipped her arm about her waist. \"Dear  Silvia, I'll go--on one condition.\"    \"And that is?\" came in a rather muffled voice.    \"That you will defend him yourself!\" said Miss Renner. Miss Holland  turned and caught her in her arms. \"I can't do that,\" she said. \"I  couldn't, anyhow, without being asked, and besides, he will need the  most skillful criminal lawyer in New York to defend him. I should make a  sorry mess of it.\"    Carroll drew her down on a settee and held her hands firmly. \"You might  just as well be a man, if you are going to talk like that--always ready  to let women go ahead until something really worth while comes along,  and then saying 'only a man can do big, difficult things.' After all  you've said, are you going to hesitate when it comes to crossing  professional swords with a man? Come now, promise me; if I go to the  district attorney, you will defend him.\"    \"But I have not been employed, or even asked to defend him,\" she  insisted. \"You must see how unprofessional it would be, Carroll.\"    \"Professional! that's what the doctors say when they refuse to save your  life because they don't want to be discourteous to a fellow  practitioner,\" answered Carroll. \"Well, if the life of the man I loved  was at stake I wouldn't wait for somebody to come and hire me to defend  him!\"    \"Carroll!\" cried Silvia.    \"Silvia!\" she retorted. \"Will your highness deign to accept employment  if it is offered you by his family?\"    \"Oh, Carroll, I can't let you drum up business----\"    \"You should be shaken, Silvia,\" her friend answered. \"Of course  everybody in the country knows that you live in daily fear of the  poorhouse, and keep an advertising bureau busy trying to find you  employment! However, I suspected you would make these silly objections,  so I told Frank Earl yesterday that he ought to move heaven and earth to  get you to defend his brother. He nearly fell on my neck, and he is now  giving me absent treatment or holding a thought that I may succeed in  making you see that you could do more for the doctor than any other New  York lawyer.\"    \"That isn't true, Carroll,\" she said. \"I wish it were, but it isn't, and  I haven't been able to think of any one that I want to see take up his  defense.\"    \"Naturally, because you know you ought to do it yourself. Now listen to  me.\" Miss Renner put her hands on Silvia's shoulders. \"We haven't known  each other long, but it doesn't follow that we don't know each other  well. If John Earl were my brother I should give you no peace until you  promised to defend him, not alone because you have the requisite skill  as an attorney, but because you would give this case the devotion, the  insight, that are not to be bought with money. Now you know my terms;  shall I go to the district attorney?\"    Silvia kissed her impulsively. \"Yes, dear; go--go at once!\" Her eyes  filled and her exquisite voice quivered with the strain of the emotion  she could no longer conceal. \"Oh, Carroll, I'm glad to have you now;  come back to me afterward and tell me all about it!\"          CHAPTER XVII    THE ARREST OF DR. JOHN EARL      Early the next morning Dr. John Earl was arrested for the murder of Emma  Bell and was remanded by the magistrate to The Tombs without bail to  await the action of the grand jury, which was soon to convene. Both he  and his family had foreseen the event, and he had made the necessary  arrangements for the conduct of his business. Humiliating as his arrest  was, they all bore it with Spartan courage, and prepared to ransack the  earth, if need be, to establish his innocence.    Leonora Kimball and her mother returned from Bar Harbor to find their  city friends almost unanimously arrayed against Dr. Earl, and they were  not themselves in the best humor with the tide of ill fortune that had  swept them into these muddy currents. They went immediately to The  Tombs, and in the interview that followed Dr. Earl insisted that Leonora  should consider herself released from her engagement so long as the  least taint was attached to his name in connection with this charge. She  protested that this was the hour of his need, and she could not think of  such a thing, but he caught the tone of doubt in her voice, and the lack  of genuine sympathy in her manner. There passed rapidly through his mind  the thought that the electric chair might be just ahead of him; a long  imprisonment might be his fate; he might lose the affection of friends  and the respect of strangers, but if in this hour of bitter ordeal,  guilty or innocent, whichever she might believe, his affianced wife did  not show supreme faith and devotion, he was indeed a beggar in the realm  of love. Carroll's ominous words about the malign stars that governed  her fate recurred to his mind, and he thought of his contest with  himself, and his decision when, defying the possibility of separation,  inharmony or divorce, he elected to keep his plighted troth whatever his  post-nuptial fate might be.    But in the recesses of his prison he had yearned for love, for the  divine, illuminating rays that had lighted the path of many a martyr to  the stake; of many a hero to the cannon's mouth; of not a few convicts  to the gallows; of many a sublime philosopher to the dungeon or the  ax--and all his misfortunes seemed but fleecy down compared to the  weight which this sense of isolation and aloofness from the tenderness  of the world brought to him. He looked at her fair young face, clouded  and troubled now with doubts and annoyance, and with a sinking heart he  realized that her personal vexation loomed as large upon the horizon of  her mind as the shame and danger that had overtaken him.    \"Fo"]]]
