But  before he ratified these mild conditions with the Danes, he required  that they should give him one pledge of their submission, and of  their inclination to incorporate with the English, by declaring their  conversion to Christianity.[*] Guthrum and his army had no aversion to  the proposal; and, without much instruction, or argument, or conference,  they were all admitted to baptism. The king answered for Guthrum at the  font, gave him the name of Athelstan, and received him as his adopted  son.[**]        [* Chron. Sax. p. 85.]        [** Asser. p. 10. Chron. Sax. p. 90.]    The success of this expedient seemed to correspond to Alfred's hopes:  the greater part of the Danes settled peaceably in their new quarters:  some smaller bodies of the same nation, which were dispersed in Mercia,  were distributed into the five cities of Derby, Leicester, Stamford,  Lincoln, and Nottingham, and were thence called the Fif or Five-burgers.  The more turbulent and unquiet made an expedition into France, under the  command of Hastings;[*] and except by a short incursion of Danes, who  sailed up the Thames, and landed at Fulham, but suddenly retreated to  their ships, on finding the country in a posture of defence, Alfred was  not for some years infested by the inroads of those barbarians.[**]        [* W. Malms, lib. ii. cap. 4. Ingulph. p. 26.]        [** Asser. p. 11.]    The king employed this interval of tranquillity in restoring order to  the state, which had been shaken by so many violent convulsions; in  establishing civil and military institutions; in composing the minds of  men to industry and justice; and in providing against the return of like  calamities. He was, more properly than his grandfather Egbert, the sole  monarch of the English, (for so the Saxons were now universally called,)  because the kingdom of Mercia was at last incorporated in his state,  and was governed by Ethelbert, his brother-in-law, who bore the title of  earl; and though the Danes, who peopled East Anglia and Northumberland,  were for some time ruled immediately by their own princes, they all  acknowledged a subordination to Alfred, and submitted to his superior  authority. As equality among subjects is the great source of concord,  Alfred gave the same laws to the Danes and English, and put them  entirely on a like footing in the administration both of civil and  criminal justice. The fine for the murder of a Dane was the same with  that for the murder of an Englishman; the great symbol of equality in  those ages.    The king, after rebuilding the ruined cities, particularly London,[*]  which had been destroyed by the Danes in the reign of Ethelwolf,  established a regular militia for the defence of the kingdom. He  ordained that all his people should be armed and registered; he assigned  them a regular rotation of duty; he distributed part into the castles  and fortresses, which he built at proper places;[**] he required another  part to take the field on any alarm, and to assemble at stated places of  rendezvous; and he left a sufficient number at home, who were employed  in the cultivation of the land, and who afterwards took their turn in  military service.[***]        [* Asser. p. 15. Chron. Sax. p. 88. M. West. p. 171. Sim.       Dunelm. p. 131. Brompton, p. 812. Alured. Beverl. ex edit.       Hearns, p. 106.]        [** Asser. p 18. Ingulph. p. 27.]        [*** Chron. Sax. p. 92, 93.]    The whole kingdom was like one great garrison; and the Danes could no  sooner appear in one place, than a sufficient number was assembled  to oppose them, without leaving the other quarters defenceless or  disarmed.[*]        [* Spelman's Life of Alfred, p. 147, edit. 1709.]    But Alfred, sensible that the proper method of opposing an enemy who  made incursions by sea, was to meet them on their own element, took care  to provide himself with a naval force,[*] which, though the most  natural defence of an island, had hitherto been totally neglected by  the English. He increased the shipping of his kingdom both in number and  strength, and trained his subjects in the practice as well of sailing  as of naval action. He distributed his armed vessels in proper stations  around the island, and was sure to meet the Danish ships, either before  or after they had landed their troops, and to pursue them in all their  incursions. Though the Danes might suddenly, by surprise, disembark  on the coast, which was generally become desolate by their frequent  ravages, they were encountered by the English fleet in their retreat;  and escaped not, as formerly, by abandoning their booty, but paid, by  their total destruction, the penalty of the disorders which they had  committed.        [* Asser. p. 9. M. West. p. 179.]    In this manner Alfred repelled several inroads of these piratical  Danes, and maintained his kingdom, during some years, in safety and  tranquillity. A fleet of a hundred and twenty ships of war was stationed  upon the coast; and being provided with warlike engines, as well as  with expert seamen, both Frisians and English, (for Alfred supplied the  defects of his own subjects by engaging able foreigners in his service,)  maintained a superiority over those smaller bands, with which England  had so often been infested.[*]        [* Asser. p. 11. Chiron Sax p. 86, 87. M. West. p. 176.]    But at last Hastings, the famous Danish chief, having ravaged all the  provinces of France, both along the sea-coast and the Loire and Seine,  and being obliged to quit that country, more by the desolation which  he himself had occasioned, than by the resistance of the inhabitants,  appeared off the coast of Kent with a fleet of three hundred and thirty  sail. The greater part of the enemy disembarked in the Rother and seized  the fort of Apuldore. Hastings himself, commanding a fleet of eighty  sail, entered the Thames, and fortifying Milton, in Kent, began to  spread his forces over the country, and to commit the most destructive  ravages. But Alfred, on the first alarm of this descent, flew to the  defence of his people, at the head of a select band of soldiers, whom he  always kept about his person,[*] and, gathering to him the armed militia  from all quarters, appeared in the field with a force superior to the  enemy. All straggling parties, whom necessity, or love of plunder, had  drawn to a distance from their chief encampment, were cut off by the  English;[**] and these pirates, instead of increasing their spoil, found  themselves cooped up in their fortifications, and obliged to subsist by  the plunder which they had brought from France. Tired of this situation,  which must in the end prove ruinous to them, the Danes at Apuldore rose  suddenly from their encampment, with an intention of marching towards  the Thames, and passing over into Essex: but they escaped not the  vigilance of Alfred, who encountered them at Farnham, put them to  rout,[***] seized all their horses and baggage, and chased the runaways  on board their ships, which carried them up the Colne to Mersey, in  Essex, where they intrenched themselves. Hastings, at the same time, and  probably by concert, made a like movement; and deserting Milton,  took possession of Bamflete, near the Isle of Canvey, in the same  county,[****] where he hastily threw up fortifications for his defence  against the power of Alfred.        [* Asser. p. 19.]        [** Chron. Sax. p. 92.]        [*** Chron. Sax. p. 93. Flor. Wigorn. p. 595.]        [**** Chron. Sax. p. 93.]    Unfortunately for the English, Guthrum, prince of the East Anglian  Danes, was now dead; as was also Guthred, whom the king had appointed  governor of the Northumbrians; and those restless tribes, being  no longer restrained by the authority of their princes, and being  encouraged by the appearance of so great a body of their countrymen,  broke into rebellion, shook off the authority of Alfred, and yielding to  their inveterate habits of war and depredation,[*] embarked on board two  hundred and forty vessels, and appeared before Exeter, in the west of  England. Alfred lost not a moment in opposing this new enemy. Having  left some forces at London to make head against Hastings and the other  Danes, he marched suddenly to the west,[**] and, falling on the  rebels before they were aware, pursued them to their ships with great  slaughter.        [* Chron. Sax. p. 92.]        [** Chron. Sax. p. 93.]    These ravagers, sailing next to Sussex, began to plunder the country  near Chichester; but the order which Alfred had everywhere established,  sufficed here, without his presence, for the defence of the place,  and the rebels, meeting with a new repulse, in which many of them were  killed, and some of their ships taken,[*] were obliged to put again to  sea, and were discouraged from attempting any other enterprise.        [* Chron. Sax p. 96. Flor. Wigorn. p. 596.]    Meanwhile the Danish invaders in Essex, having united their force under  the command of Hastings, advanced into the inland country, and made  spoil of all around them; but soon had reason to repent of their  temerity. The English army left in London, assisted by a body of the  citizens, attacked the enemy's intrenchments at Bamflete, overpowered  the garrison, and having done great execution upon them, carried off  the wife and two sons of Hastings.[*] Alfred generously spared these  captives, and even restored them to Hastings,[**] on condition that he  should depart the kingdom.        [* Chron. Sax. p. 94. M. West. w 178.]        [** M. West, p. 179.]    But though the king had thus honorably rid himself of this dangerous  enemy, he had not entirely subdued or expelled the invaders. The  piratical Danes willingly followed in an excursion any prosperous  leader who gave them hopes of booty, but were not so easily induced to  relinquish their enterprise, or submit to return,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19212"],[0,"The History of England in Three Volumes, Vol. I., Part B. (#20)"],[1,"s, remitted to the prince  of Wales the payment of the fifty thousand pounds;[****] which were  stipulated by treaty, and which, it is probable, the poverty of  the country made it absolutely impossible for him to levy. But,  notwithstanding this indulgence, complaints of iniquities soon arose  on the side of the vanquished: the English, insolent on their easy and  bloodless victory, oppressed the inhabitants of the districts which were  yielded to them: the lords marchers committed with impunity all kinds  of violence on their Welsh neighbors: new and more severe terms were  imposed on Lewellyn himself; and Edward, when the prince attended him  at Worcester, exacted a promise that he would retain no person in his  principality who should be obnoxious to the English monarch.[****]         * Rymer, vol. ii. p. 68.

There were other personal insults which raised the indignation of the  Welsh, and made them determine rather to encounter a force which they  had already experienced to be so much superior, than to bear oppression  from the haughty victors. Prince David, seized with the national spirit,  made peace with his brother, and promised to concur in the defence of  public liberty. The Welsh flew to arms; and Edward, not displeased with  the occasion of making his conquest final and absolute, assembled all  his military tenants, and advanced into Wales with an army which the  inhabitants could not reasonably hope to resist. The situation of the  country gave the Welsh at first some advantage over Luke de Tany, one  of Edward's captains, who had passed the Menau with a detachment;[*]  but Lewelly, being surprised by Mortimer, was defeated and slain in an  action, and two thousand of his followers were put to the sword.[**]  David, who succeeded him in the principality, could never collect an  army sufficient to face the English; and being chased from hill to hill,  and hunted from one retreat to another, was obliged to conceal himself  under various disguises, and was at last betrayed in his lurking-place  to the enemy.      {1283.} Edward sent him in chains to Shrewsbury; and bringing him to  a formal trial before all the peers of England, ordered this sovereign  prince to be hanged, drawn, and quartered, as a traitor, for defending  by arms the liberties of his native country, together with his own  hereditary authority.[***] All the Welsh nobility submitted to the  conqueror; the laws of England, with the sheriffs and other ministers of  justice, were established in that principality; and though it was long  before national antipathies were extinguished, and a thorough union  attained between the people, yet this important conquest, which it had  required eight hundred years fully to effect, was at last, through the  abilities of Edward, completed by the English.    {1284} The king, sensible that nothing kept alive the ideas of military  valor and of ancient glory so much as the traditional poetry of the  people, which, assisted by the power of music and the jollity of  festivals, made deep impression on the minds of the youth, gathered  together all the Welsh bards, and from a barbarous, though not absurd  policy, ordered them to be put to death.[****]         * Walsing. p. 50.

There prevails a vulgar story, which, as it well suits the capacity  of the monkish writers, is carefully recorded by them; that Edward,  assembling the Welsh, promised to give them a prince of unexceptionable  manners, a Welshman by birth, and one who could speak no other language.  On their acclamations of joy, and promise of obedience, he invested in  the principality his second son, Edward, then an infant, who had been  born at Carnarvon. The death of his eldest son Alphonso, soon after,  made young Edward heir of the monarchy; the principality of Wales was  fully annexed.    [Illustration: 1_178_carnaryon.jpg CARNARVON CASTLE]    {1286.} The settlement of Wales appeared so complete to Edward, that  in less than two years after, he went abroad, in order to make peace  between Alphonso, king of Arragon, and Philip the Fair, who had lately  succeeded his father, Philip the Hardy, on the throne of France.[*] The  difference between these two princes had arisen about the kingdom of  Sicily, which the pope, after his hopes from England failed him, had  bestowed on Charles, brother to St. Lewis, and which was claimed upon  other titles by Peter, king of Arragon, father to Alphonso. Edward had  powers from both princes to settle the terms of peace, and he succeeded  in his endeavors; but as the controversy nowise regards England, we  shall not enter into a detail of it. He staid abroad above three years;  and on his return found many disorders to have prevailed, both from open  violence and from the corruption of justice.    Thomas Chamberlain, a gentleman of some note, had assembled several of  his associates at Boston, in Lincolnshire, under pretence of holding  a tournament, an exercise practised by the gentry only; but in reality  with a view of plundering the rich fair of Boston, and robbing the  merchants. To facilitate his purpose, he privately set fire to the town;  and while the inhabitants were employed in quenching the flames,  the conspirators broke into the booths, and carried off the goods.  Chamberlain himself was detected and hanged; but maintained so steadily  the point of honor to his accomplices, that he could not be prevailed  on, by offers or promises, to discover any of them. Many other instances  of robbery and violence broke out in all parts of England; though the  singular circumstances attending this conspiracy have made it alone be  particularly recorded by historians.[**]         * Rymer, vol. ii. p. 149,150, 174.         ** Heming vol. i. p. 16, 17.    {1289.} But the corruption of the judges, by which the fountains of  justice were poisoned, seemed of still more dangerous consequence.  Edward, in order to remedy this prevailing abuse, summoned a parliament,  and brought the judges to a trial; where all of them, except two, who  were clergymen, were convicted of this flagrant iniquity, were fined,  and deposed. The amount of the fines levied upon them is alone a  sufficient proof of their guilt; being above one hundred thousand marks,  an immense sum in those days, and sufficient to defray the charges of an  expensive war between two great kingdoms. The king afterwards made all  the new judges swear that they would take no bribes; but his expedient  of deposing and fining the old ones, was the more effectual remedy.    We now come to give an account of the state of affairs in Scotland,  which gave rise to the most interesting transactions of this reign, and  of some of the subsequent; though the intercourse of that kingdom with  England, either in peace or war, had hitherto produced so few events of  moment, that, to avoid tediousness, we have omitted many of them, and  have been very concise in relating the rest. If the Scots had, before  this period, any real history worthy of the name, except what they glean  from scattered passages in the English historians, those events, however  minute, yet being the only foreign transactions of the nation, might  deserve a place in it.    Though the government of Scotland had been continually exposed to those  factions and convulsions which are incident to all barbarous and to many  civilized nations; and though the successions of their kings, the  only part of their history which deserves any credit had often been  disordered by irregularities and usurpations; the true heir of the  royal family had still in the end prevailed, and Alexander III., who  had espoused the sister of Edward, probably inherited, after a period  of about eight hundred years, and through a succession of males, the  sceptre of all the Scottish princes who had governed the nation since  its first establishment in the island. This prince died in 1286, by a  fall from his horse at Kinghorn,[*] without leaving any male issue, and  without any descendant, except Margaret, born of Eric, king of Norway,  and of Margaret, daughter of the Scottish monarch. This princess,  commonly called the Maid of Norway, though a female, and an infant, and  a foreigner, yet being the lawful heir of the kingdom, had, through  her grandfather's care, been recognized successor by the states of  Scotland;[**] and on Alexander's death, the dispositions which had been  previously made against that event, appeared so just and prudent, that  no disorders, as might naturally be apprehended, ensued in the kingdom.         * Heming. vol. i. p. 29. Trivet, p. 267.         ** Rymer, vol. ii. p. 266.    Margaret was acknowledged queen of Scotland; five guardians, the bishops  of St. Andrews and Glasgow, the earls of Fife and Buchan, and James,  steward of Scotland, entered peaceably upon the administration; and the  infant princess, under the protection of Edward, her great uncle, and  Eric, her father, who exerted themselves on this occasion, seemed firmly  seated on the throne of Scotland. The English monarch was naturally led  to build mighty projects on this incident; and having lately, by force  of arms, brought Wales under subjection, he attempted, by the marriage  of Margaret with his eldest son, Edward, to unite the whole island into  one monarchy, and thereby to give it security both against domestic  convulsions and"]]]
