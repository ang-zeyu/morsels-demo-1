I would  so.\"    Jeff nudged his neighbor into laughter. \"There ain't a gamer old bird  in the valley than Pop,\" Jeff cried. \"C'm awn, Pop, I'll bet yuh ten  dollars the kid beats me!\"    Pop was shuffling hurriedly out of the corral after the liniment. To  Jeff's challenge he made no reply whatever. The group around Jeff shooed  Smoky gently toward the other side of the corral, thereby convincing  themselves of the limp in his right hind foot. While not so pronounced  as to be crippling, it certainly was no asset to a running horse, and  the wise ones conferred together in undertones.    \"That there kid's a born fool,\" Dave Truman stated positively. \"The  horse can't run. He's got the look of a speedy little animal--but  shucks! The kid don't know anything about running horses. I've been  talking to him, and I know. Jeff, you're taking the money away from him  if you run that race.\"    \"Well, I'm giving the kid a chance to back out,\" Jeff hastened to  declare. \"He can put it off till his horse gits well, if he wants to. I  ain't going to hold him to it. I never said I was.\"    \"That's mighty kind of you,\" Bud said, coming up from behind with a  bottle of liniment, and with Pop at his heels. \"But I'll run him just  the same. Smoky has favored this foot before, and it never seemed to  hurt him any. You needn't think I'm going to crawfish. You must think  I'm a whining cuss--say! I'll bet another ten dollars that I don't come  in more than a neck behind, lame horse or not!\"    \"Now, kid, don't git chancey,\" Pop admonished uneasily. \"Twenty-five is  enough money to donate to Jeff.\"    \"That's right, kid. I like your nerve,\" Jeff cut in, emphasizing his  approval with a slap on Bud's shoulder as he bent to lift Smoky's leg.  \"I've saw worse horses than this one come in ahead--it wouldn't be no  sport o' kings if nobody took a chance.\"    \"I'm taking chance enough,\" Bud retorted without looking up. \"If I don't  win this time I will the next, maybe.\"    \"That's right,\" Jeff agreed heartily, winking broadly at the others  behind Bud's back.    Bud rubbed Smoky's ankle with liniment, listened to various and sundry  self-appointed advisers and, without seeming to think how the sums would  total, took several other small bets on the race. They were small--Pop  began to teeter back and forth and lift his shoulders and pull his  beard--sure signs of perturbation.    \"By Christmas, I'll just put up ten dollars on the kid,\" Pop finally  cackled. \"I ain't got much to lose--but I'll show yuh old Pop ain't  going to see the young feller stand alone.\" He tried to catch Bud's eye,  but that young man was busy saddling Smoky and returning jibe for jibe  with the men around him, and did not glance toward Pop at all.    \"I'll take this bottle in my pocket, Pop,\" he said with his back toward  the old man, and mounted carelessly. \"I'll ride him around a little and  give him another good rubbing before we run. I'm betting,\" he added to  the others frankly, \"on the chance that exercise and the liniment will  take the soreness out of that ankle. I don't believe it amounts to  anything at all. So if any of you fellows want to bet--\"    \"Shucks! Don't go 'n-\" Pop began, and bit the sentence in two, dropping  immediately into a deep study. The kid was getting beyond Pop's  understanding.    A crowd of perhaps a hundred men and women--with a generous sprinkling  of unruly juveniles--lined the sheer bank of the creek-bed and watched  the horses run, and screamed their cheap witticisms at the losers, and  their approval of those who won. The youngster with the mysterious past  and the foolhardiness to bet on a lame horse they watched and discussed,  the women plainly wishing he would win--because he was handsome and  young, and such a wonderful musician. The men were more cold-blooded.  They could not see that Bud's good looks or the haunting melody of his  voice had any bearing whatever upon his winning a race. They called him  a fool, and either refused to bet at all on such a freak proposition as  a lame horse running against Skeeter, or bet against him. A few of the  wise ones wondered if Jeff and his bunch were merely \"stringing the kid  along \"; if they might not let him win a little, just to make him more  \"chancey.\" But they did not think it wise to bet on that probability.    While three races were being run Bud rode with the Little Lost men, and  Smoky still limped a little. Jerry Myers, still self-appointed guardian  of Bud, herded him apart and called him a fool and implored him to call  the race off and keep his money in his own pocket.    Bud was thinking just then about a certain little woman who sat on the  creek bank with a wide-brimmed straw hat shading her wonderful eyes, and  a pair of little, high-arched feet tapping heels absently against the  bank wall. Honey sat beside her, and a couple of the valley women whom  Bud had met at the dance. He had ridden close and paused for a few  friendly sentences with the quartette, careful to give Honey the  attention she plainly expected. But it was not Honey who wore the wide  hat and owned the pretty little feet. Bud pulled his thoughts back from  a fruitless wish that he might in some way help that little woman whose  trouble looked from her eyes, and whose lips smiled so bravely. He did  not think of possession when he thought of her; it was the look in her  eyes, and the slighting tones in which Honey spoke of her.    \"Say, come alive! What yuh going off in a trance for, when I'm talking  to yuh for your own good?\" Jerry smiled whimsically, but his eyes were  worried.    Bud pulled himself together and reined closer.    \"Don't bet anything on this race, Jerry,\" he advised \"Or if you do,  don't bet on Skeeter. But--well, I'll just trade you a little advice for  all you've given me. Don't bet!\"    \"What the hell!\" surprise jolted out of Jerry.    \"It's my funeral,\" Bud laughed. \"I'm a chancey kid, you see--but I'd  hate to see you bet on me.\" He pulled up to watch the next race--four  nervy little cow-horses of true range breeding, going down to the  quarter post.    \"They 're going to make false starts aplenty,\" Bud remarked after the  first fluke. \"Jeff and I have it out next. I'll just give Smoke another  treatment.\" He dismounted, looked at Jerry undecidedly and slapped him  on the knee. \"I'm glad to have a friend like you,\" he said impulsively.  \"There's a lot of two-faced sinners around here that would steal a man  blind. Don't think I'm altogether a fool.\"    Jerry looked at him queerly, opened his mouth and shut it again so  tightly that his jawbones stood out a little. He watched Bud bathing  Smoky's ankle. When Bud was through and handed Jerry the bottle to keep  for him, Jerry held him for an instant by the hand.    \"Say, for Gawdsake don't talk like that promiscuous, Bud,\" he begged.  \"You might hit too close--\"    \"Ay, Jerry! Ever hear that old Armenian proverb, 'He who tells the truth  should have one foot in the stirrup'? I learned that in school.\"    Jerry let go Bud's hand and took the bottle, Bud's watch that had his  mother's picture pasted in the back, and his vest, a pocket of which  contained a memorandum of his wagers. Bud was stepping out of his chaps,  and he looked up and grinned. \"Cheer up, Jerry. You're going to laugh in  a minute.\" When Jerry still remained thoughtful, Bud added soberly, \"I  appreciate you and old Pop standing by me. I don't know just what you've  got on your mind, but the fact that there's something is hint enough for  me.\" Whereupon Jerry's eyes lightened a little.    The four horses came thundering down the track, throwing tiny pebbles  high into the air as they passed. A trim little sorrel won, and there  was the usual confusion of voices upraised in an effort to be heard.  When that had subsided, interest once more centered on Skeeter and  Smoky, who seemed to have recovered somewhat from his lameness.    Not a man save Pop and Bud had placed a bet on Smoky, yet every man  there seemed keenly interested in the race. They joshed Bud, who grinned  and took it good-naturedly, and found another five dollars in--his  pocket to bet--this time with Pop, who kept eyeing him sharply--and it  seemed to Bud warningly. But Bud wanted to play his own game, this time,  and he avoided Pop's eyes.    The two men rode down the hoof-scored sand to the quarter post,  Skeeter dancing sidewise at the prospect of a race, Smoky now and then  tentatively against Bud's steady pressure of the bit.    \"He's not limping now,\" Bud gloated as they rode. But Jeff only laughed  tolerantly and made no reply.    Dave Truman started them with a pistol shot, and the two horses darted  away, Smoky half a jump in the lead. His limp was forgotten, and for  half the distance he ran neck and neck with Skeeter. Then he dropped to  Skeeter's middle, to his flank--then ran with his black nose even  with Skeeter's rump. Even so it was a closer race than the crowd had  expected, and all the cowboys began to yell themselves purple.    But when they were yet a few leaps from the wire clothes-line stretched  high, from post to post, Bud leaned forward until he lay flat alongside  Smoky's neck, and gave a real Indian war-whoop. Smoky lifted and  lengthened his stride, came up again to Skeeter's middle, to his  shoulder, to his ears--and with the next leap thrust his nose past  Skeeter's as they finished.    Well, then there was the usual noise, everyone trying to shout louder  than his fellows. Bud rode to where Pop was sitting apart on a pacing  gray horse that he always rode, and paused to say guardedly,    \"I pulled him, Pop. But at that I won, so if I can pry another race  out of this bunch to-day, you can bet all you like. And you owe me five  dollars,\" he added thriftily.    \"Sho! Shucks almighty!\" spluttered Pop, reaching reluctantly into his  pocket for the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17249"],[0,"Added Upon (#20)"],[1,"men,  women, beasts of the field, fowls of the air, and vegetation in  boundless and varied forms. These exist before the natural is added upon  them; they exist after the natural is laid down by the death of the  body.    In like manner we find in the spirit world men, women, beasts of the  field, fowls of the air, and vegetation in boundless and varied forms.  These things are as natural there as they are in earth-life. They  appeal to spirit nature the same as the \"natural\" prototype appeals to  the mortal senses; and this is why we may speak of our earth-known  friends who are in the spirit world and of their surroundings in the  manner of mortality.    And what a big world it is! Here are nations, tribes, races, and  families much larger than in earth-life, and just as varied in all that  made them different in mortality. Here, as in all of God's creations,  like assemble, dislike keep apart; \"for intelligence cleaveth unto  intelligence; wisdom receiveth wisdom; truth embraceth truth; virtue  loveth virtue; light cleaveth unto light; mercy hath compassion on  mercy, and claimeth her own.\" The righteous in Paradise have no desire  to mingle with the wicked in the regions of darkness; therefore they go  there only as they may be called to perform some duty.    To the industrious there can be no true pleasure or rest in idleness;  therefore, Paradise furnishes employment to all its inhabitants. A world  of knowledge is open to them into which they may extend their  researches. Thus they may continue in the ever-widening field of  learning, finding enough to occupy their time and talents.    An arrival in the spirit world brings with him just what he is when he  leaves mortality. The separation of the spiritual part of the soul from  the earthly body does not essentially change that spirit. A person takes  with him the sum total of the character he has formed up to that time.  Mortal death does not make a person better or worse; it simply adds to  him one more experience which, no doubt, has a teachable influence on  him. At death, no person is perfect, even though he is a Saint, and  passes into the Paradise of God. There he must continue the process of  eliminating the weaknesses which he did not wholly overcome in  earth-life. Death will not destroy the tendency to tell untruths, or  change the ungovernable temper to one which is under perfect control.  Such transformations are not of instant attainment, but are the result  of long, patient endeavor.    As there are gradations of righteousness and intelligences in the spirit  world, there must be a vast field of usefulness for preaching the  gospel, training the ignorant, and helping the weak. As in the world of  mortality, this work is carried on by those who have accepted the gospel  and who have conformed their lives to its principles; so in the spirit  world, the righteous find pleasant and profitable employment in working  for the salvation of souls.    And as they work they must needs talk of the glories of the great plan  of salvation, made perfect through the atonement of the Lord Jesus. That  which they look forward to most keenly, that about which they talk and  sing most fervently is the time when they also shall follow their Savior  through the door of the resurrection which He has opened for them,--when  their souls shall be perfectly redeemed, and they shall be clothed upon  with a body of the heavenly order, a tabernacle incorruptible and  immortal with which to go on into the celestial world.    Though the future is most glorious to these people, the past is also  bright. The hopes of the future are well grounded on the facts of the  past. An ever-present theme is that of Christ's first visit to the  spirit world, when, having died on the cross, He brought life and light  and immortality to the world of spirits, entering even into the prison  house where the disobedient had lain for a long time, and preached the  gospel to them.    And among these who gloried both in the past and in the future were  Rupert and Henrik. Often they conversed on themes near to their hearts:    \"It must have been a place of darkness, of sad despairing hearts, that  prison house, before Christ's visit to it,\" said Rupert. \"There, as in a  pit, dwelt those who in earth-life had rejected the truth, and who,  sinking low in the vices of the world, permitted themselves to be led  captive by the power of the evil one. Noah in his day preached to them,  but they laughed him to scorn and continued in their evil ways. Others  of the prophets in their generations had warned them, but without avail;  so here were found Satan's harvest from the fruitful fields of the  earth.\"    \"I can well imagine that long, long, night of darkness,\" added Henrik.  \"No ray of hope pierced the gloom of their abode. The prison walls  loomed around and above them, shutting out any glimpse of heaven. These  had rejected the truth, which alone can make men free. They themselves  had shut out the light when it would have shone in upon their vision.  They had chosen the evil, and the evil was claiming its own. Outside the  prison were their fellows who had chosen to do the right, basking in the  light of a clear conscience, enjoying the approval of the Lord. These  faithful ones were going on to eternal perfection. How long would it  take the prisoners, if they ever were released, to overtake those ahead?  Between these was a great gulf fixed, which, in the ordinary order of  things, could never be lessened or bridged.\"    \"But at last the time of mercy and deliverance came. I remember how the  events of the time have been described to me. Just before the coming of  the Lord, a peculiar, indescribable tremor ran through this spirit world  as if one pulse beat through the universe and that pulse had been  disturbed. The spirits in prison looked in awe at one another, many  crouching in terror, fearful that the day of judgment had come. The vast  multitude of the ignorant wondered what the 'peculiar feeling' could  mean. The righteous, who had been looking wistfully for some  manifestation of the coming of the Lord, whispered to each other, 'The  Lord is dying for the sins of the world!'    \"Yes; the prophets of every dispensation had labored faithfully to  prepare the world of spirits among whom they lived for the coming of the  Lord and Savior. There were Adam, Noah, Abraham, with those who followed  them; there were Lehi, Nephi, Mosiah, and the others of their race;  there were the prophets who had lived among the lost Ten tribes; these  had all been valiant in earth-life, and were faithful yet in the spirit  world. The burden of their message in mortality had been the coming of  Christ the Redeemer, and now they still looked forward with the eye of  faith to Him who should die for the sins of the world, and who should  deliver them from the bondage of the grave. They understood that the  body of flesh which had been given them in mortality was necessary for  their full salvation. Christ would bring to pass the resurrection, so  that bodies would be restored to them, not corruptible as before, but  perfected, immortal and glorious, a fit tabernacle for the immortal  spirit with which to go on into the eternal mansions of the Father.\"    \"But oh, that time, brother, when the Son of God was dying on the cross!  While the earth was shrouded in darkness, and the bulk of it trembled in  sympathy with the death throes of its Maker, the spirit world also  received the imprint of the terrible event on Calvary as for a moment  the whole spiritual creation lay in tense expectancy. The usual  occupations were suspended. Speech became low and constrained. Songs  ended abruptly, and laughter ceased. There were no audible sobs, neither  sighing. Bird and beast were stilled, as if the end had come, and  nothing more mattered. Then, in a little while, the tenseness relaxed,  and everything went on as before, though much subdued. The righteous in  the Paradise of God quietly gathered themselves together in their usual  places of worship. They clasped each other's hands, and looked with  trembling gladness into each other's faces. There was no fear here: they  were ready.\"    \"And then His actual coming! That which had been fore-ordained from  before the foundation of the world was about to be fulfilled; that which  had been the theme of the prophets from the beginning was at the door;  that which the seers of all times and nations had beheld in vision was  now to be realized; that about which poets had sung; that for which  every pure heart had yearned; that for which the ages had waited, was  now here! A feeling of sweet peace filled the righteous, which expressed  itself in songs of praise and gladness. Thus they watched and waited.\"    \"Then Jesus stood in their midst, and they beheld the glorious presence  of their Lord. Then there came to their hearts a small, sweet,  penetrating voice, testifying that this was Jesus Christ the Son of God  who had glorified the name of the Father; who was the life and the light  of the world; who had drunk of the bitter cup which the Father had given  him; and had glorified the Father in taking upon Himself the sins of the  world, in which He had suffered the will of the Father in all things  from the beginning. The multitude fell down at his feet and worshiped.\"    \"I have been told that as Jesus entered the prison of the condemned in  the spirit world, a murmur of greeting welcomed Him. It was timid and  faint at first, but it increased in volume and force until it became a  shout.    \"'Lift up your heads, O ye gates, and be ye lifted up, ye everlasting  doors.'\"    \"'Hail, hail, to the Lord.'\"    \"'And the King of Glory shall come in.'\"    \"'Who is the King of Glory?'\"    \"'The Lord, strong and mighty.'\"    \"'The Lord, will not cast off forever; but though He cause grief, yet  will He have compassion, according to the multitude of His mercies.'\"    \"'I will"]]]
