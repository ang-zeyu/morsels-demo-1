Thou didst like him, who goes by night, and carries the light  behind him, and helps not himself, but makes the persons  following him wise, when thou saidst, 'The ages are renewed;  Justice returns, and the primeval time of man, and a new progeny  descends from heaven.'[10] Through thee I became a poet, through  thee a Christian. But in order that thou mayst better see that  which I sketch, I will stretch out my hand to color it. Already  was the whole world teeming with the true belief, sown by the  messengers of the eternal realm; and these words of thine touched  upon just now were in harmony with the new preachers, wherefore I  adopted the practice of visiting them. They came to me then  appearing so holy, that, when Domitian persecuted them, not  without my tears were their lamentings. And so long as I  remained on earth I succored them; and their upright customs  made me scorn all other sects. And before I had led the Greeks to  the rivers of Thebes in my verse, I received baptism; but out of  fear I was a secret Christian, for a long while making show of  paganism: and this lukewarmness made me circle round the fourth  circle,[11] longer than to the fourth century. Thou, therefore,  that didst lift for me the covering that was hiding from me such  great good as I say, while we have remainder of ascent, tell me  where is our ancient Terence, Caecilius, Plautus, and Varro, if  thou knowest it; tell me if they are damned, and in what region?\"  \"They, and Persius, and I, and many others,\" replied my Leader,  \"are with that Greek whom the Muses suckled more than any other  ever, in the first girdle of the blind prison. Oftentimes we  discourse of the mountain[12] that hath our nurses[13] always  with itself. Euripides is there with us, and Antiphon, Simonides,  Agathon, and many other Greeks who of old adorned their brows  with laurel. There of thine own people[14] are seen Antigone,  Deiphile, and Argia, and Ismene sad[15] even as she was. There  she is seen who showed Langia;[16] there is the daughter of  Tiresias and Thetis,[17] and Deidamia with her sisters.\"    [1] Quid non mortalia peetora yogis,      Auri sacra fames?

[16] Hypsipyle, who showed the fountain Langia to Adrastus, and  the other kings, when their army was perishing with thirst.    [17] Manto is the only daughter of Tiresias, who is mentioned by  Statius; but Manto is in the eighth circle in Hell. See Canto XX.      Now both the poets became silent, once more intent on looking  around, free from the ascent and from the walls; and four of the  handmaids of the day were now remaining behind,[1] and the fifth  was at the pole,[2] directing still upward its burning horn, when  my Leader, \"I think that it behoves us to turn our right  shoulders to the outer edge, circling the Mount as we are wont to  do.\" Thus usage was there our guide, and we took the way with  less doubt because of the assent of that worthy soul.    [1] The first four hours of the day were spent. It was between  ten and eleven o'clock.    [2] Of the car.      They were going on in front, and I solitary behind, and I was  listening to their speech which gave me understanding in poesy.  But soon the pleasant discourse was interrupted by a tree which  we found in the mid road, with apples sweet and pleasant to the  smell. And as a fir-tree tapers upward from branch to branch, so  downwardly did that, I think in order that no one may go up. On  the side on which our way was closed, a clear water fell from  the high rock and spread itself over the heaves above. The two  poets approached the tree, and a voice from within the heaves  cried: \"Of this food ye shall have want.\" Then it said, \"Mary  thought more, how the wedding[1] should be honorable and  complete, than of her mouth,[2] which answers now for you; and  the ancient Roman women were content with water for their drink;  and Daniel despised food and gained wisdom. The primal age, which  was beautiful as gold, with hunger made acorns savory, and with  thirst every streamlet nectar. Honey and locusts were the viands  that nourished the Baptist in the desert, wherefore he is in  glory, and so great as by the Gospel is revealed to you.    [1] At Cana.    [2] Than of gratifying her appetite.        CANTO XXIII. Sixth Ledge: the Gluttonous.--Forese  Donati.--Nella.--Rebuke of the women of Florence.    While I was fixing my eyes upon the green leafage, just as he who  wastes his life following the little bird is wont to do, my more  than Father said to me, \"Son, come on now, for the time that is  assigned to us must be parcelled out more usefully.\" I turned my  face, and no less quickly my step after the Sages, who were  speaking so that they made the going of no cost to me; and ho! a  lament and song were heard, \"Labia mea, Domine,\"[1] in such  fashion that it gave birth to delight and pain. \"O sweet Father,  what is that which I hear?\" I began, and he, \"Shades which go,  perhaps loosing the knot of their debt.\"    [1] \"Lord, open thou my lips.\" -- Psalm li. 15.      Even as do pilgrims rapt in thought, who, overtaking on the road  unknown folk, turn themselves to them, and stay not; so behind  us, moving more quickly, coming up and passing by, a crowd of  souls, silent and devout, gazed at us. Each was dark and hollow  in the eyes, pallid in the face, and so wasted that the skin took  its shape from the bones. I do not think that Erisichthon[1] was  so dried up to utter rind by hunger, when he had most fear of it.  I said to myself in thought, \"Behold the people who lost  Jerusalem, when Mary struck her beak into her son.\"[2] The  sockets of their eyes seemed rings without gems. Whoso in the  face of men reads OMO,[3] would surely there have recognized the  M. Who would believe that the scent of an apple, begetting  longing, and that of a water, could have such mastery, if he  knew not how?    [1] Punished for sacrilege by Ceres with insatiable hunger, so  that at last he turned his teeth upon himself. See Ovid,  Metam.,viii. 738 sqq.    [2] The story of this wretched woman is told by Josephus in  his narrative of the siege of Jerusalem by Titus: De Bello Jud.,  vi. 3.    [3] Finding in each eye an O, and an M in the lines of the brows  and nose, making the word for \"man.\"      I was now wondering what so famished them, the cause of their  meagreness and of their wretched husk not yet being manifest,  and lo! from the depths of its head, a shade turned his eyes on  me, and looked fixedly, then cried out loudly, \"What grace to me  is this!\" Never should I have recognized him by his face; but in  his voice that was disclosed to me which his aspect in itself had  suppressed.[1] This spark rekindled in me all my knowledge of the  altered visage, and I recognized the face of Forese.[2]    [1] His voice revealed who he was, which his actual aspect  concealed.    [2] Brother of the famous Corso Donati, and related to Dante,  whose wife was Gemma de' Donati.      \"Ah, strive not [1] with the dry scab that discolors my skin,\" he  prayed, \"nor with my lack of flesh, but tell me the truth about  thyself; and who are these two souls, who yonder make an escort  for thee: stay not thou from speaking to me.\" \"Thy face, which  once I wept for dead, now gives me for weeping no less a grief,\"  replied I, \"seeing it so disfigured; therefore, tell me, for  God's sake, what so despoils you; make me not speak while I am  marvelling; for ill can he speak who is full of another wish.\"  And he to me, \"From the eternal council falls a power into the  water and into the plant, now left behind, whereby I become so  thin. All this folk who sing weeping, because of following their  appetite beyond measure, here in hunger and in thirst make  themselves holy again. The odour which issues from the apple and  from the spray that spreads over the verdure kindles in us desire  to eat and drink. And not once only as we circle this floor is  our pain renewed; I say pain, and ought to say solace, for that  will leads us to the tree which led Christ gladly to say,  'Eli,'[2] when with his blood he delivered us.\" And I to him,  \"Forese, from that day on which thou didst change world to a  better life, up to this time five years have not rolled round. If  the power of sinning further had ended in thee, ere the hour  supervened of the good grief that to God reweds us, how hast thou  come up hither?[3] I thought to find thee still down there below,  where time is made good by time.\" And he to me, \"My Nella with  her bursting tears has brought me thus quickly to drink of the  sweet wormwood of these torments. With her devout prayers and  with sighs has she drawn me from the shore where one waits, and  has delivered me from the other circles. So much the more dear  and more beloved of God is my little widow,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1997"],[0,"The Divine Comedy, Volume 3, Paradise (#20)"],[1," to  worse. Cephas[5] came, and the great vessel of the Holy  Spirit[6] came, lean and barefoot, taking the food of whatsoever  inn. Now the modern pastors require one to hold them up on this  side and that, and one to lead them, so heavy are they, and one  to support them behind. They cover their palfreys with their  mantles, so that two beasts go under one skin. O Patience, that  endurest so much!\" At this voice I saw more flamelets from step  to step descending and revolving, and each revolution made them  more beautiful. Round about this one they came, and stopped, and  uttered a cry of such deep sound that here could be none like it,  nor did I understand it, the thunder so overcame me.    [1] Catria is a high offshoot to the east from the chain of the  Apennines, between Urbino and Gubbio. Far up on its side lies the  monastery of Santa Croce di Fouts Avellana, belonging to the  order of the Camaldulensians.    [2] A famous doctor of the Church in the eleventh century. He  was for many years abbot of the Monastery of Fonte Avellana.    [3] These last words are obscure, and have given occasion to much  discussion, after which they remain no clearer than before. The  house of Our Lady on the Adriatic shore is supposed to be the  monastery of Santa Maria in Porto, near Ravenna.    [4] He was made cardinal in 1058, and died in 1072.    [5] St. Peter. See John, i. 42.    [6] St. Paul. \"He is a chosen vessel unto me.\"--Acts, ix. 15.        CANTO XXII. Beatrice reassures Dante.--St. Benedict appears.--He  tells of the founding of his Order, and of the falling away of  its brethren. Beatrice and Dante ascend to the Starry Heaven.--  The constellation of the Twins.--Sight of the Earth.    Oppressed with amazement, I turned me to my Guide, like a little  child who runs back always thither where he most confides. And  she, like a mother who quickly succors her pale and breathless  son with her voice, which is wont to reassure him, said to me, 11  Knowest thou not, that thou art in Heaven? and knowest thou not  that Heaven is all holy, and whatever is done here comes from  good zeal? How the song would have transformed thee, and I by  smiling, thou canst now conceive, since the cry has moved thee so  much; in which, if thou hadst understood its prayers, already  would be known to thee the vengeance which thou shalt see before  thou diest. The sword of here on high cuts not in haste, nor  slow, save to the seeming of him who, desiring, or fearing,  awaits it. But turn thee round now toward the others, for many  illustrious spirits thou shalt see, if, as I say, thou dost lead  back thy look.\"    As it pleased her I directed my eyes, and saw a hundred little  spheres, which together were becoming more beautiful with mutual  rays. I was standing as one who within himself represses the  point of his desire, and attempts not to ask, he so fears the  too-much. And the largest and the most luculent of those pearls  came forward to make of its own accord my wish content. Then  within it I heard, \"If thou couldst see, as I do, the charity  which burns among us, thy thoughts would be expressed. But that  thou through waiting mayst not delay thy high end, I will make  answer to thee, even to the thought concerning which thou art so  regardful.    \"That mountain[1] on whose slope Cassino is, was of old  frequented on its summit by the deluded and illdisposed people,  and I am be who first carried up thither the name of Him  who brought to earth the truth which so high exalts us: and such  grace shone upon me that I drew away the surrounding villages  from the impious worship which seduced the world. These other  fires were all contemplative men, kindled by that heat which  brings to birth holy flowers and fruits. Here is Macarius,[2]  here is Romuald,[3] here are my brothers, who within the  cloisters fixed their feet, and held a steadfast heart.\" And I to  him, \"The affection which thou displayest in speaking with me,  and the good semblance which I see and note in all your ardors,  have so expanded my confidence as the sun does the rose, when she  becomes open so much as she has power to be. Therefore I pray  thee, and do thou, father, assure me if I have power to receive  so much grace, that I may see thee with uncovered shape.\" Whereon  he, \"Brother, thy high desire shall be fulfilled in the last  sphere, where are fulfilled all others and my own. There perfect,  mature, and whole is every desire; in that alone is every part  there where it always was: for it is not in space, and hath not  poles; and our stairway reaches up to it, wherefore thus from thy  sight it conceals itself. Far up as there the patriarch Jacob saw  it stretch its topmost part when it appeared to him so laden with  Angels. But now no one lifts his feet from earth to ascend it;  and my Rule is remaining as waste of paper. The walls, which used  to be an abbey, have become caves; and the cowls are sacks full  of bad meal. But heavy usury is not gathered in so greatly  against the pleasure of God, as that fruit which makes the heart  of monks so foolish. For whatsoever the Church guards is all for  the folk that ask it in God's name, not for one's kindred, or for  another more vile. The flesh of mortals is so soft that a good  beginning suffices not below from the springing of the oak to the  forming of the acorn. Peter began without gold and without  silver, and I with prayers and with fasting, and Francis in  humility his convent; and if thou lookest at the source of each,  and then lookest again whither it has run, thou wilt see dark  made of the white. Truly, Jordan turned back, and the sea fleeing  when God willed, were more marvellous to behold than succor  here.\"[4]    [1] Monte Cassino, in the Kingdom of Naples, on which a temple of  Apollo had stood, was chosen by St. Benedict (480-543) as his  abode, and became the site of the most famous monastery of his  Order.    [2] The Egyptian anchorite of the fourth century.    [3] The founder of the order of Camaldoli; he died in 1027.    [4] Were God now to interpose to correct the evils of the  Church, the marvel would be less than that of the miracles of  old, and therefore his interposition may be hoped for.      Thus he said to me, and then drew back to his company, and the  company closed up; then like a whirlwind all gathered itself  upward.    The sweet Lady urged me behind them, with only a sign, up over  that stairway; so did her virtue overcome my nature. But never  here below, where one mounts and descends naturally, was there  motion so rapid that it could be compared unto my wing. So may I  return, Reader, to that devout triumph, for the sake of which I  often bewail my sins and beat my breast, thou hadst not so  quickly drawn out and put thy finger in the fire as I saw the  sign which follows the Bull,[1] and was within it.    [1] The sign of the Gemini, or Twins, in the Heaven of the Fixed  Stars.      O glorious stars, O light impregnate with great virtue, from  which I acknowledge all my genius, whatever it may be; with you  was born and with you was hiding himself he who is father of  every mortal life, when I first felt the Tuscan air;[1] and then,  when the grace was bestowed on me of entrance within the lofty  wheel which turns you, your region was allotted to me. To you my  soul now devoutly sighs to acquire virtue for the difficult pass  which draws her to itself.    [1] At the time of Dante's birth the sun was in the sign of the  Twins.      \"Thou art so near the ultimate salvation,\" began Beatrice, \"that  thou oughtest to have thine eyes clear and sharp. And  therefore ere thou further enterest it, look back downward, and  see how great a world I have already set beneath thy feet, in  order that thy heart, so far as it is able, may present itself  joyous to the triumphant crowd which comes glad through this  round aether.\" With my sight I returned through each and all the  seven spheres, and saw this globe such that I smiled at its mean  semblance; and that counsel I approve as best which holds it of  least account; and he who thinks of other things may be called  truly worthy. I saw the daughter of Latona enkindled without that  shadow which had been the cause why I once believed her rare and  dense. The aspect of thy son, Hyperion, here I endured, and I saw  how Maia and Dione[1] move around and near him. Then appeared to  me the temperateness of Jove, between his father and his son,[2]  and then was clear to me the variation which they make in their  places. And all the seven were displayed to me,[[how great they  are and how swift they are, and how they are in distant houses.  While I was revolving with the eternal Twins, the little  threshing-floor[3] which makes us so fierce all appeared to me,  from its hills to its harbors.    [1] The mothers of Venus and Mercury, by whose names these  planets are designated.    [2] Saturn and Mars.    [3] The inhabited earth.      Then I turned back my eyes to the beautiful eyes.        CANTO XXIII. The Triumph of Christ.    As the bird, among the beloved leaves, reposing on the nest of  her sweet brood through the night which hides things from us,  who, in order to see their longed-for looks and to find the food  wherewith she may feed them, in which heavy toils are pleasing to  her, anticipates the time upon the open twig, and with ardent  affection awaits the sun, fixedly looking till the dawn may  break; thus my Lady was standing erect and attentive, turned  toward the region beneath which the sun shows least haste;[1] so  that I, seeing her rapt and eager, became such as he who in  desire should wish for something, and in hope is satisfied. But  short while was there between one and the other WHEN: that of my  awaiting, I mean, and of my seeing the heavens become brighter  and brighter. And Beatrice said, \"Behold the hosts of the triumph  of Christ, and all the fruit harvested by the revolution of these  spheres.\"[2] It seemed"]]]
