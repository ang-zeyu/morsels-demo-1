There were nine on the log at last. The calling grew louder and louder;  yet for several minutes now no answer came back. The flock grew uneasy;  the leader ran from his log into the brush and back again, calling  loudly, while a low chatter, the first break in their strange silence,  ran back and forth through the family on the log. There were others to  come; but where were they, and why did they tarry? It was growing late;  already an owl had hooted, and the roosting place was still far away.  _Prut, prut, pr-r-r-reee!_ called the leader, and the chatter ceased as  the whole flock listened.    I turned my head to the hillside to listen also for the laggards; but  there was no answer. Save for the cry of a low-flying loon and the snap  of a twig--too sharp and heavy for little feet to make--the woods were  all silent. As I turned to the log again, something warm and heavy  rested against my side. Then I knew; and with the knowledge came a swift  thrill of regret that made me feel guilty and out of place in the  silent woods. The leader was calling, the silent flock were waiting for  two of their number who would never answer the call again.    I lay scarcely ten yards from the log on which the sad little drama went  on in the twilight shadows, while the great silence grew deep and  deeper, as if the wilderness itself were in sympathy and ceased its  cries to listen. Once, at the first glimpse of the group, I had raised  my rifle and covered the head of the largest bird; but curiosity to know  what they were doing held me back. Now a deeper feeling had taken its  place; the rifle slid from my hand and lay unnoticed among the fallen  leaves.    Again the leader called. The flock drew itself up, like a row of  gray-brown statues, every eye bright, every ear listening, till some  vague sense of fear and danger drew them together; and they huddled on  the ground in a close group; all but the leader, who stood above them,  counting them over and over, apparently, and anon sending his cry out  into the darkening woods.    I took one of the birds out of my pocket and began to smooth the rumpled  brown feathers. How beautiful he was, how perfectly adapted in form and  color for the wilderness in which he had lived! And I had taken his  life, the only thing he had. Its beauty and something deeper, which is  the sad mystery of all life, were gone forever. All summer long he had  run about on glad little feet, delighting in nature's abundance, calling  brightly to his fellows as they glided in and out in eager search  through the lights and shadows. Fear on the one hand, absolute obedience  to his mother on the other, had been the two great factors of his life.  Between them he grew strong, keen, alert, knowing perfectly when to run  and when to fly and when to crouch motionless, as danger passed close  with blinded eyes. Then when his strength was perfect, and he glided  alone through the wilderness coverts in watchful self-dependence--a  moment's curiosity, a quick eager glance at the strange animal standing  so still under the cedar, a flash, a noise; and all was over. The call  of the leader went searching, searching through the woods; but he gave  no heed any more.    The hand had grown suddenly very tender as it stroked his feathers. I  had taken his life; I must try to answer for him now. At the thought I  raised my head and gave the clear _whit-kwit_ of a running partridge.  Instantly the leader answered; the flock sprang to the log again and  turned their heads in my direction to listen. Another call, and now the  flock dropped to the ground and lay close, while the leader drew himself  up straight on the log and became part of a dead stub beside him.    Something was wrong in my call; the birds were suspicious, knowing not  what danger had kept their fellows silent so long, and now threatened  them out of the black alders. A moment's intent listening; then the  leader stepped slowly down from his log and came towards me cautiously,  halting, hiding, listening, gliding, swinging far out to one side and  back again in stealthy advance, till he drew himself up abruptly at  sight of my face peering out of the underbrush. For a long two minutes  he never stirred so much as an eyelid. Then he glided swiftly back, with  a faint, puzzled, questioning _kwit-kwit?_ to where his flock were  waiting. A low signal that I could barely hear, a swift movement--then  the flock thundered away in scattered flight into the silent, friendly  woods.    Ten minutes later I was crouched in some thick underbrush looking up  into a great spruce, when I could just make out the leader standing by  an upright branch in sharp silhouette against the glowing west. I had  followed his swift flight, and now lay listening again to his searching  call as it went out through the twilight, calling his little flock to  the roosting tree. From the swamp and the hillside and far down by the  quiet lake they answered, faintly at first, then with clearer call and  the whirr of swift wings as they came in.    But already I had seen and heard enough; too much, indeed, for my peace  of mind. I crept away through the swamp, the eager calls following me  even to my canoe; first a plaint, as if something were lacking to the  placid lake and quiet woods and the soft beauty of twilight; and then a  faint question, always heard in the _kwit_ of a partridge, as if only I  could explain why two eager voices would never again answer to roll call  when the shadows lengthened.    [Illustration]          Umquenawis The Mighty    [Illustration]      Umquenawis the Mighty is lord of the woodlands. None other among the  wood folk is half so great as he; none has senses so keen to detect a  danger, nor powers so terrible to defend himself against it. So he fears  nothing, moving through the big woods like a master; and when you see  him for the first time in the wilderness pushing his stately, silent way  among the giant trees, or plunging like a great engine through  underbrush and over windfalls, his nose up to try the wind, his broad  antlers far back on his mighty shoulders, while the dead tree that  opposes him cracks and crashes down before his rush, and the alders  beat a rattling, snapping tattoo on his branching horns,--when you see  him thus, something within you rises up, like a soldier at salute, and  says: \"Milord the Moose!\" And though the rifle is in your hand, its  deadly muzzle never rises from the trail.    [Illustration: \"PLUNGING LIKE A GREAT ENGINE THROUGH UNDERBRUSH AND OVER  WINDFALLS\"]    That great head with its massive crown is too big for any house. Hung  stupidly on a wall, in a room full of bric-a-brac, as you usually see  it, with its shriveled ears that were once living trumpets, its bulging  eyes that were once so small and keen, and its huge muzzle stretched out  of all proportion, it is but misplaced, misshapen ugliness. It has no  more, and scarcely any higher, significance than a scalp on the pole of  a savage's wigwam. Only in the wilderness, with the irresistible push of  his twelve-hundred pound, force-packed body behind it, the crackling  underbrush beneath, and the lofty spruce aisles towering overhead, can  it give the tingling impression of magnificent power which belongs to  Umquenawis the Mighty in his native wilds. There only is his head at  home; and only as you see it there, whether looking out in quiet majesty  from a lonely point over a silent lake, or leading him in his terrific  rush through the startled forest, will your heart ever jump and your  nerves tingle in that swift thrill which stirs the sluggish blood to  your very finger tips, and sends you quietly back to camp with your  soul at peace--well satisfied to leave Umquenawis where he is, rather  than pack him home to your admiring friends in a freight car.    Though Umquenawis be lord of the wilderness, there are two things, and  two things only, which he sometimes fears: the smell of man, and the  spiteful crack of a rifle. For Milord the Moose has been hunted and has  learned fear, which formerly he was stranger to. But when you go deep  into the wilderness, where no hunter has ever gone, and where the bang  of a rifle following the roar of a birch-bark trumpet has never broken  the twilight stillness, there you may find him still, as he was before  fear came; there he will come smashing down the mountain side at your  call, and never circle to wind an enemy; and there, when the mood is on  him, he will send you scrambling up the nearest tree for your life, as a  squirrel goes when the fox is after him. Once, in such a mood, I saw him  charge a little wiry guide, who went up a spruce tree with his snowshoes  on; and never a bear did the trick quicker, spite of the four-foot webs  in which his feet were tangled.    We were pushing upstream, late one afternoon, to the big lake at the  headwaters of a wilderness river. Above the roar of rapids far behind,  and the fret of the current near at hand, the rhythmical _clunk_,  _clunk_ of the poles and the _lap_, _lap_ of my little canoe as she  breasted the ripples were the only sounds that broke the forest  stillness. We were silent, as men always are to whom the woods have  spoken their deepest message, and to whom the next turn of the river may  bring its thrill of unexpected things.    Suddenly, as the bow of our canoe shot round a point, we ran plump upon  a big cow moose crossing the river. At Simmo's grunt of surprise she  stopped short and whirled to face us. And there she stood, one huge  question mark from nose to tail, while the canoe edged in to the lee of  a great rock and hung there quivering, with poles braced firmly on the  bottom.    We were already late for camping, and the lake was still far ahead. I  gave the word at last, after a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22107"],[0,"Wood-Carving: Design and Workmanship (#20)"],[1," cut away, and which is afterward  glued or \"planted\" on a fresh background to save labor, can not be  called \"undercut\"; this method has generally a cheap look, as it is used  with the object of saving time and expense. Carving which is treated in  this way, but instead of being \"planted\" close to the background, is  fixed at a little distance from it (as is the case with the lace-like  designs fitted into the hollow moldings of fifteenth-century  choir-screens), is of quite a different order, although even in this  case it can not be strictly described as undercut: it is more nearly  akin to pierced fretwork. It has, however, all the general effect of  undercut work, and is the only possible way of obtaining this effect in  wood where a large quantity of such ornament is required. The face of  such carving is generally a little convex, while the back is hollowed  out to give an equal thickness of section. The ornaments in Figs. 75,  76, and 77 are of this description, and are calculated to give great  play of light and shade, and be seen well at a considerable distance.    Undercutting in the strict and more laborious sense must be reserved for  occasions where the labor is repaid by the additional charm. It must be  considered in the light of a _tour de force_, which, on account of its  cost in the matter of time, should only be used under exceptional  circumstances, care being taken to make it clear that it is _an  exception_ to the general rule of solid carving on a solid background.          CHAPTER XXIII    PICTURE SUBJECTS AND PERSPECTIVE           The Limitations of an Art not Safely Transgressed--Aerial       Perspective Impossible in Relief--Linear Perspective only Possible       in a Limited Way.      Those vague and shadowy boundaries which separate the domains of the  different arts are being perpetually called in question. By what  landmarks such indefinite frontiers may be distinguished, and how far  they may be extended or transgressed, will always be a matter of  dispute. Excursions of conquest are continually being made, and  conspicuous among these, one which animates the hopes of many sculptors  and modelers. Its aim is the appropriation of those charms which are the  peculiar property of the graphic arts, more especially their power of  expressing the effects of distance by means of linear and aerial  perspective.    The background of a piece of carving is so obviously solid and  impenetrable that any attempt to imitate an appearance of distance is  sure to defeat its own ends, the loss being greater than the gain. If  there are limits to be observed in the foreshortening of a single leaf,  how much more must they apply to the representation of whole landscapes?  Properly speaking, there is no _distance_ available in the carver's art;  its whole interest lies near the surface, and in the direct rays of the  light which illuminates it. There is even a distinct pleasure to be  derived from the sense that it is all carved out of a block of such and  such thickness, pointing to the reasonable conclusion that this  thickness should never be lost sight of, the carving ever and anon  returning to the surface as a measure of music does to its key-note.  This is exemplified in all the great works of antiquity, among which the  Parthenon frieze may be quoted as evidence. On the other hand, all  pictorial sculpture, such as carved landscapes with figures diminishing  both in scale and projection, necessarily fail to uphold this sense of  solidity, as there must occur large spaces which are hollowed out far  below the surface to give another plane on which to carve the more  distant objects in low relief, in the vain hope of making them appear to  recede. Work in which perspective of this kind is used must be viewed  as nearly as possible from the point of vision produced by its  vanishing-lines; this point is intelligible enough in the case of a  painting, but when it comes to be carved into relief, if it happens to  be seen from any other point of view, it necessarily looks all wrong,  because every part is thrown into false relationship.    All this, of course, forms no argument against the use of explanatory  landscapes with trees, buildings, etc. It only means that all such  features must be treated in a way entirely different to that adopted by  the painter--that is to say, in detached groups, each having some due  relation to the original surface of the wood, and only very little to  their perspective positions. In Fig. 74 are two diagrams of a landscape  composition. The one is appropriate to a painted picture and the other  to carving; both have pretty nearly the same number of features, except  that in the carving there is no _effect_ of distance attempted, whereas  in the painting everything leads to this one particular distinction. The  road goes _into_ the picture, the bridge is seen end on, the house and  mill are diminished in size, and the horizon is strongly enforced by a  shadow echoed in the sky. The carving looks ridiculous beside the  painting, but it is a severe test, as it is not a subject which should  be carved at all in that condensed way.    [Illustration: FIG. 74.]          CHAPTER XXIV    ARCHITECTURAL CARVING           The Necessity for Variety in Study--A Carver's View of the Study of       Architecture; Inseparable from a Study of his own Craft--Importance       of the Carpenter's Stimulating Influence upon the       Carver--Carpenter's Imitation of Stone Construction Carried too       Far.      That the study of wood-carving should be confined to the narrow field of  its own performances would be the surest way to bring contempt upon an  art which already offers too many temptations for the easy embodiment of  puerile motives. Such a limited range would exclude all the stimulating  lessons to be derived from the many other kinds of carving and  sculpture; forgetful that they are, after all, but different forms of  the same art, differing only in technique and application. It would take  no note of the stately sculptures of Greece--the fountain-head of all  that is technically and artistically perfect in expression of form--or  of the splendor of imagination displayed in the ivories of Italy. Many  another source of inspiring impetus would be neglected, including the  greatest of all, the influence of architecture, and through it, the  dignified association or the carver's art with all that is noble in the  life of mankind.    The dry and uninviting aspect which a serious study of architecture  presents to some minds is such that it is too often avoided as both  useless and wearisome. Much of this diffidence is due to a misconception  of the aims which should govern the student of decorative design in  making an acquaintance with its principles. The study should not be  looked upon as pertaining exclusively to the functions of an architect,  nor as having only an accidental connection with particular crafts. It  must be remembered that in the old days mason and carpenter were both  craftsmen and architects, and the sculptor and wood-carver had an equal  share in creating every feature which gives any distinction of style to  the buildings that were the outcome of their united efforts. So,  instead of looking upon the subject as only a study of dates for the  antiquary, and rules of construction for the architect, the carver  should take his own view, and regard architecture for the time being as  what in some sense it really is: a very large kind of carving, which  includes and gives reason for his own particular branch. The importance  of the subject is proved by the experience of centuries; history showing  plainly how the two arts grew in strength and beauty only when closely  associated, and shared each other's fate in proportion to their  estrangement.    In this place I can say but very little upon such a vast subject; all I  can do is to call your attention to one or two examples of carved work  combined with structural carpentry, in order that you may see for  yourselves what a power of effect lies in that union, and how by  contrast it enhances the value and interest of both. I do this in the  hope that it may possibly lead you to a more complete study of  architecture, for which there is no lack of opportunity in books and  museums, but more especially in what remains of the old buildings  themselves, with which a familiar and personal acquaintance will be  much better than a theoretical or second-hand one.    No carver with a healthy ambition can long continue to make designs and  produce them in wood without feeling intensely the want of some  architectural occasion for his efforts. Had he only a barge-board to  carve, or the canopy of a porch, it would be such a relief to turn to  its large and general treatment after a course of the panels and  ornaments peculiar to domestic furniture. Look, for instance, at the  carved beams of the aisle roof in Mildenhall Church given in Plate III,  and think what a fund of powerful suggestion lay in the bare timbers  before they were embellished by the carver with lion, dragon, and  knight. Even the carpenter became inspired with a desire to make  something ornamental of his own department, and has shaped and carved  (literally carved) his timbers into graceful moldings. Then, again, in  the roof of Sall Church, Norfolk, shown in Plate IV, you have a noble  piece of carpentry which is as much the work of an artist as the carved  figures and tracery which adorn it--indeed it is all just as truly  carved work as those figures, being chopped out of the solid oak with  larger tools, ax and adze, so that one knows not which to admire most,  carved angels or carved carpentry.    Plates XI and XII are details of the carvings which fill the spandrels  of arch and gable in the choir stalls and screen at Winchester  Cathedral. There are a great many of these panels similar in character  but differing in design, some"]]]
