He could not have defined offhand what it was that he  understood. But it had, it seemed, something to do with Letty's account  book and Bruce's baby....    Gradually he let himself face what it was that he was wanting to do. And  when he faced that, he left the hobbyhorse where it was under the wall  and went into the street.    He took his place among the externals of the Winter night, himself  unconscious of them. The night, with all its content, a thing of  explicable fellowships, lay waiting patiently for those of its children  who knew its face. In the dark and under the snow the very elements of  earth and life were obscured, as in some clear wash correcting too  strong values. He moved along the village, and now his dominant  consciousness was the same consciousness in which that little village  lived. But he knew it only as the impulse that urged him on toward  Jenny's house. If he went to Jenny's, if he signified so that he wished  not to be cut off from her and Bruce and the baby, if he asked Bruce to  come back to the business, these meant a lifetime of modification to the  boy's ideals for that business, and modification to the lives of the  \"hands\" back there in Mary Chavah's house--and to something else....    \"What else?\" he asked himself.    Mechanically he looked up and saw the heavens crowded with bright  watchers. In that high field one star, brighter than the others, hung  over the little town. He found himself trying to see the stars as they  had looked to him years ago, when they and the night had seemed to mean  something else....    \"What else?\" he asked himself.    The time did not seem momentous. It was only very quiet. Nothing new was  there, nothing different. It had always been so. The night lay in a  sovereign consciousness of being more than just itself. \"Do you think  that you are all just you and nothing else?\" it was seen to be  compassionately asking.    \"What else?\" Ebenezer asked himself.    He did not face this yet. But in that hour which seemed pure essence,  with no attenuating sound or touch, he kept on up the hill toward  Jenny's house.           *       *       *       *       *    Mary Chavah left ajar the door from the child's room to the room where,  in the dark, the tree stood. He had wanted the door to be ajar \"so the  things I think about can go back and forth,\" he had explained.    In the dining room she wrapped herself in the gray shawl and threw up  the two windows. New air swept in, cleansing, replacing, prevailing. Her  guests had left her early, as is the way in Old Trail Town. Then she had  had her first moments with the child alone. He had done the things that  she had not thought of his doing but had inevitably recognized: Had  delayed his bed-going, had magnified and repeated the offices of his  journey, had shown her the contents of his pockets, had repeatedly  mentioned by their first names his playmates in Idaho and shown surprise  when she asked him who they were. Mary stood now by the window conscious  of a wonderful thing: That it seemed as if he had been there always.    In the clean inrush of the air she was aware of a faint fragrance,  coming to her once and again. She looked down at her garden, lying  wrapped in white and veiled with black, like some secret being. Three  elements were slowly fashioning it, while the fourth, a soft fire within  her, answered them. The fragrance made it seem as if the turn of the  year were very near, as if its prophecy, evident once in the October  violets in her garden, were come again. But when she moved, she knew  that the fragrance came from within the room, from Ellen Bourne's  Christmas rose, blossoming on the table.... Above, her eye fell on the  picture that Jenny had brought to her on that day when she had all but  emptied the house, as if in readiness. Almost she understood now the  passionate expectation in that face, not unlike the expectation of those  who in her dream had kept saying \"You.\"    [Illustration: \"THE THREE MEN STEPPED INTO THE LAMPLIGHT\"]    There was a movement in her garden and on the walk footsteps. The three  men stepped into the rectangle of lamplight--Abel, Ames and Simeon, who  had left the party a little before the others and, hurrying back with  the gifts that they planned, had met Ebenezer at his gate, getting home  from Jenny's house. In Abel's arms was something globed, like a little  world; in Simeon's, the tall, gray-gowned Saint Nicholas taken from the  Exchange window, the lettered sign absent, but the little flag still in  his hand; and Ebenezer was carrying the hobbyhorse. If at him the other  two had wondered somewhat, they had said nothing, in that fashion of  treating the essential which is as peculiar to certain simple, robust  souls as to other kinds of great souls.    \"Has the boy gone to bed?\" Abel asked without preface.    \"Yes,\" Mary answered, \"he has. I'm sorry.\"    \"Never mind,\" Simeon whispered, \"you can give him these in the morning.\"    Mary, her shawl half hiding her face, stooped to take what the three  lifted.    \"They ain't presents, you know,\" Abel assured her positively. \"They're  just--well, just to let him know.\"    Mary set the strange assortment on the floor of the dining room--the  things that were to be nothing in themselves, only just \"to let him  know.\"    \"Thank you for him,\" she said gently. \"And thank you for me,\" she added.    Ebenezer fumbled for a moment at his beaver hat, and took it off. Then  the other two did so to their firm-fixed caps. And with an impulse that  came from no one could tell whom, the three spoke--the first time  hesitatingly, the next time together and confidently.    \"Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas,\" they said.    Mary Chavah lifted her hand.    \"Merry Christmas!\" she cried.    -----------------------------------------------------------------------    The following pages contain advertisements of Macmillan books by the  same author, and new fiction.    -----------------------------------------------------------------------    THE OTHER BOOKS OF MISS GALE    Mothers to Men      Decorated cloth, 12mo, $1.50 net; by mail, $1.62      The author is singularly successful in detaching herself from all the    wear and tear of modern life and has produced a book filled with    sweetness, beautiful in ideas, charming in characterizations, highly    contemplative, and evidencing a philosophy of life all her own.      \"One of the most widely read of our writers of short fiction.\"--_The    Bookman_.

The society clique "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20521"],[0,"The New York Times Current History, A Monthly Magazine (#20)"],[1,"soon as any European conflict should break  out, Gen. Jungbluth protested that for such a step the permission of  Belgium was necessary. The cool reply was that the English knew it,  but thought that, as Belgium was not strong enough alone to protect  herself, England would land troops anyway. Gen. Jungbluth answered  that Belgium felt strong enough to protect herself, which is in  keeping with her declaration to France, when she offered to protect  Belgium by five army corps, as reported in the British \"White Book.\"  The position of England was therefore that, while in 1906 they had  already concerted plans for a joint action, in 1912 England intended  action in any case, should a European conflagration break out.    Now, it must be recollected that as early as July 28, 1914, Sir Edward  Grey said to Prince Lichnowsky, as mentioned in his communication to  Sir E. Goschen: \"The situation was very grave. While it was restricted  to the issues at present actually involved, we had not thought of  interfering in it. But if Germany became involved in it and then  France, the issue might be so great that it would involve all European  interests, and I did not wish him to be misled by the friendly tone of  our conversation--which I hoped would continue--into thinking that we  should stand aside.\" (British \"White Papers,\" No. 89.)    This was at a time when the Belgian issue had not been raised at all.  It only came about by Sir Edward Grey's notes written on July 31. Thus  the British entanglement with France, as evidenced by the British  \"White Book,\" prevented England taking the same attitude in 1914 which  she had taken in 1870, when she made a treaty with France as against  the German invasion of Belgium and with Germany as against the French  invasion of Belgium. A similar agreement was suggested by Prince  Lichnowsky to Sir Edward Grey on Aug. 1, 1914, as reported in the  English \"White Book,\" No. 123, when the former asked Sir Edward Grey  whether if Germany gave a promise not to violate Belgian neutrality  England would engage to remain neutral, upon which Grey replied that  he could not say that.    It is therefore perfectly evident, in the first place, that in case of  a German war, that was sure to be brought about by Russia's  mobilization against Germany, England would go to war against Germany,  and it has been proved that the English assurance to that effect has  strengthened the hands of the Russian war party, which thereupon got  the upper hand and forced the Russian Czar into the war, (see report  of Belgian Charge d'Affaires at St. Petersburg to the Minister of  Foreign Affairs at Brussels, July 30.)    In the second place, it is shown that England meant, with or without  Belgium's will, to land her troops, in violation of Belgium's  neutrality, in Belgium, irrespective of whether German troops were  marching through Belgium or not, because no such declaration had been  made in 1912 or any time thereafter until Aug. 4 in the German  Reichstag. It is further evident that as soon as Russia mobilized,  Germany would have to fight Russia as well as France and England, and  that in such a fight she was forced to draw quickly when she saw her  enemies reaching for their hip pockets. And only the prompt action at  Liege that put this important railway centre commanding the railway  connections to France and Germany into German hands prevented the  English landing and invading Belgium.    The guilt of the Belgian Government in this matter consists, in the  first place, in making and concerting plans with the English and  French Governments as to what steps to take in case of war. A plan of  the French mobilization was found in the same docket, and it cannot be  presumed that the conference between British and French experts was  unknown to the British Military Attache in Brussels. It is furthermore  impossible to believe that the French railway for the shipping of  British troops from Calais, Dunkirk, and Boulogne into Belgium in  Belgian cars could have been used without the knowledge of the French  authorities. Secondly, that Belgium did not heed the advice of Baron  Greindl and did not try to insure her independence in the same way by  approaching Germany and making a similar contract with her. This  disposes of the contention that the Belgian conversation had a purely  defensive character as against all comers. It shows the one-sidedness  of the inclination, which is evidenced also by the placing of all  Belgium's fortresses on the eastern frontier.    The Belgian people had been told at the beginning of the war that  Germany demanded that the Belgian forces should fight with the Germans  against the French and the English, and the truth had become known  only three full months later, when the Belgian \"Gray Book\" was  published. Then Belgium was practically occupied territory. While  Belgium pretended neutrality and friendship toward Germany, it was  secretly planning for her defeat in a war which was considered  unavoidable. The poor Belgian people, however, must suffer because of  the large ambitions of King Leopold of Congo fame and of a broken-down  diplomacy.    The Imperial Chancellor has declared that there was irrefutable proof  that if Germany did not march through Belgium, her enemies would. This  proof, as now being produced, is of the strongest character. So the  Chancellor was right in appealing to the law of necessity, although he  had no regret that it violated international law. This law of  necessity has been recognized as paramount by nearly every prominent  statesman, including Gladstone, and by all teachers of international  law, even by the United States Supreme Court's decision, Vol. 130,  Page 601, stating in regard to the treaty with China concerning  Chinese immigration into the United States: \"It will not be presumed  that the legislative department of the Government will lightly pass  laws which are in conflict with the treaties of the country, but that  circumstances may arise which would not only justify the Government in  disregarding their stipulations, but demand in the interests of the  country that it should do so, there can be no question. Unexpected  events may call for a change in the policy of the country.\" And to  strengthen this opinion another decision by Justice Curtis, rendered  in 1908, may be cited, stating that, \"while it would be a matter of  the utmost gravity and delicacy to refuse to execute a treaty, the  power to do so was a prerogative of which no country could be deprived  without deeply affecting its independence.\"    We now let these Belgian documents speak for themselves.      Summary of the Secret Documents    I. The first document is a report of the Chief of the Belgian General  Staff, Major Gen. Ducarme, to the Minister of War, reporting a series  of conversations which he had had with the Military Attache of the  British Legation, Lieut. Col. Barnardiston, in Brussels. It discloses  that, as early as January, 1906, the Belgian Government was in  consultation with the British Government over steps to be taken by  Belgium, Great Britain, and France against Germany. A plan had been  fully elaborated for the landing of two British army corps in French  ports to be transferred to the point in Belgium necessary for  operations against the Germans. Throughout the conversation the  British and Belgian forces were spoken of as \"allied armies\"; the  British Military Attache insisted on discussing the question of the  chief command; and he urged the establishment, in the meantime, of a  Belgian spy system in Germany.    II. When in the year 1912 Lieut. Col. Barnardiston had been succeeded  by Lieut. Col. Bridges as British Military Attache in Brussels, and  the Chief of the Belgian General Staff, Major Gen. Ducarme, had been  succeeded by Gen. Jungbluth as Chief of the Belgian General Staff, the  conversations proceeded between the two latter officials. That is to  say, these were not casual conversations between individuals, but a  series of official conversations between representatives of their  respective Governments, in pursuance of a well-considered policy on  the part of both Governments.    III. The above documents are given additional significance by a report  made in 1911 by Baron Greindl, Belgian Minister in Berlin, to the  Belgian Minister for Foreign Affairs, from which it appears that this  representative of the Belgian Government in Berlin was familiar with  the plans above set forth and protested against them, asking why like  preparations had not been made with Germany to repel invasion by the  French and English.    Taken together, these documents show that _the British Government had  the intention, in case of a Franco-German war, of sending troops into  Belgium immediately--that is, of doing the very thing which, done by  Germany, was used by England as a pretext for declaring war on  Germany_.    They show also that the Belgian Government took, in agreement with the  English General Staff, military precautions against a hypothetical  German invasion of Belgium. On the other hand, the Belgian Government  never made the slightest attempt to take, in agreement with the German  Government, military precautions against an Anglo-French invasion of  Belgium, though fully informed that it was the purpose of the British  Government to land and dispatch, across French territory into Belgium,  160,000 troops, without asking Belgium's permission, on the first  outbreak of the European war. _This clearly demonstrates that the  Belgian Government was determined from the outset to join Germany's  enemies._    [Illustration: MR.
