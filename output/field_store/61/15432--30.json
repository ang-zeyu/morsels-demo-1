It  is scarcely necessary to add, that the complex apparatus connected with  the exterior nostrils of the Dolphins is wholly wanting in the Balaena  Whales,--a fact of which M. Cuvier was not aware when he wrote his  celebrated Treatise on Comparative Anatomy.    _Appendix_.--Since writing the above, I have received an answer to a  letter I addressed to my friend, John Goodsir, Esq., Professor of  Anatomy in the University of Edinburgh. The request contained in my  letter to Mr. Goodsir was, to examine for me the skeleton of a foetal  _Mysticetus_ now in the University Museum. The foetus from which this  skeleton was prepared was removed from the uterus of the mother, killed  in the North Seas by the seamen of a whaling ship, by one of my former  students, Mr. R. Auld, who presented the specimen to me. The point at  issue was the composition of the cervical vertebrae in the true or  Greenland Whale, the _Balaena Mysticetus_. M. Van Beneden, to whose  memoir I have referred in the commencement of this, says, on the  authority of Eschricht, that at no age whatever do we find in true  Whales (meaning, I presume, the _Mysticetus borealis_ and _australis_)  any distinct vertebrae in the cervical region, as in other mammals. A  fusion of all into one bone or cartilage seems to take place even in the  youngest foetus. Now, I had enjoyed the rare opportunity of dissecting  the foetus of the _Mysticetus_, and I knew that the skeleton, prepared  with the greatest care, was still preserved in the Museum of the  University of Edinburgh. I wrote to Mr. Goodsir to re-examine this point  for me, for I did not find in my notes any confirmation of the  observations of Eschricht. Mr. Goodsir's reply to my note is as  follows:--                                                 \"University, Edinburgh,                                                   Sept. 30, 1857.    \"MY DEAR SIR,    \"In the skeleton of the foetal _Mysticetus_ now in the University  Museum, the bodies of the axis and atlas have shrivelled up together,  having evidently consisted of cartilage only; but the bodies of the five  posterior cervical vertebrae are beautifully distinct, having well-formed  osseous centres, which give them more of the configuration of the  succeeding vertebral bodies than they present in their compressed form  in the adult.    \"The neural arches in the cervical region of this skeleton are five in  number; the two anterior, which are distinctly those of the atlas and  axis, have an osseous nodule on each side, where the transverse  processes pass off. The third arch belongs to the third vertebra, the  fourth and fifth to the sixth and seventh. These three arches are  cartilaginous, and present no osseous centres. It is impossible to  determine from the preparation whether the arches of the fourth and  fifth vertebrae had been cut away in dissecting the parts, or whether  they have shrivelled up in drying; but as the skeleton was very  carefully prepared, and as these two arches are deficient (at least  laterally) in the adult _Mysticetus_, I presume that the cartilaginous  matrices were at least extremely delicate in the foetus.    \"I believe I have stated all the facts, afforded by this skeleton, which  bear upon your questions. They appear to me to afford no support to the  views to which they refer.                                                \"Yours very sincerely,                                            (Signed)        \"JOHN GOODSIR.\"    The conclusion I arrived at is this,--that the actual number of cervical  vertebrae in the _Mysticetus_ is, as in most other mammals, seven, and  that, notwithstanding their earlier fusion, they are originally quite  distinct.    FOOTNOTES:    [C] It is stated that some of the last of these are of wood. The  skeleton in Edinburgh is perfect.

[E] In his paper \"On the Structure of Whales\" (Phil.

Extract of a Letter from Dr. BAIKIE to Sir JOHN RICHARDSON, M.D., C.B.,  F.R. & L.S., dated 29th October, 1857, Rabba, on the Qworra.    [Read January 21st, 1858.]      \"In natural history my collection is advancing, especially in skins and  skeletons of birds. I am collecting skulls of all the domesticated  animals, and skeletons of the sheep and goats. I have got a few fish,  including a prettily-marked _Diodon_ or _Tetraodon_, probably new, and a  _Myletes_ which I did not meet with formerly. The _Siluridae_ are the  most abundant fishes; and one species closely resembles the  _Hypophthalmus_, figured by Rueppell in his 'Fishes of the Nile and Red  Sea.' I have not met with another Polypterus. I shall get a  _Lepidosiren_ in the river, and have heard of an electrical fish, I  believe a _Malopteruris_, such as I formerly found. I enclose two scales  of a fish which is said to grow to the length of 5 feet, but of which I  have specimens half that size only,--also a sketch of a curious fish  2-1/2 feet, which I put into spirits; it has neither ventral nor anal  fins, a very peculiar caudal, and a slender head, while the dorsal  extends along the whole back; eyes very small; teeth numerous and hard,  but not sharp.\" He adds, in a postscript, that he had got the  _Lepidosiren_. He had collected 700 species of plants, and numerous  fine fruits, which he says \"will rejoice Sir William Hooker's heart.\"    Dr. Baikie's postscript, however, mentions that his vessel had been  wrecked about twelve miles above Lagos, and that she sunk in a few  minutes after she struck. He does not say what was the fate of his  collections, but states that all the party had fever from fatigue and  sleeping in swamps after the wreck.--J. R.

The lower shelf is midway between  the floor and seat, and is 19 inches wide. This may or may not be  upholstered, dependent on the character of the material of which it is  made. If upholstered, the boards may be of second-class material,  preferably of pine or other light, soft wood.    A towel rack (Fig. 264) is always a needed article in the kitchen. The  roller may be an old curtain roller cut down to 18 inches in length. The  top piece is 2-1/2 inches wide and 21 inches long. The vertical bars are  each 1-1/2 inches wide and 9 inches long. The brackets are 1-1/2 inches  wide and made of 3/4-inch material.    Fig. 265 represents the framework of a sofa, the seat of which is 16  inches high, the front posts up to the arm-rests 24 inches, and the rear  posts 38 inches. From front to rear the seat is 18 inches. The posts are  of 3\" x 3\" material. This makes a very rigid article of furniture, if  mortised and tenoned and properly glued. The seat is 6 feet long, but it  may be lengthened or shortened to suit the position in which it is to be  placed. It is a companion piece to the chair (Fig. 261).          CHAPTER XVIII    SPECIAL TOOLS AND THEIR USES      In the foregoing chapters we have referred the reader to the simple  tools, but it is thought desirable to add to the information thus given,  an outline of numerous special tools which have been devised and are now  on the market.    BIT AND LEVEL ADJUSTER.--It is frequently necessary to bore holes at  certain angles. This can be done by using a bevel square, and holding it  so one limb will show the boring angle. But this is difficult to do in  many cases.    [Illustration: _Fig. 266. Bit and Square level._]    This tool has three pairs of V slots on its back edges. The shank of the  bit will lie in these slots, as shown in Fig. 266, either vertically, or  at an angle of 45 degrees, and boring can be done with the utmost  accuracy. It may be attached to a Carpenter's square, thus making it an  accurate plumb or level.    MITER BOXES.--The advantages of metal miter boxes is apparent, when  accurate work is required.    The illustration, Fig. 267, shows a metal tool of this kind, in which  the entire frame is in one solid casting. The saw guide uprights are  clamped in tapered sockets in the swivel arm and can be adjusted to hold  the saw without play, and this will also counteract a saw that runs out  of true, due to improper setting or filing.    [Illustration: _Fig. 267. Metal Miter Box._]    A second socket in the swivel arm permits the use of a short saw or  allows a much longer stroke with a standard or regular saw.    The swivel arm is provided with a tapering index pin which engages in  holes placed on the under side of the base. The edge of the base is  graduated in degrees, as plainly shown, and the swivel arm can be set  and automatically fastened at any degree desired.    [Illustration: _Fig. 268. Parts of Metal Miter Box._]    The uprights, front and back are graduated in sixteenths of inches, and  movable stops can be set, by means of thumb-screw to the depth of the  cut desired.    Figure 268 shows the parts of the miter box, in which the numbers  designate the various parts: 101 is the frame; 102 the frame board; 104  frame leg; 106 guide stock; 107 stock guide clamp; 109 stock guide  plate; 110 swivel arm; 111 swivel arm bushing; 112 swivel bushing screw;  113 index clamping lever; 115 index clamping lever catch; 116 index  clamping lever spring; 122 swivel complete; 123 T-base; 124-1/2  uprights; 126 saw guide cap; 127 saw guide cap plate; 132 saw guide tie  bar; 133 left saw guide stop and screw; 134 right side guide stop and  screw; 135 saw guide stop spring; 136 saw guide cylinder; 137 saw guide  cylinder plate; 138 trip lever (back); 139 trip lever (front); 141  leveling screw; 142 trip clamp and screw; 146 T-base clamp screw.    [Illustration: _Fig. 269. Angle Dividers._]    ANGLE DIVIDERS.--This is another tool, which does not cost much and is  of great service to the carpenter in fitting moldings where they are  applied at odd angles.    To lay out the cut with an ordinary bevel necessitates the use of  dividers and a second handling of the bevel, making three operations.    THE \"ODD JOB\" TOOL.--A most useful special tool, which combines in its  make-up a level, plumb try-square, miter-square, bevel, scratch awl,  depth gage, marking gage, miter gage, beam compass, and a one-foot rule.  To the boy who wishes to economize in the purchase of tools this is an  article which should be obtained.    [Illustration: _Fig. 270. \"Odd Job\" Tool._]    Figure 270 shows the simplicity of the tool, and how it is applied in  use.    BIT BRACES.--These tools are now made with so many improved features  that there is really no excuse for getting poor tools.    The illustrations show merely the heads and the lower operating parts of  the tools. Fig. 271 shows a metal-clad ball-bearing head, so called, as  its under side is completely encased in metal securely screwed to the  wood and revolving against the ball thrust bearing.    D represents a concealed ratchet in which the cam ring governs the  ratchet, and, being in line with the bit, makes it more convenient in  handling than when it is at right angles. The ratchet parts are entirely  enclosed, thus keeping out moisture and dirt, retaining lubrication and  protecting the users' hands.    The ratchet mechanism is interchangeable, and may be taken apart by  removing one screw. The two-piece clutch, which is drop forged, is  backed by a very strong spring, insuring a secure lock. When locked, ten  teeth are in engagement, while five are employed while working at a  ratchet. It has universal jaws (G) for both wood and metal workers.    In Fig. 272, B represents a regular ball bearing head, with the wood  screw on the large spindle and three small screws to prevent its working  loose. This also has a ball thrust. E is the ratchet box, and this shows  the gear teeth cut on the extra heavy spindle, and encased, so that the  user's hands are protected from the teeth.    The interlocking jaws (H), which are best for taper shanks, hold up to  No. 2 Clark's expansion, and are therefore particularly adapted for  carpenter's use.    [Illustration: _Fig. 271. Fig. 272. Fig. 273. Types of Bit Braces._]    In Fig. 273 the plain bearing head (C) has no ball thrust. The head is  screwed on the spindle and held from turning off by two small screws.  The open ratchet (F) shows the gear pinned to the spindle and exposed.  This has alligator jaws (J), and will hold all ordinary size taper shank  bits, also small and medium round shank bits or drills.    [Illustration: _Fig. 274. Fig. 275. Fig. 276. Steel Frame Breast Drills._]    STEEL FRAME BREAST DRILL.--These drills are made with both single and  double speed, each speed having three varieties of jaws. The single  speed is very high, the ratio being 4-1/2 to 1, which makes it  desirable to use for small drills, or for use in wood.    A level is firmly set in the frames of these tools to assist the user to  maintain a horizontal position in boring. Each of the forms shown has a  ball thrust bearing between the pinion and frame. The breast plate may  be adjusted to suit and is locked by a set screw. The spindle is kept  from turning while changing drills, by means of the latch mounted on the  frame, and readily engaging with the pinion. The crank is pierced in  three places so that the handle can be set for three different sweeps,  depending on the character of the work.    Figure 274 has a three jaw chuck, and has only single speed. Figure 275  has an interlocking jaw, and is provided with double speed gearing.  Figure 276 has a universal jaw, and double speed.    PLANES.--The most serviceable planes are made in iron, and it might be  well to show a few of the most important, to bring out the manner  employed to make the adjustments of the bits.    In order to familiarize the boy with the different terms used in a  plane, examine Figure 277. The parts are designated as follows: 1A is  the double plane iron; 1 single plane iron; 2 plane iron cap; 3 cap  screw; 4 lever cap; 5 lever cap screw; 6 frog complete; 7 Y adjusting  lever; 8 adjusting nut; 9 lateral adjusting lever; 11 plane handle; 12  plane knob; 13 handle bolt and nut; 14 knob bolt and nut; 15 plane  handle screw; 16 plane bottom; 44 frog pin; 45 frog clamping screw; 46  frog adjusting screw.    [Illustration: _Fig. 277. Details of Metal Plane._]    RABBETING, MATCHING AND DADO PLANES.--Figure 278 shows a useful form of  plane for the reason that it is designed to receive a variety of irons,  adapted to cut rabbets.    The detached sections of Fig. 278 show the various parts, as well as the  bits which belong to it. 1, 1 represent the single plane irons; 4 the  lever cap; 16 the plane bottom, 50 the fence; 51 the fence thumb screw;  61 the short arm; 70 the adjustable depth gage; 71 the depth gage which  goes through the screw; and 85 the spurs with screws.    MOLDING AND BEADING PLANE.--A plane of the character shown in Fig. 279  will do an immense variety of work in molding, beading and dado work,  and is equally well adapted for rabbeting, for filletsters and for match  planing. The regular equipment with this tool comprises fifty-two  cutters.    [Illustration: _Fig. 278. Rabbet, Matching and Dado Plane._]    As shown in Fig. 279, the plane has a main stock (A), which carries the  cutter adjustment, a handle, a depth gage, a slitting gage, and a steel  bottom forming a bearing for the other end of the cutter, and slides on  arms secured to the main stock.    This bottom can be raised or lowered, so that, in addition to allowing  the use of cutters of different widths, cutters can be used having one  edge higher or lower than the edge supported in the main stock.
