There the benefits  that reason had produced during long ages of experiment and insecurity  were applied to the most remote uses, and an effort was made to bring in  a harvest that should be as large, as rich and as complete as possible;  here, on the contrary, the harvest is _blighted_ overnight.... That  which stood there _aere perennis_, the _imperium Romanum_, the most  magnificent form of organization under difficult conditions that has  ever been achieved, and compared to which everything before it and after  it appears as patchwork, bungling, _dilletantism_--those holy anarchists  made it a matter of \"piety\" to destroy \"the world,\" _which is to say_,  the _imperium Romanum_, so that in the end not a stone stood upon  another--and even Germans and other such louts were able to become its  masters.... The Christian and the anarchist: both are _decadents_; both  are incapable of any act that is not disintegrating, poisonous,  degenerating, _blood-sucking_; both have an instinct of _mortal hatred_  of everything that stands up, and is great, and has durability, and  promises life a future.... Christianity was the vampire of the _imperium  Romanum_,--overnight it destroyed the vast achievement of the Romans:  the conquest of the soil for a great culture _that could await its  time_. Can it be that this fact is not yet understood? The _imperium  Romanum_ that we know, and that the history of the Roman provinces  teaches us to know better and better,--this most admirable of all works  of art in the grand manner was merely the beginning, and the structure  to follow was not to _prove_ its worth for thousands of years. To this  day, nothing on a like scale _sub specie aeterni_ has been brought into  being, or even dreamed of!--This organization was strong enough to  withstand bad emperors: the accident of personality has nothing to do  with such things--the _first_ principle of all genuinely great  architecture. But it was not strong enough to stand up against the  _corruptest_ of all forms of corruption--against Christians.... These  stealthy worms, which under the cover of night, mist and duplicity,  crept upon every individual, sucking him dry of all earnest interest in  _real_ things, of all instinct for _reality_--this cowardly, effeminate  and sugar-coated gang gradually alienated all \"souls,\" step by step,  from that colossal edifice, turning against it all the meritorious,  manly and noble natures that had found in the cause of Rome their own  cause, their own serious purpose, their own _pride_. The sneakishness of  hypocrisy, the secrecy of the conventicle, concepts as black as hell,  such as the sacrifice of the innocent, the _unio mystica_ in the  drinking of blood, above all, the slowly rekindled fire of revenge, of  Chandala revenge--all _that_ sort of thing became master of Rome: the  same kind of religion which, in a pre-existent form, Epicurus had  combatted. One has but to read Lucretius to know _what_ Epicurus made  war upon--_not_ paganism, but \"Christianity,\" which is to say, the  corruption of souls by means of the concepts of guilt, punishment and  immortality.--He combatted the _subterranean_ cults, the whole of latent  Christianity--to deny immortality was already a form of genuine  _salvation_.--Epicurus had triumphed, and every respectable intellect in  Rome was Epicurean--_when Paul appeared_ ... Paul, the Chandala hatred  of Rome, of \"the world,\" in the flesh and inspired by genius--the Jew,  the _eternal_ Jew _par excellence_.... What he saw was how, with the aid  of the small sectarian Christian movement that stood apart from Judaism,  a \"world conflagration\" might be kindled; how, with the symbol of \"God  on the cross,\" all secret seditions, all the fruits of anarchistic  intrigues in the empire, might be amalgamated into one immense power.  \"Salvation is of the Jews.\"--Christianity is the formula for exceeding  _and_ summing up the subterranean cults of all varieties, that of  Osiris, that of the Great Mother, that of Mithras, for instance: in his  discernment of this fact the genius of Paul showed itself. His instinct  was here so sure that, with reckless violence to the truth, he put the  ideas which lent fascination to every sort of Chandala religion into the  mouth of the \"Saviour\" as his own inventions, and not only into the  mouth--he _made_ out of him something that even a priest of Mithras  could understand.... This was his revelation at Damascus: he grasped the  fact that he _needed_ the belief in immortality in order to rob \"the  world\" of its value, that the concept of \"hell\" would master Rome--that  the notion of a \"beyond\" is the _death of life_.... Nihilist and  Christian: they rhyme in German, and they do more than rhyme....      59.    The whole labour of the ancient world gone for _naught_: I have no word  to describe the feelings that such an enormity arouses in me.--And,  considering the fact that its labour was merely preparatory, that with  adamantine self-consciousness it laid only the foundations for a work to  go on for thousands of years, the whole _meaning_ of antiquity  disappears!... To what end the Greeks? to what end the Romans?--All the  prerequisites to a learned culture, all the _methods_ of science, were  already there; man had already perfected the great and incomparable art  of reading profitably--that first necessity to the tradition of  culture, the unity of the sciences; the natural sciences, in alliance  with mathematics and mechanics, were on the right road,--_the sense of  fact_, the last and more valuable of all the senses, had its schools,  and its traditions were already centuries old! Is all this properly  understood? Every _essential_ to the beginning of the work was  ready:--and the _most_ essential, it cannot be said too often, are  methods, and also the most difficult to develop, and the longest opposed  by habit and laziness. What we have today reconquered, with unspeakable  self-discipline, for ourselves--for certain bad instincts, certain  Christian instincts, still lurk in our bodies--that is to say, the keen  eye for reality, the cautious hand, patience and seriousness in the  smallest things, the whole _integrity_ of knowledge--all these things  were already there, and had been there for two thousand years! _More_,  there was also a refined and excellent tact and taste! _Not_ as mere  brain-drilling! _Not_ as \"German\" culture, with its loutish manners! But  as body, as bearing, as instinct--in short, as reality.... _All gone for  naught!_ Overnight it became merely a memory!--The Greeks! The Romans!  Instinctive nobility, taste, methodical inquiry, genius for organization  and administration, faith in and the _will_ to secure the future of man,  a great yes to everything entering into the _imperium Romanum_ and  palpable to all the senses, a grand style that was beyond mere art, but  had become reality, truth, _life_....--All overwhelmed in a night, but  not by a convulsion of nature! Not trampled to death by Teutons and  others of heavy hoof! But brought to shame by crafty, sneaking,  invisible, anaemic vampires! Not conquered,--only sucked dry!... Hidden  vengefulness, petty envy, became _master_! Everything wretched,  intrinsically ailing, and invaded by bad feelings, the whole  _ghetto-world_ of the soul, was at once _on top_!--One needs but read  any of the Christian agitators, for example, St. Augustine, in order to  realize, in order to smell, what filthy fellows came to the top. It  would be an error, however, to assume that there was any lack of  understanding in the leaders of the Christian movement:--ah, but they  were clever, clever to the point of holiness, these fathers of the  church! What they lacked was something quite different. Nature  neglected--perhaps forgot--to give them even the most modest endowment  of respectable, of upright, of _cleanly_ instincts.... Between  ourselves, they are not even men.... If Islam despises Christianity, it  has a thousandfold right to do so: Islam at least assumes that it is  dealing with _men_....      60.    Christianity destroyed for us the whole harvest of ancient civilization,  and later it also destroyed for us the whole harvest of _Mohammedan_  civilization. The wonderful culture of the Moors in Spain, which was  fundamentally nearer to _us_ and appealed more to our senses and tastes  than that of Rome and Greece, was _trampled down_ (--I do not say by  what sort of feet--) Why? Because it had to thank noble and manly  instincts for its origin--because it said yes to life, even to the rare  and refined luxuriousness of Moorish life!... The crusaders later made  war on something before which it would have been more fitting for them  to have grovelled in the dust--a civilization beside which even that of  our nineteenth century seems very poor and very \"senile.\"--What they  wanted, of course, was booty: the orient was rich.... Let us put aside  our prejudices! The crusades were a higher form of piracy, nothing more!  The German nobility, which is fundamentally a Viking nobility, was in  its element there: the church knew only too well how the German nobility  was to be _won_.... The German noble, always the \"Swiss guard\" of the  church, always in the service of every bad instinct of the church--_but  well paid_.... Consider the fact that it is precisely the aid of German  swords and German blood and valour that has enabled the church to carry  through its war to the death upon everything noble on earth! At this  point a host of painful questions suggest themselves. The German  nobility stands _outside_ the history of the higher civilization: the  reason is obvious.... Christianity, alcohol--the two _great_ means of  corruption.... Intrinsically there should be no more choice between  Islam and Christianity than there is between an Arab and a Jew. The  decision "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19354"],[0,"Lessons in Music Form (#20)"],[1,"rms_, and the two  _Sonata-allegro forms_.  The latter constitute the superior of the two  classes, for the following reasons:--    In the first place, the rondos rest upon a narrower thematic basis,  centering in one single theme--the Principal one--about which the other  themes revolve.  Further, their most salient structural feature is  nothing more significant than simple _alternation_ (of the Principal  theme with its one or more Subordinates) the Principal theme recurs  after each digression with a persistence that lends a certain  one-sidedness to the form,--only excepting in the Third (and highest)  Rondo-form, which, by virtue of its broad Recapitulation of the first  Division, approaches most nearly the rank of the Sonata-allegro design,  as will be seen.    In the Sonata-allegro forms, on the other hand, the leading purpose is  _to unite two co-ordinate themes upon an equal footing_; one is to  appear as often as the other; and the two themes _together_ constitute  the thematic basis of the design.  These are, as in the rondos, a  Principal theme (called principal because it appears first, and thus  becomes in a sense the index of the whole movement), and a Subordinate  theme (so called in contradistinction to the other),--contrasting in  character, as usual, but actually of equal importance, and of nearly or  quite equal length.  To these, there is commonly added a codetta (or  \"concluding theme\" as it is {122} sometimes called, though it seldom  attains to the dignity of a _theme_),--sometimes two, or even more,  codettas, which answer the general purpose of a coda, rounding off and  balancing this Division of the design.  This union of the two or three  thematic components that are to represent the contents of the design,  is the _Exposition_, or first Division, of the Sonata-allegro forms.  It indicates a point of contact between the latter and the rondo,--in  the _Third_ form of which we also find an Exposition.  Careful  comparison of the two types of exposition reveals the significant  difference between the two classes, however; in the Third Rondo, the  exposition was an _alternation_ of themes, with decided preference for  the principal one; in the Sonata-allegro it is a _union_ of themes,  without preference, resulting in a broader thematic basis.      THE SONATINE FORM.--In the Sonatine-form, or the smaller variety of the  sonata-allegro designs, this Exposition (or first Division) is followed  _at once_,--or after a few measures of interlude, or re-transitional  material,--by a Recapitulation of the Division, as was seen in the  Third Rondo-form, and under the same conditions of transposition as  there.  The diagram of the form is therefore as follows:--              Exposition.                           Recapitulation.   -----------------------------           ------------------------------   PR. TH.    SUB. TH.  CODETTA.   Very    PR. TH.   SUB. TH.   CODETTA.   -----------------------------   brief   ------------------------------   As usual.  In some   Optional.  Inter-  As        In the     Also in              related              lude    before.   principal  principal              key.                                   key.       key.    An additional coda is, as usual, likely to appear at the end.    This diagram should be very carefully compared with that of the Third  Rondo-form on page 119, and the points both of agreement and  dissimilarity noted.  More minute details of the Sonatine form will be  given in the next chapter, in connection with the larger and more fully  developed Sonata-allegro form.    An illustration of the Sonatine-form will be found in Mozart, 6th  pianoforte sonata, _adagio_.  Number the measures, as usual, and  analyze with reference to the indications given; the figures in  parenthesis again denote the measures.    _Principal Theme_, B-flat major, period-form,--possibly double-period,  because of the slow tempo and large measures (1-8).  There is no  Transition.    _Subordinate Theme_, F major, period-form, extended.  Antecedent  (9-12); consequent, very similar (13-16); extension by addition of new  phrase, as in the group-form (16 1/2-19).    _Codetta_, also in F major, very brief, only one-half measure, and  repeated as usual (19 1/2-20).  This ends the Exposition.    _Interlude_, the remaining beats of measure 20; it is, of course, a  brief re-transition, and is therefore strongly suggestive of the First  Rondo-form, the _details of which exactly coincide, thus far, with the  above factors of the sonatine-form_.   Such coincidences merely confirm  the unbroken line of evolution, and are to be expected in the system of  legitimate, rational music designs.  The RECAPITULATION (the original  _da capo_) follows, beginning with the    _Principal Theme_, B-flat major, as before (21-28) but somewhat  embellished.  Again, there is no Transition.  (Here the similarity to  the First Rondo ends.)    _Subordinate Theme_, corresponds very closely to the former version,  but transposed to B-flat major, the principal key, and variated (29-39).    _Codetta_, also in B-flat major (39 1/2-40), slightly extended.  There  is no coda.      LESSON 16.--Analyze the following examples of the sonatine-form, in the  usual exhaustive manner:--    Beethoven, pianoforte sonatas; op. 10, No. 1, _Adagio_.    Op. 31, No. 2, _Adagio_.    Mendelssohn, _Andante cantabile_ in B-flat major (pianoforte).    Mozart, pianoforte sonata.  No. 17, _Andante amoroso_ (somewhat longer  interlude).    Mendelssohn, _Presto agitato_ in B minor for pianoforte (preceded by an  \"Andante cantabile\" which has no connection with the sonatine-form of  the _presto_, but may also be analyzed).  This design is very broad;  each factor is expanded to its fullest legitimate extent, especially  the \"codetta\" section.          {124}    CHAPTER XVII.  THE SONATA-ALLEGRO FORM.    ORIGIN OF THE NAME.--The fully developed Sonata-allegro form is the  design in which the classic overture and the first movement of the  symphony, sonata and concerto are usually framed.  The student must be  careful not to confound this musical form with the _complete_ sonata of  three or four movements.  It is not to be called the \"sonata form,\" but  the \"sonata-allegro form.\"  It is to one movement only, generally the  first one, which is (or was) very commonly an _allegro_ tempo in the  sonata and symphony, that the present design refers; and its name,  sonata-allegro, is derived from that old historic species of the sonata  which consisted originally of but one movement, generally an _allegro_.      THE SONATA-ALLEGRO FORM.--As distinguished from the sonatine-form, with  its two Divisions, this larger species, based upon precisely the same  structural idea, has _three Divisions_,--the Exposition, a middle  Division called the Development (growing out of the brief interlude of  the sonatine-form), and the Recapitulation.  The diagram (the keys of  which correspond to the plan of Beethoven, op. 14, No. 2, first  movement) is as follows:          Exposition.        Middle Div.         Recapitulation.   ----------------------  -------------  -------------------------   Pr.    Sub.   Codetta.  Development,   Phr.    Sub.    Codetta   Th.    Th.              various keys,  Th.     Th.     and Coda.   ----------------------  ending with    -------------------------   G maj. D maj.  D maj.   Retransition.  G maj.  G maj.  G maj.      Compare this diagram, also, with that of the Third Rondo-form, and  note, accurately, the points of resemblance and contrast.    Compare it, further, with the diagram of the sonatine-form, on page  122.  It will be observed that here the Recapitulation does not follow  the Exposition at once, as there, but that a complete middle division  intervenes, instead of the brief interlude or re-transition; from which  the student may conclude that the sonatine-form gradually grows into  the sonata-allegro form, as this interlude becomes longer, more  elaborate, and more like an independent division of the design.  Or  inversely, and perhaps more correctly, the sonata-allegro becomes a  sonatine-design _by the omission (or contraction) of the middle  Division_.      THE EXPOSITION.--The presentation of the thematic factors, the  statement or Exposition of the two themes and codetta, is made exactly  as in the sonatine-form, though probably upon a broader scale.  The  Principal theme is usually a Two-Part Song-form, at least; often  Three-Part.  In broader designs, a separate transitional passage  appears; in more concise designs, the transition is developed out of  the last Part of the Principal theme by the process of dissolution--as  will be seen.  The object of the transition is, as usual, _to lead into  the new key_ (of the Subordinate theme).  It is sometimes, though very  rarely, omitted.    The Subordinate theme contrasts notably with its fellow, but asserts  equal importance, as a rule, and may be of equal, or nearly equal,  length.  The addition of a codetta is almost indispensable, and  frequently two or more appear, growing successively shorter, and  generally repeated.  In the sonata-allegro _the Exposition closes, as a  rule, with a very decisive perfect cadence_, followed by a double-bar,  and--especially in older sonatas--repetition-marks; the repetition of  the Exposition being justly considered important, as a means of  emphasizing the \"statement,\" and enforcing the hearer's attention to  the thematic contents before preceding to their development in the  second division of the form.  In the sonatine-form, on the contrary,  this positive termination of the Exposition (and consequently the  double-bar and repetition) will very rarely be found.      THE DEVELOPMENT, OR MIDDLE DIVISION.  The second division of the  sonata-allegro form is devoted to a more or less extensive and  elaborate manipulation and combination of such figures, motives,  phrases or Parts of the Exposition as prove inviting"]]]
