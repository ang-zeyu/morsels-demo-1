And dem scoundrils--oh! dem scoundrils--\"    Quashy's feelings at this point failed to find vent in words  sufficiently expressive, so he relieved them to some extent by shaking  his fist at scoundreldom in general, and grinding his teeth.  No words  could have expressed his feelings half so well.  By way of changing a  subject that appeared to be almost too much for him, he turned abruptly  to the Indian girl; and said, in Spanish quite as bad as that of  Lawrence--    \"But where were _you_, senhorina, all the time?\"    \"Ay, Manuela, let's hear how it was that you escaped,\" said Pedro  quickly, in Indian.    \"I escaped through the mercy of God,\" replied the girl, in a low voice.    \"True, Manuela, true,\" replied the guide, \"you never said a truer word  than that; but by what means was His mercy displayed?\"    \"I can scarcely tell,\" returned the girl; \"when the earthquake came I  was sitting on my bed.  Then the wall of the room seemed to fall on me,  and my senses were gone.  How long I lay so, I cannot tell.  When I  recovered my mind I felt as if buried alive, but I could breathe, and  although unable to rise, I could move.  Then I heard cries, and I  replied; but my strength was gone, and I think no one heard me.  Then I  prayed, and then, I think, I slept, but am not sure.  At last I heard a  spade striking the earth above me.  Soon an opening was made, and I was  dragged rudely out.  The rest you know.\"    On this being interpreted to her companions, Quashy gave it as his  decided opinion that a miracle had been performed for her special  deliverance; but Lawrence thought that, without miraculous interference,  God had caused a mass of wall to fall over and protect her in much the  same way that he himself had been protected.    While they were talking thus, and slowly descending one of the numerous  richly-wooded, though rugged, paths which traverse the lower slopes of  the Andes, they encountered a party of horsemen from the Pampas.  They  were well-armed, and from their looks might have been another troop of  banditti, coming like human vultures from afar to swoop down on the  carcass of the unfortunate town.    To have shown the slightest hesitancy or fear--supposing them to have  been what they looked--would have been to invite attack, but, as the  reader knows, our travellers were not the men to betray themselves thus.  Before starting, they had carefully examined their weapons, and had  bestowed them about their persons somewhat ostentatiously.  Pedro had  even caused Manuela to stick a brace of small pistols and a large knife  in her belt; and, as Indian women are sometimes known to be capable of  defending themselves as vigorously as men, she was by no means a cipher  in the effective strength of the party.    With a dignified yet free-and-easy air that would have done credit to a  Spanish Don of the olden time, Pedro saluted the party as he rode past.  His aspect, and the quiet, self-possessed air of the huge Englishman,  with the singularity of his cudgel, coupled with the look of graceful  decision about the Indian maiden, and the blunt bull-doggedness of the  square negro, were sufficient to ensure a polite response, not only from  that party, but from several other bands of the same stamp that were met  with during the day.    Diverging from the main road in order to avoid these bands, they  followed a track well-known to the guide.  Towards the afternoon, from  the top of a rising ground, they descried a solitary foot traveller  wending his way wearily up the hill.    He was a man of middle age, and powerfully-built, but walked with such  evident difficulty that it seemed as if he were either ill or exhausted.  Pedro eyed him with considerable suspicion as he approached.  In  passing, he begged for assistance.  As he spoke in French, Lawrence,  whose sympathies, like those of Quashy, were easily roused, asked in  that tongue what was the matter with him.    He had been robbed, he said, by that villainous bandit, Conrad of the  Mountains, or some one extremely like him, and had been nearly killed by  him.  He was on his way to San Ambrosio, where his wife and family  dwelt, having heard that it had been greatly damaged, if not destroyed,  by an earthquake.    \"It has been utterly destroyed, my poor fellow,\" said Lawrence, in a  tone of pity; \"but it may be that your family has escaped.  A good  number of people have escaped.  Here are a few dollars for you.  You  will need them, I fear.  You can owe them to me, and pay them when next  we meet.\"    The gift was accompanied with a look of pleasantry, for Lawrence well  knew there was little chance of their ever meeting again.    Pedro sat regarding them with a grim smile.  \"You are a stout fellow,\"  he said, in a tone that was not conciliatory, after the beggar had  accepted the dollars with many expressions of gratitude; \"from all I  have heard of Conrad of the Mountains, you are quite a match for him, if  he were alone.\"    \"He was not alone, senhor,\" replied the beggar, with a look that told of  a temper easily disturbed.    To this Pedro replied contemptuously, \"Oh, indeed!\" and, turning  abruptly away, rode on.    \"You doubt that man?\" said Lawrence, following him.    \"I do.\"    \"He looked honest.\"    \"Men are not always to be judged by their looks.\"    \"Das a fact!\" interposed Quashy; \"what would peepil judge ob _me_, now,  if dey hoed by looks?\"    \"They'd say you were a fine, genial, hearty, good-natured blockhead,\"  said Lawrence, laughing.    \"True, massa, you's right.  I'm all dat an' wuss, but not _always_ dat.  Sometimes I'm roused; an' I'm _awrful_ w'en I'm roused!  You should see  me w'en my back's riz.  Oh _my_!\"    The negro opened his eyes and mouth so awfully at the mere idea of such  a rising that his companions were fain to seek relief in laughter.  Even  the grave Manuela gave way to unrestrained merriment, for if she failed  to thoroughly understand Quashy's meaning, she quite understood his  face.    That night they found welcome shelter in a small farm.    \"Did you fall in with the notorious bandit, Conrad of the Mountains?\"  asked their host, after the ceremonious reception of his guests was  over.    \"No, senhor,\" answered Pedro.  \"Is that fellow in this neighbourhood  just now?\"    \"So it is said, senhor.  I have not seen him myself, and should not know  him if I saw him, but from descriptions I should think it must be he.  I  have a poor fellow--a peon--lying here just now, who has been robbed and  nearly murdered by him.  Come, he is in the next room; you can speak to  him.\"    Saying this, the host introduced Pedro and Lawrence into an inner  chamber, where the wounded man lay, groaning horribly.  He was very  ready, indeed eager, to give all the information in his power.  Fear had  evidently given the poor fellow an exaggerated idea of the appearance of  the man who had waylaid him; nevertheless, from his description our  travellers had no difficulty in recognising the poor bereaved beggar  whom they had met and assisted.    \"Was he a large man?\" asked Pedro.    \"Yes, yes, senhor; tremendous!--seven feet or more, and _so_\"--  indicating about three feet--\"across the shoulders.  Rough black head,  huge black beard and moustache, hawk nose, with such awful eyes, and the  strength of a tiger!  I could never have been so easily overcome by one  man if he had not been a giant.\"    \"You see,\" said Pedro in English, turning to Lawrence with a smile, \"the  description tallies exactly, making due allowance for this poor fellow's  alarm.  He must be a clever fellow this Conrad of the Mountains, for he  has not only frightened a peon out of his wits, but roused the pity of  an Englishman by asserting that he had been robbed by _himself_!  Your  charity, you see, was ill bestowed.\"    \"So, it seems we might have made this noted bandit prisoner if we had  only known!\" exclaimed Lawrence, who seemed more distressed at missing  the chance of becoming an amateur thief-catcher than at misdirected  charity.  \"But do you really think the fellow was Conrad of the  Mountains?\"    \"I am certain he was not,\" said Pedro.    \"How do you know?\"    \"I have several grounds for my belief, but, even if I had not, I might  easily judge from appearances.  Conrad is said to be kind to women and  children.  The scoundrel we met with could not be kind to any one.  Moreover, there is no clear proof that Conrad _is_ a bandit, while this  man certainly is one.\"    \"I'm sorry you seem so sure, because I should like much to be able to  say I had seen this notorious fellow about whom every one appears to  hear so much and to know so little.\"    Although the bandit of whom we have just made mention was not Conrad of  the Mountains, it may interest the reader to know that he was in truth a  sufficiently notorious villain, named Fan, the captain of a band of  twenty assassins, most of whom were escaped criminals from the prisons  of Chili and Peru.  Among other exploits, Fan once attacked the armed  escort of a troop of mules conveying silver in bars from the mines to  Chili.  Fan and his men attacked them in a ravine so suddenly, and with  such a deadly fire of musketry, that the few who survived laid down  their arms at once, on the promise being made that their lives should be  spared.    Banditti do not usually regard promises as binding.  It would be  surprising if they did.  Fan made the survivors lie down on their faces,  and was about to plunder the mules, when he changed his mind, and shot  all the rest of the convoy in cold blood, except the last, who, seeing  the fate that awaited him, leaped over a precipice, rolled down a steep  slope many hundred feet deep, and, strange to say, escaped with his  life.  He then procured a dozen or two well-armed men, and returned to  the scene of the robbery, but found that the robbers had flown with as  much silver as they could carry,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21721"],[0,"The Coral Island (#20)"],[1," earthly, with special reference to the forsaken condition of a  poor shipwrecked sailor-boy!\"  So saying, Peterkin waved his hand,  turned from us, and cast himself upon the ground with a look of  melancholy resignation, which was so well feigned that I would have  thought it genuine had he not accompanied it with a gentle wink.  We  both laughed, and springing from the rocks together, plunged head first  into the sea.    We gained the interior of the submarine cave without difficulty, and on  emerging from the waves, supported ourselves for some time by treading  water, while we held the two bundles above our heads.  This we did in  order to let our eyes become accustomed to the obscurity.  Then, when we  could see sufficiently, we swam to a shelving rock, and landed in  safety.  Having wrung the water from our trousers, and dried ourselves  as well as we could under the circumstances, we proceeded to ignite the  torch.  This we accomplished without difficulty in a few minutes; and no  sooner did it flare up than we were struck dumb with the wonderful  objects that were revealed to our gaze.  The roof of the cavern just  above us seemed to be about ten feet high, but grew higher as it receded  into the distance until it was lost in darkness.  It seemed to be made  of coral, and was supported by massive columns of the same material.  Immense icicles (as they appeared to us) hung from it in various places.  These, however, were formed, not of ice, but of a species of limestone,  which seemed to flow in a liquid form towards the point of each, where  it became solid.  A good many drops fell, however, to the rock below,  and these formed little cones, which rose to meet the points above.  Some of them had already met, and thus we saw how the pillars were  formed, which at first seemed to us as if they had been placed there by  some human architect to support the roof.  As we advanced farther in we  saw that the floor was composed of the same material as the pillars, and  it presented the curious appearance of ripples such as are formed on  water when gently ruffled by the wind.  There were several openings on  either hand in the walls that seemed to lead into other caverns, but  these we did not explore at this time.  We also observed that the  ceiling was curiously marked in many places, as if it were the fretwork  of a noble cathedral; and the walls, as well as the roof, sparkled in  the light of our torch, and threw back gleams and flashes as if they  were covered with precious stones.  Although we proceeded far into this  cavern, we did not come to the end of it; and we were obliged to return  more speedily than we would otherwise have done, as our torch was nearly  expended.  We did not observe any openings in the roof, or any  indications of places whereby light might enter; but near the entrance  to the cavern stood an immense mass of pure-white coral rock, which  caught and threw back the little light that found an entrance through  the cave's mouth, and thus produced, we conjectured, the pale-green  object which had first attracted our attention.  We concluded, also,  that the reflecting power of this rock was that which gave forth the dim  light that faintly illumined the first part of the cave.    Before diving through the passage again we extinguished the small piece  of our torch that remained, and left it in a dry spot--conceiving that  we might possibly stand in need of it if, at any future time, we should  chance to wet our torch while diving into the cavern.  As we stood for a  few minutes after it was out, waiting till our eyes became accustomed to  the gloom, we could not help remarking the deep, intense stillness and  the unutterable gloom of all around us; and as I thought of the  stupendous dome above, and the countless gems that had sparkled in the  torchlight a few minutes before, it came into my mind to consider how  strange it is that God should make such wonderful and exquisitely  beautiful works never to be seen at all--except, indeed, by chance  visitors such as ourselves.    I afterwards found that there were many such caverns among the islands  of the South Seas, some of them larger and more beautiful than the one I  have just described.    \"Now, Ralph, are you ready?\" said Jack in a low voice, that seemed to  echo up into the dome above.    \"Quite ready.\"    \"Come along, then,\" said he; and plunging off the ledge of the rock into  the water, we dived through the narrow entrance.  In a few seconds we  were panting on the rocks above, and receiving the congratulations of  our friend Peterkin.        CHAPTER FOURTEEN.    STRANGE PECULIARITY OF THE TIDES--ALSO OF THE TWILIGHT--PETERKIN'S  REMARKABLE CONDUCT IN EMBRACING A LITTLE PIG AND KILLING A BIG SOW--SAGE  REMARKS ON JESTING--ALSO ON LOVE.    It was quite a relief to us to breathe the pure air and to enjoy the  glad sunshine after our long ramble in the Diamond Cave, as we named it;  for although we did not stay more than half-an-hour away, it seemed to  us much longer.  While we were dressing, and during our walk home, we  did our best to satisfy the curiosity of poor Peterkin, who seemed to  regret, with lively sincerity, his inability to dive.    There was no help for it, however, so we condoled with him as we best  could.  Had there been any great rise or fall in the tide of these seas,  we might perhaps have found it possible to take him down with us at low  water; but as the tide never rose or fell more than eighteen inches or  two feet, this was impossible.    This peculiarity of the tide--its slight rise and fall--had not  attracted our observation till some time after our residence on the  island.  Neither had we observed another curious circumstance until we  had been some time there.  This was the fact that the tide rose and fell  with constant regularity, instead of being affected by the changes of  the moon as in our own country, and as it is in most other parts of the  world--at least, in all those parts with which I am acquainted.  Every  day and every night, at twelve o'clock precisely, the tide is at the  full; and at six o'clock, every morning and evening, it is ebb.  I can  speak with much confidence on this singular circumstance, as we took  particular note of it, and never found it to alter.  Of course I must  admit we had to guess the hour of twelve midnight, and I think we could  do this pretty correctly; but in regard to twelve noon we are quite  positive, because we easily found the highest point that the sun reached  in the sky by placing ourselves at a certain spot whence we observed the  sharp summit of a cliff resting against the sky, just where the sun  passed.    Jack and I were surprised that we had not noticed this the first few  days of our residence here, and could only account for it by our being  so much taken up with the more obvious wonders of our novel situation.  I have since learned, however, that this want of observation is a sad  and very common infirmity of human nature, there being hundreds of  persons before whose eyes the most wonderful things are passing every  day who nevertheless, are totally ignorant of them.  I therefore have to  record my sympathy with such persons, and to recommend to them a course  of conduct which I have now for a long time myself adopted--namely, the  habit of forcing my attention upon all things that go on around me, and  of taking some degree of interest in them whether I feel it naturally or  not.  I suggest this the more earnestly, though humbly, because I have  very frequently come to know that my indifference to a thing has  generally been caused by my ignorance in regard to it.    We had much serious conversation on this subject of the tides; and Jack  told us, in his own quiet, philosophical way, that these tides did great  good to the world in many ways, particularly in the way of cleansing the  shores of the land, and carrying off the filth that was constantly  poured into the sea therefrom--which, Peterkin suggested, was remarkably  tidy of it to do.  Poor Peterkin could never let slip an opportunity to  joke, however inopportune it might be, which at first we found rather a  disagreeable propensity, as it often interrupted the flow of very  agreeable conversation--and, indeed, I cannot too strongly record my  disapprobation of this tendency in general; but we became so used to it  at last that we found it no interruption whatever.  Indeed, strange to  say, we came to feel that it was a necessary part of our enjoyment (such  is the force of habit), and found the sudden outbursts of mirth,  resulting from his humorous disposition, quite natural and refreshing to  us in the midst of our more serious conversations.  But I must not  misrepresent Peterkin.  We often found, to our surprise, that he knew  many things which we did not; and I also observed that those things  which he learned from experience were never forgotten.  From all these  things I came at length to understand that things very opposite and  dissimilar in themselves, when united, do make an agreeable whole; as,  for example, we three on this our island, although most unlike in many  things, when united, made a trio so harmonious that I question if there  ever met before such an agreeable triumvirate.  There was, indeed, no  note of discord whatever in the symphony we played together on that  sweet Coral Island; and I am now persuaded that this was owing to our  having been all tuned to the same key--namely, that of _love_!  Yes, we  loved one another with much fervency while we lived on that island; and,  for the matter of that, we love each other still.    And while I am on this subject, or rather the subject that just preceded  it--namely, the tides--I may here remark on another curious natural  phenomenon.  We found that there was little or no twilight in this  island.  We had a distinct remembrance of the charming long twilight at  home, which some people think the"]]]
