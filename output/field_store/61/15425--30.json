[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2060"],[0,"The History of Caliph Vathek (#20)"],[1,"all started with a preternatural alertness, plunging,  kicking, and running foul of each other in the most ludicrous manner  imaginable.    Nouronihar and the Caliph mutually contended who should most enjoy so  degrading a sight; they burst out in volleys of laughter to see the old  men and their asses fall into the stream; the leg of one was fractured,  the shoulder of another dislocated, the teeth of a third dashed out, and  the rest suffered still worse.    Two days more, undisturbed by fresh embassies, having been devoted to the  pleasures of Rocnabad, the expedition proceeded, leaving Shiraz on the  right, and verging towards a large plain, from whence were discernible on  the edge of the horizon the dark summits of the mountains of Istakar.    At this prospect the Caliph and Nouronihar were unable to repress their  transports; they bounded from their litter to the ground, and broke forth  into such wild exclamations, as amazed all within hearing.  Interrogating  each other, they shouted, \"Are we not approaching the radiant palace of  light? or gardens more delightful than those of Sheddad?\"  Infatuated  mortals! they thus indulged delusive conjecture, unable to fathom the  decrees of the Most High!    The good Genii, who had not totally relinquished the superintendence of  Vathek, repairing to Mahomet in the seventh heaven, said: \"Merciful  Prophet! stretch forth thy propitious arms towards thy Vicegerent, who is  ready to fall irretrievably into the snare which his enemies, the Dives,  have prepared to destroy him; the Giaour is awaiting his arrival in the  abominable palace of fire, where, if he once set his foot, his perdition  will be inevitable.\"    Mahomet answered with an air of indignation: \"He hath too well deserved  to be resigned to himself, but I permit you to try if one effort more  will be effectual to divert him from pursuing his ruin.\"    One of these beneficent Genii, assuming without delay the exterior of a  shepherd, more renowned for his piety than all the Dervises and Santons  of the region, took his station near a flock of white sheep on the slope  of a hill, and began to pour forth from his flute such airs of pathetic  melody as subdued the very soul, and, awakening remorse, drove far from  it every frivolous fancy.  At these energetic sounds the sun hid himself  beneath a gloomy cloud, and the waters of two little lakes, that were  naturally clearer than crystal, became of a colour like blood.  The whole  of this superb assembly was involuntarily drawn towards the declivity of  the hill; with downcast eyes they all stood abashed, each upbraiding  himself with the evil he had done; the heart of Dilara palpitated, and  the chief of the eunuchs with a sigh of contrition implored pardon of the  women, whom for his own satisfaction he had so often tormented.    Vathek and Nouronihar turned pale in their litter, and, regarding each  other with haggard looks, reproached themselves--the one with a thousand  of the blackest crimes, a thousand projects of impious ambition--the  other with the desolation of her family, and the perdition of the amiable  Gulchenrouz.  Nouronihar persuaded herself that she heard in the fatal  music the groans of her dying father, and Vathek the sobs of the fifty  children he had sacrificed to the Giaour.  Amidst these complicated pangs  of anguish they perceived themselves impelled towards the shepherd, whose  countenance was so commanding, that Vathek for the first time felt  overawed, whilst Nouronihar concealed her face with her hands.    The music paused, and the Genius, addressing the Caliph, said: \"Deluded  Prince! to whom Providence hath confided the care of innumerable  subjects, is it thus that thou fulfillest thy mission?  Thy crimes are  already completed, and art thou now hastening towards thy punishment?  Thou knowest that beyond these mountains Eblis and his accursed Dives  hold their infernal empire; and, seduced by a malignant phantom, thou art  proceeding to surrender thyself to them!  This moment is the last of  grace allowed thee; abandon thy atrocious purpose; return; give back  Nouronihar to her father, who still retains a few sparks of life; destroy  thy tower with all its abominations; drive Carathis from thy councils; be  just to thy subjects; respect the ministers of the Prophet; compensate  for thy impieties by an exemplary life; and, instead of squandering thy  days in voluptuous indulgence, lament thy crimes on the sepulchres of thy  ancestors.  Thou beholdest the clouds that obscure the sun; at the  instant he recovers his splendour, if thy heart be not changed, the time  of mercy assigned thee will be past for ever.\"    Vathek, depressed with fear, was on the point of prostrating himself at  the feet of the shepherd, whom he perceived to be of a nature superior to  man; but, his pride prevailing, he audaciously lifted his head, and,  glancing at him one of his terrible looks, said: \"Whoever thou art,  withhold thy useless admonitions; thou wouldst either delude me, or art  thyself deceived.  If what I have done be so criminal as thou pretendest,  there remains not for me a moment of grace; I have traversed a sea of  blood to acquire a power which will make thy equals tremble; deem not  that I shall retire when in view of the port, or that I will relinquish  her who is dearer to me than either my life or thy mercy.  Let the sun  appear! let him illumine my career! it matters not where it may end.\"  On  uttering these words, which made even the Genius shudder, Vathek threw  himself into the arms of Nouronihar, and commanded that his horse should  be forced back to the road.    There was no difficulty in obeying these orders, for the attraction had  ceased; the sun shone forth in all his glory, and the shepherd vanished  with a lamentable scream.    The fatal impression of the music of the Genius remained,  notwithstanding, in the heart of Vathek's attendants; they viewed each  other with looks of consternation; at the approach of night almost all of  them escaped, and of this numerous assemblage there only remained the  chief of the eunuchs, some idolatrous slaves, Dilara and a few other  women, who, like herself, were votaries of the religion of the Magi.    The Caliph, fired with the ambition of prescribing laws to the  Intelligences of Darkness, was but little embarrassed at this  dereliction; the impetuosity of his blood prevented him from sleeping,  nor did he encamp any more as before.  Nouronihar, whose impatience, if  possible, exceeded his own, importuned him to hasten his march, and  lavished on him a thousand caresses to beguile all reflection; she  fancied herself already more potent than Balkis, and pictured to her  imagination the Genii falling prostrate at the foot of her throne.  In  this manner they advanced by moonlight, till they came within view of the  two towering rocks that form a kind of portal to the valley, at whose  extremity rose the vast ruins of Istakar.  Aloft on the mountain  glimmered the fronts of various royal mausoleums, the horror of which was  deepened by the shadows of night.  They passed through two villages  almost deserted, the only inhabitants remaining being a few feeble old  men, who, at the sight of horses and litters, fell upon their knees and  cried out:    \"O Heaven! is it then by these phantoms that we have been for six months  tormented?  Alas! it was from the terror of these spectres and the noise  beneath the mountains, that our people have fled, and left us at the  mercy of maleficent spirits!\"    The Caliph, to whom these complaints were but unpromising auguries, drove  over the bodies of these wretched old men, and at length arrived at the  foot of the terrace of black marble; there he descended from his litter,  handing down Nouronihar; both with beating hearts stared wildly around  them, and expected with an apprehensive shudder the approach of the  Giaour; but nothing as yet announced his appearance.    A death-like stillness reigned over the mountain and through the air; the  moon dilated on a vast platform the shades of the lofty columns, which  reached from the terrace almost to the clouds; the gloomy watch-towers,  whose numbers could not be counted, were veiled by no roof, and their  capitals, of an architecture unknown in the records of the earth, served  as an asylum for the birds of darkness, which, alarmed at the approach of  such visitants, fled away croaking.    The chief of the eunuchs, trembling with fear, besought Vathek that a  fire might be kindled.    \"No!\" replied he, \"there is no time left to think of such trifles; abide  where thou art, and expect my commands.\"    Having thus spoken, he presented his hand to Nouronihar, and, ascending  the steps of a vast staircase, reached the terrace, which was flagged  with squares of marble, and resembled a smooth expanse of water, upon  whose surface not a leaf ever dared to vegetate; on the right rose the  watch-towers, ranged before the ruins of an immense palace, whose walls  were embossed with various figures; in front stood forth the colossal  forms of four creatures, composed of the leopard and the griffin; and,  though but of stone, inspired emotions of terror; near these were  distinguished by the splendour of the moon, which streamed full on the  place, characters like those on the sabres of the Giaour, that possessed  the same virtue of changing every moment; these, after vacillating for  some time, at last fixed in Arabic letters, and prescribed to the Caliph  the following words:    \"Vathek! thou hast violated the conditions of my parchment, and deservest  to be sent back; but, in favour to thy companion, and as the meed for  what thou hast done to obtain it, EBLIS permitteth that the portal of his  palace shall be opened, and the subterranean fire will receive thee into  the number of its adorers.\"    He scarcely had read these words before the mountain against which the  terrace was reared trembled, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20606"],[0,"The Magic City (#20)"],[1,".'    So they played noughts and crosses on the Pebbly Waste, and behind them  the parrot and the Hippogriff took away the tiresome one, and in front  of them lay the high pebble ridge that was like a mountain, and beyond  that was the unknown and the adventure and the Dwellers and the deed to  be done.          CHAPTER VII    THE DWELLERS BY THE SEA      You soon get used to things. It seemed quite natural and homelike to  Philip to be wakened in bright early out-of-door's morning by the gentle  beak of the parrot at his ear.    'You got back all right then,' he said sleepily.    'It was rather a long journey,' said the parrot, 'but I thought it  better to come back by wing. The Hippogriff offered to bring me; he is  the soul of courteous gentleness. But he was tired too. The  Pretenderette is in gaol for the moment, but I'm afraid she'll get out  again; we're so unused to having prisoners, you see. And it's no use  putting _her_ on her honour, because----'    'Because she hasn't any,' Philip finished.    'I wouldn't say _that_,' said the parrot, 'of anybody. I'd only say we  haven't come across it. What about breakfast?'    'How meals do keep happening,' said Lucy, yawning; 'it seems only a few  minutes since supper. And yet here we are, hungry again!'    'Ah!' said the parrot, 'that's what people always feel when they have to  get their meals themselves!'    When the camel and the dogs had been served with breakfast, the children  and the parrot sat down to eat. And there were many questions to ask.  The parrot answered some, and some it didn't answer.    'But there's one thing,' said Lucy, 'I do most awfully want to know.  About the Hippogriff. How did it get out of the book?'    'It's a long story,' said the parrot, 'so I'll tell it shortly. That's a  very good rule. Tell short stories longly and long stories shortly. Many  years ago, in repairing one of the buildings, the masons removed the  supports of one of the books which are part of the architecture. The  book fell. It fell open, and out came the Hippogriff. Then they saw  something struggling under the next page and lifted it, and out came a  megatherium. So they shut the book and built it into the wall again.'    'But how did the megawhatsitsname and the Hippogriff come to be the  proper size?'    'Ah! that's one of the eleven mysteries. Some sages suppose that the  country gave itself a sort of shake and everything settled down into  the size it ought to be. I think myself that it's the air. The moment  you breathe this enchanted air you become the right size. _You_ did, you  know.'    'But why did they shut the book?'    'It was a book of beasts. Who knows what might have come out next? A  tiger perhaps. And ravening for its prey as likely as not.'    'I see,' said Philip; 'and of course beasts weren't really _needed_,  because of there being all the Noah's Ark ones.'    'Yes,' said the parrot, 'so they shut the book.'    'But the weather came out of books?'    'That was another book, a poetry book. It had only one cover, so  everything that was on the last page got out naturally. We got a lot out  of that page, rain and sun and sky and clouds, mountains, gardens,  roses, lilies, flowers in general, \"Blossoms of delight\" they were  called in the book and trees and the sea, and the desert and silver and  iron--as much of all of them as anybody could possibly want. There are  no limits to poets' imaginations, you know.'    'I see,' said Lucy, and took a large bite of cake. 'And where did you  come from, Polly, dear?'    'I,' said the parrot modestly, 'came out of the same book as the  Hippogriff. We were on the same page. My wings entitled me to associate  with him, of course, but I have sometimes thought they just put me in as  a contrast. My smallness, his greatness; my red and green, his white.'    'I see,' said Lucy again, 'and please will you tell us----'    'Enough of this,' said the parrot; 'business before pleasure. You have  begun the day with the pleasures of my conversation. You will have to  work very hard to pay for this privilege.'    So they washed up the breakfast things in warm water obligingly provided  by the camel.    'And now,' said the parrot, 'we must pack up and go on our way to  destroy the fear of the Dwellers by the Sea.'    'I wonder,' Brenda said to Max in an undertone, 'I wonder whether it  wouldn't be best for dear little dogs to lose themselves? We could turn  up later, and be so _very_ glad to be found.'    'But why?' Max asked.    'I've noticed,' said Brenda, sidling up to him with eager  affectionateness, 'that wherever there's fear there's something to be  afraid of, even if it's only your fancy. It would be dreadful for dear  little dogs to be afraid, Max, wouldn't it? So undignified.'    'My dear,' said Max heavily, 'I could give seven noble reasons for being  faithful to our master. But I will only give you one. There is nothing  to eat in the desert, and nothing to drink.'    'You always were so noble, dearest,' said Brenda; 'so different from  poor little me. I've only my affectionate nature. I know I'm only a  silly little thing.'    So when the camel lurched forward and the parrot took wing, the dogs  followed closely.    'Dear faithful things,' said Lucy. 'Brenda! Max! Nice dogs!'    And the dogs politely responding, bounded enthusiastically.    The journey was not long. Quite soon they found a sort of ravine or  gully in the cliff, and a path that led through it. And then they were  on the beach, very pebbly with small stones, and there was the home of  the Dwellers by the Sea; and beyond it, broad and blue and beautiful,  the sea by which they dwelt.    The Dwelling seemed to be a sort of town of rounded buildings more like  lime-kilns than anything else, with arched doors leading to dark  insides. They were all built of tiny stones, such as lay on the beach.  Beyond the huts or houses towered the castle, a vast rough structure  with towers and arches and buttresses and bastions and glacis and  bridges and a great moat all round it.    'But I never built a city like that, did you?' Lucy asked as they drew  near.    'No,' Philip answered; 'at least--do you know, I do believe it's the  sand castle Helen and I built last summer at Dymchurch. And those huts  are the moulds I made of my pail--with the edges worn off, you know.'    Towards the castle the travellers advanced, the camel lurching like a  boat on a rough sea, and the dogs going with cat-like delicacy over the  stones. They skirted large pools and tall rocks seaweed covered. Along a  road broad enough for twelve chariots to have driven on it abreast,  slowly they came to the great gate of the castle. And as they got  nearer, they saw at every window heads leaning out; every battlement,  every terrace, was crowded with figures. And when they were quite near,  by throwing their heads very far back, so that their necks felt quite  stiff for quite a long time afterwards, the children could see that all  those people seemed quite young, and seemed to have very odd and  delightful clothes--just a garment from shoulder to knee made, as it  seemed, of dark fur.    [Illustration: Slowly they came to the great gate of the castle.]    'What lots of them there are,' said Philip; 'where did they come from?'    'Out of a book,' said the parrot; 'but the authorities were very prompt  that time. Only a line and a half got out.              'Happy troops             Of gentle islanders.    Those are the islanders.'    'Then why,' asked Philip naturally, 'aren't they on an island?'    'There's only one island, and no one is allowed on that except two  people who never go there. But the islanders are happy even if they  don't live on an island--always happy, except for the great fear.'    Here the travellers began to cross one of the bridges across the moat,  the bridge, in fact, which led to the biggest arch of all. It was a very  rough arch, like the entrance to a cave.    And from out its dark mouth came a little crowd of people.    'They're savages,' said Lucy, shrinking till she seemed only an extra  hump on the camel's back.    They were indeed of a dark complexion, sunburnt in fact, but their faces  were handsome and kindly. They waved friendly hands and smiled in the  most agreeable and welcoming way.    The tallest islander stepped out from the crowd. He was about as big as  Philip.    'They're not savages,' said Philip; 'don't be a donkey. They're just  children.'    'Hush!' said the parrot; 'the Lord High Islander is now about to begin  the state address of welcome!'    He was. And this was the address.    'How jolly of you to come. Do get down off that camel and come indoors  and have some grub. Jim, you might take that camel round to the stable  and rub him down a bit. You'd like to keep the dogs with you, of course.  And what about the parrot?'    'Thanks awfully,' Philip responded, and slid off the camel, followed by  Lucy; 'the parrot will make his own mind up--he always does.'    They all trooped into the hall of the castle which was more like a cave  than a hall and very dark, for the windows were little and high up. As  Lucy's eyes got used to the light she perceived that the clothes of the  islanders were not of skins but of seaweed.    'I asked you in,' said the Lord High Islander, a jolly-looking boy of  about Philip's age, 'out of politeness. But really it isn't dinner time,  and the meet is in half an hour. So, unless you're really hungry----?'    The children said 'Not at all!'    'You hunt, of course?' the Lord High Islander said; 'it's really the  only sport we get here, except fishing. Of course we play games and all  that. I do hope you won't be dull.'    'We came here on business,' the parrot remarked--and the happy islanders  crowded round to see him, remarking--'these are Philip and Lucy,  claimants to the Deliverership. They are doing their deeds, you know,'  the parrot ended.    Lucy whispered, 'It's really _Philip_ who is"]]]
