The  king conceived a violent attachment to the mother, but sought the  destruction of the son. Danae and her son left Seriphus and went to  Larissa. Danae built Ardea; and on its being burned, the inhabitants  said it was changed into a bird. Perseus, by the aid of Pluto's  invisible helmet, Minerva's buckler, and Mercury's wings (the  Talaria), and short dagger made of diamonds (called Herpe), deprived  Medusa, one of the Gorgons, of life, and carried off her head in  triumph. He killed the sea monster to which Andromeda was exposed, and  then married her. A memorable battle ensued at their nuptials.  Phineus, the uncle of Andromeda, who passionately loved her, entered  with a band of armed men, and attempted to carry her off by violence.  But Perseus made a brave resistance; and at last, finding himself on  the point of being overpowered, presented the Gorgon's head, which  instantly turned all his enemies to stone in the posture in which they  were then standing. Immediately after this he returned to Seriphus, in  time to protect his mother from the insult of Polydectes, to whom  Perseus showed the Gorgon's head, which converted him into stone also.  Medusa, it will be remembered, was the only one of the three Gorgons  who was mortal. Her sisters, Stheno and Euryale, were neither subject  to old age nor death. She greatly surpassed the other two in elegance  of figure and comeliness of face; but in nothing was her superiority  more remarkable than in the beauty of her locks. Minerva, provoked  either because her temple had been profaned, or because her personal  charms had been slighted by Medusa, who had preferred her own beauty  to that of the goddess, turned her fine hair, of which she boasted  greatly, into serpents, and gave to her eyes the power of converting  to stone all at whom she looked. The blood which fell from Medusa's  head when Perseus carried it over Africa in his flight, was supposed  to produce the numerous serpents which infest that country, and also  the winged horse Pegasus.    But to return to Acrisius. Let us see whether the prediction of the  Oracle, that foretold he would be put to death by his daughter's son,  was fulfilled. The fame of his grandson, after his remarkable  adventures, having reached the ears of Acrisius, he went to Larissa to  see him, at the time Teutamis was celebrating funereal games in honour  of his father. To this city Perseus had repaired with the view of  distinguishing himself among the combatants. Here he accidentally  killed, with a quoit, an old man, who was found to be his grandfather  Acrisius, and thus verified the oracular prediction.    Alcithoe and her sisters denied the divinity of Bacchus, and refused  to join in his worship. Whilst the Theban women were employed  celebrating the orgies of that god, the daughters of Minyas (for that  was their father's name) continued at their looms. To enliven their  hours of labour, one of them proposed that each in her turn should  relate some amusing tale, to which, the other sisters agreeing, she  with whom the idea originated was requested to begin. After hesitating  for some time which of her numerous collections would be most  agreeable--whether Babylonian Dercetis changed to a fish or her  daughter to a dove, or Naias, who by magic transformed young men to  fishes, or the tree the berries of which were formerly white, but  turned to purple by being stained with blood--she preferred the last  in consequence of its being little known. She then narrates the simple  but beautiful and affecting fable of Pyramus and Thisbe. Leuconoe  next, after mentioning the exposure of Mars and Venus, relates the  history of Leucothoe, with whom Apollo fell in love, and afterwards  turned into a rod of frankincense. To this she adds the fiction of  Clytie, whom the same god changed into a sunflower. Alcithoe being  then requested by her sisters to tell a story--despising as too common  the fables of Daphnis, a shepherd on Mount Ida, who, for violating his  marriage promise, was transformed to stone; of Scython, who changed  his sex; of Celemis, a nurse of Jupiter, converted to adamant; and of  the nymph Similax, and her lover Crocus, turned into flowers--prefers  the history of the fountain Salmacis, who conceived a violent  attachment for Hermaphroditus, the son of Mercury and Venus. These  sisters, having discontinued their narrating, remained still obstinate  in their contempt of Bacchus, who, in revenge, changed their  implements into vines and ivy, and themselves into bats.    Cadmus, a son of Agenor, king of Ph[oe]nicia, and Telephassa or  Agriope, was ordered by his father to go in search of his sister  Europa, whom Jupiter had carried away, and not to return unless he  found her. His search being unsuccessful, he is said to have consulted  the oracle of Apollo, by which he was commanded to build a city where  he saw a heifer standing on the grass, and call the country B[oe]otia.  Having found the heifer, he sent his men to a fountain for water,  which was at no great distance, that he might offer a sacrifice in  gratitude to the god. But the spring being sacred to Mars, a dragon  guarded it, which devoured all his men. By the art of Minerva, he  overcame the dragon, and sowed its teeth, which grew up armed men,  who, on his throwing a stone amongst them, began to fight, and all  were killed except five, who assisted him in building Thebes. Hence  Pentheus, in addressing the Thebans, calls them Anguigenae, serpent or  snake-descended. The ferocity of the petty tribes who inhabit that  part of Greece, and Cadmus's plan of subduing the natives by artfully  exciting them to fight against each other until the strength and  resources of the contending parties were quite exhausted,  satisfactorily explain the tale of the dragon, the armed men that  sprang from his teeth, and the stone which he threw among them. He  afterwards married Harmonia or Harmonie, the daughter of Mars and  Venus, by whom he had one son and four daughters. In advanced life,  oppressed with sorrow at the fate of his daughter Ino and her two  sons, he fled from Thebes to Illyricum, where he was changed into a  dragon.    Halcyone's husband, Ceyx, a king of Trachinia, was drowned while  attempting to cross to Claros to consult the Oracle. Disconsolate in  consequence of his departure, she incessantly implored the gods for  his safe return. Juno, moved by her constant prayers for her husband  after his death, and compassionating the violence of her sorrow,  entreated Somnus to send Morpheus, who, assuming the form and voice of  Ceyx, appeared in a dream, and informed her of his fate. Frantic with  grief, she ran to the beach, and, according to her dream, found the  body of Ceyx floating lifeless to the shore. The queen of Trachinia  was changed into a bird, in her attempt to reach by a bound the body  of her husband, which she no sooner touched than it underwent the same  transformation. Their mutual attachments remaining, they continue to  live together as birds, distinguished by the same tenderness and  affection which had marked their conjugal state when in the human  form.    Hercules was possessed of the greatest physical strength. He had a  great enemy in Hera, who, knowing that the child who should be born  that day was fated to rule over all the descendants of Perseus,  contrived to delay the birth of Hercules and hasten that of  Eurystheus. Eurystheus thus, by decree of fate, became chief of the  Perseidae. While yet in the cradle, Hercules showed his divine origin  by strangling two serpents sent by Hera to destroy him. In course of  time Eurystheus summoned Hercules to appear before him, and ordered  him to perform the labours which, by priority of birth, he was  empowered to impose on him. Hercules, unwilling to obey, went to  Delphi to consult the Oracle, and was informed that he must perform  ten labours imposed on him by Eurystheus, after which he should attain  to immortality. The first labour imposed on him was to destroy the  lion that haunted the forests of Nemea and Cleonae, and could not be  wounded by the arrows of a mortal. Hercules boldly attacked the lion  and strangled him. The second was to destroy the Learnaean hydra, which  he accomplished with the aid of Iolaus; but because he obtained  assistance in his work, Eurystheus refused to reckon it. Hercules's  third labour was to catch the hind of Diana, famous for its swiftness,  its golden horns, and brazen feet. The fourth was to bring alive to  Eurystheus a wild boar, which ravaged the neighbourhood of Erymanthus.  The fifth was to cleanse the stables of Augeas, king of Elis, where  three thousand oxen had been confined for many years; which task he  accomplished in one day, by turning the rivers Alpheus and Peneus  through the stables. For certain reasons this exploit was not counted.  His sixth was to destroy the carnivorous birds, with brazen wings,  beaks, and claws, which ravaged the country near the lake Stymphalis,  in Arcadia. The seventh was to bring alive to Peloponnesus a bull,  remarkable for its beauty and strength, which Poseidon had given to  Minos, king of Crete, in order that he might sacrifice it; which  Minos refusing to do, Poseidon made the bull mad, and it laid waste  the island. Hercules brought the bull on his shoulders to Eurystheus,  who set it at liberty. The eighth labour was to obtain the mares of  Diomedes, king of the Bistones, in Thrace, which fed upon human flesh.  The ninth was to bring the girdle of Hippolyta, queen of the Amazons.  The tenth was to kill the monster Geryon, and bring his herds to  Argos. These were all the labours originally imposed on Hercules; but  as Eurystheus acknowledged only eight of them, Hercules was commanded  to perform two more. The eleventh labour was to obtain the golden  apples from the garden of the Hesperides."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19946"],[0,"Villa Elsa (#20)"],[1,"pervades an atmosphere thick with the odors  of beer, sausage, cheese.    The Royal Court Ball opened the fashionable season every winter in  Dresden as proper in an orthodox monarchy. It was Kirtley's one  opportunity to view German royalty, in its intimacy of pumps and low  necks, at a ceremonious function in a whirl of music and the dance.  Naturally he wanted to be present with Elsa who was, of course,  competent in the art of Terpsichore. To say the least she was the  only young lady he knew well in Saxony, and to have her hair of ripe  corn color dancing in its luxuriance before his eyes to the  inspiring melodies of the opera bands would be something to thrill  him and his memories afterward. He would take a box and somehow  manage to moor Frau Bucher in its depths.    His hopes had sprung up about it for, luckily, Von Tielitz had gone  away and Jim, who had put the family in such a state of  intoxication, was to be in Prague and Warsaw for a month. It would  be a chance for the obscured Gard to emerge into the light and see  how Elsa was really affected by the Deming glamor. Of all her booby  family she had comported herself so far with a dutiful steadiness in  face of his dizzying _coup de main_. As for Von Tielitz and a  respectable young woman--how could there be anything serious ahead?    During Jim's trip Fraeulein plunged into her etching to make up for  absences. But Gard was pleased over the renewal of their piano duos  which had been abandoned after Deming's arrival. She very loyally  found a little time for this distraction, and so, as before, they  played through earnest stuff and tasseled it off with lighter  emotions in the form of \"Heart and Hand,\" \"Love's Dreams,\"  \"Affection True\"--good things with which to court a musical girl.  Her cordiality suddenly took on a frank warmness, as if she had come  back to an old friend. He saw that she felt more at home with him.  Wasn't she at last becoming like a \"pal\"? Yet sometimes the doubtful  impression assailed him that she was merely acting in a sort of  gratefulness for his having brought the stylish and princely James  Alexander Deming of Erie, Pay, to Villa Elsa.    Gard was quite happy when his invitation to the ball was accepted.  Both mother and daughter were most glad to go. He procured the box  and Frau Bucher, steeped in the practices of economy and judging  that his means were modest, pooh-pooed with material kindness at his  idea of an expensive motor car. He insisted on compromising by  ordering one at five in the morning for the return. It would be an  event and he wished to carry it off quite grandly for Elsa's sake.  She had never attended the Court Ball, it turned out, and, like all  maidens of Saxony, had always longed to go.    Accordingly due preparations were started by her mother and by her  in what had served, since Deming's arrival, as a kind of boudoir.  The gala affair was talked over with the usual noisiness in the  family. Anything that had to do with the King's household was  wonderful. The neighbors were exultantly apprised. Certainly the  Buchers were nowadays cutting a high figure--they to whom such  costly festivities had been unknown. No one had ever associated  Villa Elsa with the wand of prodigality, and its vulgar Americans  were dumfounding.    But, four days before the ball, Frau Bucher, in a constant condition  of agitation in her social upheaval, announced to Gard that she and  Fraeulein could not accompany him because a telegram had been  received from Friedrich. His sister at Meissen was coming for the  occasion and he took it for granted that the Buchers would complete  his company. Of course Friedrich and his sister could not be  disappointed. They were old friends--really a part of the family.  Gard, greatly disappointed, reclaimed his money for the box and  countermanded the order for the motor. It was provoking, yet such  things very reasonably happened.    The next morning another telegram from the always excited Von  Tielitz. Plans were changed. Sister did not think she would be able  to leave. Frau Bucher would much like to go with Gard. Elsa was so  anxious to dance at Court. It would be too bad to dash her  anticipations to the ground. Gard spent the day renewing the  arrangements. It was a pleasure to do so.    That evening a note couched in the spacious terms of formality was  handed in at his door by Tekla. Frau Bucher was extremely sorry, but  Friedrich and his sister had found they could come and were making  all preparations. Herr Kirtley's invitation must be declined again.    Beginning to be put out, he found that his box could not now be  returned. And he had no one to go with. It would be stupid to be  there without even an acquaintance. At last he thought of Anderson.  The latter announced his satisfaction at the prospect of \"seeing the  Germans jump around.\" Gard's dancing was cut off, which was  disappointing enough, yet he could at least see the spectacle.    The following morning, the day before the event, another wire, and  another cramped, stiff note through the diplomatic channels of the  kitchen reached the attic. More regrets, but the Von Tielitzes were  unable to carry out their plan. Would not Herr Kirtley kindly renew  his invitation? This stately despatching of communications, as with  a foreign power, went on side by side of and unseparated from the  usual daily informal intercourse of the family.    Gard's good nature wrestled with his balanced equilibrium and  overcame it along the lines of gallant generosity. It would be a  pity to deprive the ladies of what they had looked forward to,  although his own expectations were already marred. He would bemean  himself sufficiently to overlook Frau's caddishness. He went in town  to see if the change would suit his invited friend. Anderson bravely  rose to the occasion and accepted silently the duty of having to  tour the ball room now and then with his arm despairingly clasping  the rotundity of mother Bucher.    When Gard got back to Villa Elsa, another stilted letter with a new  programme was awaiting him. It had developed that the Von Tielitzes  could come, though the sister was slightly indisposed. It would be  nice for all to form a party, and Frau Bucher would be so pleased if  Herr Kirtley would have them joined in. But transportation to and  fro must be provided because of the sister. He had so kindly, at  first, spoken of a motor.    As Friedrich had admittedly no money, Gard saw that this was a  project--likely on the part of both--to saddle him with the whole  expense. The clumsy maneuvering had got down to bargaining. He was  mad. He sent the scullery courier back definitely withdrawing all  arrangements. The pleasure of his invited guest could not be  complicated. Result, the Von Tielitzes did not appear, mother and  daughter Bucher remained at home, and Kirtley went with Anderson.          CHAPTER XXIV    THE COURT BALL      The two sat the night out in the box. The reader is familiar with  Thackeray's amusing references to the stuffy German Court balls.  After his day and under the sway of the Empire, they had broadened  and aired out somewhat in their automaton grandeurs.    Precisely at nine o'clock the Saxon Court entered, so far as  possible in battle array, and unlimbered to a slight extent before  their revering subjects. No one knew of anything this Royal family  had ever said, commented Anderson. None of them had done anything  original or brilliant except Louise, who had run off with the tutor.  She could not stand the dullness here any longer. And the members of  this Court represented civilization raised to the famous _n_th  power!    How commonplace, uninspiring, they _did_ look to Kirtley! As Germans  can illy take on polish he thought he only beheld Rudolphs and  Teklas jammed into court dress. The disenchantment of a medieval  dynasty at near view!    After the midnight supper Anderson, refreshed, told of an  illuminating book he might write on Germany with journalistic  brevity and conciseness. It would run something like this:                      Chapter on Gentlemen and Ladies.             There are few gentlemen and ladies in Germany.                          Chapter on Manners.      There are no manners in Germany. Only orders and servility.                     Chapter on Charm and Delicacy.                        No specimens to be found.                 Chapter on the Milk of Human Kindness.             There is no milk of human kindness in Germany.                  Chapter on the Absence of Arrogance.              There is no absence of arrogance in Germany.    And so forth. What did Kirtley think of it?    The journalist jestingly identified the dignitaries, the men about  town, the titled ladies about whose bulbous red shoulders often hung  scandal, and retailed other gossip from his newspaper files. The  scene indeed scintillated with lights and diamonds and crystal. Two  orchestras answered each other in a continuous strain of conquering  music. Swords and spurs clanked and clattered through the riotous  German dances, adding their martial clangor to the regal sounds.  Trains were stepped on, dresses torn. The retiring rooms were often  sought for repairs. Now and again commotion was caused by some heavy  person tripping on her skirts and crashing to the floor. It was  Triumphant Germany celebrating her undisputed position and  pride--celebrating her mastery of the universe.    Gard really longed at moments to be actively throbbing with it all,  circling in the throng, and holding Elsa with her blond florescence  in his arms. Then a certain contentment would possess him as he  pictured her mother forced to stay home with blighted hankerings.  What a ridiculous appearance he would have presented towing her  around here in a waltz before all these florid and grandiose figures  of state!           *       *       *       *       *    Kirtley's disposition was somewhat slow-goin"]]]
