They are almost unknown to history, for aside from two or three short  accounts,[55] based mostly on hearsay, we find no mention of them. The  coast natives who knew them by name only had many stories concerning  their life and prowess, and one still hears that \"the Bila-an are of  small stature but agile like monkeys. One may wander for days through  their territory without encountering a person and then when in a bad  place suddenly see the little people in hundreds swarming down the sides  of impassable cliffs. They are always in such numbers that, while they  use only the bow and arrow, they are almost sure to exterminate the  intruders.\" As a matter of fact, the Bila-an compare in stature with the  coast natives and differ little from them in color, although a few  individuals of decidedly lighter cast are met with.    [55] BLAIR and ROBERTSON The Philippine Islands, Vol. XLIII, pp. 239,  282-283. Census of the Philippine Islands, 1905.    Observations were made on thirty-eight men, but no women could be  induced to submit to being measured. The maximum height of the men was  found to be 163.6 cm.; minimum 142.3 cm.; with an average of 154.7 cm.  The cephalic indices showed 87.8 cm. as the maximum; 74 cm. the minimum;  and 80.4 cm. the average. The greatest length-height index was 78.6 cm.;  the minimum 62.4 cm. and the average 69.7 cm. From these measurements it  appears that the Bila-an are somewhat shorter than the Bagobo; are more  short headed, the majority being brachycephalic; while the height from  tragus to vertex is about the same in both groups, and both have the  crown and back of the head strongly arched. The face[56] is absolutely  shorter and relatively broader than in the Bagobo. The forehead is  usually high and full, but in about one-third of the individuals  measured it was moderately retreating, while in the same proportion the  supra-orbital ridges were quite strongly marked. In other features, as  well as in hair form, eyes, body form and color, this people conform to  the description given of the Bagobo (Plates XLII-XLVIII).    [56] Measured from the chin to the hair of the forehead. The greater  part of this tribe live far back in the rugged mountains which form the  watershed between the Cotabato valley and the Gulf of Davao. Travel  through that district is entirely on foot, and is principally along the  water courses, so that in going from place to place a person is  continually crossing the stream. From time to time dim trails, scarcely  worthy of that name, lead from the river's bank almost perpendicularly  up the mountain-side or to the summits of high hills, where will be  found one or two frail houses (Plate XLIX). The dwellings are never in  large groups, and more frequently each house is by itself. From one  habitation it is possible to look across the hills and see many others  at no great distance, to reach which would necessitate a descent of  several hundred feet and an equal climb up to each.    There is considerable variation in the architecture of the dwellings but  the following description of the home of Datu Dialum, on the headwaters  of the Ma-al river, will give the general plan of all.    Small hardwood poles about twenty feet in length formed the uprights to  which the side and crossbeams were lashed, while in the center of each  end beam smaller sticks were tied to form the king posts. From the ridge  pole small timbers extended to the side beams, thus forming the  framework on which the final topping of flattened bamboo was laid. This  roof was of one pitch and at the sides overhung the walls by about a  foot. Twelve feet above the ground other poles were lashed to the  uprights and on these rested the cross timbers of the floor, which in  turn were covered with broad strips of bark. The side walls extended  between the floor and the beams, but in no place did they extend up to  the roof. Entrance to the dwelling was gained by a notched log.    Once inside the house the arrangement impressed one as being similar to  those of the Bagobo. Just above the door, and again in the far end of  the room, poles were laid across the beams to form the floors of lofts  which, in this case, were used as sleeping rooms.    In front of the door, at the opposite side of the room, was a bed of  ashes in which three stones were sunk to form the stove, and above this  was suspended a rack which contained cooking pots, drying wood, ears of  corn, and the like. Close to the stove were a few earthen pots (Fig. 35)  and many short bamboo tubes filled with water, while against the wall  hung rattan frames filled with half cocoanut-shell dishes, spoons, and  two or three old Chinese plates. Near the center of the room stood a  rice mortar made by hollowing out a section of log. At the far end of  the room was a raised sleeping platform, such as is found in all Bagobo  houses, and extending from this to the center and on each side of the  room were narrow stalls where the women were engaged in weaving, and in  which they slept and kept their most valued possessions.    FIG. 35. COOKING POT AND COVER.    In the description of the house we have mentioned most of the  furnishings. In addition it is customary to find a few well made mats of  _pandanus_ or _buri_ palm leaf. These are spread on the floor when the  owners wish to retire and for the rest of the time are rolled up and  laid along the walls. Carved forked sticks which serve as torch-holders  stand in various parts of the room, while somewhere near the stove is a  miscellany of wooden meat blocks, bamboo fans and fly swatters, gourds  filled with millet, salt, or mashed peppers, and shovel-shaped or round  rice winnowers, which also serve as common eating dishes for the family  and guests. Well made baskets stand by the walls or hang from pegs along  with articles of clothing, while spears, shields, and other weapons are  fastened to side walls or roof.    Small clearings are found at no great distance from these dwellings and  in them the people raise rice, corn, millet, camotes, sugar-cane, and a  few banana and hemp plants (Plate L). As is the case with all the wild  tribes in this district, the Bila-an make new clearings as soon as the  cogon grass begins to invade their fields, and this in time causes them  to move their homes from one locality to another.    The domestic animals consist of a few chickens, dogs, an occasional cat  and pig, and in the lower cogon lands, a few families possess horses.  Some fish are secured from the river, while deer, wild pig, jungle fowl,  and other game are taken with traps or secured by hunting.    There seems never to have been a time when this tribe was organized  under a single leader as was the case with the Bagobo. Each district is  so isolated from the others and the population so scattering that any  such development has been barred, and hence the people of each river  valley or highland plain have their local ruler. The power of this ruler  is real only so far as his personal influence can make it so. He  receives no pay for his services, but his position makes it possible for  him to secure the help of his fellows when he is in need of workers or  warriors. In return he conducts negotiations with other groups and  administers justice in accordance with the customs handed down from  bygone ages. Upon his death he is succeeded by his eldest son, unless  the old men of the group should consider him incompetent, in which case  they will determine upon the successor.    Warriors who have killed one or more persons[57] are known as _lEbE_  (Plate XLII), and are permitted to wear plain red suits decorated with  embroidery. Their duties and privileges are much the same as those of  the Bagobo _magani_.    [57] Said to be four among the Tagkogon.    A class known as _almo-os_ is composed mostly of middle-aged women who  are in close communication with the spirits and who, like the _mabalian_  of the Bagobo, conduct ceremonies to aid in the cure of the sick, to  secure good crops, or to thank the higher beings for their help and  watchfulness. Unlike the _mabalian_, these women are seldom midwives,  such duties being performed by a group called _fandita_.[58] Finally, we  learn that slaves are sometimes taken from neighboring tribes or even  from unfriendly settlements of their own people, to which class may be  added offenders against the laws of the group. Slavery, however, is not  very prevalent, for men are not greatly desired unless needed for a  sacrifice, while young girls and women soon become regular members of  their master's family.    [58] Probably a corruption of the Moro term _pandi'a_.    As has just been indicated a man may have as many wives as he can secure  by purchase or capture, provided they are not blood relations, but a new  wife cannot be added to the family until the one preceding has borne a  child.    Difficulties are generally settled between the parties concerned, but if  they carry their case to the ruler they must abide by his decision. A  thief is usually compelled to return the stolen property, but in at  least one case the culprit was sacrificed.[59]    [59] See p. 145.    Murder can be avenged by a murder so long as the trouble remains a  family affair, but if the case goes to the ruler it is probable that he  will levy a fine on the culprit. Unfaithfulness in a wife can be  punished by the death of one or both offenders if the husband exacts the  punishment, otherwise a fine is imposed.    The type of clothing worn by this tribe is practically identical with  that of the Bagobo, while the cloth from which it is made is procured by  a like process. However, in the ornamentation of these garments there is  wide variation. Beads are not used to any great extent, but in their  place are intricate embroidered designs which excel, both in beauty and  technique the work of any other wild tribe in the Islands, while on the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18274"],[0,"A Book of Natural History (#20)"],[1,"a single pole, which sags down a few inches from the flooring  it was intended to help support, are three of these structures,  marking the number of years the birds have nested there. The  foundation is of mud with a superstructure of moss, elaborately lined  with hair and feathers. Nothing can be more perfect and exquisite than  the interior of one of these nests, yet a new one is built every  season. Three broods, however, are frequently reared in it.    [Illustration: NEST OF PHOEBE.]    The pewees, as a class, are the best architects we have. The king-bird  builds a nest altogether admirable, using various soft cotton and  woollen substances, and sparing neither time nor material to make it  substantial and warm. The green-crested pewee builds its nest in many  instances wholly of the blossoms of the white-oak. The wood pewee  builds a neat, compact socket-shaped nest of moss and lichens on a  horizontal branch. There is never a loose end or shred about it. The  sitting bird is largely visible above the rim. She moves her head  freely about, and seems entirely at her ease,--a circumstance which I  have never observed in any other species. The nest of the  great-crested flycatcher is seldom free from snake skins, three or  four being sometimes woven into it.    About the thinnest, shallowest nest, for its situation, that can be  found is that of the turtle-dove. A few sticks and straws are  carelessly thrown together, hardly sufficient to prevent the eggs from  falling through or rolling off. The nest of the passenger pigeon is  equally hasty and insufficient, and the squabs often fall to the  ground and perish. The other extreme among our common birds is  furnished by the ferruginous thrush, which collects together a mass of  material that would fill a half-bushel measure; or by the fish-hawk,  which adds to and repairs its nest year after year, till the whole  would make a cart-load.    The rarest of all nests is that of the eagle, because the eagle is the  rarest of all birds. Indeed, so seldom is the eagle seen, that its  presence always seems accidental. It appears as if merely pausing on  the way, while bound for some distant unknown region. One September,  while a youth, I saw the ring-tailed eagle, an immense, dusky bird,  the sight of which filled me with awe. It lingered about the hills for  two days. Some young cattle, a two year-old colt, and half a dozen  sheep were at pasture on a high ridge that led up to the mountain,  and in plain view of the house. On the second day, this dusky monarch  was seen flying about above them. Presently he began to hover over  them, after the manner of a hawk watching for mice. He then with  extended legs let himself slowly down upon them, actually grappling  the backs of the young cattle, and frightening the creatures so that  they rushed about the field in great consternation; and finally, as he  grew bolder and more frequent in his descents, the whole herd broke  over the fence, and came tearing down to the house \"like mad.\" It did  not seem to be an assault with intent to kill, but was, perhaps, a  stratagem resorted to in order to separate the herd and expose the  lambs, which hugged the cattle very closely. When he occasionally  alighted upon the oaks that stood near, the branch _could_ be seen to  sway and bend beneath him. Finally, as a rifleman started out in  pursuit of him, he launched into the air, set his wings, and sailed  away southward. A few years afterward, in January, another eagle  passed through the same locality, alighting in a field near some dead  animal, but tarried briefly.    [Illustration: EAGLE.]    So much by way of identification. The bird is common to the northern  parts of both hemispheres, and places its eyrie on high, precipitous  rocks. A pair built on an inaccessible shelf of rock along the Hudson  for eight successive years. A squad of Revolutionary soldiers also  found a nest along this river, and had an adventure with the bird that  came near costing one of their number his life. His comrades let him  down by a rope to secure the eggs or young, when he was attacked by  the female eagle with such fury that he was obliged to defend himself  with his knife. In doing so, by a mis-stroke, he nearly severed the  rope that held him, and was drawn up by a single strand from his  perilous position. Audubon, from whom this anecdote is taken, figures  and describes this bird as the golden eagle, though I have little  doubt that Wilson was right, and that the golden eagle is a distinct  species.    The sea-eagle also builds on high rocks, according to Audubon, though  Wilson describes the nest of one which he saw near Great Egg Harbor,  in the top of a large yellow pine. It was a vast pile of sticks, sods,  sedge, grass, reeds, etc., five or six feet high by four broad, and  with little or no concavity. It had been used for many years, and he  was told that the eagles made it a sort of home or lodging-place in  all seasons. This agrees with the description which Audubon gives of  the nest of the bald eagle. There is evidently a little confusion on  both sides.    The eagle in all cases uses one nest, with more or less repair, for  several years. Many of our common birds do the same. The birds may be  divided, with respect to this and kindred points, into five general  classes. First, those that repair and appropriate the last year's  nest, as the wren, swallow, blue-bird, great-crested flycatcher, owls,  eagles, fish-hawk, and a few others. Secondly, those that build anew  each season, though frequently rearing more than one brood in the same  nest. Of these, the phoebe-bird is a well-known example. Thirdly, those  that build a new nest for each brood, which includes by far the  greatest number of species. Fourthly, a limited number that make no  nest of their own, but appropriate the abandoned nests of other birds.  Finally, those who use no nest at all, but deposit their eggs in the  sand, which is the case with a large number of aquatic fowls. Thus the  common gull breeds in vast numbers on the sand bars or sand islands  off the south coast of Long Island. A little dent is made in the sand,  the eggs are dropped, and the old birds go their way. In due time the  eggs are hatched by the warmth of the sun, and the little creatures  shift for themselves. In July countless numbers of them, of different  ages and sizes, swarm upon these sandy wastes. As the waves roll out,  they rush down the beach, picking up a kind of sea gluten, and then  hasten back to avoid the next breaker.    [Illustration]          BIRDS IN THEIR RELATION TO AGRICULTURE    (FROM THE PROCEEDINGS OF THE NEBRASKA ORNITHOLOGISTS' UNION JANUARY,  1901.)[4]    BY LAURENCE BRUNER.    [4] By permission.      [Illustration]    When civilized man takes possession of new regions and begins  cultivating the soil and establishes his sovereignty there, the  equilibrium as it existed upon his arrival is very quickly disturbed.  One or more of the many forms of life--plant and animal--that were  previously held within certain limits gain ascendency. The  introduction of new crops that furnish an abundance of the proper food  for some insect, enables this form to increase out of all proportions  and harm soon results. The killing off of certain other forms of life  that naturally keep still others in check also assists in disturbing  the equilibrium further. The cutting down and clearing away of forests  removes the shelter and homes of others, as does also the turning  under of prairie grasses. Then, too, many of the natural residents of  primeval forests and virgin prairies shun the sight of man, hence they  gradually withdraw from the region, and their influence for good or  evil goes with them. Since the majority of such forms are timid and  inoffensive creatures, their withdrawal only adds that much more to  the already overbalanced conditions. Year by year the gap which at  first was scarcely noticeable becomes widened, so that frequent  inroads are made and harm results. Instead of trying to ascertain the  true cause for all this trouble perhaps exactly the wrong thing is  done by the settlers. This of course only has the effect of further  widening the gap between safety and danger. Since an insect or other  animal becomes noticeably harmful only when present in alarming  numbers, it stands to reason that anything which favors such an  abnormal increase is a factor in disturbing nature and should be  quickly rectified where possible. In order that these disturbances  should be looked after the all-wise God of the universe created birds  and gave them the power of flight that they might the more readily  move about rapidly from place to place, where their services might be  needed in balancing affairs. Hence birds have naturally and rightfully  been called the \"balancers\" in nature. This being true, let us see  just what their relations are to agriculture.    The farmer sows in order that he may reap an increased measure of what  he has sown. In doing this he must first turn over the soil. This  destroys many existing plants as well as animals that depend upon them  for food. The plants thus turned down cannot regain their position  and must of necessity die. Not so with many of the animals, however,  which soon work their way to the surface. Some of these attack the  growing plants which have been made to occupy the place of those  destroyed by the plough. Others take wing and seek suitable food in  adjoining districts where they add to the numbers already drawing upon  the vegetation up to the point of possible continued supply. Here,  then, the scales begin to vibrate. In the field the new and tender  crop entices the ever-shifting individuals of myriads of forms that  have been crowded out elsewhere. The result here too is, or would be,  very disastrous were it not for the timely visit of flocks of birds  likewise in search of food.    It is during the period"]]]
