The principal occupation of the Sufi is to meditate on the unity, and so  to attain to spiritual perfection--unification with God.    9. Without the grace of God no one can attain to this unity; but God does  not refuse His aid to those who are in the right path.    The power of a Sheikh, a spiritual leader, is very great. The following  account of the admission of a Novice, called Tawakkul Beg, into an Order,  and of the severe tests applied, will be of some interest.[88] Tawakkul Beg  says:--\"Having been introduced by Akhund Moolla Muhammad to Sheikh Moolla  Shah, my heart, through frequent intercourse with him, was filled with such  a burning desire to arrive at a true knowledge of the mystical science that  I found no sleep by night, nor rest by day. When the initiation commenced,  {97} I passed the whole night without sleep, and repeated innumerable times  the Surat-ul-Ikhlas:--     \"Say: He is God alone:    God the eternal:    He begetteth not, and He is not begotten;    And there is none like unto Him.\" (Sura cxii.)    Whosoever repeats this Sura one hundred times can accomplish all his vows.  I desired that the Sheikh should bestow on me his love. No sooner had I  finished my task than the heart of the Sheikh became full of sympathy for  me. On the following night I was conducted to his presence. During the  whole of that night he concentrated his thoughts on me, whilst I gave  myself up to inward meditation. Three nights passed in this way. On the  fourth night the Sheikh said:--'Let Moolla Senghim and Salih Beg, who are  very susceptible to ecstatic emotions, apply their spiritual energies to  Tawakkul Beg.'    They did so, whilst I passed the whole night in meditation, with my face  turned toward Mecca. As the morning drew near, a little light came into my  mind, but I could not distinguish form or colour. After the morning  prayers, I was taken to the Sheikh who bade me inform him of my mental  state. I replied that I had seen a light with my inward eye. On hearing  this, the Sheikh became animated and said: 'Thy heart is dark, but the time  is come when I will show myself clearly to thee.' He then ordered me to sit  down in front of him, and to impress his features on my mind. Then having  blindfolded me, he ordered me to concentrate all my thoughts upon him. I  did so, and in an instant by the spiritual help of the Sheikh my heart  opened. He asked me what I saw. I said that I saw another Tawakkul Beg and  another Moolla Shah. The bandage was then removed, and I saw the Sheikh in  front of me. Again they covered my face, and again I saw him with my inward  eye. Astonished, I cried; 'O master! whether I look with my bodily eye, or  with my spiritual {98} sight, it is always you I see.' I then saw a  dazzling figure approach me. The Sheikh told me to say to the apparition,  'What is your name?' In my spirit I put the question, and the figure  answered to my heart: 'I am 'Abd-ul-Qadir Jilani, I have already aided  thee, thy heart is opened.' Much affected, I vowed that in honour of the  saint, I would repeat the whole Quran every Friday night.    Moolla Shah then said: 'The spiritual world has been shown to thee in all  its beauty.' I then rendered perfect obedience to the Sheikh. The following  day I saw the Prophet, the chief Companions, and legions of saints and  angels. After three months, I entered the cheerless region in which the  figures appeared no more. During the whole of this time, the Sheikh  continued to explain to me the mystery of the doctrine of the Unity and of  the knowledge of God; but as yet he did not show me the absolute reality.  It was not until a year had passed that I arrived at the true conception of  unity. Then in words such as these I told the Sheikh of my inspiration. 'I  look upon the body as only dust and water, I regard neither my heart nor my  soul, alas! that in separation from Thee (God) so much of my life has  passed. Thou wert I and I knew it not.' The Sheikh was delighted, and said  that the truth of the union with God was now clearly revealed to me. Then  addressing those who were present, he said: 'Tawakkul Beg learnt from me  the doctrine of the Unity, his inward eye has been opened, the spheres of  colours and of images have been shown to him. At length, he entered the  colourless region. He has now attained to the Unity, doubt and scepticism  henceforth have no power over him. No one sees the Unity with the outward  eye, till the inward eye gains strength and power.'\"    I cannot pass from this branch of the subject without making a few remarks  on Omar Khayyam, the great Astronomer-Poet of Persia. He is sometimes  confounded with the Sufis, for there is much in his poetry which is similar  {99} in tone to that of the Sufi writers. But his true position was that of  a sceptic. He wrote little, but what he has written will live. As an  astronomer he was a man of note. He died in the year 517 A.H. There are two  things which may have caused his scepticism. To a man of his intelligence  the hard and fast system of Islam was an intolerable burden. Then, his  scientific spirit had little sympathy with mysticism, the earnest  enthusiasts of which were too often followed by hollow impostors. It is  true, that there was much in the spirit of some of the better Sufis that  seemed to show a yearning for something higher than mere earthly good;  above all, there was the recognition of a Higher Power. But with all this  came spiritual pride, the world and its duties became a thing of evil, and  the religious and the secular life were completely divorced, to the ruin of  both. The Pantheism which soon pervaded the system left no room for man's  will to act, for his conscience to guide. So the moral law become a dead  letter. Irreligious men, to free themselves from the bondage and restraints  of law, assumed the religious life. \"Thus a movement, animated at first by  a high and lofty purpose, has degenerated into a fruitful source of ill.  The stream which ought to have expanded into a fertilising river has become  a vast swamp, exhaling vapours charged with disease and death.\"    Omar Khayyam saw through the unreality of all this. In vain does he try, by  an assumed air of gaiety, to hide from others the sadness which fills his  heart, as all that is bright is seen passing away into oblivion.      One moment in annihilation's waste,    One moment, of the well of life to taste--    The stars are setting and the Caravan    Starts for the dawn of nothing--oh, make haste!      Ah, fill the cup:--what boots it to repeat    How Time is slipping underneath our feet:    Unborn To-morrow, and dead Yesterday,    Why fret about them if To-day be sweet.    {100}    Omar held to the earthly and the material. For him there was no spiritual  world. Chance seemed to rule all the affairs of men. A pitiless destiny  shaped out the course of each human being.     \"'Tis all a chequer-board of nights and days    Where destiny with men for pieces plays:    Hither and thither moves, and mates, and slays,    And one by one back in the closet lays.      The moving finger writes; and, having writ,    Moves on: nor all thy piety nor wit    Shall lure it back to cancel half a line,    Nor all thy tears wash out a word of it.\"    Neither from earth nor heaven could he find any answer to his cry. With  sages and saints he discussed, and heard, \"great argument, but evermore  came out by the same door as in he went.\" He left the wise to talk, for one  thing alone was certain, and all else was lies,--\"the flower that once has  blown for ever dies.\" Leaving men he turned to nature, but it was all the  same.     \"Up from earth's centre through the seventh gate    I rose, and on the throne of Saturn sate,    And many knots unravell'd by the road;    But not the knot of human death and fate.      And that inverted bowl we call the sky,    Where under crawling coop'd we live and die,    Lift not thy hands to it for help--for it    Rolls impotently on as thou or I.\"    Omar has with justice been compared to Lucretius. Both were materialists,  both believed not in a future life. \"Lucretius built a system for himself  in his poem ... it has a professed practical aim--to explain the world's  self-acting machine to the polytheist, and to disabuse him of all spiritual  ideas.\" Omar builds up no system, he only shows forth his own doubts and  difficulties, \"he loves to balance antitheses of belief, and settle himself  in the equipoise of the sceptic.\" {101}    The fact that there is no hereafter gives Lucretius no pain, but Omar who,  if only his reason could let him, would believe, records his utter despair  in words of passionate bitterness. He is not glad that there is no help  anywhere.[89] And though he calls for the wine-cup, and listens to the  voice within the tavern cry,     \"Awake, my little ones, and fill the cup    Before Life's liquor in its cup be dry,\"    yet he also looks back to the time, when he consorted with those who  professed to know, and could say:     \"With them the seed of wisdom did I sow,    And with my own hand laboured it to grow.\"    The founder of the Wahhabi sect was Muhammad-ibn-Abd-ul-Wahhab, who was  born at a village in Nejd in the year 1691 A.D. The Wahhabis speak of  themselves as Muwahhid--Unitarians; but their opponents have given to them  the name of the father of the founder of their sect and call them Wahhabis.  Muhammad was a bright intelligent youth, of a strong constitution and  generous spirit. After going through a course of Arabic literature he  studied jurisprudence under a teacher of the Hanifi school. He then set out  in company with his father to perform the Hajj. At Madina he received  further instruction in the Law. He spent sometime at Ispahan in the society  of learned men. Full of {102} knowledge, he returned to his native village  of Ayina where "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20663"],[0,"The American Practical Brewer and Tanner (#20)"],[1,"it is expected the fermenting heat will rise  to 80, but in no case should it be suffered to exceed it; two pecks of  bean meal flour, with two pounds of bay salt mixed together, should be  evenly scattered over the surface of the tun, before cleansing, and  then well roused. After cleansing, this drink should be filled every  two hours, for the first twelve fillings, after which, twice a day will  be sufficient; and, in about a week after cleansing, porter so brewed,  and treated as here directed, will be glass fine, and in a week more  may be vatted. As porter is generally sent out in iron-bound hogsheads  of seventy gallons each, there should, at the time of going out, be  three half pints of finings, with as much heading mixed through the  finings at will go on a two shilling piece; this fining and heading  should be well stirred in the hogshead by means of a fining brush used  for the purpose, with a long iron handle; treated thus, porter will  fall fine in a few days. The faster draught porter is drawn off the  cask the better it will drink; for when too long, it is apt to get  flat, and sour.          _Porter Process._    No. II.          160 Bushels of Pale Malt.      120 Bushels of Brown Malt.      ---      280      ---      350 lb. of Hops.        Cleansed 121 Barrels of Porter.    Heat of the first mashing liquor one hundred and seventy-two, mash one  hour, stand one hour, run down smartly; second mashing liquor one  hundred and eighty, mash one hour, stand two hours, run down as before;  third mash one hundred and sixty-four, mash half an hour, stand half an  hour, run down smartly; boil the extract of the first, with half the  extract of the second mash; boil as hard as you can for one hour and a  quarter, then strike off, retaining your hops in the copper for your  second boil, which includes half your second wort, and the whole of  your third; these should be boiled for four hours as hard as you can  make them; pitch your first wort at seventy, or so high that, when in  the tun, it will make up at sixty-four, to which give six gallons of  smooth yest; pitch your second wort at sixty-five, giving seven gallons  more of yest; when all your worts are in your tun, it should make up at  sixty-four. Thus managed, it will be fit to cleanse in thirty-six or  forty hours; the closing and falling in of the head will direct the  period of performing this operation; fill, &c., as in the foregoing  process.          _Porter Process._    No. III.           88 Bushels of Pale Malt.      102 lb. of Hops.       12 Gallons of Essentia Bina, or sugar colouring.        Cleansed twenty-seven and a half Barrels of Porter.    First mashing liquor one hundred and sixty, mash one hour, stand one  hour; second mashing liquor one hundred and seventy, mash one hour,  stand one hour and three quarters; third mashing liquor one hundred and  seventy-five, mash half an hour, stand one hour; divide these three  runs into two equal parts, boil the first one hour, the second two  hours and a half, as hard as you can in both instances; pitch your  first wort at sixty, giving two gallons of solid yest; your second at  sixty-five, giving the same complement of yest; let your fermenting  heat rise to eighty, then cleanse, first topping your tun with two  pounds of bean meal flour, and half a pound of bay salt pounded and  mixed with the flour; fill fine, and head your porter casks, as already  directed to do with hogsheads; let your finings and heading be in that  proportion with lesser casks.          _Porter Malt._      This species of malt should be made from strong, well-bodied barley,  the process exactly the same as for pale malt, until it is about half  dried on the kiln; you then change your fuel under the kiln from coak  or coal to ash or beech wood, which should be split into small handy  billets, and a fierce, strong fire kept up, so as to complete the  drying and colouring in three hours, during which time it should be  frequently turned; when the colour is found sufficiently high, it may  be thrown off; the workmen should be provided with wooden shoes, to  protect their feet from the uncommon heat of the kiln in this last part  of the process, which requires the grain to snap again from the  excessive heat of the kiln. For the better performing this part of the  process, I would recommend a wire kiln to be placed adjoining the tiled  one, from which it may be cast on the wire; this would be a better and  more certain mode of conveying the porter flavour to the malt, than if  the drying was finished on the tiled kiln. Where a wire kiln was  thought too dear, a tiled one might be made to answer.          _Porter Colouring._      In modern language, is termed _essentia bina_. This is made from brown  sugar, and is now generally substituted by the London brewers for porter  malt, as more economical, and full as well calculated to answer all the  purposes of flavour and colouring. Muscovado, or raw sugar, with lime  water, are the usual ingredients of this colouring matter. Another kind,  of inferior quality, is prepared from molasses, boiled until it is  considerably darker, bitter, and of a thicker consistence; and when  judiciously made, at the close of the boiling, it is set on fire and  suffered to burn five or six minutes, then it is extinguished, and  cautiously diluted with water to the original consistence of treacle.  The burning or setting on fire gives it the greater part of its flavour,  which is an agreeable bitterness, and burns out the unassimilating oil.  Muscovado, or raw sugar, when treated in a similar manner, and diluted  to the same consistence before it sets, obtains a bitterness that more  nearly strikes the porter flavour on the palate; it is of a deep dark  colour, between black and red. To prepare it to advantage, take three  pounds, or three hundred weight of Muscovado sugar, for every two  pounds, or two hundred pounds, of essentia bina intended to be made, put  it into an iron boiler set in brick work, so that the flue for conveying  the smoke of the fire into the chimney, rises but about two thirds of  the height of the boiler in its passage to the chimney. The boiler  should have a socket or pivot in the centre of its bottom to receive the  spindle of wrought iron, with a crank in it, above the brim of the  boiler, the upper end of which turns on a corresponding pivot in an iron  bar fixed across several feet above the boiler, with a transverse iron  arm to reach from the crank for some feet over the boiler for a man to  stand, and turn it with its scraper of iron also, which works on the  bottom of the boiler to keep the sugar from burning on the bottom before  the upper part melts; this arm may be placed in a wooden handle at the  end, and held by the man, lest it become too hot for his hand. Put one  gallon of pure water into the boiler with every hundred weight of sugar  to be employed, that is, one pint to every fourteen pounds weight of  sugar, then add the sugar, light the fire, and keep it stirring until it  boils, regulating the fire so as not to suffer it to boil over; as it  begins to lessen in quantity, dip the end of the poker into it, to see  if it candies as it cools, and grows proportionably bitter to its  consistence; mark the height of the sugar in the boiler when it is all  melted, to assist in judging of its decrease; when the specimen taken  out candies, or sets hard pretty quickly, put out the fire under the  boiler, and set the vapour or smoke arising from the boiler on fire,  which will communicate to the boiling sugar, and let it burn for ten or  twelve minutes, then extinguish it with a cover ready provided for the  purpose, and faced with sheet iron, to be let down on the mouth of the  boiler with a chain or rope, so as exactly to close the boiler.    As soon as it is extinguished, cautiously add _strong lime water_ by a  little at a time, working the iron stirrer well all the time the water  is adding, so as to mix and dilute it all alike to the consistence of  treacle; before it sets in the boiler, which it would do, as the heat  declined, in a manner that would give a great deal of trouble to dilute  it after, and be imperfectly done then, it is easy to conceive this kind  of work requires to be done in an open place, or out-house, to prevent  accidents from fire. If the _essentia bina_ is neither burned too little  nor too much, it is a rich, high-flavoured, grateful bitter, that  preserves and gives an inimitable flavour and good face to porter; to  be added in proportion as the nature and composition of the grist is  varied with a greater or less proportion of pale malt. _To convert old  hock into brown stout_, it will take three pounds of _essentia bina_ of  middling or ordinary kind, and but two pounds of the best made from  Muscovado raw sugar as directed, it should weigh ten pounds to the  gallon. The _essentia bina_ should be mixed with some finings, and  roused into the tun soon after the yesty head gathers pretty strong, in  order to undergo the decomposing power of fermentation, part of it being  prone to float on the surface of the beer under the form of a flying  lee. When employed in the usual way of colour, with this precaution, the  colouring and preserving parts unite with the beer, and the gross charry  parts precipitate with the lees, and other feculencies in the tun,  previous to cleansing, adding a firm and keeping quality to the beer.  Lime water for diluting the burnt sugar, in the proportion of _essentia  bina_: thirty pounds of lime will make one puncheon, or one hundred and  twenty gallons of lime water: put fresh lime from the kiln, previously  slaked into coarse powder, into an airtight cask, gradually add the  water, stirring up the lime to expose a fresh surface to the solvent  powers of the water, which will rarely dissolve more than one ounce troy  weight in the gallon, or retain so much when kept ever so closely  excluded"]]]
