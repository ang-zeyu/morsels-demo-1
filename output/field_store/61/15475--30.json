A carotid artery runs forward to the head, and a  hypo-branchial artery supplies the ventral side of the pharyngeal  region. There are sub-clavian, coeliac, mesenteric, and pelvic  arteries, and the dorsal aorta is continued through the length of the  tail as the caudal artery (Cd.A.).      Section 7. A caudal vein (Cd.V.), bringing blood back from the tail,  splits behind the kidneys (K.), and forms the paired renal portal  veins (r.p.v.), breaking up into a capillary system in the renal organ. A  portal vein brings blood from the intestines to the liver.      Section 8. Instead of being tubular vessels, the chief veins of the  dog-fish are, in many cases, irregular baggy sinuses. Three main  venous trunks flow into the sinus venosus. In the median line from  behind comes the hepatic sinus (H.S.); and laterally, from a dorsal  direction, the Cuvierian sinuses (C.S.) enter it. These, as the student  will presently perceive, are the equivalents of the rabbit's superior  cavae. They receive, near their confluence with the sinus venosus, the  inferior jugular vein (I.J.V.). At their dorsal origin, they are formed by  the meeting of the anterior (A.C.S.) and posterior (P.C.S.) cardinal  sinuses. The anterior cardinal sinus -is, roughly, the equivalent of the  internal jugular vein-, lies along dorsal to the gill slits (g.s.), and  receives an orbital sinus from the eye. The posterior cardinal sinus  receives a sub-clavian vein (s.c.v.) and a lateral vein (L.V.), and fuses  posteriorly with its fellow in the middle line. This median fusion is a  departure from the normal fish type. It must not be confused with the  inferior cava, which is not found in the dog-fish, the [right] posterior  cardinals representing the rabbit's azygos vein. A simplified diagram of  the circulation of a fish is given in Figure 2, Sheet 16, and this should  be carefully compared with the corresponding small figure given of the  vascular system of our other types.       {Lines from Second Edition only.}     [The blood of the dog-fish resembles that of the frog.]      Section 9. The internal skeleton, as we have said, is entirely  cartilaginous, and only those parts which are pre-formed in cartilage in  the skeletons of the higher types are represented here. The spinal  column consists of two types of vertebrae, the trunk, bearing short,  distinct, horizontally-projecting ribs (r.), and the caudal. The  diagrams of Figure 5 [(Sheet 18)] are to illustrate the structure of the  centrum of a dog-fish vertebra; C is a side view, D a horizontal median  section, A and B are transverse sections at the points indicated by -B  and A- [A and B] respectively in Figure C. -(By an unfortunate slip of  the pen in the figure, A was substituted for B; section A corresponds  to line B, and vice versa.)- The vertebrae are hollowed out both  anteriorly and posteriorly (amphi-coelous), and a jelly-like notochord  runs through the entire length of the vertebral column, being  constricted at the centres of the centra, and dilated between them.  The neural arch above the centrum, and containing the spinal cord, is  made up of neural plates (n.p.), and interneural plates (i.n.p.),  completed above by a median neural spine (n.s.). In the caudal region,  instead of ribs projecting outwardly, there are haemal processes,  inclined downwards and meeting below, forming an arch, the haemal  arch, containing the caudal artery and vein-- the vein ventral to the  artery-- and resembling the neural arch, which contains the spinal  cord above, in shape and size.      Section 10. The pectoral limb and girdle (Figure 4, Sheet 16) have  only a very vague resemblance to the corresponding structures in the  rabbit. The girdle (g.) is a transverse bar lying ventral to the  pericardial wall, and sending up a portion (sc.), dorsal to the attachment  of the limb, which answers to the scapula and supra-scapula of the forms  above the fish. Three main cartilages, named respectively the  pro- (p.p.), meso- (m.p.), and meta-pterygium, form the base of the  limb. With these, smaller cartilaginous plates, rods, and nodules  articulate, and form a flattened skeletal support for the fin.      Section 11. The pelvic girdle and limb (Figure 2, Sheet 15) are  similar in structure, but the pro-pterygium and meso-pterygium are  absent, and the cartilage answering to the meta-pterygium goes by  the name of the basi-pterygium. In the male, but not in the female, the  pelvic fins are united behind the cloaca, and there are two stiff grooved  copulatory organs, the claspers (cl. in Figure 1), which have a  cartilaginous support (cl.c.). These claspers form the readiest means  of determining the sex of a specimen before dissection.      Section 12. The skull consists of a cartilaginous cranium, and of jaw  and visceral arches. The cranium persists throughout life, in what  closely resembles a transitory embryonic condition of the higher  types. There is a nasal capsule (na.c.), a brain case proper, and  lateral otic (auditory) capsules (ot.c.) containing the internal ear.  (This should be compared with the frog's embryonic skull.) The upper jaw  has a great bar of cartilage, the palato-pterygoid, as its sole support;  the arch of premaxilla, maxilla, jugal, and squamosal-- all membrane  bones-- is, of course, not represented. In the frog this bar of cartilage  is joined directly to the otic capsule by a quadrate portion, but this is  only doubtfully represented in the dog-fish by a nodule of cartilage in  the pre-spiracular ligament (p.s.). The lower jaw is supported, by  Meckel's cartilage (M.C.). The hyoid arch consists of two main  masses of cartilage, the hyomandibular (h.m.), and the ceratohyal  (c.h.); the former of these is tilted slightly forward, so that the gill  slit between it and the jaw arch is obliterated below, and the cartilage  comes to serve as the intermediary in the suspension of the jaw from  the otic mass. There are five branchia[l] arches, made up pharyngo-,  epi- and cerato-branchials, and the ventral elements fuse in the  middle line to form a common plate of cartilage. Outside these arches  are certain small cartilages, the extra branchials (ex.b.) which,  together with certain small labials by the nostrils and at the sides of  the gape, probably represent structures of considerably greater  importance in that still more primitive fish, the lamprey. The deep  groove figured lateral to the otic capsule is the connecting line of the  orbital and anterior cardinal sinuses; the outline of the anterior  cardinal sinus in this figure and in Figure 1 is roughly indicated by a  dotted line.      Section 13. Figure 3a is a rough diagram of the internal ear-- the only  auditory structure of our type (compare Rabbit, Sheet 7). To dissect  out the auditory labyrinth without injury is a difficult performance, but  its structure may be made out very satisfactorily by paring away  successive slices of the otic mass. Such a section is shown by  Figure 3b; through the translucent hyaline cartilage the utriculus and  horizontal canal can be darkly seen. The ductus endolymphaticus  (vide Rabbit) is indicated by a dotted line in our figure. It is situated  internal to the right-angle between the two vertical canals, and  reaches to the surface of the otic capsule.      Section 14. The brain shows the three primary vesicles much more  distinctly than do our higher types. The fore-brain has large laterally  separated olfactory lobes (rh.), there are relatively small  \"hemispheres\" (pr.c.), the stalk of the pineal gland tilts forward, and  the gland itself is much nearer the surface, being embedded in the  cartilage of the brain case, and the pituitary body is relatively very  large, and has lateral vascular lobes on either side. Following the  usual interpretation of the parts, we find optic lobes (op.l.) as the roof  of the mid-brain, and behind a very large, median, hollow,  tongue-shaped cerebellum (c.b.). The medulla is large, and certain  lateral restiform tracts (r.t.) therein, which also occur in the higher  types, are here exceptionally conspicuous.      Section 15. The dog-fish has ten pairs of cranial nerves,  corresponding to the anterior ten of the rabbit very closely, when we  allow for the modification the latter has suffered through the  conversion of some part of the spiracular cleft to an eardrum, and the  obliteration of the post-hyoid branchial slits.    The first and second nerves are really brain lobes, and nerves of the  special senses of smell and sight respectively.    The third (oculomotor), the fourth (patheticus), and the sixth  (abducens) are distributed to exactly the same muscles of the eyeball  as they are in the rabbit.    The fifth nerve, has, in the dog-fish, as in the rabbit, three chief  branches. V.2 and V.3 fork over the mouth just as they do in the  mammal; V.1 passes out of the cranium by a separate and more  dorsal opening, and runs along a groove along the dorsal internal wall  of the orbit, immediately beneath a similar branch of VII., which is not  distinct in the rabbit. The grooves are shown in the figure of the  cranium, Sheet 18; the joint nerve thus compounded of V. and VII. is  called the ophthalmic (oph.). It is distributed to the skin above the  nose and orbit. When the student commences to dissect the head of  a dog-fish he notices over the dorsal surface of the snout an exudation  of a yellowish jelly-like substance, and on removing the tough skin  over this region and over the centre of the skull he finds, lying beneath  it, a quantity of coiling simple tubuli full of such yellowish matter.  These tubuli open on the surface by small pores, and the nerves  terminate in hair-like extremities in their lining. These sense tubes  are peculiar to aquatic forms; allied structures are found over the head  and along a lateral line (see below) in the tadpole, but when the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21783"],[0,"A Manual of Pronunciation (#20)"],[1,"spheroid  spinach or spinage      39    spirit  splenetic  squalid  squalor  stalwart  stanch  status  stereopticon  stereoscope  stereotype  stolid  strategic  stratum  strew  strychnine  student      40    suave  suavity  subsidence  subtile (thin)  subtle (sly)  suffice  suite  superfluous  supple  survey _n._  survey _v._  suture  swath  sword  syllabic  synod  syringe  systole  tapis  tassel      41    taunt  tedious  telegraphy  temperament  tenacious  tenet  tepid  t[^e]te-à-t[^e]te  thyme  tiara  tiny  tirade  to  tomato  tortoise      42    towards  trachea  transparent  travel  traveler  traverse _n._, _a._, _v._  treble  tremor  tribune  trio  tripartite  troche  trochee  troth  truculent  truths  tuberose  turquoise      43    tuxedo  tyranny  ultimatum  umbilicus  umbrella  unprecedented  unwary  usurp  vaccinate  vaccine  vagary  valet  varioloid  vase  vehemence  vehement  venison  veratrine      44    verdigris  vermicelli  vignette  vindicatory  violin  virile  virulence  virulent  vis-a-vis  viscount  visor  vivacious  vizier  volatile  wainscot  warrior  wary      45    weapon  wont  wound  yew  yolk  youths  zenith  zodiacal  zoölogy  zymotic          GEOGRAPHICAL NAMES      47    Acapulco  Aconcagua  Adriatic  AEgean  Afghanistan  Albuquerque  Altai  Altamaha  Antarctic  Antilles  Appalachian  Aral  Ararat  Arctic  Arequipa  Argentina  Argentine  Aryan  Asia  Atoll  Avon  Azores  Bahia  Baikal  Balearic  Balkan  Barbados  Baton Rouge  Beaufort  Benares  Bengal  Ben-Nevis  Bering (strait)  Boer  Bogota  Boise (city)  Bolivar  Bolivia  Bombay  Bosporus  Brahmaputra  Brazos  Bucharest  Budapest  Buddha      48    Buenos Ayres  Butte  Cairo  Calais  Canton  Cape Breton  Caracas  Cardenas  Caribbean  Caucasian  Caucasus  Cavite  Cayenne  Cebu  Celebes  Ceylon  Chautauqua  Cheviot  Cheyenne  Chimborazo  Cienfuegos  Colorado  Costa Rica  Cracow  Des Moines  Dnieper  Dniester  Donegal  Dubuque  Dundee  Dwina  Edinburgh  Elbe  Elbruz  Elburz  Euphrates  European  Fezzan  Fiji  Filipino  Fiord or Fjord  Galveston  Garonne  Genoa  Ghent  Gila  Gloucester  Gobi  Granada  Greenwich  Guadalajara  Guam  Guatemala  Guayaquil  Guiana  Haiti or Hayti  Havre  Hawaii  Henlopen  Herculaneum      49    Himalaya  Hindustan  Houston (Tex.)
