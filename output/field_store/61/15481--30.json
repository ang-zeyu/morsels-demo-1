It is laid across the threshold of  a doorway on its back, and across its stomach is placed a stout plank  of _saj_-wood. Half a dozen men sit or stand on the ends of this, and  the fore and hind feet of the pig are pulled backwards and forwards  alternately over the plank until it is crushed to death, while all  the men sing or shout a sacrificial hymn. The head and feet are cut  off and offered to the deity, and the body is eaten. The forests are  believed to be haunted by spirits, and in certain localities _pats_  or shrines are erected in their honour, and occasional offerings are  made to them. The spirits of married persons are supposed to live in  streams, while trees afford a shelter to the souls of the unmarried,  who become _bhuts_ or malignant spirits after death. Nag Deo or the  cobra is supposed to live in an ant-hill, and offerings are made to  him there. Demoniacal possession is an article of faith, and a popular  remedy is to burn human hair mixed with chillies and pig's dung near  the person possessed, as the horrible smell thus produced will drive  away the spirit. Many and weird, Mr. Low writes, are the simples  which the Baiga's travelling scrip contains. Among these a dried bat  has the chief place; this the Baiga says he uses to charm his nets  with, that the prey may catch in them as the bat's claws catch in  whatever it touches. As an instance of the Baiga's pantheism it may  be mentioned that on one occasion when a train of the new Satpura  railway [93] had pulled up at a wayside forest station, a Baiga was  found offering a sacrifice to the engine. Like other superstitious  people they are great believers in omens. A single crow bathing in  a stream is a sign of death. A cock which crows in the night should  be instantly killed and thrown into the darkness, a custom which some  would be glad to see introduced into much more civilised centres. The  woodpecker and owl are birds of bad omen. The Baigas do not appear to  have any idea of a fresh birth, and one of their marriage songs says,  \"O girl, take your pleasure in going round the marriage-post once and  for all, for there is no second birth.\" The Baigas are generally the  priests of the Gonds, probably because being earlier residents of  the country they are considered to have a more intimate acquaintance  with the local deities. They have a wide knowledge of the medicinal  properties of jungle roots and herbs, and are often successful in  effecting cures when the regular native doctors have failed. Their  village priests have consequently a considerable reputation as skilled  sorcerers and persons conversant with the unseen world. A case is  known of a Brahman transferred to a jungle station, who immediately  after his arrival called in a Baiga priest and asked what forest gods  he should worship, and what other steps he should take to keep well  and escape calamity. Colonel Ward states that in his time Baigas were  commonly called in to give aid when a town or village was attacked  by cholera, and further that he had seen the greatest benefit to  result from their visit. For the people had so much confidence in  their powers and ceremonies that they lost half their fright at once,  and were consequently not so much predisposed to an attack of the  disease. On such an occasion the Baiga priest goes round the village  and pulls out a little straw from each house-roof, afterwards burning  the whole before the shrine of Khermata, the goddess of the village,  to whom he also offers a chicken for each homestead. If this remedy  fails goats are substituted for chickens, and lastly, as a forlorn  hope, pigs are tried, and, as a rule, do not fail, because by this  time the disease may be expected to have worked itself out. It is  suggested that the chicken represents a human victim from each house,  while the straw stands for the house itself, and the offering has  the common idea of a substituted victim.        7. Appearance and mode of life.      In stature the Baigas are a little taller than most other tribes,  and though they have a tendency to the flat nose of the Gonds,  their foreheads and the general shape of their heads are of a better  mould. Colonel Ward states that the members of the tribe inhabiting  the Maikal range in Mandla are a much finer race than those living  nearer the open country. [94] Their figures are very nearly perfect,  says Colonel Bloomfield, [95] and their wiry limbs, unburdened by  superfluous flesh, will carry them over very great distances and  over places inaccessible to most human beings, while their compact  bodies need no other nutriment than the scanty fare afforded by their  native forests. They are born hunters, hardy and active in the chase,  and exceedingly bold and courageous. In character they are naturally  simple, honest and truthful, and when their fear of a stranger has  been dissipated are most companionable folk. A small hut, 6 or 7 feet  high at the ridge, made of split bamboos and mud, with a neat veranda  in front thatched with leaves and grass, forms the Baiga's residence,  and if it is burnt down, or abandoned on a visitation of epidemic  disease, he can build another in the space of a day. A rough earthen  vessel to hold water, leaves for plates, gourds for drinking-vessels,  a piece of matting to sleep on, and a small axe, a sickle and a spear,  exhaust the inventory of the Baiga's furniture, and the money value  of the whole would not exceed a rupee. [96] The Baigas never live in  a village with other castes, but have their huts some distance away  from the village in the jungle. Unlike the other tribes also, the  Baiga prefers his house to stand alone and at some little distance  from those of his fellow-tribesmen. While nominally belonging to  the village near which they dwell, so separate and distinct are  they from the rest of people that in the famine of 1897 cases were  found of starving Baiga hamlets only a few hundred yards away from  the village proper in which ample relief was being given. On being  questioned as to why they had not caused the Baigas to be helped,  the other villagers said, 'We did not remember them'; and when the  Baigas were asked why they did not apply for relief, they said,  'We did not think it was meant for Baigas.'        8. Dress and food.      Their dress is of the most simple description, a small strip of rag  between the legs and another wisp for a head-covering sufficing for  the men, though the women are decently covered from their shoulders  to half-way between the thighs and knees. A Baiga may be known by his  scanty clothing and tangled hair, and his wife by the way in which  her single garment is arranged so as to provide a safe sitting-place  in it for her child. Baiga women have been seen at work in the field  transplanting rice with babies comfortably seated in their cloth,  one sometimes supported on either hip with their arms and legs out,  while the mother was stooping low, hour after hour, handling the rice  plants. A girl is tattooed on the forehead at the age of five, and over  her whole body before she is married, both for the sake of ornament and  because the practice is considered beneficial to the health. The Baigas  are usually without blankets or warm clothing, and in the cold season  they sleep round a wood fire kept burning or smouldering all night,  stray sparks from which may alight on their tough skins without being  felt. Mr. Lampard relates that on one occasion a number of Baiga men  were supplied by the Mission under his charge with large new cloths  to cover their bodies with and make them presentable on appearance in  church. On the second Sunday, however, they came with their cloths  burnt full of small holes; and they explained that the damage had  been done at night while they were sleeping round the fire.    A Baiga, Mr. Lampard continues, is speedily discerned in a forest  village bazar, and is the most interesting object in it. His almost  nude figure, wild, tangled hair innocent of such inventions as brush  or comb, lithe wiry limbs and jungly and uncivilised appearance,  mark him out at once. He generally brings a few mats or baskets which  he has made, or fruits, roots, honey, horns of animals, or other  jungle products which he has collected, for sale, and with the sum  obtained (a few pice or annas at the most) he proceeds to make his  weekly purchases, changing his pice into cowrie shells, of which he  receives eighty for each one. He buys tobacco, salt, chillies and  other sundries, besides as much of kodon, kutki, or perhaps rice, as  he can afford, always leaving a trifle to be expended at the liquor  shop before departing for home. The various purchases are tied up in  the corners of the bit of rag twisted round his head. Unlike pieces  of cloth known to civilisation, which usually have four corners,  the Baiga's headgear appears to be nothing but corners, and when the  shopping is done the strip of rag may have a dozen minute bundles  tied up in it.    In Baihar of Balaghat buying and selling are conducted on perhaps  the most minute scale known, and if a Baiga has one or two pice [97]  to lay out he will spend no inconsiderable time over it. Grain is  sold in small measures holding about four ounces called _baraiyas_,  but each of these has a layer of mud at the bottom of varying degrees  of thickness, so as to reduce its capacity. Before a purchase can be  made it must be settled by whose _baraiya_ the grain is to be measured,  and the seller and purchaser each refuse the other's as being unfair  to himself, until at length after discussion some neutral person's  _baraiya_ is selected as a compromise. Their food consists largely  of forest fruits and roots with a scanty allowance of rice or the  light millets, and they can go without nourishment for periods which  appear extraordinary to civilised "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22042"],[0,"Christmas: Its Origin and Associations (#20)"],[1,"were beheaded.    Edward, son of Richard Duke of York, was afterwards joined by his  cousin, Richard, Earl of Warwick, the famous \"kingmaker.\" They  hastened northwards and met the Lancastrians at Towton, where a  decisive battle was fought, and won by the Yorkists. Edward was then  recognised by Parliament and proclaimed king as Edward IV., and Henry  VI. was attainted of high treason.      IN 1461 EDWARD THE FOURTH    called his first Parliament at Westminster, and concluded the session  by the unusual but popular measure of a speech from the throne to the  Commons delivered by himself. It was during this session that the  statute was passed prohibiting the great and rich from giving or  wearing any liveries or signs of companionship, except while serving  under the king; from receiving or maintaining plunderers, robbers,  malefactors, or unlawful hunters; and from allowing dice and cards in  their houses beyond the twelve days of Christmas (Parl. Rolls, 488).    The Christmas festival was kept by Edward IV. with great magnificence,  the king's natural inclinations leading him to adopt whatever was  splendid and costly. \"At the Christmas festivities he appeared in a  variety of most costly dresses, of a form never seen before, which he  thought displayed his person to considerable advantage\" (_Croyland  Chronicler_). Sir Frederick Madden's narrative of the visit of the  Lord of Granthuse, Governor of Holland, to Edward, in 1472, paints in  glowing colours the luxury of the English Court. On his arrival at  Windsor he was received by Lord Hastings, who conducted him to the  chambers of the King and Queen. These apartments were richly hung with  cloth of gold arras. When he had spoken with the King, who presented  him to the Queen's Grace, the Lord Chamberlain, Hastings, was ordered  to conduct him to his chamber, where supper was ready for him. \"After  he had supped the King had him brought immediately to the Queen's own  chamber, where she and her ladies were playing at the marteaux [a  game played with small balls of different colours]; and some of her  ladies were playing at closheys [ninepins] of ivory, and dancing, and  some at divers other games: the which sight was full pleasant to them.  Also the King danced with my Lady Elizabeth, his eldest daughter. In  the morning when Matins was done, the King heard, in his own chapel,  Our Lady-Mass, which was most melodiously chaunted, the Lord Granthuse  being present. When the Mass was done, the King gave the said Lord  Granthuse a cup of gold, garnished with pearl. In the midst of the cup  was a great piece of unicorn's horn, to my estimation seven inches in  compass; and on the cover of the cup a great sapphire.\" After  breakfast the King came into the Quadrangle. \"My Lord Prince, also,  borne by his Chamberlain, called Master Vaughan, which bade the Lord  of Granthuse welcome. Then the King had him and all his company into  the little Park, where he made him have great sport; and there the  King made him ride on his own horse, on a right fair hobby, the which  the King gave him.\" The King's dinner was \"ordained\" in the Lodge,  Windsor Park. After dinner they hunted again, and the King showed his  guest his garden and vineyard of pleasure. Then \"the Queen did ordain  a great banquet in her own chamber, at which King Edward, her eldest  daughter the Lady Elisabeth, the Duchess of Exeter, the Lady Rivers,  and the Lord of Granthuse, all sat with her at one mess; and, at the  same table, sat the Duke of Buckingham, my Lady, his wife, with divers  other ladies, my Lord Hastings, Chamberlain to the King, my Lord  Berners, Chamberlain to the Queen, the son of Lord Granthuse, and  Master George Barthe, Secretary to the Duke of Burgundy, Louis Stacy,  Usher to the Duke of Burgundy, George Martigny, and also certain  nobles of the King's own court. There was a side table, at which sat a  great view (_show_) of ladies, all on the one side. Also, in the outer  chamber, sat the Queen's gentlewomen, all on one side. And on the  other side of the table, over against them, as many of the Lord  Granthuse's servants, as touching to the abundant welfare, like as it  is according to such a banquet. And when they had supped my Lady  Elizabeth, the King's eldest daughter, danced with the Duke of  Buckingham and divers other ladies also. Then about nine of the clock,  the King and the Queen, with her ladies and gentlewomen, brought the  said Lord of Granthuse to three chambers of plesance, all hanged with  white silk and linen cloth, and all the floors covered with carpets.  There was ordained a bed for himself of as good down as could be  gotten. The sheets of Rennes cloth and also fine fustians; the  counterpane, cloth of gold, furred with ermines. The tester and ceiler  also shining cloth of gold; the curtains of white sarcenet; as for his  head-suit and pillows, they were of the Queen's own ordonnance. In the  second chamber was likewise another state-bed, all white. Also, in the  same chamber, was made a couch with feather beds, and hanged with a  tent, knit like a net, and there was a cupboard. In the third chamber  was ordained a bayne (_bath_) or two, which were covered with tents of  white cloth. And, when the King and the Queen with all her ladies and  gentlemen had showed him these chambers, they turned again to their  own chambers, and left the said Lord Granthuse there, accompanied with  the Lord Chamberlain (Hastings), who undressed him, and they both went  together to the bath.--And when they had been in their baths as long  as was their pleasure, they had green ginger, divers syrups, comfits,  and ipocras, and then they went to bed. And in the morning he took his  cup with the King and Queen, and returned to Westminster again.\"    In 1465 Edward the Fourth and his Queen kept Christmas in the Abbey at  Coventry, and for six days (says _William Wyrcester_) \"the Duke of  Clarence dissembled there.\"    In 1478 the King celebrated the Christmas festival at Westminster with  great pomp, wearing his crown, feasting his nobles, and making  presents to his household; and in 1482-3 he kept a splendid Christmas  at Eltham, more than two thousand people being fed at his expense  every day. Edward almost entirely rebuilt Eltham Palace, of which the  hall was the noblest part. In that hall he kept the Christmas  festival, \"with bountiful hospitality for high and low, and abundance  of mirth and sport.\"    One of the continental visitors who participated in the royal  festivities of this period was Leo von Rozmital, brother of George,  King of Bohemia. His retinue included Tetzel, who, in describing the  Court of Edward the Fourth, after remarking upon Edward's own handsome  person, says, \"The king has the finest set of courtiers that a man may  find in Christendom. He invited my Lord Leo and all his noble  companions, and gave them a very costly feast, and also he gave to  each of them the medal of his order, to every knight a golden one, and  to every one who was not a knight a silver one; and he himself hung  them upon their necks. Another day the king called us to court. In the  morning the queen (Elizabeth Woodville) went from child-bed to church  with a splendid procession of many priests, bearing relics, and many  scholars, all singing, and carrying burning candles. Besides there was  a great company of women and maidens from the country and from London,  who were bidden to attend. There were also a great number of  trumpeters, pipers, and other players, with forty-two of the king's  singing men, who sang very sweetly. Also, there were four and twenty  heralds and pursuivants, and sixty lords and knights. Then came the  queen, led by two dukes, and with a canopy borne over her. Behind her  followed her mother and above sixty ladies and maidens. Having heard  the service sung, and kneeled down in the church, she returned with  the same procession to her palace. Here all who had taken part in the  procession were invited to a feast, and all sat down, the men and the  women, the clergy and the laity, each in his rank, filling four large  rooms. Also, the king invited my lord and all his noble attendants to  the table where he usually dined with his courtiers. And one of the  king's greatest lords must sit at the king's table upon the king's  stool, in the place of the king; and my lord sat at the same table  only two steps below him. Then all the honours which were due to the  king had to be paid to the lord who sat in his place, and also to my  lord; and it is incredible what ceremonies we observed there. While we  were eating, the king was making presents to all the trumpeters,  pipers, players, and heralds; to the last alone he gave four hundred  nobles, and every one, when he received his pay, came to the tables  and told aloud what the king had given him. When my lord had done  eating, he was conducted into a costly ornamented room, where the  queen was to dine, and there he was seated in a corner that he might  see all the expensive provisions. The queen sat down on a golden stool  alone at her table, and her mother and the queen's sister stood far  below her. And when the queen spoke to her mother or to the king's  sister, they kneeled down every time before her, and remained kneeling  until the queen drank water. And all her ladies and maids, and those  who waited upon her, even great lords, had to kneel while she was  eating, which continued three hours(!). After dinner there was  dancing, but the queen remained sitting upon her stool, and her mother  kneeled before her. The king's sister danced with two dukes, and the  beautiful dances and reverences performed before the queen--the like I  have never seen, nor such beautiful maidens. Among them were eight  duchesses, and above thirty countesses and others, all daughters of  great people. After the dance the king's singing men came in and sang.  When the king heard mass sung in his private chapel my lord was  "]]]
