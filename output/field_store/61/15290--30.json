It will be  hard work and a lot of it and I was hoping that perhaps you'd help  me with this.\"    The three faces lighted up.    \"Of course we will,\" Dicky said heartily.    \"Gee, I bet Dicky and I could make some great lanterns,\" Arthur said  reflectively.    \"And I'll help you fix up the store,\" Rosie said with enthusiasm. \"I  just love to make things look pretty.\"    \"It's a bargain then,\" Maida said. \"And now you must teach me how to  help you this very afternoon, Dicky.\"    They fell to work with a vim. At least three of them did. Rosie  continued to frisk with Delia and Tag on the floor. Dicky started  Maida on the caps first. He said that those were the easiest. And,  indeed she had very little trouble with anything until she came to  the boxes. She had to do her first box over and over again before it  would come right. But Dicky was very patient with her. He kept  telling her that she did better than most beginners or she would  have given it up. When she made her first good box, her face beamed  with satisfaction.    \"Do you mind if I take it home, Dicky?\" she asked. \"I'd like to show  it to my father when he comes. It's the first thing I ever made in  my life.\"    \"Of course,\" Dicky said.    \"Don't the other children ever try to copy your things?\" Maida  asked.    \"They try to,\" Arthur answered, \"but they never do so well as  Dicky.\"    \"You ought to see their nose-pinchers,\" Rosie laughed. \"They can't  stand up straight. And their boxes and steamships are the wobbliest  things.\"    \"I'm going to get all kinds of stuff for things we make for the  fair,\" Maida said reflectively. \"Gold and silver paper and colored  stars and pretty fancy pictures for trimmings. You see if you're  going to charge real money you must make them more beautiful than  those for which you only charged nails.\"    \"That's right,\" Dicky said. \"By George, that will be great! You go  ahead and buy whatever you think is right, Maida, and I'll pay you  for it from what we take in at the fair.\"    \"That's settled. What do you whittle, Arthur?\"    \"Oh, all kinds of things--things I made up myself and things I  learned how to do in sloyd in school. I make bread-boards and  rolling pins and shinny sticks and cats and little baskets out of  cherry-stones.\"    \"Jiminy crickets, he's forgetting the boats,\" Dicky burst in  enthusiastically. \"He makes the dandiest boats you ever saw in your  life.\"    Maida looked at Arthur in awe. \"I never heard anything like it! Can  you make anything for girls?\"    \"Made me a set of the darlingest dolls' furniture you ever saw in  your life,\" Rosie put in from the floor.    \"Say, did you get into any trouble last night?\" Arthur turned  suddenly to Rosie. \"I forgot to ask you.\"    \"Arthur and Rosie hooked jack yesterday, in all that rain,\" Dicky  explained to Maida. \"They knew a place where they could get a whole  lot of old iron and they were afraid if they waited, it would be  gone.\"    \"I should say I did,\" Rosie answered Arthur's question. \"Somebody  went and tattled to my mother. Of course, I was wet through to the  skin and that gave the whole thing away, anyway. I got the worst  scolding and mother sent me to bed without my supper. But I climbed  out the window and went over to see Maida. I don't mind! I hate  school and as long as I live I shall never go except when I want  to--never, never, never! I guess I'm not going to be shut up studying  when I'd rather be out in the open air. Wouldn't you hook jack if  you wanted to, Maida?\"    Maida did not reply for an instant. She hated to have Rosie ask this  question, point-blank for she did not want to answer it. If she said  exactly what she thought there might be trouble. And it seemed to  her that she would do almost anything rather than lose Rosie's  friendship. But Maida had been taught to believe that the truth is  the most precious thing in the world. And so she told the truth  after a while but it was with a great effort.    \"No, I wouldn't,\" she said.    \"Oh, that's all right for _you_ to say,\" Rosie said firing up. \"You  don't have to go to school. You live the easiest life that anybody  can--just sitting in a chair and tending shop all day. What do you  know about it, anyway?\"    Maida's lips quivered. \"It is true I don't go to school, Rosie,\" she  said. \"But it isn't because I don't want to. I'd give anything on  earth if I could go. I watch that line of children every morning and  afternoon of my life and wish and _wish_ and WISH I was in it. And  when the windows are opened and I hear the singing and reading, it  seems as if I just couldn't stand it.\"    \"Oh, well,\" Rosie's tone was still scornful. \"I don't believe, even  if you did go to school, that you'd ever do anything bad. You'd  never be anything but a fraid-cat and teacher's pet.\"    \"I guess I'd be so glad to be there, I'd do anything the teacher  asked,\" Maida said dejectedly. \"I do a lot of things that bother  Granny but I guess I never have been a very naughty girl. You can't  be very naughty with your leg all crooked under you.\" Maida's voice  had grown bitter. The children looked at her in amazement. \"But  what's the use of talking to you two,\" she went on. \"You could never  understand. I guess Dicky knows what I mean, though.\"    To their great surprise, Maida put her head down on the table and  cried.    For a moment the room was perfectly silent. The fire snapped and  Dicky went over to look at it. He stood with his back turned to the  other children but a suspicious snuffle came from his direction.  Arthur Duncan walked to the window and stood looking out. Rosie sat  still, her eyes downcast, her little white teeth biting her red  lips. Then suddenly she jumped to her feet, ran like a whirlwind to  Maida's side. She put her arms about the bowed figure.    \"Oh, do excuse me, Maida,\" she begged. \"I know I'm the worst girl in  the world. Everybody says so and I guess it's true. But I do love  you and I wouldn't have hurt your feelings for anything. I don't  believe you'd be a fraid-cat or teacher's pet--I truly don't. Please  excuse me.\"    Maida wiped her tears away. \"Of course I'll excuse you! But just the  same, Rosie, I hope you won't hook jack any more for someday you'll  be sorry.\"    \"I'm going to make some candy now,\" Rosie said, adroitly changing  the subject. \"I brought some molasses and butter and everything I  need.\" She began to bustle about the stove. Soon they were all  laughing again.    Maida had never pulled candy before and she thought it the most  enchanting fun in the world. It was hard to keep at work, though,  when it was such a temptation to stop and eat it. But she persevered  and succeeded in pulling hers whiter than anybody's. She laughed and  talked so busily that, when she started to put on her things, all  traces of tears had disappeared.    The rain had stopped. The puddle was of monster size after so long a  storm. They came out just in time to help Molly fish Tim out of the  water and to prevent Betsy from giving a stray kitten a bath.  Following Rosie and Arthur, Maida waded through it from one end to  the other--it seemed the most perilous of adventures to her.    After that meeting, the W.M.N.T.'s were busier than they had ever  been. Every other afternoon, and always when it was bad weather,  they worked at Maida's house. Granny gave Maida a closet all to  herself and as fast as the things were finished they were put in  boxes and stowed away on its capacious shelves.    Arthur whittled and carved industriously. His work went slower than  Dicky's of course but, still, it went with remarkable quickness.  Maida often stopped her own work on the paper things to watch  Arthur's. It was a constant marvel to her that such big,  awkward-looking hands could perform feats of such delicacy. Her  own fingers, small and delicate as they were, bungled surprisingly  at times.    \"And as for the paste,\" Maida said in disgust to Rosie one day,  \"you'd think that I fell into the paste-pot every day. I wash it off  my hands and face. I pick it off of my clothes and sometimes Granny  combs it out of my hair.\"    Often after dinner, the W.M.N.T.'s would call in a body on Maida.  Then would follow long hours of such fun that Maida hated to hear  the clock strike nine. Always there would be molasses-candy making  by the capable Rosie at the kitchen stove and corn-popping by the  vigorous Arthur on the living-room hearth. After the candy had  cooled and the pop corn had been flooded in melted butter, they  would gather about the hearth to roast apples and chestnuts and to  listen to the fairy-tales that Maida would read.    The one thing which she could do and they could not was to read with  the ease and expression of a grown person. As many of her books were  in French as in English and it was the wonder of the other  W.M.N.T.'s that she could read a French story, translating as she  went. Her books were a delight to Arthur and Dicky and she lent them  freely. Rosie liked to listen to stories but she did not care to  read.    Maida was very happy nowadays. Laura was the only person in the  Court who had caused her any uneasiness. Since the day that Laura  had made herself so disagreeable, Maida had avoided her steadily.  Best of all, perhaps, Maida's health had improved so much that even  her limp was slowly disappearing.    In the course of time, the children taught Maida the secret language  of the W.M.N.T.'s. They could hold long conversations that were  unintelligible to anybody else. When at first they used it in fun  before Maida, she could not understand a word. After they had  explained it to her, she wondered that she had ever been puzzled.    \"It's as easy as anything,\" Rosy said. \"You take off the first sound  of a word and put it on the end with an _ay_ added to it like  MAN--an-may. BOY--oy-bay. GIRL--irl-gay. When a word is just one sound  like I or O, or when it begins with a vowel like"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17546"],[0,"The Lion of Saint Mark: A Story of Venice in the Fourteenth Century (#20)"],[1,"thing, explaining my absence; and I told him, when we  left your house, to go at once to tell him that your daughters had been  recovered, and that I should return before long. Still, he will want to  hear from me as to the events of the night.\"    \"Will you also tell him, Francisco, that I will call upon him this  afternoon. I have much to say to him.\"    \"I am glad Signor Polani is coming,\" Mr. Hammond said, when his son  gave him the message. \"I am quite resolved that you shall quit Venice  at once. I do not wish to blame you for what you have done, which,  indeed, is likely to have a favourable effect upon your fortunes; but  that, at your age, you have mixed yourself up in adventures of this  kind, taken part in the affairs of great houses, and drawn upon  yourself the enmity of one of the most powerful families of Venice, is  altogether strange and improper for a lad of your years, and belonging  to the family of a quiet trader. I have been thinking about it all this  morning, and am quite resolved that the sooner you are out of Venice  the better. If I saw any way of sending you off before nightfall I  would do so.    \"Signor Polani has, you say, so far concealed from the council the fact  that you have been mixed up in this business; but there is no saying  how soon it may come out. You know that Venice swarms with spies, and  these are likely, before many hours, to learn the fact of your midnight  arrival at Polani's house; and as no orders were given for the  preparation of this expedition to the island before that time, it will  not need much penetration to conclude that you were the bearer of the  news that led to the discovery of the maidens. Besides which, you  accompanied the expedition, and acted as its guide to the hut. Part of  this they will learn from the servants of the house, part of it they  may get out from the sailors, who, over their wine cups, are not given  to reticence. The council may not have pressed Polani on this point,  but, take my word for it, some of them, at least, will endeavour to get  to the bottom of it, especially Mocenigo's connections, who will  naturally be alarmed at the thought that there is somewhere a traitor  among their own ranks.    \"The affair has become very serious, Francis, and far beyond the  compass of a boyish scrape, and no time must be lost in getting you out  of Venice. I have no doubt Polani will see the matter in the same  light, for he knows the ways of his countrymen even better than I do.\"    The interview between the two traders was a long one. At its conclusion  Francis was sent for.    \"Francis,\" his father said, \"Signor Polani has had the kindness to make  me offers of a most generous nature.\"    \"Not at all, Messer Hammond,\" the Venetian interrupted. \"Let there be  no mistake upon that score. Your son has rendered me services  impossible for me ever to repay adequately. He has laid me under an  obligation greater than I can ever discharge. At the same time,  fortunately, I am in a position to be able to further his interests in  life.    \"I have proposed, Francisco, that you shall enter my house at once. You  will, of course, for some years learn the business, but you will do so  in the position which a son of mine would occupy, and when you come of  age, you will take your place as a partner with me.    \"Your father will return to England. He informs me that he is now  longing to return to his own country, and has for some time been  thinking of doing so. I have proposed to him that he shall act as my  agent there. Hitherto I have not traded direct with England; in future  I shall do so largely. Your father has explained to me somewhat of his  transactions, and I see there is good profit to be made on trade with  London, by a merchant who has the advantage of the advice and  assistance of one, like your father, thoroughly conversant in the  trade. Thus, I hope that the arrangement will be largely to our mutual  advantage. As to yourself, you will probably be reluctant to establish  yourself for life in this country; but there is no reason why, in time,  when your father wishes to retire from business, you should not  establish yourself in London, in charge of the English branch of our  house.\"    \"I am most grateful to you for your offer, signor, which is vastly  beyond anything that my ambition could ever have aspired to. I can only  say that I will try my best to do justice to your kindness to me.\"    \"I have no fear as to that, Francisco,\" the merchant said. \"You have  shown so much thoughtfulness, in this business, that I shall have no  fear of entrusting even weighty affairs of business in your hands; and  you must remember always that I shall still consider myself your  debtor. I thoroughly agree with your father's views as to the necessity  for your leaving Venice, as soon as possible. In a few months this  matter will have blown over, the angry feelings excited will calm down,  and you will then be able to come and go in safety; but at present you  were best out of the town, and I have, therefore, arranged with your  father that you shall embark tonight on board the Bonito, which sails  tomorrow. You will have much to say to your father now, but I hope you  will find time to come round, and say goodbye to my daughters, this  evening.\"    \"Your adventures, Francis,\" Mr. Hammond said when the merchant had left  them, \"have turned out fortunate, indeed. You have an opening now  beyond anything we could have hoped for. Signor Polani has expressed  himself most warmly. He told me that I need concern myself no further  with your future, for that would now be his affair. The arrangement  that he has made with me, will enable me to hold my head as high as any  in the City, for it will give me almost a monopoly of the Venetian  trade; and although he said that he had long been thinking of entering  into trade direct with England, there is no doubt that it is his  feeling towards you, which has influenced him now in the matter.    \"My business here has more than answered my expectations, in one  respect, but has fallen short in another. I have bought cheaply, and  the business should have been a very profitable one; but my partner in  London is either not acting fairly by me, or he is mismanaging matters  altogether. This offer, then, of Signor Polani is in every respect  acceptable. I shall give up my own business and start anew, and  selling, as I shall, on commission, shall run no risk, while the  profits will be far larger than I could myself make, for Polani will  carry it on on a great scale.    \"As for you, you will soon learn the ways of trade, and will be able to  come home and join me, and eventually succeed me in the business.    \"No fairer prospect could well open to a young man, and if you show  yourself as keen in business, as you have been energetic in the  pursuits you have adopted, assuredly a great future is open to you, and  you may look to be one of the greatest merchants in the city of London.  I know not yet what offers Polani may make you here, but I hope that  you will not settle in Venice permanently, but will always remember  that you are an Englishman, and the son of a London citizen, and that  you will never lose your love for your native land.    \"And yet, do not hurry home for my sake. Your two brothers will soon  have finished their schooling, and will, of course, be apprenticed to  me as soon as I return; and if, as I hope, they turn out steady and  industrious; they will, by the time they come to man's estate, be of  great assistance to me in the business.    \"And now, you will be wanting to say goodbye to your friends. Be  careful this last evening, for it is just when you are thinking most of  other matters, that sudden misfortune is likely to come upon you.\"    Delighted with his good fortune--rather because it opened up a life of  activity, instead of the confinement to business that he had dreaded,  than for the pecuniary advantages it offered--Francis ran downstairs  and, leaping into his father's gondola, told Beppo to take him to the  Palazzo Giustiniani. On the way he told Beppo and his son that the next  day he was leaving Venice, and was going to enter the service of Signor  Polani.    Giuseppi ceased rowing, and, throwing himself down at the bottom of the  gondola, began to sob violently, with the abandonment to his emotions  common to his race. Then he suddenly sat up.    \"If you are going, I will go too, Messer Francisco. You will want a  servant who will be faithful to you. I will ask the padrone to let me  go with you.    \"You will let me go, will you not, father? I cannot leave our young  master, and should pine away, were I obliged to stop here to work a  gondola; while he may be wanting my help, for Messer Francisco is sure  to get into adventures and dangers. Has he not done it here in Venice?  and is he not sure to do it at sea, where there are Genoese and  pirates, and perils of all kinds?    \"You will take me with you, will you not, Messer Francisco? You will  never be so hard hearted as to go away and leave me behind?\"    \"I shall be very glad to have you with me, Giuseppi, if your father  will give you leave to go. I am quite sure that Signor Polani will make  no objection. In the first place, he would do it to oblige me, and in  the second, I know that it is his intention to do something to your  advantage. He has spoken to me about it several times, for you had your  share of the danger when we first rescued his daughters, and again when  we were chased by that four-oared gondola. He has been too busy with  the search for his daughters to give the matter his attention, but I  know that he is conscious of his obligation to you, and that he intends  to reward you largely. Therefore, I am sure that he will offer no  objection to your accompanying me.    \"What do you say, Beppo?\"    \"I do not like to stand in the way of the lad's wishes, Messer  Francisco; but, you see, he"]]]
