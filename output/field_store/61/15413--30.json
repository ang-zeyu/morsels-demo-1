The antheridial branches are often  bright-colored, red or yellow, so as to be very conspicuous. The  capsules, which are not often found, are larger than in most of the  common mosses, and quite destitute of a stalk, the apparent stalk  being a prolongation of the axis of the plant in the top of which the  base of the sporogonium is imbedded. The capsule is nearly globular,  opening by a lid at the top (Fig. 64, _B_).      A microscopical examination of the leaves, which are quite destitute    of a midrib, shows them to be composed of a network of narrow    chlorophyll-bearing cells surrounding much larger empty ones whose    walls are marked with transverse thickenings, and perforated here    and there with large, round holes (Fig. 64, _C_). It is to the    presence of these empty cells that the plant owes its peculiar    spongy texture, the growing plants being fairly saturated with    water.    The _Andreaeaceae_ are very small, and not at all common. The capsule  splits into four valves, something like a liverwort.    The _Phascaceae_ are small mosses growing on the ground or low down on  the trunks of trees, etc. They differ principally from the common  mosses in having the capsule open irregularly and not by a lid. The  commonest forms belong to the genus _Phascum_ (Fig. 65, _A_).    The vast majority of the mosses the student is likely to meet with  belong to the last order, and agree in the main with the one  described. Some of the commoner forms are shown in Figure 65.          CHAPTER XII.    SUB-KINGDOM V.    PTERIDOPHYTES.      If we compare the structure of the sporogonium of a moss or liverwort  with the plant bearing the sexual organs, we find that its tissues are  better differentiated, and that it is on the whole a more complex  structure than the plant that bears it. It, however, remains attached  to the parent plant, deriving its nourishment in part through the  \"foot\" by means of which it is attached to the plant.    In the Pteridophytes, however, we find that the sporogonium becomes  very much more developed, and finally becomes entirely detached from  the sexual plant, developing in most cases roots that fasten it to the  ground, after which it may live for many years, and reach a very large  size.    The sexual plant, which is here called the \"prothallium,\" is of very  simple structure, resembling the lower liverworts usually, and never  reaches more than about a centimetre in diameter, and is often much  smaller than this.    The common ferns are the types of the sub-kingdom, and a careful study  of any of these will illustrate the principal peculiarities of the  group. The whole plant, as we know it, is really nothing but the  sporogonium, originating from the egg cell in exactly the same way as  the moss sporogonium, and like it gives rise to spores which are  formed upon the leaves.    The spores may be collected by placing the spore-bearing leaves on  sheets of paper and letting them dry, when the ripe spores will be  discharged covering the paper as a fine, brown powder. If these are  sown on fine, rather closely packed earth, and kept moist and covered  with glass so as to prevent evaporation, within a week or two a fine,  green, moss-like growth will make its appearance, and by the end of  five or six weeks, if the weather is warm, little, flat, heart-shaped  plants of a dark-green color may be seen. These look like small  liverworts, and are the sexual plants (prothallia) of our ferns  (Fig. 66, _F_). Removing one of these carefully, we find on the lower  side numerous fine hairs like those on the lower surface of the  liverworts, which fasten it firmly to the ground. By and by, if our  culture has been successful, we may find attached to some of the  larger of these, little fern plants growing from the under side of the  prothallia, and attached to the ground by a delicate root. As the  little plant becomes larger the prothallium dies, leaving it attached  to the ground as an independent plant, which after a time bears the  spores.

Especially favorable for this purpose are the spores of the  ostrich fern (_Onoclea struthiopteris_) (Fig. 70, _I_, _J_), or the  sensitive fern (_O. sensibilis_). Another common and readily grown  species is the lady fern (_Asplenium filixfoemina_) (Fig. 70, _H_). The  spores of most ferns retain their vitality for many months, and hence  can be kept dry until wanted.      The first stages of germination may be readily seen by sowing the    spores in water, where, under favorable circumstances, they will    begin to grow within three or four days. The outer, dry, brown coat    of the spore is first ruptured, and often completely thrown off by    the swelling of the spore contents. Below this is a second colorless    membrane which is also ruptured, but remains attached to the spore.    Through the orifice in the second coat, the inner delicate membrane    protrudes in the form of a nearly colorless papilla which rapidly    elongates and becomes separated from the body of the spore by a    partition, constituting the first root hair (Fig. 66, _B_, _C_,    _r_). The body of the spore containing most of the chlorophyll    elongates more slowly, and divides by a series of transverse walls    so as to form a short row of cells, resembling in structure some of    the simpler algae (_C_).      In order to follow the development further, spores must be sown upon    earth, as they do not develop normally in water beyond this stage.      In studying plants grown on earth, they should be carefully removed    and washed in a drop of water so as to remove, as far as possible,    any adherent particles, and then may be mounted in water for    microscopic examination.      In most cases, after three or four cross-walls are formed, two walls    arise in the end cell so inclined as to enclose a wedge-shaped cell    (_a_) from which are cut off two series of segments by walls    directed alternately right and left (Fig. 66, _D_, _E_, _a_), the    apical cell growing to its original dimensions after each pair of    segments is cut off. The segments divide by vertical walls in    various directions so that the young plant rapidly assumes the form    of a flat plate of cells attached to the ground by root hairs    developed from the lower surfaces of the cells, and sometimes from    the marginal ones. As the division walls are all vertical, the plant    is nowhere more than one cell thick. The marginal cells of the young    segments divide more rapidly than the inner ones, and soon project    beyond the apical cell which thus comes to lie at the bottom of a    cleft in the front of the plant which in consequence becomes    heart-shaped (_E_, _F_). Sooner or later the apical cell ceases to    form regular segments and becomes indistinguishable from the other    cells.      In the ostrich fern and lady fern the plants are dioecious. The male    plants (Fig. 66, _J_) are very small, often barely visible to the    naked eye, and when growing thickly form dense, moss-like patches.    They are variable in form, some irregularly shaped, others simple    rows of cells, and some have the heart shape of the larger plants.    The female plants (Fig. 66, _F_) are always comparatively large and  regularly heart-shaped, occasionally reaching a diameter of nearly or  quite one centimetre, so that they are easily recognizable without  microscopical examination.      All the cells of the plant except the root hairs contain large and    distinct chloroplasts much like those in the leaves of the moss, and    like them usually to be found in process of division.      The archegonia arise from cells of the lower surface, just behind    the notch in front (Fig. 66, _F_, _ar._). Previous to their    formation the cells at this point divide by walls parallel to the    surface of the plant, so as to form several layers of cells, and    from the lowest layer of cells the archegonia arise. They resemble    those of the liverworts but are shorter, and the lower part is    completely sunk within the tissues of the plant (Fig. 66, _G_, _I_).    They arise as single surface cells, this first dividing into three    by walls parallel to the outer surface. The lower cell undergoes one    or two divisions, but undergoes no further change; the second cell    (_C"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2040"],[0,"Confessions of an English Opium-Eater (#20)"],[1," bring to the task greater energy than I did, or that with a  stronger constitution than mine he may obtain the same results with less.  This may be true.  I would not presume to measure the efforts of other  men by my own.  I heartily wish him more energy.  I wish him the same  success.  Nevertheless, I had motives external to myself which he may  unfortunately want, and these supplied me with conscientious supports  which mere personal interests might fail to supply to a mind debilitated  by opium.    Jeremy Taylor conjectures that it may be as painful to be born as to die.  I think it probable; and during the whole period of diminishing the opium  I had the torments of a man passing out of one mode of existence into  another.  The issue was not death, but a sort of physical regeneration;  and I may add that ever since, at intervals, I have had a restoration of  more than youthful spirits, though under the pressure of difficulties  which in a less happy state of mind I should have called misfortunes.    One memorial of my former condition still remains--my dreams are not yet  perfectly calm; the dread swell and agitation of the storm have not  wholly subsided; the legions that encamped in them are drawing off, but  not all departed; my sleep is still tumultuous, and, like the gates of  Paradise to our first parents when looking back from afar, it is still  (in the tremendous line of Milton)       With dreadful faces throng'd, and fiery arms.          APPENDIX      From the \"London Magazine\" for December 1822.    The interest excited by the two papers bearing this title, in our numbers  for September and October 1821, will have kept our promise of a Third  Part fresh in the remembrance of our readers.  That we are still unable  to fulfil our engagement in its original meaning will, we, are sure, be  matter of regret to them as to ourselves, especially when they have  perused the following affecting narrative.  It was composed for the  purpose of being appended to an edition of the Confessions in a separate  volume, which is already before the public, and we have reprinted it  entire, that our subscribers may be in possession of the whole of this  extraordinary history.    * * * * *    The proprietors of this little work having determined on reprinting it,  some explanation seems called for, to account for the non-appearance of a  third part promised in the _London Magazine_ of December last; and the  more so because the proprietors, under whose guarantee that promise was  issued, might otherwise be implicated in the blame--little or  much--attached to its non-fulfilment.  This blame, in mere justice, the  author takes wholly upon himself.  What may be the exact amount of the  guilt which he thus appropriates is a very dark question to his own  judgment, and not much illuminated by any of the masters in casuistry  whom he has consulted on the occasion.  On the one hand it seems  generally agreed that a promise is binding in the inverse ratio of the  numbers to whom it is made; for which reason it is that we see many  persons break promises without scruple that are made to a whole nation,  who keep their faith religiously in all private engagements, breaches of  promise towards the stronger party being committed at a man's own peril;  on the other hand, the only parties interested in the promises of an  author are his readers, and these it is a point of modesty in any author  to believe as few as possible--or perhaps only one, in which case any  promise imposes a sanctity of moral obligation which it is shocking to  think of.  Casuistry dismissed, however, the author throws himself on the  indulgent consideration of all who may conceive themselves aggrieved by  his delay, in the following account of his own condition from the end of  last year, when the engagement was made, up nearly to the present time.  For any purpose of self-excuse it might be sufficient to say that  intolerable bodily suffering had totally disabled him for almost any  exertion of mind, more especially for such as demands and presupposes a  pleasurable and genial state of feeling; but, as a case that may by  possibility contribute a trifle to the medical history of opium, in a  further stage of its action than can often have been brought under the  notice of professional men, he has judged that it might be acceptable to  some readers to have it described more at length.  _Fiat experimentum in  corpore vili_ is a just rule where there is any reasonable presumption of  benefit to arise on a large scale.  What the benefit may be will admit of  a doubt, but there can be none as to the value of the body; for a more  worthless body than his own the author is free to confess cannot be.  It  is his pride to believe that it is the very ideal of a base, crazy,  despicable human system, that hardly ever could have been meant to be  seaworthy for two days under the ordinary storms and wear and tear of  life; and indeed, if that were the creditable way of disposing of human  bodies, he must own that he should almost be ashamed to bequeath his  wretched structure to any respectable dog.  But now to the case, which,  for the sake of avoiding the constant recurrence of a cumbersome  periphrasis, the author will take the liberty of giving in the first  person.    * * * * *    Those who have read the Confessions will have closed them with the  impression that I had wholly renounced the use of opium.  This impression  I meant to convey, and that for two reasons: first, because the very act  of deliberately recording such a state of suffering necessarily presumes  in the recorder a power of surveying his own case as a cool spectator,  and a degree of spirits for adequately describing it which it would be  inconsistent to suppose in any person speaking from the station of an  actual sufferer; secondly, because I, who had descended from so large a  quantity as 8,000 drops to so small a one (comparatively speaking) as a  quantity ranging between 300 and 160 drops, might well suppose that the  victory was in effect achieved.  In suffering my readers, therefore, to  think of me as of a reformed opium-eater, I left no impression but what I  shared myself; and, as may be seen, even this impression was left to be  collected from the general tone of the conclusion, and not from any  specific words, which are in no instance at variance with the literal  truth.  In no long time after that paper was written I became sensible  that the effort which remained would cost me far more energy than I had  anticipated, and the necessity for making it was more apparent every  month.  In particular I became aware of an increasing callousness or  defect of sensibility in the stomach, and this I imagined might imply a  scirrhous state of that organ, either formed or forming.  An eminent  physician, to whose kindness I was at that time deeply indebted, informed  me that such a termination of my case was not impossible, though likely  to be forestalled by a different termination in the event of my  continuing the use of opium.  Opium therefore I resolved wholly to abjure  as soon as I should find myself at liberty to bend my undivided attention  and energy to this purpose.  It was not, however, until the 24th of June  last that any tolerable concurrence of facilities for such an attempt  arrived.  On that day I began my experiment, having previously settled in  my own mind that I would not flinch, but would \"stand up to the scratch\"  under any possible \"punishment.\"  I must premise that about 170 or 180  drops had been my ordinary allowance for many months; occasionally I had  run up as high as 500, and once nearly to 700; in repeated preludes to my  final experiment I had also gone as low as 100 drops; but had found it  impossible to stand it beyond the fourth day--which, by the way, I have  always found more difficult to get over than any of the preceding three.  I went off under easy sail--130 drops a day for three days; on the fourth  I plunged at once to 80.  The misery which I now suffered \"took the  conceit\" out of me at once, and for about a month I continued off and on  about this mark; then I sunk to 60, and the next day to--none at all.  This was the first day for nearly ten years that I had existed without  opium.  I persevered in my abstinence for ninety hours; i.e., upwards of  half a week.  Then I took--ask me not how much; say, ye severest, what  would ye have done?  Then I abstained again--then took about 25 drops  then abstained; and so on.    Meantime the symptoms which attended my case for the first six weeks of  my experiment were these: enormous irritability and excitement of the  whole system; the stomach in particular restored to a full feeling of  vitality and sensibility, but often in great pain; unceasing restlessness  night and day; sleep--I scarcely knew what it was; three hours out of the  twenty-four was the utmost I had, and that so agitated and shallow that I  heard every sound that was near me.  Lower jaw constantly swelling, mouth  ulcerated, and many other distressing symptoms that would be tedious to  repeat; amongst which, however, I must mention one, because it had never  failed to accompany any attempt to renounce opium--viz., violent  sternutation.  This now became exceedingly troublesome, sometimes lasting  for two hours at once, and recurring at least twice or three times a day.  I was not much surprised at this on recollecting what I had somewhere  heard or read, that the membrane which lines the nostrils is a  prolongation of that which lines the stomach; whence, I believe, are  explained the inflammatory appearances about the nostrils of dram  drinkers.  The sudden restoration of its original sensibility to the  stomach expressed itself, I suppose, in this way.  It is remarkable also  that during the whole period of years through which I had taken opium I  had never once caught cold (as the phrase is), nor even the slightest  cough."]]]
