Veldtcornet Hans Smith, of Rouxville, contrived to have a conversation  with Captain Wyndham Knight, who, as I have already stated, was one of  our prisoners. The Veldtcornet obtained from him a \"free pass\" to  Kroonstad through the English lines, and also a written request to the  British authorities there to allow him and twenty burghers to proceed  without hindrance to Rouxville. Alas! that any Free State officer should  be capable of such conduct!    Captain Wyndham Knight will be held in high esteem by all who truly  serve their country, for he was a man who never deserted the cause of  his fatherland, no matter what dangers he encountered.    Veldtcornet Hans Smith with his twenty burghers decamped on the night of  the 10th of June, but some days had passed before I discovered the mean  trick he had played.    It was far easier to fight against the great English army than against  this treachery among my own people, and an iron will was required to  fight against both at once. But, even though one possessed an iron will,  such events caused many bitter moments; they were trials which, as an  African proverb[52] says, no single man's back was broad enough to  carry.    [Footnote 45: Highlanders.]    [Footnote 46: A pond which only contains water during \"the rains.\"]    [Footnote 47: The _Uitschudden_ (stripping) of the enemy had not become  necessary at that date. I can say for myself that when, at a later  period, it came into practice, I never witnessed it with any  satisfaction. Yet what could the burghers do but help themselves to the  prisoners' clothing, when England had put a stop to our imports, and cut  off all our supplies?]    [Footnote 48: At this time the burghers were beginning to use the rifles  which they had taken from the enemy.]    [Footnote 49: Rhenoster River bridge.]    [Footnote 50: These dated back to the time of Moselekatze (Umzilygazi).]    [Footnote 51: He was afterwards appointed Commandant.]    [Footnote 52: Literally the proverb runs as follows: \"There are some  trials which will not sit in one man's clothes.\"]          CHAPTER XV    I Make Lord Kitchener's Acquaintance      On the morning of June the 10th my anticipations were realized by the  approach of a large English force from Vredefortweg and Heilbron.  Commanded by Lord Kitchener, and numbering, as I estimated, from twelve  to fifteen thousand men, this force was intended to drive us from the  railway line.    I gave orders that the few waggons which we had with us should proceed  in the direction of Kroonstad, to the west of the line; once out of  sight, they were to turn sharply to the west, and continue in that  direction. This manoeuvre, I hoped, would serve to mislead the enemy,  who was on the look-out for us.    So much for the waggons. For the rest, I felt that it would never do for  us to withdraw without having fired a shot, and I therefore got my men  into position on some kopjes (where Captain Wyndham Knight had been four  days previously, and which lay to the north of Rhenosterriviersbrug) on  my farm Roodepoort, and on the Honingkopjes.    The English, with their well known predilection for a flank attack on  every possible opportunity, halted for an hour, and shelled our  positions with Lyddite and other guns. This did _not_ have the desired  effect of inspiring terror in the burghers who were under my command at  Honingkopjes.    Then the enemy began to move. I saw masses of their cavalry making for a  piece of rising ground to the north of Roodepoort. As the burghers there  were hidden from me, I was unable to observe from where I stood the  effect of this flank movement. Knowing that if they were able to give  way and to retreat along the river we should have no means of  discovering the fact until it was too late and we were surrounded, I  came to the conclusion that it was essential for me to go to Roodepoort  to assure myself that the cavalry had not yet got round. But it was most  important that no suspicion of the danger which threatened us should be  aroused in the burghers--anything calculated to weaken their resistance  was to be avoided on such an occasion. Accordingly I merely told them  that I was going to see how affairs were progressing at Roodepoort, and  that in the meantime they must hold their position.    I rode off, and discovered that the English were already so close to our  troops at Roodepoort that fighting with small arms had begun. I had just  reached an eminence between Roodepoort and the Honingkopjes when I saw  that the burghers in the position furthest towards the north-west were  beginning to flee. This was exactly what I had feared would happen.  Immediately afterwards the men in the centre position, and therefore the  nearest to me, followed their comrades' example. I watched them  loosening their horses, which had been tethered behind a little hill;  they were wild to get away from the guns of the English and from the  advance of this mighty force.    It was impossible for me now to go and tell the burghers on the  Honingkopjes that the time had come when they too must retreat. My only  course was to order the men near me not to effect their escape along the  well protected banks of the river, but to the south, right across the  stream, by a route which would be visible to burghers on the  Honingkopjes. They obeyed my orders, and rode out under a heavy gun and  rifle fire, without, however, losing a single man. The men on the  Honingkopjes saw them in flight, and were thus able to leave their  position before the enemy had a chance of driving them into the river or  of cutting them off from the drift.    Unfortunately, seven burghers from Heilbron were at a short distance  from the others, having taken up their position in a _kliphok_.[53]  Fighting hard as they were, under a deafening gun-fire from the enemy,  who had approached to within a few paces of them, they did not observe  that their comrades had left their positions. Shortly afterwards,  despairing of holding the _kliphok_ any longer, they ran down to the  foot of the hill for their horses, and saw that the rest of the burghers  were already fleeing some eight or nine hundred paces in front of them,  and that their own horses had joined in the flight. There was now only  one course open to them--to surrender to the English.[54]    I ordered the burghers to retreat in the direction of Kroonstad, for by  now they had all fled from Roodepoort and Honingkopjes--a name which,  since that day, has never sounded very _sweet_ to me.[55]    During the morning I received a report informing me that there were  large stores at Kroonstad belonging to the English Commissariat, and  that there was only a handful of troops to protect them. I had no  thought, however, of attempting to destroy the provisions there, for I  felt sure that the British troops, who had but just now put us to  flight, would make for Kroonstad. They would know that the stores stood  in need of a stronger guard, and moreover they would naturally think  that we should be very likely to make an attack at a point where the  defence was so weak.    Obviously, under these circumstances, it would never do for us to go to  Kroonstad.    Accordingly, as soon as darkness came on, I turned suddenly to the west,  and arrived at Wonderheuve late at night. I found there Veldtcornet De  Vos with the prisoners of war.    Meanwhile, as I had anticipated, the vast English army marched up along  thirty-four miles of railway to Kroonstad. Lord Kitchener, as I heard  later on, arrived there shortly after noon on the following day.    We left Wonderheuve early in the morning, and advanced along Rietspruit  until we reached the farm of Vaalbank, where we remained until the  evening of the next day, June the 13th. That night I saw clearly that it  was necessary for us to cross the line if we wanted to keep ourselves  and our prisoners out of the clutches of Lord Kitchener; he had failed  to find us at Kroonstad, and would be certain to look for us in the  country to the west of the line.    I also felt myself bound to wreck this line, for it was the only railway  which Lord Roberts could now utilize for forwarding the enormous  quantities of stores which his vast forces required.[56] I resolved  therefore to cross it at Leeuwspruit, north of Rhenoster River bridge  (which the English had recently repaired), and then, in the morning, to  attack the English garrisons which had again occupied Roodewal and  Rhenoster River bridge.    I had given orders that all the cattle along the railway line should be  removed; General Louis Botha had made the same regulation in regard to  the country round Pretoria and Johannesburg. If only our orders had been  carried out a little more strictly, and if only the most elementary  rules of strategy had been observed in our efforts to break the English  lines of communication, Lord Roberts and his thousands of troops in  Pretoria would have found themselves in the same plight as the  Samaritans in Samaria--they would have perished of hunger. It was not  their Commander-in-Chief's skill that saved them, not his habit of  taking into account all possible eventualities--no, they had to thank  the disobedience of our burghers for the fact that they were not all  starved to death in Pretoria.    I arranged with General Froneman that he should cross the line at the  point I had already selected, that is to say, north of Rhenoster River  bridge, and that in the morning he should attack, from the eastern side,  the English who were posted at Leeuwspruit Bridge. I, in the meanwhile,  would make my way with a Krupp to the west side of the line, and having  found a place of concealment near Roodepoort, would be ready to fall  upon the English as soon as I heard that the other party had opened fire  on them from the east.    But my plan was to come to nothing. For when, during the night, Froneman  reached the line, a skirmish"]]]
