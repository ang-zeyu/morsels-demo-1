She said it was  a marvellous piece of work, and never had she seen the like of it.  Then, by ill hap, she drew the sword from the scabbard, and they both  admired it a long time, looking at its keenness and brightness and the  words of mystery engraved on it.    Suddenly the queen gave a little cry as of terror, and she pointed to  where, within a foot and a half of the point, there was a piece broken  out of the edge. Then, very hastily, the queen ran with the sword into  her bower, and from her treasure-chest she drew a casket, and from the  casket she drew a tiny piece of doeskin, and from that she took a  fragment of steel.    While her daughter marvelled what it all might mean, the queen took the  piece of steel and placed it in the broken part of Sir Tristram's  sword, and it fitted so that the break could hardly be seen.    'Alas!' said the queen, 'this is the piece of sword that the leech took  from the brain of my brother, Sir Marhaus, and this Sir Tramor is the  traitorous knight that slew him!'    The heart of La Belle Isoude stood still for fear of the ill that would  befall Sir Tristram, for she knew her mother's rage.    The queen caught up the sword fiercely in her hand and rushed from the  room. Midway through the hall there met her Sir Tristram himself with  his squire Governale, and the queen sped to him and would have run him  through, but for Governale, who snatched the sword from her, though she  wounded him in her wrath.    Finding her rage thus put to naught, she ran to King Anguish, and threw  herself on her knees before him, crying out:    'Oh, my lord and husband, here have ye in your house that traitor  knight that slew my brother and your champion, that noble knight, Sir  Marhaus. It is Sir Tramor, as he falsely calleth himself, but the piece  of steel that was taken from my brother's brain fits a notch in his  sword.'    'Alas,' cried King Anguish, 'then am I right heavy, for he is as full  noble a knight as ever I knew; and I charge ye, have not to do with  him, but let me deal in this matter.'    The king went to Sir Tristram and found him fully armed, as if ready to  fight for his life, for he knew that now the truth had been discovered.    'Nay, Sir Tramor,' said the king gravely, 'it will not avail thee to  fight me. But this will I do for the love and honour I bear thee.  Inasmuch as ye are within my court it would be no worship for me to  have thee taken and slain, and therefore will I let thee freely depart  if thou wilt tell me this: Who is thy father and what is thy name? And  didst thou truly and rightly slay Sir Marhaus?'    'Tristram is my name,' replied the young knight, 'and I am son of King  Talloch of Lyones. For the truage of Cornwall I fought for the sake of  my uncle King Mark, and the battle with Sir Marhaus was the first I  had, for I was made knight for that alone. Sir Marhaus went from me  alive into his ship, though he left his sword and shield behind him.'    'I may not say that ye have done aught but what a good knight should  do,' replied the king, 'but I may not maintain you in this country  unless I would displease my wife and her kin.'    'Sir,' said Sir Tristram, 'I thank you for your goodness and for the  kind cheer which I have had here of yourself and your queen and La  Belle Isoude. I will depart straightway when I have bidden your  daughter farewell, for I owe my life to her gentle hands; and I promise  this, that I will be your daughter's servant and knight in right or  wrong, to shield her and fight for her, and do all that a knight may do  in her behalf, as long as I live.'    Then took he his leave of La Belle Isoude, and he told her all how he  had come to that land. He thanked her heartily for all her gentleness  to him and for her healing of his wound. At first she stood silent,  changing red and white of face, and with downcast eyes, her fingers  straining about each other. When he swore that he would be her knight,  to fight for her whenever she should send for him, and bade her  good-bye, she took the hand which he held forth, but would not look at  him.    Tristram wondered why her fair hand was so cold. 'Good-bye and God be  with ye always,' La Belle Isoude replied in a faint voice, and then  turned and went from him. Tristram thought she was angered with him for  the slaying of her uncle.    So in a little while he rode forth with Governale down to the seashore  and looked back not once. There he entered by a ship, and with good  wind he arrived at Tintagel in Cornwall, and King Mark and all his  barons were glad that Tristram was whole again.    Then Sir Tristram went to his father King Talloch, and there was made  great cheer for him, and wide lands were given him. Nevertheless, he  could not rest long in one place, but went into Logres and Alban and  Wales, seeking adventures, and his fame for prowess was almost as great  as the fame of Sir Lancelot. Whereever he went he took his harp, and in  hall and bower his favourite songs were those that praised the beauty  of La Belle Isoude, her gentle ways and her soft white hands.    After a year and a day he returned to the court of King Mark and lived  there, and all the knights and ladies admired him, and the praise of  his courtesy was in the mouths of all, noble and simple, high and low.  Then King Mark his uncle began to hate him for the love that all bore  him, and since he had never married and had no son to whom his kingdom  should go after his death, he saw that Sir Tristram would have it, for  he was his next kin, and then, with Lyones and Tintagel, the fame and  power of Tristram would increase abundantly.    So the king began to cast about in his mind for a way whereby he might  do some hurt to Sir Tristram, or even destroy him.    He called the young knight to him one day and said:    'Dear nephew, I have been thinking a long while of taking unto myself a  wife, and I hear much of the beauty and goodness of the king's daughter  of Ireland, whom men call La Belle Isoude. Now I would that you go to  the king and bear my message to him.'    Sir Tristram was troubled in mind at these words. Since he had left La  Belle Isoude he had had no ease of spirit, for now he knew that he  loved her. Though she had been angered with him for his slaying her  uncle, and he knew that the queen and other kinsfolk of Sir Marhaus  would surely slay him if they could, yet had he hoped in a while to  have gone to King Anguish and found some way to win Isoude for his  wife.    'Ye are feared to go, then?' sneered King Mark, noting the silence of  Sir Tristram. 'Then I will e'en send some other knight that is bolder.'    At that Sir Tristram flushed hotly and said:    'I fear not to go there or anywhere, and I will bear thy message, sir.'    'It is well,' said the king. 'I will send thee with a fine ship, and a  rich company of knights, and I will get my scrivener to write my  message.'    Now King Mark said all this by reason of his craft and treachery. He  had heard how Sir Tristram had been full of the praises of La Belle  Isoude, while yet, as he had learned, Sir Tristram had not promised  himself in love to her. By his crafty speech King Mark had hoped to  make Sir Tristram promise to go to Ireland to obtain her, not for  himself, but for King Mark. So, therefore, if the king married La Belle  Isoude, this would cause some grief and hurt to Sir Tristram.    But King Mark cared not overmuch whether he wedded La Belle Isoude or  not. He believed that Sir Tristram would of a surety be slain by the  kin of Sir Marhaus in Ireland, and, if so, King Mark's plot would  succeed to the full.    Sir Tristram, sad and troubled, went apart, and rode into a forest, for  now he knew that he had done himself an ill turn. The lady he loved and  whom he wanted to wife for himself he had now promised to woo for  another.    As he rode moodily through the forest drive, a knight came swiftly  riding on a great horse, its flanks flecked with the foam of its speed.    'Fair knight,' said the stranger, 'will ye of your courtesy tell me  where I may quickly come at a knight called Sir Tristram of Lyones?'    'I am he,' said Tristram. 'What would ye?'    'I thank Heaven that hath led me to you, sir knight,' said the other.  'Here is a message from my master, King Anguish of Ireland, who is in  dire peril of honour and life, and craves aid of you for the love that  hath been atween you.'    Sir Tristram, much marvelling, took the parchment and read: 'These to  you, Sir Tristram of Lyones, most noble knight, from his lover and  friend King Anguish of Ireland, in sore trouble and straits at Camelot.  Know ye, Sir Tristram, that I have been summoned to King Arthur's court  on pain of forfeiture of his lordship's royal grace, to answer a charge  whereof I knew naught till I came here. Which is that by treason and  felony I caused to be slain at my court in Ireland a cousin of Sir  Bleobaris de Ganis and Sir Blamor de Ganis, and of this evil deed these  knights do most falsely accuse me. And there is none other remedy than  for me to answer them in knightly fashion, my armed body against  theirs. But inasmuch as I am old, and my wasted arm could naught avail  me, and in that they are of such renown and prowess that none of my  knights may hope to overcome them, I pray ye, Sir Tristram, of your  ancient love for me, to come to my aid and fight for me as my champion  in this most cruel charge. But if ye will not, and if ye choose to  remember rather that I thrust you from my court, and would not protect  you against those that meant you ill, then forgive my request, and  leave me to my fate and my dishonour.'    The heart of Sir Tristram lifted within him for love of the good old  king, and turning, he said:    'For what day is the trial by combat which your"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22397"],[0,"Shakespearean Playhouses (#20)"],[1,"of animals.    The two amphitheatres, it seems, were used until 1583, when a serious  catastrophe put an end to one if not both of them. Stow, in his  _Annals_, gives the following account of the accident:         The same thirteenth day of January, being Sunday, about four       of the clock in the afternoon, the old and underpropped       scaffolds round about the Bear Garden, commonly called Paris       Garden, on the south side of the river of Thamis over       against the city of London, overcharged with people, fell       suddenly down, whereby to the number of eight persons, men       and women, were slain, and many others sore hurt and bruised       to the shortening of their lives.[183]    [Footnote 183: Stow, _Annals_ (ed. 1631), p. 696.]    Stubbes, the Puritan, writes in his more heightened style:         Upon the 13 day of January last, being the Saboth day,       _Anno_ 1583, the people, men, women, and children, both       young and old, an infinite number, flocking to those       infamous places where these wicked exercises are usually       practised (for they have their courts, gardens, and yards       for the same purpose), when they were all come together and       mounted aloft upon their scaffolds and galleries, and in the       midst of all their jolity and pastime, all the whole       building (not one stick standing) fell down with a most       wonderful and fearful confusion. So that either two or three       hundred men, women, and children (by estimation), whereof       seven were killed dead, some were wounded, some lamed, and       otherwise bruised and crushed almost to death. Some had       their brains dashed out, some their heads all to-squashed,       some their legs broken, some their arms, some their backs,       some their shoulders, some one hurt, some another.[184]    [Footnote 184: Philip Stubbes, _The Anatomie of Abuses_ (ed.  Furnivall), p. 179.]    The building, which the Reverend John Field described as \"old and  rotten,\"[185] was a complete ruin; \"not a stick was left so high as  the bear was fastened to.\" The Puritan preachers loudly denounced the  unholy spectacles, pointing to the catastrophe as a clear warning from  the Almighty; and the city authorities earnestly besought the Privy  Council to put an end to such performances. Yet the owners of the  building set to work at once, and soon had erected a new house,  stronger and larger and more pretentious than before. The Lord Mayor,  in some indignation, wrote to the Privy Council on July 3, 1583, that  \"the scaffolds are new builded, and the multitudes on the Saboth day  called together in most excessive number.\"[186]    [Footnote 185: _A Godly Exhortation by Occasion of the Late Judgement  of God, Shewed at Paris-Garden_ (London, 1583). Another account of the  disaster may be found in Vaughan's _Golden Grove_ (1600).]    [Footnote 186: The Malone Society's _Collections_, I, 65.]    The New Bear Garden, octagonal in form, was probably modeled after the  playhouses in Shoreditch, and made in all respects superior to the old  amphitheatre which it supplanted.[187] We find that it was reckoned  among the sights of the city, and was exhibited to distinguished  foreign visitors. For example, when Sir Walter Raleigh undertook to  entertain the French Ambassador, he carried him to view the monuments  in Westminster Abbey and to see the new Bear Garden.    [Footnote 187: What became of the other amphitheatre labeled \"The Bull  Baiting\" I do not know. Stow, in his _Survey_, 1598, says: \"Now to  return to the west bank, there be two bear gardens, the old and new  places, wherein be kept bears, bulls, and other beasts to be baited.\"]    [Illustration: THE BEAR GARDEN    From Visscher's _Map of London_, published in 1616, but representing  the city as it was several years earlier.]    A picture of the building is to be seen in the Hondius _View of  London_, 1610 (see page 149), and in the small inset views from the  title-pages of Holland's _Her[Greek: o]ologia_, 1620, and Baker's  _Chronicle_, 1643 (see page 147), all three of which probably go back  to a view of London made between 1587 and 1597, and now lost. Another  representation of the structure is to be seen in the Delaram portrait  of King James, along with the Rose and the Globe (see opposite page  246). The best representation of the building, however, is in  Visscher's _View of London_ (see page 127), printed in 1616, but drawn  several years earlier.[188]    [Footnote 188: For a fuller discussion of these various maps and views  see pages 146, 248, and 328. Norden's map of 1594 (see page 147)  merely indicates the site of the building.]    Although we are not directly concerned with the history of the Bear  Garden,[189] a few descriptions of \"the royal game of bears, bulls,  and dogs\" drawn from contemporary sources will be of interest and of  specific value for the discussion of the Hope Playhouse--itself both a  bear garden and a theatre.    [Footnote 189: For such a history the reader is referred to Ordish,  _Early London Theatres_; Greg, _Henslowe's Diary_, II, and _Henslowe  Papers_; Young, _The History of Dulwich College_; Rendle, _The  Bankside_, and _The Playhouses at Bankside_.]    Robert Laneham, in his _Description of the Entertainment at  Kenilworth_ (1575), writes thus of a baiting of bears before the  Queen:         Well, syr, the Bearz wear brought foorth intoo the Coourt,       the dogs set too them.... It was a Sport very pleazaunt of       theez beastz; to see the bear with his pink nyez leering       after hiz enemiez approoch, the nimbleness & wayt of ye dog       to take his auauntage, and the fors & experiens of the bear       agayn to auoyd the assauts: if he war bitten in one place,       how he woold pynch in an oother to get free: that if he wear       taken onez, then what shyft, with byting, with clawing, with       rooring, tossing, & tumbling he woold woork to wynd hym self       from them: and when he waz lose, to shake his earz tywse or       thryse, wyth the blud and the slauer aboout his fiznomy, waz       a matter of a goodly releef.    John Houghton, in his _Collection for Improvement of Husbandry and  Trade_,[190] gives a vivid account of the baiting of the bull. He  says:         The bull takes great care to watch his enemy, which is a       mastiff dog (commonly used to the sport) with a short nose       that his teeth may take the better hold; this dog, if right,       will creep upon his belly that he may, if possible, get the       bull by the nose; which the bull as carefully strives to       defend by laying it close to the ground, where his horns are       also ready to do what in them lies to toss the dog; and this       is the true sport. But if more dogs than one come at once,       or they are cowardly and come under his legs, he will, if he       can, stamp their guts out. I believe I have seen a dog       tossed by a bull thirty, if not forty foot high; and when       they are tossed, either higher or lower, the men above       strive to catch them on their shoulders, lest the fall might       mischief the dogs. They commonly lay sand about that if they       fall upon the ground it may be the easier. Notwithstanding       this care a great many dogs are killed, more have their       limbs broke, and some hold so fast that, by the bull's       swinging them, their teeth are often broken out.... The true       courage and art is to hold the bull by the nose 'till he       roars, which a courageous bull scorns to do.... This is a       sport the English much delight in; and not only the baser       sort, but the greatest lords and ladies.    [Footnote 190: No. 108, August, 1694. Quoted by J.P. Malcolm,  _Anecdotes of the Manners and Customs of London from the Roman  Invasion to the Year 1700_ (London, 1811), p. 433.]    An attendant upon the Duke of Nexara, who visited England in 1544,  wrote the following account of a bear-baiting witnessed in London:         In another part of the city we saw seven bears, some of them       of great size. They were led out every day to an enclosure,       where being tied with a long rope, large and intrepid dogs       are thrown to them, in order that they may bite and make       them furious. It is no bad sport to see them fight, and the       assaults they give each other. To each of the large bears       are matched three or four dogs, which sometimes get the       better and sometimes are worsted, for besides the fierceness       and great strength of the bears to defend themselves with       their teeth, they hug the dogs with their paws so tightly,       that, unless the masters came to assist them, they would be       strangled by such soft embraces. Into the same place they       brought a pony with an ape fastened on its back, and to see       the animal kicking amongst the dogs, with the screams of the       ape, beholding the curs hanging from the ears and neck of       the pony, is very laughable.[191]    [Footnote 191: The original manuscript of this narrative, in Spanish,  is preserved in the British Museum. I quote the translation by  Frederick Madden, in _Archaeologia_, XIII, 354-55.]    Orazio Busino, the chaplain of the Venetian Embassy in London, writes  in his _Anglipotrida_ (1618):         The dogs are detached from the bear by inserting between the       teeth ... certain iron spattles with a wooden handle; whilst       they take them off the bull (keeping at a greater distance)       with certain flat iron hooks which they apply to the thighs       or even to the neck of the dog, whose tail is simultaneously       dexterously seized by another of these rufflers. The bull       can hardly get at anybody, as he wears a collar round his       neck with only fifteen feet of rope, which is fastened to a       stake deeply planted in the middle of the theatre. Other       rufflers are at hand with long poles to put under the dog so       as to"]]]
