[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21677"],[0,"Milton (#20)"],[1,"ucing. Up to that point  magnanimity and courage had been almost the monopoly of Satan. He had  been the Great Dissenter, the undaunted and considerate leader of an  outcast minority. But now, in the description of the war in Heaven, there  came a chance of doing something to right the balance. Milton makes the  most of the episode of Abdiel, who has been led away with the rest of  Satan's followers, upon false pretences, and who, when he discovers the  true purpose of the expedition, makes a lonely stand for the right:--      Among the faithless faithful only he; ...    Nor number nor example with him wrought    To swerve from truth, or change his constant mind,    Though single.    And Abdiel, when he meets Satan again after the outbreak of the war,  glories in his nonconformity, and hisses out defiance:--                              Thou seest    All are not of thy train; there be who faith    Prefer, and piety to God, though then    To thee not visible when I alone    Seemed in thy world erroneous to dissent    From all: my Sect thou seest; now learn too late    How few sometimes may know when thousands err.    In this way Milton attempted to allay his scruples, and to divide the  honours of dissent. Later on, after the Fall, when Satan returns to Hell  with tidings of his exploit, the change of all the devils to serpents,  and of their applause to \"a dismal universal hiss\" was perhaps devised to  cast a slur upon the success of his mission. Some critics have professed  to discern a certain progressive degradation and shrinkage in Satan as  the poem proceeds. But his original creation lived on in the imagination  and memory of Milton, and was revived, with an added pathos, in _Paradise  Regained_. The most moving of all Satan's speeches is perhaps the long  pleading there made in answer to the challenge of Christ, and its tone of  unutterable despair is deepened by the terrible severity of the speech  made in answer.    The other leaders of the rebel troops take little part in the action  outside the scene of the Infernal Council. In his memories of the Long  Parliament Milton could easily find examples of the types he has embodied  under the names of Belial, Mammon, Moloch, and Beelzebub. Nor has he  forgotten the Westminster Assembly of divines. The precise employments of  that historic body are described by him as the recreation of the lost  spirits:--      Others apart sat on a hill retired,    In thoughts more elevate, and reasoned high    Of Providence, Foreknowledge, Will, and Fate--    Fixed fate, free will, foreknowledge absolute--    And found no end, in wandering mazes lost.    It ill became Milton to cast contempt on these reasonings, seeing that a  whole system of them was necessary for the argument of his poem. He is so  little of a philosopher that he seems hardly to be conscious of the  difficulties of his own theory. Both in _Paradise Lost_ and in the  _Treatise of Christian Doctrine_ he enlarges with much dogmatism and some  arrogance on the difference between foreknowledge and foreordination. He  rejects predestination decisively, but he not only does not answer, he  does not even so much as mention, the difficulty that arises in  attempting to distinguish between what is foreordained by Omniscience and  what is foreknown by Omnipotence. Pope compared some of the speeches  delivered in Heaven to the arguments of a \"School-divine.\" The comparison  does injustice to the scholastic philosophers. There was never one of  them who could have walked into a metaphysical bramble-bush with the  blind recklessness that Milton displays.    It is time to return to Eden and its inhabitants. They have little to do  but \"to lop and prune and prop and bind,\" to adore their Maker, and to  avoid the prohibited tree. It would perhaps have been impossible for a  poet with more dramatic genius than Milton to make these favourites of  Heaven interesting in their happy state, while yet the key that was to  admit them to our world of adventure and experience, of suffering and  achievement, hung untouched on a tree. And Adam, from the wealth of his  inexperience, is lavishly sententious; when anything is to do, even if it  is only to go to sleep, he does it in a high style, and makes a speech.  Milton plainly saw the danger of arousing a sense of incongruity and  ludicrous disproportion from the contest between these harmless tame  creatures and the great forces of Satan's empire. So he makes man strong  in innocence, and, unlike the fallen angels, exempt from all physical  pain or wound. He even goes so far as to make Satan afraid of Adam, of  his heroic build and intellectual power. This last, it might be said, is  a fear not explained by anything that we are privileged to hear from the  lips of Adam himself; but perhaps, in the case of our great ancestor, we  shall do well to remember Hamlet's advice to the players, \"Follow that  lord, and look you mock him not.\"    There remains a more important person--Eve. And with Eve, since the  beginning of Milton criticism, there enter all those questions concerning  the comparative worthiness and the relative authority of husband and wife  which critics of Milton so often and so gladly step aside to discuss.  Every one knows the line:--      He for God only, she for God in him.    Almost every one knows the lines:--              Nothing lovelier can be found    In woman than to study household good,    And good works in her husband to promote.    Milton certainly shared the views of Knox concerning the \"Monstrous  Regiment of Women.\" It is unnecessary to meet him on his own ground, or  to attempt a theory that shall explain or control Eve, Cleopatra, Joan of  Arc, Catherine of the Medici, Mary Powell, and others of their sex. Such  theories prove only that man is a generalising and rationalising animal.  The poet brought his fate on himself, for since Eve was the mother of  mankind, he thought fit to make her the embodiment of a doctrine. But he  also (a thing of far deeper interest) coloured his account by the  introduction of personal memories and feelings. Of Eve, at least, he  never writes indifferently. When he came to write _Samson Agonistes_, the  intensity of his feelings concerning Dalila caused him to deviate from  the best Greek tradition and to assign inappropriate matter to the  Chorus. And even in his matter-of-fact _History of Britain_, the name of  Boadicea awakens him to a fit of indignation with the Britons who upheld  her rule. There is full scope in _Paradise Lost_ for similar expressions  of indignation. Adam, after the Fall, speaks of his wife as      Not to be trusted--longing to be seen    Though by the Devil himself.    In the Eleventh Book the daughters of men are described as bred only                              to sing, to dance,    To dress, and troll the tongue, and roll the eye.    But Milton, it is sometimes forgotten, was also the author of that  beautiful eulogy of Eve in the Eighth Book:--                              When I approach    Her loveliness, so absolute she seems    And in herself complete, so well to know    Her own, that what she wills to do or say    Seems wisest, virtuousest, discreetest, best.    All higher Knowledge in her presence falls    Degraded; Wisdom in discourse with her    Loses, discountenanced, and like Folly shows;    Authority and Reason on her wait,    As one intended first, not after made    Occasionally; and, to consummate all,    Greatness of mind and nobleness their seat    Build in her loveliest, and create an awe    About her, as a guard angelic placed.    It is an exact parallel to Florizel's praise of Perdita in _The Winter's  Tale_:--                              When you speak, sweet,    I'd have you do it ever: when you sing,    I'd have you buy and sell so, so give alms,    Pray so; and, for the ordering your affairs,    To sing them too; when you do dance, I wish you    A wave o' the sea, that you might ever do    Nothing but that; move still, still so,    And own no other function: each your doing,    So singular in each particular,    Crowns what you are doing in the present deed,    That all your acts are queens.    But Florizel addresses his praise to the lady herself; while Adam, who  had never been young, confides it in private to Raphael, after dinner,  and studies a more instructive and authoritative strain in his  conversations with Eve. And now comes a point worthy of remark. The  Angel, to whom, it cannot be doubted, Milton committed the exposition of  his own views, after hearing this confession, frowns, and administers a  tart reproof. He describes Eve, somewhat grudgingly, as \"an  outside--fair, no doubt,\" and peremptorily teaches Adam the duties of  self-appreciation and self-assertion:--                          Oft-times nothing profits more    Than self-esteem, grounded on just and right    Well managed. Of that skill the more thou know'st,    The more she will acknowledge thee her head,    And to realities yield all her shows.    And in the sequel, Adam bitterly laments that he had failed to profit by  this advice. He might have been comforted by the wisdom of Chaucer's  Franklin:--      When maistrie cometh, the god of love anon    Beteth his wynges and, farewel, he is gon!    The explanation of all this is clear to see. Milton was not, as he has  sometimes been described, a callous and morose Puritan. He was  extraordinarily susceptible to the attractions of feminine beauty and  grace. Adam's confession is his own. But the ideal of character that he  had put before himself caused him passionately to resent this  susceptibility. It was the joint in his harness, the main breach in his  Stoicism, the great anomaly in a life regulated as for his Task-master.  He felt that beauty was a power not himself, unbalancing and disturbing  the rational self-centred poise of his soul. There have been poets whose  service of Venus Verticordia was whole-hearted.

I don't feel equal to catching another.\" Then she sat  down on the pump-trough to recover.    \"You're a heroine!\" declared Winnie when she came back from the choir  practice and viewed the interesting corpse. \"I shouldn't have dared!  No, nothing in this world would have induced me to seize the creature  by its tail. It's a huge one too, with such wicked-looking teeth. What  a wonder you weren't bitten! You shall have one of those Partridge  Wyandottes for your very own. Choose whichever you like and I'll call  it yours.\"    \"I wish you'd help me to finish my Virgil,\" said Gwen. \"I'm only  halfway through and it's almost bedtime!\"    \"You're as good as a terrier, Gwen!\" said Dick, when he heard the  exciting story the next Saturday. \"I wish you'd come ratting in our  stable at home. I'd undertake to find you some sport.\"    \"Don't be detestable! You talk as if I'd enjoyed it. I had to bury the  thing afterwards, for Winnie wouldn't touch it. I made a mull of my  Virgil in class next day, and I couldn't tell Miss Douglas the  reason.\"    \"You might have put the episode into Latin. It sounds quite Homeric.  Did you keep the tail as a trophy? If we want to excite you we'll just  say 'Rats'. Please let us know when you're on the warpath again and  we'll come to see the fun;\" and Dick dodged round an apple tree and  fled.    \"You've got to be here early next Saturday, mind, and help us to take  things to the Agricultural Show!\" Gwen shouted after him. \"You may  come to breakfast if you'll behave yourself.\"    \"Right-o! I'll act beast of burden provided it's hens I'm to  carry--not rats! Ta-ta!\"    The Agricultural Show was the great event in the year at Skelwick. It  was held in the big field beside the mill, and all the villagers for  miles round made holiday to attend it. For days beforehand men were  busy putting up pens and erecting a tent where eggs and butter and  dressed fowls could be exhibited, while a few travelling caravans  arrived with shooting galleries or cheap bazaars and set up a kind of  fair in an opposite field.    There were many classes for poultry, so Winnie decided to send some of  her best cockerels, a selection of Buff Orpington chickens, and a pair  of big white Aylesbury ducks. She and Gwen got up very early on the  Saturday morning to take a final review of their exhibits. They were  determined to give the ducks a washing in order that they might show  them with their plumage in an absolutely spotless condition. Armed  with a tin bath, a can of warm water, some soap and a sponge, they  shut themselves in a disused pig sty and commenced operations. It is  no easy task to wash a large, struggling, flapping, protesting duck,  and though Gwen held their wings down while Winnie did the scrubbing,  both girls were splashed all over and drenched with water before they  had finished.    \"But the Aylesburys look gorgeous,\" said Gwen, flinging her  dishevelled hair from her hot face. \"They're clean to the very tips of  their beaks. The drake looks as if you'd curled his tail feather with  the curling tongs. They're fearfully upset and angry, poor dears; they  think they've been half killed. Winnie, how are we going to get them  to the Show?\"    \"That's what's puzzling me. We don't possess a basket big enough for  them. I believe we shall have to carry them.\"    \"In our arms? Yes, that'll be by far the best way. They'd knock their  feathers about in a hamper and get dirty again. They've had one  breakfast already, but I think they deserve a little scrap of Indian  corn as a reward for what they've gone through.\"    All exhibits had to be delivered at the Show field by nine o'clock,  and precisely at half-past eight a procession set off from the  Parsonage: Lesbia carefully carrying a dozen beautiful brown eggs in a  basket, the three boys with small hampers of chickens, Dick holding a  little wooden crate containing Black Minorca cockerels, and finally  Winnie and Gwen, each clasping a huge white Aylesbury in her arms.  Dick had offered gallantly to be duck bearer, but the girls preferred  to transport their own pets.    \"They know us so well, you see,\" said Gwen, \"so they won't struggle  like they would with a stranger. Besides, we know just the dodge of  holding down their wings so that they can't flap.\"    They decided to take the short cut to the mill, through two meadows,  across a small stream, and over a stile that led them direct into the  Show ground. Gwen and Winnie got on very well with Dick and the boys  to open gates: it was rather perilous work crossing the stream on a  single plank, but they accomplished that in safety, and Winnie, with  infinite caution, climbed over the stile into the mill meadow, still  hugging her burden. Gwen essayed to follow with equal skill, but the  stile was a very steep and awkward one, and she needed both hands to  hold the drake. She was stepping carefully over the top bar when  somehow her foot caught and she stumbled; she put out one hand to  save herself, and the cunning drake, quick to seize his opportunity,  wriggled himself free and made a dash for liberty.    Off he went over the Show ground, flapping and fluttering like a white  whirlwind and quacking his loudest, and the Gascoyne family, popping  down hampers and baskets, followed hard behind; Winnie, much  encumbered by her duck, shouting frantic directions. It was Dick who  caught the runaway, and pinioned him cleverly until Gwen secured him,  then with much triumph they shut him up with his agitated mate in the  wire pen marked \"No. 207\".    \"I thought we'd lost him,\" panted Winnie. \"Oh, dear! It's no joke  bringing one's beasties to a show. I'm glad we decided not to exhibit  the pigs! Martin, you're not to open that hamper. We shall be having  the chickens escaping next! Stop him, Stumps! I feel like the 'Old  Woman who lived in a Shoe'. Gwen, you take charge of the cockerels  while I find where the Black Minorcas have to go to.\"    The public was not allowed in the field while the judging was in  process; so until twelve o'clock the Gascoynes were obliged to wait  with what patience they could muster. As soon as the gates were opened  they trooped into the Show.    \"Hurrah! First Prize for White Aylesburys!\" exclaimed Winnie  ecstatically, gazing with rapture at the large pink card that  decorated No. 207 pen. \"It was worth washing them. The darlings! How  nice they look!\"    \"And the chickens have got a third!\" yelled the boys, who had taken a  hasty round of the exhibits.    \"The eggs haven't won anything, but the cockerels have 'commended'.  Mrs. Hodges' have got the first.\"    \"We haven't done badly,\" said Winnie, \"considering I can't devote all  my time to it like the farmers' wives. Gwen, you've helped loyally,  and I'm going to give you half a crown out of the prize money. I shall  save the rest to buy some really good White Leghorns; Mrs. Hodges says  they lay better than any others in the winter. Oh, here's Father! We  must go and tell him of our success.\"          CHAPTER XIII    The Shoe Pinches      The very first thing which Gwen did, when Winnie had given her the  promised half-crown out of the prize money, was to go straight to the  post office and buy a postal order for that amount and a penny stamp.  She possessed a few odd coppers, but otherwise no funds had come her  way for a long time, and she had been growing very uneasy about the  bill which she still owed to Parker's for the broken china. She now  sent them the postal order, with a note saying that she hoped very  soon to settle the remainder of the account, and begging them to wait  a little longer. She also asked them to return her a receipt addressed  \"c/o Miss Netta Goodwin, The Thorns, Manor Road, Stedburgh\".    \"I dare say Netta'll be angry, and call it cheek on my part, but I  can't help it,\" thought Gwen. \"I daren't get another letter sent to  school after the rowing Miss Roscoe gave me, and if it comes home,  Beatrice will want to know who's been writing to me. It's only fair  that Netta should take a little of the bother on her own shoulders.  She's certainly had the best of it in this affair. Oh, dear, I still  owe Parker's ten shillings. I haven't the ghost of a notion how I'm to  pay it!\"    Gwen could not forgive Netta for appropriating her prize essay. She  still felt indignant whenever she thought about it, especially as  there was always an uneasy sensation of guilt on her own part. She  knew it was not a straight transaction, and poor Gwen, with all her  faults, loved straightness. For lack of other friendships at school  she was forced into companionship with Netta, but she never  whole-heartedly liked her. Lately, especially, Netta had taken a  rather high-handed tone, and was apt to order her chum about in a  manner that Gwen's independent spirit greatly resented. The friction  between the two was sometimes hot, but neither cared to risk a  quarrel, for each knew that the other, if turned into an enemy, might  come out with some decidedly awkward revelations. So they went on in  the old way, squabbling continually over trifles and making it up  again, but on the whole ready to stand up for each other against the  rest of the Form. Yes, alack!--the rest of the Form, for Gwen, in  spite of her well-meant efforts, had not yet won popularity in the  Fifth. She had tried to be genial and sociable, but nobody seemed to  want her. If she joined in a conversation, Rachel Hunter or Edith  Arnold would stare at her as if they thought it great impertinence on  her part to intrude herself into their concerns. They never asked her  opinion, or consulted her about anything, but simply ignored her, and  left her to her own devices. Nearly all the girls lived in Stedburgh,  and their talk was often of Stedburgh affairs, concerts, amateur  dramatic performances, and entertainments in which Gwen, living far  away at Skelwick, could have no possible part."]]]
