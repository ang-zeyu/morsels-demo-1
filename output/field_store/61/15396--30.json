CANTO XXV. Eighth Circle: seventh pit: fraudulent thieves.  --Cacus. --Agnel Brunelleschi and others.    At the end of his words the thief raised his hands with both the  figs,[1] crying, \"Take that, God! for at thee I square them.\"  Thenceforth the serpents were my friends, for then one coiled  around his neck, as if it said, \"I will not that thou say more,\"  and another round his arms and bound them up anew, clinching  itself so in front that he could not give a shake with them. Ah  Pistoia! Pistoia! why dost thou not decree to make ashes of  thyself, so that thou mayest last no longer, since in evil-doing  thou surpassest thine own seed?[2] Through all the dark  circles of Hell I saw no spirit against God so proud, not he who  fell at Thebes down from the walls.[3] He fled away and spake no  word more.    [1] A vulgar mode of contemptuous defiance, thrusting out the  fist with the thumb between the first and middle finger.    [2] According to tradition, Pistoia was settled by the followers  of Catiline who escaped after his defeat.    [3] Capaneus; see Canto xiv.      And I saw a Centaur full of rage come crying out, \"Where is,  where is that obdurate one?\" I do not think Maremma has so many  snakes as he had upon his croup up to where our semblance begins.  On his shoulders behind the nape a dragon with open wings was  lying upon him, and it sets on fire whomsoever it encounters. My  Master said, \"This is Cacus, who beneath the rock of Mount  Aventine made oftentimes a lake of blood. He goes not on one road  with his brothers because of the fraudulent theft he committed of  the great herd that was in his neighborhood; wherefor his crooked  deeds ceased under the club of Hercules, who perhaps dealt him a  hundred blows with it, and he felt not ten.\"    While he was so speaking, and that one had run by, lo! three  spirits came below us, of whom neither I nor my Leader  was aware till when they cried out, \"Who are ye?\" whereon our  story stopped, and we then attended only unto them. I did not  recognize them, but it happened, as it is wont to happen by  chance, that one must needs name the other, saying, \"Cianfa,  where can he have stayed?\" Whereupon I, in order that the Leader  should attend, put my finger upward from my chin to my nose.    If thou art now, Reader, slow to credit that which I shall tell,  it will not be a marvel, for I who saw it hardly admit it to  myself. As I was holding my brow raised upon them, lo! a serpent  with six feet darts in front of one, and grapples close to him.  With his middle feet he clasped his paunch, and with his forward  took his arms, then struck his fangs in one and the other cheek.  His hinder feet he stretched upon the thighs, and put his tail  between the two, and behind bent it up along the reins. Ivy was  never so bearded to a tree, as the horrible beast through the  other's limbs entwined his own. Then they stuck together as if  they had been of hot wax, and mingled their color; nor one nor  the other seemed now that which it was; even as before the flame,  up along the paper a dark color proceeds which is not yet black,  and the white dies away. The other two were looking on, and each  cried, \"O me! Agnello, how thou changest! Lo, now thou art  neither two nor one! Now were the two heads become one, when  there appeared to us two countenances mixed in one face wherein  the two were lost. Of four [1] strips the two arms were made; the  thighs with the legs, the belly and the chest became members that  were never seen before. Each original aspect there was cancelled;  both and neither the perverse image appeared, and such it went  away with slow step.    [1] The two fore feet of the dragon and the two arms of the man  were melted into two strange arms.      As the lizard under the great scourge of the dog days, changing  from hedge to hedge, seems a flash, if it crosses the way, so  seemed, coming toward the belly of the two others, a little fiery  serpent, livid, and black as a grain of pepper. And that part  whereby our nourishment is first taken it transfixed in one of  them, then fell down stretched out before him. The transfixed one  gazed at it, but said nothing; nay rather, with feet fixed, he  yawned even as if sleep or fever had assailed him. He  looked at the serpent, and that at him; one through his wound,  the other through his mouth, smoked violently, and their smoke  met. Let Lucan henceforth be silent, where he tells of the  wretched Sabellus, and of Nasidius, and wait to hear that which  now is uttered. Let Ovid be silent concerning Cadmus and  Arethusa, for if, poetizing, he converts him into a serpent and  her into a fountain, I envy him not; for two natures front to  front never did he transmute, so that both the forms were prompt  to exchange their matter. To one another they responded by such  rules, that the serpent made his tail into a fork, and the  wounded one drew together his feet. The legs and the very thighs  with them so stuck together, that in short while the juncture  made no sign that was apparent. The cleft tail took on the shape  that was lost there, and its skin became soft, and that of the  other hard. I saw the arms draw in through the armpits, and the  two feet of the beast which were short lengthen out in proportion  as those shortened. Then the hinder feet, twisted together,  became the member that man conceals, and the wretched one from  his had two[1] stretched forth.    [1] Hinder feet.      While the smoke is veiling both with a new color, and generates  hair on the one, and from the other strips it, one rose up, and  the other fell down, not however turning aside their pitiless  lights,[1] beneath which each was changing his visage. He who was  erect drew his in toward the temples, and, from the excess of  material that came in there, issued the ears on the smooth  cheeks; that which did not run backwards but was retained, of its  superfluity made a nose for the face, and thickened the lips so  far as was needful. He who was lying down drives his muzzle  forward, and draws in his ears through his skull, as the snail  doth his horns. And his tongue, which erst was united and fit for  speech, cleaves itself, and the forked one of the other closes  up; and the smoke stops. The soul that had become a brute fled  hissing along the valley, and behind him the other speaking  spits. Then he turned upon him his new shoulders, and said to the  other,[2] \"I will that Buoso[3] run, as I have done, groveling  along this path.\"    [1] Glaring steadily at each other.    [2] The third of the three spirits, the only one unchanged.    [3] Buoso is he who has become a snake.      Thus I saw the seventh ballast[1] change and rechange, and here  let the novelty be my excuse, if my pen straggle[2] a little. And  although my eyes were somewhat confused, and my mind bewildered,  those could not flee away so covertly but that I clearly  distinguished Puccio Sciancato, and he it was who alone, of the  three companions that had first come, was not changed; the  other[3] was he whom thou, Gaville, weepest.    [1] The ballast,--the sinners in the seventh bolgia.    [2] Run into unusual detail.    [3] One Francesco Guerelo de' Cavalcanti, who was slain by men of  the little Florentine town of Gaville, and for whose death cruel  vengeance was taken. The three who had first come were the three  Florentine thieves, Agnello, Buoso, and Puccio. Cianfa Donati had  then appeared as the serpent with six feet, and had been  incorporated with Agnello. Lastly came Guercio Cavalcanti as a  little snake, and changed form with Buoso.        CANTO XXVI. Eighth Circle: eighth pit fraudulent counselors.--  Ulysses and Diomed.    Rejoice, Florence, since thou art so great that over sea  and land thou beatest thy wings, and thy name is spread through  Hell. Among the thieves I found five such, thy citizens, whereat  shame comes to me, and thou unto great honor risest not thereby.  But, if near the morning one dreams the truth, thou shalt feel  within little time what Prato, as well as others, craves for  thee.[1] And if now it were, it would not be too soon. Would that  it were so! since surely it must be; for the more it will weigh  on me the more I age.    [1] If that which I foresee is not a vain dream, the calamities  which thine enemies crave for thee will soon be felt.      We departed thence, and up along the stairs that the bourns[1]  had made for our descent before, my Leader remounted and dragged  me. And pursuing the solitary way mid the splinters and rocks of  the crag, the foot without the hand sped not. Then I grieved, and  now I grieve again when I direct my mind to what I saw; and I  curb my genius more than I am wont, that it may not run unless  virtue guide it; so that if a good star, or better thing, has  given me of good, I may not grudge it to myself.

As the rustic who rests him on the bill in the season when he  that brightens the world keepeth his face least hidden from us,  what time the fly yieldeth to the gnat,[1] sees many fireflies  down in the valley, perhaps there where he makes his vintage and  ploughs,--with as many flames all the eighth pit was resplendent,  as I perceived soon as I was there where the bottom became  apparent. And as he[2] who was avenged by the bears saw the  chariot of Elijah at its departure, when the horses rose erect to  heaven, and could not so follow it with his eyes as to see aught  save the flame alone, even as a little cloud, mounting upward:  thus each[3] was moving through the gulley of the ditch, for not  one shows its theft, and every flame steals away a sinner.[4]    [1] That is, in the summer twilight.

But though the soul was separated from the  body by death, yet there still remained the union of the Word to the  flesh, as will be shown (Q. 50, AA. 2, 3). Hence the Word was not  joined to flesh through the medium of the soul.    _On the contrary,_ Augustine says (Ep. ad Volusianum cxxxvi): \"The  greatness of the Divine power fitted to itself a rational soul, and  through it a human body, so as to raise the whole man to something  higher.\"    _I answer that,_ A medium is in reference to a beginning and an end.  Hence as beginning and end imply order, so also does a medium. Now  there is a twofold order: one, of time; the other, of nature. But in  the mystery of the Incarnation nothing is said to be a medium in the  order of time, for the Word of God united the whole human nature to  Himself at the same time, as will appear (Q. 30, A. 3). An order of  nature between things may be taken in two ways: first, as regards  rank of dignity, as we say the angels are midway between man and God;  secondly, as regards the idea of causality, as we say a cause is  midway between the first cause and the last effect. And this second  order follows the first to some extent; for as Dionysius says (Coel.  Hier. xiii), God acts upon the more remote substances through the  less remote. Hence if we consider the rank of dignity, the soul is  found to be midway between God and flesh; and in this way it may be  said that the Son of God united flesh to Himself, through the medium  of the soul. But even as regards the second order of causality the  soul is to some extent the cause of flesh being united to the Son of  God. For the flesh would not have been assumable, except by its  relation to the rational soul, through which it becomes human flesh.  For it was said above (Q. 4, A. 1) that human nature was assumable  before all others.    Reply Obj. 1: We may consider a twofold order between creatures and  God: the first is by reason of creatures being caused by God and  depending on Him as on the principle of their being; and thus on  account of the infinitude of His power God touches each thing  immediately, by causing and preserving it, and so it is that God is  in all things by essence, presence and power. But the second order is  by reason of things being directed to God as to their end; and it is  here that there is a medium between the creature and God, since lower  creatures are directed to God by higher, as Dionysius says (Eccl.  Hier. v); and to this order pertains the assumption of human nature  by the Word of God, Who is the term of the assumption; and hence it  is united to flesh through the soul.    Reply Obj. 2: If the hypostasis of the Word of God were constituted  simply by human nature, it would follow that the body was nearest to  it, since it is matter which is the principle of individuation; even  as the soul, being the specific form, would be nearer the human  nature. But because the hypostasis of the Word is prior to and more  exalted than the human nature, the more exalted any part of the human  nature is, the nearer it is to the hypostasis of the Word. And hence  the soul is nearer the Word of God than the body is.    Reply Obj. 3: Nothing prevents one thing being the cause of the  aptitude and congruity of another, and yet if it be taken away the  other remains; because although a thing's becoming may depend on  another, yet when it is in being it no longer depends on it, just as  a friendship brought about by some other may endure when the latter  has gone; or as a woman is taken in marriage on account of her  beauty, which makes a woman's fittingness for the marriage tie, yet  when her beauty passes away, the marriage tie still remains. So  likewise, when the soul was separated, the union of the Word with  flesh still endured.  _______________________    SECOND ARTICLE [III, Q. 6, Art. 2]    Whether the Son of God Assumed a Soul Through the Medium of the  Spirit or Mind?    Objection 1: It would seem that the Son of God did not assume a soul  through the medium of the spirit or mind. For nothing is a medium  between itself and another. But the spirit is nothing else in essence  but the soul itself, as was said above (I, Q. 77, A. 1, ad 1).  Therefore the Son of God did not assume a soul through the medium of  the spirit or mind.    Obj. 2: Further, what is the medium of the assumption is itself more  assumable. But the spirit or mind is not more assumable than the  soul; which is plain from the fact that angelic spirits are not  assumable, as was said above (Q. 4, A. 1). Hence it seems that the  Son of God did not assume a soul through the medium of the spirit.    Obj. 3: Further, that which comes later is assumed by the first  through the medium of what comes before. But the soul implies the  very essence, which naturally comes before its power--the mind.  Therefore it would seem that the Son of God did not assume a soul  through the medium of the spirit or mind.    _On the contrary,_ Augustine says (De Agone Christ. xviii): \"The  invisible and unchangeable Truth took a soul by means of the spirit,  and a body by means of the soul.\"    _I answer that,_ As stated above (A. 1), the Son of God is said to  have assumed flesh through the medium of the soul, on account of the  order of dignity, and the congruity of the assumption. Now both these  may be applied to the intellect, which is called the spirit, if we  compare it with the other parts of the soul. For the soul is assumed  congruously only inasmuch as it has a capacity for God, being in His  likeness: which is in respect of the mind that is called the spirit,  according to Eph. 4:23: \"Be renewed in the spirit of your mind.\" So,  too, the intellect is the highest and noblest of the parts of the  soul, and the most like to God, and hence Damascene says (De Fide  Orth. iii, 6) that \"the Word of God is united to flesh through the  medium of the intellect; for the intellect is the purest part of the  soul, God Himself being an intellect.\"    Reply Obj. 1: Although the intellect is not distinct from the soul in  essence, it is distinct from the other parts of the soul as a power;  and it is in this way that it has the nature of a medium.    Reply Obj. 2: Fitness for assumption is wanting to the angelic  spirits, not from any lack of dignity, but because of the  irremediableness of their fall, which cannot be said of the human  spirit, as is clear from what has been said above (I, Q. 62, A. 8;  First Part, Q. 64, A. 2).    Reply Obj. 3: The soul, between which and the Word of God the  intellect is said to be a medium, does not stand for the essence of  the soul, which is common to all the powers, but for the lower  powers, which are common to every soul.  _______________________    THIRD ARTICLE [III, Q. 6, Art. 3]    Whether the Soul Was Assumed Before the Flesh by the Son of God?    Objection 1: It would seem that the soul of Christ was assumed before  the flesh by the Word. For the Son of God assumed flesh through the  medium of the soul, as was said above (A. 1). Now the medium is  reached before the end. Therefore the Son of God assumed the soul  before the body.    Obj. 2: Further, the soul of Christ is nobler than the angels,  according to Ps. 96:8: \"Adore Him, all you His angels.\" But the  angels were created in the beginning, as was said above (I, Q. 46, A.  3). Therefore the soul of Christ also (was created in the beginning).  But it was not created before it was assumed, for Damascene says (De  Fide Orth. iii, 2, 3, 9), that \"neither the soul nor the body of  Christ ever had any hypostasis save the hypostasis of the Word.\"  Therefore it would seem that the soul was assumed before the flesh,  which was conceived in the womb of the Virgin.    Obj. 3: Further, it is written (John 1:14): \"We saw Him [Vulg.: 'His  glory'] full of grace and truth,\" and it is added afterwards that \"of  His fulness we have all received\" (John 1:16), i.e. all the faithful  of all time, as Chrysostom expounds it (Hom. xiii in Joan.). Now this  could not have been unless the soul of Christ had all fulness of  grace and truth before all the saints, who were from the beginning of  the world, for the cause is not subsequent to the effect. Hence since  the fulness of grace and truth was in the soul of Christ from union  with the Word, according to what is written in the same place: \"We  saw His glory, the glory as it were of the Only-begotten of the  Father, full of grace and truth,\" it would seem in consequence that  from the beginning of the world the soul of Christ was assumed by the  Word of God.    _On the contrary,_ Damascene says (De Fide Orth. iv, 6): \"The  intellect was not, as some untruthfully say, united to the true God,  and henceforth called Christ, before the Incarnation which was of the  Virgin.\"    _I answer that,_ Origen (Peri Archon i, 7, 8; ii, 8) maintained that  all souls, amongst which he placed Christ's soul, were created in the  beginning. But this is not fitting, if we suppose that it was first  of all created, but not at once joined to the Word, since it would  follow that this soul once had its proper subsistence without the  Word; and thus, since it was assumed by the Word, either the union  did not take place in the subsistence, or the pre-existing  subsistence of the soul was corrupted. So likewise it is not fitting  to suppose that this soul was united to the Word from the beginning,  and that it afterwards became incarnate in the womb of the Virgin;  for thus His soul would not seem to be of the same nature as ours,  which are created at the same time that they are infused into bodies.  Hence Pope Leo says (Ep. ad Julian. xxxv) that \"Christ's flesh was  not of a different nature to ours, nor was a different soul infused  into it in the beginning than into other men.\"    Reply Obj. 1: As"]]]
