Each extraction is  called a \"run.\" Sometimes as many as ten or fifteen runs are taken  from the same kettle of stock, and each may be finished alone or mixed  with other runs from other stock, resulting in a great variety of  commercial glues.    Manufacturers use many tests for glue, such as the viscosity or  running test, the odor, the presence of grease or of foam, rate of  set, the melting-point, keeping properties, jelly strength (tested  between the finger tips), water absorption (some glues absorb only  once their weight, others ten or twelve times), and binding or  adhesive tests. This latter varies so much with different materials  that what may be good glue for one material is poor for another.    Putting all these things together, glues are classified from grade 10  to 160, 10 being the poorest. The higher standards from 60 and upwards  are neutral hide glues, clear, clean, free from odor, foam, and  grease. The lower standards are chiefly bone glues, used for sizing  straw hats, etc. They are rigid as compared with the flexibility  of hide glues. For wood joints the grade should be 70 or over. For  leather, nothing less than 100 should be used, and special cements are  better still.    The best glue is transparent, hard in the cake, free from spots, of  an amber color, and has little or no smell. A good practical test for  glue is to soak it in water till it swells and becomes jelly-like. The  more it swells without dissolving the better the quality. Poor glue  dissolves. Glue is sometimes bleached, becoming brownish white in  color, but it is somewhat weakened thereby.    Fish glue is made from the scales and muscular tissue of fish.  Isinglass is a sort of glue made from the viscera and air bladder of  certain fish, as cod and sturgeon.    Liquid glue may be made either from animal or fish glue. The LePage  liquid glue is made in Gloucester, Mass., one of the greatest fish  markets in the country. Liquid glue is very convenient because always  ready, but is not so strong as hot glue, and has an offensive  odor. Liquid glues are also made by rendering ordinary glue  non-gelatinizing, which can be done by several means; as, for  instance, by the addition of oxalic, nitric, or hydrochloric acid to  the glue solution.    To prepare hot glue, break it into small pieces, soak it in enough  cold water to cover it well, until it is soft, say twelve hours, and  heat in a glue-pot or double boiler, Fig. 243, p. 148. The fresher  the glue is, the better, as too many heatings weaken it. When used it  should be thin enough to drip from the brush in a thin stream, so that  it will fill the pores of the wood and so get a grip. Two surfaces to  be glued together should be as close as possible, not separated by a  mass of glue. It is essential that the glue be hot and the wood warm,  so that the glue may remain as liquid as possible until the surfaces  are forced together. Glue holds best on side grain. End grain can be  made to stick only by sizing with thin glue to stop the pores. Pieces  thus sized and dried can be glued in the ordinary way, but such joints  are seldom good. Surfaces of hard wood that are to be glued should  first be scratched with a scratch-plane, Fig. 111, P. 79.    To make waterproof glue, add one part of potassium bichromate to fifty  parts of glue. It will harden when exposed to the air and light and be  an insoluble liquid.[8]        [Footnote 8: For recipes for this and other glues, see Woodcraft,      May '07, p. 49.]    _General directions for gluing._[9] Before applying glue to the  parts to be fastened together, it is a good plan to assemble them  temporarily without glue, to see that all the parts fit. When it is  desirable that a certain part, as the panel, in panel construction,  should not be glued in place, it is a wise precaution to apply wax,  soap, or oil to its edges before insertion. Since hot glue sets  quickly, it is necessary after the glue is applied to get the parts  together as soon as possible. One must learn to work fast but to keep  cool. To expedite matters, everything should be quite ready before the  process is begun, clamps, protecting blocks of wood, paper to protect  the blocks from sticking to the wood, braces to straighten angles,  mallet, try-square, and all other appliances likely to be required.        [Footnote 9: For special directions, for particular joints,      see under the various joints, (Chap. VII.)]    Whenever it is possible to break up the process into steps, each step  can be taken with more deliberation. For example, in assembling framed  pieces that are doweled, it is well to glue the dowels into one set  of holes beforehand, making tenons of them, as it were. Time is  thus saved for the final assembling when haste is imperative. The  superfluous glue around the dowels should be carefully wiped off.    Likewise in gluing up framed pieces, sections may be put together  separately: as, the ends of a table, and when they are dry then the  whole may be assembled. When the pieces are together the joints should  be tested to see that they are true, and that there are no twists.    A good way to insure squareness, is to insert a diagonal brace on the  inside, corner to corner, as in Fig. 294, p. 195. Such a brace should  be provided when the trial assembly is made. Another good way to  insure squareness is to pass a rope around two diagonally opposite  posts, and then by twisting the rope, to draw these corners toward  each other until the frame is square.    The superfluous glue may be wiped off at once with a warm damp cloth,  but not with enough water to wet the wood. Or by waiting a few minutes  until the glue thickens, much of it can readily be peeled off with an  edge tool. Either of these ways makes the cleaning easier than to let  the superfluous glue harden.    The work when glued should remain at least six hours in the clamps to  harden.      HINGES    Hinges, Fig. 233, are made in several forms. The most common are the  butt-hinge or butt, the two leaves of which are rectangular, as in  a door-hinge; the strap-hinge, the leaves of which are long and  strap-shaped; the Tee-hinge, one leaf of which is a butt, and the  other strap-shaped; the chest-hinge, one leaf of which is bent at a  right angle, used for chest covers; the table-hinge used for folding  table tops with a rule joint; the piano-hinge, as long as the joint;  the blank hinge or screen-hinge which opens both ways; the stop-hinge,  which opens only 90 deg.; and the \"hook-and-eye\" or \"gate\" hinge.    [Illustration: Fig. 233. a. Butt-hinge. b. Tee-hinge. c. Chest-hinge.  d. Table-hinge. e. Blank or Screen-hinge.]    The knuckle of the hinge is the cylindrical part that connects the two  leaves, Fig. 234. The \"acorn\" is the head of the \"pintle\" or pin that  passes thru the knuckle. Sizes of butts are indicated in inches for  length, and as \"narrow,\" \"middle,\" \"broad\" and \"desk\" for width.  The pin may be either riveted into the knuckle as in box-hinges or  removable as in door-butts. Sometimes, as in blind-hinges, the pintle  is fastened into one knuckle, but turns freely in the other.    A butt-hinge may be set in one of three positions, Fig. 235: (1) Where  it is desired to have the hinge open as wide as possible, as in a  door. Here the knuckle is set well out from the wood. (2) Where it  is desired to have the hinged portion open flat and no more. Here the  center of the pin is in line with the outside surface of the wood.  This is less likely to rack the hinge than the other two positions.  (3) Where it is desired to have the knuckle project as little as  possible.    [Illustration: Fig. 234. Parts of a butt-hinge. 1.1. Leaves. 2.2.2.  Knuckle. 3. Pintle. 4. Acorn.]      HINGING    In setting the hinges of a box cover, first see that the cover fits  the box exactly all the way around.    In the case of a door, see that it fits its frame, evenly all the  way around, but with a little play. To insure a tighter fit at the  swinging edge this edge should be slightly beveled inwards.    In attaching a butt-hinge, the essential thing is to sink the hinge  into the wood, exactly the thickness of the knuckle. The gains may be  cut in one or both of the pieces to be hinged together.    With these matters determined proceed as follows: In the case of a box  cover, the hinges should be set about as far from the ends of the box  as the hinge is long.    In the case of an upright door, locate the hinges respectively above  and below the lower and upper rails of the door. Mark with the knife  on the edge of the door the length of the hinge, and square across  approximately the width of the gain to receive it. Do this for both  hinges. Between these lines gage the proper width of the gains. Set  another gage to one half the thickness of the knuckle and gage on the  door face the depth of the gains. Chisel out the gains, set the hinges  in place, bore the holes, and drive the screws. Place the door in  position again to test the fit. If all is well, mark the position of  the hinges on the frame, gage and cut the gains, and fasten in the  hinges. Where the hinge is gained its full thickness into the door,  no gain, of course, is cut in the frame. If the hinges are set too  shallow, it is an easy matter to unscrew one leaf of each and cut a  little deeper. If they are set too deep the screws may be loosened  and a piece of paper or a shaving inserted underneath along the outer  arris of the gain.      LOCKS    The chief parts of a lock are: the _bolt_, its essential feature, the  _selvage_, the plate which appears at the edge of the door or drawer,  the _box_, which contains the mechanism including the _tumbler_,  _ward_, _spring_, etc., the key-pin, into or around which the key  is inserted, the _strike_, the plate attached opposite the selvage,  (often left out as in drawer-locks, but essential in hook-bolt"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20847"],[0,"India: What can it teach us? (#20)"],[1,"of wealth has become almost a necessity to guard against  the uncertainties of old age or the accidents inevitable in our  complicated social life--with us, I say, and in our society, hours of  rest and meditation are but few and far between. It was the same as  long as we know the history of the Teutonic races; it was the same  even with Romans and Greeks. The European climate, with its long cold  winters, in many places also the difficulty of cultivating the soil,  the conflict of interests between small communities, has developed the  instinct of self-preservation (not to say self-indulgence) to such an  extent that most of the virtues and most of the vices of European  society can be traced back to that source. Our own character was  formed under these influences, by inheritance, by education, by  necessity. We all lead a fighting-life; our highest ideal of life is a  fighting-life. We work till we can work no longer, and are proud, like  old horses, to die in harness. We point with inward satisfaction to  what we and our ancestors have achieved by hard work, in founding a  family or a business, a town or a state. We point to the marvels of  what we call civilization--our splendid cities, our high-roads and  bridges, our ships, our railways, our telegraphs, our electric light,  our pictures, our statues, our music, our theatres. We imagine we have  made life on earth quite perfect--in some cases so perfect that we are  almost sorry to leave it again. But the lesson which both Brahmans and  Buddhists are never tired of teaching is that this life is but a  journey from one village to another, and not a resting-place. Thus we  read:[111]        \"As a man journeying to another village may enjoy a night's      rest in the open air, but, after leaving his resting-place,      proceeds again on his journey the next day, thus father,      mother, wife, and wealth are all but like a night's rest to      us--wise people do not cling to them forever.\"    Instead of simply despising this Indian view of life, might we not  pause for a moment and consider whether their philosophy of life is  entirely wrong, and ours entirely right; whether this earth was really  meant for work only (for with us pleasure also has been changed into  work), for constant hurry and flurry; or whether we, sturdy Northern  Aryans, might not have been satisfied with a little less of work, and  a little less of so-called pleasure, but with a little more of thought  and a little more of rest. For, short as our life is, we are not mere  may-flies, that are born in the morning to die at night. We have a  past to look back to and a future to look forward to, and it may be  that some of the riddles of the future find their solution in the  wisdom of the past.    Then why should we always fix our eyes on the present only? Why should  we always be racing, whether for wealth or for power or for fame? Why  should we never rest and be thankful?    I do not deny that the manly vigor, the silent endurance, the public  spirit, and the private virtues too, of the citizens of European  states represent one side, it may be a very important side, of the  destiny which man has to fulfil on earth.    But there is surely another side of our nature, and possibly another  destiny open to man in his journey across this life, which should not  be entirely ignored. If we turn our eyes to the East, and particularly  to India, where life is, or at all events was, no very severe  struggle, where the climate was mild, the soil fertile, where  vegetable food in small quantities sufficed to keep the body in health  and strength, where the simplest hut or cave in a forest was all the  shelter required, and where social life never assumed the gigantic, ay  monstrous proportions of a London or Paris, but fulfilled itself  within the narrow boundaries of village-communities--was it not, I  say, natural there, or, if you like, was it not _intended_ there, that  another side of human nature should be developed--not the active, the  combative, and acquisitive, but the passive, the meditative, and  reflective? Can we wonder that the Aryans, who stepped as strangers  into some of the happy fields and valleys along the Indus or the  Ganges, should have looked upon life as a perpetual Sunday or holiday,  or a kind of long vacation, delightful so long as it lasts, but which  must come to an end sooner or later? Why should they have accumulated  wealth? why should they have built palaces? why should they have  toiled day and night? After having provided from day to day for the  small necessities of the body, they thought they had the right, it may  be the duty, to look round upon this strange exile, to look inward  upon themselves, upward to something not themselves, and to see  whether they could not understand a little of the true purport of that  mystery which we call life on earth.    Of course _we_ should call such notions of life dreamy, unreal,  unpractical, but may not _they_ look upon our notions of life as  short-sighted, fussy, and, in the end, most unpractical, because  involving a sacrifice of life for the sake of life?    No doubt these are both extreme views, and they have hardly ever been  held or realized in that extreme form by any nation, whether in the  East or in the West. We are not always plodding--we sometimes allow  ourselves an hour of rest and peace and thought--nor were the ancient  people of India always dreaming and meditating on [Greek: ta megista],  on the great problems of life, but, when called upon, we know that they  too could fight like heroes, and that, without machinery, they could by  patient toil raise even the meanest handiwork into a work of art, a real  joy to the maker and to the buyer.    All then that I wish to put clearly before you is this, that the Aryan  man, who had to fulfil his mission in India, might naturally be  deficient in many of the practical and fighting virtues, which were  developed in the Northern Aryans by the very struggle without which  they could not have survived, but that his life on earth had not  therefore been entirely wasted. His very view of life, though we  cannot adopt it in this Northern climate, may yet act as a lesson and  a warning to us, not, for the sake of life, to sacrifice the highest  objects of life.    The greatest conqueror of antiquity stood in silent wonderment before  the Indian Gymnosophists, regretting that he could not communicate  with them in their own language, and that their wisdom could not reach  him except through the contaminating channels of sundry interpreters.    That need not be so at present. Sanskrit is no longer a difficult  language, and I can assure every young Indian civil servant that if he  will but go to the fountain-head of Indian wisdom, he will find there,  among much that is strange and useless, some lessons of life which are  worth learning, and which we in our haste are too apt to forget or to  despise.    Let me read you a few sayings only, which you may still hear repeated  in India when, after the heat of the day, the old and the young  assemble together under the shadow of their village tree--sayings  which to them seem truth; to us, I fear, mere truism!        \"As all have to sleep together laid low in the earth, why do      foolish people wish to injure one another?[112]        \"A man seeking for eternal happiness (moksha) might obtain it      by a hundredth part of the sufferings which a foolish man      endures in the pursuit of riches.[113]        \"Poor men eat more excellent bread than the rich: for hunger      gives it sweetness.[114]        \"Our body is like the foam of the sea, our life like a bird,      our company with those whom we love does not last forever;      why then sleepest thou, my son?[115]        \"As two logs of wood meet upon the ocean and then separate      again, thus do living creatures meet.[116]        \"Our meeting with wives, relations, and friends occurs on our      journey. Let a man therefore see clearly where he is, whither      he will go, what he is, why tarrying here, and why grieving      for anything.[117]        \"Family, wife, children, our very body and our wealth, they      all pass away. They do not belong to us. What then is ours?      Our good and our evil deeds.[118]        \"When thou goest away from here, no one will follow thee.      Only thy good and thy evil deeds, they will follow thee      wherever thou goest.[119]        \"Whatever act, good or bad, a man performs, of that by      necessity he receives the recompense.[120]        \"According to the Veda[121] the soul (life) is eternal, but      the body of all creatures is perishable. When the body is      destroyed, the soul departs elsewhere, fettered by the bonds      of our works.        \"If I know that my own body is not mine, and yet that the      whole earth is mine, and again that it is both mine and      thine, no harm can happen then.[122]        \"As a man puts on new garments in this world, throwing aside      those which he formerly wore, even so the Self[123] of man      puts on new bodies which are in accordance with his      acts.[124]        \"No weapons will hurt the Self of man, no fire will burn it,      no water moisten it, no wind will dry it up.        \"It is not to be hurt, not to be burnt, not to be moistened,      not to be dried up. It is imperishable, unchanging,      immovable, without beginning.        \"It is said to be immaterial, passing all understanding, and      unchangeable. If you know the Self of man to be all this,      grieve not.        \"There is nothing higher than the attainment of the knowledge      of the Self.[125]        \"All living creatures are the dwelling of the Self who lies      enveloped in matter, who is immortal, and spotless.
