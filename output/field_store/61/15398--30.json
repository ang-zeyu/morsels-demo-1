Then, if we truly do believe,         And do the thing aright;       Then, by His merits, we, at last,         Shall live in heaven bright           _Now let good Christians, etc._         And now the Tide is nigh at hand         In which our Saviour came;       Let us rejoice, and merry be,         In keeping of the same.       Let's feed the poor and hungry souls,         And such as do it crave;       Then, when we die, in heaven sure         Our reward we shall have.           _Now let good Christians, etc._    Christmas eve is notable in the Roman Catholic Church for the unique  fact that mass is celebrated at midnight. I say, advisably, _is_  celebrated, because, although Cardinal Manning abolished public mass  at that hour within the diocese of Westminster about 1867, yet in  conventual establishments it is still kept up, and in every church  three masses are celebrated. The ancient, and, in fact, the modern  use, until interrupted by Cardinal Manning, was to celebrate mass at  midnight, at daybreak, and at the third hour (9 a.m.) This use is very  old; for Thelesphorus, who was Pope A.D. 127, decreed that three  masses should be sung _in Festo Nativitatis_, to denote that the birth  of Christ brought salvation to the fathers of three periods--viz. the  fathers before, under, and after the law.    Another Roman Catholic custom on Christmas eve is the preparation of  \"the Manger,\" which in some places is a very elaborate affair. The  Christ is lying on straw between the ox and ass, Mary and Joseph  bending over Him; the shepherds are kneeling in adoration, and the  angels, hovering above, are supposed to be singing the _gloria in  excelsis_. A writer in the _Catholic World_ (vol. xxxiv. p. 439)  says:--\"Christmas Dramas are said to owe their origin to St. Francis  of Assisi. Before his death he celebrated the sacred Birth-night in  the woods, where a stable had been prepared with an ox and an ass, and  a crib for an altar. A great number of people came down from the  mountains, singing joyful hymns and bearing torches in their hands;  for it was not fitting that a night that had given light to the whole  world, should be shrouded in darkness. St. Francis, who loved to  associate all nature with his ministry, was filled with joy. He  officiated at the Mass as deacon. He sang the Gospel, and then  preached in a dramatic manner on the birth of Christ. When he spoke of  the Lamb of God, he was filled with a kind of divine frenzy, and  imitated the plaintive cry of the sacrificial lamb; and, when he  pronounced the sweet name of Jesus, it was as if the taste of honey  were on his lips. One soul before the rural altar, that night, with  purer eyes than the rest, saw the Divine Babe, radiant with eternal  beauty, lying in the manger.\"          CHAPTER XII         Decorating with Evergreens--Its Origin and       Antiquity--Mistletoe in Churches--The permissible       Evergreens--The Holly--\"Holly and Ivy\"--\"Here comes       Holly\"--\"Ivy, chief of Trees\"--\"The Contest of the Ivy and       the Holly\"--Holly Folk-lore--Church Decorations--To be kept       up till Candlemas day.      Christmas Eve is especially the time for decorating houses and  churches with evergreens, a custom which seems to have come from  heathen times; at least, no one seems to know when it commenced.  Polydore Vergil[40] says:--\"Trymming of the temples with hangynges,  floures, boughes, and garlondes, was taken of the heathen people,  whiche decked their idols and houses with such array.\" That it is an  old custom in England to deck houses, churches, etc., at Christ-tide  with evergreens is undoubted--the only question is, how old is it?  Stow, in his _Survey_, says: \"Against the Feast of Christmas, every  man's house, as also their parish churches, were decked with holme,  ivy, bayes, and whatsoever the season of the year afforded to be  green. The Conduits and Standards in the streets were, likewise,  garnished; among the which I read that, in the year 1444, by tempest  of thunder and lightning, towards the morning of Candlemas day, at the  Leadenhall in Cornhill, a standard of tree, being set up in the midst  of the pavement, fast in the ground, nailed full of holme and ivie,  for disport of Christmass to the people, was torne up and cast down by  the malignant Spirit (as was thought), and the stones of the pavement  all about were cast in the streets, and into divers houses, so that  the people were sore aghast at the great tempests.\"    [Footnote 40: Langley's _Abridg._, p. 100.]    Stow, we see, makes no mention of mistletoe, nor do we find it in old  churchwardens' accounts, because mistletoe was accounted a heathen  plant, on account of its association with the Druids, and not only was  therefore unsuitable to bedeck a place of Christian worship, but the  old rite of kissing beneath it rendered it inadmissible. Still, in  Queen Anne's time, it was recognised as a Christmas decoration, for  Gay in his _Trivia_ has sung--         When _Rosemary_ and _Bays_, the poet's crown,       Are bawl'd in frequent cries through all the town;       Then judge the festival of Christmas near,       Christmas, the joyous period of the year!       Now with bright _Holly_ all the temples strow       With _Laurel_ green, and sacred MISTLETOE.    The mistletoe is found in several counties in England, but the bulk of  that which we have now at Christ-tide comes from Brittany. There is a  popular belief that it grows on oaks, possibly on account of Druidical  tradition to that effect, but, as a matter of fact, its connection  with that tree in England is very rare, Dr. Ball, in a paper in the  _Journal of Botany_, only mentioning seven authentic instances of its  growth on the oak tree in this country. It principally makes its  _habitat_ on the apple, poplar, hawthorn, lime, maple, and mountain  ash, and has been found on the cedar of Lebanon and the laurel.    The bay tree was believed to have the property of protection against  fire or lightning. The ivy was considered to prevent intoxication, and  for this reason Bacchus is represented as being crowned with ivy  leaves. The holly was originally the Holy Tree, and tradition says  that, unknown before, it sprang up in perfection and beauty beneath  the footsteps of Christ when he first trod the earth, and that, though  man has forgotten its attributes, the beasts all reverence it, and are  never known to injure it.    The four following carols are all of the fifteenth century:         HOLLY AND IVY         Holly and Ivy made a great party,       Who should have the mastery         In lands where they go.         Then spake Holly, \"I am fierce and jolly,       I will have the mastery         In lands where we go.\"         Then spake Ivy, \"I am loud and proud,       And I will have the mastery         In lands where we go.\"         Then spake Holly, and set him down on his knee,         \"I pray thee, gentle Ivy, say[41] me no villany         In lands where we go.\"    [Footnote 41: Do.]           HERE COMES HOLLY           Alleluia, Alleluia,         Alleluia, now sing we.       Here comes Holly, that is so gent,[42]       To please all men is his intent,           Alleluia.         But Lord and Lady of this Hall,       Whosoever against Holly call.           Alleluia.         Whosoever against Holly do cry,       In a lepe[43] he shall hang full high.           Alleluia.         Whosoever against Holly doth sing,       He may weep and hands wring.           Alleluia.

You have admitted the fitness of my expression, \"paternal  government\": it only has been, and remains, a question between us, how  far such government should extend. Perhaps you would like it only to  regulate, among the children, the length of their lessons; and perhaps I  should like it also to regulate the hardness of their cricket-balls: but  cannot you wait quietly till you know what I want it to do, before  quarrelling with the thing itself?    _O._--No; I cannot wait quietly; in fact, I don't see any use in  beginning such a discussion at all, because I am quite sure from the  first, that you want to meddle with things that you have no business  with, and to interfere with healthy liberty of action in all sorts of  ways; and I know that you can't propose any laws that would be of real  use.[15]    [Note 15: If the reader is displeased with me for putting this  foolish speech into his mouth, I entreat his pardon; but he may be  assured that it is a speech which would be made by many people, and the  substance of which would be tacitly felt by many more, at this point of  the discussion. I have really tried, up to this point, to make the  objector as intelligent a person as it is possible for an author to  imagine anybody to be who differs with him.]      126. _R._--If you indeed know that, you would be wrong to hear me any  farther. But if you are only in painful doubt about me, which makes you  unwilling to run the risk of wasting your time, I will tell you  beforehand what I really do think about this same liberty of action,  namely, that whenever we can make a perfectly equitable law about any  matter, or even a law securing, on the whole, more just conduct than  unjust, we ought to make that law; and that there will yet, on these  conditions, always remain a number of matters respecting which legalism  and formalism are impossible; enough, and more than enough, to exercise  all human powers of individual judgment, and afford all kinds of scope  to individual character. I think this; but of course it can only be  proved by separate examination of the possibilities of formal restraint  in each given field of action; and these two lectures are nothing more  than a sketch of such a detailed examination in one field, namely, that  of art. You will find, however, one or two other remarks on such  possibilities in the next note.           *       *       *       *       *    Note 2nd, p. 21.--\"_Right to public support._\"      127. It did not appear to me desirable, in the course of the spoken  lecture, to enter into details or offer suggestions on the questions of  the regulation of labour and distribution of relief, as it would have  been impossible to do so without touching on many disputed or disputable  points, not easily handled before a general audience. But I must now  supply what is wanting to make my general statement clear.    I believe, in the first place, that no Christian nation has any business  to see one of its members in distress without helping him, though,  perhaps, at the same time punishing him: help, of course--in nine cases  out of ten--meaning guidance, much more than gift, and, therefore,  interference with liberty. When a peasant mother sees one of her  careless children fall into a ditch, her first proceeding is to pull him  out; her second, to box his ears; her third, ordinarily, to lead him  carefully a little way by the hand, or send him home for the rest of the  day. The child usually cries, and very often would clearly prefer  remaining in the ditch; and if he understood any of the terms of  politics, would certainly express resentment at the interference with  his individual liberty: but the mother has done her duty. Whereas the  usual call of the mother nation to any of her children, under such  circumstances, has lately been nothing more than the foxhunter's,--\"Stay  still there; I shall clear you.\" And if we always _could_ clear them,  their requests to be left in muddy independence might be sometimes  allowed by kind people, or their cries for help disdained by unkind  ones. But we can't clear them. The whole nation is, in fact, bound  together, as men are by ropes on a glacier--if one falls, the rest must  either lift him or drag him along with them[16] as dead weight, not  without much increase of danger to themselves. And the law of right  being manifestly in this--as, whether manifestly or not, it is always,  the law of prudence--the only question is, how this wholesome help and  interference are to be administered.    [Note 16: It is very curious to watch the efforts of two  shop-keepers to ruin each other, neither having the least idea that his  ruined neighbour must eventually be supported at his own expense, with  an increase of poor rates; and that the contest between them is not in  reality which shall get everything for himself, but which shall first  take upon himself and his customers the gratuitous maintenance of the  other's family.]      128. The first interference should be in education. In order that men  may be able to support themselves when they are grown, their strength  must be properly developed while they are young; and the State should  always see to this--not allowing their health to be broken by too early  labour, nor their powers to be wasted for want of knowledge. Some  questions connected with this matter are noticed farther on under the  head \"trial schools\": one point I must notice here, that I believe all  youths, of whatever rank, ought to learn some manual trade thoroughly;  for it is quite wonderful how much a man's views of life are cleared by  the attainment of the capacity of doing any one thing well with his  hands and arms. For a long time, what right life there was in the upper  classes of Europe depended in no small degree on the necessity which  each man was under of being able to fence; at this day, the most useful  things which boys learn at public schools are, I believe, riding,  rowing, and cricketing. But it would be far better that members of  Parliament should be able to plough straight, and make a horseshoe, than  only to feather oars neatly or point their toes prettily in stirrups.  Then, in literary and scientific teaching, the great point of economy is  to give the discipline of it through knowledge which will immediately  bear on practical life. Our literary work has long been economically  useless to us because too much concerned with dead languages; and our  scientific work will yet, for some time, be a good deal lost, because  scientific men are too fond or too vain of their systems, and waste the  student's time in endeavouring to give him large views, and make him  perceive interesting connections of facts; when there is not one  student, no, nor one man, in a thousand, who can feel the beauty of a  system, or even take it clearly into his head; but nearly all men can  understand, and most will be interested in, the facts which bear on  daily life. Botanists have discovered some wonderful connection between  nettles and figs, which a cowboy who will never see a ripe fig in his  life need not be at all troubled about; but it will be interesting to  him to know what effect nettles have on hay, and what taste they will  give to porridge; and it will give him nearly a new life if he can be  got but once, in a spring time, to look well at the beautiful circlet of  white nettle blossom, and work out with his schoolmaster the curves of  its petals, and the way it is set on its central mast. So, the principle  of chemical equivalents, beautiful as it is, matters far less to a  peasant boy, and even to most sons of gentlemen, than their knowing how  to find whether the water is wholesome in the back-kitchen cistern, or  whether the seven-acre field wants sand or chalk.      129. Having, then, directed the studies of our youth so as to make them  practically serviceable men at the time of their entrance into life,  that entrance should always be ready for them in cases where their  private circumstances present no opening. There ought to be government  establishments for every trade, in which all youths who desired it  should be received as apprentices on their leaving school; and men  thrown out of work received at all times. At these government  manufactories the discipline should be strict, and the wages steady, not  varying at all in proportion to the demand for the article, but only in  proportion to the price of food; the commodities produced being laid up  in store to meet sudden demands, and sudden fluctuations in prices  prevented:--that gradual and necessary fluctuation only being allowed  which is properly consequent on larger or more limited supply of raw  material and other natural causes. When there was a visible tendency to  produce a glut of any commodity, that tendency should be checked by  directing the youth at the government schools into other trades; and the  yearly surplus of commodities should be the principal means of  government provisions for the poor. That provision should be large, and  not disgraceful to them. At present there are very strange notions in  the public mind respecting the receiving of alms: most people are  willing to take them in the form of a pension from government, but  unwilling to take them in the form of a pension from their parishes.  There may be some reason for this singular prejudice, in the fact of the  government pension being usually given as a definite acknowledgment of  some service done to the country;--but the parish pension is, or ought  to be, given precisely on the same terms. A labourer serves his country  with his spade, just as a man in the middle ranks of life serves it with  his sword, pen, or lancet:"]]]
