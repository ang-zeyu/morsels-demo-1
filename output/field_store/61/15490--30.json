Punish me but let the little  chap go, I beg of you,\" pleaded the woman, with streaming eyes.    Mr. Ackerman cleared his throat; it was plain that the simple eloquence  of the request had touched him deeply.    \"With your permission, officer, I am going to withdraw my charge,\" he  said, with a tremor in his voice. \"You are to let both these persons go  scot free. You, my good woman, meant well but acted foolishly. As for  the boy, Donovan, I will assume the responsibility for him.\"    \"You are willing to stand behind him, Mr. Ackerman?\"    \"I am.\"    The detective turned toward the boy who had risen and was fumbling  awkwardly with the brass buttons adorning his uniform.    \"You hear, Dick Martin, what the gentleman says,\" began he impressively.  \"He believes you are a good boy, and as you have handed back the  valuables in your possession he is going to take a chance on you and let  you go.\"    A wave of crimson swept over the face of the boy and for the first time  the tension in the youthful countenance relaxed.    \"But Mr. Ackerman,\" Donovan continued, \"expects you are going to behave  yourself in future and never do such a thing again.\"    \"I am going to see your father, Dick,\" broke in Mr. Ackerman's kindly  voice, \"and talk with him and--\"    \"I haven't any father,\" declared the lad.    \"Your mother then.\"    \"I've no mother either.\"    \"Who do you live with?\"    \"Mr. Aronson.\"    \"Is he a relative?\"    \"Oh, no, sir! I haven't any relatives. There's nobody belongin' to me.  Mr. Aronson is the tailor downstairs where I sleep. When I ain't working  here I do errands for him and he lets me have a cot in a room with four  other boys--newsboys, bell hops and the like. We pay two dollars between  us for the room and sometimes when I carry a lot of boxes round for Mr.  Aronson he gives me my breakfast.\"    \"Nobody else is responsible for you?\"    \"Nop!\" returned the boy with emphasis. \"No, sir, I mean.\"    \"I'll attend to all this, Donovan,\" murmured Mr. Ackerman in an  undertone to the detective. \"The lad shall not remain there. I don't  know yet just what I'll do with him but I will plan something.\" Then  addressing the lad, he continued, \"In the meantime, Dick, you are to  consider me your relative. Later I shall hunt you up and we will get  better acquainted. Be a good boy, for I expect some day you are going to  make me very proud of you.\"    \"What!\"    In sheer astonishment the boy regarded his benefactor.    There was something very appealing in the little sharp-featured face  which had now lost much of its pallor and softened into friendliness.    \"Why shouldn't you make me proud of you?\" inquired Mr. Ackerman softly.  \"You can, you know, if you do what is right.\"    \"I'm goin' to try to, sir,\" burst out Dick with earnestness. \"I'm goin'  to try to with all my might.\"    \"That is all any one can ask of you, sonny,\" replied the steamboat  magnate. \"Come, shake hands. Remember, I believe in you, and shall trust  you to live up to your word. The officer is going to let you go and none  of us is going to mention what has happened. I will fix up everything  for you and Mrs. Nolan so you can both go back to your work without  interference. Now bid Mr. Tolman and his son good-by and run along.  Before I leave the hotel I will look you up and you can give me Mr.  Aronson's address.\"    Master Richard Martin needed no second bidding. Eager to be gone he  awkwardly put out his hand, first to Mr. Tolman and then to Steve; and  afterward, with a shy smile to the detective and the policeman and a  boyish duck of his head, he shot into the hall and they heard him  rushing pell-mell down the corridor. Mrs. Nolan, however, was more  self-controlled. She curtsied elaborately to each of the men and called  down upon their heads every blessing that the sky could rain, and it was  only after her breath had become quite exhausted that she consented to  retire from the room and in company with the policeman and the detective  proceeded downstairs in the elevator.    \"Well, Tolman,\" began the New Yorker when they were at last alone, \"you  see my heart was my best pilot. I put faith in it and it led me aright.  Unfortunately it is now too late for the matinee but may I not renew my  invitation and ask you and your son to dine with me this evening and  conclude our eventful day by going to the theater afterward?\"    Mr. Tolman hesitated.    \"Don't refuse,\" pleaded the steamboat man. \"Our acquaintance has, I  confess, had an unfortunate beginning; but a bad beginning makes for a  good ending, they say, and I feel sure the old adage will prove true in  our case. Accept my invitation and let us try it out.\"    \"You are very kind,\" murmured Mr. Tolman vaguely, \"but I--\"    \"Help me to persuade your father to be generous, Stephen,\" interposed  Mr. Ackerman. \"We must not let a miserable affair like this break up  what might, perhaps, have been a delightful friendship.\"    \"I don't need any further persuading, Ackerman,\" Mr. Tolman spoke  quickly. \"I accept your invitation with great pleasure.\"    \"That's right!\" cried Mr. Ackerman, with evident gratification.  \"Suppose you come to my house at seven o'clock if that will be  convenient for you. We will have a pleasant evening together and forget  lost pocketbooks, detectives and policemen.\"    Taking out a small card, he hurriedly scrawled an address upon it.    \"I keep a sort of bachelor's hall out on Riverside Drive,\" explained he,  with a shade of wistfulness. \"My butler looks out for me and sees that I  do not starve to death. He and his son are really excellent housekeepers  and make me very comfortable.\" He slipped into his overcoat. \"At seven,  then,\" he repeated. \"Don't fail me for I should be much disappointed.  Good-by!\" and with a wave of his hand he departed, leaving Stephen and  his father to themselves.          CHAPTER X    AN EVENING OF ADVENTURE      That evening Steve and his father took a taxi-cab and drove to the  number Mr. Ackerman had given them. It proved to be an imposing  apartment house of cream brick overlooking the Hudson; and the view from  the fifth floor, where their host lived, was such a fascinating one that  the boy could hardly be persuaded to leave the bay window that fronted  the shifting panorama before him.    \"So you like my moving picture, do you, Steve?\" inquired the New Yorker  merrily.    \"It is great! If I lived here I shouldn't do a bit of studying,\" was the  lad's answer.    \"You think the influence of the place bad, then.\"    \"It would be for me,\" Stephen chuckled.    Both Mr. Tolman and Mr. Ackerman laughed.    \"I will own,\" the latter confessed, \"that at first those front windows  demoralized me not a little. They had the same lure for me as they have  for you. But by and by I gained the strength of mind to turn my back and  let the Hudson River traffic look out for itself.\"    \"You might try that remedy, son,\" suggested Steve's father.    \"No, no, Tolman! Let the boy alone. If he is enjoying the ferries and  steamboats so much the better.\"    \"But there seem to be plenty of steamboats here in the room to enjoy,\"  was Mr. Tolman's quick retort.    \"Steamboats?\" repeated Steve vaguely, turning and looking about him.    Sure enough, there were steamboats galore! Wherever he looked he saw  them. Not only were the walls covered with pictures of every imaginable  type of steamer, but wherever there was space enough there were tiers of  little ship models in glass cases. There were side-wheelers, awkwardly  constructed boats with sprawling paddles, screw propellers, and  twin-screw craft; ferryboats, tugs, steam yachts, and ocean liners.  Every known variety of sea-going contrivance was represented. The large  room was like a museum of ships and the boy gave an involuntary  exclamation of delight.    \"Jove!\"    It was a laconic tribute to the marvels about him but it was uttered  with so much vehemence that there was no mistaking its sincerity.  Evidently, terse as it was, its ring of fervor satisfied Mr. Ackerman  for he smiled to himself.    \"I never saw so many boats in all my life!\" burst out Steve.    \"I told you I was in the steamboat business,\" put in Mr. Ackerman  mischievously.    \"I should think you were!\" was the lad's comment.    \"This is a wonderful collection, Ackerman,\" Mr. Tolman asserted, as he  rose and began to walk about the room. \"How did you ever get it  together? Many of these prints are priceless.\"    \"Oh, I have been years doing it,\" Mr. Ackerman said. \"It has been my  hobby. I have chosen to sink my money in these toys instead of in an  abandoned farm or antique furniture. It is just a matter of taste, you  see.\"    \"You must have done some scouring of the country to make your collection  so complete. I don't see how you ever succeeded in finding these old  pictures and models. It is a genuine history lesson.\"    \"I do not deserve all the credit, by any means,\" the capitalist  protested with modesty. \"My grandfather, who was one of the owners of  the first of the Hudson River steamers, began collecting pictures and  drawings; and at his death they came to my father who added to them.  Afterward, when the collection descended to me, I tried to fill in the  gaps in order to make the sequence complete. Of course in many cases I  have not been able to find what I wanted, for neither prints nor models  of some of the ships I desired were to be had. Either there were no  copies of them in existence, or if there were no money could tempt their  owners to part with them. Still I have a well enough graded lot to show  the progression.\"    \"I should think you had!\" said Mr. Tolman heartily. \"You have arranged  them beautifully, too, from the old whalers and early American coasting  ships to the clippers. Then come the first steam packets, I see, and  then the development of the steamboat through its successive steps up to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22248"],[0,"The Indian Fairy Book: From the Original Legends (#20)"],[1,", rather peevishly, \"No,  these are not the dreams.\"    \"Keep cool,\" said the kettle, which had left the fire, and was standing  in the middle of the floor, where a pleasant breeze was blowing through  the lodge, and added, \"Have you no more dreams of another kind?\"    \"Yes,\" said Maidwa; and he told him one.    \"That will do,\" said the kettle. \"We are much pleased with that.\"    \"Yes, that is it--that is it!\" the magician added. \"You will cause me to  live. That was what I was wishing you to say. Will you then go and see  if you can not recover my poor scalp?\"    \"Yes,\" said Maidwa, \"I will go; and the day after to-morrow, when you  hear the ka-kak cries of the hawk, you will know that I am successful.  You must prepare your head, and lean it out through the door, so that  the moment I arrive I may place your scalp on.\"    \"Yes, yes,\" said the magician. \"As you say it will be done.\"    Early the next morning Maidwa set out to fulfill his promise; and in the  afternoon, when the sun hangs toward home, he heard the shouts of a  great many people. He was in a wood at the time, and saw, as he thought,  only a few men, but as he went on they increased in numbers. On emerging  upon the plain, their heads appeared like the hanging leaves, they were  so many.    In the middle of the plain he perceived a post, and something waving at  its top. It was the wampum scalp; and every now and then the air was  rent with the war-song, for they were dancing the war-dance in high  spirit around it.    Before he could be observed, Maidwa changed himself into a humming-bird,  and flew toward the scalp. As he passed some of those who were standing  by, he came close to their ears, and as they heard the rapid whirr or  murmur which this bird makes when it flies, they jumped aside, and asked  each other what it could be. Maidwa had nearly reached the scalp, but  fearing that he should be perceived while untying it, he again changed  himself into the down that floats lightly on the air, and sailed slowly  on to the scalp. He loosened it, and moved off heavily, as the weight  was almost too great for him to bear up. The Indians around would have  snatched it away had not a lucky current of air just then buoyed him up.  As they saw that it was moving away they cried out, \"It is taken from  us! it is taken from us!\"    Maidwa was borne gently along but a little way above their heads; and as  they followed him, the rush and hum of the people was like the dead  beating of the surges upon a lake shore after a storm. But the good wind  gaining strength, soon carried him beyond their pursuit. A little  further on he changed himself into a hawk, and flew swiftly off with  his trophy, crying, \"Ka-kak! ka-kak!\" till it resounded with its shrill  tone through the whole country, far and wide.    Meanwhile the magician had remembered the instructions of Maidwa,  placing his head outside of the lodge as soon as he heard the ka-kak cry  of the hawk.    In a moment Maidwa came past with rustling wings, and as he flew by,  giving the magician a severe blow on the head with the wampum scalp, his  limbs extended and quivered in an agony, the scalp adhered, and Maidwa,  in his own person, walked into the lodge and sat down, feeling perfectly  at home.    The magician was so long in recovering from the stunning blow which had  been dealt him, that Maidwa feared that in restoring the crown of his  head he had destroyed his life. Presently, however, he was pleased to  see him show, by the motion of his hands and limbs, that his strength  was returning; and in a little while he rose and stood upon his feet.  What was the delight of Maidwa to behold, instead of a withered old man,  far advanced in years and stricken in sorrow, a bright and cheerful  youth, who glittered with life as he stood up before him.    \"Thank you, my friend,\" he said. \"Your kindness and bravery of heart  have restored me to my former shape. It was so ordained, and you have  now accomplished the victory.\"    They embraced; and the young magician urged the stay of his deliverer  for a few days, and they formed a strong attachment to each other. The  magician, to the deep regret of Maidwa, never once alluded to the Red  Swan in all their conferences.    At last the day arrived when Maidwa prepared to return to his home. The  young magician bestowed on him ample presents of wampum, fur, robes, and  other costly things. Although Maidwa's heart was burning within him to  see the Red Swan, to hear her spoken of, and to learn what his fortune  was to be in regard to that fond object of his pursuit, he constrained  his feelings, and so checked his countenance as to never look where he  supposed she might be. His friend the young magician observed the same  silence and caution.    Maidwa's pack for traveling was now ready, and he was taking his  farewell smoke, when the young magician thus addressed him: \"My friend  Maidwa, you know for what cause you came thus far, and why you have  risked so much and waited so long. You have proved my friend indeed. You  have accomplished your object, and your noble perseverance shall not go  unrewarded. If you undertake other things with the same spirit, you will  always succeed. My destiny compels me to remain where I am, although I  should feel happy to be allowed to go with you. I have given you, of  ordinary gifts, all you will need as long as you live; but I see you  are backward to speak of the Red Swan. I vowed that whoever procured me  my lost wampum-scalp should be rewarded by possessing the Red Swan.\"    He then spoke in a language which Maidwa did not understand, the curtain  of the lodge parted, and the Red Swan met his gaze. It was a beautiful  female that he beheld, so majestical and airy in her look, that he  seemed to see a creature whose home should rather be in the free heaven,  and among the rosy clouds, than in this dusky lodge.    \"Take her,\" the young magician said; \"she is my sister; treat her well.  She is worthy of you, and what you have done for me merits more. She is  ready to go with you to your kindred and friends, and has been so ever  since your arrival; and my good wishes shall go with you both.\"    The Red Swan smiled kindly on Maidwa, who advanced and greeted her. Hand  in hand they took their way forth from the lodge, and, watched by the  young magician, advanced across the prairie on their homeward course.    They traveled slowly, and looked with double joy on the beautiful  country over which they had both so lately passed with hearts ill at  ease.    After two or three days they reached the lodge of the third old man who  had entertained him with the singing kettle; but the kettle was not  there. The old man, nevertheless, received them very kindly, and said  to Maidwa, \"You see what your perseverance has secured you; do so  always, and you will succeed in whatever you undertake.\"    On the following morning, when they were about to start, he pulled from  the side of the lodge a bag, which he presented to Maidwa, saying,  \"Grandchild, I give you this; it contains a present for you; and I hope  you will live happily till old age.\"    Bidding him farewell, they again set forward; and they soon came to the  second old man's lodge; he also gave them a present and bestowed his  blessing. Nor did Maidwa see any thing here of the frisky little kettle  which had been so lively on his former visit.    As they went on and came to the lodge of the first old man, their  reception and farewell were the same; and when Maidwa glanced to the  corner, the silent kettle, which had been the first acquaintance he had  made in that family on his travels, was not there. The old man smiled  when he discovered the direction of Maidwa's glance, but he said  nothing.    When, on continuing their journey, they at last approached the first  town which Maidwa had passed in his pursuit, the watchman gave notice as  before, and he was shown into the chief's lodge.    \"Sit down there, son-in-law,\" said the chief, pointing to a place near  his daughter. \"And you also,\" he said to the Red Swan.    The chief's daughter was engaged in coloring a girdle, and, as if  indifferent to these visitors, she did not even raise her head.  Presently the chief said, \"Let some one bring in the bundle of our  son-in-law.\"    When the bundle was laid before him, Maidwa opened one of the bags which  had been given to him. It was filled with various costly  articles--wampum, robes, and trinkets, of much richness and value;  these, in token of his kindness, he presented to the chief. The chief's  daughter stole a glance at the costly gifts, then at Maidwa and his  beautiful wife. She stopped working, and was silent and thoughtful all  the evening. The chief himself talked with Maidwa of his adventures,  congratulated him on his good fortune, and concluded by telling him that  he should take his daughter along with him in the morning.    Maidwa said \"Yes.\"    The chief then spoke up, saying, \"Daughter, be ready to go with him in  the morning.\"    Now it happened when the chief was thus speaking that there was a  foolish fellow in the lodge, who had thought to have got this chief's  daughter for a wife; and he jumped up, saying:    \"Who is he,\" looking grimly at Maidwa, \"that he should take her for a  few presents? I will kill him.\"    And he raised a knife which he had in his hand, and gave it a mighty  flourish in the air. He kept up this terrible flourish till some one  came and pulled him back to his seat, which he had been waiting for,  and then he sat quiet enough.    Amid the greetings of their new friends, Maidwa and the Red Swan, with  the chief's daughter, took their leave by peep of day, and toward  evening they reached the other town. The watchman gave the signal, and  numbers of men, women and children stood out to see them. They were  again shown into the chief's lodge, who welcomed him, saying:    \"Son-in-law, you are welcome.\"    And he requested Maidwa"]]]
