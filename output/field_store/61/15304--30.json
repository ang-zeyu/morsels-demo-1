It resembles the Central    Asian states in its majority Muslim population, high structural    unemployment, and low standard of living. The economy's most prominent    products are oil, cotton, and gas. Production from the Caspian oil and    gas field has been in decline for several years. With foreign    assistance, the oil industry might generate the funds needed to spur    industrial development. However, civil unrest, marked by armed    conflict in the Nagorno-Karabakh region between Muslim Azeris and    Christian Armenians, makes foreign investors wary. Azerbaijan    accounted for 1.5% to 2% of the capital stock and output of the former    Soviet Union. Azerbaijan shares all the formidable problems of the    ex-Soviet republics in making the transition from a command to a    market economy, but its considerable energy resources brighten its    prospects somewhat. Old economic ties and structures have yet to be    replaced. A particularly galling constraint on economic revival is the    Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, said to consume 25% of Azerbaijan's    economic resources.  National product:    GDP - purchasing power equivalent - $15.5 billion (1993 estimate from    the UN International Comparison Program, as extended to 1991 and    published in the World Bank's World Development Report 1993; and as    extrapolated to 1993 using official Azerbaijani statistics, which are    very uncertain because of major economic changes since 1990)  National product real growth rate:    -13.3% (1993 est.)

It was really very self-sacrificing of her, for she might have  gained far more credit by concentrating her energies on a few, but for  the ultimate good of the school it was undoubtedly far and away the best  policy to pursue. The training of a number of recruits may not be as  interesting as the polishing up of champions, but in time recruits  become veterans, and a school in which the standard of the ordinary play  is very high has a better general chance than one that depends on an  occasional _solitary_ star. So even the little girls were strictly  supervised in their practices, and both cricket and tennis showed  healthy development.    The Governors and the head mistress were anxious that the games  department should prosper, and gave every encouragement. There were a  larger number of tennis courts provided than fall to the share of most  schools, and each form had its allotted times for play. Athletics were  indeed compulsory, every girl being required to take her due part,  unless she were excused by a medical certificate.    Winona worked with the utmost enthusiasm. As a Fifth Form girl she had,  of course, to be rather humble towards the Sixth, but she felt that  Kirsty approved of her. It was never Kirsty's way to praise, and she  could be scathing in her remarks sometimes, but Winona did not mind  criticism from her captain, and acted so well on all the advice given  that she was making rapid strides. In pursuance of Kirsty's all-round  training policy, she was not allowed to specialize in either tennis or  cricket this summer, but to give equal energy to both. So she practiced  bowling under Hester King's careful supervision, and played exciting  sets while Clarice Nixon stood by to watch and score.    The games appealed to Winona more than any other part of the school  curriculum. She did fairly well now in her Form work, but she knew she  could never be clever like Garnet, and that it was extremely unlikely  that she would win laurels on her books. She had promised Miss Bishop  that she would try to do credit to the school in return for her  scholarship, and to help to raise its athletic reputation seemed her  most feasible method of success.    \"I could never get a College Scholarship, however I tried,\" she thought,  \"but--I won't say it's probable, but it's just possible that I might do  something some day in the way of winning matches. Miss Bishop would be  pleased at that!\"    The early summer was delightful at Seaton. The park opposite the school  was full of tulips and hyacinths, and the long avenue of trees in the  Abbey Close had burst into tender green foliage. Winona studied her  home lessons sitting by her open bedroom window with a leafy bower  outside, and an accompaniment of jackdaws cawing in the old towers of  the Minster. She loved this window and the prospect from it. There was a  romantic, old-world flavor about the gray pile opposite, its carvings  and cloisters and chiming bells seemed so peaceful and so far removed  from modern trouble. Sometimes indeed the whirr of a biplane would  disturb the quiet as an airman flittered like a great dragon-fly over  the city, reminding her that medieval times were past; while a bugle  call from the neighboring barracks emphasized the fact that the world  was at war. Not that Winona was likely to forget that! Every day in  school the Peace Bell prayer was read at noon, and she might see  regiments of recruits marching up or down the High Street on their way  to their training grounds. Nearly every girl in V.a. had some  relation at the front, and though Winona could not boast of anybody  nearer than a third cousin serving \"somewhere in France,\" she looked for  news as eagerly as the rest.    \"It must be glorious to get letters from the trenches,\" she said half  wistfully one day to Beatrice Howell, who was exulting over a pencil  scrawl written by her brother in a dug-out. \"I half wish----\"    \"No, you don't!\" snapped Beatrice. \"It's a nightmare to have them in the  firing line! Be thankful your brother's still safe at school.\"    On the subject of Percy, Winona was far from easy. He had let fall one  or two hints during the Easter holidays which confirmed her previous  suspicion that he had got into a wrong set at Longworth College. He had  written to her twice already this term, wanting to borrow money, and  suggesting that, without mentioning his name, she should ask Miss Beach  to lend it to her. With such a request, however, Winona had utterly  refused to comply.    \"Aunt Harriet has been so decent to us I can't begin to sponge on her,\"  she wrote back. \"Besides, she'd want to know what I wanted such a lot  for, and then all the mischief would be out!\"    Apparently Percy was offended, for his usual weekly letter did not  appear. Winona only laughed, expecting he would soon get over his fit of  sulks. She was utterly unprepared for the sequel. One day she received a  note from him written on Y.M.C.A. paper and headed \"Horminster.\" It ran  thus:    \"DEAR WIN,--I'd got into such an altogether grizzly hole that  there was only one way out, and I've taken it. I am at present a member  of His Majesty's Forces, and if you want to write to me address: Private  P. D. Woodward, 17th Battalion, Royal Rytonshire Fusiliers, Horminster.                                       \"Your affectionate brother,                                                          \"PERCY.\"      \"P.S.--You can tell the mater if you like.\"    Winona, in a great state of excitement, showed the note to Aunt Harriet,  who telegraphed the information to Mrs. Woodward. The latter had just  heard from Percy's housemaster of his disappearance, and was greatly  relieved to have news of his whereabouts. The runaway was below military  age, and his mother's first impulse was to apply for his immediate  discharge. But from this course her best friends dissuaded her. The  headmaster of Longworth College and Mr. Joynson, her trustee, were  unanimous in counseling her to leave the boy alone, and Aunt Harriet  cordially agreed with them.    \"Let the lad serve his country!\" she wrote to her niece. \"He is tall for  his age, and if the Military Authorities have accepted him, well and  good. It seems to me the one thing in the world that is likely to steady  him and give him that sense of responsibility that hitherto he has so  signally lacked. You will make the mistake of your life if you keep him  back now.\"    It seemed funny to Winona to imagine Percy, so young and boyish,  actually in His Majesty's uniform. He had not yet got his khaki, but he  promised to have a photo taken as soon as ever he was in military garb,  and she looked forward to showing the portrait of her soldier brother to  the girls in her Form. She began a pair of socks for him at once. I  regret to say that Winona's patriotic knitting had languished very much  during the last two terms, but this personal stimulus revived her ardor.  She even took her sock to the tennis court, and, emulating the example  of Patricia Marshall and several other enthusiasts, got quite good  pieces done between the sets. She would have taken it to cricket also,  but Kirsty had sternly made a by-law prohibiting all knitting on the  pitch since Ellinor Cooper, when supposed to be fielding, had  surreptitiously taken her work from her pocket and missed the best catch  of the afternoon, to her everlasting disgrace and the scorn of the  indignant Games Captain.    Kirsty was keen at present upon each Form having its own Eleven, and had  arranged some school matches as trials of skill. The first of these,  Sixth _v._ Fifth, was fixed for the following Saturday afternoon.  Winona, to her ecstatic and delirious delight, had been elected captain  of the combined V.a. and V.b. Eleven, and she was looking forward to the  contest as one of the events of her life. She was aware that on its  success or failure might hang much of her future athletic career at  school, and she was determined to show of what stuff she was made. She  urged her team to make heroic efforts, and got all the practice in that  was available. On the Thursday afternoon she gave everybody a final  drilling. On Friday the pitch would be the property of the Lower School,  so this was the last opportunity of play before the match.    \"If any of you muff the ball or do anything stupid, I'll never forgive  you!\" she assured her Eleven. \"The Sixth are A1 at fielding, so for  goodness' sake don't disgrace our Form. Beware of Patricia's bowling. It  looks simple, but it's the nastiest I know. I'd rather have Kirsty's any  day, because at least you know what to expect from her, and you're on  your guard. Don't try to be clever too soon; it's better not to score at  all during the first over than to run any risks. Evelyn, you were a  mascot to-day! I hope you'll play up equally well on Saturday. By the  by, Joyce, I really can't compliment you on your innings. What were you  thinking of to make that idiotic blind swipe?\"    \"I don't know!\" returned Joyce dolefully. (She was sitting on the fence  looking decidedly crestfallen.) \"I'm afraid I'm rather rocky to-day,  somehow.\"    \"Got nerves? Girl alive! Do brace up!\"    \"No, it's not nerves. My head's been aching all the week, and I've a  pain across my chest, and I keep shivering. I suppose I must have caught  cold. It'll be a grizzly nuisance if I can't play on Saturday!\"    \"You _must_ play!\" urged Winona. \"We've got to beat the Sixth or perish  in the attempt! You go home at once, and get some hot tea, and go to bed  afterwards if you don't feel better. You may stop in bed all to-morrow  if it'll do you good!\"    \"Thank you, Grannie! Perhaps I will go home now. I really am feeling  rather queer.\"    \"She looks queer, too,\" said Bessie Kirk to Winona, as they stood  watching Joyce's retreating figure. \"I thought she was going to faint a  while ago. It'll be a hideous nuisance if she has to be out of it.\"    \"Our "]]]
