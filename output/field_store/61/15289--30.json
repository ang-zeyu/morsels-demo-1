The noble picture,  preserved intact under this layer of dust, like Pompeii under its mantle  of ashes, appeared so young and fresh that the count never doubted but  that he had discovered the canvas of a great master, an unknown  _chef-d'oeuvre_. He had the strength of mind to control his  excitement, and proposed to the _cure_ to exchange this great  dilapidated painting for a beautiful picture, quite new, perfectly  clean, very brilliant, and well framed, which would do honour to the  church and give pleasure to the faithful. The _cure_ joyfully accepted  it, smiling to himself at the eccentricity of the count, who gave new  for old and demanded nothing in return.    When relieved of its dirt and stains, Titian's _Assunta_ appeared  radiant as the sun when it bursts through the clouds. Parisian readers  may form an idea of the importance of this discovery by going to see the  beautiful copy, recently made by Serrur and placed in the Beaux Arts.  The _Assunta_ is one of Titian's greatest works, the one in which he  attains his highest flight: the composition is balanced and distributed  with infinite art. The upper portion, which is arched, represents  Paradise, Glory, as the Spanish say in their ascetic language: garlands  of angels floating and submerged in a wave of light of uncalculable  depth, stars scintillating in the flame, and brighter glints of the  everlasting light form the aureole of the Father, who arrives from the  depths of the infinite with the action of a hovering eagle, accompanied  by an archangel and a seraph whose hands support the crown and the  nimbus.    This Jehovah, like a divine bird appearing head-foremost and with body  horizontally foreshortened beneath a wave of drapery flying open like  wings, astonishes us by its sublime boldness; if it is possible for the  brush of a human being to give a countenance to divinity, certainly  Titian has succeeded. Unlimited power and imperishable youth radiate  from that white-bearded face that need only nod for the snows of  eternity to fall: not since the Olympian Jove of Phidias has the lord of  heaven and earth been represented more worthily.    [Illustration: THE ASSUMPTION OF THE VIRGIN.          _Titian._]    The centre of the picture is occupied by the Virgin Mary, who is lifted  up, or rather who is surrounded by a wreath of angels and souls of the  blessed: for she has no need of any aid to mount to Heaven; she rises by  the springing upward of her robust faith, by the purity of her soul,  which is lighter than the most luminous ether. Truly there is in this  figure an unheard-of force of ascension, and in order to obtain this  effect Titian has not had recourse to slender forms, diaphanous  draperies, and transparent colours. His Madonna is a very true, very  living, and very real woman, with a beauty as solid as that of the Venus  de Milo, or the sleeping woman in the Tribune of Florence. Large, full  drapery flows about her in numerous folds; her flanks are wide enough to  have contained a God, and, if she was not on a cloud, the Marquis du  Guast might have put his hand on her beautiful bosom, as in the picture  in our Museum. Yet nothing is of more celestial beauty than this great  and strong figure in its rose-coloured tunic and azure mantle;  notwithstanding the powerful voluptuousness of the body, the radiant  glance is of the purest virginity.    At the base of the picture, the apostles are grouped in  happily-contrasted attitudes of rapture and surprise. Two or three  little angels, who link them to the intermediary zone of the  composition, seem to be explaining to them the miracle that is taking  place. The heads of the apostles, who are of various ages and  characters, are painted with a surprising force of vitality and reality.  The draperies are of that fullness and abundant flow that characterize  Titian as the richest and at the same time the simplest of all  painters.    In studying this Virgin and mentally comparing her with other Virgins of  different masters, we reflected what a marvellous and ever new thing is  art. What Catholic painting has embroidered with variations upon this  theme of the Madonna, without ever exhausting it, astonishes and  confuses the imagination; but, in reflecting, we comprehend that under  the conventional type each painter conveyed secretly, at the same time,  his dream of love and the personification of his talent.    The Madonna of Albrecht Duerer in her sad and somewhat constrained  gracefulness, with her tired features, interesting rather than  beautiful, her air of a matron rather than a Virgin, her German and  _bourgeoise_ frankness, her tight garments and her symmetrically broken  folds, almost always accompanied by a rabbit, an owl, or an ape, through  some vague memory of Germanic pantheism, may she not be the woman whom  he would have loved and preferred to all others, and does she not also  exceedingly well represent the very genius of the artist? As she is his  Madonna, she might easily be his Muse.    The same resemblance exists in Raphael. The type of his Madonna, in  whom, mingled with old memories, the features of the Fornarina are  always found, sometimes suggested, sometimes copied, most frequently  idealized, is she not the most perfect symbol of his talent,--elegant,  graceful, and penetrated throughout with a chaste voluptuousness? The  Christian nourished on Plato and Greek Art, the friend of Leo X., the  dilettante Pope, the artist who died of love while painting the  _Transfiguration_, did he not live entirely in these modest Venuses  holding on their knees a child who is Love? If we wished to symbolize  the genius of every painter in an allegorical picture, would it be any  other than the angel of Urbino?    The Virgin of the _Assunta_, big, strong, highly-coloured, with her  robust and beautiful grace, her fine bearing, and her simple and natural  beauty,--is she not Titian's painting with all its qualities? We might  carry our researches still further; but we have said enough as a  suggestion.    Thanks to the dusty shroud which covered it for so long, the _Assunta_  glows with a quite youthful brilliancy; the centuries have not elapsed  for it, and we enjoy the supreme pleasure of seeing a picture of  Titian's just it came fresh from the palette.        _Voyage en Italie_ (new ed., Paris, 1884).          THE NIGHT WATCH    (_REMBRANDT_)    EUGENE FROMENTIN      We know how the _Night Watch_ is hung. It faces the _Banquet of  Arquebusiers_ by Van der Helst, and, no matter what has been said, the  two pictures do not hurt each other. They oppose each other like day and  night, like the transfiguration of things and their literal imitation,  slightly vulgar and clever. Admit that they are as perfect as they are  celebrated and you will have before your eyes a unique antithesis, what  La Bruyere calls \"opposition truths that illuminate one another.\"    I shall not astonish anyone in saying that the _Night Watch_ possesses  no charm, and the fact is without example among the fine works of  pictorial art. It is amazing, it is disconcerting, it is imposing, but  it absolutely lacks that insinuating quality that convinces us, and it  almost always fails to please us at first. In the first place, it shocks  our logical sense and that habitual visual rectitude that loves clear  forms, lucid ideas, and clearly formulated boldness; something warns us  that our imagination as well as our reason will be only half satisfied  and that even the mind that is most easily won over will not submit till  the last and will not surrender without dispute. This is due to various  causes that do not all arise from the picture,--the light is  detestable; the frame of dark wood in which the painting is drowned  spoils its middle values, and its bronze scale of colour, and its force,  and makes it look much more smoked than it is; and, lastly and above  all, the exigencies of the place prevent the picture from being hung at  the proper height, and, against all the laws of the most elementary  perspective, oblige you to look at it from the same level.    [Illustration: THE NIGHT WATCH.          _Rembrandt._]    You are aware that the _Night Watch_, rightly or wrongly, passes for an  almost incomprehensible work, and that constitutes its chief prestige.  Perhaps it would have made far less noise in the world, if for two  centuries people had not kept up the habit of trying to find out its  meaning instead of examining its merits, and persisted in the mania of  regarding it as a picture enigmatical above all.    Taking it literally, what we know of the subject seems to me sufficient.  In the first place, we know the names and quality of the personages,  thanks to the care with which the painter has inscribed them on a plate  at the bottom of the picture; which proves that if the painter's fancy  has transfigured many things, the chief idea at least deals with the  customs of local life. It is true that we cannot tell for what purpose  these men are going out armed, whether they are going to practise  shooting, or on parade, or what; but, as there is no matter here for the  deeper mysteries, I am persuaded that if Rembrandt has failed to be more  explicit it is because either he did not wish or he did not know how to  be, and there is a whole series of hypotheses that might be very simply  explained by some such matter as inability or intentional reticence. As  for the time of day (the most vexed question of all and the only one,  moreover, that could have been settled when first it arose), for fixing  that we have no need to discover that the Captain's outstretched arm  casts a shadow upon the skirt of his coat. It suffices to remember that  Rembrandt never treated light otherwise; that nocturnal obscurity is his  habit; that shadow is the ordinary form of his poetic feeling and his"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/175"],[0,"The Phantom of the Opera (#20)"],[1,"they met every day and where they amused themselves by dining on three  biscuits, two glasses of port and a bunch of violets.  In the evening,  she did not sing; and he did not receive his usual letter, though they  had arranged to write to each other daily during that month.  The next  morning, he ran off to Mamma Valerius, who told him that Christine had  gone away for two days.  She had left at five o'clock the day before.    Raoul was distracted.  He hated Mamma Valerius for giving him such news  as that with such stupefying calmness.  He tried to sound her, but the  old lady obviously knew nothing.    Christine returned on the following day.  She returned in triumph.  She  renewed her extraordinary success of the gala performance.  Since the  adventure of the \"toad,\" Carlotta had not been able to appear on the  stage.  The terror of a fresh \"co-ack\" filled her heart and deprived  her of all her power of singing; and the theater that had witnessed her  incomprehensible disgrace had become odious to her.  She contrived to  cancel her contract.  Daae was offered the vacant place for the time.  She received thunders of applause in the Juive.    The viscount, who, of course, was present, was the only one to suffer  on hearing the thousand echoes of this fresh triumph; for Christine  still wore her plain gold ring.  A distant voice whispered in the young  man's ear:    \"She is wearing the ring again to-night; and you did not give it to  her.  She gave her soul again tonight and did not give it to you...  If  she will not tell you what she has been doing the past two days ... you  must go and ask Erik!\"    He ran behind the scenes and placed himself in her way.  She saw him  for her eyes were looking for him.  She said:    \"Quick!  Quick! ... Come!\"    And she dragged him to her dressing-room.    Raoul at once threw himself on his knees before her.  He swore to her  that he would go and he entreated her never again to withhold a single  hour of the ideal happiness which she had promised him.  She let her  tears flow.  They kissed like a despairing brother and sister who have  been smitten with a common loss and who meet to mourn a dead parent.    Suddenly, she snatched herself from the young man's soft and timid  embrace, seemed to listen to something, and, with a quick gesture,  pointed to the door.  When he was on the threshold, she said, in so low  a voice that the viscount guessed rather than heard her words:    \"To-morrow, my dear betrothed!  And be happy, Raoul:  I sang for you  to-night!\"    He returned the next day.  But those two days of absence had broken the  charm of their delightful make-believe. They looked at each other, in  the dressing-room, with their sad eyes, without exchanging a word.  Raoul had to restrain himself not to cry out:    \"I am jealous!  I am jealous!  I am jealous!\"    But she heard him all the same.  Then she said:    \"Come for a walk, dear.  The air will do you good.\"    Raoul thought that she would propose a stroll in the country, far from  that building which he detested as a prison whose jailer he could feel  walking within the walls ... the jailer Erik ...  But she took him to  the stage and made him sit on the wooden curb of a well, in the  doubtful peace and coolness of a first scene set for the evening's  performance.    On another day, she wandered with him, hand in, hand, along the  deserted paths of a garden whose creepers had been cut out by a  decorator's skilful hands.  It was as though the real sky, the real  flowers, the real earth were forbidden her for all time and she  condemned to breathe no other air than that of the theater.  An  occasional fireman passed, watching over their melancholy idyll from  afar.  And she would drag him up above the clouds, in the magnificent  disorder of the grid, where she loved to make him giddy by running in  front of him along the frail bridges, among the thousands of ropes  fastened to the pulleys, the windlasses, the rollers, in the midst of a  regular forest of yards and masts.  If he hesitated, she said, with an  adorable pout of her lips:    \"You, a sailor!\"    And then they returned to terra firma, that is to say, to some passage  that led them to the little girls' dancing-school, where brats between  six and ten were practising their steps, in the hope of becoming great  dancers one day, \"covered with diamonds ...\" Meanwhile, Christine gave  them sweets instead.    She took him to the wardrobe and property-rooms, took him all over her  empire, which was artificial, but immense, covering seventeen stories  from the ground-floor to the roof and inhabited by an army of subjects.  She moved among them like a popular queen, encouraging them in their  labors, sitting down in the workshops, giving words of advice to the  workmen whose hands hesitated to cut into the rich stuffs that were to  clothe heroes.  There were inhabitants of that country who practised  every trade.  There were cobblers, there were goldsmiths.  All had  learned to know her and to love her, for she always interested herself  in all their troubles and all their little hobbies.    She knew unsuspected corners that were secretly occupied by little old  couples.  She knocked at their door and introduced Raoul to them as a  Prince Charming who had asked for her hand; and the two of them,  sitting on some worm-eaten \"property,\" would listen to the legends of  the Opera, even as, in their childhood, they had listened to the old  Breton tales.  Those old people remembered nothing outside the Opera.  They had lived there for years without number.  Past managements had  forgotten them; palace revolutions had taken no notice of them; the  history of France had run its course unknown to them; and nobody  recollected their existence.    The precious days sped in this way; and Raoul and Christine, by  affecting excessive interest in outside matters, strove awkwardly to  hide from each other the one thought of their hearts.  One fact was  certain, that Christine, who until then had shown herself the stronger  of the two, became suddenly inexpressibly nervous.  When on their  expeditions, she would start running without reason or else suddenly  stop; and her hand, turning ice-cold in a moment, would hold the young  man back.  Sometimes her eyes seemed to pursue imaginary shadows.  She  cried, \"This way,\" and \"This way,\" and \"This way,\" laughing a  breathless laugh that often ended in tears.  Then Raoul tried to speak,  to question her, in spite of his promises.  But, even before he had  worded his question, she answered feverishly:    \"Nothing ... I swear it is nothing.\"    Once, when they were passing before an open trapdoor on the stage,  Raoul stopped over the dark cavity.    \"You have shown me over the upper part of your empire, Christine, but  there are strange stories told of the lower part.  Shall we go down?\"    She caught him in her arms, as though she feared to see him disappear  down the black hole, and, in a trembling voice, whispered:    \"Never! ... I will not have you go there! ... Besides, it's not mine  ... EVERYTHING THAT IS UNDERGROUND BELONGS TO HIM!\"    Raoul looked her in the eyes and said roughly:    \"So he lives down there, does he?\"    \"I never said so ...  Who told you a thing like that?  Come away!  I  sometimes wonder if you are quite sane, Raoul ...  You always take  things in such an impossible way ...  Come along!  Come!\"    And she literally dragged him away, for he was obstinate and wanted to  remain by the trap-door; that hole attracted him.    Suddenly, the trap-door was closed and so quickly that they did not  even see the hand that worked it; and they remained quite dazed.    \"Perhaps HE was there,\" Raoul said, at last.    She shrugged her shoulders, but did not seem easy.    \"No, no, it was the 'trap-door-shutters.' They must do something, you  know ...  They open and shut the trap-doors without any particular  reason ...  It's like the 'door-shutters:' they must spend their time  somehow.\"    \"But suppose it were HE, Christine?\"    \"No, no!  He has shut himself up, he is working.\"    \"Oh, really!  He's working, is he?\"    \"Yes, he can't open and shut the trap-doors and work at the same time.\"  She shivered.    \"What is he working at?\"    \"Oh, something terrible! ... But it's all the better for us... When  he's working at that, he sees nothing; he does not eat, drink, or  breathe for days and nights at a time ... he becomes a living dead man  and has no time to amuse himself with the trap-doors.\" She shivered  again.  She was still holding him in her arms.  Then she sighed and  said, in her turn:    \"Suppose it were HE!\"    \"Are you afraid of him?\"    \"No, no, of course not,\" she said.    For all that, on the next day and the following days, Christine was  careful to avoid the trap-doors. Her agitation only increased as the  hours passed.  At last, one afternoon, she arrived very late, with her  face so desperately pale and her eyes so desperately red, that Raoul  resolved to go to all lengths, including that which he foreshadowed  when he blurted out that he would not go on the North Pole expedition  unless she first told him the secret of the man's voice.    \"Hush!  Hush, in Heaven's name! Suppose HE heard you, you unfortunate  Raoul!\"    And Christine's eyes stared wildly at everything around her.    \"I will remove you from his power, Christine, I swear it.  And you  shall not think of him any more.\"    \"Is it possible?\"    She allowed herself this doubt, which was an encouragernent, while  dragging the young man up to the topmost floor of the theater, far,  very far from the trap-doors.    \"I shall hide you in some unknown corner of the world, where HE can not  come to look for you.  You will be safe; and then I shall go away ...  as you have sworn never to marry.\"    Christine seized Raoul's hands and squeezed them with incredible  rapture.  But, suddenly becoming alarmed again, she turned away her  head.    \"Higher!\" was "]]]
