On the 21st of January, the anniversary of the death of Louis XVI. was  to be celebrated, according to custom, as a great festival of the  Republican calendar; and, conscious how distasteful the observance had  by this time become to all persons capable of reflection, the government  would fain have diverted attention from themselves, by assigning a  prominent part in the ceremonial to him, on whom, as they knew, all eyes  were sure to be fixed whenever he made his appearance. Napoleon  penetrated their motives. He remonstrated against the ceremony  altogether, as perpetuating the memory of a deed, perhaps unavoidable,  but not the less to be regretted. He told them that it was unworthy of a  great Republic to triumph, year after year, in the shedding of an  individual enemy's blood. They answered by reminding him that the  Athenians and Romans of old recorded, in similar festivals, the downfall  of the Pisistratidae and the exile of the Tarquins. He _might_ have  replied, that it is easier for a nation to renounce Christianity in  name, than to obliterate altogether the traces of its humanising  influence. But this view did not as yet occur to Napoleon--or if it had,  could not have been promulgated to their conviction. He stood on the  impolicy of the barbarous ceremony; and was at length, with difficulty,  persuaded to appear in it as a private member of the institute, along  with the rest of that association. His refusal to be there as the great  general of the Republic annoyed the timid Directory; and yet, on his  being recognised in his civic dress, and pointed out to new myriads of  observers, the effect which the government had desired to produce was  brought about in spite of all Buonaparte's reluctance. The purpose of  the assemblage was almost forgotten: the clamours of the people  converted it into another fete for Napoleon.    It has already been said that as early as October, 1797, the Directory  announced their intention of committing an army, destined for the  invasion of England, to the conqueror of Italy. He wholly disapproved of  their rashness in breaking off the negotiations of the preceding summer  with the English envoy, Lord Malmesbury, and, above all, of the insolent  abruptness of that procedure.[22] But the die was cast; and he willingly  accepted the appointment now pressed upon him by the government, who, in  truth, were anxious about nothing so much as to occupy his mind with the  matters of his profession, and so prevent him from taking a prominent  part in the civil business of the state. Solely owing to his celebrity  two of his brothers were already distinguished members of the  legislative bodies; and there could be no doubt that the gates of either  would fly open for his own admission, if he chose it, on the next  election.    Whatever views of ulterior ambition might have opened themselves to  Napoleon at this period, he well knew that the hour was not yet come, in  which he could serve his purpose better than by the pursuit of his  military career. According to De Bourienne, he had for some time  flattered himself that the law, which prevented a person so young as he  from being a director, might be waived in his favour; not doubting, we  may conclude, that such colleagues as Barras and Rewbell would soon sink  into the mere ministers of his will: but the opposition to this scheme  was so determined that it was never permitted to be proposed openly. The  Directory were popular with no party; but there were many parties; and,  numerically, probably the royalists were the strongest. The pure  republicans were still powerful: the army of Italy was distant and  scattered; that of the Rhine, far more numerous, and equally well  disciplined, had its own generals--men not yet in reputation  immeasurably inferior to himself; and, having been less fortunate than  their brethren in Italy, and consequently acquired less wealth, it was  no wonder that the soldiery of the Rhine regarded the others, if not  their leader, with some little jealousy. In Napoleon's own language,  \"the pear was not yet ripe.\"    He proceeded, therefore, to make a regular survey of the French coast  opposite to England, with the view of improving its fortifications, and  (ostensibly at least) of selecting the best points for embarking an  invading force. For this service he was eminently qualified; and many  local improvements of great importance, long afterwards effected, were  first suggested by him at this period. But, if he had really thought  otherwise beforehand (which M. de Bourienne denies), the result of his  examination was a perfect conviction that the time was not yet come for  invading England. He perceived that extensive and tedious preparations  were indispensable ere the French shipping on that coast could be put  into a condition for such an attempt; and the burst of loyalty which  the threat of invasion called forth in every part of Britain--the  devotion with which all classes of the people answered the appeal of the  government--the immense extent to which the regular and volunteer forces  were increased everywhere--these circumstances produced a strong  impression on his not less calculating than enterprising mind. He had  himself, in the course of the preceding autumn, suggested to the  minister for foreign affairs, the celebrated Talleyrand, the propriety  of making an effort against England in another quarter of the world:--of  seizing Malta, proceeding to occupy Egypt, and therein gaining at once a  territory capable of supplying to France the loss of her West Indian  colonies, and the means of annoying Great Britain in her Indian trade  and empire. To this scheme he now recurred: the East presented a field  of conquest and glory on which his imagination delighted to brood:  \"Europe,\" said he, \"is but a molehill, all the great glories have come  from Asia.\" The injustice of attacking the dominions of the Grand  Seignior, an old ally of France, formed but a trivial obstacle in the  eyes of the Directory: the professional opinion of Buonaparte that the  invasion of England, if attempted then, must fail, could not but carry  its due weight: the temptation of plundering Egypt and India was great;  and great, perhaps above all the rest, was the temptation of finding  employment for Napoleon at a distance from France. The Egyptian  expedition was determined on: but kept strictly secret. The attention of  England was still riveted on the coasts of Normandy and Picardy, between  which and Paris Buonaparte studiously divided his presence--while it was  on the borders of the Mediterranean that the ships and the troops really  destined for action were assembling.    Buonaparte, having rifled to such purpose the cabinets and galleries of  the Italian princes, was resolved not to lose the opportunity of  appropriating some of the rich antiquarian treasures of Egypt; nor was  it likely that he should undervalue the opportunities which his  expedition might afford, of extending the boundaries of science, by  careful observation of natural phenomena. He drew together therefore a  body of eminent artists and connoisseurs, under the direction of  _Monge_, who had managed his Italian collections: it was perhaps the  first time that a troop of _Savans_ (there were 100 of them) formed  part of the staff of an invading army.[23]    The various squadrons of the French fleet were now assembled at Toulon;  and everything seemed to be in readiness. Yet some time elapsed before  Napoleon joined the armament: and it is said by _Miot_ that he did all  he could to defer joining it as long as possible, in consequence of  certain obscure hopes which he had entertained of striking a blow at the  existing government, and remodelling it, to his own advantage, with the  assent, if not assistance, of Austria. This author adds that Barras,  having intercepted a letter of Buonaparte to Cobentzel, went to him late  one evening, and commanded him to join the fleet instantly, on pain of  being denounced as the enemy of the government; that the general ordered  his horses the same hour, and was on his way to Toulon ere midnight.  These circumstances may or may not be truly given. It is not doubtful  that the command of the Egyptian expedition was ultimately regarded,  both by Napoleon and the Directory, as a species of honourable  banishment. On reaching Toulon, Buonaparte called his army together, and  harangued them. \"Rome,\" he said, \"combated Carthage by sea as well as  land; and England was the Carthage of France.--He was come to lead them,  in the name of the Goddess of Liberty, across mighty seas, and into  remote regions, where their valour might achieve such glory and such  wealth as could never be looked for beneath the cold heavens of the  west. The meanest of his soldiers should receive seven acres of  land;\"--_where_ he mentioned not. His promises had not hitherto been  vain. The soldiery heard him with joy, and prepared to obey with  alacrity.    The English government, meanwhile, although they had no suspicion of the  real destination of the armament, had not failed to observe what was  passing in Toulon. They probably believed that the ships there assembled  were meant to take part in the great scheme of the invasion of England.  However this might have been, they had sent a considerable reinforcement  to Nelson, who then commanded on the Mediterranean station; and he, at  the moment when Buonaparte reached Toulon, was cruising within sight of  the port. Napoleon well knew that to embark in the presence of Nelson  would be to rush into the jaws of ruin; and waited until some accident  should relieve him from his terrible watcher. On the evening of the 19th  of May fortune favoured him. A violent gale drove the English off the  coast, and disabled some ships so much that Nelson was obliged to go  into the harbours of Sardinia to have them repaired. The French general  instantly commanded "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17587"],[0,"Field Hospital and Flying Column (#20)"],[1,"of peasants in, 33    Christmas Eve in Zyradow, 167    fare, 170    Cologne, arrival at, 85-87    Copenhagen, arrival at, 92      Danish-German soldiers as guards, 81    Danish welcome, a, 92    Death of a Breton soldier, 44    of a certain French count, 48, 49    Difference in French and German equipment, 47      Echevins of Brussels, 74    Empress Marie Federovna, interview with, 111    Equipment of French and German soldiers, 47    Expulsion of nurses and doctors from Brussels, 80      Firing at the Red Cross, 35    Fire-station hospital, 13, 19, 20    _Flandres Liberale_, 71    Flying Column, 125, 126    Fortress of St. Peter and St. Paul, 107    French convent, a, 60    prisoners as patients, 28, 29      German officers' behaviour at Herbesthal, 83    patients at fire-station, 20    patients at M----, 41    preparations for war, 33    surgeon at M----, 31    Grand Duchess Cyril's Hospital in Warsaw, 144      Hamburg, 88, 89    Hansen, Dr. Norman, 95    Harsh treatment of wounded, 42    Haparanda, 104    Herbesthal, search at, 83    Holland, rumoured war with, 31    \"Hoosh,\" 85    Hotel Cosmopolite, Copenhagen, 92    Hotel d'Europe, Warsaw, 124    Hotel at Lodz, 140      Ikons, 115, 173    Improvised hospital from theatre, 152    Infiladed trench, a, 162    Insects, 139    Inscription over gateway in Charleroi, 30    Interview with Dowager Empress of Russia, 111      St. John Ambulance Society, 5, 97    Jumet, the burning of, 21      Karungi, 104    Kiel Canal, 90      Liege, 65, 83    Lodz, 131    hospital at, 132-38    shelling of, 132, 135    London, first week of the war, 2    Louvain, destruction of, 81    refugees from, 11    Lowice, 150    Luggage problem, the, 126      Malines, 60, 63, 81    M---- Red Cross Hospital, 23    Committee, 28    dinner-time, 27    a night on duty, 23-24    the cure of, 44    Max, Monsieur, 10, 11, 55, 74    Maubeuge taken, 41    Muenster, breakfast at, 88      Neutrality of Belgium, 82    of Denmark, 100    Newspaper boy caught by Germans, 71, 72    Night in the trenches, a, 171-74    Nurses in Brussels, 8, 19, 66      Operation, a severe, 25, 26    Ostend in August, 7      Patients sent off to Germany, 41, 46    Petrograd, 107, 108    Pigeons, loss of, 55    Poem to British surgeons and nurses, 95    Poland, distress in, 97    Prisoners, Austrian, 148    French, 28    German, 148    Proclamation of Burgomaster of Brussels, 10, 11    forbidding \"a menacing look,\" 32    German announcing victories, 30, 67    of Von der Golst, 67, 68      Queen of Holland, 31      Radzivilow, 161    Castle, 151    Raphael, St., 104    Rawka, the river, 172    Refugees from Termonde and Louvain, 11    in Poland, 142    Registration of trained nurses, 4    Red Cross flag in Brussels, 55    hospital in Warsaw, 113-21    workers in Belgium, 23, 28, 46    Russian factory laws, 158    Russian Red Cross, Committee, 108    permission to serve, 97    Russian roads, 146    Russian sisterhoods, 109    Russian soldiers, 123    their relationship with their officers, 123      Scarcity of supplies, 24, 37, 169    Searched by German sentries, 62    Siberian ponies, 128    Skiernevice, 146    Skirmish between Belgian and German outposts, 59    Spies, 148    Stamps, issue of Belgian, 74    State registration of nurses, 4    St. Raphael, 104, 106    Stockholm, 102      Taube aeroplane, 147, 176    Termonde, refugees from, 11    Theatre at Skiernevice, 152    _Times_, the price of, 70    Tirlemont, 57, 82    Torchlight tattoo, 1    Turco soldiers, 29    Turkestan soldiers, 151, 152      Untrained nurses, the danger, 5, 120      Vendrup, 91    Voluntary Aid Detachments, 5      Waelheim, forts of, 73    Water-supply difficulties, 39    Warsaw, the city of, 121    the Red Cross Hospital, 113-20    Wavre St. Catherine, forts of, 73    Wounded French prisoners sent to Germany, 46    German soldiers at M----, 41    Zeppelins, 81    Zouave patients, 45    Zyradow Hospital, 158      _Printed by_ BALLANTYNE, HANSON & CO.
