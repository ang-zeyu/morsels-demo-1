Certainly his  education has been very different from that of most men in his  condition of life, and I should have taken him for a gentleman, who  had got into some scrape and run away, had it not been that he  seems to have been regularly apprenticed to his trade. Still, there  is something a little mysterious about him. I asked him casually  what part of the country he came from. He hesitated a moment, and  then said, 'From the south of England.' Of course, I did not ask  any further questions, as it was clear he did not care about naming  the precise locality, or he would not have given so vague an  answer. I feel as deeply indebted to him as you do.\"    Mr. Hudson nodded. Only the evening before arriving at Cape Town,  Captain Wilson had spoken to him on the matter of his affection for  his daughter, and had asked his permission to speak to Frances.  They had known each other in the colony, but had not been intimate  until thrown together on board the Paramatta. Seeing that she was  an only child, and that her father was considered one of the  wealthiest squatters in the colony, Captain Wilson had feared that  Mr. Hudson would not approve of him as a suitor; and had therefore  broached the subject to him, before speaking to her. Mr. Hudson,  however, had raised no objections.    \"You have taken a manly and proper course, in speaking to me  first,\" he said; \"just what I should have expected from you. I own  that, with the fortune the girl will have some day, I have always  looked for her making what they call a good match, and settling  down in the old country; but I may tell you that while she has been  in Europe she has had several opportunities of so doing, if she  would have taken them. She did not think fit to do so, and I have  always made up my mind not to influence her in any way, providing  she didn't fix her choice upon one whose character I disapproved.  Certainly I have no reasons for so doing, in the present case. Your  character stands high in the colony; and personally, as you are  well aware, I like you exceedingly.    \"What Frances' feelings in the matter are, I have no means of  knowing. There is no doubt she likes you, but as to anything more,  it is for you to find out. You will have plenty of time, between  this and Sydney. Anyhow, you have my hearty approval of your  wooing.    \"I think, between ourselves you know, you must not expect, at  first, any very cordial approval on the part of her mother. She had  an idea, you know, that Frances would marry a duke at least, and an  offer from a prince of the blood would not have surprised her. It  is a great disappointment, to her, that she should have returned  unmarried; and she has already been talking to me about our  returning to England, in another couple of years. So she will not  take quite kindly to it, at first; but you mustn't mind that. Fond  of Frances as she is, she will soon come round, if she finds that  the girl's happiness is really concerned in the matter.    \"Take my advice, and don't push it till we get near the end of the  voyage. If Frances says yes, she is the sort of girl to stick to  it; and as I am with you, you may be quite sure it will come right  in the long run; but we might not have a very pleasant time of it  during the remainder of the voyage, you know, and as things have  gone on so pleasantly, it would be a pity to spoil them.\"    Thus it was that Mr. Hudson nodded, when the young officer of the  constabulary said that his indebtedness to Reuben was equal to his  own.    \"Yes,\" he said, \"if it had been one of the sailors, I could have  set the matter right by drawing a big cheque, and I shouldn't have  cared how big; but with this young fellow I do not quite see my  way. However, I will shift the responsibility, by leaving the  matter in Frances' hands--women are much better hands at things of  this sort, that require a light touch, than we are. I do not wonder  that she and Miss Furley are shaken. I feel shaken myself. I shall  never forget that scene, and the two girls standing there, and that  wild Malay rushing at them. My legs seemed to give way under me,  and I thought I should have fallen down.\"    \"I felt bad myself, sir,\" Captain Wilson said. \"I have been in some  tough fights, with bush rangers and natives; but I never had that  sort of feeling before.    \"One ran, but one felt it was no use running, as all must be over  before we could get there. When it was over, I felt as weak as a  child.\"    \"Don't let us talk any more about it,\" Mr. Hudson said, rising. \"I  doubt whether I shall get a wink of sleep now; and I am sure I  sha'n't, if we go on talking any more about it. Let us take a turn,  and have a stiff glass of brandy and water afterwards, to settle  our nerves before turning in.\"    The passengers by the Paramatta were up early in the morning, for  the ship was to sail at nine. But early as they were, Reuben was  before them; and on Mr. Hudson inquiring about him, as he turned  out, he was informed that he had already gone on board the ship.    The two girls both looked pale, when they came down to their early  breakfast. Both declared, however, that they had slept well.    \"You must give us time, dad, to get up our roses,\" Frances Hudson  said, in reply to her father's remarks as to their appearance. \"I  have no doubt a few days at sea will do it; but of course, it is  only right and proper that young ladies should be pale, after going  through such an adventure as we had yesterday.    \"But do not let us talk about it,\" she said, with a shudder. \"I  should like not to be able to think about it, again, for six  months. You used to say, dad, that I was plucky, because I wasn't  afraid of wild cattle, and not very afraid of the natives or bush  rangers; but I am sure I cannot lay claim to any special courage in  future, for no one in the world could feel more frightened than I  did, yesterday.\"    \"Well, my dear, you were no worse than anyone else, for everyone  else bolted at the first alarm. The way that street was cleared was  something marvellous.\"    \"Yes, dad; but I was too frightened to run. Not that it would have  been any use if I had, for he was close to us before we knew what  was the matter; and if I could have run, I don't think Emma could.\"    \"No, indeed,\" Miss Furley said. \"I had no idea of running and, even  had there been plenty of time, I am sure I could not have got out  of the way. Somehow I seemed to lose all power to move. I had just  shut my eyes, and thought it was all over, when there was a shout  and a rush, and I saw the Malay roll over; and then I made a snatch  at Frances, and rolled over, too.\"    \"It was a terrible moment,\" Mr. Hudson said. \"But I agree, with  Frances, that it is better for you to try and think nothing more  about it, until you have perfectly recovered your health and  spirits.\"    \"I hear, dad, that the young man that saved us has gone on board  ship. I asked, directly I was up, because I wanted to see him.\"    \"And I expect, my dear, that he slipped away because he didn't want  to see you. It sounds rude, doesn't it? But I can perfectly  understand it.\"    \"So can I,\" the girl agreed. \"Did you see him this morning?\"    \"No, my dear. I came downstairs only a minute or two before you  did, and then found that he was gone.\"    \"Have you thought over what you are going to do, dad, for him?\"    \"Wilson and I have talked it over, Frances, but at present we don't  see our way. It is too serious a matter to make up our minds in a  hurry. Your mother is in favour of giving him a handsome present;  but I don't think, myself, that that would do. Men who will do such  deeds as that are not the sort of men to be paid by money.\"    \"Oh no, dad! Surely not that. Any other possible way, but not  money.\"    \"No, my dear; so I thought. I have chatted it over with Wilson, and  we have agreed that the best plan is to leave it entirely in your  hands.\"    \"I will think it over, dad,\" the girl said gravely. \"It is a  serious thing. We owe him our lives, and the least we can do is not  to hurt his feelings, by the way in which we try to show our  gratitude.\"    Reuben had slept well; and on waking, soon after daylight, jumped  at once out of bed; and was glad to feel that, except for a certain  amount of weakness in the legs, and stiffness in his wounds, he was  all right again. He dressed quietly and, as soon as he heard  persons moving about in the hotel, made his way down to the shore,  and sat down there to wait for a boat from the ship; which was  lying some distance out, and would, he was sure, be sending off  early, as there would be many things to bring on board before she  sailed.    It was not long before he saw the men descending the gangway to the  boat alongside, which was soon rowing towards the shore. As she  approached, Reuben saw the steward and first mate, sitting in the  stern seats; and when the officer jumped ashore, his eye fell on  Reuben.    \"Ah, Whitney,\" he said, \"I am glad to see you about. When the  captain came off, last night, he told me all about your gallant  rescue of the two ladies. I am sorry to see you bandaged up so  much. The captain said you had some nasty cuts, but I didn't think  they were so bad.\"    \"They are nothing to speak about, sir,\" Reuben replied, \"although  you would think so, from seeing those bandages all over one side of  the face, and my arm in a sling; but they are no great depth, and  don't hurt to speak of. They were clean cuts with a sharp edge, and  don't hurt half as much as many a knock I have had, with a hammer.\"    \"Well, we all feel proud of you, my lad. It isn't everyone who  would face a Malay running amuck, without weapons, I can tell you.\"    \"I think any English sailor would do so, sir, if he saw the Malay  rushing down upon two ladies. There was no time to think about  danger, one way or"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20034"],[0,"Scottish Ghost Stories (#20)"],[1," western horizon, where the heavens were washed with alternate streaks  of gold and red and pink--the colour of each streak excessively  brilliant in the centre, but paling towards the edges. Here and there  were golden, pink-tipped clouds and crimson islets surrounded with  seas of softest blue. And outside the limits of this sun-kissed pale,  the blue of the sky gradually grew darker and darker, until its line  was altogether lost in the black shadows of night that, creeping over  the lone mountain-tops in the far east, slowly swept forward. Wafted  by the gentle breeze came the dull moaning and whispering of the pine  trees, the humming of the wind through the telephone wires, and the  discordant cawing of the crows. And it seemed to Martha, as she sat  there and peered out into the garden, that over the whole atmosphere  of the place had come a subtle and hostile change--a change in the  noises of the trees, the birds, the wind; a change in the  flower-scented ether; a change, a most marked and emphatic change, in  the shadows. What was it? What was this change? Whence did it  originate? What did it portend? A slight noise, a most trivial noise,  attracted Martha's attention to the room; she looked round and was  quite startled to see how dark it had grown. In the old days, when she  had scoffed at ghosts, she would as soon have been in the dark as in  the light, the night had no terrors for her; but now--now since those  awful occurrences last year, all was different, and as she peered  apprehensively about her, her flesh crawled. What was there in that  corner opposite, that corner hemmed in on the one side by the  cupboard--how she hated cupboards, particularly when they had shiny  surfaces on which were reflected all sorts of curious things--and the  chest of drawers on the other. It was a shadow, only a shadow, but of  what? She searched the room everywhere to find its material  counterpart, and at last discovered it in the nurse's shawl which hung  over the back of a chair. Then she laughed, and would have gone on  laughing, for she tried to persuade herself that laughter banished  ghosts, when suddenly something else caught her eyes. What was it? An  object that glittered evilly like two eyes. She got up in a state of  the most hideous fascination and walked towards it. Then she laughed  again--it was a pair of scissors. The nurse's scissors--clean, bright,  and sharp. Why did she pick them up and feel the blades so caressingly  with her thumb? Why did she glance from them to the baby? Why? In the  name of God, why? Frightful ideas laid hold of her mind. She tried to  chase them away but they quickly returned. The scissors, why were they  in her fingers? Why could not she put them down? For what were they  intended? Cutting! cutting thread, and tape,--and throats! Throats!  And she giggled hysterically at the bare notion. But what was this  round her waist--this shadowy arm-like object! She looked fearfully  round, and her soul died within her as she encountered the  malevolent, gleeful eyes of the sinister piper, pressed closely  against her face. Was it she he wanted this time--she, or--or whom--in  the name of all that was pitiable?    Desperately, as if all the lives in the universe and the future of her  soul were at stake, did she struggle to free herself from his  grasp--but in vain; every fibre, every muscle of her body was  completely at his will. On and on he pushed her, until foot by foot,  inch by inch, she approached the cradle, and all the while his hellish  voice was breathing the vilest of inspirations into her brain. At last  she stood by the side of the baby, and bent over it. What a darling!  What a dear! What a duck! A sweet, pretty, innocent, prattling duck!  How like her mother--how like her handsome brother--how like  herself--very, very like herself! How every one loved it--how every  one worshipped it--how (and here the grey face beside her chuckled)  every one would miss it! How pink its toes--how fat its calves--how  chubby its little palms--how bonny its cheeks--and how white, how  gloriously, heavenly, snowy white--its throat! And she stretched  forth one of her stubby, inartistic fingers and played with its flesh.  Then she glanced furtively at the scissors, and smiled.    It was soon done, soon over, and she and the grey-faced piper danced a  minuet in the moonbeams; afterwards he piped a farewell dirge,--a  wild, weird, funereal dirge, and, marching slowly backwards, his dark,  gleaming eyes fixed gloatingly on hers, disappeared through the  window. Then the reaction set in, and Martha raved and shrieked till  every one in the house flew to the rescue.    Of course, no one--saving her father and mother--believed her. Ernest,  his wife, and the servants attributed her bloody act to jealousy; the  law--to madness; and she subsequently journeyed from Donaldgowerie to  a criminal lunatic asylum, where the recollection of all she had done  soon killed her. This was the climax. Mr. Whittingen sold  Donaldgowerie, and a new house was shortly afterwards erected in its  stead.                                  CASE XIII        THE FLOATING HEAD OF THE BENRACHETT INN,        NEAR THE PERTH ROAD, DUNDEE      Some years ago, when I was engaged in collecting cases for a book I  contemplated publishing, on _Haunted Houses in England and Wales_, I  was introduced to an Irish clergyman, whose name I have forgotten, and  whom I have never met since. Had the incident he related taken place  in England or Wales, I should have noted it down carefully, but as it  occurred in Scotland (and I had no intention then of bringing out a  volume on Scottish phantasms), I did not do so.    My memory, however, I can assure my readers, in spite of the many  ghost tales committed to it,--for scarcely a day passes that I do not  hear one,--seldom fails, and the Irish clergyman's story, which I am  about to relate, comes back to me now with startling vividness.    One summer evening, early in the eighties, Mr. Murphy--the name by  which I will designate the originator of this story--and his wife  arrived in Dundee. The town was utterly unknown to them, and they were  touring Scotland for the first time. Not knowing where to put up for  the night, and knowing no one to whom they could apply for  information, they consulted a local paper, and from the long list of  hotels and boarding-houses advertised therein selected the Benrachett  Inn, near the Perth Road, as being the one most likely to meet their  modest requirements. They were certainly not disappointed with the  exterior of the hotel they had chosen, for as soon as they saw it they  exclaimed simultaneously, \"What a delightful old place!\" And old it  certainly was, for the many-gabled, oaken structure and projecting  windows unquestionably indicated the sixteenth century, whilst, to  enhance the effect and give it a true touch in detail of \"ye ancient  times,\" a huge antique lantern was hung over the entrance. Nor did the  interior impress them less favourably. The rooms were large, and low,  the ceilings, walls, floors, and staircase all of oak. The  diamond-lattice windows, and narrow, tortuous passages, and  innumerable nooks and crannies and cupboards, created an atmosphere of  combined quaintness and comfort that irresistibly appealed to the  Murphys. Viewed under the searching rays of the sun, and cheered by  the voices of the visitors, the interior of the house, for artistic  taste and cheerfulness, would indeed be hard to beat; but, as Mrs.  Murphy's eyes wandered up the stairs and down the corridors, she was  filled with misgivings as to how the place would strike her at night.    Though not nervous naturally, and by no means superstitious, at night,  when the house was dark and silent, and the moon called forth the  shadows, she was not without that feeling of uneasiness which most  people--even avowed sceptics, experience when passing the night in  strange and novel quarters.    The room they engaged--I cannot say selected, as, the hotel being  full, they had \"Hobson's choice\"--was at the end of a very long  passage, at the back of the house, and overlooking the yard. It was a  large apartment, and in one of its several recesses stood the bed, a  gigantic, ebony four-poster, with spotlessly clean valance, and, what  was of even greater importance, well-aired sheets. The other furniture  in the room, being of the same sort as that in the majority of  old-fashioned hostels, needs no description; but a fixture in the  shape of a cupboard, a deep, dark cupboard, let into the wall facing  the bed, instantly attracted Mrs. Murphy's attention. There is always  something interesting in cupboards, particularly old and roomy  cupboards, when it is night-time and one is about to get into bed. It  is then that they suggest all manner of fascinating possibilities.    It was to this cupboard, then, that Mrs. Murphy paid the greatest  attention, before commencing to undress prior to getting into bed. She  poked about in it for some moments, and then, apparently satisfied  that no one was hidden there, continued her investigation of the room.  Mr. Murphy did not assist--he pleaded fatigue, and sat on the corner  of the bed munching a gingerbread and reading the _Dundee Advertiser_  till the operation was over. He then helped Mrs. Murphy unpack their  portmanteau, and, during the process, whiled away so much time in  conversation, that they were both startled when a clock from some  adjacent church solemnly boomed twelve. They were then seized with  something approaching a panic, and hastened to disrobe.    \"I wish we had a night-light, John,\" Mrs. Murphy said, as she got up  from her prayers. \"I suppose it wouldn't do to keep one of the candles  burning. I am not exactly afraid, only I don't fancy being left in the  dark. I had a curious sensation when I was in the cupboard just now--I  can't exactly explain it--but I feel now that I would like"]]]
