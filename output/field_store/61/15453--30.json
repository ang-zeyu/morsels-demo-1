At the  end of 1828, the youthful Gladstone had composed a long letter, of which  the manuscript survives, to a Liverpool newspaper, earnestly contesting  its appalling proposition that 'man has no more control over his belief,  than he has over his stature or his colour,' and beseeching the editor  to try Leslie's _Short Method with the Deists_, if he be unfortunate  enough to doubt the authority of the Bible. At Oxford his fervour  carried him beyond the fluent tract to a personal decision. On August  4th, 1830, the entry is this:--'Began Thucydides. Also working up  Herodotus. [Greek: exertumenos]. Construing Thucydides at night. Uncomfortable  again and much distracted with doubts as to my future line of conduct.  God direct me. I am utterly blind. Wrote a very long letter to my dear  father on the subject of my future profession, wishing if possible to  bring the question to an immediate and final settlement.' The letter is  exorbitant in length, it is vague, it is obscure; but the appeal  contained in it is as earnest as any appeal from son to parent on such a  subject ever was, and it is of special interest as the first definite  indication alike of the extraordinary intensity of his religious  disposition, and of that double-mindedness, that division of sensibility  between the demands of spiritual and of secular life, which remained  throughout one of the marking traits of his career. He declares his  conviction that his duty, alike to man as a social being, and as a  rational and reasonable being to God, summons him with a voice too  imperative to be resisted, to forsake the ordinary callings of the world  and to take Upon himself the clerical office. The special need of  devotion to that office, he argues, must be plain to any one who 'casts  his eye over the moral wilderness of the world, who contemplates the  pursuits, desires, designs, and principles of the beings that move so  busily in it to and fro, without an object beyond the finding food for  it, mental or bodily, for the present moment.' This letter the reader  will find in full elsewhere.[53] The missionary impulse, the yearning  for some apostolic destination, the glow of self-devotion to a supreme  external will, is a well-known element in the youth of ardent natures of  either sex. In a thousand forms, sometimes for good, sometimes for evil,  such a mood has played its part in history. In this case, as in many  another, the impulse in its first shape did not endure, but in essence  it never faded.    His father replied as a wise man was sure to do, almost with sympathy,  with entire patience, and with thorough common sense. The son dutifully  accepts the admonition that it is too early to decide so grave an issue,  and that the immediate matter is the approaching performance in the  examination schools. 'I highly approve,' his father had written (Nov.  8th, 1830), 'your proposal to leave undetermined the profession you are  to follow, until you return from the continent and complete your  education in all respects. You will then have seen more of the world and  have greater confidence in the choice you may make; for it will then  rest wholly with yourself, having our advice whenever you may wish for  it.' The critical issue was now finally settled. At almost equal length,  and in parts of this second letter no less vague and obscure than the  first, but with more concentrated power, Mr. Gladstone tells his father  (Jan. 17th, 1832) how the excitement has subsided, but still he sees at  hand a great crisis in the history of mankind. New principles, he says,  prevail in morals, politics, education. Enlightened self-interest is  made the substitute for the old bonds of unreasoned attachment, and  under the plausible maxim that knowledge is power, one kind of ignorance  is made to take the place of another kind. Christianity teaches that the  head is to be exalted through the heart, but Benthamism maintains that  the heart is to be amended through the head. The conflict proceeding in  parliament foreshadows a contest for the existence of the church  establishment, to be assailed through its property. The whole foundation  of society may go. Under circumstances so formidable, he dares not look  for the comparative calm and ease of a professional life. He must hold  himself free of attachment to any single post and function of a  technical nature. And so--to make the long story short--'My own desires  for future life are exactly coincident with yours, in so far as I am  acquainted with them; believing them to be a _profession_ of the law,  with a view substantially to studying the constitutional branch of it,  and a subsequent experiment, as time and circumstances might offer, on  what is termed public life.' 'It tortures me,' he had written to his  brother John (August 29th, 1830), 'to think of an inclination opposed to  that of my beloved father,' and this was evidently one of the  preponderant motives in his final decision.    In the same letter, while the fire of apostolic devotion was still  fervid within him, he had penned a couple of sentences that contain  words of deeper meaning than he could surely know:--'I am willing to  persuade myself that in spite of other longings which I often feel, my  heart is prepared to yield other hopes and other desires for this--of  being permitted to be the humblest of those who may be commissioned to  set before the eyes of man, still great even, in his ruins, the  magnificence and the glory of Christian truth. Especially as I feel that  my temperament is so excitable, that I should fear giving up my mind to  other subjects which have ever proved sufficiently alluring to me, and  which I fear would make my life a fever of unsatisfied longings and  expectations.' So men unconsciously often hint an oracle of their lives.  Perhaps these forebodings of a high-wrought hour may in other hues have  at many moments come back to Mr. Gladstone's mind, even in the full  sunshine of a triumphant career of duty, virtue, power, and renown.                                 MEDITATIONS    The entry in his diary, suggested by the return of his birthday (Dec.  29, 1831), closes with the words, 'This has been my debating society  year, now, I fancy, done with. Politics are fascinating to me; perhaps  too fascinating.' Higher thoughts than this press in upon him:--         Industry of a kind and for a time there has been, but the industry       of necessity, not of principle. I would fain believe that my       sentiments in religion have been somewhat enlarged and       untrammelled, but if this be true, my responsibility is indeed       augmented, but wherein have my deeds of duty been proportionally       modified?... One conclusion theoretically has been much on my       mind--it is the increased importance and necessity and benefit of       prayer--of the life of obedience and self-sacrifice. May God use me       as a vessel for his own purposes, of whatever character and results       in relation to myself.... May the God who loves us all, still       vouchsafe me a testimony of His abiding presence in the protracted,       though well nigh dormant life of a desire which at times has risen       high in my soul, a fervent and a buoyant hope that I might work an       energetic work in this world, and by that work (whereof the worker       is only God) I might grow into the image of the Redeemer.... It       matters not whether the sphere of duty be large or small, but may       it be duly filled. May those faint and languishing embers be       kindled by the truth of the everlasting spirit into a living and a       life-giving flame.    Every reader will remember how, just two hundred years before, the  sublimest of English poets had on his twenty-third birthday closed the  same self-reproach for sluggishness of inward life, with the same  aspiration:--      Yet be it less or more, or soon or slow,    It shall be still in strictest measure even    To that same lot however mean or high,    Towards which time leads me and the will of heaven.    All is, if I have grace to use it so,    As ever in my great taskmaster's eye.    Two generations after he had quitted the university, Mr. Gladstone  summed up her influence upon him:--         Oxford had rather tended to hide from me the great fact that       liberty is a great and precious gift of God, and that human       excellence cannot grow up in a nation without it. And yet I do not       hesitate to say that Oxford had even at this time laid the       foundations of my liberalism. School pursuits had revealed little;       but in the region of philosophy she had initiated if not inured me       to the pursuit of truth as an end of study. The splendid integrity       of Aristotle, and still more of Butler, conferred upon me an       inestimable service. Elsewhere I have not scrupled to speak with       severity of myself, but I declare that while in the arms of Oxford,       I was possessed through and through with a single-minded and       passionate love of truth, with a virgin love of truth, so that,       although I might be swathed in clouds of prejudice there was       something of an eye within, that might gradually pierce them.

[35] After Peel had begun his career, Jackson gave him a piece of advice  that would have pleased Mr. Gladstone:--'Let no day pass without your  having Homer in your hand. Elevate your own mind by continual meditation  on the vastness of his comprehension and the unerring accuracy of all  his conceptions. If you will but read him four or five times over every  year, in a half a dozen years you will know him by heart, and he well  deserves it.'--Parker's _Life of Sir R. Peel_, i. p. 28.
