To the Present Time, Volume 12 (of 12) (#20)"],[1,"OF MEHEMIT ALI]    But Egypt had no more powerful enemies than the Mamluks, who, since  1808, had kept the country in a constant state of agitation. Mehemet Ali  therefore determined to put an end to this civil war, root and branch,  and to exterminate completely this formidable adversary. He did not  hesitate in the choice of means. War would not have succeeded; murder,  therefore, was the only alternative, and the viceroy adopted this  horrible means of accomplishing his designs. He invited the entire  Mam-luk corps to a banquet, which he proposed to give in the Citadel  Palace in honour of the departure of Tussun Pasha for Mecca. This palace  is built upon a rock, and is reached by perpendicular paths. On May 1st,  the day fixed upon for the festivity, Mehemet Ali received his guests  in great splendour and with a cordiality calculated to dispel any  suspicions the Mamluks might have entertained. At the conclusion of  the banquet, as they were returning home, they were fired upon in the  narrow pass, where retreat and resistance were perfectly impossible.  Thus, after having defeated the bravest troops in the world, they died  obscurely, ingloriously, and unable to defend themselves. Hassan Bey,  brother of the celebrated Elfi, spurred his horse to a gallop, rode over  the parapets, and fell, bruised and bleeding, at the foot of the walls,  where some Arabs saved him from certain death by aiding his flight. The  few who escaped massacre took refuge in Syria or Dongola.    Whilst this horrible drama was being enacted in Cairo, similar scenes  were taking place in those provinces whose governors had received  stringent commands to butcher every remaining Mamluk in Egypt. THUs  nearly all perished, and that famous corps was destroyed for ever.    Although Mehemet Ali had no doubt whatever as to the intentions which  had prompted the Porte to organise the expedition against the Wahabis,  he hastened to prepare for this lengthy war. Mehemet himself was in  command of an army in the Hedjaz when Latif Pasha arrived, bearing a  firman of investiture to the pashalic of Egypt. Luckily, Mehemet Ali on  his departure had left behind him, as vekyl, a trustworthy man devoted  to his interests, namely, Mehemet Bey. This faithful minister pretended  to favour the claims of Latif Pasha, and then arrested him, and had him  publicly executed.    From this moment the real reign of Mehemet Ali begins. Possessed of a  fertile country, he promptly began to consider the ways and means of  improving the deplorable state of its finances, and to grasp all the  resources which agriculture and commerce could yield for the realisation  of his ambitious schemes. Nothing must be neglected in the government of  a country for so many years the scene of incessant warfare; the labourer  must be made to return to the field he had deserted during the time  of trouble; political and civil order must be reestablished so as to  reassure the inhabitants, and secure the resumption of long abandoned  industries.    The most important matter was to restrain the depredations of the  Bedouins, and, to assure the obedience of these hitherto unsubdued  tribes, he kept their sheikhs as hostages: at the same time he checked  the delinquencies of the Kopts, in whose hands the government of the  territories had been from time immemorial. A sure and certain peace thus  having been ensured to the interior of the country, the pasha turned his  attention to another enterprise, the accomplishment of which is always  somewhat difficult after a lengthy crisis. He wished to encourage and  regulate the payment of taxes without hindering the financial operations  of private individuals. To this end, he re-established the custom of  receiving tribute in kind, and to support the payment of this tribute he  organised the export trade. A thousand vessels built at his own expense  ploughed the waters of the Nile in all directions, and conveyed Egyptian  produce to the shores of the Mediterranean, where huge warehouses stored  the goods destined for foreign countries.    Mehemet Ali preserved a continual intercourse with foreign merchants,  and the country owed many fortunate innovations to these relations:  agriculture was enriched by several productions hitherto unknown.  A Frenchman, M. Jumel, introduced improvements in the production of  cotton, whilst M. Drovetti, the pasha's tried friend, helped to further  the establishment of manufactories by his advice and great experience of  men and things. Before long, cotton mills were built, cloth factories, a  sugar refinery, rum distillery, and saltpetre works erected. The foreign  trade despatched as much as seven million _ardebs_ of cereals every  year, and more than six hundred thousand bales of cotton. In return,  European gold flowed into the treasury of this industrious pasha, and  the revenues of Egypt, which hitherto had never exceeded $150,000,000,  were more than doubled in 1816.    The very slight success which Mehemet Ali had obtained when commanding  the irregular forces during the expedition against the Wahabis decided  him to put a long-cherished idea into execution, namely, to organise an  army on European lines. Henceforth this became the sole occupation of  the enterprising pasha and the exclusive goal of his perseverance.  The Nizam-Jedyd was proclaimed in the month of July, 1815, and all the  troops were ordered to model themselves after the pattern of the French  army.    This large undertaking, which in 1807 had cost Selim III. his life,  proved almost as fatal to Mehemet Ali. A terrible insurrection broke  out amongst the alien soldiers, who principally composed the army; the  infuriated troops rose against the tyrant and the unbeliever, the palace  was pillaged, and the pasha had scarcely time to seek the shelter of his  citadel. His only means of saving his life and recovering his authority  was solemnly to promise to abandon his plan. Mehemet Ali therefore  deferred his military schemes and awaited the opportunity to test its  success upon the natives, who would be far more easily managed than the  excitable strangers, brought up as they were on the old traditions of  the Okaz and the Mamluks. The war which still raged in Arabia gave  him the means of ridding himself of the most indomitable men, whom he  despatched to Hedjaz under the command of Ibrahim Pasha, his eldest son.    Now came success to console Mehemet Ali for the failure of his  reformatory plans. After a long series of disasters, Ibrahim succeeded,  in the year 1818, in taking Abd Allah Ibn-Sonud, the chief of the  Wahabis, prisoner. He sent him to the Great Pasha, a name often applied  to Mehemet Ali in Egypt, at Cairo, bearing a portion of the jewels  taken from the temple at Mecca. The unfortunate man was then taken  to Constantinople, where his punishment bore testimony to the victory  rather than the clemency of his conquerors.    In reward for his services, the sultan sent Ibrahim a mantle of honour  and named him Pasha of Egypt, which title conferred on him the highest  rank among the viziers and pashas, and even placed him above his own  father in the hierarchy of the dignitaries of the Turkish Empire. At the  same time Mehemet Ali was raised to the dignity of khan, an attribute  of the Ottomans, and the greatest distinction obtainable for a pasha,  inasmuch as it was formerly exclusively reserved for the sovereigns of  the Crimea.    [Illustration: 157.jpg THE COTTON PLANT]    After destroying Daryeh, the capital of Nedj, Mehemet Ali conceived  the idea of extending his possessions in the interior of Africa, and  of subduing the country of the negroes, where he hoped to find much  treasure. He accordingly sent his son, Ishmail Pasha, with five thousand  men, upon this expedition, which ended most disastrously with the murder  of Ishmail and his guard by Melek Nemr, and the destruction of the  remainder of his forces.    In the year 1824, Sultan Mahmud, realising the impossibility of putting  down the Greek insurrection by his own unaided forces, bent his pride  sufficiently to ask help of his vassal Mehemet Ali. Mehemet was now in  possession of a well-drilled army and a well-equipped fleet, which were  placed at the service of the sultan, who promised him in return the  sovereignty of Crete, the pashalic of Syria, and possibly the reversion  of Morea for his son Ibrahim. The Greeks, deceived by their easy  successes over the undisciplined Turkish hosts, failed to realise  the greatness of the danger which threatened them. The Egyptian fleet  managed, without serious opposition, to enter the Archipelago, and, in  December, 1824, Ibrahim, to whom Mehemet Ali had entrusted the supreme  command of the expedition, established his base in Crete, within  striking distance of the Greek mainland. The following February he  landed with four thousand regular infantry and five hundred cavalry at  Modon, in the south of Morea.    The Greeks were utterly unable to hold their own against the  well-disciplined fellaheen of Ibrahim Bey, and, before the end of  the year, the whole of the Peloponnesus, with the exception of a few  strongholds, was at the mercy of the invader, and the report was spread  that Ibrahim intended to deport the Greek population and re-people the  country with Moslem negroes and Arabs.    The only barrier opposed to the entire extinction of the Greek  population was their single stronghold of Missolonghi, which was now  besieged by Rashid Pasha and the Turks. If Ibrahim had joined his forces  with the besieging army of the Turks, Missolonghi could hardly have  resisted their combined attack, and the Greek race would have been in  danger of suffering annihilation.    Meanwhile the Great Powers of Europe were seriously concerned with  this threatened destruction of the Greeks. England proposed a joint  intervention in defence of Greece on the part of the Powers, but Russia  desired to act alone. A huge army"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17354"],[0,"Cave Regions of the Ozarks and Black Hills (#20)"],[1,"Blue Grotto necessarily stands beyond  comparison because in all the known world there is nothing like it. The  forms of crystal are chiefly aragonite.    From here we pass to the \"Chamber de Norcutt,\" which would be considered  a very handsome room if it had no superiors: and the same can be said of  Union College, in which, however, is the Fan Rock to claim special  notice; an immense piece of fallen box work shaped like a lady's fan  half opened.    An imposing vestibule leads into the extensive but rather dreary  Catacombs, from which we crawled through a little hole into the M.W.A.  Hall, emerging at the top of a steep but not high slope covered with the  smooth yellow crust of calcite encountered at other places, and in  trying to make a dexterous turn so as to go down feet first, the  descent was accomplished with uncalculated suddenness and an unsought  but liberal collection of bruises. This, however, was not a happening of  the unexpected and could have no attention amid scenes of wonder and  beauty, and we were close to the Geysers. From a scientific point of  view this is the most important portion of the cave, for here is an  indisputable proof that the water in the cave was hot and that it was  subject to geyser action. The surrounding region is covered with the  crust already described, and at the top of a gentle elevation is thrown  up in the unmistakable form of geyser cones; there being two near  together on the surface described, with a third visible through one of  these on a slightly lower level, this one being a new discovery, as it  had escaped observation until we called attention to it.    These small cones show that after the degree of heat and the volume of  water had become reduced to the merest fraction of their former  greatness, they continued their accustomed work here in the depth of the  earth long after the once grand old geyser had ceased to show an outward  sign of life. When the water finally became so reduced even here that  the steam could no longer force it through, or to these latest vents,  the last rising vapors fringed their edges with a beautiful snow-white  border of crystallized carbonate of lime as fine and soft as a band of  swan's down, which it resembles. In the pure, still atmosphere of the  eighth level, almost five hundred feet beneath the entrance, this silent  proof of ancient action will endure for the admiration and instruction  of many generations yet to come. Few mortals will ever be honored with  memorials so lasting or so convincing of vanished power.    Proceeding on the journey the next chamber is the A.O.U.W. Hall, a  large, irregular room, by the rise of which a return to the seventh  level is accomplished; and the next entered is the Tabernacle, not at  all resembling the last, although a similar description would be  correct.    Now is reached what many consider the cave's greatest charm, The Pearly  Gates. And marvelously beautiful it certainly is.    Approaching by a slightly lower level, we see a gateway opening between  large rocks that light up with the soft lustre and varied tints of  mammoth pearls. A wonderful effect is produced by the white calcite  crystal spread in unequal thickness over the dark surface of the  encrusted rocks. Just without the gate is a short but not golden  stairway leading to it, and immediately within is the Saint's Rest, a  chamber of moderate size beautified by another great rock on which are  combined the warm, pearly glow of calcite and the cold glitter of frost  by the later addition of lime carbonate vapor-crystals to the calcium  carbonate aragonite.    Next beyond is the chamber containing the Standing Rock behind which Mr.  Johnstone made his famous discovery of the concealed pin-head. It is an  immense great fallen rock on whose dark surface are scattered  transparent flake-like crystals of satin spar, resembling the congealed  drops of a summer shower. The mind-reader entered the chamber by the way  we shall leave it.    Returning to the spot from which the Pearly Gates were first viewed, we  stand facing the most beautiful of this imposing group of brilliant  scenes, The Mermaid's Resort. This is a small cove with wave marks in  the white beach sand, above which rises a projecting, sheltering cliff  as purely white as freshly fallen snow, with a fine deposit of frost  work in thick moss-like patterns two and three inches deep.    This crystalline mass, so white and fragile, has to perfection the  appearance of hoar-frost about a steam-vent in extremely cold weather,  and was, no doubt, formed in a somewhat similar manner. It is  crystallized carbonate of lime, and could have been deposited in such  extremely delicate forms only by the heavily charged vapors rising from  hot water. No one needs to be told that hot water will take and hold in  solution a much larger quantity of solid matter than is possible to cold  water, with all other conditions the same; nor is it news that a portion  of the solid substance is carried off in the rising steam. Now the  geyser cones, so recently visited on the next lower level, prove both  the heat of the water and its heavy charge of solids, which gave it a  far more intense heat than pure water could have equaled, and this in  turn drove the steam to greater distances than otherwise it would have  reached. When cooled to such a point as to be reduced to a light vapor,  its movement was checked by various walls, projections, and ceiling as  were in its upward path, and these received the minute particles of  burden, while the somewhat brisk motion of the atmosphere, occasioned at  these points by the mixing of that of higher temperature from below with  the lower from above, is responsible for the dainty and varied forms  assumed by the fragile structure.    Once more resuming the journey, we admire the rugged charms of  University Heights, a somewhat larger and higher room than the next, St.  Dominic's Chamber, but perhaps not more interesting than the Council  Chamber, which besides other attractions is to some extent also a  Statuary Hall. From the Council Chamber the Alpine Way leads up into the  Fair Grounds directly above. This Alpine Way is a sort of cork-screw  twisting through the rocks, not unlike a badly walled well, assisted at  the lowest portion by a short and nearly perpendicular ladder. Next is  the Assembly Room, or Crown Chamber, as it is also called on account of  a handsome crown conspicuously placed. This room also contains a Moose  so perfectly carved that the skeptic who searches diligently for  imperfections finally clamors for the whole company to celebrate his  discovery of the artist's noble skill.    Leaving this room we re-enter Milliner's Avenue and soon cross the  bridge from which, a few hours ago, we descended into the eighth level  by way of Castle Garden; and now the return to the surface is by the  route followed before, and we arrive there at last terribly weary, but  more than well pleased.          CHAPTER XII.    WIND CAVE CONCLUDED.      GARDEN OF EDEN, THE GLACIER, AND ICE PALACE.    There is yet another long and charming line of travel open to those who  have sufficiently steady heads and light feet to suffer no loss of  confidence or depression of spirit when mounting the steep stairway  whose limit seems lost in the dark distance above.    There being but the single entrance, a repetition of the worn and  ancient statement that all roads lead to Rome, means that many journeys  may be taken in Wind Cave, but all must have the same beginning.    In the tourist season the guides have not time during the day to bring  out specimens to supply the demand, so on this account night trips are  of frequent occurrence; and on these occasions the number of persons in  all that vast space seldom exceeds half a dozen, but their voices and  laughter, and the blows of their hammers, can be heard at greater  distances than would seem possible, and give an agreeable sense of  companionship; yet the voice does not travel by any means so far as in  other caves.    The evening we were to make the long trip just mentioned, our guide  being ready before any others had gone in, we started the advance on the  ninety-seven miles of enclosed, unoccupied space and had almost reached  the level of the Bridal Chamber when he remembered a forgotten and  necessary roll of magnesium ribbon, for which it was needful to return  to the office in the upper building. I sat down on the lowest step of  the great stairway to wait, and for a very short time was entirely alone  in the largest cavern in the world, excepting the Mammoth Cave of  Kentucky.    The unexpected experience seemed suddenly to become one of the great  events of a lifetime, and was unmarred by the disturbing apprehensions  of any possible danger. The entire absence of sound was indescribably  awe-inspiring as        \"Strata overleaping strata from the center to the crust,      Rose, Alp-high, in molten silence, as the dead rise from the dust;\"    but the feeling of complete isolation from the living world would not  require an unlimited time to merit the one word--horrible. Even some  peril with ample companionship would be more agreeable, while it is a  curious fact that the combination of companionship with silence is  charming. On the occasion of one visit to the cave it was painful to  observe the actual suffering of a lover of quiet, from the  good-natured, but heedless, chatter of two of the party.    Presently steps on the stairs broke the stillness, a glimmer of light  pierced the intense darkness that surrounded the circle of one candle,  and the upper world seemed not so far away.    The interrupted journey was resumed, the route being that already  described as far as the Confederate Cross Roads, where, this time, we go  straight on in the main fissure instead of turning into the  cross-crevice, as was done before.    We were overtaken by the specimen party and recognized "]]]
