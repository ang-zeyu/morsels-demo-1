They call it murder, but of  course, they're just prejudiced. I'd call it a nuisance-abatement  project.\"    \"Look here, are you kidding?\" Gresham demanded.    \"I never kid about Those Who Have Passed On,\" Rand denied piously. Then  he recited the already hackneyed description of what had happened to  Rivers, with careful attention to all the gruesome details. \"So I called  copper, directly. Sergeant McKenna's up a stump about it, and looking in  all directions for a suspect.\"    Gresham was silent for a moment, then swore softly.    \"My God, Jeff! This is going to raise all kinds of hell!\" He was silent  for a moment. \"Look here, can you see me, at my home, about two thirty  this afternoon? I want to talk to you about this.\"    Rand smiled happily. This looked like what he had been angling for. Maybe  Arnold Rivers hadn't died in vain, after all.    \"Why, yes; I can make it,\" he replied.    \"Good. See you there, then.\"    Rand assured him that he would be on hand. When he returned to his table,  he found his lunch waiting for him. He sat down and ate with a good  appetite. After finishing, he had another drink, and sat sipping it  slowly and smoking his pipe; going over the story Gladys Fleming had told  him, and the gossip he had gotten from Carter Tipton, and the other  statements which had been made to him by different people about the death  of Lane Fleming, and the conclusions he had reached about the theft of  the pistols, and the killing of Arnold Rivers; sorting out the inferences  from the descriptions, and the descriptive statements of others from the  things he himself had observed. When his glass was empty and his pipe  burned out, he left a tip beside the ashtray, paid his check and went  out.    He had two hours until his meeting with Stephen Gresham; he knew exactly  where to spend them. The county seat was a normal twenty minutes' drive  from Rosemont, but with the road relatively free from traffic he was able  to cut that to fifteen. Parking his car in front of the courthouse, he  went inside.    The coroner, one Jason Kirchner, was an inoffensive-looking little fellow  with a Caspar Milquetoast mustache and an underslung jaw. He wore an Elks  watchcharm, an Odd Fellows ring, and a Knights of Pythias lapel-pin. He  looked at Rand's credentials, including the letter Humphrey Goode had  given him, with some bewilderment.    \"You're working for Mr. Goode?\" he asked, rather needlessly. \"Yes, I see;  handling the sale of Mr. Fleming's pistols, for the estate. Yes. That  must be interesting work, Mr. Rand. Now, what can I do for you?\"    \"Why, I understand you have an item from that collection, here in your  office,\" Rand said. \"The pistol with which Mr. Fleming shot himself.  Regardless of its unpleasant associations, that pistol is a valuable  collector's item, and one of the assets of the estate. If I'm to get full  value for the collection, for the heirs, I'll have to have that, to sell  with the rest of the weapons.\"    \"Well, now, look here, Mr. Rand,\" Kirchner started to argue, \"that  revolver's a dangerous weapon. It's killed one man, already. I don't know  as I ought to let it get out, where it might kill somebody else.\"    Rand estimated that this situation called for a modified version of his  hard-boiled act.    \"You think you can show cause why that revolver shouldn't be turned  over to the Fleming estate?\" he demanded. \"Well, if I don't get it,  right away, Mr. Goode will get a court order for it. You had no right  to impound that revolver, in the first place; you removed it from the  Fleming home illegally in the second place, since you had no intention  of holding any formal inquest, and you're holding it illegally now. A  court order might not be all we could get, either,\" he added menacingly.  \"Now, if you have any reason to suspect that Mr. Fleming committed  suicide ... or was murdered, for instance ...\"    \"Oh, my heavens, no!\" Kirchner cried, horrified. \"It was an accident,  pure and simple; I so certified it. Death by accident, due to  inadvertence of the deceased.\"    \"Well, then,\" Rand said, \"you have no right to hold that revolver, and  I want it, right now. As Mr. Goode's agent, I'm responsible for that  collection, of which the revolver you're holding is a part. That revolver  is too valuable an asset to ignore. You certainly realize that.\"    \"Well, I don't have any intention of exceeding my authority, of course,\"  Kirchner disclaimed hastily. \"And I certainly wouldn't want to go against  Mr. Goode's wishes.\" Humphrey Goode must pull considerable weight around  the courthouse, Rand surmised. \"But you realize, that revolver's still  loaded....\"    \"Oh, that's not your worry. I'll draw the charges, or, better, fire them  out. It stood one shot, it can stand the other five.\"    \"Well, would you mind if I called Mr. Goode on the phone?\"    Rand did, decidedly. However, he shook his head negligently.    \"Certainly not; go ahead and call him, by all means.\"    The coroner went away. In a few minutes he was back, carrying a  revolver in both hands. Evidently Goode had given him the green light.  He approached, handling the weapon with a caution that would have been  excessive for a Mills grenade; after warning Rand again that it was  loaded, he laid it gently on his desk.    It was a .36 Colt, one of the 1860 series, with the round barrel and the  so-called \"creeping\" ramming-lever. Somebody had wound a piece of wire  around it, back of the hammer and through the loading-aperture in front  of the cylinder; as the hammer was down on a fired chamber, there was no  way in God's world, short of throwing the thing into a furnace, in which  it could be discharged, but Kirchner was shrinking away from it as though  it might jump at his throat.    \"I put the wire on,\" the coroner said. \"I thought it might be safer that  way.\"    \"It'll be a lot safer after I've emptied it into the first claybank,  outside town,\" Rand told him. \"Sorry I had to be a little short with you,  Mr. Kirchner, but you know how it is. I'm responsible to Mr. Goode for  the collection, and this gun's part of it.\"    \"Oh, that's all right; I really shouldn't have taken the attitude I did,\"  Kirchner met him halfway. \"After I talked to Mr. Goode, of course, I knew  it was all right, but ... You see, I've been bothered a lot about that  pistol, lately.\"    \"Yes?\" Rand succeeded in being negligent about it.    \"Oh my, yes! The newspaper people wanted to take pictures of me holding  it, and then, there was an antique-dealer who was here trying to buy it.\"    \"Who was that--Arnold Rivers?\"    \"Why yes! Do you know him? He has an antique-shop on the other side of  Rosemont; he doesn't sell anything but guns and swords and that sort of  thing,\" Kirchner said. \"He was here, making inquiries about it, and my  clerk showed it to him, and then he started making offers for it--first  ten dollars, and then fifteen, and then twenty; he got up as high as  sixty dollars. I suppose it's worth a couple of hundred.\"    It was probably worth about thirty-five. Rand was intrigued by this  second instance of an un-Rivers-like willingness to spare no expense to  get possession of a .36-caliber percussion revolver.    \"Did he have it in his hands?\" he asked.    \"Oh, yes; he looked it over carefully. I suppose he thought he could get  a lot of money for it, because of the accident, and Mr. Fleming being  such a prominent man,\" Kirchner suggested.    Rand allowed himself to be struck by an idea.    \"Say, you know, that _would_ make it worth more, at that!\" he exclaimed.  \"What do you know! I never thought of that.... Look, Mr. Kirchner; I'm  supposed to get as much money for these pistols, for the heirs, as I can.  How would you like to give me a letter, vouching for this as the pistol  Mr. Fleming killed himself with? Put in how you found it in his hand, and  mention the serial numbers, so that whoever buys it will know it's the  same revolver.\" He picked up the Colt and showed Kirchner the serials, on  the butt, and in front of the trigger-guard. \"See, here it is: 2444.\"    Kirchner would be more than willing to oblige Mr. Goode's agent; he typed  out the letter himself, looked twice at the revolver to make sure of the  number, took Rand's word for the make, model, and caliber, signed it, and  even slammed his seal down on it. Rand thanked him profusely, put the  letter in his pocket, and stuck the Colt down his pants-leg.    About two miles from the county seat Rand stopped his car on a deserted  stretch of road and got out. Unwinding the wire Kirchner had wrapped  around the revolver, he picked up an empty beer-can from the ditch,  set it against an embankment, stepped back about thirty feet and began  firing. The first shot kicked up dirt a little over the can--Rand never  could be sure just how high any percussion Colt was sighted--and the  other four hit the can. He carried the revolver back to the car and put  it into the glove-box with the Leech & Rigdon.    After starting the car, he snapped on the radio, in time for the two  fifteen news-broadcast from the New Belfast station. As he had expected,  the murder was out; the daily budget of strikes and Congressional  investigations and international turmoil was enlivened by a more or less  imaginative account of what had already been christened the \"Rosemont  Bayonet Murder.\" Rand resigned himself to the inevitable influx of  reporters. Then he swore, as the newscaster continued:    \"District Attorney Charles P. Farnsworth, of Scott County, who has taken  charge of the investigation, says, and we quote: 'There is strong  evidence implicating certain prominent persons, whom we are not, as yet,  prepared to name, and if the investigation, now under way and making  excellent progress, justifies, they will be apprehended and formally  charged. No effort will be spared, and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17897"],[0,"Summa Theologica, Part I-II (Pars Prima Secundae) (#20)"],[1,"and  not-acting is imputed to, as though proceeding from, the will. And  thus it is that we can have the voluntary without an act; sometimes  without outward act, but with an interior act; for instance, when one  wills not to act; and sometimes without even an interior act, as when  one does not will to act.    Reply Obj. 1: We apply the word \"voluntary\" not only to that which  proceeds from the will directly, as from its action; but also to that  which proceeds from it indirectly as from its inaction.    Reply Obj. 2: \"Not to wish\" is said in two senses. First, as though  it were one word, and the infinitive of \"I-do-not-wish.\" Consequently  just as when I say \"I do not wish to read,\" the sense is, \"I wish not  to read\"; so \"not to wish to read\" is the same as \"to wish not to  read,\" and in this sense \"not to wish\" implies involuntariness.  Secondly it is taken as a sentence: and then no act of the will is  affirmed. And in this sense \"not to wish\" does not imply  involuntariness.    Reply Obj. 3: Voluntariness requires an act of knowledge in the same  way as it requires an act of will; namely, in order that it be in  one's power to consider, to wish and to act. And then, just as not to  wish, and not to act, when it is time to wish and to act, is  voluntary, so is it voluntary not to consider.  ________________________    FOURTH ARTICLE [I-II, Q. 6, Art. 4]    Whether Violence Can Be Done to the Will?    Objection 1: It would seem that violence can be done to the will. For  everything can be compelled by that which is more powerful. But there  is something, namely, God, that is more powerful than the human will.  Therefore it can be compelled, at least by Him.    Obj. 2: Further, every passive subject is compelled by its active  principle, when it is changed by it. But the will is a passive force:  for it is a \"mover moved\" (De Anima iii, 10). Therefore, since it is  sometimes moved by its active principle, it seems that sometimes it  is compelled.    Obj. 3: Further, violent movement is that which is contrary to  nature. But the movement of the will is sometimes contrary to nature;  as is clear of the will's movement to sin, which is contrary to  nature, as Damascene says (De Fide Orth. iv, 20). Therefore the  movement of the will can be compelled.    _On the contrary,_ Augustine says (De Civ. Dei v, 10) that what is  done by the will is not done of necessity. Now, whatever is done under  compulsion is done of necessity: consequently what is done by the  will, cannot be compelled. Therefore the will cannot be compelled to  act.    _I answer that,_ The act of the will is twofold: one is its immediate  act, as it were, elicited by it, namely, \"to wish\"; the other is an  act of the will commanded by it, and put into execution by means of  some other power, such as \"to walk\" and \"to speak,\" which are  commanded by the will to be executed by means of the motive power.    As regards the commanded acts of the will, then, the will can suffer  violence, in so far as violence can prevent the exterior members from  executing the will's command. But as to the will's own proper act,  violence cannot be done to the will.    The reason of this is that the act of the will is nothing else than  an inclination proceeding from the interior principle of knowledge:  just as the natural appetite is an inclination proceeding from an  interior principle without knowledge. Now what is compelled or  violent is from an exterior principle. Consequently it is contrary to  the nature of the will's own act, that it should be subject to  compulsion and violence: just as it is also contrary to the nature of  a natural inclination or movement. For a stone may have an upward  movement from violence, but that this violent movement be from its  natural inclination is impossible. In like manner a man may be  dragged by force: but it is contrary to the very notion of violence,  that he be dragged of his own will.    Reply Obj. 1: God Who is more powerful than the human will, can move  the will of man, according to Prov. 21:1: \"The heart of the king is  in the hand of the Lord; whithersoever He will He shall turn it.\" But  if this were by compulsion, it would no longer be by an act of the  will, nor would the will itself be moved, but something else against  the will.    Reply Obj. 2: It is not always a violent movement, when a passive  subject is moved by its active principle; but only when this is done  against the interior inclination of the passive subject. Otherwise  every alteration and generation of simple bodies would be unnatural  and violent: whereas they are natural by reason of the natural  interior aptitude of the matter or subject to such a disposition. In  like manner when the will is moved, according to its own inclination,  by the appetible object, this movement is not violent but voluntary.    Reply Obj. 3: That to which the will tends by sinning, although in  reality it is evil and contrary to the rational nature, nevertheless  is apprehended as something good and suitable to nature, in so far as  it is suitable to man by reason of some pleasurable sensation or some  vicious habit.  ________________________    FIFTH ARTICLE [I-II, Q. 6, Art. 5]    Whether Violence Causes Involuntariness?    Objection 1: It would seem that violence does not cause  involuntariness. For we speak of voluntariness and involuntariness  in respect of the will. But violence cannot be done to the will, as  shown above (A. 4). Therefore violence cannot cause involuntariness.    Obj. 2: Further, that which is done involuntarily is done with grief,  as Damascene (De Fide Orth. ii, 24) and the Philosopher (Ethic. iii,  5) say. But sometimes a man suffers compulsion without being grieved  thereby. Therefore violence does not cause involuntariness.    Obj. 3: Further, what is from the will cannot be involuntary. But  some violent actions proceed from the will: for instance, when a man  with a heavy body goes upwards; or when a man contorts his limbs in a  way contrary to their natural flexibility. Therefore violence does  not cause involuntariness.    _On the contrary,_ The Philosopher (Ethic. iii, 1) and Damascene (De  Fide Orth. ii, 24) say that \"things done under compulsion are  involuntary.\"    _I answer that,_ Violence is directly opposed to the voluntary, as  likewise to the natural. For the voluntary and the natural have this  in common, that both are from an intrinsic principle; whereas  violence is from an extrinsic principle. And for this reason, just as  in things devoid of knowledge, violence effects something against  nature: so in things endowed with knowledge, it effects something  against the will. Now that which is against nature is said to be  \"unnatural\"; and in like manner that which is against the will is  said to be \"involuntary.\" Therefore violence causes involuntariness.    Reply Obj. 1: The involuntary is opposed to the voluntary. Now it has  been said (A. 4) that not only the act, which proceeds immediately  from the will, is called voluntary, but also the act commanded by the  will. Consequently, as to the act which proceeds immediately from the  will, violence cannot be done to the will, as stated above (A. 4):  wherefore violence cannot make that act involuntary. But as to the  commanded act, the will can suffer violence: and consequently in this  respect violence causes involuntariness.    Reply Obj. 2: As that is said to be natural, which is according to  the inclination of nature; so that is said to be voluntary, which is  according to the inclination of the will. Now a thing is said to be  natural in two ways. First, because it is from nature as from an  active principle: thus it is natural for fire to produce heat.  Secondly, according to a passive principle; because, to wit, there is  in nature an inclination to receive an action from an extrinsic  principle: thus the movement of the heavens is said to be natural, by  reason of the natural aptitude in a heavenly body to receive such  movement; although the cause of that movement is a voluntary agent.  In like manner an act is said to be voluntary in two ways. First, in  regard to action, for instance, when one wishes to be passive to  another. Hence when action is brought to bear on something, by an  extrinsic agent, as long as the will to suffer that action remains in  the passive subject, there is not violence simply: for although the  patient does nothing by way of action, he does something by being  willing to suffer. Consequently this cannot be called involuntary.    Reply Obj. 3: As the Philosopher says (Phys. viii, 4) the movement of  an animal, whereby at times an animal is moved against the natural  inclination of the body, although it is not natural to the body, is  nevertheless somewhat natural to the animal, to which it is natural  to be moved according to its appetite. Accordingly this is violent,  not simply but in a certain respect. The same remark applies in the  case of one who contorts his limbs in a way that is contrary to their  natural disposition. For this is violent in a certain respect, i.e.  as to that particular limb; but not simply, i.e. as to the man  himself.  ________________________    SIXTH ARTICLE [I-II, Q. 6, Art. 6]    Whether Fear Causes Involuntariness Simply?    Objection 1: It would seem that fear causes involuntariness simply.  For just as violence regards that which is contrary to the will at the  time, so fear regards a future evil which is repugnant to the will.  But violence causes involuntariness simply. Therefore fear too causes  involuntariness simply.    Obj. 2: Further, that which is such of itself, remains such, whatever  be added to it: thus what is hot of itself, as long as it  remains, is still hot, whatever be added to it. But that which is done  through fear, is involuntary in itself. Therefore, even with the  addition of fear, it is involuntary.    Obj. 3: Further, that which is such, subject to a condition,"]]]
