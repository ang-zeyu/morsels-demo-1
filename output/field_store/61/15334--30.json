If the French want to  fight us, why don't they do it square and honest, not be racing and  chasing about like a lot of wild sheep.\"    \"Have you seen the moonshee, Tim? He is with the baggage.\"    \"Shure and I saw him,\" Tim said. \"The cart come in just now, and there  was he, perched up on the top of it like a dried monkey. You don't  want him tonight, shure, yer honor.\"    \"Oh no, I don't want him, Tim. You'd better go now, and get to sleep  at once, if you can. We may be off again, at any minute.\"    Arcot is twenty-seven miles from Conjeveram. Clive felt certain that  the enemy had gone on to that place; but, anxious as he was for its  safety, it was absolutely necessary that the troops should have a rest  before starting on such a march. They were, therefore, allowed to rest  until twelve o'clock; when, refreshed by their eight hours' halt and  breakfast, they started upon their long march towards Arcot, making  sure that they should not find the enemy until they reached that  place.    Had Clive possessed a body of cavalry, however small, he would have  been able to scour the country, and to make himself acquainted with  the real position of the French. Cavalry are to a general what eyes  are to a man, and without these he is liable to tumble into a pitfall.  Such was the case on the present occasion. Having no doubt that the  enemy were engaged in attacking Arcot, the troops were plodding along  carelessly and in loose order; when, to their astonishment, after a  sixteen-mile march, as they approached the town of Kavaripak just as  the sun was setting, a fire of artillery opened upon them from a grove  upon the right of the road, but two hundred and fifty yards distant.  Nothing is more confusing than a surprise of this kind, especially to  young troops, and when no enemy is thought to be near.    The French general's plans had been well laid. He had reached  Kavaripak that morning, and allowed his troops to rest all day, and he  expected to obtain an easy victory over the tired men who would,  unsuspicious of danger, be pressing on to the relief of Arcot. So far  his calculations had been correct, and the English marched  unsuspiciously into the trap laid for them.    The twelve French guns were placed in a grove, round whose sides,  facing the point from which Clive was approaching, ran a deep ditch  with a high bank forming a regular battery. A body of French infantry  were placed in support of the guns, with some Sepoys in reserve behind  the grove. Parallel with the road on the left ran a deep watercourse,  now empty, and in this the rest of the infantry were stationed, at a  point near the town of Kavaripak, and about a quarter of a mile  further back than the grove. On either side of this watercourse the  enemy had placed his powerful cavalry force.    For a moment, when the guns opened, there was confusion and panic  among the British troops. Clive, however, ever cool and confident in  danger, and well seconded by his officers, rallied them at once. The  position was one of extreme danger. It was possible, indeed, to  retreat, but in the face of an enemy superior in infantry and guns,  and possessing so powerful a body of cavalry, the operation would have  been a very dangerous one. Even if accomplished, it would entail an  immense loss of morale and prestige to his troops. Hitherto, under his  leading, they had been always successful; and a belief in his own  superiority adds immensely to the fighting power of a soldier. Even  should the remnant of the force fight its way back to Madras, the  campaign would have been a lost one, and all hope of saving  Trichinopoli would have been at an end.    \"Steady, lads, steady,\" he shouted. \"Form up quietly and steadily. We  have beaten the enemy before, you know, and we will do so again.\"    While the troops, in spite of the artillery fire, fell into line,  Clive rapidly surveyed the ground. He saw the enemy's infantry  advancing up the watercourse, and so sheltered by it as to be out of  the fire of his troops. He saw their cavalry sweeping down on the  other side of the watercourse, menacing his left and threatening his  baggage. The guns were at once brought up from the rear, but before  these arrived the men were falling fast.    Three of the guns he placed to answer the French battery, two of them  he hurried to his left, with a small body of English and two hundred  Sepoys, to check the advance of the enemy's cavalry. The main body of  his infantry he ordered into the watercourse, which afforded them a  shelter from the enemy's artillery. The baggage carts and baggage he  sent half a mile to the rear, under the protection of forty Sepoys and  a gun.    While this was being done the enemy's fire was continuing, but his  infantry advanced but slowly, and had not reached a point abreast of  the grove when the British force in the watercourse met them. It would  not seem to be a very important matter, at what point in the  watercourse the infantry of the two opposing parties came into  collision, but matters apparently trifling in themselves often decide  the fate of battles; and, in fact, had the French artillery retained  their fire until their infantry were abreast of the grove, the battle  of Kavaripak would have been won by them, and the British power in  Southern India would have been destroyed.    Clive moved confidently and resolutely among his men, keeping up their  courage by cheerful words, and he was well seconded by his officers.    \"Now, lads,\" Charlie Marryat cried to the company of which he was in  command, \"stick to it. You ought to be very thankful to the French,  for saving you the trouble of having to march another twelve miles  before giving you an opportunity of thrashing them.\"    The men laughed, and redoubled their fire on the French infantry, who  were facing them in the watercourse at a distance of eighty yards.  Neither party liked to charge. The French commander knew that he had  only to hold his position to win the day. His guns were mowing down  the English artillerymen. The English party on the left of the  watercourse, with difficulty, held their own against the charges of  his horsemen, and were rapidly dwindling away under the artillery  fire, while other bodies of his cavalry had surrounded the baggage,  and were attacking the little force told off to guard it. He knew,  too, that any attempt the English might make to attack the battery,  with its strong defences, must inevitably fail.    The situation was becoming desperate. It was now ten o'clock. The  fight had gone on for four hours. No advantage had been gained, the  men were losing confidence, and the position grew more and more  desperate. Clive saw that there was but one chance of victory. The  grove could not be carried in the front, but it was just possible that  it might be open in the rear.    Choosing a sergeant who spoke the native language well, he bade him  leave the party in the watercourse, and make his way round to the rear  of the grove, and discover whether it was strongly guarded there or  not. In twenty minutes, the sergeant returned with the news that there  was no strong force there.    Clive at once took two hundred of his English infantry, the men who  had fought at Arcot, and quietly left the watercourse and made his way  round towards the rear of the grove. Before he had gone far the main  body in the watercourse, surprised at the sudden withdrawal of the  greater portion of the English force, and missing the presence of  Clive himself, began to lose heart. They no longer replied  energetically to the fire of the French infantry. A movement of  retreat began, the fire ceased, and in a minute or two they would have  broken in flight.    At this moment, Clive returned. As he moved forward, he had marked the  dying away of the English fire, and guessing what had happened, had  given over the command of the column to Lieutenant Keene, the senior  officer, and hurried back to the watercourse. He arrived there just as  the troops had commenced to run away.    Throwing himself among them, with shouts and exhortations, he  succeeded in arresting their flight; and, by assurances that the  battle was as good as won elsewhere, and that they had only to hold  their ground for a few minutes longer to ensure victory, he got them  to advance to their former position; and to reopen fire on the French,  who had, fortunately, remained inactive instead of advancing and  taking advantage of the cessation of the English fire.    In the meantime, Lieutenant Keene led his detachment, making a long  circuit, to a point three hundred yards immediately behind the grove.  He then sent forward one of his officers, Ensign Symmonds, who spoke  French perfectly, to reconnoitre the grove. Symmonds had proceeded but  a little way, when he came upon a large number of French Sepoys, who  were covering the rear of the grove; but who, as their services were  not required, were sheltering themselves there from the random bullets  which were flying about. They at once challenged; but Symmonds  answering them in French they, being unable to see his uniform in the  darkness, and supposing him to be a French officer, allowed him to  advance.    He passed boldly forward into the grove. He proceeded nearly through  it, until he came within sight of the guns, which were still keeping  up their fire upon those of the English; while a hundred French  infantry, who were in support, were all occupied in watching what was  going on in front of them. Symmonds returned to the detachment, by a  path to the right of that by which he had entered, and passed out  without seeing a soul.    Lieutenant Keene gave the word to advance and, following"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18837"],[0,"Commentarii de Bello Gallico (#20)"],[1,"quae coniectis celeriter stramentis tentoriorum  integendorum gratia erant inaedificata, milites compegit. Equites tamen  et auxiliarios pedites in omnes partes mittit quascumque petisse  dicebantur hostes; nec frustra: nam plerumque magna praeda potiti nostri  revertuntur. Oppressi Carnutes hiemis difficultate, terrore periculi,  cum tectis expulsi nullo loco diutius consistere auderent nec silvarum  praesidio tempestatibus durissimis tegi possent, dispersi magna parte  amissa suorum dissipantur in finitimas civitates.      6    Caesar tempore anni difficillimo, cum satis haberet convenientes manus  dissipare, ne quod initium belli nasceretur, quantumque in ratione  esset, exploratum haberet sub tempus aestivorum nullum summum bellum  posse conflari, Gaium Trebonium cum duabus legionibus, quas secum  habebat, in hibernis Cenabi collocavit; ipse, cum crebris legationibus  Remorum certior fieret Bellovacos, qui belli gloria Gallos omnes  Belgasque praestabant, finitimasque his civitates duce Correo Bellovaco  et Commio Atrebate exercitus comparare atque in unum locum cogere, ut  omni multitudine in fines Suessionum, qui Remis erant attributi,  facerent impressionem, pertinere autem non tantum ad dignitatem sed  etiam ad salutem suam iudicaret nullam calamitatem socios optime de re  publica meritos accipere, legionem ex hibernis evocat rursus undecimam;  litteras autem ad Gaium Fabium mittit, ut in fines Suessionum legiones  duas quas habebat adduceret, alteramque ex duabus ab Labieno arcessit.  Ita, quantum hibernorum opportunitas bellique ratio postulabat, perpetuo  suo labore in vicem legionibus expeditionum onus iniungebat.      7    His copiis coactis ad Bellovacos proficiscitur castrisque in eorum  finibus positis equitum turmas dimittit in omnes partes ad aliquos  excipiendos ex quibus hostium consilia cognosceret. Equites officio  functi renuntiant paucos in aedificiis esse inventos, atque hos, non qui  agrorum colendorum causa remansissent (namque esse undique diligenter  demigratum), sed qui speculandi causa essent remissi. A quibus cum  quaereret Caesar quo loco multitudo esset Bellovacorum quodve esset  consilium eorum, inveniebat Bellovacos omnes qui arma ferre possent in  unum locum convenisse, itemque Ambianos, Aulercos, Caletos, Veliocasses,  Atrebatas; locum castris excelsum in silva circumdata palude delegisse,  impedimenta omnia in ulteriores silvas contulisse. Complures esse  principes belli auctores, sed multitudinem maxime Correo obtemperare,  quod ei summo esse odio nomen populi Romani intellexissent. Paucis ante  diebus ex his castris Atrebatem Commium discessisse ad auxilia  Germanorum adducenda; quorum et vicinitas propinqua et multitudo esset  infinita. Constituisse autem Bellovacos omnium principum consensu, summa  plebis cupiditate, si, ut diceretur, Caesar cum tribus legionibus  veniret, offerre se ad dimicandum, ne miseriore ac duriore postea  condicione cum toto exercitu decertare cogerentur; si maiores copias  adduceret, in eo loco permanere quem delegissent, pabulatione autem,  quae propter anni tempus cum exigua tum disiecta esset, et frumentatione  et reliquo commeatu ex insidiis prohibere Romanos.      8    Quae Caesar consentientibus pluribus cum cognosset atque ea quae  proponerentur consilia plena prudentiae longeque a temeritate barbarorum  remota esse iudicaret, omnibus rebus inserviendum statuit, quo celerius  hostis contempta sua paucitate prodiret in aciem. Singularis enim  virtutis veterrimas legiones VII, VIII, VIIII habebat, summae spei  delectaeque iuventutis XI, quae octavo iam stipendio tamen in collatione  reliquarum nondum eandem vetustatis ac virtutis ceperat opinionem.  Itaque consilio advocato, rebus eis quae ad se essent delatae omnibus  expositis animos multitudinis confirmat. Si forte hostes trium legionum  numero posset elicere ad dimicandum, agminis ordinem ita constituit, ut  legio septima, octava, nona ante omnia irent impedimenta, deinde omnium  impedimentorum agmen, quod tamen erat mediocre, ut in expeditionibus  esse consuevit, cogeret undecima, ne maioris multitudinis species  accidere hostibus posset quam ipsi depoposcissent. Hac ratione paene  quadrato agmine instructo in conspectum hostium celerius opinione eorum  exercitum adducit.      9    Cum repente instructas velut in acie certo gradu legiones accedere Galli  viderent, quorum erant ad Caesarem plena fiduciae consilia perlata, sive  certamiuis periculo sive subito adventu sive exspectatione nostri  consili copias instruunt pro castris nec loco superiore decedunt.  Caesar, etsi dimicare optaverat, tamen admiratus tantam multitudinem  hostium valle intermissa magis in altitudinem depressa quam late patente  castra castris hostium confert. Haec imperat vallo pedum XII muniri,  loriculam pro [hac] ratione eius altitudinis inaedificari; fossam  duplicem pedum denum quinum lateribus deprimi directis; turres excitari  crebras in altitudinem trium tabulatorum, pontibus traiectis  constratisque coniungi, quorum frontes viminea loricula munirentur; ut  ab hostibus duplici fossa, duplici propugnatorum ordine defenderentur,  quorum alter ex pontibus, quo tutior altitudine esset, hoc audacius  longiusque permitteret tela, alter, qui propior hostem in ipso vallo  collocatus esset, ponte ab incidentibus telis tegeretur. Portis fores  altioresque turres imposuit.      10    Huius munitionis duplex erat consilium. Namque et operum magnitudinem et  timorem suum sperabat fiduciam barbaris allaturum, et cum pabulatum  frumentatumque longius esset proficiscendum, parvis copiis castra  munitione ipsa videbat posse defendi. Interim crebro paucis utrimque  procurrentibus inter bina castra palude interiecta contendebatur; quam  tamen paludem nonnumquam aut nostra auxilia Gallorum Germanorumque  transibant acriusque hostes insequebantur, aut vicissim hostes eadem  transgressi nostros longius summovebant. Accidebat autem cotidianis  pabulationibus (id quod accidere erat necesse, cum raris disiectisque ex  aedificius pabulum conquireretur), ut impeditis locis dispersi  pabulatores circumvenirentur; quae res, etsi mediocre detrimentum  iumentorum ac servorum nostris adferebat, tamen stultas cogitationes  incitabat barbarorum, atque eo magis, quod Commius, quem profectum ad  auxilia Germanorum arcessenda docui, cum equitibus venerat; qui, tametsi  numero non amplius erant quingenti, tamen Germanorum adventu barbari  nitebantur.      11    Caesar, cum animadverteret hostem complures dies castris palude et loci  natura munitis se tenere neque oppugnari castra eorum sine dimicatione  perniciosa nec locum munitionibus claudi nisi a maiore exercitu posse,  litteras ad Trebonium mittit, ut quam celerrime posset legionem XIlI,  quae cum T. Sextio legato in Biturigibus hiemabat, arcesseret atque ita  cum tribus legionibus magnis itineribus ad se veniret; ipse equites in  vicem Remorum ac Lingonum reliquarumque civitatum, quorum magnum numerum  evocaverat, praesidio pabulationibus mittit, qui subitas hostium  incursiones sustinerent.      12    Quod cum cotidie fieret ac iam consuetudine diligentia minueretur, quod  plerumque accidit diu turnitate, Bellovaci delecta manu peditum cognitis  stationibus cotidianis equitum nostrorum silvestribus locis insidias  disponunt eodemque equites postero die mittunt, qui primum elicerent  nostros, deinde circumventos aggrederentur. Cuius mali sors incidit  Remis, quibus ille dies fungendi muneris obvenerat. Namque hi, cum  repente hostium equites animad vertissent ac numero superiores  paucitatem contempsissent, cupidius insecuti peditibus undique sunt  circumdati. Quo facto perturbati celerius quam consuetudo fert equestris  proeli se receperunt amisso Vertisco, principe civitatis, praefecto  equitum; qui cum vix equo propter aetatem posset uti, tamen consuetudine  Gallorurn neque aetatis excusatione in suscipienda praefectura usus erat  neque dimicari sine se voluerat. Inflantur atque incitantur hostium  animi secundo proelio, principe et praefecto Remorum interfecto,  nostrique detrimento admonentur diligentius exploratis locis stationes  disponere ac mode ratius cedentem insequi hostem.      13    Non intermittunt interim cotidiana proelia in conspectu utrorumque  castrorum, quae ad vada transitus que fiebant paludis. Qua contentione  Germani, quos propterea Caesar traduxerat Rhenum ut equitibus  interpositi proeliarentur, cum constantius universi paludem transissent  paucisque resistentibus interfectis pertinacius reliquam multitudinem  essent insecuti, perterriti non solum ei qui aut comminus opprimebantur  aut eminus vulnerabantur, sed etiam qui longius subsidiari consuerant,  turpiter refugerunt, nec prius finem fugae fecerunt saepe amissis  superioribus locis quam se aut in castra suorum reciperent, aut nonnulli  pudore coacti longius profugerent. Quorum periculo sic omnes copiae sunt  perturbatae ut vix iudicari posset, utrum secundis minimisque rebus  insolentiores an adverso mediocri casu timidiores essent.      14    Compluribus diebus isdem in castris consumptis, cum propius accessisse  legiones et Gaium Trebonium legatum cognossent, duces Bellovacorum  veriti similem obsessionem Alesiae noctu dimittunt eos quos aut aetate  aut viribus inferiores aut inermes habebant, unaque reliqua impedimenta.  Quorum perturbatum et confusum dum explicant agmen (magna enim multitudo  carrorum etiam expeditos sequi Gallos consuevit), oppressi luce copias  armatorum pro suis instruunt castris, ne prius Romani persequi se  inciperent quam longius agmen impedimentorum suorum processisset. At  Caesar neque resistentes adgrediendos tanto collis ascensu iudicabat,  neque non usque eo legiones admovendas ut discedere ex eo loco sine  periculo barbari militibus instantibus non possent. Ita, cum palude  impedita a castris castra dividi videret, quae trans eundi difficultas  celeritatem insequendi tardare posset, adque id iugum quod trans paludem  paene ad hostium castra pertineret"]]]
