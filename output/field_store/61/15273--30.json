Nay more, the divine statutes have always been, and  will ever remain, the cause and instrument of the preservation of mankind,  as witnessed by His exalted words: \"In punishment will ye find life, O men  of insight!\"(39) It would, however, ill beseem the justice of thy Majesty  that for the trespass of a single soul a whole group of people should be  subjected to the scourge of thy wrath. The one true God--glorified be His  Name!--hath said: \"None shall bear the burden of another.\"(40) It is clear  and evident that in every community there have been, and will ever be, the  learned and the ignorant, the wise and the heedless, the profligate and  the pious. That a wise and reflecting soul should commit a heinous deed is  most improbable, inasmuch as such a person either seeketh after this world  or hath forsaken it: if he be of the latter, he would assuredly have no  regard for aught else besides God, and moreover the fear of God would  deter him from unlawful and reprehensible actions; and if he be of the  former, he would just as assuredly avoid such deeds as would alienate and  alarm the people, and act in such a manner as to earn their confidence and  trust. It is therefore evident that reprehensible actions have always  emanated, and will ever emanate, from ignorant and foolish souls. We  implore God to guard His servants from turning to anyone save Him, and to  draw them nigh unto His presence. His might, in truth, is equal to all  things.    238 Praise be unto Thee, O Lord My God! Thou hearest the voice of My  lamentation, and beholdest My condition, My distress and affliction! Thou  knowest all that is in Me. If the call I have raised be wholly for Thy  sake, then draw thereby the hearts of Thy creatures towards the heaven of  Thy knowledge, and the heart of the Sovereign towards the right hand of  the throne of Thy name, the All-Merciful. Supply him then, O My God, with  a portion of that goodly sustenance which hath descended from the heaven  of Thy generosity and the clouds of Thy mercy, that he may forsake his all  and turn unto the court of Thy favour. Aid him, O My God, to assist Thy  Cause and to exalt Thy Word amidst Thy creatures. Strengthen him, then,  with the hosts of the seen and the unseen, that he may subdue every city  in Thy Name, and hold sway, through Thy sovereignty and might, over all  that dwell on earth, O Thou in Whose hand is the kingdom of creation!  Thou, verily, art the Supreme Ordainer in both the beginning and the end.  No God is there but Thee, the Most Powerful, the All-Glorious, the  All-Wise.    239 So grossly hath Our Cause been misrepresented before thy royal  presence that, if some unseemly act be committed by but one of this  people, it is portrayed as being prompted by their beliefs. By Him besides  Whom there is none other God! This Servant hath refused even to sanction  the commission of reproved actions, how much less those which have been  explicitly prohibited in the Book of God.    240 God hath forbidden unto men the drinking of wine, and this prohibition  hath been revealed and recorded in His Book. In spite of this, and of the  fact that the learned doctors of the age--may God increase their  numbers!--have all prohibited the people from such a wretched act, there  still remain some who commit it. The punishment which this act entaileth,  however, applieth only to its heedless perpetrators, whilst those noble  manifestations of supreme sanctity remain exalted above and exempt from  all blame. Yea, the whole creation, both seen and unseen, beareth witness  unto their holiness.    241 Yea, these servants regard the one true God as He Who \"doeth as He  willeth\"(41) and \"ordaineth as He pleaseth\".(42) Thus they view not as  impossible the continued appearance in the contingent world of the  Manifestations of His Unity. Should anyone hold otherwise, how would he be  different from those who believe the hand of God to be \"chained up\"?(43)  And if the one true God--glorified be His mention!--be indeed regarded as  unconstrained, then whatever Cause that Ancient King may please to  manifest from the wellspring of His Command must be embraced by all. No  refuge is there for anyone and no haven to hasten unto save God; no  protection is there for any soul and no shelter to seek except in Him.    242 The essential requirement for whoso advanceth a claim is to support  his assertions with clear proofs and testimonies. Beyond this, the  rejection of the people, whether learned or ignorant, hath never been, nor  shall it ever be, of any consequence. The Prophets of God, those Pearls of  the ocean of Divine Unity and the Repositories of Divine Revelation, have  ever been the object of men's repudiation and denial. Even as He saith:  \"Each nation hath plotted darkly against their Messenger to lay violent  hold on Him, and disputed with vain words to invalidate the truth.\"(44)  And again: \"No Messenger cometh unto them but they laugh Him to  scorn.\"(45)    243 Consider the dispensation of Him Who is the Seal of the Prophets and  the King of the Chosen Ones--may the souls of all mankind be offered up for  His sake! After the Daystar of Truth dawned above the horizon of Hijaz,  how great were the cruelties which the exponents of error inflicted upon  that incomparable Manifestation of the All-Glorious! Such was their  heedlessness that they regarded every injury inflicted upon that sacred  Being as ranking among the greatest of all acts, and constituting a means  of attainment unto God, the Most High. For in the early years of His  mission the divines of that age, both Christian and Jewish, turned away  from that Daystar of the heaven of glory, whereupon all people, high and  low alike, bestirred themselves to extinguish the light of that Luminary  of the horizon of inner meanings. The names of all these divines have been  mentioned in the books of old; among them are Wahb Ibn-i-Rahib, Ka'b  Ibn-i-Ashraf, 'Abdu'llah-i-Ubayy, and others of their like.    244 Finally, matters came to such a pass that these men took counsel  together and conspired to shed His pure blood, even as God--glorified be  His mention!--saith: \"And remember when the disbelievers schemed against  Thee, that they might lay hold upon Thee, or slay Thee, or cast Thee out;  and so they schemed, and God schemed, and God, verily, is the best of  schemers.\"(46) Again He saith: \"But if their opposition be grievous to  Thee--if Thou canst, seek out an opening into the earth or a ladder into  heaven and bring to them a sign; yet if God wished, He could gather them  unto true guidance; be Thou not, then, of the ignorant.\"(47) By God! The  hearts of His favoured ones are consumed at the purport of these two  blessed verses. Such established and undisputed facts have been forgotten,  and no one hath paused to reflect, in days past or in this day, upon the  things that have prompted men to turn away from the Revealers of the light  of God at the time of their manifestation.    245 Likewise, before the appearance of the Seal of the Prophets, consider  Jesus, the Son of Mary. When that Manifestation of the All-Merciful  revealed Himself, all the divines charged that Quintessence of faith with  impiety and rebellion. Eventually, with the sanction of Annas, the most  learned of the divines of His day, and Caiaphas, the high priest, His  blessed person was made to suffer that which the pen is ashamed to mention  and powerless to describe. The wide world in all its vastness could no  longer contain Him, until at last God raised Him up unto heaven.    246 Were a detailed account of all the Prophets to be given here, We fear  that it might lead to weariness. The doctors of the Torah in particular  assert that no independent Prophet will come after Moses with a new Law.  They maintain that a Scion of the House of David shall be made manifest  Who will promulgate the Law of the Torah, and help establish and enforce  its commandments throughout the East and the West.    247 The followers of the Gospel, likewise, hold as impossible that the  Bearer of a new Revelation should again shine forth from the dayspring of  the Will of God after Jesus, Son of Mary--peace be upon Him! In support of  this contention, they adduce the following verse from the Gospel: \"Heaven  and earth shall pass away, but the words of the Son of Man shall never  pass away.\"(48) They maintain that neither the teachings nor the  commandments of Jesus--peace be upon Him!--may ever be altered.    248 At one point in the Gospel, He saith: \"I go away, and come again.\"(49)  Again in the Gospel of John, He hath foretold the advent of a Comforter  who shall come after Him.(50) In the Gospel of Luke, moreover, a number of  signs and portents have been mentioned. Certain divines of that Faith,  however, have interpreted these utterances after their own fancy, and have  thus failed to grasp their true significance.    249 O would that thou wouldst permit Me, O Shah, to send unto thee that  which would cheer the eyes, and tranquillize the souls, and persuade every  fair-minded person that with Him is the knowledge of the Book. Certain  persons, incapable of answering the objections raised by their opponents,  claim that the Torah and the Gospel have been corrupted, whereas in  reality the references to such corruption pertain only to specific  cases.(51) But for the repudiation of the foolish and the connivance of  the divines, I would have uttered a discourse that would have thrilled and  carried away the hearts unto a realm from the murmur of whose winds can be  heard: \"No God is there but He!\" For the present, however, since the  season is not ripe, the tongue of My utterance hath been stilled and the  wine of exposition sealed up until such time as God, through the power of  His might, shall please to unseal it. He, verily, is the Almighty, the  Most Powerful.    250 Praise be unto Thee, O Lord My God!

Be  thou as the breezes of the All-Merciful for the trees of the realm of  existence and foster their growth through the potency of the Name of thy  Lord, the Just, the All-Informed. We desire to acquaint thee with that  which will serve as a reminder unto the people, that they may put away the  things current amongst them and set their faces towards God, the Lord of  the sincere.    We exhort mankind in these days when the countenance of Justice is soiled  with dust, when the flames of unbelief are burning high and the robe of  wisdom rent asunder, when tranquillity and faithfulness have ebbed away  and trials and tribulations have waxed severe, when covenants are broken  and ties are severed, when no man knoweth how to discern light and  darkness or to distinguish guidance from error.    O peoples of the world! Forsake all evil, hold fast that which is good.  Strive to be shining examples unto all mankind, and true reminders of the  virtues of God amidst men. He that riseth to serve My Cause should  manifest My wisdom, and bend every effort to banish ignorance from the  earth. Be united in counsel, be one in thought. Let each morn be better  than its eve and each morrow richer than its yesterday. Man's merit lieth  in service and virtue and not in the pageantry of wealth and riches. Take  heed that your words be purged from idle fancies and worldly desires and  your deeds be cleansed from craftiness and suspicion. Dissipate not the  wealth of your precious lives in the pursuit of evil and corrupt  affection, nor let your endeavours be spent in promoting your personal  interest. Be generous in your days of plenty, and be patient in the hour  of loss. Adversity is followed by success and rejoicings follow woe. Guard  against idleness and sloth, and cling unto that which profiteth mankind,  whether young or old, whether high or low. Beware lest ye sow tares of  dissension among men or plant thorns of doubt in pure and radiant hearts.    O ye beloved of the Lord! Commit not that which defileth the limpid stream  of love or destroyeth the sweet fragrance of friendship. By the  righteousness of the Lord! Ye were created to show love one to another and  not perversity and rancour. Take pride not in love for yourselves but in  love for your fellow-creatures. Glory not in love for your country, but in  love for all mankind. Let your eye be chaste, your hand faithful, your  tongue truthful and your heart enlightened. Abase not the station of the  learned in Baha and belittle not the rank of such rulers as administer  justice amidst you. Set your reliance on the army of justice, put on the  armour of wisdom, let your adorning be forgiveness and mercy and that  which cheereth the hearts of the well-favoured of God.    By My life! Thy grievances have plunged Me into sorrow. Regard not the  children of the world and all their doings but fix thy gaze upon God and  His never-ending dominion. Verily, He calleth to thy remembrance that  which is the source of delight for all mankind. Drink thou the life-giving  water of blissful joy from the chalice of utterance proffered by the  Fountainhead of divine Revelation--He Who hath made mention of thee in this  mighty stronghold. Endeavour to the utmost of thy powers to establish the  word of truth with eloquence and wisdom and to dispel falsehood from the  face of the earth. Thus directeth thee the Dayspring of divine knowledge  from this luminous horizon.    O thou who speakest in My Name! Consider the people and the things they  have wrought in My days. We revealed unto one of the rulers that which  overpowereth all the dwellers of the earth, and requested him to bring Us  face to face with the learned men of this age, that We might set forth for  him the testimony of God, His proofs, His glory and His majesty; and  naught did We intend thereby but the highest good. However, he committed  that which hath caused the inmates of the cities of justice and equity to  lament. Thus hath judgement been given between Me and him. Verily thy Lord  is the Ordainer, the All-Informed. In such circumstances as thou seest,  how can the Celestial Bird soar into the atmosphere of divine mysteries  when its wings have been battered with the stones of idle fancy and bitter  hatred, and it is cast into a prison built of unyielding stone? By the  righteousness of God! The people have perpetrated a grievous injustice.    As regards thine assertions about the beginning of creation, this is a  matter on which conceptions vary by reason of the divergences in men's  thoughts and opinions. Wert thou to assert that it hath ever existed and  shall continue to exist, it would be true; or wert thou to affirm the same  concept as is mentioned in the sacred Scriptures, no doubt would there be  about it, for it hath been revealed by God, the Lord of the worlds. Indeed  He was a hidden treasure. This is a station that can never be described  nor even alluded to. And in the station of 'I did wish to make Myself  known', God was, and His creation had ever existed beneath His shelter  from the beginning that hath no beginning, apart from its being preceded  by a Firstness which cannot be regarded as firstness and originated by a  Cause inscrutable even unto all men of learning.    That which hath been in existence had existed before, but not in the form  thou seest today. The world of existence came into being through the heat  generated from the interaction between the active force and that which is  its recipient. These two are the same, yet they are different. Thus doth  the Great Announcement inform thee about this glorious structure. Such as  communicate the generating influence and such as receive its impact are  indeed created through the irresistible Word of God which is the Cause of  the entire creation, while all else besides His Word are but the creatures  and the effects thereof. Verily thy Lord is the Expounder, the All-Wise.    Know thou, moreover, that the Word of God--exalted be His glory--is higher  and far superior to that which the senses can perceive, for it is  sanctified from any property or substance. It transcendeth the limitations  of known elements and is exalted above all the essential and recognized  substances. It became manifest without any syllable or sound and is none  but the Command of God which pervadeth all created things. It hath never  been withheld from the world of being. It is God's all-pervasive grace,  from which all grace doth emanate. It is an entity far removed above all  that hath been and shall be.    We are loath to enlarge on this subject, inasmuch as the unbelievers have  inclined their ears towards Us in order to hear that which might enable  them to cavil against God, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting. And  since they are unable to attain to mysteries of knowledge and wisdom from  what hath been unravelled by the Source of divine splendour, they rise in  protest and burst into clamour. But it is true to say that they object to  that which they comprehend, not to the expositions given by the Expounder,  nor the truths imparted by the One true God, the Knower of things unseen.  Their objections, one and all, turn upon themselves, and I swear by thy  life that they are devoid of understanding.    Every thing must needs have an origin and every building a builder.  Verily, the Word of God is the Cause which hath preceded the contingent  world--a world which is adorned with the splendours of the Ancient of Days,  yet is being renewed and regenerated at all times. Immeasurably exalted is  the God of Wisdom Who hath raised this sublime structure.    Look at the world and ponder a while upon it. It unveileth the book of its  own self before thine eyes and revealeth that which the Pen of thy Lord,  the Fashioner, the All-Informed, hath inscribed therein. It will acquaint  thee with that which is within it and upon it and will give thee such  clear explanations as to make thee independent of every eloquent  expounder.    Say: Nature in its essence is the embodiment of My Name, the Maker, the  Creator. Its manifestations are diversified by varying causes, and in this  diversity there are signs for men of discernment. Nature is God's Will and  is its expression in and through the contingent world. It is a  dispensation of Providence ordained by the Ordainer, the All-Wise. Were  anyone to affirm that it is the Will of God as manifested in the world of  being, no one should question this assertion. It is endowed with a power  whose reality men of learning fail to grasp. Indeed a man of insight can  perceive naught therein save the effulgent splendour of Our Name, the  Creator. Say: This is an existence which knoweth no decay, and Nature  itself is lost in bewilderment before its revelations, its compelling  evidences and its effulgent glory which have encompassed the universe.    It ill beseemeth thee to turn thy gaze unto former or more recent times.  Make thou mention of this Day and magnify that which hath appeared  therein. It will in truth suffice all mankind. Indeed expositions and  discourses in explanation of such things cause the spirits to be chilled.  It behoveth thee to speak forth in such wise as to set the hearts of true  believers ablaze and cause their bodies to soar.    Whoso firmly believeth today in the rebirth of man and is fully conscious  that God, the Most Exalted, wieldeth supreme ascendancy and absolute  authority over this new creation, verily such a man is reckoned with them  that are endued with insight in this most great Revelation. Unto this  beareth witness every discerning believer.    Walk thou high above the world of being through the power of the Most  Great Name, that thou mayest become aware of the immemorial mysteries and  be acquainted with that wherewith no one is acquainted.
