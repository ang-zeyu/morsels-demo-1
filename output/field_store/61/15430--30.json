No doubt there will be a  formal meeting, tomorrow, to ask my opinion about the probability  of the present state of things continuing at Poona. I shall, of  course, tell them your story; and they will likely request you to  go, at once, to see them; therefore, do not leave the hotel until  you hear from me.\"    Sufder had not previously visited Bombay, and the next morning  early he went out, with Soyera as his guide, to inspect the  European part of the town. He was much struck with the appearance  of neatness and order in the fort, and the solidity of the  buildings.    \"It is a strong place, assuredly,\" he said to Harry, on his return.  \"In the first place, it would be necessary for a force attacking it  to cross over the narrow isthmus, and causeway, uniting the island  with the land; and that would be impossible, in face of a force  provided with artillery guarding it. Then, if they succeeded in  winning that, they would have to make their way through the native  town to get on to the maidan; and this would be defended by the  guns from all the batteries and, in addition to the artillery on  land, it might be swept by guns on board ship. Truly, those who  talked about driving the English into the sea cannot have known  anything of the strength of the position.    \"As to carrying it by assault, it could not be done; nor could the  garrison be starved out, since they could always obtain supplies of  all sorts by sea. And yet, except at the causeway, the place has no  natural strength. The Mahrattas acted unwisely, indeed, when they  allowed the English to settle here.\"    \"They could not foresee the future, Sufder. Now, doubtless, they  are sorry; but if in the future the British become masters of  India, the Mahrattas will have no reason to regret having given  them a foothold. Wherever their powers extend, the natives are far  better off than they were under the rule of their own princes. Were  the British masters, there would be no more wars, no more  jealousies, and no more intrigues; the peasants would till their  fields in peace, and the men who now take to soldiering would find  more peaceful modes of earning a living.\"    \"But you do not think, surely, Harry,\"--for after leaving Poona, he  had been told to call him so--\"that the English can ever become  masters of India? They conquered the Carnatic, but even there they  were not safe from the forays of Hyder Ali. Mysore bars their way  farther north. Then there is the Nizam to be dealt with, and then  Berar and the Mahrattas; then comes Rajputana, and beyond are the  Sikhs, and the fierce chiefs of Scinde. It is true that the English  have beaten the peoples of lower Bengal, but these have always been  looked down upon, and despised as cowardly and effeminate, by the  fighting men of all India.    \"Besides, how few are the white soldiers! They say, too, that the  French have promised Tippoo to send a big army, to help to drive  the English into the sea.\"    \"The French have quite work enough, at home,\" Harry said. \"It is  true that they have got into Egypt, but they are shut up there by  our fleets. Moreover, even were they to cross over into Arabia, how  could they march across a dry and almost waterless country, for a  thousand or two of miles? When they arrived in Scinde they would  find all the fighting men of the province, and the Sikhs, opposed  to them; and they would never be able to fight their way down to  Mysore. The thing is absurd.\"    The conversation was interrupted by the arrival of a messenger,  from the Government House, with a request that Mr. Lindsay should  at once attend there. Harry's horse, which had been saddled in  readiness, was brought round; for it would have seemed strange for  a Mahratta, whose dress showed that he held a good position, to go  on foot. Sufder rode by his side, Soyera following on foot.    Dismounting at the Government House, he threw the reins to one of  the lads, who were waiting in readiness to hold the horses of  officers coming to see the Governor. On Harry mentioning his name,  the native doorkeeper said:    \"I have orders for you to be taken, at once, to the Council  chamber, sahib, on your arrival here.\"    The Governor, with four members of the Council and Mr. Malet, were  seated at a long table. Mr. Malet rose and said:    \"This is Mr. Lindsay, gentlemen.\"    \"Truly, sir, it would be difficult to recognize you as a fellow  countryman, in that garb,\" the Governor said; \"though your colour  is somewhat less dark than that of a Mahratta.\"    \"Since I left Poona I have ceased to dye, sir; as to my dress, this  will be the last time I shall wear it, unless I should be called  upon to go to Poona again.\"    \"Your story is a most singular one,\" the Governor said, \"but Mr.  Malet assures us that you are the son of Major Lindsay, and has  been telling us how you escaped the massacre at the camp, and how  your ayah has brought you up.\"    \"She has come down with me, sir. I thought that her testimony would  be necessary; and I have also brought down her cousin, who was  present at the foray in which my father and mother were killed. My  account will be confirmed by their statements.\"    \"You do credit to Mahratta food and training, Mr. Lindsay; but Mr.  Malet has mentioned to me that, at one time, you were employed as a  shikaree, to keep down the tigers which were doing havoc among the  villagers near the top of the Ghauts. He has also informed us of  the very valuable service you rendered, by informing him of Nana  Furnuwees' measures for regaining power, and replacing Bajee Rao on  the musnud--intelligence which saved us a great expenditure of  money in preparing to support him; with the certainty that, by  doing so, we might excite the enmity of Scindia. He tells us, also,  why you continued so long in the Deccan, instead of coming down  here; and I think you acted very wisely.    \"We have mentioned your services, in that matter, in our reports to  the Board of Directors; and have said that, partly as a recognition  of this, and partly because you are the son of an English officer,  who was killed in their service, we should at once give you an  appointment, subject to their approval.    \"Now, sir, which would you prefer, the civil or military branch?\"    \"I should much prefer the military,\" Harry answered, without  hesitation; \"unless indeed, sir, you think my services would be  more useful in the civil.\"    \"If we were at Calcutta or Madras, there would be more scope for  you in the civil service; but as we hold, at present, little  territory beyond this island, there are therefore but few  appointments affording an opportunity for the display of the  intelligence which you certainly possess; but, should circumstances  alter, you might, owing to your knowledge of the country and its  language, be told off for civil work, in which the emoluments are  very much higher than in the military branch of the service.    \"You will at once be gazetted to the 3rd Native Cavalry, and do  duty with the regiment, until your services are required elsewhere.  Fresh disturbances may break out at Poona and, in that case, you  might be attached as assistant to Colonel Palmer.    \"Do you think you would be known again?\"    \"I think it would be very unlikely, sir. When my skin has recovered  its proper colour, and I am dressed in uniform, I feel sure no one  would recognize me as having been an officer in the Peishwa's  court.\"    \"Very well, sir. Then you will see your name in the gazette,  tomorrow. You will, within a day or so, report yourself to the  officer commanding the regiment.    \"I may say that it would be well if your nurse, and the man who  came down with you, were to draw up statements concerning your  birth, and swear to them at the High Court. These might be valuable  to you, in the future.\"    After expressing his thanks to the Governor and Council, Harry went  out, and rode back to the hotel with Sufder.        Chapter 6: In The Company's Service.      There was no conversation between Harry and Sufder on the way back  to the hotel; Harry saying that he would tell the news when Soyera  joined them, otherwise he would have to go through it twice. They  rode slowly through the streets, and Soyera arrived a few minutes  after them.    \"Now,\" Harry said, \"we will go up to my room and talk the matter  over.    \"Mr. Malet has been kind enough to give such a favourable report of  me that I am appointed lieutenant to the 3rd Regiment of Native  Cavalry, and shall be employed as assistant to the resident at  Poona, should there be fresh disturbances there.\"    \"That is good fortune, indeed,\" Sufder said.    \"Wonderfully good fortune! and I owe it all, in the first place to  Soyera, and in the next to yourself. You see, I have gained greatly  by taking your advice, and remaining in the Deccan until fit for  military service. Had she declared who I was when she took me down  to Bombay, before, there is no saying what might have become of me.    \"And now, the first thing to do is for me to go out and order a  uniform. When I return I will draw up, in Mahratti and English, a  full account of the manner in which I was saved, by Soyera and you,  from being murdered; and how I have been brought up.\"    Harry had learned, at the Governor's, the name and address of an  official at the Judge's Court who would get his statements copied  out, in proper form and writing; and when he had taken them down  from the lips of Sufder and Soyera, he saw this gentleman, who  promised that the documents should be ready by the next day.    Having thus put his business in train, Harry went to call upon Mrs.  Sankey. She did not recognize him at once but, as soon as he made  himself known, she received him most warmly.    \"You looked as if you would grow into a big fellow, but I hardly  expected that you would have done it so soon.\"    \"It is more than four years since I left you. I don't think that I"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20730"],[0,"For the Sake of the School (#20)"],[1,"  said: \"I'm fearfully sorry. I'll buy a new copy of the book.\"    \"I don't believe you can; it's one Mrs. Arnold gave to the school, and  is published in America. I'll try sponging it with salts of lemon, but  I'm afraid nothing will take out the stain. I thought better of you,  Ulyth Stanton. One doesn't expect such things from V B. You'll borrow no  more books till the end of the month. Do you understand?\"    Ulyth responded with what meekness she could muster. She admitted that  the monitress had reason for wrath, and that she had really no excuse  worthy of urging in extenuation of her crime. It was hard to be debarred  the use of the library for more than a fortnight, but, Helen, she knew,  would enforce that discipline rigidly. The unfortunate motto-cards had  come in for the bulk of the ink, and were completely spoilt. Ulyth  carried the ruins to Lizzie's bedroom and pleaded _peccavi_.    \"Well, I suppose it can't be helped. I've done my three cards with  pictures of flowers, and the rest of the calendar will have to be  plain,\" said Lizzie. \"You were rather an idiot, Ulyth.\"    \"I know. I'd have asked Helen for the book if she'd been anywhere near,  and I meant to tell her afterwards that I'd taken it.\"    \"Didn't you explain that to her?\"    \"No. It didn't come well when she'd just caught me.\"    \"You let her think the worst of you.\"    \"It couldn't be helped. I'm sure Stephanie hunted her up and told her.\"    \"Stephanie doesn't like you.\"    \"No, because I champion Rona, and Stephanie can't bear her.\"    \"There's nothing so much wrong with the poor old Cuckoo now; she's  wonderfully inoffensive.\"    \"Yes, but she's not aristocratic. Stephie rubs that in to her  continually. She calls her 'a daughter of the people'.\"    \"Stephanie Radford can be uncommonly snobbish sometimes.\"    Stephanie from the very first had resented Rona's presence at The  Woodlands, and since the practical joke which the latter had played upon  her she had disliked her heartily. She lost no opportunity of showing  her contempt, and of trying to make Rona seem of small account. She  revived an ancient tradition of the school which made it a breach of  etiquette for girls to go into other form-rooms than their own, thus  banishing Rona from V B, where she had often been brought in by Ulyth or  good-natured Addie to share the fun that went on. If obliged to take  Rona's hand in figure-dancing, she would only give the extreme tips of  her fingers, and if forced on any occasion to sit next to her, she would  draw away her skirts as if she feared contamination.    \"The Woodlands isn't what it used to be,\" she would assure a select  circle of listeners. \"When my eldest sister was here there were the  Courtenays and the Derringtons and the Vernons and quite a number of  girls of really good family. Miss Bowes would never have dreamt then of  taking a girl she knew nothing about; she was so particular whom she  received.\"    \"The poor old Cuckoo has her points,\" volunteered Addie. \"I'm afraid  most of us aren't 'county'!\"    \"All schools are more mixed than they used to be,\" admitted Stephanie  candidly; \"but I'd draw the line at specimens straight from the  backwoods.\"    Few of the girls really liked Stephanie, nevertheless her opinions  carried weight. A school-mate who dresses well, talks continually of  highborn friends, and \"gives herself airs\" can nearly always command a  certain following among the more unthinking of her comrades, and such  girls as Beth Broadway, Alice and Merle Denham, and Mary Acton were  easily impressed by Stephanie's attitude of superiority, and ready to  follow her lead on a question of caste. It gave them a kind of reflected  credit to belong to Stephanie's circle, and they liked to pride  themselves upon their exclusiveness.    Though Rona was many thousand miles away from her home, she evidently  did not forget her New Zealand friends, and looked out anxiously for the  thin foreign letters which arrived from time to time. She never showed  them to anybody, and spoke little of old associations, but a word would  slip out here and there to reveal that she cared more than she would  give her schoolfellows to suppose. One afternoon, shortly before the New  Zealand mail was expected, Rona was working in her portion of the  garden, when Mary Acton brought her a message.    \"Some visitors to see you. They're waiting in the practising-room,\"  announced Mary.    \"Visitors to see me!\" exclaimed Rona, throwing down her rake. \"Whoever  can they be?\"    \"I'm sure I don't know,\" replied Mary stolidly. \"They asked for Miss  Mitchell, so I suppose that's you. There isn't anyone else in the school  named Mitchell.\"    \"It must be me!\"    Rona's eyes were wide with excitement. Visitors for herself! It was such  an utter surprise. For one moment a wild idea flashed across her mind.  Her face suddenly hardened.    \"What are they like? Do you know them?\" she gasped.    \"Not from Adam, or rather Eve. They're just two very ordinary-looking  females.\"    Much agitated, Rona flew into the house to wash her hands, slip off her  gardening-apron, and change her shoes. When this very hasty toilet was  completed, she walked to the practising-room and entered nervously. Two  ladies were sitting near the piano, with their backs to the window. They  were not fashionably dressed, but perhaps they were cold, for both wore  their large coat collars turned up. Their felt hats had wide floppy  brims. One carried a guide to North Wales, and the other held an open  motor-map in her hand, as if she had been studying the route.    \"Miss Mitchell? How d'you do?\" said the taller of the two as Rona  entered. \"I dare say you'll be surprised to see us, and you won't know  who we are. I'm Mrs. Grant, and this is my cousin, Miss Smith. We live  in New Zealand, and know some of your friends there. We're visiting  England at present, and as we found ourselves motoring through North  Wales, we thought we would call and see you.\"    \"It's very good of you,\" faltered Rona. \"Which friends of mine do you  know?\"    \"The Higsons. They sent you all kinds of messages.\"    \"Oh! How are they? Do tell me about them!\"    Rona's cheeks were flushed and her lips quivering.    \"Pamela has grown, of course. Connie and Minnie have had measles. Billy  had a fall from his horse and sprained his ankle badly, but he's all  right again now.\"    \"And Jake?\"    \"Spends most of his time with the Johnson girls.\"    \"Who are they? I never heard of them.\"    \"They came after you left.\"    \"To which farm?\"    \"Oh, not very far away, I believe!\"    \"I wonder Pamela didn't tell me all that in her letter. Which farm can  it possibly be? Surely not Heathlands?\"    \"I believe that was the name.\"    \"Then have the Marstons gone?\"    \"Yes, to the North Island.\"    \"Oh! I'm very sorry. Why didn't they write to me? Did you hear any other  news, please?\"    \"Pamela told me something about your home.\"    A shadow crossed Rona's face.    \"Is it--is it Mrs. Barker?\" she asked nervously.    \"Yes, it's about her.\"    \"What has she been doing?\"    \"Getting married again.\"    \"Oh! Oh! Who would have her?\"    \"Your father.\"    \"No!\" shrieked Rona, her eyes ablaze. \"It can't be! That dreadful,  drinking woman! Oh, I can't--I won't believe it!\"    \"She's your stepmother now, whether you like it or not.\"    \"Daddy! Daddy! It can't be! How could you? You knew she drank!\"    \"He's drinking himself--like a fish.\"    \"No! My daddy?\"    Rona, a moment ago furious, had turned white as a ghost. She put out a  trembling hand and clutched the piano blindly; then, with a pitiful,  broken cry, she fell, half-fainting, half-sobbing, on to the floor. At  that moment Ulyth, with her music-case, entered the room.    \"What's the matter? Rona! Rona, dear! Are you ill? Who are  these--people?\"    She might well ask, for the behaviour of the two strangers was most  unprecedented. They were leaning on each other's shoulders and roaring  with laughter. One of them suddenly threw up her hat, and turned down  her collar, revealing the familiar features of Stephanie Radford.    \"Done you brown!\" she exploded. \"Paid you back in your own coin for your  precious Eau de Venus sell! I'm even with you now, Rona Mitchell! Come  along, Beth.\" And the pair disappeared, guffawing.    Rona picked herself up shakily, and subsided on to a chair, with her  face in her hands.    \"It's not true then?\" she quavered.    \"What isn't true?\"    \"They told me Dad had married Mrs. Barker, and that he was--drinking!\"    \"Stephanie told you that?\"    \"Yes. Oh, I'm queer still!\"    \"Rona, darling, of course it's nothing but a black, wicked lie. Don't  cry so. There isn't a word of truth about it. They were only ragging  you. Oh, don't take it so hard! I'll settle with Stephanie for this.\"    Half an hour afterwards a very grim, determined Ulyth, supported by  Lizzie Lonsdale, sought out the masqueraders and spoke her mind.    \"She ragged me, so why shouldn't I turn the tables on her? It's nothing  to make such a hullabaloo about!\" yapped Stephanie.    \"But it is. The trick she played on you was only fun after all. Yours  was the cruellest thing you could think of to hurt and wound her. You  may pride yourself on your family, Stephanie Radford, but I'm sure the  very commonest person would have had nicer feelings than to do this. I  can never think the same of you and Beth again.\"    \"Oh, of course you take up the cudgels for your precious Cuckoo!\"  snapped Stephanie. \"Don't make such an absurd fuss. I shall do what I  like, without you setting yourself up to lecture me. So there! If you  don't like it, you may lump it.\"    \"Not a very aristocratic form of expression for a scion of the Radfords  of Stoke Radford!\" commented Lizzie, as she and Ulyth stalked away.
