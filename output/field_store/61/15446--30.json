The first legislature of Virginia was convened under the  administration of Governor Sir George Yeardley, in the year 1626; but  before this we find, during the _first_ administration of Governor  Wyatt, nay, before that, during that of Sir Thomas Yeardley, in 1619, _a  starting point_ for our inquiries and investigations in regard to the  Hampton Church. By reference to the histories of the period, we find  that the pay of their clergy was fixed at L200 worth of corn and  tobacco. One hundred acres were marked off for glebes in every borough,  for each of which the company at home provided six tenants at the public  cost. They applied to the Bishop of London to find them a body of  \"pious, learned, and painful ministers,\"--\"a charitable work,\" says  Wilberforce, \"in which he readily engaged.\" Two years subsequent to this  occurred the massacre at Jamestown, and two years after that, we find,  amongst thirty-five provisions, the following, for the promotion of  religious knowledge and worship: That there shall be _erected_ a _house  of worship_, and there shall be a _burial ground on every plantation_;  that the colonists, under penalty, shall attend public worship, and that  there shall be uniformity in faith and worship, with the English  Church--prescribing also the observance of the feasts of the Church, and  a fast upon the anniversary of the Jamestown massacre; not forgetting,  by the way, to enjoin \"respectful treatment, and the payment of a  settled stipend to the colonial clergy.\" In the instructions given to  Sir William Berkeley, Governor-General of Virginia, after the return of  the royal exile, Charles the Second, to the throne of his murdered  sire,--passing over, as we do, for the sake of brevity, much that might  interest the reader during the closing period of the reign of James,  that of Charles the First, and also that of the psalm-singing  blood-hunter Cromwell,--we find the recommendation of the duties of  religion, the use of \"the booke of Common Prayer, the decent repairs of  Churches, and a competent provision for conforming ministers.\"[E] These  suggestions, we learn, were at once acted upon by the colonial  legislature, and provision was made for the building and due furniture  of churches, &c., &c. This was in 1660. The oldest records in the County  Court office date as far back as 1635. In 1644, I find the  _churchwardens_ presenting two females for offences, to the Court; and  in 1646, I find that Nicholas Brown, and William Armistead,  _churchwardens_, present one of their body to the Court, requesting that  Thomas Eaton be compelled to collect the _parish levy_, and make his  returns. This fixes the fact, then, that this was a _parish_, and that  there was _a church_ somewhere in this region in 1644, for, from the  English laws respecting the clergy, the object of the creation of  _churchwardens_ is \"to protect _the edifice of the Church_, to  superintend the ceremonies of public worship, to promote the observance  of religious duties, &c., &c.[F]\" I find, in 1644, the following on  record--\"To paid Mr. Mallory for preaching 2 funeral sermons, 800 pounds  of tobacco.\" The next year I find the Rev. Mr. Justinian Aylmere, who  continued to officiate until the early part of 1667. We now find, in  those same records, the _first mention of the church_ immediately under  consideration, and it is as follows, being an extract from a will, and  bearing date December 21, 1667:         \"I, Nicholas Baker, being very sicke in body, but of perfect       memory, doe make, constitute, and ordaine this my last will and       testament, revoking and disclayming all other wills by me made.       Imprimis, I give my soule unto God my redeemer, and my body to       bee decently buried in _ye new church of Kighotan_. Item, I       give and bequeathe unto Mr. Jeremy Taylor, minister,[G] my       cloath cloak, to bee delivered to him after my corpse carrying       out of ye house.\"    From these extracts I learn these two facts, that there was a _new  church_, already built, and that Mr. Jeremy Taylor was the minister, and  the inference is a legitimate one, taking into consideration the  instructions given to Governor Berkeley, and acted upon by him, to which  reference is made above, that the _old church now standing in Hampton_,  built in the form of a cross, and of brick, a drawing of which,  accompanies this communication, was erected at some period about 1660,  or between that and 1667. That it was not built _before_ 1660, we have  strong reasons to presume; and that it was built between that and 1667,  we hope to show hereafter. In the time intervening between the murder of  Charles the First and the restoration, there would have been no churches  built, we presume, in the _form of the cross_--this the minions of  Cromwell would not have allowed; nor for the worship and ritual of the  Church of England, for the same reasons; and, moreover, the will above  referred to, speaks of the church as being \"ye _new_ church of  Kighotan.\"    The tower was an after thought, as we find from the vestry-book, now in  the possession of the writer. The following bears date 2d day of March,  1761:         \"Charles Cooper came into vestry, and agreed to do the brick       work of the steeple, with good and well burnt bricks and mortar       of lime, at least fifteen bushels of lime to every thousand       bricks so laid. The said Cooper to find all materials       necessary for building the said steeple, and all expenses what       kind soever at his own proper cost. The said Cooper to give       bond for the performance, agreeable to a resolve of the said       vestry on the 6 day of February last.\"    And, on the 16th day of June, 1761, the record below is made in the  vestry-book:         \"Agreed that the steeple as before to be built, shall be joined       to the west end of the church wall, and that an half brick be       added to the thickness of the foundation of the said steeple up       to the water table.\"    And, on the 14th day of July, 1762, the following record on the  vestry-book will show its completion:         \"Agreed, that Mr. William Westwood, and Mr. Charles Cooper,       compute the number of bricks laid in the steeple wall, and if       they two disagree, that they chuse a third person; and that       this vestry hath _this day received the said work_, so as not       to affect the counting or computing the number of bricks laid       in the said steeple.\"    The occasion of building the tower is found in the extract following,  made from the same source, and bearing date February 6, 1761:         \"Whereas the late Mr. Andrew Kennedy, did by his last will and       testament, devise to the parish of Elizabeth City, forty pounds       sterling, to purchase a bell for the church of the said parish,       provided the vestry, and churchwardens of the said parish,       shall undertake to build a belfry for the same in twelve months       after the said Alexander Kennedy's death; and this vestry,       willing to embrace the said gift, have accordingly resolved,\"       &c.    Now arises a question of some interest. The will of Nicholas Baker, made  December 21, 1667, makes mention of \"ye _new_ church of Kighotan.\" Was  there an _old_ church of Kighotan? One older than this? We answer, yes!  And now for the writer's reasons for arriving at this conclusion. From  the old record of wills, deeds, &c., in the County Court office, and to  which I have had access freely, through the politeness and kindness of  Samuel Howard, Esq., the gentlemanly clerk of the court, I copy the  following:         \"In the name of God, Amen. I, Robert Brough, clerke of       Kigquotan, in the county of Elizabeth Citty, being sicke and       weake in body, but in perfect sense and memory, praised bee God       for itt, this seven and twentyeth day of Aprill, in the yeare       of our Lord God 1667, for the quieting of my conscience, desire       to settle that estate it has pleased God to lend mee, in manner       and forme following;--And first of all, I commend my soul into       the hands of ye Almighty God my Maker, and my Saviour and       Redeemer Christ Jesus, being confident through his meritts and       blood shedd for mee, to be an inheritor with Him, His saints       and angells of everlasting life. And my body unto ye earthe       from whence it came, there to receive decent burial in _the old       parish church of Kigquotan_ aforesaid,\" &c.    \"The _old_ parish church of Kigquotan,\" and \"ye _new_ church of  Kighotan,\" cannot be one and the same. We are then led to inquire,  _where_ was the old parish church of Kigquotan, and _when_ was it  probably built? The last branch of this question, we prefer answering  first. By reference to the administration of Sir Thomas Yeardley (not  Sir George Yeardley), we find that, in 1621, among several other  Colonial enactments, provision is made for the _erection_ of a \"_house  of worship, and the separation of a burial ground on every plantation_.\"  We presume, therefore, that it was about this time (1621-2) that the  first church of Kigquotan was erected, and we have not forgotten  the _churchwardens_ of 1644. And now, in answer to the other  question--_where_ was this church built?--we have only to turn our  footsteps to the \"_Pembroke Farm_\" (the property of John Jones, Esq.),  about one mile from the town of Hampton, and, as we there take our stand  among the few remaining tombs, shout \"Eureka, Eureka!\" Whether the old  parish church of Kigquotan was of wood, or of brick, we cannot at this  day determine. \"Like the baseless fabric of a vision\" it has  disappeared; but we opine"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2096"],[0,"A Smaller History of Greece: from the Earliest Times to the Roman Conquest (#20)"],[1,"in consequence  of a similar accusation afterwards overtook Socrates.  Pericles himself  pleaded the cause of Aspasia.  He was indeed indirectly implicated in  the indictment; but he felt no concern except for his beloved Aspasia,  and on this occasion the cold and somewhat haughty statesman, whom the  most violent storms of the assembly could not deprive of his  self-possession, was for once seen to weep.  His appeal to the jury was  successful, but another trial still awaited him.  An indictment was  preferred against his friend, the great sculptor Phidias, for  embezzlement of the gold intended to adorn the celebrated ivory statue  of Athena; and according to some, Pericles himself was included in the  charge of peculation. Whether Pericles was ever actually tried on this  accusation is uncertain; but at all events, if he was, there can be no  doubt that he was honourably acquitted.  The gold employed in the  statue had been fixed in such a manner that it could be detached and  weighed, and Pericles challenged his accusers to the proof. But Phidias  did not escape so fortunately.  There were other circumstances which  rendered him unpopular, and amongst them the fact that he had  introduced portraits both of himself and Pericles in the sculptures  which adorned the frieze of the Parthenon.  Phidias died in prison  before the day of trial.    The Athenian empire, since the conclusion of the Thirty Years' Truce,  had again become exclusively maritime.  Yet even among the subjects and  allies united with Athens by the Confederacy of Delos, her sway was  borne with growing discontent.  One of the chief causes of this  dissatisfaction was the amount of the tribute exacted by the Athenians,  as well as their misapplication of the proceeds.  In the time of  Aristides and Cimon, when an active war was carrying on against the  Persians, the sum annually collected amounted to 460 talents.  In the  time of Pericles, although that war had been brought to a close, the  tribute had nevertheless increased to the annual sum of 600 talents.  Another grievance was the transference to Athens of all lawsuits, at  least of all public suits; for on this subject we are unable to draw  the line distinctly.  In criminal cases, at all events, the allies seem  to have been deprived of the power to inflict capital punishment.  Besides all these causes of complaint, the allies had often to endure  the oppressions and exactions of Athenian officers, both military and  naval, as well us of the rich and powerful Athenian citizens settled  among them.    In B.C. 440 Samos, one of the free independent allies already  mentioned, revolted from Athens; but even this island was no match for  the Athenian power.  Pericles, who sailed against the Samians in  person, defeated their fleet in several engagements, and forced the  city to capitulate.  The Samians were compelled to raze their  fortifications, to surrender their fleet, to give hostages for their  future conduct, and to pay the expenses of the war.    The triumphs and the power of Athens were regarded with fear and  jealousy by her rivals; and the quarrel between Corinth and Corcyra  lighted the spark which was to produce the conflagration. On the coast  of Illyria near the site of the modern Durazzo, the Corcyraeans had  founded the city of Epidamnus.  Corcyra (now Corfu) was itself a colony  of Corinth; and though long at enmity with its mother country, was  forced, according to the time-hallowed custom of the Greeks in such  matters, to select the founder of Epidamnus from the Corinthians.  Accordingly Corinth became the metropolis of Epidamnus as well as of  Corcyra.  At the time of which we speak, the Epidamnians, being hard  pressed by the Illyrians, led by some oligarchical exiles of their own  city, applied to Corcyra for assistance, which the Corcyraeans, being  connected with the Epidamnian oligarchy, refused.  The Epidamnians then  sought help from the Corinthians, who undertook to assist them.  The  Corcyraeans, highly resenting this interference, attacked the  Corinthian fleet off Cape Actium, and gained a signal victory (B.C.  435).    Deeply humbled by this defeat, the Corinthians spent the two following  years in active preparations for retrieving it.  The Corcyraeans, who  had not enrolled themselves either in the Lacedaemonian or Athenian  alliance, and therefore stood alone, were greatly alarmed at these  preparations.  They now resolved to remedy this deficiency; and as  Corinth belonged to the Lacedaemonian alliance, the Corcyraeans had no  option, and were obliged to apply to Athens.  The majority of the  Athenians were ready to comply with their request; but in order to  avoid an open infringement of the Thirty Years' Truce, it was resolved  to conclude only a defensive alliance with Corcyra:  that is, to defend  the Corcyraeans in case their territories were actually invaded by the  Corinthians, but beyond that not to lend them any active assistance.  A  small Athenian squadron of only 10 triremes was despatched to the  assistance of the Corcyraeans.  Soon after their arrival a battle  ensued off the coast of Epirus, between the Corinthian and Corcyraean  fleets.  After a hard-fought day, victory finally declared in favour of  the Corinthians.  The Athenians now abandoned their neutrality, and did  all in their power to save the dying Corcyraeans from their pursuers.  This action took place early in the morning; and the Corinthians  prepared to renew the attack in the afternoon, when they saw in the  distance 20 Athenian vessels, which they believed to be the advanced  guard of a still larger fleet.  They accordingly sailed away to the  coast of Epirus; but finding that the Athenians did not mean to  undertake offensive operations against them, they departed homewards  with their whole fleet.  These events took place in the year B.C. 432.    The Corinthians were naturally incensed at the conduct of Athens; and  it is not surprising that they should have watched for an opportunity  of revenge.  This was soon afforded them by the enmity of the  Macedonian prince Perdiccas towards the Athenians. He incited her  tributaries upon the coast of Macedonia to revolt, including Potidaea,  a town seated on the isthmus of Pallene. Potidaea, though now a  tributary of Athens, was originally a colony of the Corinthians, and  received from them certain annual magistrates.  Being urged as well by  the Corinthians as by Perdiccas, the Potidaeans openly raised the  standard of revolt (B.C. 432).  A powerful Athenian armament was  despatched to the coast of Macedonia and laid siege to Potidaea.    Meanwhile the Lacedaemonians, urged on all sides by the complaints of  their allies against Athens, summoned a general meeting of the  Peloponnesian confederacy at Sparta.  The Corinthians took the most  prominent part in the debate; but other members of the confederacy had  also heavy grievances to allege against Athens.  Foremost among these  were the Megarians, who complained that their commerce had been ruined  by a recent decree of the Athenians which excluded them from every port  within the Athenian jurisdiction.  It was generally felt that the time  had now arrived for checking the power of Athens.  Influenced by these  feelings, the Lacedaemonians decided upon war; and the congress passed  a resolution to the same effect, thus binding the whole Peloponnesian  confederacy to the same policy.  This important resolution was adopted  towards the close of B.C. 432, or early in the following year.  Before  any actual declaration of war, hostilities were begun in the spring of  B.C. 431 by a treacherous attack of the Thebans upon Plataea.  Though  Boeotians by descent, the Plataeans did not belong to the Boeotian  league, but had long been in close alliance with the Athenians.  Hence  they were regarded with hatred and jealousy by the Thebans, which  sentiments were also shared by a small oligarchical faction in Plataea  itself.  The Plataean oligarchs secretly admitted a body of 300 Thebans  into the town at night; but the attempt proved a failure; the citizens  flew to arms, and in the morning all the Thebans were either slain or  taken prisoner.        CHAPTER X.    ATHENS IN THE TIME OF PERICLES.    [Note: The figures referred to in a few places in this chapter have had  to be omitted from the etext.]    At the commencement of the Peloponnesian war Athens was at the height  of its glory under the brilliant administration of Pericles.  We may  therefore here pause to take a brief survey of the city and of its most  important buildings.  Athens is situated about three miles from the  sea-coast, in the central plain of Attica.  In this plain rise several  eminences.  Of these the most prominent is a lofty insulated mountain,  with a conical peaked summit, now called the Hill of St. George, and  which bore in ancient times the name of LYCABETTUS.  This mountain,  which was not included within the ancient walls, lies to the north-east  of Athens, and forms the most striking feature in the environs of the  city.  It is to Athens what Vesuvius is to Naples, or Arthur's Seat to  Edinburgh.  South-west of Lycabettus there are four hills of moderate  height, all of which formed part of the city.  Of these the nearest to  Lycabettus and at the distance of a mile from the latter, was the  ACROPOLIS, or citadel of Athens, a square craggy rock rising abruptly  about 150 feet, with a flat summit of about 1000 feet long from east to  west, by 500 feet broad from north to south.  Immediately west of the  Acropolis is a second hill of irregular form, the AREOPAGUS.  To the  south-west there rises a third hill, the PNYX, on which the assemblies  of the citizens were held; and to the south of the latter is a fourth  hill, known as the MUSEUM.  On the eastern and western sides of the  city there run two small streams, which are nearly exhausted before  they reach the sea, by the heats of summer"]]]
