Mr. Brown was a kind person and never mistreated his slaves, although he  did furnish them with the whip for infractions of rules such as  fighting, stealing, visiting other plantations without a \"pass\", etc.  Ward vividly recalls that one of the soundest thrashings he ever got was  for stealing Mr. Brown's whisky. His most numerous offenses were  fighting. Another form of punishment used in those days was the stocks,  such as those used in early times in England. Serious offenses like  killing another person was also handled by the master who might hang him  to a tree by the feet or by the neck, as he saw fit.    Few slaves ever attempted to escape from Mr. Brown, partially because of  his kindliness and partically because of the fear inspired by the pack  of blood hounds which he kept. When an escaped slave was caught he was  returned to his master and a sound beating was administered.    As far as marriage was concerned on the Brown estate, Mr. Brown, himself  placed every two individuals together that he saw fit to. There was no  other wedding ceremony. If any children were born from the union, Mr.  Brown named them. One peculiarity on the Brown estate was the fact that  the slaves were allowed no preference or choice as to who his or her  mate would be. Another peculiarity was these married couples were not  permitted to sleep together except when the husband received permission  to spend the night with his wife. Ward is the father of 17 children  whose whereabouts he does not know.    At this point Ward began to smile, and when he was asked the cause of  his mirth, he replied that he was thinking about his fellow slaves  beliefs in conjuring one another. This was done by putting some sort of  wild berries in the person's food. What he can't understand is why some  of this black magic was not tried on the white people since they were  holding the Negroes as slaves.    Ward recalls vividly Sherman's march through Georgia. When Sherman  reached the present site of Hapeville, he bombarded Atlanta with cannon,  afterwards marching through and burning the city. The white residents  made all sorts of frantic attempts to hide their money and other  valuables. Some hiding places were under stumps of trees and in sides of  hills. Incidentally Sherman's army found quite a bit of the hidden  wealth. Slaves were never allowed to talk over events and so very few,  if any, knew about the war or its results for them before it actually  happened. At the time that Sherman marched through Atlanta, Ward and  other slaves were living in an old mansion at the present site of  Peachtree and Baker Streets. He says that Sherman took him and his  fellow slaves as far as Virginia to carry powder and shot to the  soldiers. He states that he himself did not know whether Sherman  intended to keep him in slavery or free him. At the close of the war,  his master, Mr. Brown, became ill and died later. Before His death he  informed the slaves that they could remain on his property or go where  they wanted to. Ward was taken to Mississippi where he remained in  another form of slavery (Peonage System) for 40 years. He remembers when  Atlanta was just a few hills without any buildings. Some of the  buildings he worked on are the Herman Building and the original Kimball  House, a picture of which is attached.    He attributes his old age to his belief in God and living a sane life.  Whenever he feels bad or in low spirits, a drink of coffee or a small  amount of whisky is enough to brace him. He believes that his remedy is  better than that used in slavery which consisted mainly of pills and  castor oil.    With a cheerful good-bye, Ward asked that the writer stop in to see him  again; said that he would rather live in the present age under existing  conditions than live in slavery.          Driskell  JWL 10-12-37    [MR. WILLIAM WARD]      Following is Mr. William Ward's description of the bed called \"The Grand  Rascal.\"    \"De beds dat all o' de slaves slept in wus called 'Grand Rascals'. Dey  wus made on de same order as a box. De way dey made 'em wus like dis:  dey took four strips of narrow wood, each one of 'em 'bout a foot wide,  an' den dey nailed 'em together so dat dey wus in de shape of a square.  Den dey nailed a bottom onto dis square shape. Dis bottom wus called de  slats. When dis wus finished dey set dis box on some legs to keep it  off'n de floor, an' den dey got busy wid de mattress. Dey took ol' oat  sacks an' filled 'em wid straw an' hay an' den dey put dis in de box an'  slept on it. Dere wusn't no springs on dese bunks an' everybody had a  hard time sleepin'.    \"De real name of dese wus 'Sonova-Bitches' but de slaves called 'em  'Grand Rascals' 'cause dey didn't want people to hear 'em use a bad  word.    \"After Sherman come through Atlanta he let de slaves go, an' when he  did, me an' some of de other slaves went back to our ol' masters. Ol'  man Gov. Brown wus my boss man. After de war wus over Ol' man Gordon  took me an' some of de others out to Mississippi. I stayed in peonage  out dere fer 'bout forty years. I wus located at jes' 'bout forty miles  south of Greenwood, an' I worked on de plantations of Ol' man Sara Jones  an' Ol' man Gordon.    \"I couldn't git away 'cause dey watched us wid guns all de time. When de  levee busted dat kinda freed me. Man, dey was devils; dey wouldn't 'low  you to go nowhere--not even to church. You done good to git sumpin' to  eat. Dey wouldn't give you no clothes, an' if you got wet you jes' had  to lay down in whut you got wet in.    \"An', man, dey would whup you in spite of de devil. You had to ask to  git water--if you didn't dey would stretch you 'cross a barrel an' wear  you out. If you didn't work in a hurry dey would whup you wid a strap  dat had five-six holes in it. I ain't talkin' 'bout whut I heard--I'm  talkin' 'bout whut I done see'd.    \"One time dey sent me on Ol' man Mack Williams' farm here in Jasper  County, Georgia. Dat man would kill you sho. If dat little branch on his  plantation could talk it would tell many a tale 'bout folks bein'  knocked in de head. I done seen Mack Williams kill folks an' I done seen  'im have folks killed. One day he tol' me dat if my wife had been good  lookin', I never would sleep wid her again 'cause he'd kill me an' take  her an' raise chilluns off'n her. Dey uster take women away fum dere  husbands an' put wid some other man to breed jes' like dey would do  cattle. Dey always kept a man penned up an' dey used 'im like a stud  hoss.    \"When you didn't do right Ol' Mack Williams would shoot you or tie a  chain 'roun your neck an' throw you in de river. He'd git dem other  niggers to carry dem to de river an' if dey didn't he'd shoot 'em down.  Any time dey didn't do whut he said he would shoot 'em down. He'd tell  'em to \"Ketch dat nigger\", an' dey would do it. Den he would tell 'em to  put de chain 'roun dere neck an' throw 'em in de river. I ain't heard  dis--I done seen it.    \"In 1927 I wus still in peonage but I wus back in Mississippi on  Gordon's farm. When de levee broke in May of dat same year I lost my  wife an' three chilluns. I climbed a tree an' stayed dere fer four days  an' four nights. Airplanes dropped food an' when I got ready to eat I  had to squeeze de water out of de bread. After four days I got out of de  tree an' floated on logs down de river 'till I got to Mobile, Alabama,  an' I wade fum dere to Palmetto, Georgia, where I got down sick. De boss  mans dere called Gov. Harden an' he sent de Grady Hospital examiners  down dere an' got me an' I been in Atlanta since dat time.\"          Willie H. Cole  10-8-37    THE STORY OF AN EX-SLAVE  [MRS. LULA WASHINGTON, Age 84]      Mrs. Lula Washington was born a slave. She claims to be eighty-four  years old.    Mrs. Washington was confined to bed because of a recent accident in  which she received a broken leg.    She is the mother of twenty-three children of which only two are living.  She lives in one room at 64 Butler St., N.E. with one of her daughters.  Since the death of her husband several years ago she has been making her  living as a dray-women, driving a mule and wagon.    Following are some of the events she remembers. \"Ah wuz born in  Randolph, Alabama on de plantation of Marster John Terrell, de sixth  child of my mammy and pappy\".    \"When ah wuz six years old marster John sold me an' my sister, Lize and  brother, Ben to Marster Charlie Henson.\"    \"Marster Charlie wuz good to his niggers.    \"He never whipped dem 'less dey done somethin' awful bad, like stealin  chickens or slipping off de plantation without permission.\"    \"It wuz funny, de white folks would whipped de niggers for stealin' but  if dey saw a hog in de woods, dey would make the niggers catch de hog an  kill him an hide him under dey bushes. Den at night de niggers would  hafta' go down to de spring, build a fire, heat water an skin de hog.\"    \"De man on de plantation next to us' shore wuz mean to his niggers,  Marster Jim Roberts wus his name. He would take his niggers an strip  there clothes to dere waist an' lay dem 'cross a barrel an beat dem 'til  the blood run. Den he would pore salt water on de sore places.\"    \"Oh 'member one time he tied two wimmen by dere thumbs to a limb of a  tree for blessin' out the missus.\"    \"Us had plenty to eat and plenty to wear, calico dresses an' brogan  shoes. Sometimes dere misses would give the wimmen some of her old  clothes\".    \"All de niggers on Marster Charlie's plantation had to work in de field  'cept Malindy Lu, a Mulatto nigger gal. Marster Charlie kept her in de  house to take care of Missus Jane, dat wuz Marster Charlie wife.\"    \"One thing 'bout de mulatto niggers, wuz, dey thought dey wuz better  than de black niggers.

From attacking others, the poet was--in the interval between penning  these election lampoons--called on to defend himself: for this he  seems to have been quite unprepared, though in those yeasty times he  might have expected it. \"I have been surprised, confounded, and  distracted,\" he thus writes to Graham, of Fintray, \"by Mr. Mitchell,  the collector, telling me that he has received an order from your  board to inquire into my political conduct, and blaming me as a person  disaffected to government. Sir, you are a husband and a father: you  know what you would feel, to see the much-loved wife of your bosom,  and your helpless prattling little ones, turned adrift into the world,  degraded and disgraced, from a situation in which they had been  respectable and respected. I would not tell a deliberate falsehood,  no, not though even worse horrors, if worse can be than those I have  mentioned, hung over my head, and I say that the allegation, whatever  villain has made it, is a lie! To the British constitution, on  Revolution principles, next after my God, I am devotedly attached. To  your patronage as a man of some genius, you have allowed me a claim;  and your esteem as an honest man I know is my due. To these, sir,  permit me to appeal: by these I adjure you to save me from that misery  which threatens to overwhelm me, and which with my latest breath I  will say I have not deserved.\" In this letter, another, intended for  the eye of the Commissioners of the Board of Excise, was enclosed, in  which he disclaimed entertaining the idea of a British republic--a  wild dream of the day--but stood by the principles of the constitution  of 1688, with the wish to see such corruptions as had crept in,  amended. This last remark, it appears, by a letter from the poet to  Captain Erskine, afterwards Earl of Mar, gave great offence, for  Corbet, one of the superiors, was desired to inform him, \"that his  business was to act, and not to think; and that whatever might be men  or measures, it was his duty to be silent and obedient.\" The  intercession of Fintray, and the explanations of Burns, were so far  effectual, that his political offense was forgiven, \"only I  understand,\" said he, \"that all hopes of my getting officially forward  are blasted.\" The records of the Excise Office exhibit no trace of  this memorable matter, and two noblemen, who were then in the  government, have assured me that this harsh proceeding received no  countenance at head-quarters, and must have originated with some  ungenerous or malicious person, on whom the poet had spilt a little of  the nitric acid of his wrath.    That Burns was numbered among the republicans of Dumfries I well  remember: but then those who held different sentiments from the men in  power, were all, in that loyal town, stigmatized as democrats: that he  either desired to see the constitution changed, or his country invaded  by the liberal French, who proposed to set us free with the bayonet,  and then admit us to the \"fraternal embrace,\" no one ever believed. It  is true that he spoke of premiers and peers with contempt; that he  hesitated to take off his hat in the theatre, to the air of \"God save  the king;\" that he refused to drink the health of Pitt, saying he  preferred that of Washington--a far greater man; that he wrote bitter  words against that combination of princes, who desired to put down  freedom in France; that he said the titled spurred and the wealthy  switched England and Scotland like two hack-horses; and that all the  high places of the land, instead of being filled by genius and talent,  were occupied, as were the high-places of Israel, with idols of wood  or of stone. But all this and more had been done and said before by  thousands in this land, whose love of their country was never  questioned. That it was bad taste to refuse to remove his hat when  other heads were bared, and little better to refuse to pledge in  company the name of Pitt, because he preferred Washington, cannot  admit of a doubt; but that he deserved to be written down traitor, for  mere matters of whim or caprice, or to be turned out of the unenvied  situation of \"gauging auld wives' barrels,\" because he thought there  were some stains on the white robe of the constitution, seems a sort  of tyranny new in the history of oppression. His love of country is  recorded in too many undying lines to admit of a doubt now: nor is it  that chivalrous love alone which men call romantic; it is a love which  may be laid up in every man's heart and practised in every man's life;  the words are homely, but the words of Burns are always expressive:--        \"The kettle of the kirk and state        Perhaps a clout may fail in't,      But deil a foreign tinkler loon        Shall ever ca' a nail in't.      Be Britons still to Britons true,        Amang ourselves united;      For never but by British hands        Shall British wrongs be righted.\"    But while verses, deserving as these do to become the national motto,  and sentiments loyal and generous, were overlooked and forgotten, all  his rash words about freedom, and his sarcastic sallies about thrones  and kings, were treasured up to his injury, by the mean and the  malicious. His steps were watched and his words weighed; when he  talked with a friend in the street, he was supposed to utter sedition;  and when ladies retired from the table, and the wine circulated with  closed doors, he was suspected of treason rather than of toasting,  which he often did with much humour, the charms of woman; even when he  gave as a sentiment, \"May our success be equal to the justice of our  cause,\" he was liable to be challenged by some gunpowder captain, who  thought that we deserved success in war, whether right or wrong. It is  true that he hated with a most cordial hatred all who presumed on  their own consequence, whether arising from wealth, titles, or  commissions in the army; officers he usually called \"the epauletted  puppies,\" and lords he generally spoke of as \"feather-headed fools,\"  who could but strut and stare and be no answer in kind to retort his  satiric flings, his unfriends reported that it was unsafe for young  men to associate with one whose principles were democratic, and  scarcely either modest or safe for young women to listen to a poet  whose notions of female virtue were so loose and his songs so free.  These sentiments prevailed so far that a gentleman on a visit from  London, told me he was dissuaded from inviting Burns to a dinner,  given by way of welcome back to his native place, because he was the  associate of democrats and loose people; and when a modest dame of  Dumfries expressed, through a friend, a wish to have but the honour of  speaking to one of whose genius she was an admirer, the poet declined  the interview, with a half-serious smile, saying, \"Alas! she is  handsome, and you know the character publicly assigned to me.\" She  escaped the danger of being numbered, it is likely, with the Annas and  the Chlorises of his freer strains.    The neglect of his country, the tyranny of the Excise, and the  downfall of his hopes and fortunes, were now to bring forth their  fruits--the poet's health began to decline. His drooping looks, his  neglect of his person, his solitary saunterings, his escape from the  stings of reflection into socialities, and his distempered joy in the  company of beauty, all spoke, as plainly as with a tongue, of a  sinking heart and a declining body. Yet though he was sensible of  sinking health, hope did not at once desert him: he continued to pour  out such tender strains, and to show such flashes of wit and humour at  the call of Thomson, as are recorded of no other lyrist: neither did  he, when in company after his own mind, hang the head, and speak  mournfully, but talked and smiled and still charmed all listeners by  his witty vivacities.    On the 20th of June, 1795, he writes thus of his fortunes and  condition to his friend Clarke, \"Still, still the victim of  affliction; were you to see the emaciated figure who now holds the pen  to you, you would not know your old friend. Whether I shall ever get  about again is only known to HIM, the Great Unknown, whoso creature I  am. Alas, Clarke, I begin to fear the worst! As to my individual self  I am tranquil, and would despise myself if I were not: but Burns's  poor widow and half-a-dozen of his dear little ones, helpless orphans!  _Here_ I am as weak as a woman's tear. Enough of this! 'tis half my  disease. I duly received your last, enclosing the note: it came  extremely in time, and I am much obliged to your punctuality. Again I  must request you to do me the same kindness. Be so very good as by  return of post to enclose me _another_ note: I trust you can do so  without inconvenience, and it will seriously oblige me. If I must go,  I leave a few friends behind me, whom I shall regret while  consciousness remains. I know I shall live in their remembrance. O,  dear, dear Clarke! that I shall ever see you again is I am afraid  highly improbable.\" This remarkable letter proves both the declining  health, and the poverty of the poet: his digestion was so bad that he  could taste neither flesh nor fish: porridge and milk he could alone  swallow, and that but in small quantities. When it is recollected that  he had no more than thirty shillings a week to keep house, and live  like a gentleman, no one need wonder that his wife had to be obliged  to a generous neighbour for some of the chief necessaries for her  coming confinement, and that the poet had to beg, in extreme need, two  guinea notes from a distant friend.    His sinking state was not unobserved by his friends, and Syme and  M'Murdo united with Dr. Maxwell in persuading him, at the beginning of  the summer, to seek health at the Brow-well, a few miles east of  Dumfries, where there were pleasant walks on"]]]
