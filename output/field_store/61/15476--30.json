A study made by Miriam C.  Gould, of the department of psychology and philosophy in the  University of Pittsburg (_Social Hygiene_, April, 1916), corroborates  our remarks in a striking manner.    She has had confidential chats with 50 young girls, with whom she has  had some acquaintance; of these 50, 25 were college students and 25  were not. She asked them a number of questions, the purpose of which  was to find out what psychologic effect, if any, their knowledge of  prostitution and of venereal disease has had on them. She states in  her conclusions that \"the histories reveal a large percentage of  harmful results, such as conditions bordering upon neurasthenia,  melancholia, pessimism and _sex antagonism_ (italics mine), directly  traceable to this knowledge. Eleven of the girls interviewed developed  a pronounced repulsion for men, although prior to their 'knowledge'  they had enjoyed men's company. They now avoid association with them,  and six have declared that they have totally lost faith in the moral  cleanness of men. Eight have already refused to marry, or intend to do  so, because of their belief that the risk of infection was too great.  If it were not for the existence of these diseases, they say they  would be glad to marry. All of these say their decision has rendered  them more or less unhappy.\"    In the laudable desire to keep our young women pure and to protect  them from infection, in the endeavor to make them demand one moral  standard for both sexes, our exaggerating reformers are condemning  them to lifelong celibacy, which in the case of women often means  lifelong neurasthenia and hypochondria.    =The Truth of the Matter.= Here is the Truth about venereal  disease--the truth as I know it, without concealment on the one hand  and without exaggeration on the other. Exact figures are, of course,  unobtainable anywhere; but results obtained from unbiased  investigations of _different_ classes of society, from hospital  reports, from questionnaires among students, etc., tell us that  probably about twenty per cent. of the adult male population are the  victims of gonorrhea at one time or another; that probably eight or  ten per cent. are not entirely cured when they enter matrimony; and  four or five per cent. (some would say two per cent.) of wives become  infected with gonorrhea. This, I say, is terrible enough, and makes  the greatest care and caution imperative; for, if you should be one of  the victims of the two or five per cent., it would be little  consolation to you that the other ninety-eight or ninety-five per  cent. of wives have escaped.    Of course the percentage of venereal disease among young men, and  afterwards among their wives, will vary greatly with the stratum of  society. Among the \"lower\" strata you may find fifty per cent. of  infection, with a very large percentage of those uncured. Not because  they are of a lower morality than the higher classes, but because the  cheap class of prostitutes that they are obliged to patronize are  frequently diseased and because they cannot afford expert treatment,  or any treatment at all. Among these classes you will naturally find a  much larger percentage of diseased wives. But then to counteract this  we must bear in mind that there are large classes of men in whom  gonorrhea exists only to the extent of five or ten per cent., and we  have large classes of wives among whom the victims of gonorrhea will  come up only to a fraction of one per cent.    The above figures, you see, differ materially from the statements  found in so many sex books that \"80 per cent. of all married men in  New York have gonorrhea,\" and that \"at least three out of every five  [60 per cent.!] married women in New York have gonorrhea.\" Whenever  you read or hear such a statement treat it with a smile--or with  contempt, as all false statements should be treated.    As to syphilis, the extent of the prevalence may be given as between  two and five per cent. Which percentage differs considerable from the  75, 50 or 25 per cent. given us by some sex lecturers, but which is  terrible enough as it is, without any exaggerations.          CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE    GONORRHEA     Source of Gonorrhea--Mucous Membrane of Genital Organs and of Eye    Principal Seats of Disease--Symptoms in Men and in Women--Vagina    Seldom Attacked in Adults--Nobody Inherits Gonorrhea--Ophthalmia    Neonatorum--Differences of Course of Disease in Men and Women--    Gonorrhea Less Painful in Women--Symptoms not Suspected by Woman--    Necessity for the Woman Consulting a Physician--Self-treatment    When Woman Cannot Consult Physician--Formulae for Injections.      The subject of gonorrhea and syphilis is treated pretty fully, from a  layman's point of view, in the author's _Sex Knowledge for Men_. I do  not intend to devote much space to a discussion of the details of  these two diseases here, because the subject is not of such direct  interest to women. Respectable girls and women do not indulge in  illicit relations the same as respectable men and boys do, and their  danger of contracting a venereal disease is insignificant as compared  with men's liability. I will, therefore, touch upon only a few points,  particularly insofar as the diseases differ in their course from the  course pursued in men. Those, however, who are interested may read the  chapters on the subject in the author's _Sex Knowledge for Men_, and  if they want still fuller details, they may study the author's  _Treatment of Gonorrhea and Its Complications in Men and Women_.        [Illustration: GONORRHEAL GERMS.]    =Gonorrhea= is an inflammation caused by a germ called the gonococcus,  discovered by Dr. A. Neisser, of Breslau, Germany, in 1879. Any mucous  membrane may be the seat of gonorrhea, but it attacks by preference  the mucous membrane of the genital organs, and of one other organ--the  eye. Its principal symptoms are: inflammation, pain, burning and  discharge. In men, it attacks the urethra; in women it attacks the  cervix--the neck of the womb--the urethra, and the vulva. The vagina  is seldom attacked in adult women, because the mucous membrane of the  adult vagina is rather tough and does not offer a good soil for the  development of the gonococcus germ. The discharge that a woman has  when she has gonorrhea comes principally or exclusively from the neck  of the womb. In little girls, however, in whom the lining of the  vagina is tender, gonorrhea of the vagina and the vulva is common.  (See chapter Vulvovaginitis in Little Girls.) Gonorrhea is a local  disease. While in some cases, after the disease has lasted for some  time, a certain poison is generated by the germs which circulates in  the blood, and while the germs may occasionally wander into distant  organs, still in 98 per cent. of all cases gonorrhea is a local  disease, and if taken in time is cured without leaving any traces on  the general organism.    =Gonorrhea Not Hereditary.= Then, gonorrhea is not a hereditary  disease. Nobody ever _inherits_ gonorrhea. A child may be born with a  gonorrheal inflammation of the eyes (ophthalmia neonatorum), but this  inflammation is not inherited; it can only be acquired if the mother  is suffering with gonorrhea while the child is being born: some of the  pus in the mother's birth canal gets into the child's eyes while it  passes through the uterus and vagina. This is not heredity; this is  simple infection, and can be avoided by keeping the mother's birth  canal clean by antiseptic douches before childbirth. In short, I  repeat gonorrhea is essentially a local and not a constitutional  disease, and is not hereditary. In which two respects it differs from  syphilis, which is the most constitutional and most hereditary of all  diseases.    =Course of Gonorrhea in Men and Women.= Gonorrhea runs an entirely  different course in women than it does in men. When a man has  gonorrhea he knows it immediately; first, because the discharge tells  him that there is something the matter with him, for a man is not used  to having any discharge from the urethra unless there is something the  matter with him. Second, the urine becomes at once burning and  painful. In women the urethra is a separate canal from the vagina, and  the urethra is very frequently not affected in gonorrhea. The  infection generally starts in the cervix, and the disease may last for  considerable time before the woman becomes aware of it. In general,  gonorrhea is a less painful disease in woman, and this is a bad thing,  because she thus neglects treatment and loses valuable time,  permitting the disease to develop. Even when the urethra is affected  in women, it does not give as severe symptoms as inflammation of the  urethra in men. If the woman does have pains she often pays no  attention to them, because woman is used to pains; as we have seen  before, fifty per cent. of all women suffer more or less with  dysmenorrhea. Many of them have a leucorrheal discharge of greater or  lesser degree, and therefore if there is an increase in the pains, or  an increase in the discharge, little attention is paid to the matter.  In fact, a woman may have a chronic gonorrhea for months or years  without being aware that there is anything the matter with her. It is  important to teach women to seek medical aid as soon as they notice  any increase in the amount of the discharge, or change in color,  particularly if it becomes greenish, or if the odor becomes offensive,  or if there is chafing, burning, or irritation around the genitals,  and particularly if there is an increase in the frequency or urgency  of urination, or if there is a burning, scalding, or cutting sensation  during the act of urination. Also whenever the sexual act becomes  painful.

NICOLAS MARIE GATTEAUX was born in Paris, August 2, 1751, and in the  latter part of the reign of Louis XVI. was appointed engraver of  medals to the king. During the French Revolution he was intrusted with  the execution of various works of art for different branches of the  public service. The process followed in the printing of assignats, of  bills of exchange, and of lottery tickets, as well as the  printing-press which works at the same time with the dry and wet  stamp, were his inventions. He designed and engraved a number of  medals representing eminent persons, or important events of the  period, including three relating to the War of Independence, viz.,  those of General Gates, General Wayne, and Major John Stewart He died  in Paris, June 24, 1832.      HORATIO GATES was born in Malden, England, in 1728. He entered the  British army when young, and served under General Lord Cornwallis in  Nova Scotia, and afterward under General Braddock in his campaign  against Fort Duquesne, but, being severely wounded during the retreat,  left the army and settled in Virginia. Having received a commission as  adjutant-general, with the rank of brigadier, he accompanied  Washington to Cambridge in July, 1775. While commander-in-chief of the  northern army, he defeated General John Burgoyne at Stillwater,  September 17, 1777, and received his surrender at Saratoga on the 17th  of October following, for which most important achievement Congress  gave him a vote of thanks and a gold medal.[31] He was appointed  commander-in-chief of the southern department in June, 1780, but,  being defeated shortly afterward at Camden, on the 16th of August, he  was superseded by General Greene. During the remainder of the war he  played no prominent part, and, at the conclusion of peace, retired to  his estate, in Virginia. In 1790 he removed to New York city, where he  died, April 10, 1806.

October 18, 1777.         Sir: I have the satisfaction to present Your Excellency with the       convention of Saratoga, by which His Excellency       Lieutenant-General Burgoyne has surrendered himself and his whole       army into my hands, and they are now upon their march for Boston.       This signal and important event is the more glorious, as it was       effected with so little loss to the army of the United States.         This letter will be presented to Your Excellency by my       adjutant-general, Colonel Wilkinson, to whom I must beg leave to       refer Your Excellency for the particulars that brought this great       business to so happy and fortunate a conclusion.         I desire to be permitted to recommend this gallant officer in the       warmest manner to Congress, and entreat that he may be continued       in his present office, with the brevet of a brigadier-general.         The honourable Congress will believe me when I assure them that,       from the beginning of this war, I have not met with a more       promising military genius than Colonel Wilkinson, and whose       services have been of the greatest importance to this army.         I am, Sir, Your Excellency's most obedient and humble servant,                                                    Horatio GATES.                                  _____    _Articles of Convention between Major-General Gates and            (p. 011)  Lieutenant-General Burgoyne._         I.         The troops under Lieutenant-General Burgoyne to march out of       their camp, with the honours of war and the artillery of the       intrenchments, to the verge of the river, where the old fort       stood, where the arms and artillery are to be left, the arms to       be piled by word of command from their own officers.         II.         A free passage to be granted to the army under Lieutenant-General       Burgoyne to Great Britain, on condition of not serving again in       North America during the present contest; and the port of Boston       is assigned for the entry of transports to receive the troops       whensoever General Howe shall so order.         III.         Should any cartel take place by which the army under General       Burgoyne, or any part of it, may be exchanged, the foregoing       article to be void, as far as such exchange be made.         IV.         The army under Lieutenant-General Burgoyne to march to       Massachusetts Bay by the easiest, most expeditious and convenient       route, and to be quartered in, near, or as convenient as possible       to, Boston, that the march of the troops may not be delayed when       transports arrive to receive them.         V.         The troops to be supplied, on their march and during their being       in quarters, with provisions, by General Gates's orders, at the       same rate of rations as the troops of his own army; and, if       possible, the officers' horses and cattle are to be supplied with       forage at the usual rates.
