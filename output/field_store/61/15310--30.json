And vpon the next day after, she the said _Anne Nutter_ fell  sicke, and within three weekes after died. And further, this Examinate  saith, That about two yeares agoe, she, this Examinate, hath heard,  That the said _Anne Whittle_, alias _Chattox_, was suspected for  bewitching the drinke of _Iohn Moore_ of Higham Gentleman:[E4_b_2] and  not long after, shee this Examinate heard the said _Chattox_ say, that  she would meet with the said _Iohn Moore_, or his.[E4_b_3] Whereupon a  child of the said _Iohn Moores_, called _Iohn_, fell sick, and  languished about halfe a yeare, and then died: during which  languishing, this Examinate saw the said _Chattox_ sitting in her owne  garden, and a picture of Clay like vnto a child in her Apron; which  this Examinate espying, the said _Anne Chattox_ would haue hidde with  her Apron: and this Examinate declaring the same to her mother, her  mother thought it was the picture of the said _Iohn Moores_ childe.    And she this Examinate further saith, That about sixe or seuen yeares  agoe, the said _Chattox_ did fall out with one _Hugh Moore_ of Pendle,  as aforesaid, about certaine cattell of the said _Moores_, which the  said _Moore_ did charge the said _Chattox_ to haue bewitched: for  which the said _Chattox_ did curse and worry the said _Moore_, and  said she would be Reuenged of the said _Moore_: whereupon the said  _Moore_ presently fell sicke, and languished about halfe a yeare, and  then died. Which _Moore_ vpon his death-bed said, that the said  _Chattox_ had bewitched him to death. And she further saith, That  about sixe yeares agoe, a daughter of the said _Anne Chattox_, called  _Elizabeth_, hauing been at the house of _Iohn Nutter_ of the  Bull-hole, to begge or get a dish full of milke, which she had, and  brought to her mother, who was about a fields breadth of the said  _Nutters_ house, which her said mother _Anne Chattox_ tooke and put  into a Kan, and did charne[F_a_1] the same with two stickes acrosse in  the same field: whereupon the said _Iohn Nutters_ sonne came vnto her,  the said _Chattox_, and misliking her doings, put the said Kan and  milke ouer with his foot; and the morning next after, a Cow of the  said _Iohn Nutters_ fell sicke, and so languished three or foure  dayes, and then died.    In the end being openly charged with all this in open Court; with  weeping teares she humbly acknowledged them to be true,[F_a_2] and  cried out vnto God for Mercy and forgiuenesse of her sinnes, and  humbly prayed my Lord to be mercifull vnto _Anne Redfearne_ her  daughter, of whose life and condition you shall heare more vpon her  Arraignement and Triall: whereupon shee being taken away, _Elizabeth  Deuice_ comes now to receiue her Triall being the next in order, of  whom you shall heare at large.      [Illustration: decoration]    THE ARRAIGNMENT  _and Triall of_ ELIZABETH DEVICE  (_Daughter of_ ELIZABETH SOTHERNES,  alias OLD DEMBDIKE) _late wife of_ IO. DEVICE,  _of the Forrest of Pendle, in the Countie of Lancaster, widow,  for Witchcraft; Vpon Tuesday the eighteenth of August,  at the Assises and generall Gaole-Deliuerie holden at  Lancaster_    Before    _Sir_ EDWARD BROMLEY _Knight, one of his Maiesties  Iustices of Assise at Lancaster._    _Elizabeth Deuice._    O Barbarous and inhumane Monster, beyond example; so farre from  sensible vnderstanding of thy owne miserie, as to bring thy owne  naturall children into mischiefe and bondage; and thy selfe to be a  witnesse vpon the Gallowes, to see thy owne children, by thy deuillish  instructions hatcht vp in Villanie and Witchcraft, to suffer with  thee, euen in the beginning of their time, a shamefull and vntimely  Death. Too much (so it be true) cannot be said or written of her. Such  was her life and condition: that euen at the Barre, when shee came to  receiue her Triall (where the least sparke of Grace or modestie would  haue procured fauour, or moued pitie) she was not able to containe her  selfe within the limits of any order or gouernment: but exclaiming, in  very outragious manner crying out against her owne children, and such  as came to prosecute Indictments & Euidence for the Kings Maiestie  against her, for the death of their Children, Friends, and Kinsfolkes,  whome cruelly and bloudily, by her Enchauntments, Charmes, and  Sorceries she had murthered and cut off; sparing no man with fearefull  execrable curses and banning:[F2_b_] Such in generall was the common  opinion of the Countrey where she dwelt, in the Forrest of Pendle (a  place fit for people of such condition) that no man neere her, neither  his wife, children, goods, or cattell should be secure or free from  danger.    This _Elizabeth Deuice_ was the daughter of _Elizabeth Sothernes_, old  _Dembdike_, a malicious, wicked, and dangerous Witch for fiftie  yeares, as appeareth by Record: and how much longer, the Deuill and  shee knew best with whome shee made her couenant.    It is very certaine, that amongst all these Witches there was not a  more dangerous and deuillish Witch to execute mischiefe, hauing old  _Dembdike_, her mother, to assist her; _Iames Deuice_ and _Alizon  Deuice_, her owne naturall children, all prouided with Spirits, vpon  any occasion of offence readie to assist her.    Vpon her Examination, although Master _Nowel_ was very circumspect,  and exceeding carefull in dealing with her, yet she would confesse  nothing, vntill it pleased God to raise vp a yong maid, _Iennet  Deuice_, her owne daughter, about the age of nine yeares (a witnesse  vnexpected) to discouer all their Practises, Meetings, Consultations,  Murthers, Charmes, and Villanies: such, and in such sort, as I may  iustly say of them, as a reuerend and learned Iudge of this Kingdome  speaketh of the greatest Treason that euer was in this Kingdome, _Quis  haec posteris sic narrare poterit, vt facta non ficta esse videantur?_  That when these things shall be related to Posteritie, they will be  reputed matters fained, not done.    And then knowing, that both _Iennet Deuice_, her daughter, _Iames  Deuice_, her sonne, and _Alizon Deuice_, with others, had accused her  and layed open all things, in their Examinations taken before Master  _Nowel_, and although she were their owne naturall mother, yet they  did not spare to accuse her of euery particular fact, which in her  time she had committed, to their knowledge; she made a very liberall  and voluntarie Confession, as hereafter shall be giuen in euidence  against her, vpon her Arraignment and Triall.    This _Elizabeth Deuice_ being at libertie, after Old _Dembdike_ her  mother, _Alizon Deuice_, her daughter, and old _Chattocks_ were  committed to the Castle of Lancaster for Witchcraft; laboured not a  little to procure a solemne meeting at Malkyn-Tower of the Graund  Witches of the Counties of Lancaster and Yorke, being yet vnsuspected  and vntaken, to consult of some speedie course for the deliuerance of  their friends, the Witches at Lancaster, and for the putting in  execution of some other deuillish practises of Murther and Mischiefe:  as vpon the Arraignement and Triall of _Iames Deuice_, her sonne,  shall hereafter in euery particular point appeare at large against  her.      The first Indictment.    This _Elizabeth Deuice_, late the wife of _Iohn Deuice_, of the  Forrest of Pendle in the Countie of Lancaster Widdow, being indicted,  for that shee felloniously had practized, vsed, and exercised diuers  wicked and deuillish Arts, called _Witch-crafts_, _Inchantments_,  _Charmes_, and _Sorceries_, in, and vpon one _Iohn Robinson_, alias  _Swyer_: and by force of the same felloniously, the said _Iohn  Robinson_, alias _Swyer_, had killed. _Contra pacem, &c._ being at the  Barre was arraigned.      2. Indictment.    The said _Elizabeth Deuice_ was the second time indicted in the same  manner and forme, for the death of _Iames Robinson_, by Witch-craft.  _Contra pacem, &c._      3. Indictment.    The said _Elizabeth Deuice_, was the third time with others, _viz._  _Alice Nutter_, and _Elizabeth Sothernes_, alias _Old-Dembdike_, her  Grand-mother, Indicted in the same manner and forme, for the death of  _Henrie Mytton_. _Contra pacem, &c._    To these three seuerall Indictments vpon her Arraignement, shee  pleaded not guiltie; and for the tryall of her life, put her selfe  vpon God and her Countrie.    So as now the Gentlemen of the Iurie of life and death, stand charged  to finde, whether shee bee guiltie of them, or any of them.    Whereupon there was openly read, and giuen in euidence against her,  for the Kings Majestie, her owne voluntarie Confession and  Examination, when shee was apprehended, taken, and committed to the  Castle of Lancaster by M. _Nowel_, and M. _Bannester_, two of his  Maiesties Iustices of Peace in the same Countie. _viz._           *       *       *       *       *    _The Examination and voluntarie Confession  of_ ELIZABETH DEVICE, _taken at the house of_  IAMES WILSEY _of the Forrest of Pendle, in the Countie  of Lancaster, the seuen and twentieth day of Aprill:  Anno Reg._ IACOBI, _Angl. &c. decimo, & Scotiae_ xlv.    Before    ROGER NOWEL, _and_ NICHOLAS BANNESTER,  _Esquires; two of his Maiesties Iustices of the Peace  within the same Countie._ viz.

We freely attack Holy Scripture on the great  number of stars, saying, \"There are only one thousand and  twenty-eight,[103] we know it.\" There is grass on the earth, we see  it--from the moon we would not see it--and on the grass are leaves, and  in these leaves are small animals; but after that no more.--O  presumptuous man!--The compounds are composed of elements, and the  elements not.--O presumptuous man! Here is a fine reflection.--We must  not say that there is anything which we do not see.--We must then talk  like others, but not think like them.      267    The last proceeding of reason is to recognise that there is an infinity  of things which are beyond it. It is but feeble if it does not see so  far as to know this. But if natural things are beyond it, what will be  said of supernatural?      268    _Submission._--We must know where to doubt, where to feel certain, where  to submit. He who does not do so, understands not the force of reason.  There are some who offend against these three rules, either by affirming  everything as demonstrative, from want of knowing what demonstration is;  or by doubting everything, from want of knowing where to submit; or by  submitting in everything, from want of knowing where they must judge.      269    Submission is the use of reason in which consists true Christianity.      270    _St. Augustine._[104]--Reason would never submit, if it did not judge  that there are some occasions on which it ought to submit. It is then  right for it to submit, when it judges that it ought to submit.      271    Wisdom sends us to childhood. _Nisi efficiamini sicut parvuli._[105]      272    There is nothing so conformable to reason as this disavowal of reason.      273    If we submit everything to reason, our religion will have no mysterious  and supernatural element. If we offend the principles of reason, our  religion will be absurd and ridiculous.      274    All our reasoning reduces itself to yielding to feeling.    But fancy is like, though contrary to feeling, so that we cannot  distinguish between these contraries. One person says that my feeling is  fancy, another that his fancy is feeling. We should have a rule. Reason  offers itself; but it is pliable in every sense; and thus there is no  rule.      275    Men often take their imagination for their heart; and they believe they  are converted as soon as they think of being converted.      276    M. de Roannez said: \"Reasons come to me afterwards, but at first a thing  pleases or shocks me without my knowing the reason, and yet it shocks me  for that reason which I only discover afterwards.\" But I believe, not  that it shocked him for the reasons which were found afterwards, but  that these reasons were only found because it shocks him.      277    The heart has its reasons, which reason does not know. We feel it in a  thousand things. I say that the heart naturally loves the Universal  Being, and also itself naturally, according as it gives itself to them;  and it hardens itself against one or the other at its will. You have  rejected the one, and kept the other. Is it by reason that you love  yourself?      278    It is the heart which experiences God, and not the reason. This, then,  is faith: God felt by the heart, not by the reason.      279    Faith is a gift of God; do not believe that we said it was a gift of  reasoning. Other religions do not say this of their faith. They only  gave reasoning in order to arrive at it, and yet it does not bring them  to it.      280    The knowledge of God is very far from the love of Him.      281    Heart, instinct, principles.      282    We know truth, not only by the reason, but also by the heart, and it is  in this last way that we know first principles; and reason, which has no  part in it, tries in vain to impugn them. The sceptics, who have only  this for their object, labour to no purpose. We know that we do not  dream, and however impossible it is for us to prove it by reason, this  inability demonstrates only the weakness of our reason, but not, as they  affirm, the uncertainty of all our knowledge. For the knowledge of first  principles, as space, time, motion, number, is as sure as any of those  which we get from reasoning. And reason must trust these intuitions of  the heart, and must base them on every argument. (We have intuitive  knowledge of the tri-dimensional nature of space, and of the infinity of  number, and reason then shows that there are no two square numbers one  of which is double of the other. Principles are intuited, propositions  are inferred, all with certainty, though in different ways.) And it is  as useless and absurd for reason to demand from the heart proofs of her  first principles, before admitting them, as it would be for the heart to  demand from reason an intuition of all demonstrated propositions before  accepting them.    This inability ought, then, to serve only to humble reason, which would  judge all, but not to impugn our certainty, as if only reason were  capable of instructing us. Would to God, on the contrary, that we had  never need of it, and that we knew everything by instinct and intuition!  But nature has refused us this boon. On the contrary, she has given us  but very little knowledge of this kind; and all the rest can be acquired  only by reasoning.    Therefore, those to whom God has imparted religion by intuition are very  fortunate, and justly convinced. But to those who do not have it, we can  give it only by reasoning, waiting for God to give them spiritual  insight, without which faith is only human, and useless for salvation.      283    _Order.--Against the objection that Scripture has no order._    The heart has its own order; the intellect has its own, which is by  principle and demonstration. The heart has another. We do not prove that  we ought to be loved by enumerating in order the causes of love; that  would be ridiculous.    Jesus Christ and Saint Paul employ the rule of love, not of intellect;  for they would warm, not instruct. It is the same with Saint Augustine.  This order consists chiefly in digressions on each point to indicate the  end, and keep it always in sight.      284    Do not wonder to see simple people believe without reasoning. God  imparts to them love of Him and hatred of self. He inclines their heart  to believe. Men will never believe with a saving and real faith, unless  God inclines their heart; and they will believe as soon as He inclines  it. And this is what David knew well, when he said: _Inclina cor meum,  Deus, in ..._[106]      285    Religion is suited to all kinds of minds. Some pay attention only to its  establishment,[107] and this religion is such that its very  establishment suffices to prove its truth. Others trace it even to the  apostles. The more learned go back to the beginning of the world. The  angels see it better still, and from a more distant time.      286    Those who believe without having read the Testaments, do so because they  have an inward disposition entirely holy, and all that they hear of our  religion conforms to it. They feel that a God has made them; they desire  only to love God; they desire to hate themselves only. They feel that  they have no strength in themselves; that they are incapable of coming  to God; and that if God does not come to them, they can have no  communion with Him. And they hear our religion say that men must love  God only, and hate self only; but that all being corrupt and unworthy of  God, God made Himself man to unite Himself to us. No more is required to  persuade men who have this disposition in their heart, and who have this  knowledge of their duty and of their inefficiency.      287    Those whom we see to be Christians without the knowledge of the prophets  and evidences, nevertheless judge of their religion as well as those who  have that knowledge. They judge of it by the heart, as others judge of  it by the intellect. God Himself inclines them to believe, and thus they  are most effectively convinced.    I confess indeed that one of those Christians who believe without proofs  will not perhaps be capable of convincing an infidel who will say the  same of himself. But those who know the proofs of religion will prove  without difficulty that such a believer is truly inspired by God, though  he cannot prove it himself.    For God having said in His prophecies (which are undoubtedly  prophecies), that in the reign of Jesus Christ He would spread His  spirit abroad among nations, and that the youths and maidens and  children of the Church would prophesy;[108] it is certain that the  Spirit of God is in these, and not in the others.      288    Instead of complaining that God had hidden Himself, you will give Him  thanks for having revealed so much of Himself; and you will also give  Him thanks for not having revealed Himself to haughty sages, unworthy to  know so holy a God.    Two kinds of persons know Him: those who have a humble heart, and who  love lowliness, whatever kind of intellect they may have, high or low;  and those who have sufficient understanding to see the truth, whatever  opposition they may have to it.      289    _Proof._--1. The Christian religion, by its establishment, having  established itself so strongly, so gently, whilst contrary to  nature.--2. The sanctity, the dignity, and the humility of a Christian  soul.--3. The miracles of Holy Scripture.--4. Jesus Christ in  particular.--5. The apostles in particular.--6. Moses and the prophets  in particular.--7. The Jewish people.--8. The prophecies.--9.  Perpetuity; no religion has perpetuity.--10. The doctrine which gives a  reason for everything.--11. The sanctity of this law.--12. By the course  of the world.    Surely, after considering what is life and what is religion, we should  not refuse to obey the inclination to follow it, if it comes into our  heart; and it is "]]]
