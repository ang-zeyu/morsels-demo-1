But, again, if it be false that _All men are wise_, it is always true  that _Some are not wise_; for though in denying that 'wise' is a  predicate of 'All men' we do not deny it of each and every man, yet we  deny it of 'Some men.' Of 'Some men,' therefore, by the principle of  Excluded Middle, 'not-wise' is to be affirmed; and _Some men are  not-wise_, is by obversion equivalent to _Some men are not wise_.  Similarly, if it be false that _No men are wise_, which by obversion is  equivalent to _All men are not-wise_, then it is true at least that  _Some men are wise_.    By extending and enforcing the doctrine of relative terms, certain other  inferences are implied in the contrary and contradictory relations of  propositions. We have seen in chap. iv. that the contradictory of a  given term includes all its contraries: 'not-blue,' for example,  includes red and yellow. Hence, since _The sky is blue_ becomes by  obversion, _The sky is not not-blue_, we may also infer _The sky is not  red_, etc. From the truth, then, of any proposition predicating a given  term, we may infer the falsity of all propositions predicating the  contrary terms in the same relation. But, on the other hand, from the  falsity of a proposition predicating a given term, we cannot infer the  truth of the predication of any particular contrary term. If it be false  that _The sky is red_, we cannot formally infer, that _The sky is blue_  (_cf._ chap. iv. Sec. 8).    Sec. 8. Sub-contrariety is the relation of two propositions, concerning the  same matter that may both be true but are never both false. This is the  case with I. and O. If it be true that _Some men are wise_, it may also  be true that _Some (other) men are not wise_. This follows from the  maxim in chap. vi. Sec. 6, not to go beyond the evidence.    For if it be true that _Some men are wise_, it may indeed be true that  _All are_ (this being the subalternans): and if _All are_, it is (by  contradiction) false that _Some are not_; but as we are only told that  _Some men are_, it is illicit to infer the falsity of _Some are not_,  which could only be justified by evidence concerning _All men_.    But if it be false that _Some men are wise_, it is true that _Some men  are not wise_; for, by contradiction, if _Some men are wise_ is false,  _No men are wise_ is true; and, therefore, by subalternation, _Some men  are not wise_ is true.    Sec. 9. The Square of Opposition.--By their relations of Subalternation,  Contrariety, Contradiction, and Sub-contrariety, the forms A. I. E. O.  (having the same matter) are said to stand in Opposition: and Logicians  represent these relations by a square having A. I. E. O. at its corners:    A.      Contraries      E.    S    Co             s   S  u      nt          e    u  b        ra       i     b  a          di    r      a  l            ct o       l  t            ct o       t  e          di    r      e  r        ra       i     r  n      nt          e    n  s    Co             s   s    I.   Sub-contraries     O.    As an aid to the memory, this diagram is useful; but as an attempt to  represent the logical relations of propositions, it is misleading. For,  standing at corners of the same square, A. and E., A. and I., E. and O.,  and I. and O., seem to be couples bearing the same relation to one  another; whereas we have seen that their relations are entirely  different. The following traditional summary of their relations in  respect of truth and falsity is much more to the purpose:        (1) If A. is true,   I. is true,     E. is false,    O. is false.      (2) If A. is false,  I. is unknown,  E. is unknown,  O. is true.      (3) If I. is true,   A. is unknown,  E. is false,    O. is unknown.      (4) If I. is false,  A. is false,    E. is true,     O. is true.      (5) If E. is true,   A. is false,    I. is false,    O. is true.      (6) If E. is false,  A. is unknown,  I. is true,     O. is unknown.      (7) If O. is true,   A. is false,    I. is unknown,  E. is unknown.      (8) If O. is false,  A. is true,     I. is true,     E. is false.    Where, however, as in cases 2, 3, 6, 7, alleging either the  falsity of universals or the truth of particulars, it follows that two  of the three Opposites are unknown, we may conclude further that one of  them must be true and the other false, because the two unknown are  always Contradictories.    Sec. 10. Secondary modes of Immediate Inference are obtained by applying  the process of Conversion or Obversion to the results already obtained  by the other process. The best known secondary form of Immediate  Inference is the Contrapositive, and this is the converse of the obverse  of a given proposition. Thus:            DATUM.                  OBVERSE.          CONTRAPOSITIVE.        A. _All S is P_      .'. _No S is not-P_       .'. _No not-P is S_      I. _Some S is P_     .'. _Some S is not not-P_ .'. (none)      E. _No S is P_       .'. _All S is not-P_      .'. _Some not-P is S_      O. _Some S is not P_ .'. _Some S is not-P_     .'. _Some not-P is S_    There is no contrapositive of I., because the obverse of I. is in the  form of O., and we have seen that O. cannot be converted. O., however,  has a contrapositive (_Some not-P is S_); and this is sometimes given  instead of the converse, and called the 'converse by negation.'    Contraposition needs no justification by the Laws of Thought, as it is  nothing but a compounding of conversion with obversion, both of which  processes have already been justified. I give a table opposite of the  other ways of compounding these primary modes of Immediate Inference.                         A                I               E                 O  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------              1 All A is B       Some A is B       No A is B        Some A is not B    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------    Obverse   2 No A is b        Some A is not b   All A is b       Some A is b    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------    Converse  3 Some B is A      Some B is A       No B is A    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------    Obverse  of        4 Some B is not a  Some B is not a   All B is a  Converse    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------    Contra-  positive  5 No b is A                          Some b is A      Some b is A    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------    Obverse  of        6 All b is a                         Some b is not a  Some b is not a  Contrapos    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------    Converse  of  Obverse   7                                    Some a is B  of  Converse    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------    Obverse  of  Converse  of        8                                    Some a is not b  Obverse  of  Converse    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------    Converse  of  Obverse   9 Some a is b  of  Contrapos    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------    Obverse  of  Converse  of       10 Some a is not B  Obverse  of  Contrapos    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------    In this table _a_ and _b_ stand for _not-A_ and _not-B_ and had better  be read thus: for _No A is b, No A is not-B_; for _All b is a_ (col. 6),  _All not-B is not-A_; and so on.    It may not, at first, be obvious why the process of alternately  obverting and converting any proposition should ever come to an end;  though it will, no doubt, be considered a very fortunate circumstance  that it always does end. On examining the results, it will be found that  the cause of its ending is the inconvertibility of O. For E., when  obverted, becomes A.; every A, when converted, degenerates into I.;  every I., when obverted, becomes O.; O cannot be converted, and to  obvert it again is merely to restore the former proposition: so that the  whole process moves on to inevitable dissolution. I. and O. are  exhausted by three transformations, whilst A. and E. will each endure  seven.    Except Obversion, Conversion and Contraposition, it has not been usual  to bestow special names on these processes or their results. But the  form in columns 7 and 10 (_Some a is B--Some a is not B_), where the  original predicate is affirmed or denied of the contradictory of the  original subject, has been thought by Dr. Keynes to deserve a  distinctive title, and he has called it the 'Inverse.' Whilst the  Inverse is one form, however, Inversion is not one process, but is  obtained by different processes from E. and A. respectively. In this it  differs from Obversion, Conversion, and Contraposition, each of which  stands for one process.    The Inverse form has been objected to on the ground that the inference  _All A is B .'. Some not-A is not B_, distributes _B_ (as predicate of a  negative proposition), though it was given as undistributed (as  predicate of an affirmative proposition). But Dr. Keynes defends it on  the ground that (1) it is obtained by obversions and conversions which  are all legitimate and (2) that although _All A is B_ does not  distribute _B_ in relation to _A_, it does distribute _B_ in relation to  some _not-A_ (namely, in relation to whatever _not-A_ is _not-B_). This  is one reason why, in stating the rule in chap. vi. Sec. 6, I have  written: \"an immediate inference ought to contain nothing that is not  contained, _or formally implied_, in the proposition from which it is  inferred\"; and have maintained that every term formally implies its  contradictory within the _suppositio_.

Their passionate regrets were more than either he  or his good wife could withstand.    \"I will _stay_,\" he said; \"you may unpack my goods, and we will live for  the Lord lovingly together.\"    It was out of this heart experience that the tender hymn was born.        Our fears, our hopes, our aims are one,        Our comforts and our cares.    Dr. Fawcett died July 25, 1817.    Tune, \"Boylston,\" L. Mason; or \"Dennis,\" H.G. Naegeli.      \"I LOVE THY KINGDOM, LORD.\"    \"Dr. Dwight's Hymn,\" as this is known _par eminence_ among many others  from his pen, is one of the imperishable lyrics of the Christian Church.  The real spirit of the hundred and twenty-second Psalm is in it, and it  is worthy of Watts in his best moments.    Timothy Dwight was born at Northampton, Mass, May 14, 1752, and  graduated at Yale College at the age of thirteen. He wrote several  religious poems of considerable length. In 1795 he was elected President  of Yale College, and in 1800 he revised Watts' Psalms, at the request of  the General Association of Connecticut, adding a number of translations  of his own.        I love Thy kingdom, Lord,        The house of Thine abode,      The Church our blest Redeemer saved        With His own precious blood.        I love Thy Church, O God;        Her walls before Thee stand,      Dear as the apple of Thine eye,        And graven on Thy hand.    Dr. Dwight died Jan. 11, 1817.    Tune, \"St. Thomas,\" Aaron Williams, (1734-1776.)    Mr. Hubert P. Main, however, believes the author to be Handel. It  appeared as the second movement of a four-movement tune in Williams's  1762 collection, which contained pieces by the great masters, with his  own; but while not credited to Handel, Williams did not claim it  himself.      \"MID SCENES OF CONFUSION.\"    This hymn, common in chapel hymnbooks half a century and more ago, is  said to have been written by the Rev. David Denham, about 1826.      _THE TUNE._    \"Home, Sweet Home\" was composed, according to the old account, by John  Howard Payne as one of the airs in his opera of \"Clari, the Maid of  Milan,\" which was brought out in London at Drury Lane in 1823. But  Charles Mackay, the English poet, in the London Telegraph, asserts that  Sir Henry Bishop, an eminent musician, in his vain search for a Sicilian  national air, _invented_ one, and that it was the melody of \"Home, sweet  Home,\" which he afterwards set to Howard Payne's words. Mr. Mackay had  this story from Sir Henry himself.        Mid scenes of confusion and creature complaints      How sweet to my soul is communion with saints,      To find at the banquet of mercy there's room      And feel in the presence of Jesus at home.        Home, home, sweet, sweet home!      Prepare me, dear Savior for glory, my home.    John Howard Payne, author at least, of the original _words_ of \"Home,  Sweet Home,\" was born in New York City June 9, 1791. He was a singer,  and became an actor and theatrical writer. He composed the words of his  immortal song in the year 1823, when he was himself homeless and hungry  and sheltered temporarily in an attic in Paris.    His fortunes improved at last, and he was appointed to represent his  native country as consul in Tunis, where he died, Apr. 9, 1852.      \"O, COULD I SPEAK THE MATCHLESS WORTH.\"    The writer of this hymn of worshiping ardor and exalted Christian love  was an English Baptist minister, the Rev. Samuel Medley. He was born at  Cheshunt, Hertfordshire, June 23, 1738, and at eighteen years of age  entered the Royal Navy, where, though he had been piously educated, he  became dissipated and morally reckless. Wounded in a sea fight off Cape  Lagos, and in dread of amputation he prayed penitently through nearly a  whole night, and in the morning the surprised surgeon told him his limb  could be saved.    The voice of his awakened conscience was not wholly disregarded, though  it was not till some time after he left the navy that his vow to begin a  religious life was sincerely kept. After teaching school for four years,  he began to preach in 1766, Wartford in Hertfordshire being the first  scene of his godly labors. He died in Liverpool July 17, 1799, at the  end of a faithful ministry there of twenty-seven years. A small edition  of his hymns was published during his lifetime, in 1789.        O could I speak the matchless worth,      O could I sound the glories forth        Which in my Saviour shine,      I'd soar and touch the heavenly strings      And vie with Gabriel while he sings,        In notes almost divine!      _THE TUNE._    \"Colebrook,\" a plain choral; but with a noble movement, by Henry Smart,  is the English music to this fine lyric, but Dr. Mason's \"Ariel\" is the  American favorite. It justifies its name, for it has wings--in both full  harmony and duet--and its melody feels the glory of the hymn at every  bar.      \"ROCK OF AGES CLEFT FOR ME.\"    Augustus Montagu Toplady, author of this almost universal hymn, was born  at Farnham, Surrey, Eng., Nov. 4, 1740. Educated at Westminster School,  and Trinity College, Dublin, he took orders in the Established Church.  In his doctrinal debates with the Wesleys he was a harsh  controversialist; but his piety was sincere, and marked late in life by  exalted moods. Physically he was frail, and his fiery zeal wore out his  body. Transferred from his vicarage at Broad Hembury, Devonshire, to  Knightsbridge, London, at twenty-eight years of age, his health began to  fail before he was thirty-five, and in one of his periods of illness he  wrote--        When languor and disease invade        This trembling house of clay,     'Tis sweet to look beyond my pains        And long to fly away.    And the same homesickness for heaven appears under a different figure in  another hymn--        At anchor laid remote from home,      Toiling I cry, \"Sweet Spirit, come!      Celestial breeze, no longer stay,      But swell my sails, and speed my way!\"    Possessed of an ardent religious nature, his spiritual frames  exemplified in a notable degree the emotional side of Calvinistic piety.  Edward Payson himself, was not more enraptured in immediate view of  death than was this young London priest and poet. Unquestioning faith  became perfect certainty. As in the bold metaphor of \"Rock of Ages,\" the  faith finds voice in--        A debtor to mercy alone,    --and other hymns in his collection of 1776, two years before the end  came. Most of this devout writing was done in his last days, and he  continued it as long as strength was left, until, on the 11th of August,  1778, he joyfully passed away.    Somehow there was always something peculiarly heartsome and \"filling\" to  pious minds in the lines of Toplady in days when his minor hymns were  more in vogue than now, and they were often quoted, without any idea  whose making they were. \"At anchor laid\" was crooned by good old ladies  at their spinning-wheels, and godly invalids found \"When languor and  disease invade\" a comfort next to their Bibles.    \"Rock of Ages\" is said to have been written after the author, during a  suburban walk, had been forced to shelter himself from a thunder  shower, under a cliff. This is, however, but one of several stories  about the birth-occasion of the hymn.    It has been translated into many languages. One of the foreign  dignitaries visiting Queen Victoria at her \"Golden Jubilee\" was a native  of Madagascar, who surprised her by asking leave to sing, but delighted  her, when leave was given, by singing \"Rock of Ages.\" It was a favorite  of hers--and of Prince Albert, who whispered it when he was dying.  People who were school-children when Rev. Justus Vinton came home to  Willington, Ct., with two Karen pupils, repeat to-day the \"la-pa-ta,  i-oo-i-oo\" caught by sound from the brown-faced boys as they sang their  native version of \"Rock of Ages.\"    Gen. J.E.B. Stuart, the famous Confederate Cavalry leader, mortally  wounded at Yellow Tavern, Va., and borne to a Richmond hospital, called  for his minister and requested that \"Rock of Ages\" be sung to him.    The last sounds heard by the few saved from the wreck of the steamer  \"London\" in the Bay of Biscay, 1866, were the voices of the helpless  passengers singing \"Rock of Ages\" as the ship went down.    A company of Armenian Christians sang \"Rock of Ages\" in their native  tongue while they were being massacred in Constantinople.    No history of this grand hymn of faith forgets the incident of Gladstone  writing a Latin translation of it while sitting in the House of  Commons. That remarkable man was as masterly in his scholarly  recreations as in his statesmanship. The supreme Christian sentiment of  the hymn had permeated his soul till it spoke to him in a dead language  as eloquently as in the living one; and this is what he made of it:      _TOPLADY._        Rock of ages, cleft for me,      Let me hide myself in Thee;      Let the water and the blood,      From Thy riven side which flowed,      Be of sin the double cure,      Cleanse me from its guilt and power.        Not the labor of my hands      Can fulfil Thy law's demands;      Could my zeal no respite know,      Could my tears for ever flow,      All for sin could not atone,      Thou must save, and Thou alone.        Nothing in my hand I bring,      Simply to Thy cross I cling;      Naked, come to Thee for dress,      Helpless, look to Thee for grace:      Foul, I to the fountain fly;      Wash, me, Saviour, or I die.        Whilst I draw this fleeting breath,      When my eyestrings break in death;      When I soar through tracts unknown,      See Thee on Thy judgment throne,      Rock of ages, cleft for me,      Let me hide myself in Thee.      _GLADSTONE._        Jesus, pro me perforatus,      Condar intra tuum latus;      Tu per lympham profluentem,      Tu per sanguinem tepentem,"]]]
