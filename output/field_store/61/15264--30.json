Tell where you saw them. How  many persons were there? What were they doing? Describe each person,  noting especially anything odd or picturesque in looks, dress, or  behavior. Were they carrying anything? What expressions did they have on  their faces? Did they seem pleased with their new surroundings? Was  anyone trying to help them? Could they speak English? If possible,  report a few fragments of their conversation. Did you have a chance to  find out what they thought of America? Do you know what has become of  them, and how they are getting along?    =A Fragment of my Autobiography=:--Did you, as a child, move into a  strange town, or make a visit in a place entirely new to you? Tell  rather briefly why you went and what preparations were made. Then give  an account of your arrival. What was the first thing that impressed you?  What did you do or say? What did the grown people say? Was there  anything unusual about the food, or the furniture, or the dress of the  people? Go on and relate your experiences, telling any incidents that  you remember. Try to make your reader share the bewilderment and  excitement you felt. Did anyone laugh at you, or make fun of you, or  hurt your feelings? Were you glad or sorry that you had come? Finish  your story by telling of your departure from the place, or of your  gradually getting used to your new surroundings.    Try to recall some other experiences of your childhood. Write them out  quite fully, giving space to your feelings as well as to the events.

WARBLE FOR LILAC-TIME    WALT WHITMAN          Warble me now for joy of lilac-time (returning in reminiscence),      Sort me, O tongue and lips for Nature's sake, souvenirs of        earliest summer,      Gather the welcome signs (as children with pebbles or        stringing shells),      Put in April and May, the hylas croaking in the ponds, the elastic air,      Bees, butterflies, the sparrow with its simple notes,      Blue-bird and darting swallow, nor forget the high-hole        flashing his golden wings,      The tranquil sunny haze, the clinging smoke, the vapor,      Shimmer of waters with fish in them, the cerulean above,      All that is jocund and sparkling, the brooks running,      The maple woods, the crisp February days, and the sugar-making,      The robin where he hops, bright-eyed, brown-breasted,      With musical clear call at sunrise and again at sunset,      Or flitting among the trees of the apple-orchard, building the        nest of his mate,      The melted snow of March, the willow sending forth its        yellow-green sprouts,      For spring-time is here! the summer is here! and what is this in        it and from it?      Thou, soul, unloosen'd--the restlessness after I know not what;      Come, let us lag here no longer, let us be up and away!        O if one could but fly like a bird!      O to escape, to sail forth as in a ship!      To glide with thee, O soul, o'er all, in all, as a ship o'er        the waters;      Gathering these hints, the preludes, the blue sky, the grass,         the morning drops of dew,      The lilac-scent, the bushes with dark-green heart-shaped leaves,      Wood-violets, the little delicate pale blossoms called innocence,      Samples and sorts not for themselves alone, but for their atmosphere,      To grace the bush I love--to sing with the birds,      A warble for joy of lilac-time, returning in reminiscence.      SUGGESTIONS FOR STUDY    What is the meaning of \"sort me\"? Why jumble all these signs of summer  together? Does one naturally think in an orderly way when recalling the  details of spring or summer? Can you think of any important points that  the author has left out? Is _samples_ a poetic word? What is meant by  the line \"not for themselves alone,\" etc.? Note the sound-words in the  poem: What is their value here? Read the lines slowly to yourself, or  have some one read them aloud, and see how many of them suggest little  pictures. Note the punctuation: Do you approve? Is this your idea of  poetry? What is poetry? Would this be better if it were in the full form  of verse? Can you see why the critics have disagreed over Whitman's  poetry?          WHEN I HEARD THE LEARN'D ASTRONOMER    WALT WHITMAN          When I heard the learn'd astronomer,      When the proofs, the figures, were ranged in columns before me,      When I was shown the charts and diagrams, to add, divide        and measure them,      When I sitting heard the astronomer where he lectured with much        applause in the lecture-room,      How soon unaccountable I became tired and sick,      Till rising and gliding out I wander'd off by myself,      In the mystical moist night-air, and from time to time,      Look'd up in perfect silence at the stars.      SUGGESTIONS FOR STUDY    Why did the listener become tired of the lecturer who spoke with much  applause? What did he learn from the stars when he was alone out of  doors? Does he not think the study of astronomy worth while? What would  be his feeling toward other scientific studies? What do you get out of  this poem? What do you think of the way in which it is written?          VIGIL STRANGE I KEPT ON THE FIELD ONE NIGHT    WALT WHITMAN          Vigil strange I kept on the field one night;      When you my son and my comrade dropt at my side that day,      One look I but gave which your dear eyes return'd with a look        I shall never forget,      One touch of your hand to mine, O boy, reach'd up as you lay        on the ground,      Then onward I sped in the battle, the even-contested battle,      Till late in the night reliev'd to the place at last again I made        my way,      Found you in death so cold dear comrade, found your body,        son of responding kisses (never again on earth responding),      Bared your face in the starlight, curious the scene,        cool blew the moderate night-wind,      Long there and then in vigil I stood,        dimly around me the battle-field spreading,      Vigil wondrous and vigil sweet there in the fragrant silent night,      But not a tear fell, not even a long-drawn sigh, long, long I gazed,      Then on the earth partially reclining sat by your side        leaning my chin in my hands,      Passing sweet hours, immortal and mystic hours with you dearest        comrade--not a tear, not a word,      Vigil of silence, love and death, vigil for you my son and my soldier,      As onward silently stars aloft, eastward new ones upward stole,      Vigil final for you brave boy, (I could not save you, swift was        your death,      I faithfully loved you and cared for you living,        I think we shall surely meet again,)      Till at latest lingering of the night, indeed just as the        dawn appear'd,      My comrade I wrapt in his blanket, envelop'd well his form,      Folded the blanket well, tucked it carefully over head and        carefully under feet,      And there and then and bathed by the rising sun, my son in his grave,        in his rude-dug grave I deposited,      Ending my strange vigil with that, vigil of night and battlefield dim,      Vigil for boy of responding kisses (never again on earth responding),      Vigil for comrade swiftly slain, vigil I never forget,        how as day brighten'd,      I rose from the chill ground and folded my soldier well in his blanket,      And buried him where he fell.      SUGGESTIONS FOR STUDY    What is a vigil? Was Whitman ever in battle? Does he mean himself  speaking? Was the boy really his son? Is the man's calmness a sign that  he does not care? Why does he call the vigil \"wondro"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17164"],[0,"Narrative of a Mission to Central Africa Performed in the Years 1850-51, Volume (#20)"],[1,"of labourers or  gardeners occur frequently. A man this day valued a date-palm at a  mahboub, and I am told that the greater number are not worth more than a  shilling of English money. To avert the evil eye from the gardens, the  people put up the head of an ass, or some portion of the bones of that  animal. The same superstition prevails in all the oases that stud the  north of Africa, from Egypt to the Atlantic, but the people are  unwilling to explain what especial virtue there exists in an ass's  skull. We go sometimes to shoot doves in the gardens; but these birds  are very shy, and after the first shot fly from tree to tree and keep  out of range. So we stroll about making observations, to console  ourselves for the loss of sport. We noticed several cotton-bushes, but  this useful plant is not cultivated here except that it may ornament the  gardens with its green. I have just eaten of the heart of the date-tree.  It is of a very delicious bitter, and is a choice dish at feasts.    I met with a number of the suburban inhabitants engaged in celebrating a  wedding. First came a group of women, dancing and throwing themselves  into a variety of slow, languid, and lascivious postures, to the sound  of some very primitive string-instrument. Towards this group all the  women of the neighbouring huts were gathering, some merely as  spectators, others bringing dishes of meat. Beyond was a crowd of men,  among whom was the bridegroom helping the musicians to make a noise.  These musicians were an old man and old woman, each above ninety years  of age. The latter beat a calabash with a stick, whilst the former drew  a bow over a single string tied to another calabash. The bridegroom had  got hold of a brass kettle, with which he supplied his contribution to  the din. Preparations for supper were going on; and, the harmony  announcing this fact, idlers were coming in flocks from the distant  hamlets and the fields. Two new huts had been built, one for the bride  and the other for the bridegroom.    These marriages produce very few children, which may partly arise from  licentiousness, but chiefly, no doubt, from misery. I afterwards saw the  burial of an old lady, which ceremony set the whole town in motion. The  women screamed in crowds, and a great number of men went outside the  walls to see the body consigned to its last resting-place. Yusuf  pretends that the burial took place two hours after decease, which is  the ordinary practice here, although thirty-two hours are said to be the  proper time.    To the 21st of May I was occupied in preparing a short report on Fezzan,  with statements of the expedition and other necessary documents.    We have had a grand dinner at the house of the Greek doctor Paniotti.  The Bey, Bim Bashaw, his adjutant, the treasurer, and others were  invited. The French have boasted of the number of their dishes, but I  think the Turks beat them hollow in this particular. Besides two whole  lambs, fowls, pigeons, there were at least twenty made dishes, with  every variety of rich sweetmeat. Amongst the early fruits of the season  we had figs and apples. The dinner was not quite so merry as  Gagliuffi's, the champagne being absent.    We had a smart rain-shower in the morning, and in the evening also there  was a tempest of wind and lightning, and a little rain. The flashes were  very vivid, and lighted up the whole firmament.    The Tibboos persist in saying that there is plenty of water in their  country, abundance of rain, frequent springs; and some go so far as to  describe their streams as running a distance of from one to eight days'  journey. They acknowledge, however, that the soil of their country is  not very favourable to much cultivation of grain and fruit. Perhaps they  want to attract visitors, but are not likely to succeed at present.  Justly or unjustly, they bear a very bad character; and in Mourzuk, to  call a man a Tibboo is rather worse than to call a man a Jew in Europe.    _June 1st_, Post-day.--Letters, private and public, were forwarded. It  is now determined that we shall start for Ghat next Wednesday; at any  rate the Germans talk of doing so, whilst I am inclined to wait for  Hateetah and his escort. It would be imprudent to run the risk of a  disaster at this early stage of our proceedings, and my greater  responsibility renders me more cautious, and perhaps more timid, than my  enthusiastic companions. I am engaged in finishing my last despatches  and reports, collecting Arabic descriptions of Fezzan, one of which is  by the Bash Kateb, and corresponding on the future expenditure of the  Mission. The weather has become very hot with the advancing season, but  I am now pretty well used to the heat. The thermometer has risen to  103 deg.; in Bornou it rarely exceeds 105 deg.: I may hope, therefore, to brave  the sun's rays under or near the line.    Few incidents worth recording mark the latter days of our stay at  Mourzuk. I paid a visit to Abd-el-Kader, the Sheikh of the Pilgrims.  This holy person is quite humanized, and talks freely of the politics of  the Barbary coast. He entertained myself, the German, the Greek doctor,  and Gagliuffi with tea; and this at _sunset_, when all the other  pilgrims were at their prayers. He is a Tuatee of Gharai, and has been  many times to Mekka in his present capacity. Indeed he makes the journey  about once every three years. The pilgrim caravans travel very fast; no  others can keep up with them. On leaving any place where they have  halted, the Sheikh has the privilege of demanding the release of two or  three prisoners; and the scandalous whisper that any Barabbas can  sometimes obtain his liberty by a judicious investment of presents. When  encamped near a town, moreover, the tent of the Sheikh becomes an  inviolable asylum for every criminal who chooses to take refuge there.  Many other privileges equally valuable are enjoyed by this functionary.  Abd-el-Kader himself is an extremely urbane gentleman, and we retired  quite satisfied with our reception. He gave me a vocabulary of the  Tuatee dialect, and some account of the statistics of the place, which I  forwarded to the Foreign Office. It appears that formerly the people of  Tuat paid to the Algerines five hundred camel-loads of dates and ten  _necks_ of gold, i.e. the gold ornaments sometimes worn round the  camels' necks. When the French made their conquest, they sent to the  Tuatees to renew their tribute to them as the actual masters of Algeria.  The answer returned was, \"Come and take the tribute!\"    _11th._--The gardens continue to attract my evening strolls. Every one  is now busy sowing ghaseb, and I passed a half hour in working with some  cheerful labourers at the preparation of the ground, smoothing the soil  in the squares for irrigation. They were amused at my voluntary  industry. I sleep now late of mornings after my evening exercise in the  gardens, and find myself the better for it.    Perhaps the first melons ever eaten at Mourzuk appeared on Mr.  Gagliuffi's table about this time; they were very good.    _12th._--The Germans were preparing to start early in the morning; they  are obliged to lighten everything, and reduce each camel load to two and  a-half, or even two cantars. The Tuaricks will not carry more; generally  their maharees are small, and they have few stray camels. The Germans  went off in good style and great spirits. They propose to accompany a  caravan of Tanelkum Tuaricks, who go by way of Aroukeen, leaving Ghat  far on the right. I was not able to persuade them to delay their  departure, so that we might all travel together: but it may be expected  that they will not find it so very easy or safe to get through this  country without the special protection of those who claim authority over  it.    Two or three days of gheblee succeeded--unpleasant weather to be out in  the desert. I found it bad enough at Mourzuk--100 deg. in the shade at four  o'clock in the afternoon. Hateetah was reported to be on the road; so I  determined to wait five or six days for him, and thus not deviate from  my original plan.    I went to visit the wife of Mohammed Es-Sfaxee, who goes with us to  Soudan as a merchant, carrying a considerable quantity of goods on  account of M. Gagliuffi: this gentleman accompanied me. The object of  our visit was to see whether the Sfaxee had left a sufficient quantity  of provisions with his wife to support her during his absence. It is  necessary to take such precautions with these Moors, who often  barbarously abandon their families, without any adequate provision, for  months and even for years together. We found that he had left dates,  wheat, and a little olive-oil and mutton-fat--the ordinary stock of all  families in Fezzan. Only a few rich people indulge in such luxuries as  coffee, sugar, meat, and liquid butter.    An Arab saying: \"You must always put other people's things on your head,  and your own under your arm. Then, if there be danger of the things  falling off your head, you must raise your arm, and let fall your own  things to save those of others.\" I do not know what things I shall let  fall of my own; but this I know, that during my whole residence in  Mourzuk my mind has been continually occupied in endeavouring to save  Government money. But I have received little assistance.    The weather still continues hot, with wind from the south: however, I  walked in the gardens. On the 16th, the boat went off to the caravan;  the camels carried it very easily, to the astonishment of the good  people of Mourzuk. On the 17th, the thermometer was at 102 deg. in the  shade--in the sun, about 130 deg.. We received letters in answer to those  first written from Mourzuk, and learned that all the despatches written  on the road for Tripoli had arrived in safety. The Arabs, therefore, are  not quite so bad as they are represented.    _20th._--At length Hateetah may be said to be reported \"in sight,\""]]]
