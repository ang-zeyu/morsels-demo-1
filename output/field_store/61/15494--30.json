I must have felt immediately  after that it was a mere leap of unreasonable nerves; for the man was  only a dark dot in the distance, and I could only just see that he was  standing quite still and gazing, with his head a little on one side.  There was no earthly logical evidence that he was looking at me; he  might have been looking at a ship, or the sunset, or the sea-gulls,  or at any of the people who still strayed here and there on the shore  between us. Nevertheless, whatever my start sprang from was prophetic;  for, as I gazed, he started walking briskly in a bee-line towards us  across the wide wet sands. As he drew nearer and nearer I saw that  he was dark and bearded, and that his eyes were marked with dark  spectacles. He was dressed poorly but respectably in black, from the old  black top hat on his head to the solid black boots on his feet. In spite  of these he walked straight into the sea without a flash of hesitation,  and came on at me with the steadiness of a travelling bullet.    \"I can't tell you the sense of monstrosity and miracle I had when he  thus silently burst the barrier between land and water. It was as if he  had walked straight off a cliff and still marched steadily in mid-air.  It was as if a house had flown up into the sky or a man's head had  fallen off. He was only wetting his boots; but he seemed to be a demon  disregarding a law of Nature. If he had hesitated an instant at the  water's edge it would have been nothing. As it was, he seemed to look so  much at me alone as not to notice the ocean. Philip was some yards away  with his back to me, bending over his net. The stranger came on till  he stood within two yards of me, the water washing half-way up to  his knees. Then he said, with a clearly modulated and rather mincing  articulation: 'Would it discommode you to contribute elsewhere a coin  with a somewhat different superscription?'    \"With one exception there was nothing definably abnormal about him. His  tinted glasses were not really opaque, but of a blue kind common enough,  nor were the eyes behind them shifty, but regarded me steadily. His dark  beard was not really long or wild--, but he looked rather hairy, because  the beard began very high up in his face, just under the cheek-bones.  His complexion was neither sallow nor livid, but on the contrary rather  clear and youthful; yet this gave a pink-and-white wax look which  somehow (I don't know why) rather increased the horror. The only oddity  one could fix was that his nose, which was otherwise of a good shape,  was just slightly turned sideways at the tip; as if, when it was soft,  it had been tapped on one side with a toy hammer. The thing was hardly  a deformity; yet I cannot tell you what a living nightmare it was to  me. As he stood there in the sunset-stained water he affected me as some  hellish sea-monster just risen roaring out of a sea like blood. I don't  know why a touch on the nose should affect my imagination so much. I  think it seemed as if he could move his nose like a finger. And as if he  had just that moment moved it.    \"'Any little assistance,' he continued with the same queer, priggish  accent, 'that may obviate the necessity of my communicating with the  family.'    \"Then it rushed over me that I was being blackmailed for the theft of  the bronze piece; and all my merely superstitious fears and doubts were  swallowed up in one overpowering, practical question. How could he  have found out? I had stolen the thing suddenly and on impulse; I was  certainly alone; for I always made sure of being unobserved when I  slipped out to see Philip in this way. I had not, to all appearance,  been followed in the street; and if I had, they could not 'X-ray' the  coin in my closed hand. The man standing on the sand-hills could no more  have seen what I gave Philip than shoot a fly in one eye, like the man  in the fairy-tale.    \"'Philip,' I cried helplessly, 'ask this man what he wants.'    \"When Philip lifted his head at last from mending his net he looked  rather red, as if sulky or ashamed; but it may have been only the  exertion of stooping and the red evening light; I may have only had  another of the morbid fancies that seemed to be dancing about me. He  merely said gruffly to the man: 'You clear out of this.' And, motioning  me to follow, set off wading shoreward without paying further attention  to him. He stepped on to a stone breakwater that ran out from among the  roots of the sand-hills, and so struck homeward, perhaps thinking our  incubus would find it less easy to walk on such rough stones, green and  slippery with seaweed, than we, who were young and used to it. But my  persecutor walked as daintily as he talked; and he still followed  me, picking his way and picking his phrases. I heard his delicate,  detestable voice appealing to me over my shoulder, until at last, when  we had crested the sand-hills, Philip's patience (which was by no means  so conspicuous on most occasions) seemed to snap. He turned suddenly,  saying, 'Go back. I can't talk to you now.' And as the man hovered and  opened his mouth, Philip struck him a buffet on it that sent him flying  from the top of the tallest sand-hill to the bottom. I saw him crawling  out below, covered with sand.    \"This stroke comforted me somehow, though it might well increase my  peril; but Philip showed none of his usual elation at his own prowess.  Though as affectionate as ever, he still seemed cast down; and before  I could ask him anything fully, he parted with me at his own gate,  with two remarks that struck me as strange. He said that, all things  considered, I ought to put the coin back in the Collection; but that  he himself would keep it 'for the present'. And then he added quite  suddenly and irrelevantly: 'You know Giles is back from Australia?'\"    The door of the tavern opened and the gigantic shadow of the  investigator Flambeau fell across the table. Father Brown presented him  to the lady in his own slight, persuasive style of speech, mentioning  his knowledge and sympathy in such cases; and almost without knowing,  the girl was soon reiterating her story to two listeners. But Flambeau,  as he bowed and sat down, handed the priest a small slip of paper. Brown  accepted it with some surprise and read on it: \"Cab to Wagga Wagga, 379,  Mafeking Avenue, Putney.\" The girl was going on with her story.    \"I went up the steep street to my own house with my head in a whirl; it  had not begun to clear when I came to the doorstep, on which I found a  milk-can--and the man with the twisted nose. The milk-can told me the  servants were all out; for, of course, Arthur, browsing about in his  brown dressing-gown in a brown study, would not hear or answer a bell.  Thus there was no one to help me in the house, except my brother, whose  help must be my ruin. In desperation I thrust two shillings into the  horrid thing's hand, and told him to call again in a few days, when I  had thought it out. He went off sulking, but more sheepishly than I had  expected--perhaps he had been shaken by his fall--and I watched the  star of sand splashed on his back receding down the road with a horrid  vindictive pleasure. He turned a corner some six houses down.    \"Then I let myself in, made myself some tea, and tried to think it out.  I sat at the drawing-room window looking on to the garden, which still  glowed with the last full evening light. But I was too distracted and  dreamy to look at the lawns and flower-pots and flower-beds with any  concentration. So I took the shock the more sharply because I'd seen it  so slowly.    \"The man or monster I'd sent away was standing quite still in the middle  of the garden. Oh, we've all read a lot about pale-faced phantoms in the  dark; but this was more dreadful than anything of that kind could ever  be. Because, though he cast a long evening shadow, he still stood in  warm sunlight. And because his face was not pale, but had that waxen  bloom still upon it that belongs to a barber's dummy. He stood quite  still, with his face towards me; and I can't tell you how horrid  he looked among the tulips and all those tall, gaudy, almost  hothouse-looking flowers. It looked as if we'd stuck up a waxwork  instead of a statue in the centre of our garden.    \"Yet almost the instant he saw me move in the window he turned and ran  out of the garden by the back gate, which stood open and by which he had  undoubtedly entered. This renewed timidity on his part was so different  from the impudence with which he had walked into the sea, that I felt  vaguely comforted. I fancied, perhaps, that he feared confronting Arthur  more than I knew. Anyhow, I settled down at last, and had a quiet  dinner alone (for it was against the rules to disturb Arthur when he was  rearranging the museum), and, my thoughts, a little released, fled to  Philip and lost themselves, I suppose. Anyhow, I was looking blankly,  but rather pleasantly than otherwise, at another window, uncurtained,  but by this time black as a slate with the final night-fall. It seemed  to me that something like a snail was on the outside of the window-pane.  But when I stared harder, it was more like a man's thumb pressed on the  pane; it had that curled look that a thumb has. With my fear and courage  re-awakened together, I rushed at the window and then recoiled with a  strangled scream that any man but Arthur must have heard.    \"For it was not a thumb, any more than it was a snail. It was the tip  of a crooked nose, crushed against the glass; it looked white with  the pressure; and the staring face and eyes behind it were at first  invisible and afterwards grey like a ghost. I slammed the shutters  together somehow, rushed up to my room and locked myself in.

Lady Selkirk  had shown his family many kindnesses. To now come to her house as a  robber and pillager, seemed the blackest ingratitude; but, on the  other hand, he had no right to permit his personal feelings to  interfere with his duty to the crew. The sailors had followed him into  danger many a time, and this was their first opportunity for financial  reward. And, even if it was fair to deny them this chance to make a  little prize-money, it would hardly be safe to sow the seeds of  discontent among the crew while on a cruise in waters infested with  the enemy's ships. With a sigh Jones abandoned his intention of  protecting the property of Lady Selkirk, and ordered his lieutenant to  proceed to the castle, and capture the family plate. Jones himself  returned to the ship, resolved to purchase the spoils at open sale,  and return them to their former owner.    The blue-jackets continued their way up the highway, and, turning  aside where a heavy gate opened into a stately grove, demanded of an  old man who came, wondering, out of the lodge, that he give them  instant admittance. Then, swinging into a trot, they ran along the  winding carriage-drive until they came out on the broad lawn that  extended in front of the castle. Here for the first time they were  seen by the inmates of the castle; and faint screams of fear, and  shouts of astonishment, came from the open windows of the stately  pile. The men-servants came rushing out to discover who the lawless  crowd that so violated the sanctity of an English earl's private park  could be; but their curiosity soon abated when a few stout  blue-jackets, cutlass and pistol in hand, surrounded them, and bade  them keep quiet. The lieutenant, with two stout seamen at his back,  then entered the castle, and sought out the mistress, who received him  with calm courtesy, with a trace of scorn, but with no sign of fear.    Briefly the lieutenant told his errand. The countess gave an order to  a butler, and soon a line of stout footmen entered, bearing the plate.  Heavy salvers engraved with the family arms of Lord Selkirk, quaint  drinking-cups and flagons curiously carved, ewers, goblets, platters,  covers, dishes, teapots, and all kinds of table utensils were there,  all of exquisitely artistic workmanship, and bearing the stamp of  antiquity. When all was ready, the lieutenant called in two of the  sailors from the lawn; and soon the whole party, bearing the captured  treasure, disappeared in the curves of the road.    This incident, simple enough in reality, the novelist Fenimore Cooper  has made the germ of one of his exquisite sea-tales, \"The Pilot.\"  British historians have made of it an example by which to prove the  lawlessness and base ingratitude of Paul Jones. As may readily be  imagined, it stirred up at the time the most intense excitement in  England. Jones became the bugbear of timid people. His name was used  to frighten little children. He was called pirate, traitor,  free-booter, plunderer. It was indeed a most audacious act that he had  committed. Never before or since had the soil of England been trodden  by a hostile foot. Never had a British peer been forced to feel that  his own castle was not safe from the invader. Jones, with his handful  of American tars, had accomplished a feat which had never before been  accomplished, and which no later foeman of England has dared to  repeat. It is little wonder that the British papers described him as a  bloodthirsty desperado.    A few weeks later, the captured plate was put up for sale by the prize  agents. Capt. Jones, though not a rich man, bought it, and returned it  to the countess. Lord Selkirk, in acknowledging its receipt, wrote,--    \"And on all occasions, both now and formerly, I have done you the  justice to tell that you made an offer of returning the plate very  soon after your return to Brest; and although you yourself were not  at my house, but remained at the shore with your boat, that you had  your officers and men in such extraordinary good discipline, that your  having given them the strictest orders to behave well,--to do no  injury of any kind, to make no search, but only to bring off what  plate was given them,--that in reality they did exactly as was  ordered; and that not one man offered to stir from his post on the  outside of the house, nor entered the doors, nor said an uncivil word;  that the two officers stayed not one-quarter of an hour in the parlor  and in the butler's pantry while the butler got the plate together,  behaved politely, and asked for nothing but the plate, and instantly  marched their men off in regular order; and that both officers and men  behaved in all respects so well, that it would have done credit to the  best-disciplined troops whatever.\"    But the British took little notice of the generous reparation made by  Capt. Jones, and continued to hurl abuse and hard names at him.    Jones was vastly disappointed at his failure to capture the person of  Lord Selkirk. The story of the sufferings of his countrymen in British  prisons worked upon his heart, and he longed to take captive a  personage whom he could hold as hostage. But, soon after leaving St.  Mary's Isle, he fell in again with the British man-of-war \"Drake;\" and  as a result of this encounter he had prisoners enough to exchange for  many hapless Americans languishing in hulks and prisons.    After the wind and tide had defeated the midnight attempt made by  Jones to capture the \"Drake,\" that craft had remained quietly at her  anchorage, little suspecting that the bay of Carrickfergus had held so  dangerous a neighbor. But soon reports of the \"Ranger's\" depredations  began to reach the ears of the British captain. The news of the  desperate raid upon Whitehaven became known to him. He therefore  determined to leave his snug anchorage, and go in search of the  audacious Yankee. Just as the captain of the \"Drake\" had reached this  determination, and while he was making sail, the \"Ranger\" appeared off  the mouth of the harbor.    The \"Drake\" promptly sent out a boat to examine the strange craft, and  report upon her character. Jones saw her coming, and resolved to throw  her off the scent. Accordingly, by skilful seamanship, he kept the  stern of the \"Ranger\" continually presented to the prying eyes in the  British boat. Turn which way they might, be as swift in their  manoeuvres as they might, the British scouts could see nothing of the  \"Ranger\" but her stern, pierced with two cabin windows, as might be  the stern of any merchantman. Her sides, dotted with frowning ports,  were kept securely hidden from their eyes.    Though provided with spy-glasses, the people in the boat were totally  deceived. Unsuspectingly they came up under the stern of the \"Ranger,\"  and demanded to come on board. As the officer in command clambered up  a rope, and vaulted the taffrail to the quarter-deck, he saw Paul  Jones and his lieutenants, in full uniform, standing before him.    \"Why,--why, what ship's this?\" stammered the astonished officer.    \"This is the American Continental ship 'Ranger,' and you are my  prisoner,\" responded Jones; and at the words a few sailors, with  cutlasses and pistols, called to the men in the boat alongside, to  come aboard and give themselves up.    From his captives Jones learned that the news of the Whitehaven raid  had reached the \"Drake\" only the night before; and that she had been  re-enforcing her crew with volunteers, preparatory to going out in  search of the \"Ranger.\" As he stood talking to the captured British  naval officer, Jones noticed slender columns of smoke rising from the  woods on neighboring highlands, where he knew there were no houses.    \"What does that mean?\" he asked.    \"Alarm fires, sir,\" answered the captive; \"the news of your descent  upon Whitehaven is terrifying the whole country.\"    Soon, however, the attention of the Americans was diverted from the  signal-fires to the \"Drake.\" An appearance of life and bustle was  observable about the boat. The shrill notes of the boatswain's  whistle, and the tramp of men about the capstan, came faintly over the  waters. The rigging was full of sailors, and the sails were being  quickly spread to catch the fresh breeze. Soon the ship began to move  slowly from her anchorage; she heeled a little to one side, and,  responsive to her helm, turned down the bay. She was coming out to  look after her lost boat.    Jones determined to hold his ground, and give battle to the  Englishman. He at once began to prepare for battle in every way  possible without alarming the enemy. The great guns were loaded and  primed. Cutlasses and pistols were brought up from the armorer's room,  and placed in convenient locations on the main deck, so that the  boarders might find them when needed. The powder-monkeys, stripped for  action, and the handlers and cartridge-makers entered the  powder-magazine, and prepared to hand out the deadly explosive. The  cook and his assistant strewed sawdust and ashes about the decks, to  catch the blood, and keep the men from slipping. Every one was busy,  from the captain down to the galley-boy.    There was plenty of time to prepare; for the tide was out, and the  \"Drake,\" beating down a narrow channel, made but slow headway. The  delay was a severe strain upon the nerves of the men, who stood silent  and grim at their quarters on the American ship, waiting for the fight  to begin. At such a moment, even the most courageous must lose heart,  as he thinks upon the terrible ordeal through which he must pass.  Visions of home and loved ones flit before his misty eyes; and Jack  chokes down a sob as he hides his emotion in nervously fingering the  lock of his gun, or taking a squint through the port-holes at the"]]]
