It is  supposed throughout Europe, that the Emperor carried off immense  treasures; but his camp-plate, his camp bed, and a few broken down  horses, are the only objects which he has preserved, or which he  wished to preserve. Like Saladin, he could cause an outcry to be made  at his door, whilst he exposes our tatters,--behold all that Napoleon  the Great, the conqueror of the universe, has retained from his  conquests!\"    The General was as good as his word: he introduced me to Madame la  Marechale. I was enchanted by her manners and her amiability. Our  conversation turned upon France and the Isle of Elba, the present and  the future; and on quitting Madame Bertrand, I did not know what I  ought most to admire--the lively graces of her mind, or the dignity  and energy of her character.    At eleven o'clock I attended, to present myself to the Emperor. They  made me wait in his saloon on the ground floor. The striped silk  hangings were half worn out and faded; the carpet was threadbare, and  patched in several places; a few shabby arm chairs completed the  furniture of the apartment. I thought upon the splendour of the  imperial palaces, and I drew a deep and melancholy sigh. The Emperor  arrived: he had assumed a degree of calmness in his manner, which was  belied by his eyes. It was easy to see that he had been violently  agitated. \"Sir,\" said he, \"I declared to you yesterday, that I  retained you in my service. I repeat the same to you to-day. From this  instant you belong to me, and I hope you will fulfil your duties  towards me like a good and faithful subject: you swear that you  will--is it not so?\"--\"Yes, Sire, I swear.\"--\"That's right.\" After a  pause, \"I had foreseen the crisis to which France would come, but I  did not think that things were so ripe. It was my intention not to  interfere any longer in political affairs. The intelligence which you  have brought to me has changed my resolutions. I have caused the  misfortunes of France; therefore I must remove them: but before I  commit myself, I wish to have a thorough knowledge of the state of  our affairs. Sit down: repeat to me all that you told me yesterday; I  like to hear you.\"    Re-assured by these words, and by a look full of kindness and  benignity, I abandoned myself without reserve to all the inspirations  of my heart and soul. The picture which I drew of the sufferings and  hopes of the nation, which I presented to the Emperor, was so touching  and so animated, that he was astonished. \"You are a noble young  fellow,\" said he, \"you have truly the soul of a Frenchman; but are you  not carried away by your imagination?\"--\"No, Sire; the recital which I  have made to your Majesty is quite faithful. I may have expressed  myself with warmth, because I cannot express my feelings otherwise;  but all that I have told you is exact and true. Under such important  circumstances, I should have thought it a crime to substitute the  inspirations of my imagination in the place of truth.\"--\"You therefore  think that France awaits her redemption from me; that I shall be  received as a deliverer.\"--\"Yes, Sire; I will even say more: the royal  government is so exceedingly hateful and disgusting to the French, the  government weighs so very heavily on the nation and the army, that not  only your Majesty, but any body else who would endeavour to liberate  the French would find them disposed to second him.\"--Napoleon (with  dignity): \"Repeat that to me again.\"--\"Yes, Sire, I do repeat it. The  French are so wearied, and degraded, and incensed, by the  anti-national yoke of the emigrants and the priests, that they are  ready to join any one who will promise to deliver them.\"--\"But if I  were to disembark in France, is there not reason to fear that the  patriots may be massacred by the emigrants and the chouans?\"--\"No,  Sire, I do not think so; we are the most numerous and the bravest  party.\"--\"Yes, but they may heap you in the prisons, and cut your  throats.\"--\"Sire, the people will not let them do that.\"--\"I hope you  may not be deceived; to be sure, I shall get to Paris so speedily,  that they won't have time to consider where they are to hide their  heads. I shall be there as soon as the news of my disembarkation....  Yes,\" the Emperor continued, after taking a few steps, \"I have  resolved.... It was I who gave the Bourbons to France, and it is I who  must rid France of them.... I will set off.... The enterprise is vast,  it is difficult, it is dangerous, but it is not beyond me. On great  occasions fortune has never abandoned me.... I shall set off, but not  alone; I won't run the risk of allowing myself to be collared by the  gensdarmes. I will depart with my sword, my Polanders, my grenadiers  ... all France is on my side. I belong to France; and for her I will  sacrifice my repose, my blood, my life, with the greatest joy.\" After  this speech, the Emperor stopped; his eyes sparkled with hope and  genius: his attitude announced energy, confidence, victory; he was  grand, he was beautiful, he was adorable!--he resumed his discourse,  and said, \"Do you think that they will dare to wait for me?\"--\"No,  Sire.\"--\"I don't think so, either: they will quake when they hear the  thunder of my name; and they will know that they can only escape me by  a speedy flight. But what will be the conduct of the national guards?  Do you think they will fight for them?\"--\"I think, Sire, that the  national guards will remain neutral.\"--\"Even that's a great deal; as  to their 'gardes du corps,' and their red regiments, I am not afraid  of them: they are either old men or boys: they will be frightened by  the mustachios of my grenadiers. I will make my grenadiers hoist the  national flag;\" lifting up his voice and his hand: \"I will appeal to  my old soldiers; I will speak to them. None of them will refuse to  hear the voice of their old general.... It is certain that the  soldiers cannot hesitate to choose between the white flag and the  tricoloured flag; between me, by whom they have been covered with  rewards and glory, and the Bourbons, who wish to dishonour them....  And the Marshals, what will they do?\"--\"The Marshals, who are full of  money and titles, have nothing to wish for but repose. They would fear  to compromise their existence by embracing a doubtful party; and  perhaps they will continue merely spectators of the crisis. Perhaps  even the fear lest your Majesty may possibly punish them for their  defection or treason in 1814 may induce them to adhere to the  king.\"--\"I will punish no one. Do you take me rightly? Tell M. ****  clearly, that I will forget every thing. We have all reason to  reproach each other.\"--\"Sire, I will tell him so with the greatest  joy. This assurance will completely gain all opinions over to your  side; because even amongst your partisans there are men who dread your  return; lest you should revenge yourself.\"--\"Yes, I know that it is  thought that I am revengeful, and even sanguinary; that I am  considered as a kind of ogre, as a man-eater. They are mistaken: I  will make every one do his duty, and I will be obeyed; and that's  all. A weak sovereign is a calamity to his subjects. If he allows  criminals and traitors to fancy that he does not know how to punish,  there is no longer any security either for the state or for  individuals. More crimes are prevented than repressed by severity. A  sovereign must govern by his head, and not by his heart. Yet, tell  X*** that I except Talleyrand, Augereau, and the Duke of Ragusa, out  of the general pardon. They caused all our misfortunes. The country  must be revenged.\"--\"But why exclude them, Sire? Is there not reason  to fear that this exclusion may deprive you of the fruits of your  clemency, and may even raise doubts as to your sincerity in  future?\"--\"It would be much more exposed to doubt were I to pardon  them.\"--\"But, Sire....\"--\"Don't you trouble your head about it ...  what is the strength of the army?\"--\"Sire, I do not know; I only know  that it has been much weakened by desertion and by discharges, and  that few of the regiments consist of more than three hundred  men.\"--\"So much the better; those who are good for nothing have  probably left the army; the good soldiers will have remained. Do you  know the names of the officers who command the maritime districts, and  the eighth division?\"--\"No, Sire.\"--Napoleon (out of temper), \"Why  did not X*** give you that information?\"--\"Sire, both M. X*** and  myself were far from supposing that your Majesty would immediately  embrace the glorious resolution of re-appearing in France; besides  which, he might believe, according to the common report, that your  agents did not allow you to remain in ignorance of any circumstance  which might interest you.\"--\"I do know that the newspapers gave out  that I had agents.... It is an idle story. It is true that I sent some  of my people to France, in order to learn what was going on; but they  stole my money, and only treated me with the gabble of the canaille.  C**** has been to see me, but he knew nothing. You are the first  person from whom I have ascertained the situation of France and the  Bourbons under all its extensive bearings. Had it not been for you, I  should never have known that the hour of my return had struck. Had it  not been for you, they would have left me here to dig in my garden. I  have received--I do not exactly know from what quarter--the  description of certain assassins, hired against me; and one or two  anonymous letters besides--all from the same hand, in which I was told  to remain quiet, that the embroideries were coming into fashion, and  other nonsense in the same style; but that's all.

After Dewey's wonderful victory in Manila Bay,  many naval experts said that such a fight could not be duplicated, yet  it was duplicated two months later off Santiago Bay in a manner that  left no doubt of American supremacy on the sea. Then when it came to  fighting on land, our army was designated as \"paper\" soldiers, that is,  soldiers on paper or in name only, and it was said that their guns would  be found of little use against the Mausers of Spain. But this was  likewise false; and to-day the army and navy of the United States are  respected everywhere. And more than this, foreign powers have come to  our country for many of their war-ships, asking us to build and equip  them, and also asking us to make cannon and rifles for them.    While the war was on in Cuba, a part of the United States army under  General Miles was sent to Porto Rico, another island belonging to Spain.  Here the inhabitants hailed the Americans with delight, and the  resistance by the Spanish soldiers was only half-hearted.    With the downfall of the navy and Santiago, Spain knew not what to do  next, and gladly received the terms of peace offered by President  McKinley and his advisers. The terms were accepted on August 9, and thus  the short but sharp war came to a termination. By the treaty of peace  Cuba was given her liberty, and Porto Rico and the Philippines passed  into the possession of the United States.          CHAPTER XVIII    LAST DAYS IN CUBA--THE DEPARTURE FOR HOME--ARRIVAL AT MONTAUK--CARING  FOR THE SICK AND WOUNDED--PRESENTATION TO THEODORE ROOSEVELT BY HIS  MEN--MUSTERING-OUT OF THE ROUGH RIDERS      Four days after the surrender of Santiago the Rough Riders found  themselves in the hills four or five miles back from the intrenchments  they had occupied during the last fight. Other commands were scattered  in various directions, for to let them go into the wretched city would  have been out of the question. Santiago was dirty in the extreme; the  fever was there, and hundreds were on the verge of starvation.    It was a trying time for everybody, and equally so for Theodore  Roosevelt, who did all in his power, as before, to make his men  comfortable. When it did not rain, the sun came out fiercely, causing a  rapid evaporation that was thoroughly exhausting to the soldiers. The  locality was not a healthy one, and soon scores of Rough Riders and  others were down with malaria or fever. Doctors and surgeons were  scarce, and hospital accommodations were scanty, and again and again did  Colonel Roosevelt send down on his own account to the seacoast and to  Santiago for food and medicines of which his command were in dire need.  He was now colonel of the Rough Riders in reality, his promotion having  been granted to him just one week after the heroic charge up San Juan  Hill. His old colonel, Wood, was installed at Santiago as military  governor. This, for the time being, left Colonel Roosevelt in command of  the cavalry brigade, no small honor to one who had been, but a few  months before, a stranger to military duties.    During this time in camp, Theodore Roosevelt visited Santiago and the  forts at the entrance to the harbor, and with the pen of a skilled  author he has, in one of his books, given us vivid pictures of the  sights to be seen there at that time--the crooked streets with their  queer shops, the wretched inhabitants, the grim and frowning forts, all  hemmed in by the towering mountains and the sea. He likewise tells of  his trips to the mountains, and how his companions were usually  exhausted by the climbing done. For one who in his youth had been so  delicate, he stood the exposure remarkably well, for which he was  thankful.    For some time the authorities at Washington did not know what to do with  the troops in Cuba. It was suggested that they move up to higher ground,  or to another neighborhood. But General Shafter knew, and so did all of  the officers under him, that to keep the army in the island would only  mean more sickness and death.    \"I will go to the general with a protest,\" said Colonel Roosevelt. And  he did so. Meanwhile the other head officers drew up a letter of  protest, and this was signed by all, including the commander of the  Rough Riders. In his own letter Roosevelt protested against the  treatment of his men in the matter of rations, clothing, and hospital  accommodations, and in the other letter, called by the officers a Round  Robin, there was a protest about remaining in Cuba longer, with the  fever getting worse every day. These letters were made public through  the press of the United States, with the result that the troops were  ordered home without further delay.    The Rough Riders left Cuba on August 7, just six weeks and a half after  landing. The time spent in the island had been short, but to many it  seemed an age. None were sorry to depart, although sad to think that  some of the sick had to be left behind.    The transport used this time was the _Miami_, and Mr. Roosevelt tells us  that, taken as a whole, the accommodations were better than they had  been on the _Yucatan_. But on the trip much trouble was had with some of  the stokers and engineers, who insisted upon drinking some liquor  smuggled aboard.    \"I will not permit this,\" said Colonel Roosevelt. And he read the  disorderly ones a strong lecture and made them give up their liquor.  After that, as there was much grumbling, he set a guard; and that was  the end of that trouble.    The destination of the transport was Montauk, on the extreme eastern  shore of Long Island. The trip took nine days,--rather a dreary time to  those anxious to see their native land once more. When an anchorage was  gained, a gunboat came out to the transport with the welcome news that  Spain had agreed to our terms.    The sick had still to be cared for; yet, taken as a whole, the month  spent at the camp at Montauk was pleasant enough. Here Colonel Roosevelt  met that part of the regiment that had been left behind in Florida, and  all the stories of the fights had to be told over and over again.    \"It was good to meet the rest of the regiment,\" says Mr. Roosevelt, in  his book. \"They all felt dreadfully at not having been in Cuba. Of  course those who stayed had done their duty precisely as did those who  went.\" Which was true; yet, as he adds, those who had been left behind  could not be comforted.    Colonel Roosevelt was still in charge of the brigade while at Montauk,  and much of his time was taken up in getting out necessary reports, and  seeing to it that the entire camp was kept in first-class sanitary  condition.    \"And he was up to the mark,\" said one of those who were there. \"He  didn't allow the least bit of dirt, and everything had to be as  shipshape as if we were at West Point. And it was a good thing, too, for  it kept the sickness from spreading.\"    The sea-breeze is strong at Montauk, and this soon began to tell upon  all who were sick, putting in them new life and vigor. Here every  possible attention was given to those who were down, so that ere long  many were up again and as well as ever.    When he had a little time to himself, Theodore Roosevelt would gather a  few friends around him, and either go to the beach to bathe or go off on  a long horseback ride. War was to him a thing of the past, and he was  once more willing to become a private citizen as of old.    In those days the camp at Montauk was constantly crowded with visitors  from New York City and elsewhere, who poured in upon every train. All of  the soldiers who had been to Cuba were hailed as heroes, and had to tell  their stories many times.    \"Every soldier had a crowd following him,\" said one private. \"The  visitors wanted to know how we had fought, how we had been treated by  the government, how things looked in Cuba, and a hundred and one  other things. Most of the visitors, especially the ladies, wanted our  autographs, and I had to write mine as many as forty times a day. I  remember one of the men, a cowboy from Oklahoma, couldn't write, and he  got so upset over this that every time somebody asked him for his  autograph he would run away, saying he had forgotten to do something  that he had been ordered to do. When I and some chums went down to New  York to look around, all the folks stared at us, and many insisted on  shaking hands and treating.\"    [Illustration: COLONEL ROOSEVELT AT MONTAUK POINT. (_Photograph by Pach  Bros., New York._)]    The uniforms the Rough Riders had worn in Cuba were in rags, and many  had boarded the transport barefooted. The rags were saved as trophies of  the occasion, and many are still in existence.    At Camp Wykoff, as the place was called, there was a large hospital for  the sick, and to this many came to do what they could for the sufferers,  who were now given every possible attention. Among the visitors was Miss  Helen Gould, who had used her ample means for the benefit of the sick  all through the war, and who now continued to play the good Samaritan.  President McKinley and many of his cabinet likewise visited the camp,  and saw to it that everything in the hospital and out of it was as it  should be. The sick were presented with the best of fruits and other  things, and many ladies assisted the nurses by reading to the patients  and by writing letters for them.    Now that they had nothing to do in the shape of fighting, many of the  Rough Riders were anxious to get back to the wild West. Life in an  ordinary camp did not suit them, and at every available opportunity they  indulged in \"horse play,\" working off many practical jokes upon each  other.    One day a report went the rounds that a member of another cavalry  organization could not master a certain horse that had been assigned to  him. The report was true, for the horse was what is called by ranchmen a  \"bad bucker.\"    \"I think Sergeant Darnell can master him,\" said Colonel Roosevelt.    He referred to"]]]
