The play being over, he craved more serious business. He  therefore set out to hunt up some of the British cruisers that were  trying to hunt him up.    In February, 1814, the _Essex_ and the _Essex Junior_, as one of the  newly manned prizes had been christened, entered Valparaiso, where they  learned that the 36-gun frigate _Phoebe_ was in the neighborhood  searching for them. Captain Porter gave a reception to the officials of  Valparaiso, and the next morning, while half of the crew were ashore,  the _Essex Junior_ signalled from the offing that two British frigates  were in sight. They came into port, the captain of the _Phoebe_  exchanging, compliments with Porter, they being old acquaintances; but,  all the same, each was distrustful of the other, and both maintained  what may be termed a position of armed neutrality.    For six weeks the two frigates blockaded Porter. Learning then that  other ships were expected, Porter determined to get to sea. In the  attempt, his vessel was completely disabled by a storm. Despite the  neutrality of the port, the two British frigates attacked him, keeping  beyond range of the _Essex's_ short guns and thus rendering her  perfectly powerless to help herself. The _Essex_ was pounded at long  range until 58 of her men were killed and 66 wounded, when, to save her  officers and crew from annihilation, she surrendered.          CHAPTER XVI.    Oliver Hazard Perry--Prompt and Effective Work--\"We Have Met the Enemy  and They Are Ours\"--Death of Perry.      Oliver Hazard Perry was born in Rhode Island in 1785, and entered the  American navy as midshipman when fourteen years old, under his father,  Captain Christopher Raymond Perry, who commanded the 28-gun ship  _General Greene_, which did good service in the war against France. The  son also served on the _Constellation_ in the Tripolitan war, and  afterward gave his attention to ordnance.    The surrender of Detroit by General William Hull at the opening of the  war gave the British control of the Territory of Michigan and Lake Erie.  They had formed the formidable plan of extending the Dominion of Canada  along the Ohio and Mississippi rivers to the Gulf of Mexico, thus  inserting an immense wedge between the United States and the great West,  which has since become so important a part of our country. The only way  of blocking this far-reaching and dangerous scheme was for the Americans  to regain control of Lake Erie, and to young Perry was assigned the  seemingly almost impossible task.    At the little town of Erie, Perry began the construction of his fleet,  and pushed it with such vigor, in the face of every sort of obstacle,  that early in July, 1813, he had ten vessels ready for sea, but only  enough men to man one of them. The end of the month made the total three  hundred, but he determined to get to sea on the first opportunity.  Outside was a powerful blockading squadron, and the water in the lake  was so low that it was not until the 4th of August that he was able to  get all his vessels over the bar. They comprised the _Scorpion_,  _Ariel_, _Lawrence_ (flagship), _Caledonia_, _Niagara_, _Somers_,  _Porcupine_, _Tigress_ and _Trippe_. The total guns carried were 54,  with a force of 490 men.    The British squadron consisted of six vessels, with an aggregate of 63  guns and 502 men. They were under the command of Commander Robert H.  Barclay, who had fought under Nelson at Trafalgar, and in another battle  lost an arm. It was less than three months before that the dying  Lawrence had uttered the appeal, \"Don't give up the ship!\" and Perry  hoisted a flag with the words displayed in large letters. As it floated  in the breeze from his vessel it was received with enthusiastic cheers.    It was on the 10th of September, 1814, that the two squadrons met at the  western end of Lake Erie. When a mile apart, the _Detroit_, the British  flagship, fired a shot to test the distance. It ricochetted past the  _Lawrence_. A few minutes later she fired a second shot, which smashed  into the starboard bulwarks of the _Lawrence_ and sent a cloud of  splinters flying. The reply to these was a 32-pounder from the  _Scorpion_. Then the firing became more rapid, the enemy possessing the  advantage at long range.    Most of the shots from the British vessels were directed against Perry's  flagship, which suffered considerably. He therefore made sail to get to  close quarters. His ship and the _Scorpion_ and _Ariel_ drew  considerably ahead of the rest of the fleet. As a consequence they  received the main fire of the enemy, which soon became concentrated on  the _Lawrence_, that was gallantly fighting against overwhelming odds.  Moreover, she was at a hopeless disadvantage with her short guns, and  soon became a wreck, with a large number of her men killed or wounded.    Gradually the boats drifted nearer and the Americans were able to make  use of their short guns and small arms. Perry's clothing was torn by  splinters and two musket balls passed through his hat. The battle  continued for more than two hours with the utmost desperation, during  which the scenes on the _Lawrence_ were too frightful to be described.  Finally the wrecked flagship began drifting helplessly out of action,  when Perry determined to transfer his flag to the _Niagara_.    [Illustration: COMMODORE PERRY AT THE BATTLE OF LAKE ERIE.]    With his broad pennant folded over his arm, and accompanied by a younger  brother and four seamen, he stepped into the small boat, which began  pulling in the direction of the _Niagara_. The thick smoke concealed  them for a time, but it soon lifted, and Barclay aimed a shot at the  boat. He said in his official report that he saw the shot strike the  boat, whereupon Perry took off his coat and plugged the hole with it.  But for the temporary veil the American commander could not have made  half the brief distance between the _Lawrence_ and the _Niagara_. As it  was, however, he reached the latter without a scratch. He hoisted his  pennant and the flag bearing the immortal words of the gallant Lawrence.  Then an officer was sent in a boat to communicate the orders of the  Commodore to the other vessels. This was hardly done when Perry saw with  the keenest distress the surrender of the _Lawrence_. Such submission  was inevitable, for almost every man on board was either killed or  wounded and every gun on the engaged side was disabled. The English  crews broke into cheers, believing the battle won, but they could not  take possession of the _Lawrence_, which drifted out of range.    Captain Barclay now made an attempt to change his line of battle with a  view of bringing his other broadsides into action. The line became  broken and entangled, observing which, Perry took instant advantage of  it. The _Niagara_, passing through the disorganized squadron, raked the  vessels fore and aft, while the other American vessels promptly  followed, and added to the confusion of the enemy and the dreadful  destruction on board. The Americans were now at close quarters and able  to do their best work, and so dreadful was it that fifteen minutes later  a white handkerchief was waved at the end of a boarding-pike on one of  the boats as a signal of surrender.    Firing ceased, and in the smoke and confusion two of the enemy's boats  darted away in an attempt to escape; but they were followed and brought  back. Determined to honor the _Lawrence_, Perry now had himself rowed to  the wreck, drifting some distance away in charge of the few that had  survived the awful conflict. Perry took his position aft and with calm  dignity received the surrender. As the defeated officers approached and  presented their swords in turn, he told each to retain the weapon,  accompanying the remark with words of compliment for the bravery he had  displayed.    The loss of the Americans was 27 killed and 96 wounded, and that of the  British 41 killed and 94 wounded. Perry showed every possible kindness  to the suffering prisoners, who expressed their gratitude. Commander  Barclay displayed conspicuous bravery throughout the battle and was  twice wounded, one of his injuries depriving him of the use of his  single remaining arm.    From what was stated at the beginning of this chapter, it will be seen  that this battle was one of the most important of the war. Not only was  it a glorious victory of itself, the occasion being the first time in  England's history that she surrendered a whole squadron, but it settled  a much more momentous matter. The British General Proctor was waiting  with his army on the Canadian shore ready to be carried across the lake  by the English fleet, in the event of their being successful, and  pressing his invasion of Ohio, which would have been an almost fatal  blow to our country.    On the Ohio shore General Harrison was waiting with an American force to  invade Canada, if Perry gained a victory. Hardly had the surrender been  made when the commandant, using his cap for a desk and the back of an  old letter for paper, pencilled the despatch which has become famous:  \"We have met the enemy and they are ours--two ships, two brigs, one  schooner and one sloop,\" which he sent by messenger to General Harrison.    [Illustration: THE BATTLE OF LAKE ERIE.]    In the following month Harrison invaded Canada, with Proctor retreating  before him, and accompanied by the famous Indian, Tecumseh, and several  hundred of his warriors. Proctor halted near the Moravian Towns, where a  battle was fought October 5, in which the British and Indians were  decisively defeated. The Indian confederacy was destroyed and all danger  of the invasion of Ohio ended.    Master-Commandant Perry's victory caused his promotion to the rank of  captain, and Congress awarded him a gold medal, besides suitably  rewarding his officers and men.

We say to  ourselves on revisiting a spot after a long interval: How many things  have happened since I last saw this! There is probably no impression  ever received by us of which we can venture to say that the vestiges are  altogether lost, or that we might not, under some circumstances, recover  it. A long-forgotten knowledge may be easily renewed and therefore is  very different from ignorance. Of the language learnt in childhood not  a word may be remembered, and yet, when a new beginning is made, the  old habit soon returns, the neglected organs come back into use, and the  river of speech finds out the dried-up channel.    e. 'Consciousness' is the most treacherous word which is employed in  the study of the mind, for it is used in many senses, and has rarely,  if ever, been minutely analyzed. Like memory, it accompanies all mental  operations, but not always continuously, and it exists in various  degrees. It may be imperceptible or hardly perceptible: it may be the  living sense that our thoughts, actions, sufferings, are our own. It  is a kind of attention which we pay to ourselves, and is intermittent  rather than continuous. Its sphere has been exaggerated. It is sometimes  said to assure us of our freedom; but this is an illusion: as there  may be a real freedom without consciousness of it, so there may be a  consciousness of freedom without the reality. It may be regarded as a  higher degree of knowledge when we not only know but know that we know.  Consciousness is opposed to habit, inattention, sleep, death. It may be  illustrated by its derivative conscience, which speaks to men, not only  of right and wrong in the abstract, but of right and wrong actions in  reference to themselves and their circumstances.    f. Association is another of the ever-present phenomena of the human  mind. We speak of the laws of association, but this is an expression  which is confusing, for the phenomenon itself is of the most capricious  and uncertain sort. It may be briefly described as follows. The simplest  case of association is that of sense. When we see or hear separately  one of two things, which we have previously seen or heard together, the  occurrence of the one has a tendency to suggest the other. So the sight  or name of a house may recall to our minds the memory of those who once  lived there. Like may recall like and everything its opposite. The parts  of a whole, the terms of a series, objects lying near, words having  a customary order stick together in the mind. A word may bring back a  passage of poetry or a whole system of philosophy; from one end of the  world or from one pole of knowledge we may travel to the other in an  indivisible instant. The long train of association by which we pass from  one point to the other, involving every sort of complex relation, so  sudden, so accidental, is one of the greatest wonders of mind...This  process however is not always continuous, but often intermittent: we can  think of things in isolation as well as in association; we do not mean  that they must all hang from one another. We can begin again after an  interval of rest or vacancy, as a new train of thought suddenly arises,  as, for example, when we wake of a morning or after violent exercise.  Time, place, the same colour or sound or smell or taste, will often  call up some thought or recollection either accidentally or naturally  associated with them. But it is equally noticeable that the new thought  may occur to us, we cannot tell how or why, by the spontaneous action of  the mind itself or by the latent influence of the body. Both science and  poetry are made up of associations or recollections, but we must observe  also that the mind is not wholly dependent on them, having also the  power of origination.    There are other processes of the mind which it is good for us to study  when we are at home and by ourselves,--the manner in which thought  passes into act, the conflict of passion and reason in many stages, the  transition from sensuality to love or sentiment and from earthly love to  heavenly, the slow and silent influence of habit, which little by little  changes the nature of men, the sudden change of the old nature of man  into a new one, wrought by shame or by some other overwhelming impulse.  These are the greater phenomena of mind, and he who has thought of  them for himself will live and move in a better-ordered world, and will  himself be a better-ordered man.    At the other end of the 'globus intellectualis,' nearest, not to earth  and sense, but to heaven and God, is the personality of man, by which  he holds communion with the unseen world. Somehow, he knows not how,  somewhere, he knows not where, under this higher aspect of his being he  grasps the ideas of God, freedom and immortality; he sees the forms of  truth, holiness and love, and is satisfied with them. No account of the  mind can be complete which does not admit the reality or the possibility  of another life. Whether regarded as an ideal or as a fact, the highest  part of man's nature and that in which it seems most nearly to approach  the divine, is a phenomenon which exists, and must therefore be included  within the domain of Psychology.    IV. We admit that there is no perfect or ideal Psychology. It is not a  whole in the same sense in which Chemistry, Physiology, or Mathematics  are wholes: that is to say, it is not a connected unity of knowledge.  Compared with the wealth of other sciences, it rests upon a small number  of facts; and when we go beyond these, we fall into conjectures and  verbal discussions. The facts themselves are disjointed; the causes of  them run up into other sciences, and we have no means of tracing  them from one to the other. Yet it may be true of this, as of other  beginnings of knowledge, that the attempt to put them together has  tested the truth of them, and given a stimulus to the enquiry into them.    Psychology should be natural, not technical. It should take the form  which is the most intelligible to the common understanding, because it  has to do with common things, which are familiar to us all. It should  aim at no more than every reflecting man knows or can easily verify for  himself. When simple and unpretentious, it is least obscured by words,  least liable to fall under the influence of Physiology or Metaphysic.  It should argue, not from exceptional, but from ordinary phenomena. It  should be careful to distinguish the higher and the lower elements of  human nature, and not allow one to be veiled in the disguise of the  other, lest through the slippery nature of language we should pass  imperceptibly from good to evil, from nature in the higher to nature in  the neutral or lower sense. It should assert consistently the unity of  the human faculties, the unity of knowledge, the unity of God and law.  The difference between the will and the affections and between the  reason and the passions should also be recognized by it.    Its sphere is supposed to be narrowed to the individual soul; but it  cannot be thus separated in fact. It goes back to the beginnings of  things, to the first growth of language and philosophy, and to the whole  science of man. There can be no truth or completeness in any study of  the mind which is confined to the individual. The nature of language,  though not the whole, is perhaps at present the most important element  in our knowledge of it. It is not impossible that some numerical laws  may be found to have a place in the relations of mind and matter, as in  the rest of nature. The old Pythagorean fancy that the soul 'is or has  in it harmony' may in some degree be realized. But the indications  of such numerical harmonies are faint; either the secret of them lies  deeper than we can discover, or nature may have rebelled against the use  of them in the composition of men and animals. It is with qualitative  rather than with quantitative differences that we are concerned  in Psychology. The facts relating to the mind which we obtain from  Physiology are negative rather than positive. They show us, not the  processes of mental action, but the conditions of which when deprived  the mind ceases to act. It would seem as if the time had not yet arrived  when we can hope to add anything of much importance to our knowledge  of the mind from the investigations of the microscope. The elements of  Psychology can still only be learnt from reflections on ourselves, which  interpret and are also interpreted by our experience of others. The  history of language, of philosophy, and religion, the great thoughts or  inventions or discoveries which move mankind, furnish the larger moulds  or outlines in which the human mind has been cast. From these the  individual derives so much as he is able to comprehend or has the  opportunity of learning.          THEAETETUS      PERSONS OF THE DIALOGUE: Socrates, Theodorus, Theaetetus.    Euclid and Terpsion meet in front of Euclid's house in Megara; they  enter the house, and the dialogue is read to them by a servant.      EUCLID: Have you only just arrived from the country, Terpsion?    TERPSION: No, I came some time ago: and I have been in the Agora looking  for you, and wondering that I could not find you.    EUCLID: But I was not in the city.    TERPSION: Where then?    EUCLID: As I was going down to the harbour, I met Theaetetus--he was  being carried up to Athens from the army at Corinth.    TERPSION: Was he alive or dead?    EUCLID: He was scarcely alive, for he has been badly wounded; but he was  suffering even more from the sickness which has broken out in the army.    TERPSION: The dysentery, you mean?    EUCLID: Yes.    TERPSION: Alas! what a loss he will be!    EUCLID: Yes, Terpsion, he is a noble fellow; only to-day I heard some  people highly praising his behaviour in this very battle.    TERPSION:"]]]
