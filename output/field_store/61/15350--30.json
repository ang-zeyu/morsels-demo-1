He is a man who sleeps with  a pistol under his pillow, and more than once, on running to the  window, he has had a vague glimpse of some creature leaping down from  the tiles of the roof, which slopes up to his room, into the flower  beds below....\"    \"Creature!\" said Smith, his grey eyes ablaze now, \"you said  _creature_!\"    \"I used the word deliberately,\" replied Weymouth, \"because Burke seems  to have the idea that it goes on all fours.\"    There was a short and rather strained silence. Then:    \"In descending a sloping roof,\" I suggested, \"a human being would  probably employ his hands as well as his feet.\"    \"Quite so,\" agreed the Inspector. \"I am merely reporting the  impression of Burke.\"    \"Has he heard no other sound?\" rapped Smith; \"one like the cracking of  dry branches, for instance?\"    \"He made no mention of it,\" replied Weymouth, staring.    \"And what is the plan?\"    \"One of his cousin's vans,\" said Weymouth, with his slight smile, \"has  remained behind at Covent Garden and will return late this afternoon.  I propose that you and I, Mr. Smith, imitate Burke and ride down to  Upminster under the empty boxes.\"    Nayland Smith stood up, leaving his breakfast half finished, and began  to wander up and down the room, reflectively tugging at his ear. Then  he began to fumble in the pockets of his dressing-gown and finally  produced the inevitable pipe, dilapidated pouch, and box of safety  matches. He began to load the much-charred agent of reflection.    \"Do I understand that Burke is actually too afraid to go out openly  even in daylight?\" he asked suddenly.    \"He has not hitherto left his cousin's plantations at all,\" replied  Weymouth. \"He seems to think that openly to communicate with the  authorities, or with you, would be to seal his death warrant.\"    \"He's right,\" snapped Smith.    \"Therefore he came and returned secretly,\" continued the inspector;  \"and if we are to do any good, obviously we must adopt similar  precautions. The market wagon, loaded in such a way as to leave ample  space in the interior for us, will be drawn up outside the office of  Messrs. Pike and Pike, in Covent Garden, until about five o'clock this  afternoon. At say, half-past four, I propose that we meet there and  embark upon the journey.\"    The speaker glanced in my direction interrogatively.    \"Include me in the programme,\" I said. \"Will there be room in the  wagon?\"    \"Certainly,\" was the reply; \"it is most commodious, but I cannot  guarantee its comfort.\"    Nayland Smith promenaded the room unceasingly, and presently he walked  out altogether, only to return ere the Inspector and I had had time to  exchange more than a glance of surprise, carrying a brass ash-tray. He  placed this on a corner of the breakfast table before Weymouth.    \"Ever seen anything like that?\" he inquired.    The Inspector examined the gruesome relic with obvious curiosity,  turning it over with the tip of his little finger and manifesting  considerable repugnance in touching it at all. Smith and I watched him  in silence, and, finally, placing the tray again upon the table, he  looked up in a puzzled way.    \"It's something like the skin of a water-rat,\" he said.    Nayland Smith stared at him fixedly.    \"A water-rat? Now that you come to mention it, I perceive a certain  resemblance--yes. But\"--he had been wearing a silk scarf about his  throat and now he unwrapped it--\"did you ever see a water-rat that  could make marks like these?\"    Weymouth started to his feet with some muttered exclamation.    \"What is this?\" he cried. \"When did it happen, and how?\"    In his own terse fashion, Nayland Smith related the happenings of the  night. At the conclusion of the story:    \"By heaven!\" whispered Weymouth, \"the thing on the roof--the coughing  thing that goes on all fours, seen by Burke....\"    \"My own idea exactly!\" cried Smith.    \"Fu-Manchu,\" I said excitedly, \"has brought some new, some dreadful  creature, from Burma....\"    \"No, Petrie,\" snapped Smith, turning upon me suddenly. \"Not from  Burma--from Abyssinia.\"           *       *       *       *       *    That day was destined to be an eventful one; a day never to be  forgotten by any of us concerned in those happenings which I have to  record. Early in the morning Nayland Smith set off for the British  Museum to pursue his mysterious investigations, and I, having  performed my brief professional round (for, as Nayland Smith had  remarked on one occasion, this was a beastly healthy district), I  found, having made the necessary arrangements, that, with over three  hours to spare, I had nothing to occupy my time until the appointment  in Covent Garden Market. My lonely lunch completed, a restless fit  seized me, and I felt unable to remain longer in the house. Inspired  by this restlessness, I attired myself for the adventure of the  evening, not neglecting to place a pistol in my pocket, and, walking  to the neighbouring Tube station, I booked to Charing Cross, and  presently found myself rambling aimlessly along the crowded streets.  Led on by what link of memory I know not, I presently drifted into New  Oxford Street, and looked up with a start--to learn that I stood  before the shop of a second-hand bookseller where once two years  before I had met Karamaneh.    The thoughts conjured up at that moment were almost too bitter to be  borne, and without so much as glancing at the books displayed for  sale, I crossed the roadway, entered Museum Street, and, rather in  order to distract my mind than because I contemplated any purchase,  began to examine the Oriental pottery, Egyptian statuettes, Indian  armour, and other curios, displayed in the window of an antique  dealer.    But, strive as I would to concentrate my mind upon the objects in the  window, my memories persistently haunted me, and haunted me to the  exclusion even of the actualities. The crowds thronging the pavement,  the traffic in New Oxford Street, swept past unheeded; my eyes saw  nothing of pot nor statuette, but only met, in a misty imaginative  world, the glance of two other eyes--the dark and beautiful eyes of  Karamaneh. In the exquisite tinting of a Chinese vase dimly  perceptible in the background of the shop, I perceived only the  blushing cheeks of Karamaneh; her face rose up, a taunting phantom,  from out of the darkness between a hideous, gilded idol and an Indian  sandal-wood screen.    I strove to dispel this obsessing thought, resolutely fixing my  attention upon a tall Etruscan vase in the corner of the window, near  to the shop door. Was I losing my senses indeed? A doubt of my own  sanity momentarily possessed me. For, struggle as I would to dispel  the illusion--there, looking out at me over that ancient piece of  pottery, was the bewitching face of the slave-girl!    Probably I was glaring madly, and possibly I attracted the notice of  the passers-by; but of this I cannot be certain, for all my attention  was centred upon that phantasmal face, with the cloudy hair, slightly  parted red lips, and the brilliant dark eyes which looked into mine  out of the shadows of the shop.    It was bewildering--it was uncanny; for, delusion or verity, the  glamour prevailed. I exerted a great mental effort, stepped to the  door, turned the handle, and entered the shop with as great a show of  composure as I could muster.    A curtain draped in a little door at the back of one counter swayed  slightly, with no greater violence than may have been occasioned by  the draught. But I fixed my eyes upon this swaying curtain almost  fiercely ... as an impassive half-caste of some kind who appeared to  be a strange cross between a Graeco-Hebrew and a Japanese, entered and  quite unemotionally faced me, with a slight bow.    So wholly unexpected was this apparition that I started back.    \"Can I show you anything, sir?\" inquired the new arrival, with a  second slight inclination of the head.    I looked at him for a moment in silence. Then:    \"I thought I saw a lady of my acquaintance here a moment ago,\" I said.  \"Was I mistaken?\"    \"Quite mistaken, sir,\" replied the shopman, raising his black eyebrows  ever so slightly; \"a mistake possibly due to a reflection in the  window. Will you take a look around now that you are here?\"    \"Thank you,\" I replied, staring him hard in the face; \"at some other  time.\"    I turned and quitted the shop abruptly. Either I was mad, or Karamaneh  was concealed somewhere therein.    However, realizing my helplessness in the matter, I contented myself  with making a mental note of the name which appeared above the  establishment--J. Salaman--and walked on, my mind in a chaotic  condition and my heart beating with unusual rapidity.          CHAPTER XVI    THE QUESTING HANDS      Within my view, from the corner of the room where I sat in deepest  shadow, through the partly opened window (it was screwed, like our  own) were rows of glass-houses gleaming in the moonlight, and, beyond  them, orderly ranks of flower-beds extending into a blue haze of  distance. By reason of the moon's position, no light entered the room,  but my eyes, from long watching, were grown familiar with the  darkness, and I could see Burke quite clearly as he lay in the bed  between my post and the window. I seemed to be back again in those  days of the troubled past when first Nayland Smith and I had come to  grips with the servants of Dr. Fu-Manchu. A more peaceful scene than  this flower-planted corner of Essex it would be"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19145"],[0,"The Time Traders (#20)"],[1,"with a Beaker's kilt. A familiar tilt of the head convinced Ross,  though he could not see the man's face. The quiet man went down the  hall, leaving Assha before a door. As he passed through it Ross sped  forward and followed him inside.    Assha had crossed the bare room and was standing on a glowing plate in  the floor. Ross, aroused to desperate action by some fear he did not  understand, leaped after him. His left hand fell upon Assha's shoulder,  turning the man half around as Ross, too, stepped upon the patch of  luminescence.    Murdock had only an instant to realize that he was staring into the face  of an astonished stranger. His hand flashed up in an edgewise blow which  caught the other on the side of the throat, and then the world came  apart about them. There was a churning, whirling sickness which griped  and bent Ross almost double across the crumpled body of his victim. He  held his head lest it be torn from his shoulders by the spinning thing  which seemed based behind his eyes.    The sickness endured only for a moment, and some buried part of Ross's  mind accepted it as a phenomenon he had experienced before. He came out  of it gasping, to focus his attention once more on the man at his feet.    The stranger was still breathing. Ross stooped to drag him from the  plate and began binding and gagging him with lengths torn from his kilt.  Only when his captive was secure did he begin looking about him  curiously.    The room was bare of any furnishings and now, as he glanced at the  floor, Ross saw that the plate had lost its glow. The Beaker trader  Rossa rubbed sweating palms on his kilt and thought fleetingly of forest  ghosts and other mysteries. Not that the traders bowed to those ghosts  which were the plague of lesser men and tribes, but anything which  suddenly appeared and then disappeared without any logical explanation,  needed thinking on. Murdock pulled the prisoner, who was now reviving,  to the far end of the room and then went back to the plate with the  persistence of a man who refused to treat with ghosts and wanted  something concrete to explain the unexplainable. Though he rubbed his  hands across the smooth surface of the plate, it did not light up  again.    His captive having writhed himself half out of the corner of the room,  Ross debated the wisdom of another silencing--say a tap on the skull  with the heavy hilt of his dagger. Deciding against it because he might  need a guide, he freed the victim's ankle bonds and pulled him to his  feet, holding the dagger ready where the man could see it. Were there  any more surprises to be encountered in this place, Assha's double would  test them first.    The door did not lead to the same corridor, or even the same kind of  corridor Ross had passed through moments earlier. Instead they entered a  short passage with walls of some smooth stuff which had almost the sheen  of polished metal and were sleek and cold to the touch. In fact, the  whole place was chill, chill as river water in the spring.    Still herding the prisoner before him, Ross came to the nearest door and  looked within, to be faced by incomprehensible frames of metal rods and  boxes. Rossa of the traders marveled and stared, but again, he realized  that what he saw was not altogether strange. Part of one wall was a  board on which small lights flashed and died, to flash again in winks of  bright color. A mysterious object made of wire and disks hung across the  back of a chair standing near-by.    The bound man lurched for the chair and fell, rolling toward the wall.  Ross pushed him on until he was hidden behind one of the metal boxes.  Then he made the rounds of the room, touching nothing, but studying what  he could not understand. Puffs of warm air came in through grills near  the floor, but the room had the same general chill as the hall outside.    Meanwhile the lights on the board had become more active, flashing on  and off in complex patterns. Ross now heard a buzzing, as if a swarm of  angry insects were gathered for an attack. Crouching beside his captive,  Ross watched the lights, trying to discover the source of the sound.    The buzz grew shriller, almost demanding. Ross heard the tramp of heavy  footgear in the corridor, and a man entered the room, crossing  purposefully to the chair. He sat down and drew the wire-and-disk frame  over his head. His hands moved under the lights, but Ross could not  guess what he was doing.    The captive at Murdock's side tried to stir, but Ross's hand pinned him  quiet. The shrill noise which had originally summoned the man at the  lights was interrupted by a sharp pattern of long-and-short sounds, and  his hands flew even more quickly while Ross took in every detail of the  other's clothing and equipment. He was neither a shaggy tribesman nor a  trader. He wore a dull-green outer garment cut in one piece to cover his  arms and legs as well as his body, and his hair was so short that his  round skull might have been shaven. Ross rubbed the back of his wrist  across his eyes, experiencing again that dim other memory. Odd as this  man looked, Murdock had seen his like before somewhere, yet the  background had not been Gurdi's post on the southern river. Where and  when had he, Rossa, ever been with such strange beings? And why could he  not remember it all more clearly?    Boots sounded once more in the hall, and another figure strode in. This  one wore furs, but he, too, was no woods hunter, Ross realized as he  studied the newcomer in detail. The loose overshirt of thick fur with  its hood thrown back, the high boots, and all the rest were not of any  primitive fashioning. And the man had four eyes! One pair were placed  normally on either side of his nose, and the other two, black-rimmed and  murky, were set above on his forehead.    The fur-clad man tapped the one seated at the board. He freed his head  partially from the wire cage so that they could talk together in a  strange language while lights continued to flash and the buzzing died  away. Ross's captive wriggled with renewed vigor and at last thrashed  free a foot to kick at one of the metal installations. The resulting  clang brought both men around. The one at the board tore his head cage  off as he jumped to his feet, while the other brought out a gun.    Gun? One little fraction of Ross's mind wondered at his recognition of  that black thing and of the danger it promised, even as he prepared for  battle. He pushed his captive across the path of the man in fur and  threw himself in the other direction. There was a blast to make a  torment in his head as he hurled toward the door.    So intent was Ross upon escape that he did not glance behind but skidded  out on his hands and knees, thus fortunately presenting a poor target to  the third man coming down the hall. Ross's shoulder hit the newcomer at  thigh level, and they tangled in a struggling mass which saved Ross's  life as the others burst out behind them.    Ross fought grimly, his hands and feet moving in blows he was not  conscious of planning. His opponent was no easy match and at last Ross  was flattened, in spite of his desperate efforts. He was whirled over,  his arms jerked behind him, and cold metal rings snapped about his  wrists. Then he was rolled back, to lie blinking up at his enemies.    All three men gathered over him, barking questions which he could not  understand. One of them disappeared and returned with Ross's former  captive, his mouth a straight line and a light in his eyes Ross  understood far better than words.    \"You are the trader prisoner?\" The man who looked like Assha leaned over  Murdock, patches of red on his tanned skin where the gag and wrist bonds  had been.    \"I am Rossa, son of Gurdi, of the traders,\" Ross returned, meeting what  he read in the other's expression with a ready defiance. \"I was a  prisoner, yes. But you did not keep me one for long then, nor shall you  now.\"    The man's thin upper lip lifted. \"You have done yourself ill, my young  friend. We have a better prison here for you, one from which you shall  not escape.\"    He spoke to the other men, and there was the ring of an order in his  voice. They pulled Ross to his feet, pushing him ahead of them. During  the short march Ross used his eyes, noticing things he could not  identify in the rooms through which they passed. Men called questions  and at last they paused long enough, Ross firmly in the hold of the  fur-clad guard, for the other two to put on similar garments.    Ross had lost his cloak in the fight, but no fur shirt was given him. He  shivered more and more as the chill which clung to that warren of rooms  and halls bit into his half-clad body. He was certain of only one thing  about this place; he could not possibly be in the crude buildings of the  valley village. However, he was unable to guess where he was and how he  had come there.    Finally, they went down a narrow room filled with bulky metal objects of  bright scarlet or violet that gleamed weirdly and were equipped with  rods along which all the colors of the rainbow ringed. Here was a round  door, and when one of the guards used both hands to tug it open, the  cold that swept in at them was a frigid breath that burned as it touched  bare skin.          CHAPTER 11      It took Ross a while to learn that the dirty-white walls of this tunnel  which were almost entirely opaque, with dark objects showing dimly  through them here and there, were of solid ice. A black wire was hooked  overhead and at regular intervals hung with lights which did nothing to  break the sensation of glacial cold about them.    Ross shuddered. Every breath he drew stung in his lungs; his bare  shoulders and arms and the exposed section of thigh between kilt and  boot were numb. He could only move on stiffly, pushed ahead by his  guards when he faltered. He guessed that were he to lose his footing  here and surrender to the cold, he would forfeit "]]]
