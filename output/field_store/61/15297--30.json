It cannot be dyed either  by English or German methods; neither logwood black nor coal-tar blacks  can make any really good impression on it. Cases have often been  described to me illustrating the difficulty in preventing hats which  have been dyed black with logwood, and which are at first a handsome  deep black, becoming rather too soon of a rusty or brownish shade. Now  my belief is that two causes may be found for this deterioration. One is  the unscientific method adopted in many works of using the same bath  practically for about a month together without complete renewal. During  this time a large quantity of a muddy precipitate accumulates, rich in  hydrated oxide of iron or basic iron salts of an insoluble kind. This  mud amounts to no less than 25 per cent. of the weight of the copperas  used. From time to time carbonate of ammonia is added to the bath, as it  is said to throw up \"dirt.\" The stuff or \"dirt,\" chiefly an ochre-like  mass stained black with the dye, and rich in iron and carbonate of iron,  is skimmed off, and fresh verdigris and copperas added with another lot  of hat-forms. No doubt on adding fresh copperas further precipitation of  iron will take place, and so this ochre-like precipitate will  accumulate, and will eventually come upon the hats like a kind of thin  black mud. Now the effect of this will be that the dyestuff, partly in  the fibre as a proper dye, and not a little on the fibre as if  \"smudged\" on or painted on, will, on exposure to the weather, moisture,  air, and so on, gradually oxidise, the great preponderance of iron on  the fibre changing to a kind of iron-rust, corroding the fibres in the  process, and thus at once accounting for the change to the ugly brownish  shade, and to the rubbing off and rapid wearing away of the already too  thin superficial coating of dyed felt fibre. In the final spells of  dyeing in the dye-beck already referred to, tolerably thick with black  precipitate or mud, the application of black to the hat-forms begins, I  fear, to assume at length a too close analogy to another blacking  process closely associated with a pair of brushes and the time-honoured  name of Day & Martin. With that logwood black fibre, anyone could argue  as to a considerable proportion of the dye rubbing, wearing, or washing  off. Thus, then, we have the second cause of the deterioration of the  black, for the colour could not go into the fibre, and so it was chiefly  laid or plastered on. You can also see that a logwood black hat dyer may  well make the boast, and with considerable appearance of truth, that for  the purposes of the English hat manufacturers, logwood black dyeing is  the most appropriate, _i.e._ for the dyeing of highly proofed and stiff  goods, but as to the permanent character of the black colour on those  stiff hats, there you have quite another question. I firmly believe that  in order to get the best results either with logwood black or \"aniline  blacks,\" it is absolutely necessary to have in possession a more  scientific and manageable process of proofing. Such a process is that  invented by F.W. Cheetham (see Lecture VII. p. 66).    In the dyeing of wool and felt with coal-tar colours, it is in many  cases sufficient to add the solution of the colouring matters to the  cold or tepid water of the dye-bath, and, after introducing the woollen  material, to raise the temperature of the bath. The bath is generally  heated to the boiling-point, and kept there for some time. A large  number of these coal-tar colours show a tendency of going so rapidly  and greedily on to the fibre that it is necessary to find means to  restrain them. This is done by adding a certain amount of Glauber's  salts (sulphate of soda), in the solution of which coal-tar colours are  not so soluble as in water alone, and so go more slowly, deliberately,  and thus evenly upon the fibre. It is usually also best to dye in a bath  slightly acid with sulphuric acid, or to add some bisulphate of soda.  There is another point that needs good heed taking to, namely, in using  different coal-tar colours to produce some mixed effect, or give some  special shade, the colours to be so mixed must possess compatibility  under like circumstances. For example, if you want a violet of a very  blue shade, and you take Methyl Violet and dissolve it in water and then  add Aniline Blue also in solution, you find that precipitation of the  colour takes place in flocks. A colouring matter which requires, as some  do, to be applied in an acid bath, ought not to be applied  simultaneously with one that dyes best in a neutral bath. Numerous  descriptions of methods of using coal-tar dyestuffs in hat-dyeing are  available in different volumes of the _Journal of the Society of  Chemical Industry_, and also tables for the detection of such dyestuffs  on the fibre.    Now I will mention a process for dyeing felt a deep dead black with a  coal-tar black dye which alone would not give a deep pure black, but one  with a bluish-purple shade. To neutralise this purple effect, a small  quantity of a yellow dyestuff and a trifle of indigotin are added. A  deep black is thus produced, faster to light than logwood black it is  stated, and one that goes on the fibre with the greatest ease. But I  have referred to the use of small quantities of differently coloured  dyes for the purpose of neutralising or destroying certain shades in the  predominating colour. Now I am conscious that this matter is one that is  wrapped in complete mystery, and far from the true ken of many of our  dyers; but the rational treatment of such questions possesses such vast  advantages, and pre-supposes a certain knowledge of the theory of  colour, of application and advantage so equally important, that I am  persuaded I should not close this course wisely without saying a few  words on that subject, namely, the optical properties of colours.    Colour is merely an impression produced upon the retina, and therefore  on the brain, by various surfaces or media when light falls upon them or  passes through them. Remove the light, and colour ceases to exist. The  colour of a substance does not depend so much on the chemical character  of that substance, but rather and more directly upon the physical  condition of the surface or medium upon which the light falls or through  which it passes. I can illustrate this easily. For example, there is a  bright-red paint known as Crooke's heat-indicating paint. If a piece of  iron coated with this paint be heated to about 150 deg. F., the paint at  once turns chocolate brown, but it is the same chemical substance, for  on cooling we get the colour back again, and this can be repeated any  number of times. Thus we see that it is the peculiar physical structure  of bodies which appear coloured that has a certain effect upon the  light, and hence it must be from the light itself that colour really  emanates. Originally all colour proceeds from the source of light,  though it seems to come to the eye from the apparently coloured objects.  But without some elucidation this statement would appear as an enigma,  since it might be urged that the light of the sun as well as that of  artificial light is white, and not coloured. I hope, however, to show  you that that light is white, because it is so much coloured, so  variously and evenly coloured, though I admit the term \"coloured\" here  is used in a special sense. White light contains and is made up of all  the differently coloured rainbow rays, which are continually vibrating,  and whose wave-lengths and number of vibrations distinguish them from  each other. We will take some white light from an electric lantern and  throw it on a screen. In a prism of glass we have a simple instrument  for unravelling those rays, and instead of letting them all fall on the  same spot and illumine it with a white light, it causes them to fall  side by side; in fact they all fall apart, and the prism has actually  analysed that light. We get now a coloured band, similar to that of the  rainbow, and this band is called the spectrum (see Fig. 16). If we could  now run all these coloured rays together again, we should simply  reproduce white light. We can do this by catching the coloured band in  another prism, when the light now emerging will be found to be white.  Every part of that spectrum consists of homogeneous light, _i.e._ light  that cannot be further split up. The way in which the white light is so  unravelled by the prism is this: As the light passes through the prism  its different component coloured rays are variously deflected from their  normal course, so that on emerging we have each of these coloured rays  travelling in its own direction, vibrating in its own plane. It is well  to remember that the bending off, or deflection, or refraction, is  towards the thick end of the prism always, and that those of the  coloured rays in that analysed band, the spectrum, most bent away from  the original line of direction of the white light striking the prism,  are said to be the most refrangible rays, and consequently are situated  in the most refrangible end or part of the spectrum, namely, that  farthest from the original direction of the incident white light. These  most refrangible rays are the violet, and we pass on to the least  refrangible end, the red, through bluish-violet, blue, bluish-green,  green, greenish-yellow, yellow, and orange. If you placed a prism say in  the red part of the spectrum, and caught some of those red rays and  allowed them to pass through your prism, and then either looked at the  emerging light or let it fall on a white surface, you would find only  red light would come through, only red rays. That light has been once  analysed, and it cannot be further broken up.

As they were then, the Indians' arrows and spears could  never have been brought to bear upon them, save in rare instances, for  they had thoroughly learned to dread man and fly from him for their  lives. Could those buffaloes have been protected from rifles and  revolvers the resultant race would have displayed far more active mental  powers, keener vision, and finer physique than the extinguished race  possessed.    In fleeing from an enemy the buffalo ran against the wind, in order that  his keen scent might save him from the disaster of running upon new  enemies; which was an idea wholly his own, and not copied by any other  animal so far as known.    But it must be admitted that the buffalo of the past was very often a  most stupid reasoner. He would deliberately walk into a quicksand,  where hundreds of his companions were already ingulfed and in their  death-struggle. He would quit feeding, run half a mile, and rush  headlong into a moving train of cars that happened to come between him  and the main herd on the other side of the track. He allowed himself to  be impounded and slaughtered by a howling mob in a rudely constructed  pen, which a combined effort on the part of three or four old bulls  would have utterly demolished at any point. A herd of a thousand  buffaloes would allow an armed hunter to gallop into their midst, very  often within arm's-length, when any of the bulls nearest him might  easily have bowled him over and had him trampled to death in a moment.  The hunter who would ride in that manner into a herd of the Cape  buffaloes of Africa (_Bubalus caffer_) would be unhorsed and killed  before he had gone half a furlong.    (2) _Curiosity._--The buffalo of the past possessed but little  curiosity; he was too dull to entertain many unnecessary thoughts. Had  he possessed more of this peculiar trait, which is the mark of an  inquiring mind, he would much sooner have accomplished a comprehension  of the dangers that proved his destruction. His stolid indifference to  everything he did not understand cost him his existence, although in  later years he displayed more interest in his environment. On one  occasion in hunting I staked my success with an old bull I was pursuing  on the chance that when he reached the crest of a ridge his curiosity  would prompt him to pause an instant to look at me. Up to that moment he  had had only one quick glance at me before he started to run. As he  climbed the slope ahead of me, in full view, I dismounted and made ready  to fire the instant he should pause to look at me. As I expected, he did  come to a fall stop on the crest of the ridge, and turned half around to  look at me. But for his curiosity I should have been obliged to fire at  him under very serious disadvantages.    (3) _Fear._--With the buffalo, fear of man is now the ruling passion.  Says Colonel Dodge: \"He is as timid about his flank and rear as a raw  recruit. When traveling nothing in front stops him, but an unusual  object in the rear will send him to the right-about [toward the main  body of the herd] at the top of his speed.\"    (4) _Courage._--It was very seldom that the buffalo evinced any courage  save that of despair, which even cowards possess. Unconscious of his  strength, his only thought was flight, and it was only when brought to  bay that he was ready to fight. Now and then, however, in the chase, the  buffalo turned upon his pursuer and overthrew horse and rider. Sometimes  the tables were completely turned, and the hunter found his only safety  in flight. During the buffalo slaughter the butchers sometimes had  narrow escapes from buffaloes supposed to be dead or mortally wounded,  and a story comes from the great northern range south of Glendive of a  hunter who was killed by an old bull whose tongue he had actually cut  out in the belief that he was dead.    Sometimes buffalo cows display genuine courage in remaining with their  calves in the presence of danger, although in most cases they left their  offspring to their fate. During a hunt for live buffalo calves,  undertaken by Mr. C. J. Jones of Garden City, Kans., in 1886, and very  graphically described by a staff correspondent of the American Field in  a series of articles in that journal under the title of \"The Last of the  Buffalo,\" the following remarkable incident occurred:[41]    [Note 41: American Field, July 24, 1886, p. 78.]    \"The last calf was caught by Carter, who roped it neatly as Mr. Jones  cut it out of the herd and turned it toward him. This was a fine heifer  calf, and was apparently the idol of her mother's heart, for the latter  came very near making a casualty the price of the capture. As soon as  the calf was roped, the old cow left the herd and charged on Carter  viciously, as he bent over his victim. Seeing the danger, Mr. Jones rode  in at just the nick of time, and drove the cow off for a moment; but she  returned again and again, and finally began charging him whenever he  came near; so that, much as he regretted it, he had to shoot her with  his revolver, which he did, killing her almost immediately.\"    The mothers of the thirteen other calves that were caught by Mr. Jones's  party allowed their offspring to be \"cut out,\" lassoed, and tied, while  they themselves devoted all their energies to leaving them as far behind  as possible.    (5) _Affection._--While the buffalo cows manifested a fair degree of  affection for their young, the adult bulls of the herd often displayed a  sense of responsibility for the safety of the calves that was admirable,  to say the least. Those who have had opportunities for watching large  herds tell us that whenever wolves approached and endeavored to reach a  calf the old bulls would immediately interpose and drive the enemy away.  It was a well-defined habit for the bulls to form the outer circle of  every small group or section of a great herd, with the calves in the  center, well guarded from the wolves, which regarded them as their most  choice prey.    Colonel Dodge records a remarkable incident in illustration of the  manner in which the bull buffaloes protected the calves of the herd.[42]    [Note 42: Plains of the Great West, p. 125.]    \"The duty of protecting the calves devolved almost entirely on the  bulls. I have seen evidences of this many times, but the most remarkable  instance I have ever heard of was related to me by an army surgeon, who  was an eye-witness.    \"He was one evening returning to camp after a day's hunt, when his  attention was attracted by the curious action of a little knot of six or  eight buffalo. Approaching sufficiently near to see clearly, he  discovered that this little knot were all bulls, standing in a close  circle, with their heads outwards, while in a concentric circle at some  12 or 15 paces distant sat, licking their chaps in impatient expectancy,  at least a dozen large gray wolves (excepting man, the most dangerous  enemy of the buffalo).    \"The doctor determined to watch the performance. After a few moments  the knot broke up, and, still keeping in a compact mass, started on a  trot for the main herd, some half a mile oft\". To his very great  astonishment, the doctor now saw that the central and controlling figure  of this mass was a poor little calf so newly born as scarcely to be able  to walk. After going 50 or 100 paces the calf laid down, the bulls  disposed themselves in a circle as before, and the wolves, who had  trotted along on each side of their retreating supper, sat down and  licked their chaps again; and though the doctor did not see the finale,  it being late and the camp distant, he had no doubt that the noble  fathers did their whole duty by their offspring, and carried it safely  to the herd.\"    (6) _Temper._--I have asked many old buffalo hunters for facts in regard  to the temper and disposition of herd buffaloes, and all agree that they  are exceedingly quiet, peace loving, and even indolent animals at all  times save during the rutting season. Says Colonel Dodge: \"The habits of  the buffalo are almost identical with those of the domestic cattle.  Owing either to a more pacific disposition, or to the greater number of  bulls, there, is very little fighting, even at the season when it might  be expected. I have been among them for days, have watched their conduct  for hours at a time, and with the very best opportunities for  observation, but have never seen a regular combat between bulls. They  frequently strike each other with their horns, but this seems to be a  mere expression of impatience at being crowded.\"    In referring to the \"running season\" of the buffalo, Mr. Catlin says:  \"It is no uncommon thing at this season, at these gatherings, to see  several thousands in a mass eddying and wheeling about under a cloud of  dust, which is raised by the bulls as they are pawing in the dirt, or  engaged in desperate combats, as they constantly are, plunging and  butting at each other in a most furious manner.\"    On the whole, the disposition of the buffalo is anything but vicious.  Both sexes yield with surprising readiness to the restraints of  captivity, and in a remarkably short time become, if taken young, as  fully domesticated as ordinary cattle. Buffalo calves are as easily  tamed as domestic ones, and make very interesting pets. A prominent  trait of character in the captive buffalo is a mulish obstinacy or  headstrong perseverance under certain circumstances that is often very  annoying. When a buffalo makes up his mind to go through a fence, he is  very apt to go through, either peaceably or by force,"]]]
