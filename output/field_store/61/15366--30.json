[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19289"],[0,"Some Answered Questions (#20)"],[1,"101)--that is to say, that whosoever shall partake  of this divine food will attain unto eternal life: that is, every one who  partakes of this bounty and receives these perfections will find eternal  life, will obtain preexistent favors, will be freed from the darkness of  error, and will be illuminated by the light of His guidance.    The form of the seed was sacrificed for the tree, but its perfections,  because of this sacrifice, became evident and apparent--the tree, the  branches, the leaves and the blossoms being concealed in the seed. When  the form of the seed was sacrificed, its perfections appeared in the  perfect form of leaves, blossoms and fruits.          30: ADAM AND EVE      Question.--What is the truth of the story of Adam, and His eating of the  fruit of the tree?    Answer.--In the Bible it is written that God put Adam in the garden of  Eden, to cultivate and take care of it, and said to Him: \"Eat of every  tree of the garden except the tree of good and evil, for if You eat of  that, You will die.\"(102) Then it is said that God caused Adam to sleep,  and He took one of His ribs and created woman in order that she might be  His companion. After that it is said the serpent induced the woman to eat  of the tree, saying: \"God has forbidden you to eat of the tree in order  that your eyes may not be opened, and that you may not know good from  evil.\"(103) Then Eve ate from the tree and gave unto Adam, Who also ate;  their eyes were opened, they found themselves naked, and they hid their  bodies with leaves. In consequence of this act they received the  reproaches of God. God said to Adam: \"Hast Thou eaten of the forbidden  tree?\" Adam answered: \"Eve tempted Me, and I did eat.\" God then reproved  Eve; Eve said: \"The serpent tempted me, and I did eat.\" For this the  serpent was cursed, and enmity was put between the serpent and Eve, and  between their descendants. And God said: \"The man is become like unto Us,  knowing good and evil, and perhaps He will eat of the tree of life and  live forever.\" So God guarded the tree of life.(104)    If we take this story in its apparent meaning, according to the  interpretation of the masses, it is indeed extraordinary. The intelligence  cannot accept it, affirm it, or imagine it; for such arrangements, such  details, such speeches and reproaches are far from being those of an  intelligent man, how much less of the Divinity--that Divinity Who has  organized this infinite universe in the most perfect form, and its  innumerable inhabitants with absolute system, strength and perfection.    We must reflect a little: if the literal meaning of this story were  attributed to a wise man, certainly all would logically deny that this  arrangement, this invention, could have emanated from an intelligent  being. Therefore, this story of Adam and Eve who ate from the tree, and  their expulsion from Paradise, must be thought of simply as a symbol. It  contains divine mysteries and universal meanings, and it is capable of  marvelous explanations. Only those who are initiated into mysteries, and  those who are near the Court of the All-Powerful, are aware of these  secrets. Hence these verses of the Bible have numerous meanings.    We will explain one of them, and we will say: Adam signifies the heavenly  spirit of Adam, and Eve His human soul. For in some passages in the Holy  Books where women are mentioned, they represent the soul of man. The tree  of good and evil signifies the human world; for the spiritual and divine  world is purely good and absolutely luminous, but in the human world light  and darkness, good and evil, exist as opposite conditions.    The meaning of the serpent is attachment to the human world. This  attachment of the spirit to the human world led the soul and spirit of  Adam from the world of freedom to the world of bondage and caused Him to  turn from the Kingdom of Unity to the human world. When the soul and  spirit of Adam entered the human world, He came out from the paradise of  freedom and fell into the world of bondage. From the height of purity and  absolute goodness, He entered into the world of good and evil.    The tree of life is the highest degree of the world of existence: the  position of the Word of God, and the supreme Manifestation. Therefore,  that position has been preserved; and, at the appearance of the most noble  supreme Manifestation, it became apparent and clear. For the position of  Adam, with regard to the appearance and manifestation of the divine  perfections, was in the embryonic condition; the position of Christ was  the condition of maturity and the age of reason; and the rising of the  Greatest Luminary(105) was the condition of the perfection of the essence  and of the qualities. This is why in the supreme Paradise the tree of life  is the expression for the center of absolutely pure sanctity--that is to  say, of the divine supreme Manifestation. From the days of Adam until the  days of Christ, They spoke little of eternal life and the heavenly  universal perfections. This tree of life was the position of the Reality  of Christ; through His manifestation it was planted and adorned with  everlasting fruits.    Now consider how far this meaning conforms to the reality. For the spirit  and the soul of Adam, when they were attached to the human world, passed  from the world of freedom into the world of bondage, and His descendants  continued in bondage. This attachment of the soul and spirit to the human  world, which is sin, was inherited by the descendants of Adam, and is the  serpent which is always in the midst of, and at enmity with, the spirits  and the descendants of Adam. That enmity continues and endures. For  attachment to the world has become the cause of the bondage of spirits,  and this bondage is identical with sin, which has been transmitted from  Adam to His posterity. It is because of this attachment that men have been  deprived of essential spirituality and exalted position.    When the sanctified breezes of Christ and the holy light of the Greatest  Luminary(106) were spread abroad, the human realities--that is to say,  those who turned toward the Word of God and received the profusion of His  bounties--were saved from this attachment and sin, obtained everlasting  life, were delivered from the chains of bondage, and attained to the world  of liberty. They were freed from the vices of the human world, and were  blessed by the virtues of the Kingdom. This is the meaning of the words of  Christ, \"I gave My blood for the life of the world\"(107)--that is to say, I  have chosen all these troubles, these sufferings, calamities, and even the  greatest martyrdom, to attain this object, the remission of sins (that is,  the detachment of spirits from the human world, and their attraction to  the divine world) in order that souls may arise who will be the very  essence of the guidance of mankind, and the manifestations of the  perfections of the Supreme Kingdom.    Observe that if, according to the suppositions of the People of the  Book,(108) the meaning were taken in its exoteric sense, it would be  absolute injustice and complete predestination. If Adam sinned by going  near the forbidden tree, what was the sin of the glorious Abraham, and  what was the error of Moses the Interlocutor? What was the crime of Noah  the Prophet? What was the transgression of Joseph the Truthful? What was  the iniquity of the Prophets of God, and what was the trespass of John the  Chaste? Would the justice of God have allowed these enlightened  Manifestations, on account of the sin of Adam, to find torment in hell  until Christ came and by the sacrifice of Himself saved them from  excruciating tortures? Such an idea is beyond every law and rule and  cannot be accepted by any intelligent person.    No; it means what has already been said: Adam is the spirit of Adam, and  Eve is His soul; the tree is the human world, and the serpent is that  attachment to this world which constitutes sin, and which has infected the  descendants of Adam. Christ by His holy breezes saved men from this  attachment and freed them from this sin. The sin in Adam is relative to  His position. Although from this attachment there proceed results,  nevertheless, attachment to the earthly world, in relation to attachment  to the spiritual world, is considered as a sin. The good deeds of the  righteous are the sins of the Near Ones. This is established. So bodily  power is not only defective in relation to spiritual power; it is weakness  in comparison. In the same way, physical life, in comparison with eternal  life in the Kingdom, is considered as death. So Christ called the physical  life death, and said: \"Let the dead bury their dead.\"(109) Though those  souls possessed physical life, yet in His eyes that life was death.    This is one of the meanings of the biblical story of Adam. Reflect until  you discover the others.    Salutations be upon you.          31: EXPLANATION OF BLASPHEMY AGAINST THE HOLY SPIRIT      Question.--\"Wherefore I say unto you, All manner of sin and blasphemy shall  be forgiven unto men: but the blasphemy against the Holy Ghost shall not  be forgiven unto men. And whosoever speaketh a word against the Son of  man, it shall be forgiven him: but whosoever speaketh against the Holy  Ghost, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, neither in the  world to come.\"--(Matt. 12:31-32)    Answer.--The holy realities of the Manifestations of God have two spiritual  positions. One is the place of manifestation, which can be compared to the  position of the globe of the sun, and the other is the resplendency of the  manifestation, which is like its light and radiance; these are the  perfections of God--in other words, the Holy Spirit. For the Holy Spirit is  the divine bounties and lordly perfections, and these divine perfections  are as the rays and heat of the sun. The brilliant rays of the sun  constitute its being, and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19298"],[0,"The World Order of Bahá'u'lláh (#20)"],[1," to yield one jot or one tittle of their  cherished convictions. His insinuations and clamor they have consistently  ignored. The motives which animated his actions, the methods he steadily  pursued, the precarious privileges he seemed momentarily to enjoy they  could not but despise. Thriving for a time through the devices which their  scheming minds had conceived and supported by the ephemeral advantages  which fame, ability or fortune can confer these notorious exponents of  corruption and heresy have succeeded in protruding for a time their ugly  features only to sink, as rapidly as they had risen, into the mire of an  ignominious end.    From the midst of these afflictive trials, reminiscent in some of their  aspects of the violent storm that had accompanied the birth of the Faith  in their native land, the American believers had again triumphantly  emerged, their course undeflected, their fame unsullied, their heritage  unimpaired. A series of magnificent accomplishments, each more significant  than the previous, were to shed increasing lustre on an already  illustrious record. In the dark years immediately following 'Abdu'l-Baha's  ascension their deeds shone with a radiance that made them the object of  the envy and the admiration of the less privileged among their brethren.  The entire community, untrammeled and supremely confident, was rising to a  great and glorious opportunity. The forces that had motivated its birth,  that had assisted in its rise, were now accelerating its growth, in a  manner and with such rapidity that neither the pangs of a world-wide  sorrow nor the unceasing convulsions of a distracted age could paralyze  its efforts or retard its march.    Internally the community had embarked in a number of enterprises that were  to enable it on the one hand to extend still further the scope of its  spiritual jurisdiction and on the other to fashion the essential  instruments for the creation and consolidation of the institutions which  such an extension imperatively demanded. Externally its undertakings were  inspired by the twofold objective of prosecuting, even more intensely than  before, the admirable work which in each of the five continents its  international teachers had initiated, and of assuming an increasing share  in the handling and solution of the delicate and complex problems with  which a newly-emancipated Faith was being confronted. The birth of the  Administration in that continent had signalized these praiseworthy  exertions. Its gradual consolidation was destined to insure their  continuance and to accentuate their effectiveness.    To enumerate only the most outstanding accomplishments which, in their own  country and beyond its confines, have so greatly enhanced the prestige of  the American believers and have redounded to the glory and honor of the  Most Great Name is all I can presently undertake, leaving to future  generations the task of explaining their import and of affixing a fitting  estimate to their value. To the body of their elected representatives must  be attributed the honor of having been the first among their sister  Assemblies of East and West to devise, promulgate and legalize the  essential instruments for the effective discharge of their collective  duties--instruments which every properly constituted Baha'i community must  regard as a pattern worthy to be adopted and copied. To their efforts must  likewise be ascribed the historic achievement of establishing their  national endowments upon a permanent and unassailable basis and of  creating the necessary agency for the formation of those subsidiary organs  whose function is to administer on behalf of their trustees such  possessions as these may acquire beyond the limits of their immediate  jurisdiction. By the weight of their moral support so freely extended to  their Egyptian brethren they were able to remove some of the most  formidable obstacles which the Faith had to surmount in its struggle to  enfranchise itself from the fetters of Muslim orthodoxy. Through the  effective and timely intervention of these same elected representatives  they were able to avert the woes and dangers which had menaced their  persecuted fellow-workers in the Soviet Republics, and to ward off the  rage which had threatened with immediate ruin one of the most precious and  noblest of Baha'i institutions. Nothing short of the whole-hearted  assistance, whether moral or financial which the American believers,  individually and collectively, were moved to extend on several occasions  to the needy and harassed among their brethren in Persia could have saved  these hapless victims of the consequences of the calamities that had  visited them in the years following 'Abdu'l-Baha's ascension. It was the  publicity which the efforts of their American brethren had created, the  protests they were led to make, the appeals and petitions they had  submitted, which mitigated these sufferings and curbed the violence of the  worst and most tyrannical opponents of the Faith in that land. Who else,  if not one of their most distinguished representatives, has risen to force  upon the attention of the highest Tribunal the world has yet seen the  grievances which a Faith, robbed of one of its holiest sanctuaries, had  suffered at the hand of the usurper? Who else has succeeded in securing,  through patient and persistent effort, those written affirmations which  proclaim the justice of a persecuted cause and tacitly recognize its right  to an independent religious status? \"The Commission,\" is the resolution  passed by the Permanent Mandates Commission of the League of Nations,  \"recommends that the Council should ask the British Government to make  representations to the Iraqi Government with a view to the immediate  redress of the denial of justice from which the petitioners (the Baha'i  Spiritual Assembly of Ba_gh_dad) have suffered.\" Has any one else except  an American believer been led to obtain from royalty such remarkable and  repeated testimonies to the regenerating power of the Faith of God, such  striking references to the universality of its teachings and the sublimity  of its mission. \"The Baha'i teaching,\" such is the Queen's written  testimony, \"brings peace and understanding. It is like a wide embrace  gathering together all those who have long searched for words of hope. It  accepts all great Prophets gone before, it destroys no other creeds and  leaves all doors open. Saddened by the continual strife amongst believers  of many confessions and wearied of their intolerance towards each other, I  discovered in the Baha'i teaching the real spirit of Christ so often  denied and misunderstood: Unity instead of strife, Hope instead of  condemnation, Love instead of hate, and a great reassurance for all men.\"  Have not the American adherents of the Faith of Baha'u'llah, through the  courage displayed by one of the most brilliant members of their community,  been instrumental in paving the way for the removal of those barriers  which have, for well-nigh a century, hampered the growth and crippled the  energy of their fellow-believers in Persia? Is it not America who, ever  mindful of 'Abdu'l-Baha's passionate entreaty, has sent out to the ends of  the earth a steadily increasing number of its most consecrated  citizens--men and women the one wish of whose lives is to consolidate the  foundations of Baha'u'llah's world-embracing dominion? In the northernmost  capitals of Europe, in most of its central states, throughout the Balkan  Peninsula, along the shores of the African, the Asiatic and South American  continents are to be found this day a small band of women pioneers who,  single-handed and with scanty resources, are toiling for the advent of the  Day 'Abdu'l-Baha has foretold. Did not the attitude of the Greatest Holy  Leaf, as she approached the close of her life, bear eloquent testimony to  the incomparable share which her steadfast and self-sacrificing lovers in  that continent have had in lightening the burden which had weighed so long  and so heavily on her heart? And finally who can be so bold as to deny  that the completion of the superstructure of the Ma_sh_riqu'l-A_dh_kar--the  crowning glory of America's past and present achievements--has forged that  mystic chain which is to link, more firmly than ever, the hearts of its  champion-builders with Him Who is the Source and Center of their Faith and  the Object of their truest adoration?    Fellow-believers in the American continent! Great indeed have been your  past and present achievements! Immeasurably greater are the wonders which  the future has in store for you! The Edifice your sacrifices have raised  still remains to be clothed. The House which must needs be supported by  the highest administrative institution your hands have reared, is as yet  unbuilt. The provisions of the chief Repository of those laws that must  govern its operation are thus far mostly undisclosed. The Standard which,  if 'Abdu'l-Baha's wishes are to be fulfilled, must be raised in your own  country has yet to be unfurled. The Unity of which that standard is to be  the symbol is far from being yet established. The machinery which must  needs incarnate and preserve that unity is not even created. Will it be  America, will it be one of the countries of Europe, who will arise to  assume the leadership essential to the shaping of the destinies of this  troubled age? Will America allow any of her sister communities in East or  West to achieve such ascendancy as shall deprive her of that spiritual  primacy with which she has been invested and which she has thus far so  nobly retained? Will she not rather contribute, by a still further  revelation of those inherent powers that motivate her life, to enhance the  priceless heritage which the love and wisdom of a departed Master have  conferred upon her?    Her past has been a testimony to the inexhaustible vitality of her faith.  May not"]]]
