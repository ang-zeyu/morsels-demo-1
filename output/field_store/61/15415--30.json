Well, what are you going to do if anyone  catches you prowling round at that time? Have you considered  that?\"    \"No.\"    \"You would have to say something, wouldn't you? You wouldn't chat  about the weather, would you? You wouldn't discuss the latest  play? You would have to think up some mighty good reason for  being out of bed at that time, wouldn't you?\"    \"I suppose so.\"    \"Oh, you do admit that, do you? Well, what you would say is this:  You would explain that I had rung for you to come and read me to  sleep. Do you understand?\"    \"You think that would be a satisfactory explanation of my being  in the museum?\"    \"Idiot! I don't mean that you're to say it if you're caught  actually in the museum. If you're caught in the museum the best  thing you can do is to say nothing, and hope that the judge will  let you off light because it's your first offense. You're to say  it if you're found wandering about on your way there.\"    \"It sounds thin to me.\"    \"Does it? Well, let me tell you that it isn't so thin as you  suppose, for it's what you will actually have to do most nights.  Two nights out of three I have to be read to sleep. My  indigestion gives me insomnia.\" As though to push this fact home,  Mr. Peters suddenly bent double. \"Oof!\" he said. \"Wow!\" He  removed the cigar from his mouth and inserted a digestive  tabloid. \"The lining of my stomach is all wrong,\" he added.    It is curious how trivial are the immediate causes that produce  revolutions. If Mr. Peters had worded his complaint differently  Ashe would in all probability have borne it without active  protest. He had been growing more and more annoyed with this  little person who buzzed and barked and bit at him, yet the idea  of definite revolt had not occurred to him. But his sufferings at  the hands of Beach, the butler, had reduced him to a state where  he could endure no further mention of stomachic linings. There  comes a time when our capacity for listening to detailed data  about the linings of other people's stomachs is exhausted.    He looked at Mr. Peters sternly. He had ceased to be intimidated  by the fiery little man and regarded him simply as a  hypochondriac, who needed to be told a few useful facts.    \"How do you expect not to have indigestion? You take no exercise  and you smoke all day long.\"    The novel sensation of being criticized--and by a beardless youth  at that--held Mr. Peters silent. He started convulsively, but he  did not speak. Ashe, on his pet subject, became eloquent. In his  opinion dyspeptics cumbered the earth. To his mind they had the  choice between health and sickness, and they deliberately chose  the latter.    \"Your sort of man makes me angry. I know your type inside out.  You overwork and shirk exercise, and let your temper run away  with you, and smoke strong cigars on an empty stomach; and when  you get indigestion as a natural result you look on yourself as a  martyr, nourish a perpetual grouch, and make the lives of  everybody you meet miserable. If you would put yourself into my  hands for a month I would have you eating bricks and thriving on  them. Up in the morning, Larsen Exercises, cold bath, a brisk  rubdown, sharp walk--\"    \"Who the devil asked your opinion, you impertinent young hound?\"  inquired Mr. Peters.    \"Don't interrupt--confound you!\" shouted Ashe. \"Now you have made  me forget what I was going to say.\"    There was a tense silence. Then Mr. Peters began to speak:    \"You--infernal--impudent--\"    \"Don't talk to me like that!\"    \"I'll talk to you just--\"    Ashe took a step toward the door. \"Very well, then,\" he said.  \"I'll quit! I'm through! You can get somebody else to do this job  of yours for you.\"    The sudden sagging of Mr. Peters' jaw, the look of consternation  that flashed on his face, told Ashe he had found the right  weapon--that the game was in his hands. He continued with a  feeling of confidence:    \"If I had known what being your valet involved I wouldn't have  undertaken the thing for a hundred thousand dollars. Just because  you had some idiotic prejudice against letting me come down here  as your secretary, which would have been the simple and obvious  thing, I find myself in a position where at any moment I may be  publicly rebuked by the butler and have the head stillroom maid  looking at me as though I were something the cat had brought in.\"    His voice trembled with self-pity.    \"Do you realize a fraction of the awful things you have let me in  for? How on earth am I to remember whether I go in before the  chef or after the third footman? I shan't have a peaceful minute  while I'm in this place. I've got to sit and listen by the hour  to a bore of a butler who seems to be a sort of walking hospital.  I've got to steer my way through a complicated system of  etiquette.    \"And on top of all that you have the nerve, the insolence, to  imagine that you can use me as a punching bag to work your bad  temper off! You have the immortal rind to suppose that I will  stand for being nagged and bullied by you whenever your suicidal  way of living brings on an attack of indigestion! You have the  supreme gall to fancy that you can talk as you please to me!    \"Very well! I've had enough of it. I resign! If you want this  scarab of yours recovered let somebody else do it. I've retired  from business.\"    He took another step toward the door. A shaking hand clutched at  his sleeve.    \"My boy--my dear boy--be reasonable!\"    Ashe was intoxicated with his own oratory. The sensation of  bullyragging a genuine millionaire was new and exhilarating. He  expanded his chest and spread his feet like a colossus.    \"That's all very well,\" he said, coldly disentangling himself  from the hand. \"You can't get out of it like that. We have got to  come to an understanding. The point is that if I am to be  subjected to your--your senile malevolence every time you have a  twinge of indigestion, no amount of money could pay me to stop  on.\"    \"My dear boy, it shall not occur again. I was hasty.\"    Mr. Peters, with agitated fingers, relit the stump of his cigar.    \"Throw away that cigar!\"    \"My boy!\"    \"Throw it away! You say you were hasty. Of course you were hasty;  and as long as you abuse your digestion you will go on being  hasty. I want something better than apologies. If I am to stop  here we must get to the root of things. You must put yourself in  my hands as though I were your doctor. No more cigars. Every  morning regular exercises.\"    \"No, no!\"    \"Very well!\"    \"No; stop! Stop! What sort of exercises?\"    \"I'll show you to-morrow morning. Brisk walks.\"    \"I hate walking.\"    \"Cold baths.\"    \"No, no!\"    \"Very well!\"    \"No; stop! A cold bath would kill me at my age.\"    \"It would put new life into you. Do you consent to the cold  baths? No? Very well!\"    \"Yes, yes, yes!\"    \"You promise?\"    \"Yes, yes!\"    \"All right, then.\"    The distant sound of the dinner gong floated in.    \"We settled that just in time,\" said Ashe.    Mr. Peters regarded him fixedly.    \"Young man,\" he said slowly, \"if, after all this, you fail to  recover my Cheops for me I'll--I'll--By George, I'll skin you!\"    \"Don't talk like that,\" said Ashe. \"That's another thing you have  got to remember. If my treatment is to be successful you must not  let yourself think in that way. You must exercise self-control  mentally. You must think beautiful thoughts.\"    \"The idea of skinning you is a beautiful thought!\" said Mr.  Peters wistfully.                            *   *   *    In order that their gayety might not be diminished--and the food  turned to ashes in their mouths by the absence from the festive  board of Mr. Beach, it was the custom for the upper servants at  Blandings to postpone the start of their evening meal until  dinner was nearly over above-stairs. This enabled the butler to  take his place at the head of the table without fear of  interruption, except for the few moments when coffee was being  served.    Every night shortly before half-past eight--at which hour Mr.  Beach felt that he might safely withdraw from the dining-room and  leave Lord Emsworth and his guests to the care of Merridew, the  under-butler, and James and Alfred, the footmen, returning only  for a few minutes to lend tone and distinction to the  distribution of cigars and liqueurs--those whose rank entitled  them to do so made their way to the housekeeper's room, to pass  in desultory conversation the interval before Mr. Beach should  arrive, and a kitchen maid, with the appearance of one who has  been straining at the leash and has at last managed to get free,  opened the door, with the announcement: \"Mr. Beach, if you please,  dinner is served.\" On which Mr. Beach, extending a crooked elbow  toward the housekeeper, would say, \"Mrs. Twemlow!\" and lead the  way, high and disposedly, down the passage, followed in order of  rank by the rest of the company, in couples, to the steward's  room.    For Blandings was not one of those houses--or shall we say  hovels?--where the upper servants are expected not only to feed  but to congregate before feeding in the steward's room. Under the  auspices of Mr. Beach and of Mrs. Twemlow, who saw eye to eye  with him in these matters, things were done properly at the  castle, with the correct solemnity. To Mr. Beach and Mrs. Twemlow  the suggestion that they and their peers should gather together  in the same room in which they were to dine would have been as  repellent as an announcement from Lady Ann Warblington, the  chatelaine, that the house party would eat in the drawing-room.    When Ashe, returning from his interview with Mr. Peters, was  intercepted by a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20426"],[0,"Form and Function: A Contribution to the History of Animal Morphology (#20)"],[1,"the insect's thorax. He used Geoffroy's _Loi de balancement_ to explain  cases of correlative development, such as the relation between the size  of the front wings and the development of the mesothorax. In another  paper Audouin compared the three pieces of the dorsal skeleton of  Trilobites to the tergum and the upper part of the \"flanc.\"[138] In a  third paper of about the same time he tried to establish the homologies  of the segments throughout the Articulate series--with less success than  Savigny.    Later on, in conjunction with Milne-Edwards, he demonstrated the unity  of composition of the nervous system in Crustacea, showing how the  concentrated system of the crab was formed by the same series of ganglia  as in the Macrura.    The entomologist Latreille also tackled the problem of the homologies of  the segments in the different classes of Arthropods (Cuvier, _loc.  cit._, p. cclxxii.). He thought he could find fifteen segments in all  Arthropods. He made the retrograde step of likening the head of insects  to a single segment. But some of his homologies showed morphological  insight, _e.g._, his comparison of the \"first jaws\" of Arachnids to  antennae, because they were placed above the upper lip. It was he who  first pointed out the resemblance of the leaf-like gills of Ephemerid  larvae to wings, and suggested that wings were \"a sort of tracheal feet.\"    He made also a rather hazy and speculative contribution on Okenian lines  to the problem of the relation of Arthropods to Vertebrates, likening  the carapace of Crustacea to an enormously developed hyoid, the  appendages of the tail to the ventral and anal fins of fish. The  masticatory organs of Arthropods were jaws disjointed at their  symphysis; antennae, nostrils turned outside in.    Duges also made a comparison of Articulates with Vertebrates.[139] He did  not accept Geoffroy's vertebral theory of the Arthropod skeleton, though  he admitted that in Arthropods the dorsal surface was turned towards the  ground, basing this assumption on the position of the nervous system,  and also, curiously enough, on the inverted position of the embryo on  the lower surface of the yolk. He considered that the mandibles and  first maxillae of Arthropods were the homologues of the upper and lower  jaws of Vertebrates, adducing as confirmatory evidence the fact that in  snakes the rami are separate. The labium was the equivalent of the  hyoid, the labial palps and maxillipedes the equivalent of the \"hyoid\"  elements which form the branchial arches.    But Duges' main contribution to morphological method was his conception  of the living organism as a colony of lesser units, which were  themselves real \"organisms.\" \"By _organism_ the author means a complex  of organs which taken together suffice to constitute, ideally or  actually, a complete animal. An 'organism' is, as it were, an elementary  or simple animal; several organisms combined form a complex animal\" (p.  255). Duges hit upon this principle, which was first suggested to him by  A. Moquin-Tandon's work on the leech (1827), as a great aid in  demonstrating the unity of plan and composition throughout the animal  kingdom.[140] According to his view there are three main types of  animals--(1) Biserials, including bilaterally symmetrical animals,  composed of two parallel series of \"organisms\"; (2) Radiates, composed  of \"organisms\" arranged like the spokes of a wheel; and (3)  Raceme-animals, in which the separate \"organisms\" were disposed more or  less irregularly, in bunches (p. 257). The unitary \"organism\" is  supposed to be the same in all, only the arrangement differing. Duges of  course admitted that the centralisation of the complete organism became  greater the higher it stood in the scale, and that this held good also  in individual development. The appendages of Articulates and Vertebrates  were thought of as the members of as many separate organisms. He went so  far as to suggest that the fingers of a man's hand were the free  extremities of as many thoracic members.    Duges' conception of the organism has often been revived since in a  saner form, _e.g._, by E. Perrier, and it has a certain validity. It has  much affinity with the similar conceptions of Goethe and the German  transcendentalists.        [130] _Mem. Acad. Sci._, iv., pp. cclxxxiv.-ccci., 1824.        [131] _Ann. Sci.

CHAPTER VII    THE GERMAN TRANSCENDENTALISTS      To complete our historical survey of the morphology of the early 19th  century we have now to turn back some way and consider the curious  development of morphological thought in Germany under the influence of  the _Philosophy of Nature_. We have already seen many of these notions  foreshadowed by Goethe, who had considerable affinity with the  transcendentalists, but the full development of transcendental habits of  thought comes a little later than the bulk of Goethe's scientific work,  and owes more to Kielmeyer and Oken than to Goethe himself.    A great wave of transcendentalism seems to have passed over biological  thought in the early 19th century, arising mainly in Germany, but  powerfully affecting, as we have seen, the thought of Geoffroy and his  followers. Many ideas were common to the French and German schools of  transcendental anatomy, the fundamental conception that there exists a  unique plan of structure, the idea of the scale of beings, the notion of  the parallelism between the development of the individual and the  evolution of the race. It is difficult to disentangle the part played by  each school and to determine which should have the credit for particular  theories and discoveries. The philosophy seems to have come chiefly from  Germany, the science from France. It must be borne in mind that German  comparative anatomy was largely derivative from French, that the Paris  Museum was the acknowledged anatomical centre, and that Cuvier was its  acknowledged head.    It is probably correct to say that the credit mainly belongs to the  German transcendental school for the law of the parallelism between the  stages of individual development and the stages of the scale of beings,  and the theory of the repetition or multiplication of parts within the  individual. The vertebral theory of the skull is a particular  application of the second of these generalisations.    The law of parallelism[141] seems to have been expressed first by  Kielmeyer (1793),[142] who gave to it a physiological form, saying that  the human embryo shows at first a purely vegetative life, then becomes  like the lower animals, which move but have no sensation, and finally  reaches the level of the animals that both feel and move.    The idea was next taught by Autenrieth in 1797.[143]    Oken (1779-1851) in his early tract _Die Zeugung_ (1805), and in his  _Lehrbuch der Naturphilosophie_ (1809-11) elaborated the thought, and  taught that every animal in its development passes through the classes  immediately below it. \"During its development the animal passes through  all stages of the animal kingdom. The foetus is a representation of all  animal classes in time.\"[144] The Insect, for example, is at first Worm,  next Crab, then a perfect volant animal with limbs, a Fly (_ibid._, p.  542).    As Nature is \"the representation of the individual activities of the  spirit,\" so the animal kingdom is the representation of the activities  or organs of man. The animal kingdom is therefore \"a dismemberment of  the highest animal, _i.e._, of Man\" (p. 494). Now \"animals are gradually  perfected, entirely like the single animal body, by adding organ unto  organ\"--the way of evolution is the way of development. Hence \"animals  are only the persistent foetal stages or conditions of Man,\" who is the  microcosm, and contains within himself all the animal kingdom.    Oken was himself a careful student of embryology; von Baer[145] speaks of  his work (published in Oken and Kieser, _Beitraege zur vergleichenden  Zoologie, Anatomie und Physiologie_, 2 pts., 1806-7) as forming the  turning-point in our understanding of the mammalian ovum. He had  accordingly actually observed a resemblance in certain details of  structure between the human foetus and the lower animals; but the  peculiar form which the law took in his hands was a consequence of his  hazy philosophy. He saw the relation of teratological to foetal  structure, for he affirmed that \"malformations are only persistent  foetal conditions\" (p. 492).    The idea of comparing the embryo of higher animals with the adult of  lower was widely spread at this time among German zoologists. We find,  for example, in Tiedemann's brilliant little textbook[146] the statement  that \"Every animal, before reaching its full development, passes through  the stage of organisation of one or more classes lower in the scale, or,  every animal begins its metamorphosis with the simplest organisation\"  (p. 57).    Thus the higher animals begin life as a kind of fluid animal jelly which  resembles the substance of a polyp; the young mammal, like the lower  Vertebrates, has only a simple circulation, and, like them, lives in  water (the amniotic fluid); the frog is first like a worm, then develops  gills and becomes like a fish (p. 57).
