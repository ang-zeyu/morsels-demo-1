Still keeping silence, the elves led Giles through hundreds of splendid  rooms and great halls, all lighted by hanging lamps as countless in  number as the leaves upon the trees. Suddenly, a great archway rose  before them, through which appeared a hall larger and brighter than all  the others seen before. At one end of it, under a canopy of rosy-gray,  stood a golden throne, and on the throne sat a being dressed in radiant  blue--in blue such as the sky wears after a rain, when the dark clouds  with bright edges break asunder and reveal the glory overhead. At the  same moment, the countless mountain elves gathered in the hall began to  sing:--      \"All Hail, All Hail to the Shepherd of Clouds,      Who, high in his mountain-top, rules o'er the' weather;    He sends the rich rain over mountain and plain,     And sprinkles the dew-drops afar o'er the heather.\"    The elves led Giles before the Shepherd.    \"How comest thou, mortal, to invade my mountain?\" said the Shepherd.    \"I went forth to seek Phyllida,\" said Giles, \"and lost my way in the  storm.\"    \"What sayest thou, Eye-o?\" said the Shepherd to the elf with the single  great eye in his forehead.    \"The mortal speaks the truth,\" answered Eye-o in the queerest,  squealiest voice. \"I saw him set out yesterday from his cottage on the  plain. He had not gone far when the storm which Your Mightiness prepared  in the morning and sent forth in the afternoon overtook him. He lost his  way, and chance led him to your dwelling, O Shepherd of Clouds.\"    \"What sayest thou, Ear-o?\" said the Shepherd to the elf with the great  ears.    \"I heard him say good-bye to his wife Wednesday last,\" replied the elf  in a voice exactly like that of his brother. \"Phyllida said to him, 'You  will find a fresh baking of bread and a meat-pie in the larder.'\"    The Shepherd of Clouds fixed his deep, solemn gaze upon Giles and said:--    \"Mortal, I have hearkened to your story and to the words of my faithful  Eye-o, who sees all things that happen in the whole wide world; I have  paid heed to the words of Ear-o, who hears all things that are to be  heard under the sun. Chance has led you to discover the secret of the  weather. Nevermore must you revisit the lower world. Here shall you stay  till Death overtakes you. Obey me, and I will give you happiness and  honor; seek to escape, and my lightnings will find you wheresoever you  may hide.\"    \"Oh, no! no! no!\" cried poor Giles, throwing himself down before the  throne. \"Great Shepherd of Clouds, do not keep me here. Let me return to  my cottage on the plain, to Phyllida who waits for me, and knows not  whither I am gone or whether I am living or dead. Oh, let me go, let me  go!\"    But the Shepherd only shook his head austerely, and rising from his  throne, disappeared behind the rose-gray curtains. Again the mountain  elves sang, and as they sang, the great hall slowly grew darker than the  darkest night, and cold gusts of wind arose wailing in the darkness.  Presently Giles felt his body grow weak, strong hands seized him and  bore him up, and an instant later a deep sleep blotted out the world.    When he awoke, he found himself in a little room. Dawn was at hand, and  the sweet, cold mountain air was blowing through the eastern window.  Suddenly, the door swung open, and Eye-o and Ear-o entered.    \"The sun is rising, Giles,\" said Ear-o, \"and your appointed task awaits  you. The Shepherd wishes the clouds released at once. Hurry, hurry,  hurry, Giles, and open their prison-door.\"    So Giles went forth with the elves. Over the summit of the mountain they  ran, along a path which wandered here and there--now dodging between  huge boulders, now skirting terrible precipices. Presently Giles saw a  monstrous wall of rock rising before him, in which were fixed two brazen  doors taller and more stately than he had ever seen in the world below.  Beside these doors, a flight of steps began, which led to the top of the  wall.    Curious to see what lay behind the wall and the closed doors, Giles  hurried to the top. He found himself standing at the brink of a great  bowl, many miles wide and many miles long, hollowed out of the very rock  of the mountaintop. Within this bowl, like a giant flock of sheep, lay  hundreds of clouds on whose misty tops the rising sun poured gold, pale  lavender, and rose. At first, Giles thought them motionless, but as he  gazed intently within the bowl, he saw that the clouds moved and swayed  much like anchored ships in a tide.    This bowl was the weather-bowl. In it the Shepherd of Clouds prepared  the weather for the neighboring countries. One day he would keep the  fair-weather clouds at home and let the rain-clouds sail over the land;  on another day, he would keep all the clouds in and let the sun shine;  on other days he would mix together such frosts, mists, and  snow-flurries as the season required.    Suddenly, ringing infinitely sweet over the mountain-top, rose the clear  music of a silver horn.    \"It is the Shepherd!\" cried Eye-o and Ear-o.    \"The hour is at hand to send the clouds over the earth. Quick, Giles,  unbar the doors!\"    So Giles unbound the giant doors, which of their own volition opened  wide. A sound as of thunder heard from far away over the sea beat upon  Giles's ear as the portals turned upon their hinges. In answer to this  sound, the clouds rose and lifted their golden heads, and hastening to  the brazen doors, one by one escaped through them to the sunlit spaces  of the morning sky. There, they formed themselves into a fleet, and  sailed majestically away.    Thus Giles became the servant of the Shepherd of Clouds. It was his task  to unbar the door when the Shepherd had prepared the weather; it was his  to lock the clouds in, once they had returned from the heavens in answer  to the Shepherd's summoning horn. In time he came to know the  rain-clouds from their fair-weather brothers; he learned how frosts were  sent forth; how fogs were made; and he was even allowed to prepare a  small storm. He saw the icy caverns in which the hail-stones lie piled  in monstrous bags, the lightning-bolts in their crystal jars, and even  the prisoned storm-winds. You may be sure that, when he could so arrange  it, Phyllida's garden had quite the finest variety of weather. For Eye-o  and Ear-o would tell him about her.    \"Tell me, what is Phyllida doing?\" Giles would say again and again.    And Eye-o would answer, \"She is out in the garden gathering plums\"; or,  \"she is in the kitchen making gingerbread.\"    And then Giles would say to Ear-o, \"Tell me, what is Phyllida saying?\"    And Ear-o would answer, \"'Oh, would that my lad were home!'\"    Two years passed, and Giles, who had found no opportunity of escape,  began to lose hope of doing so. Never again, he feared, would he see  Phyllida. One day, with Eye-o and Ear-o by his side, he sat on a great  boulder and gazed gloomily down on the plain. Spring was just ripening  into early summer, the plain was at its very greenest and loveliest, and  here and there a little blue wood-smoke hung over the tiny villages.  Giles thought of Phyllida far, far away, and a terrible loneliness  poured into his heart. Eye-o and Ear-o sitting beside him, their long,  strange arms clasped about their knees, looked on with sympathy.  Presently Ear-o's right ear turned itself about, and after a moment's  silence, the elf said:--    \"I hear voices telling of war. I hear the Robber King of the Black Lakes  summoning his terrible army. He is preparing a secret attack on the  people of the plain.\"    \"I see him! I see him!\" cried Eye-o. \"He is talking to the Grand  Chamberlain Scelerato.\"    \"Listen,\" said Ear-o; \"he is saying, 'We will sweep the land at dawn,  steal the grain, and destroy every village to its foundation.'\"    \"I see the robbers gathering,\" said Eye-o. \"They are hiding in the dark  pine forests, lest they be seen by the people of the plain. The sunlight  pierces here and there through the thick branches and shines on the  breastplates of the armed men.\"    At this terrible news, Giles was stricken to the heart with anxiety and  fear. What was to become of Phyllida and the people of the plain? If he  could only hurry down the mountain and warn them! If he could only  escape! And he looked round eagerly, as he had looked a thousand times  before, for any avenue of escape; but his gaze met only the great  precipices of the mountain and the guarded stairs.    What could he do? His heart became like ice, and he feared to gaze upon  the plain lest he see the smoke of burning villages. All night long he  never closed his eyes. At dawn he rose and hurried to the top of the  gate which overlooked the cloud-bowl. For two whole weeks, not a cloud  had been allowed to roam the sky, and it seemed to Giles that the mists  were angry, and that a darkness brooded upon them. Turning toward the  plain, Giles saw, at the edge of the land, a little glow of fire. The  robbers had invaded the plain!    Presently Eye-o came clambering up the steps.    \"I see a village in flames,\" said the elf. \"The inhabitants are fleeing  down the roads. The news is spreading, and the people of the plain are  hurrying to seek refuge in the mountains.\"    \"Oh, where is Phyllida?\" cried Giles.    \"She is on the highway with Jack and Jill and their children, hastening  toward the Valley of Thunder,\" answered the elf.    Suddenly Giles stood up, and throwing his arms high over his head,  uttered a loud shout. \"I can save them,\" he cried. \"Let us send a storm  against the robbers. Hurry, let us prepare the worst tempest that ever  was seen.\"    And away he ran to the hail-stone caverns, and carrying bag after bag to  the brim, emptied them all into the weather-bowl; he then tossed in a  dozen skinsful of the fiercest storm-winds, and ended "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19209"],[0,"The Andes and the Amazon; Or, Across the Continent of South America (#20)"],[1,"kiss the  feet of the Andes, and the showers that swell the Amazon fall within  sight of the mariner on that peaceful ocean, the Rocky Mountains are  situated five hundred miles from the sea. The space west of the Andes  does not contain 20,000 square leagues, while the country east of it  equals 424,600. While the compact Andes have an average width of only  sixty miles,[56] the straggling mountain system beyond the Mississippi  has the breadth of the Empire State; but the mean elevation of the  latter would scarcely reach the bottom of the Quito Valley. The  mountains of Asia may surpass the Cordilleras in height, but, situated  beyond the tropics, and destitute of volcanoes, they do not present that  inexhaustible variety of phenomena which characterizes the latter. The  outbursts of porphyry and trachytic domes, so characteristic of the high  crests of the Cordilleras, impart a physiognomy quite distinct from that  presented by the mountains of Europe. The Andes offer, in the least  space, the greatest possible variety of impressions.[57] There is near  Huanca, Peru, a coal-bed lifted up to the enormous height of 14,700  feet, and on the side of Chimborazo there is a salt spring 13,000 feet  above the sea. Marine shells have not been found in Europe above the  summit of the Pyrenees, or 11,700 feet; but the Andes can show some a  thousand feet higher. A strange sight, to see shells once crawling on  the bottom of the ocean now resting at an elevation twice the height of  Mount Washington!    [Footnote 56: The width of the chain south of the equator varies with  that of the continent.]    [Footnote 57: \"No mountains which I have seen in Hungary, Saxony, or the  Pyrenees are as irregular as the Andes, or broken into such alternate  substances, manifesting such prodigious revolutions of nature.\"--_Helms_.  \"More sublime than the Alps by their _ensemble_, the Andes lack those  curious and charming details of which Nature has been so lavish in the  old continent.\"--_Holinski_.]    Beneath the Southern Cross, out of a sea perpetually swept by fearful  gales, rise the rocky hills of Terra del Fuego. It is the starting-point  of that granite chain which winds around the earth in a majestic curve,  first northwesterly to the Arctic Sea, thence by the Aleutian and  Japanese Isles to Asia, crossing the Old World southwesterly from China  to South Africa.    Skirting the bleak shores of Patagonia in a single narrow sierra, the  Andes enter Chile, rising higher and higher till they culminate in the  gigantic porphyritic peak of Aconcagua. At the boundary-line of Bolivia,  the chain, which has so far followed a precise meridional direction,  turns to the northwest, and, at the same time, separates into two  Cordilleras, inclosing the great table-land of Desaguadero. This  wonderful valley, the Thibet of the New World, has four times the area  of New York State, and five times the elevation of the Catskill Mountain  House. At one end of the valley, perched above the clouds, is silvery  Potosi, the highest city in the world; at the other stands the once  golden capital of Cuzco. Between them is Lake Titicaca[58] (probably an  ancient crater), within which is an island celebrated as the cradle of  the strange empire of Peru, which, though crushed by Pizarro in its  budding civilization, ranks as the most extraordinary and extensive  empire in the annals of American history. The Cordillera, of which  Sahama, Sorata, and Illimani are the pinnacles, so completely inclose  this high valley that not a drop of water can escape except by  evaporation. At the silver mines of Pasco the Andes throw off a third  cordillera, and with this triple arrangement and a lower altitude, enter  the republic of Ecuador. There they resume the double line, and surpass  their former magnificence. Twenty volcanoes, presided over by the  princely Chimborazo and Cotopaxi, rise out of a sublime congregation of  mountains surrounding the famous valley of Quito. In New Granada there  is a final and unique display of Andine grandeur: the Cordilleras  combine just above the equator into one dizzy ridge, and then spread out  like a fan, or, rather, like the graceful branches of the palm. One  sierra bends to the east, holding in its lap the city of Bogota, and,  rolling off a thousand streams to swell the Orinoco, terminates in the  beautiful mountains of Caracas; the central range culminates in the  volcanic Tolima,[59] but is soon lost in the Caribbean Sea; the western  chain turns to the left, humbling itself as it threads the narrow  isthmus, and expands into the level table-land of Mexico. You may cross  Mexico from ocean to ocean in a carriage, but no wheeled vehicle ever  crossed South America.    [Footnote 58: This lake is the largest fresh-water accumulation in South  America. It has diminished within the historic period. Its surface is  12,795 feet above the Pacific, or higher than the highest peaks of the  Pyrenees.]    [Footnote 59: This is the loftiest summit of the Andes in the northern  hemisphere, being 18,200 feet. It is also remarkable for being situated  farther from the sea (120 miles) than any other active volcano.]    [Illustration: Profiles of Ecuadorian Volcanoes    10,000 ft. Chimborazo.    10,000 ft. Cotopaxi.    10,000 ft. Caraguairazo.    10,000 ft. Pichincha.    ]    We will now speak more particularly of the Andes of the equator. The  mountain chain is built up of granite, gneissoid, and schistose rocks,  often in vertical position, and capped with trachyte and porphyry.[60]  Large masses of _solid_ rock are rarely seen; every thing is cracked,  calcined, or triturated. While in Bolivia the Eastern Cordillera shows a  succession of sharp, ragged peaks, in contrast with the conical summits  of the Cordillera of the coast, there is no such distinction in the  Andes of the equator.[61] The Eastern Cordillera has a greater mean  height, and it displays more volcanic activity. Twenty volcanic  mountains surround the valley, of which twelve are in the oriental  chain. Three of the twenty are now active (Cotopaxi, Sangai, and  Pichincha), and five others are known to have erupted since the Conquest  (Chiles, Imbabura, Guamani, Tunguragua, and Quirotoa). The truncated  cone of Cotopaxi, the jagged, Alpine crest of ruined Altar, and the dome  of Chimborazo, are the representative forms of the volcanic summits. The  extinct volcanoes usually have double domes or peaks, while the active  peaks are slender cones. Antisana and Cayambi are fashioned after  Chimborazo, though the latter is table-topped rather than convex;  Caraguairazo, Quirotoa, Iliniza, Sincholagua, Ruminagui, and Corazon,  resemble Altar; Tunguragua, Sangai, Llanganati, Cotocachi, Chiles, and  Imbabura, imitate Cotopaxi; Pichincha, Atacatzo, and Guamani are  irregular. The Ecuadorian volcanoes have rarely ejected liquid lava, but  chiefly water, mud, ashes, and fragments of trachyte and porphyry.  Cotopaxi alone produces pure, foam-like pumice, and glossy,  translucent obsidian.[62] The paucity of quartz, and the absence of  basalt, are remarkable. Some of the porphyroids are conglomerate, but  the majority are true porphyries, having a homogeneous base. Dr. T.  Sterry Hunt calls them porphyroid trachytes. They have a black, rarely  reddish, vitreous, or impalpable base, approaching obsidian, with a  specific gravity of 2.59 in pure specimens, and holding crystals or  crystalline grains of glassy feldspar, and sometimes of pyroxene and  hematite. They differ from the Old World porphyries in containing no  quartz, and seldom mica.[63] D'Orbigny considers the porphyries of the  Andes to have been ejected at the close of the cretaceous period, and  formed the first relief of the Cordillera. The prevalence of trachyte  shows that the products have cooled under feeble pressure.    [Footnote 60: \"As a general rule, whenever the mass of mountains rises  much above the limit of perpetual snow, the primitive rocks disappear,  and the summits are trachyte or trappean porphyry.\"--_Humboldt_. In  general, \"the great Cordilleras are formed of innumerable varieties of  granites, gneiss, schists, hornblende, chloritic slates, porphyries,  etc., and these rocks alternate with each other in meridional bands,  which in the ridges frequently present the appearance of a radiated or  fan-shaped structure, and under the plains are more or less  vertical.\"--_Evan Hopkins, F.G.S_.]    [Footnote 61: Von Tschudi makes the incorrect statement that \"throughout  the whole extent of South America there is not a single instance of the  Western Cordillera being intersected by a river.\" Witness the  Esmeraldas.]    [Footnote 62: It is a singular fact that true trachyte, pumice, and  obsidian are wanting in the volcanic Galapagos Islands, only 700 miles  west of Pichincha.]    [Footnote 63: As many of the crystals are partly fused, or have round  angles, the porphyries were probably formed by the melting of a  crystalline rock, the base becoming fused into a homogeneous material,  while the less fusible crystals remain imbedded.--_Dr. Hunt_.]    From the deluges of water lately thrown out have resulted deep furrows  in the sides; and from the prevalence of the east wind, which is always  met by the traveler on the crest of either Cordillera, there is a  greater accumulation of ashes, and less snow on the west slope. Cotopaxi  is a fine example of this. In Pichincha, Altar, and Ruminagua, however,  the western wall is lowest, apparently broken down.[64] There is no  synchronism in the eruptions of Cotopaxi and Pichincha. These volcanoes  must have independent reservoirs, for the former is 3000 feet higher  than the latter, and only thirty miles distant. The reputed eruptions of  Pichincha are dated 1534, 1539, 1566, 1575, 1588, and 1660; that of 1534  resting on the assertions of Checa, Garcilazo, and Herrera, indorsed by  Humboldt. Excepting the traditional eruption in 1534, which probably is "]]]
