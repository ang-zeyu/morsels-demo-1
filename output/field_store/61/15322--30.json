Of course in any  extremity she'll support us. I'll pin up a notice in the junior  cloak-room and see what effect that has. It may settle them.\"    Lispeth stayed after four o'clock until the last coat and hat had  disappeared from the hooks in the juniors' dressing-room. Then she  pinned her ultimatum on their notice board:    \"In consequence of the extremely bad behavior of certain girls on the  stairs this afternoon, the prefects give notice that should any  repetition of such conduct occur, the names of the offenders will be  taken and they will be reported to Miss Burd for punishment.\"    \"That ought to finish those kids!\" she thought as she pushed in the  drawing-pins.    There was more than the usual amount of buzzing conversation next  morning as juvenile heads bumped each other in their efforts to read the  notice. The result, however, was absolutely unprecedented in the annals  of the school. It was the custom of the Sixth Form, and of many of the  Fifth, to take their lunch and eat it quietly in the gymnasium. There  was no hard and fast rule about this, but it was generally understood to  be a privilege of the upper forms only, and intermediates and juniors  were not supposed to intrude. To-day most of the elder girls were  sitting in clumps at the far end of the gymnasium, when through the open  door marched a most amazing procession of juniors. They were headed by  Phyllis Smith and Dorrie Barnes carrying between them a small blackboard  upon which was chalked:          DOWN WITH PREFECTS!         RIGHTS FOR JUNIORS!      THE WHOLE SCHOOL IS EQUAL!    After these ringleaders marched a determined crowd waving flags made of  handkerchiefs fastened to the end of rulers. A band, equipped with combs  covered with tissue-paper torn from their drawing-books, played the  strains of the \"Marseillaise.\" They advanced towards the seniors in a  very truculent fashion.    \"Well, really!\" exclaimed Lispeth, recovering from her momentary  amazement. \"What's the meaning of all this, I'd like to know?\"    \"It's a strike!\" said Dorrie proudly, as she and Phyllis paused so as to  display the blackboard before the eyes of the Sixth. \"We don't see why  you big girls should lord it over us any longer. We'll obey the  mistresses, but we'll not obey prefects.\"    \"You'll just jolly well do as you're told, you impudent young monkeys!\"  declared Lispeth, losing her temper. \"Here, clear out of this gymnasium  at once!\"    \"We shan't! We've as good a right here as you!\"    \"We ought to send wardens to the School Parliament.\"    \"We haven't any voice in school affairs!\"    \"It's not fair!\"    \"We shan't stand it any longer!\"    The shrill voices of the insurgents reached crescendo as they hurled  forth their defiance. They were evidently bent on red-hot revolution.  Lispeth rose to read the Riot Act.    \"If you don't take yourselves off I shall go for Miss Burd, and  a nice row you'd get into then. I give you while I count ten.  One--two--three--four----\"    Whether the strikers would have stood their ground or not is still an  unsolved problem, but at that opportune moment the big school bell began  to clang, and Miss Willough, the drill mistress, in her blue tunic,  entered the gymnasium ready to take her next class. At sight of her,  Dorrie hastily wiped the blackboard, and the juniors fled to their own  form-rooms, suppressing flags and musical instruments on the way. Miss  Willough gazed at them meditatively, but made no comment, and the Sixth,  hurrying to a literature lesson, had no time to offer explanations.    Lispeth, more upset than she cared to own, talked the matter over with  her mother when she went to dinner at one o'clock. She was a very  conscientious girl and anxious to do her duty as \"Head.\" As a result of  the home conference she went to Miss Burd, explained the situation, and  asked to be allowed to have the whole school together for ten minutes  before four o'clock.    \"It's only lately there's been this trouble,\" she said. \"I believe if I  talk nicely to the girls I can get back my influence. That's what Mother  advised. She said 'try persuasion first.'\"    \"She's right, too,\" agreed Miss Burd. \"If you can get them to obey you  willingly it's far better than if I have to step in and put my foot  down. What we want is to change the general current of thought.\"    Speculation was rife in the various forms as the closing bell rang at  3:45 instead of at 4 o'clock, and the girls were told to assemble in the  Lecture Hall, and were put on their honor to behave themselves. To their  surprise, the mistresses, after seeing them seated, left the room. Miss  Burd mounted the platform and announced:    \"Lispeth Scott wishes to speak to you all, and I should like you to know  that anything she has to say is said with my entire approval and  sanction. I hope you will listen to her in perfect silence.\"    Then she followed the other mistresses.    All eyes were fixed on Lispeth as she ascended the platform. With her  tall ample figure, earnest blue eyes, light hair, and fair face flushed  with the excitement of her task she looked a typical English girl, and  made what she hoped was a typical English speech.    \"I asked you to come,\" she began rather shyly, \"because I think lately  there have been some misunderstandings in the school, and I want, if  possible, to put them straight. There has been a good deal of talk about  'equality,' and some of you say there oughtn't to be prefects. I wonder  exactly what you mean by 'equality?' Certainly all girls aren't born  with equal talents, yet each separate soul is of value to the community  and must not go to waste. The test of a school is not how many show  pupils it has turned out, but how _all_ its pupils are prepared to face  the world. I think we can only do this by sticking together and trying  to help each other. In every community, however, there must be leaders.  An army would soon go to pieces without its officers! The prefects and  wardens have been chosen as leaders, and it ought to be a point of honor  with you to uphold their authority. I assure you they don't work for  their own good, but for the good of the school. I hear it is a grievance  with the juniors that they mayn't elect wardens for the Council.  Well--they shall do that when they're older; it will be something for  them to look forward to! There's a privilege, though, that we can and  will give them. We're going to start a Junior branch of the Rainbow  League, and I think when they're doing their level best to help others,  they'll forget about themselves. Carlyle says that the very dullest  drudge has the elements of a hero in him if he once sees the chance of  aiming at something higher than happiness. Please don't say I'm  preaching, for I hate to be a prig! Only we'd all made up our minds to  do our 'bit' in 'after the war work,' and it seems such a pity if we  forget, and let the tone of the school drop--as it certainly _has_  dropped lately. I'm sure if we all think about it we can keep it up, and  Seniors and Juniors can work together without any horrid squabbles. We  big girls were juniors ourselves once, and you little ones will be  seniors some day, so that's one way of looking at it. Now that's all  I've got to say, except that any Juniors who like can stay behind now  and join the Junior Branch of the Rainbow League. We want to get up a  special Scrap-book Union, and Miss Burd says she'll give a prize for the  best scrap-book, and also for the best home-made doll. She's going to  have an exhibition on breaking-up day.\"          CHAPTER XII    The Rainbow League      Though Lispeth, in her agitation, had not said half the nice things she  had intended to say, her little speech had good effect. It reminded the  girls of some of the high ideals with which they had started the term,  and which, like many high and beautiful things, were in danger of  getting crowded out of the way by commoner interests. Everybody suddenly  remembered the exhibition and sale which was to come off before  Christmas, and made a spurt to send some adequate contribution. The  juniors, flattered at having a special branch of their own of the  Rainbow League, and time allotted in school to its work, dabbed away  blissfully at scrap-book making, with gummy overalls and seccotiny  fingers, but complacent faces. The prefects, with intent, dropped in  when possible to admire the efforts.    \"I believe,\" said Lispeth to her special confidante Althea, \"that  perhaps we were making rather a mistake. You can't have any influence  with those kids unless you keep well in touch with them. I was so busy,  I just let them slide before, and I suppose that was partly why they got  out of hand, though the little monkeys had no business to get up that  impudent strike! They're as different as possible now, and some of them  are quite decent kiddies. Dorrie Barnes brought me a rose this morning.  I suppose it was meant as a sort of peace-offering.\"    It was arranged to hold what was called \"The Rainbow Fete\" on  breaking-up afternoon, and parents and friends were invited to the  ceremony. There was to be both a sale and an exhibition. The best of the  toys and little fancy articles were to be at a special stall, and would  be sold for the benefit of the \"War Orphans' Fund,\" and those that were  not quite up to standard would nevertheless be on view, and would be  sent away afterwards to help to deck Christmas trees in the slums. _THE_  stall, as the girls called it, was of course the center of attraction.  It was draped with colored muslins in the rainbow tints, and though real  irises were unobtainable, some vases of artificial ones formed a very  good substitute. The home-made toys were really most creditable to the  handicraft-workers, and had been ingeniously contrived with bobbins,  small boxes, and slight additions"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18525"],[0,"On the Trail: An Outdoor Book for Girls (#20)"],[1,"dark, glossy green above. They are oval in shape  and have a few small teeth or none at all. The flowers are white, waxy,  and cup-shaped; they hang like bells from their short stems. The plant  grows close to the ground, generally in the woods and moist places. It  is found as far north as Maine and west to Michigan.    Do not mistake the bunchberry for the wintergreen. It, too, grows low on  the ground, but the bunchberries are in close clusters at the top of the  small plant where the leaves radiate. The berries are bright scarlet,  round and smooth, and are _not_ edible. Flower and leaf resemble those  of the dogwood-tree, to which family the bunchberry belongs.      =Partridgeberry=    Another ground berry is the partridgeberry. This may be eaten but is dry  and rather tasteless. It is a red berry and grows on a slender, trailing  vine. Its leaves are small and heart-shaped; some are veined with white.  They are evergreen. The flowers grow in pairs and are like four-pointed  stars at the ends of slender tubes. Inside they are creamy white,  outside a delicate pink. The partridgeberry likes pine forests and dry  woods.      =June-Berry. Shadbush=    There are berries on trees as well as on bushes and vines, at least they  are called berries though not always resembling them.    The June-berry is a tree from ten to thirty feet in height, while its  close relative, the shadbush, is a low tree and sometimes a shrub. The  fruit resembles the seed-vessels of the rose; it grows in clusters and  is graded in color from red to violet; it has a slight bloom and the  calyx shows at the summit. It ripens in June and is said to be sweet and  delicious in flavor. The oblong leaves are sharply toothed, rounded at  the base and pointed at the tip. The young leaves are hairy. The flowers  are white and grow in clusters.    The shadbush grows in wet places and its fruit is smaller and on shorter  stems. It is also said to be more juicy. The leaves are rather woolly.    [Illustration: PERSIMMON    SWEET VIBURNUM    Fruits found principally in the south and the middle west.]      =Red Mulberry=    Although the finest _mulberry-trees_ are said to be found along the  Mississippi and the lower Ohio Rivers, I have seen large, thrifty trees  in Connecticut and on Long Island. They grow from Massachusetts to  Florida and west to Nebraska. Birds are very fond of the mulberry. The  first rose-breasted grosbeaks I ever saw were in a great mulberry-tree  on a farm in the northern part of Connecticut. The berry is shaped much  like a blackberry; it is juicy and sweet, but lacks flavor. It grows on  a short stem and is about an inch in length. In July when the berry  ripens it is a dark purple.    There is a decided variety in the shape of the leaves on one tree; some  have seven lobes, some none at all. The edges of most are scalloped,  though I have seen leaves with smooth edges.    The _white mulberry_ is seldom found growing wild. The fruit is like the  red mulberry but perfectly white.      =Sweet Viburnum. Nanny-Berry. Sheepberry=    The fruit of the sweet viburnum, nanny-berry or sheepberry, is said to  be edible. It grows on a small tree, of the honeysuckle family, in the  woods and by the streams from Canada to Georgia and west as far as  Missouri. The tree has a rusty, scaly bark and broad, oval leaves,  pointed at the tip and finely toothed. The flower clusters are large  and, though white, they appear yellowish from the many yellow anthers at  the centre. When entirely ripe the fruit is a dark blue or black and is  covered with a bloom; before ripening it is crimson. The berry grows in  clusters on slender red stems. It is elongated and rather large. At its  summit is the calyx and stigma. The seed inside the berry is a stone  which is flattened, blunt-pointed, and grooved. The fruit ripens in  September and October.      =Large-Fruited Thorn=    The thorns, large-fruited and scarlet, are edible. As a child I knew the  fruit as _haws_ and was very fond of it. The large-fruited thorn is a  low tree with branches spreading out horizontally. You will often find  it in thickets. The bark is rough and the thorns on the branches are  long, sharp, and of a light-brown color. In flavor the fruit is sweet  and apple-like; the flesh is dry and mealy; it grows on hairy stems and  the seeds are hard, rounded, and grooved. The summit is tipped with the  calyx and it ripens in September. The leaves are thick, narrowed at the  base, and rounded at the ends, with veins underneath that are prominent  and often hairy.      =Black Haw. Stag-Bush=    The fruit of the black haw, or stag-bush, is not edible until after  frost has touched it. It is oval, dark blue with bloom, and about half  an inch long. It grows in stiff clusters on short, branching stems. The  shrub, which is sometimes a small tree, is bushy and crooked, with stout  and spreading branches. It is found from Connecticut to Georgia and as  far west as the Indian Territory. It grows among the underbrush in  forests. The bark is scaly and of a reddish-brown color, the leaves are  dark green and smooth on the upper side, paler and sometimes covered  with matted hair on the under side, where the veins show prominently;  they are two or three inches long and generally oval in shape with no  teeth. The flowers are cream-white and grow in flat-topped clusters.      =Wild Plums. Canada Plum=    There is a wild plum that is found in our New England States and in  Canada known as the Canada plum. The plant grows along fences, in  thickets, and by the side of streams. The plum is from one inch to one  and a half inches long and is red or orange in color. It has a tough  skin and a flat stone. The flavor is considered pleasant but the fruit  is generally used for preserving. The leaves have long, sharp points at  the ends and are rather heart-shaped at the base. The flowers, white in  bud, change to pink when opened. They grow in thin clusters.      =Beach Plum=    Usually on sandy and stony beaches, though at times farther inland, you  may find the beach plum. It is a low shrub and grows in clumps. The  fruit is apt to be abundant and is sweet when quite ripe. This plum,  also, is used for preserving. The color of the fruit is from red to  red-purple, it has a bloom over it and grows on a slender stem. The thin  stone is rounded on one edge, sharp on the other, and generally has  pointed ends. The fruit ripens in August and September. The leaf is  oval, has a sharp-pointed tip, is rounded at the base, and has fine,  forward-pointed teeth. There are many white flowers which grow in  clusters along the branches.      =Wild Red Cherry=    The wild red cherry is sour but edible; it is best used as preserves.  The tree is usually small yet sometimes reaches the height of thirty  feet. It is oftenest found in the woods of the north, but also grows  among the mountains as far south as Tennessee. The bark is a  reddish-brown and has rusty dots over it. The leaves are oblong, pointed  at the tips and rather blunt at the base. They are bright green and  glossy. The white flower is much like the cultivated cherry blossom but  smaller; it grows in clusters. The cherries are light red and about the  size of a pea.    [Illustration: CANADA PLUM    SCARLET HAW    WILD BLACK CHERRY    Fruits found principally in the north and the middle west.]      =Sand-Cherry=    Growing in the sand along our eastern coast as far south as New Jersey  and sometimes on the shores of the Great Lakes, the sand-cherry is  found. It is a low, trailing bush, but in some cases sends up erect  branches as high as four feet. The fruit is dark red--black when quite  ripe--and about half an inch long. It grows in small clusters or  solitary, and is said to be sweet and edible. The leaves, dark green on  the upper side, are lighter underneath; they are rather narrow, broadest  toward the end and tapering at the base. The edge is toothed almost to  the base. The flowers are white and thinly clustered.      =Persimmon=    In the Southern, Western, and Middle States, some say as far north as  New York, grows the _persimmon_. Deliciously sweet and spicy when frost  has ripened it, very astringent until ripe. It is plentiful in Kentucky  and one of my earliest memories is of going to market with my mother in  the fall to buy persimmons. There I learned to avoid the fair, perfect  fruit, though to all appearances it was quite ripe, and to choose that  which looked bruised and broken.    The persimmon is about the size of a plum, but is flattened at the  poles. It grows close to the branch and its calyx is large. The color is  yellow generally flushed with red. Some writers describe it as juicy,  but I would not call it that; the flesh is more like custard or soft  jelly.    The tree usually varies in height from thirty to fifty feet, but in some  places is said to reach one hundred or more feet. The trunk is short and  the branches spreading. In the south it often forms a thicket in  uncultivated fields and along roadsides. The bark is dark brown or dark  gray, the surface is scaly and divided into plates. The leaves are  usually a narrow oval with smooth edges; when matured they are dark  green and glossy on the upper side, underneath pale and often downy. The  flower is a creamy-white or greenish-yellow.      =Papaw=    The papaw is another fruit I knew well as a child. It is sometimes  called custard-apple because the flesh resembles soft custard. As I  write I can almost taste the, to me, sickish sweetness of the fruit and  feel the large, smooth, flat seeds in my mouth. In shape the papaw  somewhat resembles the banana, the texture of the skin is the same, but  the surface of the papaw is smoothly rounded and it is shorter and  thicker than the banana, being usually from three to five inches long.  It ripens in September and October. The tree is small, often a shrub,  and it grows wild no farther north than western New York."]]]
