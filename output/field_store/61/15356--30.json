The members were, Warham, archbishop of Canterbury and  chancellor; the earl of Shrewsbury, steward; Lord Herbert, chamberlain;  Sir Thomas Lovel, master of the wards and constable of the Tower; Sir  Edward Poynings, comptroller; Sir Henry Marney, afterwards Lord Marney;  Sir Thomas Darcy, afterwards Lord Darcy; Thomas Ruthal, doctor of laws;  and Sir Henry Wyat.[*] These men had long been accustomed to business  under the late king, and were the least unpopular of all the ministers  employed by that monarch. But the chief competitors for favor and  authority, under the new king, were the earl of Surrey, treasurer, and  Fox, bishop of Winchester, secretary and privy seal. This prelate, who  enjoyed great credit during all the former reign, had acquired such  habits of caution and frugality as he could not easily lay aside; and  he still opposed, by his remonstrances, those schemes of dissipation  and expense, which the youth and passions of Henry rendered agreeable to  him. But Surrey was a more dexterous courtier; and though few had borne  a greater share in the frugal politics of the late king, he knew how  to conform himself to the humor of his new master; and no one was so  forward in promoting that liberality, pleasure, and magnificence,  which began to prevail under the young monarch.[**] By this policy, he  ingratiated himself with Henry; he made advantage, as well as the other  courtiers, of the lavish disposition of his master; and he engaged  him in such a course of play and idleness as rendered him negligent of  affairs, and willing to intrust the government of the state entirely  into the hands of his ministers. The great treasures amassed by the late  king were gradually dissipated in the giddy expenses of Henry. One party  of pleasure succeeded to another: tilts, tournaments, and carousals  were exhibited with all the magnificence of the age; and as the present  tranquillity of the public permitted the court to indulge itself in  every amusement, serious business was but little attended to. Or, if  the king intermitted the course of his festivity, he chiefly employed  himself in an application to music and literature, which were his  favorite pursuits, and which were well adapted to his genius.         * Herbert, Stowe, p. 486. Holingshed, p. 799.         ** Lord Herbert.    He had made such proficiency in the former art, as even to compose  some pieces of church music, which were sung in his chapel.[*] He was  initiated in the elegant learning of the ancients. And though he was so  unfortunate as to be seduced into a study of the barren controversies of  the schools, which were then fashionable, and had chosen Thomas Aquinas  for his favorite author, he still discovered a capacity fitted for more  useful and entertaining knowledge.    The frank and careless humor of the king, as it led him to dissipate the  treasures amassed by his father, rendered him negligent in protecting  the instruments whom that prince had employed in his extortions. A  proclamation being issued to encourage complaints, the rage of the  people was let loose on all informers, who had so long exercised an  unbounded tyranny over the nation: [**] they were thrown into prison,  condemned to the pillory, and most of them lost their lives by the  violence of the populace. Empson and Dudley, who were most exposed to  public hatred, were immediately summoned before the council, in order to  answer for their conduct, which had rendered them so obnoxious.         * Lord Herbert.         ** Herbert, Stowe, p. 486. Holingshed, p. 799. Polyd. Virg.       lib, xxvii.    Empson made a shrewd apology for himself, as well as for his associate.  He told the council, that so far from his being justly exposed to  censure for his past conduct, his enemies themselves grounded their  clamor on actions which seemed rather to merit reward and approbation:  that a strict execution of law was the crime of which he and Dudley were  accused; though that law had been established by general consent,  and though they had acted in obedience to the king, to whom the  administration of justice was intrusted by the constitution: that it  belonged not to them, who were instruments in the hands of supreme  power, to determine what laws were recent or obsolete, expedient or  hurtful; since they were all alike valid, so long as they remained  unrepealed by the legislature: that it was natural for a licentious  populace to murmur against the restraints of authority; but all wise  states had ever made their glory consist in the just distribution of  rewards and punishments, and had annexed the former to the observance  and enforcement of the laws, the latter to their violation and  infraction; and that a sudden overthrow of all government might be  expected where the judges were committed to the mercy of the criminals,  the rulers to that of the subjects.[*]    Notwithstanding this defence, Empson and Dudley were sent to the Tower,  and soon after brought to their trial. The strict execution of laws,  however obsolete, could never be imputed to them as a crime in a court  of judicature; and it is likely that, even where they had exercised  arbitrary power, the king, as they had acted by the secret commands of  his father, was not willing that their conduct should undergo too  severe a scrutiny. In order, therefore, to gratify the people with  the punishment of these obnoxious ministers crimes very improbable,  or indeed absolutely impossible, were charged upon them: that they had  entered into a conspiracy against the sovereign, and had intended, on  the death of the late king, to have seized by force the administration  of government. The jury were so far moved by popular prejudices,  joined to court influence, as to give a verdict against them; which was  afterwards confirmed by a bill of attainder in parliament,[**] and, at  the earnest desire of the people, was executed by warrant from the king,  Thus, in those arbitrary times, justice was equally violated, whether  the king sought power and riches, or courted popularity.         * Herbert, Holingshed, p. 804.         ** This parliament met on the 21st January, 1510. A law was       there enacted, in order to prevent some abuses which had       prevailed during the late reign. The forfeiture upon the       penal statutes was reduced to the term of three years. Costs       and damages were given against informers upon acquittal of       the accused: more severe punishments were enacted against       perjury: the false inquisitions procured by Empson and       Dudley were declared null and invalid. Traverses were       allowed; and the time of tendering them enlarged. 1 Henry       VIII. c. 8, 10, 11, 12.    Henry, while he punished the instruments of past tyranny, had yet such a  deference to former engagements as to deliberate, immediately after his  accession, concerning the celebration of his marriage with the infanta  Catharine, to whom he had been affianced during his father's lifetime.  Her former marriage with his brother, and the inequality of their years  were the chief objections urged; against his espousing her but, on the  other hand, the advantages of her known virtue, modesty, and sweetness  of disposition were insisted on; the affection which she bore to the  king; the large dowry to which she was entitled as princess of Wales;  the interest of cementing a close alliance with Spain; the necessity  of finding some confederate to counterbalance the power of France; the  expediency of fulfilling the engagements of the late king When these  considerations were weighed, they determined the council, though  contrary to the opinion of the primate, to give Henry their advice for  celebrating the marriage. The countess of Richmond, who had concurred  in the same sentiments with the council, died soon after the marriage of  her grandson.    The popularity of Henry's government, his undisputed title, his  extensive authority, his large treasures, the tranquillity of his  subjects, were circumstances which rendered his domestic administration  easy and prosperous: the situation of foreign affairs was no less happy  and desirable. Italy continued still, as during the late reign, to be  the centre of all the wars and negotiations of the European princes; and  Henry's alliance was courted by all parties; at the same time that he  was not engaged by any immediate interest or necessity to take part with  any. Lewis XII. of France, after his conquest of Milan, was the only  great prince that possessed any territory in Italy; and could he have  remained in tranquillity, he was enabled by his situation to prescribe  laws to all the Italian princes and republics, and to hold the balance  among them. But the desire of making a conquest of Naples, to which he  had the same title or pretensions with his predecessor, still engaged  him in new enterprises: and. as he foresaw opposition from Ferdinand,  who was connected both by treaties and affinity with Frederick of  Naples, he endeavored by the offers of interest, to which the ears of  that monarch were ever open, to engage him in an opposite confederacy.  He settled with him a plan for the partition of the kingdom of Naples,  and the expulsion of Frederick; a plan which the politicians of that,  age regarded as the most egregious imprudence in the French monarch,  and the greatest perfidy in the Spanish. Frederick, supported only by  subjects who were either discontented with his government or indifferent  about his fortunes, was unable to resist so powerful a confederacy, and  was deprived of his dominions: but he had the satisfaction to see Naples  immediately prove the source of contention among his enemies. Ferdinand  gave secret orders to his general, Gonsalvo, whom the Spaniards honor  with the appellation of the \"great captain,\" to attack the armies of  France, and make himself master of all the dominions of Naples."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19214"],[0,"The History of England in Three Volumes, Vol. I., Part D. (#20)"],[1,"sdon, in order to  officiate at the baptism of the young prince; and she sent by them some  magnificent presents to the queen of Scots.    The birth of a son gave additional zeal to Mary's partisans in  England;[**] and even men of the most opposite parties began to cry  aloud for some settlement of the succession. These humors broke out  with great vehemence in a new session of parliament, held after six  prorogations. The house of peers, which had hitherto forborne to touch  on this delicate point, here took the lead; and the house of commons  soon after imitated the zeal of the lords. Molineux opened the matter in  the lower house, and proposed, that the question of the succession  and that of supply should go hand in hand; as if it were intended  to constrain the queen to a compliance with the request of her  parliament.[***] The courtiers endeavored to elude the debate: Sir Ralph  Sadler told the house, that he had heard the queen positively affirm,  that for the good of her people she was determined to marry. Secretary  Cecil and Sir Francis Knollys gave their testimony to the same purpose;  as did also Sir Ambrose Cave, chancellor of the duchy, and Sir Edward  Rogers, comptroller of the household.[****]         * Melvil, p. 69, 70.         ** Camden, p. 397.         *** D'Ewes, p. 129.         **** D'Ewes, p. 124.    Elizabeth's ambitious and masculine character was so well known, that  few members gave any credit to this intelligence; and it was considered  merely as an artifice, by which she endeavored to retract that positive  declaration which she had made in the beginning of her reign, that she  meant to live and die a virgin. The ministers, therefore, gained nothing  further by this piece of policy, than only to engage the house, for the  sake of decency, to join the question of the queen's marriage with that  of a settlement of the crown; and the commons were proceeding with great  earnestness in the debate, and had even appointed a committee to confer  with the lords, when express orders were brought them from Elizabeth not  to proceed further in the matter. Cecil told them, that she pledged to  the house the word of a queen for her sincerity in her intentions to  marry; that the appointment of a successor would be attended with great  danger to her person; that she herself had had experience, during the  reign of her sister, how much court was usually paid to the next heir,  and what dangerous sacrifices men were commonly disposed to make of  their present duty to their future prospects; and that she was therefore  determined to delay, till a more proper opportunity, the decision of  that important question.[*] The house was not satisfied with these  reasons, and still less with the command prohibiting them all debate  on the subject. Paul Wentworth, a spirited member, went so far as to  question whether such a prohibition were not an infringement of the  liberties and privileges of the house.[**] Some even ventured to violate  that profound respect which had hitherto been preserved to the queen;  and they affirmed, that she was bound in duty, not only to provide  for the happiness of her subjects during her own life, but also to  pay regard to their future security, by fixing a successor; that by an  opposite conduct she showed herself the step-mother, not the natural  parent of her people, and would seem desirous that England should no  longer subsist than she should enjoy the glory and satisfaction  of governing it; that none but timorous princes, or tyrants, or  faint-hearted women, ever stood in fear of their successors; and that  the affections of the people were a firm and impregnable rampart to  every sovereign, who, laying aside all artifice or by-ends, had courage  and magnanimity to put his sole trust in that honorable and sure  defence.[***] The queen, hearing of these debates, sent for the speaker;  and after reiterating her former prohibition, she bade him inform the  house, that if any member remained still unsatisfied, he might appear  before the privy council, and there give his reasons.[****]           * D'Ewes, p. 127, 128.         ** D'Ewes, p. 128.         *** Camden, p. 400.         **** D'Ewes, p. 128.    As the members showed a disposition, notwithstanding these peremptory  orders, still to proceed upon the question, Elizabeth thought proper, by  a message, to revoke them, and to allow the house liberty of debate.[*]  They were so mollified by this gracious condescension, that they  thenceforth conducted the matter with more calmness and temper, and they  even voted her a supply, to be levied at three payments, of a subsidy  and a fifteenth, without annexing any condition to it.    {1567.} The queen soon after dissolved the parliament, and told them,  with some sharpness in the conclusion, that their proceedings had  contained much dissimulation and artifice; that, under the plausible  pretences of marriage and succession, many of them covered very  malevolent intentions towards her; but that, however, she reaped this  advantage from the attempts of these men, that she could now distinguish  her friends from her enemies. \"But do you think,\" added she, \"that I am  unmindful of your future security, or will be negligent in settling the  succession? That is the chief object of my concern; as I know myself to  be liable to mortality. Or do you apprehend that I meant to encroach on  your liberties? No: it was never my meaning; I only intended to stop  you before you approached the precipice. All things have their time; and  though you maybe blessed with a sovereign more wise or more learned than  I, yet I assure you that no one will ever rule over you who shall be  more careful of your safety. And therefore, henceforward, whether I  live to see the like assembly or no, or whoever holds the reins of  government, let me warn you to beware of provoking your sovereign's  patience, so far as you have done mine. But I shall now conclude, that,  notwithstanding the disgusts I have received, (for I mean not to part  with you in anger), the greater part of you may assure themselves that  they go home in their prince's good graces.\"[**]    Elizabeth carried further her dignity on this occasion. She had received  the subsidy without any condition; but as it was believed that the  commons had given her that gratuity with a view of engaging her to yield  to their requests, she thought proper, on her refusal, voluntarily  to remit the third payment; and she said, that money in her subjects'  purses was as good to her as in her own exchequer.[***]         * D'Ewes, p. 130.         ** D'Ewes, p. 116, 117.         *** J Camden, p. 400.    But though the queen was able to elude, for the present, the  applications of parliament, the friends of the queen of Scots multiplied  every day in England; and besides the Catholics, many of whom kept  a treasonable correspondence with her, and were ready to rise at  her command,[*] the court itself of Elizabeth was full of her avowed  partisans. The duke of Norfolk, the earls of Leicester, Pembroke,  Bedford, Northumberland, Sir Nicholas Throgmorton, and most of the  considerable men in England, except Cecil, seemed convinced of the  necessity of declaring her the successor. None but the more zealous  Protestants adhered either to the countess of Hertford, or to her aunt,  Eleanor, countess of Cumberland; and as the marriage of the former  seemed liable to some objections, and had been declared invalid, men  were alarmed, even on that side, with the prospect of new disputes  concerning the succession. Mary's behavior, also, so moderate towards  the Protestants, and so gracious towards all men, had procured her  universal respect;[**] and the public was willing to ascribe any  imprudences into which she had fallen to her youth and inexperience. But  all these flattering prospects were blasted by the subsequent incidents;  where her egregious indiscretions, shall I say, or atrocious crimes,  threw her from the height of her prosperity and involved her in infamy  and in ruin.    The earl of Bothwell was of a considerable family and power in Scotland;  and though not distinguished by any talents either of a civil or  military nature, he had made a figure in that party which opposed the  greatness of the earl of Murray and the more rigid reformers. He was  a man of profligate manners; had involved his opulent fortune in great  debts, and even reduced himself to beggary by his profuse expenses;[***]  and seemed to have no resource but in desperate counsels and  enterprises.         * Haynes, p. 446, 448.         ** Melvil, p. 53, 61, 74.         *** Keith, p. 240.    He had been accused more than once of an attempt to assassinate Murray;  and though the frequency of these accusations on all sides diminish  somewhat the credit due to any particular imputation, they prove  sufficiently the prevalence of that detestable practice in Scotland, and  may in that view serve to render such rumors the more credible. This man  had of late acquired the favor and entire confidence of Mary; and all  her measures were directed by his advice and authority. Reports were  spread of more particular intimacies between them; and these reports  gained ground from the continuance, or rather increase, of her hatred  towards her husband.[*] That young prince was reduced to such a state  of desperation by the neglects which he underwent from his queen and  the courtiers, that he had once resolved to fly secretly into France or  Spain, and had even provided a vessel for that purpose.[**] Some of  the most considerable nobility, on the other hand, observing her rooted  aversion to him, had proposed some expedients for a divorce, and though  Mary is said to have spoken honorably on the occasion, and to have  embraced the proposal no further than it should be found consistent  with her own honor and her son's legitimacy,[***] men were inclined to  believe, that the difficulty of"]]]
