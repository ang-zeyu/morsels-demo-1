Tim hums and haws.  \"On the--oh--the--the, on the--er--the--\"    \"Next boy?\"    \"Berlin is on the Spree, sir.\"    \"Ah, of course!  It slipped me,\" mutters Tim with a thoughtful frown.  \"Any one knows Berlin is on the Spree!\"  And down he goes again, as if  it were the common lot of all clever boys.    Arithmetic ensues.  \"Tell me, Timothy, if a man earns four shillings and  sixpence halfpenny a day, how much does he make in a week of six days?\"    This enormous problem Tim takes due time to cogitate.  Of course he  could tell you straight off if he chose; but as it is the practice to  work out sums in the head, he condescends to the common prejudice.  At  length the oracle speaks.    \"One pound three and two pence halfpenny.\"    \"Quite wrong; what do you make it, Edward?\"    \"One pound four.\"    \"Wrong.  Next?\"    \"One pound seven and threepence.\"    \"That's right.\"    \"Oh yes, to be sure!\" exclaims Tim, with the gesture of one who clutches  at the very words of his own lips uttered by another; \"of course,  _that's what I meant_!\"    \"Timothy,\" says the master, gravely, \"if you meant it, why did you not  say it?\"    Why not, indeed?  That is one of the very few questions, reader, in all  this world's philosophy which Timothy is unable to answer.    Of course every one laughs at Timothy, but that does not afflict him.  So fortified is he in the assurance of his own infallibility, that the  scorn of the ignorant is to him but as the rippling of water at the base  of a lighthouse.    Do not mistake me, Tim is not a dunce.  For every question he answers  wrongly, perhaps he answers half a dozen correctly.  If he chose to take  his stand on his general proficiency, he would pass for a fairly clever  fellow.  But that will by no means satisfy him.  He will never admit  himself beaten.  There is always some trivial accident, some unforeseen  coincidence, without which his success would have been certain and  recognised; but which, as it happens, slightly interfere with his  triumph.    It is the same in games as in the class-room.  If he is beaten in a  race, it is because he has slipped in starting; if he is clean bowled  first ball at cricket, it is because there was a lump in the grass just  where the ball pitched; if he lets the enemy's halfback pass him at  football, it is because he made sure Perkins had collared him--  otherwise, of course, he would have won the race, made top score at the  wickets, and saved his goal.  As it happens, he does neither.    There is a touch of dishonesty in this, though perhaps Tim does not  intend it.  Why cannot he own he is \"out of it\" now and then?  His  fellows would respect him far more and laugh at him far less; he would  gain far more than he lost, besides having the satisfaction of knowing  he had not tried to deceive anybody.  But I sometimes think, when Tim  makes his absurd excuses, he really believes what he says; just as the  ostrich, when he buries his head in the sand, really believes he is  hidden from the sight of his pursuers.    It is natural in human nature not to relish the constant admission of  error or failure.  Who of us is not glad to feel at times (even if we do  not say it) that \"it's not our fault\"?  The person who is always making  little of himself, and never admitting what small merit he might fairly  claim, is pretty much the same sort of deception as Tim, and we despise  him almost as much.  We would all of us, in fact (and what wonder?) like  to be \"always right,\" and perhaps our tendency is to let the wish become  father to the thought rather too often.    But to return to Timothy.  Nothing, of course, could astonish him;  nothing was ever news to him; nothing could evoke his applause.  \"Tim,\"  perhaps some one would say, \"do you know old Grinder (the head master)  is going to be married, and we are to get a week extra holiday?\"    \"Ah,\" says Tim, to whom this is all news, \"I always thought there was  something of the kind up.  For my own part, I thought we should get a  fortnight extra.\"    \"Buck made a good jump yesterday, Tim,\" says another.  \"Five feet and  half an inch.\"    \"Sure it wasn't three-quarters of an inch?\" is Tim's provoking answer.    Of all irritating things, perhaps the most irritating is to have your  big bundle of news calmly opened and emptied, and its contents  appropriated without scruple or acknowledgment.    Tim this very day has the gratification of amazing half the school with  the news of Dr Grinder's approaching marriage and the consequent extra  holidays, and of seeing the enthusiastic astonishment of others to whom  he retails the latest achievement of the athletic Buck.    But he did not always come off so easily.  Once he was made the victim  of a joke which, in any one less self-satisfied, might have effectually  checked his foolish propensity.  It was a wet day, and the boys were all  assembled in the big play-room, not knowing exactly what to do, and  ready for the first bit of fun which might turn up.    \"Couldn't somebody draw Tim out?\" one of us whispered.    The idea caught like wildfire, and after a brief pause Tidswell, the  monitor, said, amid the hushed attention of the company--    \"By the way, Tim, wasn't that a queer account of the sea-serpent in the  paper the other day?\"    \"Awfully queer,\" replied the unsuspecting Tim; \"I didn't know you had  seen it.\"    \"Fancy a beast a mile and a half long from head to tail!\"    \"It's a good size,\" said Tim, \"but nothing out of the common for a sea-  serpent, you know.\"    \"Now I come to think of it, though,\" said Tidswell, \"it didn't say that  the _serpent_ was a mile and a half long; it was a mile and a half from  the ship when it was seen, wasn't that it?\"    \"Yes, a mile and a half from the ship.  I _thought_ you were drawing the  long bow in saying it was so big as all that.\"    \"They saw it a mile and a half off, and just fancy feeling its breath at  that distance?\"    \"I'm not astonished at that,\" said Tim, \"for all those beasts have  enormous lungs.\"    \"How absurd of me!  I should have said it seemed to all appearances  lifeless when they saw it,\" said Tidswell.    \"Yes; dead, in fact,\" put in Tim, getting into difficulties.    \"And then suddenly it stood erect on its tail, and shot forward towards  the vessel.\"    \"Shows the strength of their backs.  I couldn't help thinking that when  I saw the account.\"    \"What am I talking about?\" exclaimed Tidswell, hastily correcting  himself; \"it was the ship stood in towards the monster and shot at him.\"    \"Ah, yes; so it was.  I made the same mistake myself, see.  Yes, they  fired a broadside at him.\"    \"No; only one shot at his head.\"    \"That was all.  Isn't that what you said?\"    \"And then he turned over in the water--\"    \"Dead as a leg of mutton!\" put in Tim.    \"No; the shot missed him, and he wasn't touched.\"    \"No.  I meant they all thought he was as dead as a leg of mutton; but he  was not so much as grazed.\"    All this while the amusement of the listeners had been growing gradually  beyond control, and at this point smothered explosions of laughter from  one and another fell on Tim's ears, like the dropping of musketry fire.  But he did not guess its meaning, and continued turning towards  Tidswell, and waiting for the conclusion of the story.    \"And the last they saw of him,\" resumed that worthy, his voice quailing  with the exertion to keep it grave and composed--\"the last they saw of  him was, he was spinning away at the rate of twenty knots an hour, with  his tail in his mouth, in the direction of the North Pole.\"    \"I fancied it was only eighteen knots an hour,\" put in Tim seriously.    Another moment, and the laughter would assuredly burst upon him.    \"Not in the account I saw.  What paper did you see it in, Tim?\"    \"Eh?  Why, the same as you,\" replied Tim hurriedly, beginning to suspect  the crimson faces of his comrades meant something more than admiration  of his wisdom.  \"Where did you get the tale from?  I forget.\"    \"I got the tale out of my head--like the serpent, you humbug!\" roared  Tidswell; and for the next five minutes Tim sat on his stool of  repentance, amid the yells of laughter with which his companions hailed  his discomfiture.    When silence was restored, of course he tried to explain that \"he knew  all along it was a joke, and only wanted to see how far he could gammon  the fellows, and fancied he succeeded,\" and presently quitted the room,  an injured but by no means humiliated boy.    One last word.  Timothy and his friends are amusing up to one point, and  detestable up to another point; but when they come to you in the hour of  your deepest sorrow and distress, and, with bland smile, say to you, \"I  told you so!\" they are beyond all endurance, and you hope for nothing  more devoutly than that you may never see their odious faces again.    The best cure possible for Tim is a homoeopathic one.  Find some other  boy equally conceited, equally foolish, equally unscrupulous, and set  him at Tim.  I will undertake to say that--unless the two devour one  another down to the very tips of their tails, like the famous Kilkenny  cats--they will bring one another to reason, and perhaps modesty, in  double-quick time.    The great and wise Newton once said of himself that, so far from knowing  all things, he seemed to himself to be but as a boy gathering pebbles on  the seashore, while the great ocean of truth lay all undiscovered before  him.    Newton was, in his way, almost as fine a fellow as Timothy Told-you-so,  and if Timothy would but stoop to have more of Newton's spirit, he might  in time come to possess an atom or two of Newton's sense.        CHAPTER TWELVE.    THE UNTIDY BOY.    Look at him!  You could tell he was an untidy fellow at a single glance.  One of his bootlaces is hanging loose, and the band of his scarf has  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21138"],[0,"Love's Meinie: Three Lectures on Greek and English Birds (#20)"],[1,"every now and then, in a rasorial  manner, I can scratch some savory or useful contents;--one or two, it  may be remembered, I collected for the behoof of the Bishop of  Manchester, on this very subject, (_Contemporary Review_, Feb. 1880);  and some of Mr. Hartwig's half-sandy, half-soppy, political opinions,  are offered to the consideration of the British workman in the last  extant number of 'Fors.' Touching eider ducks, I find in his fifth  chapter--on Iceland--he quotes the following account, by Mr. Shepherd,  of the shore of the island of 'Isafjardarjup'--a word which seems to  contain in itself an introduction to Icelandic literature:--    127. \"The ducks and their nests were everywhere, in a manner that was  quite alarming. Great brown ducks sat upon their nests in masses, and  at every step started up from under our feet. It was with difficulty  that we avoided treading on some of the nests. The island being but  three-quarters of a mile in width, the opposite shore was soon reached.  On the coast was a wall built of large stones, just above the  high-water level, about three feet in height, and of considerable  thickness. At the bottom, on both sides of it, alternate stones had  been left out, so as to form a series of square compartments for the  ducks to make their nests in. Almost every compartment was occupied;  and, as we walked along the shore, a long line of ducks flew out one  after another. The surface of the water also was perfectly white with  drakes, who welcomed their brown wives with loud and clamorous cooing.  When we arrived at the farmhouse, we were cordially welcomed by its  mistress. The house itself was a great marvel. The earthen wall that  surrounded it and the window embrasures were occupied by ducks. On the  ground, the house was fringed with ducks. On the turf-slopes of the  roof we could see ducks; and a duck sat in the scraper.    \"A grassy bank close by had been cut into square patches like a  chess-board, (a square of turf of about eighteen inches being removed,  and a hollow made,) and all were filled with ducks. A windmill was  infested, and so were all the out-houses, mounds, rocks, and crevices.  The ducks were everywhere. Many of them were so tame that we could  stroke them on their nests; and the good lady told us that there was  scarcely a duck on the island which would not allow her to take its  eggs without flight or fear.\"    128. But upon the back of the canvas, as it were, of this pleasant  picture--on the back of the leaf, in his book, p. 65,--this description  being given in p. 66,--Doctor Hartwig tells us, in his own peculiar  soppy and sandy way--half tearful, half Dryasdusty, (or may not we  say--it sounds more Icelandic--'Dry-as-sawdusty,') these less cheerful  facts. \"The eiderdown is easily collected, as the birds are quite tame.  The female having laid five or six pale greenish-olive eggs, in a nest  thickly lined with her beautiful down, the collectors, after carefully  removing the bird, rob the nest of its contents; after which they  replace her. She then begins to lay afresh--though this time only three  or four eggs,--and again has recourse to the down on her body. But her  greedy persecutors once more rifle her nest, and oblige her to line it  for the third time. Now, however, her own stock of down is exhausted,  and with a plaintive voice she calls her mate to her assistance, who  willingly plucks the soft feathers from his breast to supply the  deficiency. If the cruel robbery be again repeated, which in former  times was frequently the case, the poor eider-duck abandons the spot,  never to return, and seeks for a new home where she may indulge her  maternal instinct undisturbed by the avarice of man.\"    129. Now, as I have above told you, these two statements are given on  the two sides of the same leaf; and the reader must make what he may of  them. Setting the best of my own poor wits at them, it seems to me that  the merciless abstraction of down is indeed the usual custom of the  inhabitants and visitors; but that the 'good lady,' referred to by Mr.  Shepherd, manages things differently; and in consequence we are  presently farther told of her, (bottom of p. 65,) that \"when she first  became possessor of the island, the produce of down from the ducks was  not more than fifteen pounds weight in the year; but under her careful  nurture of twenty years it had risen to nearly one hundred pounds  annually. It requires about one pound and a half to make a coverlet for  a single bed, and the down is worth from twelve to fifteen shillings  per pound. Most of the eggs are taken and pickled for winter  consumption, one or two only being left to hatch.\"    But here, again, pulverulent Dr. Hartwig leaves us untold who  'consumes' all these pickled eggs of the cooing and downy-breasted  creatures; (you observe, in passing, that an eider-duck coos instead of  quacking, and must be a sort of Sea-Dove,) or what addition their price  makes to the good old lady's feather-nesting income of, as I calculate  it, sixty to seventy-five pounds a year,--all her twenty years of skill  and humanity and moderate plucking having got no farther than that. And  not feeling myself able, on these imperfect data, to offer any  recommendations to the Icelandic government touching the duck trade, I  must end my present chapter with a rough generalization of results. For  a beginning of which, the time having too clearly and sadly come for  me, as I have said in my preface, to knit up, as far as I may, the  loose threads and straws of my raveled life's work, I reprint in this  place the second paragraph of the chapter on Vital Beauty in the second  volume of 'Modern Painters,' premising, however, some few necessary  words.    130. I intended never to have reprinted the second volume of 'Modern  Painters'; first, because it is written in affected imitation of  Hooker, and not in my own proper style; and, secondly, yet chiefly,  because I did not think the analytic study of which it mainly consists,  in the least likely to be intelligible to the general student, or,  therefore, profitable to him. But I find now that the 'general student'  has plunged himself into such abysses, not of analytic, but of  dissolytic,--dialytic--or even diarrhoeic--lies, belonging to the  sooty and sensual elements of his London and Paris life, that, however  imperfectly or dimly done, the higher analysis of that early work of  mine ought at least to be put within his reach; and the fact, somehow,  enforced upon him, that there were people before _he_ lived, who knew  what 'aesthesis' meant, though they did not think that pigs' flavoring  of pigs'-wash was ennobled by giving it that Greek name: and that there  were also people before his time who knew what vital beauty meant,  though they did not seek it either in the model-room, or the Parc aux  Cerfs.    Therefore, I will republish (D.V.) the analytic parts of the second  volume of 'Modern Painters' as they were written, but with perhaps an  additional note or two, and the omission of the passages concerning  Evangelical or other religious matters, in which I have found out my  mistakes.    131. To be able to hunt for these mistakes, and crow over them, in the  original volume, will always give that volume its orthodox value in  sale catalogues, so that I shall swindle nobody who has already bought  the book by bringing down its price upon them. Nor will the new edition  be a cheap one--even if I ever get it out, which is by no means  certain. Here, however, at once, is the paragraph above referred to,  quite one of the most important in the book. The reader should know,  preparatorily, that for what is now called 'aesthesis,' _I_ always used,  and still use, the English word 'sensation'--as, for instance, the  sensation of cold or heat, and of their differences;--of the flavor of  mutton and beef, and their differences;--of a peacock's and a lark's  cry, and their differences;--of the redness in a blush, and in rouge,  and their differences;--of the whiteness in snow, and in almond-paste,  and their differences;--of the blackness and brightness of night and  day, or of smoke and gaslight, and their differences, etc., etc. But  for the Perception of Beauty, I always used Plato's word, which is the  proper word in Greek, and the only possible _single_ word that can be  used in any other language by any man who understands the  subject,--'Theoria,'--the Germans only having a term parallel to it,  'Anschauung,' assumed to be its equivalent in p. 22 of the old edition  of 'Modern Painters,' but which is not its real equivalent, for  Anschauung does not (I believe) _include_ bodily sensation, whereas  Plato's Theoria does, so far as is necessary; and mine, somewhat more  than Plato's. \"The first perfection,\" (then I say, in this so long in  coming paragraph) of the theoretic faculty, \"is the kindness and  unselfish fullness of heart, which receives the utmost amount of  pleasure from the happiness of all things. Of which in high degree the  heart of man is incapable; neither what intense enjoyment the angels  may have in all that they see of things that move and live, and in the  part they take in the shedding of God's kindness upon them, can we know  or conceive: only in proportion as we draw near to God, and are made in  measure like unto Him, can we increase this our possession of charity,  of which the entire essence is in God only. But even the ordinary  exercise of this faculty implies a condition of the whole moral being  in some measure right and healthy, and to the entire exercise of it  there is necessary the entire perfection of the Christian character;  for he who loves not God, nor his brother, cannot love the grass  beneath his feet, and the creatures which live not for his uses,  filling those spaces in the universe which he needs not; while, on the  other hand, none can love God, nor his human brother, without loving  all"]]]
