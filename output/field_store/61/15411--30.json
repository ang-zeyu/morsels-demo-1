[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20318"],[0,"Little Journeys to the Homes of the Great - Volume 14 (#20)"],[1,"poet's heart went out to the youthful  Mendelssohn as soon as he saw him!    He was a being to fill a poet's dream--such a youth as the Old Masters  used to picture as the Christ when He confounded the wise men. And then  the painters posed this same type of boy as Daniel in the lions' den;  and back in the days of Pericles, the Greeks were fond of showing the  beautiful youth, just approaching adolescence, in the nude, as the god  of Love. When the face has all the soft beauty of a woman, and the  figure, slight, slender, lithe and graceful, carries only a suggestion  of the masculine strength to come--then beauty is at perihelion. The  \"Eros\" of Phidias was not the helpless, dumpy cherub \"Cupid\"--he was a  slender-limbed boy of twelve years who showed collar-bone and revealed  every rib.    Beauty and strength of the highest type are never complete--their lure  lies in a certain reserve, and behind all is a suggestion of unfoldment.  Maturity is not the acme of beauty, because in maturity there is nothing  more to hope for--only the uncompleted fills the heart, for from it we  construct the Ideal.    Goethe looked out of his window and seeing Felix Mendelssohn playing  with the children, exclaimed to Zelter, \"He is a Greek god in the germ,  and I here solemnly protest against his wearing clothes.\"    The words sound singularly like the remark of Doctor Schneider, made ten  years later, when Herr Doctor removed the sheet that covered the dead  body of Goethe, and gazing upon the full-rounded limbs, the mighty  chest, the columnar neck and the Jovelike head, exclaimed, \"It is the  body of a Greek god!\" And the surgeons stood there in silent awe,  forgetful of their task.    Zelter, who introduced Mendelssohn to Goethe, was a fine old character,  nearly as fine a type as Goethe himself. Heine once said, \"Musicians  constitute a third sex.\" And that there have been some unsexed, or at  least unmanly men, who were great musicians, need not be denied. The art  of music borders more closely upon the dim and mystic realms of the  inspirational than any of the other arts. Music refuses to give up its  secrets in a formula and at last eludes the sciolist with his ever-ready  theorem. But still, all musicians are not dreamers. Zelter, for  instance, was a most hard-headed, practical man: a positivist and  mathematician with a turn for economics, and a Gradgrind for facts. He  was a stone-mason, and worked at his trade at odd times all through his  life, just because he felt it was every man's duty to work with his  hands. Imagine Tolstoy playing the piano and composing instead of making  shoes, and you have Zelter.    This curious character was bound to the Mendelssohn family by his love  for Moses Mendelssohn, the grandfather of Felix. Moses Mendel added the  \"sohn\" in loving recognition of his father, just as \"Bartholdy\" was  added by the father of Felix in loving token to his wife. It was the  grandfather of Felix who first gave glory to the name. We sometimes  forget that Moses Mendelssohn was one of the greatest thinkers Germany  has produced--the man who summed up in his own head all the philosophy  of the time and gave Spinoza to the world. This was the man to whom the  erratic Zelter was bound in admiration, and when it was suggested that  he teach musical composition to the grandchild of his idol, he accepted  the post with zest.    But there came a shade of disappointment to the grim and bearded Zelter  when he failed to find a trace of resemblance between the child and the  child's grandfather. The boy was sprightly, emotional, loving; and could  play the piano from his tenth year better than Zelter himself. When  Goethe teasingly suggested this fact, Zelter replied, \"You mean he plays  different, not better.\" Goethe apologized.    Yet the boy was not a philosopher, and this grieved Zelter, who wanted  him to be the grandson of his grandfather, and a musician besides.    The lad's skill in composition, however, soon turned the old teacher's  fears into joy. Such a pupil he had never had before! And he did not  reason it out that no one else had ever had, either. The child, like  Chopin, read music before he read print, and improvised, merging one  tune with another, bringing harmony out of hopeless chaos. Zelter  followed, fearing success would turn the boy's head--berating, scolding,  chiding, encouraging--and all the time admiring and loving. The pretty  boy was not much frightened by the old man's rough ways, but seized  upon such of the instruction as he needed and filled in the rest with  his own peerless soul.    The parents were astounded at such progress. At first they had wished  merely to round out the boy's education with a proper amount of musical  instruction, and now they reluctantly allowed the old teacher to have  his way--the lad must make his career a musical one. The boy composed a  cantata, which was given in the parlors of his parents' home, with an  orchestra secured for the occasion. Felix stood on a chair and led his  band of musicians with that solemn dignity which was his through life.  Zelter grumbled, ridiculed and criticized--that was the way he showed  his interest. The old musician declared they were making a \"Miss Nancy\"  of his pupil--saturating him with flattery, and he threatened to resign  his office--most certainly not intending to do so.    It was about this time that Zelter threw out the hint that he was going  down to Weimar to see his friend Goethe--would Felix like to go? Felix  would be delighted, and when the boy's father and mother were  interviewed, they were pleased, too, at the prospect of their boy's  making the acquaintance of the greatest poet of Germany. Felix was duly  cautioned about how he should conduct himself. He promised, of course,  and also agreed to write a letter home every day, recording the exact  language that the author of \"Werther\" used in his presence.    Goethe and the Carlylian Zelter had been cronies for many years. The  poet delighted in the company of the gruff old stone-mason musician, and  together they laughed at the world over their pipes and mugs. And  sometimes, alas, they hotly argued and raised their voices in  donner-und-blitzen style, as Germans have been known to do. Yet they  were friends, and the honest Zelter's yearly visits were as a godsend to  the old poet, who was often pestered to distraction by visitors who only  voiced the conventional, the inconsequential and absurd. Here was a man  who tried his steel.    Now, Zelter had his theories about teaching harmony--theories too finely  spun for any one but himself to grasp. Possibly he himself did not seize  them very firmly, but only argued them in a vain attempt to clear the  matter up in his own mind. The things we are not quite sure of are those  upon which we insist.    Goethe had pooh-poohed and smitten the table with his \"stein\" in denial.    And now Zelter, the frank and bold, stealthily and by concocted plot and  plan took his pupil, Felix Mendelssohn, with him on a visit to Weimar.  He wanted to confound his antagonist and to reveal by actual proof the  success that could be achieved where correct methods of instruction were  followed.    Jean Jacques had written a novel showing what right theories, properly  followed up, could do for his hero. Zelter had done better--he exhibited  the youth.    \"A girl in boy's clothes, I do believe,\" said Goethe, with his usual  banter, in the evening when a little company had gathered in the  parlors. Felix sat on his teacher's knee, with his arms around the old  man's neck, girl-like. \"Does he play?\" continued Goethe, going over and  opening the piano.    \"Oh, a little!\" answered Zelter indifferently.    The ladies insisted--they always had music when Zelter made them a  visit.    \"Come, make some noise and awaken the spirits that have so long lain  slumbering!\" ordered the old poet.    Zelter advanced to the piano and played a stiff, formal little tune of  his own.    He arose and motioned to Felix.    \"Play that!\" said the teacher.    The child sat down, and with an impatient little gesture and half-smile  at the audience, played the piece exactly as Zelter had played it, with  a certain drawling style that was all Zelter's own. It was so funny that  the listeners burst into shouts of laughter. But the boy instantly  restored order by striking the bass a strong stroke with both hands,  running the scale, and weaving that simple little air into the most  curious variations.    For ten minutes he played, bringing in Zelter's little tune again and  again, and then Zelter in a voice of pretended wrath cried, \"Cease that  tin-pan drumming and play something worth while.\"    Goethe arose, stroked the boy's pretty brown curls, kissed him on the  forehead and said: \"Yes, play something worth while. I know you two  rogues--you have been practising on that piece for a year or more, and  now you pretend to be improvising--I'll see whether you can play!\"    And going to a portfolio he took out a manuscript piece of music written  out in the fine, delicate hand of Mozart, and placed it on the  music-rack of the piano. Felix played the piece as if it were his own;  and then laying it aside, went back and played it through from memory.    Then piece after piece was brought out for him to play, and Zelter  leaned back and by his manner said, \"Oh, it is nothing!\"    And certainly it was nothing to the boy--he played with such ease that  his talent was quite unknown to himself. He had not yet discovered that  every one could not produce music just as they could talk.    Goethe's admiration for the boy was unbounded. The two weeks of  Mendelssohn's prescribed visit had expired and Goethe begged for an  extension of two weeks more. Every evening there was the little  impromptu concert. After that Felix paid various visits to Weimar.  Goethe's house was his home, and the affection between the old poet and  the young musician was very gentle "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20346"],[0,"Bell's Cathedrals: The Cathedral Church of Winchester (#20)"],[1,"house close by the old site, and subsequent  bishops completed it. Only the middle portion of this, with the Tudor  chapel, now remains, the southern end having been pulled down by Bishop  Brownlow North. The ruins of the castle can be seen from the top of the  cathedral tower.    On Wykeham's charter for the incorporation of his new foundation,  \"Seinte Marie College of Wynchestre,\" is the date October 20, 1382; but  it seems that long before this date and up to the actual completion of  the #College# buildings, the bishop superintended the education of the  boys for whom his institution was founded, housing them in temporary  structures in the meantime--possibly in S. John's parish, on S. Giles'  Hill, it has been suggested. Before Wykeham's time, and indeed before  the Conquest, it appears that the monks of S. Swithun's institution had  a school at Winchester, at which no less celebrated a pupil than Alfred  the Great was brought up. We have already touched on the subject of  Wykeham's ideas on education, and the change which he brought about by  his colleges at Winchester and Oxford, and it is not necessary to go  into the subject again. The College buildings lie beyond the southern  limits of the cathedral close, on the south side of the narrow College  Street, being entered by a gateway with an ancient statue of the Virgin  in the niche over it. This door leads into the quadrangle, about which  are ranged various parts of the college. A further arch under the tower  in this court leads to a larger quadrangle, in which are the Chapel and  the refectory or Hall, a room 63 feet by 30, with a groined oak roof and  a dais at one end for the Warden and Fellows; while at the other is the  audit room, which has some fifteenth-century tapestry and an iron-bound  chest once belonging to William of Wykeham. Beneath the Hall is \"Seventh  Chamber,\" an early schoolroom. Beyond are cloisters and more buildings,  and then the meadows which run down to the Itchen. The niches over the  second gateway contain figures of the Virgin, the Angel Gabriel, and  William of Wykeham; while the room below them is known as the election  chamber, where the annual election of scholars took place. In the inner  quadrangle the carvings over the windows should be noticed. \"Over the  hall and kitchen entrance are the psaltery and bagpipe; over kitchen  window, Excess, a head vomiting; opposite a Bursar as Frugality, with  his iron-bound money-chest; over the Masters' windows are the Pedagogue,  the Listless Scholar, etc.\" In the Chapel, which is 93 feet long by 30  wide and 57 high, the Perpendicular windows should be noticed, and in  particular, the large east window. The glass is declared by Mr Winston  to be, with the exception of a few pieces, modern, dating from 1824,  while the \"Jesse\" window is \"a very good copy of the old design.\" In the  vault Wykeham's wooden fan-tracery remains, but there has been much  change in the fittings of the chapel. The old screen has gone, and the  reredos is a restoration; the original stalls were removed as early as  1681. The tower had to be rebuilt in 1863, though the old stonework of  1470 was used where possible. At the north-east end are the sacristy and  muniment room, in which the college charters, etc., are kept. Among the  MSS., etc., kept here are certain Anglo-Saxon documents and charters of  Privileges from Richard II. to Charles II.; a table of Wykeham's  domestic expenses; a thirteenth century Vulgate in manuscript; a \"Briefe  description of the Newe Founde Lande of Virginia,\" by Sir Walter  Raleigh; and a pedigree of Henry VI., tracing his descent from Adam. The  chief relic of Wykeham is a gold ring with a large sapphire in it. The  Cloisters are 132 feet in length on each side, and the stone roofing is  supported by rafters of Irish oak. The ground enclosed by the Cloisters  was once used for the burial of the Fellows. Among the names cut in the  walls may be seen the name of \"Thos. Ken, 1646.\" In the square formed by  the cloisters is the Chantry Chapel, built in 1420, converted into the  library after Edward VI. had forbidden its use as a chapel, and now used  once more as a chapel for the junior scholars. A portrait of Wykeham  (the oldest on record) is shown in the east window, the glass of which  dates from 1470, and comes from Warden Thurbern's chantry in the larger  chapel. Behind the hall is \"School,\" a detached building erected in 1687  by the Warden, Nicholas. It is now used for glee-club concerts and like  events. The western wall has on it the often-quoted inscription: _Aut  Disce Aut Discede Manet Sors Tertia Caedi_. Modern additions to the  college buildings include a library in memory of Bishop Moberly,  formerly head-master; a gymnasium, fives courts and a racquet court, and  a new infirmary. One of the most curious properties of the College is  the old painting (probably sixteenth century) of the \"Trusty Servant,\"  the words being ascribed to Johnson, the head-master in 1560-1571.

Ltd., Photo._]    The remains of #Hyde Abbey# lie considerably to the north of the  cathedral, outside the old North Gate of the city, where it was erected  during the bishopric of William Giffard by Henry I. The buildings were  occupied in 1110 A.D. by the monks who were forced to leave Alfred's  \"New Minster,\" pulled down because of its too close neighbourhood to the  cathedral. Though the foundations of the abbey still exist, little is  left of the upper part except an arched gateway with hood-mouldings and  two royal corbel-heads. This gateway is in some walls that apparently  were once part of the out-buildings of the abbey. The body of Alfred the  Great was brought hither in 1110, and must still be here, though all  traces of the tomb have now vanished utterly. The institution, which was  a very wealthy one, was not always on good terms with the cathedral  authorities, of whom it was, of course, independent. A record is kept of  a dispute between Cardinal Beaufort and the Abbot of Hyde. In the  dissolution of the monasteries under Henry VIII. it was impossible that  the riches of Hyde Abbey could escape, and in 1538 pillage and violation  overtook it. The Royal Commissioners wrote that they intended \"to sweep  away all the rotten bones that be called relices, which we may not omit,  lest it should be thought that we came more for the treasure than for  avoiding the abominations of idolatry.\" Probably Thomas Cromwell, to  whom they wrote, understood how far the two motives influenced them and  the king. The monastic buildings did not altogether disappear until  close on the end of last century, when the materials were devoted to  other purposes.    [Illustration: ST CROSS FROM THE QUADRANGLE. _Photochrom Co. Ltd., Photo._]    The #Hospital of St Cross#, the oldest almshouse in England, lies one  mile to the south of the town on the Southampton Road, and may be  reached from Winchester across the fields for part of the way. Situated  in the hamlet of Sparkford, it was founded originally by Bishop Henry de  Blois in 1136, on the site of a small monastery destroyed by the Danes.  The founder's wish was to give refuge to \"thirteen poor men, feeble and  so reduced in strength that they can hardly or with difficulty support  themselves with another's aid\"; while a meal was daily to be provided  for another hundred poor men. The Knights Hospitallers, in the person of  their Master, Raymund, were in 1151 A.D. put in charge of the  foundation. They agreed so ill, however, with the bishops of the  neighbouring cathedral that, about 1200, the Pope appointed a commission  which transferred to the bishops the right of choosing the master. The  new arrangement did not work well, for a little more than a century and  a half afterwards the master was found to be robbing his charge to such  an extent that the scandal was intolerable. William of Wykeham turning  his attention to the matter, a Papal Bull was procured ordering the use  of the revenues for the benefit of the poor. The next bishop, Cardinal  Beaufort, added to the buildings by the foundation of the \"Almshouse of  Noble Poverty,\" for the maintenance of two priests, thirty-five  brethren, and three sisters. The master of the hospital was to be at its  head, otherwise the institutions were to be distinct; but by the middle  of the sixteenth century the hospital had practically absorbed the  almshouse. At the end of the next century, in 1696, the master and  brethren of the hospital made a public repudiation of their duties, and  commenced either to destroy the buildings or to convert them to other  than their original uses; and shortly after the southern side of  Beaufort's quadrangle was pulled down. The abuses were rectified in the  middle of the present century, and now a body of trustees, under the  control of the Charity Commissioners, has the management of the two  institutions. All the endowments of the hospital are still intact.    [Illustration: CHURCH OF ST CROSS: VIEW OF EAST END FROM NAVE.  _Photochrom Co. Ltd., Photo._]    [Illustration: COUNTY HALL, WITH ROUND TABLE.
