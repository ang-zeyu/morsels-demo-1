[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16965"],[0,"Queen Victoria (#20)"],[1," she must  consider as a failure in sincerity towards the Crown, and justly to  be visited by the exercise of her Constitutional right of dismissing  that Minister. She expects to be kept informed of what passes between  him and the Foreign Ministers, before important decisions are taken,  based upon that intercourse; to receive the Foreign dispatches in  good time and to have the drafts for her approval sent to her in  sufficient time to make herself acquainted with their contents  before they must be sent off. The Queen thinks it best that Lord John  Russell should show this letter to Lord Palmerston.\"    More than once the alteration of a dispatch by the Queen prevented  what might easily have plunged this country into a disastrous war.    After the Mutiny in India a proclamation was issued to the native  races, and the Queen insisted upon alterations which would clearly  show that their religious beliefs should in no way be interfered with,  thus preventing a fresh mutiny.    On rare occasions her indignation got the better of her--once,  notably, when, owing to careless delay on the part of the Ministry,  General Gordon perished at Khartoum, a rescue party failing to reach  him in time. In a letter to his sisters she spoke of this as \"a stain  left upon England,\" and as a wrong which she felt very keenly.    Her style of writing was as simple as possible, yet she always said  the right thing at the right moment, and her letters of sympathy or  congratulation were models of their kind and never failed in their  effect.    Few, if any, reigns in history have been so blameless as hers, and  her domestic life was perfect in its harmony and the devotion of the  members of her family to one another. She possessed the 'eye of the  mistress' for every detail, however small, which concerned  housekeeping matters, and though her style of entertaining was  naturally often magnificent, everything was paid for punctually.    After the visits of King Louis Philippe and the Emperor Nicholas of  Russia, Sir Robert Peel acknowledged that \"Her Majesty was able to  meet every charge and to give a reception to the Sovereigns which  struck every one by its magnificence without adding one tittle to  the burdens of the country. I am not required by Her Majesty to press  for the extra expenditure of one single shilling on account of these  unforeseen causes of increased expenditure. I think that to state  this is only due to the personal credit of Her Majesty, who insists  upon it that there shall be every magnificence required by her  station, but without incurring one single debt.\"    When one remembers that the Queen had to superintend the household  arrangements of Buckingham Palace, Balmoral Castle, Osborne, and  Windsor, and that the latter alone gave employment, in one way and  another, to two thousand people, it can be realized that this was  a tremendous undertaking in itself. Method and neatness, first  instituted by the Prince Consort, were always insisted upon in place  of the disorder and waste which had reigned supreme before the Queen  became head of the household.    [Illustration: THE VICTORIA AND ALBERT MUSEUM, SOUTH KENSINGTON]    Before her life was saddened by the untimely loss of her husband the  Queen was the leader of English society, and her influence was, as  may be imagined, thoroughly wholesome and good. She was all her life  a deeply religious woman, and though her observance of Sunday was  strict, she never allowed it to become a day of penance. Her religion  was 'humane'--indeed, her intense sympathy with all sorrow and  suffering was one of her supreme virtues, and her early upbringing  made her dislike all elaborate forms of ceremony during the service.  When in the Highlands she always attended the simple little  Presbyterian church, where the congregation was, for the most part,  made up of the inhabitants of the neighbourhood.    It is this simplicity and 'homeliness' of the Queen which were so  often misunderstood by those who could not realize how much she was  at one with her people. The Queen was never more happy than when she  was visiting some poor sufferer and comforting those in sorrow. Her  memory for the little events which made up the lives and happiness  of those far below her in social rank was amazing. She was a great  and a truly democratic Queen. She gave the greater portion of her  Jubilee present toward a fund to establish institutions to provide  nurses for the sick poor.    During the latter years of her reign, when she was less and less to  be seen at public functions and ceremonies, many complaints were made  about her reputed neglect of royal duties. She felt the injustice  of such statements very keenly and with good reason. No allowances  were made for her poor health, for her years, for the family losses  which left her every year more and more a lonely woman. Her duties,  ever increasing in number and extent, left her no time, even if she  had possessed the inclination, to take part in pomp and ceremony.    The outburst of loyalty and affection on the occasion of her two  Jubilee celebrations proved that she still reigned supreme in the  nation's heart.    The Queen was not only a great monarch, but also a great statesman.  Consider for a moment the many and bewildering changes which took  place in her own and other countries during her reign. Our country  was almost continually at war in some portion of the globe. The  British Army fought side by side with the French against Russia in  the Crimea, and against the rebels in the Indian Mutiny; two Boer  wars were fought in South Africa in 1881, and 1899-1902. There were  also lesser wars in China, Afghanistan, Abyssinia, Zululand and  Egypt.    The Queen lived to see France change from a Monarchy to a Republic;  to see Germany beat France to her knees and become a united Empire,  thanks to the foresight of her great statesman Bismarck, and her  great general von Moltke. During the same year (1870) the Italian  army entered Rome, as soon as the French garrison had been withdrawn,  and Italy became a united country under King Victor Emmanuel.    Despite the fact that the map of Europe was continually changing,  England managed to keep clear of international strife, and this was  in no small degree due to the personal influence of the Queen.    The England of her early years would be an absolutely foreign country  to us, if by some magic touch we were to be transplanted back down  the line of years. It was different in thought, feeling, and outlook.  The extraordinary changes in the modes of travelling, by means of  which numbers of people who had never even thought of any other  country beside their own, were enabled to visit other lands, broke  down, bit by bit, the barrier between the Continent and ourselves.  England became less of an insular and more of a continental power.    The social changes were, as has been shown, all for good. Education  became not the privilege of the few but the right of all who wished  for it. Step by step the people gained in power and in the right to  govern themselves. The idea of citizenship, of a patriotism which  extended beyond the narrow limits of these isles, slowly took root  and blossomed. Through all these manifold changes the Queen reigned,  ever alert, and even in her last years taking the keenest interest  in the growth of her mighty kingdom.    \"The use of the Queen in a dignified capacity is incalculable,\"  declared Walter Bagehot in his famous essay on _The English  Constitution_. He continues: \"Without her in England, the present  English Government would fail and pass away.\" It is interesting to  read the reasons which such a clear and distinguished thinker gives  to explain the hold which the Monarchy retains upon the English  nation as a whole.    Firstly: there is the Family, of which the Queen is the head; the  Nation looks upon her as its mother, witness its enthusiasm at the  marriage of the Prince of Wales.    Secondly: The Monarchy strengthens the Government with the strength  of religion. It is the duty of a loyal citizen to obey his Queen;  the oath of allegiance is no empty form. The Queen from her very  position acts as a symbol of unity.    Thirdly: The Queen is the head of our society; she represents England  in the eyes of foreign nations.    Fourthly: The Monarchy is the head of our morality. The example of  Queen Victoria's simple life has not been lost upon the nation. It  is now quite a natural thing to expect and to find the domestic  virtues personified in the ruling monarch, and this in spite of the  fact that history has shown what temptations lie in the way of those  possessed of the highest power in the state.    Shakespeare voiced the feeling of the people for the kingship in the  words which he put into the mouth of Henry V:        Upon the king! let us our lives, our souls,      Our debts, our careful wives,      Our children, and our sins, lay on the king:      We must bear all.      O hard condition! twin-born with greatness,      Subject to the breath of every fool, whose sense      No more can feel but his own wringing!      What infinite heart's ease must kings neglect,      That private men enjoy?      And what have kings that privates have not too,      Save ceremony, save general ceremony?    And lastly, the actual Government of the country may change but the  Monarch remains, subject to no changes of Parliament, above and aloof  from the strife of political parties, the steadying influence in  times of transition.    The Sovereign has three rights: \"The right to be consulted, the right  to encourage, the right to warn.\" A comparison of the reigns of the  four Georges with the reign of Queen Victoria shows that it was only  during the latter's reign that the duties of the constitutional  monarch were well and conscientiously performed.

There are also fruits, such as the apple, pear, nut, etc.; so  that the bill of fare of prehistoric man was by no means contemptible.  He had fish, game, beef, mutton, pork, bread, and fruit, besides a  plentiful supply of water from the lake at his door. He was acquainted  with the potter's art, and manufactured earthen vessels of various  kinds. He seems to have produced two kinds--a coarser and a finer; the  former made from clay mixed with a quantity of grains of stone, and  the latter of washed loam. These he ornamented in an elementary  fashion with certain lines and marks. Some of the vessels he used have  been found with a burnt crust of the porridge which he had been making  adhering. As to his clothes, these were probably formed in great part  from the skins of wild or domestic animals, but he also used fabrics  made from flax, which he had learned to weave, as remains of cloth,  twine, rope, etc., are not infrequently found in his dwellings.    One prominent feature in the history of these lake dwellers is their  gradual advance in the arts of civilization. While the main features  of their settlements remain very much the same during the whole period  of their residence, there is a gradual improvement in the details; the  settlements become larger, and the implements, etc., better finished.  And this is especially observable in the change of material which the  dweller uses. In the earlier stages of his existence stone is the  predominant feature, all his knives, saws, chisels, axes, etc., are  made from this substance; but as time rolls on, one or two implements  are found made of bronze, which is a mixture of tin and copper, and  requires for its production a certain amount of knowledge and  mechanical skill. Gradually the number of bronze implements increases  until eventually stone is superseded altogether, and improved forms of  weapons of war make their appearance, and his work has a more finished  look, arising from his improved implements. Whether the manufacture of  bronze was an original discovery of his own, or whether it was an  importation from some more advanced race, is not certainly known; but  as he undoubtedly had intercourse with the East, it is probable that  the first bronze was imported, and that afterward he discovered the  way to manufacture it himself. However this may be, it seems evident  that the introduction of this material greatly aided his development.  As stone gave place to bronze, so in the course of time this latter  gave place to iron, probably introduced in the same manner some  considerable time before the dawn of history; and this metal held its  place until these habitations were finally abandoned.    With regard to the religion of these lake dwellers, if they had any,  nothing is known. From some curious objects formed somewhat like the  crescent of the moon, which are found in considerable numbers, it has  been supposed that they worshiped that body; but there seems to be  really no evidence for this supposition, and these objects may only  have been ornaments, or perhaps charms, fixed above the doors of their  huts something after the manner of the horse shoe nailed over the door  in modern times to keep away evil spirits. So far as can be inferred  from the remains that have been examined, the same race seems to have  inhabited these dwellings from their commencement to their end. There  is no appearance of invasion from without; all seems continuous.  Probably his race came in early time from the East, and were a  pastoral people, with flocks, herds, and domestic animals, and built  their peculiar habitations to protect themselves from human enemies.  Certainly the arrangements were well fitted for the purpose in those  days, when the club and the spear were almost the only weapons of  offense. Dr. Keller, who has investigated this subject with great  care, is of the opinion that these lake dwellers were a branch of the  great Celtic race.           *       *       *       *       *    [New England Farmer.]          HOW TO RAISE TURKEYS.      The best feed for young turkeys and ducks is yelks of hard-boiled  eggs, and after they are several days old the white may be added.  Continue this for two or three weeks, occasionally chopping onions  fine and sometimes sprinkling the boiled eggs with black pepper; then  give rice, a teacupful with enough milk to just cover it, and boil  slowly until the milk is evaporated. Put in enough more to cover the  rice again, so that when boiled down the second time it will be soft  if pressed between the fingers. Milk must not be used too freely, as  it will get too soft and the grains will adhere together. Stir  frequently when boiling. Do not use water with the rice, as it forms a  paste and the chicks cannot swallow it. In cold, damp weather, a half  teaspoonful of Cayenne pepper in a pint of flour, with lard enough to  make it stick together, will protect them from diarrhea. This amount  of food is sufficient for two meals for seventy-five chicks. Give all  food in shallow tin pans. Water and boiled milk, with a little lime  water in each occasionally, is the best drink until the chicks are two  or three months old, when loppered and buttermilk may take the place  of the boiled milk. Turkeys like best to roost on trees, and in their  place artificial roots may be made by planting long forked locust  poles and laying others across the forks.--_American Agriculturist._      HOW TO RAISE TURKEYS.    Keep the turkey hens tame by feeding them close to the house. Have two  or three barrels in sheltered corners containing plenty of straw or  leaves for them to lay in. Gather the eggs every evening, as turkey  eggs are very easily chilled. Keep the eggs in a woolen cloth on end  and turn them every three days. Set the first seven eggs under a  chicken hen, as they get too old before the turkey hen will go to  sitting. Make a board pen ten or twelve feet square and twelve or  fourteen inches high. Put a coop in it and put your hen and turkeys in  it. Feed the hen with corn and the turkeys soaked wheat bread (corn  meal will kill them), until they are a week old (I feed five or six  times a day). Then feed wheat until they are big enough to eat corn.  Give plenty of fresh water in a shallow vessel. Keep the mother in  the pen until they are large enough to fly over the top of the boards.  Let them out awhile about the middle of the day. Shut them in at  night. A turkey hen does not like to be shut up, but have a good big  coop for her and she will go in. Don't let the little turkeys get  their backs wet until they are feathered. The turkey hen will sit down  when night comes just where she happens to be, but if you drive her  home a few times she will come herself after that. Always feed them  when they come home, no matter if they are full of \"hoppers.\" Have  your No. 2 pen in the orchard under an apple tree where it is shady.  Have the turkey hen's pen close to the chicken hen's pen, so that when  the chicken hen weans her turkeys, they will soon learn to go with the  turkey hen. Give them a dose of black pepper in their feed every cold  rain. And never, no never, get excited and in a hurry while working  with turkeys if you don't want them to get wild and fly all over the  plantation. Three or four weeks before selling, feed all the corn they  will eat.      FOOD HINTS.    Restrain your desire to count your young turkeys, and let them alone  for twenty-four hours after they get into this world. Remove them to a  clean, airy, roomy coop, and give them boiled eggs, stale wheat bread  crumbs just moistened with milk or water, \"Dutch\" cheese, or a mixture  of all these.    For the first two weeks feed entirely with the eggs, bread, curds,  cooked rice and cooked oatmeal. About the third week commence feeding  cooked cornmeal; and from that on they may have any cooked food that  would be suitable for chickens of the same age. Season all food  slightly with salt and pepper, and twice a week add a level  tablespoonful of bone meal to a pint of feed. Never feed any sour food  or sloppy food of any kind, except sour milk, and never feed any  uncooked food of any kind until after they have thrown out the red on  their heads. Feed often, five or six times a day, until after they are  three months old; then, if insects are numerous, you may gradually  reduce the number of meals per day to three or even two.    After they are three months old they may be given wheat, cracked corn,  etc., but not whole corn until they are five months old. Keep the  coops dry and clean, and the turkeys out of the dew and rain until  they are fully feathered, and have thrown out the red. Dampness and  filth will kill young turkeys as surely as a dose of poison. For the  first few days confine the poults to the limits of the coop and safety  run; then, if all appear strong and well, give the mother hen and her  brood liberty on pleasant days after the dew is off.    If they get caught out in a shower, get them to shelter as soon as  possible; and if they are chilled take them to the house and  thoroughly dry and warm them. See that the little turkeys come home  every night. The turkey mother must, for the first few nights, be  hunted up and driven home. After they are three months old, turkeys  are quite hardy, and may be allowed range at all times. If turkeys  that are well cared for, and have always seemed all right, show signs  of drooping when about six weeks or two months old, give Douglas  mixture in the drink or food, and add a little cooked meat to the food  once a day.--_The Practical Farmer._      ABOUT SITTING.    For an ordinary place, select from a good breed (I prefer the bronze)  a large gobbler and two or three hens. As soon as the warm weather  comes, place about the barn in sheltered places two or three barrels  on their sides, and in them make nice nests. In these the hens will  lay. Gather the eggs every day, keeping them in"]]]
