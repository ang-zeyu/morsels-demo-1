He was named in meeting; the  name tossed from roller to roller. Disko's infallible judgments, Long  Jack's market-boat that he had sold years ago, Dan's sweetheart (oh,  but Dan was an angry boy!), Penn's bad luck with dory-anchors,  Salters's views on manure, Manuel's little slips from virtue ashore,  and Harvey's ladylike handling of the oar--all were laid before the  public; and as the fog fell around them in silvery sheets beneath the  sun, the voices sounded like a bench of invisible judges pronouncing  sentence.    The dories roved and fished and squabbled till a swell underran the  sea. Then they drew more apart to save their sides, and some one called  that if the swell continued the Virgin would break. A reckless Galway  man with his nephew denied this, hauled up anchor, and rowed over the  very rock itself. Many voices called them to come away, while others  dared them to hold on. As the smooth-backed rollers passed to the  south-ward, they hove the dory high and high into the mist, and dropped  her in ugly, sucking, dimpled water, where she spun round her anchor,  within a foot or two of the hidden rock. It was playing with death for  mere bravado; and the boats looked on in uneasy silence till Long Jack  rowed up behind his countrymen and quietly cut their roding.    \"Can't ye hear ut knockin'?\" he cried. \"Pull for your miserable lives!  Pull!\"    The men swore and tried to argue as the boat drifted; but the next  swell checked a little, like a man tripping on a carpet. There was a  deep sob and a gathering roar, and the Virgin flung up a couple of  acres of foaming water, white, furious, and ghastly over the shoal sea.  Then all the boats greatly applauded Long Jack, and the Galway men held  their tongue.    \"Ain't it elegant?\" said Dan, bobbing like a young seal at home.  \"She'll break about once every ha'af hour now, 'less the swell piles up  good. What's her reg'lar time when she's at work, Tom Platt?\"    \"Once ivry fifteen minutes, to the tick. Harve, you've seen the  greatest thing on the Banks; an' but for Long Jack you'd seen some dead  men too.\"    There came a sound of merriment where the fog lay thicker and the  schooners were ringing their bells. A big bark nosed cautiously out of  the mist, and was received with shouts and cries of, \"Come along,  darlin',\" from the Irishry.    \"Another Frenchman?\" said Harvey.    \"Hain't you eyes? She's a Baltimore boat; goin' in fear an' tremblin',\"  said Dan. \"We'll guy the very sticks out of her. 'Guess it's the fust  time her skipper ever met up with the Fleet this way.\"    She was a black, buxom, eight-hundred-ton craft. Her mainsail was  looped up, and her topsail flapped undecidedly in what little wind was  moving. Now a bark is feminine beyond all other daughters of the sea,  and this tall, hesitating creature, with her white and gilt figurehead,  looked just like a bewildered woman half lifting her skirts to cross a  muddy street under the jeers of bad little boys. That was very much her  situation. She knew she was somewhere in the neighbourhood of the  Virgin, had caught the roar of it, and was, therefore, asking her way.  This is a small part of what she heard from the dancing dories:    \"The Virgin? Fwhat are you talk in' of'? This is Le Have on a Sunday  mornin'. Go home an' sober up.\"    \"Go home, ye tarrapin! Go home an' tell 'em we're comin'.\"    Half a dozen voices together, in a most tuneful chorus, as her stern  went down with a roll and a bubble into the troughs:  \"Thay-aah--she--strikes!\"    \"Hard up! Hard up fer your life! You're on top of her now.\"    \"Daown! Hard daown! Let go everything!\"    \"All hands to the pumps!\"    \"Daown jib an' pole her!\"    Here the skipper lost his temper and said things. Instantly fishing was  suspended to answer him, and he heard many curious facts about his boat  and her next port of call. They asked him if he were insured; and  whence he had stolen his anchor, because, they said, it belonged to the  Carrie Pitman; they called his boat a mud-scow, and accused him of  dumping garbage to frighten the fish; they offered to tow him and  charge it to his wife; and one audacious youth slipped almost under the  counter, smacked it with his open palm, and yelled: \"Gid up, Buck!\"    The cook emptied a pan of ashes on him, and he replied with cod-heads.  The bark's crew fired small coal from the galley, and the dories  threatened to come aboard and \"razee\" her. They would have warned her  at once had she been in real peril; but, seeing her well clear of the  Virgin, they made the most of their chances. The fun was spoilt when  the rock spoke again, a half-mile to windward, and the tormented bark  set everything that would draw and went her ways; but the dories felt  that the honours lay with them.    All that night the Virgin roared hoarsely and next morning, over an  angry, white-headed sea, Harvey saw the Fleet with flickering masts  waiting for a lead. Not a dory was hove out till ten o'clock, when the  two Jeraulds of the 'Day's Eye', imagining a lull which did not exist,  set the example. In a minute half the boats were out and bobbing in the  cockly swells, but Troop kept the \"We're Heres\" at work dressing-down.  He saw no sense in \"dares\"; and as the storm grew that evening they had  the pleasure of receiving wet strangers only too glad to make any  refuge in the gale. The boys stood by the dory-tackles with lanterns,  the men ready to haul, one eye cocked for the sweeping wave that would  make them drop everything and hold on for the dear life. Out of the  dark would come a yell of \"Dory, dory!\" They would hook up and haul in  a drenched man and a half-sunk boat, till their decks were littered  down with nests of dories and the bunks were full. Five times in their  watch did Harvey, with Dan, jump at the foregaff where it lay lashed on  the boom, and cling with arms, legs, and teeth to rope and spar and  sodden canvas as a big wave filled the decks. One dory was smashed to  pieces, and the sea pitched the man head first on to the decks, cutting  his forehead open; and about dawn, when the racing seas glimmered white  all along their cold edges, another man, blue and ghastly, crawled in  with a broken hand, asking news of his brother. Seven extra mouths sat  down to breakfast: a Swede; a Chatham skipper; a boy from Hancock,  Maine; one Duxbury, and three Provincetown men.    There was a general sorting out among the Fleet next day; and though no  one said anything, all ate with better appetites when boat after boat  reported full crews aboard. Only a couple of Portuguese and an old man  from Gloucester were drowned, but many were cut or bruised; and two  schooners had parted their tackle and been blown to the southward,  three days' sail. A man died on a Frenchman--it was the same bark that  had traded tobacco with the \"We're Heres\". She slipped away quite  quietly one wet, white morning, moved to a patch of deep water, her  sails all hanging anyhow, and Harvey saw the funeral through Disko's  spy-glass. It was only an oblong bundle slid overside. They did not  seem to have any form of service, but in the night, at anchor, Harvey  heard them across the star-powdered black water, singing something that  sounded like a hymn. It went to a very slow tune.         La brigantine       Qui va tourner,       Roule et s'incline       Pour m'entrainer.       Oh, Vierge Marie,       Pour moi priez Dieu!       Adieu, patrie;       Qu√©bec, adieu!    Tom Platt visited her, because, he said, the dead man was his brother  as a Freemason. It came out that a wave had doubled the poor fellow  over the heel of the bowsprit and broken his back. The news spread like  a flash, for, contrary to general custom, the Frenchman held an auction  of the dead man's kit,--he had no friends at St. Malo or Miquelon,--and  everything was spread out on the top of the house, from his red knitted  cap to the leather belt with the sheath-knife at the back. Dan and  Harvey were out on twenty-fathom water in the Hattie S., and naturally  rowed over to join the crowd. It was a long pull, and they stayed some  little time while Dan bought the knife, which had a curious brass  handle. When they dropped overside and pushed off into a drizzle of  rain and a lop of sea, it occurred to them that they might get into  trouble for neglecting the lines. \"Guess 'twon't hurt us any to be  warmed up,\" said Dan, shivering under his oilskins, and they rowed on  into the heart of a white fog, which, as usual, dropped on them without  warning.    \"There's too much blame tide hereabouts to trust to your instinks,\" he  said. \"Heave over the anchor, Harve, and we'll fish a piece till the  thing lifts. Bend on your biggest lead. Three pound ain't any too much  in this water. See how she's tightened on her rodin' already.\"    There was quite a little bubble at the bows, where some irresponsible  Bank current held the dory full stretch on her rope; but they could not  see a boat's length in any direction. Harvey turned up his collar and  bunched himself over his reel with the air of a wearied navigator. Fog  had no special terrors for him now. They fished awhile in silence, and  found the cod struck on well. Then Dan drew the sheath-knife and tested  the edge of it on the gunwale.    \"That's a daisy,\" said Harvey. \"How did you get it so cheap?\"    \"On account o' their blame Cath'lic superstitions,\" said Dan, jabbing  with the bright blade. \"They don't fancy takin' iron frum off of a dead  man, so to speak. 'See them Arichat Frenchmen step back when I bid?\"    \"But an auction ain't taking anything off a dead man. It's business.\"    \"We know it ain't, but there's no goin' in the teeth o' superstition.  That's one o' the advantages o' livin' in a progressive country.\" And  Dan began whistling:    \"Oh, Double Thatcher, how are you? Now Eastern Point comes inter view.  The girls an' boys we soon shall see, At anchor off"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22257"],[0,"Bulgaria (#20)"],[1,"almost in the centre of  Bulgaria; the latter near to the Turkish border.    The valleys and plains of Bulgaria are watered by tributaries of the  Danube, by tributaries of the Maritza and the Struma flowing into the  Aegean Sea, and by some small streams flowing directly into the Black  Sea. The soil of the plains and the tableland is generally good, and 70  per cent of it is suitable for cultivation. In the mountains there are a  few small lakes and many deep gorges and noble peaks, offering to the  traveller the attraction of scenery wilder than that of the Alps.    For the tourist with an autumn or a spring month to spare, I could  imagine no more interesting journey than to cross on horseback or with  an ox-wagon the Rhodopes or the Balkans. (In the summer such a tour  would be less pleasant because of the heat of the plains and the  prevalence of flies.) But in the autumn, of all seasons, the Balkan  Peninsula has supreme charms. The climate then is perfect, usually fine,  with warm clear days and cold nights. The atmosphere is full of light  and colour. Sunset as seen from the lower foothills of the Balkans is a  rare pageant of glowing colour. These foothills are covered with oak  scrub, which with the first frosts of autumn puts on burning robes of  red and gold. As the sun goes down to rest in the western sky, hung with  banners of the same red and gold, the twilight steals up first as a pink  radiance then as a deep purple glow. Light melts into light--softly,  insensibly--the display in the sky and on the hill-sides gradually  passing from one colour to another, until at last night and darkness  come to end the long-drawn-out procession of colour.    These wild mountains abound in game which has been driven from the tamer  parts of Europe. There are bears, wolves, jackals, wild boars, deer,  chamois; and all kinds of birds, such as eagles, falcons, bustards, wild  geese, pheasants, partridges, woodcock, snipe, and moorhen. For the  sportsman the Balkan Peninsula is almost the only tract left in Europe  offering really wild game. King Ferdinand, who recognises the tourist  possibilities of his country, has lately encouraged the stocking of the  Rhodope streams with trout, to offer another attraction to the visitor.    [Illustration: GUARDING THE FLOCKS AND HERDS]    To King Ferdinand's initiative also is due in a great measure the  movement to develop the spas of Bulgaria. The mountains abound in  medicinal springs of various kinds. Some of the most important have been  used in a primitive fashion since the Roman times, and under the Turkish  rule. Recently, the mining section of the Ministry of Commerce and  Agriculture has succeeded in developing the mineral springs at Sliven,  Banki, Varshetz, and Meritchleri. Modern health-resorts have been built  at Banki, Varshetz, Hissar, and Meritchleri. There are, all in all, more  than 200 hot and mineral springs in Bulgaria in some eighty different  places. In the department of Sofia there are twenty-three, the hottest  of which is Dolnia Bania. The town of Sofia itself possesses very good  hot springs. The municipality has almost completed the building of  public baths which will cost L60,000.    Though it is far from the mind of the Bulgarian people to aim at making  their country another playground for the west of Europe, there is no  doubt at all but that in the future Bulgaria will attract, yearly,  thousands of tourists--in the winter for snow-sports; in the spring and  autumn for the scenery, the sport, the medicinal baths. At the present  time there is practically no tourist traffic. Travellers wishing to  explore early a new country may be confident of getting in the capital,  Sofia, excellent hotel accommodation, and in the chief towns, such as  Stara Zagora and Philippopolis, decent and clean accommodation. But to  see Bulgaria properly it is necessary to take to horseback or wagon. At  the capital it is possible to engage guides who speak English, and to  hire horses or oxen for transport at an astonishingly cheap rate. The  horse-carts of the country are springless and not too comfortable. The  ox-wagons, also springless, are quite comfortable, as the oxen move  along smoothly and without jerking. I have slept quite soundly in a  Bulgarian ox-wagon as it crawled over roadless country at night.    Mainly an agricultural country, Bulgaria grows wheat, maize, barley,  rye, oats, millet, spelt, rice (around Philippopolis), potatoes, grapes,  tobacco, mulberries (there is a silk industry), and roses. This  cultivation of roses for the production of attar of roses is an almost  exclusively Bulgarian industry. Most of the genuine attar of roses  produced in the world comes from Bulgaria. The production is a  Government monopoly, and I believe that if care is taken to secure  flasks of attar with the Government seal the purchaser may be sure of  getting the genuine article. Otherwise, as likely as not, oil of  geraniums is substituted for the attar of roses, or is used as an  adulterant. The rose valleys are grouped around Stara Zagora, and a  visit to the farms in the flowering season--late spring--should be an  incident of a Balkan tour.    The exports of Bulgaria are chiefly cereals, and the imports  manufactured goods of all kinds. But by a system of high Protection and  bonuses efforts are being made to establish manufacturing industries in  the country. The oldest Bulgarian industry is weaving, which has existed  from ancient times as a home industry. The wool of the country was  worked up into cloths, carpets, braids, serges, etc., which were in  request throughout the Ottoman Empire. The most important weaving  centres are Pirdop, Panaguiourichte, Karlovo, Sopot, Koprivchtitza,  Klissoura, Kalofer, Gabrovo, Trevna, Sliven, Kotel, and Samokov. Under  Turkish rule, these towns supplied cloth to the Imperial army. Bulgarian  cloths were then held in esteem, and there was a demand for them in  Greece and in Asia Minor. In 1880 some capitalists decided to start  modern workshops. The example was given by the towns of Gabrovo and  Sliven, where there are now large factories, organised on modern  principles. There are as many as twenty-six factories in other towns,  among others, at Samokov and Kazanlik. Bulgaria holds the first place  for weaving in the Balkan Peninsula. Lately, in addition to the making  of woollens, cotton-spinning has been introduced, and there are several  mills now working.    So pronounced has been the growth of industrialism in Bulgaria that  labour legislation has been already found necessary. There are laws  making regulations for the employment of apprentices, for the maximum  number of hours in the working day, and the age of apprentices. The law  of 1905 regulating the work of women and children lays down conditions  for the employment of children under fifteen, and for women of all ages,  occupied in factories, mines, quarries, workshops, and other industrial  undertakings. Children of either sex who have not attained the age of  twelve years must not be employed in factories, workshops, at  pit-mouths, in quarries, or sewers. However, children under twelve, but  in no case under ten, may be employed in certain undertakings. Children  under fifteen and women under twenty-one cannot be employed in the  subterranean parts of mines or quarries. The working day for children is  limited to eight hours; night-work is forbidden to women, and to  children under fifteen. On Sundays all industrial establishments must  close.    In addition to these laws protecting workers there are laws protecting  employers against foreign competition and granting them various bonuses.  The general privileges, allowed to all industrial enterprises, are:    The use of water-power, without payment, where this is not on a private  property;    Exemption from customs duties for such machines and parts of machines,  tools, and accessories, needful for the installation of enterprise, as  are not made in the Principality;    Exemption from customs duties for such building materials as are not  found or made in the country;    Exemption from customs duties for raw material, when it is imported in  order to be exported again, after having been worked up or finished off;    A free grant of land belonging to the State, the province, or parish,  for the installation of the factory;    Machinery, tools, coal, benzine, etc., for the factories are carried by  the State railways at a rate 35 per cent below the lowest usual charge  for those commodities. The law compels all public institutions to buy  from native sources, even if native commodities should be as much as 15  per cent dearer than similar articles manufactured abroad.    Some industries have in addition special privileges allowed to them,  such as exemptions from land taxation, monopoly privileges in certain  districts, cheap coal from the State mines, etc. The Bulgarian national  system aims at supplementing the agricultural resources of the country  with industrial enterprises in every possible way. But agriculture is  not neglected by the Government, and a special department exists to  encourage improvement in cultivation and cattle-raising. This department  has set up departmental councils, which distribute seeds every year.  They make considerable grants to improve the breed of cattle. They also  encourage progress in the farmers by organising competitions for  poultry-rearing, fruit-growing, etc. Scholarships have been granted to  a number of young men who wish to take up farming, so as to allow them  to study methods in foreign agricultural schools.    Further, there is an agricultural bank which, curiously enough, dates  back from the Turkish days. In 1863, Midhat Pasha, Governor of the  Danubian Vilayet (_i.e._ Bulgaria), prepared a scheme for the creation  of \"urban\" banks, which were intended to assist the rural population.  The scheme having been approved by the Turkish Government,"]]]
