Simmer  slowly until tender and then drain and season with      One small onion, minced fine,    Two tablespoons of dried parsley,    One teaspoon of salt,    One-half teaspoon of white pepper.    Place in a casserole dish and cover with one and a half cups of cream  sauce. Sprinkle with fine bread crumbs and one tablespoon of finely  grated cheese. Bake for twenty minutes in the oven. This dish replaces  meat for luncheon.          SQUASH      SQUASH AU GRATIN    Wash, pare and cut the squash into pieces, discarding the seeds. Steam  until tender and then drain well and stand on the back of the range to  dry. Now rub the pulp through a sieve. Measure and add to each cup of  pulp      One well-beaten egg,    Two tablespoons of butter,    One teaspoon of salt,    One-half teaspoon of paprika,    Two tablespoons of milk,    One tablespoon of finely minced parsley.    Pour into well-greased baking dish and cover with fine bread crumbs  and two tablespoons of grated cheese. Bake in a slow oven for twenty  minutes.      SQUASH CAKES    Wash and cut the squash into pieces and then cook until tender in  boiling water, then drain and rub pulp through sieve. Now measure and  place in a bowl      One cup of prepared squash,    One well-beaten egg,    One tablespoon of shortening,    One-half cup of milk,    One and one-half cups of flour,    Two tablespoons of baking powder,    One-half teaspoon of salt,    One-half teaspoon of paprika,    One tablespoon of minced parsley.    Beat to mix and then bake as if for griddle cakes on a hot griddle.  Serve with maple syrup.      SQUASH SOUFFLE      One cup of prepared squash pulp,    One tablespoon of grated onion,    Two tablespoons of finely minced parsley,    One tablespoon of melted butter,    Two teaspoons of salt,    One teaspoon of paprika,    One cup of very thick cream sauce,    Yolks of two eggs.    Beat to blend and then carefully fold in the stiffly beaten whites of  two eggs. Pour into well-greased individual custard cups and set in  a pan of warm water. Bake slowly in a moderate oven until firm in the  centre, usually about twenty minutes. Let stand about three minutes  after removing from the oven and then turn on a slice of toast and  cover with cheese sauce and serve.      SQUASH ITALIENNE      One and one-half cups of prepared squash pulp,    One and one-half teaspoons of salt,    One teaspoon of paprika,    Two tablespoons of finely minced parsley,    Two tablespoons of finely minced onions.    Mix thoroughly and then dice two ounces of salt pork. Brown the salt  pork nicely and then drain off about one-half of the fat in the pan.  Turn the squash mixture on the salt pork and heat and serve.      SQUASH PIE    Wash and then cut the squash into pieces and then boil until tender  and drain; rub the pulp through sieve. Measure, and to each cup add      One cup of sugar,    Two tablespoons of melted butter,    Two well-beaten eggs,    One cup of milk,    One-half teaspoon of nutmeg.    Beat well to mix and then pour in a pie tin which has been lined with  plain pastry. Sprinkle one-half cup of currants over the top and bake  for one-half hour in a slow oven.      BAKED SQUASH    Cut a slice from the top of the squash and remove the seeds and the  string fibre. Now add      One tablespoon of melted butter,    One-half teaspoon of salt,    One-half teaspoon of paprika.    Cover closely with a lid and then bake in a slow oven until the pulp  is tender, usually about thirty minutes. Remove the lip and scoop  out the pulp with a spoon, piling it into a hot vegetable dish, and  garnish with finely chopped parsley and then serve.      SQUASH BISCUIT    Place in a bowl      Three and one-half cups of sifted flour,    One teaspoon of salt,    Five teaspoons of baking powder.    Sift to mix and then rub in five tablespoons of shortening and mix  to a dough with one cup of prepared squash pulp. Work to a dough and  blend evenly, then roll out on a slightly floured board three-quarters  of an inch thick. Cut and brush the tops with milk and bake in a hot  oven for fifteen minutes.    Squash may be used to replace potatoes when making bread. Add one cup  of squash pulp to ginger-bread, or when making small cakes it will be  found to be delicious when used this way.      OMELET IN TOMATO CASES    Select firm tomatoes and then cut a slice from the tops and with a  spoon carefully remove the centres. Place the tomato in well-greased  custard cups and then break in a bowl four eggs; then add      Four tablespoons of water,    One teaspoon of salt,    One-half teaspoon of pepper.    Beat to mix and then fill into the prepared tomato. Sprinkle one  teaspoon of fine bread crumbs on top of each tomato and add      One teaspoon of butter,    Dash of paprika.    Set the custard cups in a baking pan and place in a hot oven and bake  for twenty minutes. Turn on a slice of toast and cover with cream  sauce.      BAKED TOMATOES, CHELSEA    Select firm tomatoes and cut a slice from the tops and scoop out the  centres with a spoon. Now grease custard cups and place the tomatoes  in the cups. Now shred very fine one ounce of dried beef. Divide into  the four tomatoes. Break in a mixing bowl      Two eggs.    Then add      Three-quarters cup of milk,    One-half teaspoon of salt,    One-half teaspoon of paprika,    One teaspoon of grated onion,    Two teaspoons of finely minced parsley.    Beat to mix and then chop fine the pulp from the tomatoes. Place one  teaspoon of this pulp in each tomato.      TOMATOES, COUNTRY STYLE    Select smooth, firm tomatoes cut in half and then place in a deep  dish. Cover with cracked ice and serve with the following dressing:      COUNTRY DRESSING    Place in a bowl      Three tablespoons of salad oil,    One tablespoon of vinegar,    One teaspoon of sugar,    One teaspoon of salt,    One-half teaspoon of white pepper,    One-quarter teaspoon of mustard.    Beat until creamy and then serve ice cold.      TOMATO FRITTERS    Select firm tomatoes and then cut in one-half inch slices. Dip in  the prepared batter and then fry until golden brown. Serve with cream  sauce.    How to prepare the batter: Place one egg in a bowl and add      One cup of water,    One teaspoon of salt,    One-half teaspoon of pepper.    Beat to mix and then add      Two tablespoons of grated onions,    One and one-half cups of flour,    Two teaspoons of baking powder.    Beat to a smooth batter and then dip the tomatoes into it. Fry quickly  until golden brown.      SPINACH    Let us first begin with the washing of the spinach. Take your cleanser  and scour out the sink and then scald it with boiling water. Now place  a clean cloth over the drain and turn the spinach into the sink. Use  plenty of lukewarm water to wash with. This is necessary to free these  crinky little leaves from the sand and grit. Now rinse in plenty of  cold water to crisp it. Shake the spinach dry and place in a deep  saucepan and cover and then steam gently until tender. Do not add  any water. In this manner the spinach is virtually cooked in its  own juices. Now turn into a chopping bowl and chop fine and then rub  through a coarse sieve and it is ready for use. You must prepare  and cook the spinach early in the day, so that you will have time to  properly prepare it, and then, when it is wanted, simply reheat it.      SPINACH A LA MODE    Prepare and cook the spinach as given above and then turn into a sieve  and let drain, with a weight, for three hours. Now chop fine and then  place one tablespoon of bacon or sausage fat in the frying pan and add      One small onion, minced very fine,    The prepared spinach.    Heat slowly until very hot and then season with salt and pepper. Lift  to a hot platter and garnish with a slice of hard-boiled egg.      SPINACH PUDDING    Cook the spinach as directed in the above methods and then add      One cup of creamed sauce,    One tablespoon of grated onion,    One cup of fine bread crumbs,    One and one-half teaspoons of salt,    One teaspoon of paprika.    Mix thoroughly and then pour into well-greased baking dish and bake in  a hot oven for twenty minutes.      SUNSHINE SAUCE FOR VEGETABLES    Make a cream sauce, using      One and one-half cups of milk,    Seven tablespoons of flour.    Place in a saucepan and stir until dissolved, using a fork or wire  whip. Bring to a boil. Cook slowly for five minutes and then add      One and one-half teaspoons of salt,    One teaspoon of white pepper,    Two tablespoons of grated onion,    Two well-beaten eggs.    Mix thoroughly and then serve with baked peppers.      SOUFFLE OF SPINACH    Cook the spinach as directed in the method and then place one cup of  spinach in a bowl and add      Yolks of two eggs,    One cup of very thick cream sauce,    One tablespoon of grated onion,    Two teaspoons of salt,    One teaspoon of paprika.    Mix thoroughly, and then carefully fold in the stiffly beaten whites  of two eggs and then pour into well-greased baking dish. Bake in a  moderate oven for twenty-five minutes and serve with cheese sauce in  place of meat for luncheon.      SPINACH NESTS    Cook spinach as for spinach a la mode and then chop fine and mould  into nests. Place on a slice of bread and then break an egg into each  nest and cover with two tablespoons of well-seasoned cream sauce and  one teaspoon of grated cheese. Place on a baking sheet in a moderate  oven for twelve minutes and serve with cream sauce for luncheon in  place of meat.      SPINACH WITH HOLLANDAISE SAUCE    Cook the spinach as given in the method and then when ready to serve,  reheat and make the Hollandaise sauce as follows:      Five tablespoons of salad oil,    Three tablespoons of vinegar,    One tablespoon of water,    One teaspoon of grated onion,    One-half teaspoon of paprika.

Thus an observer possessed by a restrictive theory will find no signs  where they are in plenty, while another determined on the universality  and identity of sign language can, as elsewhere explained, produce,  from perhaps the same individuals, evidence in his favor from the  apparently conclusive result of successful communication.      PERMANENCE OF SIGNS.    In connection with any theory it is important to inquire into the  permanence of particular gesture signs to express a special idea or  object when the system has been long continued. Many examples have  been given above showing that the gestures of classic times are still  in use by the modern Italians with the same signification; indeed that  the former on Greek vases or reliefs or in Herculanean bronzes  can only be interpreted by the latter. In regard to the signs of  instructed deaf-mutes in this country there appears to be a permanence  beyond expectation. Mr. Edmund Booth, a pupil of the Hartford  Institute half a century ago, and afterwards a teacher, says in the  \"_Annals_\" for April, 1880, that the signs used by teachers and pupils  at Hartford, Philadelphia, Washington, Council Bluffs, and Omaha were  nearly the same as he had learned. \"We still adhere to the old sign  for President from Monroe's three-cornered hat, and for governor we  designate the cockade worn by that dignitary on grand occasions three  generations ago.\"    The specific comparisons made, especially by Dr. Washington Matthews  and Dr. W.O. Boteler, of the signs reported by the Prince of Wied  in 1832 with those now used by the same tribes from whom he obtained  them, show a remarkable degree of permanency in many of those that  were so clearly described by the Prince as to be proper subjects of  any comparison. If they have persisted for half a century their age  is probably much greater. In general it is believed that signs,  constituting as they do a natural mode of expression, though enlarging  in scope as new ideas and new objects require to be included and  though abbreviated as hereinafter explained, do not readily change in  their essentials.    The writer has before been careful to explain that he does not present  any signs as precisely those of primitive man, not being so carried  away by enthusiasm as to suppose them possessed of immutability and  immortality not found in any other mode of human utterance. Yet such  signs as are generally prevalent among Indian tribes, and also in  other parts of the world, must be of great antiquity. The use of  derivative meanings to a sign only enhances this presumption. At  first there might not appear to be any connection between the ideas of  _same_ and _wife_, expressed by the sign of horizontally extending  the two forefingers side by side. The original idea was doubtless that  given by the Welsh captain in Shakspere's Henry V: \"'Tis so like as  my fingers is to my fingers,\" and from this similarity comes \"equal,\"  \"companion,\" and subsequently the close life-companion \"wife.\" The  sign is used in each of these senses by different Indian tribes,  and sometimes the same tribe applies it in all of the senses as  the context determines. It appears also in many lands with all the  significations except that of \"wife.\" It is proper here to mention  that the suggestion of several correspondents that the Indian sign as  applied to \"wife\" refers to \"lying together\" is rendered improbable  by the fact that when the same tribes desire to express the sexual  relation of marriage it is gestured otherwise. Many signs but little  differentiated were unstable, while others that have proved the best  modes of expression have survived as definite and established. Their  prevalence and permanence being mainly determined by the experience of  their utility, it would be highly interesting to ascertain how long a  time was required for a distinctly new conception or execution to gain  currency, become \"the fashion,\" so to speak, over a large part of the  continent, and to be supplanted by a new \"mode.\" A note may be made in  this connection of the large number of diverse signs for _horse_, all  of which must have been invented within a comparatively recent period,  and the small variation in the signs for _dog_, which are probably  ancient.      SURVIVAL IN GESTURE.    Even when the specific practice of sign language has been generally  discontinued for more than one generation, either from the adoption  of a jargon or from the common use of the tongue of the conquering  English, French, or Spanish, some of the gestures formerly employed  as substitutes for words may survive as a customary accompaniment to  oratory or impassioned conversation, and, when ascertained, should be  carefully noted. An example, among many, may be found in the fact  that the now civilized Muskoki or Creeks, as mentioned by Rev. H.F.  Buckner, when speaking of the height of children or women, illustrate  their words by holding their hands at the proper elevation, palm up;  but when describing the height of \"soulless\" animals or inanimate  objects, they hold the palm downward. This, when correlated with the  distinctive signs of other Indians, is an interesting case of the  survival of a practice which, so far as yet reported, the oldest men  of the tribe, now living only remember to have once existed. It is  probable that a collection of such distinctive gestures among the most  civilized Indians would reproduce enough of their ancient system to be  valuable, while possibly the persistent inquirer might in his search  discover some of its surviving custodians even among Chabta or  Cheroki, Innuit or Abnaki, Klamath or Nutka.      DISTINCTION BETWEEN IDENTITY OF SIGNS AND THEIR USE AS AN ART.    The general report that there is but one sign language in North  America, any deviation from which is either blunder, corruption, or a  dialect in the nature of provincialism, may be examined in reference  to some of the misconceived facts which gave it origin and credence.  It may not appear to be necessary that such examination should be  directed to any mode of collecting and comparing signs which would  amount to their distortion. It is useful, however, to explain that  distortion would result from following the views of a recent essayist,  who takes the ground that the description of signs should be made  according to a \"mean\" or average. There can be no philosophic  consideration of signs according to a \"mean\" of observations. The  proper object is to ascertain the radical or essential part as  distinct from any individual flourish or mannerism on the one hand,  and from a conventional or accidental abbreviation on the other; but  a mere average will not accomplish that object. If the hand, being  in any position whatever, is, according to five observations, moved  horizontally one foot to the right, and, according to five other  observations, moved one foot horizontally to the left, the \"mean\"  or resultant will be that it is stationary, which sign does not  correspond with any of the ten observations. So if six observations  give it a rapid motion of one foot to the right and five a rapid  motion of the same distance to the left, the mean or resultant would  be somewhat difficult to express, but perhaps would be a slow movement  to the right for an inch or two, having certainly no resemblance  either in essentials or accidents to any of the signs actually  observed. In like manner the tail of the written letter \"_y_\" (which,  regarding its mere formation, might be a graphic sign) may have in  the chirography of several persons various degrees of slope, may be  a straight line, or looped, and may be curved on either side; but a  \"mean\" taken from the several manuscripts would leave the unfortunate  letter without any tail whatever, or travestied as a \"_u_\" with an  amorphous flourish. A definition of the radical form of the letter or  sign by which it can be distinguished from any other letter or sign  is a very different proceeding. Therefore, if a \"mean\" or resultant of  any number of radically different signs to express the same object or  idea, observed either among several individuals of the same tribe or  among different tribes, is made to represent those signs, they are  all mutilated and ignored as distinctive signs, though the result may  possibly be made intelligible in practice, according to principles  mentioned in the present paper. The expedient of a \"mean\" may be  practically useful in the formation of a mere interpreter's jargon,  but it elucidates no principle. It is also convenient for any one  determined to argue for the uniformity of sign language as against the  variety in unity apparent in all the realms of nature. On the \"mean\"  principle, he only needs to take his two-foot rule and arithmetical  tables and make all signs his signs and his signs all signs. Of course  they are uniform, because he has made them so after the brutal example  of Procrustes.    In this connection it is proper to urge a warning that a mere sign  talker is often a bad authority upon principles and theories. He  may not be liable to the satirical compliment of Dickens's \"brave  courier,\" who \"understood all languages indifferently ill\"; but many  men speak some one language fluently, and yet are wholly unable to  explain or analyze its words and forms so as to teach it to another  person, or even to give an intelligent summary or classification  of their own knowledge. What such a sign talker has learned is by  memorizing, as a child may learn English, and though both the sign  talker and the child may be able to give some separate items useful to  a philologist or foreigner, such items are spoiled when colored by the  attempt of ignorance to theorize. A German who has studied English  to thorough mastery, except in the mere facility of speech, may in  a discussion upon some of its principles be contradicted by"]]]
