We shall then have a  method at the same time practical and scholarly.    We have studied the art of writing words correctly (spelling) and  writing sentences correctly (grammar).*  Now we wish to learn to write  sentences, paragraphs, and entire compositions _effectively_.     *See the earlier volumes in this series.    First, we must form the habit of observing the meanings and values of  words, the structure of sentences, of paragraphs, and of entire  compositions as we read standard literature---just as we have been  trying to form the habit of observing the spelling of words,  and the logical relationships of words in sentences.  In order that we  may know what to look for in our observation we must analyse a _little,_  but we will not imagine that we shall learn to do a thing by endless  talk about doing it.    Second, we will practise in the imitation of selections from master  writers, in every case fixing our attention on the rhetorical element  each particular writer best illustrates.  This imitation will be  continued until we have mastered the subject toward which we are  especially directing our attention, and all the subjects which go to the  making of an accomplished writer.    Third, we will finally make independent compositions for ourselves with  a view to studying and expressing the stock of ideas which we have to  express.  This will involve a study of the people on whom we wish to  impress our ideas, and require that we constantly test the results of  our work to see what the actual effect on the mind of our audience is.    Let us now begin our work.      CHAPTER I.    DICTION.    \"Diction\" is derived from the Latin _dictio,_ a word, and in rhetoric  it denotes choice of words.  In the study of grammar we have learned  that all words have logical relationships in sentences, and in some  cases certain forms to agree with particular relationships.  We have  also taken note of \"idioms,\" in which words are used with peculiar values.    On the subject of Idiom Arlo Bates in his book \"On Writing English\" has  some very forcible remarks.  Says he, \"An idiom is the personal---if the  word may be allowed---the personal idiosyncrasy of a language.  It is a method of speech wherein the genius of the race making the  language shows itself as differing from that of all other peoples.  What style is to the man, that is idiom to the race.  It is the  crystalization in verbal forms of peculiarities of race temperament---  perhaps even of race eccentricities . . . . . English which is not  idiomatic becomes at once formal and lifeless, as if the tongue were  already dead and its remains embalmed in those honorable sepulchres, the  philological dictionaries.  On the other hand, English which goes too  far, and fails of a delicate distinction between what is really and  essentially idiomatic and what is colloquial, becomes at once vulgar and  utterly wanting in that subtle quality of dignity for which there is no  better term than _distinction_.\"*     *As examples of idioms Mr. Bates gives the following:  A ten-foot  (instead of ten-feet) pole; the use of the \"flat adverb\"  or adjective form in such expressions as \"speak loud.\"  \"walk fast,\"  \"the sun shines hot,\" \"drink deep;\" and the use of prepositions  adverbially at the end of a sentence, as in \"Where are you  going to?\"  \"The subject which I spoke to you about,\" etc.    We therefore see that idiom is not only a thing to justify,  but something to strive for with all our might.  The use of it gives  character to our selection of words, and better than anything else  illustrates what we should be looking for in forming our habit of  observing the meanings and uses of words as we read.    Another thing we ought to note in our study of words is the _suggestion_  which many words carry with them in addition to their obvious meaning.  For instance, consider what a world of ideas the mere name of Lincoln  or Washington or Franklin or Napoleon or Christ calls up.  On their face  they are but names of men, or possibly sometimes of places; but we  cannot utter the name of Lincoln without thinking of the whole terrible  struggle of our Civil War; the name of Washington, without thinking of  nobility, patriotism, and self-sacrifice in a pure and great man;  Napoleon, without thinking of ambition and blood; of Christ, without  lifting our eyes to the sky in an attitude of worship and thanksgiving  to God.  So common words carry with them a world of suggested thought.  The word _drunk_ calls up a picture horrid and disgusting; _violet_  suggests blueness, sweetness, and innocence; _oak_ suggests sturdy  courage and strength; _love_ suggests all that is dear in the histories  of our own lives.  Just what will be suggested depends largely on the  person who hears the word, and in thinking of suggestion we must reflect  also on the minds of the persons to whom we speak.    The best practical exercise for the enlargement of one's vocabulary is  translating, or writing verses.  Franklin commends verse-writing, but  it is hardly mechanical enough to be of value in all cases.  At the same  time, many people are not in a position to translate from a foreign  language; and even if they were, the danger of acquiring foreign idioms  and strange uses of words is so great as to offset the positive gain.  But we can easily exercise ourselves in translating one kind of English  into another, as poetry into prose, or an antique style into modern.  To do this the constant use of the English dictionary will be necessary,  and incidentally we shall learn a great deal about words.    As an example of this method of study, we subjoin a series of notes on  the passage quoted from Franklin in the last chapter.  In our study we  constantly ask ourselves, \"Does this use of the word sound perfectly  natural?\"  At every point we appeal to our _instinct,_ and in time come  to trust it to a very great extent.  We even train it.  To train our  instinct for words is the first great object of our study.      Notes on Franklin.  (See \"How Franklin Learned to Write\" in preceding chapter.)    1.  \"The female sex\" includes animals as well as human beings,  and in modern times we say simply \"women,\" though when Franklin wrote  \"the female sex\" was considered an elegant phrase.    2.  Note that \"their\" refers to the collective noun \"sex.\"    3.  If we confine the possessive case to persons we would not say  \"for dispute's sake,\" and indeed \"for the sake of dispute\"  is just as good, if not better, in other respects.    4.  \"Ready plenty\" is antique usage for \"ready abundance.\"  Which is the stronger?    5.  \"Reasons\" in the phrase \"strength of his reasons\" is a simple and  forcible substitute for \"arguments.\"    6.  \"Copied fair\" shows an idiomatic use of an adjective form which  perhaps can be justified, but the combination has given way in these  days to \"made a fair copy of.\"    7.  Observe that Franklin uses \"pointing\" for _punctuation,_  and \"printing-house\" for _printing-office_.    8.  The old idiom \"endeavor at improvement\" has been changed to  _endeavor to improve,_ or _endeavor to make improvement_.    9.  Note how the use of the word _sentiment_ has changed.  We would be more likely to say _ideas_ in a connection like this.    10.  For \"laid them by,\" say _laid them away_.    11.  For \"laid me under . . . . . . necessity\" we might say  _compelled me,_ or _made it necessary that I should_.    12.  \"Amended\" is not so common now as _corrected_.    13.  For \"evading\" (attendance at public worship) we should now say  _avoiding_.  We \"evade\" more subtle things than attendance at church.    There are many other slight differences in the use of words which the  student will observe.  It would be an excellent exercise to write out,  not only this passage, but a number of others from the Autobiography,  in the most perfect of simple modern English.    We may also take a modern writer like Kipling and translate his style  into simple, yet attractive and good prose; and the same process may be  applied to any of the selections in this book, simply trying to find  equivalent and if possible equally good words to express the same ideas,  or slight variations of the same ideas.  Robinson Crusoe, Bacon's  Essays, and Pilgrim's Progress are excellent books to translate into  modern prose.  The chief thing is to do the work slowly and thoughtfully.      CHAPTER II.    FIGURES OF SPEECH.    It is not an easy thing to pass from the logical precision of grammar  to the vague suggestiveness of words that call up whole troops of ideas  not contained in the simple idea for which a word stands.  Specific idioms are themselves at variance with grammar and logic,  and the grammarians are forever fighting them; but when we go into the  vague realm of poetic style, the logical mind is lost at once.  And yet it is more important to use words pregnant with meaning than to  be strictly grammatical.  We must reduce grammar to an instinct that  will guard us against being contradictory or crude in our construction  of sentences, and then we shall make that instinct harmonize with all  the other instincts which a successful writer must have.  When grammar  is treated (as we have tried to treat it) as \"logical instinct,\"  then there can be no conflict with other instincts.    The suggestiveness of words finds its specific embodiment in the so  called \"figures of speech.\" We must examine them a little,  because when we come to such an expression as \"The kettle boils\" after  a few lessons in tracing logical connections, we are likely to say  without hesitation that we have found an error, an absurdity.  On its face it is an absurdity to say \"The kettle boils\" when we mean  \"The water in the kettle boils.\" But reflection will show us that we  have merely condensed our "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19721"],[0,"The Literary World Seventh Reader (#20)"],[1,"an excessively fat boy, and at the  present moment looked as patient as the blind. But he asked Ariel if she  was \"engaged for the next dance,\" and, Mamie, having flitted away, stood  [v]disconsolately beside her, waiting for the music to begin. Ariel was  grateful for him.    \"I think you must be very good-natured, Mr. Flitcroft,\" she said, with  an air of [v]raillery.    \"No, I'm not,\" he replied, [v]plaintively. \"Everybody thinks I am,  because I'm fat, and they expect me to do things they never dream of  asking anybody else to do. I'd like to see 'em even _ask_ 'Gene Bantry  to go and do some of the things they get me to do! A person isn't  good-natured just because he's fat,\" he concluded, morbidly, \"but he  might as well be!\"    \"Oh, I meant good-natured,\" she returned, with a sprightly laugh,  \"because you're willing to waltz with me.\"    \"Oh, well,\" he returned, sighing, \"that's all right.\"    The orchestra flourished into \"La Paloma\"; he put his arm mournfully  about her, and taking her right hand with his left, carried her arm out  to a rigid right angle, beginning to pump and balance for time. They  made three false starts and then got away. Ariel danced badly; she  hopped and lost the step, but they persevered, bumping against other  couples continually. Circling breathlessly into the next room, they  passed close to a long mirror, in which Ariel saw herself, although in a  flash, more bitterly contrasted to the others than in the cheval-glass  of the dressing-room. The clump of roses was flopping about her neck,  her crimped hair looked frowzy, and there was something terribly wrong  about her dress. Suddenly she felt her train to be [v]grotesque, as a  thing following her in a nightmare.    A moment later she caught her partner making a [v]burlesque face of  suffering over her shoulder, and, turning her head quickly, saw for  whose benefit he had constructed it. Eugene Bantry, flying expertly by  with Mamie, was bestowing upon Mr. Flitcroft a commiserative wink. The  next instant she tripped in her train and fell to the floor at Eugene's  feet, carrying her partner with her.    There was a shout of laughter. The young hostess stopped Eugene, who  would have gone on, and he had no choice but to stoop to Ariel's  assistance.    \"It seems to be a habit of mine,\" she said, laughing loudly.    She did not appear to see the hand he offered, but got on her feet  without help and walked quickly away with Norbert, who proceeded to live  up to the character he had given himself.    \"Perhaps we had better not try it again,\" she laughed.    \"Well, I should think not,\" he returned with the frankest gloom. With  the air of conducting her home, he took her to the chair against the  wall whence he had brought her. There his responsibility for her seemed  to cease. \"Will you excuse me?\" he asked, and there was no doubt he felt  that he had been given more than his share that evening, even though he  was fat.    \"Yes, indeed.\" Her laughter was continuous. \"I should think you _would_  be glad to get rid of me after that. Ha, ha, ha! Poor Mr. Flitcroft, you  know you are!\"    It was the deadly truth, and the fat one, saying, \"Well, if you'll  excuse me now,\" hurried away with a step which grew lighter as the  distance from her increased. Arrived at the haven of a far doorway, he  mopped his brow and shook his head grimly in response to frequent  rallyings.    Ariel sat through more dances, interminable dances and intermissions, in  that same chair, in which it began to seem she was to live out the rest  of her life. Now and then, if she thought people were looking at her as  they passed, she broke into a laugh and nodded slightly, as if still  amused over her mishap.    After a long time she rose, and laughing cheerfully to Mr. Flitcroft,  who was standing in the doorway and replied with a wan smile, stepped  out quickly into the hall, where she almost ran into her great-uncle,  Jonas Tabor. He was going toward the big front doors with Judge Pike,  having just come out of the latter's library, down the hall.    Jonas was breathing heavily and was shockingly pale, though his eyes  were very bright. He turned his back upon his grandniece sharply and  went out of the door. Ariel reentered the room whence she had come. She  laughed again to her fat friend as she passed him, went to the window  and looked out. The porch seemed deserted and was faintly illuminated by  a few Japanese lanterns. She sprang out, dropped upon the divan, and  burying her face in her hands, cried heart-brokenly.    Presently she felt something alive touch her foot, and, her breath  catching with alarm, she started to rise. A thin hand, issuing from a  shabby sleeve, had stolen out between two of the green tubs and was  pressing upon one of her shoes.    \"Sh!\" warned a voice. \"Don't make a noise!\"    The warning was not needed; she had recognized the hand and sleeve  instantly. It was her playmate and lifelong friend, Joe Louden.    \"What were you going on about?\" he asked angrily.    \"Nothing,\" she answered. \"I wasn't. You must go away; you know the Judge  doesn't like you.\"    \"What were you crying about?\" interrupted the uninvited guest.    \"Nothing, I tell you!\" she repeated, the tears not ceasing to gather in  her eyes. \"I wasn't.\"    \"I want to know what it was,\" he insisted. \"Didn't the fools ask you to  dance! Ah! You needn't tell me. That's it. I've been here, watching, for  the last three dances and you weren't in sight till you came to the  window. Well, what do you care about that for!\"    \"I don't,\" she answered. \"I don't!\" Then suddenly, without being able to  prevent it, she sobbed.    \"No,\" he said, gently, \"I see you don't. And you let yourself be a fool  because there are a lot of fools in there.\"    She gave way, all at once, to a gust of sorrow and bitterness; she bent  far over and caught his hand and laid it against her wet cheek. \"Oh,  Joe,\" she whispered, brokenly, \"I think we have such hard lives, you and  I! It doesn't seem right--while we're so young! Why can't we be like the  others? Why can't we have some of the fun?\"    He withdrew his hand, with the embarrassment and shame he would have  felt had she been a boy.    \"Get out!\" he said, feebly.    She did not seem to notice, but, still stooping, rested her elbows on  her knees and her face in her hands. \"I try so hard to have some fun, to  be like the rest--and it's always a mistake, always, always, always!\"  She rocked herself slightly from side to side. \"I'm a fool, it's the  truth, or I wouldn't have come to-night. I want to be attractive--I want  to be in things. I want to laugh as they do--\"    \"To laugh, just to laugh, and not because there's something funny?\"    \"Yes, I do, I do! And to know how to dress and to wear my hair--there  must be some place where you can learn those things. I've never had any  one to show me! It's only lately I've cared, but I'm seventeen, Joe--\"  She faltered, came to a stop, and her whole body was shaken with sobs.  \"I hate myself so for crying--for everything!\"    Just then a colored waiter, smiling graciously, came out upon the porch,  bearing a tray of salad, hot oysters, and coffee. At his approach, Joe  had fallen prone on the floor in the shadow. Ariel shook her head to the  proffer of refreshments.    \"I don't want any,\" she murmured.    The waiter turned away in pity and was reentering the window when a  passionate whisper fell upon his ear as well as upon Ariel's.    _\"Take it!\"_    \"Ma'am?\" said the waiter.    \"I've changed my mind,\" she replied quickly. The waiter, his elation  restored, gave of his viands with the [v]superfluous bounty loved by his  race when distributing the product of the wealthy.    When he had gone, \"Give me everything that's hot,\" said Joe. \"You can  keep the salad.\"    \"I couldn't eat it or anything else,\" she answered, thrusting the plate  between the palms.    For a time there was silence. From within the house came the continuous  babble of voices and laughter, the clink of [v]cutlery on china. The  young people spent a long time over their supper. By and by the waiter  returned to the veranda, deposited a plate of colored ices upon Ariel's  knees with a noble gesture, and departed.    \"No ice for me,\" said Joe.    \"Won't you please go now?\" she entreated.    \"It wouldn't be good manners,\" he joked. \"They might think I only came  for the supper.\"    \"Give me the dish and coffee-cup,\" she whispered, impatiently. \"Suppose  the waiter came and had to look for them? Quick!\"    A bottle-shaped figure appeared in the window, and she had no time to  take the plate and cup which were being pushed through the palm-leaves.  She whispered a word of warning, and the dishes were hurriedly withdrawn  as Norbert Flitcroft, wearing a solemn expression of injury, came out  upon the veranda.    \"They want you. Some one's come for you.\"    \"Oh, is grandfather waiting?\" She rose.    \"It isn't your grandfather that has come for you,\" answered the fat one,  slowly. \"It is Eskew Arp. Something's happened.\"    She looked at him for a moment, beginning to tremble violently, her eyes  growing wide with fright.    \"Is my grandfather--is he sick?\"    \"You'd better go and see. Old Eskew's waiting in the hall. He'll tell  you.\"    She was by him and through the window instantly. Mr. Arp was waiting in  the hall, talking in a low voice to Mrs. Pike.    \"Your grandfather's all right,\" he told the frightened girl quickly. \"He  sent me for you. Just hurry and get your things.\"    She was with him again in a moment, and seizing the old man's arm,  hurried him down the steps and toward the street almost at a run.    \"You're not telling me the truth,\" she said. \"You're not telling me the  truth!\"    \"Nothing has happened to Roger Tabor,\" panted Mr. Arp. \"We're going this  way, not that.\" They had come to the gate, and as she turned to the  right he pulled her sharply to the left.    \"Where are we going?\" she demanded.    \"To"]]]
