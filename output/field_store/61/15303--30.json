His ownership of his garden plot is more exclusive than  is that of his bush land, as other people are not entitled to pass  over it. But on the other hand, if he abandons the garden, and nature  again overruns it with growth--a process which takes place with great  rapidity--it ceases to be his garden, and reverts to, and becomes  absorbed in, the portion of the bush out of which it had been cleared;  and if, as it may be, he is not the sole owner of that portion of bush,  he loses his exclusive right to the land, which as a garden had been  his own sole property.    No man can sell or exchange either his bush land or his garden plots,  and changes in their ownership therefore only arise through death  and inheritance. This statement, however, is, I think, subject to the  qualification that an owner of bush-land will sometimes allow his son  or other male descendant to clear and make for himself a garden in it;  but I am not sure as to the point.    On a man's death his widow, if any, does not inherit any portion of his  property, either movable or immovable, but three things are allowed  to her. She is generally allowed one pig, which will be required by  her at a later date for the ceremony of the removal of her mourning;  and she shares with her husband's children, or, if there be none,  she has the sole right to, the then current season's crops and fruit  resulting from the planting effected by her late husband and herself,  though this is a right which, after her return home to her own people,  she would not continue to exercise; and she is allowed to continue to  occupy her husband's house, but this latter privilege terminates at  the mourning removal ceremony, when the house will be pulled down, and  its site will revert to the village, and she will probably return to  her own people in her own village, if she has not done so previously.    Subject to these three allowances, I may dismiss the widow entirely  in dealing with the law of inheritance. I may also dismiss the  man's female children by saying that, if there be male children, the  females do not share at all in the inheritance, and even if there be  no male children the female children will only perhaps be allowed,  apparently rather as a matter of grace than of right, to share in  his movable effects; and that, subject to this, everything goes to  the man's male relatives. I may also eliminate the man's pigs, as  apparently any pigs he has, other than that retained for his widow,  are killed at his funeral.    On the death of an owner everything he possesses goes, except as above  mentioned, to his sons. They divide the movable things between them,  but the bush and garden land pass to them jointly, and there is no  process by which either of these can be divided and portioned among  them. The male children of a deceased son, and the male children of  any deceased male child of that deceased son (and so on for subsequent  generations), inherit between them in lieu of that son. There does not  appear, however, to be any idea in the Mafulu mind of each son of the  deceased owner being entitled to a specific equal fractional share,  or of the descendants of a deceased son of that owner being between  them only entitled to one share, _per stirpes_. They apparently do  not get beyond the general idea that these people, whoever they may  be and to whatever generations they may belong, become the owners of  the property.    They take possession of and cultivate the existing gardens as joint  property. Any one of them will be allowed to clear some of their  portion of bush, and fence it, and plant it as a garden, and it will  then become the sole property of that one man, and if he dies it  will pass as his own property to his own heirs; though, as before  stated, if he abandons it, and lets it be swallowed up by the bush,  it will cease to be his own garden, and will again be included in the  family's joint portion of bush land, and on his death his heirs will  only come into the joint bush ownership.    In this way the ownership of a garden must often be in several persons,  with no well-defined rights _inter se_, and the general ownership of  bush land which has never been cleared, or which, having been cleared,  has been abandoned and reverted, must often be in a very large number  of persons without defined rights. In fact, so far as bush land is  concerned, one only has to remember that on the death of an owner it  passes into joint ownership of children--that on the deaths of these  children fresh groups of persons come into the joint ownership--that  this may go on indefinitely, generation after generation--that bush,  having once got into the ownership of many people, is hardly likely  to again fall by descents into a single ownership--that indeed the  tendency must be for the number of owners of any one portion of bush  steadily to increase--and finally that there is no way by which the  extensively divided ownership can be terminated by either partition  or alienation--and one then realises the extraordinary complications  of family ownership of bush land which must commonly exist.    As regards both movable effects and gardens and bush land there must  be endless occasions for dispute. How are the movable things to be  divided among the inheritors, and, in particular, who is to take  perhaps one valuable article, which may be worth all the rest put  together? How are questions of doubtful claims to heirship to bush  and garden land to be determined? How is the joint ownership of the  gardens to be dealt with, and how is the work there to be apportioned,  and the products of the gardens divided? How are the mutual rights  of the bush land to be regulated, and especially what is to happen  if each of two or more joint owners desires to clear and allocate  to himself as a garden, a specially eligible piece of bush? Such  situations in England would bristle with lawsuits, and I tried to  find out how these questions were actually dealt with by the Mafulu;  but there is no judicial system there, and the only answer I could  get was that in these matters, as in the case of inter-community bush  boundaries and personal bush boundaries, disputes were practically  unknown; though it was pointed out to me, as regards bush land,  that the amount of it belonging to any one family was usually so  large that crowding out could hardly arise.    If a man dies without male descendants in the male line, then, subject  perhaps to some sort of claim of his daughters, if any, to share in  his movable effects, his property goes to his nearest male relative  or relatives in the male line. This would primarily be his father,  if living, but the father could hardly be the inheritor of anything  but movable things and perhaps garden land, as the deceased could not  be the owner of bush land during the lifetime of his father. Subject as  regards movable things and perhaps gardens to this right of the father,  the persons to inherit everything would be deceased's brothers and the  male descendants in the male line of any such brothers who had died;  or in default of these it would be the father's (not the mother's)  brothers and their male descendants in the male line, and so on for  more distant male relatives, every descent being traced strictly in  the male line only, on a principle similar to that above explained.    Male infants, by which term I mean young children, there being of  course no infancy in the defined sense in which the term is used  in English law, like adults, may become possessed of property by  inheritance as regards bush and garden land, and by inheritance  or otherwise as regards movable property, but they would hardly be  likely to be the owners of houses; and the descent from these infants  is the same as that in the case of adults.    No woman can possess any property, other than movable property,  and even this is at best confined to the clothes and ornaments which  she wears. On the death of a married woman all her effects go to her  husband, or, if he be dead, they go to her children or descendants,  male and female, equally, If she has no children or descendants, they  go to her husband's father, or, failing him, to such other person or  persons as would have been entitled to inherit if her effects had  been those of her husband. Her own blood relations do not come in,  as she had been bought and paid for by her husband. If the deceased  woman were a spinster, then her effects would pass to her father,  or, failing him, to her brothers, or, failing them, to her nearest  male relatives on her father's side.    The guardianship of and responsibility for infant children whose  father dies falls primarily upon the children's mother, and she,  if and when she returned to her own people, would probably take the  children away with her, though her sons, who shared in the inheritance  from their father, would usually come back again to their own village  when they became grown up, and might do so even when comparatively  young. If there is no mother of the children, the guardianship and  responsibility is taken up by one or more of the relatives of either  the deceased father or deceased mother of the children, and it might  be that some children would be taken over by some of such relatives,  and some by others. There appears, however, to be no regular rule as  to all this, the question being largely one of convenience.    Adopted children have in all matters of inheritance the same rights  as actual children.    From the above particulars it will be seen that there is no system  of descent in the female line or of mother-right among the Mafulu,  and I could not find any trace of such a thing having ever existed  with them. As to this I would draw attention to the facts that the  mother's relatives do not come in specially, as "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17959"],[0,"The Hand of Fu-Manchu (#20)"],[1,"glance upward in my direction, the animal slunk away toward  the path bordering the cutting.    By a devious route amid ghostly gasometers I had crept to my post in  the early dusk, before the moon was risen, and already I was heartily  weary of my passive part in the affair of the night. I had never before  appreciated the multitudinous sounds, all of them weird and many of  them horrible, which are within the compass of those great black rats  who find their way to England with cargoes from Russia and elsewhere.  From the rafters above my head, from the wall recesses about me, from  the floor beneath my feet, proceeded a continuous and nerve-shattering  concert, an unholy symphony which seemingly accompanied the eternal  dance of the rats.    Sometimes a faint splash from below would tell of one of the revelers  taking the water, but save for the more distant throbbing of riverside  industry, and rarer note of shipping, the mad discords of this rat  saturnalia alone claimed the ear.    The hour was nigh now, when matters should begin to develop. I  followed the chimes from the clock of some church nearby--I have never  learnt its name; and was conscious of a thrill of excitement when  they warned me that the hour was actually arrived....    A strange figure appeared noiselessly, from I knew not where, and  stood fully within view upon the bridge crossing the cutting, peering  to right and left, in an attitude of listening. It was the figure of  a bedraggled old woman, gray-haired, and carrying a large bundle tied  up in what appeared to be a red shawl. Of her face I could see little,  since it was shaded by the brim of her black bonnet, but she rested  her bundle upon the low wall of the bridge, and to my intense  surprise, sat down upon it!    She evidently intended to remain there.    I drew back further into the darkness; for the presence of this  singular old woman at such a place, and at that hour, could not well  be accidental. I was convinced that the first actor in the drama had  already taken the stage. Whether I was mistaken or not must shortly  appear.    Crisp footsteps sounded upon the roadway; distantly, and from my  left. Nearer they approached and nearer. I saw the old woman, in the  shadow of the wall, glance once rapidly in the direction of the  approaching pedestrian. For some occult reason, the chorus of the  rats was stilled. Only that firm and regular tread broke the intimate  silence of the dreary spot.    Now the pedestrian came within my range of sight. It was Nayland Smith!    He wore a long tweed overcoat with which I was familiar, and a soft  felt hat, the brim pulled down all around in a fashion characteristic  of him, and probably acquired during the years spent beneath the  merciless sun of Burma. He carried a heavy walking-cane which I knew  to be a formidable weapon that he could wield to good effect. But,  despite the stillness about me, a stillness which had reigned  uninterruptedly (save for the _danse macabre_ of the rats) since the  coming of dusk, some voice within, ignoring these physical evidences  of solitude, spoke urgently of lurking assassins; of murderous  Easterns armed with those curved knives which sometimes flashed  before my eyes in dreams; of a deathly menace which hid in the  shadows about me, in the many shadows cloaking the holes and corners  of the ramshackle building, draping arches, crannies and portals to  which the moonlight could not penetrate.    He was abreast of the Joy-Shop now, and in sight of the ominous old  witch huddled upon the bridge. He pulled up suddenly and stood  looking at her. Coincident with his doing so, she began to moan and  sway her body to right and left as if in pain; then--    \"Kind gentleman,\" she whined in a sing-song voice, \"thank God you came  this way to help a poor old woman.\"    \"What is the matter?\" said Smith tersely, approaching her.    I clenched my fists. I could have cried out; I was indeed hard put to  it to refrain from crying out--from warning him. But his injunctions  had been explicit, and I restrained myself by a great effort,  preserving silence and crouching there at the window, but with every  muscle tensed and a desire for action strong upon me.    \"I tripped up on a rough stone, sir,\" whined the old creature, \"and  here I've been sitting waiting for a policeman or someone to help me,  for more than an hour, I have.\"    Smith stood looking down at her, his arms behind him, and in one  gloved hand swinging the cane.    \"Where do you live, then?\" he asked.    \"Not a hundred steps from here, kind gentleman,\" she replied in the  monotonous voice; \"but I can't move my left foot. It's only just  through the gates yonder.\"    \"What!\" snapped Smith, \"on the wharf?\"    \"They let me have a room in the old building until it's let,\" she  explained. \"Be helping a poor old woman, and God bless you.\"    \"Come along, then!\"    Stooping, Smith placed his arm around her shoulders, and assisted her  to her feet. She groaned as if in great pain, but gripped her red  bundle, and leaning heavily upon the supporting arm, hobbled off  across the bridge in the direction of the wharf gates at the end of  the lane.    Now at last a little action became possible, and having seen my friend  push open one of the gates and assist the old woman to enter, I crept  rapidly across the crazy floor, found the doorway, and, with little  noise, for I wore rubber-soled shoes, stole down the stairs into what  had formerly been the reception-room of the Joy-Shop, the malodorous  sanctum of the old Chinaman, John Ki.    Utter darkness prevailed there, but momentarily flicking the light of  a pocket-lamp upon the floor before me, I discovered the further steps  that were to be negotiated, and descended into the square yard which  gave access to the path skirting the creek.    The moonlight drew a sharp line of shadow along the wall of the house  above me, but the yard itself was a well of darkness. I stumbled under  the rotting brick archway, and stepped gingerly upon the muddy path  that I must follow. One hand pressed to the damp wall, I worked my way  cautiously along, for a false step had precipitated me into the foul  water of the creek. In this fashion and still enveloped by dense  shadows, I reached the angle of the building. Then--at risk of being  perceived, for the wharf and the river both were bathed in moonlight--  I peered along to the left....    Out onto the paved pathway communicating with the wharf came Smith,  shepherding his tottering charge. I was too far away to hear any  conversation that might take place between the two, but, unless Smith  gave the pre-arranged signal, I must approach no closer. Thus, as one  sees a drama upon the screen, I saw what now occurred--occurred with  dramatic, lightning swiftness.    Releasing Smith's arm, the old woman suddenly stepped back ... at the  instant that another figure, a repellent figure which approached,  stooping, apish, with a sort of loping gait, crossed from some spot  invisible to me, and sprang like a wild animal upon Smith's back!    It was a Chinaman, wearing a short loose garment of the smock pattern,  and having his head bare, so that I could see his pigtail coiled upon  his yellow crown. That he carried a cord, I perceived in the instant  of his spring, and that he had whipped it about Smith's throat with  unerring dexterity was evidenced by the one, short, strangled cry that  came from my friend's lips.    Then Smith was down, prone upon the crazy planking, with the ape-like  figure of the Chinaman perched between his shoulders--bending forward--  the wicked yellow fingers at work, tightening--tightening--tightening  the strangling-cord!    Uttering a loud cry of horror, I went racing along the gangway which  projected actually over the moving Thames waters, and gained the wharf.  But, swift as I had been, another had been swifter!    A tall figure (despite the brilliant moon, I doubted the evidence of  my sight), wearing a tweed overcoat and a soft felt hat with the brim  turned down, sprang up, from nowhere as it seemed, swooped upon the  horrible figure squatting, simianesque, between Smith's shoulder-blades,  and grasped him by the neck.    I pulled up shortly, one foot set upon the wharf. The new-comer was  the double of Nayland Smith!    Seemingly exerting no effort whatever, he lifted the strangler in that  remorseless grasp, so that the Chinaman's hands, after one quick  convulsive upward movement, hung limply beside him like the paws of a  rat in the grip of a terrier.    \"You damned murderous swine!\" I heard in a repressed, savage undertone.  \"The knife failed, so now the cord has an innings! Go after your pal!\"    Releasing one hand from the neck of the limp figure, the speaker  grasped the Chinaman by his loose, smock-like garment, swung him back,  once--a mighty swing--and hurled him far out into the river as one  might hurl a sack of rubbish!        CHAPTER XXIII    ARREST OF SAMARKAN      \"As the high gods willed it,\" explained Nayland Smith, tenderly  massaging his throat, \"Mr. Forsyth, having just left the docks,  chanced to pass along Three Colt Street on Wednesday night at exactly  the hour that _I_ was expected! The resemblance between us is rather  marked and the coincidence of dress completed the illusion. That  devilish Eurasian woman, Zarmi, who has escaped us again--of course  you recognized her?--made a very natural mistake. Mr. Forsyth, however,  made no mistake!\"    I glanced at the chief officer of the _Andaman_, who sat in an armchair  in our new chambers, contentedly smoking a black cheroot.    \"Heaven has blessed me with a pair of useful hands!\" said the seaman,  grimly, extending his horny palms. \"I've an old score against those  yellow swine; poor George and I were twins.\"    He referred to his brother who had been foully done to death by one of  the creatures of Dr. Fu-Manchu.    \"It beats me how Mr. Smith got on the track!\""]]]
