In the upper room of the palace tower was my lonely hermit cell, my only  companions being a nest of wasps. In the unrelieved darkness of the  night I slept there alone. Sometimes a wasp or two would drop off the  nest on to my bed, and if perchance I happened to roll on one, the  meeting was unpleasing to the wasp and keenly discomforting to me.    On moonlight nights pacing round and round the extensive terrace  overlooking the river was one of my caprices. It was while so doing that  I first composed my own tunes for my songs. The song addressed to the  Rose-maiden was one of these, and it still finds a place in my published  works.    Finding how imperfect was my knowledge of English I set to work reading  through some English books with the help of a dictionary. From my  earliest years it was my habit not to let any want of complete  comprehension interfere with my reading on, quite satisfied with the  structure which my imagination reared on the bits which I understood  here and there. I am reaping even to-day both the good and bad effects  of this habit.          (25) _England_      After six months thus spent in Ahmedabad we started for England. In an  unlucky moment I began to write letters about my journey to my relatives  and to the _Bharati_. Now it is beyond my power to call them back. These  were nothing but the outcome of youthful bravado. At that age the mind  refuses to admit that its greatest pride is in its power to understand,  to accept, to respect; and that modesty is the best means of enlarging  its domain. Admiration and praise are looked upon as a sign of weakness  or surrender, and the desire to cry down and hurt and demolish with  argument gives rise to this kind of intellectual fireworks. These  attempts of mine to establish my superiority by revilement might have  occasioned me amusement to-day, had not their want of straightness and  common courtesy been too painful.    From my earliest years I had had practically no commerce with the  outside world. To be plunged in this state, at the age of 17, into the  midst of the social sea of England would have justified considerable  misgiving as to my being able to keep afloat. But as my sister-in-law  happened to be in Brighton with her children I weathered the first shock  of it under her shelter.    Winter was then approaching. One evening as we were chatting round the  fireside, the children came running to us with the exciting news that it  had been snowing. We at once went out. It was bitingly cold, the sky  filled with white moonlight, the earth covered with white snow. It was  not the face of Nature familiar to me, but something quite  different--like a dream. Everything near seemed to have receded far  away, leaving the still white figure of an ascetic steeped in deep  meditation. The sudden revelation, on the mere stepping outside a door,  of such wonderful, such immense beauty had never before come upon me.    My days passed merrily under the affectionate care of my sister-in-law  and in boisterous rompings with the children. They were greatly tickled  at my curious English pronunciation, and though in the rest of their  games I could whole-heartedly join, this I failed to see the fun of. How  could I explain to them that there was no logical means of  distinguishing between the sound of _a_ in warm and _o_ in worm.  Unlucky that I was, I had to bear the brunt of the ridicule which was  more properly the due of the vagaries of English spelling.    I became quite an adept in inventing new ways of keeping the children  occupied and amused. This art has stood me in good stead many a time  thereafter, and its usefulness for me is not yet over. But I no longer  feel in myself the same unbounded profusion of ready contrivance. That  was the first opportunity I had for giving my heart to children, and it  had all the freshness and overflowing exuberance of such a first gift.    But I had not set out on this journey to exchange a home beyond the seas  for the one on this side. The idea was that I should study Law and come  back a barrister. So one day I was put into a public school in Brighton.  The first thing the Headmaster said after scanning my features was:  \"What a splendid head you have!\" This detail lingers in my memory  because she, who at home was an enthusiast in her self-imposed duty of  keeping my vanity in check, had impressed on me that my cranium[41] and  features generally, compared with that of many another were barely of a  medium order. I hope the reader will not fail to count it to my credit  that I implicitly believed her, and inwardly deplored the parsimony of  the Creator in the matter of my making. On many another occasion,  finding myself estimated by my English acquaintances differently from  what I had been accustomed to be by her, I was led to seriously worry my  mind over the divergence in the standard of taste between the two  countries!    One thing in the Brighton school seemed very wonderful: the other boys  were not at all rude to me. On the contrary they would often thrust  oranges and apples into my pockets and run away. I can only ascribe this  uncommon behaviour of theirs to my being a foreigner.    I was not long in this school either--but that was no fault of the  school. Mr. Tarak Palit[42] was then in England. He could see that this  was not the way for me to get on, and prevailed upon my brother to allow  him to take me to London, and leave me there to myself in a lodging  house. The lodgings selected faced the Regent Gardens. It was then the  depth of winter. There was not a leaf on the row of trees in front which  stood staring at the sky with their scraggy snow-covered branches--a  sight which chilled my very bones.    For the newly arrived stranger there can hardly be a more cruel place  than London in winter. I knew no one near by, nor could I find my way  about. The days of sitting alone at a window, gazing at the outside  world, came back into my life. But the scene in this case was not  attractive. There was a frown on its countenance; the sky turbid; the  light lacking lustre like a dead man's eye; the horizon shrunk upon  itself; with never an inviting smile from a broad hospitable world. The  room was but scantily furnished, but there happened to be a harmonium  which, after the daylight came to its untimely end, I used to play upon  according to my fancy. Sometimes Indians would come to see me; and,  though my acquaintance with them was but slight, when they rose to leave  I felt inclined to hold them back by their coat-tails.    While living in these rooms there was one who came to teach me Latin.  His gaunt figure with its worn-out clothing seemed no more able than the  naked trees to withstand the winter's grip. I do not know what his age  was but he clearly looked older than his years. Some days in the course  of our lessons he would suddenly be at a loss for some word and look  vacant and ashamed. His people at home counted him a crank. He had  become possessed of a theory. He believed that in each age some one  dominant idea is manifested in every human society in all parts of the  world; and though it may take different shapes under different degrees  of civilisation, it is at bottom one and the same; nor is such idea  taken from one by another by any process of adoption, for this truth  holds good even where there is no intercourse. His great preoccupation  was the gathering and recording of facts to prove this theory. And while  so engaged his home lacked food, his body clothes. His daughters had but  scant respect for his theory and were perhaps constantly upbraiding him  for his infatuation. Some days one could see from his face that he had  lighted upon some new proof, and that his thesis had correspondingly  advanced. On these occasions I would broach the subject, and wax  enthusiastic at his enthusiasm. On other days he would be steeped in  gloom, as if his burden was too heavy to bear. Then would our lessons  halt at every step; his eyes wander away into empty space; and his mind  refuse to be dragged into the pages of the first Latin Grammar. I felt  keenly for the poor body-starved theory-burdened soul, and though I was  under no delusion as to the assistance I got in my Latin, I could not  make up my mind to get rid of him. This pretence of learning Latin  lasted as long as I was at these lodgings. When on the eve of leaving  them I offered to settle his dues he said piteously: \"I have done  nothing, and only wasted your time, I cannot accept any payment from  you.\" It was with great difficulty that I got him at last to take his  fees.    Though my Latin tutor had never ventured to trouble me with the proofs  of his theory, yet up to this day I do not disbelieve it. I am convinced  that the minds of men are connected through some deep-lying continuous  medium, and that a disturbance in one part is by it secretly  communicated to others.    Mr. Palit next placed me in the house of a coach named Barker. He used  to lodge and prepare students for their examinations. Except his mild  little wife there was not a thing with any pretensions to attractiveness  about this household. One can understand how such a tutor can get  pupils, for these poor creatures do not often get the chance of making a  choice. But it is painful to think of the conditions under which such  men get wives. Mrs. Barker had attempted to console herself with a pet  dog, but when Barker wanted to punish his wife he tortured the dog. So  that her affection for the unfortunate animal only made for an  enlargement of her field of sensibility.    From these surroundings, when my sister-in-law sent for me to Torquay in  Devonshire, I was only too glad to run off to her. I cannot tell how  happy I was with the hills there, the sea, the flower-covered meadows,  the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22224"],[0,"At Aboukir and Acre: A Story of Napoleon's Invasion of Egypt (#20)"],[1,"the minarets and roof of the Mosque of Hassan, and  from the houses near the wall, was poured at the French artillerymen, to  prevent them from working their guns upon their assailants. Gonmartin,  however, had with him three battalions of infantry and 300 cavalry, and  with these he charged the advancing crowd. The Arabs fought bravely, but  were, for the most part, slain, and the insurgents, unable to stand the  heavy volleys, followed by a bayonet charge of the infantry, fled back  to the gate from which they had sallied out, 400 of them being taken  prisoners and sent to the citadel.    A great number of the fugitives fled to the Mosque of Gama El Ashar,  which was now crowded. Their reports of the disaster shook the courage  of those already there, and when four columns of French infantry emerged  simultaneously from the ends of as many streets, the fire opened upon  them from the roof of the mosque was but feeble. Six guns were instantly  placed commanding its gate, which was shattered after two or three  rounds had been fired, and then, with a shout, the infantry rushed in  and commenced the work of slaughter. This was terrible, no quarter was  given, and some 6000 Moslems perished there, while 2000 had been killed  in the previous fighting.    Satisfied with this terrible act of vengeance, the French troops were  marched back to the square they had left in the morning, Bonaparte being  sure that there would be no more rioting after the terrible lesson that  had been taught the inhabitants. Late in the evening, indeed, the chief  men waited upon him and implored mercy for the town. Several of them had  been members of the council who directed the movement, but they  represented that they had been compelled to act against their will, and  Napoleon, satisfied that there would be no more troubles, pardoned them  on condition of their at once issuing a proclamation condemning the  rioters, and ordering all to return to their ordinary avocations, and to  hand over to the authorities any who should preach mischief.    After the capture of the mosque, Edgar went down to the great square  occupied by the French, and gathered from the talk of the officers there  the result of the sortie. All agreed that the Arabs had fought bravely,  and that few indeed had left the field alive. Edgar made his way out of  the town by the Boulak gate, which was still open, and found the two  Arabs still at the spot where he had left them when he and Sidi rode off  to meet the chief at the Pyramids. They were full of excitement at the  battle that had raged all day.    \"I have bad news,\" he said. \"I rode with the sheik and his son against  the French. My horse was killed, and I received a wound in the arm, but,  as you see, I obtained a disguise, and have escaped without further  harm. You heard that there was a great fight outside the walls?\"    \"Yes, my lord. Many men came running past here, and said that the French  had beaten them.\"    \"I greatly fear,\" Edgar went on, \"that the sheik and his son took part  in that fight. Many Arabs went out with those who attacked the battery,  and I think it almost certain that the sheik and his son were among  them. Most of the tribesmen were killed in the fight in which I was  wounded. The sheik would have joined his countrymen, knowing that there  would be no mercy shown the Arabs taken in the town. I hear that almost  every one of those who rode out were killed, and I want you to come with  me to search among the dead, for doubtless there are many wounded among  them, and one or other may yet be alive. There will be a bright moon,  and we shall have no difficulty in recognizing them. It will be  necessary only to search among those in white.\"    The two men were greatly moved at the thought of the fate of their  chief, his son, and so many of their followers, and assented at once to  his proposal.    \"We must wait until it gets quite dark,\" Edgar said. \"Have you any food,  for I am faint with hunger and loss of blood?\"    After he had finished his meal, the horses were handed over by the Arabs  to the care of one of their neighbours, with whom they had made  acquaintance. The rough tent was pulled down in order that they might  wrap the dark blankets over them to conceal their white clothing.    \"You had better leave your pistols behind,\" Edgar said, \"but take your  knives; we may come across some ruffians engaged in robbing the dead,  and the knives may come in useful. I hope that, as is most likely, the  French have sent down parties from the forts to watch the gates, so as  to prevent any of the leaders in the trouble from making their escape;  but some plunderers may well have come across from Old Cairo, so it is  as well to be armed. Take your lances also, not for fighting, but to  make a litter with, should we find either the chief or his son.\"    The sun had set a short time before they started, but the moon would not  rise for another hour, and they were unnoticed, or, at least,  unquestioned as they went round towards Fort Dupres. Indeed, they  encountered no one on the way. The din of battle had been succeeded by a  dead silence, no sound was heard from the city, whose population were  awe-stricken by the events of the day, and terrified by the expectation  of further acts of vengeance by the French. Those in the suburbs had  heard but vague rumours of the fighting in the streets and of the  massacre at the mosque, but they had learned from fugitives of the  defeat of the great sortie, and knew that the insurrection had been  completely crushed. The moon was just rising when Edgar and his  companions reached the spot between Fort Dupres and the city walls,  where the fight had taken place.    The bodies lay thickly piled here at the spots where the struggle had  been fiercest. For a time they found none save those of the men of the  city, but after two hours' search they came upon a number of Arabs,  whose white garments showed up clearly in the moonlight. Lying among  them were many bodies of French cavalrymen, showing that the Bedouins  had sold their lives dearly. Body after body was carefully examined, a  few were found to be still living, and as the Arabs had, at Edgar's  orders, brought water-skins with them, they were able to give some  little aid to these. Presently they came to a spot where the bodies were  more closely heaped than elsewhere and almost as many French as Arabs  lay together.    \"Now, search most carefully,\" he whispered, \"this is where the last  stand was evidently made.\"    The greatest caution was indeed necessary, for the fort lay a couple of  hundred yards away, and the French sentries could be plainly made out  against the sky-line as they marched backwards and forwards. Presently  one of the Arabs uttered a low exclamation. Lying by the side of his  dead horse, and surrounded by the bodies of five or six French  cavalry-men, lay the sheik. His white dress was dabbled with blood, one  side of his face was laid open by a sabre cut, and four or five patches  of blood at various points of his dress pointed to the existence of  other wounds. Edgar knelt beside him and placed his ear to his heart.    \"Thank God, he still lives!\" he exclaimed; \"give me your water-skin;  Hassan, lift his head.\" Edgar poured a little water between the sheik's  lips, sprinkled some on his face, and then, tearing off a strip of his  garment, brought together the edges of the wound in the face, from which  blood was still slowly oozing, laid a wad of rag along it, and then  bound it tightly with the bandage.    \"We must see to the other wounds after we have got him away,\" he said.  \"Now, Hassan, do you two bind one of those spare blankets to the shaft  of the two spears, wind it round them until the sides are not more than  three feet apart.\"    While the men were doing this he continued to allow a few drops of water  to trickle between the sheik's lips. When the stretcher was ready it was  laid on the ground beside him; he was gently lifted on to it, the cloak  strapped to his horse's saddle was placed under his head, and the other  spare blanket thrown over him. Then the two Arabs lifted the ends of the  spears on to their shoulders, and, led by Edgar, made their way from the  scene of conflict. When they had gone half a mile they laid the sheik  down.    \"Do you stay here, Ali; pour a little water between his lips  occasionally. Hassan and I will go back and look for Sidi.\"    The sheik was lifted from the blanket, and Hassan, shouldering the  litter, they returned at a rapid pace to the spot where they had found  the sheik. They had already made a hasty search here before leaving, but  without success, and now examined with the greatest care the body of  every Arab who had fallen near the spot, for Edgar made sure that,  unless he had been previously stricken down, Sidi would have fallen near  his father. Again their hunt was unsuccessful. Then they widened their  circle until after three hours' search they became convinced that he was  not among those who had fallen on the field, that he had either been  killed in the city, made prisoner, or escaped altogether. When at last  convinced that further search would be useless, they returned to the  spot where they had left the sheik.    \"He has opened his eyes,\" Ali said, \"and murmured two or three words,  but I could not hear what he said.\"    \"There are hopes at any rate that he is not mortally wounded,\" Edgar  said. \"Now let us go on again with him; do you two each take one of the  spears at his head, I will take my place at his feet; we shall get on  faster so.\"    Bearing down towards the river, they reached, after an hour's fast  walking, a grove of palm-trees near a village.    \"We will leave him here,\" Edgar said; \"it must be five miles from the  town. The French will have enough to do to-day without searching for  wounded. Do you two stay with him. If he becomes sensible and wants  anything, here is some money,"]]]
