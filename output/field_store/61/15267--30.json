THE RUSSIAN SITUATION IN 1918.--In spite of the Brest-Litovsk  treaties, the Allies continued to regard Russia as a friendly nation.  President Wilson took the lead in this attitude. It was felt that the  Russian people were sadly in need of assistance, but just how this  should be given was a serious problem.    The question was complicated by the presence in Russia of a large army  of Czecho-Slovaks (check'o-slovaks'). These soldiers were natives of the  northwestern Slavic provinces of Austria-Hungary. They had been part of  the Austrian army during the victorious Russian campaigns in Galicia and  had been taken prisoners. The Czecho-Slovaks had always sympathized with  the Allied countries and had fought for Austria unwillingly. Many,  indeed, had later fought as part of the Russian army. When Russia left  the war they feared that they might be returned to the hated Austrian  government. To avoid this their leaders sought and obtained from the  Bolshevik government permission to travel eastward through Russia and  Siberia to the Pacific. Here they planned to take ship and after a  voyage three quarters around the globe take their place in the armies of  the Allies. The long journey began. Then the Bolsheviki, probably acting  under German orders, recalled the permission they had given. The  Czecho-Slovaks went on nevertheless, determined to proceed even if they  had to fight their way. They were opposed at different points by  Bolshevik troops with the assistance of organized bodies of German and  Austrian prisoners, but the Czecho-Slovaks were victorious. In fact,  with the aid of anti-Bolshevik Russians they seized control of most of  the Siberian railroad, and of parts of eastern Russia.    ALLIED INTERVENTION IN RUSSIA.--At last the Allied nations and the  United States decided that it was time to undertake military  intervention in Russia. This was carried out in two places. Bodies of  American and Japanese troops were landed on the east coast of Siberia to  cooeperate with the Czecho-Slovaks. The latter, thus reenforced, changed  their plans for leaving Russia and decided to fight for the Allied cause  where they were. They were encouraged by the fact that they were  recognized by the Allies and by the United States as an independent  nation.    Another small Allied army was landed on the north coast of Russia and  marched south against the Bolsheviki. Large parts of Russia north and  east of Moscow declared themselves free of Bolshevik rule. It was the  hope of the Allies that that rule--now marked by pillage, murder, and  famine--would shortly be overthrown and that a new Russia would rise and  take its place among the democracies of the world.    THE WESTERN FRONT.--Early in 1918, after the failure of the German  peace offensive in the west, rumors came from Germany of preparations  for a great military drive on the western front. The \"iron fist\" and the  \"shining sword\" were to break in the doors of those who opposed a  German-made peace. There were good reasons for such an attack in the  spring of 1918. Germany had withdrawn many troops from the east, where  they were no longer needed to check the Russians. Further, although a  few American troops had reached France, it was thought that not many  could be sent over before the fall of 1918, and the full weight of  America's force could not be exerted before the summer of 1919. It was  to Germany's interest to crush France and England before the power of  the American nation was thrown into the struggle against her.    GERMANY'S NEW PLAN OF ATTACK.--The German military leaders therefore  determined to stake everything upon one grand offensive on the western  front while their own force was numerically superior to that of the  Allies. Their expectation of victory in what they proudly called the  \"Kaiser's battle,\" was based not only upon the possession of greater  numbers, but also upon the introduction of new methods of fighting which  would overcome the old trench warfare. The new methods comprised three  principal features.    In the first place, much greater use was made of the element of  surprise. Large masses of men were brought up near the front by night  marches, and in daytime were hidden from airplane observation by smoke  screens, camouflage of various kinds, and by the shelter of woodlands.  In this way any portion of the opposing trench line could be subjected  to a heavy, unexpected attack.    Secondly, the advance was prepared for by the use of big guns in  enormous quantities and in new ways. The number of guns brought into use  in this offensive far exceeded that put into the Verdun offensive of  1916, which had been looked upon as the extreme of possible  concentration of artillery. The shell fire was now to be directed not  only against the trenches, but also far to the rear of the Allied  positions. This would break up roads, railways, and bridges for many  miles behind the trenches and prevent the sending of reinforcements up  to the front. Vast numbers of large shells containing poisonous  \"mustard\" gas were collected. These were to be fired from heavy guns and  made to explode far behind the Allied lines. By this means suffocation  might be spread among the reserves, among motor drivers, and even among  the army mules, and by deranging the transport service make it  impossible to concentrate troops to withstand the German advance.    In the third place, \"shock\" troops composed of selected men from all  divisions of the army, were to advance after the bombardment, in a  series of \"waves.\" When the first wave had reached the limit of its  strength and endurance, it was to be followed up by a second mass of  fresh troops, and this by a third, and so on until the Allies' defense  was completely broken.    By their excess in numbers and by these newly devised methods of warfare  the German leaders hoped to accomplish three things: (1) to separate the  British army from the French army; (2) to seize the Channel ports and  interrupt by submarines and big guns the transportation of men and  supplies from England to France; and (3) to capture Paris and compel the  French to withdraw from the war. Let us now see how and why the Germans  failed to secure any one of these three objectives, and how the Allied  forces resumed the offensive in the summer of 1918.    THE GERMAN ADVANCE.--Five great drives, conducted according to the  newly devised methods of warfare, were launched by the Germans between  March 21 and July 15, 1918. The first, continuing from March 21 to April  1, called the battle of Picardy, was directed at the point where the  British army joined that of the French near the Somme River. There was  at this time no unified command of all the Allied armies, and the blow  fell unexpectedly upon the British and won much territory before French  assistance could be brought up. Outnumbered three to one, the British  fell back at the point of greatest retreat to a distance of thirty miles  from their former line. But the extreme tenacity of the British and the  arrival of French troops prevented the Germans from capturing the  important city of Amiens (ah-my[)a]n'), or reaching the main roads to  Paris, or separating the British and French armies. Learning a needed  lesson from this disaster, the Allied nations agreed to a unified  military command, and appointed as commander-in-chief the French General  Foch (fosh), who had distinguished himself in the first battle of the  Marne in 1914 and elsewhere. Before this step had been taken General  Pershing had offered his small army of 200,000 Americans to be used  wherever needed by the French and the British.    The second German offensive began on April 9 and was again directed  against the British, this time farther to the north, in Flanders,  between the cities of Ypres and Arras. In ten days the Germans advanced  to a maximum depth of ten miles on a front of thirty miles. But the  British fought most desperately and the German losses were enormous. At  last the advance was checked and the Channel ports were saved. \"Germany  on the march had encountered England at bay\"--and had failed to destroy  the heroic British army.    And now came a lull of over a month while the Germans were reorganizing  their forces and preparing for a still greater blow. Again the element  of surprise was employed. The Allies expected another attack somewhere  in the line from Soissons to the sea, and their reserves were so  disposed as to meet such an attack. But the German blow was directed  against the weakest part of the Allied line, the stretch from Rheims to  Soissons, where a break might open the road to Paris from the east. The  third drive began on May 27. For over a week the French were pushed  back, fighting valiantly, across land which had not seen the enemy since  September, 1914. The greatest depth of the German advance was thirty  miles, that is, to within forty-four miles of Paris. The enemy had once  again reached the Marne River and controlled the main roads from Paris  to Verdun and to the eastern parts of the Allied line.    The fourth drive started a few days later, on June 9, in a region where  an attack was expected. It resulted in heavy losses to the Germans, who  succeeded in pushing only six miles toward Paris in the region between  Soissons and Montdidier (mawn-dee-dy[=a]'). The advantages of a single  command had begun to appear. General Foch could use all the Allied  forces where they were most needed.    [Illustration: WESTERN FRONT]    The fifth drive opened on July 15 and spread over a front of one hundred  miles east of Soissons. The Allies were fully prepared, and while  falling back a little at first, the American and French troops soon won  back some of the abandoned territory.

Salman el Faris, another witness, declares that he afterwards  approached the Prophet and stood before him and asked him, \"From which  of thy descendants, O Apostle of God, shall the Mohdy be?\" And the  Prophet answered, stretching his hand towards his grandson Huseyn, \"From  this child shall he come.\"    Besides this general belief, which, though not a positive dogma of their  faith, is common to all Mussulmans, the Shiites, always prone to  exaggerate and embellish, maintain that the Mohdy's duty is not limited  to teaching, guiding, and purifying the law, but also that he shall  revenge the blood unjustly shed of the Imams; and they cite in support  of this a tradition of Ali ibn Abu Taleb, who thus addressed his son,  Huseyn, the same who was afterwards martyred at Kerbela, \"I swear to  thee, O my son,\" he said, \"I swear by my soul, and by my offspring, and  by Kerbela, and by its temple, that the day shall come in which our  beards shall be dyed with blood. And I swear that afterwards God shall  raise up a man, the Mohdy, who shall stand in our place, the lord of  mankind. He it is who shall avenge us, nay, he shall avenge thy blood  also, O Huseyn. Therefore have patience. For the blood of one man he  shall shed the blood of a thousand; and he will not spare them who have  helped our enemies.\"    The Shiites say also that this Mohdy will be no new personage, but that  he lives already in the flesh, being no other than the twelfth and last  of their recognized Imams, who was born in the year 260 of the Hejira,  and whose name was Mohammed ibn El Hassan, Abul Kassem, El Mohdy, Lord  of the Command and Lord of Time; and who, while yet a child, disappeared  from the world, retaining nevertheless his authority. This Mohdy they  expect _when the Turkish rule is in decay_. After accomplishing his  vengeance and re-establishing justice he shall rule for an undetermined  period, when Jesus the Son of Mary also shall come, and the Apostle  Mohammed, an apparition which will announce the end of the world.[16]    It would seem, therefore, exceedingly probable that out of the religious  ferment which we now see agitating Africa some enthusiast will arise who  will announce himself as this Mohdy, and head an active movement of  reform. Already, indeed, two such personages have made their appearance,  one in Tripoli, of whom I heard much talk a year ago, and who is now  said to be marching to join the defenders of Keruan; and a second quite  recently in Soudan. It is not difficult to imagine the kind of  reformation such an inspired Guide would preach. Indeed his role is  marked out for him in the prophecies just quoted. He would purge the  earth of injustice with the sword, and, breaking with all authority but  that of the Koran he would seek to renew a kingdom of heaven on the  model of Islam militant. It would be a repetition, but on a grander  scale, of the Wahhabite movement of the eighteenth century, and, having  a wider base of operations in the vast fanatical masses of North Africa,  might achieve far more important results.    Even without pretending to the rank of an inspired guide, it is certain  that a man of zeal and character might in the present crisis easily  persuade the Malekite Arabs to reform their moral practice, if necessary  to asceticism, by proving to them that they would thus regain their  ascendancy in arms. On this basis a reformation would be easy; but it  would be analogous to that of the Hussites and Anabaptists in Europe,  rather than of the true Church reformation which succeeded these, and  would hardly be universal or permanent.    I once heard a most distinguished Alem describe the qualifications of  one who should preach a reform of this kind:--\"The man,\" said he, \"who  would persuade us to reform must come, in the first place, of a  well-recognized family. He must be either a prince, or a Sherif, or an  hereditary saint. This would secure him from a first personal attack on  the ground of seeming impiety. He must secondly be an Arab, gifted with  the pure language of the Koran, for the Arabian Ulema would not listen  to a barbarian; and he must possess commanding eloquence. A reformer  must before all else be a preacher. Thirdly, he must be profoundly  learned, that is to say, versed in all the subtleties of the law and in  all that has been written in commentary on the Koran; and he must have a  ready wit, so that in argument he may be able constantly to oppose  authority with authority, quotation with quotation. Granted these three  qualifications and courage and God's blessing, he may lead us where he  will.\"    The chief obstacles, however, to a reformation of this sort would not be  in the beginning, nor would they be wholly moral ones. The full  programme of the Mohdy needs that he should conquer Mecca; and the land  road thither of an African reformer lies blocked by Egypt and the Suez  Canal. So that, unless he should succeed in crossing the Red Sea through  Abyssinia (an invasion which, by the way, would fulfil another ancient  prophecy, which states that the \"Companions of the Elephant,\" the  Abyssinians, shall one day conquer Hejaz), he could not carry out his  mission. Nor, except as an ally against the Turk, would a fanatical  reformer now find much sympathy in Arabia proper. The Peninsular Arabs  have had their Puritan reformation already, and a strong reaction has  set in amongst them in favour of liberal thought. They are in favour  still of reform, but it is of another kind from that preached by Abd el  Wahhab; and it is doubtful whether a new militant Islam would find many  adherents amongst them.    The only strong advocate of such views at the present day among true  Arabs in Arabia is the aged Sherif, Abd el Mutalleb, the Sultan's  nominee, who indeed has spared no pains, since he was installed at  Mecca, to fan the zeal of the North Africans. A Wahhabi in his youth, he  is still a fierce Puritan; and it is possible that, should he live long  enough (he is said to be ninety years old), he may be able to produce a  corresponding zeal in Arabia. But at present the mass of the Arabs in  Hejaz, no less than in Nejd and Yemen, are occupied with more humane  ideas. Abd el Mutalleb's chief supporters in Mecca are not his own  countrymen, but the Indian colony, descendants many of them of the Sepoy  refugees who fled thither in 1857, and who have the reputation of being  the most fanatical of all its residents. The true Arabs are in revolt  against his authority.    Again, it is improbable that any enunciation of Puritan reform would  find support among the northern races of Asia, which are uniformly sunk  in gross sensuality and superstition; while Constantinople may be  trusted to oppose all reform whatever. Wahhabism, when it overspread  Southern Asia, never gained a foothold further north than Syria, and  broke itself to pieces at last against the corrupt orthodoxy of  Constantinople. And so too it would happen now. Abd el Hamid, in spite  of his zeal for Islam, would see in the preaching of a moral reform only  a new heresy; and, as we have seen, the Mohdy's mission is against all  evil rule, the Sultan's and Caliph's not excepted. So that, unless Abd  el Hamid places himself openly at the head of the warlike movement in  Africa and so forestalls a rival, he is not likely long to give it his  loyal support. Already there are symptoms of his regarding events in  Tunis with suspicion, and on the first announcement of an inspired  reformer he would, I believe, not hesitate to pronounce against him. I  understand the Turkish military reinforcements at Tripoli quite as much  in the light of a precaution against Arab reform as against infidel  France.    Puritanism, then, on a militant basis, even if preached by the Mohdy  himself, could hardly be either general or lasting, and its best result  would probably be, that after a transient burst of energy, which would  rouse the thought of Islam and renew her spiritual life, a humaner  spirit, as in Arabia would take its place, and lead to a more lasting,  because a more rational, reform.    But it was not to such a Puritan reformation that I was pointing when I  expressed my conviction that Islam would in the end work out her  salvation, nor do I hold it necessary that she should find any such  _deus ex machina_ as an inspired guide to point her out her road. Her  reformation is indeed already begun, and may be gradually carried to its  full results, by no violent means, and in a progressive, not a  reactionary spirit. This only can be the true one, for it is a law of  nations and of faiths, no less than of individuals, that they cannot  really return upon their years, and that all beneficial changes for them  must be to new conditions of life, not to old ones--to greater  knowledge, not to less--to freedom of thought, not to its enslavement.  Nor is there anything in the true principles of Islam to make such  progress an unnatural solution of her destiny.    Mohammedanism in its institution, and for many centuries after its  birth, was eminently a rationalistic creed; and it was through reason  as well as faith that it first achieved its spiritual triumphs. If we  examine its bases its early history, we must indeed admit this. The  Koran, which we are accustomed to speak of as the written code of  Mohammedan law, is in reality no legal text-book by which Mussulmans  live. At best it enunciates clearly certain religious truths, the unity  of God, the doctrine of rewards and punishments in "]]]
