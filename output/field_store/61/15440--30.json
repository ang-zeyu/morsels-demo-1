I did hate to go all  the way next door and all the way back, through the white snow, under  the white stars, invisible company keeping step with me.           *       *       *       *       *    And I remember my playmates.    There was always a crowd of us girls. We were a mixed set,--rich  little girls, well-to-do little girls, and poor little girls,--but not  because we were so democratic. Rather it came about, if my sister and  I are considered the centre of the ring, because we had suffered the  several grades of fortune. In our best days no little girls had to  stoop to us; in our humbler days we were not so proud that we had to  condescend to our chance neighbors. The granddaughters of Raphael the  Russian, in retaining their breeding and manners, retained a few of  their more exalted friends, and became a link between them and those  whom they later adopted through force of propinquity.    We were human little girls, so our amusements mimicked the life about  us. We played house, we played soldiers, we played Gentiles, we  celebrated weddings and funerals. We copied the life about us  literally. We had not been to a Froebel kindergarten, and learned to  impersonate butterflies and stones. Our elders would have laughed at  us for such nonsense. I remember once standing on the river bank with  a little boy, when a quantity of lumber was floating down on its way  to the distant sawmill. A log and a board crowded each other near  where we stood. The board slipped by first, but presently it swerved  and swung partly around. Then it righted itself with the stream and  kept straight on, the lazy log following behind. Said Zalmen to me,  interpreting: \"The board looks back and says, 'Log, log, you will not  go with me? Then I will go on by myself.'\" That boy was called simple,  on account of such speeches as this. I wonder in what language he is  writing poetry now.    We had very few toys. Neither Fetchke nor I cared much for dolls. A  rag baby apiece contented us, and if we had a set of jackstones we  were perfectly happy. Our jackstones, by the way, were not stones but  bones. We used the knuckle bones of sheep, dried and scraped; every  little girl cherished a set in her pocket.    I did not care much for playing house. I liked soldiers better, but it  was not much fun without boys. Boys and girls always played apart.    I was very fond of playing Gentiles. I am afraid I liked everything  that was a little risky. I particularly enjoyed being the corpse in a  Gentile funeral. I was laid across two chairs, and my playmates, in  borrowed shawls and long calicoes, with their hair loose and with  candlesticks in their hands, marched around me, singing unearthly  songs, and groaning till they scared themselves. As I lay there,  covered over with a black cloth, I felt as dead as dead could be; and  my playmates were the unholy priests in gorgeous robes of velvet and  silk and gold. Their candlesticks were the crosiers that were carried  in Christian funeral processions, and their chantings were hideous  incantations to the arch enemy, the Christian God of horrible images.  As I imagined the bareheaded crowds making way for my funeral to pass,  my flesh crept, not because I was about to be buried, but because the  people _crossed themselves_. But our procession stopped outside the  church, because we did not dare to carry even our make-believe across  that accursed threshold. Besides, none of us had ever been  inside,--God forbid!--so we did not know what did happen next.    When I arose from my funeral I was indeed a ghost. I felt unreal and  lost and hateful. I don't think we girls liked each other much after  playing funeral. Anyway, we never played any more on the same day; or  if we did, we soon quarrelled. Such was the hold which our hereditary  terrors and hatreds had upon our childish minds that if we only mocked  a Christian procession in our play, we suffered a mutual revulsion of  feeling, as if we had led each other into sin.    We gathered oftener at our house than anywhere else. On Sabbath days  we refrained, of course, from soldiering and the like, but we had just  as good a time, going off to promenade, two and two, in our very best  dresses; whispering secrets and telling stories. We had a few stories  in the circle--I do not know how they came to us--and these were told  over and over. Gutke knew the best story of all. She told the story of  Aladdin and the Wonderful Lamp, and she told it well. It was her  story, and nobody else ever attempted it, though I, for one, soon had  it by heart. Gutke's version of the famous tale was unlike any I have  since read, but it was essentially the story of Aladdin, so that I was  able to identify it later when I found it in a book. Names, incidents,  and \"local color\" were slightly Hebraized, but the supernatural  wonders of treasure caves, jewelled gardens, genii, princesses, and  all, were not in the least marred or diminished. Gutke would spin the  story out for a long afternoon, and we all listened entranced, even at  the hundredth rehearsal. We had a few other fairy stories,--I later  identified them with stories of Grimm's or of Andersen's,--but for the  most part the tales we told were sombre and unimaginative; tales our  nurses used to tell to frighten us into good behavior.    Sometimes we spent a whole afternoon in dancing. We made our own  music, singing as we danced, or somebody blew on a comb with a bit of  paper over its teeth; and comb music is not to be despised when there  is no other sort. We knew the polka and the waltz, the mazurka, the  quadrille, and the lancers, and several fancy dances. We did not  hesitate to invent new steps or figures, and we never stopped till we  were out of breath. I was one of the most enthusiastic dancers. I  danced till I felt as if I could fly.    Sometimes we sat in a ring and sang all the songs we knew. None of us  were trained,--we had never seen a sheet of music--but some of us  could sing any tune that was ever heard in Polotzk, and the others  followed half a bar behind. I enjoyed these singing-bees. We had  Hebrew songs and Jewish and Russian; solemn songs, and jolly songs,  and songs unfit for children, but harmless enough on our innocent  lips. I enjoyed the play of moods in these songs--I liked to be  harrowed one minute and tickled the next. I threw all my heart into  the singing, which was only fair, as I had very little voice to throw  in.    Although I always joined the crowd when any fun was on foot, I think I  had the best times by myself. My sister was fond of housework, but  I--I was fond of idleness. While Fetchke pottered in the kitchen  beside the maid or trotted all about the house after my grandmother, I  wasted time in some window corner, or studied the habits of the cow  and the chickens in the yard. I always found something to do that was  of no use to anybody. I had no particular fondness for animals; I  liked to see what they did, merely because they were curious. The red  cow would go to meet my grandmother as she came out of the kitchen  with a bucket of bran for her. She drank it up in no time, the greedy  creature, in great loud gulps; and then she stood with dripping  nostrils over the empty bucket, staring at me on the other side. I  teased grandmother to give the cow more, because I enjoyed her  enjoyment of it. I wondered, if I ate from a bucket instead of a  plate, should I take so much more pleasure in my dinner? That red cow  liked everything. She liked going to pasture, and she liked coming  back, and she stood still to be milked, as if she liked that too.    The chickens were not all alike. Some of them would not let me catch  them, while others stood still till I took them up. There were two  that were particularly tame, a white hen and a speckled one. In  winter, when they were kept in the house, my sister and I had these  two for our pets. They let us handle them by the hour, and stayed just  where we put them. The white hen laid her eggs in a linen chest made  of bark. We would take the warm egg to grandmother, who rolled it on  our eyes, repeating this charm: \"As this egg is fresh, so may your  eyes be fresh. As this egg is sound, so may your eyes be sound.\" I  still like to touch my eyelids with a fresh-laid egg, whenever I am so  happy as to possess one.    On the horses in the barn I bestowed the same calm attention as on the  cow, speculative rather than affectionate. I was not a very  tender-hearted infant. If I have been a true witness of my own growth,  I was slower to love than I was to think. I do not know when the  change was wrought, but to-day, if you ask my friends, they will tell  you that I know how to love them better than to solve their problems.  And if you will call one more witness, and ask me, I shall say that if  you set me down before a noble landscape, I feel it long before I  begin to see it.    Idle child though I was, the day was not long enough sometimes for my  idleness. More than once in the pleasant summer I stole out of bed  when even the cow was still drowsing, and went barefoot through the  dripping grass and stood at the gate, awaiting the morning. I found a  sense of adventure in being conscious when all other people were  asleep. There was not much of a prospect from the gateway, but in  that early hour everything looked new and large to me, even the little  houses that yesterday had been so familiar. The houses, when creatures  went in and out of them, were merely conventional objects; in the soft  gray morning they were themselves creatures. Some stood up straight,  and some leaned, and some looked as if they saw me. And then over the  dewy gardens rose the sun, and the light spread and grew over  everything, till it shone on my bare feet. And in my heart grew a  great wonder, and I was ready to cry, my world was so strange and  sweet about me. In those moments, I think, I could have loved somebody  as"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20897"],[0,"A Short History of England (#20)"],[1,"likely to reply. The  modern world had begun. The call echoed unanswered down the ages; for  since that day no English king has fought after that fashion. Having  slain many, he was himself slain and his diminished force destroyed. So  ended the war of the usurpers; and the last and most doubtful of all the  usurpers, a wanderer from the Welsh marches, a knight from nowhere,  found the crown of England under a bush of thorn.          XI    THE REBELLION OF THE RICH      Sir Thomas More, apart from any arguments about the more mystical meshes  in which he was ultimately caught and killed, will be hailed by all as a  hero of the New Learning; that great dawn of a more rational daylight  which for so many made mediaevalism seem a mere darkness. Whatever we  think of his appreciation of the Reformation, there will be no dispute  about his appreciation of the Renascence. He was above all things a  Humanist and a very human one. He was even in many ways very modern,  which some rather erroneously suppose to be the same as being human; he  was also humane, in the sense of humanitarian. He sketched an ideal, or  rather perhaps a fanciful social system, with something of the ingenuity  of Mr. H. G. Wells, but essentially with much more than the flippancy  attributed to Mr. Bernard Shaw. It is not fair to charge the Utopian  notions upon his morality; but their subjects and suggestions mark what  (for want of a better word) we can only call his modernism. Thus the  immortality of animals is the sort of transcendentalism which savours of  evolution; and the grosser jest about the preliminaries of marriage  might be taken quite seriously by the students of Eugenics. He suggested  a sort of pacifism--though the Utopians had a quaint way of achieving  it. In short, while he was, with his friend Erasmus, a satirist of  mediaeval abuses, few would now deny that Protestantism would be too  narrow rather than too broad for him. If he was obviously not a  Protestant, there are few Protestants who would deny him the name of a  Reformer. But he was an innovator in things more alluring to modern  minds than theology; he was partly what we should call a Neo-Pagan. His  friend Colet summed up that escape from mediaevalism which might be  called the passage from bad Latin to good Greek. In our loose modern  debates they are lumped together; but Greek learning was the growth of  this time; there had always been a popular Latin, if a dog-Latin. It  would be nearer the truth to call the mediaevals bi-lingual than to call  their Latin a dead language. Greek never, of course, became so general a  possession; but for the man who got it, it is not too much to say that  he felt as if he were in the open air for the first time. Much of this  Greek spirit was reflected in More; its universality, its urbanity, its  balance of buoyant reason and cool curiosity. It is even probable that  he shared some of the excesses and errors of taste which inevitably  infected the splendid intellectualism of the reaction against the Middle  Ages; we can imagine him thinking gargoyles Gothic, in the sense of  barbaric, or even failing to be stirred, as Sydney was, by the trumpet  of \"Chevy Chase.\" The wealth of the ancient heathen world, in wit,  loveliness, and civic heroism, had so recently been revealed to that  generation in its dazzling profusion and perfection, that it might seem  a trifle if they did here and there an injustice to the relics of the  Dark Ages. When, therefore, we look at the world with the eyes of More  we are looking from the widest windows of that time; looking over an  English landscape seen for the first time very equally, in the level  light of the sun at morning. For what he saw was England of the  Renascence; England passing from the mediaeval to the modern. Thus he  looked forth, and saw many things and said many things; they were all  worthy and many witty; but he noted one thing which is at once a  horrible fancy and a homely and practical fact. He who looked over that  landscape said: \"Sheep are eating men.\"    This singular summary of the great epoch of our emancipation and  enlightenment is not the fact usually put first in such very curt  historical accounts of it. It has nothing to do with the translation of  the Bible, or the character of Henry VIII., or the characters of Henry  VIII.'s wives, or the triangular debates between Henry and Luther and  the Pope. It was not Popish sheep who were eating Protestant men, or  _vice versa_; nor did Henry, at any period of his own brief and rather  bewildering papacy, have martyrs eaten by lambs as the heathen had them  eaten by lions. What was meant, of course, by this picturesque  expression, was that an intensive type of agriculture was giving way to  a very extensive type of pasture. Great spaces of England which had  hitherto been cut up into the commonwealth of a number of farmers were  being laid under the sovereignty of a solitary shepherd. The point has  been put, by a touch of epigram rather in the manner of More himself, by  Mr. J. Stephen, in a striking essay now, I think, only to be found in  the back files of _The New Witness_. He enunciated the paradox that the  very much admired individual, who made two blades of grass grow instead  of one, was a murderer. In the same article, Mr. Stephen traced the true  moral origins of this movement, which led to the growing of so much  grass and the murder, or at any rate the destruction, of so much  humanity. He traced it, and every true record of that transformation  traces it, to the growth of a new refinement, in a sense a more rational  refinement, in the governing class. The mediaeval lord had been, by  comparison, a coarse fellow; he had merely lived in the largest kind of  farm-house after the fashion of the largest kind of farmer. He drank  wine when he could, but he was quite ready to drink ale; and science had  not yet smoothed his paths with petrol. At a time later than this, one  of the greatest ladies of England writes to her husband that she cannot  come to him because her carriage horses are pulling the plough. In the  true Middle Ages the greatest men were even more rudely hampered, but  in the time of Henry VIII. the transformation was beginning. In the next  generation a phrase was common which is one of the keys of the time, and  is very much the key to these more ambitious territorial schemes. This  or that great lord was said to be \"Italianate.\" It meant subtler shapes  of beauty, delicate and ductile glass, gold and silver not treated as  barbaric stones but rather as stems and wreaths of molten metal,  mirrors, cards and such trinkets bearing a load of beauty; it meant the  perfection of trifles. It was not, as in popular Gothic craftsmanship,  the almost unconscious touch of art upon all necessary things: rather it  was the pouring of the whole soul of passionately conscious art  especially into unnecessary things. Luxury was made alive with a soul.  We must remember this real thirst for beauty; for it is an  explanation--and an excuse.    The old barony had indeed been thinned by the civil wars that closed at  Bosworth, and curtailed by the economical and crafty policy of that  unkingly king, Henry VII. He was himself a \"new man,\" and we shall see  the barons largely give place to a whole nobility of new men. But even  the older families already had their faces set in the newer direction.  Some of them, the Howards, for instance, may be said to have figured  both as old and new families. In any case the spirit of the whole upper  class can be described as increasingly new. The English aristocracy,  which is the chief creation of the Reformation, is undeniably entitled  to a certain praise, which is now almost universally regarded as very  high praise. It was always progressive. Aristocrats are accused of being  proud of their ancestors; it can truly be said that English aristocrats  have rather been proud of their descendants. For their descendants they  planned huge foundations and piled mountains of wealth; for their  descendants they fought for a higher and higher place in the government  of the state; for their descendants, above all, they nourished every new  science or scheme of social philosophy. They seized the vast economic  chances of pasturage; but they also drained the fens. They swept away  the priests, but they condescended to the philosophers. As the new Tudor  house passes through its generations a new and more rationalist  civilization is being made; scholars are criticizing authentic texts;  sceptics are discrediting not only popish saints but pagan philosophers;  specialists are analyzing and rationalizing traditions, and sheep are  eating men.    We have seen that in the fourteenth century in England there was a real  revolution of the poor. It very nearly succeeded; and I need not conceal  the conviction that it would have been the best possible thing for all  of us if it had entirely succeeded. If Richard II. had really sprung  into the saddle of Wat Tyler, or rather if his parliament had not  unhorsed him when he had got there, if he had confirmed the fact of the  new peasant freedom by some form of royal authority, as it was already  common to confirm the fact of the Trade Unions by the form of a royal  charter, our country would probably have had as happy a history as is  possible to human nature. The Renascence, when it came, would have come  as popular education and not the culture of a club of aesthetics. The New  Learning might have been as democratic as the old learning in the old  days of mediaeval Paris and Oxford. The exquisite artistry of the school  of Cellini might have been but the highest grade of the craft of a  guild. The Shakespearean drama might have been acted by workmen on  wooden stages set up in the street like Punch and Judy, the finer  fulfilment of the miracle play as it was acted by a guild. The players  need not have been \"the king's servants,\""]]]
