Every spot so  touched confers immunity from pain upon the corresponding region of  their own bodies for the ensuing year. And so from year to year these  images are visited. Pain accordingly is almost absent from the city,  and only that man suffers pain who has the temerity to neglect the  opportunity of insuring himself against it.    I was called to a case of opium-poisoning in Chaotong. A son came in  casually to seek our aid in saving his father, who had attempted suicide  with a large over-dose of opium. He had taken it at ten in the morning  and it was now two. We were led to the house and found it a single small  unlit room up a narrow alley. In the room two men were unconcernedly  eating their rice, and in the darkness they seemed to be the only  occupants; but, lying down behind them on a narrow bed, was the dim  figure of the dying man, who was breathing stertorously. A crowd quickly  gathered round the door and pent up the alley-way. Rousing the man, I  caused him to swallow some pints of warm water, and then I gave him a  hypodermic injection of apomorphia. The effect was admirable, and  pleased the spectators even more than the patient.    Opium is almost exclusively the drug used by suicides. No Chinaman would  kill himself by the mutilation of the razor or pistol-shot because awful  is the future punishment of him who would so dare to disturb the  integrity of the body bequeathed to him by his fathers.    China is the land of suicides. I suppose more people die from suicide in  China in proportion to the population than in any other country. Where  the struggle for existence is so keen, it is hardly to be wondered at  that men are so willing to abandon the struggle. But poverty and misery  are not the only causes. For the most trivial reason the Chinaman will  take his own life. Suicide with a Chinaman is an act that is recorded in  his honour rather than to his opprobrium.    Thus a widow, as we have seen, may obtain much merit by sacrificing  herself on the death of her husband. But in a large proportion of cases  the motive is revenge, for the spirit of the dead is believed to \"haunt  and injure the living person who has been the cause of the suicide.\" In  China to ruin your adversary you injure or kill yourself. To vow to  commit suicide is the most awful threat with which you can drive terror  into the heart of your adversary. If your enemy do you wrong, there is  no way in which you can cause him more bitterly to repent his misdeed  than by slaying yourself at his doorstep. He will be charged with your  murder, and may be executed for the crime; he will be utterly ruined in  establishing, if he can establish, his innocence; and he will be haunted  ever after by your avenging spirit.    Occasionally two men who have quarrelled will take poison together, and  their spirits will fight it out in heaven. Opium is very cheap in  Chaotong, costing only fivepence an ounce for the crude article. You see  it exposed for sale everywhere, like thick treacle in dirty besmeared  jars. It is largely adulterated with ground pigskin, the adulteration  being detected by the craving being unsatisfied. Mohammedans have a holy  loathing of the pig, and look with contempt on their countrymen whose  chief meat-food is pork. But each one in his turn. It is, on the other  hand, a source of infinite amusement to the Chinese to see his  Mohammedan brother unwittingly smoking the unclean beast in his  opium-pipe.    On our way to the opium case we passed a doorway from which pitiful  screams were issuing. It was a mother thrashing her little boy with a  heavy stick--she had tethered him by the leg and was using the stick  with both hands. A Chinese proverb as old as the hills tells you, \"if  you love your son, give him plenty of the cudgel; if you hate him, cram  him with delicacies.\" He was a young wretch, she said, and she could do  nothing with him; and she raised her baton again to strike, but the  missionary interposed, whereupon she consented to stay her wrath and did  so--till we were round the corner.    \"Extreme lenity alternating with rude passion in the treatment of  children is the characteristic,\" says Meadows, \"of the lower stages of  civilisation.\" I mention this incident only because of its rarity. In no  other country in the world, civilised or \"heathen,\" are children  generally treated with more kindness and affection than they are in  China. \"Children, even amongst seemingly stolid Chinese, have the  faculty of calling forth the better feelings so often found latent.  Their prattle delights the fond father, whose pride beams through every  line of his countenance, and their quaint and winning ways and touches  of nature are visible even under the disadvantages of almond eyes and  shaven crowns\" (Dyer Ball).    A mother in China is given, both by law and custom, extreme power over  her sons whatever their age or rank. The Sacred Edict says, \"Parents are  like heaven. Heaven produces a blade of grass. Spring causes it to  germinate. Autumn kills it with frost. Both are by the will of heaven.  In like manner the power of life and death over the body which they have  begotten is with the parents.\"    And it is this law giving such power to a mother in China which tends,  it is believed, to nullify that other law whereby a husband in China is  given extreme power over his wife, even to the power in some cases of  life and death.    The Mohammedans are still numerous in Chaotong, and there are some 3000  families--the figures are Chinese--in the city and district. Their  numbers were much reduced during the suppression of the rebellion of  1857-1873, when they suffered the most awful cruelties. Again, thirteen  years ago, there was an uprising which was suppressed by the Government  with merciless severity. One street is exclusively occupied by Moslems,  who have in their hands the skin trade of the city. Their houses are  known by a conspicuous absence from door and window of the coloured  paper door-gods that are seen grotesquely glaring from the doors of the  unbelievers. Their mosque is well cared for and unusually clean. In the  centre, within the main doorway, as in every mosque in the empire, is a  gilt tablet of loyalty to the living Emperor. \"May the Emperor reign ten  thousand years!\" it says, a token of subjection which the mosques of  Yunnan have especially been compelled to display since the insurrection.  At the time of my visit an aged mollah was teaching Arabic and the Koran  to a ragged handful of boys. He spoke to me through an interpreter, and  gave me the impression of having some little knowledge of things outside  the four seas that surround China. I told him that I had lived under the  shelter of two of the greatest mosques, but he seemed to question my  contention that the mosque in Cordova and the Karouin mosque in Fez are  even more noble in their proportions than his mosque in Chaotong. In  some of the skin-hongs that I entered, the walls were ornamented with  coloured plans of Mecca and Medinah, bought in Chentu, the capital city  of the province of Szechuen.          CHAPTER X.    THE JOURNEY FROM CHAOTONG TO TONGCHUAN.      In Chaotong I engaged three new men to go with me to Tongchuan, a  distance of 110 miles, and I rewarded liberally the three excellent  fellows who had accompanied me from Suifu. My new men were all active  Chinamen. The headman Laohwan was most anxious to come with me.  Recognising that he possessed characteristics which his posterity would  rejoice to have transmitted to them, he had lately taken to himself a  wife and now, a fortnight later, he sought rest. He would come with me  to Burma, the further away the better; he wished to prove the truth of  the adage about distance and enchantment. The two coolies who were to  carry the loads were country lads from the district. My men were to  receive _4s. 6d._ each for the 110 miles, an excessive wage, but all  food was unusually dear, and people were eating maize instead of rice;  they were to find themselves on the way, in other words, they were \"to  eat their own rice,\" and, in return for a small reward, they were to  endeavour to do the five days' stages in three days. I bought a few  stores, including some excellent oatmeal and an annular cake of that  compressed tea, the \"Puerh-cha,\" which is grown in the Shan States and  is distributed as a luxury all over China. It is in favour in the palace  of the Emperor in Peking itself; it is one of the finest teas in China,  yet, to show how jealous the rivalry now is between China tea and  Indian, when I submitted the remainder of this very cake to a well-known  tea-taster in Mangoe Lane, Calcutta, and asked his expert opinion, he  reported that the sample was \"of undoubted value and of great interest,  as showing what _muck can be called tea_.\"    We left on the 3rd, and passed by the main-street through the crowded  city, past the rich wholesale warehouses, and out by the west gate to  the plain of Chaotong. The country spread before us was smiling and  rich, with many farmsteads, and orchards of pears and peaches--a pretty  sight, for the trees were now in full blossom. Many carts were lumbering  along the road on their uneven wheels. Just beyond the city there was a  noisy altercation in the road for the possession apparently of a blunt  adze. Carts stopped to see the row, and all the bystanders joined in  with their voices, with much earnestness. It is rare for the disputants  to be injured in these questions. Their language on these occasions is,  I am told, extremely rich in allusions. It would often make a _gendarme_  blush. Their oaths are more ornate than the Italians'; the art of  vituperation is far advanced in China. A strong wind was blowing in our  faces. We rested at some mud hovels where poverty was stalking about  with a stick in rags and nakedness.
