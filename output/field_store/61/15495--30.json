The little plot of ground the  Kafirs have cultivated is in a few years scarcely distinguishable from  the untouched surface of the surrounding land, while the mud-built hut  quickly disappears under the summer rains and the scarcely less  destructive efforts of the white ants. Here in South Africa the native  races seem to have made no progress for centuries, if, indeed, they have  not actually gone backward; and the feebleness of savage man  intensifies one's sense of the overmastering strength of nature. The  elephant and the buffalo are as much the masters of the soil as is the  Kafir, and man has no more right to claim that the land was made for him  than have the wild beasts of the forest who roar after their prey and  seek their meat from God.    These features of South African nature, its silence, its loneliness, its  drear solemnity, have not been without their influence upon the mind and  temper of the European settler. The most peculiar and characteristic  type that the country has produced is the Boer of the eastern plateau,  the offspring of those Dutch Africanders who some sixty years ago  wandered away from British rule into the wilderness. These men had, and  their sons and grandsons have retained, a passion for solitude that even  to-day makes them desire to live many miles from any neighbour, a sturdy  self-reliance, a grim courage in the face of danger, a sternness from  which the native races have often had to suffer. The majesty of nature  has not stimulated in them any poetical faculty. But her austerity,  joined to the experiences of their race, has contributed to make them  grave and serious, closely bound to their ancient forms of piety, and  prone to deem themselves the special objects of divine protection.          PART II    _A SKETCH OF SOUTH AFRICAN HISTORY_          CHAPTER VIII    THE NATIVES: HOTTENTOTS, BUSHMEN, AND KAFIRS      By far the most interesting features in the history of South Africa have  been the relations to one another of the various races that inhabit it.  There are seven of these races, three native and four European. The  European races, two of them, especially the Dutch and the English, are,  of course, far stronger, and far more important as political factors,  than are the natives. Nevertheless, the natives have an importance too,  and one so great that their position deserves to be fully set forth and  carefully weighed. For, though they are inferior in every point but one,  they are in that point strong. They are prolific. They already greatly  outnumber the whites, and they increase faster.    The cases of conflict or contact between civilized European man and  savage or semi-civilized aboriginal peoples, which have been very  numerous since the tide of discovery began to rise in the end of the  fifteenth century, may be reduced to three classes.    The first of these classes includes the cases where the native race,  though perhaps numerous, is comparatively weak, and unable to assimilate  European civilization, or to thrive under European rule (a rule which  has often been harsh), or even to survive in the presence of a European  population occupying its country. To this class belong such cases as the  extinction of the natives of the Antilles by the Spaniards, the  disappearance of the natives of Southern Australia and Tasmania before  British settlement, the dying out, or retirement to a few reserved  tracts, of the aborigines who once occupied all North America east of  the Rocky Mountains. The Russian advance in Siberia, the advance of  Spanish and Italian and German colonists in the territories of La Plata  in South America, may be added to this class, for though the phenomena  are rather those of absorption than of extinction, the result is  practically the same. The country becomes European and the native races  vanish.    An opposite class of cases arises where Europeans have conquered a  country already filled by a more or less civilized population, which is  so numerous and so prolific as to maintain itself with ease in their  presence. Such a case is the British conquest of India. The Europeans in  India are, and must remain, a mere handful among the many millions of  industrious natives, who already constitute, in many districts, a  population almost too numerous for the resources of the country to  support. Moreover, the climate is one in which a pure European race  speedily dwindles away. The position of the Dutch in Java, and of the  French in Indo-China, is similar; and the French in Madagascar will  doubtless present another instance.    Between these two extremes lies a third group of cases--those in which  the native race is, on the one hand, numerous and strong enough to  maintain itself in the face of Europeans, while, on the other hand,  there is plenty of room left for a considerable European population to  press in, climatic conditions not forbidding it to spread and multiply.  To this group belong such colonizations as those of the Spaniards in  Mexico and Peru, of the Russians in parts of Central Asia, of the French  in Algeria and Tunis, of the Spaniards in the Canary Isles, and of the  English and Americans in Hawaii. In all these countries the new race and  the old race can both live and thrive, neither of them killing off or  crowding out the other, though in some, as in Hawaii, the natives tend  to disappear, while in others, as in Algeria, the immigrants do not much  increase. Sometimes, as in the Canary Isles and Mexico, the two elements  blend, the native element being usually more numerous, though less  advanced; and a mixed race is formed by intermarriage. Sometimes they  remain, and seem likely to remain, as distinct as oil is from water.    South Africa belongs to this third class of cases. The Dutch and the  English find the country a good one and become fond of it. There is  plenty of land for them. They enjoy the climate. They thrive and  multiply. But they do not oust the natives, except sometimes from the  best lands, and the contact does not reduce the number of the latter.  The native--that is to say, the native of the Kafir race--not merely  holds his ground, but increases far more rapidly than he did before  Europeans came, because the Europeans have checked intertribal wars and  the slaughter of the tribesmen by the chiefs and their wizards, and also  because the Europeans have opened up new kinds of employment. As,  therefore, the native will certainly remain, and will, indeed, probably  continue to be in a vast majority, it is vital to a comprehension of  South African problems to know what he has been and may be expected to  become.    The native races are three, and the differences between them are marked,  being differences not only of physical appearance and of language, but  also of character, habits, and grade of civilization. These three are  the Bushmen, the Hottentots, and those Bantu tribes whom we call Kafirs.    The Bushmen were, to all appearance, the first on the ground, the real  aborigines of South Africa. They are one of the lowest races to be found  anywhere, as low as the Fuegians or the \"black fellows\" of Australia,  though perhaps not quite so low as the Veddahs of Ceylon or the now  extinct natives of Tasmania. They seem to have been originally  scattered over all South Africa, from the Zambesi to the Cape, and so  late as eighty years ago were almost the only inhabitants of Basutoland,  where now none of them are left. They were nomads of the most primitive  type, neither tilling the soil nor owning cattle, but living on such  wild creatures as they could catch or smite with their poisoned arrows,  and, when these failed, upon wild fruits and the roots of plants. For  the tracking and trapping of game they had a marvellous faculty, such as  neither the other races nor any European could equal. But they had no  organization, not even a tribal one, for they wandered about in small  groups; and no religion beyond some vague notion of ghosts, and of  spirits inhabiting or connected with natural objects; while their  language was a succession of clicks interrupted by grunts. Very low in  stature, and possibly cognate to the pygmies whom Mr. H.M. Stanley found  in Central Africa, they were capable of enduring great fatigue and of  travelling very swiftly. Untamably fierce unless caught in childhood,  and incapable of accustoming themselves to civilized life, driven out of  some districts by the European settlers, who were often forced to shoot  them down in self-defence, and in other regions no longer able to find  support owing to the disappearance of the game, they are now almost  extinct, though a few remain in the Kalahari Desert and the adjoining  parts of northern Bechuanaland and western Matabililand, toward Lake  Ngami. I saw at the Kimberley mines two or three dwarf natives who were  said to have Bushmen blood in them, but it is no longer easy to find in  the Colony a pure specimen. Before many years the only trace of their  existence will be in the remarkable drawings of wild animals with which  they delighted to cover the smooth surfaces of sheltered rocks. These  drawings, which are found all the way from the Zambesi to the Cape, and  from Manicaland westward, are executed in red, yellow, and black  pigments, and are often full of spirit. Rude, of course, they are, but  they often convey the aspect, and especially the characteristic  attitude, of the animal with great fidelity.    The second native race was that which the Dutch called Hottentot, and  whom the Portuguese explorers found occupying the maritime region in the  south-west corner of the continent, to the east and to the north of the  Cape of Good Hope.

Something in his  manner told George that the child was bursting with schemes for his  benefit.    \"Have some more cake, Albert,\" he said ingratiatingly.    The boy shook his head.    \"Do,\" urged George. \"Just a little slice.\"    \"There ain't no little slice,\" replied Albert with regret.  \"I've ate it all.\" He sighed and resumed. \"I gotta scheme!\"    \"Fine! What is it?\"    Albert knitted his brows.    \"It's like this. You want to see 'er lidyship, but you can't come  to the castle, and she can't come to you--not with 'er fat brother  dogging of 'er footsteps. That's it, ain't it? Or am I a liar?\"    George hastened to reassure him.    \"That is exactly it. What's the answer?\"    \"I'll tell yer wot you can do. There's the big ball tonight 'cos of  its bein' 'Is Nibs' comin'-of-age tomorrow. All the county'll be  'ere.\"    \"You think I could slip in and be taken for a guest?\"    Albert snorted contempt.    \"No, I don't think nothin' of the kind, not bein' a fat-head.\"  George apologized. \"But wot you could do's this. I 'eard Keggs  torkin to the 'ouse-keeper about 'avin' to get in a lot of temp'y  waiters to 'elp out for the night--\"    George reached forward and patted Albert on the head.    \"Don't mess my 'air, now,\" warned that youth coldly.    \"Albert, you're one of the great thinkers of the age. I could get  into the castle as a waiter, and you could tell Lady Maud I was  there, and we could arrange a meeting. Machiavelli couldn't have  thought of anything smoother.\"    \"Mac Who?\"    \"One of your ancestors. Great schemer in his day. But, one moment.\"    \"Now what?\"    \"How am I to get engaged? How do I get the job?\"    \"That's orl right. I'll tell the 'ousekeeper you're my cousin--  been a waiter in America at the best restaurongs--'ome for a  'oliday, but'll come in for one night to oblige. They'll pay yer a  quid.\"    \"I'll hand it over to you.\"    \"Just,\" said Albert approvingly, \"wot I was goin' to suggest  myself.\"    \"Then I'll leave all the arrangements to you.\"    \"You'd better, if you don't want to mike a mess of everything. All  you've got to do is to come to the servants' entrance at eight  sharp tonight and say you're my cousin.\"    \"That's an awful thing to ask anyone to say.\"    \"Pardon?\"    \"Nothing!\" said George.        CHAPTER 12.    The great ball in honour of Lord Belpher's coming-of-age was at its  height. The reporter of the Belpher Intelligencer and Farmers'  Guide, who was present in his official capacity, and had been  allowed by butler Keggs to take a peep at the scene through a  side-door, justly observed in his account of the proceedings next  day that the 'tout ensemble was fairylike', and described the  company as 'a galaxy of fair women and brave men'. The floor was  crowded with all that was best and noblest in the county; so that a  half-brick, hurled at any given moment, must infallibly have spilt  blue blood. Peers stepped on the toes of knights; honorables bumped  into the spines of baronets. Probably the only titled person in the  whole of the surrounding country who was not playing his part in  the glittering scene was Lord Marshmoreton; who, on discovering  that his private study had been converted into a cloakroom, had  retired to bed with a pipe and a copy of Roses Red and Roses White,  by Emily Ann Mackintosh (Popgood, Crooly & Co.), which he was to  discover--after he was between the sheets, and it was too late to  repair the error--was not, as he had supposed, a treatise on his  favourite hobby, but a novel of stearine sentimentality dealing  with the adventures of a pure young English girl and an artist  named Claude.    George, from the shaded seclusion of a gallery, looked down upon  the brilliant throng with impatience. It seemed to him that he had  been doing this all his life. The novelty of the experience had  long since ceased to divert him. It was all just like the second  act of an old-fashioned musical comedy (Act Two:  The Ballroom,  Grantchester Towers: One Week Later)--a resemblance which was  heightened for him by the fact that the band had more than once  played dead and buried melodies of his own composition, of which he  had wearied a full eighteen months back.    A complete absence of obstacles had attended his intrusion into the  castle. A brief interview with a motherly old lady, whom even  Albert seemed to treat with respect, and who, it appeared was Mrs.  Digby, the house-keeper; followed by an even briefer encounter with  Keggs (fussy and irritable with responsibility, and, even while  talking to George carrying on two other conversations on topics of  the moment), and he was past the censors and free for one night  only to add his presence to the chosen inside the walls of Belpher.  His duties were to stand in this gallery, and with the assistance  of one of the maids to minister to the comfort of such of the  dancers as should use it as a sitting-out place. None had so far  made their appearance, the superior attractions of the main floor  having exercised a great appeal; and for the past hour George had  been alone with the maid and his thoughts. The maid, having asked  George if he knew her cousin Frank, who had been in America nearly  a year, and having received a reply in the negative, seemed to be  disappointed in him, and to lose interest, and had not spoken for  twenty minutes.    George scanned the approaches to the balcony for a sight of Albert  as the shipwrecked mariner scans the horizon for the passing sail.  It was inevitable, he supposed, this waiting. It would be difficult  for Maud to slip away even for a moment on such a night.    \"I say, laddie, would you mind getting me a lemonade?\"    George was gazing over the balcony when the voice spoke behind him,  and the muscles of his back stiffened as he recognized its genial  note. This was one of the things he had prepared himself for, but,  now that it had happened, he felt a wave of stage-fright such as he  had only once experienced before in his life--on the occasion when  he had been young enough and inexperienced enough to take a  curtain-call on a first night. Reggie Byng was friendly, and would  not wilfully betray him; but Reggie was also a babbler, who could  not be trusted to keep things to himself. It was necessary, he  perceived, to take a strong line from the start, and convince  Reggie that any likeness which the latter might suppose that he  detected between his companion of that afternoon and the waiter of  tonight existed only in his heated imagination.    As George turned, Reggie's pleasant face, pink with healthful  exercise and Lord Marshmoreton's finest Bollinger, lost most of its  colour. His eyes and mouth opened wider. The fact is Reggie was  shaken. All through the earlier part of the evening he had been  sedulously priming himself with stimulants with a view to amassing  enough nerve to propose to Alice Faraday: and, now that he had  drawn her away from the throng to this secluded nook and was about  to put his fortune to the test, a horrible fear swept over him that  he had overdone it. He was having optical illusions.    \"Good God!\"    Reggie loosened his collar, and pulled himself together.    \"Would you mind taking a glass of lemonade to the lady in blue  sitting on the settee over there by the statue,\" he said carefully.    He brightened up a little.    \"Pretty good that! Not absolutely a test sentence, perhaps, like  'Truly rural' or 'The intricacies of the British Constitution'.  But nevertheless no mean feat.\"    \"I say!\" he continued, after a pause.    \"Sir?\"    \"You haven't ever seen me before by any chance, if you know what I  mean, have you?\"    \"No, sir.\"    \"You haven't a brother, or anything of that shape or order, have  you, no?\"    \"No, sir. I have often wished I had. I ought to have spoken to  father about it. Father could never deny me anything.\"    Reggie blinked. His misgiving returned. Either his ears, like his  eyes, were playing him tricks, or else this waiter-chappie was  talking pure drivel.    \"What's that?\"    \"Sir?\"    \"What did you say?\"    \"I said, 'No, sir, I have no brother'.\"    \"Didn't you say something else?\"    \"No, sir.\"    \"What?\"    \"No, sir.\"    Reggie's worst suspicions were confirmed.    \"Good God!\" he muttered. \"Then I am!\"    Miss Faraday, when he joined her on the settee, wanted an  explanation.    \"What were you talking to that man about, Mr. Byng? You seemed to  be having a very interesting conversation.\"    \"I was asking him if he had a brother.\"    Miss Faraday glanced quickly at him. She had had a feeling for some  time during the evening that his manner had been strange.    \"A brother? What made you ask him that?\"    \"He--I mean--that is to say--what I mean is, he looked the sort of  chap who might have a brother. Lots of those fellows have!\"    Alice Faraday's face took on a motherly look. She was fonder of  Reggie than that love-sick youth supposed, and by sheer accident he  had stumbled on the right road to her consideration. Alice Faraday  was one of those girls whose dream it is to be a ministering angel  to some chosen man, to be a good influence to him and raise him to  an appreciation of nobler things. Hitherto, Reggie's personality  had seemed to her agreeable, but negative. A positive vice like  over-indulgence in alcohol altered him completely. It gave him a  significance.    \"I told him to get you a lemonade,\" said Reggie. \"He seems to be  taking his time about it. Hi!\"    George approached deferentially.    \"Sir?\"    \"Where's that lemonade?\"    \"Lemonade, sir?\"    \"Didn't I ask you to bring this lady a glass of lemonade?\"    \"I did not understand you to do so, sir.\"    \"But, Great Scott! What were we chatting about, then?\"    \"You were telling me a diverting story about an Irishman who landed  "]]]
