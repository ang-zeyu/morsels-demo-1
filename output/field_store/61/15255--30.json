There he stood, with his  bright auburn hair (now rather badger-pied, perhaps, but still very  passable by candlelight)--his bright auburn hair, we say, swept boldly off  his lofty forehead, his hazy grey eyes flashing with the excitement of  drink and animation, his left hand reposing on the hip of his well-fitting  black pantaloons, while the right one, radiant with rings, and trimmed with  upturned wristband, sawed the air, as he rounded off the periods of the  well-accustomed saws.    Jawleyford, like a good many people, was very hospitable when in full  fig--two soups, two fishes, and the necessary concomitants; but he would  see any one far enough before he would give him a dinner merely because he  wanted one. That sort of ostentatious banqueting has about brought country  society in general to a deadlock. People tire of the constant revision of  plate, linen, and china.    Mrs. Jawleyford, on the other hand, was a very rough-and-ready sort of  woman, never put out of her way; and though she constantly preached the old  doctrine that girls 'are much better single than married,' she was always  on the look-out for opportunities of contradicting her assertions.    She was an Irish lady, with a pedigree almost as long as Jawleyford's, but  more compressible pride, and if she couldn't get a duke, she would take a  marquis or an earl, or even put up with a rich commoner.    The perusal, therefore, of Sponge's letter, operated differently upon her  to what it did upon her husband, and though she would have liked a little  more time, perhaps, she did not care to take him as they were. Jawleyford,  however, resisted violently. It would be most particularly inconvenient to  him to receive company at that time. If Mr. Sponge had gone through the  whole three hundred and sixty-five days in the year, he could not have hit  upon a more inconvenient one for him. Besides, he had no idea of people  writing in that sort of a way, saying they were coming, without giving him  the chance of saying no. 'Well, but, my dear, I dare say you asked him,'  observed Mrs. Jawleyford.    Jawleyford was silent, the scene in the billiard-room recurring to his  mind.    'I've often told you, my dear,' continued Mrs. Jawleyford, kindly, 'that  you shouldn't be so free with your invitations if you don't want people to  come; things are very different now to what they were in the old coaching  and posting days, when it took a day and a night and half the next day to  get here, and I don't know how much money besides. You might then invite  people with safety, but it is very different now, when they have nothing to  do but put themselves into the express train and whisk down in a few  hours.'    'Well, but, confound him, I didn't ask his horses,' exclaimed Jawleyford;  'nor will I have them either,' continued he, with a jerk of the head, as he  got up and rang the bell, as though determined to put a stop to that at all  events.    'Samuel,' said he, to the dirty page of a boy who answered the summons,  'tell John Watson to go down to the Railway Tavern directly, and desire  them to get a three-stalled stable ready for a gentleman's horses that are  coming to-day--a gentleman of the name of Sponge,' added he, lest any one  else should chance to come and usurp them--'and tell John to meet the  express train, and tell the gentleman's groom where it is.'          CHAPTER XIV    JAWLEYFORD COURT      True to a minute, the hissing engine drew the swiftly gliding train beneath  the elegant and costly station at Lucksford--an edifice presenting a rare  contrast to the wretched old red-tiled, five-windowed house, called the Red  Lion, where a brandy-faced blacksmith of a landlord used to emerge from  the adjoining smithy, to take charge of any one who might arrive per coach  for that part of the country. Mr. Sponge was quickly on the platform,  seeing to the detachment of his horse-box.    Just as the cavalry was about got into marching order, up rode John Watson,  a ragamuffin-looking gamekeeper, in a green plush coat, with a very  tarnished laced hat, mounted on a very shaggy white pony, whose hide seemed  quite impervious to the visitations of a heavily-knotted dogwhip, with  which he kept saluting his shoulders and sides.    'Please, sir,' said he, riding up to Mr. Sponge, with a touch of the old  hat, 'I've got you a capital three-stall stable at the Railway Tavern,  here,' pointing to a newly built brick house standing on the rising ground.    'Oh! but I'm going to Jawleyford Court,' responded our friend, thinking the  man was the 'tout' of the tavern.    'Mr. Jawleyford don't take in horses, sir,' rejoined the man, with another  touch of the hat.    'He'll take in _mine_,' observed Mr. Sponge, with an air of authority.    'Oh, I beg pardon, sir,' replied the keeper, thinking he had made a  mistake; 'it was Mr. Sponge whose horses I had to bespeak stalls for,'  touching his hat profusely as he spoke.    'Well, _this_ be Mister Sponge,' observed Leather, who had been listening  attentively to what passed.    ''Deed!' said the keeper, again turning to our hero with an 'I beg pardon,  sir, but the stable _is_ for you then, sir--for Mr. Sponge, sir.'    'How do you know that?' demanded our friend.    ''Cause Mr. Spigot, the butler, says to me, says he, \"Mr. Watson,\" says  he--my name's Watson, you see,' continued the speaker, sawing away at his  hat, 'my name's Watson, you see, and I'm the head gamekeeper. \"Mr. Watson,\"  says he, \"you must go down to the tavern and order a three-stall stable for  a gentleman of the name of Sponge, whose horses are a comin' to-day\"; and  in course I've come 'cordingly,' added Watson. 'A _three_-stall'd stable!'  observed Mr. Sponge, with an emphasis.    'A three-stall'd stable,' repeated Mr. Watson.    'Confound him, but he said he'd take in a hack at all events,' observed  Sponge, with a sideway shake of the head; 'and a hack he _shall_ take in,  too' he added. 'Are your stables full at Jawleyford Court?' he asked.    ''Ord bless you, no, sir,' replied Watson with a leer; 'there's nothin' in  them but a couple of weedy hacks and a pair of old worn-out  carriage-horses.'    'Then I can get this hack taken in, at all events,' observed Sponge, laying  his hand on the neck of the piebald as he spoke.    'Why, as to that,' replied Mr. Watson, with a shake of the head, 'I can't  say nothin'.'    'I must, though,' rejoined Sponge, tartly; 'he _said_ he'd take in my hack,  or I wouldn't have come.'    'Well, sir,' observed the keeper, 'you know best, sir.'    'Confounded screw!' muttered Sponge, turning away to give his orders to  Leather. 'I'll _work_ him for it,' he added. 'He sha'n't get rid of _me_ in  a hurry--at least, not unless I can get a better billet elsewhere.'    Having arranged the parting with Leather, and got a cart to carry his  things, Mr. Sponge mounted the piebald, and put himself under the guidance  of Watson to be conducted to his destination. The first part of the journey  was performed in silence, Mr. Sponge not being particularly well pleased at  the reception his request to have his horses taken in had met with. This  silence he might perhaps have preserved throughout had it not occurred to  him that he might pump something out of the servant about the family he was  going to visit.    'That's not a bad-like old cob of yours,' he observed, drawing rein so as  to let the shaggy white come alongside of him.    'He belies his looks, then,' replied Watson, with a grin of his cadaverous  face, 'for he's just as bad a beast as ever looked through a bridle. It's a  parfect disgrace to a gentleman to put a man on such a beast.'    Sponge saw the sort of man he had got to deal with, and proceeded  accordingly.    'Have you lived long with Mr. Jawleyford?' he asked.    'No, nor will I, if I can help it,' replied Watson, with another grin and  another touch of the old hat. Touching his hat was about the only piece of  propriety he was up to.    'What, he's not a brick, then?' asked Sponge.    'Mean man,' replied Watson with a shake of the head; 'mean man,' he  repeated. 'You're nowise connected with the fam'ly, I s'pose?' he asked  with a look of suspicion lest he might be committing himself.    'No,' replied Sponge; 'no; merely an acquaintance. We met at Laverick  Wells, and he pressed me to come and see him.'    'Indeed!' said Watson, feeling at ease again.    'Who did you live with before you came here?' asked Mr. Sponge, after a  pause.    'I lived many years--the greater part of my life, indeed--with Sir Harry  Swift. _He_ was a _real_ gentleman now, if you like--free, open-handed  gentleman--none of your close-shavin', cheese-parin' sort of gentlemen, or  imitation gentlemen, as I calls them, but a man who knew what was due to  good servants and gave them it. We had good wages, and all the proper  \"reglars.\" Bless you, I could sell a new suit of clothes there every year,  instead of having to wear the last keeper's cast-offs, and a hat that would  disgrace anything but a flay-crow. If the linin' wasn't stuffed full of  gun-waddin' it would be over my nose,' he observed, taking it off and  adjusting the layer of wadding as he spoke.    'You should have stuck to Sir Harry,' observed Mr. Sponge.    'I did,' rejoined Watson. 'I did, I stuck to him to the last. I'd have been  with him now, only he couldn't get a manor at Boulogne, and a keeper was of  no use without one.'    'What, he went to Boulogne, did he?' observed Mr. Sponge.    'Aye, the more's the pity,' replied Watson. 'He was a gentleman, every inch  of him,' he added, with a shake of the head and a sigh, as if recurring to  more prosperous times. 'He was what a gentleman ought to be,' he continued,  'not one of your poor, pryin', inquisitive critturs, what's always fancyin'  themselves cheated. I ordered everything in my department, and paid for it  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16960"],[0,"History of the United States (#20)"],[1,"numbers among  the centers of discontent. Merchants again agreed not to import British  goods, the Sons of Liberty renewed their agitation, and women set about  the patronage of home products still more loyally.    On the night of March 5, 1770, a crowd on the streets of Boston began to  jostle and tease some British regulars stationed in the town. Things  went from bad to worse until some \"boys and young fellows\" began to  throw snowballs and stones. Then the exasperated soldiers fired into the  crowd, killing five and wounding half a dozen more. The day after the  \"massacre,\" a mass meeting was held in the town and Samuel Adams was  sent to demand the withdrawal of the soldiers. The governor hesitated  and tried to compromise. Finding Adams relentless, the governor yielded  and ordered the regulars away.    The Boston Massacre stirred the country from New Hampshire to Georgia.  Popular passions ran high. The guilty soldiers were charged with murder.  Their defense was undertaken, in spite of the wrath of the populace, by  John Adams and Josiah Quincy, who as lawyers thought even the worst  offenders entitled to their full rights in law. In his speech to the  jury, however, Adams warned the British government against its course,  saying, that \"from the nature of things soldiers quartered in a populous  town will always occasion two mobs where they will prevent one.\" Two of  the soldiers were convicted and lightly punished.    =Resistance in the South.=--The year following the Boston Massacre some  citizens of North Carolina, goaded by the conduct of the royal governor,  openly resisted his authority. Many were killed as a result and seven  who were taken prisoners were hanged as traitors. A little later royal  troops and local militia met in a pitched battle near Alamance River,  called the \"Lexington of the South.\"    =The _Gaspee_ Affair and the Virginia Resolutions of 1773.=--On sea as  well as on land, friction between the royal officers and the colonists  broke out into overt acts. While patrolling Narragansett Bay looking for  smugglers one day in 1772, the armed ship, _Gaspee_, ran ashore and was  caught fast. During the night several men from Providence boarded the  vessel and, after seizing the crew, set it on fire. A royal commission,  sent to Rhode Island to discover the offenders and bring them to  account, failed because it could not find a single informer. The very  appointment of such a commission aroused the patriots of Virginia to  action; and in March, 1773, the House of Burgesses passed a resolution  creating a standing committee of correspondence to develop cooeperation  among the colonies in resistance to British measures.    =The Boston Tea Party.=--Although the British government, finding the  Townshend revenue act a failure, repealed in 1770 all the duties except  that on tea, it in no way relaxed its resolve to enforce the other  commercial regulations it had imposed on the colonies. Moreover,  Parliament decided to relieve the British East India Company of the  financial difficulties into which it had fallen partly by reason of the  Tea Act and the colonial boycott that followed. In 1773 it agreed to  return to the Company the regular import duties, levied in England, on  all tea transshipped to America. A small impost of three pence, to be  collected in America, was left as a reminder of the principle laid down  in the Declaratory Act that Parliament had the right to tax the  colonists.    This arrangement with the East India Company was obnoxious to the  colonists for several reasons. It was an act of favoritism for one  thing, in the interest of a great monopoly. For another thing, it  promised to dump on the American market, suddenly, an immense amount of  cheap tea and so cause heavy losses to American merchants who had large  stocks on hand. It threatened with ruin the business of all those who  were engaged in clandestine trade with the Dutch. It carried with it an  irritating tax of three pence on imports. In Charleston, Annapolis, New  York, and Boston, captains of ships who brought tea under this act were  roughly handled. One night in December, 1773, a band of Boston citizens,  disguised as Indians, boarded the hated tea ships and dumped the cargo  into the harbor. This was serious business, for it was open, flagrant,  determined violation of the law. As such the British government viewed  it.      RETALIATION BY THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT    =Reception of the News of the Tea Riot.=--The news of the tea riot in  Boston confirmed King George in his conviction that there should be no  soft policy in dealing with his American subjects. \"The die is cast,\" he  stated with evident satisfaction. \"The colonies must either triumph or  submit.... If we take the resolute part, they will undoubtedly be very  meek.\" Lord George Germain characterized the tea party as \"the  proceedings of a tumultuous and riotous rabble who ought, if they had  the least prudence, to follow their mercantile employments and not  trouble themselves with politics and government, which they do not  understand.\" This expressed, in concise form, exactly the sentiments of  Lord North, who had then for three years been the king's chief minister.  Even Pitt, Lord Chatham, was prepared to support the government in  upholding its authority.    =The Five Intolerable Acts.=--Parliament, beginning on March 31, 1774,  passed five stringent measures, known in American history as the five  \"intolerable acts.\" They were aimed at curing the unrest in America. The  _first_ of them was a bill absolutely shutting the port of Boston to  commerce with the outside world. The _second_, following closely,  revoked the Massachusetts charter of 1691 and provided furthermore that  the councilors should be appointed by the king, that all judges should  be named by the royal governor, and that town meetings (except to elect  certain officers) could not be held without the governor's consent. A  _third_ measure, after denouncing the \"utter subversion of all lawful  government\" in the provinces, authorized royal agents to transfer to  Great Britain or to other colonies the trials of officers or other  persons accused of murder in connection with the enforcement of the law.  The _fourth_ act legalized the quartering of troops in Massachusetts  towns. The _fifth_ of the measures was the Quebec Act, which granted  religious toleration to the Catholics in Canada, extended the boundaries  of Quebec southward to the Ohio River, and established, in this western  region, government by a viceroy.    The intolerable acts went through Parliament with extraordinary  celerity. There was an opposition, alert and informed; but it was  ineffective. Burke spoke eloquently against the Boston port bill,  condemning it roundly for punishing the innocent with the guilty, and  showing how likely it was to bring grave consequences in its train. He  was heard with respect and his pleas were rejected. The bill passed both  houses without a division, the entry \"unanimous\" being made upon their  journals although it did not accurately represent the state of opinion.  The law destroying the charter of Massachusetts passed the Commons by a  vote of three to one; and the third intolerable act by a vote of four to  one. The triumph of the ministry was complete. \"What passed in Boston,\"  exclaimed the great jurist, Lord Mansfield, \"is the overt act of High  Treason proceeding from our over lenity and want of foresight.\" The  crown and Parliament were united in resorting to punitive measures.    In the colonies the laws were received with consternation. To the  American Protestants, the Quebec Act was the most offensive. That  project they viewed not as an act of grace or of mercy but as a direct  attempt to enlist French Canadians on the side of Great Britain. The  British government did not grant religious toleration to Catholics  either at home or in Ireland and the Americans could see no good motive  in granting it in North America. The act was also offensive because  Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Virginia had, under their charters,  large claims in the territory thus annexed to Quebec.    To enforce these intolerable acts the military arm of the British  government was brought into play. The commander-in-chief of the armed  forces in America, General Gage, was appointed governor of  Massachusetts. Reinforcements were brought to the colonies, for now King  George was to give \"the rebels,\" as he called them, a taste of strong  medicine. The majesty of his law was to be vindicated by force.      FROM REFORM TO REVOLUTION IN AMERICA    =The Doctrine of Natural Rights.=--The dissolution of assemblies, the  destruction of charters, and the use of troops produced in the colonies  a new phase in the struggle. In the early days of the contest with the  British ministry, the Americans spoke of their \"rights as Englishmen\"  and condemned the acts of Parliament as unlawful, as violating the  principles of the English constitution under which they all lived. When  they saw that such arguments had no effect on Parliament, they turned  for support to their \"natural rights.\" The latter doctrine, in the form  in which it was employed by the colonists, was as English as the  constitutional argument. John Locke had used it with good effect in  defense of the English revolution in the seventeenth century. American  leaders, familiar with the writings of Locke, also took up his thesis in  the hour of their distress. They openly declared that their rights did  not rest after all upon the English constitution or a charter from the  crown. \"Old Magna Carta was not the beginning of all things,\" retorted  Otis when the constitutional argument failed. \"A time may come when  Parliament shall declare every American charter void, but the natural,  inherent, and inseparable rights of the colonists as men and as citizens  would remain and whatever became of charters can never"]]]
