That is a salkar. Such are  larger than a hundred fish! Salkars driven in ... they might even wreck  this undersea ship with their weight and anger.\"    \"And you can find these salkars near-by?\" Ross began to take fire. That  dragon which had hunted him--the bulk of the thing was well above any  other sea life he had seen here. And to its ferocity he could give  testimony.    \"At the spawning reefs. We do not hunt at this season which is the time  of the taking of mates. Now, too, they are easily angered so they will  even attack a cruiser. To slay them at present is a loss, for their  skins are not good. But they would be ripe for battle were they to be  disturbed.\"    \"And how would you get them from the spawning reefs to Kyn Add?\"    \"That is not too difficult; the reef lies here.\" Torgul drew lines with  the point of his sword on the table top. \"And here is Kyn Add. Salkars  have a great hunger at this time. Show them bait and they will follow;  especially will they follow swimming bait.\"    There were a great many holes in the plan which had only a halfway  chance of working. But the Rovers seized upon it with enthusiasm, and so  it was set up.    Perhaps some two hours later Ross swam toward the land mass of Kyn Add.  Gleams of light pricked on the shore well to his left. Those must mark  the Rover settlement. And again the Terran wondered why the invaders had  remained there. Unless they knew that there had been three cruisers out  on a raid and for some reason they were determined to make a complete  mop-up.    Karara moved a little to his right, Taua between them, the dolphin's  super senses their guide and warning. The swiftest of the cruisers had  departed, Loketh on board to communicate with Tino-rau in the water.  Since the male dolphin was the best equipped to provide a fox for salkar  hounds, he was the bait for this weird fishing expedition.    \"No farther!\" Ross's sonic pricked a warning against his body. Through  that he took a jolt which sent him back, away from the bay entrance.    \"On the reef.\" Karara's tapped code drew him on a new course. Moments  later they were both out of the water, though the wash of waves over  their flippered feet was constant. The rocks among which they crouched  were a rough harborage from which they could see the shore as a dark  blot. But they were well away from the break in the reef through which,  if their outlandish plan succeeded, the salkars would come.    \"A one-in-a-million chance!\" Ross commented as he put up his mask.    \"Was not the whole Time Agent project founded on just such chances?\"  Karara asked the right question. This was Ross's kind of venture. Yes,  one-in-a-million chances had been pulled off by the Time Agents. Why, it  had been close to those odds against their ever finding what they had  first sought along the back trails of time--the wrecked spaceships.    Just suppose this could be a rehearsal for another attack? If the  salkars could be made to crack the guard of the Baldies, could they also  be used against the Foanna gate? Maybe.... But take one fight at a time.    \"They come!\" Karara's fingers gripped Ross's shoulder. Her hand was  hard, bar rigid. He could see nothing, hear nothing. That warning must  have come from the dolphins. But so far their plan was working; the  monsters of the Hawaikan sea were on their way.          12    Baldies      \"Ohhhh!\" Karara clutched at Ross, her breath coming in little gasps,  giving vent to her fear and horror. They had not known what might come  from this plan; certainly neither had foreseen the present chaos in the  lagoon.    Perhaps the broadcast energy of the enemy whipped the already  vicious-tempered salkars into this insane fury. But now the moonlit  water was beaten into foam as the creatures fought there, attacking each  other with a ferocity neither Terran had witnessed before.    Lights gleamed along the shore where the alien invaders must have been  drawn by the clamor of the fighting marine reptiles. Somewhere in the  heights above the beach of the lagoon a picked band of Rovers should now  be making their way from the opposite side of Kyn Add under strict  orders not to go into attack unless signaled. Whether the independent  sea warriors would hold to that command was a question which had worried  Ross from the first.    Tino-rau and Taua in the waters to the seaward of the reef, the two  Terrans on that barrier itself, and between them and the shore the wild  melee of maddened salkars. Ross started. The sonic warning which had  been pulsing steadily against his skin cut off sharply. The broadcast in  the bay had been silenced! This was the time to move, but no swimmer  could last in the lagoon itself.    \"Along the reef,\" Karara said.    That would be the long way round, Ross knew, but the only one possible.  He studied the cluster of lights ashore. Two or three figures moved  there. Seemingly the attention of the aliens was well centered upon the  battle still in progress in the lagoon.    \"Stay here!\" he ordered the girl. Adjusting his mask, Ross dropped into  the water, cutting away from the reef and then turning to swim parallel  with it. Tino-rau matched him as he went, guiding Ross to a second break  in the reef, toward the shore some distance from where the conflict of  the salkars still made a hideous din in the night.    The Terran waded in the shallows, stripping off his flippers and  snapping them to his belt, letting his mask swing free on his chest. He  angled toward the beach where the aliens had been. At least he was  better armed for this than he had been when he had fronted the Rovers  with only a diver's knife. From the Time Agent supplies he had taken the  single hand weapon he had long ago found in the armory of the derelict  spaceship. This could only be used sparingly, since they did not know  how it could be recharged, and the secret of its beam still remained  secret as far as Terran technicians were concerned.    Ross worked his way to a curtain of underbrush from which he had a free  view of the beach and the aliens. Three of them he counted, and they  were Baldies, all right--taller and thinner than his own species, their  bald heads gray-white, the upper dome of their skulls overshadowing the  features on their pointed chinned faces. They all wore the skintight  blue-purple-green suits of the space voyagers--suits which Ross knew of  old were insulated and protective for their wearers, as well as a medium  for keeping in touch with one another. Just as he, wearing one, had once  been trailed over miles of wilderness.    To him, all three of the invaders looked enough alike to have been  stamped out from one pattern. And their movements suggested that they  worked or went into action with drilled precision. They all faced  seaward, holding tubes aimed at the salkar-infested lagoon. There was no  sound of any explosion, but green spears of light struck at the scaled  bodies plunging in the water. And where those beams struck, flesh  seared. Methodically the trio raked the basin. But, Ross noted, those  beams which had been steady at his first sighting, were now interrupted  by flickers. One of the Baldies upended his tube, rapped its butt  against a rock as if trying to correct a jamming. When the alien went  into action once again his weapon flashed and failed. Within a matter of  moments the other two were also finished. The lighted rods pushed into  the sand, giving a glow to the scene, darkened as a fire might sink to  embers. Power fading?    An ungainly shape floundered out of the churned water, lumbered over the  shale of the beach, its supple neck outstretched, its horned nose down  for a gore-threatening charge. Ross had not realized that the salkars  could operate out of what he thought was their natural element, but this  wild-eyed dragon was plainly bent on reaching its tormentors.    For a moment or two the Baldies continued to front the creature, almost,  Ross thought, as if they could not believe that their weapons had failed  them. Then they broke and ran back to the fairing which they had taken  with such contemptuous ease. The salkar plowed along in their wake, but  its movements grew more labored the farther it advanced, until at last  it lay with only its head upraised, darting it back and forth, its  fanged jaws well agape, voicing a coughing howl.    Its plaint was answered from the water as a second of its kind wallowed  ashore. A terrible wound had torn skin and flesh just behind its neck;  yet still it came on, hissing and bubbling a battle challenge. It did  not attack its fellow; instead it dragged its bulk past the first comer,  on its way after the Baldies.    The salkars continued to come ashore, two more, a third, a fourth,  mangled and torn--pulling themselves as far as they could up the beach.  To lie, facing inland, their necks weaving, their horned heads bobbing,  their cries a frightful din. What had drawn them out of their  preoccupation of battle among themselves into this attempt to reach the  aliens, Ross could not determine. Unless the intelligence of the beasts  was such that they had been able to connect the searing beams which the  Baldies had turned on them so tellingly with the men on the beach, and  had responded by striving to reach a common enemy.    But no desire could give them the necessary energy to pull far ashore.  Almost helplessly beached, they continued to dig into the yielding sand  with their flippers in a vain effort to pursue the aliens.    Ross skirted the clamoring barrier of salkars and headed for the  fairing. A neck snapped about; a head was lowered in his direction. He  smelled the rank stench of reptile combined"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19676"],[0,"Shakespeare and Music (#20)"],[1,"seven planets ... have a rhythmical motion and distances adapted to  musical intervals, and emit sounds, every one different in proportion  to its height [Saturn was said to be the highest, as it is the  farthest away, and was supposed to give the gravest note of the  heavenly Diapason, which note was therefore called Hypate, or  'highest'], which sounds are so concordant as to produce a most sweet  melody, though _inaudible to us by reason of the greatness of the  sounds_, which the narrow passages of our ears are not capable of  admitting.'    These extracts fairly represent the ancient opinion about the Music of  the spheres. There was a strong tendency last century to revive the  notion, and even to our modern ideas, with our Copernican astronomy,  there remains at least the possibility of drawing fantastical  analogies between the proportionate distances of the planets and the  proportionate vibration numbers of the partial tones in a musically  vibrating string or pipe.    The idea of the musical Chorus or dance of the heavenly bodies was  perfectly familiar to all writers in the 16th and 17th centuries. An  excellent example is in Paradise Lost, Book V., in the twelve lines  beginning 'So spake the Omnipotent.' Even finer is the 13th verse of  the Nativity Hymn.         'Ring out, ye crystal spheres,       Once bless our human ears,       If ye have power to touch our senses so;       And let your silver chime       Move in melodious time,       And let the bass of heaven's deep organ blow;       And, with your nine-fold harmony,       Make up full concert to the angelic symphony.'    No one could help thinking of the text in Job xxxviii. 7, 'When the  morning stars sang together,' in this connection, and Milton naturally  refers to it in the previous verse.    Here follow the two Shakespeare extracts. The second one is full of  beauty of every kind, but the Pythagoreanism is in the last six lines,  with Shakespeare's own view about _why_ we cannot hear the heavenly  music.    _As You Like It_ II, vii, 5.         _Duke Senior_ [of Jaques].            If he, _compact of jars_, grow musical,            We shall have shortly _discord in the spheres_.    _Merchant_ V, i, 51.         _Lor._ My friend Stephano, signify, I pray you,            Within the house, your mistress [Portia] is at hand;            And _bring your music forth into the air_.         [_Exit_ STEPHANO.         (Lorenzo and Jessica alone.)         _Lor._ How sweet the moonlight sleeps upon this bank!            Here we will sit, and _let the sounds of music            Creep in our ears: soft stillness and the night,            Become the touches of sweet harmony_.                *       *       *       *       *         L. 60.              There's not the _smallest orb_, which thou behold'st,            _But in his motion like an angel sings_,            Still _quiring_ to the young-ey'd cherubims;            Such harmony is in immortal souls;            But, _whilst this muddy vesture of decay            Doth grossly close it in, we cannot hear it_.    This is finer than Pythagoras.    The next three passages are concerned with the 'fantasie' of Music.  Jaques gives an opinion in a general form--viz., that the musician's  'melancholy' is 'fantastical'; Mariana and the Duke speak of a certain  _doubleness_ that may be noticed in the action of music on the mind.  Jessica is 'never merry' when she hears sweet music: Lorenzo descants  on the evident effects of music on even hardened natures; while  Portia and Nerissa preach a neat little sermon on the text 'Nothing is  good without respect,' with musical illustrations of the powerful  influence of time and place--_e.g._, the silence of night, makes the  music sound sweeter than by day; the crow sings as well as the lark,  if the circumstances favour the crow, or if the lark is not present to  give immediate comparison; and even the nightingale's song is no  better than the wren's, 'by day, when every goose is cackling.'    _As You_ IV, i, 13.         _Jaques._ I have neither the scholar's melancholy, which is       emulation; nor the _musician's_, which is _fantastical_,       etc.    _Measure for Measure_ IV, i, 12. Enter Duke, disguised as a friar  (after Song).         _Mariana._ I cry you mercy, sir; and well could wish            You had not found me here _so musical_:            Let me excuse me, and believe me so,            My _mirth it much displeased_, but _pleas'd my woe_.         _Duke._ 'Tis good: though _music oft hath such a charm,            To make bad good, and good provoke to harm_.    _Merchant_ V, i, 66. Enter musicians.         _Lor._ Come ho! and wake Diana with a _hymn_:            With sweetest _touches_ pierce your mistress' ear,            And draw her home _with music_.

The man that hath no music in himself_,            Nor is not mov'd with concord of sweet sounds,            Is fit for treasons, stratagems, and spoils;            The motions of his spirit are dull as night,            And his affections dark as Erebus.            _Let no such man be trusted._--Mark the music.    L. 97. Portia and Nerissa.         _Por._ ... _Music! hark!_         _Ner._ It is your music, madam, _of the house._         _Por._ Nothing is good, I see, without respect.            Methinks, _it sounds much sweeter than by day_.         _Ner._ _Silence_ bestows that virtue on it, madam.         _Por._ The _crow_ doth sing as sweetly as the _lark,            When neither is attended_; and I think,            The _nightingale_, if she should sing _by day_,            When every goose is cackling, _would be thought            No better a musician than the wren_.            How many things _by season_ season'd are            To their right praise, and true perfection.    Here is an example of a superstitious meaning attaching to supposed  mysterious music.    There are very few cases of this kind in Shakespeare--_i.e._, where  the music of the stage is an integral part of the drama.    _Antony and Cleop._ IV, iii, 12. Music of hautboys under the stage.         _4 Soldier._ ... Peace, what noise?         _1 Sold._                          List, list!         _2 Sold._ Hark!         _1 Sold._       Music in the air.         _3 Sold._                         Under the earth.         _4 Sold._ It signs well, does it not?         _3 Sold._                             No.         _1 Sold._                                 Peace, I say!            What should this mean?         _2 Sold._ 'Tis the god Hercules, whom Antony lov'd,            Now leaves him.    A very usual popular amusement was the Masque, which would consist of  a public procession with decorated cars containing the characters,  accompanied by hobby horses, tumblers, and open air music. This is  referred to in the next passage, where Theseus speaks of the masque  as an 'abridgement' for the evening, that is, an entertainment to  shorten the hours. The lamentable play of Pyramus and Thisbe follows,  which, it will be noticed, has some of the main features of a masque.    _Mid's Night's Dream_ V, i, 39.         _Theseus._ Say, what abridgment have you for this evening?            _What masque, what music?_...                *       *       *       *       *         [Reads from the paper]              \"A tedious brief scene of young Pyramus,            And his love Thisbe; very tragical mirth.\"            Merry and tragical! Tedious and brief!            That is, hot ice, and wonderous strange snow.            How shall we find the _concord of this discord_?    In the _Merchant of Venice_, Shylock mentions the procession of a  masque through the streets, forbidding Jessica to look out of the  window at these 'Christian fools with varnished faces.' The music  accompanying the procession is named--viz., drum and fife.    _Merchant_ II, v, 22.         _Lancelot._ 'You shall see a _masque_' ...         _Shylock._ What! are there _masques_?                                            Hear you me, Jessica.            Lock up my doors; and _when you hear the drum_,            And the _vile squeaking of the wryneck'd fife_,            Clamber not you up to the casements then,            Nor thrust your head into the public street            To gaze on _Christian fools with varnish'd faces_.    The 'vile squeaking of the wryneck'd fife' is of some musical  interest. The adjective 'wryneck'd' refers, not to the instrument  itself, which was straight, but to the player, whose head has to be  slightly twisted round to get at the mouthpiece. Mersennus (b. 1588)  says that the Fife is the same as the Tibia Helvetica, which was  simply a small edition of the Flauto Traverso, or German Flute. That  is, the Fife of those days was much the same as the modern Fife of the  cheaper kind, with the usual six holes, and a big hole near the  stopped end, where the breath was applied. The instrument was  therefore held _across_ [traverso] the face of the player, whose head  would be turned sideways, and hence comes Shylock's description of it  as the 'wryneck'd' fife.    In _Much Ado_, Benedick draws a distinction between the Drum and Fife  and the Tabor and Pipe. The former (see _Othello_ III. iii. 353) were  of a decided military cast; whereas the latter were"]]]
