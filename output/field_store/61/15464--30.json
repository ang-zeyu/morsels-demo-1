Oh! John Percival, as you are the nephew of  my beloved Mary, answer me with truth, and say that you are innocent of  this heinous deed!\"    \"I am indeed innocent, my dear uncle,\" said the young man; \"nor did I  know until this moment who the unfortunate man was, of whose untimely  death I am accused.\"    \"Here he is, gentlemen; we've got him safe and sound!\" cried several  voices; and dragging a wild and haggard-faced man, the fishers and  officials of justice approached the trio who stood by the Nut-tree-hole.    \"The Lord be our guide!\" exclaimed Mr. Comyn, \"it is really David Bain!\"  and as the wretched sexton struggled to free himself from the arms that  pinioned him, the minister, prompted by a sudden impulse, advancing  toward him, and looking steadily in his face, said--    \"David Bain, look not to deny your crime, but confess it, and implore  your Maker's pardon, even at this the eleventh hour. In my Bible, this  morning, I found a paper, written by the spirit of him you murdered here  last night, and charging you with the commission of the deed.\"    At these strange words, which in our modern times might have produced  mirth, the guilty creature, losing all self-possession, uttered a loud  cry, and pointing to the bloody cudgel which still lay at the  magistrate's feet, exclaimed--    \"I did it with that! I did it with that!\" and fell back in a fit.    It would be easy to lengthen out our historiette into one of  circumstantial evidence, trial, condemnation, and ultimate discovery;  but we have preferred telling it as it really happened. On the person of  David Bain were found a pocket-book and purse, recognized as the  property of the late Mr. Bruce, and containing bank-notes and bills to a  considerable amount; the sight of which, in the possession of his  lodger, had evoked the cupidity of the bell-man. He made a full  confession, and in due time suffered the penalty due to his offence.  Meanwhile the minister, in the thankfulness of his soul to find his  nephew guiltless, embraced him tenderly, and freely permitted that  courtship to proceed between his daughter and him, which he had before  so strenuously opposed.    One circumstance still remained a mystery, undeveloped to all save  Barbara's aunt, Percival, and the worthy magistrate,--by whose advice,  indeed, it was concealed from the minister; who, to his dying day,  confidently believed that the paper he had found in his Bible had been  placed there by supernatural interposition. But the hand of the dead had  nothing to do with it, as we mean to explain.    On the evening of the murder, Barbara Comyn sallied forth to meet her  cousin, leaving Mr. Bruce and her father discussing punch and polemics.  She was later than usual, and as she sped along, she became aware of the  approach from Aberdeen of an individual, whom she could not avoid  meeting if she proceeded direct to the tryst. She therefore stole into a  different track, thinking to make a circuit which would occupy the time  the stranger might take in passing the copse of hazels; but,  unfortunately (or fortunately, was it?), she met a poor woman, the wife  of a neighboring peasant, who was on her way to the manse to implore  some black currant jelly for a child suffering from sore throat. The  call of distress was never disregarded by Barbara, and she flew back to  the manse, procured the jelly, and giving it to the woman, hastened  amidst falling rain to the trysting-place. As she was about to round the  point which hid the Nut-hole from view, she heard the sounds of  struggling feet and wrestling arms; and, regardless of danger to herself  in her fears for Percival, she forced her way through some bushes, and  beheld two men, in no friendly embrace, staggering on the very verge of  the pool. Before she could look again the one had fallen on the earth;  and the other, with a desperate blow of his stick on the head of the  prostrate man, uttered an oath in a voice whose peculiar tones were  well-known to Barbara, and in the twinkling of an eye shoved the wounded  man over the bank into the Nut-tree hole!    Her blood curdling with horror, Barbara found no voice, no strength, to  speak or stir; but she became, so to speak, all eye; and as the  murderer, swiftly cramming into his hat and pockets something which she  could not define, rose up, and forgetful of the cudgel, which lay  blood-dabbled on the grass, rushed from the place where he had taken the  burden of a deadly sin upon his soul, she saw his face, and recognized  her father's sexton--David Bain.    In terror, that found no tongue, she reached her lover, and became  insensible; nor was it till her recovery, when she found herself alone  with her aunt, that she felt how important to her future life might be  the events of that night. She resolved, ere yet she spoke one word in  reply to the questions of her aunt, to ascribe her swoon to anything but  the real cause; and it was, perhaps, well she so determined, for she  remembered that, in her flight from the fatal spot where she had  witnessed the perpetration of so foul a deed, she had picked up a  letter, which she had hid in her bosom, scarcely conscious of what she  did, yet, perhaps, imperceptibly aware--with the foresight of  inexplicable convictions--that it might yet prove of essential service.  When she retired to her chamber, and had got rid of Aunt Henny, she took  the paper from its concealment, and saw that it was the empty cover of a  letter addressed to \"Mr. Bruce, at the house of David Bain, Sexton;\" and  then the certainty struck her of the murdered man being her affianced  husband.    The character of David Bain was marked by extreme avarice, and Barbara's  conclusions as to the instigating cause of the crime he had committed  were easily formed. But what means could she pursue in order to convict  guilt, without at the same time rendering her own appearance before a  public court of justice necessary? from which she shrank nervously,  since the cause of her presence in such a spot, and at such an hour,  must of course be revealed. A sudden thought struck her--and, wild as it  was, she put it into instant execution. She knew her father's belief in  supernatural agency, and trusted strongly to the effect such a document  as that which she now prepared would have upon him. She wrote the note  which Mr. Comyn discovered in the Bible, imitating Mr. Bruce's hand,  which was peculiar, as closely as she could; and then, when the minister  left it there--a circumstance which, though she did not foresee,  rejoiced her--she subtracted it thence, uninterrupted and unsuspected.  But when it pleased the Almighty to make manifest the murderer by the  means thus strangely suggested to her, she confessed the whole to the  indulgent Henny and her lover, and by their advice took the magistrate  also into her confidence.    We have nothing more to relate, but that Barbara Comyn and John Percival  were soon after united by the worthy minister; whilst Miss Henny was as  busy as a bee in preparations for the wedding, and as happy in  witnessing the happiness of others as if she had never known a care of  her own.           *       *       *       *       *    THIERS has abandoned politics and history for the summer to visit  England.

She leant her arms on the rail and looked across the sea to the lights  of Monte Carlo glistening in the purple night. Her eyes wandered idly to  the grounds and she started. She could have sworn she had seen a figure  moving in the shadow of the tree, nor was she mistaken.    Presently it left the tree belt, and stepped cautiously across the lawn,  halting now and again to look around. She thought at first that it was  Marcus Stepney who had returned, but something about the walk of the man  seemed familiar. Presently he stopped directly under the balcony and  looked up and she uttered an exclamation, as the faint light revealed  the iron-grey hair and the grisly eyebrows of the intruder.    \"All right, miss,\" he said in a hoarse whisper, \"it's only old Jaggs.\"    \"What are you doing?\" she answered in the same tone.    \"Just lookin' round,\" he said, \"just lookin' round,\" and limped again  into the darkness.          Chapter XXIII      So old Jaggs was in Monte Carlo! Whatever was he doing, and how was he  getting on with these people who spoke nothing but French, she wondered!  She had something to think about before she went to sleep.    She opened her eyes singularly awake as the dawn was coming up over the  grey sea. She looked at her watch; it was a quarter to six. Why she had  wakened so thoroughly she could not tell, but remembered with a little  shiver another occasion she had wakened, this time before the dawn, to  face death in a most terrifying shape.    She got up out of bed, put on a heavy coat and opened the wire doors  that led to the balcony. The morning was colder than she imagined, and  she was glad to retreat to the neighbourhood of the warm radiator.    The fresh clean hours of the dawn, when the mind is clear, and there is  neither sound nor movement to distract the thoughts, are favourable to  sane thinking.    Lydia reviewed the past few weeks in her life, and realised, for the  first time, the miracle which had happened. It was like a legend of  old--the slave had been lifted from the king's anteroom--the struggling  artist was now a rich woman. She twiddled the gold ring on her hand  absent-mindedly--and she was married ... and a widow! She had an  uncomfortable feeling that, in spite of her riches, she had not yet  found her niche. She was an odd quantity, as yet. The Cole-Mortimers and  the Briggerlands did not belong to her ideal world, and she could find  no place where she fitted.    She tried, in this state of mind so favourable to the consideration of  such a problem, to analyse Jack Glover's antagonism toward Jean  Briggerland and her father.    It seemed unnatural that a healthy young man should maintain so bitter a  feud with a girl whose beauty was almost of a transcendant quality and  all because she had rejected him.    Jack Glover was a public school boy, a man with a keen sense of honour.  She could not imagine him being guilty of a mean action. And such men  did not pursue vendettas without good reason. If they were rejected by a  woman, they accepted their _conge_ with a good grace, and it was almost  unthinkable that Jack should have no other reason for his hatred. Yet  she could not bring herself even to consider the possibility that the  reason was the one he had advanced. She came again to the dead end of  conjecture. She could believe in Jack's judgment up to a point--beyond  that she could not go.    She had her bath, dressed, and was in the garden when the eastern  horizon was golden with the light of the rising sun. Nobody was about,  the most energetic of the servants had not yet risen, and she strolled  through the avenue to the main road. As she stood there looking up and  down a man came out from the trees that fringed the road and began  walking rapidly in the direction of Monte Carlo.    \"Mr. Jaggs!\" she called.    He took no notice, but seemed to increase his limping pace, and after a  moment's hesitation, she went flying down the road after him. He turned  at the sound of her footsteps and in his furtive way drew into the  shadow of a bush. He looked more than usually grimy; on his hands were  an odd pair of gloves and a soft slouch hat that had seen better days,  covered his head.    \"Good-morning, miss,\" he wheezed.    \"Why were you running away, Mr. Jaggs?\" she asked, a little out of  breath.    \"Not runnin' away, miss,\" he said, glancing at her sharply from under  his heavy white eyebrows. \"Just havin' a look round!\"    \"Do you spend all your nights looking round?\" she smiled at him.    \"Yes, miss.\"    At that moment a cyclist gendarme came into view. He slowed down as he  approached the two and dismounted.    \"Good morning, madame,\" he said politely, and then looking at the man,  \"is this man in your employ? I have seen him coming out of your house  every morning?\"    \"Oh, yes,\" said Lydia hastily, \"he's my----\"    She was at a loss to describe him, but old Jaggs saved her the trouble.    \"I'm madame's courier,\" he said, and to Lydia's amazement he spoke in  perfect French, \"I am also the watchman of the house.\"    \"Yes, yes,\" said Lydia, after she had recovered from her surprise.  \"M'sieur is the watchman, also.\"    \"_Bien_, madame,\" said the gendarme. \"Forgive my asking, but we have so  many strangers here.\"    They watched the gendarme out of sight. Then old Jaggs chuckled.    \"Pretty good French, miss, wasn't it?\" he said, and without another  word, turned and limped in the trail of the police.    She looked after him in bewilderment. So he spent every night in the  grounds, or somewhere about the house? The knowledge gave her a queer  sense of comfort and safety.    When she went back to the villa she found the servants were up. Jean did  not put in an appearance until breakfast, and Lydia had an opportunity  of talking to the French housekeeper whom Mrs. Cole-Mortimer had engaged  when she took the villa. From her she learnt a bit of news, which she  passed on to Jean almost as soon as she put in an appearance.    \"The gardener's little boy is going to get well, Jean.\"    Jean nodded.    \"I know,\" she said. \"I telephoned to the hospital yesterday.\"    It was so unlike her conception of the girl, that Lydia stared.    \"The mother is in isolation,\" Lydia went on, \"and Madame Souviet says  that the poor woman has no money and no friends. I thought of going down  to the hospital to-day to see if I could do anything for her.\"    \"You'd better not, my dear,\" warned Mrs. Cole-Mortimer nervously. \"Let  us be thankful we've got the little brat out of the neighbourhood  without our catching the disease. One doesn't want to seek trouble. Keep  away from the hospital.\"    \"Rubbish!\" said Jean briskly. \"If Lydia wants to go, there is no reason  why she shouldn't. The isolation people are never allowed to come into  contact with visitors, so there is really no danger.\"    \"I agree with Mrs. Cole-Mortimer,\" grumbled Briggerland. \"It is very  foolish to ask for trouble. You take my advice, my dear, and keep  away.\"    \"I had a talk with a gendarme this morning,\" said Lydia to change the  subject. \"When he stopped and got off his bicycle I thought he was going  to speak about the shooting. I suppose it was reported to the police?\"    \"Er--yes,\" said Mr. Briggerland, not looking up from his plate, \"of  course. Have you been into Monte Carlo?\"    Lydia shook her head.    \"No, I couldn't sleep, and I was taking a walk along the road when he  passed.\" She said nothing about Mr. Jaggs. \"The police at Monaco are  very sociable.\"    Mr. Briggerland sniffed.    \"Very,\" he said.    \"Have they any theories?\" she asked. In her innocence she was persisting  in a subject which was wholly distasteful to Mr. Briggerland. \"About the  shooting I mean?\"    \"Yes, they have theories, but my dear, I should advise you not to  discuss the matter with the police. The fact is,\" invented Mr.  Briggerland, \"I told them that you were unaware of the fact that you had  been shot at, and if you discussed it with the police, you would make me  look rather foolish.\"    When Lydia and Mrs. Cole-Mortimer had gone, Jean seized an opportunity  which the absence of the maid offered.    \"I hope you are beginning to see how perfectly insane your scheme was,\"  she said. \"You have to support your act with a whole series of bungling  lies. Possibly Marcus, like a fool, has mentioned it in Monte Carlo, and  we shall have the detectives out here asking why you have not reported  the matter.\"    \"If I were as clever as you----\" he growled.    \"You're not,\" said Jean, rolling her serviette. \"You're the most  un-clever man I know.\"          Chapter XXIV      Lydia went up to her bedroom to put away her clothes and found the maid  making the bed.    \"Oh, madame,\" said the girl, \"I forgot to speak to you about a matter--I  hope madame will not be angry.\"    \"I'm hardly likely to be angry on a morning like this,\" said Lydia.    \"It is because of this matter,\" said the girl. She groped in her pocket  and brought out a small shining object, and Lydia took it from her hand.    \"This matter\" was a tiny silver cross, so small that a five-franc piece  would have covered it easily. It was brightly polished and apparently  had seen service.    \"When we took your bed, after the atrocious and mysterious happening,\"  said the maid rapidly, \"this was found in the sheets. It was not thought  that it could possibly be madame's, because it was so poor, until this  morning when it was suggested that it might be a souvenir that madame  values.\"    \"You found it in the sheets?\" asked Lydia in surprise.    \"Yes, madame.\"    \"It doesn't belong to me,\" said Lydia. \"Perhaps it belongs to Madame  Cole-Mortimer. I will show it to her.\"    Mrs. Cole-Mortimer was a devout Catholic and it might easily be some  cherished keep-sake of hers.    The girl carried the cross to the window; an \"X\" had been"]]]
