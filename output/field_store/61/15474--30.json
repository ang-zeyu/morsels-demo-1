With careful deliberation he took aim, and fired at  the animal nearest to us.  The heavy ball entered its huge body just  behind the shoulder.  Both elephants tossed up their trunks, and  elevating their great ears they dashed furiously into the bush; but the  one that had been hit, after plunging head foremost down a low bank fell  to the ground with a heavy crash, quite dead.    It was a splendid shot.  The natives, who almost immediately after came  up screaming with delight, could scarcely believe their eyes.  They  dashed across the river in the canoe, while some of them, regardless of  the alligators that might be hidden there, sprang into the water and  swam over.    \"I'm sorry we did not get the duck, however,\" observed Peterkin, as we  returned to the place where we had left the canoe.  \"Elephant meat is  coarse, nasty stuff, and totally unfit for civilised mouths, though  these niggers seem to relish it amazingly.\"    \"You forget the baked foot,\" said I.    \"Well, so I did.  It was pretty good, certainly; but that's the only  part o' the brute that's fit to eat.\"    Soon after this the canoe came back and took us over the river; and we  breakfasted on the side where the elephant had fallen, in order to allow  the natives to cut off such portions of the meat as they required, and  to secure the tusks.  Then we continued our journey, and at night  encamped near a grove of palm-trees which Makarooroo had described to  us, and where we were soon joined by him and Jack, who told us that he  had got on well, during the day--that he had shot an antelope, and had  seen a zebra and a rhinoceros, besides a variety of smaller game.  He  also told us that Okandaga was encamped in a place of safety a few miles  to the right of our position, and that she had stood the journey well.    I was much interested by Jack's account of the zebra and the rhinoceros,  specimens of both of which animals I had seen in menageries, and felt  disposed to change places with him on the march; but reflecting that he  was much more likely than I successfully to hunt anything he might  pursue, I made up my mind to remain by the canoe.    Thus we travelled for several days without anything particular  occurring, and at length arrived at a native village which lay on the  banks of a noble stream.    Here Makarooroo introduced us to Mbango the chief, a fine-looking and  good-natured negro, who received us most hospitably, supplied us with  food, and urged us to remain and hunt with his people.  This, however,  we declined to do, telling our entertainer that we had come to his  country for the purpose of shooting that wonderful animal the gorilla,  but assuring him that we would come back without fail if we should be  spared.  We further assured him on this head by proposing to leave in  his charge a woman for whom we had a great respect and love, and whom we  made him promise faithfully to take care of till we returned.    Peterkin, who soon gave them a specimen of his powers as a marksman, and  contrived in other ways to fill the minds of the chief and his people  with a very exalted idea of his powers both of body and intellect,  endeavoured to make assurance doubly sure by working on their  superstitious fears.    \"Tell Mbango,\" said he to our guide, \"that though we be small in numbers  we are very powerful; that we can do deeds\" (here he became awfully  solemn and mysterious) \"such as no black man ever conceived of; and that  if a hair of the head of Okandaga is hurt, we will on our return--\"    Instead of completing the sentence, Peterkin started up, threw himself  into violent contortions, rolled his eyes in a fearful manner, and, in  short, gave the chief and his people to understand that something quite  indescribable and unutterably terrible would be the result of their  playing us false.    \"Send for Njamie,\" said Mbango to one of his retainers.    Njamie, who was the chief's principal wife, soon appeared.  She led a  sturdy little boy by the hand.  He was her only son, and a very fine  little fellow, despite the blackness of his skin and his almost total  want of clothing.    To this woman Mbango gave Okandaga in charge, directing her in our  presence how to care for her, and assuring her of the most terrible  punishment should anything befall the woman committed to her care.    Njamie was a mild, agreeable woman.  She had more modesty of demeanour  and humility of aspect than the most of the women of her tribe whom we  happened to see, so that we felt disposed to believe that Okandaga was  placed in as safe keeping as it was possible for us to provide for her  in our circumstances.  Even Makarooroo appeared to be quite at ease in  his mind; and it was evidently with a relieved breast and a light heart  that he bade adieu to his bride, and started along with us on the  following day on our journey into the deeper recesses of the wilderness.    Before entering upon these transactions with the people of this village,  we took care to keep our crew in total ignorance of what passed by  sending them on in advance with the canoe under Jack's care, a few hours  before we brought Okandaga into the village, or even made mention of her  existence; and we secured their ready obedience to our orders, and total  indifference as to our motives in these incomprehensible actions, by  giving them each a few inches of tobacco--a gift which rendered them  supremely happy.    One day, about a week after the events above narrated, we met with an  adventure which well-nigh cost Jack his life, but which ultimately  resulted in an important change in our manner of travelling.  We were  traversing an extremely beautiful country with the goods on our  shoulders, having, in consequence of the increasing turbulence of the  river as well as its change of direction, been compelled to abandon our  canoe, and cut across the country in as straight a line as its nature  would permit.  But this was not easy, for the grass, which was bright  green, was so long as to reach sometimes higher than our shoulders.    In this species of country Jack's towering height really became of great  use, enabling him frequently to walk along with his head above the  surrounding herbage, while we were compelled to grope along, ignorant of  all that was around us save the tall grass at our sides.  Occasionally,  however, we came upon more open ground, where the grass was short, and  then we enjoyed the lovely scenery to the full.  We met with a great  variety of new plants and trees in this region.  Many of the latter were  festooned with wild vines and other climbing plants.  Among others, I  saw several specimens of that curious and interesting tree the banyan,  with its drop-shoots in every state of growth--some beginning to point  towards the earth, in which they were ultimately destined to take root;  some more than half-way down; while others were already fixed, forming  stout pillars to their parent branches--thus, as it were, on reaching  maturity, rendering that support which it is the glory as well as the  privilege of youth to accord to age.  Besides these, there were wild  dates and palmyra trees, and many others too numerous to mention, but  the peculiar characteristics of which I carefully jotted down in my  note-book.  Many small water-courses were crossed, in some of which Mak  pointed out a number of holes, which he said were made by elephants  wading in them.  He also told us that several mud-pools, which seemed to  have been recently and violently stirred up, were caused by the  wallowing of the rhinoceros; so we kept at all times a sharp lookout for  a shot.    Lions were also numerous in this neighbourhood, and we constantly heard  them roaring at night, but seldom saw them during our march.    Well, as I have already remarked, one day we were travelling somewhat  slowly through the long grass of this country, when, feeling oppressed  by the heat, as well as somewhat fatigued with my load, I called to  Jack, who was in advance, to stop for a few minutes to rest.    \"Most willingly,\" he replied, throwing down his load, and wiping away  the perspiration which stood in large drops on his brow.  \"I was on the  point of calling a halt when you spoke.--How do you get on down there,  Peterkin?\"    Our friend, who had seated himself on the bale he had been carrying, and  seemed to be excessively hot, looked up with a comical expression of  countenance, and replied--    \"Pretty well, thank'ee.  How do _you_ get on _up there_?\"    \"Oh, capitally.  There's such a nice cool breeze blowing, I'm quite  sorry that I cannot send a little of it down.\"    \"Don't distress yourself, my dear fellow; I'll come up to snuff it.\"    So saying, Peterkin sprang nimbly upon Jack's shoulders, and began to  gaze round him.    \"I say, Peterkin,\" said Jack, \"why are you a very clever fellow just  now?\"    \"Don't know,\" replied Peterkin.  \"I give it up at once.  Always do.  Never could guess a riddle in all my life.\"    \"Because,\" said Jack, \"you're `_up to snuff_.'\"    \"Oh, oh! that certainly deserves a _pinch_; so there's for you.\"    Jack uttered a roar, and tossed Peterkin off his shoulders, on receiving  the punishment.    \"Shabby fellow!\" cried Peterkin, rubbing his head.  \"But, I say, do let  me up again.  I thought, just as you dropped me, that I saw a place  where the grass is short.  Ay, there it is, fifty yards or so ahead of  us, with a palmyra tree on it.  Come, let us go rest there, for I  confess that I feel somewhat smothered in this long grass.\"    We took up our packs immediately, and carried them to the spot  indicated, which we found almost free from long grass.  Here we lay down  to enjoy the delightful shade of the tree, and the magnificent view of  the country around us.  Our negroes also seemed to enjoy the shade, but  they were evidently not nearly so"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2176"],[0,"Seven Discourses on Art (#20)"],[1,"to assert that the parts have no relation to the whole.  Colouring is  true where it is naturally adapted to the eye, from brightness, from  softness, from harmony, from resemblance; because these agree with their  object, nature, and therefore are true: as true as mathematical  demonstration; but known to be true only to those who study these things.    But besides real, there is also apparent truth, or opinion, or prejudice.  With regard to real truth, when it is known, the taste which conforms to  it is, and must be, uniform.  With regard to the second sort of truth,  which may be called truth upon sufferance, or truth by courtesy, it is  not fixed, but variable.  However, whilst these opinions and prejudices  on which it is founded continue, they operate as truth; and the art,  whose office it is to please the mind, as well as instruct it, must  direct itself according to opinion, or it will not attain its end.    In proportion as these prejudices are known to be generally diffused, or  long received, the taste which conforms to them approaches nearer to  certainty, and to a sort of resemblance to real science, even where  opinions are found to be no better than prejudices.  And since they  deserve, on account of their duration and extent, to be considered as  really true, they become capable of no small decree of stability and  determination by their permanent and uniform nature.    As these prejudices become more narrow, more local, more transitory, this  secondary taste becomes more and more fantastical; recedes from real  science; is less to be approved by reason, and less followed in practice;  though in no case perhaps to be wholly neglected, where it does not  stand, as it sometimes does, in direct defiance of the most respectable  opinions received amongst mankind.    Having laid down these positions, I shall proceed with less method,  because less will serve, to explain and apply them.    We will take it for granted that reason is something invariable and fixed  in the nature of things; and without endeavouring to go back to an  account of first principles, which for ever will elude our search, we  will conclude that whatever goes under the name of taste, which we can  fairly bring under the dominion of reason, must be considered as equally  exempt from change.  If therefore, in the course of this inquiry, we can  show that there are rules for the conduct of the artist which are fixed  and invariable, it implies, of course, that the art of the connoisseur,  or, in other words, taste, has likewise invariable principles.    Of the judgment which we make on the works of art, and the preference  that we give to one class of art over another, if a reason be demanded,  the question is perhaps evaded by answering, \"I judge from my taste\"; but  it does not follow that a better answer cannot be given, though for  common gazers this may be sufficient.  Every man is not obliged to  investigate the causes of his approbation or dislike.    The arts would lie open for ever to caprice and casualty, if those who  are to judge of their excellences had no settled principles by which they  are to regulate their decisions, and the merit or defect of performances  were to be determined by unguided fancy.  And indeed we may venture to  assert that whatever speculative knowledge is necessary to the artist, is  equally and indispensably necessary to the connoisseur.    The first idea that occurs in the consideration of what is fixed in art,  or in taste, is that presiding principle of which I have so frequently  spoken in former discourses, the general idea of nature.  The beginning,  the middle, and the end of everything that is valuable in taste, is  comprised in the knowledge of what is truly nature; for whatever ideas  are not conformable to those of nature, or universal opinion, must be  considered as more or less capricious.    The idea of nature comprehending not only the forms which nature  produces, but also the nature and internal fabric and organisation, as I  may call it, of the human mind and imagination: general ideas, beauty, or  nature, are but different ways of expressing the same thing, whether we  apply these terms to statues, poetry, or picture.  Deformity is not  nature, but an accidental deviation from her accustomed practice.  This  general idea therefore ought to be called nature, and nothing else,  correctly speaking, has a right to that name.  But we are so far from  speaking, in common conversation, with any such accuracy, that, on the  contrary, when we criticise Rembrandt and other Dutch painters, who  introduced into their historical pictures exact representations of  individual objects with all their imperfections, we say, though it is not  in a good taste, yet it is nature.    This misapplication of terms must be very often perplexing to the young  student.  Is not, he may say, art an imitation of nature?  Must he not,  therefore, who imitates her with the greatest fidelity be the best  artist?  By this mode of reasoning Rembrandt has a higher place than  Raffaelle.  But a very little reflection will serve to show us that these  particularities cannot be nature: for how can that be the nature of man,  in which no two individuals are the same?    It plainly appears that as a work is conducted under the influence of  general ideas or partial it is principally to be considered as the effect  of a good or a bad taste.    As beauty therefore does not consist in taking what lies immediately  before you, so neither, in our pursuit of taste, are those opinions which  we first received and adopted the best choice, or the most natural to the  mind and imagination.    In the infancy of our knowledge we seize with greediness the good that is  within our reach; it is by after-consideration, and in consequence of  discipline, that we refuse the present for a greater good at a distance.  The nobility or elevation of all arts, like the excellence of virtue  itself, consists in adopting this enlarged and comprehensive idea, and  all criticism built upon the more confined view of what is natural, may  properly be called shallow criticism, rather than false; its defect is  that the truth is not sufficiently extensive.    It has sometimes happened that some of the greatest men in our art have  been betrayed into errors by this confined mode of reasoning.  Poussin,  who, upon the whole, may be produced as an instance of attention to the  most enlarged and extensive ideas of nature, from not having settled  principles on this point, has in one instance at least, I think, deserted  truth for prejudice.  He is said to have vindicated the conduct of Julio  Romano, for his inattention to the masses of light and shade, or grouping  the figures, in the battle of Constantine, as if designedly neglected,  the better to correspond with the hurry and confusion of a battle.  Poussin's own conduct in his representations of Bacchanalian triumphs and  sacrifices, makes us more easily give credit to this report, since in  such subjects, as well indeed as in many others, it was too much his own  practice.  The best apology we can make for this conduct is what proceeds  from the association of our ideas, the prejudice we have in favour of  antiquity.  Poussin's works, as I have formerly observed, have very much  the air of the ancient manner of painting, in which there are not the  least traces to make us think that what we call the keeping, the  composition of light and shade, or distribution of the work into masses,  claimed any part of their attention.  But surely whatever apology we may  find out for this neglect, it ought to be ranked among the defects of  Poussin, as well as of the antique paintings; and the moderns have a  right to that praise which is their due, for having given so pleasing an  addition to the splendour of the art.    Perhaps no apology ought to be received for offences committed against  the vehicle (whether it be the organ of seeing or of hearing) by which  our pleasures are conveyed to the mind.  We must take the same care that  the eye be not perplexed and distracted by a confusion of equal parts, or  equal lights, as of offending it by an unharmonious mixture of colours.  We may venture to be more confident of the truth of this observation,  since we find that Shakespeare, on a parallel occasion, has made Hamlet  recommend to the players a precept of the same kind, never to offend the  ear by harsh sounds:--\"In the very torrent, tempest, and whirlwind of  your passions,\" says he, \"you must beget a temperance that may give it  smoothness.\"  And yet, at the same time, he very justly observes, \"The  end of playing, both at the first and now, is to hold, as it were, the  mirror up to nature.\"  No one can deny but that violent passions will  naturally emit harsh and disagreeable tones; yet this great poet and  critic thought that this imitation of nature would cost too much, if  purchased at the expense of disagreeable sensations, or, as he expresses  it, of \"splitting the ear.\"  The poet and actor, as well as the painter  of genius who is well acquainted with all the variety and sources of  pleasure in the mind and imagination, has little regard or attention to  common nature, or creeping after common sense.  By overleaping those  narrow bounds, he more effectually seizes the whole mind, and more  powerfully accomplishes his purpose.  This success is ignorantly imagined  to proceed from inattention to all rules, and in defiance of reason and  judgment; whereas it is in truth acting according to the best rules, and  the justest reason.    He who thinks nature, in the narrow sense of the word, is alone to be  followed, will produce but a scanty entertainment for the imagination:  everything is to be done with which it is natural for the mind to be  pleased, whether it proceeds from simplicity or variety, uniformity or  irregularity: whether the scenes are familiar or exotic; rude"]]]
