As I say, it's  simply fate. Good-by.\"    And I left him.    As I was going back, I met the professor and Phyllis.    They passed me without a look.    I wandered on in quite a fervor of self-pity. I was in one of those  moods when life suddenly seems to become irksome, when the future  stretches blank and gray in front of one. In such a mood it is  imperative that one should seek distraction. The shining example of  Mr. Harry Hawk did not lure me. Taking to drink would be a nuisance.  Work was what I wanted. I would toil like a navvy all day among the  fowls, separating them when they fought, gathering in the eggs when  they laid, chasing them across country when they got away, and even,  if necessity arose, painting their throats with turpentine when they  were stricken with roop. Then, after dinner, when the lamps were lit,  and Mrs. Ukridge petted Edwin and sewed, and Ukridge smoked cigars and  incited the gramophone to murder \"Mumbling Mose,\" I would steal away  to my bedroom and write--and write--and _write_--and go on writing  till my fingers were numb and my eyes refused to do their duty. And,  when time had passed, I might come to feel that it was all for the  best. A man must go through the fire before he can write his  masterpiece. We learn in suffering what we teach in song. What we lose  on the swings we make up on the roundabouts. Jerry Garnet, the man,  might become a depressed, hopeless wreck, with the iron planted  irremovably in his soul; but Jeremy Garnet, the author, should turn  out such a novel of gloom that strong critics would weep and the  public jostle for copies till Mudie's doorways became a shambles.    Thus might I some day feel that all this anguish was really a  blessing--effectively disguised.    But I doubted it.    We were none of us very cheerful now at the farm. Even Ukridge's  spirit was a little daunted by the bills which poured in by every  post. It was as if the tradesmen of the neighborhood had formed a  league and were working in concert. Or it may have been due to thought  waves. Little accounts came not in single spies but in battalions. The  popular demand for a sight of the color of his money grew daily. Every  morning at breakfast he would give us fresh bulletins of the state of  mind of each of our creditors, and thrill us with the announcement  that Whiteley's were getting cross and Harrod's jumpy, or that the  bearings of Dawlish, the grocer, were becoming over-heated. We lived  in a continual atmosphere of worry. Chicken and nothing but chicken  at meals, and chicken and nothing but chicken between meals, had  frayed our nerves. An air of defeat hung over the place. We were a  beaten side, and we realized it. We had been playing an uphill game  for nearly two months, and the strain was beginning to tell. Ukridge  became uncannily silent. Mrs. Ukridge, though she did not understand,  I fancy, the details of the matter, was worried because Ukridge was.  Mrs. Beale had long since been turned into a soured cynic by the lack  of chances vouchsafed her for the exercise of her art. And as for me,  I have never since spent so profoundly miserable a week. I was not  even permitted the anodyne of work. There seemed to be nothing to do  on the farm. The chickens were quite happy, and only asked to be let  alone and allowed to have their meals at regular intervals. And every  day one or more of their number would vanish into the kitchen, and  Mrs. Beale would serve up the corpse in some cunning disguise, and we  would try to delude ourselves into the idea that it was something  altogether different.    There was one solitary gleam of variety in our menu. An editor sent me  a check for a guinea for a set of verses. We cashed that check and  trooped round the town in a body, laying out the money. We bought a  leg of mutton and a tongue and sardines and pineapple chunks and  potted meat and many other noble things, and had a perfect banquet.    After that we relapsed into routine again.    Deprived of physical labor, with the exception of golf and  bathing--trivial sports compared with work in the fowl runs at its  hardest--I tried to make up for it by working at my novel.    It refused to materialize.    I felt, like the man in the fable, as if some one had played a mean  trick on me, and substituted for my brain a side order of  cauliflower. By no manner of means could I get the plot to shape  itself. I could not detach my mind from my own painful case. Instead  of thinking of my characters, I sat in my chair and thought miserably  of Phyllis.    The only progress I achieved was with my villain.    I drew him from the professor and made him a blackmailer. He had  several other social defects, but that was his profession. That was  the thing he did really well.    It was on one of the many occasions on which I had sat in my room, pen  in hand, through the whole of a lovely afternoon, with no better  result than a slight headache, that I bethought me of that little  paradise on the Ware Cliff, hung over the sea and backed by green  woods. I had not been there for sometime, owing principally to an  entirely erroneous idea that I could do more solid work sitting in a  straight, hard chair at a table than lying on soft turf with the sea  wind in my eyes.    But now the desire to visit that little clearing again drove me from  my room. In the drawing-room below, the gramophone was dealing  brassily with \"Mister Blackman.\" Outside, the sun was just thinking of  setting. The Ware Cliff was the best medicine for me. What does  Kipling say?        And soon you will find that the sun and the wind        And the Djinn of the Garden, too,      Have lightened the Hump, Cameelious Hump,        The Hump that is black and blue.    His instructions include digging with a hoe and a shovel also, but I  could omit that. The sun and wind were what I needed.    I took the upper road. In certain moods I preferred it to the path  along the cliff. I walked fast. The exercise was soothing.    To reach my favorite clearing I had to take to the fields on the left  and strike down hill in the direction of the sea. I hurried down the  narrow path.    I broke into the clearing at a jog trot, and stood panting. And at the  same moment, looking cool and beautiful in her white dress, Phyllis  entered it from the other side. Phyllis--without the professor.          OF A SENTIMENTAL NATURE    XVII      She was wearing a Panama, and she carried a sketching block and camp  stool.    \"Good evening,\" I said.    \"Good evening,\" said she.    It is curious how different the same words can sound when spoken by  different people. My \"good evening\" might have been that of a man with  a particularly guilty conscience caught in the act of doing something  more than usually ignoble. She spoke like a somewhat offended angel.    \"It's a lovely evening,\" I went on pluckily.    \"Very.\"    \"The sunset!\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Er--\"    She raised a pair of blue eyes, devoid of all expression save a faint  suggestion of surprise, gazed through me for a moment at some object a  couple of thousand miles away, and lowered them again, leaving me with  a vague feeling that there was something wrong with my personal  appearance.    Very calmly she moved to the edge of the cliff, arranged her camp  stool, and sat down. Neither of us spoke a word. I watched her while  she filled a little mug with water from a little bottle, opened her  paint box, selected a brush, and placed her sketching block in  position.    She began to paint.    Now, by all the laws of good taste, I should before this have made a  dignified exit. When a lady shows a gentleman that his presence is  unwelcome, it is up to him, as an American friend of mine pithily  observed to me on one occasion, to get busy and chase himself, and  see if he can make the tall timber in two jumps. In other words, to  retire. It was plain that I was not regarded as an essential ornament  of this portion of the Ware Cliff. By now, if I had been the perfect  gentleman, I ought to have been a quarter of a mile away.    But there is a definite limit to what a man can do. I remained.    The sinking sun flung a carpet of gold across the sea. Phyllis's hair  was tinged with it. Little waves tumbled lazily on the beach below.  Except for the song of a distant blackbird running through its  repertory before retiring for the night, everything was silent.    Especially Phyllis.    She sat there, dipping and painting and dipping again, with never a  word for me--standing patiently and humbly behind her.    \"Miss Derrick,\" I said.    She half turned her head.    \"Yes?\"    One of the most valuable things which a lifetime devoted to sport  teaches a man is \"never play the goose game.\" Bold attack is the  safest rule in nine cases out of ten, wherever you are and whatever  you may be doing. If you are batting, attack the ball. If you are  boxing, get after your man. If you are talking, go to the point.    \"Why won't you speak to me?\" I said.    \"I don't understand you.\"    \"Why won't you speak to me?\"    \"I think you know, Mr. Garnet.\"    \"It is because of that boat accident?\"    \"Accident!\"    \"Episode,\" I amended.    She went on painting in silence. From where I stood I could see her  profile. Her chin was tilted. Her expression was determined.    \"Is it?\" I said.    \"Need we discuss it?\"    \"Not if you do not wish.\"    I paused.    \"But,\" I added, \"I should have liked a chance to defend myself....  What glorious sunsets there have been these last few days. I believe  we shall have this sort of weather for another month.\"    \"I should not have thought that possible.\"    \"The glass is going up,\" I said.    \"I was not talking about the weather.\"    \"It was dull of me to introduce such a worn-out topic.\"    \"You said you could defend yourself.\"    \"I said I should like the chance to do "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20552"],[0,"Roumanian Fairy Tales (#20)"],[1,"last, after great difficulty, she reached her mother's house, but  even here she did not find herself rolling in money, for when the old  man's wife opened the chest, out came a host of dragons, which  swallowed her and her daughter as if they had never been in the world.  Then dragons, trunk, and all vanished.    The old man could now live in peace, and possessed countless riches;  his daughter he married to a worthy, capable man. The cocks now crowed  on the gate-posts, the threshold, and everywhere, but the hens no  longer crowed as an evil omen in the house of the old man, who had not  many days of life remaining. He was bald and bent, because his wife  had quarreled with him too often and looked to see if he didn't need a  drubbing.          The Poor Boy.      Once upon a time something happened. If it hadn't happened, it  wouldn't be told.    There was once a poor widow, so poor that even the flies would not  stay in her house, and this widow had two children, a boy and a girl.  The boy was such a brave fellow that he would have torn the snakes'  tongues out of their mouths, and the girl was so beautiful that the  emperor's sons and handsome princes of every land were waiting  impatiently for her to grow up, that they might go and court her. But  when the girl had reached her sixteenth year, the same thing befell  her that happens to all beautiful maidens--a dragon came, stole her,  and carried her far away to the shore of another country. From that  day the widow loved her son hundreds and thousands of times better  than before, because he was now her only child and the sole joy she  had in the world. She watched him like the apple of her eye and would  not let him go a single step away from her. But much as she loved him  she was cheerless and sad, for, dear me! a boy is only a boy, but a  girl is a girl, especially when she is beautiful.    The boy, seeing his mother so melancholy, tried to grow stronger and  stronger, and counted the days before he should be large enough to go  out into the world and seek his sister, little Rosy Cheeks, along  untrodden paths filled with thorns. When he had reached his eighteenth  year he made himself a pair of calf-skin sandals with steel soles,  went to his mother, and said:--    \"Mother, I have neither rest nor peace here so long as I see you so  sick and sorrowful from constantly thinking of my sister; I have  determined to go out into the wide world and not return till I can  bring news of her. I don't know whether I shall find her, but at least  I hope so, and that hope I leave with you for your consolation.\"    When the widow heard these words she was forced to struggle with her  feelings ere she answered: \"Well, my son, my child! Do what you can  not help doing; when you return I shall see you again, and if you  don't come back I shall not weep for you, because the journey you have  in view is a long one; therefore if you are absent a long time there  will always be the hope of your return.\"    After saying this she mixed three loaves for him with her own milk,  one of meal, the second of bran, and the third of ashes from the  hearth. The lad put the loaves into his knapsack, bade his mother  farewell, and went out into the world like a poor boy to whom all  roads are equally long, all bridges equally wide, and who does not  know what direction to take. At the gate he stood still, cast one  glance to the east, one to the west, one to the north, and one to the  south, then took a handful of dust from under the threshold of the  door, scattered it on the wind, and turned his steps in the direction  that it was carried by the breeze.    The Poor Boy walked and walked, further and further, through many a  rich country, till he came to a moor on which no grass grew and no  water flowed. Here he stopped and pulled out his three loaves. He  began with the one made of meal, because it was the handsomest, and as  he ate it his strength increased and his thirst was quenched. Again  the Poor Boy walked on, journeying across the wide moor a whole long  summer day until nightfall, when he reached a vast forest as extensive  as the heath he had passed, but which was dense, gloomy, and forsaken  even by the winds. When he entered the wood, he saw by the trunk of a  tree an old woman with a bent figure and a wrinkled face. The Poor  Boy, who for so long a time had seen no human countenance and heard no  human speech, was greatly delighted and said merrily:--    \"Good luck, mother! But how do you happen to come here, and what are  you doing in this wilderness of a forest?\"    \"Your words are kind!\" replied the old woman sighing. \"Alas, age has  brought me down to this; I wanted to walk a little distance and can go  no further because my feet will no longer carry me.\"    When the Poor Boy heard this he pitied the old woman, went up to her,  and asked whence she came, where she was going, and on what business  she was bent. The luckless fellow did not know that this person was no  other than the Wood Witch, who waits on the edge of forests and meets  those who wander in these desolate regions, in order to delude them  with fair words and then lead them to destruction. When he saw her so  feeble, the boy remembered his three loaves, and, as if he were going  home the very next day, thought he would share his provisions with her  that she might get a little strength.    \"I thank you,\" replied the Wood Witch, who had other designs upon him  in her mind; \"but see, I have no teeth to chew your dry bread. If you  want to do any thing to help me, take me on your back and carry me, I  live close by.\"    \"But just taste it,\" said the boy, who in his kindness of heart wanted  to do her some good. \"It is only hunger that has made you so weak, and  if this doesn't help you I'll carry you as you wish.\"    When the Wood Witch saw the loaf made of meal she gazed at it with  delight; there was something about it--I don't know what--that made  even the Wood Witch long for a morsel. And as she bit into it her  heart grew softer. After she had eaten three mouthfuls she felt as if  she were a human being, like the rest of us, with her heart in the  right place and a gentle temper.    \"Learn, my son,\" she said to him, \"that I am the Wood Witch, and know  very well who you are, whence you come, and where you are going. It is  a great task you have before you, for your sister is in the other  world, which inhabitants of this earth can reach only in one way.\"    \"And what is that?\" asked the Poor Boy impatiently.    The Wood Witch looked doubtfully at him.    \"I don't advise you to take it,\" she said, \"it would be a pity to lose  your young life. But who knows, perhaps you'll have good luck; I see  that you have a tender heart, and whoever has that can bring many  things to pass; besides, I know you--you will have no rest till you  have found her. So learn--far away from here, after you have crossed  six moors and six forests, you will meet on the edge of the seventh  forest, which extends to the frontiers of the next world, an old  witch; this witch has a drove of horses, and among them is an  enchanted horse which can carry you to the other shore. But this steed  can be obtained only by the person who knows how to choose it from the  whole drove, after he has served the old witch for a year.\"    This was what the Poor Boy had wanted to know. He lost no more time,  thanked the Wood Witch for her explanations, and set off, keeping  straight through the dense forest, because his road was long and he  was in a hurry. The Poor Boy walked like one who goes on a good  errand, and hurried like a person who wants to get home early. How far  he walked and how much he hurried any one can imagine, who remembers  how long a time he himself required to cross a single moor and a  single forest. But, when his strength failed, he bit off a piece of  his loaf and instantly revived again.    As he came out of the sixth forest and passed near the clear waves of  a brook, he saw a wasp struggling in the water and pitied the insect.  So he took a dry branch and held out one end of it to the wasp, that  it might crawl up on it and then use its wings. But this wasp happened  to be the queen of all the wasps in the woods, and when she found  herself saved by the boy's kindness she flew upon his shoulder and  said:    \"Wherever you go, may good-luck be your companion. Please pull out a  hair from under my right wing and take good care of it, for who knows  whether it will not prove useful to you some day. If you need me,  shake this hair and I'll come to you, in whatever part of the world  you may be.\"    The Poor Boy pulled out the hair, put it carefully away, and journeyed  on. Who knows how far he walked before he came to a great lake, on  whose shore he saw a fish flapping on the dry land. He pitied the poor  creature, which had scarcely a breath of life left, so he picked it up  and tossed it into the water. But this fish was king of all the  fishes, and had jeweled scales and golden fins. It swam once around  the lake, breathed two or three times to recover its strength, and  then came back to the boy and said:    \"Wherever you go, may good-luck be your companion. Please pull off a  scale from under my right fin and keep it carefully, who knows whether  it may not be useful to you some day. If you ever need me, rub this  scale and I'll come to you wherever you may be, as far as the water  extends around the earth.\"    The Poor Boy took the scale, put it carefully away, and journeyed on.  Who knows how far he walked ere he reached the seventh moor, where no  grass grew and no water flowed. There he found in his path a mole  which had been surprised above ground by the daylight, and was now  groping piteously about in its blindness, unable to find its burrow  where its children were starving, though it was only one jump away.  The youth pitied the mole, too, took it and carried it to its hill.    \"Wherever you go,\""]]]
