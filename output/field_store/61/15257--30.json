[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16983"],[0,"The Kitáb-i-Íqán (#20)"],[1,"r, should  certainly be accounted a superior and worthier people.    It is clear and evident that whenever the Manifestations of Holiness were  revealed, the divines of their day have hindered the people from attaining  unto the way of truth. To this testify the records of all the scriptures  and heavenly books. Not one Prophet of God was made manifest Who did not  fall a victim to the relentless hate, to the denunciation, denial, and  execration of the clerics of His day! Woe unto them for the iniquities  their hands have formerly wrought! Woe unto them for that which they are  now doing! What veils of glory more grievous than these embodiments of  error! By the righteousness of God! to pierce such veils is the mightiest  of all acts, and to rend them asunder the most meritorious of all deeds!  May God assist us and assist you, O concourse of the Spirit! that  perchance ye may in the time of His Manifestation be graciously aided to  perform such deeds, and may in His days attain unto the Presence of God.    Furthermore, among the \"veils of glory\" are such terms as the \"Seal of the  Prophets\" and the like, the removal of which is a supreme achievement in  the sight of these base-born and erring souls. All, by reason of these  mysterious sayings, these grievous \"veils of glory,\" have been hindered  from beholding the light of truth. Have they not heard the melody of that  bird of Heaven,(121) uttering this mystery: \"A thousand Fatimihs I have  espoused, all of whom were the daughters of Muhammad, Son of 'Abdu'llah,  the 'Seal of the Prophets?'\" Behold, how many are the mysteries that lie  as yet unravelled within the tabernacle of the knowledge of God, and how  numerous the gems of His wisdom that are still concealed in His inviolable  treasuries! Shouldest thou ponder this in thine heart, thou wouldst  realize that His handiwork knoweth neither beginning nor end. The domain  of His decree is too vast for the tongue of mortals to describe, or for  the bird of the human mind to traverse; and the dispensations of His  providence are too mysterious for the mind of man to comprehend. His  creation no end hath overtaken, and it hath ever existed from the  \"Beginning that hath no beginning\"; and the Manifestations of His Beauty  no beginning hath beheld, and they will continue to the \"End that knoweth  no end.\" Ponder this utterance in thine heart, and reflect how it is  applicable unto all these holy Souls.    Likewise, strive thou to comprehend the meaning of the melody of that  eternal beauty, Husayn, son of 'Ali, who, addressing Salman, spoke words  such as these: \"I was with a thousand Adams, the interval between each and  the next Adam was fifty thousand years, and to each one of these I  declared the Successorship conferred upon my father.\" He then recounteth  certain details, until he saith: \"I have fought one thousand battles in  the path of God, the least and most insignificant of which was like the  battle of _Kh_aybar, in which battle my father fought and contended  against the infidels.\" Endeavour now to apprehend from these two  traditions the mysteries of \"end,\" \"return,\" and \"creation without  beginning or end.\"    O my beloved! Immeasurably exalted is the celestial Melody above the  strivings of human ear to hear or mind to grasp its mystery! How can the  helpless ant step into the court of the All-Glorious? And yet, feeble  souls, through lack of understanding, reject these abstruse utterances,  and question the truth of such traditions. Nay, none can comprehend them  save those that are possessed of an understanding heart. Say, He is that  End for Whom no end in all the universe can be imagined, and for Whom no  beginning in the world of creation can be conceived. Behold, O concourse  of the earth, the splendours of the End, revealed in the Manifestations of  the Beginning!    How strange! These people with one hand cling to those verses of the  Qur'an and those traditions of the people of certitude which they have  found to accord with their inclinations and interests, and with the other  reject those which are contrary to their selfish desires. \"Believe ye then  part of the Book, and deny part?\"(122) How could ye judge that which ye  understand not? Even as the Lord of being hath in His unerring Book, after  speaking of the \"Seal\" in His exalted utterance: \"Muhammad is the Apostle  of God and the Seal of the Prophets,\"(123) hath revealed unto all people  the promise of \"attainment unto the divine Presence.\" To this attainment  to the presence of the immortal King testify the verses of the Book, some  of which We have already mentioned. The one true God is My witness!  Nothing more exalted or more explicit than \"attainment unto the divine  Presence\" hath been revealed in the Qur'an. Well is it with him that hath  attained thereunto, in the day wherein most of the people, even as ye  witness, have turned away therefrom.    And yet, through the mystery of the former verse, they have turned away  from the grace promised by the latter, despite the fact that \"attainment  unto the divine Presence\" in the \"Day of Resurrection\" is explicitly  stated in the Book. It hath been demonstrated and definitely established,  through clear evidences, that by \"Resurrection\" is meant the rise of the  Manifestation of God to proclaim His Cause, and by \"attainment unto the  divine Presence\" is meant attainment unto the presence of His Beauty in  the person of His Manifestation. For verily, \"No vision taketh in Him, but  He taketh in all vision.\"(124) Notwithstanding all these indubitable facts  and lucid statements, they have foolishly clung to the term \"seal,\" and  remained utterly deprived of the recognition of Him Who is the Revealer of  both the Seal and the Beginning, in the day of His presence. \"If God  should chastise men for their perverse doings, He would not leave upon the  earth a moving thing! But to an appointed time doth He respite them.\"(125)  But apart from all these things, had this people attained unto a drop of  the crystal streams flowing from the words: \"God doeth whatsoever He  willeth, and ordaineth whatsoever He pleaseth,\" they would not have raised  any unseemly cavils, such as these, against the focal Center of His  Revelation. The Cause of God, all deeds and words, are held within the  grasp of His power. \"All things lie imprisoned within the hollow of His  mighty Hand; all things are easy and possible unto Him.\" He accomplisheth  whatsoever He willeth, and doeth all that He desireth. \"Whoso sayeth 'why'  or 'wherefore' hath spoken blasphemy!\" Were these people to shake off the  slumber of negligence and realize that which their hands have wrought,  they would surely perish, and would of their own accord cast themselves  into fire--their end and real abode. Have they not heard that which He hath  revealed: \"He shall not be asked of His doings?\"(126) In the light of  these utterances, how can man be so bold as to question Him, and busy  himself with idle sayings?    Gracious God! So great is the folly and perversity of the people, that  they have turned their face toward their own thoughts and desires, and  have turned their back upon the knowledge and will of God--hallowed and  glorified be His name!    Be fair: Were these people to acknowledge the truth of these luminous  words and holy allusions, and recognize God as \"Him that doeth whatsoever  He pleaseth,\" how could they continue to cleave unto these glaring  absurdities? Nay, with all their soul, they would accept and submit to  whatsoever He saith. I swear by God! But for the divine Decree, and the  inscrutable dispensations of Providence, the earth itself would have  utterly destroyed all this people! \"He will, however, respite them until  the appointed time of a known day.\"    Twelve hundred and eighty years have passed since the dawn of the  Muhammadan Dispensation, and with every break of day, these blind and  ignoble people have recited their Qur'an, and yet have failed to grasp one  letter of that Book! Again and again they read those verses which clearly  testify to the reality of these holy themes, and bear witness to the truth  of the Manifestations of eternal Glory, and still apprehend not their  purpose. They have even failed to realize, all this time, that, in every  age, the reading of the scriptures and holy books is for no other purpose  except to enable the reader to apprehend their meaning and unravel their  innermost mysteries. Otherwise reading, without understanding, is of no  abiding profit unto man.    And it came to pass that on a certain day a needy man came to visit this  Soul, craving for the ocean of His knowledge. While conversing with him,  mention was made concerning the signs of the Day of Judgment,  Resurrection, Revival, and Reckoning. He urged Us to explain how, in this  wondrous Dispensation, the peoples of the world were brought to a  reckoning, when none were made aware of it. Thereupon, We imparted unto  him, according to the measure of his capacity and understanding, certain  truths of Science and ancient Wisdom. We then asked him saying: \"Hast thou  not read the Qur'an, and art thou not aware of this blessed verse: 'On  that day shall neither man nor spirit be asked of his Sin?'(127) Dost thou  not realize that by 'asking' is not meant asking by tongue or speech, even  as the verse itself doth indicate and prove? For afterward it is said: 'By  their countenance shall the sinners be known, and they shall be seized by  their forelocks and their feet.'\"(128)    Thus the peoples of the world are judged by their countenance. By it,  their misbelief, their faith, and their iniquity are all made manifest.  Even as it is evident in this day how the people of error are, by their  countenance, known and distinguished from the followers of divine  Guidance. Were these people, wholly for the sake of God and with no desire  but His good-pleasure, to ponder the verses of the Book in their heart,  they"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16984"],[0,"Prayers and Meditations (#20)"],[1,"of the  sweetness of Thy remembrance. I implore Thee, by Him Who is the King of  all names and their Sovereign, Who is the Revealer of all attributes and  their Creator, and by them who have soared aloft and drawn nigh unto Thee  and winged their flight into the atmosphere of Thy presence, and have  endured the galling of chains for Thy sake, to grant that all Thy people  may be graciously aided to recognize Him Who is the Manifestation of Thine  own Self, Who, because He summoned mankind unto Thee, hath been exiled and  cast into prison.    The tenderness of Thy mercy, O my Lord, surpasseth the fury of Thy wrath,  and Thy loving-kindness exceedeth Thy hot displeasure, and Thy grace  excelleth Thy justice. Hold Thou, through Thy wondrous favors and mercies,  the hands of Thy creatures, and suffer them not to be separated from the  grace which Thou hast ordained as the means whereby they can recognize  Thee. The glory of Thy might beareth me witness! Were such a thing to  happen, every soul would be sore shaken, every man endued with  understanding would be bewildered, and every possessor of knowledge would  be dumbfounded, except those who have been succored through the hands of  Thy Cause, and have been made the recipients of the revelations of Thy  grace and of the tokens of Thy favors.    I swear by Thy might, O my God! Wert Thou to regard Thy servants according  to their deserts in Thy days, they would assuredly merit naught except Thy  chastisement and torment. Thou art, however, the One Who is of great  bounteousness, Whose grace is immense. Look not down upon them, O my God,  with the glance of Thy justice, but rather with the eyes of Thy tender  compassions and mercies. Do, then, with them according to what beseemeth  Thy generosity and bountiful favor. Potent art Thou to do whatsoever may  please Thee. Incomparable art Thou. No God is there beside Thee, the Lord  of the throne on high and of earth below, the Ruler of this world and of  the world to come. Thou art the God of Bounty, the Ever-Forgiving, the  Great Giver, the Most Generous.    Do Thou bless, O Lord my God, the One through Whom the mysteries of Thine  omnipotence have been disclosed, through Whom the revelations of Thy  divinity have been glorified, through Whom the goodly pearls of Thy  knowledge and wisdom have been uncovered, through Whom Thy signs and  tokens have been noised abroad, through Whom Thy word hath been set forth  with clearness, through Whom the light of Thy countenance hath shone forth  and the power of Thy sovereignty been established. Bless Thou all those  also who, wholly for Thy sake, have turned towards Thee. Send down,  moreover, upon Him and them such of Thy wondrous mercies as may well  beseem Thy highness. Thou art, verily, the Almighty, the Help in Peril,  the All-Glorious, the Self-Subsisting.            LXXXII: \"PRAISED BE THOU, O LORD MY GOD! THOU ART HE...\"      Praised be Thou, O Lord my God! Thou art He Who hath created all things  through a word uttered by Thy behest, and fashioned the entire creation  through the power of Thy sovereignty and might. The mightiest of men are  abased before the revelations of Thy glory, and they who are endued with  strength tremble when faced with the evidences of Thy might. Every man of  insight is bereft of vision when confronted with the effulgence of the  glory of Thy face, and he who is possessed of riches is poor and desolate  when beholding the plenteousness of Thy wealth.    I implore Thee by Thine All-Glorious Name, wherewith Thou didst adorn all  the denizens of the kingdom of Thy revelation and the inmates of the  heaven of Thy will, to grant that my soul may be attracted by the  sweetness of the melody of the Bird of Heaven that chanteth amidst the  branches of the tree of Thy decree that Thou art God, that there is none  other God beside Thee.    Cleanse me with the waters of Thy mercy, O my Lord, and make me wholly  Thine, and cause me to approach the Tabernacle of Thy Cause and the adored  Sanctuary of Thy Presence. Ordain, then, for me all the things Thou didst  ordain for the chosen ones among Thy handmaidens, and rain down upon me  that which will illuminate my face and enlighten my heart.    Thou hast power to do what Thou willest, and Thou ordainest what Thou  pleasest.            LXXXIII: \"PRAISED BE THOU, O LORD MY GOD! THOU SEEST MY...\"      Praised be Thou, O Lord my God! Thou seest my poverty and my misery, my  troubles and my needs, my utter helplessness and my extreme lowliness, my  lamentations and my bitter wailing, the anguish of my soul and the  afflictions which beset me. The power of Thy might beareth me witness!  Such is the depth of mine abasement that Thy servants who have strayed far  from Thy path deride me. Thou knowest that I am recognized as the bearer  of Thy name among Thy creatures. Thou knowest that my station is but an  image of Thy station, that my virtues recount Thy virtues, that within  mine inmost being naught can be found except the revelations of Thy signs,  and that my very essence is but a reflection of the evidences of Thy  unity.    All these things Thou hast noised abroad among Thy creatures, in such wise  that none can recognize me, except as one who beareth Thy name. I swear by  Thy glory! My lamentations are not for the things which have befallen me  in Thy path, but are due to my recognition that by reason of mine  abasement the hearts of them that love Thee have been sore shaken, and the  souls of Thine adversaries have been so filled with joy that they rejoice  over those who have detached themselves from all except Thee and have  hastened towards the river of Thy remembrance and praise. So great is  their waywardness that when meeting Thy loved ones, they shake their heads  in derision of Thy Cause and say: \"Where is your Lord Whom ye mention in  the daytime and in the night season? Where is He to be found Whom ye call  your Sovereign, to Whom ye summon all men to turn?\" Their pride and  haughtiness waxed greater and greater until they denied the power of Thy  might and rejected Thy sovereignty and dominion.    Thy glory beareth me witness! I delight in mine own afflictions and in the  afflictions which they who love me suffer in Thy path. Neither I nor they,  however, are able to bear such affronts and reproaches as are uttered by  Thine enemies against Thy Self, the Unrestrained. How long shalt Thou  remain seated, O my God, on the throne of Thy forbearance and patience?  Speak Thou Thy word of wrath, O Thou Whom no eyes can see! Well-beloved is  Thy mercy unto the sincere among Thy servants, and well-beseeming Thy  chastisement of the infidels among Thine enemies. Send down upon them,  therefore, O my Lord, that which will unmistakably reveal unto them the  fury of Thy wrath and the ascendancy of Thy power, and will enable them to  recognize the weight of Thy might and the greatness of Thy strength. If  Thou refusest, O my God, to aid them that love Thee, assist Thou, then,  Thine own Self and Him Who is Thy Remembrance.    I entreat Thee by Thy name, that hath caused the ocean of Thy wrath to  surge, to chastise them who have repudiated Thy truth and disowned Thine  utterances. Abase them, then, by Thy might and power, and exalt such as  have, wholly for Thy sake, set their faces towards Thee, that through them  the ensigns of Thy glorification may be unfurled among all nations, and  Thy tokens be spread abroad among all peoples, and that all may testify  that Thou art God, that there is none other God beside Thee, the God of  power, of majesty and glory.            LXXXIV: \"MAGNIFIED ART THOU, O LORD MY GOD! I ASK THEE...\"      Magnified art Thou, O Lord my God! I ask Thee by Thy Name which Thou hast  set up above all other names, through which the veil of heaven hath been  split asunder and the Day-Star of Thy beauty hath risen above the horizon,  shining with the brightness of Thy Name, the Exalted, the Most High, to  succor me with Thy wondrous help and to preserve me in the shelter of Thy  care and protection.    I am one of Thy handmaidens, O my Lord! Unto Thee have I turned, and in  Thee have I placed my trust. Grant that I may be so confirmed in my love  for Thee, and in fulfilling that which is well-pleasing unto Thee, that  neither the defection of the infidels among Thy people, nor the clamor of  the hypocrites among Thy creatures, may avail to keep me back from Thee.    Purge Thou mine ear, O my Lord, that I may hearken unto the verses sent  down unto Thee, and illuminate my heart with the light of Thy knowledge,  and loose my tongue that it may make mention of Thee and sing Thy praise.  By Thy might, O my God! My soul is wedded to none beside Thee, and my  heart seeketh none except Thine own Self.    No God is there beside Thee, the All-Glorious, the Great Giver, the  Forgiving, the Compassionate.            LXXXV: \"THESE ARE, O MY GOD, THE DAYS WHEREON THOU DIDST...\"      These are, O my God, the days whereon Thou didst enjoin Thy servants to  observe the fast. With it Thou didst adorn the preamble of the Book of Thy  Laws revealed unto Thy creatures, and didst deck forth the Repositories of  Thy commandments in the sight of all who are in Thy heaven and all who are  on Thy earth. Thou hast endowed every hour of these days with a special  virtue, inscrutable to all except Thee, Whose knowledge embraceth all  created things. Thou hast, also, assigned unto every soul a portion of  this virtue in accordance with the Tablet of Thy decree and the Scriptures  of Thine irrevocable judgment. Every leaf of these Books and Scriptures  Thou hast, moreover, allotted to each one of the peoples and kindreds of  the earth.    For Thine ardent lovers Thou hast, according to Thy decree, reserved, at  each daybreak, the cup of Thy remembrance, O Thou Who art the Ruler of  rulers! These are they who have been so inebriated with the wine of Thy  manifold wisdom that they forsake their couches in"]]]
