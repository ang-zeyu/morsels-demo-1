He comforted Bilek in his  affliction; he published a volume of sermons for the elders to read in  secret; he composed a number of stirring and triumphant hymns; and there  he penned the noble words still sung in the Brethren's Church:--       Praise God for ever.     Boundless is his favour,     To his Church and chosen flock,     Founded on Christ the Rock.    As he lay in his cell he pondered much on the sad fate of his Brethren.  At one time he heard a rumour that the Church was almost extinct. Some,  he knew, had fled to Poland. Some had settled in Moravia. Some, robbed  of lands and houses, were roaming the country as pedlars or earning a  scanty living as farm labourers. And some, alas! had lowered the flag  and joined the Church of Rome.    And yet Augusta had never abandoned hope. For ten years, despite a few  interruptions, he kept in almost constant touch, not only with his own  Brethren, but also with the Protestant world at large. He was still,  he thought, the loved and honoured leader; he was still the mightiest  religious force in the land; and now, in his dungeon, he sketched a plan  to heal his country's woes and form the true disciples of Christ into  one grand national Protestant army against which both Pope and Emperor  would for ever contend in vain.          CHAPTER XI. -- THE LAST DAYS OF AUGUSTA, 1560-1572.    To Augusta the prospect seemed hopeful. Great changes had taken place  in the Protestant world. The Lutherans in Germany had triumphed. The  religious peace of Augsburg had been consummated, The German Protestants  had now a legal standing. The great Emperor, Charles V., had resigned  his throne. His successor was his brother Ferdinand, the late King of  Bohemia. The new King of Bohemia was Ferdinand's eldest son, Maximilian  I. Maximilian was well disposed towards Protestants, and persecution in  Bohemia died away.    And now the Brethren plucked up heart again. They rebuilt their chapel  at their headquarters, Jungbunzlau. They presented a copy of  their Hymn-book to the King. They divided the Church into three  provinces--Bohemia, Moravia and Poland. They appointed George Israel  First Senior in Poland, John Czerny First Senior in Bohemia and Moravia,  and Cerwenka secretary to the whole Church.    But the Brethren had gone further still. As Augusta was the sole  surviving Bishop in the Church, the Brethren were in a difficulty. They  must not be without Bishops. But what were they to do? Were they to  wait till Augusta was set at liberty, or were they to elect new Bishops  without his authority? They chose the latter course, and Augusta was  deeply offended. They elected Czerny and Cerwenka to the office of  Bishops; they had them consecrated as Bishops by two Brethren in  priests' orders; and they actually allowed the two new Bishops to  consecrate two further Bishops, George Israel and Blahoslaw, the Church  Historian.    And even this was not the worst of the story. As he lay in his dungeon  forming plans for the Church he loved so well, it slowly dawned upon  Augusta that his Brethren were ceasing to trust him, and that the sun  of his power, which had shone so brightly, was now sloping slowly to its  setting. He heard of one change after another taking place without his  consent. He heard that the Council had condemned his sermons as too  learned and dry for the common people, and that they had altered them to  suit their own opinions. He heard that his hymns, which he had desired  to see in the new Hymn-book, had been mangled in a similar manner. His  Brethren did not even tell him what they were doing. They simply left  him out in the cold. What he himself heard he heard by chance, and that  was the \"most unkind cut of all.\" His authority was gone; his  position was lost; his hopes were blasted; and his early guidance, his  entreaties, his services, his sufferings were all, he thought, forgotten  by an ungrateful Church.    As Augusta heard of all these changes, a glorious vision rose before  his mind. At first he was offended, quarrelled with the Brethren, and  declared the new Bishops invalid. But at last his better feelings gained  the mastery. He would not sulk like a petted child; he would render his  Brethren the greatest service in his power. He would fight his way to  liberty; he would resume his place on the bridge, and before long he  would make the Church the national Church of Bohemia.    The door was opened by a duke. The Archduke Ferdinand, brother of the  King, came to reside at Puerglitz {1560.}. Augusta appealed for liberty  to Ferdinand; the Archduke referred the matter to the King; the King  referred the matter to the clergy; and the clergy drew up for Augusta's  benefit a form of recantation. The issue before him was now perfectly  clear. There was one road to freedom and one only. He must sign the form  of recantation in full. The form was drastic. He must renounce all  his previous religious opinions. He must acknowledge the Holy Catholic  Church and submit to her in all things. He must eschew the gatherings of  Waldenses, Picards and all other apostates, denounce their teaching as  depraved, and recognise the Church of Rome as the one true Church of  Christ. He must labour for the unity of the Church and endeavour to  bring his Brethren into the fold. He must never again interpret the  Scriptures according to his own understanding, but submit rather to the  exposition and authority of the Holy Roman Church, which alone was fit  to decide on questions of doctrine. He must do his duty by the King,  obey him and serve him with zeal as a loyal subject. And finally he must  write out the whole recantation with his own hand, take a public oath  to keep it, and have it signed and sealed by witnesses. Augusta refused  point blank. His hopes of liberty vanished. His heart sank in despair.  \"They might as well,\" said Bilek, his friend, \"have asked him to walk on  his head.\"    But here Lord Sternberg, Governor of the Castle, suggested another path.  If Augusta, said he, would not join the Church of Rome, perhaps he would  at least join the Utraquists. He had been a Utraquist in his youth; the  Brethren were Utraquists under another name; and all that Augusta had to  do was to give himself his proper name, and his dungeon door would fly  open. Of all the devices to entrap Augusta, this well-meant trick was  the most enticing. The argument was a shameless logical juggle.  The Utraquists celebrated the communion in both kinds; the Brethren  celebrated the communion in both kinds; therefore the Brethren were  Utraquists.[42] At first Augusta himself appeared to be caught.    \"I, John Augusta,\" he wrote, \"confess myself a member of the whole  Evangelical Church, which, wherever it may be, receives the body and  blood of the Lord Jesus Christ in both kinds. I swear that, along with  the Holy Catholic Church, I will maintain true submission and obedience  to her chief Head, Jesus Christ. I will order my life according to God's  holy word and the truth of his pure Gospel. I will be led by Him, obey  Him alone, and by no other human thoughts and inventions. I renounce  all erroneous and wicked opinions against the holy universal Christian  apostolic faith. I will never take any part in the meetings of Picards  or other heretics.\"    If Augusta thought that by language like this he would catch his  examiners napping, he was falling into a very grievous error. He  had chosen his words with care. He never said what he meant by the  Utraquists. He never said whether he would include the Brethren among  the Utraquists or among the Picards and heretics. And he had never made  any reference to the Pope.    His examiners were far too clever to be deceived. Instead of  recommending that Augusta be now set at liberty, they contended that his  recantation was no recantation at all. He had shown no inclination, they  said, towards either Rome or Utraquism. His principles were remarkably  like those of Martin Luther. He had not acknowledged the supremacy of  the Pope, and when he said he would not be led by any human inventions  he was plainly repudiating the Church of Rome. What is the good, they  asked, of Augusta's promising to resist heretics when he does not  acknowledge the Brethren to be heretics? \"It is,\" they said, \"as  clear as day that John Augusta has no real intention of renouncing his  errors.\" Let the man say straight out to which party he belonged.    Again Augusta tried to fence, and again he met his match. Instead of  saying in plain language to which party he belonged, he persisted in  his first assertion that he belonged to the Catholic Evangelical Church,  which was now split into various sects. But as the old man warmed to his  work he threw caution aside.    \"I have never,\" he said, \"had anything to do with Waldenses or Picards.  I belong to the general Evangelical Church, which enjoys the Communion  in both kinds. I renounce entirely the Popish sect known as the Holy  Roman Church. I deny that the Pope is the Vicar of Christ. I deny that  the Church of Rome alone has authority to interpret the Scriptures. If  the Church of Rome claims such authority, she must first show that  she is free from the spirit of the world, and possesses the spirit of  charity, and until that is done I refuse to bow to her decrees.\"    He defended the Church of the Brethren with all his might. It was,  he said, truly evangelical. It was Catholic. It was apostolic. It was  recognised and praised by Luther, Calvin, Melancthon, Bucer, Bullinger  and other saints. As long as the moral life of the Church of Rome  remained at such a low ebb, so long would there be need for the  Brethren's Church.    \"If the Church of Rome will mend her ways, the Brethren,\" said he, \"will  return to her fold;"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21003"],[0,"Bell's Cathedrals: The Cathedral Church of Ely (#20)"],[1,"above, and the arms of the knights being  placed beside their heads. Some of the names are still to be found among  the nobility and gentry of England, and in some instances the very same  armorial bearings are used. This is the case in the families of Lacy,  St. Leger, Montfort, Clare, Touchet, Furnival, Fulke, Newbury, Lucy,  Talbot, Fitzallen, Longchamp. It need hardly be pointed out that no  contemporary Norman painting could have given such shields of arms to  the different knights, heraldry having only established itself as a  science in England in the thirteenth century.    The affairs of the abbey had been in a very unsettled state since the  time when the Camp of Refuge was attacked, so many of the estates of the  church having been granted to Norman followers of the Conqueror. But the  king's resentment at last gave way, and he was induced to sanction an  inquiry into the rights and liberties of the monastery. He appointed his  brother Odo, then Bishop of Bayeux, to summon an assembly of barons,  sheriffs, and others interested in the matter, to consider and determine  the claims of the monks. The meeting was held at Kentford, in Suffolk;  and the report was so favourable that the king directed the church to be  put into possession of all the rights, customs, and privileges which it  enjoyed at the time of King Edward's death.    Godfrey, the administrator, being made Abbot of Malmesbury, an abbot was  at length given to Ely in the person of #Simeon# (1081-1093). He was  prior of Winchester, and brother to Walkelin, Bishop of Winchester. He  was very old when he came to Ely; but though upwards of eighty-six years  of age at the time, he remained abbot for more than twelve years. He  laid the foundations of the present church, and completed some part of  the building, as has been previously told. He died in 1093.[13]    King William II. immediately took possession of the abbey estates, let  them to various tenants, and appointed a receiver to pay the rents into  his treasury. This arrangement lasted during the remainder of his reign.    King Henry I., upon coming to the throne, at once \"restored the  liberties\" of the church, and made Richard (1100-1107) abbot. He was a  Norman and a kinsman of the king, as his grandfather, Earl Gilbert, was  descended from Robert, Duke of Normandy. He successfully resisted the  claim of the Bishop of Lincoln to give him benediction, though Simeon  had received benediction from Bishop Remigius. In the Council of London,  in 1102, Abbot Richard, with many others, was deposed. \"Anselmus  archiepiscopus, concilio convocato apud Londiniam, rege consentiente,  plures deposuit abbates vel propter simoniam vel propter aliam vitae  infamiam.\"[14] The abbots of Burgh, Ramsey, and Ely were three of nine  so deposed. The \"Liber Eliensis\" attributes Richard's deposition to the  intrigues of the Court. The pope annulled the sentence in the following  year. This abbot proceeded with the building of the church, and seems to  have finished the Norman transepts and choir, and perhaps the whole of  the Norman tower. He is, however, most worthy of note from having been  the first to suggest the creation of the See of Ely. He submitted the  idea to the king, who was quite favourable; and he then sent messengers  to the pope to obtain his approval. Before this could be secured the  abbot died, but in little more than two years after his death the  proposal was carried into effect.    Richard was the last of the ten abbots. Hervey, Bishop of Bangor, had  the management of the affairs of the abbey for the next two years. His  rigorous discipline at Bangor had aroused very violent opposition, which  came at last to armed insurrection, and the bishop had withdrawn to the  king's court for safety. When appointed administrator of the abbey at  Ely, he exerted himself to bring to a successful conclusion the creation  of the bishopric. The consent of the Bishop of Lincoln to the  subdivision of his diocese was secured by a grant of the Manor of  Spaldwick. At a Council of London in 1108 the enormous size of the  Lincoln diocese was under consideration; and Ely seemed on every account  to be the best place for the cathedral of a new diocese to be taken from  it. The pope was entirely favourable to the design. Though the letters  announcing the pope's consent were dated November 21st, 1108, it was not  till October, 1109, that the king granted his charter for constituting  the bishopric. In this he nominated Hervey to be the first bishop, in  accordance with the recommendation of the pope himself.    The monastery did not come to an end by the substitution of a bishop for  an abbot. But for the purposes of this handbook, concerned as it is  mainly with the fabric of the cathedral, the remainder of the historical  portion will be associated with the names of the bishops--not that, by  any means, the most important works connected with the church were due  to the initiation of the bishops, nor was the cost always, or indeed  generally, defrayed by them. The monastic body spent large sums upon the  building, as has been seen in the case of the octagon: but these works  are mostly to be credited to the whole body, and, except in a few cases,  which are duly noticed, are not assigned specially to the prior who was  the head of the house at the time.

[7] The success of this attempt may have encouraged the monks to         make a similar effort some fifty years later. The body of S.         Felix, the first of the East Anglian bishops, had been interred         at Soham, where he is said to have founded a monastery. Soham was         also at first, before the removal of the seat of the bishopric to         Dunwich, the headquarters of his diocese. Felix had indeed first         been buried at Dunwich, but (probably from fear of the Danes) the         body had been removed to Soham. But Soham itself, in its turn,         was utterly destroyed by the Danes, and the remains of the bishop         became neglected. In 1020 the Abbot of Ramsey obtained permission         to move them to his abbey; and while he was doing this, the monks         of Ely set out with the intention of intercepting the convoy and         securing the body for their own church. A dense fog prevented the         Ely men from reaching the monks of Ramsey.       [8] \"Annals of England,\" i., p. 115.

[14] \"Chronicon Angliae Petriburgense,\" _sub anno_ 1102.          CHAPTER V.    HISTORY OF THE SEE.      Ely thus became a cathedral--of the kind that was called conventual  cathedrals. No such cathedral had a dean and canons till the time of  Henry VIII. The prior and convent were the custodians of the fabric, and  perhaps to a certain extent they acted as the bishop's council; and the  bishop, as representing the abbot, had the right to preside in the  chapter-house whenever he chose.[1] The bishop also had the power of  appointing several of the officers of the monastery, and of displacing  them. At Ely the priors were appointed by the bishop until 1198. In 1197  the offices of bishop and prior were vacant at the same time, and the  convent was unable to elect a bishop without having a prior: so the  Archbishop of Canterbury authorised the monks to proceed to the election  of a prior; and it is believed that subsequent priors were all elected  by the monks, and not appointed by the bishop.    The first bishop, as has been seen, was #Hervey# (1109-1131), Bishop  of Bangor.[2] He had been consecrated in 1102. His ecclesiastical  discipline in Wales was very strict, and he made many enemies; and he  thought to carry out his spiritual censures with the help of armed  forces, but insurrections arose, in one of which his own brother and  several of his company were slain. Upon this Bishop Hervey made his way  to the English court, where he remained until he was sent to take charge  of Ely monastery at the death of Abbot Richard. He was bishop here for  nearly twenty-two years, and was most active and painstaking in managing  the very difficult business of settling the affairs of the bishopric and  monastery in such a way that justice was done to both. He died in 1131.    After two years #Nigel# (1133-1169) was made bishop. He was  Prebendary of S. Paul's and also Treasurer to King Henry I. This latter  office necessitated his continuous absence from his diocese, and may  also serve to explain the very active part he took in the civil wars. He  espoused the cause of the Empress Matilda,"]]]
