Then he  thought again of home, and wondered what they would think of him,  feeling sure that they would believe him to have behaved badly.    His heart ached as he recalled all the past, and how much his present  position was due to his own folly and discontent, while, at the end of  every scene he evoked, came the thought that no matter how he repented,  it was too late--too late!    \"How are you now, Jem?\" he asked once or twice, as he tried to pierce  the utter darkness; but there was no answer, and at last he relieved the  weariness of his position by moving close up to the wall, so as to lean  his back against it, and in this position, despite all his trouble, his  head drooped forward till his chin rested upon his chest, and he fell  fast asleep for what seemed to him only a few minutes, when he started  into wakefulness on feeling himself roughly shaken.    \"Rouse up, my lad, sharp!\"    And looking wonderingly about him, he clapped one hand over his eyes to  keep off the glare of an open lanthorn.        CHAPTER SEVENTEEN.    ON BOARD.    It was a strange experience, and half asleep and confused, Don could  hardly make out whether he was one of the captives of the press-gang, or  a prisoner being conveyed to gaol in consequence of Mike Bannock's  charge.    All seemed to be darkness, and the busy gang of armed men about him  worked in a silent, furtive way, hurrying their prisoners, of whom, as  they all stood together in a kind of yard behind some great gates, there  seemed to be about a dozen, some injured, some angry and scowling, and  full of complaints and threats now that they were about to be conveyed  away; but every angry remonstrance was met by one more severe, and  sometimes accompanied by a tap from the butt of a pistol, or a blow  given with the hilt or flat of a cutlass.    \"This here's lively, Mas' Don,\" said Jem, as he stood beside his  companion in misfortune.    \"I want to speak to the principal officer,\" said Don, excitedly.  \"We  must not let them drive us off as if we were sheep.\"    \"Will you take a bit of good advice, my lad?\" said a familiar voice at  his ear.    \"If it is good advice,\" said Don, sharply.    \"Then hold your tongue, and go quietly.  I'll speak to the lieutenant  when we get aboard.\"    Don glanced sharply at the bluff-looking boatswain who had spoken, and  he seemed to mean well; but in Don's excitement he could not be sure,  and one moment he felt disposed to make a bold dash for liberty, as soon  as the gates were opened, and then to shout for help; the next to appeal  to his fellow-prisoners to make a bold fight for liberty; and while  these thoughts were running one over another in his mind, a sharp order  was given, the gates were thrown open, and they were all marched down a  narrow lane, dimly lit by one miserable oil lamp at the end.    Almost as they reached the end the familiar odour, damp and seaweedy, of  the tide reached Don's nostrils; and directly after he found himself  being hurried down a flight of wet and slippery stone steps to where a  lanthorn showed a large boat, into which he was hurried along with the  rest.  Then there was the sensation of movement, as the boat rose and  fell.  Fresh orders.  The splash of oars.  A faint creaking sound where  they rubbed on the tholes, and then the regular measured dip, dip, and  splash, splash.    \"Tide runs sharp,\" said a deep voice.  \"Give way, my lads, or we shall  be swept by her; that's it.\"    Don listened to all this as if it were part of a dream, while he gazed  wildly about at the dimly-seen moving lights and the black,  shadowy-looking shapes of the various vessels which kept on looming up,  till after gradually nearing a light away to his left, the boat was  suddenly run up close to a great black mass, which seemed to stand up  out of the water that was lapping her sides.    Ten minutes later the boat in which he had come off was hanging to the  davits, and he, in company with his fellows, was being hurried down into  a long low portion of the 'tween decks, with a couple of lanthorns  swinging their yellow light to and fro, and trying to make haloes, while  an armed marine stood sentry at the foot of the steps leading up on  deck.    Every one appeared too desolate and despondent to say much; in fact, as  Don sat upon the deck and looked at those who surrounded him, they all  looked like so many wounded men in hospital, or prisoners of war, in  place of being Englishmen--whose duty henceforth was to be the defence  of their country.    \"Seems rum, don't it?\" said Jem in a whisper.  \"Makes a man feel wild to  be laid hold on like this.\"    \"It's cruel!  It's outrageous!\" cried Don, angrily.    \"But here we are, and--what's that there noise?\" said Jem, as a good  deal of shouting and trampling was heard on deck.  Then there was a  series of thumps and more trampling and loud orders.    \"Are they bringing some more poor wretches on board, Jem?\"    \"Dunno.  Don't think so.  Say, Mas' Don, I often heared tell of the  press-gang, and men being took; but I didn't know it was so bad as  this.\"    \"Wait till morning, Jem, and I hope we shall get justice done to us.\"    \"Then they'll have to do it sharp, for it's morning now, though it's so  dark down here, and I thought we were moving; can't you feel?\"    Jem was quite right; the sloop was under weigh.  Morning had broken some  time; and at noon that day, the hope of being set at liberty was growing  extremely small, for the ship was in full sail, and going due west.        CHAPTER EIGHTEEN.    JEM IS HUNGRY.    The first time the pressed men were mustered Don was well prepared.    \"You leave it to me, Jem,\" he whispered.  \"I'll wait till our turn  comes, and then I shall speak out to the officer and tell him how we've  been treated.\"    \"You'd better make haste, then, Mas' Don, for if the thing keeps on  moving like this, I sha'n't be able to stand and hear what you have to  say.\"    For a good breeze was blowing from the south coast, sufficient to make  the waves curl over, and the sloop behave in rather a lively way; the  more so that she had a good deal of canvas spread, and heeled over and  dipped her nose sufficiently to admit a great wave from time to time to  well splash the forward part of the deck.    Don made no reply, for he felt white, but he attributed it to the mental  excitement from which he suffered.    There were thirty pressed men on deck, for the most part old sailors  from the mercantile marine, and these men were drafted off into various  watches, the trouble to the officers being that of arranging the fate of  the landsmen, who looked wretched in the extreme.    \"'Pon my word, Jones,\" said a smart-looking, middle-aged man in uniform,  whom Don took to be the first lieutenant, \"about as sorry a lot of  Bristol sweepings as ever I saw.\"    \"Not bad men, sir,\" said the petty officer addressed.  \"Wait till  they've shaken down into their places.\"    \"Now's your time, Mas' Don,\" whispered Jem.  \"Now or never.\"    Don was on the alert, but just as the officer neared them the vessel  gave a sudden pitch, and of the men standing in a row the minute before,  not one remained upon his feet.  For it seemed as if the deck had  suddenly dropped down; and as Don and Jem rolled over into the lee  scuppers, they were pretty well doused by the water that came splashing  over the bows, and when, amidst a shout of laughter from the sailors,  the order was given for them to get up and form in line again, Jem clung  tightly to Don, and said, dolefully,--    \"It's of no use, Mas' Don; I can't.  It's like trying to stand on  running barrels; and--oh, dear me!--I do feel so precious bad.\"    Don made no reply, but caught at the side of the vessel, for everything  around seemed to be swimming, and a peculiarly faint sensation had  attacked him, such as he had never experienced before.    \"There, send 'em all below,\" said the officer, who seemed half angry,  half-amused.  \"Pretty way this is, of manning His Majesty's ships.  There, down with you.  Get 'em all below.\"    Don did not know how he got below.  He had some recollection of knocking  the skin off his elbows, and being half dragged into a corner of the  lower deck, where, for three days, he lay in the most abjectly miserable  state, listening to the sighs and groans of his equally unfortunate  companions, and the remarks of Jem, who kept up in his waking moments a  running commentary on the miseries of going to sea.    \"It's wuss than anything I ever felt or saw,\" he muttered.  \"I've been  ill, and I've been in hospital, but this here's about the most terrible.  I say, Mas' Don, how do you feel now?\"    \"As if I'd give anything to have the ship stopped, for us to be set  ashore.\"    \"No, no, you can't feel like that, Mas' Don, because that's exactly how  I feel.  I am so ill.  Well, all I can say is that it serves the captain  and the lieutenant and all the rest of 'em jolly well right for  press-ganging me.\"    \"What do you mean?\" said Don, dolefully.    \"Why, that they took all that trouble to bring me aboard to make a  sailor of me, and they'll never do it.  I'm fit to go into a hospital,  and that's about all I'm fit for.  Sailor?  Why, I can't even stand  upright on the precious deck.\"    \"Well, my lads,\" said a hearty voice just then; \"how long are you going  to play at being old women?  Come, rouse a bit.\"    \"No, thankye, sir,\" said Jem, in a miserable tone.  \"Bit?  I haven't bit  anything since I've been aboard.\"    \"Then rouse up, and bite something now,\" cried the boatswain.  \"Come, my  lad,\" he continued, turning to Don, \"you've got too much stuff in you to  lie about like this.  Jump up, and come on deck in the fresh air.\"    \"I feel so weak, sir; I don't think I could stand.\"    \"Oh, yes, you can,\" said the boatswain.  \"That's better.  If you give  way to it, you'll be here for a week.\"    \"Are we nearly there,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21324"],[0,"Recollections of Old Liverpool (#20)"],[1,"seems to have departed from this town most strangely.  The last remnant  of it was in the works that were in operation down by the river-side near  the present Toxteth Docks.  Watch-making has always been a great trade in  Liverpool.  The first introducer of it was Mr. Wyke, who lived in  Dale-street, on the site of the present public offices.  Mr. Wyke came  from Prescot, and carried on a large trade in watches about the year  1758.  Mr. Litherland, the inventor of the chronometer, died in  Church-street.  On Mr. Wyke's premises and garden the Gas Works were  afterwards erected, which were removed to Newington some few years ago.  Amongst many others I have seen some very remarkable changes that have  taken place about Bevington-hill.  I recollect very well what is now  called \"Summer Seat\" being gardens, and the view from them to the river  quite uninterrupted.  There was near them a house built by a shoemaker  who had made a fortune by his trade; it was called \"Lapstone Hall.\"  The  inn called the \"Bush\" had a bough hanging out with the motto \"Good Wine  Needs no Bush.\"  The sailors were very fond of going up to Bevington-Bush  on Sundays with their sweethearts, and many a boisterous scene have I  witnessed there.  The view was really beautiful from the gardens.  Where  the market stands in Scotland-road there used to be a large stone quarry.  The houses in Scotland-road beyond the market are all of very late  erection.  I can well recollect open fields and market gardens  thereabouts, and, indeed, all the way up where Scotland-road now is,  there used to be fields.  The Preston-road wound round up Bevington-Bush.  The Everton range looked very pretty from the Kirkdale-road, especially  when handsome mansions began to dot its crest.  I recollect along this  road cornfields, meadows and gardens.  Scotland-road is a comparatively  newly-formed thoroughfare.  Any one turning to the left at the bottom of  Scotland-road, and going to Bevington-Bush will see, in those old houses  on the right hand, of what Liverpool, in my young days, was composed.  Very few specimens of the old town houses are now remaining, so speedily  do they become modernized and altered.  I like those quaint old buildings  although they were not very comfortable within, from their narrow windows  and low ceilings, but there has been a great deal of mirth and jollity in  some of those old low-roofed houses in the town, in our great  privateering and slave-dealing times.    I have often heard old people talk about _their_ \"Recollections\" of the  town.  I have heard them speak of Clayton-square being laid out in the  memorable year of 1745.  Mrs. or Madame Clayton to whose family this part  of the town chiefly belonged, was the daughter of Mr. Clayton who was  Mayor in 1689, and who represented the town in parliament for eight  sessions.  Madame Clayton's house stood near Cases-street.  Her garden  was said to have been the best kept and most productive in the town.  It  was this lady who started the first private carriage in Liverpool.  I  have heard it said that people used to stare at it, as if it was  something wonderful.  The streets about Church-street are all called  after the old families.  Parker-street was called after Mr. Parker, of  Cuerdon, who married Miss Ann Clayton.  Their daughter Jane married one  of the Tarletons.  Tarleton-street is named after Colonel Banastre  Tarleton.  Banastre-street is named after him also.  Houghton-street is  after the old Houghton family.  Williamson-square was laid out in 1745 by  Mr. Williamson.  Basnett-street was called after the Basnetts, at one  time a very influential family of old Liverpool; Leigh-street after the  Leighs; Cases-street after the Cases.  Mr. Rose, who projected many  streets at the north end of the town on his extensive property, seems to  have adopted the poets' names to distinguish his thoroughfares, as in  Chaucer, Ben Jonson, Juvenal, Virgil, Dryden, Milton, Sawney (Alexander)  Pope-street, etc.  Meadows-street, Scotland-road, was named after Mr.  William Meadows, who married six wives.  His first wife lived two years.  He next married Peggy Robinson, who lived twenty years, and bore him  children; after being a widower a month, he again married.  This wife  lived two years.  After remaining a widower seven weeks, he married his  fourth wife, who lived eighteen years.  After a nine months' single  blessedness he again married.  After his fifth wife's death he remained a  widower thirty-four weeks, and at the age of seventy-five, on the 10th of  June, 1807, he married Miss Ann Lowe, of Preston-street.  William Meadows  was thought to be a bold man.  Maguire-street was named after Mr. Maguire  who kept a shop in Lord-street.  Benson-street was called after Moses  Benson, Esq.  Bixteth-street after Alderman Bixteth, who is said \"to have  been publicly thanked by the authorities for paving the front of his  house with his own hands.\"  Pudsey-street after Pudsey Dawson.  Seel-street after Mr. Seel, who lived at the corner of it.  Wolstenholme-square and street, after an influential family of that name.  Bold-street after the Bolds, who built the first house in it: now  occupied by Mr. Dismore.  Colquitt-street after the Colquitts, whose  mansion was converted into the Royal Institution.  Berry-street, was  named after Captain Berry, who built the first house at the corner of  Bold-street.  Cropper-street after the Cropper family.  Fazakerly-street  after the Fazakerlys.  Oakes-street after Captain Oakes, who died in  1808.  Lydia Ann-street after Mademoiselle Lydia Ann De La Croix, who  married Mr. Perry, the originator of Fawcett's foundry, and the Coal  Brook Dale iron works.  Mason-street, Edge-hill, was named after Mr.  Mason, who built and endowed Edge-hill church, and whose mansion stood at  the corner of Mason-street, the gardens of which extended to the bottom  of Paddington.  James-street was named after Mr. Roger James, who held  large property in it.  Preeson's-row was named after Alderman Preeson,  who built his house and two others of the old Castle materials.  Part of  Castle-street is also constructed of the timbers and stones.  Old  Peter-street which ran out of School-lane has disappeared.  Crosshall-street was called after the Hall and gardens of the Crosses  which stood on the site of (or about) Manchester-street.  Part of  Fenwick-street was called Dry Bridge, a bridge passing over the Old  Ropery, the name of which is perpetuated in that street.  Holden's Weint  was re-named Brook-street.  Lower Stanley-street was re-named  Button-street, after Mr. Button, who lived to a great age, and saw I  don't know how many king's reigns.  The streets of Liverpool seem to have  been named, in some parts of the town, as it were, in classes, as I have  mentioned.  Mr. Rose called his new thoroughfares after the poets, and in  another neighbourhood we find the names of celebrated commanders  affording street-titles as in Blake-street, Duncan-street (afterwards  Hotham-street), Clarence-street, Russell-street,  Rodney-street,  Seymour-street, Rupert-street, etc.  While on the site of the old Botanic  Gardens at the top of Oxford-street, we find Laurel-street, Grove-street,  Oak, Vine, and Myrtle-streets.  In Kensington, on the site of Dr.  Solomon's property, we have streets named after celebrated lawyers, and  this locality is jocosely called \"Judge's Land.\"  We have streets  thereabout bearing the names of Cottenham, Coltman, Wightman, Patteson,  Pollock, and Coleridge, and there may also be found a Gilead and a  Solomon-street.    By the way, a reference to Dr. Solomon's property, at Kensington, reminds  me of the good stories that were current in Liverpool about the worthy  doctor himself.  I recollect one wherein the laugh was loud at the  Custom-house authorities, who had been nicely bitten by a seizure they  had made of some of the doctor's \"exports.\"  It was said that a quantity  of \"Balm of Gilead,\" upon which drawback was claimed, had been seized by  the Custom-house people as not being of the specified value to entitle  Dr. Solomon to claim so large an amount of drawback.  The doctor was, as  may be supposed, very wrath at his \"goots\" being waylaid, but he  determined upon revenge.  Making up a lot of sugar and water,  well-flavoured with spice, the doctor entered a large case \"outward,\"  declaring it to be of the same value as the former seized case.  The trap  fell, and the Custom-house authorities were caught, to the intense  satisfaction of the doctor, who told them he \"vould teach them to seize  his goots!\"    Another story is told of the doctor once entertaining a party of  gentlemen at Gilead House (as was often his custom), and towards the  close of the evening, some one began joking the doctor about his \"Balm of  Gilead.\"  The doctor bore the jesting very well, and on being told he  ought to let those present taste it, readily consented to open a few  bottles.  Now this Balm, I believe, was very good, and was made, it was  said, of strong alcohol or brandy, and the richest spices.  The bottles  of \"Balm\" passed round and were duly appreciated.  On the guests  preparing to leave, they were presented with \"a little bill\" amounting to  about a guinea each for the Balm of Gilead which had been consumed.  The  doctor telling them that it was by means of the \"Balm\" he lived, and  through the \"Balm\" he was enabled to invite them to partake of his really  bountiful hospitality.  Each guest paid his bill, admitting that the  doctor was right, and that they had merited the reproof so properly  administered to them.    The doctor used to drive a handsome team of four horses, and, of course,  attracted a good deal of attention whenever he made his appearance in the  streets.  On one occasion the late Lord Sefton, who was through life a  first-rate whip, drove up to Heywood's bank in his usual dashing style.  Dr. Solomon was tooling along behind"]]]
