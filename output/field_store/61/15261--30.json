But ever the Black Bull trod the brambles underfoot and  chose the easiest paths, while she ate out of his left ear and drank out  of his right, and wanted for nothing, though he had neither bite nor  sup. So it came to pass that he grew tired and was limping with one foot  when, just as the sun was setting, they came to a beautiful palace where  Princes and Princesses were disporting themselves with ball on the green  grass. Now, though the company greatly wondered at the strange  companions, they asked the girl to join them, and ordered the grooms to  lead away the Black Bull to a field.    But she, remembering all he had done for her, said, \"Not so! He will  stay with me!\" Then seeing a large thorn in the foot with which he had  been limping, she stooped down and pulled it out.    And, lo and behold! in an instant, to every one's surprise, there  appeared, not a frightful monstrous bull, but one of the most beautiful  Princes ever beheld, who fell at his deliverer's feet, thanking her for  having broken his cruel enchantment.    A wicked witch-woman who wanted to marry him had, he said, spelled him  until a beautiful maiden of her own free will should do him a favour.    \"But,\" he said, \"the danger is not all over. You have broken the  enchantment by night; that by day has yet to be overcome.\"    So the next morning the Prince had to resume the form of a bull, and  they set out together; and they rode, and they rode, and they rode, till  they came to a dark and ugsome glen. And here he bade her dismount and  sit on a great rock.    \"Here you must stay,\" he said, \"while I go yonder and fight the Old One.  And mind! move neither hand nor foot whilst I am away, else I shall  never find you again. If everything around you turns blue, I shall have  beaten the Old One; but if everything turns red, he will have conquered  me.\"    And with that, and a tremendous roaring bellow, he set off to find his  foe.    Well, she sate as still as a mouse, moving neither hand nor foot, nor  even her eyes, and waited, and waited, and waited. Then at last  everything turned blue. But she was so overcome with joy to think that  her lover was victorious that she forgot to keep still, and lifting one  of her feet, crossed it over the other!    So she waited, and waited, and waited. Long she sate, and aye she  wearied; and all the time he was seeking for her, but he never found  her.    At last she rose and went she knew not whither, determined to seek for  her lover through the whole wide world. So she journeyed on, and she  journeyed on, and she journeyed on, until one day in a dark wood she  came to a little hut where lived an old, old woman who gave her food and  shelter, and bid her God-speed on her errand, giving her three nuts, a  walnut, a filbert, and a hazel nut, with these words:      \"When your heart is like to break,       And once again is like to break,     Crack a nut and in its shell       That will be that suits you well.\"    After this she felt heartened up, and wandered on till her road was  blocked by a great hill of glass; and though she tried all she could to  climb it, she could not; for aye she slipped back, and slipped back, and  slipped back; for it was like ice.    Then she sought a passage elsewhere, and round and about the foot of the  hill she went sobbing and wailing, but ne'er a foothold could she find.  At last she came to a smithy; and the smith promised if she would serve  him faithfully for seven years and seven days, that he would make her  iron shoon wherewith to climb the hill of glass. So for seven long years  and seven short days she toiled, and span, and swept, and washed in the  smith's house. And for wage he gave her a pair of iron shoon, and with  them she clomb the glassy hill and went on her way.    Now she had not gone far before a company of fine lords and ladies rode  past her talking of all the grand doings that were to be done at the  young Duke of Norroway's wedding. Then she passed a number of people  carrying all sorts of good things which they told her were for the  Duke's wedding. And at last she came to a palace castle where the  courtyards were full of cooks and bakers, some running this way, some  running that, and all so busy that they did not know what to do first.    Then she heard the horns of hunters and cries of \"Room! Room for the  Duke of Norroway and his bride!\"    And who should ride past but the beautiful Prince she had but half  unspelled, and by his side was the witch-woman who was determined to  marry him that very day.    Well! at the sight she felt that her heart was indeed like to break, and  over again was like to break, so that the time had come for her to crack  one of the nuts. So she broke the walnut, as it was the biggest, and out  of it came a wonderful wee woman carding wool as fast as ever she could  card.    Now when the witch-woman saw this wonderful thing she offered the girl  her choice of anything in the castle for it.    \"If you will put off your wedding with the Duke for a day, and let me  watch in his room to-night,\" said the girl, \"you shall have it.\"    Now, like all witch-women, the bride wanted everything her own way, and  she was so sure she had her groom safe, that she consented; but before  the Duke went to rest she gave him, with her own hands, a posset so made  that any one who drank it would sleep till morning.    Thus, though the girl was allowed alone into the Duke's chamber, and  though she spent the livelong night sighing and singing:      \"Far have I sought for thee,     Long have I wrought for thee,     Near am I brought to thee,     Dear Duke o' Norroway;     Wilt thou say naught to me?\"    the Duke never wakened, but slept on. So when day came the girl had to  leave him without his ever knowing she had been there.    Then once again her heart was like to break, and over and over again  like to break, and she cracked the filbert nut, because it was the next  biggest. And out of it came a wonderful wee, wee woman spinning away as  fast as ever she could spin. Now when the witch-bride saw this wonderful  thing she once again put off her wedding so that she might possess it.  And once again the girl spent the livelong night in the Duke's chamber  sighing and singing:      \"Far have I sought for thee,     Long have I wrought for thee,     Near am I brought to thee,     Dear Duke o' Norroway;     Wilt thou say naught to me?\"    But the Duke, who had drunk the sleeping-draught from the hands of his  witch-bride, never stirred, and when dawn came the girl had to leave him  without his ever knowing she had been there.    Then, indeed, the girl's heart was like to break, and over and over and  over again like to break, so she cracked the last nut--the hazel  nut--and out of it came the most wonderful wee, wee, wee-est woman  reeling away at yarn as fast as she could reel.    And this marvel so delighted the witch-bride that once again she  consented to put off her wedding for a day, and allow the girl to watch  in the Duke's chamber the night through, in order to possess it.    Now it so happened that when the Duke was dressing that morning he heard  his pages talking amongst themselves of the strange sighing and singing  they had heard in the night; and he said to his faithful old valet,  \"What do the pages mean?\"    And the old valet, who hated the witch-bride, said:    \"If the master will take no sleeping-draught to-night, mayhap he may  also hear what for two nights has kept me awake.\"    At this the Duke marvelled greatly, and when the witch-bride brought  him his evening posset, he made excuse it was not sweet enough, and  while she went away to get honey to sweeten it withal, he poured away  the posset and made believe he had swallowed it.    So that night when dark had come, and the girl stole in to his chamber  with a heavy heart thinking it would be the very last time she would  ever see him, the Duke was really broad awake. And when she sate down by  his bedside and began to sing:                    \"Far have I sought for thee,\"    he knew her voice at once, and clasped her in his arms.    Then he told her how he had been in the power of the witch-woman and had  forgotten everything, but that now he remembered all and that the spell  was broken for ever and aye.    So the wedding feast served for their marriage, since the witch-bride,  seeing her power was gone, quickly fled the country and was never heard  of again.          CATSKIN      Once upon a time there lived a gentleman who owned fine lands and  houses, and he very much wanted to have a son to be heir to them. So  when his wife brought him a daughter, though she was bonny as bonny  could be, he cared nought for her, and said:    \"Let me never see her face.\"    So she grew up to be a beautiful maiden, though her father never set  eyes on her till she was fifteen years old and was ready to be married.    Then her father said roughly, \"She shall marry the first that comes for  her.\" Now when this became known, who should come along and be first but  a nasty, horrid old man! So she didn't know what to do, and went to the  hen-wife and asked her advice. And the hen-wife said, \"Say you will not  take him unless they give you a coat of silver cloth.\" Well, they gave  her a coat of silver cloth, but she wouldn't take him for all that, but  went again to the hen-wife, who said, \"Say you will not take him unless  they give you a coat of beaten gold.\" Well, they gave her a coat of  beaten gold, but still she would not take the old man, but went again  to the hen-wife, who said, \"Say you will not take him unless they give  you a coat made of the feathers of all the birds of the air.\" So they  sent out a man with a great heap of peas; and the man cried to all the  birds of the air, \"Each bird take a pea and put down a feather.\" So each"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17071"],[0,"Folk-Lore and Legends: Scotland (#20)"],[1,"o' the stanes in our countra, an' it was as roun' as a fit-ba';  I'm sure it wad ding Professor Couplan himsel' to tell what way it cam'  there.  Noo, fouk aye thought there was something uncanny about it, an'  some gaed the length o' saying that the deil used to bake ginshbread  upon't; and, as sure as ye're sitting there, frien', there was knuckle-  marks upon 't, for my ain father has seen them as aften as I have taes  an' fingers.  Aweel, ye see, Mauns Crawford, the last o' the Lairds o'  Federat, an' the deil had coost out (may be because the laird was just as  wicked an' as clever as he was himsel'), an' ye perceive the evil ane  wantit to play him a trick.  Noo, Mauns Crawford was ae day lookin' ower  his castle wa', and he saw a stalwart carle, in black claes, ridin' up  the loanin'.  He stopped at this chuckie o' a stane, an' loutin' himsel',  he took it up in his arms, and lifted it three times to his saddle-bow,  an' syne he rade awa out o' sight, never comin' near the castle, as Mauns  thought he would hae done.  'Noo,' says the baron till himsel', says he,  'I didna think that there was ony ane in a' the land that could hae  played sic a ploy; but deil fetch me if I dinna lift it as weel as he  did!'  Sae aff he gaed, for there wasna sic a man for birr in a' the  countra, an' he kent it as weel, for he never met wi' his match.  Weel,  he tried, and tugged, and better than tugged at the stane, but he coudna  mudge it ava; an' when he looked about, he saw a man at his ilbuck, a'  smeared wi' smiddy-coom, snightern an' laughin' at him.  The laird d---d  him, an' bade him lift it, whilk he did as gin 't had been a little  pinnin.  The laird was like to burst wi' rage at being fickled by sic a  hag-ma-hush carle, and he took to the stane in a fury, and lifted it till  his knee; but the weight o 't amaist ground his banes to smash.  He held  the stane till his een-strings crackit, when he was as blin' as a  moudiwort.  He was blin' till the day o' his death,--that's to say, if  ever he died, for there were queer sayings about it--vera queer! vera  queer!  The stane was ca'd Mauns' Stane ever after; an' it was no thought  that canny to be near it after gloaming; for what says the Psalm--hem!--I  mean the sang--       'Tween Ennetbutts an' Mauns' Stane     Ilka night there walks ane!    \"There never was a chief of the family after; the men were scattered, an'  the castle demolished.  The doo and the hoodie-craw nestle i' their  towers, and the hare mak's her form on their grassy hearth-stane.\"    \"Is this stone still to be seen?\"    \"Ou, na.  Ye see, it was just upon Johnie Forbes's craft, an' fouk cam'  far an' near to leuk at it, an' trampit down a' the puir cottar-body's  corn; sae he houkit a hole just aside it, and tumbled it intil 't; by  that means naebody sees't noo, but its weel kent that it's there, for  they're livin' yet wha've seen it.\"    \"But the well at the Abbey--did no one feel a desire to enrich himself  with the gold and silver buried there?\"    \"Hoot, ay; mony a ane tried to find out whaur it was, and, for that  matter, I've may be done as foolish a thing myself; but nane ever made it  out.  There was a scholar, like yoursel', that gaed ae night down to the  Abbey, an', ye see, he summoned up the deil.\"    \"The deuce he did!\" said I.    \"Weel, weel, the deuce, gin ye like it better,\" said he.  \"An' he was  gaun to question him where the treasure was, but he had eneuch to do to  get him laid without deaving him wi' questions, for a' the deils cam'  about him, like bees biggin' out o' a byke.  He never coured the fright  he gat, but cried out, 'Help! help!' till his very enemy wad hae been wae  to see him; and sae he cried till he died, which was no that lang after.  Fouk sudna meddle wi' sic ploys!\"    \"Most wonderful!  And do you believe that Beelzebub actually appeared to  him?\"    \"Believe it!  What for no?\" said he, consequentially tapping the lid of  his snuff-horn.  \"Didna my ain father see the evil ane i' the schule o'  Auld Deer?\"    \"Indeed!\"    \"Weel, I wot he did that.  A wheen idle callants, when the dominie was  out at his twal'-hours, read the Lord's Prayer backlans, an' raised him,  but couldna lay him again, for he threepit ower them that he wadna gang  awa unless he gat ane o' them wi' him.  Ye may be sure this put them in  an awfu' swither.  They were a' squallin' an' crawlin' and sprawlin' amo'  the couples to get out o' his grips.  Ane o' them gat out an' tauld the  maister about it, an' when he cam' down, the melted lead was runnin' aff  the roof o' the house wi' the heat, sae, flingin' to the black thief a  young bit kittlen o' the schule-mistress's, he sank through the floor wi'  an awsome roar.  I mysel' have heard the mistress misca'in her man about  offering up the puir thing, baith saul and body, to Baal.  But troth, I'm  no clear to speak o' the like o' this at sic a time o' night; sae if your  honour bena for another jug, I'll e'en wus you a gude-night, for it's  wearin' late, an I maun awa' to Skippyfair i' the mornin'.\"    I assented to this, and quickly lost in sleep the remembrance of all  these tales of the olden times.          \"HORSE AND HATTOCK.\"      The power of the fairies was not confined to unchristened children alone;  it was supposed frequently to be extended to full-grown people,  especially such as in an unlucky hour were devoted to the devil by the  execrations of parents and of masters; or those who were found asleep  under a rock, or on a green hill, belonging to the fairies, after sunset,  or, finally, to those who unwarily joined their orgies.  A tradition  existed, during the seventeenth century, concerning an ancestor of the  noble family of Duffers, who, \"walking abroad in the fields near to his  own house, was suddenly carried away, and found the next day at Paris, in  the French king's cellar, with a silver cup in his hand.  Being brought  into the king's presence, and questioned by him who he was, and how he  came thither, he told his name, his country, and the place of his  residence, and that on such a day of the month, which proved to be the  day immediately preceding, being in the fields, he heard a noise of a  whirlwind, and of voices crying 'Horse and hattock!' (this is the word  which the fairies are said to use when they remove from any place),  whereupon he cried 'Horse and hattock!' also, and was immediately caught  up and transported through the air by the fairies to that place, where,  after he had drunk heartily, he fell asleep, and before he woke the rest  of the company were gone, and had left him in the posture wherein he was  found.  It is said the king gave him a cup which was found in his hand,  and dismissed him.\"  The narrator affirms \"that the cup was still  preserved, and known by the name of the fairy cup.\"  He adds that Mr.  Steward, tutor to the then Lord Duffers, had informed him that, \"when a  boy at the school of Forres, he and his school-fellows were once upon a  time whipping their tops in the churchyard, before the door of the  church, when, though the day was calm, they heard a noise of a wind, and  at some distance saw the small dust begin to rise and turn round, which  motion continued advancing till it came to the place where they were,  whereupon they began to bless themselves; but one of their number being,  it seems, a little more bold and confident than his companion, said,  'Horse and hattock with my top!' and immediately they all saw the top  lifted up from the ground, but could not see which way it was carried, by  reason of a cloud of dust which was raised at the same time.  They sought  for the top all about the place where it was taken up, but in vain; and  it was found afterwards in the churchyard, on the other side of the  church.\"  This legend is contained in a letter from a learned gentleman  in Scotland to Mr. Aubrey, dated 15th March 1695, published in _Aubrey's  Miscellanies_.          SECRET COMMONWEALTH.      _By_ MR. ROBERT KIRK, _Minister of Aberfoyle_, 1691.    The Siths, or Fairies, they call _Sluagh Maith_, or the Goodpeople, it  would seem, to prevent the dint of their ill attempts (for the Irish used  to bless all they fear harm of), and are said to be of a middle nature  betwixt man and angel, as were demons thought to be of old, of  intelligent studious spirits, and light changeable bodies (like those  called astral), somewhat of the nature of a condensed cloud, and best  seen in twilight.  These bodies be so pliable through the subtlety of the  spirits that agitate them, that they can make them appear or disappear at  pleasure.  Some have bodies or vehicles so spongeous, thin, and defecat  [pure] that they are fed by only sucking into some fine spirituous  liquors, that pierce like pure air and oil; others feed more gross on the  foyson [abundance] or substance of corn and liquors, or corn itself that  grows on the surface of the earth, which these fairies steal away, partly  invisible, partly preying on the grain, as do crows and mice; wherefore  in this same age they are sometimes heard to break bread, strike hammers,  and to do such like services within the little hillocks they most do  haunt; some whereof of old, before the Gospel dispelled Paganism, and in  some barbarous places as yet, enter houses after all are at rest, and set  the kitchens in order, cleansing all the vessels.  Such drags go under  the name of Brownies.  When we have plenty, they have scarcity at their  homes; and, on the contrary (for they are not empowered to catch as much  prey everywhere as they please), their robberies, notwithstanding,  ofttimes occasion great ricks of corn not to bleed so well (as they call  it), or prove so copious by very far as was expected by the owner.    Their bodies of congealed air are sometimes carried aloft, other whiles  grovel in different shapes, and enter into any cranny or clift of the  earth where air enters, to their ordinary dwellings; the"]]]
