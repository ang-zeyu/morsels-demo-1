It has been on about three years, and I am told is materially  affected by oxidation. The theory is that zinc, though subject to  oxidization, has the peculiarity that the oxide does not scale off as  from iron, but forms a permanent coating impervious to the action of  the atmosphere. Some mechanics, however, assert that neither zinc,  copper, nor lead will withstand the action of our atmosphere, as  bituminous coal strongly impregnated with sulphur is almost the only  fuel used. It is claimed by some that the sulphurous acid in the  atmosphere tends to corrode zinc so as to make it worthless for roofs  or gutter linings. A. Are you sure that the roof and gutters in  question are not of galvanized iron, iron coated with zinc? This is  the material most commonly used for that purpose at the present time.  Zinc has been found to be too brittle for the strain to which it is  subjected, in such cases, by the expansion and contraction induced by  changes of temperature. A slight oxidation will adhere to the surface,  but an acid deposit from the atmosphere will penetrate the coating in  points and deteriorate the metal.    (5) N.J.S. says: I have a floor of ash and black walnut which has been  oiled with raw linseed oil once. How can I finish it so as to get a  hard, smooth finish that will not be scratched by boot heels nor be  sticky or retain the dirt as a waxed floor does? A. Oil raises the  fiber of black walnut and gives it a rougher surface than when free  from it. To polish any wood, it is only necessary to fill the pores  well, and then rub it down to a smooth surface. Thus painters prefer  to put on a coat of shellac varnish first, before oiling walnut and  other hard woods. For fine floors, a thin coat of liquid wax is  applied as a finish.    (6) A.J.S. asks: What is the best plan for putting up a cheap dry  house of lumber, for drying (by steam) white oak, hickory, and other  lumber used in wagon and buggy making? A. Make as tight a house as  possible with tongued and grooved siding-boards, floors, roof, etc.,  and provide a stack of steam pipe containing 1 foot of heating surface  to every 50 cubic feet of air contained in the building. Set the steam  pipe in compact shape and enclose it with a casing of galvanized sheet  iron open at the top; supply cold air from outside of the building by  a boxed conduit to the bottom of this stack. The air when heated will  rise and diffuse itself into the room, and as it cools will fall to  the floor; provide registers in the floor, through which it may escape  into other boxed tubes under the floor leading to an upright chimney  discharging above the roof. Let a smoke pipe from the boiler enter the  chimney and extend up inside the flue far enough to heat the same. The  change of air is necessary to dry the lumber. The size of the house of  course will depend upon the quantity of material required to be  stacked up into it at any one time.    (7) G. asks: 1. How do you calculate the amount of pipe of a given  size to warm a room of a given size? A. One square foot of plate or  pipe surface is generally taken as sufficient to heat about 70 cubic  feet of air in dwellings. 2. What allowance should be made for doors  and windows? A. The said foot of surface will heat, in accordance with  varying conditions, from 40 to 100 cubic feet of air, and allowance  should be made for extra exposures, to correspond with that scale. A  steam pressure of 5 lbs. is sufficient for heating purposes. 3. What  is meant by the terms direct and indirect radiation, in giving  capacity of steam generators for heating houses? A. Direct radiation  is used when the pipes are located in the room, and indirect when they  are located in a chamber in the cellar, to warm air which is conducted  to the room by air pipes.    (8) D.M. says: After reading L.S.W.'s reply to J.B.C., p. 75 (6), vol.  36, I think the following demonstration will be more acceptable to  J.B.C.: Imagine three spheres of which the given circles are great  circles, and a plane tangent to the three spheres. Any two of the  spheres may be conceived to have been generated by the revolution of  two of the circles about the line joining their centers. During such  revolution, the lines tangent to the two circles describe a conical  surface. We have, therefore, three spheres and three conical surfaces.  Now the plane, which is tangent to the three spheres, is also  evidently tangent to the three conical surfaces; and therefore the  vertices of those conical surfaces are all in the tangent plane. Now  those vertices are the points (1), (2), (3). But the same points are  also in the plane passing through the centers of the three spheres,  which is the same with the plane of the paper on which the figure is  drawn. Those points, being in two planes at the same time, must  therefore be in the intersection of those planes, that is to say, in a  straight line.    (9) C.W.H. asks: Can dyeing or coloring be done in cold water? A. Many  of the coal tar colors may be used in this way: For animal  fibers--wool, silk, | etc.--the affinity of these colors is so great  that, in most instances, no mordants are necessary. The baths are  usually made slightly acid. With vegetable fibers, however, a fast dye  is not assured without mordanting. Some of the finer goods are  prepared by treating with steam coagulated albumen (animalizing),  gelatin, various tannates, tin salt, alum, and other metallic salts.  The following is, the usual method of treatment, except with goods  intended for very light shades: Pass the goods through a strong  decoction of sumac or other tannin solution for an hour, and  afterwards for an hour or two through a weak solution of stannate of  soda; wring out, dip into a dilute solution of sulphuric acid, and  rinse well in water. The goods are then ready to be passed through the  color bath, slightly acidulated. For different tints, these baths are  worked at different temperatures.    (10) F.W. says: I wish to lay the face tier of a brick wall in black  mortar. How can I make the coloring material and mix it? A. Some  prefer to use red mortar and afterwards pencil the joints with black.  Color the ordinary white mortar with Spanish brown for red mortar, and  with ivory black for black, by mixing in enough of the color in a  powdered state to give a good deep tone.    (11) H.A.S. asks: 1. How many prisms are required in a spectroscope to  detect mineral elements in presence of all the ash ingredients of  organic bodies? A. If we understand you, one 60 deg. prism will answer. 2.  What is the best and cheapest form of apparatus to heat such compounds  for examination? A. Mix the substance with a little pure hydrochloric  acid and glycerin, and introduce into the flame on a coil of platinum  wire.    1. Has soup prepared by dissolving meat bones in a Papin's digester  ever been known to produce ossification of any of the soft tissues? A.  We have never heard of such a result. 2. Has it ever been known to  produce a new crop of teeth in toothless persons? A. We have no data  as to such a fact.    I have seen a statement that May 19, 1780, was so dark a day that  candles were necessary everywhere; and I have heard that another  occurred about the year 1820. Has any scientific explanation ever been  given of this phenomenon? A. The darkness on the days you mention were  the result of solar eclipses. They occurred on days of unusual  cloudiness. Perhaps the darkest day in modern history was that caused  by the total solar eclipse in the year 1806.    (12) A.B. says: 1. I have built a boat 15 feet long and 4 feet 6  inches wide. How large a boiler and engine do I require to work her to  best advantage? She is 22 inches deep from top of rail to top of keel.  A. Cylinder, 21/2 x 3 inches; boiler, 20 inches in diameter and 3 feet  high. Propeller, 18 to 20 inches in diameter, and of 3 feet pitch. 2.  How fast ought she to run? A. Probable speed, 5 miles an hour in  smooth water.    (13) L.L. asks: 1. Does it make any difference in what position a  watch is in when running? A. For watches adjusted to temperature and  position, it does not make much difference. 2. When not being carried,  what position should it be left in? A. In the case of ordinary  watches, we imagine that the wear will be rather more uniform when  they are in a vertical position. 3. If a person sleeps in a cola room,  would a watch be better under his pillow than on a table or hung up in  the same room? A. It is best not to subject them to great changes of  temperature.    (14) W.G. says, in reply to C.W.W., who has an engine, of 2-5/8 inches  bore and 4 inches stroke, which runs slower with increase of pressure:  Having had much experience with small engines and boilers, I will  state that I have had the same difficulty when using an upright  tubular boiler, and discovered the following to be the cause: The  upper portions of the tube superheat the steam to such a degree as to  prevent lubrication on the valve and piston surface by condensation,  and thereby reduce the speed of engine. Even with increased pressure,  this effect will be more appreciable when the area and travel of slide  valve are in excess.    (15) J.M.T. asks: Is there friction between two bodies while at rest,  or only when one or both are in motion? A. Both when at rest and in  motion.    Why does a balloon rise in the air? A. See p. 64, vol. 32.    (16) S.J.S. asks: 1. How are augers twisted? A. By special machinery.  2. How are twist drills made, and are they single or double grooved?  A. They are double grooved or double twisted, and are cut out in a  milling machine.    Can weights, springs, or water from a tank be used to any advantage to  run a lathe? A. No.    How much do iron and brass, in rods or bands, expand in length when  heated to red heat? A. Iron about 1/8 inch per foot, brass 1/10 inch."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19420"],[0,"Bell's Cathedrals: The Cathedral Church of York (#20)"],[1,"ves. Above them is a passage running round the  whole chapter-house and passing behind the vaulting shafts and through  the masses of masonry between the windows. The vault is of wood, though  ribbed and painted to give it the appearance of stone. This vault is  arranged so that the ribs diverge from the vaulting shafts until they  reach the central octagon of the roof. At this point they converge to  the boss in the middle of the central octagon. This boss is modern. The  roof was restored in 1845. Before this time it was painted with figures  of kings and bishops, and the bosses were covered with silver. The  modern decoration of the roof is dull and trivial in design and  offensive in colour. During the same restoration many of the marble  shafts were replaced and the floor was paved with tiles, with a most  unfortunate effect. The east window has also been filled with very bad  modern glass. In fact, restorers have done their worst to the  chapter-house; but, luckily, their work is not irreparable. We may hope  that some day the glass, the tiles, and the paint on the roof will all  be removed. This chapter-house marks the farthest point reached in the  development of such buildings. It differs from the chapter-houses at  Lincoln, Salisbury, Westminster, and Wells in that it has no central  pillar, and this absence of a central pillar is supposed to be its  special glory. No doubt the pillar was an inconvenience when the chapter  met, and the architect was given a fine opportunity for the display of  his mechanical ingenuity when he decided to do without it. But there can  be no doubt that a central pillar or cluster of shafts such as is found  at Wells, would be more beautiful. And as the architect at York was  afraid to vault his chapter-house with stone, his mechanical ingenuity  was not put to so severe a test after all. And yet, though we may regret  the beautiful central pillar as we find it at Wells or Lincoln, there  are other respects in which this chapter-house surpasses all its rivals.  In size, in richness of decoration, in boldness of outline, and in  aerial lightness it is unequalled. Above all, it still contains six  windows of magnificent stained glass. Even now it seems to justify its  boastful inscription:        Ut Rosa flos florum, sic est Domus ista Domorum.    [Illustration: Chapter-House--Entrance and Sedilia.]    #The Choir# is separated from the rest of the church by a very elaborate  rood screen, which was built _circa_ 1475-1505, and is therefore the  latest part of the original building. It is a fine example of Gothic  work of the latest period, and though, the details are of course  inferior to those of thirteenth century work, and the parts are small  and rather crowded, the whole effect is one of great richness and  magnificence. This screen consists of a central doorway into the choir,  and of fifteen niches with rich canopies and bases, seven to the north,  and eight to the south, of the central doorway. The niches are filled  with statues of the Kings of England from William the Conqueror to Henry  VI. The statue of Henry VI. alone is modern. It has been said that the  original statue of this king was regarded with so much reverence as to  have aroused the anger of the iconoclasts of the Reformation. At any  rate, it was destroyed, and an image of James I. set in its place. This  has been happily removed in the present century, and a statue of Henry  VI., a fair work, by the hand of Michael Taylor, a local sculptor, has  been inserted. The original statues are unusually good for their period,  and it has been suggested that the details of their dress show some  consideration for historical correctness. The same consideration was not  given to the hair, for it has been pointed out that the Normans were  clean-shaven and wore short hair, whereas the statues of the Norman  kings have beards, moustaches, and long hair. The kings are dressed in  robes of state. The legs of Stephen alone are exposed. The hands of the  Conqueror are broken off. On the pedestals are the names of the kings,  with the length of their reigns. They begin on the north side. The  figures of angels above the canopies of the niches are made of plaster  designed by Bernasconi, who also restored other parts of the screen.    The central archway is unusually rich and delicate for the period in  which it was built. It is somewhat obtuse in form, and is surmounted by  an ogee pediment or outer moulding. On each side are four narrow shafts  with carved capitals, an unusual enrichment in this period. Between  those shafts are rosettes and rows of foliage. The bases, both of the  shafts, the pedestals, and the buttresses, are very long, as is usual in  late Perpendicular work. The arch itself has four divisions of  ornamented mouldings, with plain mouldings between them. The ogee  moulding is richly decorated with foliage, and terminates in a lofty  finial reaching to the top of the screen. Below this finial is an empty  niche with a kind of ball-flower ornament at the base. On each side of  this niche is an angel with a censer, with rich foliage below. The  interior of the screen under the central arch is vaulted with carved  bosses. The niches are divided from each other by buttresses decorated  at intervals with pinnacles. The pedestals are long, and richly  ornamented with tabernacle work. The greater part of the ornament of the  screen is massed in the canopies. These canopies are made up of three  inner arches, cusped, immediately above the heads of the kings, and five  outer arches, cusped and gabled, round them. Round these outer arches is  a mass of pinnacles, with three larger, richly-ornamented pinnacles, and  two smaller, above them. Above these are three small figures, apparently  playing on musical instruments, with other figures of the same size, one  on each side of the buttresses. These figures, in their turn, have above  them canopies of much the same character as those below. Above these  canopies is a row of panelling with the plaster angels of Bernasconi  above it, at the beginning of the cornice. The rest of the cornice is  made up of a row of sculptured ornament and a row of cusped arches  terminating in the \"Tudor flower\" ornament, alternating with rows of  plain moulding.    [Illustration: The Choir Screen.]    The chief fault of this screen is its heaviness, which the mass of  ornament is not bold enough in its parts to lighten. The central  entrance is not cleverly managed, and seems cut out of the screen, as if  to make a way into the choir at all costs. This screen should be  compared to the beautiful rood screen at Exeter, with its three bold  arches and its simple yet delicate decoration. After the fire in 1829 it  was proposed to remove it, and one is almost tempted to regret that it  was not removed. The nave at York would be enormously improved by a  closer connection with the choir. Under any circumstances the nave must  be somewhat cold and ineffective; it would be far less so if the eye  could pass with scarcely a break into the sumptuous choir. The naves of  English cathedrals are too apt to look like splendid museums rather than  places of worship, and this is peculiarly the case with the nave at  York. Doctor Milner has stated, though apparently without authority,  that this screen was taken from the Abbey Church of St. Mary, close to  the cathedral. It is difficult to understand how it could have fitted so  much narrower a building.    [Illustration: The Choir, looking East.]    [Illustration: Bay of Choir--Interior.]    The choir itself, with the retro-choir or Lady Chapel, is divided into  nine bays. It is considerably the largest and loftiest in England, being  over 100 feet high and 99 wide. The altar is three bays from the east  end, and one bay west of the altar are the eastern transepts. The choir  was begun at the east end in 1361, and finished in 1405. There are  differences between the earlier work east and the later work west of the  transepts, which will be pointed out, though the plan of both is the  same.    The plan, allowing for differences in detail caused by the change of  style, is very like that of the nave. It is, therefore, an interesting  example of a Perpendicular building carried out on the lines of an  earlier Decorated design. When the east end of the choir was begun  (1361) the Gothic style was fast reaching its fullest development in  England. The nave of Winchester, a contemporary building, is the finest  example of that development. There, as has been pointed out, the  vertical division made by the vaulting shafts and the mouldings on each  side of them becomes the most important feature in the design. The  window tracery is planned merely as a frame for glass, and not as a  design interesting in itself. Decoration supplied in earlier work by  carved foliage, deep and various mouldings, and elaborate tracery, gives  way to a system of lines emphasising construction as completely as  possible. The contrasts between masses of ornament and blank walls,  which play so great a part in earlier Gothic, disappear; and the only  contrast is between the orderly lines of the stone and the kaleidoscopic  decoration of the windows. Architecture loses much of its fancy and its  delicacy, but becomes more logical, more reasonable, and more organic.    In the choir of the minster this change is only half carried out. There  is a much greater emphasis of line than in the nave, and there is less  delicacy of detail; but the vaulting shafts are no more important, and  the window tracery still plays a considerable part in the design. Hence  the choir lacks that air of decision, that extreme lucidity, to be found  in the design of the nave at Winchester. If it were not for the choir  furniture, the stalls, the throne and pulpit, and the altar, this want  of decision in the design would be much more evident than it is. But the  builders of this choir are"]]]
