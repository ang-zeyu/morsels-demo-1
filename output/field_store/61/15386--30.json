The only thing anomalous or  distinctive about the cliff ruins, considered as an element of pueblo  architecture, is the character of site occupied. If this were dictated  by the defensive motive, it would seem reasonable to suppose that the  same motive would have some direct influence on the structures, yet  examples where it has affected the arrangement of rooms or ground plan  or the character of the masonry are exceedingly rare and generally  doubtful.    It is well to specify that in the preceding remarks the term cliff ruin  has been applied to small settlements, comprising generally less than  four rooms, sometimes only one or two, and usually located on high and  almost inaccessible sites. These are comprised in class IV of the  classification here followed. Regular villages located in the cliffs or  on top of the talus (class III) are a different matter. These have  nothing in common with the small ruins, except that sometimes there is a  similarity of site. Doubtless in some of these ruins the defensive  motive operated to a certain extent. In classes I and II, however, the  influence of the defensive motive, in so far as it affected the  character of site chosen, is conspicuous by its absence. As there is no  evidence that the cliff ruins of class IV were separate and distinct  from the other ruins, but the contrary, the defensive motive may be  assigned a very subordinate place among the causes which produced that  phase of pueblo architecture found in Canyon de Chelly.    An hypothesis as to the order in which sites of the various classes were  occupied can not be based on the present condition of the ruins. It is  more than likely that the older ruins served as quarries of building  material for succeeding structures erected near them, and probably some  of the cliff ruins themselves served in this way for the erection of  others, for there are many sites from which the building stone has been  almost entirely removed; yet there is no doubt that these sites were  formerly occupied. The Navaho also have contributed to the destruction.  Notwithstanding their horror of contact with the remains of the dead,  quite a number of buildings have been erected by these Indians with  material derived from adjacent ruins. It is evident that the gathering  of this material would be a much lighter task than to quarry and prepare  it, no matter how roughly the latter might be done.    In a study of some ruins in the valley of the Rio Verde, made a few  years ago, a suggestion was made of the order in which ruins of various  kinds succeeded one another--a sort of chronologic sequence, of which  the beginning in time could not be determined. Studies of the ruins and  inhabited villages of the old province of Tusayan (Moki) and Cibola  (Zuni), and a cursory examination of ruins on Gila river, show that they  all fall easily into the same general order, which is somewhat as  follows:    1. The earliest form of pueblo house is doubtful. As a rule, in most  localities the earliest forms are already well advanced. As it is now  known that the ancient pueblo region was not inhabited by a vast number  of people, but by a comparatively small number of little bands, each in  constant though slow movement, this condition is what we would expect to  find. It is probable that the earliest settlements consisted of single  houses or small clusters located in valleys convenient to areas of  cultivable land and on streams or near water.    2. The next step gives us villages, generally of small size, located on  the foothills of mesas and overlooking large areas of good land which  were doubtless under cultivation. This class comprises more examples  perhaps than any other, and many of them come well within the historic  period, such as six of the seven villages of Tusayan at the time of the  Spanish conquest in 1540, all of the Cibolan villages of the same date,  and some of the Rio Grande pueblos of that time.    3. In some localities, though not in all, the small villages were at a  later period moved to higher and more inaccessible sites. This change  has taken place in Tusayan within the historic period, and in fact was  not wholly completed even fifty years ago. The pueblo of Acoma was in  this stage at the time of the conquest, and has remained so to the  present day. As a rule each of the small villages preserved its  independence, but in some cases they combined together to occupy  together a high defensive site. Such combination is, however, unusual.    4. The final stage in the development of pueblo architecture is the  large, many-storied, or beehive village, located generally in the midst  of broad valleys, depending on its size and population for defense, and  usually adjacent to some stream. In this class of structure the  defensive motive, in so far as it affected the choosing of the site,  entirely disappears. The largest existing pueblo, Zuni, made this step  early in the eighteenth century; the next largest, Taos, was probably in  this stage in 1540, and has remained so since. In some cases ruins on  foothill sites (2) have merged directly into many-storied pueblos on  open sites (4), without passing through an intermediate stage.    There is another step in the process of development which is now being  taken by many pueblos, which, although an advance from the industrial  point of view, is to the student of architecture degeneration. This  consists of a return to single houses located in the valleys and on the  bottom lands wherever convenience to the fields under cultivation  required. This movement is hardly twenty years old, but is proceeding at  a steadily accelerating pace, and its ultimate result is the complete  destruction of pueblo architecture. Whatever we wish to know of this  phase of Indian culture must be learned now, for two generations hence  probably nothing will remain of it.    This hasty sketch will illustrate some of the difficulties that lie in  the way of a complete classification of the ruins of the pueblo country.  It is impossible to arrange them in chronologic sequence, because they  are the product of different tribes who at different times came under  the influence of analogous causes, and results were produced which are  similar in themselves but different in time. It is believed, however,  that the classification suggested exhibits a cultural sequence and  probably within each tribe a chronologic order.    In this classification no mention has been made of the cliff and cave  ruins. These structures belong partly to class III, villages on  defensive sites, and partly to a subclass which pertained to a certain  extent to all the others. In the early stages of pueblo architecture the  people lived directly on the laud they tilled. Later the villages were  located on low foothills overlooking the land, but in this stage some of  the villages had already attained considerable size and the lands  overlooked by them were not sufficient for their needs. As a consequence  some of the inhabitants had to work fields at a distance from the home  village, and as a matter of convenience small temporary shelters were  erected near by. In a still later stage, when the villages were removed  to higher and more easily defended sites, the number of farming shelters  must have largely increased, as suitable sites which also commanded  large areas of good land could not often be found. At a still later  stage, when the inhabitants of a number of small villages combined to  form one large one, this difficulty was increased still more, and it is  probable that in this stage the construction of outlying farming  settlements attained its maximum development. Often whole villages of  considerable size, sometimes many miles from the home pueblo, were  nothing more than farming shelters. These villages, like the single-room  shelters, were occupied only during the farming season; in the winter  the inhabitants abandoned them completely and retired to the home  village.    Some farming villages, such as those described above, are still in use  among the pueblos. The little village of Moen-Kapi, attached to Oraibi,  but 75 miles distant from it, is an example. There are also no fewer  than three villages in the Zuni country of the same class. Nutria,  Pescado, and Ojo Caliente are summer villages of the Zuni, although  distant from that pueblo from 15 to 25 miles. It is significant that  none of these subordinate villages possess a kiva. It is believed that  the cliff ruins and cavate lodges, which are merely variants of each  other due to geological conditions, were simply farming shelters of  another type, produced by a certain topographic environment.    The importance which it is believed should attach to the site on which a  ruin is found will be apparent from the above. It was certainly a  prominent element in the De Chelly group. A study of the detailed map  here published will illustrate how completely the necessity for  proximity to an area of cultivable land has dominated the location of  the settlements, large and small; and a visit to the place itself would  show how little influence the defensive motive has exercised. Near the  mouth of the canyon, where cultivable areas of land are not many, there  are few ruins, but those which do occur overlook such lands. In the  middle portion, where good lands are most abundant, ruins also are most  abundant; while above this, as the rocky talus develops more and more,  the ruins become fewer and fewer; and in the upper parts of the canyon,  beyond the area shown on the map, they are located at wide distances  apart, corresponding to little areas of good land so located. Not all of  the available land was utilized, and only a small percentage of the  available sites were built upon. Between the mouth of De Chelly and the  junction of Monument canyon, 13 miles above, there are seventy-one  ruins.

And you can quit thinking what you're thinking, I put my shirtcloak on  you because you were bare to the waist and it didn't look so good.\" I  stopped to think that over, and amended: \"I mean I couldn't haul you  around the streets that way. It looked good enough.\"    To my surprise, she gave a shaky little giggle, and held out her  fettered hands. \"Will you?\"    I broke her links and freed her. She rubbed her wrists as if they hurt  her, then drew up her draperies, pinned them so that she was decently  covered, and tossed back my shirtcloak. Her eyes were wide and soft in  the light of the flickering stub of candle.    \"O, Rakhal,\" she sighed. \"When I saw you there--\" She sat up, clasping  her hands hard together, and when she continued her voice was curiously  cold and controlled for anyone so childish. It was almost as cold as  Dallisa's.    \"If you've come from Kyral, I'm not going back. I'll never go back, and  you may as well know it.\"    \"I don't come from Kyral, and I don't care where you go. I don't care  what you do.\" I suddenly realized that the last statement was wholly  untrue, and to cover my confusion I shoved the remaining bowl of noodles  at her.    \"Eat.\"    She wrinkled her nose in fastidious disgust. \"I'm not hungry.\"    \"Eat it anyway. You're still half doped, and the food will clear your  head.\" I picked up one mug of the coffee and drained it at a single  swallow. \"What were you doing in that disgusting den?\"    Without warning she flung herself across the table at me, throwing her  arms round my neck. Startled, I let her cling a moment, then reached up  and firmly unfastened her hands.    \"None of that now. I fell for it once, and it landed me in the middle of  the mudpie.\"    But her fingers bit my shoulder.    \"Rakhal, Rakhal, I tried to get away and find you. Have you still got  the bird? You haven't set it off yet? Oh, don't, don't, don't, Rakhal,  you don't know what Evarin is, you don't know what he's doing.\" The  words spilled out of her like floodwaters. \"He's won so many of you,  don't let him have you too, Rakhal. They call you an honest man, you  worked once for Terra, the Terrans would believe you if you went to them  and told them what he--Rakhal, take me to the Terran Zone, take me  there, take me there where they'll protect me from Evarin.\"    At first I tried to stop her, question her, then waited and let the  torrent of entreaty run on and on. At last, exhausted and breathless,  she lay quietly against my shoulder, her head fallen forward. The musty  reek of _shallavan_ mingled with the flower scent of her hair.    \"Kid,\" I said heavily at last, \"you and your Toymaker have both got me  wrong. I'm not Rakhal Sensar.\"    \"You're not?\" She drew back, regarding me in dismay. Her eyes searched  every inch of me, from the gray streak across my forehead to the scar  running down into my collar. \"Then who--\"    \"Race Cargill. Terran Intelligence.\"    She stared, her mouth wide like a child's.    Then she laughed. She _laughed_! At first I thought she was hysterical.  I stared at her in consternation. Then, as her wide eyes met mine, with  all the mischief of the nonhuman which has mingled into the human here,  all the circular complexities of Wolf illogic behind the woman in them,  I started to laugh too.    I threw back my head and roared, until we were clinging together and  gasping with mirth like a pair of raving fools. The _chak_ waiter came  to the door and stared at us, and I roared \"Get the hell out,\" between  spasms of crazy laughter.    Then she was wiping her face, tears of mirth still dripping down her  cheeks, and I was frowning bleakly into the empty bowls.    \"Cargill,\" she said hesitantly, \"you can take me to the Terrans where  Rakhal--\"    \"Hell's bells,\" I exploded. \"I can't take you anywhere, girl. I've got  to find Rakhal--\" I stopped in midsentence and looked at her clearly for  the first time.    \"Child, I'll see that you're protected, if I can. But I'm afraid you've  walked from the trap to the cookpot. There isn't a house in Charin that  will hold me. I've been thrown out twice today.\"    She nodded. \"I don't know how the word spreads, but it happens, in  nonhuman parts. I think they can see trouble written in a human face, or  smell it on the wind.\" She fell silent, her face propped sleepily  between her hands, her hair falling in tangles. I took one of her hands  in mine and turned it over.    It was a fine hand, with birdlike bones and soft rose-tinted nails; but  the lines and hardened places around the knuckles reminded me that she,  too, came from the cold austerity of the salt Dry-towns. After a moment  she flushed and drew her hand from mine.    \"What are you thinking, Cargill?\" she asked, and for the first time I  heard her voice sobered, without the coquetry, which must after all have  been a very thin veneer.    I answered her simply and literally. \"I am thinking of Dallisa. I  thought you were very different, and yet, I see that you are very like  her.\"    I thought she would question what I knew of her sister, but she let it  pass in silence. After a time she said, \"Yes, we were twins.\" Then,  after a long silence, she added, \"But she was always much the older.\"    And that was all I ever knew of whatever obscure pressures had shaped  Dallisa into an austere and tragic Clytemnestra, and Miellyn into a  pixie runaway.    Outside the drawn shutters, dawn was brightening. Miellyn shivered,  drawing her thin draperies around her bare throat. I glanced at the  little rim of jewels that starred her hair and said, \"You'd better take  those off and hide them. They alone would be enough to have you hauled  into an alley and strangled, in this part of Charin.\" I hauled the bird  Toy from my pocket and slapped it on the greasy table, still wrapped in  its silk. \"I don't suppose you know which of us this thing is set to  kill?\"    \"I know nothing about the Toys.\"    \"You seem to know plenty about the Toymaker.\"    \"I thought so. Until last night.\" I looked at the rigid, clamped mouth  and thought that if she were really as soft and delicate as she looked,  she would have wept. Then she struck her small hand on the tabletop and  burst out, \"It's not a religion. It isn't even an honest movement for  freedom! Its a--a front for smuggling, and drugs, and--and every other  filthy thing!    \"Believe it or not, when I left Shainsa, I thought Nebran was the answer  to the way the Terrans were strangling us! Now I know there are worse  things on Wolf than the Terran Empire! I've heard of Rakhal Sensar, and  whatever you may think of Rakhal, he's too decent to be mixed up in  anything like this!\"    \"Suppose you tell me what's really going on,\" I suggested. She couldn't  add much to what I knew already, but the last fragments of the pattern  were beginning to settle into place. Rakhal, seeking the matter  transmitter and some key to the nonhuman sciences of Wolf--I knew now  what the city of Silent Ones had reminded me of!--had somehow crossed  the path of the Toymaker.    Evarin's words now made sense: \"_You were clever at evading our  surveillance--for a while._\" Possibly, though I'd never know, Cuinn had  been keeping one foot in each camp, working for Kyral and for Evarin.  The Toymaker, knowing of Rakhal's anti-Terran activities, had believed  he would make a valuable ally and had taken steps to secure his help.    Juli herself had given me the clue: \"_He smashed Rindy's Toys._\" Out of  the context it sounded like the work of a madman. Now, having  encountered Evarin's workshop, it made plain good sense.    And I think I had known all along that Rakhal could not have been  playing Evarin's game. He might have turned against Terra--though now I  was beginning even to doubt that--and certainly he'd have killed me if  he found me. But he would have done it himself, and without malice.  _Killed without malice_--that doesn't make sense in any of the  languages of Terra. But it made sense to me.    Miellyn had finished her brief recitation and was drowsing, her head  pillowed on the table. The reddish light was growing, and I realized  that I was waiting for dawn as, days ago, I had waited for sunset in  Shainsa, with every nerve stretched to the breaking point. It was dawn  of the third morning, and this bird lying on the table before me must  fly or, far away in the Kharsa, another would fly at Juli.    I said, \"There's some distance limitation on this one, I understand,  since I have to be fairly near its object. If I lock it in a steel box  and drop it in the desert, I'll guarantee it won't bother anybody. I  don't suppose you'd have a shot at stealing the other one for me?\"    She raised her head, eyes flashing. \"Why should you worry about Rakhal's  wife?\" she flared, and for no good reason it occurred to me that she was  jealous. \"I might have known Evarin wouldn't shoot in the dark! Rakhal's  wife, that Earthwoman, what do you care for her?\"    It seemed important to set her straight. I explained that Juli was my  sister, and saw a little of the tension fade from her face, but not all.  Remembering the custom of the Dry-towns, I was not wholly surprised when  she added, jealously, \"When I heard of your feud, I guessed it was over  that woman!\"    \"But not in the way you think,\" I said. Juli had been part of it,  certainly. Even then I had not wanted her to turn her back on her world,  but if Rakhal had remained with Terra, I would have accepted his  marriage to Juli. Accepted it. I'd have rejoiced. God knows we had been  closer than brothers, those years in the Dry-towns. And then, before  Miellyn's flashing eyes, I suddenly faced my secret hate, my secret  fear. No, the quarrel had not been all Rakhal's doing.    He had not turned his back, unexplained on Terra. In some unrecognized  fashion, I had done my best to drive him away. And when he had gone, I  had banished a part of myself as well, and thought I could end the  struggle by saying"]]]
