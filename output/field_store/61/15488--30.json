Some _crannogs_ appear to have been veritable islands, the only means  of communication with the land being canoes. Remains of these have been  frequently found near the dwelling, in some instances alongside the  landing stage, as if sunk at their moorings.    \"Favorite sites for _crannogs_ were marshes, small loughs surrounded  by woods and large sheets of water. As providing good fishing grounds  the entrance to or exit of a stream from a lake was eagerly  selected.\"--\"Lake Dwellings of Ireland,\" Col.

They slew Kian, the father of Luga of the Long Arms, who was grandson  of Balor of the Evil Eye. Luga imposed an extraordinary eric fine on  the sons of Turenn, part of which was \"the cooking-spit of the women of  Fincara.\" For a quarter of a year Brian and his brothers sailed hither  and thither over the wide ocean, landing on many shores, seeking tidings  of the Island of Fincara. At last they met a very old man, who told them  that the island lay deep down in the waters, having been sunk beneath  the waves by a spell in times long past.    Then Brian put on his water-dress, with his helmet of transparent  crystal on his head, telling his brothers to wait his return. He leaped  over the side of the ship, and sank at once out of sight. He walked about  for a fortnight down in the green salt sea, seeking for the Island of  Fincara, and at last he found it.    His brothers waited for him in the same spot the whole time, and when he  came not they began to fear he would return no more. At last they were  about to leave the place, when they saw the glitter of his crystal  helmet deep down in the water, and immediately after he came to the  surface with the cooking-spit in his hand.--\"Old Celtic Romances\"  (Joyce), p. 87.           *       *       *       *       *      IV    _Prince Cuglas_    In the list of the historic tales mentioned in the Book of Leinster,  and which is given in O'Curry's appendix to his \"Lectures on the MSS.

O'Curry has the following note:--    \"Cuglas was the son of Donn Desa, King of Leinster, and master of the  hounds to the monarch Conaire Mor. Having one day followed the chase  from Tara to this road, the chase suddenly disappeared in a cave,  into which he followed, and was _never seen after_. Hence the cave was  called _Uaimh Bealach Conglais_, or the cave of the road of Cuglas  (now Baltinglass, in the County of Wicklow). It is about this cave,  nevertheless, that so many of our pretended Irish antiquarians have  written so much nonsense in connection with some imaginary pagan worship  to which they gravely assure the world, on etymological authority,  the spot was devoted. The authority for the legend of Cuglas is the  _Dinnoean Chus_ on the place _Bealach Conglais_ (Book of Lecain).

They were analogous in many ways to the  Olympian and other celebrated games of ancient Greece.    \"These assemblies were regulated by a strict by-law, a breach of which  was punishable by death.

On a certain occasion the Dedanns, returning from a hurling match  with the Feni, passed through the forest, carrying with them for  food during the journey crimson nuts, and arbutus apples, and scarlet  quicken-berries, which they had brought from the Land of Promise. One  of the quicken-berries dropped on the earth, and the Dedanns passed  on not heeding.    From this berry a great quicken-tree sprang up, which had the virtues of  the quicken-trees that grow in fairyland. Its berries had the taste of  honey, and those who ate of them felt a cheerful glow, as if they had  drunk of wine or old mead, and if a man were even a hundred years old he  returned to the age of thirty as soon as he had eaten three of them.    The Dedanns having heard of this tree, and not wishing that anyone  should eat of the berries but themselves, sent a giant of their own  people to guard it, namely, Sharvan the Surly of Lochlann.--\"The  Pursuit of Diarmuid and Grania,\" \"Old Celtic Romances,\" p. 313 (Joyce).           *       *       *       *       *      XI    _The Palace of the Little Cat_    The description of the rows of jewels ranged round the wall of the  palace of the Little Cat is taken from \"The Voyage of Maildun.\"--See  Note XII.           *       *       *       *       *      XII    _The Birds of the Mystic Lake_    The incident of the birds coming to the mystic lake is taken from  \"The Voyage of Maildun,\" a translation of which is given in Joyce's  \"Old Celtic Romances.\" The operations of the birds were witnessed by  Maildun and his companions, who, in the course of their wanderings, had  arrived at the Isle of the Mystic Lake. One of Maildun's companions,  Diuran, on seeing the wonder, said to the others: \"Let us bathe in the  lake, and we shall obtain a renewal of our youth like the birds.\"    But they said: \"Not so, for the bird has left the poison of his old age  and decay in the water.\"    _Diuran_, however, plunged in, and swam about for some time; after which  he took a little of the water and mixed it in his mouth, and in the end  he swallowed a small quantity. He then came out perfectly sound and  whole, and remained so ever after as long as he lived. But none of the  others ventured in.    The return of the birds in the character of the cormorants of the  western seas and guardians of the lake does not occur in the old tale.  The oldest copy of the voyage is in the \"Book of the Dun Cow\" (about the  year 1100). O'Curry says the voyage was undertaken about the year 700.  It was made by Maildun in search of pirates who had slain his father.

The water was red with their  blood, and mottled with standards and drums and floating robes. Of  prisoners, the Christians spared but two, and these they delivered  over to the mob to be torn in pieces.    After the assault by water came the attack by mines; but the result  was no better, for the Knights were no novices in the art of  countermining, and the attempt to push on after the explosion ended in  rushing into a trap. Mustafa, however, continued to work underground  and ply his heavy artillery, with hardly a pause, upon the two  extremities of the line of landward defences--the Bastion of De  Robles, and the Bastion of Castile: both were in ruins by the 27th of  July, as S[=a]lih Reis, son of Barbarossa's old comrade, satisfied  himself by a reconnaissance pushed into the very breach. An assault  was ordered for midday of August 2nd, when the Christians were resting  after the toils of the sultry morning. Six thousand Turks advanced in  absolute silence to Melchior de Robles' bastion; they had almost  reached their goal when the shout of the sentry brought that gallant  Knight, readily awakened, to the breach, followed by Munatones and  three Spanish arquebusiers. These five warriors held twenty-six  Janissaries and Sip[=a]his in check till reinforcements came; and they  killed fifteen of them. Their valour saved the fort. Four hours longer  the struggle lasted, till neither party could deal another blow in the  raging August sun; and the Turks at last retired with a loss of six  hundred dead.    Nothing daunted, the 7th of August saw them once more scaling the  walls and rushing the breaches of the two bastions, this time with  nearly twenty thousand men. They poured over the ravelin, swarmed up  the breach, and were on the point of carrying the fort. All was nearly  lost, and at that supreme moment even the aged Grand Master, whose  place was to direct, not to imperil his life, came down to the front  of battle, and used his sword and pike like a common soldier. Eight  long hours they fought, six times came fresh reserves to the support  of the Turks; the Christians were exhausted, and had no reserves. One  rush more and the place would be carried.    Just then a body of cavalry was seen riding down from the direction of  the Old Town. The Turks took them to be the long-expected  reinforcements from Sicily. They are seen to fall upon stray parties  of Turks; they must be the advance guard of Philip's army. Pi[=a]li in  alarm runs to his galleys; the Turks who had all but carried the  long-contested bastion pause in affright lest they be taken in rear.  In vain Mustafa, in vain the King of Algiers shows them that the  horsemen are but two hundred of the Old Town garrison, with no army at  all behind them. Panic, unreasoning and fatal as ever, seizes upon the  troops: the foothold won after eight hours of furious fighting is  surrendered to a scare; not a Turk stays to finish the victory. The  lives of their two thousand dead need not have been sacrificed.    Still Mustafa did not despair. He knew that the main defences of the  bastions had been destroyed--a few days more, a heavy cannonade, the  explosion of a series of mines which thousands of his sappers were  preparing would, he was certain, ensure the success of a final  assault. The day came, August 20th, and Mustafa himself, in his coat  of inlaid mail and robe of cramoisy, led his army forward; but a  well-directed fire drove him into a trench, whence he emerged not  till night covered his path. When at last he got back, he found his  army in camp; another assault had been repulsed. The next day they  went up again to the fatal embrasures, and this time the failure was  even more signal; repeated repulses were telling on the spirits of the  men, and the veteran Janissaries went to their work with unaccustomed  reluctance. Nevertheless, the trenches, cut in the hard rock,  continued to advance slowly, and the cavalier behind the ravelin was  taken after a severe struggle:--just taken, when La Valette's mines  blew the victorious assailants into the air. On the 30th another  well-planned assault was repelled. One more effort--a last and  desperate attempt--was to be made on the 7th of September; but on the  5th the news arrived that the Spanish army of relief had at length,  after inconceivable delays and hesitations, actually landed on the  island. The worn-out Turks did not wait to reconnoitre, they had borne  enough: a retreat was ordered, the siege was abandoned, the works that  had cost so much labour and blood were deserted, and there was a  general stampede to the galleys. It is true they landed again when  they learnt that the relieving army numbered but six thousand men; but  their strength was departed from them. They tried to fight the  relieving army, and then again they ran for the ships. The Spaniards  cut them down like sheep, and of all that gallant armament scarce five  thousand lived to tell the tale of those terrible three months in  Malta.    No more moving sight can be imagined than the meeting of the new-come  Brethren of the Order and their comrades of St. Michael's Fort. The  worn remnant of the garrison, all told, was scarcely six hundred  strong, and hardly a man was without a wound. The Grand Master and his  few surviving Knights looked like phantoms from another world, so pale  and grisly were they, faint from their wounds, their hair and beard  unkempt, their armour stained, and neglected, as men must look who had  hardly slept without their weapons for more than three memorable  months. As they saw these gaunt heroes the rescuers burst into tears;  strangers clasped hands and wept together with the same overpowering  emotion that mastered relievers and relieved when Havelock and Colin  Campbell led the Highlanders into Lucknow. Never surely had men  deserved more nobly the homage of mankind. In all history there is no  record of such a siege, of such a disproportion in the forces, of such  a glorious outcome. The Knights of Malta live for ever among the  heroes of all time.

The failure of the siege of Malta was a sensible rebuff, yet it cannot  be said that it seriously injured the renown of the Turks in the  Mediterranean. They had been resisted on land; they had not yet been  beaten at sea. Nor could they look back on the terrible months of the  siege without some compensating feeling of consolation. They had taken  St. Elmo, and its fall had aroused general jubilation in every Moslem  breast; the Moors of Granada went near to rising against the Spaniards  on the mere report of this triumph of the Turkish arms. Though they  had failed to reduce St. Michael, the cause was to be found, at least  in part, in a false alarm and an unreasoning panic. To be defeated by  such warriors as the Knights of St. John was not a disgrace; like the  Highlanders in the Crimean War, these men were not so much soldiers,  in their opponents' eyes, as veritable devils; and who shall contend  against the legions of the Jinn? Moreover, forced as they were to  abandon the siege, had they not left the island a desert, its people  reduced by half, its fortifications heaps of rubbish, its brave  defenders a handful of invalids?    So reasoned the Turks, and prepared for another campaign. They had  lost many men, but more were ready to take their place; their immense  fleet was uninjured; and though Dragut was no more, Ochiali--as the  Christians called 'Ali _El-Ul[=u]ji_ \"the Renegade\"--the Turks dubbed  him _Fart[=a]s_, \"Scurvied,\" from his complaint--was following  successfully in his old master's steps. Born at Castelli (Licastoli)  in Calabria about 1508,[46] Ochiali was to have been a priest, but his  capture by the Turks turned him to the more exciting career of a  Corsair. Soon after the siege of Malta he succeeded Barbarossa's son  Hasan as pasha or Beglerbeg of Algiers (1568), and one of his first  acts was to retake Tunis (all but the Goletta) in the name of Sultan  Sel[=i]m II., who, to the unspeakable loss of the Mohammedan world,  had in 1566 succeeded his great father Suleym[=a]n. In July, 1570, off  Alicata, on the southern coast of Sicily, Ochiali surrounded four  galleys of \"the Religion\"--they then possessed but five--and took  three of them, including the flagship, which Saint-Clement, the  general of the galleys, abandoned in order to throw himself and his  treasure on shore at Montichiaro. One galley alone, the _St. Ann_,  made a desperate resistance; the others surrendered. Sixty Knights or  Serving Brothers of the Order were killed or made prisoners on this  disastrous day, and so intense was the indignation in Malta, that the  Grand Master had much ado to save Saint-Clement from being lynched by  the mob, and was obliged to deliver him up to the secular court, which  at once condemned him to death. He was strangled in his cell, and his  body thrown in a sack into the sea. Such a success went far to atone  for Mustafa Pasha's unfortunate siege.    A far more important triumph awaited the Turks in 1570-1:--a siege,  and a conquest. The new Sultan, like his father, saw in the island of  Cyprus a standing affront to his authority in the Levant. Then, as  now, Cyprus was a vital centre in all maritime wars in the Eastern  Mediterranean; a convenient depot for troops and stores; a watch-tower  whence the movements of the Turkish "]]]
