And this is what in his own mind he intended. But to do it  effectively, it was clearly best to tell his hearers, in so many words,  whom he really wished them to strike. That would have relieved the  majority, and banished the suspicion which had been busily fomented by  his enemies, that he had in his pocket a long list of their names, for  proscription. But Robespierre, having for the first time in his life  ventured on aggressive action without the support of a definite party,  faltered. He dared not to designate his enemies face to face and by  name. Instead of that, he talked vaguely of conspirators against the  republic, and calumniators of himself. There was not a single bold,  definite, unmistakable sentence in the speech from first to last. The  men of the Plain were insecure and doubtful; they had no certainty that  among conspirators and calumniators he did not include too many of  themselves. People are not so readily seized by grand phrases, when  their heads are at stake. The sitting was long, and marked by changing  currents and reverses. When they broke up, all was left uncertain.  Robespierre had suffered a check. Billaud felt that he could no longer  hesitate in joining the combination against his colleague. Each party  was aware that the next day must seal the fate of one or other of them.  There is a legend that in the evening Robespierre walked in the Champs  Elysees with his betrothed, accompanied as usual by his faithful dog,  Brount. They admired the purple of the sunset, and talked of the  prospect of a glorious to-morrow. But this is apocryphal. The evening  was passed in no lover's saunterings, but amid the storm and uproar of  the Club. He went to the Jacobins to read over again his speech of the  day. 'It is my testament of death,' he said, amid the passionate  protestations of his devoted followers. He had been talking for the last  three years of his willingness to drink the hemlock, and to offer his  breast to the poniards of tyrants. That was a fashion of the speech of  the time, and in earlier days it had been more than a fashion of speech,  for Brunswick would have given them short shrift. But now, when he  talked of his last testament, Robespierre did not intend it to be so if  he could prevent it. When he went to rest that night, he had a tolerably  calm hope that he should win the next day's battle in the Convention,  when he was aware that Saint Just would attack the Committees openly and  directly. If he would have allowed his band to invade the Pavillon de  Flore, and carry off or slay the Committees who sat up through the  night, the battle would have been won when he awoke. His friends are  justified in saying that his strong respect for legality was the cause  of his ruin.    Men in all ages have had a superstitious fondness for connecting awful  events in their lives with portents and signs among the outer elements.  It was noticed that the heat during the terrible days of Thermidor was  more intense than had been known within the memory of man. The  thermometer never fell below sixty-five degrees in the coolest part of  the night, and in the daytime men and women and beasts of burden fell  down dead in the streets. By five o'clock in the morning of the Ninth  Thermidor, the galleries of the Convention were filled by a boisterous  and excited throng. At ten o'clock the proceedings began as usual with  the reading of correspondence from the departments and from the armies.  Robespierre, who had been escorted from his lodgings by the usual body  of admirers, instead of taking his ordinary seat, remained standing by  the side of the tribune. It is a familiar fact that moments of appalling  suspense are precisely those in which we are most ready involuntarily to  note a trifle; everybody observed that Robespierre wore the coat of  violet-blue silk and the white nankeens in which a few weeks previously  he had done honour to the Supreme Being.    The galleries seemed as enthusiastic as ever. The men of the Plain and  the Marsh had lost the abject mien with which they usually cowered  before Robespierre's glance; they wore a courageous air of judicial  reserve. The leaders of the Mountain wandered restlessly to and fro  among the corridors. At noon Tallien saw that Saint Just had ascended  the tribune. Instantly he rushed down into the chamber, knowing that  the battle had now begun in fierce earnest. Saint Just had not got  through two sentences, before Tallien interrupted him. He began to  insist with energy that there should be an end to the equivocal phrases  with which Paris had been too long alarmed by the Triumvirate. Billaud,  fearing to be outdone in the attack, hastily forced his way to the  tribune, broke into what Tallien was saying, and proceeded dexterously  to discredit Robespierre's allies without at once assailing Robespierre  himself. Le Bas ran in a fury to stop him; Collot d'Herbois, the  president, declared Le Bas out of order; the hall rang with cries of 'To  prison! To the Abbey!' and Le Bas was driven from the tribune. This was  the beginning of the tempest. Robespierre's enemies knew that they were  fighting for their lives, and this inspired them with a strong and  resolute power that is always impressive in popular assemblies. He still  thought himself secure. Billaud pursued his accusations. Robespierre, at  last, unable to control himself, scaled the tribune. There suddenly  burst forth from Tallien and his partisans vehement shouts of 'Down with  the tyrant! down with the tyrant!' The galleries were swept by a wild  frenzy of vague agitation; the president's bell poured loud incessant  clanging into the tumult; the men of the Plain held themselves firm and  silent; in the tribune raged ferocious groups, Tallien menacing  Robespierre with a dagger, Billaud roaring out proposals to arrest this  person and that Robespierre gesticulating, threatening, yelling,  shrieking. His enemies knew that if he were once allowed to get a  hearing, his authority might even yet overawe the waverers. A  penetrative word or a heroic gesture might lose them the day. The  majority of the chamber still hesitated. They called for Barere, in  whose adroit faculty for discovering the winning side they had the  confidence of long experience. Robespierre, recovering some of his calm,  and perceiving now that he had really to deal with a serious revolt,  again asked to be heard before Barere. But the cries for Barere were  louder than ever. Barere spoke, in a sense hostile to Robespierre, but  warily and without naming him.    Then there was a momentary lull. The Plain was uncertain. The battle  might even now turn either way. Robespierre made another attempt to  speak, but Tallien with intrepid fury broke out into a torrent of louder  and more vehement invective. Robespierre's shrill voice was heard in  disjected snatches, amidst the violent tones of Tallien, the yells of  the president calling Robespierre to order, the murderous clanging of  the bell. Then came that supreme hour of the struggle, whose tale has  been so often told, when Robespierre turned from his old allies of the  Mountain, and succeeded in shrieking out an appeal to the probity and  virtue of the Right and the Plain. To his horror, even these despised  men, after a slight movement, remained mute. Then his cheeks blanched,  and the sweat ran down his face. But anger and scornful impatience  swiftly came back and restored him. _President of assassins_, he cried  out to Thuriot, _for the last time I ask to be heard. Thou canst not  speak_, called one, _the blood of Danton chokes thee_. He flung himself  down the steps of the tribune, and rushed towards the benches of the  Right. _Come no further_, cried another, _Vergniaud and Condorcet sat  here_. He regained the tribune, but his speech was gone. He was reduced  to the dregs of an impotent and gasping voiceless gesticulation, like  the strife of one in a nightmare.    The day was lost. The tension of a passionate and violent struggle  prolonged for many hours always at length exasperates onlookers with  something of the brute ferocity of the actors. The physical strain stirs  the tiger in the blood; they conceive a cruel hatred against weakness,  just as the heated throng of a Roman amphitheatre turned up their thumbs  for the instant despatch of the unfortunate swordsman who had been too  ready to lower his arms. The Right, the Plain, even the galleries,  despised the man who had succumbed. If Robespierre had possessed the  physical strength of Mirabeau or Danton, the Ninth Thermidor would have  been another of his victories. He was crushed by the relentless ferocity  and endurance of his antagonists. A decree for his arrest was resolved  upon by acclamation. He cast a glance at the galleries, as marvelling  that they should remain passive in face of an outrage on his person.  They were mute. The ushers advanced with hesitation to do their duty,  and not without trembling carried him away, along with Couthon and  Saint Just. The brother, for whom he had made honourable sacrifices in  days that seemed to be divided from the present by an abyss of  centuries, insisted with fine heroism on sharing his fate, and Augustin  Robespierre and Le Bas were led off to the prisons along with their  leader and idol.    It was now a little after four o'clock. The Convention, with the  self-possession that so often amazes us in its proceedings, went on with  formal business for another hour. At five they broke up. For life, as  the poets tell, is a daily stage-play; men declaim their high heroic  parts, then doff the buskin or the sock, wash away the paint from their  cheeks, and gravely sit down to meat. The Conventionals, as they ate  their dinners, were unconscious, apparently, that the great crisis of  the drama was still to come. The next twelve hours were to witness the  climax. Robespierre had"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20748"],[0,"Favorite Fairy Tales (#20)"],[1,"a present to the King of Serindib. I ventured to protest on account of  my age, but I could not persuade him to give up his plan. I arrived at  Serindib, and prayed an audience with the King. I was conducted to the  palace with great respect, and delivered to the monarch the Caliph's  letter and present. The present consisted of the most ingenious and  valuable works of art, with which the King was exceedingly delighted,  and he was also pleased to acknowledge how much he esteemed my services.  When I departed, the monarch bestowed on me some rich gifts; but the  ship had not long been at sea, before it was attacked by pirates, who  seized the vessel, and carried us away as slaves. I was sold to a  merchant. When my master found that I could use the bow and arrow with  skill, he took me upon an elephant, and carried me to a vast forest in  the country. My master ordered me to climb a high tree, and wait there  until I saw a troop of elephants pass by. I was then to shoot at them,  and if one of them fell, I was to go to the city and give the merchant  notice. Having given me these directions, and a bag of provisions, he  left me. On the morning of the second day, I saw a great number of  elephants. I succeeded in shooting one of them, upon which the others  went away, and I returned to the city and told my employer, who praised  my work. We went back to the forest and dug a hole, in which the  elephant was to remain until it decayed and left the teeth free. I  continued this trade nearly two months, and killed an elephant almost  every day. One morning all the elephants came up to the tree in which I  was and trumpeted dreadfully. One of them fastened his trunk round the  tree and tore it up by the roots. I fell with the tree; the animal took  me up with his trunk, and placed me on his back, and then, at the head  of his troop, he brought me to a place where he gently laid me on the  ground, and they all went away. I discovered that I was upon a large  broad hill, covered all over with the bones and teeth of elephants, and  was soon convinced that this was their burying-place. I reached the city  once more; my master thought I was lost, for he had seen the torn tree,  and found my bow and arrows. I told him what had happened, and led him  to the hill. We loaded the elephant on which we had come, and thus  collected more teeth than a man could have obtained in his whole life.  The merchant told me that not only he himself, but the whole city, was  indebted to me, and that I should return to my own country with  sufficient wealth to make me happy. My patron loaded a ship with ivory,  and the other merchants made me valuable presents. I reached Balsora  and landed my ivory, which I found to be more valuable than I had  expected. I set out with caravans to travel overland, and at last  reached Bagdad, where I presented myself to the Caliph, and gave an  account of my embassy. He was so astonished at my adventure with the  elephants that he ordered the narrative of it to be written in letters  of gold and to be deposited in his treasury.    [Illustration]          HANSEL AND GRETEL    [Illustration]      Once upon a time there dwelt near a large wood a poor wood-cutter, with  his wife and two children by his former marriage, a little boy called  Hansel and a girl named Gretel. He had little enough to eat; and once,  when there was a great famine in the land, he could not get even his  daily bread. As he lay thinking in his bed one evening, rolling about  for trouble, he sighed, and said to his wife, \"What will become of us?  How can we feed our children, when we have no more than we can eat  ourselves?\"    \"Well, then, my husband,\" answered she, \"we will lead them away, quite  early in the morning, into the thickest part of the wood, and there make  them a fire, and give them each a little piece of bread. Then we will go  to our work and leave them alone, so they will not find the way home  again, and we shall be freed from them.\"    \"No, wife,\" replied he; \"that I can never do. How can you bring your  heart to leave my children all alone in the wood; for the wild beasts  will soon come and tear them to pieces?\"    \"Oh, you simpleton!\" said she. \"Then we must all four die of hunger.\"    But she gave him no peace until he consented, saying, \"Ah, but I shall  regret the poor children.\"    The two children, however, had not gone to sleep for very hunger, and so  they overheard what the stepmother said to their father. Gretel wept  bitterly, and said to Hansel, \"What will become of us?\"    [Illustration]    \"Be quiet, Gretel,\" said he. \"Do not cry--I will soon help you.\" And as  soon as their parents had fallen asleep he got up, put on his coat,  and, unbarring the back door, slipped out. The moon shone brightly, and  the white pebbles which lay before the door seemed like silver pieces,  they glittered so brightly. Hansel stooped down, and put as many into  his pocket as it would hold; and then, going back, he said to Gretel,  \"Be comforted, dear sister, and sleep in peace; God will not forsake  us.\" And so saying, he went to bed again.    The next morning, before the sun arose, the wife went and awoke the two  children. \"Get up, you lazy things; we are going into the forest to chop  wood.\" Then she gave them each a piece of bread, saying, \"There is  something for your dinner; do not eat it before the time, for you will  get nothing else.\"    Gretel took the bread in her apron, for Hansel's pocket was full of  pebbles; and so they all set out upon their way. When they had gone a  little distance, Hansel stood still, and peeped back at the house; and  this he repeated several times, till his father said, \"Hansel, what are  you peeping at, and why do you lag behind? Take care, and remember  your legs.\"    [Illustration]    \"Ah, father,\" said Hansel, \"I am looking at my white cat sitting upon  the roof of the house, and trying to say good-bye.\"    \"You simpleton!\" said the wife, \"that is not a cat; it is only the sun  shining on the white chimney.\"    But in reality Hansel was not looking at a cat; but every time he  stopped he dropped a pebble out of his pocket upon the path.    [Illustration]    When they came to the middle of the wood the father told the children to  collect wood, and he would make them a fire, so that they should not be  cold. So Hansel and Gretel gathered together quite a little mountain of  twigs. Then they set fire to them; and as the flame burnt up high, the  wife said, \"Now, you children, lie down near the fire, and rest  yourselves, while we go into the forest and chop wood. When we are  ready I will come and call you.\"    Hansel and Gretel sat down by the fire, and when it was noon each ate  the piece of bread; and because they could hear the blows of an axe,  they thought their father was near; but it was not an axe, but a branch  which he had bound to a withered tree, so as to be blown to and fro by  the wind.    They waited so long, that at last their eyes closed from weariness, and  they fell fast asleep. When they awoke it was quite dark, and Gretel  began to cry, \"How shall we get out of the wood?\" But Hansel tried to  comfort her, saying, \"Wait a little while till the moon rises, and then  we will quickly find the way.\"    The moon soon shone forth, and Hansel, taking his sister's hand,  followed the pebbles, which glittered like new-coined silver pieces, and  showed them the path. All night long they walked on, and as day broke  they came to their father's house. They knocked at the door, and when  the wife opened it and saw Hansel and Gretel, she exclaimed, \"You wicked  children! why did you sleep so long in the wood? We thought you were  never coming home again.\" But their father was very glad, for it had  grieved his heart to leave them all alone.    Not long afterwards there was again great scarcity in every corner of  the land; and one night the children overheard their mother saying to  their father, \"Everything is again eaten. We have only half a loaf left,  and then we must starve. The children must be sent away. We will take  them deeper into the wood, so that they may not find the way out again;  it is the only means of escape for us.\"    But her husband felt heavy at heart, and thought. \"It were better to  share the last crust with the children.\" His wife, however, would listen  to nothing that he said, and scolded and reproached him without end.    Now the children had heard what had been said as they lay awake, and as  soon as the old people went to sleep Hansel got up, intending to pick up  some pebbles as before; but the wife had locked the door, so that he  could not get out. Nevertheless he comforted Gretel, saying, \"Do not  cry; sleep in peace; the good God will not forsake us.\"    Early in the morning the stepmother came and pulled them out of bed, and  gave them each a slice of bread, which was still smaller than the one  they had last time. On the way Hansel broke his in his pocket, and,  stooping every now and then, dropped a crumb upon the path.    \"Hansel, why do you stop and look about?\" said the father. \"Keep in the  path.\"    \"I am looking at my little dove,\" answered Hansel, \"nodding a good-bye  to me.\"    \"Simpleton!\" said the wife, \"that is no dove, but only the sun shining  on the chimney.\"    But Hansel kept still dropping crumbs as he went along.    The mother led the children deep into the wood, where they had never  been before, and there, making an immense fire, she said to them, \"Sit  down here and rest, and when you feel tired you can sleep for a little  while. We are going into the forest to hew wood, and in the evening,  when we are ready, we will come and fetch you.\"    When noon came Gretel shared her bread with Hansel, who had strewn his  on the path. They then went to sleep; but the evening arrived and no one  came to visit the poor children, and in the dark night they awoke, and  Hansel comforted his sister by saying, \"Only wait, Gretel,"]]]
