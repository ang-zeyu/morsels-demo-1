The minority, incapable of aggression,      is, of necessity, always on the defensive, and often the victim      of the desertion of its followers and the faithlessness of its      allies. It therefore must maintain, not destroy, barriers.        \"I do not know that I fully appreciate the purpose of my friend      from Missouri; whether, when he spoke of establishing military      posts along the borders of the States, and arming the Federal      Government with adequate physical power to enforce      constitutional rights (I suppose he meant obligations), he meant      to confer upon this Federal Government a power which it does not      now possess to coerce a State. If he did, then, in the language      of Mr. Madison, he is providing, not for a union of States, but      for the destruction of States; he is providing, under the name      of Union, to carry on a war against States; and I care not      whether it be against Massachusetts or Missouri, it is equally      objectionable to me; and I will resist it alike in the one case      and in the other, as subversive of the great principle on which      our Government rests; as a heresy to be confronted at its first      presentation, and put down there, lest it grow into proportions      which will render us powerless before it.        \"The theory of our Constitution, Mr. President, is one of peace,      of equality of sovereign States. It was made by States and made      for States; and for greater assurance they passed an amendment,      doing that which was necessarily implied by the nature of the      instrument, as it was a mere instrument of grants. But, in the      abundance of caution, they declared that everything which had      not been delegated was reserved to the States, or to the      people--that is, to the State governments as instituted by the      people of each State, or to the people in their sovereign      capacity.        \"I need not, then, go on to argue from the history and nature of      our Government that no power of coercion exists in it. It is      enough for me to demand the clause of the Constitution which      confers the power. If it is not there, the Government does not      possess it. That is the plain construction of the      Constitution--made plainer, if possible, by its amendment.        \"This Union is dear to me as a Union of fraternal States. It      would lose its value if I had to regard it as a Union held      together by physical force. I would be happy to know that every      State now felt that fraternity which made this Union possible;      and, if that evidence could go out, if evidence satisfactory to      the people of the South could be given that that feeling existed      in the hearts of the Northern people, you might burn your      statute-books and we would cling to the Union still. But it is      because of their conviction that hostility, and not fraternity,      now exists in the hearts of the people, that they are looking to      their reserved rights and to their independent powers for their      own protection. If there be any good, then, which we can do, it      is by sending evidence to them of that which I fear does not      exist--the purpose of your constituents to fulfill in the spirit      of justice and fraternity all their constitutional obligations.      If you can submit to them that evidence, I feel confidence that,      with the assurance that aggression is henceforth to cease, will      terminate all the measures for defense. Upon you of the majority      section it depends to restore peace and perpetuate the Union of      equal States; upon us of the minority section rests the duty to      maintain our equality and community rights; and the means in one      case or the other must be such as each can control.\"    The resolution of Mr. Powell was eventually adopted on the 18th of  December, and on the 20th the Committee was appointed, consisting of  Messrs. Powell and Crittenden, of Kentucky; Hunter, of Virginia; Toombs,  of Georgia; Davis, of Mississippi; Douglas, of Illinois; Bigler, of  Pennsylvania; Rice, of Minnesota; Collamer, of Vermont; Seward, of New  York; Wade, of Ohio; Doolittle, of Wisconsin; and Grimes, of Iowa. The  first five of the list, as here enumerated, were Southern men; the next  three were Northern Democrats, or Conservatives; the last five, Northern  \"Republicans,\" so called.    The supposition was that any measure agreed upon by the representatives  of the three principal divisions of public opinion would be approved by  the Senate and afterward ratified by the House of Representatives. The  Committee therefore determined that a majority of each of its three  divisions should be required in order to the adoption of any proposition  presented. The Southern members declared their readiness to accept any  terms that would secure the honor of the Southern States and guarantee  their future safety. The Northern Democrats and Mr. Crittenden generally  cooeperated with the State-Rights Democrats of the South; but the  so-called \"Republican\" Senators of the North rejected every proposition  which it was hoped might satisfy the Southern people, and check the  progress of the secession movement. After fruitless efforts, continued  for some ten days, the Committee determined to report the journal of  their proceedings, and announce their inability to attain any  satisfactory conclusion. This report was made on the 31st of  December--the last day of that memorable and fateful year, 1860.    Subsequently, on the floor of the Senate, Mr. Douglas, who had been a  member of the Committee, called upon the opposite side to state what  they were willing to do. He referred to the fact that they had rejected  every proposition that promised pacification; stated that Toombs, of  Georgia, and Davis, of Mississippi, as members of the Committee, had  been willing to renew the Missouri Compromise, as a measure of  conciliation, but had met no responsive willingness on the part of their  associates of the opposition; and he pressed the point that, as they had  rejected every overture made by the friends of peace, it was now  incumbent upon _them_ to make a positive and affirmative declaration of  their purposes.    Mr. Seward, of New York, as we have seen, was a member of that  Committee--the man who, in 1858, had announced the \"irrepressible  conflict,\" and who, in the same year, speaking of and for abolitionism,  had said: \"It has driven you back in California and in Kansas; it will  invade your soil.\" He was to be the Secretary of State in the incoming  Administration, and was very generally regarded as the \"power behind the  throne,\" greater than the throne itself. He was present in the Senate,  but made no response to Mr. Douglas's demand for a declaration of  policy.    Meantime the efforts for an adjustment made in the House of  Representatives had been equally fruitless. Conspicuous among these  efforts had been the appointment of a committee of thirty-three  members--one from each State of the Union--charged with a duty similar  to that imposed upon the Committee of Thirteen in the Senate, but they  had been alike unsuccessful in coming to any agreement. It is true that,  a few days afterward, they submitted a majority and two minority  reports, and that the report of the majority was ultimately adopted by  the House; but, even if this action had been unanimous, and had been  taken in due time, it would have been practically futile on account of  its absolute failure to provide or suggest any solution of the  territorial question, which was the vital point in controversy.    No wonder, then, that, under the shadow of the failure of every effort  in Congress to find any common ground on which the sections could be  restored to amity, the close of the year should have been darkened by a  cloud in the firmament, which had lost even the silver lining so long  seen, or thought to be seen, by the hopeful.      [Footnote 19: The following extract from a letter of the Hon. O. R.  Singleton, then a Representative of Mississippi in the United States  Congress, in regard to the subject treated, is herewith annexed:        \"Canton, Mississippi, _July 14, 1877_.        \"In 1860, about the time the ordinance of secession was passed      by the South Carolina Convention, and while Mississippi,      Alabama, and other Southern States were making active      preparations to follow her example, a conference of the      Mississippi delegation in Congress, Senators and      Representatives, was asked for by Governor J. J. Pettus, for      consultation as to the course Mississippi ought to take in the      premises.        \"The meeting took place in the fall of 1860, at Jackson, the      capital; the whole delegation being present, with perhaps the      exception of one Representative.        \"The main question for consideration was: 'Shall Mississippi, as      soon as her Convention can meet, pass an ordinance of secession,      thus placing herself by the side of South Carolina, regardless      of the action of other States; or shall she endeavor to hold      South Carolina in check, and delay action herself, until other      States can get ready, through their conventions, to unite with      them, and then, on a given day and at a given hour, by concert      of action, all the States willing to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19846"],[0,"Encyclopaedia Britannica, 11th Edition, \"Bulgaria\" to \"Calgary\" (#20)"],[1,"suggested were that he had made himself very popular at Rome and that his  appointment was therefore calculated to strengthen the loosening bonds of  the Triple Alliance, and also that his early close association with  Bismarck would ensure the maintenance of the Bismarckian tradition. As  foreign secretary Herr von Buelow was chiefly responsible for carrying out  the policy of colonial expansion with which the emperor had identified  himself, and in 1899, on bringing to a successful conclusion the  negotiations by which the Caroline Islands were acquired by Germany, he was  raised to the rank of count. On the resignation of Hohenlohe in 1900 he was  chosen to succeed him as chancellor of the empire and president of the  Prussian ministry.    The _Berliner Neueste Nachrichten_, commenting on this appointment, very  aptly characterized the relations of the new chancellor to the emperor, in  contrast to the position occupied by Bismarck. \"The Germany of William  II.,\" it said, \"does not admit a Titan in the position of the highest  official of the Empire. A cautious and versatile diplomatist like Bernhard  von Buelow appears to be best adapted to the personal and political  necessities of the present situation.\" Count Buelow, indeed, though, like  Bismarck, a \"realist,\" utilitarian and opportunist in his policy, made no  effort to emulate the masterful independence of the great chancellor. He  was accused, indeed, of being little more than the complacent executor of  the emperor's will, and defended himself in the Reichstag against the  charge. The substance of the relations between the emperor and himself, he  declared, rested on mutual good-will, and added: \"I must lay it down most  emphatically that the prerogative of the emperor's personal initiative must  not be curtailed, and will not be curtailed, by any chancellor.... As  regards the chancellor, however, I say that no imperial chancellor worthy  of the name ... would take up any position which in his conscience he did  not regard as justifiable.\" It is clear that the position of a chancellor  holding these views in relation to a ruler so masterful and so impulsive as  the emperor William II. could be no easy one; and Buelow's long continuance  in office is the best proof of his genius. His first conspicuous act as  chancellor was a masterly defence in the Reichstag of German action in  China, a defence which was, indeed, rendered easier by the fact that Prince  Hohenlohe had--to use his own words--\"dug a canal\" for the flood of  imperial ambition of which warning had been given in the famous \"mailed  fist\" speech. Such incidents as this, however, though they served to  exhibit consummate tact and diplomatic skill, give little index to the  fundamental character of his work as chancellor. Of this it may be said, in  general, that it carried on the best traditions of the Prussian service in  whole-hearted devotion to the interests of the state. The accusation that  he was an \"agrarian\" he thought it necessary to rebut in a speech delivered  on the 18th of February 1906 to the German Handelstag. He was an agrarian,  he declared, in so far as he came of a land-owning family, and was  interested in the prosperity of agriculture; but as chancellor, whose  function it is to watch over the welfare [v.04 p.0794] of all classes, he  was equally concerned with the interests of commerce and industry  (_Koelnische Zeitung_, Feb. 20, 1906). Some credit for the immense material  expansion of Germany under his chancellorship is certainly due to his zeal  and self-devotion. This was generously recognized by the emperor in a  letter publicly addressed to the chancellor on the 21st of May 1906,  immediately after the passage of the Finance Bill. \"I am fully conscious,\"  it ran, \"of the conspicuous share in the initiation and realization of this  work of reform... which must be ascribed to the statesmanlike skill and  self-sacrificing devotion with which you have conducted and promoted those  arduous labours.\" Rumours had from time to time been rife of a \"chancellor  crisis\" and Buelow's dismissal; in the _Berliner Tageblatt_ this letter was  compared to the \"Never!\" with which the emperor William I. had replied to  Bismarck's proffered resignation.    On the 6th of June 1905 Count Buelow was raised to the rank of prince  (_Fuerst_), on the occasion of the marriage of the crown prince. The  coincidence of this date with the fall of M. Delcasse, the French minister  for foreign affairs--a triumph for Germany and a humiliation for  France--was much commented on at the time (see _The Times_, June 7, 1905);  and the elevation of Bismarck to the rank of prince in the Hall of Mirrors  at Versailles was recalled. Whatever element of truth there may have been  in this, however, the significance of the incident was much exaggerated.    On the 5th of April 1906, while attending a debate in the Reichstag, Prince  Buelow was seized with illness, the result of overwork and an attack of  influenza, and was carried unconscious from the hall. At first it was  thought that the attack would be fatal, and Lord Fitzmaurice in the House  of Lords compared the incident with that of the death of Chatham, a  compliment much appreciated in Germany. The illness, however, quickly took  a favourable turn, and after a month's rest the chancellor was able to  resume his duties. In 1907 Prince Buelow was made the subject of a  disgraceful libel, which received more attention than it deserved because  it coincided with the Harden-Moltke scandals; his character was, however,  completely vindicated, and the libeller, a journalist named Brand, received  a term of imprisonment.    The parliamentary skill of Prince Buelow in holding together the  heterogeneous elements of which the government majority in the Reichstag  was composed, no less than the diplomatic tact with which he from time to  time \"interpreted\" the imperial indiscretions to the world, was put to a  rude test by the famous \"interview\" with the German emperor, published in  the London _Daily Telegraph_ of the 28th of October 1908 (see WILLIAM II.,  German emperor), which aroused universal reprobation in Germany. Prince  Buelow assumed the official responsibility, and tendered his resignation to  the emperor, which was not accepted; but the chancellor's explanation in  the Reichstag on the 10th of November showed how keenly he felt his  position. He declared his conviction that the disastrous results of the  interview would \"induce the emperor in future to observe that strict  reserve, even in private conversations, which is equally indispensable in  the interest of a uniform policy and for the authority of the crown,\"  adding that, in the contrary case, neither he nor any successor of his  could assume the responsibility (_The Times_, Nov. 11, 1908, p. 9). The  attitude of the emperor showed that he had taken the lesson to heart. It  was not the imperial indiscretions, but the effect of his budget proposals  in breaking up the Liberal-Conservative _bloc_, on whose support he  depended in the Reichstag, that eventually drove Prince Buelow from office  (see GERMANY: _History_). At the emperor's request he remained to pilot the  mutilated budget through the House; but on the 14th of July 1909 the  acceptance of his resignation was announced.    Prince Buelow married, on the 9th of January 1886, Maria Anna Zoe Rosalia  Beccadelli di Bologna, Princess Camporeale, whose first marriage with Count  Karl von Doenhoff had been dissolved and declared null by the Holy See in  1884. The princess, an accomplished pianist and pupil of Liszt, was a  step-daughter of the Italian statesman Minghetti.    See J. Penzler, _Graf Buelows Reden nebst urkundlichen Beitraegen zu seiner  Politik_ (Leipzig, 1903).    BUeLOW, DIETRICH HEINRICH, FREIHERR VON (1757-1807), Prussian soldier and  military writer, and brother of General Count F.W. Buelow, entered the  Prussian army in 1773. Routine work proved distasteful to him, and he read  with avidity the works of the chevalier Folard and other theoretical  writers on war, and of Rousseau. After sixteen years' service he left  Prussia, and endeavoured without success to obtain a commission in the  Austrian army. He then returned to Prussia, and for some time managed a  theatrical company. The failure of this undertaking involved Buelow in heavy  losses, and soon afterwards he went to America, where he seems to have been  converted to, and to have preached, Swedenborgianism. On his return to  Europe he persuaded his brother to engage in a speculation for exporting  glass to the United States, which proved a complete failure. After this for  some years he made a precarious living in Berlin by literary work, but his  debts accumulated, and it was under great disadvantages that he produced  his _Geist des Neueren Kriegssystems_ (Hamburg, 1799) and _Der Feldzug  1800_ (Berlin, 1801). His hopes of military employment were again  disappointed, and his brother, the future field marshal, who had stood by  him in all his troubles, finally left him. After wandering in France and  the smaller German states, he reappeared at Berlin in 1804, where he wrote  a revised edition of his _Geist des Neueren Kriegssystems_ (Hamburg, 1805),  _Lehrsaetze des Neueren Kriegs_ (Berlin, 1805), _Geschichte des Prinzen  Heinrich von Preussen_ (Berlin, 1805), _Neue Taktik der Neuern wie sie sein  sollte_ (Leipzig, 1805), and _Der Feldzug 1805_ (Leipzig, 1806). He also  edited, with G.H. von Behrenhorst (1733-1814) and others, _Annalen des  Krieges_ (Berlin, 1806). These brilliant but unorthodox works,  distinguished by an open contempt of the Prussian system, cosmopolitanism  hardly to be distinguished from high treason, and the mordant sarcasm of a  disappointed man, brought upon Buelow the enmity of the official classes and  of the government. He was arrested as insane, but medical examination  proved him sane and he was then lodged as"]]]
