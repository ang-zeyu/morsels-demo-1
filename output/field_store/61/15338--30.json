Nor will any Belgian, I trust, doubt of what I suffer in  my soul, as a citizen and as a Bishop, in sympathy with all this sorrow.  These last four months have seemed to me age long. By thousands have our  brave ones been mowed down. Wives, mothers are weeping for those they  shall not see again; hearths are desolate; dire poverty spreads, anguish  increases.    At Malines, at Antwerp the people of two great cities have been given  over, the one for six hours, the other for thirty-four hours, to a  continuous bombardment, to the throes of death.    I have traversed the greater part of the districts most terribly  devastated in my diocese,[4] and the ruins I beheld, and the ashes, were  more dreadful than I, prepared by the saddest of forebodings, could have  imagined.    [Footnote 4: Duffel, Lierre, Berlaer Saint Rombaut, Konings-Hoyckt,  Mortsel, Waelhem, Muysen, Wavre Sainte Caterine, Wavre Notre Dame,  Sempst, Weerde, Eppeghen, Hofstade, Elewyt, Rymenam, Boort-Meerbeek,  Wespelaer, Haecht, Werchter-Wackerzeel, Rotselaer, Tremeloo; Louvain and  its suburban environs, Blauwput, Kessel-Loo, Boven-Loo, Linden, Herent,  Thildonck, Bueken, Relst, Aerschot, Wesemael, Hersselt, Diest, Schaffen,  Molenstede, Rillaer, Gelrode.]    Other parts of my diocese, which I have not had time to visit,[5] have  in like manner been laid waste. Churches, schools, asylums, hospitals,  convents in great numbers are in ruins. Entire villages have all but  disappeared. At Werchter-Wackerzeel, for instance, out of 380 homes 130  remain. At Tremeloo two-thirds of the village are overthrown. At Bueken,  out of 100 houses 20 are standing. At Schaffen, 189 houses out of 200  are destroyed; 11 still stand. At Louvain the third part of the  buildings are down; 1,074 dwellings have disappeared. On the town land  and in the suburbs 1,823 houses have been burned.    [Footnote 5: Haekendover, Roosbeek, Bautersem, Budingen, Neerlinder,  Ottignies, Mousty, Wavre, Beyghem, Capelle-au-Bois, Humbeek,  Nieuwenrode, Liezelo, Londerzeel, Heyndonck, Mariekerke, Weert,  Blaesvelt.]    In this dear City of Louvain, perpetually in my thoughts, the  magnificent Church of St. Peter will never recover its former splendor.  The ancient College of St. Ives, the art schools, the consular and  commercial schools of the university, the old markets, our rich library  with its collections, its unique and unpublished manuscripts, its  archives, its gallery of great portraits of illustrious rectors,  chancellors, professors, dating from the time of its foundation, which  preserved for masters and students alike a noble tradition, and were an  incitement in their studies, all this accumulation of intellectual, of  historic, and of artistic riches, the fruit of the labors of five  centuries--all is in the dust.    Many a parish lost its pastor. There is now sounding in my ears the  sorrowful voice of an old man, of whom I asked whether he had had mass  on Sunday in his battered church. \"It is two months,\" he said, \"since we  had a church.\" The parish priest and the curate had been interned in a  concentration camp.    Thousands of Belgian citizens have in like manner been deported to the  prisons of Germany, to Munsterlagen, to Celle, to Magdeburg. At  Munsterlagen alone, 3,100 civil prisoners were numbered. History will  tell of the physical and moral torments of their long martyrdom.    Hundreds of innocent men were shot. I possess no complete necrology; but  I know that there were ninety-one shot at Aerschot and that there, under  pain of death, their fellow-citizens were compelled to dig their graves.  In the Louvain group of communes 176 persons, men and women, old men and  sucklings, rich and poor, in health and sickness, were shot or burned.    In my diocese alone I know that thirteen priests or religious were put  to death.[6]    [Footnote 6: Their brothers in religion or in the priesthood will wish  to know their names. Here they are: Dupierreux of the Society of Jesus,  Brothers Sebastian and Allard of the Congregation of the Josephites,  Brother Candide of the Congregation of the Brothers of Mercy, Father  Maximin, Capuchin, and Father Vincent, Conventual; Lombaerts, parish  priest at Boven-Loo; Goris, parish priest at Autgaerden; Carette,  professor at the Episcopal College of Louvain; de Clerck, parish priest  at Bueken; Dergent, parish priest at Gelrode, and Wouters Jean, parish  priest at Pont-Buule. We have reason to believe that the parish priest  of Herent, van Bladel, an old man of 71, was also killed. Until now,  however, his body has not been found.]    One of these, the parish priest of Gelrode, suffered, I believe, a  veritable martyrdom. I made a pilgrimage to his grave, and amid the  little flock which so lately he had been feeding with the zeal of an  apostle, there did I pray to him that from the height of Heaven he would  guard his parish, his diocese, his country.    We can neither number our dead nor compute the measure of our ruins. And  what would it be if we turned our sad steps toward Liege, Namur,  Audenne, Dinant, Tamines, Charleroi, and elsewhere?[7] And there, where  lives were not taken, and there, where the stones of buildings were not  thrown down, what anguish unrevealed! Families hitherto living at ease  now in bitter want; all commerce at an end, all careers ruined, industry  at a standstill, thousands upon thousands of workingmen without  employment, working women, shopgirls, humble servant girls without the  means of earning their bread, and poor souls forlorn on the bed of  sickness and fever, crying, \"O Lord, how long, how long?\"    [Footnote 7: I have said that thirteen ecclesiastics had been shot  within the Diocese of Malines. There were, to my own actual personal  knowledge, more than thirty in the Dioceses of Namur, Tournai, and  Liege--Schlogel, parish priest of Hastiere; Gille, parish priest of  Couvin; Pieret, curate at Etalle; Alexandre, curate at Mussy-la-Ville;  Marechal, seminarist at Maissin; the Rev. Father Gillet, Benedictine of  Maredsous; the Rev. Father Nicolas, Premonstratensian of the Abbey of  Leffe; two brothers of the same abbey; one brother of the Congregation  of Oblates; Poskin, parish priest of Surice; Hotlet, parish priest of  Les Alloux; Georges, parish priest of Tintigny; Glouden, parish priest  of Latour; Zenden, retired parish priest of Latour; Jacques, a priest;  Druet, parish priest of Acoz; Pollart, parish priest of Roselies;  Labeye, parish priest of Blegny-Trembleur; Thielen, parish priest of  Haccourt; Janssen, parish priest of Heure le Romain; Chabot, parish  priest of Foret; Dossogne, parish priest of Hockay; Reusonnet, curate of  Olme; Bilande, chaplain of the Institute of Deaf Mutes at Bouge; Docq, a  priest, and others.]    There is nothing to reply. The reply remains the secret of God.    Yes, dearest brethren, it is the secret of God. He is the Master of  events and the Sovereign Director of the human multitude. _Domini est  terra et plenitudo ejus; orbis terrarum et universi qui habitant in eo._  The first relation between the creature and his Creator is that of  absolute dependence. The very being of the creature is dependent;  dependent are his nature, his faculties, his acts, his works.    At every passing moment that dependence is renewed, is incessantly  reasserted, inasmuch as, without the will of the Almighty, existence of  the first single instant would vanish before the next. Adoration, which  is the recognition of the sovereignty of God, is not, therefore, a  fugitive act; it is the permanent state of a being conscious of his own  origin. On every page of the Scriptures Jehovah affirms His sovereign  dominion.    The whole economy of the old law, the whole history of the chosen  people, tend to the same end--to maintain Jehovah upon His throne and to  cast idols down. \"I am the first and the last. I am the Lord, and there  is none else; there is no God beside Me. I form the light and create  darkness, I make peace and create evil. Woe to him that gainsayeth his  maker, a sherd of the earthen pots. Shall the clay say to him that  fashioneth it, What art thou making, and thy work is without hands? Tell  ye, and come, and consult together. A just God and a Saviour, there is  none beside Me.\"    Ah, did the proud reason of mankind dream that it could dismiss our God?  Did it smile in irony when through Christ and through His Church He  pronounced the solemn words of expiation and of repentance? Vain of  fugitive successes, O light-minded man, full of pleasure and of wealth,  hast thou imagined that thou couldst suffice even to thyself?    Then was God set aside in oblivion, then was He misunderstood, then was  He blasphemed, with acclamation, and by those whose authority, whose  influence, whose power had charged them with the duty of causing His  great laws and His great order to be revered and obeyed. Anarchy then  spread among the lower ranks of mankind, and many sincere consciences  were troubled by the evil example. How long, O Lord, they wondered, how  long wilt Thou suffer the pride of this iniquity? Or wilt Thou finally  justify the impious opinion that Thou carest no more for the work of Thy  hands? A shock from a thunderbolt, and behold, all human foresight is  set at nought! Europe trembles upon the brink of destruction!    The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.    Many are the thoughts that throng the breast of man today, and the chief  of them all is this:    God reveals Himself as the Master. The nations that made the attack, and  the nations that are warring in self-defense, alike confess themselves  to be in the hand of Him without Whom nothing is made, nothing is done.    Men long unaccustomed to prayer are turning again to God. Within the  army, within the civil world, in public, and within the individual  conscience, there is prayer. Nor is that prayer today a word"]]]
