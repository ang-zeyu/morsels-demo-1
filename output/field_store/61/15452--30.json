Indeed I have completely forgotten something--your mate's name.  I have  a message for him.\"  And I looked the man nearest me straight in the  eye.    \"Ah!\" he ejaculated; \"monsieur doubtless means Monsieur Favart, our  chief mate--\"    \"Of course,\" I cut in.  \"Favart is the name.  Thanks!  Go you on to the  house and walk straight in; you will find your friends awaiting you.  As  for me--\" I flung out my hand with an expression of disgust, and turned  back as though to return to the wharf edge.  But as soon as the  quartette had fairly entered the house and I was assured, by certain  subdued sounds, that they had fallen into the trap that had been set for  them, I turned on my heel again, and presently found the four prisoners  in process of being secured.    \"I am sorry, lads,\" I said to them in French, \"that I have been  compelled to resort to subterfuge to make prisoners of you, but, you  see, we are all invalids here, and not strong enough to take your ship  by force; and therefore, since it is imperative that we should have her,  I have been compelled to use guile.  However, I will keep my word with  you in the matter of something to quench your parched throats; and if  you choose to be sensible, and make no foolish attempts at escape, you  shall have no reason to complain of harsh treatment.\"    \"Ah, Monsieur Anglais, if we had but known--\" answered one of the  Frenchmen, with a rather rueful smile.  \"However,\" he continued,  shrugging his shoulders, \"although you have contrived to get hold of  us--and the captain--you have not yet got the ship; and before you can  get her you will be obliged to use a great deal more guile than sufficed  for our capture; for Monsieur Favart is a sharp one, I assure you, and  not to be so very easily deceived.\"    \"I can well believe it,\" I answered lightly.  \"All the same, I am very  much obliged to you for the hint, and will do my best to profit by it.\"    Whereupon, as I turned on my heel to quit the house, the garrulous  Frenchman's three shipmates fell upon him, figuratively, tooth and nail,  heaping reproaches upon the unhappy man's head for having warned me  against the chief mate's astuteness.  I did not wait to hear how the  matter ended, but, leaving the house briskly, as though I were the  bearer of an important message, I hurried across to the wharf and,  dropping into the dinghy, cast off her painter and sculled her across to  _La Belle Estelle_, alongside which I coolly went, and, making fast the  painter, ascended the gangway ladder and stepped in on deck before  anybody condescended to take any notice of me.  There were some twenty  men, or thereabout, busying themselves about the deck in a very  leisurely manner, taking off hatches, hauling taut the running rigging,  and so on, under the supervision of a very smart, keen-looking man,  dressed, like the skipper of the ship, in white.  This man I took to be  Monsieur Favart, the chief mate; so stepping up to him where he stood,  at the break of the monkey poop, I raised my hat politely and said:    \"Have I the pleasure to address Monsieur Favart, the chief mate of this  vessel?\"    \"Certainly, monsieur,\" he answered, bringing his piercing black eyes to  bear upon me.  \"And who may you be, my friend, that you find it  necessary to ask such a question?  I thought I had been here often  enough to enable every dweller upon yonder island to at least know Jules  Favart by sight.  But I do not seem to remember ever having seen you  before.\"    \"You have not, monsieur,\" I answered.  \"I am quite a new recruit, and  only joined just in time to witness the destruction of that pestilent  British man-o'-war, the wreck of which you doubtless observed as you  entered the river.\"    \"We did,\" he answered; \"and we guessed, of course, that it was the wreck  of the _Psyche_.  So that affair came off all right, eh?  Well, I didn't  very well see how it could possibly fail, for we all had a hand in the  devising and arranging of it, and we chopped and trimmed away at the  plan until I flatter myself that it was as perfect as human ingenuity  could make it.  But I take it that you did not come aboard here to  discuss that matter with me?\"    \"No, indeed,\" I answered.  \"My business with you has reference to quite  another affair.  I bring a message to you from Captain Lenoir, who is at  present discussing with Senor Morillo the matter of the expected arrival  of the cauffle this afternoon.  We find ourselves in something of a  difficulty over that matter; and your arrival in the nick of time proves  most opportune.  For you must know that when the _Psyche_ was cut adrift  and came ashore, her crew were compelled to camp on the beach, yonder;  and Senor Morillo considered that the opportunity to give the English a  thorough drubbing was far too good to be let slip; he therefore attacked  them in the dead of night, and punished them severely; but I regret to  say that our side also suffered very heavily, with the result that a  good many of our best men are at this moment on the sick list and unfit  for duty.  This puts us in a very awkward position; for the cauffle that  is arriving is a big one, and rather difficult to handle--so we learn.  Therefore, in order to avoid all possibility of trouble, Senor Morillo  has arranged with Captain Lenoir that the latter shall land his crew to  lend a hand in keeping the slaves in order when they arrive; and my  instructions from the captain are to request that you will at once land,  bringing all hands except the idlers with you.\"    \"I understand,\" answered Favart.  \"Very well.  When is the cauffle  expected to arrive?\"    \"It may heave in sight at any moment,\" I answered.  \"Therefore it is  advisable that you should lose no time in obeying Captain Lenoir's  instructions.\"    \"Trust me, I am not a man to lose time,\" answered Favart with a  boisterous laugh.  \"Lenoir knows he may rely upon me.  I suppose we  ought to go fully armed?\"    \"Captain Lenoir said nothing about that,\" I answered.  \"No, I don't  think there will be any need for you to arm yourselves.  Anyhow, if  weapons are needed we have plenty ashore.\"    \"Very well; so much the better,\" observed Favart; \"for it has just  occurred to me that the skipper has the keys of the arms chest in his  pocket, and we could not get at the weapons, even though we should  require them ever so urgently.  All right; you may tell the captain to  expect me at once.  But perhaps you would prefer to remain and go with  us--I see that you are one of the lame ducks.  Did you get that hurt in  the fight with the English?\"    \"Yes,\" said I--\"a broken arm.  It is getting better fast, however; and I  dare say I can scull the dinghy back, as I sculled her off, unless you  will be charitable enough to give me a tow.\"    \"Of course I will, with the utmost pleasure,\" answered Favart.  And away  he bustled forward, shouting an order for all hands to lay aft and get a  couple of boats into the water.  It was a very great relief to me to be  rid of the fellow for a few minutes, for, truth to tell, the interview  was beginning to get upon my nerves a bit; I could see that the French  seaman's estimate of his chief officer was just, and that Favart was  indeed \"a sharp one.\"  True, I had managed to hoodwink him, thus far,  but I was in constant dread of saying or doing something that might  awaken his suspicions, in which case all the fat would at once be in the  fire; for I had placed myself absolutely in his power, and I judged him  to be a man who would take a terrible revenge, should he prematurely  discover that something was wrong.  Moreover, if his suspicions should  once be aroused, and verified, not only did we stand to lose the ship--  which I was quite determined to capture--but with twenty stout seamen at  his back he was fully capable of recapturing the factory and releasing  all the prisoners, when we should find ourselves in a very pretty mess.  Thus far, however, everything seemed to be going admirably, and I told  myself that all I had to do was to keep my nerve and neither say nor do  anything to excite suspicion; indeed it was this consideration that  caused me to hang about aboard _La Belle Estelle_ rather than hurry away  ashore again as soon as I had delivered my message.    There was a great deal of fuss and bustle on board the brig, while the  Frenchmen were clearing away and lowering the boats; then, with a vast  amount of jabber, they went down the side, took their places, and shoved  off, with me and my dinghy in tow.    Now came the critical moment when everything must be won or lost; for,  personally, I had done all that was possible, and the rest depended  entirely upon the intelligence of the little party of seamen to whom I  had entrusted the carrying out of my plan; I had explained that plan to  them, and directed them what to do and precisely when to do it, and I  was also decoying the enemy into the trap prepared for them; but I  foresaw clearly that if my men acted prematurely, and thus gave the  alarm, or, on the other hand, allowed the psychological moment to pass  before they put in an appearance, the whole affair was likely enough to  end in a ghastly tragedy.    But while I reflected thus the boats traversed the space of water  between the brig and the wharf, and ranged up alongside the landing  steps.  Then, with more excited jabber and shouting, the Frenchmen  tumbled over the gunwales and up the steps to the top of the wharf,  where they stood in a bunch, waiting for further orders.  As the last of  them ascended the steps, with me bringing up the rear, I glanced across  the water toward the spot where I expected the cauffle to appear, and  pretended that I caught sight of a cloud of dust rising beyond the  trees.  As a matter of fact there really was an effect of sunlight that  might very easily have been mistaken for a dust cloud, and it "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21077"],[0,"The Mind and the Brain (#20)"],[1,"ows, for we receive, or think we receive, identical  sensations. At all events, we receive corresponding sensations. On the  other hand, my thought is mine, and is known to me alone; it is my  sanctuary, my private closet, where others do not enter. Every one can  see what I see, but no one knows what I think.    But this difference in the accessibility of phenomena is not due to  their peculiar nature. It is connected with a different fact, with the  modes of excitement which call them forth. If the visual sensation is  common to all, it is because the exciting cause of the sensation is an  object external to our nervous systems, and acting at a distance on  all.[34] The tactile sensation is at the beginning more personal to  the one who experiences it, since it requires contact; and the lower  sensations are in this intimacy still in progress. And then, the same  object can give rise, in common-place circumstances, to a sensation  either common to all beings or special to one alone. The capsule of  antipyrine which I swallow is, before my doing so, visible to all  eyes; once in my mouth, I am the only one to perceive it. It is  therefore possible that the same sensation, according to the  displacements of the object which excites it, may make part of the  internal or of the external series; and as all psychic life is  sensation, even effort, and, as we are assured, emotion, it follows  that our argument extends to all the psychical elements.    Finally, the internal or external character of events, which might be  called their geographical position, is a characteristic which has no  influence upon the method destined to take cognisance of it. The  method remains one. Introspection does not represent a source of  cognition distinct from externospection, for the same faculties of the  mind--reason, attention, and reflection--act on sensation, the source  of the so-called external sciences, and on the idea, the source of the  so-called inner science. A fact can be studied by essentially the same  process, whether regarded by the eyes or depicted by the memory. The  consciousness changes its object and orientation, not its nature. It  is as if, with the same opera-glass, we looked in turn at the wall of  the room and through the window.    I can even quote on this point a significant fact: there are observers  who are organised in such a way that they especially observe by  memory. Placed before the sensorial phenomenon which strikes their  senses, they are sometimes amazed, as if hypnotised; they require to  get away from it to regain consciousness of themselves, to analyse the  fact, and to master it, and it is by means of the memory that they  study it, on condition, of course, of afterwards coming back to verify  their conclusions by a fresh observation from nature. Will it be said  that the physicist, the chemist, or the biologist who follows this  slow method, and who thus observes retroactively, practises physics  and biology by introspection? Evidently this would be ridiculous.    Conversely, introspection may, in certain cases, adopt the procedure  of externospection. No doubt it would be inexact to say that the  perception of one of our ideas always takes place through the same  mechanism as the perception of one of our sensations. To give an  account of what we think does not imply the same work as in the case  of what we see; for, generally, our thoughts and our images do not  appear to us spontaneously. They are first sought for by us, and are  only realised after having been wished for. We go from the vague to  the precise, from the confused to the clear; the direction of thought  precedes, then, its realisation in images; and the latter, being  expected, is necessarily comprehended when it is formed. But we may  come across curious circumstances in which it is the image which has  precedence over its appearance, and in that case it is exact to say  that this uninvoked image must be interpreted and recognised as if it  were an external object. In cases of this kind, there passes through  our mind something which surprises us. I see, by internal vision, a  face with a red nose, and I have to search my memory for a long time,  even for days, in order to give precision to the vague feeling that I  have seen it before, so as to finally say with confidence, \"It is So  and So!\" Or else I hear in my inner ear a certain voice, with a  metallic tone and authoritative inflections: this voice pronounces  scientific phrases, gives a series of lectures, but I know not to whom  it belongs, and it costs me a long effort to reach the interpretation:  it is the voice of M. Dastre! There is, then, a certain space of time,  more or less long, in which we can correctly assert that we are not  aware of what we are thinking; we are in the presence of a thought in  the same state of uncertainty as in that of an external, unknown, and  novel object. The labour of classification and of interpretation cast  upon us is of the same order; and, when this labour is effected  incorrectly, it may end in an illusion. Therefore illusions of  thought are quite as possible as illusions of the senses, though rarer  for the reasons above stated. But the question of frequency has no  theoretical importance.    I have shown elsewhere, by experiments on hysterics, that it is  possible by the intermediary of their insensibility to touch to  suggest ideas on the value of which the patients make mistakes. For  instance, you take the finger in which they have no sensation, you  touch it, you bend it. The patient, not seeing what is done, does not  feel it, but the tactile sensation unfelt by their principal  consciousness somehow awakes the visual image of the finger; this  enters into the field of consciousness, and most often is not  recognised by the subject, who describes the occurrence in his own  way; he claims, for instance, that he thinks of sticks or of columns.  In reality he does not know of what he is thinking, and we know better  than he. He is thinking of his finger, and does not recognise it.    All these examples show that the clearly defined characteristics into  which it is sought to divide extrospection and introspection do not  exist. There is, however, a reason for preserving the distinction,  because it presents a real interest for the psychology of the  individual. These two words introspection and extrospection admirably  convey the difference in the manner of thinking between those who  from preference look, and those who from preference reflect. On the  one hand, the observers, who are often men of action; on the other,  the speculators, who are often mystics. But it would be no more  legitimate by this means to separate psychology and physics than to  say, for instance, \"There are two kinds of geology: one is the geology  of France, for one is acquainted with it without going from home, and  the other is that of the rest of the world, because in order to know  it one must cross the frontier.\"    We reject, therefore, the definition drawn from the difference of  method. At bottom there is no difference of method, but only  differences of process, of _technique_. The method is always the same,  for it is derived from the application of a certain number of laws to  the objects of cognition, and these laws remain the same in all  spheres of application.    Here is another difference of method which, if it were true, would  have an incalculable importance. Psychology, we are told, is a science  of direct and immediate experiment; it studies facts as they present  themselves to our consciousness, while the natural sciences are  sciences of indirect and mediate experiment, for they are compelled to  interpret the facts of consciousness and draw from them conclusions on  nature. It has also been said, in a more ambitious formula, \"The  science of physical objects is relative; logical science is absolute.\"    Let us examine this by the rapid analysis of any perception taken at  haphazard. What I perceive directly, immediately, we are told, is not  the object, it is my state of consciousness; the object is inferred;  concluded, and taken cognisance of through the intermediary of my  state of consciousness. We only know it, says Lotze, _circa rem_. It  is therefore apprehended less immediately, and every natural science  employs a more roundabout method than that of psychology. This last,  by studying states of consciousness, which alone are known to us  directly, comprehends reality itself, absolute reality. \"There is more  absolute reality,\" M. Rabier boldly says, \"in the simple feeling that  a man, or even an animal, has of its pain when beaten than in all the  theories of physics, for, beyond these theories, it can be asked, what  are the things that exist. But it is an absurdity to ask one's self  if, beyond the pain of which one is conscious, there be not another  pain different from that one.\"[35]    Let us excuse in psychologists this petty and common whim for  exaggerating the merit of the science they pursue. But here the limit  is really passed, and no scholar will admit that the perception and  representation of a body, as it may take place in the brain of a  Berthelot, can present any inferiority as a cognition of the absolute,  to the pain felt by the snail I crush under my foot. Nobody except  metaphysicians will acknowledge that psychology is a more precise and  certain science than physics or chemistry.    The criterion furnished by the development of the respective sciences  would prove just the contrary. The observations of psychology are  always rather unprecise. Psychological phenomena, notwithstanding the  efforts of Fechner and his school, are not yet measured with the same  strictness and ease as the tangible reality. To speak plainly, the  psychologist who vaunts the superiority of his method, and only shows  inferior results, places himself in a somewhat ridiculous and  contradictory position;"]]]
