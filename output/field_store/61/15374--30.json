It has a central tower rebuilt about a  hundred years ago, and until that time had a transept. There is a  clerestory on either side of the nave. The chancel and the west end with  its circular window show signs of Lord Grimthorpe's style of  restoration. The tower contains a fine peal of ten bells. In the windows  of the south aisle is some richly coloured modern Belgian glass by  Capronnier; in the windows of the north aisle are some fragments of  fourteenth or fifteenth century glass, including the arms of Edmund, the  fifth son of Edward III., from whom in the male line Edward IV. was  descended, though he also traced his descent and his claim to the throne  from Lionel, the third son, through his daughter Philippa.    In the churchyard, which is of considerable extent, many of those who  fell in the two battles of St. Albans were buried.    #St. Michael's Church.#--St. Michael's Church is further from the  cathedral than St. Peter's. To reach it one must go westward from the  Clock Tower, along High Street and its continuations, down the hill past  Romelands, where, as we have seen, George Tankerfield, condemned by  Bishop Bonner as a Protestant heretic, was burnt at the stake. At last a  bridge over the Ver is reached, and, turning round to the left after  crossing it, we see St. Michael's Church before us. It has within the  last ten years lost its Saxon tower, a new one with no pretention to  beauty, pierced by two pentagonal windows in the third stage, having  been built on a slightly different foundation. It stands within the area  once inclosed by the walls of Verulamium, and Sir Gilbert Scott  conjectured that it was originally the Basilica of the Roman city  altered for Christian worship; but probably, though it may stand on the  same site, it is of more recent date, though still of great age. Like  the cathedral, its walls are built of Roman brick and flint. The plan is  irregular: there is a nave and chancel, a large south aisle, or rather  chantry, the eastern gable of which is of half-timber construction,  below which are two tall round-headed windows far apart, with a small  circular opening between them; the western gable has an opening with  louvre boards. The tower projects from the north aisle, its western wall  being flush with the west end of the nave; on the outside in the south  wall of the chancel is a canopied niche over a flat slab a few inches  above the level of the ground. The south door, within a porch, has a  pointed top beneath a wide, round-headed arch springing from imposts.  The arcading of the nave was formed by cutting arches through what  probably were at one time the outside walls of the church; two of these  on the south side open into the chapel. The carved oak pulpit of early  seventeenth-century work, with its sounding-board and iron frame for the  hour-glass, demands attention; but the chief attraction of the church  for many is the alabaster statue of Francis Bacon, which is placed in a  niche in the north wall of the chancel. He wished to be buried in this  church, as his mother was already buried there, and moreover it was the  parish church of his house at Gorhambury, and the only Christian church  within the walls of ancient Verulam, from which he took one of his  titles.    [Illustration: MONUMENT OF LORD BACON. \"_Sic sedebat._\"]    #St. Stephen's Church.#--There are two ways of getting to this church:  either by following the road that runs south from St. Michael's, and  after reaching the top of the hill turning sharply to the left; or by  going from the centre of the city down Holywell Hill and straight on,  past the London and North-Western Railway Station, up St. Stephen's  Hill. The church spire is a conspicuous landmark. The churchyard is  exceedingly pretty, and the church most interesting. It was originally  built in the tenth century by Abbot Ulsinus, rebuilt in the time of  Henry I., restored in the fifteenth, and again by Sir Gilbert Scott in  the nineteenth century. The south porch is of timber; under it is a  square-headed doorway; to the east of it is a chapel once called \"the  Leper's Chapel,\" but probably a chantry, now used as a vestry. There is  a small aisle on the south side. The spire is a broach and stands at the  west end. On the north side of the nave is a wide, blocked-up,  round-headed arch; through the blocking wall a pointed doorway was cut,  but this is also now blocked up. There is a door of Perpendicular style,  with a square-headed label terminated by heads much weathered, in the  west wall of the tower. The walls of this church are of the usual  materials, flint and Roman brick.    The lectern is of brass, and bears round its foot the inscription  \"Georgius Creichtoun Episcopus Dunkeldensis.\" There were two Scotch  bishops of this name; both lived in the sixteenth century. How the  lectern reached St. Albans no one knows for certain, but it may possibly  have been part of the plunder carried off by Sir Richard Lee from  Scotland. It was hidden for safety in a grave at the time of the civil  wars, but was found again in 1748 when the vault was opened.    [Illustration: THE OLD ROUND HOUSE, \"THE FIGHTING COCKS.\"]    #The Clock Tower.#--This is a most conspicuous object in the city,  standing near the market-place, almost due north of the Lady Chapel. It  was built at the beginning of the fifteenth century in order that the  curfew bell might be hung in it. This had been cast some seventy years  before the building of the tower, and had hung in the central tower of  the Abbey Church; it weighs about a ton. It bears the inscription:  \"Missi de coelis, habeo nomen Gabrielis.\" The tower was restored under  the direction of Sir Gilbert Scott in 1865, and in the process has lost  most of the interest it possessed.    #The Old Round House.#--This curious old house, also known as \"The  Fighting Cocks,\" stands near the river at the bottom of the roadway that  leads down from the town through the Great Gate, and probably occupies  the position of the Abbey gate that was known as St. Germain's Gate.  There is little doubt that the foundations of this house date back to  the time of the monastery, and may have been the foundations of the  gateway. The cellars, it is said, appear to have an opening into some  subterranean way. The name of \"Fighting Cocks\" no doubt indicates that  after the dissolution of the monastery a cockpit existed here. It is  said that it was at St. Germain's Gatehouse that the monks kept their  fishing tackle, rods and nets. A claim is made for this building, that  it is the oldest inhabited house in England, a claim that many other  buildings may well dispute.           *       *       *       *       *          INDEX      Abbots, chronological account of, 82-103.

[Transcriber's Note: Corrected  misspelling \"Ribbatua\" in original.]    _Ritornello, ritornelle_--a short instrumental prelude, interlude, or  postlude, in a vocal composition, as _e.g._, in an operatic aria or  chorus.    _Schottische_--a dance in two-quarter measure, something like the  _polka_.    _Sec, secco_--dry, unornamented: applied to a style of opera recitative  (see p. 75, Sec. 170), and also to some particular chord in an  instrumental composition which is to be sounded and almost instantly  dropped.    _Score_--a term used in two senses:         1. To designate some particular point to which teacher or       conductor wishes to call attention; as _e.g._, \"Begin with the       _lower score_, third measure.\" The word _brace_ is also       frequently used in this sense.         2. To refer to all the parts of a composition that are to be       performed simultaneously, when they have been assembled on a       single page for use by a chorus or orchestral conductor. The       term _vocal score_ usually means all chorus parts together       with an accompaniment arranged for piano or organ, while the       terms _full score_ and _orchestral score_ refer to a complete       assemblage of _all parts_, each being printed on a separate       staff, but all staffs being braced and barred together.    _Senza replica, senza repetizione_--without repetition; a term used in  connection with such indications as _D.C._, _D.S._, etc., which often  call for the repetition of some large division of a composition, the  term _senza replica_ indicating that the smaller repeats included within  the larger division are not to be observed the second time.

Its purpose  is to develop tone quality and flexibility. These terms are also often  applied to classes in sight-singing which use the sol-fa syllables.    _Sopra_--above.    _Soprano_--the highest female voice. Range approximately b--c'''.    _Sostenuto_--sustained or connected; the opposite of _staccato_.    _Sotto_--under. _E.g._, _sotto voce_--under the voice, _i.e._, with  subdued tone.    _Solmization_--sight-singing by syllable.    _Staccato_--detached; the opposite of _legato_.    _Subito_--suddenly.    _Tenor_--the highest male voice. Range approximately d--c''.    _Tenuto_--(from _teneo_, to hold)--a direction signifying that the tones  are to be prolonged to the full value indicated by the notes.    _Toccata_--a brilliant composition for piano or organ, usually  characterized by much rapid staccato playing.    _Triplet_--a group of three tones, to be performed in the time  ordinarily given to two of the same value. The first tone of the triplet  is always slightly accented.    _Tutti_--(derived from _totus_, _toti_, Latin--all)--a direction  signifying that all performers are to take part. Also used occasionally  to refer to a passage where all performers do take part.          APPENDIX A    THE HISTORY OF MUSIC NOTATION      Many conflicting statements have been made regarding the history and  development of music writing, and the student who is seeking light on  this subject is often at a loss to determine what actually did happen in  the rise of our modern system of writing music. We have one writer for  example asserting that staff notation was begun by drawing a single red  line across the page, this line representing the pitch _f_ (fourth line,  bass staff), the _neumae_ (the predecessors of our modern _notes_)  standing either for this pitch _f_, or for a higher or lower pitch,  according to their position _on_ the line, or _above_ or _below_ it.  \"Another line,\" continues this writer, \"this time of yellow color, was  soon added above the red one, and this line was to represent c' (middle  C). Soon the colors of these lines were omitted and the _letters_ F and  C were placed at the beginning of each of them. From this arose our F  and C clefs, which preceded the G clef by some centuries.\"[37]    [Footnote 37: Elson--Music Dictionary, article, \"Notation.\"]    Another writer[38] gives a somewhat different explanation, stating that  the staff system with the use of clefs came about through writing a  letter (C or F) in the margin of the manuscript and drawing a line from  this letter to the neume which was to represent the tone for which this  particular letter stood.    [Footnote 38: Goddard--The Rise of Music, p. 177.]    A third writer[39] asserts that because the alphabetical notation was  not suitable for recording melodies because of its inconvenience in  sight-singing \"points were placed at definite distances above the words  and above and below one another.\" \"In this system ... everything  depended on the accuracy with which the points were interspersed, and  the scribes, as a guide to the eye, began to scratch a straight line  across the page to indicate the position of one particular scale degree  from which all the others could be shown by the relative distances of  their points. But this was not found sufficiently definite and the  scratched line was therefore colored red and a second line was added,  colored yellow, indicating the interval of a fifth above the first.\"    [Footnote 39: Williams in Grove's Dictionary, article, \"Notation.\"]    It will be noted that all three writers agree that a certain thing  happened, but as in the case of the four Gospels in the New Testament,  not all the writers agree on details and it is difficult to determine  which account is most nearly accurate in detail as well as in general  statement. Communication was much slower a thousand years ago than now  and ideas about new methods of doing things did not spread rapidly,  consequently it is entirely possible that various men or groups of men  in various places worked out a system of notation differing somewhat in  details of origin and development but alike in final result. The point  is that the development of musical knowledge (rise of part-writing,  increased interest in instrumental music, etc.), demanded a more exact  system of notation than had previously existed, just as the development  of science in the nineteenth century necessitated a more accurate  scientific nomenclature, and in both cases the need gave rise to the  result as we have it to-day.    Out of the chaos of conflicting statements regarding the development of  music notation, the student may glean an outline-knowledge of three  fairly distinct periods or stages, each of these stages being intimately  bound up with the development of _music_ itself in that period. These  three stages are:         (1) The Greek system, which used the letters of the alphabet       for representing fixed pitches.         (2) The period of the neumae.         (3) The period of staff notation.    Of the Greek system little is known beyond the fact that the letters of  the alphabet were used to represent pitches. This method was probably  accurate enough, but it was cumbersome, and did not afford any means of  writing \"measured music\" nor did it give the eye any opportunity of  grasping the general outline of the melody in its progression upward and  downward, as staff notation does. The Greek system seems to have been  abandoned at some time preceding the fifth century. At any rate it was  about this time that certain _accent marks_ began to be written above  the text of the Latin hymns of the church, these marks serving to  indicate in a general way the progress of the melody. E.g., an upward  stroke of the pen indicated a rise of the melody, a downward stroke a  fall, etc. In the course of two or three centuries these marks were  added to and modified quite considerably, and the system of notation  which thus grew up was called \"neume notation,\" the word _neume_  (sometimes spelled _neuma_, or _pneuma_) being of Greek origin and  meaning a _nod_ or _sign_.    This system of neumes was in some ways a retrogression from the Greek  letter system, for the neumes indicated neither definite pitches nor  definite tone-lengths. But it had this advantage over the Greek system,  that the position of the signs on the page indicated graphically to the  eye the general direction of the melody, as well as giving at least a  hint concerning the relative highness or lowness of each individual tone  (the so-called _diastematic system_), and this was a great aid to the  eye in singing, just as the relative highness and lowness of notes on  the modern staff is of great value in reading music at the present time.  Thus although the neumae did not enable one to sing a new melody at  sight as our modern staff notation does, yet they served very well to  recall to the eye the general outline of a melody previously learned by  ear and therefore enabled the singer (the system was used for vocal  music only) to differentiate between that particular melody and the  dozens of others which he probably knew. Neume notation was used mostly  in connection with the \"plain-song melodies\" of the Church, and since  the words of these chants were sung as they would be pronounced in  reading, the deficiency of the neume system in not expressing definite  duration values was not felt. But later on with the rise of so-called  \"measured music\" (cf. invention of opera, development of independent  instrumental music, etc.), this lack was seen to be one of the chief  disadvantages of the system.
