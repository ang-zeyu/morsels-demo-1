And on the base of the statue is a representation of the  birth of Pandora--the first woman, according to Hesiod and other poets;  for before her there was no race of women. Here too I remember to have  seen the only statue here of the Emperor Adrian; and at the entrance one  of Iphicrates, the celebrated Athenian general.    And outside the temple is a brazen Apollo said to be by Phidias; and  they call it Apollo, Averter of Locusts, because when the locusts  destroyed the land the god said he would drive them out of the country.  And they know that he did so, but they don't say how. I myself know of  locusts having been thrice destroyed on Mount Sipylus, but not in the  same way; for some were driven away by a violent wind that fell on them,  and others by a strong light that came on them after showers, and others  were frozen to death by a sudden frost. All this came under my own  notice.    There is also a building called the Erechtheum, and in the vestibule is  an altar of Supreme Zeus, where they offer no living sacrifice, but  cakes without the usual libation of wine. And as you enter there are  three altars: one to Poseidon (on which they also sacrifice to  Erechtheus according to the oracle), one to the hero Butes, and the  third to Hephaestus. And on the walls are paintings of the family of  Butes. The building is a double one; and inside there is sea-water in a  well. And this is no great marvel; for even those who live in inland  parts have such wells, as notably Aphrodisienses in Caria. But this well  is represented as having a roar as of the sea when the south wind blows.  And in the rock is the figure of a trident. And this is said to have  been Poseidon's proof in regard to the territory Athene disputed with  him.    Sacred to Athene is all the rest of Athens, and similarly all Attica;  for altho they worship different gods in different townships, none the  less do they honor Athene generally. And the most sacred of all is the  statue of Athene in what is now called the Acropolis, but was then  called the Polis (city) which was universally worshiped many years  before the various townships formed one city; and the rumor about it is  that it fell from heaven. As to this I shall not give an opinion,  whether it was so or not. And Callimachus made a golden lamp for the  goddess. And when they fill this lamp with oil it lasts for a whole  year, altho it burns continually night and day. And the wick is of a  particular kind of cotton flax, the only kind indestructible by fire.  And above the lamp is a palm tree of brass reaching to the roof and  carrying off the smoke. And Callimachus, the maker of this lamp, altho  he comes behind the first artificers, yet was remarkable for ingenuity,  and was the first who perforated stone, and got the name of  \"Art-Critic,\" whether his own appellation or given him by others.    In the temple of Athene Polias is a Hermes of wood (said to be a votive  offering of Cecrops), almost hidden by myrtle leaves. And of the antique  votive offerings worthy of record, is a folding-chair, the work of  Daedalus, and spoils taken from the Persians--as a coat of mail of  Masistius, who commanded the cavalry at Plataea, and a scimitar said to  have belonged to Mardonius. Masistius we know was killed by the Athenian  cavalry; but as Mardonius fought against the Lacedaemonians and was  killed by a Spartan, they could not have got it at first hand; nor is it  likely that the Lacedaemonians would have allowed the Athenians to carry  off such a trophy. And about the olive they have nothing else to tell  but that the goddess used it as a proof of her right to the country,  when it was contested by Poseidon. And they record also that this olive  was burnt when the Persians set fire to Athens; but tho burnt, it grew  the same day two cubits.    And next to the temple of Athene is the temple of Pandrosus; who was the  only one of the three sisters who didn't peep into the forbidden chest.  Now the things I most marveled at are not universally known. I will  therefore write of them as they occur to me. Two maidens live not far  from the temple of Athene Polias, and the Athenians call them the  \"carriers of the holy things\"; for a certain time they live with the  goddess, but when her festival comes they act in the following way, by  night: Putting upon their heads what the priestess of Athene gives them  to carry (neither she nor they know what these things are), these  maidens descend, by a natural underground passage, from an inclosure in  the city sacred to Aphrodite of the Gardens. In the sanctuary below they  deposit what they carry, and bring back something else closely wrapt up.  And these maidens they henceforth dismiss, and other two they elect  instead of them for the Acropolis.          THE ELGIN MARBLES[45]    BY J. P. MAHAFFY      Morosini[46] wished to take down the sculptures of Phidias from the  eastern pediment, but his workmen attempted it so clumsily that the  figures fell from their place and were dashed to pieces on the ground.    An observing traveler[47] was present when a far more determined and  systematic attack was made upon the remaining ruins of the Parthenon.  While he was traveling in the interior, Lord Elgin had obtained his  famous firman from the Sultan, to take down and remove any antiquities  or sculptured stones he might require, and the infuriated Dodwell saw a  set of ignorant workmen, under equally ignorant overseers, let loose  upon the splendid ruins of the age of Pericles. He speaks with much good  sense and feeling of this proceeding. He is fully aware that the world  would derive inestimable benefit from the transplanting of these  splendid fragments to a more accessible place, but he can not find  language strong enough to express his disgust at the way in which the  thing was done.    Incredible as it may appear, Lord Elgin himself seems not to have  superintended the work, but to have left it to paid contractors, who  undertook the job for a fixt sum. Little as either Turks or Greeks cared  for the ruins, he says that a pang of grief was felt through all Athens  at the desecration, and that the contractors were obliged to bribe  workmen with additional wages to undertake the ungrateful task. Dodwell  will not even mention Lord Elgin by name, but speaks of him with disgust  as \"the person\" who defaced the Parthenon. He believes that had this  person been at Athens himself, his underlings could hardly have behaved  in the reckless way they did, pulling down more than they wanted, and  taking no care to prop up and save the work from which they had taken  the support.    He especially notices their scandalous proceeding upon taking up one of  the great white marble blocks which form the floor or stylobate of the  temple. They wanted to see what was underneath, and Dodwell, who was  there, saw the foundation--a substructure of Peiraeic sandstone. But when  they had finished their inspection they actually left the block they had  removed, without putting it back into its place. So this beautiful  pavement, made merely of closely-fitting blocks, without any artificial  or foreign joinings, was ripped up, and the work of its destruction  began. I am happy to add that, tho a considerable rent was then made,  most of it is still intact, and the traveler of to-day may still walk on  the very stones which bore the tread of every great Athenian.    The question has often been discust, whether Lord Elgin was justified in  carrying off this pediment, the metopes, and the friezes, from their  place; and the Greeks of to-day hope confidently that the day will come  when England will restore these treasures to their place. This is, of  course, absurd, and it may fairly be argued that people who would  bombard their antiquities in a revolution are not fit custodians of them  in the intervals of domestic quiet. This was my reply to an old Greek  gentleman who assailed the memory of Lord Elgin with reproaches.    I confess I approved of this removal until I came home from Greece, and  went again to see the spoil in its place in our great museum. Tho there  treated with every care--tho shown to the best advantage, and explained  by excellent models of the whole building, and clear descriptions of  their place on it--notwithstanding all this, it was plain that these  wonderful fragments lost so terribly by being separated from their  place--they looked so unmeaning in an English room, away from their  temple, their country and their lovely atmosphere--that one earnestly  wished they had never been taken from their place, even at the risk of  being made a target by the Greeks or the Turks. I am convinced, too,  that the few who would have seen them, as intelligent travelers, on  their famous rock, would have gained in quality the advantage now  diffused among many, but weakened and almost destroyed by the wrench in  associations, when the ornament is severed from its surface, and the  decoration of a temple exhibited apart from the temple itself. We may  admit, then, that it had been better if Lord Elgin had never taken away  these marbles. Nevertheless, it would be absurd to send them back. But I  do think that the museum on the Acropolis should be provided with a  better set of casts of the figures than those which are now to be seen  there. They look very wretched, and carelessly prepared....          THE THEATER OF DIONYSUS[48]    BY J. P. MAHAFFY      Some ten or twelve years ago, a very extensive and splendidly successful  excavation was made when a party of German archeologists laid bare the  Theater of Dionysus--the great theater in which AEschylus, Sophocles,  and Euripides brought out their immortal plays before an immortal  audience. There is nothing more delightful than to descend from the  Acropolis, and rest awhile in the comfortable marble arm-"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19068"],[0,"Household Stories (#20)"],[1," \"I am emperor, and next  I will be pope! so go and tell the fish so.\"    \"Oh dear!\" said the man, \"what is it that you don't want? You can never  become pope; there is but one pope in Christendom, and the fish can't  possibly do it.\"    \"Husband,\" said she, \"no more words about it; I must and will be pope;  so go along to the fish.\"    \"Now, wife,\" said the man, \"how can I ask him such a thing? it is too  bad--it is asking a little too much; and, besides, he could not do it.\"    \"What rubbish!\" said the wife; \"if he could make me emperor he can make  me pope. Go along and ask him; I am emperor, and you are only my  husband, so go you must.\"    So he went, feeling very frightened, and he shivered and shook, and his  knees trembled; and there arose a great wind, and the clouds flew by,  and it grew very dark, and the sea rose mountains high, and the ships  were tossed about, and the sky was partly blue in the middle, but at the  sides very dark and red, as in a great tempest. And he felt very  desponding, and stood trembling and said,        \"O man, O man!--if man you be,      Or flounder, flounder, in the sea--      Such a tiresome wife I've got,      For she wants what I do not.\"    \"Well, what now?\" said the fish.    \"Oh dear!\" said the man, \"she wants to be pope.\"    \"Go home with you, she is pope already,\" said the fish.    So he went home, and he found himself before a great church, with  palaces all round. He had to make his way through a crowd of people; and  when he got inside he found the place lighted up with thousands and  thousands of lights; and his wife was clothed in a golden garment, and  sat upon a very high throne, and had three golden crowns on, all in the  greatest priestly pomp; and on both sides of her there stood two rows of  lights of all sizes--from the size of the longest tower to the smallest  rushlight, and all the emperors and kings were kneeling before her and  kissing her foot.    \"Well, wife,\" said the man, and sat and stared at her, \"so you are  pope.\"    \"Yes,\" said she, \"now I am pope!\"    And he went on gazing at her till he felt dazzled, as if he were sitting  in the sun. And after a little time he said,    \"Well, now, wife, what is there left to be, now you are pope?\"    And she sat up very stiff and straight, and said nothing.    And he said again, \"Well, wife, I hope you are contented at last with  being pope; you can be nothing more.\"    \"We will see about that,\" said the wife. With that they both went to  bed; but she was as far as ever from being contented, and she could not  get to sleep for thinking of what she should like to be next.    The husband, however, slept as fast as a top after his busy day; but the  wife tossed and turned from side to side the whole night through,  thinking all the while what she could be next, but nothing would occur  to her; and when she saw the red dawn she slipped off the bed, and sat  before the window to see the sun rise, and as it came up she said,    \"Ah, I have it! what if I should make the sun and moon to  rise--husband!\" she cried, and stuck her elbow in his ribs, \"wake up,  and go to your fish, and tell him I want power over the sun and moon.\"    The man was so fast asleep that when he started up he fell out of bed.  Then he shook himself together, and opened his eyes and said,    \"Oh,--wife, what did you say?\"    \"Husband,\" said she, \"if I cannot get the power of making the sun and  moon rise when I want them, I shall never have another quiet hour. Go to  the fish and tell him so.\"    \"O wife!\" said the man, and fell on his knees to her, \"the fish can  really not do that for you. I grant you he could make you emperor and  pope; do be contented with that, I beg of you.\"    And she became wild with impatience, and screamed out,    \"I can wait no longer, go at once!\"    And so off he went as well as he could for fright. And a dreadful storm  arose, so that he could hardly keep his feet; and the houses and trees  were blown down, and the mountains trembled, and rocks fell in the sea;  the sky was quite black, and it thundered and lightened; and the waves,  crowned with foam, ran mountains high. So he cried out, without being  able to hear his own words,        \"O man, O man!--if man you be,      Or flounder, flounder, in the sea--      Such a tiresome wife I've got,      For she wants what I do not.\"    \"Well, what now?\" said the flounder.    \"Oh dear!\" said the man, \"she wants to order about the sun and moon.\"    \"Go home with you!\" said the flounder, \"you will find her in the old  hovel.\"    And there they are sitting to this very day.          THE GALLANT TAILOR      ONE summer morning a little tailor was sitting on his board near the  window, and working cheerfully with all his might, when an old woman  came down the street crying,    \"Good jelly to sell! good jelly to sell!\"    The cry sounded pleasant in the little tailor's ears, so he put his head  out of the window, and called out,    \"Here, my good woman--come here, if you want a customer.\"    So the poor woman climbed the steps with her heavy basket, and was  obliged to unpack and display all her pots to the tailor. He looked at  every one of them, and lifting all the lids, applied his nose to each,  and said at last,    \"The jelly seems pretty good; you may weigh me out four half ounces, or  I don't mind having a quarter of a pound.\"    The woman, who had expected to find a good customer, gave him what he  asked for, but went off angry and grumbling.    \"This jelly is the very thing for me,\" cried the little tailor; \"it will  give me strength and cunning;\" and he took down the bread from the  cupboard, cut a whole round of the loaf, and spread the jelly on it,  laid it near him, and went on stitching more gallantly than ever. All  the while the scent of the sweet jelly was spreading throughout the  room, where there were quantities of flies, who were attracted by it and  flew to partake.    \"Now then, who asked you to come?\" said the tailor, and drove the  unbidden guests away. But the flies, not understanding his language,  were not to be got rid of like that, and returned in larger numbers than  before. Then the tailor, not being able to stand it any longer, took  from his chimney-corner a ragged cloth, and saying,    \"Now, I'll let you have it!\" beat it among them unmercifully. When he  ceased, and counted the slain, he found seven lying dead before him.    \"This is indeed somewhat,\" he said, wondering at his own gallantry; \"the  whole town shall know this.\"    So he hastened to cut out a belt, and he stitched it, and put on it in  large capitals \"Seven at one blow!\"    \"--The town, did I say!\" said the little tailor; \"the whole world shall  know it!\" And his heart quivered with joy, like a lamb's tail.    The tailor fastened the belt round him, and began to think of going out  into the world, for his workshop seemed too small for his worship. So he  looked about in all the house for something that it would be useful to  take with him, but he found nothing but an old cheese, which he put in  his pocket. Outside the door he noticed that a bird had got caught in  the bushes, so he took that and put it in his pocket with the cheese.  Then he set out gallantly on his way, and as he was light and active he  felt no fatigue. The way led over a mountain, and when he reached the  topmost peak he saw a terrible giant sitting there, and looking about  him at his ease. The tailor went bravely up to him, called out to him,  and said,    \"Comrade, good day! there you sit looking over the wide world! I am on  the way thither to seek my fortune: have you a fancy to go with me?\"    The giant looked at the tailor contemptuously, and said,    \"You little rascal! you miserable fellow!\"    \"That may be!\" answered the little tailor, and undoing his coat he  showed the giant his belt; \"you can read there whether I am a man or  not!\"    The giant read: \"Seven at one blow!\" and thinking it meant men that the  tailor had killed, felt at once more respect for the little fellow. But  as he wanted to prove him, he took up a stone and squeezed it so hard  that water came out of it.    \"Now you can do that,\" said the giant,--\"that is, if you have the  strength for it.\"    \"That's not much,\" said the little tailor, \"I call that play,\" and he  put his hand in his pocket and took out the cheese and squeezed it, so  that the whey ran out of it.    \"Well,\" said he, \"what do you think of that?\"    The giant did not know what to say to it, for he could not have believed  it of the little man. Then the giant took up a stone and threw it so  high that it was nearly out of sight.    \"Now, little fellow, suppose you do that!\"    \"Well thrown,\" said the tailor; \"but the stone fell back to earth  again,--I will throw you one that will never come back.\" So he felt in  his pocket, took out the bird, and threw it into the air. And the bird,  when it found itself at liberty, took wing, flew off, and returned no  more.    \"What do you think of that, comrade?\" asked the tailor.    \"There is no doubt that you can throw,\" said the giant; \"but we will see  if you can carry.\"    He led the little tailor to a mighty oak-tree which had been felled, and  was lying on the ground, and said,    \"Now, if you are strong enough, help me to carry this tree out of the  wood.\"    \"Willingly,\" answered the little man; \"you take the trunk on your  shoulders, I will take the branches with all their foliage, that is much  the most difficult.\"    So the giant took the trunk on his shoulders, and the tailor seated  himself on a branch, and the giant, who could not see what he was doing,  had the whole tree to carry, and the little man on it as well. And the  little man was very cheerful and merry, and whistled the tune: \"_There  were three tailors riding by_,\" as if carrying the tree was mere child's  play. The giant, when he had struggled on under his heavy load a part of  the way, was tired out, and cried,    \"Look here, I must let "]]]
