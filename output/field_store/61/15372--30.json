It is doubtful if ever a boy  worked as hard or as anxiously as did Theo during the next two  weeks. And as his creation took form how happy he was! He cut the  three shelves, shaped the ends of the rack, and under his teacher's  direction carved on a jig-saw the simple ornament which was to  decorate the top. Never in his whole life had he enjoyed making  anything so much. Then came the day when the final coat of oil was  applied and there was nothing more to do but wait until it dried. But  the work had required more time than Theo had anticipated, and  therefore it was not until the very afternoon before Mr. Croyden's  birthday that the shelves were dry enough to be packed. Dr. Swift's  motor came to the school that day to get Theo, and the boy himself  proudly carried his masterpiece out to the car and put it inside; then  springing in he called to the chauffeur to drive home. Arriving at his  own abode Theo leaped up the brown stone steps with quick stride and  rang the bell; then as he stood waiting for the door to be opened a  sudden recollection overwhelmed him. In his eagerness to display his  handiwork to his parents he had entirely forgotten his crutches! They  were at school, and he now remembered he had not used them since  morning.    His father laughed heartily when Theo told him this.    \"I guess that means you can do without crutches from now on, son,\" the  Doctor said.    \"Does it mean that I may go to the Croydens', Dad?\"    \"I should say so,\" was the ready response. \"I will call Mr. Croyden up  on the telephone and find out when he wants you to come. What a joke  it would be if you should go to Trenton and carry your bookrack with  you!\"    It subsequently proved that there was more truth than fiction in this  jest, for in answer to Dr. Swift's inquiry Mr. Croyden announced that  he happened to be coming into New York that very day in his car, and  if the Swifts were willing he would carry Theo back with him.    \"That will be the very thing!\" exclaimed the boy in delight. \"We can  do the shelves all up so he won't guess what they are, and I can take  them right along. Then they will be safe at Mr. Croyden's house and I  shall not run the risk of the expressman being late. You know  expressmen always are late. Think how long they were getting my  crutches to Maine.\"    Accordingly the shelves were packed with greatest care in many soft  papers so they would not be scratched, and afterward they were wrapped  in a stouter outside covering. When the parcel was tied up no one  would have suspected what was inside, and Theo viewed the mysterious  bundle with satisfaction.    \"Mr. Croyden will think that for a small boy you travel with a good  deal of luggage,\" chuckled the Doctor.    \"Maybe he won't have room to take it,\" Mrs. Swift rejoined.    Theo's face fell.    \"He must take it,\" he said, \"even if I walk to Trenton myself.\"    But there was room, plenty of it, in the big touring car.    Mr. Croyden did, to be sure, comment teasingly about the lad's  extended wardrobe, and ask how many dozen suits of clothes he had  brought with him; but he made no objection to taking either the bundle  or the suit-case.    And when that night just before dinner Theo slipped into the  dining-room and placed the shelves beside Mr. Croyden's chair no boy  could have been happier. The only person happier than Theo himself was  the man who received them.    \"My, but this is a present!\" exclaimed the merchant. \"And you made  them all yourself? I can hardly believe it. Why, they are beautifully  finished! And isn't it a queer thing that only yesterday I told  Mrs. Croyden I must buy some bookshelves for my office? You remember,  don't you, Madeline?\"    Mrs. Croyden nodded.    \"Those were his very words,\" affirmed Mrs. Croyden, turning to  Theo. \"He said it only at breakfast. I believe it was mental  telepathy, Theo.\"    [Illustration: \"THIS IS A PRESENT\"]    Theo beamed.    He had really succeeded then in giving Mr. Croyden something he  wanted! That was pleasure enough.          [Illustration]          CHAPTER XIII    THE TRENTON VISIT      [Illustration: A]    Although originally planned to be of only a week's duration, Theo's  visit to the Croydens stretched on into the second week before any one  seemed to realize it. Ten days passed and still the lad had not been  to the porcelain works--one of his chief aims in coming to  Trenton. Each morning at breakfast Mrs. Croyden presented so many  delightful plans for the day, and was so eager to have Theo accompany  her to the golf club, the tennis club, or for a motor ride, that the  hours sped by and night came only too soon.    For Mrs. Croyden was a marvelous comrade for a boy, a strange mixture  of youthfulness and maturity; of feminine charm and masculine freedom  from conventionality. She loved boys and understood how to be one with  them, and in consequence the friendship that at first had extended  only to Mr. Croyden Theo now stretched to include her. Nor did the  stretching demand effort. Who could have resisted the sweet wholesome  interest of this fascinating woman with her soft brown eyes, her quick  sympathy, and her girlish love of sport?    As the days fled by a tie of real affection strengthened between them,  and Theo found himself talking with an amazing freedom of his dreams  and ambitions; of his chums; and of his life at home. To all these  things Mrs. Croyden listened earnestly, now and then putting in a word  of interest or encouragement. Sometimes in the evening Mr. Croyden  joined in these talks; and sometimes all three of them abandoned life  and its problems and went to the theatre, or to a moving picture show.    \"I declare, Theo, I don't know how we are to do without you when you  go back home,\" exclaimed Mr. Croyden one night at dinner. \"It will  leave a big hole in the house, won't it, Madeline?\"    Mrs. Croyden nodded and a shadow passed across her face.    \"I wish we might borrow Theo for a long, long time,\" she sighed  wistfully. \"But I suppose your family would not listen to that,  laddie.\"    \"I'm afraid not,\" Theo answered. \"Mother seems to be getting a little  impatient as it is. She thinks I've been gone a pretty long time.\"    \"Long? Nonsense! Why, you've only just come,\" Mr. Croyden said  emphatically. \"Up to now you have been visiting Mrs. Croyden. You  haven't been my guest at all. Haven't we got the porcelain works ahead  of us? That will take the best part of another week.\"    \"Then I am afraid I'd better be getting at it,\" laughed Theo, \"for  Mother writes we're to leave for Lake George the middle of July.\"    \"Mercy on us!\" blustered Mr. Croyden. \"I don't see how you can. The  middle of July? That settles it. There must be no more kidnapping  Theo for golf or tennis, Madeline. From now on he is to be my  guest. Understand that.\"    Mrs. Croyden bowed her head with amusing meekness.    \"It shall be as you say, my lord,\" she answered. \"But are you  expecting to take Theo to the factory every moment of every day?\"    \"I don't know,\" was the grim reply. \"That will all depend on how  rapidly he learns the business.\"    There was a general laugh.    \"How long has it taken you to learn it, Mr. Croyden?\" questioned Theo  mischievously.    \"Me? Oh, about thirty years.\"    \"Then at that rate I see I shall not get to Lake George this season,\"  returned the boy with a smile.    \"Oh, I'll be easy with you this first time,\" Mr. Croyden answered. \"I  cannot afford to kill you or get you frightened, or you never will  come again.\"    \"I guess you needn't worry about my not coming again,\" Theo  retorted. \"I have had far too good a time.\"    \"I am glad of that,\" the elder man asserted heartily.    \"And I, too, Theo,\" murmured Mrs. Croyden. \"Do not forget that you  have given us far more pleasure than you could possibly have received.  Mr. Croyden and I are often very lonely for a son like you. It has  been a boon to have you here. That is why you must not let this  ambitious husband of mine tire you all out by setting you too  strenuously at porcelain-making,\" she added playfully. \"Is it  to-morrow that you plan to drag Theo forth on this crusade to the  factory, my dear?\"    Mr. Croyden glanced up at the words.    \"Yes, to-morrow morning. I shall take Theo down to the works with me  directly after breakfast,\" he answered. \"You better get to bed early  to-night, son, so to be prepared for the worst.\"    \"I shan't waste any worry about the trip,\" grinned Theo as they rose  from the dinner table.    It was a warm night, and the three strolled out on the veranda, which  overlooked the green of the country club.    \"I suppose,\" Theo remarked, \"nobody has any idea when pottery and  porcelain were first made in America.\"    \"Barring out the pottery of the Mound Builders, the American Indians,  and the early clay work done in West Virginia I imagine our modern  china was first introduced into America at Philadelphia,\" Mr. Croyden  said. \"At least records would indicate that to be the case. Between  1760 and 1770 potteries sprung up there and thrived so lustily that  Wedgwood noted their success and urged the English government to check  them lest they injure English trade. At these Philadelphia factories  hard porcelain with a good quality of glaze was turned out; also much  blue and white stone-china in the form of jars, butter-pots, bowls,  and plates. Some mortars and pestles such as Wedgwood himself made  were also manufactured, so what wonder that he was disturbed at the  thought of losing the monopoly? In a letter to a friend he speaks of  pottery being made in the Carolinas as well, and declares it would be  a great calamity were the colonies to begin making their own dishes.\"    \"The idea!\" burst out Theo.    \"It was business,\" replied Mr. Croyden. \"Of course England would far  rather ship her wares to America and collect the revenue than to have  the colonists learn to do without her."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19449"],[0,"The North American Indian, Vol. 1 (#20)"],[1,"of peace and friendship with this  marauding tribe; but this treaty, like several others that followed, was  soon broken, and the raids continued as before. In 1858 the troubles  arising from the plunderings became especially severe and led to several  other expeditions, but with little result. The problem became a serious  one in 1861, when the Civil War necessitated the withdrawal of troops from  the frontier, leaving the way open to the devastation of the country by  the Navaho and Mescaleros, until General Carleton, who assumed command of  the military forces in New Mexico in 1862, formulated a policy to  thoroughly subdue the Navaho and to transfer them to the Bosque Redondo,  on the Rio Pecos in New Mexico, where Fort Sumner had been established,  and there hold them as prisoners of war until some other plan could be  devised. His plan was successfully carried out. By the spring of 1863 four  hundred Mescaleros were under guard on the new reservation, and by the  close of that year about two hundred Navaho prisoners had either been  transferred thither or were on the way. Early in 1864 Col. Kit Carson led  his volunteers to the Canon de Chelly, the Navaho stronghold, where in a  fight he succeeded in killing twenty-three, capturing thirty-four, and  compelling two hundred to surrender. The backbone of the hostility was now  broken, and before the beginning of 1865 about seven thousand, later  increased to 8491, were under military control within the new reservation.  But the Bosque Redondo proved unhealthful and disappointing as a  reservation, while its maintenance was costly to the Government. A treaty  was therefore made with the Navaho in 1868, one of the provisions of which  was the purchase of fifteen thousand sheep to replenish their exterminated  flocks. In July 7304 Navaho, the remainder having died or escaped, arrived  at Fort Wingate on the way to their old home, where they have since lived  in peace and prosperity.          MYTHOLOGY - CREATION MYTH      In the world below(5) there was no sun and no moon, and therefore no  light, yet vegetation in innumerable forms and the animal people thrived.  Among the latter were Gray Wolf people, Nakletso; Mountain Lion,  Nashtuitso; Badger, Naaschi{~COMBINING BREVE~}d; Locust, Woneschidi; Pine Squirrel,  Klozeslskai and Klozeslzhi{~COMBINING BREVE~}ni; Blue Fox, Mai-Dotli{~COMBINING BREVE~}shi; Yellow Fox,  Mai-Iltsoi; Owl, Nascha; Crow, Gage; Buzzard, Jesho; four different  varieties of the Hawk people, and many others.                        [Illustration: Navaho Still Life]                                Navaho Still Life                 _From Copyright Photograph 1907 by E.S. Curtis_      Their world was small. At its eastern rim stood a large white mountain,  and at the south a blue one. These formed the home of Astse Hastin, First  Man. A yellow mountain in the west and a black one in the north harbored  Astse Estsan, First Woman.(6) Near the mountain in the east a large river  had its source and flowed toward the south. Along its western bank the  people lived in peace and plenty. There was game in abundance, much corn,  and many edible fruits and nuts. All were happy. The younger women ground  corn while the boys sang songs and played on flutes of the sunflower  stalk. The men and the women had each eight chiefs, four living toward  each cardinal point; the chiefs of the men lived in the east and south,  those of the women in the west and north. The chiefs of the east took  precedence over those of the south, as did those of the west over those of  the north.    One day, led by their eight brave chiefs, all the men went off on a hunt.  It occurred to the head-chief when they had been gone but a short time  that the women should have been instructed to clean the camp thoroughly  and bake a quantity of bread while all the men were away; so he despatched  the youngest of the four chiefs of the south to the camp to make known his  wishes, but instead of doing as bidden, the young chief visited with the  head-chief's wife. The hunters were gone four days, at the end of which  time they returned with much game, weary and very hungry. To their  surprise they found the camp in a very unkempt condition and no bread  baked in anticipation of their return. The messenger was called before the  head-chief at once and questioned as to the directions he had given the  women. He explained that he had told the chief of the women what they were  expected to do, but she refused to listen to him, and he was powerless to  do more. Then the head-chief went to his wife and demanded to know why she  had refused to issue his orders to the women. She curtly replied that that  was her business and not his; as it was, the women did more work than the  men, for they tilled the fields, made the clothing, cared for the  children, and did the cooking, while the men did practically nothing, so  if they chose to spend a few days in idleness, it was nothing more than  they had a right to do and no one's concern but their own. The chief  became angry, and during a quarrel that ensued he was told that he and all  his followers might leave if they would, for the women could get along  better without them.    Remonstrance and reasoning availed nothing; the chief of the women grew  more vehement as she argued, so the head-chief determined to put the women  to the test. The following morning he issued orders that all the men in  camp prepare to depart, for the women had declared they could live better  independently of them and were to be given an opportunity to do so.    Having decided to cross the great river flowing from the east, work at  once began on four large cottonwood rafts to be used as ferries. Four days  it took to put all in readiness, and at dawn of the fifth day the crossing  of the stream began. Orders were issued that all food supplies, clothing,  and utensils be left with the women, save enough seed corn to plant crops  the next spring, and no males, infant or aged, were to be left behind.  Four _nu{~COMBINING BREVE~}tli_ (hermaphrodites) objected strongly at being taken from the  women, but were forced to join the men, as they were needed to care for  the babies. Four old cripples, too weak to move, were left behind, but  other than these not a male inhabitant remained in the old village at the  end of four days. After all had crossed the river, the rafts were fastened  securely to the bank in order that the women might not get them and  follow.                       [Illustration: Navaho Medicine-man]                               Navaho Medicine-man                 _From Copyright Photograph 1904 by E.S. Curtis_      As soon as the men had landed they began to work with zeal, for houses had  to be built, game caught, skins tanned, and land prepared for crops. They  suffered much from scarcity of food and clothing the first winter, but  managed to exist. The women, however, had bountiful crops, and all through  the late fall and winter could be heard revelling in great delight,  feasting daily and dancing much of the time to the music of songs sung by  the four old cripples. The following autumn found the men in much better  circumstances, for they had grown small crops; but the women were less  fortunate. Having none but themselves to work and provide for, they had  become negligent from the beginning, dissipating the contents of their  granaries and allowing their fields to grow fallow. By the end of the  second year clothing had become very scarce, and not knowing how to hunt,  they had no way to obtain more skins. The men, on the contrary, had grown  more prosperous; their well-tended farms yielded an ample supply of corn  for the winter, and the pelts of deer and antelope furnished a deal of  warm clothing and bedding. The third year found the men living in ease and  comfort, while the women had become reduced to absolute want, many having  fallen ill from self-neglect. They called across to the men, pleading to  be taken over and promising faithful allegiance, but the chief was  resolute and refused to forget how he had been wronged.    Then it was that the youngest of the eight ruling men, in a moment of  compassion, confessed his guilt, admitting in a plea to the head-chief for  clemency that he was in fact responsible for the attitude his wife had  taken. This served only to renew the old chief's anger; he stoutly refused  to listen to further appeals and expressed his regret that the first seeds  of wrong should have been thus sown. No longer able to keep up the fight,  with starvation staring them in the face, and being in nakedness, at the  end of the fourth year the women attempted to swim the river in parties,  but the attempts resulted only in death, for the swift current would have  been too much even for the strongest men to buffet. Seeing this  self-sacrifice and realizing that the race would be ultimately  exterminated if the women continued it much longer, appeals were made  daily to the head-chief to permit the rescue of the remainder. Four times  was he sought to grant such permission before he consented, then at dawn  of the fifth morning he gave directions to loose the rafts and ferry the  women over. A miserable remnant they were, unclad, wan, and wasted; but a  return to the old habits of life soon restored them to their former  selves, and peace, happiness, and prosperity reigned again.    The broad river that flowed from the east had its source in two very large  springs, a he-spring and a she-spring, in which lived two large Water  Monsters. These had a pair of youngsters who delighted in emerging from  the depths of the spring and swimming out across the meadows in the  shallow water where there was neither current nor river banks. Coyote  spied them one day, and being ever a meddler and trouble-maker--though  withal a fellow of polished mien--stole them, putting the two under the  folds of his jacket.    Now there was no sun,"]]]
