She and her  satellites are sitting away up on the back seat of the gallery.\"    \"Where?\" asked Nora, going to the door. \"Oh, yes, I see her. She looks  as haughty as ever. It's a wonder she'd condescend to come and watch her  mortal enemies play.\"    \"I suppose she hopes we'll lose,\" said Marian Barber. \"That would fill  her with joy.\"    \"Then we'll see that she goes away in a gloomy frame of mind,\" said  Nora, \"for we're going to win, and don't you forget to remember it.\"    Just then the whistle blew, and there was a scramble for places. This  time Julia Crosby won the toss-up, and followed it up with a field goal.  Then the seniors scored twice on fouls, tying the score. The juniors  set their teeth and waded in with all their might and main, setting a  whirlwind pace that caused their fans to shout with wild enthusiasm and  fairly dazed their opponents. Grace alone netted four foul goals, and  the sensational playing of Nora and Miriam was a matter of wonder to the  spectators, who conceded it to be the fastest, most brilliant half ever  played by an Oakdale team. The game ended with the score 15 to 6 in  favor of the juniors, whose loyal supporters swooped down upon them the  moment the whistle blew and pranced about, whooping like savages.    \"That was the greatest game I ever saw played under this roof,\" cried  David, wringing Grace's hand, while Hippy hopped about, uttering little  yelps of joy. Reddy circled about the victors almost too delighted for  words. He was filled with profound admiration for them.    \"The boys' crack team couldn't have played a better game,\" he said  solemnly, and the girls knew that he could pay them no higher  compliment, for this team was considered invincible by the High School  boys.    \"Perhaps we'll challenge you some day, Reddy,\" said Grace mischievously.    \"I believe you'd win at that,\" he said so earnestly that every one  laughed.    \"It was a great triumph,\" said Jessica proudly, as she stood with Mabel  and Anne in the locker-room while the girls resumed street clothing.  \"And my new howl was a success, too.\"    \"Glad to know that,\" said Grace. \"There were so many different kinds of  noises I couldn't distinguish it.\"    \"There was one noise that started that was promptly hushed,\" said Anne.  \"You heard it, too, didn't you Jessica?\"    \"Oh, yes, girls, I intended telling you before this,\" replied Jessica.  \"Just before the last half started, Miss Thompson and Miss Kane came in  and walked to the other end of the gallery. Well, Eleanor and her crowd  saw them, and what do you suppose they did?\"    \"Hard to tell,\" said Nora.    \"They hissed Miss Thompson. Very softly, you may be sure,\" continued  Jessica, \"but it was hissing, just the same. For a wonder, she didn't  hear it, but every girl in the junior class did. They were sitting down  front on the same side as Eleanor's crowd. You know what a temper Ruth  Deane has and how ferocious she can look? Well, the minute she heard it  she went back there like a flash, looking for all the world like a  thunder cloud. She talked for a moment to Edna and Eleanor. They tossed  their heads, but they didn't hiss any more.\"    \"What did Ruth say to them?\" asked Grace curiously. \"It must have been  something remarkable, or they wouldn't have subsided so suddenly.\"    \"It was,\" giggled Jessica. \"She told them that if they didn't stop it  instantly, the juniors would pick them up bodily, carry them downstairs  to the classroom and lock them in until the game was over.\"    \"How absurd!\" exclaimed Grace. \"They would never have dared to go that  far.\"    \"I don't know about that,\" said Nora O'Malley. \"Ruth Deane is a terror  when she gets fairly started. Besides, she would have had both High  Schools on her side. Even the boys like Miss Thompson.\"    \"It was an effectual threat at any rate,\" said Jessica. \"They left  before the game was over. Perhaps they were afraid of being waylaid.\"    \"I suppose they couldn't bear to see us win,\" said Grace. \"But,  O girls, I am so proud of our invincible team. It was a great game  and a well-earned victory.\"    \"We ought to celebrate,\" said Miriam. \"Come on. Here we are at  Stillman's.\"    Without waiting for a second invitation, the Phi Sigma Tau trooped  joyfully into the drug store.          CHAPTER XVII    THE LAST STRAW      The days glided by rapidly. The Christmas holidays came, bringing with  them the usual round of gayeties. Thanks to the Phi Sigma Tau, the  lonely element of High School girls did not lack for good cheer. As at  Thanksgiving, each member of the sorority entertained two or more girls  on Christmas and New Year's, and were amply repaid for their good deed  by the warm appreciation of their guests.    Tom Gray came down for the holidays, bringing with him his roommate,  Arnold Evans, a fair-haired, blue-eyed young man of twenty, who proved  himself thoroughly likable in every respect. He lost no time in  cultivating Miriam's acquaintance, and the two soon became firm friends.    Tom gave a dinner to his roommate, inviting \"the seven originals,\" as he  expressed it, and Miriam, who felt that at last she really belonged in  the charmed circle. David was even more pleased than his sister over the  turn affairs had taken. To have Miriam a member of his own particular  \"crowd\" had always been David's dearest wish, and the advent of Arnold  Evans had done away with Miriam being the odd one. So the circle was  enlarged to ten young people, who managed to crowd the two weeks'  vacation with all sorts of healthful pleasures.    There were coasting and sleighing parties, and on one occasion a walk to  old Jean's hut in Upton Wood, where they were hospitably entertained by  the old hunter, who had smilingly pointed to the wolf skins on the wall,  asking them if they remembered the winter day two years before when  those same skins held wolves who were far too lively for comfort. Then  the story of their escape had to be gone over again for Arnold's  benefit.    They had stayed until the moon came up, and, accompanied by the old  hunter, had walked back to Oakdale in the moonlight.    After the holidays came the brief period of hard study before the  dreaded mid-year examinations. Basketball enthusiasm declined rapidly  and a remarkable devotion to study ensued that lasted until examinations  began. By the last week in January, the ordeal was past.    Eleanor Savell had not yet returned to school. Whether or not she would  be allowed to return was a question that occasioned a great deal of  discussion among three lower classes of girls. Edna Wright and the other  members of the sorority organized by Eleanor were loud in their  expressions of disapproval as to Miss Thompson's \"severity\" toward  Eleanor. They talked so freely about it, that it reached the principal's  ears. She lost no time in sending for them, and after a session in the  office, they emerged looking subdued and crestfallen; and after that it  was noted that when in conversation with their schoolmates, they made no  further allusion to Miss Thompson's methods of discipline.    There was a faint murmur of surprise around the study hall one  morning, however, when Miss Thompson walked in to conduct the opening  exercises, accompanied by Eleanor, who, without looking at the school,  seated herself at the desk nearest to where the principal stood.    When the morning exercises were concluded, Miss Thompson nodded slightly  to Eleanor, who turned rather pale, then rose, and, facing the school,  said in a clear voice:    \"I wish to apologize to Miss Thompson for impertinence and  insubordination. I also wish to publicly apologize to the members of the  Phi Sigma Tau for having accused them of treachery concerning a certain  matter that recently came up in this school.\"    \"Your apology is accepted, Miss Savell. You may take your own seat,\"  said the principal.    Without looking to the right or left, Eleanor walked proudly up the  aisle to her seat, followed by the gaze of those girls who could not  refrain from watching her. The Phi Sigma Tau, to a member, sat with eyes  straight to the front. They had no desire to increase Eleanor's  discomfiture, for they realized what this public apology must have cost  her, although they were all equally puzzled as to what had prompted her  to humble herself.    Eleanor's apology was not due, however, to a change of heart. She still  despised Miss Thompson as thoroughly as on the day that she had  manifested her open scorn and dislike for the principal.    As for Grace and her friends, Eleanor was particularly bitter against  them, and laid at their door a charge of which they were entirely  innocent.    Eleanor had told her aunt nothing of her recent trouble in school, but  had feigned illness as an excuse for remaining at home. After attending  the basketball game her aunt had told her rather sharply that if she  were able to attend basketball games, she was certainly able to continue  her studies. Eleanor had agreed to return to school the following  Monday, and had started from home at the usual time with no intention  whatever of honoring the High School with her presence. She passed the  morning in the various stores, lunched in town and went to a matinee in  the afternoon. In this manner she idled the days away until the holiday  vacation came, congratulating herself upon her success in pulling wool  over the eyes of her long-suffering aunt.    But a day of reckoning was at hand, for just before the close of  vacation Miss Thompson chanced to call at Mrs. Gray's home while Mrs.  Gray was entertaining Miss Nevin, and the truth came out.    When Miss Nevin confronted her niece with the deception Eleanor had  practised upon her, a stormy scene had followed, and Eleanor had accused  Grace Harlowe of telling "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17860"],[0,"Stories from Hans Andersen (#20)"],[1,"discover the best of  everything, the red, red gold!    'This was why his chimney flamed and smoked and sparkled. Yes, I was  there, too,' said the wind.    [Illustration: _I used to meet her in the garden, the ravine, and in  the manor fields. She was always picking flowers and herbs, those she  knew her father could use for healing drinks and potions._]    'Away with you, away! I sang in the back of the chimney. Smoke smoke,  embers and ashes, that is all it will come to! You will burn yourself up  in it. Whew! whew! away with it! But Waldemar Daa could not let it go.    'The fiery steeds in the stable, where were they? The old gold and  silver plate in cupboard and chest, where was that? The cattle, the  land, the castle itself? Yes, they could all be melted down in the  crucible, but yet no gold would come.    'Barn and larder got emptier and emptier. Fewer servants; more mice. One  pane of glass got broken and another followed it. There was no need for  me to go in by the doors,' said the wind. 'A smoking chimney means a  cooking meal, but the only chimney which smoked here swallowed up all  the meals, all for the sake of the red gold.    'I blew through the castle gate like a watchman blowing his horn, but  there was no watchman,' said the wind. 'I twisted round the weather-cock  on the tower and it creaked as if the watchman up there was snoring,  only there was no watchman. Rats and mice were the only inhabitants.  Poverty laid the table; poverty lurked in wardrobe and larder. The doors  fell off their hinges, cracks and crannies appeared everywhere; I went  in and out,' said the wind, 'so I know all about it.    'The hair and the beard of Waldemar Daa grew grey, in the sorrow of his  sleepless nights, amid smoke and ashes. His skin grew grimy and yellow,  and his eyes greedy for gold, the long expected gold.    'I whistled through the broken panes and fissures; I blew into the  daughters' chests where their clothes lay faded and threadbare; they had  to last for ever. A song like this had never been sung over the cradles  of these children. A lordly life became a woeful life! I was the only  one to sing in the castle now,' said the wind. 'I snowed them up, for  they said it gave warmth. They had no firewood, for the forest was cut  down where they should have got it. There was a biting frost. Even I had  to keep rushing through the crannies and passages to keep myself lively.  They stayed in bed to keep themselves warm, those noble ladies. Their  father crept about under a fur rug. Nothing to bite, and nothing to  burn! a lordly life indeed! Whew! whew! let it go! But this was what  Waldemar Daa could not do.    '\"After winter comes the spring,\" said he; \"a good time will come after  a time of need; but they make us wait their pleasure, wait! The castle  is mortgaged, we are in extremities--and yet the gold will come--at  Easter!\"    'I heard him murmur to the spider's web.--\"You clever little weaver! You  teach me to persevere! If your web is broken, you begin at the beginning  again and complete it! Broken again--and cheerfully you begin it over  again. That is what one must do, and one will be rewarded!\"    'It was Easter morning, the bells were ringing, and the sun was at play  in the heavens. Waldemar Daa had watched through the night with his  blood at fever pitch; boiling and cooling, mixing and distilling. I  heard him sigh like a despairing soul; I heard him pray, and I felt that  he held his breath. The lamp had gone out, but he never noticed it; I  blew up the embers and they shone upon his ashen face, which took a  tinge of colour from their light; his eyes started in their sockets,  they grew larger and larger, as if they would leap out.    'Look at the alchemist's glass! something twinkles in it; it is glowing,  pure and heavy. He lifted it with a trembling hand and shouted with a  trembling voice: \"Gold! gold!\" He reeled, and I could easily have blown  him over,' said the wind, 'but I only blew upon the embers, and followed  him to the room where his daughters sat shivering. His coat was powdered  with ash, as well as his beard and his matted hair. He drew himself up  to his full height and held up his precious treasure, in the fragile  glass: \"Found! won! gold!\" he cried, stretching up his hand with the  glass which glittered in the sunbeams: his hand shook, and the  alchemist's glass fell to the ground shivered into a thousand atoms. The  last bubble of his welfare was shattered too. Whew! whew! fare away! and  away I rushed from the goldmaker's home.    [Illustration: _He lifted it with a trembling hand and shouted with a  trembling voice: 'Gold! gold!'_]    'Late in the year, when the days were short and dark up here, and the  fog envelops the red berries and bare branches with its cold moisture,  I came along in a lively mood clearing the sky and snapping off the dead  boughs. This is no great labour, it is true, yet it has to be done.  Borreby Hall, the home of Waldemar Daa, was having a clean sweep of a  different sort. The family enemy, Ove Ramel from Basness, appeared,  holding the mortgage of the Hall and all its contents. I drummed upon  the cracked window panes, beat against the decaying doors, and whistled  through all the cracks and crannies, whew! I did my best to prevent Herr  Ove taking a fancy to stay there. Ida and Anna Dorothea faced it  bravely, although they shed some tears; Johanna stood pale and erect and  bit her finger till it bled! Much that would help her! Ove Ramel offered  to let them stay on at the Castle for Waldemar Daa's lifetime, but he  got no thanks for his offer; I was listening. I saw the ruined gentleman  stiffen his neck and hold his head higher than ever. I beat against the  walls and the old linden trees with such force that the thickest branch  broke, although it was not a bit rotten. It fell across the gate like a  broom, as if some one was about to sweep; and a sweeping there was  indeed to be. I quite expected it. It was a grievous day and a hard time  for them, but their wills were as stubborn as their necks were stiff.  They had not a possession in the world but the clothes on their backs;  yes, one thing--an alchemist's glass which had been bought and filled  with the fragments scraped up from the floor. The treasure which  promised much and fulfilled nothing. Waldemar Daa hid it in his  bosom, took his staff in his hand, and, with his three daughters, the  once wealthy gentleman walked out of Borreby Hall for the last time. I  blew a cold blast upon his burning cheeks, I fluttered his grey beard  and his long white hair; I sang such a tune as only I could sing. Whew!  whew! away with them! away with them! This was the end of all their  grandeur.    'Ida and Ana Dorothea walked one on each side of him: Johanna turned  round in the gateway, but what was the good of that? nothing could make  their luck turn. She looked at the red stones of what had once been  Marsk Stig's Castle. Was she thinking of his daughters?        '\"The elder took the younger by the hand,      And out they roamed to a far-off land.\"    Was she thinking of that song? Here there were three and their father  was with them. They walked along the road where once they used to ride  in their chariot. They trod it now as vagrants, on their way to a  plastered cottage on Smidstrup Heath, which was rented at ten marks  yearly. This was their new country seat with its empty walls and its  empty vessels. The crows and the magpies wheeled screaming over their  heads with their mocking \"Caw, caw! Out of the nest, Caw, caw!\" just as  they screamed in Borreby Forest when the trees were felled.    'Herr Daa and his daughters must have noticed it. I blew into their  ears to try and deaden the cries, which after all were not worth  listening to.    'So they took up their abode in the plastered cottage on Smidstrup  Heath, and I tore off over marshes and meadows, through naked hedges and  bare woods, to the open seas and other lands. Whew! whew! away, away!  and that for many years.'    What happened to Waldemar Daa? What happened to his daughters? This is  what the wind relates.    'The last of them I saw, yes, for the last time, was Anna Dorothea, the  pale hyacinth. She was old and bent now; it was half a century later.  She lived the longest, she had gone through everything.    'Across the heath, near the town of Viborg, stood the Dean's new,  handsome mansion, built of red stone with toothed gables. The smoke  curled thickly out of the chimneys. The gentle lady and her fair  daughters sat in the bay window looking into the garden at the drooping  thorns and out to the brown heath beyond. What were they looking at  there? They were looking at a stork's nest on a tumble-down cottage; the  roof was covered, as far as there was any roof to cover, with moss and  house-leek; but the stork's nest made the best covering. It was the only  part to which anything was done, for the stork kept it in repair.    [Illustration: _Waldemar Daa hid it in his bosom, took his staff in his  hand, and, with his three daughters, the once wealthy gentleman walked  out of Borreby Hall for the last time._]    'This house was only fit to be looked at, not to be touched. I had to  mind what I was about,' said the wind. 'The cottage was allowed to  stand for the sake of the stork's nest; in itself it was only a  scarecrow on the heath, but the dean did not want to frighten away the  stork, so the hovel was allowed to stand. The poor soul inside was  allowed to live in it; she had the Egyptian bird to thank for that; or  was it payment for once having pleaded for the nest of his wild black  brother in the Borreby Forest? Then, poor thing, she was a child, a  delicate, pale hyacinth in a noble flower-garden. Poor Anna Dorothea;  she remembered it all! Ah, human beings can sigh as well as the wind  when it soughs through the rushes and reeds.    'Oh dear! oh dear! No bells rang over the grave of Waldemar Daa. "]]]
