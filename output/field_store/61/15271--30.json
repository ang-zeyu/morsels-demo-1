Yet shall he not make a full end  of thee, for all his desire. But do even as I tell thee,  and methinks thou art not witless. Cast off these garments,  and leave the raft to drift before the winds, but do thou  swim with thine hands and strive to win a footing on the  coast {*} of the Phaeacians, where it is decreed that thou  escape. Here, take this veil imperishable and wind it about  thy breast; so is there no fear that thou suffer aught or  perish. But when thou hast laid hold of the mainland with  thy hands, loose it from off thee and cast it into the  wine-dark deep far from the land, and thyself turn away.'    {* Lit. Strive after an arrival on the land, etc. [Greek]  originally meant going, journeying, and had no idea of  return. The earlier use survives here, and in Soph.  Philoct. 43, Eur. Iph. Aul. 1261. Similarly, perhaps,  [Greek] in Odyssey iv.619, xv.119, and [Greek] frequently}    With that the goddess gave the veil, and for her part dived  back into the heaving deep, like a sea-gull: and the dark  wave closed over her. But the steadfast goodly Odysseus  pondered, and heavily he spake to his own brave spirit:    'Ah, woe is me! Can it be that some one of the immortals is  weaving a new snare for me, that she bids me quit my raft?  Nay verily, I will not yet obey, for I had sight of the  shore yet a long way off, where she told me that I might  escape. I am resolved what I will do;--and methinks on this  wise it is best. So long as the timbers abide in the  dowels, so long will I endure steadfast in affliction, but  so soon as the wave hath shattered my raft asunder, I will  swim, for meanwhile no better counsel may be.'    While yet he pondered these things in his heart and soul,  Poseidon, shaker of the earth, stirred against him a great  wave, terrible and grievous, and vaulted from the crest,  and therewith smote him. And as when a great tempestuous  wind tosseth a heap of parched husks, and scatters them  this way and that, even so did the wave scatter the long  beams of the raft. But Odysseus bestrode a single beam, as  one rideth on a courser, and stript him of the garments  which fair Calypso gave him. And presently he wound the  veil beneath his breast, and fell prone into the sea,  outstretching his hands as one eager to swim. And the lord,  the shaker of the earth, saw him and shook his head, and  communed with his own soul. 'Even so, after all thy  sufferings, go wandering over the deep, till thou shalt  come among a people, the fosterlings of Zeus. Yet for all  that I deem not that thou shalt think thyself too lightly  afflicted.' Therewith he lashed his steeds of the flowing  manes, and came to Aegae, where is his lordly home.    But Athene, daughter of Zeus, turned to new thoughts.  Behold, she bound up the courses of the other winds, and  charged them all to cease and be still; but she roused the  swift North and brake the waves before him, that so  Odysseus, of the seed of Zeus, might mingle with the  Phaeacians, lovers of the oar, avoiding death and the  fates.    So for two nights and two days he was wandering in the  swell of the sea, and much his heart boded of death. But  when at last the fair-tressed Dawn brought the full light  of the third day, thereafter the breeze fell, and lo, there  was a breathless calm, and with a quick glance ahead, (he  being upborne on a great wave,) he saw the land very near.  And even as when most welcome to his children is the sight  of a father's life, who lies in sickness and strong pains  long wasting away, some angry god assailing him; and to  their delight the gods have loosed him from his trouble; so  welcome to Odysseus showed land and wood; and he swam  onward being eager to set foot on the strand. But when he  was within earshot of the shore, and heard now the thunder  of the sea against the reefs--for the great wave crashed  against the dry land belching in terrible wise, and all was  covered with foam of the sea,--for there were no harbours  for ships nor shelters, but jutting headlands and reefs and  cliffs; then at last the knees of Odysseus were loosened  and his heart melted, and in heaviness he spake to his own  brave spirit:    'Ah me! now that beyond all hope Zeus hath given me sight  of land, and withal I have cloven my way through this gulf  of the sea, here there is no place to land on from out of  the grey water. For without are sharp crags, and round them  the wave roars surging, and sheer the smooth rock rises,  and the sea is deep thereby, so that in no wise may I find  firm foothold and escape my bane, for as I fain would go  ashore, the great wave may haply snatch and dash me on the  jagged rock--and a wretched endeavour that would be. But if  I swim yet further along the coast to find, if I may, spits  that take the waves aslant and havens of the sea, I fear  lest the storm-winds catch me again and bear me over the  teeming deep, making heavy moan; or else some god may even  send forth against me a monster from out of the shore  water; and many such pastureth the renowned Amphitrite. For  I know how wroth against me hath been the great Shaker of  the Earth.'    Whilst yet he pondered these things in his heart and mind,  a great wave bore him to the rugged shore. There would he  have been stript of his skin and all his bones been broken,  but that the goddess, grey-eyed Athene, put a thought into  his heart. He rushed in, and with both his hands clutched  the rock, whereto he clung till the great wave went by. So  he escaped that peril, but again with backward wash it  leapt on him and smote him and cast him forth into the  deep. And as when the cuttlefish is dragged forth from his  chamber, the many pebbles clinging to his suckers, even so  was the skin stript from his strong hand against the rocks,  and the great wave closed over him. There of a truth would  luckless Odysseus have perished beyond that which was  ordained, had not grey-eyed Athene given him sure counsel.  He rose from the line of the breakers that belch upon the  shore, and swam outside, ever looking landwards, to find,  if he might, spits that take the waves aslant, and havens  of the sea. But when he came in his swimming over against  the mouth of a fair-flowing river, whereby the place seemed  best in his eyes, smooth of rocks, and withal there was a  covert from the wind, Odysseus felt the river running, and  prayed to him in his heart:    'Hear me, O king, whosoever thou art; unto thee am I come,  as to one to whom prayer is made, while I flee the rebukes  of Poseidon from the deep. Yea, reverend even to the  deathless gods is that man who comes as a wanderer, even as  I now have come to thy stream and to thy knees after much  travail. Nay pity me, O king; for I avow myself thy  suppliant.'    So spake he, and the god straightway stayed his stream and  withheld his waves, and made the water smooth before him,  and brought him safely to the mouths of the river. And his  knees bowed and his stout hands fell, for his heart was  broken by the brine. And his flesh was all swollen and a  great stream of sea water gushed up through his mouth and  nostrils. So he lay without breath or speech, swooning,  such terrible weariness came upon him. But when now his  breath returned and his spirit came to him again, he loosed  from off him the veil of the goddess, and let it fall into  the salt flowing river. And the great wave bare it back  down the stream, and lightly Ino caught it in her hands.  Then Odysseus turned from the river, and fell back in the  reeds, and kissed earth, the grain-giver, and heavily he  spake unto his own brave spirit:    'Ah, woe is me! What is to betide me? What shall happen  unto me at the last? If I watch the river bed all through  the careful night, I fear that the bitter frost and fresh  dew may overcome me, as I breathe forth my life for  faintness, for the river breeze blows cold betimes in the  morning. But if I climb the hill-side up to the shady wood,  and there take rest in the thickets, though perchance the  cold and weariness leave hold of me, and sweet sleep may  come over me, I fear lest of wild beasts I become the spoil  and prey.'    So as he thought thereon this seemed to him the better way.  He went up to the wood, and found it nigh the water in a  place of wide prospect. So he crept beneath twin bushes  that grew from one stem, both olive trees, one of them wild  olive. Through these the force of the wet winds blew never,  neither did the bright sun light on it with his rays, nor  could the rain pierce through, so close were they twined  either to other; and thereunder crept Odysseus and anon he  heaped together with his hands a broad couch; for of fallen  leaves there was great plenty, enough to cover two or three  men in winter time, however hard the weather. And the  steadfast goodly Odysseus beheld it and rejoiced, and he  laid him in the midst thereof and flung over him the fallen  leaves. And as when a man hath hidden away a brand in the  black embers at an upland farm, one that hath no neighbours  nigh, and so saveth the seed of fire, that he may not have  to seek a light otherwhere, even so did Odysseus cover him  with the leaves. And Athene shed sleep upon his eyes, that  so it might soon release him from his weary travail,  overshadowing his eyelids.

So there he lay asleep, the steadfast goodly Odysseus,  fordone with toil and drowsiness.

For the rest, it does not follow that the mind fails to appreciate  numerical relations, because the tongue halts in the matter of  symbolizing them abstractly. A certain high official, when presiding  over the Indian census, was informed by a subordinate that it was  impossible to elicit from a certain jungle tribe any account of the  number of their huts, for the simple and sufficient reason that they  could not count above three. The director, who happened to be a man  of keen anthropological insight, had therefore himself to come to the  rescue. Assembling the tribal elders, he placed a stone on the ground,  saying to one \"This is your hut,\" and to another \"This is your hut,\"  as he placed a second stone a little way from the first. \"And now where  is yours?\" he asked a third. The natives at once entered into the spirit  of the game, and in a short time there was plotted out a plan of the  whole settlement, which subsequent verification proved to be both  geographically and numerically correct and complete. This story may  serve to show how nature supplies man with a ready reckoner in his  faculty of perception, which suffices well enough for the affairs of  the simpler sort of life. One knows how a shepherd can take in the  numbers of a flock at a glance. For the higher flights of experience,  however, especially when the unseen and merely possible has to be dealt  with, percepts must give way to concepts; massive consciousness must  give way to thinking by means of representations pieced together out  of elements rendered distinct by previous dissection of the total  impression; in short, a concrete must give way to an analytic way of  grasping the meaning of things. Moreover, since thinking is little  more or less than, as Plato put it, a silent conversation with oneself,  to possess an analytic language is to be more than half-way on the  road to the analytic mode of intelligence--the mode of thinking by  distinct concepts.    If there is a moral to this chapter, it must be that, whereas it is  the duty of the civilized overlords of primitive folk to leave them  their old institutions so far as they are not directly prejudicial  to their gradual advancement in culture, since to lose touch with one's  home-world is for the savage to lose heart altogether and die; yet  this consideration hardly applies at all to the native language. If  the tongue of an advanced people can be substituted, it is for the  good of all concerned. It is rather the fashion now-a-days amongst  anthropologists to lay it down as an axiom that the typical savage  and the typical peasant of Europe stand exactly on a par in respect  to their power of general intelligence. If by power we are to understand  sheer potentiality, I know of no sufficient evidence that enables us  to say whether, under ideal conditions, the average degree of mental  capacity would in the two cases prove the same or different. But I  am sure that the ordinary peasant of Europe, whose society provides  him, in the shape of an analytic language, with a ready-made instrument  for all the purposes of clear thinking, starts at an immense advantage,  as compared with a savage whose traditional speech is holophrastic.  Whatever be his mental power, the former has a much better chance of  making the most of it under the given circumstances. \"Give them the  words so that the ideas may come,\" is a maxim that will carry us far,  alike in the education of children, and in that of the peoples of lower  culture, of whom we have charge.          CHAPTER VI  SOCIAL ORGANIZATION      If an explorer visits a savage tribe with intent to get at the true  meaning of their life, his first duty, as every anthropologist will  tell him, is to acquaint himself thoroughly with the social  organization in all its forms. The reason for this is simply that only  by studying the outsides of other people can we hope to arrive at what  is going on inside them. \"Institutions\" will be found a convenient  word to express all the externals of the life of man in society, so  far as they reflect intelligence and purpose. Similarly, the internal  or subjective states thereto corresponding may be collectively  described as \"beliefs.\" Thus, the field-worker's cardinal maxim can  be phrased as follows: Work up to the beliefs by way of the  institutions.    Further, there are two ways in which a given set of institutions can  be investigated, and of these one, so far as it is practicable, should  precede the other. First, the institutions should be examined as so  many wheels in a social machine that is taken as if it were standing  still. You simply note the characteristic make of each, and how it  is placed in relation to the rest. Regarded in this static way, the  institutions appear as \"forms of social organization.\" Afterwards,  the machine is supposed to be set going, and you contemplate the parts  in movement. Regarded thus dynamically, the institutions appear as  \"customs.\"    In this chapter, then, something will be said about the forms of social  organization prevailing amongst peoples of the lower culture. Our  interest will be confined to the social morphology. In subsequent  chapters we shall go on to what might be called, by way of contrast,  the physiology of social life. In other words, we shall briefly  consider the legal and religious customs, together with the associated  beliefs.    How do the forms of social organization come into being? Does some  one invent them? Does the very notion of organization imply an  organizer? Or, like Topsy, do they simply grow? Are they natural  crystallizations that take place when people are thrown together? For  my own part, I think that, so long as we are pursuing anthropology  and not philosophy--in other words, are piecing together events  historically according as they appear to follow one another, and are  not discussing the ultimate question of the relation of mind to matter,  and which of the two in the long run governs which--we must be prepared  to recognize both physical necessity and spiritual freedom as  interpenetrating factors in human life. In the meantime, when  considering the subject of social organization, we shall do well, I  think, to keep asking ourselves all along, How far does force of  circumstances, and how far does the force of intelligent purpose,  account for such and such a net result?    If I were called upon to exhibit the chief determinants of human life  as a single chain of causes and effects--a simplification of the  historical problem, I may say at once, which I should never dream of  putting forward except as a convenient fiction, a device for making  research easier by providing it with a central line--I should do it  thus. Working backwards, I should say that culture depends on social  organization; social organization on numbers; numbers on food; and  food on invention. Here both ends of the series are represented by  spiritual factors--namely, culture at the one end, and invention at  the other. Amongst the intermediate links, food and numbers may be  reckoned as physical factors. Social organization, however, seems to  face in both directions at once, and to be something half-way between  a spiritual and a physical manifestation.    In placing invention at the bottom of the scale of conditions, I  definitely break with the opinion that human evolution is throughout  a purely \"natural\" process. Of course, you can use the word \"natural\"  so widely and vaguely as to cover everything that was, or is, or could  be. If it be used, however, so as to exclude the \"artificial,\" then  I am prepared to say that human life is preeminently an artificial  construction, or, in other words, a work of art; the distinguishing  mark of man consisting precisely in the fact that he alone of the  animals is capable of art.    It is well known how the invention of machinery in the middle of the  eighteenth century brought about that industrial revolution, the  social and political effects of which are still developing at this  hour. Well, I venture to put it forward as a proposition which applies  to human evolution, so far back as our evidence goes, that history  is the history of great inventions. Of course, it is true that climate  and geographical conditions in general help to determine the nature  and quantity of the food-supply; so that, for instance, however much  versed you may be in the art of agriculture, you cannot get corn to  grow on the shores of the Arctic sea. But, given the needful inventions,  superior weapons for instance, you need never allow yourselves to be  shoved away into such an inhospitable region; to which you presumably  do not retire voluntarily, unless, indeed, the state of your arts--for  instance, your skill in hunting or taming the reindeer--inclines you  to make a paradise of the tundra.    Suppose it granted, then, that a given people's arts and inventions,  whether directly or indirectly productive, are capable of a certain  average yield of food, it is certain, as Malthus and Darwin would remind  us, that human fertility can be reckoned on to bring the numbers up  to a limit bearing a more or less constant ratio to the means of  subsistence.    At length we reach our more immediate subject--namely, social  organization. In what sense, if any, is social organization dependent  on numbers? Unfortunately, it is too large a question to thrash out  here. I may, however, refer the reader to the ingenious classification  of the peoples of the world, by reference to the degree of their social  organization and culture, which is attempted by Mr. Sutherland in his  _Origin and Growth of the Moral Instinct_. He there tries to show that  a certain size of population can be correlated with each grade in the  scale of human evolution--at any rate up to the point at which  full-blown civilization"]]]
