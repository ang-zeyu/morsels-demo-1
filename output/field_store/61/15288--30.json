In the contest between Weber and Rossini which agitated Vienna,  Schubert, though deeply imbued with the seriousness of art, and  by nature closely allied in sympathies with the composer of \"Der  Freischuetz,\" took no part. He was too easy-going to become a volunteer  partisan, too shy and obscure to make his alliance a thing to be sought  after. Besides, Weber had treated him with great brusqueness, and damned  an opera for him, a slight which even good-natured Franz Schubert could  not easily forgive.    The fifteen operas of Schubert, unknown now except to musicians, contain  a wealth of beautiful melody which could easily be spread over a score  of ordinary works. The purely lyric impulse so dominated him that  dramatic arrangement was lost sight of, and the noblest melodies were  likely to be lavished on the most unworthy situations. Even under  the operatic form he remained essentially the song-writer. So in  the symphony his affluence of melodic inspiration seems actually  to embarrass him, to the detriment of that breadth and symmetry of  treatment so vital to this form of art. It is in the musical lyric that  our composer stands matchless.    During his life as an independent musician at Vienna, Schubert lived  fighting a stern battle with want and despondency, while the publishers  were commencing to make fortunes by the sale of his exquisite _Lieder_.  At that time a large source of income for the Viennese composers was the  public performance of their works in concerts under their own direction.  From recourse to this, Schubert's bashfulness and lack of skill as a  _virtuoso_ on any instrument helped to bar him, though he accompanied  his own songs with exquisite effect. Once only his friends organized  a concert for him, and the success was very brilliant. But he was  prevented from repeating the good fortune by that fatal illness  which soon set in. So he lived out the last glimmers of his life,  poverty-stricken, despondent, with few even of the amenities of  friendship to soothe his declining days. Yet those who know the  beautiful results of that life, and have even a faint glow of sympathy  with the life of a man of genius, will exclaim with one of the most  eloquent critics of Schubert:    \"But shall we, therefore, pity a man who all the while reveled in the  treasures of his creative ore, and from the very depths of whose despair  sprang the sweetest flowers of song? Who would not battle with the  iciest blast of the north if out of storm and snow he could bring back  to his chamber the germs of the 'Winterreise?' Who would grudge the  moisture of his eyes if he could render it immortal in the strains of  Schubert's 'Lob der Thrane?'\"    Schubert died in the flower of his youth, November 19, 1828; but he left  behind him nearly a thousand compositions, six hundred of which were  songs. Of his operas only the \"Enchanted Harp\" and \"Rosamond\" were put  on the stage during his lifetime. \"Fierabras,\" considered to be his  finest dramatic work, has never been produced. His church music,  consisting of six masses, many offertories, and the great \"Hallelujah\"  of Klopstock, is still performed in Germany. Several of his symphonies  are ranked among the greatest works of this nature. His pianoforte  compositions are brilliant, and strongly in the style of Beethoven,  who was always the great object of Schubert's devoted admiration, his  artistic idol and model. It was his dying request that he should be  buried by the side of Beethoven, of whom the art-world had been deprived  the year before.    Compared with Schubert, other composers seem to have written in prose.  His imagination burned with a passionate love of Nature. The lakes, the  woods, the mountain heights, inspired him with eloquent reveries that  burst into song; but he always saw Nature through the medium of human  passion and sympathy, which transfigured it. He was the faithful  interpreter of spiritual suffering, and the joy which is born thereof.    The genius of Schubert seems to have been directly formed for the  expression of subjective emotion in music. That his life should have  been simultaneous with the perfect literary unfolding of the old  _Volkslied_ in the superb lyrics of Goethe, Heine, and their school,  is quite remarkable. Poe-try and song clasped hands on the same lofty  summits of genius. Liszt has given to our composer the title of _le  musicien le plus poetique_, which very well expresses his place in art.    In the song as created by Schubert and transmitted to his successors,  there are three forms, the first of which is that of the simple _Lied_,  with one unchanged melody. A good example of this is the setting of  Goethe's \"Haideroslein,\" which is full of quaint grace and simplicity.  A second and more elaborate method is what the Germans call  \"through-composed,\" in which all the different feelings are successively  embodied in the changes of the melody, the sense of unity being  preserved by the treatment of the accompaniment, or the recurrence of  the principal motive at the close of the song. Two admirable models of  this are found in the \"Lindenbaum\" and \"Serenade.\"    The third and finest art-method, as applied by Schubert to lyric music,  is the \"declamatory.\" In this form we detect the consummate flower of  the musical lyric. The vocal part is lifted into a species of passionate  chant, full of dramatic fire and color, while the accompaniment, which  is extremely elaborate, furnishes a most picturesque setting. The genius  of the composer displays itself here fully as much as in the vocal  treatment. When the lyric feeling rises to its climax it expresses  itself in the crowning melody, this high tide of the music and poetry  being always in unison. As masterpieces of this form may be cited \"Die  Stadt\" and \"Der Erlkoenig,\" which stand far beyond any other works of the  same nature in the literature of music.      IV.    Robert Schumann, the loving critic, admirer, and disciple of Schubert in  the province of song, was in most respects a man of far different  type. The son of a man of wealth and position, his mind and tastes were  cultivated from early youth with the utmost care. Schumann is known  in Germany no less as a philosophical thinker and critic than as  a composer. As the editor of the _Neue Zeitschrift fuer Musik_, he  exercised a powerful influence over contemporary thought in art-matters,  and established himself both as a keen and incisive thinker and as a  master of literary style. Schumann was at first intended for the law,  but his unconquerable taste for music asserted itself in spite of family  opposition. His acquaintance with the celebrated teacher Wieck, whose  gifted daughter Clara afterward became his wife, finally established  his career; for it was through Wieck's advice that the Schumann family  yielded their opposition to the young man's bent.    Once settled in his new career, Schumann gave himself up to work with  the most indefatigable ardor. The early part of the present century was  a halcyon time for the _virtuosi_, and the fame and wealth that poured  themselves on such players as Paganini and Liszt made such a pursuit  tempting in the extreme. Fortunately, the young musician was saved from  such a career. In his zeal of practice and desire to attain a perfectly  independent action for each finger on the piano, Schumann devised some  machinery, the result of which was to weaken the sinews of his third  finger by undue distention. By this he lost the effective use of the  whole right hand, and of course his career as a _virtuoso_ practically  closed.    Music gained in its higher walks what it lost in a lower. Schumann  devoted himself to composition and aesthetic criticism, after he had  passed through a thorough course of preparatory studies. Both as a  writer and a composer Schumann fought against Philistinism in music.  Ardent, progressive, and imaginative, he soon became the leader of the  romantic school, and inaugurated the crusade which had its parallel in  France in that carried on by Victor Hugo in the domain of poetry. His  early pianoforte compositions bear the strong impress of this fiery,  revolutionary spirit. I lis great symphonic works belong to a later  period, when his whole nature had mellowed and ripened without losing  its imaginative sweep and brilliancy. Schumann's compositions for the  piano and orchestra are those by which his name is most widely honored,  but nowhere do we find a more characteristic exercise of his genius than  in his songs, to which this article will call more special attention.    Such works as the \"Etudes Symphoniques\" and the \"Kreisleriana\" express  much of the spirit of unrest and longing aspiration, the struggle to  get away from prison-bars and limits, which seem to have sounded the  key-note of Schumann's deepest nature. But these feelings could only  find their fullest outlet in the musical form expressly suited to  subjective emotion. Accordingly, the \"Sturm and Drang\" epoch of his  life, when all his thoughts and conceptions were most unsettled and  visionary, was most fruitful in lyric song. In Heinrich Heine he found  a fitting poetical co-worker, in whose moods he seemed to see a perfect  reflection of his own--Heine, in whom the bitterest irony was wedded to  the deepest pathos, \"the spoiled favorite of the Graces,\" \"the knight  with the laughing tear in his scutcheon\"--Heine, whose songs are  charged with the brightest light and deepest gloom of the human heart.    Schumann's songs never impress us as being deliberate attempts at  creative effort, consciously selected forms through which to express  thoughts struggling for speech. They are rather involuntary experiments  to relieve one's self of some wo-ful burden, medicine for the soul.  Schumann is never distinctively the lyric composer; his imagination had  too broad and majestic"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17474"],[0,"How to Listen to Music, 7th ed. (#20)"],[1,"differentiated from each other in respect of the style of composition  and the manner of performance, both determined by the nature of the  instrument employed and the status of the musical idea. Simply for the  sake of convenience let the period represented by the first group be  called the classic; the second the classic-romantic; the third the  romantic, and the last the bravura. I beg the reader, however, not to  extend these designations beyond the boundaries of the present study;  they have been chosen arbitrarily, and confusion might result if the  attempt were made to apply them to any particular concert scheme. I  have chosen the composers because of their broadly representative  capacity. And they must stand for a numerous _epigonoi_ whose names  make up our concert lists: say, Couperin, Rameau, and Haydn in the  first group; Schubert in the second; Mendelssohn and Rubinstein in the  third. It would not be respectful to the memory of Liszt were I to  give him the associates with whom in my opinion he stands; that matter  may be held in abeyance.    [Sidenote: _Predecessors of the pianoforte._]    [Sidenote: _The Clavichord._]    [Sidenote: _\"Bebung.\"_]    The instruments for which the first group of writers down to Haydn and  Mozart wrote, were the immediate precursors of the pianoforte--the  clavichord, spinet, or virginal, and harpsichord. The last was the  concert instrument, and stood in the same relationship to the others  that the grand pianoforte of to-day stands to the upright and square.  The clavichord was generally the medium for the composer's private  communings with his muse, because of its superiority over its fellows  in expressive power; but it gave forth only a tiny tinkle and was  incapable of stirring effects beyond those which sprang from pure  emotionality. The tone was produced by a blow against the string,  delivered by a bit of brass set in the farther end of the key. The  action was that of a direct lever, and the bit of brass, which was  called the tangent, also acted as a bridge and measured off the  segment of string whose vibration produced the desired tone. It was  therefore necessary to keep the key pressed down so long as it was  desired that the tone should sound, a fact which must be kept in mind  if one would understand the shortcomings as well as the advantages of  the instrument compared with the spinet or harpsichord. It also  furnishes one explanation of the greater lyricism of Bach's music  compared with that of his contemporaries. By gently rocking the hand  while the key was down, a tremulous motion could be communicated to  the string, which not only prolonged the tone appreciably but gave it  an expressive effect somewhat analogous to the vibrato of a violinist.  The Germans called this effect _Bebung_, the French _Balancement_, and  it was indicated by a row of dots under a short slur written over the  note. It is to the special fondness which Bach felt for the clavichord  that we owe, to a great extent, the cantabile style of his music, its  many-voicedness and its high emotionality.    [Sidenote: _Quilled instruments._]    [Sidenote: _Tone of the harpsichord and spinet._]    [Sidenote: _Bach's \"Music of the future.\"_]    The spinet, virginal, and harpsichord were quilled instruments, the  tone of which was produced by snapping the strings by means of plectra  made of quill, or some other flexible substance, set in the upper end  of a bit of wood called the jack, which rested on the farther end of  the key and moved through a slot in the sounding-board. When the key  was pressed down, the jack moved upward past the string which was  caught and twanged by the plectrum. The blow of the clavichord tangent  could be graduated like that of the pianoforte hammer, but the quills  of the other instruments always plucked the strings with the same  force, so that mechanical devices, such as a swell-box, similar in  principle to that of the organ, coupling in octaves, doubling the  strings, etc., had to be resorted to for variety of dynamic effects.  The character of tone thus produced determined the character of the  music composed for these instruments to a great extent. The brevity of  the sound made sustained melodies ineffective, and encouraged the use  of a great variety of embellishments and the spreading out of  harmonies in the form of arpeggios. It is obvious enough that Bach,  being one of those monumental geniuses that cast their prescient  vision far into the future, refused to be bound by such mechanical  limitations. Though he wrote _Clavier_, he thought organ, which was  his true interpretative medium, and so it happens that the greatest  sonority and the broadest style that have been developed in the  pianoforte do not exhaust the contents of such a composition as the  \"Chromatic Fantasia and Fugue.\"    [Sidenote: _Scarlatti's sonatas._]    The earliest music written for these instruments--music which does  not enter into this study--was but one remove from vocal music. It  came through compositions written for the organ. Of Scarlatti's music  the pieces most familiar are a Capriccio and Pastorale which Tausig  rewrote for the pianoforte. They were called sonatas by their  composer, but are not sonatas in the modern sense. Sonata means  \"sound-piece,\" and when the term came into music it signified only  that the composition to which it was applied was written for  instruments instead of voices. Scarlatti did a great deal to develop  the technique of the harpsichord and the style of composing for it.  His sonatas consist each of a single movement only, but in their  structure they foreshadow the modern sonata form in having two  contrasted themes, which are presented in a fixed key-relationship.  They are frequently full of grace and animation, but are as purely  objective, formal, and soulless in their content as the other  instrumental compositions of the epoch to which they belong.    [Sidenote: _The suite._]    [Sidenote: _Its history and form._]    [Sidenote: _The bond between the movements._]    The most significant of the compositions of this period are the  Suites, which because they make up so large a percentage of _Clavier_  literature (using the term to cover the pianoforte and its  predecessors), and because they pointed the way to the distinguishing  form of the subsequent period, the sonata, are deserving of more  extended consideration. The suite is a set of pieces in the same key,  but contrasted in character, based upon certain admired dance-forms.  Originally it was a set of dances and nothing more, but in the hands  of the composers the dances underwent many modifications, some of them  to the obvious detriment of their national or other distinguishing  characteristics. The suite came into fashion about the middle of the  seventeenth century and was also called _Sonata da Camera_ and  _Balletto_ in Italy, and, later, _Partita_ in France. In its  fundamental form it embraced four movements: I. Allemande. II.  Courante. III. Sarabande. IV. Gigue. To these four were sometimes  added other dances--the Gavotte, Passepied, Branle, Minuet, Bourree,  etc.--but the rule was that they should be introduced between the  Sarabande and the Gigue. Sometimes also the set was introduced by a  Prelude or an Overture. Identity of key was the only external tie  between the various members of the suite, but the composers sought to  establish an artistic unity by elaborating the sentiments for which  the dance-forms seemed to offer a vehicle, and presenting them in  agreeable contrast, besides enriching the primitive structure with new  material. The suites of Bach and Handel are the high-water mark in  this style of composition, but it would be difficult to find the  original characteristics of the dances in their settings. It must  suffice us briefly to indicate the characteristics of the principal  forms.    [Sidenote: _The Allemande._]    The Allemande, as its name indicates, was a dance of supposedly German  origin. For that reason the German composers, when it came to them  from France, where the suite had its origin, treated it with great  partiality. It is in moderate tempo, common time, and made up of two  periods of eight measures, both of which are repeated. It begins with  an upbeat, and its metre, to use the terms of prosody, is iambic. The  following specimen from Mersenne's \"Harmonie Universelle,\" 1636, well  displays its characteristics:    [Music illustration]    [Sidenote: _Iambics in music and poetry._]    Robert Burns's familiar iambics,        \"Ye flowery banks o' bonnie Doon,        How can ye bloom sae fair?      How can ye chant, ye little birds,        And I sae fu' o' care!\"    might serve to keep the rhythmical characteristics of the Allemande in  mind were it not for the arbitrary changes made by the composers  already hinted at. As it is, we frequently find the stately movement  of the old dance broken up into elaborate, but always quietly  flowing, ornamentation, as indicated in the following excerpt from the  third of Bach's English suites:    [Music illustration]    [Sidenote: _The Courante._]    The Courante, or Corrente (\"Teach lavoltas high and swift corantos,\"  says Shakespeare), is a French dance which was extremely popular in  the sixteenth, seventeenth, and eighteenth centuries--a polite dance,  like the minuet. It was in triple time, and its movement was bright  and brisk, a merry energy being imparted to the measure by the  prevailing figure, a dotted quarter-note, an eighth, and a quarter in  a measure, as illustrated in the following excerpt also from Mersenne:    [Music illustration]    The suite composers varied the movement greatly, however, and the  Italian Corrente consists chiefly of rapid running passages.    [Sidenote: _The Sarabande._]    The Sarabande was also in triple time, but its movement was slow and  stately. In Spain, whence it was derived, it was sung to the  accompaniment of castanets, "]]]
