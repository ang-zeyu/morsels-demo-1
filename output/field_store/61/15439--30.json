Since the  ions are usually more active chemically than the molecules, most of the  chemical properties of an electrolyte are due to the ions rather than to  the molecules.    The solutions of any two substances which give the same ion will have  certain properties in common. Thus all solutions containing the copper  ion (Cu^{++}) are blue, unless the color is modified by the presence of  ions or molecules having some other color.      EXERCISES    1.

CHAPTER X    ACIDS, BASES, AND SALTS; NEUTRALIZATION      ~Acids, bases, and salts.~ The three classes of compounds known  respectively as acids, bases, and salts include the great majority of  the compounds with which we shall have to deal. It is important,  therefore, for us to consider each of these classes in a systematic way.  The individual members belonging to each class will be discussed in  detail in the appropriate places, but a few representatives of each  class will be described in this chapter with special reference to the  common properties in accordance with which they are classified.    ~The familiar acids.~ _Hydrochloric acid_ is a gas composed of hydrogen and  chlorine, and has the formula HCl. The substance is very soluble in  water, and it is this solution which is usually called hydrochloric  acid. _Nitric acid_ is a liquid composed of hydrogen, nitrogen, and  oxygen, having the formula HNO_{3}. As sold commercially it is mixed  with about 32% of water. _Sulphuric acid_, whose composition is  represented by the formula H_{2}SO_{4}, is an oily liquid nearly twice  as heavy as water, and is commonly called _oil of vitriol_.    ~Characteristics of acids.~ (1) All acids contain hydrogen. (2) When  dissolved in water the molecules of the acid dissociate into two kinds  of ions. One of these is always hydrogen and is the cation (+), while  the other consists of the remainder of the molecule and is the anion  (-). (3) The solution tastes sour. (4) It has the power to change the  color of certain substances called _indicators_. Thus blue litmus is  changed to red, and yellow methyl orange is changed to red. Since all  acids produce hydrogen cations, while the anions of each are different,  the properties which all acids have in common when in solution, such as  taste and action on indicators, must be attributed to the hydrogen ions.    DEFINITION: _An acid is a substance which produces hydrogen ions when  dissolved in water or other dissociating liquids._    ~Undissociated acids.~ When acids are perfectly free from water, or are  dissolved in liquids like benzene which do not have the power of  dissociating them into ions, they should have no real acid properties.  This is found to be the case. Under these circumstances they do not  affect the color of indicators or have any of the properties  characteristic of acids.    The familiar bases. The bases most used in the laboratory are sodium  hydroxide (NaOH), potassium hydroxide (KOH), and calcium hydroxide  (Ca(OH)_{2}). These are white solids, soluble in water, the latter  sparingly so. Some bases are very difficultly soluble in water. The very  soluble ones with most pronounced basic properties are sometimes called  the _alkalis_.    ~Characteristics of bases.~ (1) All bases contain hydrogen and oxygen. (2)  When dissolved in water the molecules of the base dissociate into two  kinds of ions. One of these is always composed of oxygen and hydrogen  and is the anion. It has the formula OH and is called the _hydroxyl  ion_. The remainder of the molecule, which usually consists of a single  atom, is the cation. (3) The solution of a base has a soapy feel and a  brackish taste. (4) It reverses the color change produced in indicators  by acids, turning red litmus blue, and red methyl orange yellow. Since  all bases produce hydroxyl anions, while the cations of each are  different, the properties which all bases have in common when in  solution must be due to the hydroxyl ions.    DEFINITION: _A base is a substance which produces hydroxyl ions when  dissolved in water or other dissociating liquids._    ~Undissociated bases.~ Bases, in the absence of water or when dissolved in  liquids which do not dissociate them, should have none of the properties  characteristic of this class of substances. This has been found to be  the case. For example, they have no effect upon indicators under these  circumstances.    ~Neutralization.~ When an acid and a base are brought together in solution  in proper proportion, the characteristic properties of each disappear.  The solution tastes neither sour nor brackish; it has no effect upon  indicators. There can therefore be neither hydrogen nor hydroxyl ions  present in the solution. A study of reactions of this kind has shown  that the hydrogen ions of the acid combine with the hydroxyl ions of the  base to form molecules of water, water being a substance which is not  appreciably dissociated into ions. This action of an acid on a base is  called _neutralization_. The following equations express the  neutralization of the three acids by three bases, water being formed in  each case.        Na^{+}, OH^{-} + H^{+}, Cl^{-} = Na^{+}, Cl^{-} + H_{2}O.        K^{+}, OH^{-} + H^{+}, NO_{3}^{-} = K^{+}, NO_{3}^{-} + H_{2}O.        Ca^{++}, (OH)_{2}^{--} + H_{2}^{++}, SO_{4}^{--}           = Ca^{++}, SO_{4}^{--} + 2H_{2}O.    DEFINITION: _Neutralization consists in the union of the hydrogen ion of  an acid with the hydroxyl ion of a base to form water._    ~Salts.~ It will be noticed that in neutralization the anion of the acid  and the cation of the base are not changed. If, however, the water is  expelled by evaporation, these two ions slowly unite, and when the water  becomes saturated with the substance so produced, it separates in the  form of a solid called a _salt_.    DEFINITION: _A salt is a substance formed by the union of the anion of  an acid with the cation of a base._    ~Characteristics of salts.~ (1) From the definition of a salt it will be  seen that there is no element or group of elements which characterize  salts. (2) Salts as a class have no peculiar taste. (3) In the absence  of all other substances they are without action on indicators. (4) When  dissolved in water they form two kinds of ions.         ~Heat of neutralization.~ If neutralization is due to the union       of hydrogen ions with hydroxyl ions, and nothing more, it       follows that when a given weight of water is formed in       neutralization, the heat set free should always be the same, no       matter from what acid and base the two kinds of ions have been       supplied. Careful experiments have shown that this is the case,       provided no other reactions take place at the same time. When       18g. of water are formed in neutralization, 13,700 cal. of heat       are set free. This is represented in the equations        Na^{+}, OH^{-} + H^{+}, Cl^{-}           = Na^{+}, Cl^{-} + H_{2}O + 13,700 cal.        K^{+}, OH^{-} + H^{+}, NO_{3}^{-}           = K^{+}, NO_{3}^{-} + H_{2}O + 13,700 cal.        Ca^{++}, (OH)_{2}^{--} + H_{2}^{++}, SO_{4}^{--}           = Ca^{++}, SO_{4}^{--} + 2H_{2}O + 2 x 13,700 cal.    ~Neutralization a quantitative act.~ Since neutralization is a definite  chemical act, each acid will require a perfectly definite weight of each  base for its neutralization. For example, a given weight of sulphuric  acid will always require a definite weight of sodium hydroxide, in  accordance with the equation        H_{2}, SO_{4} + 2Na, OH = Na_{2}, SO_{4} + 2H_{2}O.         ~Determination of the ratio in neutralization.~ The quantities of       acid and base required"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20851"],[0,"Character Sketches of Romance, Fiction and the Drama, Vol. 3 (#20)"],[1,"s, he retired to America, and died in  jail.--C.

They left the fatal spot, and settled in the Modai woods.  Here they had one son, Yer[=u]ti, and one daughter, Mooma, but Qui[=a]ra  was killed by a jag[)u]ar before the latter was born. Mon[)e]ma left  the Mondai woods, and went to live at St. Jo[)a]chin, in Paraguay, but  soon died from the effects of a house and city life.--Southey, _A Tale  of Paraguay_ (1814).

Jack Ardourly fails in love with  Adolphine de Courcy in the street, and gets Tom King to assist in  ferreting her out. Tom King discovers that his sweeting lives in the  house of a French refugee, a barber, named Mons. Morbleu; but not  knowing the name of the young lady, he inquires for Mr. Thompson, hoping  to pick up information. Mons. Morbleu says no Mons. Tonson lives in the  house, but only Mde.

Tonson; but ultimately Jack Ardourly marries Adolphine, whose  mother is Mrs. Thompson after all.    Taylor wrote a drama of the same title in 1767.      =Monster= (_The_), Renwick Williams, a wretch who used to prowl about  London by night, armed with a double-edged knife, with which he  mutilated women. He was condemned July 8, 1790.      =Mont Rognon= (_Baron of_), a giant of enormous strength and insatiable  appetite. He was bandy-legged, had an elastic stomach, and four rows of  teeth. He was a paladin of Charlemagne, and one of the four sent in  search of Croquemitaine and Fear Fortress.--_Croquemitaine._      =Mont St. Michel=, in Normandy. Here nine druidesses used to sell arrows  to sailors to charm away storms. The arrows had to be discharged by a  young man 25 years of age.    The Laplanders drove a profitable trade by selling winds to sailors.  Even so late as 1814, Bessie Millie, of Pom[=o]na (Orkney Islands),  helped to eke out a livelihood by selling winds for sixpence.    Eric, king of Sweden, could make the winds blow from any quarter he  liked by a turn of his cap. Hence, he was nicknamed \"Windy Cap.\"      =Mont Tr['e]sor=, in France; so called by Gontran \"the Good,\" king of  Burgundy (sixteenth century). One day, weary with the chase, Gontran  laid himself down near a small river, and fell asleep. The squire who  watched his master, saw a little animal come from the king's mouth, and  walk to the stream, over which the squire laid his sword, and the  animal running across, entered a hole in the mountain. When Gontran was  told of this incident, he said he had dreamt that he crossed a bridge of  steel, and, having entered a cave at the foot of a mountain, entered a  palace of gold. Gontran employed men to undermine the hill, and found  there vast treasures, which he employed in works of charity and  religion. In order to commemorate this event he called the hill Mont  Tr['e]sor.--Claud Paradin, _Symbola Heroica_.    [Asterism] This story has been ascribed to numerous persons.      =Mon'tague= (3 _syl._), head of a noble house in Verona, at feudal enmity  with the house of Cap[)u]let. Romeo belonged to the former, and Juliet  to the latter house.    _Lady Montague_, wife of Lord Montague, and mother of  Romeo.--Shakespeare, _Romeo and Juliet_ (1598).      =Montalban.=    _Don Kyrie Elyson de Montalban_, a hero of romance, in the _History of  Tirante the White_.    _Thomas de Montalban_, brother of Don Kyrie Elyson, in the same romance  of chivalry.    _Rinaldo de Montalban_, a hero of romance, in the _Mirror of  Knighthood_, from which work both Bojardo and Ariosto have largely  borrowed.    _Montalban_, now called Montauban (a contraction of _Mons Alba'nus_), in  France, in the department of Tarn-et-Garonne.        Jousted in Aspramont or Montalban.        Milton, _Paradise Lost_, i. 583 (1665).    _Montalban_ (_The Count_), in love with Volant[^e] (3 _syl._), daughter of  Balthazar. In order to sound her, the count disguised himself as a  father confessor; but Volant[^e] detected the trick instantly, and said to  him, \"Come, come, count, pull off your lion's hide, and confess yourself  an ass.\" However, as Volant[^e] really loved him, all came right at  last.--J. Tobin, _The Honeymoon_ (1804).      =Montanto= (_Signor_), a master of fence and a great braggart.--Ben  Jonson, _Every Man in His Humour_ (1598).      =Montargis= (_The Dog of_), named Dragon. It belonged to Captain Aubri de  Montdidier, and is especially noted for his fight with the Chevalier  Richard Macaire. The dog was called Montargis, because the encounter was  depicted over the chimney of the great hall in the castle of Montargis.  It was in the forest of Bondi, close by this castle, that Aubri was  assassinated.      =Monte Christo= (_Count_), convict who escapes from prison, and finds  immense treasure, with which he does incredible things.    Assuming the title of \"count,\" he adds the name of the island on which  his treasure is buried, and plays the grande seignior in society,  punishing his former persecutors and false friends, and rewarding his  old allies. Finally he is brought to confess that man cannot play  providence, and to recall the words \"Vengeance is mine!\"--Alexander  Dumas, _Count of Monte Christo_.      =Montenay= (_Sir Philip de_), an old English knight.--Sir W. Scott,  _Castle Dangerous_ (time, Henry I.).      =Montesi'nos=, a legendary hero, who received some affront at the French  court, and retired to La Mancha, in Spain. Here he lived in a cavern, some  sixty feet deep, called \"The Cavern of Montesinos.\" Don Quixote descended  part of the way down this cavern, and fell into a trance, in which he saw  Montesinos himself, Durandart[^e] and Belerma under the spell of Merlin,  Dulcin'ea del Toboso enchanted into a country wench, and other visions,  which he more than half believed to be realities.--Cervantes, _Don  Quixote_, II. ii. 5, 6 (1615).    [Asterism] This Durandart[^e] was the cousin of Montesinos, and Belerma  the lady he served for seven years. When he fell at Roncesvall[^e]s, he  prayed his cousin to carry his heart to Belerma.      =Montespan= (_The marquis de_), a conceited court fop, silly and  heartless. When Louis XIV. took Mde. de Montespan for his concubine, he  banished the marquis, saying:        Your strange and countless follies--      The scenes you make--your loud domestic broils--      Bring scandal on our court. Decorum needs      Your banishment.... Go!      And for your separate household, which entails      A double cost, our treasure shall accord you      A hundred thousand crowns.        Act iv. 1.    The foolish old marquis says, in his self-conceit:        A hundred thousand crowns for being civil      To one another! Well now, that's a thing      That happens but to marquises. It shows      My value in the state. The king esteems      My comfort of such consequence to France,      He pays me down a hundred thousand crowns,      Rather than let my wife disturb my temper!        Act v. 2.    _Madame de Montespan_, wife of the marquis. She supplanted La Valli[`e]re  in the base love of Louis XIV. La Valli[`e]re loved the _man_, Montespan  the _king_. She had wit to warm but not to burn, energy which passed for  feeling, a head to check her heart, and not too much principle for a  French court. Mde. de Montespan was the _prot['e]g['e]e_ of the Duke de  Lauzun, who used her as a stepping-stone to wealth; but when in favor,  she kicked down the ladder by which she had climbed to power. However,  Lauzun had his revenge; and when La Valli[`e]re took the veil, Mde. de  Montespan was banished from the court.--Lord E. L. B. Lytton, _The  Duchess de la Valli[`e]re_ (1836).      =Montfau[c,]on= (_The Lady Calista of_), attendant of Queen  Berengaria.--Sir. W.
