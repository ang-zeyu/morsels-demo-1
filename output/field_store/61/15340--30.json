Silently, and without special call, into my study of  imagination come these apparitions, clad in snowy mantles, brooched and  gemmed with frosts. Their numbers I do not care to count, for I know  they are the numbers of many years. The visages of two or three are sad  enough, but on the whole 'tis a congregation of jolly ghosts. The  nostrils of my memory are assailed by a faint odor of plum-pudding and  burnt brandy. I hear a sound as of light music, a whisk of women's  dresses whirled round in dance, a click as of glasses pledged by  friends. Before one of these apparitions is a mound, as of a new-made  grave, on which the snow is lying. I know, I know! Drape thyself not in  white like the others, but in mourning stole of crape; and instead of  dance music, let there haunt around thee the service for the dead! I  know that sprig of mistletoe, O Spirit in the midst! Under it I swung  the girl I loved--girl no more now than I am a boy--and kissed her spite  of blush and pretty shriek. And thee, too, with fragrant trencher in  hand, over which blue tongues of flame are playing, I do know--most  ancient apparition of them all. I remember thy reigning night. Back to  very days of childhood am I taken by the ghostly raisins simmering in a  ghostly brandy flame. Where now the merry boys and girls that thrust  their fingers in thy blaze? And now, when I think of it, thee also would  I drape in black raiment, around thee also would I make the burial  service murmur.                                   - - - - -    This, then, is Christmas, 1862. Everything is silent in Dreamthorp. The  smith's hammer reposes beside the anvil. The weaver's flying shuttle is  at rest. Through the clear wintry sunshine the bells this morning rang  from the gray church tower amid the leafless elms, and up the walk the  villagers trooped in their best dresses and their best faces--the latter  a little reddened by the sharp wind: mere redness in the middle aged; in  the maids, wonderful bloom to the eyes of their lovers--and took their  places decently in the ancient pews. The clerk read the beautiful  prayers of our Church, which seem more beautiful at Christmas than at  any other period. For that very feeling which breaks down at this time  the barriers which custom, birth, or wealth have erected between man and  man, strikes down the barrier of time which intervenes between the  worshipper of to-day and the great body of worshippers who are at rest  in their graves. On such a day as this, hearing these prayers, we feel a  kinship with the devout generations who heard them long ago. The devout  lips of the Christian dead murmured the responses which we now murmur;  along this road of prayer did their thoughts of our innumerable dead,  our brothers and sisters in faith and hope, approach the Maker, even as  ours at present approach Him. Prayers over, the clergyman--who is no  Boanerges, of Chrysostom, golden-mouthed, but a loving, genial-hearted,  pious man, the whole extent of his life from boyhood until now, full of  charity and kindly deeds, as autumn fields with heavy wheaten ears; the  clergyman, I say--for the sentence is becoming unwieldy on my hands, and  one must double back to secure connexion--read out in that silvery voice  of his, which is sweeter than any music to my ear, those chapters of the  New Testament that deal with the birth of the Saviour. And the red-faced  rustic congregation hung on the good man's voice as he spoke of the  Infant brought forth in a manger, of the shining angels that appeared in  the mid-air to the shepherds, of the miraculous star that took its  station in the sky, and of the wise men who came from afar and laid  their gifts of frankincense and myrrh at the feet of the child. With the  story every one was familiar, but on that day, and backed by the  persuasive melody of the reader's voice, it seemed to all quite new--at  least, they listened attentively as if it were. The discourse that  followed possessed no remarkable thoughts; it dealt simply with the  goodness of the Maker of heaven and earth, and the shortness of time,  with the duties of thankfulness and charity to the poor; and I am  persuaded that every one who heard returned to his house in a better  frame of mind. And so the service remitted us all to our own homes, to  what roast-beef and plum-pudding slender means permitted, to gatherings  around cheerful fires, to half-pleasant, half-sad remembrances of the  dead and the absent.    From sermon I have returned like the others, and it is my purpose to  hold Christmas alone. I have no one with me at table, and my own  thoughts must be my Christmas guests. Sitting here, it is pleasant to  think how much kindly feeling exists this present night in England. By  imagination I can taste of every table, pledge every toast, silently  join in every roar of merriment. I become a sort of universal guest.  With what propriety is this jovial season, placed amid dismal December  rains and snows! How one pities the unhappy Australians, with whom  everything is turned topsy-turvy, and who holds Christmas at midsummer!  The face of Christmas glows all the brighter for the cold. The heart  warms as the frost increases. Estrangements which have embittered the  whole year, melt in to-night's hospitable smile. There are warmer  handshakings on this night than during the by-past twelve months. Friend  lives in the mind of friend. There is more charity at this time than at  any other. You get up at midnight and toss your spare coppers to the  half-benumbed musicians whiffling beneath your windows, although at any  other time you would consider their performance a nuisance, and call  angrily for the police. Poverty, and scanty clothing, and fireless  grates, come home at this season to the bosoms of the rich, and they  give of their abundance. The very red-breast of the woods enjoys his  Christmas feast. Good feeling incarnates itself into plum-pudding. The  Master's words, \"The poor ye have always with you,\" wear at this time a  deep significance. For at least one night on each year over all  Christendom there is brotherhood. And good men, sitting amongst their  families, or by a solitary fire like me, when they remember the light,  that shone over the poor clowns huddling on the Bethlehem plains  eighteen hundred years ago, the apparition of shining angels overhead,  the song \"Peace on earth and good-will toward men,\" which for the first  hallowed the midnight air,--pray for that strain's fulfilment, that  battle and strife may vex the nations no more, that not only on  Christmas eve, but the whole year round, men shall be brethren owning  one Father in heaven.                                   - - - - -    Once again, for the purpose of taking away all solitariness of feeling,  and of connecting myself, albeit only in fancy, with the proper gladness  of the time, let me think of the comfortable family dinners now being  drawn to a close, of the good wishes uttered, and the presents made,  quite valueless in themselves, yet felt to be invaluable from the  feelings from which they spring; of the little children, by sweetmeats  lapped in Elysium; and of the pantomime, pleasantest Christmas sight of  all, with the pit a sea of grinning delight, the boxes a tier of beaming  juvenility, the galleries, piled up to the far-receding roof, a mass of  happy laughter which a clown's joke brings down in mighty avalanches. In  the pit, sober people relax themselves, and suck oranges, and quaff  ginger-pop; in the boxes, Miss, gazing through her curls, thinks the  Fairy Prince the prettiest creature she ever beheld, and Master, that to  be a clown must be the pinnacle of human happiness: while up in the  galleries the hard literal world is for an hour sponged out and  obliterated; the chimney-sweep forgets, in his delight when the  policeman comes to grief, the harsh call of his master, and Cinderella,  when the demons are foiled, and the long parted lovers meet and embrace  in a paradise of light and pink gauze, the grates that must be scrubbed  to-morrow. All bands and trappings of toil are for one hour loosened by  the hands of imaginative sympathy. What happiness a single theatre can  contain! And those of maturer years, or of more meditative temperament,  sitting at the pantomime, can extract out of the shifting scenes  meanings suitable to themselves; for the pantomime is a symbol or  adumbration of human life. Have we not all known Harlequin, who rules  the roast, and has the pretty Columbine to himself? Do we not all know  that rogue of a clown with his peculating fingers, who brazens out of  every scrape, and who conquers the world by good humour and ready wit?

Phebe! _Phe-e-be_ Hall!\" in tones both fine       and coarse.  Enough to make a drover hoarse.    Now Phebe, over at the farm,  Was sitting, sewing, snug and warm;  But hearing, as she thought, her name,  Sprang up, and to the rescue came;  Beheld the scene, and thus she thought:  \"If now a kitchen chair were brought,  And I could reach the lady's foot,  I'd draw her downward by the boot,  Then cut the rope, and let him go;  He cannot miss the pile of snow.\"  He sees her moving toward his wife.  Armed with a chair and carving-knife,  And, ere he is aware, perceives  His head ascending to the eaves;  And, guessing what the two are at,  Screams from beneath the roof, \"Stop that!  You make me fall too far, by half!\"  But Phebe answers, with a laugh,  \"Please tell a body by what right  You've brought your wife to such a plight!\"  And then, with well-directed blows,  She cuts the rope and down he goes.  The wife untied, they walk around  When lo! no Stephen can be found.  They call in vain, run to and fro;  They look around, above, below;  No trace or token can they see,  And deeper grows the mystery.  Then Rachel's heart within her sank;  But, glancing at the snowy bank,  She caught a little gleam of hope,--  A gentle movement of the rope.  They scrape away a little snow;  What's this? A hat! Ah! he's below;  Then upward heaves the snowy pile,  And forth he stalks in tragic style,  Unhurt, and with a roguish smile;  And Rachel sees, with glad surprise,  The missing found, the fallen rise.        _Rev. Henry Reeves._          Jane Conquest      About the time of Christmas    (Not many months ago),      When the sky was black      With wrath and rack,    And the earth was white with snow,  When loudly rang the tumult    Of winds and waves of strife,      In her home by the sea,      With her babe on her knee,    Sat Harry Conquest's wife.    And he was on the ocean,    Although she knew not where,      For never a lip      Could tell of the ship,    To lighten her heart's despair.  And her babe was fading and dying;    The pulse in the tiny wrist      Was all but still,      And the brow was chill,    And pale as the white sea mist.    Jane Conquest's heart was hopeless;    She could only weep and pray      That the Shepherd mild      Would take her child    Without a pain away.  The night was dark and darker,    And the storm grew stronger still,      And buried in deep      And dreamless sleep    Lay the hamlet under the hill.    The fire was dead on the hearthstone    Within Jane Conquest's room,      And still sat she,      With her babe on her knee,    At prayer amid the gloom.  When, borne above the tempest,    A sound fell on her ear,      Thrilling her through,      For well she knew    'Twas the voice of mortal fear.    And a light leaped in at the lattice,    Sudden and swift and red;      Crimsoning all,      The whited wall,    And the floor, and the roof o'erhead.  For one brief moment, heedless    Of the babe upon her knee,      With the frenzied start      Of a frightened heart,    Upon her feet rose she.    And through the quaint old casement    She looks upon the sea;      Thank God that the sight      She saw that night    So rare a sight should be!  Hemmed in by many a billow    With mad and foaming lip,      A mile from shore,      Or hardly more,    She saw a gallant ship.    And to her horror she beheld it    Aflame from stem to stern;      For there seemed no speck      On all that wreck    Where the fierce fire did not burn;  Till the night was like a sunset,    And the sea like a sea of blood,      And the rocks and shore      Were bathed all o'er    And drenched with the gory flood.    She looked and looked, till the terror    Went creeping through every limb;      And her breath came quick,      And her heart grew sick,    And her sight grew dizzy and dim;  And her lips had lost their utterance,    For she tried but could not speak;      And her feelings found      No channel of sound    In prayer, or sob, or shriek.    Once more that cry of anguish    Thrilled through the tempest's strife,      And it stirred again      In heart and brain    The active thinking life;  And the light of an inspiration    Leaped to her brightened eye,      And on lip and brow      Was written now    A purpose pure and high.    Swiftly she turns, and softly    She crosses the chamber floor,      And faltering not,      In his tiny cot    She laid the babe she bore.  And then with a holy impulse,    She sank to her knees, and made      A lowly prayer,      In the silence there,    And this was the prayer she prayed:    \"O Christ, who didst bear the scourging,    And who now dost wear the crown,      I at Thy feet,      O True and Sweet,    Would lay my burden down.  Thou bad'st me love and cherish    The babe Thou gavest me,      And I have kept      Thy word, nor stept    Aside from following Thee.    \"And lo! my boy is dying!    And vain is all my care;      And my burden's weight      Is very great,    Yea, greater than I can bear!  O Lord, Thou know'st what peril    Doth threat these poor men's lives,      And I, a woman,      Most weak and human,    Do plead for their waiting wives.    \"Thou canst not let them perish;    Up, Lord, in Thy strength, and save      From the scorching breath      Of this terrible death    On this cruel winter wave.  Take Thou my babe and watch it,    No care is like to Thine;      And let Thy power      In this perilous hour    Supply what lack is mine.\"    And so her prayer she ended,    And rising to her feet,      Gave one long look      At the cradle nook    Where the child's faint pulses beat;  And then with softest footsteps    Retrod the chamber floor,      And noiselessly groped      For the latch, and oped,    And crossed the cottage door.    And through the tempest bravely    Jane Conquest fought her way,      By snowy deep      And slippery steep    To where her duty lay.  And she journeyed onward, breathless,    And weary and sore and faint,      Yet forward pressed      With the strength, and the zest,    And the ardor of a saint.    Solemn, and weird, and lonely    Amid its countless graves,      Stood the old gray church      On its tall rock perch,    Secure from the sea and its waves;  And beneath its sacred shadow    Lay the hamlet safe and still;      For however the sea      And the wind might be,    There was quiet under the hill.    Jane Conquest reached the churchyard,    And stood by the old church door,      But the oak was tough      And had bolts enough,    And her strength was frail and poor;  So she crept through a narrow window,    And climbed the belfry stair,      And grasped the rope,      Sole cord of hope,    For the mariners in despair.    And the wild wind helped her bravely,    And she wrought with an earnest will,      And the clamorous bell      Spoke out right well    To the hamlet under the hill.  And it roused the slumbering fishers,    Nor its warning task gave o'er      Till a hundred fleet      And eager feet    Were hurrying to the shore.    And then it ceased its ringing,    For the woman's work was done,      And many a boat      That was now afloat    Showed man's work had begun.  But the ringer in the belfry    Lay motionless and cold,      With the cord of hope.      The church-bell rope,    Still in her frozen hold.    How long she lay it boots not,    But she woke from her swoon at last      In her own bright room.      To find the gloom,    And the grief, and the peril past,  With the sense of joy within her,    And the Christ's sweet presence near;      And friends around,      And the cooing sound    Of her babe's voice in her ear.    And they told her all the story,    How a brave and gallant few      O'ercame each check,      And reached the wreck,    And saved the hopeless crew.  And how the curious sexton    Had climbed the belfry stair,      And of his fright      When, cold and white,    He found her lying there;    And how, when they had borne her    Back to her home again,      The child she left      With a heart bereft    Of hope, and weary with pain,  Was found within his cradle    In a quiet slumber laid;      With a peaceful smile      On his lips the while,    And the wasting sickness stayed.    And she said \"Twas the Christ who watched it,    And brought it safely through\";      And she praised His truth      And His tender ruth    Who had saved her darling too.          Nathan Hale      To drum beat and heart beat,    A soldier marches by,  There is color in his cheek,    There is courage in his eye;  Yet to drum beat and heart beat,    In a moment he must die.    By starlight and moonlight,    He seeks the Britons' camp;  He hears the rustling flag,    And the armed sentry's tramp;  And the starlight and moonlight    His silent wanderings lamp.    With a slow tread and still tread,    He scans the tented line,  And he counts the battery guns    By the gaunt and shadowy pine,  And his slow tread and still tread    Gives no warning sign.    The dark wave, the plumed wave,    It meets his eager glance;  And it sparkles 'neath the stars,    Like the glimmer of a lance--  A dark wave, a plumed wave,    On an emerald expanse.    A sharp clang, a steel clang,    And terror in the sound!  For the sentry, falcon-eyed,    In the camp a spy has found;  With a sharp clang, a steel clang,    The patriot is bound.    With calm brow, steady brow,    He listens to his doom.  In his look there is no fear,    Nor a shadow trace of gloom,  But with calm brow, steady brow,    He robes him for the tomb.    In the long night, the still night,    He kneels upon the sod;  And the brutal guards withhold    E'en the solemn word of God!  In the long night, the still night,    He walks where Christ hath trod.    'Neath the blue morn, the sunny morn,    He dies upon the tree;  And he mourns that he can give    But one life for liberty;  And in the blue morn, the sunny morn    His spent wings are free."]]]
