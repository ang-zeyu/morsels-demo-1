The Parisians generally are a remarkably persevering and industrious  people, amongst the trading classes, particularly the women, who often  take as ostensible a part in business as their husbands; except that it  is an establishment upon a very large scale, the wife is usually the  cashier, and you will find her as stationary at the counter almost as  the counter itself. The idea that exists in England with respect to  married women in France is quite erroneous, for more domestic and stay  at home is impossible to be, that is amongst the middle classes; the  same remark applies to the lower orders. As to the higher classes they  never can be cited as forming a characteristic in any country; receiving  a highly finished education, they are all brought to the same degree of  polish, and the primitive features are entirely effaced. Good nature is  a very conspicuous trait in the French character, and that is  continually displayed towards any foreigner; ask your way in the street  in a polite manner, and generally the persons become interested in your  finding the place you want, and if they do not know themselves, they  will go into a shop and enquire for you, and not feel easy until they  have ascertained it for you, but it depends much upon the manner in  which you address them. A Doctor Smith related to me a circumstance  which proves how different is the effect of a courteous and an  uncourteous mode of speaking to a Frenchman; the Doctor had with him a  friend who was a regular John Bull, and they wishing to know their way  to some place, the latter stepped up to a butcher who was standing at  his door and asked him in a very rough manner, and received an evasive  reply; the Doctor then put the same question to the man but in a more  polite form, the butcher replied, \"If you will wait a minute, Sir, I  will put on my coat and show you the way,\" which he did in the most good  humoured manner, but remarked to the Doctor that every one in France  liked to be treated as a fellow man, and not to be spoken to as if they  were brutes. Thus it appears that even butchers in France expect to be  treated with some degree of politeness.    The women are still more tenacious in that respect than the men; they  consider, even down to a housemaid, that their sex demands a certain  tone of deference, however humble their position, and if a nobleman did  not touch his hat to them when they open or shut the door for them, with  the usual salutation of good day or good morning, they would pronounce  his manners brutal, and say, that although he was a man of title he was  not a gentleman; hence the very unceremonious manner that an Englishman  has of addressing servants, whether male or female, has kept them very  much out of favour with that class of the French community. A scullion,  or what may be termed a girl of all work, that has not met with that  degree of respect from some of our countrymen to which she considered  herself entitled, will remark, that the English may be very rich, but  they certainly are not enlightened as we are, with a little drawing up  of the head, implying their consciousness of superiority over us  semi-barbarians; your charwoman, your washerwoman's drudge, fishwoman,  or girl that cries turf about the streets, are all Madame and  Mademoiselle when they speak of each other, and with them there is no  such word as woman; if a female, she must be a lady, even if her  occupation be to pick up rags in the street. The French women certainly  excel in the art of dress and everything which appertains to the  decoration of the person, but the devotion which exists amongst them to  that passion tends greatly towards frivolising the mind; hence I find  their inferiority, generally speaking, to English women; in the latter  you will often meet, even amongst the middle classes, with a girl who  has received a good education; forming her pleasures from pursuits which  are purely intellectual, she will not only find enjoyment in that light  reading merely calculated to amuse, or that kind of music which consists  of pretty quadrilles, a few trifling songs, and two or three lessons  adapted for the display of execution, or that style of poetry and of  painting which is something of the same nature, just fit to please the  fancy without touching the heart; no, you will find that she enters into  the very soul of those mental recreations, nor does that interfere with  her domestic virtues; she is equally capable of performing every social  duty, but she devotes not so considerable a portion of her time and  thoughts to dress, nor is she so totally absorbed in the anticipation  and retrospection of balls and soirees, to the exclusion of every other  feeling, as long as the season for parties continues, which is but too  much the case with females in Paris, except with those whose business or  occupations prevent them from participating otherwise than very  sparingly in the gaieties of that description; but the class I allude  to in France, is that which consists of persons of independent fortune,  who have never been connected with anything in the shape of trade or  even professions, except army or navy, yet whose property is too small  to estimate them as belonging to the higher classes, whilst they would  consider themselves as degraded by an association with even the richer  tradespeople, generally coming under the denomination of middle classes.  This grade, immediately below the highest classes and above the middle,  is very numerous in Paris, their incomes varying from four hundred to a  thousand a-year; with the females in this class there is an exact  resemblance to those of the class above, only the sphere is more  confined; their education finished, they retain but little of what they  have learned, except dancing, singing, and music, because they are  calculated for display, and tell in society; drawing is laid aside, even  after much proficiency had been acquired, reading confined to the  reviews of the popular works of the day, the inexhaustible subjects of  conversation are the toilet, which is pre-eminent, balls, soirees, and  public places; if literature be introduced, you will find their  knowledge of it sufficient to escape the charge of ignorance,  particularly in history, as great pains are now taken with their  education, and which certainly is of the best description, whilst there  is a grace and sweetness of manner which is highly captivating; yet when  you become well acquainted with these ladies, whose surface was  enchanting, you find at last a want of soul. As a proof how seldom I  have found French females express any delight in beholding all the  phenomena of an extensive and beautiful country, and if the mind be dead  to that charm, how must it be lost to the enjoyments of descriptive  poetry and painting, as if the reality afford not pleasure how little  can be derived from the representation; I have found in France many  exceptions to this rule, women, in fact, whose society afforded a highly  intellectual treat. But they are rare, and when one speaks of a people  generally, the mass must be stated and not the exceptions. In England,  even amongst the classes of the highest fashion, many women are to be  met with, who, notwithstanding that they are whirled about in London for  months together to parties every night, sometimes to three or four in an  evening, to hear and say the nothings that pass current in assemblages  of that description, both deteriorating to health and mind, yet on  returning to their seats in the country, whilst the husband is following  the sports of the field, the females will have recourse to intellectual  occupations, and cultivate those seeds of knowledge which had been  instilled into their minds during their early youth, thus conferring  upon them those companionable powers, which are the great charm of life;  the rural scenes around them call their pencils into practice, whilst  the true spirit of poetry constantly appears to their feelings in the  forms of those beauties of nature which in fact are its life and soul.  Embosomed in the calm retirement found in such retreats, the various  objects in view engender the love of reading; hence the Englishwoman  recruits her mental powers after the frivolizing effects of a season in  town. The Frenchwoman goes into the country for the purpose of enjoying  the fresh air, she reads a little to kill time, and occupies much of it  with her embroidery and other fancy works, and after a short period  passed amongst the vine-clad hills, sighs once more to return to her  dear Paris, complains of ennui, wonders what the fashions will be at the  next Longchamp, and whether they will be such as become her or not, but  feeling herself bound to wear whatever may be pronounced the modes, and  trusts to her taste to arrange it in such a manner as to set her off to  the best advantage.    My countrywomen are not so much slaves to fashion and do not care to put  on every thing that comes out, if they think it does not suit them, but  it must be admitted that they have not the same taste as the French in  regard to costume; it is a quality that is peculiar to them, and  acknowledged by all the civilised world; in England, Russia, even  Greece, ladies of the high ton must send to Paris for their hats and  bonnets, and have them from Madame de Barennes, in the _Place Vendome_,  which is not merely an idea, but a fact that they really are replete  with that exquisite taste for which they are so justly famed; even the  manner in which her lofty and noble saloons are arranged display an  elegance of conception, there is a chasteness which pervades the whole,  the furniture as Well as the decorations of the room are either of  white or ebony and gold, preserving that degree of keeping which is  inseparable from a truly classical taste.    I must confess that the most refined,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17763"],[0,"The Mystery of the Hasty Arrow (#20)"],[1,"collects.    \"He already has, as you will remember, the arrow hidden somewhere about  his person, and it is only a few steps to the edge of the tapestry behind  which he has secreted the bow. If he takes a look opposite, it is at the  moment when both Mrs. Taylor and Miss Willetts are screened from his view  by one of the partitions separating the various sections. For unless he  felt the way to be free for his arrow, he would never have proceeded to  slip behind his chosen pedestal, secure the bow, pause to string it, then  crouch for his aim in such apparent confidence. For after he has left the  open gallery and limited his outlook to what is visible beyond the  loophole through which he intends to shoot, he can see--as we know from  Mr. La Fleche--little more than the spot where the cap hangs and the one  narrow line between. Unhappily, it was across this line the young girl  leaped just as the arrow left the bow. Don't you see it, sir? I do; and I  see what follows, too.\"    \"The escape of X?\"    \"Yes. Inadvertently, as you see, he has committed a horrible crime; he  can never recall it. Whatever his remorse or shame, nothing will ever  restore the victim of his folly to life, while he himself has many days  before him--days which would be ruined if his part in this tragedy were  known. Shall he confess to it, then, or shall he fly (the way is so  easy), and leave it to fate to play his game--fate, whose well-known  kindness to fools would surely favor him? It does not take long for such  thoughts to pass through a man's head, and before the dying cry of his  innocent victim had ceased to echo through those galleries, he is behind  the tapestry and on his way toward the court. Beyond that, my dream does  not go. How about yours, sir?\"    \"My dream was of a crime, not of an accident. No man could be such a fool  as you have made out this X of yours to be. Only an extraordinary purpose  or some imperious necessity could drive a man to shoot an arrow across an  open court where people were passing hither and yon, even if he didn't  see anyone in the gallery.\"    \"By which you mean----\"    \"That he had already marked the approach of his victim and was ready with  his weapon.\"    \"You are undoubtedly right, and I only wish to say this: that the purpose  in my relation was merely to show the method and manner of this shooting,  leaving _you_ to put on the emphasis of crime if you saw fit.\"    The gravity with which Mr. Gryce received this suggestion had the effect  of slightly embarrassing Sweetwater. Yet he presently ventured to add  after a moment of respectful waiting:    \"Did you know that after I woke from my dream I had a moment's doubt as  to its accuracy on one point? The bow was undoubtedly flung behind the  curtain, but the man----\"    He paused abruptly. A morsel of clean white paper had just been pushed  across the table under his eyes, and a peremptory voice was saying:    \"Write me his name. I will do the same for you.\"          XIV    A LOOP OF SILK      Sweetwater hesitated.    \"I am very fond of the one of your own choosing,\" he smiled, \"but if you  insist----\"    Mr. Gryce was already writing.    In another moment the two slips were passed in exchange across the table.    Instantly, a simultaneous exclamation left the lips of both.    Each read a name he was in no wise prepared to see. They had been  following diverging lines instead of parallel ones; and it took some few  minutes for them to adjust themselves to this new condition.    Then Mr. Gryce spoke:    \"What led you into loading up Correy with an act which to accept as true  would oblige us to deny every premise we have been at such pains to  establish?\"    \"Because--and I hope you will pardon me, Mr. Gryce, since our conclusions  are so different--I found it easier to attribute this deed of folly--or  crime, if we can prove it such--to a man young in years than to one old  enough to know better.\"    \"Very good; that is undoubtedly an excellent reason.\"    As this was said with an accent we will for want of a better word call  _dry_, Sweetwater, hardy as he was, flushed to his ears. But then any  prick from Mr. Gryce went very deep with him.    \"Perhaps,\" he ventured, \"you will give even less indulgence to what I  have to add in way of further excuse.\"    \"I shall have to hear it first.\"    \"Correy is a sport, an incorrigible one; it is his only weakness. He  bets like an Englishman--not for the money, for the sums he risks are  small, but for the love of it--the fun--the transient excitement It  might be\"--here Sweetwater's words came slowly and with shamefaced  pauses--\"that the shooting of that arrow--I believe I said something like  this before--was the result of a dare.\"    A halt took place in the quick tattoo which Mr. Gryce's fingers were  drumming out on the table-top. It was infinitesimal in length, but it  gave Sweetwater courage to add:    \"Then, I hear that he wishes to marry a rich girl and shrinks from  proposing to her on account of his small salary.\"    \"What has that got to do with it?\"    \"Nothing so far as I can see. I am only elaborating the meager report  lying there under your hand. But I recognize my folly. You ordered me  to dream, and I did so. Cannot we forget my unworthy vaporings and enter  upon the consideration of what may prove more profitable?\"    Here he glanced down at the slip of paper he himself held--the slip which  Mr. Gryce had handed him with a single word written on it, and that word  a name.    \"In a moment,\" was Mr. Gryce's answer. \"First explain to me how, with the  facts all in mind, and your chart before your eyes, you reconciled  Correy's position on the side staircase two minutes after the shooting  with your theory of a quick escape to the court by means of the door back  of the tapestry? Haven't you hurried matters to get him so far in such a  short space of time?\"    \"Mr. Gryce, I have heard you say yourself that this question of time has  been, from the first, our greatest difficulty. Even with these three  means of escape in our minds, it is difficult to see how it was possible  for anyone to get from the gallery to the court in the minute or so  elapsing between the cry of the dying girl and the appearance at her side  of the man studying coins in the adjoining section.\"    \"You are right. There was a delay somewhere, as we shall find later on.  But granting this delay, a man would have to move fast to go the full  length of the court from the Curator's room even in the time which this  small delay might afford him. But perhaps you cut this inextricable knot  by locating Correy somewhere else than where he placed himself at the  making of the chart.\"    \"No, I cut it in another way. You remember my starting to tell you just  now how, in my dissatisfaction with a certain portion of my dream, I  refused to believe in the escape of my Mr. X by the way of the Curator's  office. The tapestry was lifted, the bow flung behind, but the man  stepped back instead of forward. An open flight along the gallery  commended itself more to him than the doubtful one previously arranged  for. If you will accept that for fact, which of course you will not, it  is easy to see how Correy might have been somewhere on that staircase  when the inspiration came to turn the appearance of flight into a show  of his own innocence, by a quick rush back into the further gallery  and a consequent loud-mouthed alarm. But I see that I am but getting  deeper and deeper in the quagmire of a bad theory badly stated. I am  forgetting----\"    \"Many things, Sweetwater. I will only mention a very simple one. The  man who shot the arrow wore gloves. You wouldn't attribute any such  extraordinary precaution as that to a fellow shooting an arrow across  the court on a dare?\"    \"You wouldn't expect it, sir. But in going about the museum that  afternoon, I came upon Correy's coat hanging on its peg. In one of its  pockets was a pair of kid gloves.\"    \"You say the fellow is courting a rich girl,\" suggested Mr. Gryce. \"Under  those circumstances some show of vanity is excusable. Certainly he would  not carry his folly so far as to put on gloves for the shooting match  with which you credit him, unless there was criminal intent back of his  folly--which, of course, would be as hard for you as for me to believe.\"    Sweetwater winced, but noting the kindly twinkle with which Mr. Gryce  softened the bitterness of this lesson, he brightened again and listened  with becoming patience as the old man went on to say:    \"To discuss probabilities in connection with this other name seems futile  this morning. The ease with which one can twist the appearances of things  to fit a preconceived theory as exemplified by the effort you have just  made warns us to be chary of pushing one's idea too far without the  firmest of bases to support it. If you find a man's coat showing  somewhere on its lining evidences that there had once been sewed to it a  loop of the exact dimensions of the one I passed over to you last night,  I should consider it a much more telling clue to the personality of X  than a pair of gloves in the pocket of a man who in all probability  intends to finish up the day with a call on the girl he admires.\"    \"I understand.\" Sweetwater was quite himself again. \"But do you know that  this is no easy task you are giving me, Mr. Gryce. Where a man has but  two coats, or three at best, it might not be so hard, perhaps, to get at  them. But some men have a dozen, and if I don't mistake----\"    \"Sweetwater, I meant to give you a task of no little difficulty. It will  keep you out of mischief.\"          XV    NEWS FROM FRANCE      For the next three days the impatience of the public met with nothing  but disappointment. The police were reticent,--more reticent far than  usual,--and the papers, powerless to add to the facts already published,  had little but conjectures to offer.    The hunt for Madame Duclos continued,"]]]
