Were it not for this saving  economy memory would be helpless. So the nurse who is in earnest and  eager to master her new work will not only perceive carefully each  detail of arrangement, but in two or three days at most will know each  patient there; she will have worked out a system of associations,  remembering not a meaningless name, but an individual with certain  characteristics which she ties up with her name, and so gives it a  definite personality. She thereafter recalls not merely a patient, but a  very special patient; and as she comes to mind she brings a title with  her, which is her symbol. Likewise when her name is spoken or thought,  she herself comes into the nurse's immediate consciousness. A bed in a  certain part of the room will be no longer merely a bed, but  Mrs. Brown's bed. Remembering can be made easy by using some such method  as this:    The first bed to the right as you enter is Mrs. Meade's. She is the  woman with the broken hip. The next is Mrs. Blake's, that blonde, big  woman who wants more attention than any one else. The third is  Mrs. Bunting's. She has wonderful, curling black hair, and a nice  response to everything done for her. The next beyond is Mrs. O'Neil's.  She looks as Irish as her name sounds, and you will remember her by  that. So each bed comes to mean a certain patient, and each patient  comes to suggest the ones on either side of her--her neighbors.  Blondeness and bigness together call Mrs. Blake to mind. Broken hip  means Mrs. Meade, etc. Each individual on that side of the ward becomes  associated with a name which stands for definite characteristics.    Then you begin at the left bed nearest the door and follow the occupants  back on that side. You may remember better by jotting them down in  order of the beds, with names and a brief comment on each patient. Keep  that list on a small card in your pocket for reference for a day or two,  then depend on memory entirely. I have personally found this an  excellent method.    You are expected to be able to turn quickly to any medicines needed in  emergency, and you soon learn to remember them and where they are placed  by the arrangement into classes or kinds, which most hospitals require.  Cathartics are together, hypnotics together, etc. So when you want  _cascara_ you associate it with cathartic and turn to that shelf. You  learn very soon that poison medicines are kept apart from the others,  and quickly associate the _poison_ label with danger to patients,  necessity of locking safely away and hiding the key from any but those  responsible for the care of the sick.    Learning to look closely at the patient's face, instead of casually  glancing at her when you care for her, makes it possible for you to note  changes of expression, heightened color, dilated pupils, a trace of  strain, etc. Then try to find the exact word that will express what you  see. Such experiments in perception and attention, association and  memory, repeatedly demanded of yourself--_i. e._, the being able to  recall and describe in detail the room- or ward-arrangements and to  place the patients accurately, as we have just described--will prove  invaluable practice, helping you to attend to every change in your  patient's demeanor and expression, which may prove significant symptoms.  And remember that while the mind can only contain so many isolated  facts, yet there is no limit to its possibilities when the power of  association of ideas is employed.    Your first step to clear thinking is accuracy of perception, with  attention to the thing reason chooses; your second is association of the  things perceived, a grouping of them to fit in with each other, and with  what is already in the mind. And both imply the third--concentration,  aided by emotion and will. For passive attention and haphazard  associations assure the opposite of clear thinking.      CONCENTRATION    _How to Study._--You learn sooner or later from experience that the  quickest and best way to learn anything new is to give it your undivided  attention at the moment; to perceive one thing at a time and to perceive  it as something that is definite, or as some quality that is unblurred.  One of you will spend three hours on an anatomy lesson, another two  hours, while a third nurse may give it a half-hour of concentrated study  and know it better than either of you, if you have been day-dreaming, or  talking, or rebelling at the \"luck\" which keeps you indoors learning  about bones, when the tennis-court is so inviting. True, some minds have  better natural equipment and some have better previous training than  others. But the average mind could learn a lesson well in much less time  than is spent upon learning it poorly. Few people hold their attention  strictly to the task at hand if something more interesting beckons, or  if they feel tired, or \"blue.\" But you can learn to do it.    Put aside a certain amount of time today for study; hold your undivided  attention on your lesson, regardless of how many pleasanter things  appeal. When your eyes or your thoughts wander from your note-book,  bring them back forcibly, if need be. Your first task is to keep your  eyes there, instead of letting them follow your roommate's movements, or  resting them by watching the street below. But it is easier to do this  than to make your mind grasp the meaning of the things you see. You may  read two or three pages, and not receive one idea, not even be able to  recall any words from the context. Your eyes are obeying your will and  seeing the words, but your mind is \"wool-gathering.\" Now take yourself  in hand firmly. If you are really a bit fagged, try some deep-breathing  exercises before the open window, bathe your face in cold water. Then  read a paragraph, close your book, and write, if you are not alone, or  repeat to yourself aloud, if your roommate is out, what that paragraph  says--its meaning. If you cannot do it, read it again with that end in  view. Repeat the process, and hold yourself to it day after day, if  necessary, until finally will has won the battle, or, better still,  your will to learn has been reinforced by an interest in the very  competition with yourself, if not yet in the contest. Then, as you learn  some facts from your notes, use your imagination to apply them in real  life.    The triceps muscle. What is it for? Your notes inform you, and then it  is really interesting to see how it performs its function. What origins  and attachments must the triceps have to make it extend the arm? Your  notes say that a muscle tends to draw the part to which it is attached  toward its origin. This triceps muscle straightens the arm. In that case  it must oppose the flexion at the elbow. How is that likely to be done?  The triceps must start somewhere above the elbow, and quite far above,  too, to be able to make a straight angle of an acute one; it must start  toward the back in order to draw back the forearm; and be attached to  the back of the bone below. Also it must be quite a long muscle. So much  reason tells you. Now let me see how it is done, in fact. And you find  that the triceps has three origins high above its one attachment as a  tendon, to give it a good strong pull. These are in the outside of the  humerus and in the scapula. That is logical, and you will remember it.    Now how does the arm bend? What pulls against the triceps? And you are  interested before you know it.    There is nothing, good, bad, or indifferent, but has some points of  interest if the mind turns its entire attention to it. But our tendency  is to grow tired of calling back our wandering thoughts again and again  to the thing that is hard, dry, or stupid. And we need more incentive  than just the doing of the duty because it is to be done. We need a  compelling interest in the goal to encourage our wills to concentration  on the less interesting. Let us first think out the _why_ of knowing  anatomy if we are to be nurses. And if the profession of nursing is the  goal, let anatomy become just the next stretch of the road that leads to  it.    Concentration can be acquired. It may require three hours at first to  learn your lesson; but later on you will do it in two, then in one, and  perhaps in less. And when you can sit down with your notes and learn  them with voices about you--perhaps; with some one else in the room;  with a party an hour ahead; when you can disregard all but the work at  hand, then you can concentrate, and the big battle of your life as a  student is won. Study is no longer drudgery. Lessons occupy much less of  your time and leave you more free hours. Because you give them your  whole mind you learn them in a fraction of the hours hitherto wasted  upon them, when you studied with divided attention. When you are doing  clear thinking on the thing at hand, satisfactory results are assured.      SELF-TRAINING IN MEMORY    Hand in hand with clear thinking goes reliable memory. But so many of us  have it not, and feel its need so strongly that we shall consider for a  moment some means of training it.    William James holds that brain-paths cannot be deepened; that memory is  not strengthened in that way. There is a natural retentiveness with  which some of us are born--the men of colossal intellect--and they  remember and are able to use infinitely more things acquired in the  past, because they have a brain substance of greater tenacity in holding  impressions than others possess. James compares some brains to wax in  which the mark left by the seal is permanent; and others he compares to  jelly which vibrates at every touch, but retains no dent made in it.  From our study of the subconscious we know that the dent did leave an  impression on the brain; but it was in the subconscious. So we beg to  change the figure and liken, in all mankind, that part of the brain that  handles the subconscious"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18845"],[0,"Seeing Europe with Famous Authors, Volume 7 (#20)"],[1,"it was converted into a  baptistery.    This building contains three gates, which have no parallel in the world.  The oldest is that on the southern side, upon which Pisano spent  twenty-two years of his life, a most beautiful work representing, in  twenty compartments, the life of St. John the Baptist. The frieze which  runs round it was commenced nearly a century afterward by Ghiberti, and  Pollaiuolo had much to do with its completion.    The northern gates are by Ghiberti, and, like those of Pisano, are  divided into twenty compartments, the subject being the life of Christ.  The bronze door-posts are delicately carved with flowers, fruit, and  animals. These gates were first placed on the eastern side, but in 1452  were removed to make room for Ghiberti's still finer work.    On the third facade, that which faces the Duomo, is the Porta del  Paradiso, so named by Michael Angelo, who declared that this gate was  worthy to be the entrance into Paradise. Ghiberti divided each panel  into five parts, taking the following as his subjects, after suggestions  made by Leonardo Bruni Aretino: (1) Creation of Adam and Eve; (2) Cain  and Abel; (3) Noah; (4) Abraham and Isaac; (5) Jacob and Esau; (6)  Joseph in Egypt; (7) Moses on Mount Sinai; (8) The Capture of Jericho;  (9) David Slaying Goliath; (10) The Queen of Sheba and Soloman.    The frieze contains statuettes of the prophets and prophetesses and  portrait-busts of men and women still alive, including Ghiberti himself,  and his father; while the frame-posts, with their masses of vegetation  and flora wrought in bronze, are admirable for their truth to nature.  Bronze groups representing the \"Decapitation of St. John the Baptist,\"  by Danti, and the \"Baptism of our Lord,\" by Andrea Sansovino, surmount  two of the gates, which were at one time heavily gilded, tho few traces  of this are now visible.    The Baptistery, empty as it appears to the eye upon first entering it,  is replete with beautiful monuments, a description of which would fill a  good-sized volume. It is built, as I have already said, upon an  octagonal plan. The altar, which formerly stood beneath the cupola, has  been removed. On the 24th of June every year the magnificent retablo in  massive silver, which is preserved among the treasures in the Opera del  Duomo, is displayed in the Baptistery. The silver alone weighs 325  pounds, including two center-pieces, two side-pieces, and a silver  crucifix with two statuettes seven feet high, and weighing 141 pounds,  the group being completed by two statues of Peace in engine-turned  silver. Many artists were employed upon the making of it. Finiguerra,  Pollaiuolo, Cione, Michelozzi, Verrocchio, and Cennini made the lower  parts and the bas-reliefs of the front, while the cross, executed in  1456, is by Betto di Francesco, and the base of it by Milano di Domenico  dei and Antonio Pollaiuolo.    The interior of the cupola of San Giovanni is ornamented with some of  the oldest specimens of mosaic decoration in Florence, these Byzantine  artists being the first, after Murano and Altino, to exercise their  craft in Italy, and being succeeded by Jacopo da Turita, Andrea Tafi,  and Gaddo Gaddi.    The handsome tomb of Baldassare Cossa (Pope John XXIII., deposed at the  time of the Council of Constance), was reared in the Baptistery by  Donatello. The Holy of Holies is relatively modern, having been erected  at the expense of the Guild of the \"Calimala,\" as the men who gave the  finishing touch to the woolen stuffs manufactured abroad were called.  The baptismal font, in a building specially used for christening, would,  as a matter of course, be intrusted to artists of great repute, and that  at San Giovanni is attributed to Andrea Pisano. Upon each face is  represented one of the baptisms most famous in the history of the  Catholic religion, an inscription beneath explaining each episode; but  this font is, unfortunately, so much in the background that it escapes  the notice of many visitors.    Donatello carved the wooden statue of the Magdalen which occupies one of  the niches, the thin emaciated face being typical of the artist's  partiality for reproducing in their smallest details the physical  defects of his subject. The exterior aspect of the Baptistery does not  give one the idea of a building restored in the thirteenth, but rather  in the fifteenth century.          THE PONTE VECCHIO[36]    BY CHARLES YRIARTE      Until the close of 1080 the Ponte Vecchio was built of wood, the heavy  masses of timber, tho offering no steady resistance to the stream,  dividing the muddy course of the waters into a thousand small currents,  and breaking its force. But in 1177 occurred one of those inundations  which were so frequent that traces of them may still be seen on the  walls of the quays. These inundations were one of the curses of  Florence, and tho the evil has been, to a certain extent, cured by the  construction of massive quays, they still occur in the direction of the  Cascine. An attempt was accordingly made in the twelfth century to  obviate this inconvenience by the construction of a stone bridge. This,  in turn, was carried away in 1333, and Taddeo Gaddi, who had already  made a name for himself by his architectural skill, was employed to  build a bridge capable of resisting the highest floods. The present  bridge was therefore erected in 1345, being 330 feet long by 44 wide.    With the double object of obtaining an income for the city and of  introducing a novel feature, shops were built on the two pathways, which  were 16 feet wide, and these were let to the butchers of Florence, thus  realizing the Eastern plan of concentrating the meat trade of a town in  one place. This arrangement lasted from 1422 until 1593, but in the  latter year, under Cosimo I., the \"Capitani di Parte,\" who had the  supervision of the streets and highways, ordered that all the goldsmiths  and jewelers should take the place of the butchers, and in a few months,  the Ponte Vecchio became the wealthiest and most crowded thoroughfare of  Florence. In order to avoid shutting out a view of the stream and  interfering with the perspective, an open space had been reserved in the  center, and when the Palazzo Vecchio and the Uffizi were connected with  the Pitti Palace by means of the large covered way carried over the  bridge, this space was left intact so as to afford a view of the  eminence of San Miniato upon one side, of the windings of the stream on  the other, and of the Cascine shrubberies and the mountains upon the  horizon.          SANTA CROCE[37]    BY CHARLES YRIARTE      Built by Arnolfo, then fifty-four years of age, by order of the Friars  of St. Francis, this venerable temple was raised upon the piazza called  Santa Croce, where formerly stood a small church belonging to the order  of the Franciscan monks. They had resolved to embellish and enlarge  their church, and Cardinal Matteo D'Acquasparta, general of the  Franciscan Order, proclaimed an indulgence to all contributors toward  the undertaking. The church was far enough advanced in 1320 for services  to be held in it, tho the facade was then, as until a very recent period  it remained, a plain brick wall, without facing or any other ornament.  Santa Croce was not singular in this respect, for San Lorenzo and many  other Florentine churches have never been decorated externally.    In 1442 Cardinal Bessarion, the founder of St. Mark's Library at Venice,  was delegated to perform the ceremony of consecration. Donatello and  Ghiberti, incomplete as was the facade, executed some statues and a  stained-glass window for it, but it is only within the last few years  that the city of Florence completed the work, leaving untouched the  grand piazza which had been the scene of so many fetes and intestine  quarrels, and upon which is now erected a statue to Dante. The facade of  Santa Croce was completed in 1863. The expense was principally borne by  Mr. Francis Sloane, an Englishman.    The interior is striking from its vast size, the church being built in  the shape of a Latin cross with nave, aisles, and transepts, each of the  seven pointed arches being supported on the octagonal column. Opposite  the front entrance is the high altar, while all around the walls and  between the side altars--erected in 1557 by Vasari by order of Cosimo  I.--are the monuments of the illustrious dead. First of all on the left  there is Domenico Sestini, a celebrated numismatist, whose bust was  carved by Pozzetti. While in the first chapel on the right is the tomb  of Michael Angelo, who died at Rome on the 17th of February, 1564; the  monument was designed by Vasari, the bust was executed by Battista  Lorenzo. Two contemporary sculptors, Valerio Cioli and Giovanni  Dell'Opera, did the allegories of Sculpture and Architecture, the  frescoes around the monument being by Battista Naldini. A nobler tomb  might well have been raised to the memory of Michael Angelo. The body  was deposited in the church on the 12th of March, 1564, and lay in  state, for the people of Florence to come and pay him the last tribute  of respect.    The next tomb is only commemorative, for it does not contain the ashes  of Dante, in whose honor it was erected in 1829 by Ricci, as a tardy  homage on the part of Florence to one who suffered so much for her sake  in life.[38]    After Dante comes Victor Alfieri, whose name has been borne with  distinction by his descendants. This monument was erected by Canova in  1807. Compared with the monuments of the fifteenth century and of the  Renaissance, which are to be seen in such splendid profusion in  Florence, these tombs seem so inferior that it is impossible not to  wonder how the decadence was brought about. It is not at Florence alone  that this feeling manifests itself; for at Venice, in the splendid  temple of Santa Maria Gloriosa dei Frari, beside the tombs of doges and  condottieri of the"]]]
