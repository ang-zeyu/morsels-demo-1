I have been forty years absent from this country, which is my  native place, as well as my late brother's; and during that time have  travelled into the Indies, Persia, Arabia, Syria, and Egypt; have  resided in the finest towns of those countries; and afterward crossed  over into Africa, where I made a longer stay. At last, as it is natural  for a man to remember his native country, I was desirous to see mine  again, and to embrace my dear brother; and finding I had strength enough  to undertake so long a journey, I immediately made the necessary  preparations, and set out. I will not tell you the length of time it  took me, all the obstacles I met with, and what fatigues I have endured  to come hither; but nothing ever afflicted me so much, as hearing of my  brother's death. I observed his features in the face of my nephew, your  son, and distinguished him among a number of lads with whom he was at  play; he can tell you how I received the most melancholy news that ever  reached my ears. But God be praised for all things! it is a comfort for  me to find, as it were, my brother in a son, who has his most remarkable  features.\"    The African magician, perceiving that the widow began to weep at the  remembrance of her husband, changed the conversation, and turning toward  her son, asked him his name. \"I am called Aladdin,\" said he. \"Well,  Aladdin,\" replied the magician, \"what business do you follow? Are you of  any trade?\"    At this question the youth hung down his head, and was not a little  abashed when his mother answered: \"Aladdin is an idle fellow; his  father, when alive, strove all he could to teach him his trade, but  could not succeed; and since his death he does nothing but idle away his  time in the streets, as you saw him, without considering he is no longer  a child; and if you do not make him ashamed of it, I despair of his ever  coming to any good. He knows that his father left him no fortune, and  sees me endeavour to get bread by spinning cotton; for my part, I am  resolved one of these days to turn him out of doors, and let him provide  for himself.\"    After these words, Aladdin's mother burst into tears; and the magician  said: \"This is not well, nephew; you must think of getting your  livelihood. There are many sorts of trades, consider if you have not an  inclination to some of them; perhaps you did not like your father's and  would prefer another; come, do not disguise your sentiments from me; I  will endeavour to help you.\" But finding that Aladdin returned no  answer, \"If you have no mind,\" continued he, \"to learn any handicraft, I  will take a shop for you, furnish it with all sorts of fine stuffs and  linens; and with the money you make of them lay in fresh goods, and then  you will live in an honourable way. Consult your inclination, and tell  me freely what you think of my proposal.\"    This plan greatly flattered Aladdin, who hated work but had sense enough  to know that such shops were much frequented and the owners respected.  He told the magician he had a greater inclination to that business than  to any other, and that he should be much obliged to him for his  kindness. \"Since this profession is agreeable to you,\" said the African  magician, \"I will carry you with me to-morrow, clothe you as handsomely  as the best merchants in the city, and afterward we will think of  opening a shop as I mentioned.\"    The widow, who never till then could believe that the magician was her  husband's brother, no longer doubted after his promises of kindness to  her son. She thanked him for his good intentions; and after having  exhorted Aladdin to render himself worthy of his uncle's favour by good  behaviour, served up supper, at which they talked of several indifferent  matters; and then the magician, who saw that the night was pretty far  advanced, took his leave, and retired.    He came again the next day, as he had promised, and took Aladdin with  him to a merchant, who sold all sorts of clothes for different ages and  ranks ready made, and a variety of fine stuffs. He asked to see some  that suited Aladdin in size; and Aladdin, charmed with the liberality of  his new uncle, made choice of one, and the magician immediately paid for  it.    When the boy found himself so handsomely equipped, he returned his uncle  thanks; who promised never to forsake him, but always to take him along  with him; which he did to the most frequented places in the city, and  particularly where the principal merchants kept their shops. When he  brought him into the street where they sold the richest stuffs and  finest linens, he said to Aladdin: \"As you are soon to be a merchant, it  is proper you should frequent these shops, and be acquainted with them.\"  He then showed him the largest and finest mosques, carried him to the  khans or inns where the merchants and travellers lodged, and afterward  to the sultan's palace, where he had free access; and at last brought  him to his own khan, where, meeting with some merchants he had become  acquainted with since his arrival, he gave them a treat, to bring them  and his pretended nephew acquainted.    This entertainment lasted till night, when Aladdin would have taken  leave of his uncle to go home, but the magician would not let him go by  himself, but conducted him to his mother, who, as soon as she saw him so  well dressed, was transported with joy, and bestowed a thousand  blessings upon the magician, for being at so great an expense for her  child. \"Generous relation!\" said she, \"I know not how to thank you for  your liberality! I wish you may live long enough to witness my son's  gratitude, which he cannot better shew than by regulating his conduct by  your good advice.\"    \"Aladdin,\" replied the magician, \"is a good boy, and I believe we shall  do very well; but I am sorry for one thing, which is, that I cannot  perform to-morrow what I promised, because, as it is Friday, the shops  will be shut up, and therefore we cannot hire or furnish one till  Saturday. I will, however, call on him to-morrow and take him to walk in  the gardens, where people of the best fashion generally resort. Perhaps  he has never seen these amusements, he has only hitherto been among  children; but now he must see men.\" The African magician then took his  leave of the mother and the son, and retired.    Aladdin rose early the next morning, dressed himself to be ready, and  after he had waited some time began to be impatient and stood watching  at the door; but as soon as he perceived his uncle coming, he told his  mother, took his leave of her, and ran to meet him.    The magician caressed Aladdin, and said: \"Come, my dear child, and I  will shew you fine things.\" He then led him out at one of the gates of  the city, to some magnificent palaces, to each of which belonged  beautiful gardens, into which anybody might enter. At every building he  came to, he asked Aladdin if he did not think it fine; and the youth was  ready to answer when any one presented itself, crying out: \"Here is a  finer house, uncle, than any we have seen yet.\" By this artifice, the  cunning magician led Aladdin some way into the country; and as he meant  to carry him farther, pretending to be tired, he took an opportunity to  sit down in one of the gardens on the brink of a fountain of clear  water, which discharged itself by a lion's mouth of bronze into a basin:  \"Come, nephew,\" said he, \"you must be weary as well as I; let us rest  ourselves, and we shall be better able to pursue our walk.\"    After they had sat down, the magician pulled from his girdle a  handkerchief with cakes and fruit, which he had provided, and laid them  on the edge of the basin. He broke a cake in two, gave one half to  Aladdin and ate the other himself; and in regard to the fruit, left him  at liberty to take which sort he liked best. During this short repast,  he exhorted his nephew to leave off keeping company with vagabonds, and  seek that of wise and prudent men, to improve by their conversation;  \"For,\" said he, \"you will soon be at man's estate, and you cannot too  early begin to imitate their example.\" When they had eaten as much as  they liked, they pursued their walk through gardens separated from one  another only by small ditches, which marked out the limits without  interrupting the communication; so great was the confidence the  inhabitants reposed in each other. By this means, the African magician  drew Aladdin insensibly beyond the gardens, and crossed the country,  till they nearly reached the mountains.    Aladdin, who had never been so far before, began to find himself much  tired, and said to the magician: \"Where are we going, uncle? We have  left the gardens a great way behind us, and I see nothing but mountains;  if we go much farther, I do not know whether I shall be able to reach  the town again!\" \"Never fear, nephew,\" said the false uncle; \"I will  shew you another garden which surpasses all we have yet seen; and when  we come there, you will say that you would have been sorry to have been  so nigh, and not seen it.\" Aladdin was soon persuaded; and the magician,  to make the way seem shorter and less fatiguing, told him a great many  stories.    At last they arrived between two mountains of moderate height, and equal  size, divided by a narrow valley, which was the place where the magician  intended to execute the design that had brought him from Africa to  China. \"We will go no farther now,\" said he to Aladdin: \"I will shew you  here some extraordinary things, which, when you have seen, you will  thank me for: but while I strike a light, gather up all the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20924"],[0,"Ely Cathedral (#20)"],[1,", and instead of the figure of a saint  on the apex each terminates in a group of three elaborately carved  brackets or corbels, which support two other ranges of niches in  pairs, surmounted by ornamented canopies, and between them runs a  roof-shaft, from which spring the ribs of the vaulting, which is  similar to that of the stalled Choir. The spandrils of the tabernacle  work is filled with diaper work and alto relievos which are supposed  to represent some legendary history, most probably that of the virgin.    The south side is similar to the north, except that the range of  tabernacles is broken by doorways. The west end contains eight of  these tabernacles, and at the east end a larger niche occupied the  centre with others on the sides, but these were altered at a later  period. The altar is elevated above the level of the floor, and the  niches on the side walls are raised in accordance. Large niches are  placed on the sides of all the windows, and a pierced parapet standing  on an entablature formed of a receding hollow, runs under the side  windows only.    The backs of the niches and indeed many parts of the chapel show  remains of rich colouring; the ceiling was painted a rich blue studded  with silver stars, the bosses at the intersections of the ribs  represented flowers, foliage, and grotesque masks, and some of those  along the mid-rib represented emblems of the nativity, crucifixion,  the virgin, &c.; they had been richly coloured and gilded, but, like  other parts of the building, have been defaced and injured; and every  person who sees it must feel a deep regret that so beautiful a  building should ever reach such a stage of desecration.    A few modern monumental tablets are placed on the walls, but they  diminish rather than increase the decoration: some others have been  removed to the entrance, and in 1865 the close pews were taken away  and replaced by open seats; the organ has been enlarged and its  position changed, which does not improve the appearance of the church;  some of the windows have been re-glazed and other improvements  effected. The present Incumbent is the Rev. E.H. Lowe, M.A.    The position of the Lady Chapel here is rather unusual, it is  generally placed at the east end of the Church; but in some few  instances that honourable position was appropriated to the shrine of  the local saint; here it was occupied by the shrine of St. Etheldreda,  whose final resting place was within the apse of the original Choir,  before the Presbytery was built.           *       *       *       *       *    +The Upper parts of the Church.+    To those who may feel disposed to explore the upper parts of the  church, facilities are afforded by a staircase commencing at the  south-west Transept leading to the western Tower; and by another  leading from the north Transept; but permission must be obtained, for  which an application should be made to the Verger in attendance. The  ascent, though tedious, is not dangerous, if due caution be used. Many  parts will be found worthy of attention; the timber work of the  Octagon is a very curious piece of carpentry executed in English oak,  and very massive. A fine view of the interior may be had by standing  against the upper tier of the windows at the east end, and looking  westward; and another from the great Tower, by looking eastward  through one of the openings near the clock face in the Nave. An  extensive view of the surrounding country may be obtained from the  summit of the Tower, exhibiting a complete panorama of the district,  with several churches peeping from among the trees, and the river Ouse  tracing its meandering course towards the sea, while corn-fields,  meadows, and pastures contribute towards the beauty of the scene.      +Exterior of the Cathedral.+    After a careful examination of the interior, the visitor will do well  to look round the exterior. We will continue our observations for his  guidance and assistance, starting from the western front where we  began; or by leaving the Cathedral by the north door into the  church-yard, we turn to the left hand towards the north-west corner of  the building, and proceed eastward.    While we are on the spot it may be well to observe the burial-ground  near us, where lie the remains of generation after generation of  former inhabitants of the town. Reader, let thy foot tread lightly  hereabout, for the dust it presses on is all that remains of the  earthly portion of creatures once breathing and living like yourself.  What a lesson is afforded us when we contemplate, on the one hand the  works of men of ages long past, but still standing as monuments of  their skill and piety, and on the other the graves of the silent dead;  the heads which planned and the hands which executed, where are they?  Long since consigned to earth. All must feel, more or less, the  influence of impressions to which such thoughts and scenes give rise,  and may such feelings cause us to remember that we are but dust, and  that we must, perhaps soon, become as those who lie beneath our feet!         \"Our time is fixed, and all our days are numbered,       How long, how short, we know not.\"--_Blair_.    The church-yard has been closed from burials for some years, and a  cemetery has been formed a short distance from the town for the use of  both parishes, as well as for the precincts which are extra-parochial.  Many of the gravestones have been laid down, others removed, but a few  inscriptions might be found which would afford food for meditation to  those who may feel inclined to examine them.           *       *       *       *       *    At the commencement of our survey we examined the western front, and  will now turn our attention to the remains of the north-west Transept.  Some persons have doubted whether this wing ever existed, but Sir.  G.G. Scott, in his able Lecture on the Cathedral, delivered at the  Etheldreda Festival in October, 1873, gave good reasons for believing  that it was built at the same time as the Tower and the south wing;  and we cannot but think the ruins give strong evidence of its having  been similar in all respects to that on the south side. There is in  this, as in the other, a grand semicircular arch on the eastern side,  and portions of another which probably communicated with some chapel,  of which however there are neither remains nor record. It would appear  that after the fall of the original wing a new building was begun on  the same spot, not however of the same dimensions, and carried but a  few feet and then discontinued. A band of panelling in the western  face of the buttress corresponds with the work on the monument of  Bishop Redman, who died in 1505, but the fall of the Transept took  place some years, probably a century, before that. The arches built  within the original arches of the Tower to afford additional support  are believed to have been erected in the early part of the fifteenth  century.    We have reasons to hope that steps will ere long be taken to raise a  fund towards rebuilding this Transept;[52] which would indeed be a  grand improvement, and worthy the support, not only of the Diocese of  Ely but of the nation at large.    [Footnote 52: At the meeting of the Diocesan Conference at Ely, in  July, 1874, the subject of the Restorations of the Cathedral was  discussed, and the following Resolution passed unanimously.--\"That it  is desirable that a Diocesan Committee of Clergy and Laity, with  Branch Committees in each Archdeaconry, be formed to co-operate with  the Bishop, Dean, and Chapter, for raising funds to carry on the  Restoration of the Cathedral by rebuilding in the first instance,  after the completion of the works now in hand, the north-west  Transept.\"--_Ely Conference Report, 1874._]    A good view of the Nave may be obtained as it is unobstructed through  its whole length. A band of treble billet moulding runs under the  lower windows; a double hatched moulding under the second tier; and  immediately below the parapet is the ornament called the corbel table;  these with the billet moulding round the clerestory windows, are in  excellent preservation. The parapet on the wall of the aisle is  embattled, that above the clerestory windows is plain. Although at one  time battlements ran the whole length on both sides, those on the  north were removed nearly one hundred years ago. The windows in the  clerestory retain their original form, but those of the two lower  tiers have been altered. Over one of the lower windows there appears a  date (1662), probably referring to the period of some important  repairs or alterations on this side. The removal of the ruins of the  old Church of St. Cross, which stood near this spot, took place in  the reign of Elizabeth, when the use of the Lady Chapel was granted to  the parish of Holy Trinity.    We next turn our attention to the Octagon, which forms a grand central  point from which radiate the four principal parts of the church--the  Nave, the Choir, and the north and south arms of the Transept. Here  originally stood a large square Norman Tower, which fell down in 1322,  and was replaced by the present building; it is not an exact octagon,  having four longer sides adjoining the four main portions of the  building, and four shorter sides at the angles. The design was a grand  one, but whether it was ever fully carried out is somewhat doubtful,  the stone-work is carried up to a height a little above the roof of  the Nave, &c., but the Lantern above is of English oak covered with  lead. From a strong buttress, surmounted by a pinnacle, at each of the  angles formed by the walls of the Nave and Choir aisles with those of  the Transept spring two massive flying buttresses, abutting octagonal  turrets at each angle of the Octagon; these turrets were probably  originally designed to be finished with pinnacles, and thus form a  corona; between them runs a pierced parapet formerly surmounted by a "]]]
