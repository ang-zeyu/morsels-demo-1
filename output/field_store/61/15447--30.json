However, my  misfortune soon proved to be a blessing in disguise. A man named  Abelwhite, who had come out there as an indigo-planter, wanted an  overseer to look after his coolies and keep them up to their work.  He  happened to be a friend of our colonel's, who had taken an interest in  me since the accident. To make a long story short, the colonel  recommended me strongly for the post and, as the work was mostly to be  done on horseback, my leg was no great obstacle, for I had enough knee  left to keep good grip on the saddle.  What I had to do was to ride  over the plantation, to keep an eye on the men as they worked, and to  report the idlers.  The pay was fair, I had comfortable quarters, and  altogether I was content to spend the remainder of my life in  indigo-planting.  Mr. Abelwhite was a kind man, and he would often drop  into my little shanty and smoke a pipe with me, for white folk out  there feel their hearts warm to each other as they never do here at  home.    \"Well, I was never in luck's way long.  Suddenly, without a note of  warning, the great mutiny broke upon us.  One month India lay as still  and peaceful, to all appearance, as Surrey or Kent; the next there were  two hundred thousand black devils let loose, and the country was a  perfect hell.  Of course you know all about it, gentlemen,--a deal more  than I do, very like, since reading is not in my line.  I only know  what I saw with my own eyes.  Our plantation was at a place called  Muttra, near the border of the Northwest Provinces.  Night after night  the whole sky was alight with the burning bungalows, and day after day  we had small companies of Europeans passing through our estate with  their wives and children, on their way to Agra, where were the nearest  troops.  Mr. Abelwhite was an obstinate man.  He had it in his head  that the affair had been exaggerated, and that it would blow over as  suddenly as it had sprung up.  There he sat on his veranda, drinking  whiskey-pegs and smoking cheroots, while the country was in a blaze  about him.  Of course we stuck by him, I and Dawson, who, with his  wife, used to do the book-work and the managing.  Well, one fine day  the crash came.  I had been away on a distant plantation, and was  riding slowly home in the evening, when my eye fell upon something all  huddled together at the bottom of a steep nullah.  I rode down to see  what it was, and the cold struck through my heart when I found it was  Dawson's wife, all cut into ribbons, and half eaten by jackals and  native dogs.  A little further up the road Dawson himself was lying on  his face, quite dead, with an empty revolver in his hand and four  Sepoys lying across each other in front of him.  I reined up my horse,  wondering which way I should turn, but at that moment I saw thick smoke  curling up from Abelwhite's bungalow and the flames beginning to burst  through the roof.  I knew then that I could do my employer no good, but  would only throw my own life away if I meddled in the matter.  From  where I stood I could see hundreds of the black fiends, with their red  coats still on their backs, dancing and howling round the burning  house.  Some of them pointed at me, and a couple of bullets sang past  my head; so I broke away across the paddy-fields, and found myself late  at night safe within the walls at Agra.    \"As it proved, however, there was no great safety there, either. The  whole country was up like a swarm of bees.  Wherever the English could  collect in little bands they held just the ground that their guns  commanded.  Everywhere else they were helpless fugitives.  It was a  fight of the millions against the hundreds; and the cruellest part of  it was that these men that we fought against, foot, horse, and gunners,  were our own picked troops, whom we had taught and trained, handling  our own weapons, and blowing our own bugle-calls.  At Agra there were  the 3d Bengal Fusiliers, some Sikhs, two troops of horse, and a battery  of artillery.  A volunteer corps of clerks and merchants had been  formed, and this I joined, wooden leg and all.  We went out to meet the  rebels at Shahgunge early in July, and we beat them back for a time,  but our powder gave out, and we had to fall back upon the city.  Nothing but the worst news came to us from every side,--which is not to  be wondered at, for if you look at the map you will see that we were  right in the heart of it.  Lucknow is rather better than a hundred  miles to the east, and Cawnpore about as far to the south.  From every  point on the compass there was nothing but torture and murder and  outrage.    \"The city of Agra is a great place, swarming with fanatics and fierce  devil-worshippers of all sorts.  Our handful of men were lost among the  narrow, winding streets.  Our leader moved across the river, therefore,  and took up his position in the old fort at Agra.  I don't know if any  of you gentlemen have ever read or heard anything of that old fort.  It  is a very queer place,--the queerest that ever I was in, and I have  been in some rum corners, too.  First of all, it is enormous in size.  I should think that the enclosure must be acres and acres.  There is a  modern part, which took all our garrison, women, children, stores, and  everything else, with plenty of room over.  But the modern part is  nothing like the size of the old quarter, where nobody goes, and which  is given over to the scorpions and the centipedes.  It is all full of  great deserted halls, and winding passages, and long corridors twisting  in and out, so that it is easy enough for folk to get lost in it.  For  this reason it was seldom that any one went into it, though now and  again a party with torches might go exploring.    \"The river washes along the front of the old fort, and so protects it,  but on the sides and behind there are many doors, and these had to be  guarded, of course, in the old quarter as well as in that which was  actually held by our troops.  We were short-handed, with hardly men  enough to man the angles of the building and to serve the guns.  It was  impossible for us, therefore, to station a strong guard at every one of  the innumerable gates.  What we did was to organize a central  guard-house in the middle of the fort, and to leave each gate under the  charge of one white man and two or three natives.  I was selected to  take charge during certain hours of the night of a small isolated door  upon the southwest side of the building.  Two Sikh troopers were placed  under my command, and I was instructed if anything went wrong to fire  my musket, when I might rely upon help coming at once from the central  guard.  As the guard was a good two hundred paces away, however, and as  the space between was cut up into a labyrinth of passages and  corridors, I had great doubts as to whether they could arrive in time  to be of any use in case of an actual attack.    \"Well, I was pretty proud at having this small command given me, since  I was a raw recruit, and a game-legged one at that.  For two nights I  kept the watch with my Punjaubees.  They were tall, fierce-looking  chaps, Mahomet Singh and Abdullah Khan by name, both old fighting-men  who had borne arms against us at Chilian-wallah.  They could talk  English pretty well, but I could get little out of them.  They  preferred to stand together and jabber all night in their queer Sikh  lingo.  For myself, I used to stand outside the gate-way, looking down  on the broad, winding river and on the twinkling lights of the great  city.  The beating of drums, the rattle of tomtoms, and the yells and  howls of the rebels, drunk with opium and with bang, were enough to  remind us all night of our dangerous neighbors across the stream.  Every two hours the officer of the night used to come round to all the  posts, to make sure that all was well.    \"The third night of my watch was dark and dirty, with a small, driving  rain.  It was dreary work standing in the gate-way hour after hour in  such weather.  I tried again and again to make my Sikhs talk, but  without much success.  At two in the morning the rounds passed, and  broke for a moment the weariness of the night. Finding that my  companions would not be led into conversation, I took out my pipe, and  laid down my musket to strike the match. In an instant the two Sikhs  were upon me.  One of them snatched my firelock up and levelled it at  my head, while the other held a great knife to my throat and swore  between his teeth that he would plunge it into me if I moved a step.    \"My first thought was that these fellows were in league with the  rebels, and that this was the beginning of an assault.  If our door  were in the hands of the Sepoys the place must fall, and the women and  children be treated as they were in Cawnpore.  Maybe you gentlemen  think that I am just making out a case for myself, but I give you my  word that when I thought of that, though I felt the point of the knife  at my throat, I opened my mouth with the intention of giving a scream,  if it was my last one, which might alarm the main guard.  The man who  held me seemed to know my thoughts; for, even as I braced myself to it,  he whispered, 'Don't make a noise.  The fort is safe enough.  There are  no rebel dogs on this side of the river.'  There was the ring of truth  in what he said, and I knew that if I raised my voice I was a dead man.  I could read it in the fellow's brown eyes.  I waited, therefore, in  silence, to see what it was that they wanted from me.    \"'Listen to me, Sahib,' said the taller and fiercer of the pair, the  one whom they called Abdullah Khan.  'You must either be with us now or  you must be silenced forever.  The thing is too great a one for us to  hesitate.  Either you are heart and soul with us on your oath on the  cross of the Christians, or your "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20987"],[0,"Story of the War in South Africa, 1899-1900 (#20)"],[1,"to the  enemy to whom it is opposed. This disadvantage is greatest to the  offensive, because to the defensive falls the privilege of increasing  power by choice of position and by fortifying. It was in this dilemma  that the British, in consequence of the abandonment of their original  concentrative plan of advance through the Free State, and the adoption  of two or more lines of operation, found themselves over their whole  front; from Colenso on the east, through Sterkstrom and Naauwport, to  the Modder River. The result throughout was--if not paralysis--at  least a cessation of movement, after the reverses above mentioned,  except in the brilliant and useful, but in scale minor, operations of  General French upon their left centre, about Naauwport and Colesberg.    In {p.170} the centre and east of the border district between Cape  Colony and the Free State--from Naauwport to Stormberg and beyond--the  position now was and continued to be especially critical, because most  exposed. Had the Boer forces there been handled with definiteness of  aim and concentration of effort in aggressive movement, serious  disaster could scarcely have been averted. But direction seems to have  been largely in the hands of the Free State farmers of the locality,  whose aptitudes and leading carried them little above the level of  irregular partisan troops. These are invaluable for their own  purposes, but those purposes are distinctly subsidiary to war on the  great scale, and by themselves alone do not decide campaigns. It is  impossible not to be struck with the general similarity of motive, and  of action, in the Boer operations from November to January in Cape  Colony, from Stormberg to Dordrecht and thence to the Basuto boundary,  and the dashing but militarily abortive raids to the rear of Lord  Roberts' right flank while he was at Bloemfontein. As soon as the  Dutch commandant in the latter instance settled upon {p.171} Wepener  for the expenditure of his strength, he had not only secured that  opportunity for ready retirement to which the partisan looks, but he  had also relieved the British commander from serious anxiety  concerning his communications.    The British disaster at Stormberg possesses no intrinsic interest, or  claim to mention, as a military incident; but as it attracted so much  notice at the time, and carried a certain moral effect, the details  must be summarized. The Dutch were strongly entrenched and in force on  a hill overlooking the place. The British were at Putter's Kraal and  Sterkstrom, some twenty odd miles distant by the railroad, which they  controlled up to Molteno, nine miles from Stormberg. The troops, 2,500  in number, had been marching, or in open railroad trucks, since early  morning of Saturday, December 9, when at 9 P.M. they detrained at  Molteno.    From this place there are two country roads, one direct to Stormberg,  the other branching to the left toward Steynsburg, on the  Stormberg-Naauwport railway. General Gatacre {p.172} intended to  follow the Steynsburg road for four or five miles, and there to take a  turn to the right, which his guides assured him would in another mile  and a half bring him to the south-west angle of the Boer position; but  the turn was missed and passed, with the result that after a very long  circuit, of two hours and a half, the column came out on the  north-west angle. The attack was immediately delivered, but the  troops, greatly exhausted, having halted only forty-five minutes since  9 o'clock, appear to have been incapacitated, by the accumulated  hardships and disappointments of the night, to contend with the  obstacles before them. The character of the casualties sufficiently  indicates the comparative feebleness of the fighting. There were 31  killed, 58 wounded, while in prisoners there were lost 633. The  accounts give the impression that many of the men taken were  physically too depressed to quit the shelter in which they found  themselves, in order to retire further. Two guns also were lost. The  retreat which followed almost immediately was conducted under  difficulties and fatigue, offering \"great opportunity for {p.173} an  active enemy\"; but it was not disturbed.    Further to the west and north General French, during this same period  and the ensuing month of January, was carrying on continuous active  operations, which will remain an instructive lesson for the military  student, but which, from the smallness of the scale and the technical  character of their merits, cannot well be related in a narrative of  this character. For it he has received, if not popular appreciation,  at least public reward in the high commendation of Lord Roberts, whose  own achievements in a long career of honour give the greatest weight  to his praise. \"I consider that General French showed marked ability  and judgment in constantly harassing the enemy and driving them from  one strong position after another, without exposing his men to heavy  loss.\" Yet even this scarcely measures the full value of French's  services. The untiring molestation to which the enemy was subjected by  him, as testified not only by his full report but by the daily  telegram of this or that brush, first in one quarter, then in another,  unquestionably--or {p.174} rather evidently--produced an impression  and concentrated an anxiety that contributed to divert attention from  the preparations to the westward, which were to result in the relief  of Kimberley and the capture of Cronje. In these later events French  was rewarded by the conspicuous as well as important part he played.    Reaching Cape Town immediately after the investment of Ladysmith,  French was sent up country by Sir Redvers Buller with orders to seize  Naauwport, then recently evacuated, and whenever possible to push on  and gain Colesberg. Naauwport was reoccupied November 19, and  thenceforth activity was incessant. Advancing, retiring, gaining,  losing, on front, flank, or rear, of the enemy, whatever else found  place, repose did not. The report is a record of unrestingness, which  communicated itself to the enemy as uneasiness. On the 16th of  December Arundel, midway from Naauwport to Colesberg, was occupied as  headquarters, and from that time, as before, \"every opportunity was  taken to worry the enemy and to harass his flanks and rear until  December {p.175} 29, when he finally evacuated his position in my  front and retired on Colesberg. These operations were fully reported  each night by telegraph.\" These telegrams journalise the restlessness  of the skilled warrior who looks beyond his minor _role_--beyond mere  partisan scurrying to and fro--to the great something to which he  contributes.    Lord Roberts availed himself ably of the disquiet caused by French. As  the fulness of time approached for the relief of Kimberley, the forces  about Naauwport grew larger and more restless than ever. Advance in  menacing force was made not only toward Colesberg, but to the  eastward, along the railroad to Steynsburg and Stormberg. Parties of  colonial horse crossed the country from Gatacre at Sterkstrom to  French and Kelly-Kenny at Steynsburg and Arundel. A general advance in  force seemed imminent. On February 2 French, in closing his long  report to Lord Roberts detailing the events since December 16, said,  \"In accordance with the instructions received at Cape Town from the  commander-in-chief, I am now making the arrangements ordered.\" The  explanation {p.176} of this mysterious allusion appeared thirteen  days later, when, on February 15, he led the relieving column into  Kimberley, two hundred miles distant. The same day his former command,  weakened by his own withdrawal with the cavalry, and by that of  Kelly-Kenny's division, and now under General Clements, had been  forced out of Arundel by greatly superior numbers; but to what avail?  Yet in another ten days the Boers from Kimberley to Colesberg were in  full retreat, and on February 26 Clements not only had regained his  ground, but had entered Colesberg, for which French had so long  manoeuvred in vain. The incident illustrates happily the far-reaching  effect of a great movement in mass, wisely conceived, ably directed,  and secretly executed.          CHAPTER V {p.177}    THE NATAL CAMPAIGN FROM THE INVESTMENT OF LADYSMITH THROUGH THE BATTLE  OF COLENSO      The severing of communications, by rail and telegraph, between  Ladysmith and the outer world, was the first step in a preliminary  process of attack and of defence; after which only the opponents  settled down to the relatively permanent conditions that constitute  the monotonous endurance of a siege. The British, prior to accepting  the investment, struck out right and left from day to day, by  skirmishing and reconnoitring parties; the Boers on the 9th of  November delivered an assault described as determined in character,  which will be more particularly mentioned later, but concerning which  details are singularly meagre. This no doubt is owing, partly, to the  habitual reticence of the Boers concerning {p.178} their reverses,  and partly to the isolation of the British garrison and correspondents  until a time when nearer and more exciting events engrossed the  columns of the press, crowding out this affair, already become past  history.    Unless the author has greatly misconceived the general utterances, the  occupation of Ladysmith has been in popular estimation merely an  unfortunate accident forced upon the British as a result of the  original faulty dispositions of the campaign. This view is scarcely  correct; and even if it were in part well founded, the natural  inference, that the investment was a misfortune, pure and simple,  would not follow. Probably no single incident of the war has been more  determinative of final issues than the tenure of Ladysmith. Therefore,  an examination of the relation borne by this single factor to the  whole, of which it was a part,"]]]
